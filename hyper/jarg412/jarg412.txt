#======= THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 4.1.2, 28 APR 1999 =======#

   This is the Jargon File, a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang
illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.

   This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely
used, shared, and modified.  There are (by intention) no legal
restraints on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about
its proper use to which many hackers are quite strongly attached.
Please extend the courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File,
ideally with a version number, as it will change and grow over time.
(Examples of appropriate citation form: "Jargon File 4.1.2" or "The
on-line hacker Jargon File, version 4.1.2, 28 APR 1999".)

   The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture.  Over
the years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable time to
maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large as editors
of it.  Editorial responsibilities include: to collate contributions
and suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating information; to
cross-reference related entries; to keep the file in a consistent
format; and to announce and distribute updated versions periodically.
Current volunteer editors include:

   	Eric Raymond 	<esr@snark.thyrsus.com>

   Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered
good form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a
published work or commercial product.  We may have additional
information that would be helpful to you and can assist you in framing
your quote to reflect not only the letter of the File but its spirit as
well.

   All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
public-domain file.

   From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,
and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the
volunteer editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to
have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to
purchase one of these.  They often contain additional material not
found in on-line versions.  The two `authorized' editions so far are
described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the
future.

:Introduction:
**************

   This document is a collection of slang terms used by various
subcultures of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is
included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;
what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for
fun, social communication, and technical debate.

   The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,
it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional
culture less than 40 years old.

   As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold
their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's
places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences.
Also as usual, _not_ knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately)
defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish
vocabulary) possibly even a {suit}.  All human cultures use slang in
this threefold way -- as a tool of communication, and of inclusion, and
of exclusion.

   Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps
in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard
to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are
code for shared states of _consciousness_.  There is a whole range of
altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level
hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any better
than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's `trompe l'oeil'
compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and hacker slang
encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a simple example,
take the distinction between a {kluge} and an {elegant} solution, and
the differing connotations attached to each.  The distinction is not
only of engineering significance; it reaches right back into the nature
of the generative processes in program design and asserts something
important about two different kinds of relationship between the hacker
and the hack.  Hacker slang is unusually rich in implications of this
kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche.

   But there is more.  Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very
conscious and inventive in their use of language.  These traits seem to
be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine we
are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of most of
us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic invention in most subcultures
of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious process.
Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a game to be
played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus display an almost
unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the
discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence.  Further, the
electronic media which knit them together are fluid, `hot' connections,
well adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless
culling of weak and superannuated specimens.  The results of this
process give us perhaps a uniquely intense and accelerated view of
linguistic evolution in action.

   Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and
anthropological assumptions.  For example, it has recently become
fashionable to speak of `low-context' versus `high-context'
communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level
of their languages and art forms.  It is usually claimed that
low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and
completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures which
value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by contrast,
high-context communication (elliptical, emotive, nuance-filled,
multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures which value
subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.  What then are we
to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely low-context
interaction with computers and exhibits primarily "low-context" values,
but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context slang style?

   The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a
compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the
surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version of
an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File', maintained by hackers
themselves for over 15 years.  This one (like its ancestors) is
primarily a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect
background or sidelight information on hacker culture that would be
awkward to try to subsume under individual slang definitions.

   Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that
the material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should
find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is
amusingly thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use
humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements about
what they feel.  Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing
sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this is
deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these disputes;
rather we have attempted to ensure that _everyone's_ sacred cows get
gored, impartially.  Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue,
but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints is.

   The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt it
either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences
-- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will benefit
from them.

   A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included
in {Appendix A}. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly
directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in {Appendix B}.  Appendix
C, the {Bibliography}, lists some non-technical works which have either
influenced or described the hacker culture.

   Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between description and influence can become more than a little
blurred.  Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central
role in spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to
successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one
will do likewise.

:Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak:
=================================

Linguists usually refer to informal language as `slang' and reserve the
term `jargon' for the technical vocabularies of various occupations.
However, the ancestor of this collection was called the `Jargon File',
and hacker slang is traditionally `the jargon'.  When talking about the
jargon there is therefore no convenient way to distinguish it from what
a _linguist_ would call hackers' jargon -- the formal vocabulary they
learn from textbooks, technical papers, and manuals.

   To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,
and shifts over time.  Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do
not speak or recognize hackish slang.

   Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:

   * `slang': informal language from mainstream English or non-technical
     subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).

   * `jargon': without qualifier, denotes informal `slangy' language
     peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers -- the subject of
     this lexicon.

   * `techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary of programming,
     computer science, electronics, and other fields connected to
     hacking.

This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon.

   The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one.  A lot of
techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing uptake
of jargon into techspeak.  On the other hand, a lot of jargon arises
from overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about this in
the {Jargon Construction} section below).

   In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicates
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical
dictionaries, or standards documents.

   A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems,
languages, or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker
folklore that isn't covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey
critical historical background necessary to understand other entries to
which they are cross-referenced.  Some other techspeak senses of jargon
words are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear; where the
text does not specify that a straight technical sense is under
discussion, these are marked with `[techspeak]' as an etymology.  Some
entries have a primary sense marked this way, with subsequent jargon
meanings explained in terms of it.

   We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of
terms.  The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon, for several reasons.  For one thing, it is well known that
many hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times,
even among the more obscure and intricate neologisms.  It often seems
that the generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have
an internal logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism
across separate cultures and even in different languages!  For another,
the networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly that `first use'
is often impossible to pin down.  And, finally, compendia like this one
alter what they observe by implicitly stamping cultural approval on
terms and widening their use.

   Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related
oral history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest
quite a number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due,
and illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as
{kluge}, {cruft}, and {foo}.  We believe specialist lexicographers will
find many of the historical notes more than casually instructive.

:Revision History:
==================

   The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab
(SAIL), and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities
including Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University
(CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

   The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File')
was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975.  From this time until
the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was
named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there.  Some terms in it date back considerably
earlier ({frob} and some senses of {moby}, for instance, go back to the
Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are believed to date at least back
to the early 1960s).  The revisions of jargon-1 were all unnumbered and
may be collectively considered `Version 1'.

   In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on
the SAIL computer, {FTP}ed a copy of the File to MIT.  He noticed that
it was hardly restricted to `AI words' and so stored the file on his
directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.

   The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the `>' caused versioning
under ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and
Guy L.  Steele Jr.  Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody
thought of correcting the term `jargon' to `slang' until the compendium
had already become widely known as the Jargon File.

   Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was
subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic
resynchronizations).

   The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard
Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and
ITS-related coinages.

   In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of
the File published in Stewart Brand's "CoEvolution Quarterly" (issue
29, pages 26-35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele
(including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons).  This appears to have
been the File's first paper publication.

   A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as "The
Hacker's Dictionary" (Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8).  The
other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin)
contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and Geoff
Goodfellow.  This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as
`Steele-1983' and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.

   Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing.  Originally, this was due to a desire to
freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of
Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the `temporary' freeze to
become permanent.

   The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding
cuts and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported
hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible.  At MIT,
most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines.  At the same time,
the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best
and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in
Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley.  The startups built LISP
machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a {TWENEX} system
rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved {ITS}.

   The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource
until 1991.  Stanford became a major {TWENEX} site, at one point
operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most
of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD
Unix standard.

   In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the
File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project
at Digital Equipment Corporation.  The File's compilers, already
dispersed, moved on to other things.  Steele-1983 was partly a monument
to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one involved
realized at the time just how wide its influence was to be.

   By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that
had grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies
obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from
MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence
on hacker language and humor.  Even as the advent of the microcomputer
and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File
(and related materials such as the {Some AI Koans} in Appendix A) came
to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture Matter of Britain
chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab.  The pace of
change in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously -- but the Jargon
File, having passed from living document to icon, remained essentially
untouched for seven years.

   This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after
careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983).  It merges in
about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a
very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also obsolete.

   This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim
is to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical
computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested.  More
than half of the entries now derive from {Usenet} and represent jargon
now current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts have
been made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC
programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe
world.

   Eric S. Raymond <<esr@snark.thyrsus.com>> maintains the new File
with assistance from Guy L. Steele Jr. <<gls@think.com>>; these are the
persons primarily reflected in the File's editorial `we', though we
take pleasure in acknowledging the special contribution of the other
coauthors of Steele-1983.  Please email all additions, corrections, and

   The 2.9.6 version became the main text of "The New Hacker's
Dictionary", by Eric Raymond (ed.), MIT Press 1991, ISBN 0-262-68069-6.

   The 3.0.0 version was published in September 1993 as the second
edition of "The New Hacker's Dictionary", again from MIT Press (ISBN
0-262-18154-1).

   The maintainers are committed to updating the on-line version of the
Jargon File through and beyond paper publication, and will continue to
make it available to archives and public-access sites as a trust of the
hacker community.

and 2225 entries.

   Version numbering: Version numbers should be read as
major.minor.revision.  Major version 1 is reserved for the `old' (ITS)
Jargon File, jargon-1.  Major version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR
(Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L.  Steele, Jr.)
leading up to and including the second paper edition.  From now on,
major version number N.00 will probably correspond to the Nth paper
edition.  Usually later versions will either completely supersede or
incorporate earlier versions, so there is generally no point in keeping
old versions around.

   Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and
assistance, and to the hundreds of Usenetters (too many to name here)
who contributed entries and encouragement.  More thanks go to several
of the old-timers on the Usenet group alt.folklore.computers, who
contributed much useful commentary and many corrections and valuable
historical perspective: Joseph M. Newcomer <<jn11+@andrew.cmu.edu>>,
Bernie Cosell <<cosell@bbn.com>>, Earl Boebert <<boebert@SCTC.com>>, and
Joe Morris <<jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org>>.

   We were fortunate enough to have the aid of some accomplished
linguists.  David Stampe <<stampe@hawaii.edu>> and Charles Hoequist
<<hoequist@bnr.ca>> contributed valuable criticism; Joe Keane
<<jgk@osc.osc.com>> helped us improve the pronunciation guides.

   A few bits of this text quote previous works.  We are indebted to
Brian A. LaMacchia <<bal@zurich.ai.mit.edu>> for obtaining permission
for us to use material from the "TMRC Dictionary"; also, Don Libes
<<libes@cme.nist.gov>> contributed some appropriate material from his
excellent book "Life With UNIX".  We thank Per Lindberg
<<per@front.se>>, author of the remarkable Swedish-language 'zine
"Hackerbladet", for bringing "FOO!" comics to our attention and
smuggling one of the IBM hacker underground's own baby jargon files out
to us.  Thanks also to Maarten Litmaath for generously allowing the
inclusion of the ASCII pronunciation guide he formerly maintained.  And
our gratitude to Marc Weiser of XEROX PARC
<<Marc_Weiser.PARC@xerox.com>> for securing us permission to quote from
PARC's own jargon lexicon and shipping us a copy.

   It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge the major contributions of
Mark Brader <<msb@sq.com>> and Steve Summit <<scs@eskimo.com>> to the
File and Dictionary; they have read and reread many drafts, checked
facts, caught typos, submitted an amazing number of thoughtful
comments, and done yeoman service in catching typos and minor usage
bobbles.  Their rare combination of enthusiasm, persistence,
wide-ranging technical knowledge, and precisionism in matters of
language has been of invaluable help.  Indeed, the sustained volume and
quality of Mr. Brader's input over several years and several different
editions has only allowed him to escape co-editor credit by the
slimmest of margins.

   Finally, George V. Reilly <<georgere@microsoft.com>> helped with TeX
arcana and painstakingly proofread some 2.7 and 2.8 versions, and Eric
Tiedemann <<est@thyrsus.com>> contributed sage advice throughout on
rhetoric, amphigory, and philosophunculism.

:How Jargon Works:
******************

:Jargon Construction:
=====================

   There are some standard methods of jargonification that became
established quite early (i.e., before 1970), spreading from such
sources as the Tech Model Railroad Club, the PDP-1 SPACEWAR hackers,
and John McCarthy's original crew of LISPers.  These include verb
doubling, soundalike slang, the `-P' convention, overgeneralization,
spoken inarticulations, and anthropomorphization.  Each is discussed
below.  We also cover the standard comparatives for design quality.

   Of these six, verb doubling, overgeneralization,
anthropomorphization, and (especially) spoken inarticulations have
become quite general; but soundalike slang is still largely confined to
MIT and other large universities, and the `-P' convention is found only
where LISPers flourish.

:Verb Doubling:
---------------

   A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as
an exclamation, such as "Bang, bang!" or "Quack, quack!".  Most of
these are names for noises.  Hackers also double verbs as a concise,
sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied subject does.  Also, a
doubled verb is often used to terminate a conversation, in the process
remarking on the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends
to do next.  Typical examples involve {win}, {lose}, {hack}, {flame},
{barf}, {chomp}:

     "The disk heads just crashed."  "Lose, lose."
     "Mostly he talked about his latest crock.  Flame, flame."
     "Boy, what a bagbiter!  Chomp, chomp!"

   Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb.  These have their own listings in the lexicon.

   The {Usenet} culture has one _tripling_ convention unrelated to
this; the names of `joke' topic groups often have a tripled last
element.  The first and paradigmatic example was
alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork (a "Muppet Show" reference); other
infamous examples have included:

     alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg
     alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die
     comp.unix.internals.system.calls.brk.brk.brk
     sci.physics.edward.teller.boom.boom.boom
     alt.sadistic.dentists.drill.drill.drill

:Soundalike slang:
------------------

   Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an
ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting.  It is
considered particularly {flavorful} if the phrase is bent so as to
include some other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine
"Dr. Dobb's Journal" is almost always referred to among hackers as `Dr.
Frob's Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'.  Terms of this kind that have
been in fairly wide use include names for newspapers:

         Boston Herald => Horrid (or Harried)
         Boston Globe => Boston Glob
         Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle
                => the Crocknicle (or the Comical)
         New York Times => New York Slime
         Wall Street Journal => Wall Street Urinal

   However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the
moment.  Standard examples include:

         Data General => Dirty Genitals
         IBM 360 => IBM Three-Sickly
         Government Property --- Do Not Duplicate (on keys)
                 => Government Duplicity --- Do Not Propagate
         for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins
         Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford)
                 => Marginal Hacks Hall
         Microsoft => Microsloth
         Internet Explorer => Internet Exploiter

   This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been
compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque
whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.

:The `-P' convention:
---------------------

   Turning a word into a question by appending the syllable `P'; from
the LISP convention of appending the letter `P' to denote a predicate
(a boolean-valued function).  The question should expect a yes/no
answer, though it needn't.  (See {T} and {NIL}.)

         At dinnertime:

     Q: ``Foodp?''

     A: ``Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.'' or ``T!''

     At any time:

     Q: ``State-of-the-world-P?''

     A: (Straight) ``I'm about to go home.''

     A: (Humorous) ``Yes, the world has a state.''

     On the phone to Florida:

     Q: ``State-p Florida?''

     A: ``Been reading JARGON.TXT again, eh?''

   [One of the best of these is a {Gosperism}.  Once, when we were at a
Chinese restaurant, Bill Gosper wanted to know whether someone would
like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup.  His inquiry
was: "Split-p soup?" -- GLS]

:Overgeneralization:
--------------------

   A very conspicuous feature of jargon is the frequency with which
techspeak items such as names of program tools, command language
primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside
of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them.  Thus (to
cite one of the best-known examples) Unix hackers often {grep} for
things rather than searching for them.  Many of the lexicon entries are
generalizations of exactly this kind.

   Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well.
Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to
them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to
nonuniform cases (or vice versa).  For example, because

     porous => porosity
     generous => generosity

hackers happily generalize:

     mysterious => mysteriosity
     ferrous => ferrosity
     obvious => obviosity
     dubious => dubiosity

   Another class of common construction uses the suffix `-itude' to
abstract a quality from just about any adjective or noun.  This usage
arises especially in cases where mainstream English would perform the
same abstraction through `-iness' or `-ingness'.  Thus:

     win => winnitude (a common exclamation)
     loss => lossitude
     cruft => cruftitude
     lame => lameitude

   Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for
example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be called
`lats' -- after all, they're measuring latitude!

   Also, note that all nouns can be verbed.  E.g.: "All nouns can be
verbed", "I'll mouse it up", "Hang on while I clipboard it over", "I'm
grepping the files".  English as a whole is already heading in this
direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers are
simply a bit ahead of the curve.

   The suffix "-full" can also be applied in generalized and fanciful
ways, as in "As soon as you have more than one cachefull of data, the
system starts thrashing," or "As soon as I have more than one headfull
of ideas, I start writing it all down." A common use is "screenfull",
meaning the amount of text that will fit on one screen, usually in text
mode where you have no choice as to character size. Another common form
is "bufferfull".

   However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques
characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a
hacker would never, for example, `productize', `prioritize', or
`securitize' things.  Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic
bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt.

   Similarly, all verbs can be nouned.  This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it is good
form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way.  Thus:

     win => winnitude, winnage
     disgust => disgustitude
     hack => hackification

   Further, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms.  Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary
includes an entry which implies that the plural of `mouse' is {meeces},
and notes that the defined plural of `caboose' is `cabeese'.  This
latter has apparently been standard (or at least a standard joke) among
railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many years.

   On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in `x' may
form plurals in `-xen' (see {VAXen} and {boxen} in the main text).
Even words ending in phonetic k alone are sometimes treated this way;
e.g., `soxen' for a bunch of socks.  Other funny plurals are
`frobbotzim' for the plural of `frobbozz' (see {frobnitz}) and `Unices'
and `Twenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Twenexes'; see {Unix},
{TWENEX} in main text).  But note that `Unixen' and `Twenexen' are
never used; it has been suggested that this is because `-ix' and `-ex'
are Latin singular endings that attract a Latinate plural.  Finally, it
has been suggested to general approval that the plural of `mongoose'
ought to be `polygoose'.

   The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either an
import or a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending `-im', or the
Anglo-Saxon plural suffix `-en') to cases where it isn't normally
considered to apply.

   This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well
aware of what they are doing when they distort the language.  It is
grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness.  It is done not to
impress but to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.

:Spoken inarticulations:
------------------------

   Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places
where their referent might more naturally be used.  It has been
suggested that this usage derives from the impossibility of
representing such noises on a comm link or in electronic mail, MUDs,
and IRC channels (interestingly, the same sorts of constructions have
been showing up with increasing frequency in comic strips).  Another
expression sometimes heard is "Complain!", meaning "I have a complaint!"

:Anthropomorphization:
----------------------

   Semantically, one rich source of jargon constructions is the hackish
tendency to anthropomorphize hardware and software.  This isn't done in
a naive way; hackers don't personalize their stuff in the sense of
feeling empathy with it, nor do they mystically believe that the things
they work on every day are `alive'.  What _is_ common is to hear
hardware or software talked about as though it has homunculi talking to
each other inside it, with intentions and desires.  Thus, one hears
"The protocol handler got confused", or that programs "are trying" to
do things, or one may say of a routine that "its goal in life is to X".
One even hears explanations like "...  and its poor little brain
couldn't understand X, and it died."  Sometimes modelling things this
way actually seems to make them easier to understand, perhaps because
it's instinctively natural to think of anything with a really complex
behavioral repertoire as `like a person' rather than `like a thing'.

:Comparatives:
--------------

   Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood
as members of sets of comparatives.  This is especially true of the
adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional quality
of code.  Here is an approximately correct spectrum:

     monstrosity  brain-damage  screw  bug  lose  misfeature
     crock  kluge  hack  win  feature  elegance  perfection

   The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never
actually attained.  Another similar scale is used for describing the
reliability of software:

     broken  flaky  dodgy  fragile  brittle
     solid  robust  bulletproof  armor-plated

   Note, however, that `dodgy' is primarily Commonwealth Hackish (it is
rare in the U.S.) and may change places with `flaky' for some speakers.

   Coinages for describing {lossage} seem to call forth the very finest
in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that
hackers have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish has
for obnoxious people.

:Hacker Writing Style:
======================

   We've already seen that hackers often coin jargon by overgeneralizing
grammatical rules.  This is one aspect of a more general fondness for
form-versus-content language jokes that shows up particularly in
hackish writing.  One correspondent reports that he consistently
misspells `wrong' as `worng'.  Others have been known to criticize
glitches in Jargon File drafts by observing (in the mode of Douglas
Hofstadter) "This sentence no verb", or "Too repetetetive", or "Bad
speling", or "Incorrectspa cing."  Similarly, intentional spoonerisms
are often made of phrases relating to confusion or things that are
confusing; `dain bramage' for `brain damage' is perhaps the most common
(similarly, a hacker would be likely to write "Excuse me, I'm cixelsyd
today", rather than "I'm dyslexic today").  This sort of thing is quite
common and is enjoyed by all concerned.

   Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses,
much to the dismay of American editors.  Thus, if "Jim is going" is a
phrase, and so are "Bill runs" and "Spock groks", then hackers
generally prefer to write: "Jim is going", "Bill runs", and "Spock
groks".  This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which
would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the
string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate
literal strings with characters that don't belong in them.  Given the
sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of programming,
American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading.  When
communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra characters
can be a real pain in the neck.

   Consider, for example, a sentence in a {vi} tutorial that looks like
this:

     Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd".

   Standard usage would make this

     Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd."

   but that would be very bad -- because the reader would be prone to
type the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in `vi(1)' dot repeats the
last command accepted.  The net result would be to delete _two_ lines!

   The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout.

   Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great
Britain, though the older style (which became established for
typographical reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and
quotes in typeset text) is still accepted there.  "Hart's Rules" and
the "Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors" call the hacker-like
style `new' or `logical' quoting.

   Another hacker habit is a tendency to distinguish between `scare'
quotes and `speech' quotes; that is, to use British-style single quotes
for marking and reserve American-style double quotes for actual reports
of speech or text included from elsewhere.  Interestingly, some
authorities describe this as correct general usage, but mainstream
American English has gone to using double-quotes indiscriminately
enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this
was a personal quirk of mine until I checked with Usenet --ESR].  One
further permutation that is definitely _not_ standard is a hackish
tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes (single quotes) in
pairs; that is, 'like this'.  This is modelled on string and character
literal syntax in some programming languages (reinforced by the fact
that many character-only terminals display the apostrophe in typewriter
style, as a vertical single quote).

   One quirk that shows up frequently in the {email} style of Unix
hackers in particular is a tendency for some things that are normally
all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C
routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning
of sentences.  It is clear that, for many hackers, the case of such
identifiers becomes a part of their internal representation (the
`spelling') and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an
appropriate reflex because Unix and C both distinguish cases and
confusing them can lead to {lossage}).  A way of escaping this dilemma
is simply to avoid using these constructions at the beginning of
sentences.

   There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to
the effect that precision of expression is more important than
conformance to traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or
lose information they can be discarded without a second thought.  It is
notable in this respect that other hackish inventions (for example, in
vocabulary) also tend to carry very precise shades of meaning even when
constructed to appear slangy and loose.  In fact, to a hacker, the
contrast between `loose' form and `tight' content in jargon is a
substantial part of its humor!

   Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis
conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and
these are occasionally carried over into written documents even when
normal means of font changes, underlining, and the like are available.

   One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS `LOUD', and
this becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that a person who
goes to caps-lock while in {talk mode} may be asked to "stop shouting,
please, you're hurting my ears!".

   Also, it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to
signify emphasis.  The asterisk is most common, as in "What the
*hell*?" even though this interferes with the common use of the
asterisk suffix as a footnote mark.  The underscore is also common,
suggesting underlining (this is particularly common with book titles;
for example, "It is often alleged that Joe Haldeman wrote
_The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to Robert Heinlein's earlier novel of
the future military, _Starship_Troopers_.").  Other forms exemplified
by "=hell=", "\hell/", or "/hell/" are occasionally seen (it's claimed
that in the last example the first slash pushes the letters over to the
right to make them italic, and the second keeps them from falling
over).  On FidoNet, you might see #bright# and ^dark^ text, which was
actually interpreted by some reader software.  Finally, words may also
be emphasized L I K E T H I S, or by a series of carets (^) under them
on the next line of the text.

   There is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this* (which
emphasizes the phrase as a whole), and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which
suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a
very young child or a mentally impaired person).  Bracketing a word with
the `*' character may also indicate that the writer wishes readers to
consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is being made.
Examples: *bang*, *hic*, *ring*, *grin*, *kick*, *stomp*, *mumble*.

   One might also see the above sound effects as <bang>, <hic>, <ring>,
<grin>, <kick>, <stomp>, <mumble>.  This use of angle brackets to mark
their contents originally derives from conventions used in {BNF}, but
since about 1993 it has been reinforced by the HTML markup used on the
World Wide Web.

   Angle-bracket enclosure is also used to indicate that a term stands
for some {random} member of a larger class (this is straight from
{BNF}). Examples like the following are common:

     So this <ethnic> walks into a bar one day...

   There is also an accepted convention for `writing under erasure'; the
text

     Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman,
     he's visiting from corporate HQ.

reads roughly as "Be nice to this fool, er, gentleman...".  This comes
from the fact that the digraph ^H is often used as a print
representation for a backspace.  It parallels (and may have been
influenced by) the ironic use of `slashouts' in science-fiction
fanzines.

   A related habit uses editor commands to signify corrections to
previous text.  This custom is fading as more mailers get good editing
capabilities, but one occasionally still sees things like this:

     I've seen that term used on alt.foobar often.
     Send it to Erik for the File.
     Oops...s/Erik/Eric/.

   The s/Erik/Eric/ says "change Erik to Eric in the preceding".  This
syntax is borrowed from the Unix editing tools `ed' and `sed', but is
widely recognized by non-Unix hackers as well.

   In a formula, `*' signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a
row are a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN).
Thus, one might write 2 ** 8 = 256.

   Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the
caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead `2^8 = 256'.  This
goes all the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII
`up-arrow' that later became the caret; this was picked up by Kemeny
and Kurtz's original BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the
`bc(1)' and `dc(1)' Unix tools, which have probably done most to
reinforce the convention on Usenet. (TeX math mode also uses ^ for
exponention.) The notation is mildly confusing to C programmers,
because `^' means bitwise exclusive-or in C.  Despite this, it was
favored 3:1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of Usenet.  It is used
consistently in this lexicon.

   In on-line exchanges, hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper
fractions (`3.5' or `7/2') rather than `typewriter style' mixed
fractions (`3-1/2').  The major motive here is probably that the former
are more readable in a monospaced font, together with a desire to avoid
the risk that the latter might be read as `three minus one-half'.  The
decimal form is definitely preferred for fractions with a terminating
decimal representation; there may be some cultural influence here from
the high status of scientific notation.

   Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very
small numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN).  This
is a form of `scientific notation' using `e' to replace `*10^'; for
example, one year is about 3e7 seconds long.

   The tilde (~) is commonly used in a quantifying sense of
`approximately'; that is, `~50' means `about fifty'.

   On Usenet and in the {MUD} world, common C boolean, logical, and
relational operators such as `|', `&', `||', `&&', `!', `==', `!=',
`>', `<', `>=', and `=<' are often combined with English.  The Pascal
not-equals, `<>', is also recognized, and occasionally one sees `/=' for
not-equals (from Ada, Common Lisp, and Fortran 90).  The use of prefix
`!' as a loose synonym for `not-' or `no-' is particularly common;
thus, `!clue' is read `no-clue' or `clueless'.

   A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming
languages to express ideas in a natural-language text.  For example,
one might see the following:

     In <jrh578689@thudpucker.com> J. R. Hacker wrote:

     Yeah, I tried one out too.

     #ifdef FLAME
     Hasn't anyone told those idiots that you can't get
     decent bogon suppression with AFJ filters at today's
     net volumes?
     #endif /* FLAME */

     I guess they figured the price premium for true
     frame-based semantic analysis was too high.
     Unfortunately, it's also the only workable approach.
     I wouldn't recommend purchase of this product unless
     you're on a *very* tight budget.

     #include <disclaimer.h>
     --
                      == Frank Foonly (Fubarco Systems)

   In the above, the `#ifdef'/`#endif' pair is a conditional
compilation syntax from C; here, it implies that the text between
(which is a {flame}) should be evaluated only if you have turned on (or
defined on) the switch FLAME.  The `#include' at the end is C for
"include standard disclaimer here"; the `standard disclaimer' is
understood to read, roughly, "These are my personal opinions and not to
be construed as the official position of my employer."

   The top section in the example, with > at the left margin, is an
example of an inclusion convention we'll discuss below.

   More recently, following on the huge popularity of the World Wide
Web, pseudo-HTML markup has become popular for similar purposes:

     <flame>
     Your father was a hamster and your mother smelt of elderberries!
     </flame>

   You'll even see this with an HTML-style modifier:

     <flame intensity="100%">
     You seem well-suited for a career in government.
     </flame>

   Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream
usage.  In particular, it is good hackish style to write a digit
sequence where you intend the reader to understand the text string that
names that number in English.  So, hackers prefer to write `1970s'
rather than `nineteen-seventies' or `1970's' (the latter looks like a
possessive).

   It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to
use multiply nested parentheses than is normal in English.  Part of
this is almost certainly due to influence from LISP (which uses deeply
nested parentheses (like this (see?)) in its syntax a lot), but it has
also been suggested that a more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing
with complexity and pushing systems to their limits is in operation.

   Finally, it is worth mentioning that many studies of on-line
communication have shown that electronic links have a de-inhibiting
effect on people.  Deprived of the body-language cues through which
emotional state is expressed, people tend to forget everything about
other parties except what is presented over that ASCII link.  This has
both good and bad effects.  A good one is that it encourages honesty
and tends to break down hierarchical authority relationships; a bad one
is that it may encourage depersonalization and gratuitous rudeness.
Perhaps in response to this, experienced netters often display a sort
of conscious formal politesse in their writing that has passed out of
fashion in other spoken and written media (for example, the phrase
"Well said, sir!" is not uncommon).

   Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person
communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely
because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing
with people and thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would face
to face.

   Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor
spelling or grammar, the network places a premium on literacy and
clarity of expression.  It may well be that future historians of
literature will see in it a revival of the great tradition of personal
letters as art.

:Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions:
========================================

   One area where conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux
is the marking of included material from earlier messages -- what would
be called `block quotations' in ordinary English.  From the usual
typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an extra
indent), there derived a practice of included text being indented by
one ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under Unix and many other
environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent.

   Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages
this way, so people had to paste in copy manually.  BSD `Mail(1)' was
the first message agent to support inclusion, and early Usenetters
emulated its style.  But the TAB character tended to push included text
too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions),
leading to ugly wraparounds.  After a brief period of confusion (during
which an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became
established in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading `>' or `> '
became standard, perhaps owing to its use in `ed(1)' to display tabs
(alternatively, it may derive from the `>' that some early Unix mailers
used to quote lines starting with "From" in text, so they wouldn't look
like the beginnings of new message headers).  Inclusions within
inclusions keep their `>' leaders, so the `nesting level' of a
quotation is visually apparent.

   The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a
followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on Usenet: the
fact that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order.
Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even
consist entirely of, "No, that's wrong" or "I agree" or the like.  It
was hard to see who was responding to what.  Consequently, around 1984,
new news-posting software evolved a facility to automatically include
the text of a previous article, marked with "> " or whatever the poster
chose.  The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant lines.
The result has been that, now, careless posters post articles
containing the _entire_ text of a preceding article, _followed_ only by
"No, that's wrong" or "I agree".

   Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease,
and there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader
skip over included text if desired.  Today, some posting software
rejects articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning
with `>' -- but this too has led to undesirable workarounds, such as the
deliberate inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren't quoted
and thus pull the message below the rejection threshold.

   Because the default mailers supplied with Unix and other operating
systems haven't evolved as quickly as human usage, the older
conventions using a leading TAB or three or four spaces are still
alive; however, >-inclusion is now clearly the prevalent form in both
netnews and mail.

   Inclusion practice is still evolving, and disputes over the
`correct' inclusion style occasionally lead to {holy wars}.

   Most netters view an inclusion as a promise that comment on it will
immediately follow.  The preferred, conversational style looks like
this,

          > relevant excerpt 1
          response to excerpt
          > relevant excerpt 2
          response to excerpt
          > relevant excerpt 3
          response to excerpt

or for short messages like this:

          > entire message
          response to message

Thanks to poor design of some PC-based mail agents, one will
occasionally see the entire quoted message _after_ the response, like
this

          response to message
          > entire message

but this practice is strongly deprecated.

   Though `>' remains the standard inclusion leader, `|' is
occasionally used for extended quotations where original variations in
indentation are being retained (one mailer even combines these and uses
`|>').  One also sees different styles of quoting a number of authors
in the same message: one (deprecated because it loses information) uses
a leader of `> ' for everyone, another (the most common) is `> > > > ',
`> > > ', etc. (or `>>>> ', `>>>', etc., depending on line length and
nesting depth) reflecting the original order of messages, and yet
another is to use a different citation leader for each author, say
`> ', `: ', `| ', `} ' (preserving nesting so that the inclusion order
of messages is still apparent, or tagging the inclusions with authors'
names).  Yet _another_ style is to use each poster's initials (or login
name) as a citation leader for that poster.

   Occasionally one sees a `# ' leader used for quotations from
authoritative sources such as standards documents; the intended
allusion is to the root prompt (the special Unix command prompt issued
when one is running as the privileged super-user).

:Hacker Speech Style:
=====================

   Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful
word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively
little use of contractions or street slang.  Dry humor, irony, puns,
and a mildly flippant attitude are highly valued -- but an underlying
seriousness and intelligence are essential.  One should use just enough
jargon to communicate precisely and identify oneself as a member of the
culture; overuse of jargon or a breathless, excessively gung-ho
attitude is considered tacky and the mark of a loser.

   This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally
spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical
fields.  In contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is
fairly constant throughout hackerdom.

   It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative
questions -- or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking are
often confused by the sense of their answers.  The problem is that they
have done so much programming that distinguishes between

     if (going) ...

and

     if (!going) ...

that when they parse the question "Aren't you going?" it may seem to be
asking the opposite question from "Are you going?", and so to merit an
answer in the opposite sense.  This confuses English-speaking
non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative
part weren't there.  In some other languages (including Russian,
Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the
problem wouldn't arise.  Hackers often find themselves wishing for a
word like French `si', German `doch', or Dutch `jawel' - a word with
which one could unambiguously answer `yes' to a negative question.
(See also {mu})

   For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double
negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows
them.  The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an
affirmative knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to disturb
them.

   In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering
questions containing logical connectives with a strictly literal rather
than colloquial interpretation.  A non-hacker who is indelicate enough
to ask a question like "So, are you working on finding that bug _now_
or leaving it until later?"  is likely to get the perfectly correct
answer "Yes!" (that is, "Yes, I'm doing it either now or later, and you
didn't ask which!").

:International Style:
=====================

   Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage
in American English, we have made some effort to get input from abroad.
Though the hacker-speak of other languages often uses translations of
jargon from English (often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon
File versions!), the local variations are interesting, and knowledge of
them may be of some use to travelling hackers.

   There are some references herein to `Commonwealth hackish'.  These
are intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in
the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada,
Australia, India, etc. -- though Canada is heavily influenced by
American usage).  There is also an entry on {{Commonwealth Hackish}}
reporting some general phonetic and vocabulary differences from U.S.
hackish.

   Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia report that
they often use a mixture of English and their native languages for
technical conversation.  Occasionally they develop idioms in their
English usage that are influenced by their native-language styles.
Some of these are reported here.

   On the other hand, English often gives rise to grammatical and
vocabulary mutations in the native language.  For example, Italian
hackers often use the nonexistent verbs `scrollare' (to scroll) and
`deletare' (to delete) rather than native Italian `scorrere' and
`cancellare'.  Similarly, the English verb `to hack' has been seen
conjugated in Swedish.  And Spanish-speaking hackers use `linkar' (to
link), `debugear' (to debug), and `lockear' (to lock).

   European hackers report that this happens partly because the English
terms make finer distinctions than are available in their native
vocabularies, and partly because deliberate language-crossing makes for
amusing wordplay.

   A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they
are parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to
English-speakers.

:Crackers, Phreaks, and Lamers:
===============================

   From the early 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local,
MS-DOS-based bulletin boards has been developing separately from
Internet hackerdom.  The BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a
stratum of `pirate boards' inhabited by {cracker}s, phone phreaks, and
{warez d00dz}.  These people (mostly teenagers running IBM-PC clones
from their bedrooms) have developed their own characteristic jargon,
heavily influenced by skateboard lingo and underground-rock slang.

   Though crackers often call themselves `hackers', they aren't (they
typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet
expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems).
Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's.  Nevertheless,
this lexicon covers much of it so the reader will be able to understand
what goes by on bulletin-board systems.

   Here is a brief guide to cracker and {warez d00dz} usage:

   * Misspell frequently.  The substitutions

               phone => fone
               freak => phreak

     are obligatory.

   * Always substitute `z's for `s's.  (i.e. "codes" -> "codez").

   * Type random emphasis characters after a post line (i.e. "Hey
     Dudes!#!$#$!#!$").

   * Use the emphatic `k' prefix ("k-kool", "k-rad", "k-awesome")
     frequently.

   * Abbreviate compulsively ("I got lotsa warez w/ docs").

   * Substitute `0' for `o' ("r0dent", "l0zer").

   * TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE
     TIME.

   These traits are similar to those of {B1FF}, who originated as a
parody of naive {BBS} users.  Occasionally, this sort of distortion may
be used as heavy sarcasm by a real hacker, as in:

         > I got X Windows running under Linux!

         d00d!  u R an '1337 hax0r

   The only practice resembling this in actual hacker usage is the
substitution of a dollar sign of `s' in names of products or service
felt to be excessively expensive, e.g. Compu$erve, Micro$oft.

   For further discussion of the pirate-board subculture, see {lamer},
{elite}, {leech}, {poser}, {cracker}, and especially {warez d00dz}.

:How to Use the Lexicon:
************************

:Pronunciation Guide:
=====================

   Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all
entries that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard
English nor obvious compounds thereof.  Slashes bracket phonetic
pronunciations, which are to be interpreted using the following
conventions:

  1. Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an accent or
     back-accent follows each accented syllable (the back-accent marks
     a secondary accent in some words of four or more syllables).  If
     no accent is given, the word is pronounced with equal accentuation
     on all syllables (this is common for abbreviations).

  2. Consonants are pronounced as in American English.  The letter `g'
     is always hard (as in "got" rather than "giant"); `ch' is soft
     ("church" rather than "chemist").  The letter `j' is the sound
     that occurs twice in "judge".  The letter `s' is always as in
     "pass", never a z sound.  The digraph `kh' is the guttural of
     "loch" or "l'chaim".  The digraph 'gh' is the aspirated g+h of
     "bughouse" or "ragheap" (rare in English).

  3. Uppercase letters are pronounced as their English letter names;
     thus (for example) H-L-L is equivalent to aych el el.  Z may be
     pronounced zee or zed depending on your local dialect.

  4. Vowels are represented as follows:

    a
          back, that

    ah
          father, palm (see note)

    ar
          far, mark

    aw
          flaw, caught

    ay
          bake, rain

    e
          less, men

    ee
          easy, ski

    eir
          their, software

    i
          trip, hit

    i:
          life, sky

    o
          block, stock (see note)

    oh
          flow, sew

    oo
          loot, through

    or
          more, door

    ow
          out, how

    oy
          boy, coin

    uh
          but, some

    u
          put, foot

    y
          yet, young

    yoo
          few, chew

    [y]oo
          oo with optional fronting as in `news' (nooz or nyooz)

   The glyph * is used for the `schwa' sound of unstressed or occluded
vowels (the one that is often written with an upside-down `e').  The
schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n;
that is, `kitten' and `color' would be rendered kit'n and kuhl'r, not
kit'*n and kuhl'*r.

   Note that the above table reflects mainly distinctions found in
standard American English (that is, the neutral dialect spoken by TV
network announcers and typical of educated speech in the Upper Midwest,
Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Philadelphia).  However, we separate
/o/ from /ah/, which tend to merge in standard American.  This may help
readers accustomed to accents resembling British Received Pronunciation.

   The intent of this scheme is to permit as many readers as possible to
map the pronunciations into their local dialect by ignoring some subset
of the distinctions we make.  Speakers of British RP, for example, can
smash terminal /r/ and all unstressed vowels.  Speakers of many
varieties of southern American will automatically map /o/ to /aw/; and
so forth.  (Standard American makes a good reference dialect for this
purpose because it has crisp consonents and more vowel distinctions
than other major dialects, and tends to retain distinctions between
unstressed vowels.  It also happens to be what your editor speaks.)

   Entries with a pronunciation of `' are written-only usages.  (No,
Unix weenies, this does _not_ mean `pronounce like previous
pronunciation'!)

:Other Lexicon Conventions:
===========================

   Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than
the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in
mainstream dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with
nonalphabetic characters are sorted after Z.  The case-blindness is a
feature, not a bug.

   The beginning of each entry is marked by a colon (`:') at the left
margin.  This convention helps out tools like hypertext browsers that
benefit from knowing where entry boundaries are, but aren't as
context-sensitive as humans.

   In pure ASCII renderings of the Jargon File, you will see {} used to
bracket words which themselves have entries in the File.  This isn't
done all the time for every such word, but it is done everywhere that a
reminder seems useful that the term has a jargon meaning and one might
wish to refer to its entry.

   In this all-ASCII version, headwords for topic entries are
distinguished from those for ordinary entries by being followed by "::"
rather than ":"; similarly, references are surrounded by "{{" and "}}"
rather than "{" and "}".

   Defining instances of terms and phrases appear in `slanted type'.  A
defining instance is one which occurs near to or as part of an
explanation of it.

   Prefixed ** is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect
usage.

   We follow the `logical' quoting convention described in the Writing
Style section above.  In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech.  Scare quotes (which
mark a word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes
(which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name
it) are both rendered with single quotes.

   References such as `malloc(3)' and `patch(1)' are to Unix facilities
(some of which, such as `patch(1)', are actually freeware distributed
over Usenet).  The Unix manuals use `foo(n)' to refer to item foo in
section (n) of the manual, where n=1 is utilities, n=2 is system calls,
n=3 is C library routines, n=6 is games, and n=8 (where present) is
system administration utilities.  Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the manuals
have changed roles frequently and in any case are not referred to in
any of the entries.

   Various abbreviations used frequently in the lexicon are summarized
here:

abbrev.
     abbreviation

adj.
     adjective

adv.
     adverb

alt.
     alternate

cav.
     caveat

conj.
     conjunction

esp.
     especially

excl.
     exclamation

imp.
     imperative

interj.
     interjection

n.
     noun

obs.
     obsolete

pl.
     plural

poss.
     possibly

pref.
     prefix

prob.
     probably

prov.
     proverbial

quant.
     quantifier

suff.
     suffix

syn.
     synonym (or synonymous with)

v.
     verb (may be transitive or intransitive)

var.
     variant

vi.
     intransitive verb

vt.
     transitive verb

   Where alternate spellings or pronunciations are given, alt.
separates two possibilities with nearly equal distribution, while var.
prefixes one that is markedly less common than the primary.

   Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known
to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate.  Here is a list
of abbreviations used in etymologies:

Amateur Packet Radio
     A technical culture of ham-radio sites using AX.25 and TCP/IP for
     wide-area networking and BBS systems.

     MIT happens to be located!)

CMU
     Carnegie-Mellon University

Commodore
     Commodore Business Machines

DEC
     The Digital Equipment Corporation (now Compaq).

     Some MITisms go back as far as the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC)
     at MIT c. 1960.  Material marked TMRC is from "An Abridged
     Dictionary of the TMRC Language", originally compiled by Pete
     Samson in 1959

UCLA
     University of California at Los Angeles

UK
     the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland)

WPI
     Worcester Polytechnic Institute, site of a very active community of
     PDP-10 hackers during the 1970s

WWW
     The World-Wide-Web.

XEROX PARC
     XEROX's Palo Alto Research Center, site of much pioneering
     research in user interface design and networking

Yale
     Yale University

   Some other etymology abbreviations such as {Unix} and {PDP-10} refer
to technical cultures surrounding specific operating systems,
processors, or other environments.  The fact that a term is labelled
with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use
is confined to that culture.  In particular, many terms labelled `MIT'
and `Stanford' are in quite general use.  We have tried to give some
indication of the distribution of speakers in the usage notes; however,
a number of factors mentioned in the introduction conspire to make
these indications less definite than might be desirable.

   A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed].
These are usually generalizations suggested by editors or Usenet
respondents in the process of commenting on previous definitions of
those entries.  These are _not_ represented as established jargon.

:Format For New Entries:
========================

   You can mail submissions for the Jargon File to
<jargon@snark.thyrsus.com>.

   We welcome new jargon, and corrections to or amplifications of
existing entries.  You can improve your submission's chances of being
included by adding background information on user population and years
of currency.  References to actual usage via URLs and/or DejaNews
pointers are particularly welcomed.

   All contributions and suggestions about the Jargon File will be
considered donations to be placed in the public domain as part of this
File, and may be used in subsequent paper editions.  Submissions may be
edited for accuracy, clarity and concision.

   We are looking to expand the File's range of technical specialties
covered.  There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the
scientific computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also
in numerical analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language
design, and many other related fields.  Send us your jargon!

   We are _not_ interested in straight technical terms explained by
textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an entry illuminates
`underground' meanings or aspects not covered by official histories.
We are also not interested in `joke' entries -- there is a lot of humor
in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations of what
hackers do and how they think.

   It is OK to submit items of jargon you have originated if they have
spread to the point of being used by people who are not personally
acquainted with you.  We prefer items to be attested by independent
submission from two different sites.

   An HTML version of the File is available at
http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon.  Please send us URLs for materials
related to the entries, so we can enrich the File's link structure.

   The Jargon File will be regularly maintained and made available for
browsing on the World Wide Web, and will include a version number.
Read it, pass it around, contribute -- this is _your_ monument!

The Jargon Lexicon
******************

= 0 =
=====

   :0:  Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter `O' (the 15th    letter
of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they    look a lot
alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually    distinct
have compounded the confusion.  If your zero is    center-dotted and
letter-O is not, or if letter-O looks almost    rectangular but zero
looks more like an American football stood on    end (or the reverse),
you're probably looking at a modern character    display (though the
dotted zero seems to have originated as an    option on IBM 3270
controllers).  If your zero is slashed but    letter-O is not, you're
probably looking at an old-style ASCII    graphic set descended from
the default typewheel on the venerable    ASR-33 Teletype
(Scandinavians, for whom /O is a letter, curse    this arrangement).
If letter-O has a slash across it and the zero    does not, your
display is tuned for a very old convention used at    IBM and a few
other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse    _this_ arrangement
even more, because it means two of their    letters collide).  Some
Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero    with a _reversed_ slash.
Old CDC computers rendered letter O    as an unbroken oval and 0 as an
oval broken at upper right and    lower left.  And yet another
convention common on early line    printers left zero unornamented but
added a tail or hook to the    letter-O so that it resembled an
inverted Q or cursive capital    letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft
ANSI standard for how to    draw ASCII characters, but the final
standard changed the    distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left
corner).  Are we    sufficiently confused yet?

   :1TBS: // n.  The "One True Brace Style"; see {indent    style}.

   :120 reset: /wuhn-twen'tee ree'set/ n.  [from 120 volts,    U.S.
wall voltage] To cycle power on a machine in order to reset or    unjam
it.  Compare {Big Red Switch}, {power cycle}.

   :2: infix.  In translation software written by hackers, infix    2
often represents the syllable _to_ with the connotation    `translate
to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string    (integer to
string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to [nt]roff).     Several versions of a
joke have floated around the internet in    which some idiot programmer
fixes the Y2K bug by changing all the    Y's in something to K's, as in
Januark, Februark, etc.

   :404: // n.  [from the HTTP error "file not found on    server"]
Extended to humans to convey that the subject has no    idea or no clue
- sapience not found.  May be used reflexively;    "Uh, I'm 404ing"
means "I'm drawing a blank".

   :404 compliant: adj.  The status of a website which has    been
completely removed, usually by the administrators of the    hosting
site as a result of net abuse by the website operators.     The term is
a tongue-in-cheek reference to the standard "301    compliant"
Murkowski Bill disclaimer used by spammers.  See also:    {spam},
{spamvertize}.

   :4.2: /for' poynt too'/ n.  Without a prefix, this almost
invariably refers to {BSD} Unix release 4.2.  Note that it is an
indication of cluelessness to say "version 4.2", and "release    4.2"
is rare; the number stands on its own, or is used in the more
explicit forms 4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2.  Similar remarks
apply to "4.3", "4.4" and to earlier, less-widespread releases    4.1
and 2.9.

   :@-party: /at'par`tee/ n.  [from the @-sign in an Internet
address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n par`tee/) A    semi-closed party
thrown for hackers at a science-fiction    convention (esp. the annual
World Science Fiction Convention or    "Worldcon"); one must have a
{network address} to get in, or    at least be in company with someone
who does.  One of the most    reliable opportunities for hackers to
meet face to face with people    who might otherwise be represented by
mere phosphor dots on their    screens.  Compare {boink}.

   The first recorded @-party was held at the Westercon (a California
SF convention) over the July 4th weekend in 1980.  It is not clear
exactly when the canonical @-party venue shifted to the Worldcon    but
it had certainly become established by Constellation in 1983.
Sadly, the @-party tradition has been in decline since about 1996,
mainly because having an @-address no longer functions as an
effective lodge pin.

= A =
=====

   :abbrev: /*-breev'/, /*-brev'/ n.  Common abbreviation for
`abbreviation'.

   :ABEND: /a'bend/, /*-bend'/ n.  [ABnormal END]    1. Abnormal
termination (of software); {crash}; {lossage}.     Derives from an
error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by    hackers but seriously
mainly by {code grinder}s.  Usually    capitalized, but may appear as
`abend'.  Hackers will try to    persuade you that ABEND is called
`abend' because it is what    system operators do to the machine late
on Friday when they want to    call it a day, and hence is from the
German `Abend' = `Evening'.     2. [alt.callahans] Absent By Enforced
Net Deprivation -    used in the subject lines of postings warning
friends of an    imminent loss of Internet access.  (This can be
because of computer    downtime, loss of provider, moving or illness.)
Variants of this    also appear: ABVND = `Absent By Voluntary Net
Deprivation' and    ABSEND = `Absent By Self-Enforced Net Deprivation'
have been    sighted.

   :accumulator: n. obs.  1. Archaic term for a register.  On-line
use of it as a synonym for `register' is a fairly reliable
indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or
that the architecture under discussion is quite old.  The term in
full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example,
though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A'
derive from historical use of the term `accumulator' (and not,
actually, from `arithmetic').  Confusingly, though, an `A'    register
name prefix may also stand for `address', as for    example on the
Motorola 680x0 family.  2. A register being used for    arithmetic or
logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index),    especially one
being used to accumulate a sum or count of many    items.  This use is
in context of a particular routine or stretch    of code.  "The FOOBAZ
routine uses A3 as an accumulator."     3. One's in-basket (esp. among
old-timers who might use sense 1).     "You want this reviewed?  Sure,
just put it in the accumulator."     (See {stack}.)

   :ACK: /ak/ interj.  1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic    for
0000110] Acknowledge.  Used to register one's presence (compare
mainstream _Yo!_).  An appropriate response to {ping} or    {ENQ}.  2.
[from the comic strip "Bloom County"] An    exclamation of surprised
disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!"     Semi-humorous.  Generally this sense
is not spelled in caps (ACK)    and is distinguished by a following
exclamation point.  3. Used to    politely interrupt someone to tell
them you understand their point    (see {NAK}).  Thus, for example, you
might cut off an overly    long explanation with "Ack.  Ack.  Ack.  I
get it now".

   There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you
there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no
reply, or during a lull in {talk mode} to see if the person has    gone
away (the standard humorous response is of course {NAK}    (sense 2),
i.e., "I'm not here").

   :Acme: n.  The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate,    and
non-functional gadgetry - where Rube Goldberg and Heath    Robinson
(two cartoonists who specialized in elaborate    contraptions) shop.
The name has been humorously expanded as A    Company Making
Everything.  Describing some X as an "Acme X"    either means "This is
{insanely great}", or, more likely,    "This looks {insanely great} on
paper, but in practice it's    really easy to shoot yourself in the
foot with it."  Compare    {pistol}.

   This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained
here for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the    Warner
Brothers' series of "Roadrunner" cartoons.  In these    cartoons, the
famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to    catch up with,
trap, and eat the Roadrunner.  His attempts usually    involved one or
more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices -    rocket jetpacks,
catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered    slingshots, etc.  These were
usually delivered in large cardboard    boxes, labeled prominently with
the Acme name.  These devices    invariably malfunctioned in improbable
and violent ways.

   :acolyte: n. obs.  [TMRC] An {OSU} privileged enough to    submit
data and programs to a member of the {priesthood}.

   :ad-hockery: /ad-hok'*r-ee/ n.  [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous
assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert systems,    which
lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are    in fact
entirely arbitrary.  For example, fuzzy-matching of    input tokens
that might be typing errors against a symbol table can    make it look
as though a program knows how to spell.     2. Special-case code to
cope with some awkward input that would    otherwise cause a program to
{choke}, presuming normal inputs    are dealt with in some cleaner and
more regular way.  Also called    `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity'
(/ad-hos'*-tee/), `ad-crockery'.     See also {ELIZA effect}.

   :Ada:: n.  A {{Pascal}}-descended language that has been made
mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the
Pentagon.  Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that,
technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that kind
of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult
to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle
(one common description wss "The PL/I of the 1980s").  Hackers    find
Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication    features
particularly hilarious.  Ada Lovelace (the daughter of    Lord Byron
who became the world's first programmer while    cooperating with
Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical    computing engines in
the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch    at the use to which her
name has latterly been put; the kindest    thing that has been said
about it is that there is probably a good    small language screaming
to get out from inside its vast,    {elephantine} bulk.

   :address harvester: n.  A robot that searches web pages    and/or
filters netnews traffic looking for valid email addresses.     Some
address harvesters are benign, used only for compiling address
directories.  Most, unfortunately, are run by miscreants compiling
address lists to {spam}.  Address harvesters can be foiled by    a
{teergrube}.

   :adger: /aj'r/ vt.  [UCLA mutant of {nadger}, poss. from    the
middle name of an infamous {tenured graduate student}] To    make a
bonehead move with consequences that could have been    foreseen with
even slight mental effort.  E.g., "He started    removing files and
promptly adgered the whole project".  Compare    {dumbass attack}.

   :admin: /ad-min'/ n.  Short for `administrator'; very    commonly
used in speech or on-line to refer to the systems person    in charge
on a computer.  Common constructions on this include    `sysadmin' and
`site admin' (emphasizing the administrator's    role as a site contact
for email and news) or `newsadmin'    (focusing specifically on news).
Compare {postmaster},    {sysop}, {system mangler}.

   :ADVENT: /ad'vent/ n.  The prototypical computer    adventure game,
first designed by Will Crowther on the {PDP-10}    in the mid-1970s as
an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming,    and expanded into a
puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford    in 1976. (Woods had
been one of the authors of    {INTERCAL}.) Now better known as
Adventure, but the {{TOPS-10}}    operating system permitted only
six-letter filenames.  See also    {vadding}, {Zork}, and {Infocom}.

   This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in
 text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
become fixtures of hacker-speak:  "A huge green fierce snake bars
the way!"  "I see no X here" (for some noun X).  "You are in a    maze
of twisty little passages, all alike."  "You are in a little    maze of
twisty passages, all different."  The `magic words'    {xyzzy} and
{plugh} also derive from this game.

   Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually _has_ a    `Colossal
Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that    also turns
up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary    entrance.

   ADVENT sources are available for FTP at
`ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/doc/misc/if-archive/games/source/advent.tar.Z'.

   :AFAIK: // n.  [Usenet] Abbrev. for "As Far As I Know".

   :AFJ: // n.  Written-only abbreviation for "April Fool's    Joke".
Elaborate April Fool's hoaxes are a long-established    tradition on
Usenet and Internet; see {kremvax} for an example.     In fact, April
Fool's Day is the _only_ seasonal holiday    consistently marked by
customary observances on Internet and other    hacker networks.

   :AI: /A-I/ n.  Abbreviation for `Artificial Intelligence',    so
common that the full form is almost never written or spoken    among
hackers.

   :AI-complete: /A-I k*m-pleet'/ adj.  [MIT, Stanford: by    analogy
with `NP-complete' (see {NP-})] Used to describe    problems or
subproblems in AI, to indicate that the solution    presupposes a
solution to the `strong AI problem' (that is, the    synthesis of a
human-level intelligence).  A problem that is    AI-complete is, in
other words, just too hard.

   Examples of AI-complete problems are `The Vision Problem'
(building a system that can see as well as a human) and `The    Natural
Language Problem' (building a system that can understand    and speak a
natural language as well as a human).  These may appear    to be
modular, but all attempts so far (1999) to solve them have    foundered
on the amount of context information and `intelligence'    they seem to
require. See also {gedanken}.

   :AI koans: /A-I koh'anz/ pl.n.  A series of pastiches of Zen
teaching riddles created by Danny Hillis at the MIT AI Lab around
various major figures of the Lab's culture (several are included
under {Some AI Koans} in Appendix A).  See also {ha ha    only
serious}, {mu}, and {{hacker humor}}.

   :AIDS: /aydz/ n.  Short for A* Infected Disk Syndrome (`A*'    is a
{glob} pattern that matches, but is not limited to, Apple    or Amiga),
this condition is quite often the result of practicing    unsafe {SEX}.
See {virus}, {worm}, {Trojan horse},    {virgin}.

   :AIDX: /ayd'k*z/ n.  Derogatory term for IBM's perverted    version
of Unix, AIX, especially for the AIX 3.? used in the IBM    RS/6000
series (some hackers think it is funnier just to pronounce    "AIX" as
"aches").  A victim of the dreaded "hybridism"    disease, this attempt
to combine the two main currents of the Unix    stream ({BSD} and {USG
Unix}) became a {monstrosity} to    haunt system administrators'
dreams.  For example, if new accounts    are created while many users
are logged on, the load average jumps    quickly over 20 due to silly
implementation of the user databases.     For a quite similar disease,
compare {HP-SUX}.  Also, compare    {Macintrash}, {Nominal
Semidestructor}, {ScumOS},    {sun-stools}.

   :airplane rule: n.  "Complexity increases the possibility of
failure; a twin-engine airplane has twice as many engine problems    as
a single-engine airplane."  By analogy, in both software and
electronics, the rule that simplicity increases robustness.  It is
correspondingly argued that the right way to build reliable systems
is to put all your eggs in one basket, after making sure that    you've
built a really _good_ basket.  See also {KISS    Principle}.

   :Alderson loop: n.  [Intel] A special version of an    {infinite
loop} where there is an exit condition available, but    inaccessible
in the current implementation of the code.  Typically    this is
created while debugging user interface code.  An example    would be
when there is a menu stating, "Select 1-3 or 9 to quit"    and 9 is not
allowed by the function that takes the selection from    the user.

   This term received its name from a programmer who had coded a modal
 message box in MSAccess with no Ok or Cancel buttons, thereby
disabling the entire program whenever the box came up.  The message
box had the proper code for dismissal and even was set up so that
when the non-existent Ok button was pressed the proper code would    be
called.

   :aliasing bug: n.  A class of subtle programming errors that    can
arise in code that does dynamic allocation, esp. via    `malloc(3)' or
equivalent.  If several pointers address    (`aliases for') a given
hunk of storage, it may happen that the    storage is freed or
reallocated (and thus moved) through one alias    and then referenced
through another, which may lead to subtle (and    possibly
intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the    allocation
history of the malloc {arena}.  Avoidable by use of    allocation
strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use of
higher-level languages, such as {LISP}, which employ a garbage
collector (see {GC}).  Also called a {stale pointer bug}.     See also
{precedence lossage}, {smash the stack},    {fandango on core}, {memory
leak}, {memory smash},    {overrun screw}, {spam}.

   Historical note: Though this term is nowadays associated with    C
programming, it was already in use in a very similar sense in the
Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s.

   :all-elbows: adj.  [MS-DOS] Of a TSR
(terminate-and-stay-resident) IBM PC program, such as the N    pop-up
calendar and calculator utilities that circulate on {BBS}    systems:
unsociable.  Used to describe a program that rudely steals    the
resources that it needs without considering that other TSRs may    also
be resident.  One particularly common form of rudeness is    lock-up
due to programs fighting over the keyboard interrupt.  See    {rude},
also {mess-dos}.

   :alpha geek: n.  [from animal ethologists' `alpha    male'] The most
technically accomplished or skillful person in some    implied context.
"Ask Larry, he's the alpha geek here."

   :alpha particles: n.  See {bit rot}.

   :alt: /awlt/  1. n. The alt shift key on an IBM PC or    {clone}
keyboard; see {bucky bits}, sense 2 (though typical    PC usage does
not simply set the 0200 bit).  2. n. The `option'    key on a
Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals that the    speaker hacked
PCs before coming to the Mac (see also {feature    key}, which is
sometimes _incorrectly_ called `alt').     3. n.,obs.  [PDP-10; often
capitalized to ALT] Alternate name    for the ASCII ESC character
(ASCII 0011011), after the keycap    labeling on some older terminals;
also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/).     This character was almost never
pronounced `escape' on an ITS    system, in {TECO}, or under TOPS-10 --
always alt, as in "Type    alt alt to end a TECO command" or "alt-U
onto the system" (for    "log onto the [ITS] system").  This usage
probably arose because    alt is more convenient to say than `escape',
especially when    followed by another alt or a character (or another
alt _and_ a    character, for that matter).  4. The alt hierarchy on
Usenet,    the tree of newsgroups created by users without a formal
vote and    approval procedure.  There is a myth, not entirely
implausible,    that alt is acronymic for "anarchists, lunatics, and
terrorists"; but in fact it is simply short for "alternative".

   :alt bit: /awlt bit/ [from alternate] adj.  See {meta    bit}.

   :Aluminum Book: n.  [MIT] "Common LISP: The Language", by    Guy L.
Steele Jr. (Digital Press, first edition 1984, second    edition 1990).
Note that due to a technical screwup some printings    of the second
edition are actually of a color the author describes    succinctly as
"yucky green".  See also {{book titles}}.

   :ambimouseterous: /am-b*-mows'ter-us/ or /am-b*-mows'trus/    adj.
[modeled on ambidextrous]    Able to use a mouse with either hand.

   :Amiga: n  A series of personal computer models originally    sold
by Commodore, based on 680x0 processors, custom support chips    and an
operating system that combined some of the best features of
Macintosh and Unix with compatibility with neither.

   The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world
standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining
serious market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a
substantial technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead,
it acquired a small but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers
who dreamt of one day unseating the clones (see {Amiga    Persecution
Complex}).  The traits of this culture are both spoofed    and
illuminated in    The BLAZE Humor Viewer
(http://www-ccsl.cs.umass.edu/~barrett/bm/Viewer_Sections/Main.HTML).
The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a    small industry of
companies building software and hardware for the    platform,
especially in graphics and video applications (see    {video toaster}).

   Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&D,
allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead.     After
Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through
several hands, none of whom did much with it.  However, the Amiga    is
still being produced in Europe under license and has a    substantial
number of fans, which will probably extend the    platform's life
considerably.

   :Amiga Persecution Complex: n.  The disorder suffered by a
particularly egregious variety of {bigot}, those who believe    that
the marginality of their preferred machine is the result of    some
kind of industry-wide conspiracy (for without a conspiracy of    some
kind, the eminent superiority of their beloved shining jewel    of a
platform would obviously win over all, market pressures be    damned!)
Those afflicted are prone to engaging in {flame war}s    and calling
for boycotts and mailbombings.  Amiga Persecution    Complex is by no
means limited to Amiga users; NeXT, {NeWS},    {OS/2}, Macintosh,
{LISP}, and {GNU} users are also common    victims. {Linux} users used
to display symptoms very frequently    before Linux started winning;
some still do.  See also {newbie},    {troll}, {holy wars}, {weenie},
{Get a life!}.

   :amoeba: n.  Humorous term for the Commodore Amiga personal
computer.

   :amp off: vt.  [Purdue] To run in {background}.  From the    Unix
shell `&' operator.

   :amper: n.  Common abbreviation for the name of the ampersand
(`&', ASCII 0100110) character.  See {{ASCII}} for other synonyms.

   :angle brackets: n.  Either of the characters `<' (ASCII    0111100)
and `>' (ASCII 0111110) (ASCII less-than or    greater-than signs).
Typographers in the {Real World} use angle    brackets which are either
taller and slimmer (the ISO `Bra' and    `Ket' characters), or
significantly smaller (single or double    guillemets) than the
less-than and greater-than signs.     See {broket}, {{ASCII}}.

   :angry fruit salad: n.  A bad visual-interface design that    uses
too many colors.  (This term derives, of course, from the    bizarre
day-glo colors found in canned fruit salad.)  Too often one    sees
similar effects from interface designers using color window    systems
such as {X}; there is a tendency to create displays that    are flashy
and attention-getting but uncomfortable for long-term    use.

   :annoybot: /*-noy-bot/ n.  [IRC] See {bot}.

   :annoyware: n.  A type of {shareware} that frequently    disrupts
normal program operation to display requests for payment    to the
author in return for the ability to disable the request    messages.
(Also called `nagware') The requests generally require    user action
to acknowledge the message before normal operation is    resumed and
are often tied to the most frequently used features of    the software.
See also {careware}, {charityware},    {crippleware}, {freeware},
{FRS}, {guiltware},    {postcardware}, and {-ware}; compare {payware}.

   :ANSI: /an'see/  1. n. [techspeak] The American National
Standards Institute. ANSI, along with the International Organization
for Standards (ISO), standardized the C programming language (see
{K&R}, {Classic C}), and promulgates many other important    software
standards.  2. n. [techspeak] A terminal may be said to be    `ANSI' if
it meets the ANSI X.364 standard for terminal control.
Unfortunately, this standard was both over-complicated and too
permissive.  It has been retired and replaced by the ECMA-48
standard, which shares both flaws.  3. n. [BBS jargon] The set of
screen-painting codes that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept.
This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must be loaded on    an
MS-DOS computer to view such codes.  Unfortunately, neither DOS    ANSI
nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly match the ANSI X.364
terminal standard.  For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold
highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on
`intense' (bright) colors.  Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is
often used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate
the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS.  Particular use    depends
on context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set    is used
with the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM    characters' tend to
go together.

   :ANSI standard pizza: /an'see stan'd*rd peet'z*/  [CMU]    Pepperoni
and mushroom pizza.  Coined allegedly because most pizzas    ordered by
CMU hackers during some period leading up to mid-1990    were of that
flavor.  See also {rotary debugger}; compare    {ISO standard cup of
tea}.

   :AOL!: n.  [Usenet] Common synonym for "Me, too!"     alluding to
the legendary propensity of America Online users to    utter
contentless "Me, too!" postings.  The number of exclamation    points
following varies from zero to five or so.  The pseudo-HTML

        <AOL>Me, too!</AOL>

is also frequently seen. See also {September that never ended}.

   :app: /ap/ n.  Short for `application program', as opposed    to a
systems program.  Apps are what systems vendors are forever    chasing
developers to create for their environments so they can    sell more
boxes.  Hackers tend not to think of the things they    themselves run
as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes    compilers,
program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a    user would
consider all those to be apps.  (Broadly, an app is    often a
self-contained environment for performing some well-defined    task
such as `word processing'; hackers tend to prefer more
general-purpose tools.) See {killer app}; oppose {tool},    {operating
system}.

   :arena: n.  [common; Unix] The area of memory attached to a
process by `brk(2)' and `sbrk(2)' and used by    `malloc(3)' as dynamic
storage.  So named from a `malloc:    corrupt arena' message emitted
when some early versions detected an    impossible value in the free
block list.  See {overrun screw},    {aliasing bug}, {memory leak},
{memory smash}, {smash    the stack}.

   :arg: /arg/ n.  Abbreviation for `argument' (to a    function), used
so often as to have become a new word (like    `piano' from
`pianoforte').  "The sine function takes 1 arg,    but the arc-tangent
function can take either 1 or 2 args."     Compare {param}, {parm},
{var}.

   :ARMM: n.  [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal    Moderation']
A Usenet {cancelbot} created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls,    Ohio.
ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from
anonymous-posting sites.  Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated
control messages!  Transformed by this stroke of programming
ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke
loose on the night of March 31, 1993 and proceeded to {spam}
news.admin.policy with a recursive explosion of over 200    messages.

   ARMM's bug produced a recursive {cascade} of messages each of which
 mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other
headers of its parent.  This produced a flood of messages in which
each header took up several screens and each message ID and subject
line got longer and longer and longer.

   Reactions varied from amusement to outrage.  The pathological
messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying
line charges for their Usenet feeds.  One poster described the ARMM
debacle as "instant Usenet history" (also establishing the term
{despew}), and it has since been widely cited as a cautionary
example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
incompetence can wreak on a network.  Compare {Great Worm};
{sorcerer's apprentice mode}.  See also {software laser},    {network
meltdown}.

   :armor-plated: n.  Syn. for {bulletproof}.

   :asbestos: adj.  [common] Used as a modifier to anything    intended
to protect one from {flame}s; also in other highly
{flame}-suggestive usages.  See, for example, {asbestos    longjohns}
and {asbestos cork award}.

   :asbestos cork award: n.  Once, long ago at MIT, there was a
{flamer} so consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed,    had
made, and distributed posters announcing that said flamer had    been
nominated for the `asbestos cork award'.  (Any reader in    doubt as to
the intended application of the cork should consult the    etymology
under {flame}.)  Since then, it is agreed that only a    select few
have risen to the heights of bombast required to earn    this dubious
dignity -- but there is no agreement on _which_    few.

   :asbestos longjohns: n.  Notional garments donned by    {Usenet}
posters just before emitting a remark they expect will    elicit
{flamage}.  This is the most common of the {asbestos}    coinages.
Also `asbestos underwear', `asbestos overcoat', etc.

   :ASCII:: /as'kee/ n.  [acronym: American Standard Code for
Information Interchange] The predominant character set encoding of
present-day computers.  The modern version uses 7 bits for each
character, whereas most earlier codes (including an early version    of
ASCII) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion of    lowercase
letters -- a major {win} -- but it did not provide    for accented
letters or any other letterforms not used in English    (such as the
German sharp-S    or the ae-ligature    which is a letter in, for
example, Norwegian).  It could be worse,    though.  It could be much
worse.  See {{EBCDIC}} to understand how.

   Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal
shorthand for them.  Every character has one or more names -- some
formal, some concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII
characters are collected here.  See also individual entries for
{bang}, {excl}, {open}, {ques}, {semi}, {shriek},    {splat},
{twiddle}, and {Yu-Shiang Whole Fish}.

   This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII
pronunciation guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order;
character pairs are sorted in by first member.  For each character,
common names are given in rough order of popularity, followed by
names that are reported but rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names
are surrounded by brokets: <>.  Square brackets mark the
particularly silly names introduced by {INTERCAL}.  The
abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and    "open/close"
respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some    usage
information.

idea; {{Commonwealth Hackish}} has its own, rather more    apposite use
of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards    the pound graphic
  happens to replace `#'; thus Britishers sometimes call    `#' on a
U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the    American error).  The
U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned    commercial practice of
using a `#' suffix to tag pound weights    on bills of lading.  The
character is usually pronounced `hash'    outside the U.S.  There are
more culture wars over the correct    pronunciation of this character
than any other, which has led to    the {ha ha only serious} suggestion
that it be pronounced    `shibboleth' (see Judges 12.6 in an Old
Testament or    Torah).

   The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for
underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963
version), which had these graphics in those character positions
rather than the modern punctuation characters.

   The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same    as
tilde in typeset material    but the ASCII tilde serves for both
(compare {angle    brackets}).

   Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The `#',    `$', `>',
and `&' characters, for example, are all    pronounced "hex" in
different communities because various    assemblers use them as a
prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in    particular, `#' in many
assembler-programming cultures,    `$' in the 6502 world, `>' at Texas
Instruments, and    `&' on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80
machines).  See    also {splat}.

   The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits
look more and more like a serious {misfeature} as the use of
international networks continues to increase (see {software    rot}).
Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to embody    the
assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to people who    want
to use a character set suited to their own languages.     Perversely,
though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating    `national'
character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use    a _smaller_
subset common to all those in use.

   :ASCII art: n.  The fine art of drawing diagrams using the    ASCII
character set (mainly `|', `-', `/', `\',    and `+').  Also known as
`character graphics' or `ASCII    graphics'; see also {boxology}.  Here
is a serious    example:

         o----)||(--+--|<----+   +---------o + D O
           L  )||(  |        |   |             C U

         feeding a capacitor input filter circuit

And here are some very silly examples:

       \_\                           /_/

There is an important subgenre of ASCII art that puns on the
standard character names in the fashion of a rebus.

     +--------------------------------------------------------+

                  " A Bee in the Carrot Patch "

Within humorous ASCII art, there is for some reason an entire
flourishing subgenre of pictures of silly cows.  Four of these are
reproduced in the silly examples above, here are three more:

              (__)              (__)              (__)
              (\/)              ($$)              (**)
       /-------\/        /-------\/        /-------\/

        ~~    ~~          ~~    ~~          ~~    ~~
     Satanic cow    This cow is a Yuppie   Cow in love

   Finally, here's a magnificent example of ASCII art depicting an
Edwardian train station in Dunedin, New Zealand:

                                       .-.

There is a newsgroup, rec.arts.ascii, devoted to this    genre;
however, see also {warlording}.

   :ASCIIbetical order: /as'kee-be'-t*-kl or'dr/ adj.,n.     Used to
indicate that data is sorted in ASCII collated order rather    than
alphabetical order.  This lexicon is sorted in something close    to
ASCIIbetical order, but with case ignored and entries beginning    with
non-alphabetic characters moved to the end.  "At my video    store,
they used their computer to sort the videos into    ASCIIbetical order,
so I couldn't find `"Crocodile" Dundee' until I    thought to look
before `2001' and `48 HRS.'!"

   :astroturfing: n.  The use of paid shills to create the
impression of a popular movement, through means like letters to
newspapers from soi-disant `concerned citizens', paid opinion
pieces, and the formation of grass-roots lobbying groups that are
actually funded by a PR group (astroturf is fake grass; hence the
term).  This term became common among hackers after it came to    light
in early 1998 that Microsoft had attempted to use such    tactics to
forestall the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust    action against
the company.

   This backfired horribly, angering a number of state
attorneys-general enough to induce them to go public with plans to
join the Federal suit.  It also set anybody defending Microsoft on
the net for the accusation "You're just astroturfing!".

   :atomic: adj.  [from Gk. `atomos', indivisible]    1. Indivisible;
cannot be split up.  For example, an instruction    may be said to do
several things `atomically', i.e., all the    things are done
immediately, and there is no chance of the    instruction being
half-completed or of another being interspersed.     Used esp. to
convey that an operation cannot be screwed up by    interrupts.  "This
routine locks the file and increments the    file's semaphore
atomically."  2. [primarily techspeak] Guaranteed    to complete
successfully or not at all, usu. refers to database    transactions.
If an error prevents a partially-performed    transaction from
proceeding to completion, it must be "backed out,"    as the database
must not be left in an inconsistent state.

   Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the
connotations that `atomic' has in mainstream English (i.e.  of
particles of matter, nuclear explosions etc.).

   :attoparsec: n.  About an inch.  `atto-' is the standard SI
prefix for multiplication by 10^(-18).  A parsec    (parallax-second)
is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is thus    3.26 * 10^(-18) light
years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1    attoparsec/{microfortnight} equals
about 1 inch/sec).  This unit    is reported to be in use (though
probably not very seriously) among    hackers in the U.K.  See {micro-}.

   :AUP: /A-U-P/  Abbreviation, "Acceptable Use Policy".  The    policy
of a given ISP which sets out what the ISP considers to be
(un)acceptable uses of its Internet resources.

   :autobogotiphobia: /aw'toh-boh-got`*-foh'bee-*/  n. See
{bogotify}.

   :automagically: /aw-toh-maj'i-klee/ adv.  Automatically, but    in a
way that, for some reason (typically because it is too    complicated,
or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker    doesn't feel
like explaining to you.  See {magic}.  "The    C-INTERCAL compiler
generates C, then automagically invokes    `cc(1)' to produce an
executable."

   This term is quite old, going back at least to the mid-70s in
jargon and probably much earlier.  The word `automagic' occurred in
advertising (for a shirt-ironing gadget) as far back as the late
1940s.

   :avatar: n. Syn.  [in Hindu mythology, the incarnation of    a god]
1. Among people working on virtual reality and    {cyberspace}
interfaces, an "avatar" is an icon or    representation of a user in a
shared virtual reality.  The term is    sometimes used on {MUD}s.  2.
[CMU, Tektronix] {root},    {superuser}.  There are quite a few Unix
machines on which the    name of the superuser account is `avatar'
rather than `root'.     This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who
found the terms    `root' and  `superuser' unimaginative, and thought
`avatar'    might better impress people with the responsibility they
were    accepting.

   :awk: /awk/  1. n. [Unix techspeak] An interpreted language    for
massaging text data developed by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger,    and
Brian Kernighan (the name derives from their initials).  It is
characterized by C-like syntax, a declaration-free approach to
variable typing and declarations, associative arrays, and
field-oriented text processing.  See also {Perl}.  2. n.     Editing
term for an expression awkward to manipulate through normal    {regexp}
facilities (for example, one containing a    {newline}).  3. vt. To
process data using `awk(1)'.

   :B5: //  [common] Abbreviation for "Babylon 5", a    science-fiction
TV series as revered among hackers as was the    original Star Trek.

   :back door: n.  [common] A hole in the security of a    system
deliberately left in place by designers or maintainers.  The
motivation for such holes is not always sinister; some operating
systems, for example, come out of the box with privileged accounts
intended for use by field service technicians or the vendor's
maintenance programmers.  Syn. {trap door}; may also be called a
`wormhole'.  See also {iron box}, {cracker}, {worm},    {logic bomb}.

   Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than
anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known.     Ken
Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the
existence of a back door in early Unix versions that may have
qualified as the most fiendishly clever security hack of all time.
In this scheme, the C compiler contained code that would recognize
when the `login' command was being recompiled and insert some    code
recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to    the
system whether or not an account had been created for him.

   Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler.  But to
recompile the compiler, you have to _use_ the compiler -- so
Thompson also arranged that the compiler would _recognize when    it
was compiling a version of itself_, and insert into the    recompiled
compiler the code to insert into the recompiled    `login' the code to
allow Thompson entry -- and, of course, the    code to recognize itself
and do the whole thing again the next time    around!  And having done
this once, he was then able to recompile    the compiler from the
original sources; the hack perpetuated itself    invisibly, leaving the
back door in place and active but with no    trace in the sources.

   The talk that suggested this truly moby hack was published as
"Reflections on Trusting Trust", "Communications of the ACM    27", 8
(August 1984), pp. 761-763 (text available at
`http://www.acm.org/classics').  Ken Thompson has since    confirmed
that this hack was implemented and that the Trojan Horse    code did
appear in the login binary of a Unix Support group    machine.  Ken
says the crocked compiler was never distributed.     Your editor has
heard two separate reports that suggest that the    crocked login did
make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and    that it enabled at
least one late-night login across the network by    someone using the
login name `kt'.

   :backbone cabal: n.  A group of large-site administrators who
pushed through the {Great Renaming} and reined in the chaos of
{Usenet} during most of the 1980s.  During most of its lifetime,    the
Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied its    own
existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy to their
secrets to respond "There is no Cabal" whenever the existence or
activities of the group were speculated on in public.

   The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery.  Even
a decade after the cabal {mailing list} disbanded in late 1988
following a bitter internal catfight, many people believed (or
claimed to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but only    gone
deeper underground with its power intact.

   This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about
various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking
over the Usenet or Internet.  These paranoias were later satirized
in ways that took on a life of their own.  See {Eric Conspiracy}    for
one example.

   See {NANA} for the subsequent history of "the Cabal".

   :backbone site: n.,obs.  Formerly, a key Usenet and email    site,
one that processes a large amount of third-party traffic,    especially
if it is the home site of any of the regional    coordinators for the
Usenet maps.  Notable backbone sites as of    early 1993, when this
sense of the term was beginning to pass out    of general use due to
wide availability of cheap Internet    connections, included uunet and
the mail machines at Rutgers    University, UC Berkeley, {DEC}'s
Western Research Laboratories,    Ohio State University, and the
University of Texas.  Compare    {rib site}, {leaf site}.

   [1996 update: This term is seldom heard any more.  The UUCP network
 world that gave it meaning has nearly disappeared; everyone is on
the Internet now and network traffic is distributed in very
different patterns.  Today one might see references to a `backbone
router' instead --ESR]

   :backgammon::  See {bignum} (sense 3), {moby} (sense 4),    and
{pseudoprime}.

   :background: n.,adj.,vt.  [common] To do a task `in    background'
is to do it whenever {foreground} matters are not    claiming your
undivided attention, and `to background' something    means to relegate
it to a lower priority.  "For now, we'll just    print a list of nodes
and links; I'm working on the graph-printing    problem in background."
Note that this implies ongoing activity    but at a reduced level or
in spare time, in contrast to mainstream    `back burner' (which
connotes benign neglect until some future    resumption of activity).
Some people prefer to use the term for    processing that they have
queued up for their unconscious minds (a    tack that one can often
fruitfully take upon encountering an    obstacle in creative work).
Compare {amp off}, {slopsucker}.

   Technically, a task running in background is detached from the
terminal where it was started (and often running at a lower
priority); oppose {foreground}.  Nowadays this term is primarily
associated with {{Unix}}, but it appears to have been first used    in
this sense on OS/360.

   :backreference: n.  1. In a regular expression or pattern    match,
the text which was matched within grouping parentheses    parentheses.
2. The part of the pattern which refers back to the    matched text. 3.
By extension, anything which refers back to    something which has been
seen or discussed before.  "When you said    `she' just now, who were
you backreferencing?"

   :backronym: n.  [portmanteau of back + acronym] A word
interpreted as an acronym that was not originally so intended.
Examples are given under {BASIC}, {recursive acronym}    (Cygnus),
{Acme}, and {mung}.  Discovering backronyms is a    common form of
wordplay among hackers.

   :backspace and overstrike: interj.  [rare] Whoa!  Back up.     Used
to suggest that someone just said or did something wrong.     Once
common among APL programmers; may now be obsolete.

   :backward combatability: /bak'w*rd k*m-bat'*-bil'*-tee/ n.     [CMU,
Tektronix: from `backward compatibility'] A property of    hardware or
software revisions in which previous protocols,    formats, layouts,
etc. are irrevocably discarded in favor of `new    and improved'
protocols, formats, and layouts, leaving the previous    ones not
merely deprecated but actively defeated.  (Too often, the    old and
new versions cannot definitively be distinguished, such    that
lingering instances of the previous ones yield crashes or    other
infelicitous effects, as opposed to a simple "version    mismatch"
message.)  A backwards compatible change, on the other    hand, allows
old versions to coexist without crashes or error    messages, but too
many major changes incorporating elaborate    backwards compatibility
processing can lead to extreme {software    bloat}.  See also {flag
day}.

   :BAD: /B-A-D/ adj.  [IBM: acronym, `Broken As Designed']    Said of
a program that is {bogus} because of bad design and    misfeatures
rather than because of bugginess.  See {working as    designed}.

   :Bad and Wrong: adj.  [Durham, UK] Said of something that    is both
badly designed and wrongly executed. This common term is    the
prototype of, and is used by contrast with, three less common    terms
- Bad and Right (a kludge, something ugly but functional);    Good and
Wrong (an overblown GUI or other attractive nuisance); and    (rare
praise) Good and Right.  These terms entered common use at    Durham
c.1994 and may have been imported from elsewhere.  There are
standard abbreviations: they start with B&R, a typo for "Bad and
Wrong".  Consequently, B&W is actually "Bad and Right", G&R =    "Good
and Wrong", and G&W = "Good and Right". Compare    {evil and rude},
{Good Thing}, {Bad Thing}.

   :Bad Thing: n.  [very common; from the 1930 Sellar &    Yeatman
parody "1066 And All That"] Something that can't    possibly result in
improvement of the subject.  This term is always    capitalized, as in
"Replacing all of the 9600-baud modems with    bicycle couriers would
be a Bad Thing".  Oppose {Good Thing}.     British correspondents
confirm that {Bad Thing} and {Good    Thing} (and prob. therefore
{Right Thing} and {Wrong    Thing}) come from the book referenced in
the etymology, which    discusses rulers who were Good Kings but Bad
Things.  This has    apparently created a mainstream idiom on the
British side of the    pond.  It is very common among American hackers,
but not in    mainstream usage here. Compare {Bad and Wrong}.

   :bag on the side: n.  [prob. originally related to a    colostomy
bag] An extension to an established hack that    is supposed to add
some functionality to the original.  Usually    derogatory, implying
that the original was being overextended and    should have been thrown
away, and the new product is ugly,    inelegant, or bloated.  Also v.
phrase, `to hang a bag on the side    [of]'.  "C++?  That's just a bag
on the side of C ...."     "They want me to hang a bag on the side of
the accounting    system."

   :bagbiter: /bag'bi:t-*r/ n.  1. Something, such as a    program or a
computer, that fails to work, or works in a remarkably    clumsy
manner.  "This text editor won't let me make a file with a    line
longer than 80 characters!  What a bagbiter!"  2. A person    who has
caused you some trouble, inadvertently or otherwise,    typically by
failing to program the computer properly.  Synonyms:    {loser},
{cretin}, {chomper}.  3. `bite the bag' vi.     To fail in some manner.
"The computer keeps crashing every five    minutes."  "Yes, the disk
controller is really biting the bag."

   The original loading of these terms was almost undoubtedly obscene,
 possibly referring to a douche bag or the scrotum (we have reports
of "Bite the douche bag!" being used as an insult at MIT    1970-1976),
but in their current usage they have become almost    completely
sanitized.

   ITS's {lexiphage} program was the first and to date only known
example of a program _intended_ to be a bagbiter.

   :bagbiting: adj.  Having the quality of a {bagbiter}.     "This
bagbiting system won't let me compute the factorial of a    negative
number."  Compare {losing}, {cretinous},    {bletcherous}, `barfucious'
(under {barfulous}) and    `chomping' (under {chomp}).

   :balloonian variable: n.  [Commodore users; perh. a deliberate
phonetic mangling of `boolean variable'?] Any variable that    doesn't
actually hold or control state, but must nevertheless be    declared,
checked, or set.  A typical balloonian variable started    out as a
flag attached to some environment feature that either    became
obsolete or was planned but never implemented.     Compatibility
concerns (or politics attached to same) may require    that such a flag
be treated as though it were {live}.

   :bamf: /bamf/  1. [from X-Men comics; originally "bampf"]    interj.
Notional sound made by a person or object teleporting in or    out of
the hearer's vicinity.  Often used in {virtual reality}    (esp. {MUD})
electronic {fora} when a character wishes to    make a dramatic
entrance or exit.  2. The sound of magical    transformation, used in
virtual reality {fora} like MUDs. 3. In    MUD circles, "bamf" is also
used to refer to the act by which a    MUD server sends a special
notification to the MUD client to switch    its connection to another
server ("I'll set up the old site to    just bamf people over to our
new location.").  4. Used by MUDders    on occasion in a more general
sense related to sense 3, to refer to    directing someone to another
location or resource ("A user was    asking about some technobabble so
I bamfed them to    `http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon/'".)

   :banana label: n.  The labels often used on the sides of
{macrotape} reels, so called because they are shaped roughly    like
blunt-ended bananas.  This term, like macrotapes themselves,    is
still current but visibly headed for obsolescence.

   :banana problem: n.  [from the story of the little girl who    said
"I know how to spell `banana', but I don't know when to    stop"].  Not
knowing where or when to bring a production to a    close (compare
{fencepost error}).  One may say `there is a    banana problem' of an
algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect    termination conditions,
or in discussing the evolution of a design    that may be succumbing to
featuritis (see also {creeping    elegance}, {creeping featuritis}).
See item 176 under    {HAKMEM}, which describes a banana problem in a
{Dissociated    Press} implementation.  Also, see {one-banana problem}
for a    superficially similar but unrelated usage.

   :binary four: n.  [Usenet] The finger, in the sense of    `digitus
impudicus'.  This comes from an analogy between binary    and the hand,
i.e. 1=00001=thumb, 2=00010=index finger,    3=00011=index and thumb,
4=00100.  Considered silly.  Prob. from    humorous derivative of
{finger}, sense 4.

   :bandwidth: n.  1. [common] Used by hackers (in a    generalization
of its technical meaning) as the volume of    information per unit time
that a computer, person, or transmission    medium can handle.  "Those
are amazing graphics, but I missed some    of the detail -- not enough
bandwidth, I guess."  Compare    {low-bandwidth}.  This generalized
usage began to go mainstream    after the Internet population explosion
of 1993-1994.  2. Attention    span.  3. On {Usenet}, a measure of
network capacity that is    often wasted by people complaining about
how items posted by others    are a waste of bandwidth.

   :bang:  1. n. Common spoken name for `!' (ASCII 0100001),
especially when used in pronouncing a {bang path} in spoken    hackish.
In {elder days} this was considered a CMUish usage,    with MIT and
Stanford hackers preferring {excl} or {shriek};    but the spread of
Unix has carried `bang' with it (esp. via the    term {bang path}) and
it is now certainly the most common spoken    name for `!'.  Note that
it is used exclusively for    non-emphatic written `!'; one would not
say "Congratulations    bang" (except possibly for humorous purposes),
but if one wanted    to specify the exact characters `foo!' one would
speak "Eff oh oh    bang".  See {shriek}, {{ASCII}}.  2. interj. An
exclamation    signifying roughly "I have achieved enlightenment!", or
"The    dynamite has cleared out my brain!"  Often used to acknowledge
 that one has perpetrated a {thinko} immediately after one has    been
called on it.

   :bang on: vt.  To stress-test a piece of hardware or software:    "I
banged on the new version of the simulator all day yesterday    and it
didn't crash once.  I guess it is ready for release."  The    term
{pound on} is synonymous.

   :bang path: n.  [now historical] An old-style UUCP
electronic-mail address specifying hops to get from some
assumed-reachable location to the addressee, so called because each
{hop} is signified by a {bang} sign.  Thus, for example, the    path
...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me directs people to route their    mail to
machine bigsite (presumably a well-known location    accessible to
everybody) and from there through the machine    foovax to the account
of user me on barbox.

   In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers
became commonplace, people often published compound bang addresses
using the { } convention (see {glob}) to give paths from    _several_
big machines, in the hopes that one's correspondent    might be able to
get mail to one of them reliably (example:    ...!{seismo, ut-sally,
ihnp4}!rice!beta!gamma!me).  Bang paths    of 8 to 10 hops were not
uncommon in 1981.  Late-night dial-up    UUCP links would cause
week-long transmission times.  Bang paths    were often selected by
both transmission time and reliability, as    messages would often get
lost.  See {{Internet address}},    {the network}, and {sitename}.

   :banner: n.  1. The title page added to printouts by most    print
spoolers (see {spool}).  Typically includes user or    account ID
information in very large character-graphics capitals.     Also called
a `burst page', because it indicates where to burst    (tear apart)
fanfold paper to separate one user's printout from the    next.  2. A
similar printout generated (typically on multiple pages    of fan-fold
paper) from user-specified text, e.g., by a program    such as Unix's
`banner({1,6})'.  3. On interactive software,    a first screen
containing a logo and/or author credits and/or a    copyright notice.
This is probably now the commonest sense.

   :banner ad: n.  Any of the annoying graphical    advertisements that
span the tops of way too many Web    pages.

   :bar: /bar/ n.  1. [very common] The second    {metasyntactic
variable}, after {foo} and before {baz}.     "Suppose we have two
functions: FOO and BAR.  FOO calls    BAR...." 2. Often appended to
{foo} to produce    {foobar}.

   :bare metal: n.  1. [common] New computer hardware,    unadorned
with such snares and delusions as an {operating    system}, an {HLL},
or even assembler.  Commonly used in the    phrase `programming on the
bare metal', which refers to the    arduous work of {bit bashing}
needed to create these basic tools    for a new machine.  Real
bare-metal programming involves things    like building boot proms and
BIOS chips, implementing basic    monitors used to test device drivers,
and writing the assemblers    that will be used to write the compiler
back ends that will give    the new machine a real development
environment.  2. `Programming on    the bare metal' is also used to
describe a style of    {hand-hacking} that relies on bit-level
peculiarities of a    particular hardware design, esp. tricks for speed
and space    optimization that rely on crocks such as overlapping
instructions    (or, as in the famous case described in {The Story of
Mel} (in    Appendix A), interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to
minimize    fetch delays due to the device's rotational latency).  This
sort of    thing has become less common as the relative costs of
programming    time and machine resources have changed, but is still
found in    heavily constrained environments such as industrial embedded
  systems, and in the code of hackers who just can't let go of that
low-level control.  See {Real Programmer}.

   In the world of personal computing, bare metal programming
(especially in sense 1 but sometimes also in sense 2) is often
considered a {Good Thing}, or at least a necessary evil    (because
these machines have often been sufficiently slow and    poorly designed
to make it necessary; see {ill-behaved}).     There, the term usually
refers to bypassing the BIOS or OS    interface and writing the
application to directly access device    registers and machine
addresses.  "To get 19.2 kilobaud on the    serial port, you need to
get down to the bare metal."  People who    can do this sort of thing
well are held in high regard.

   :barf: /barf/ n.,v.  [common; from mainstream slang    meaning
`vomit'] 1. interj.  Term of disgust.  This is the    closest hackish
equivalent of the Valspeak "gag me with a    spoon". (Like, euwww!)
See {bletch}.  2. vi. To say    "Barf!" or emit some similar expression
of disgust.  "I showed    him my latest hack and he barfed" means only
that he complained    about it, not that he literally vomited.  3. vi.
To fail to    work because of unacceptable input, perhaps with a
suitable error    message, perhaps not.  Examples: "The division
operation barfs if    you try to divide by 0."  (That is, the division
operation checks    for an attempt to divide by zero, and if one is
encountered it    causes the operation to fail in some unspecified, but
generally    obvious, manner.) "The text editor barfs if you try to
read in a    new file before writing out the old one."  See {choke},
{gag}.  In Commonwealth Hackish, `barf' is generally replaced    by
`puke' or `vom'.  {barf} is sometimes also used as a    {metasyntactic
variable}, like {foo} or {bar}.

   :barfmail: n.  Multiple {bounce message}s accumulating to    the
level of serious annoyance, or worse.  The sort of thing that
happens when an inter-network mail gateway goes down or wonky.

   :barfulation: /bar`fyoo-lay'sh*n/ interj.  Variation of    {barf}
used around the Stanford area.  An exclamation,    expressing disgust.
On seeing some particularly bad code one might    exclaim,
"Barfulation!  Who wrote this, Quux?"

   :barfulous: /bar'fyoo-l*s/ adj.  (alt. `barfucious',
/bar-fyoo-sh*s/) Said of something that would make anyone    barf, if
only for esthetic reasons.

   :barn: n.  [uncommon; prob. from the nuclear military] An
unexpectedly large quantity of something: a unit of measurement.
"Why is /var/adm taking up so much space?"  "The logs have grown    to
several barns."  The source of this is clear: when physicists    were
first studying nuclear interactions, the probability was    thought to
be proportional to the cross-sectional area of the    nucleus (this
probability is still called the cross-section).  Upon    experimenting,
they discovered the interactions were far more    probable than
expected; the nuclei were `as big as a barn'.  The    units for
cross-sections were christened Barns, (10^-24 cm^2) and    the book
containing cross-sections has a picture    of a barn on the cover.

   :barney: n.  In Commonwealth hackish, `barney' is to    {fred}
(sense #1) as {bar} is to {foo}.  That is, people    who commonly use
`fred' as their first metasyntactic variable    will often use `barney'
second.  The reference is, of course, to    Fred Flintstone and Barney
Rubble in the Flintstones cartoons.

   :baroque: adj.  [common] Feature-encrusted; complex;    gaudy;
verging on excessive.  Said of hardware or (esp.) software    designs,
this has many of the connotations of {elephantine} or    {monstrosity}
but is less extreme and not pejorative in itself.     "Metafont even
has features to introduce random variations to its    letterform
output.  Now _that_ is baroque!"  See also    {rococo}.

   :BASIC: /bay'-sic/ n.  A programming language,    originally
designed for Dartmouth's experimental timesharing system    in the
early 1960s, which for many years was the leading cause of    brain
damage in proto-hackers.  Edsger W. Dijkstra observed in    "Selected
Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective" that    "It is
practically impossible to teach good programming style to    students
that have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential    programmers they
are mentally mutilated beyond hope of    regeneration."  This is
another case (like {Pascal}) of the    cascading {lossage} that happens
when a language deliberately    designed as an educational toy gets
taken too seriously.  A novice    can write short BASIC programs (on
the order of 10-20 lines) very    easily; writing anything longer (a)
is very painful, and (b)    encourages bad habits that will make it
harder to use more powerful    languages well.  This wouldn't be so bad
if historical accidents    hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end
micros in the 1980s.  As it    is, it probably ruined tens of thousands
of potential wizards.

   [1995: Some languages called `BASIC' aren't quite this nasty any
more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control
structures and shed their line numbers. --ESR]

   Note: the name is commonly parsed as Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic
  Instruction Code, but this is a {backronym}. BASIC was    originally
named Basic, simply because it was a simple and basic    programming
language.  Because most programming language names were    in fact
acronyms, BASIC was often capitalized just out of habit or    to be
silly.  No acronym for BASIC originally existed or was    intended (as
one can verify by reading texts through the early    1970s). Later,
around the mid-1970s, people began to make up    backronyms for BASIC
because they weren't sure.  Beginner's    All-purpose Symbolic
Instruction Code is the one that caught    on.

   :batbelt: n.  Many hackers routinely hang numerous devices    such
as pagers, cell-phones, personal organizers, leatherman    multitools,
pocket knives, flashlights, walkie-talkies, even    miniature computers
from their belts. When many of these devices    are worn at once, the
hacker's belt somewhat resembles Batman's    utility belt; hence it is
referred to as a batbelt.

   :batch: adj.  1. Non-interactive.  Hackers use this somewhat    more
loosely than the traditional technical definitions justify; in
particular, switches on a normally interactive program that prepare
it to receive non-interactive command input are often referred to    as
`batch mode' switches.  A `batch file' is a series of    instructions
written to be handed to an interactive program running    in batch
mode.  2. Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting.     "I
finally sat down in batch mode and wrote out checks for all    those
bills; I guess they'll turn the electricity back on next    week..." 3.
`batching up': Accumulation of a number of small    tasks that can be
lumped together for greater efficiency.  "I'm    batching up those
letters to send sometime" "I'm batching up    bottles to take to the
recycling center."

   :bathtub curve: n.  Common term for the curve (resembling an
end-to-end section of one of those claw-footed antique bathtubs)
that describes the expected failure rate of electronics with time:
initially high, dropping to near 0 for most of the system's
lifetime, then rising again as it `tires out'.  See also    {burn-in
period}, {infant mortality}.

   :baud: /bawd/ n.  [simplified from its technical meaning]    n. Bits
per second.  Hence kilobaud or Kbaud, thousands of bits per    second.
The technical meaning is `level transitions per    second'; this
coincides with bps only for two-level modulation with    no framing or
stop bits.  Most hackers are aware of these nuances    but blithely
ignore them.

   Historical note: `baud' was originally a unit of telegraph
signalling speed, set at one pulse per second.  It was proposed at
the International Telegraph Conference of 1927, and named after
J.M.E.  Baudot (1845-1903), the French engineer who constructed    the
first successful teleprinter.

   :baud barf: /bawd barf/ n.  The garbage one gets on the    monitor
when using a modem connection with some protocol setting    (esp. line
speed) incorrect, or when someone picks up a voice    extension on the
same line, or when really bad line noise disrupts    the connection.
Baud barf is not completely {random}, by the    way; hackers with a lot
of serial-line experience can usually tell    whether the device at the
other end is expecting a higher or lower    speed than the terminal is
set to.  _Really_ experienced ones    can identify particular speeds.

   :baz: /baz/ n.  1. [common] The third {metasyntactic    variable}
"Suppose we have three functions: FOO, BAR, and BAZ.     FOO calls BAR,
which calls BAZ...." (See also {fum})    2. interj. A term of mild
annoyance.  In this usage the term is    often drawn out for 2 or 3
seconds, producing an effect not unlike    the bleating of a sheep;
/baaaaaaz/.  3. Occasionally appended to    {foo} to produce `foobaz'.

   Earlier versions of this lexicon derived `baz' as a Stanford
corruption of {bar}.  However, Pete Samson (compiler of the    {TMRC}
lexicon) reports it was already current when he joined TMRC    in 1958.
He says "It came from "Pogo".  Albert the Alligator,    when vexed or
outraged, would shout `Bazz Fazz!' or `Rowrbazzle!'     The club layout
was said to model the (mythical) New England    counties of Rowrfolk
and Bassex (Rowrbazzle mingled with
(Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex)."

   :bazaar: n.,adj.  In 1997, after contemplating the success    of
{Linux} for three years, the Jargon File's own editor ESR    wrote an
analytical paper on hacker culture and development models    titled The
Cathedral and the Bazaar
(http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/).  The main
argument of the paper was    that {Brooks's Law} ia not the whole
story; given the right    social machinery, debugging can be
efficiently parallelized across    large numbers of programmers.  The
title metaphor caught on (see    also {cathedral}), and the style of
development typical in the    Linux community is now often referred to
as the bazaar mode.  Its    characteristics include releasing code
early and often, and    actively seeking the largest possible pool of
peer reviewers.

   :bboard: /bee'bord/ n.  [contraction of `bulletin board']    1. Any
electronic bulletin board; esp. used of {BBS} systems    running on
personal micros, less frequently of a Usenet    {newsgroup} (in fact,
use of this term for a newsgroup generally    marks one either as a
{newbie} fresh in from the BBS world or as    a real old-timer
predating Usenet).  2. At CMU and other colleges    with similar
facilities, refers to campus-wide electronic bulletin    boards.  3.
The term `physical bboard' is sometimes used to refer    to an
old-fashioned, non-electronic cork-and-thumbtack memo board.     At
CMU, it refers to a particular one outside the CS Lounge.

   In either of senses 1 or 2, the term is usually prefixed by the
name of the intended board (`the Moonlight Casino bboard' or    `market
bboard'); however, if the context is clear, the better-read    bboards
may be referred to by name alone, as in (at CMU) "Don't    post
for-sale ads on general".

   :BBS: /B-B-S/ n.  [common; abbreviation, `Bulletin Board    System']
An electronic bulletin board system; that is, a message    database
where people can log in and leave broadcast messages for    others
grouped (typically) into {topic group}s.  The term was    especially
applied tto the thousands of local BBS systems that    operated during
the pre-Internet microcomputer era of roughly 1980    to 1995.,
typically run by amateurs for fun out of their homes on    MS-DOS boxes
with a single modem line each.  Fans of Usenet and    Internet or the
big commercial timesharing bboards such as    CompuServe and GEnie
tended to consider local BBSes the low-rent    district of the hacker
culture, but they served a valuable function    by knitting together
lots of hackers and users in the    personal-micro world who would
otherwise have been unable to    exchange code at all.  Post-Internet,
BBSs are likely to be local    newsgroups on an ISP; efficiency has
increased but a certain flavor    has been lost.  See also {bboard}.

   :BCPL: // n.  [abbreviation, `Basic Combined Programming
Language') A programming language developed by Martin Richards in
Cambridge in 1967. It is remarkable for its rich syntax, small size
of compiler (it can be run in 16k) and extreme portability. It
reached break-even point at a very early stage, and was the    language
in which the original {hello world} program was    written. It has been
ported to so many different systems that its    creator confesses to
having lost count. It has only one data type    (a machine word) which
can be used as an integer, a character, a    floating point number, a
pointer, or almost anything else,    depending on context.  BCPL was a
precursor of C, which inherited    some of its features.

   :beam: vt.  [from Star Trek Classic's "Beam me up,    Scotty!"]  1.
To transfer {softcopy} of a file electronically;    most often in
combining forms such as `beam me a copy' or `beam    that over to his
site'.  2. Palm Pilot users very commonly use this    term for the act
of exchanging bits via the infrared links on their    machines (this
term seams to have originated with the ill-fated    Newton Message
Pad).  Compare {blast}, {snarf}, {BLT}.

   :beanie key: n.  [Mac users] See {command key}.

   :beep: n.,v.  Syn. {feep}.  This term is techspeak under    MS-DOS
and OS/2, and seems to be generally preferred among micro    hobbyists.

   :Befunge: n.  A worthy companion to {INTERCAL}; a    computer
language family which escapes the quotidian limitation of linear
control flow and embraces program counters flying through multiple
dimensions with exotic topologies. For details, see the Befunge    home
page at `http://www.cats-eye.com/cet/soft/lang/befunge/'.

   :beige toaster: n.  A Macintosh. See {toaster}; compare
{Macintrash}, {maggotbox}.

   :bells and whistles: n.  [common] Features added to a    program or
system to make it more {flavorful} from a hacker's    point of view,
without necessarily adding to its utility for its    primary function.
Distinguished from {chrome}, which is    intended to attract users.
"Now that we've got the basic program    working, let's go back and add
some bells and whistles."  No one    seems to know what distinguishes a
bell from a whistle.  The    recognized emphatic form is "bells,
whistles, and gongs".

   It used to be thought that this term derived from the toyboxes on
theater organs.  However, the "and gongs" strongly suggests a
different origin, at sea.  Before powered horns, ships routinely
used bells, whistles, and gongs to signal each other over longer
distances than voice can carry.

   :bells whistles and gongs: n.  A standard elaborated form of
{bells and whistles}; typically said with a pronounced and    ironic
accent on the `gongs'.

   :benchmark: n.  [techspeak] An inaccurate measure of computer
performance.  "In the computer industry, there are three kinds of
lies: lies, damn lies, and benchmarks."  Well-known ones include
Whetstone, Dhrystone, Rhealstone (see {h}), the Gabriel LISP
benchmarks (see {gabriel}), the SPECmark suite, and LINPACK.     See
also {machoflops}, {MIPS}, {smoke and mirrors}.

   :Berkeley Quality Software: adj.  (often abbreviated `BQS')    Term
used in a pejorative sense to refer to software that was    apparently
created by rather spaced-out hackers late at night to    solve some
unique problem.  It usually has nonexistent, incomplete,    or
incorrect documentation, has been tested on at least two    examples,
and core dumps when anyone else attempts to use it.  This    term was
frequently applied to early versions of the `dbx(1)'    debugger.  See
also {Berzerkeley}.

   Note to British and Commonwealth readers: that's /berk'lee/, not
/bark'lee/ as in British Received Pronunciation.

   :berklix: /berk'liks/ n.,adj.  [contraction of `Berkeley    Unix']
See {BSD}.  Not used at Berkeley itself.  May be more    common among
{suit}s attempting to sound like cognoscenti than    among hackers, who
usually just say `BSD'.

   :Berzerkeley: /b*r-zer'klee/ n.  [from `berserk', via    the name of
a now-deceased record label; poss. originated by famed    columnist
Herb Caen] Humorous distortion of `Berkeley' used esp.     to refer to
the practices or products of the {BSD} Unix hackers.     See {software
bloat}, {Missed'em-five}, {Berkeley Quality    Software}.

   Mainstream use of this term in reference to the cultural and
political peculiarities of UC Berkeley as a whole has been reported
from as far back as the 1960s.

   :beta: /bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n.     1. Mostly
working, but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in    beta'.  In
the {Real World}, systems (hardware or software)    software often go
through two stages of release testing: Alpha    (in-house) and Beta
(out-house?).  Beta releases are generally made    to a group of lucky
(or unlucky) trusted customers.     2. Anything that is new and
experimental.  "His girlfriend is in    beta" means that he is still
testing for compatibility and    reserving judgment.  3. Flaky;
dubious; suspect (since beta    software is notoriously buggy).

   Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a
pre-release (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software
by making it available to selected (or self-selected) customers and
users.  This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product
cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout
the industry.  `Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or component test
phase; `Beta Test' was initial system test.  These themselves came
from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware.  The A-test was a
feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any
commitment to design and development.  The B-test was a
demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.
The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed
on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C
test repeated after the model had been in production a while.

   :BFI: /B-F-I/ n.  See {brute force and ignorance}.  Also
encountered in the variants `BFMI', `brute force and    _massive_
ignorance' and `BFBI' `brute force and bloody    ignorance'.

   :bible: n.  1. One of a small number of fundamental source    books
such as {Knuth} and {K&R}.  2. The most detailed and    authoritative
reference for a particular language, operating    system, or other
complex software system.

   :BiCapitalization: n.  The act said to have been performed on
trademarks (such as {PostScript}, NeXT, {NeWS}, VisiCalc,
FrameMaker, TK!solver, EasyWriter) that have been raised above the
ruck of common coinage by nonstandard capitalization.  Too many
{marketroid} types think this sort of thing is really cute, even    the
2,317th time they do it.  Compare {studlycaps}.

   :B1FF: /bif/ [Usenet] (alt. `BIFF') n.  The most famous    {pseudo},
and the prototypical {newbie}.  Articles from B1FF    feature all
uppercase letters sprinkled liberally with bangs,    typos, `cute'
misspellings (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD BIFF CUZ    HE"S A K00L DOOD AN
HE RITES REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN CAPITULL LETTRS    LIKE THIS!!!), use
(and often misuse) of fragments of {talk mode}    abbreviations, a long
{sig block} (sometimes even a {doubled    sig}), and unbounded naivete.
B1FF posts articles using his    elder brother's VIC-20.  B1FF's
location is a mystery, as his    articles appear to come from a variety
of sites.  However,    {BITNET} seems to be the most frequent origin.
The theory that    B1FF is a denizen of BITNET is supported by B1FF's
(unfortunately    invalid) electronic mail address: B1FF@BIT.NET.

   [1993: Now It Can Be Told!  My spies inform me that B1FF was
originally created by Joe Talmadge <jat@cup.hp.com>, also the    author
of the infamous and much-plagiarized "Flamer's Bible".     The BIFF
filter he wrote was later passed to Richard Sexton, who    posted
BIFFisms much more widely.  Versions have since been posted    for the
amusement of the net at large. --ESR]

   :BI: //  Common written abbreviation for {Breidbart    Index}.

   :biff: /bif/ vt.  To notify someone of incoming mail.  From    the
BSD utility `biff(1)', which was in turn named after a    friendly dog
who used to chase frisbees in the halls at    UCB while 4.2BSD was in
development.  There was a legend that it    had a habit of barking
whenever the mailman came, but the author of    `biff' says this is not
true.  No relation to {B1FF}.

   :Big Gray Wall: n.  What faces a {VMS} user searching for
documentation.  A full VMS kit comes on a pallet, the documentation
taking up around 15 feet of shelf space before the addition of
layered products such as compilers, databases, multivendor
networking, and programming tools.  Recent (since VMS version 5)
documentation comes with gray binders; under VMS version 4 the
binders were orange (`big orange wall'), and under version 3 they
were blue.  See {VMS}.  Often contracted to `Gray Wall'.

   :big iron: n.  [common] Large, expensive, ultra-fast    computers.
Used generally of {number-crunching} supercomputers    such as Crays,
but can include more conventional big commercial    IBMish mainframes.
Term of approval; compare {heavy metal},    oppose {dinosaur}.

   :Big Red Switch: n.  [IBM] The power switch on a computer,    esp.
the `Emergency Pull' switch on an IBM {mainframe} or the    power
switch on an IBM PC where it really is large and red.  "This    !@%$%
{bitty box} is hung again; time to hit the Big Red    Switch."  Sources
at IBM report that, in tune with the company's    passion for {TLA}s,
this is often abbreviated as `BRS' (this    has also become established
on FidoNet and in the PC {clone}    world).  It is alleged that the
emergency pull switch on an IBM    360/91 actually fired a
non-conducting bolt into the main power    feed; the BRSes on more
recent mainframes physically drop a block    into place so that they
can't be pushed back in.  People get fired    for pulling them,
especially inappropriately (see also    {molly-guard}).  Compare {power
cycle}, {three-finger    salute}, {120 reset}; see also {scram switch}.

   :Big Room: n.  (Also `Big Blue Room') The extremely    large room
with the blue ceiling and intensely bright light (during    the day) or
black ceiling with lots of tiny night-lights (during    the night)
found outside all computer installations.  "He can't    come to the
phone right now, he's somewhere out in the Big Room."

   :big win: n.  1. [common] Major success.  2. [MIT]    Serendipity.
"Yes, those two physicists discovered    high-temperature
superconductivity in a batch of ceramic that had    been prepared
incorrectly according to their experimental schedule.     Small
mistake; big win!" See {win big}.

   :big-endian: adj.  [common; From Swift's "Gulliver's    Travels" via
the famous paper "On Holy Wars and a Plea for    Peace" by Danny Cohen,
USC/ISI IEN 137, dated April 1, 1980]    1. Describes a computer
architecture in which, within a given    multi-byte numeric
representation, the most significant byte has    the lowest address
(the word is stored `big-end-first').  Most    processors, including
the IBM 370 family, the {PDP-10}, the    Motorola microprocessor
families, and most of the various RISC    designs are big-endian.
Big-endian byte order is also sometimes    called `network order'. See
{little-endian},    {middle-endian}, {NUXI problem}, {swab}.  2. An
{{Internet address}} the wrong way round.  Most of the world    follows
the Internet standard and writes email addresses starting    with the
name of the computer and ending up with the name of the    country.  In
the U.K. the Joint Networking Team had decided to do    it the other
way round before the Internet domain standard was    established.  Most
gateway sites have {ad-hockery} in their    mailers to handle this, but
can still be confused.  In particular,    the address
me@uk.ac.bris.pys.as could be interpreted in    JANET's big-endian way
as one in the U.K. (domain uk) or in the    standard little-endian way
as one in the domain as (American    Samoa) on the opposite side of the
world.

   :bignum: /big'nuhm/ n.  [common; orig. from MIT MacLISP]    1.
[techspeak] A multiple-precision computer representation for    very
large integers.  2. More generally, any very large number.     "Have
you ever looked at the United States Budget?  There's    bignums for
you!"  3. [Stanford] In backgammon, large numbers on    the dice
especially a roll of double fives or double sixes (compare    {moby},
sense 4).  See also {El Camino Bignum}.

   Sense 1 may require some explanation.  Most computer languages
provide a kind of data called `integer', but such computer    integers
are usually very limited in size; usually they must be    smaller than
2^(31) (2,147,483,648) or (on a    {bitty box}) 2^(15) (32,768).  If
you want to work    with numbers larger than that, you have to use
floating-point    numbers, which are usually accurate to only six or
seven decimal    places.  Computer languages that provide bignums can
perform exact    calculations on very large numbers, such as 1000! (the
factorial    of 1000, which is 1000 times 999 times 998 times ... times
2    times 1).  For example, this value for 1000!  was computed by the
 MacLISP system using bignums:

   :bigot: n.  [common] A person who is religiously attached to a
particular computer, language, operating system, editor, or other
tool (see {religious issues}).  Usually found with a specifier;
thus, `cray bigot', `ITS bigot', `APL bigot', `VMS bigot',    `Berkeley
bigot'.  Real bigots can be distinguished from mere    partisans or
zealots by the fact that they refuse to learn    alternatives even when
the march of time and/or technology is    threatening to obsolete the
favored tool.  It is truly said "You    can tell a bigot, but you can't
tell him much."  Compare    {weenie}, {Amiga Persecution Complex}.

   :bit: n.  [from the mainstream meaning and `Binary digIT']    1.
[techspeak] The unit of information; the amount of information
obtained by asking a yes-or-no question for which the two outcomes
are equally probable.  2. [techspeak] A computational quantity that
can take on one of two values, such as true and false or 0 and 1.
3. A mental flag: a reminder that something should be done
eventually.  "I have a bit set for you."  (I haven't seen you for    a
while, and I'm supposed to tell or ask you something.)  4. More
generally, a (possibly incorrect) mental state of belief.  "I have    a
bit set that says that you were the last guy to hack on EMACS."
(Meaning "I think you were the last guy to hack on EMACS, and what    I
am about to say is predicated on this, so please stop me if this
isn't true.")

   "I just need one bit from you" is a polite way of indicating that
you intend only a short interruption for a question that can
presumably be answered yes or no.

   A bit is said to be `set' if its value is true or 1, and    `reset'
or `clear' if its value is false or 0.  One speaks of    setting and
clearing bits.  To {toggle} or `invert' a bit is    to change it,
either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.  See also    {flag}, {trit}, {mode
bit}.

   The term `bit' first appeared in print in the computer-science
sense in 1949, and seems to have been coined by early computer
scientist John Tukey.  Tukey records that it evolved over a lunch
table as a handier alternative to `bigit' or `binit'.

   :bit bang: n.  Transmission of data on a serial line, when
accomplished by rapidly tweaking a single output bit, in software,
at the appropriate times.  The technique is a simple loop with    eight
OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for each byte.  Input is more
interesting.  And full duplex (doing input and output at the same
time) is one way to separate the real hackers from the    {wannabee}s.

   Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers,
presumably when UARTs were too expensive, and on archaic Z80 micros
with a Zilog PIO but no SIO.  In an interesting instance of the
{cycle of reincarnation}, this technique returned to use in the
early 1990s on some RISC architectures because it consumes such    an
infinitesimal part of the processor that it actually makes sense    not
to have a UART.  Compare {cycle of reincarnation}.

   :bit bashing: n.  (alt. `bit diddling' or {bit    twiddling}) Term
used to describe any of several kinds of low-level    programming
characterized by manipulation of {bit}, {flag},    {nybble}, and other
smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data;    these include low-level
device control, encryption algorithms,    checksum and error-correcting
codes, hash functions, some flavors    of graphics programming (see
{bitblt}), and assembler/compiler    code generation.  May connote
either tedium or a real technical    challenge (more usually the
former).  "The command decoding for    the new tape driver looks pretty
solid but the bit-bashing for the    control registers still has bugs."
See also {bit bang},    {mode bit}.

   :bit bucket: n.  [very common] 1. The universal data sink
(originally, the mythical receptacle used to catch bits when they
fall off the end of a register during a shift instruction).
Discarded, lost, or destroyed data is said to have `gone to the    bit
bucket'.  On {{Unix}}, often used for {/dev/null}.     Sometimes
amplified as `the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky'.  2. The    place where
all lost mail and news messages eventually go.  The    selection is
performed according to {Finagle's Law}; important    mail is much more
likely to end up in the bit bucket than junk    mail, which has an
almost 100% probability of getting delivered.     Routing to the bit
bucket is automatically performed by    mail-transfer agents, news
systems, and the lower layers of the    network.  3. The ideal location
for all unwanted mail responses:    "Flames about this article to the
bit bucket."  Such a request is    guaranteed to overflow one's mailbox
with flames.  4. Excuse for    all mail that has not been sent.  "I
mailed you those figures last    week; they must have landed in the bit
bucket."  Compare {black    hole}.

   This term is used purely in jest.  It is based on the fanciful
notion that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only
misplaced.  This appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term
`bit box', about which the same legend was current; old-time    hackers
also report that trainees used to be told that when the CPU    stored
bits into memory it was actually pulling them `out of the    bit box'.
See also {chad box}.

   Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the
 `parity preservation law', the number of 1 bits that go to the bit
bucket must equal the number of 0 bits.  Any imbalance results in
bits filling up the bit bucket.  A qualified computer technician    can
empty a full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.

   :bit decay: n.  See {bit rot}.  People with a physics    background
tend to prefer this variant for the analogy with    particle decay.
See also {computron}, {quantum    bogodynamics}.

   :bit rot: n.  [common] Also {bit decay}.  Hypothetical    disease
the existence of which has been deduced from the    observation that
unused programs or features will often stop    working after sufficient
time has passed, even if `nothing has    changed'.  The theory explains
that bits decay as if they were    radioactive.  As time passes, the
contents of a file or the code in    a program will become increasingly
garbled.

   There actually are physical processes that produce such effects
(alpha particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip
packages, for example, can change the contents of a computer memory
unpredictably, and various kinds of subtle media failures can
corrupt files in mass storage), but they are quite rare (and
computers are built with error-detecting circuitry to compensate    for
them).  The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic    rays are
among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth;    see the
{cosmic rays} entry for details.

   The term {software rot} is almost synonymous.  Software rot is
the effect, bit rot the notional cause.

   :bit twiddling: n.  [very common] 1. (pejorative) An    exercise in
tuning (see {tune}) in which incredible amounts of    time and effort
go to produce little noticeable improvement, often    with the result
that the code becomes incomprehensible.  2. Aimless    small
modification to a program, esp. for some pointless goal.     3. Approx.
syn. for {bit bashing}; esp. used for the act of    frobbing the device
control register of a peripheral in an attempt    to get it back to a
known state.

   :bit-paired keyboard: n.,obs.  (alt. `bit-shift    keyboard') A
non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have    originated with the
Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several    years on early
computer equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical    device (see {EOU}),
so the only way to generate the character    codes from keystrokes was
by some physical linkage.  The design of    the ASR-33 assigned each
character key a basic pattern that could    be modified by flipping
bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was    pressed.  In order to avoid
making the thing even more of a kluge    than it already was, the
design had to group characters that shared    the same basic bit
pattern on one key.

   Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:

     high  low bits
     bits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
      010        !    "    #    $    %    &    '    (    )
      011   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9

This is why the characters !"#$%&'() appear where they do on a
Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space).  This was
_not_ the weirdest variant of the {QWERTY} layout widely    seen, by
the way; that prize should probably go to one of several    (differing)
arrangements on IBM's even clunkier 026 and 029 card    punches.

   When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there
 was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be
laid out.  Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard,
while others used the flexibility of electronic circuitry to make
their product look like an office typewriter.  These alternatives
became known as `bit-paired' and `typewriter-paired' keyboards.  To
a hacker, the bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical -- and
because most hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type,
there was little pressure from the pioneering users to adapt
keyboards to the typewriter standard.

   The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale
introduction of the computer terminal into the normal office
environment, where out-and-out technophobes were expected to use    the
equipment.  The `typewriter-paired' standard became universal,
`bit-paired' hardware was quickly junked or relegated to dusty
corners, and both terms passed into disuse.

   However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or
nonexistent. As a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on
PC's, Unix boxen etc. still has all of the !"#$%&'() characters
above the numbers in the ASR-33 layout.

   :bitblt: /bit'blit/ n.  [from {BLT}, q.v.]     1. [common] Any of a
family of closely related algorithms for    moving and copying
rectangles of bits between main and display    memory on a bit-mapped
device, or between two areas of either main    or display memory (the
requirement to do the {Right Thing} in    the case of overlapping
source and destination rectangles is what    makes BitBlt tricky).  2.
Synonym for {blit} or {BLT}.  Both    uses are borderline techspeak.

   :BITNET: /bit'net/ n., obs.  [acronym: Because It's Time    NETwork]
Everybody's least favorite piece of the network (see    {the network})
- until AOL happened.  The BITNET hosts were a    collection of IBM
dinosaurs and VAXen (the latter with lobotomized    comm hardware) that
communicate using 80-character {{EBCDIC}} card    images (see
{eighty-column mind}); thus, they tend to mangle the    headers and
text of third-party traffic from the rest of the    ASCII/{RFC}-822
world with annoying regularity.  BITNET was also    notorious as the
apparent home of {B1FF}.  By 1995 it had, much    to everyone's relief,
been obsolesced and absorbed into the    Internet. Unfortunately,
around this time we also got AOL.

   :bits: pl.n.  1. Information.  Examples: "I need some bits    about
file formats."  ("I need to know about file formats.")     Compare
{core dump}, sense 4.  2. Machine-readable    representation of a
document, specifically as contrasted with    paper: "I have only a
photocopy of the Jargon File; does anyone    know where I can get the
bits?".  See {softcopy}, {source of    all good bits} See also {bit}.

   :bitty box: /bit'ee boks/ n.  1. A computer sufficiently    small,
primitive, or incapable as to cause a hacker acute    claustrophobia at
the thought of developing software on or for it.     Especially used of
small, obsolescent, single-tasking-only personal    machines such as
the Atari 800, Osborne, Sinclair, VIC-20, TRS-80,    or IBM PC.  2.
[Pejorative] More generally, the opposite of    `real computer' (see
{Get a real computer!}).  See also    {mess-dos}, {toaster}, and {toy}.

   :bixen: pl.n.  Users of BIX (the BIX Information eXchange,
formerly the Byte Information eXchange). Parallels other plurals
like boxen, {VAXen}, oxen.

   :bixie: /bik'see/ n.  Variant {emoticon}s used on BIX    (the Byte
Information eXchange).  The most common ({smiley})    bixie is <@_@>,
representing two cartoon eyes and a mouth.  These    were originally
invented in an SF fanzine called APA-L and imported    to BIX by one of
the earliest users.

   :black art: n.  [common] A collection of arcane,    unpublished, and
(by implication) mostly ad-hoc techniques    developed for a particular
application or systems area (compare    {black magic}).  VLSI design
and compiler code optimization were    (in their beginnings) considered
classic examples of black art; as    theory developed they became {deep
magic}, and once standard    textbooks had been written, became merely
{heavy wizardry}.  The    huge proliferation of formal and informal
channels for spreading    around new computer-related technologies
during the last twenty    years has made both the term `black art' and
what it describes    less common than formerly.  See also {voodoo
programming}.

   :black hole: n.,vt.  [common] What data (a piece of email    or
netnews, or a stream of TCP/IP packets) has fallen into if it
disappears mysteriously between its origin and destination sites
(that is, without returning a {bounce message}).  "I think    there's a
black hole at foovax!" conveys suspicion that site    foovax has been
dropping a lot of stuff on the floor lately    (see {drop on the
floor}).  The implied metaphor of email as    interstellar travel is
interesting in itself.  Readily verbed as    `blackhole': "That router
is blackholing IDP packets."  Compare    {bit bucket} aand see {RBL}.

   :black magic: n.  [common] A technique that works, though    nobody
really understands why.  More obscure than {voodoo    programming},
which may be done by cookbook.  Compare also    {black art}, {deep
magic}, and {magic number} (sense 2).

   :Black Screen of Death: n.  [prob. related to the    Floating Head
of Death in a famous "Far Side" cartoon.] A    failure mode of
{Microsloth Windows}.  On an attempt to launch a    DOS box, a
networked Windows system not uncommonly blanks the    screen and locks
up the PC so hard that it requires a cold    {boot} to recover. This
unhappy phenomenon is known as The Black    Screen of Death.  See also
{Blue Screen of Death}, which has    become rather more common.

   :Black Thursday: n.  February 8th, 1996 - the day of the    signing
into law of the {CDA}, so called by analogy with the    catastrophic
"Black Friday" in 1929 that began the Great    Depression.

   :blammo: v.  [Oxford Brookes University and alumni, UK] To
forcibly remove someone from any interactive system, especially
talker systems. The operators, who may remain hidden, may `blammo'    a
user who is misbehaving.  Very similar to MIT {gun}; in fact,    the
`blammo-gun' is a notional device used to `blammo' someone.     While
in actual fact the only incarnation of the blammo-gun is the    command
used to forcibly eject a user, operators speak of different    levels
of blammo-gun fire; e.g., a blammo-gun to `stun' will    temporarily
remove someone, but a blammo-gun set to `maim' will    stop someone
coming back on for a while.

   :blargh: /blarg/ n.  [MIT; now common] The opposite of    {ping},
sense 5; an exclamation indicating that one has absorbed    or is
emitting a quantum of unhappiness.  Less common than    {ping}.

   :blast: 1. v.,n.  Synonym for {BLT}, used esp. for large    data
sends over a network or comm line.  Opposite of {snarf}.     Usage:
uncommon.  The variant `blat' has been reported.  2. vt.
[HP/Apollo] Synonymous with {nuke} (sense 3).  Sometimes the    message
`Unable to kill all processes.  Blast them (y/n)?'    would appear in
the command window upon logout.

   :blat: n.  1. Syn. {blast}, sense 1.  2. See {thud}.

   :bletch: /blech/ interj.  [very common; from    Yiddish/German
`brechen', to vomit, poss.  via comic-strip    exclamation `blech']
Term of disgust.  Often used in "Ugh,    bletch".  Compare {barf}.

   :bletcherous: /blech'*-r*s/ adj.  Disgusting in design or
function; esthetically unappealing.  This word is seldom used of
people.  "This keyboard is bletcherous!" (Perhaps the keys don't
work very well, or are misplaced.)  See {losing},    {cretinous},
{bagbiting}, {bogus}, and {random}.  The    term {bletcherous} applies
to the esthetics of the thing so    described; similarly for
{cretinous}.  By contrast, something    that is `losing' or `bagbiting'
may be failing to meet    objective criteria.  See also {bogus} and
{random}, which    have richer and wider shades of meaning than any of
the above.

   :blink: vi.,n.  To use a navigator or off-line message    reader to
minimize time spent on-line to a commercial network    service (a
necessity in many places outside the U.S. where the    telecoms
monopolies charge per-minute for local calls).  As of late    1994,
this term was said to be in wide use in the UK, but is rare    or
unknown in the US.

   :blinkenlights: /blink'*n-li:tz/ n.  [common] Front-panel
diagnostic lights on a computer, esp. a {dinosaur}.  Now that
dinosaurs are rare, this term usually refers to status lights on a
modem, network hub, or the like.

   This term derives from the last word of the famous
blackletter-Gothic sign in mangled pseudo-German that once graced
about half the computer rooms in the English-speaking world.  One
version ran in its entirety as follows:

                    ACHTUNG!  ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!

     Das computermachine ist nicht fuer gefingerpoken und mittengrabben.
     Ist easy schnappen der springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken
     mit spitzensparken.  Ist nicht fuer gewerken bei das dumpkopfen.
     Das rubbernecken sichtseeren keepen das cotten-pickenen hans in das
     pockets muss; relaxen und watchen das blinkenlichten.

This silliness dates back at least as far as 1959 at Stanford
University and had already gone international by the early 1960s,
when it was reported at London University's ATLAS computing site.
There are several variants of it in circulation, some of which
actually do end with the word `blinkenlights'.

   In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers
have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in
fractured English, one of which is reproduced here:

                               ATTENTION

     This room is fullfilled mit special electronische equippment.
     Fingergrabbing and pressing the cnoeppkes from the computers is
     allowed for die experts only!  So all the "lefthanders" stay away
     and do not disturben the brainstorming von here working
     intelligencies.  Otherwise you will be out thrown and kicked
     anderswhere!  Also: please keep still and only watchen astaunished
     the blinkenlights.

See also {geef}.

   Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because
they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly,
very few computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard
certainly don't count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost    of
front-panel cutouts, almost nobody needs or wants to interpret
machine-register states on the fly anymore) are only part of the
story.  Another part of it is that radio-frequency leakage from the
lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem as far back as transistor
machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that there are very few
signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With slow CPUs,    you
could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick, but    at
33/66/150MHz it's all a blur.

   Finally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen on
news.admin.net-abuse.email:

                    ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!

     Das Internet is nicht fuer gefingerclicken und giffengrabben. Ist
     easy droppenpacket der routers und overloaden der backbone mit der
     spammen und der me-tooen.  Ist nicht fuer gewerken bei das
     dumpkopfen. Das mausklicken sichtseeren keepen das bandwit-spewin
     hans in das pockets muss; relaxen und watchen das cursorblinken.

   :blit: /blit/ vt.  1. [common] To copy a large array of    bits from
one part of a computer's memory to another part,    particularly when
the memory is being used to determine what is    shown on a display
screen.  "The storage allocator picks through    the table and copies
the good parts up into high memory, and then    blits it all back down
again."  See {bitblt}, {BLT},    {dd}, {cat}, {blast}, {snarf}.  More
generally, to    perform some operation (such as toggling) on a large
array of bits    while moving them.  2. [historical, rare] Sometimes
all-capitalized    as `BLIT': an early experimental bit-mapped terminal
designed by    Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later commercialized as the AT&T
5620.  (The    folk etymology from `Bell Labs Intelligent Terminal' is
incorrect.     Its creators liked to claim that "Blit" stood for the
Bacon,    Lettuce, and Interactive Tomato.)

   :blitter: /blit'r/ n.  [common] A special-purpose chip    or
hardware system built to perform {blit} operations, esp.     used for
fast implementation of bit-mapped graphics.  The Commodore    Amiga and
a few other micros have these, but since 1990 the trend    has been
away from them (however, see {cycle of reincarnation}).     Syn.
{raster blaster}.

   :blivet: /bliv'*t/ n.  [allegedly from a World War II    military
term meaning "ten pounds of manure in a five-pound bag"]    1. An
intractable problem.  2. A crucial piece of hardware that    can't be
fixed or replaced if it breaks.  3. A tool that has been    hacked over
by so many incompetent programmers that it has become    an
unmaintainable tissue of hacks.  4. An out-of-control but    unkillable
development effort.  5. An embarrassing bug that pops up    during a
customer demo.  6. In the subjargon of computer security
specialists, a denial-of-service attack performed by hogging    limited
resources that have no access controls (for example, shared    spool
space on a multi-user system).

   This term has other meanings in other technical cultures; among
experimental physicists and hardware engineers of various kinds it
seems to mean any random object of unknown purpose (similar to
hackish use of {frob}).  It has also been used to describe an
amusing trick-the-eye drawing resembling a three-pronged fork that
appears to depict a three-dimensional object until one realizes    that
the parts fit together in an impossible way.

   :bloatware: n.  [common] Software that provides minimal
functionality while requiring a disproportionate amount of    diskspace
and memory.  Especially used for application and OS upgrades.     This
term is very common in the Windows/NT world.  So is its    cause.

   :BLOB:  1. n. [acronym: Binary Large OBject] Used by database
people to refer to any random large block of bits that needs to be
stored in a database, such as a picture or sound file.  The
essential point about a BLOB is that it's an object that cannot be
interpreted within the database itself.  2. v. To {mailbomb}    someone
by sending a BLOB to him/her; esp. used as a mild threat.     "If that
program crashes again, I'm going to BLOB the core dump to    you."

   :block: v.  [common; from process scheduling terminology    in OS
theory] 1. vi.  To delay or sit idle while waiting for    something.
"We're blocking until everyone gets here."  Compare    {busy-wait}.  2.
`block on' vt. To block, waiting for    (something).  "Lunch is blocked
on Phil's arrival."

   :block transfer computations: n.  [from the television series
"Dr. Who"] Computations so fiendishly subtle and complex that    they
could not be performed by machines.  Used to refer to any task    that
should be expressible as an algorithm in theory, but isn't.     (The
Z80's LDIR instruction, "Computed Block Transfer with    increment",
may also be relevant.)

   :Bloggs Family: n.  An imaginary family consisting of    Fred and
Mary Bloggs and their children.  Used as a standard    example in
knowledge representation to show the difference between    extensional
and intensional objects.  For example, every occurrence    of "Fred
Bloggs" is the same unique person, whereas occurrences    of "person"
may refer to different people.  Members of the Bloggs    family have
been known to pop up in bizarre places such as the old    {DEC}
Telephone Directory.  Compare {Dr. Fred Mbogo};    {J. Random Hacker};
{Fred Foobar}.

   :blow an EPROM: /bloh *n ee'prom/ v.  (alt. `blast an    EPROM',
`burn an EPROM') To program a read-only memory, e.g.     for use with
an embedded system.  This term arose because the    programming process
for the Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs)    that preceded
present-day Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memories    (EPROMs)
involved intentionally blowing tiny electrical fuses on    the chip.
The usage lives on (it's too vivid and expressive to    discard) even
though the write process on EPROMs is nondestructive.

   :blow away: vt.  To remove (files and directories) from    permanent
storage, generally by accident.  "He reformatted the    wrong partition
and blew away last night's netnews."  Oppose    {nuke}.

   :blow out: vi.  [prob. from mining and tunneling jargon] Of
software, to fail spectacularly; almost as serious as {crash and
burn}.  See {blow past}, {blow up}, {die horribly}.

   :blow past: vt.  To {blow out} despite a safeguard.  "The    server
blew past the 5K reserve buffer."

   :blow up: vi.  1. [scientific computation] To become unstable.
Suggests that the computation is diverging so rapidly that it will
soon overflow or at least go {nonlinear}.  2.  Syn. {blow    out}.

   :BLT: /B-L-T/, /bl*t/ or (rarely) /belt/ n.,vt.  Synonym    for
{blit}.  This is the original form of {blit} and the    ancestor of
{bitblt}.  It referred to any large bit-field copy    or move operation
(one resource-intensive memory-shuffling    operation done on pre-paged
versions of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was    sardonically referred to as
`The Big BLT').  The jargon usage has    outlasted the {PDP-10} BLock
Transfer instruction from which    {BLT} derives; nowadays, the
assembler mnemonic {BLT} almost    always means `Branch if Less Than
zero'.

   :Blue Book: n.  1. Informal name for one of the four standard
references on the page-layout and graphics-control language
{{PostScript}} ("PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook",    Adobe
Systems, Addison-Wesley 1985, QA76.73.P67P68, ISBN    0-201-10179-3);
the other three official guides are known as the    {Green Book}, the
{Red Book}, and the {White Book} (sense    2).  2. Informal name for
one of the three standard references on    Smalltalk: "Smalltalk-80:
The Language and its    Implementation", David Robson, Addison-Wesley
1983, QA76.8.S635G64,    ISBN 0-201-11371-63 (this book also has green
and red siblings).     3. Any of the 1988 standards issued by the
CCITT's ninth plenary    assembly.  These include, among other things,
the X.400 email spec    and the Group 1 through 4 fax standards.  See
also {{book    titles}}.

   :blue box:  n. 1. obs. Once upon a time, before    all-digital
switches made it possible for the phone companies to    move them out
of band, one could actually hear the switching tones    used to route
long-distance calls.  Early {phreaker}s built    devices called `blue
boxes' that could reproduce these tones,    which could be used to
commandeer portions of the phone network.     (This was not as hard as
it may sound; one early phreak acquired    the sobriquet `Captain
Crunch' after he proved that he could    generate switching tones with
a plastic whistle pulled out of a box    of Captain Crunch cereal!)
There were other colors of box with more    specialized phreaking uses;
red boxes, black boxes, silver boxes,    etc.  2. n. An {IBM} machine,
especially a large (non-PC)    one.

   :Blue Glue: n.  [IBM] IBM's SNA (Systems Network    Architecture),
an incredibly {losing} and {bletcherous}    communications protocol
widely favored at commercial shops that    don't know any better.  The
official IBM definition is "that which    binds blue boxes together."
See {fear and loathing}.  It may    not be irrelevant that Blue Glue is
the trade name of a 3M    product that is commonly used to hold down
the carpet squares to    the removable panel floors common in {dinosaur
pen}s.  A    correspondent at U. Minn. reports that the CS department
there has    about 80 bottles of the stuff hanging about, so they often
refer to    any messy work to be done as `using the blue glue'.

   :blue goo: n.  Term for `police' {nanobot}s intended to    prevent
{gray goo}, denature hazardous waste, destroy pollution,    put ozone
back into the stratosphere, prevent halitosis, and    promote truth,
justice, and the American way, etc.  The term    `Blue Goo' can be
found in Dr. Seuss's "Fox In Socks" to    refer to a substance much
like bubblegum.  `Would you like to    chew blue goo, sir?'.  See
{{nanotechnology}}.

   :Blue Screen of Death: n.  [common] This term is closely    related
to the older {Black Screen of Death} but much more    common (many
non-hackers have picked it up).  Due to the extreme    fragility and
bugginess of Microsoft Windows (3.1/95/NT versions),    misbehaving
applications can crash the OS.  The Blue Screen of    Death, sometimes
decorated with hex error codes, is what you get    when this happens.
(Commonly abbreviated {BSOD}.)  This event    is sufficiently common to
have inspired the following haiku from    Alan Tuplin:

             Your system which soared
             So freely on gliding wings
             now hangs, frozen and blue

   The following entry from the    Salon Haiku Contest
(http://www.salonmagazine.com/21st/chal/1998/02/10chal2.html), seems to
have predated popular use of the    term (and may indeed have inspired
it):

             Windows NT crashed.
             I am the Blue Screen of Death
             No one hears your screams.

   :blue wire: n.  [IBM] Patch wires added to circuit boards at    the
factory to correct design or fabrication problems.  These may    be
necessary if there hasn't been time to design and qualify    another
board version.  Compare {purple wire}, {red wire},    {yellow wire},
{pink wire}.

   :blurgle: /bler'gl/ n.  [UK] Spoken {metasyntactic    variable}, to
indicate some text that is obvious from context, or    which is already
known. If several words are to be replaced,    blurgle may well be
doubled or tripled. "To look for something in    several files use
`grep string blurgle blurgle'."  In each case,    "blurgle blurgle"
would be understood to be replaced by the file    you wished to search.
Compare {mumble}, sense 7.

   :BNF: /B-N-F/ n.  1. [techspeak] Acronym for `Backus-Naur    Form',
a metasyntactic notation used to specify the syntax of    programming
languages, command sets, and the like.  Widely used for    language
descriptions but seldom documented anywhere, so that it    must usually
be learned by osmosis from other hackers.  Consider    this BNF for a
U.S. postal address:

      <postal-address> ::= <name-part> <street-address> <zip-part>

      <personal-part> ::= <name> | <initial> "."

      <name-part> ::= <personal-part> <last-name> [<jr-part>] <EOL>
                    | <personal-part> <name-part>

      <street-address> ::= [<apt>] <house-num> <street-name> <EOL>

      <zip-part> ::= <town-name> "," <state-code> <ZIP-code> <EOL>

This translates into English as: "A postal-address consists of a
name-part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a    zip-code
part.  A personal-part consists of either a first name or    an initial
followed by a dot.  A name-part consists of either: a    personal-part
followed by a last name followed by an optional    `jr-part' (Jr., Sr.,
or dynastic number) and end-of-line, or a    personal part followed by
a name part (this rule illustrates the    use of recursion in BNFs,
covering the case of people who use    multiple first and middle names
and/or initials).  A street address    consists of an optional
apartment specifier, followed by a street    number, followed by a
street name.  A zip-part consists of a    town-name, followed by a
comma, followed by a state code, followed    by a ZIP-code followed by
an end-of-line."  Note that many things    (such as the format of a
personal-part, apartment specifier, or    ZIP-code) are left
unspecified.  These are presumed to be obvious    from context or
detailed somewhere nearby.  See also {parse}.     2. Any of a number of
variants and extensions of BNF proper,    possibly containing some or
all of the {regexp} wildcards such    as `*' or `+'.  In fact the
example above isn't the pure    form invented for the Algol-60 report;
it uses `[]', which was    introduced a few years later in IBM's PL/I
definition but is now    universally recognized.  3. In
{{science-fiction fandom}}, a    `Big-Name Fan' (someone famous or
notorious).  Years ago a fan    started handing out black-on-green BNF
buttons at SF conventions;    this confused the hacker contingent
terribly.

   :boa: [IBM] n.  Any one of the fat cables that lurk under the
floor in a {dinosaur pen}.  Possibly so called because they    display
a ferocious life of their own when you try to lay them    straight and
flat after they have been coiled for some time.  It is    rumored
within IBM that channel cables for the 370 are limited to    200 feet
because beyond that length the boas get dangerous -- and    it is worth
noting that one of the major cable makers uses the    trademark
`Anaconda'.

   :board: n.  1. In-context synonym for {bboard}; sometimes    used
even for Usenet newsgroups (but see usage note under    {bboard}, sense
1).  2. An electronic circuit board.

   :boat anchor: n.  [common; from ham radio] 1. Like {doorstop}    but
more severe; implies that the offending hardware is    irreversibly
dead or useless.  "That was a working motherboard    once.  One
lightning strike later, instant boat anchor!"  2. A    person who just
takes up space. 3. Obsolete but still    working hardware, especially
when used of an old S100-bus hobbyist    system; originally a term of
annoyance, but became more and more    affectionate as the hardware
became more and more obsolete.

   :bob: n.  At Demon Internet, all tech support personal are    called
"Bob".  (Female support personnel have an option on    "Bobette").
This has nothing to do with Bob the divine    drilling-equipment
salesman of the {Church of the SubGenius}.     Nor is it acronymized
from "Brother Of {BOFH}", though all    parties agree it could have
been.  Rather, it was triggered by an    unusually large draft of new
tech-support people in 1995.  It was    observed that there would be
much duplication of names.  To ease    the confusion, it was decided
that all support techs would    henceforth be known as "Bob", and
identity badges were created    labelled "Bob 1" and "Bob 2".  (No, we
never got any further).

   The reason for "Bob" rather than anything else is due to a
{luser} calling and asking to speak to "Bob", despite the fact    that
no "Bob" was currently working for Tech Support.  Since we    all know
"the customer is always right", it was decided that    there had to be
at least one "Bob" on duty at all times, just in    case.

   This sillyness inexorably snowballed.  Shift leaders and managers
began to refer to their groups of "bobs".  Whole ranks of support
machines were set up (and still exist in the DNS as of 1999) as    bob1
through bobN. Then came alt.tech-support.recovery, and    it was filled
with Demon support personnel.  They    all referred to themselves, and
to others, as `bob', and after a while it    caught on.   There is now a
  Bob Code (http://bob.bob.bofh.org/~giolla/bobcode.html)
describing the Bob nature.

   :bodysurf code: n.  A program or segment of code written    quickly
in the heat of inspiration without the benefit of formal    design or
deep thought.  Like its namesake sport, the result is    too often a
wipeout that leaves the programmer eating sand.

   :BOF: /B-O-F/ or /bof/ n.  1. [common] Abbreviation    for the
phrase "Birds Of a Feather" (flocking together), an    informal
discussion group and/or bull session scheduled on a    conference
program.  It is not clear where or when this term    originated, but it
is now associated with the USENIX conferences    for Unix techies and
was already established there by 1984.  It was    used earlier than
that at DECUS conferences and is reported to have    been common at
SHARE meetings as far back as the early 1960s.     2. Acronym,
`Beginning of File'.

   :BOFH: // n.  [common] Acronym, Bastard Operator From    Hell.  A
system administrator with absolutely no tolerance for    {luser}s.
"You say you need more filespace?     <massive-global-delete> Seems to
me you have plenty left..."  Many    BOFHs (and others who would be
BOFHs if they could get away with    it) hang out in the newsgroup
alt.sysadmin.recovery,    although there has also been created a
top-level newsgroup    hierarchy (bofh.*) of their own.

   Several people have written stories about BOFHs. The set usually
considered canonical is by Simon Travaglia and may be found at the
Bastard Home Page,
`http://prime-mover.cc.waikato.ac.nz/Bastard.html'. BOFHs and    BOFH
wannabes hang out on {scary devil monastery} and wield    {LART}s.

   :bogo-sort: /boh`goh-sort'/ n.  (var. `stupid-sort')    The
archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to    {bubble
sort}, which is merely the generic _bad_    algorithm).  Bogo-sort is
equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck    of cards in the air,
picking them up at random, and then testing    whether they are in
order.  It serves as a sort of canonical    example of awfulness.
Looking at a program and seeing a dumb    algorithm, one might say "Oh,
I see, this program uses    bogo-sort."  Esp.  appropriate for
algorithms with factorial or    super-exponential running time in the
average case and    probabilistically infinite worst-case running time.
Compare    {bogus}, {brute force}, {lasherism}.

   A spectacular variant of bogo-sort has been proposed which has the
interesting property that, if the Many Worlds interpretation of
quantum mechanics is true, it can sort an arbitrarily large array    in
constant time.  (In the Many-Worlds model, the result of any    quantum
action is to split the universe-before into a sheaf of
universes-after, one for each possible way the state vector can
collapse; in any one of the universes-after the result appears random.)
  The steps are: 1. Permute the array randomly using a quantum
process, 2. If the array is not sorted, destroy the universe.
Implementation of step 2 is left as an exercise for the    reader.

   :bogometer: /boh-gom'-*t-er/ n.  A notional instrument    for
measuring {bogosity}.  Compare the {Troll-O-Meter} and    the
`wankometer' described in the {wank} entry; see also    {bogus}.

   :bogon: /boh'gon/ n.  [very common; by analogy with
proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless reinforced after 1980 by the
similarity to Douglas Adams's `Vogons'; see the {Bibliography}    in
Appendix C and note that Arthur Dent actually mispronounces    `Vogons'
as `Bogons' at one point] 1. The elementary particle of    bogosity
(see {quantum bogodynamics}).  For instance, "the    Ethernet is
emitting bogons again" means that it is broken or    acting in an
erratic or bogus fashion.  2. A query packet sent from    a TCP/IP
domain resolver to a root server, having the reply bit set    instead
of the query bit.  3. Any bogus or incorrectly formed    packet sent on
a network.  4. By synecdoche, used to refer to any    bogus thing, as
in "I'd like to go to lunch with you but I've got    to go to the
weekly staff bogon".  5. A person who is bogus or    who says bogus
things.  This was historically the original usage,    but has been
overtaken by its derivative senses 1-4.  See also    {bogosity},
{bogus}; compare {psyton}, {fat electrons},    {magic smoke}.

   The bogon has become the type case for a whole bestiary of nonce
particle names, including the `clutron' or `cluon' (indivisible
particle of cluefulness, obviously the antiparticle of the bogon)
and the futon (elementary particle of {randomness}, or sometimes    of
lameness).  These are not so much live usages in themselves as
examples of a live meta-usage: that is, it has become a standard
joke or linguistic maneuver to "explain" otherwise mysterious
circumstances by inventing nonce particle names.  And these imply
nonce particle theories, with all their dignity or lack thereof (we
might note parenthetically that this is a generalization from
"(bogus particle) theories" to "bogus (particle theories)"!).
Perhaps such particles are the modern-day equivalents of trolls and
wood-nymphs as standard starting-points around which to construct
explanatory myths.  Of course, playing on an existing word (as in
the `futon') yields additional flavor.  Compare {magic    smoke}.

   :bogon filter: /boh'gon fil'tr/ n.  Any device, software or
hardware, that limits or suppresses the flow and/or emission of
bogons.  "Engineering hacked a bogon filter between the Cray and    the
VAXen, and now we're getting fewer dropped packets."  See also
{bogosity}, {bogus}.

   :bogon flux: /boh'gon fluhks/ n.  A measure of a supposed    field
of {bogosity} emitted by a speaker, measured by a    {bogometer}; as a
speaker starts to wander into increasing    bogosity a listener might
say "Warning, warning, bogon flux is    rising".  See {quantum
bogodynamics}.

   :bogosity: /boh-go's*-tee/ n.  1. [orig. CMU, now very    common]
The degree to which something is {bogus}.  Bogosity is    measured with
a {bogometer}; in a seminar, when a speaker says    something bogus, a
listener might raise his hand and say "My    bogometer just triggered".
More extremely, "You just pinned my    bogometer" means you just said
or did something so outrageously    bogus that it is off the scale,
pinning the bogometer needle at the    highest possible reading (one
might also say "You just redlined my    bogometer").  The agreed-upon
unit of bogosity is the    {microLenat}.  2. The potential field
generated by a {bogon    flux}; see {quantum bogodynamics}.  See also
{bogon flux},    {bogon filter}, {bogus}.

   :bogotify: /boh-go't*-fi:/ vt.  To make or become bogus.  A
program that has been changed so many times as to become completely
disorganized has become bogotified.  If you tighten a nut too hard
and strip the threads on the bolt, the bolt has become bogotified
and you had better not use it any more.  This coinage led to the
notional `autobogotiphobia' defined as `the fear of becoming
bogotified'; but is not clear that the latter has ever been    `live'
jargon rather than a self-conscious joke in jargon about    jargon.
See also {bogosity}, {bogus}.

   :bogue out: /bohg owt/ vi.  To become bogus, suddenly and
unexpectedly.  "His talk was relatively sane until somebody asked
him a trick question; then he bogued out and did nothing but    {flame}
afterwards."  See also {bogosity}, {bogus}.

   :bogus: adj.  1. Non-functional.  "Your patches are bogus."     2.
Useless.  "OPCON is a bogus program."  3. False.  "Your    arguments
are bogus."  4. Incorrect.  "That algorithm is bogus."     5.
Unbelievable.  "You claim to have solved the halting problem    for
Turing Machines?  That's totally bogus."  6. Silly.  "Stop    writing
those bogus sagas."

   Astrology is bogus.  So is a bolt that is obviously about to break.
  So is someone who makes blatantly false claims to have solved a
scientific problem.  (This word seems to have some, but not all, of
the connotations of {random} -- mostly the negative ones.)

   It is claimed that `bogus' was originally used in the hackish
sense at Princeton in the late 1960s.  It was spread to CMU and    Yale
by Michael Shamos, a migratory Princeton alumnus.  A glossary    of
bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was first    popularized
there about 1975-76.  These coinages spread into    hackerdom from CMU
and MIT.  Most of them remained wordplay    objects rather than actual
vocabulary items or live metaphors.     Examples: `amboguous' (having
multiple bogus interpretations);    `bogotissimo' (in a gloriously
bogus manner); `bogotophile'    (one who is pathologically fascinated
by the bogus);    `paleobogology' (the study of primeval bogosity).

   Some bogowords, however, obtained sufficient live currency to be
listed elsewhere in this lexicon; see {bogometer}, {bogon},
{bogotify}, and {quantum bogodynamics} and the related    but unlisted
{Dr. Fred Mbogo}.

   By the early 1980s `bogus' was also current in something like
hacker usage sense in West Coast teen slang, and it had gone
mainstream by 1985.  A correspondent from Cambridge reports, by
contrast, that these uses of `bogus' grate on British nerves; in
Britain the word means, rather specifically, `counterfeit', as in    "a
bogus 10-pound note".

   :Bohr bug: /bohr buhg/ n.  [from quantum physics] A repeatable
{bug}; one that manifests reliably under a possibly unknown but
well-defined set of conditions.  Antonym of {heisenbug}; see also
{mandelbug}, {schroedinbug}.

   :boink: /boynk/  [Usenet: variously ascribed to the TV    series
"Cheers" "Moonlighting", and "Soap"]    1. v. To have sex with; compare
{bounce}, sense 3. (This is    mainstream slang.) In Commonwealth
hackish the variant `bonk' is    more common.  2. n. After the original
Peter Korn `Boinkon'    {Usenet} parties, used for almost any net
social gathering,    e.g., Miniboink, a small boink held by Nancy
Gillett in 1988;    Minniboink, a Boinkcon in Minnesota in 1989;
Humpdayboinks,    Wednesday get-togethers held in the San Francisco Bay
Area.     Compare {@-party}.  3. Var of `bonk'; see {bonk/oif}.

   :bomb:  1. v. General synonym for {crash} (sense 1) except    that
it is not used as a noun; esp. used of software or OS    failures.
"Don't run Empire with less than 32K stack, it'll    bomb."  2. n.,v.
Atari ST and Macintosh equivalents of a Unix    `panic' or Amiga {guru}
(sense 2), in which icons of little    black-powder bombs or mushroom
clouds are displayed, indicating    that the system has died.  On the
Mac, this may be accompanied by a    decimal (or occasionally
hexadecimal) number indicating what went    wrong, similar to the Amiga
{guru meditation} number.     {{MS-DOS}} machines tend to get {locked
up} in this situation.

   :bondage-and-discipline language: n.  A language (such as
{{Pascal}}, {{Ada}}, APL, or Prolog) that, though ostensibly
general-purpose, is designed so as to enforce an author's theory of
`right programming' even though said theory is demonstrably
inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla general-purpose
programming.  Often abbreviated `B&D'; thus, one may speak of    things
"having the B&D nature".  See {{Pascal}}; oppose    {languages of
choice}.

   :bonk/oif: /bonk/, /oyf/ interj.  In the {MUD}    community, it has
become traditional to express pique or censure by    `bonking' the
offending person.  Convention holds that one should    acknowledge a
bonk by saying `oif!' and there is a myth to the    effect that failing
to do so upsets the cosmic bonk/oif balance,    causing much trouble in
the universe.  Some MUDs have implemented    special commands for
bonking and oifing.  See also {talk mode}.

   :book titles::  There is a tradition in hackerdom of    informally
tagging important textbooks and standards documents with    the
dominant color of their covers or with some other conspicuous
feature of the cover.  Many of these are described in this lexicon
under their own entries. See {Aluminum Book}, {Blue Book},    {Camel
Book}, {Cinderella Book}, {Devil Book}, {Dragon    Book}, {Green Book},
{Orange Book}, {Purple Book}, {Red    Book}, {Silver Book}, {White
Book}, {Wizard Book},    {Yellow Book}, and {bible}; see also {rainbow
series}.     Since about 1983 this tradition has gotten a boost from
the popular    O'Reilly Associates line of technical books, which
usually feature    some kind of exotic animal on the cover.

   :boot: v.,n.  [techspeak; from `by one's bootstraps'] To    load and
initialize the operating system on a machine.  This usage    is no
longer jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given    rise to
some derivatives that are still jargon.

   The derivative `reboot' implies that the machine hasn't been down
for long, or that the boot is a {bounce} (sense 4) intended to    clear
some state of {wedgitude}.  This is sometimes used of    human thought
processes, as in the following exchange: "You've    lost me."  "OK,
reboot.  Here's the theory...."

   This term is also found in the variants `cold boot' (from
power-off condition) and `warm boot' (with the CPU and all    devices
already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software    crash).

   Another variant: `soft boot', reinitialization of only part of a
system, under control of other software still running: "If    you're
running the {mess-dos} emulator, control-alt-insert will    cause a
soft-boot of the emulator, while leaving the rest of the    system
running."

   Opposed to this there is `hard boot', which connotes hostility
towards or frustration with the machine being booted:  "I'll have    to
hard-boot this losing Sun."  "I recommend booting it    hard."  One
often hard-boots by performing a {power cycle}.

   Historical note: this term derives from `bootstrap loader', a short
 program that was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in
from the front panel switches.  This program was always very short
(great efforts were expended on making it short in order to    minimize
the labor and chance of error involved in toggling it in),    but was
just smart enough to read in a slightly more complex    program
(usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it    handed
control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk
drive.  Thus, in successive steps, the computer `pulled itself up    by
its bootstraps' to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the    bootstrap
is usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first    stage in from
a fixed location on the disk, called the `boot    block'.  When this
program gains control, it is powerful enough to    load the actual OS
and hand control over to it.

   :Borg: n.  In "Star Trek: The Next Generation" the    Borg is a
species of cyborg that ruthlessly seeks to incorporate    all sentient
life into itself; their slogan is "Resistence is    futile.  You will
be assimilated."  In hacker parlance, the Borg    is usually
{Microsoft}, which is thought to be trying just as    ruthlessly to
assimilate all computers and the entire Internet to    itself (there is
a widely circulated image of Bill Gates as a    Borg).  Being forced to
use Windows or NT is often referred to as    being "Borged".
Interestingly, the {Halloween Documents}    reveal that this jargon is
live within Microsoft itself.  (Other    companies, notably Intel and
UUNet, have also occasionally been    equated to the Borg.) See also
{Evil Empire}, {Internet    Exploiter}.

   :borken: adj.  Commomn deliberate typo for `broken'.

   :bot: n  [common on IRC, MUD; from `robot'] An {IRC} or    {MUD}
user who is actually a program.  On IRC, typically the    robot
provides some useful service.  Examples are NickServ, which    tries to
prevent random users from adopting {nick}s already    claimed by
others, and MsgServ, which allows one to send    asynchronous messages
to be delivered when the recipient signs on.     Also common are
`annoybots', such as KissServ, which perform no    useful function
except to send cute messages to other people.     Service bots are less
common on MUDs; but some others, such as the    `Julia' bot active in
1990-91, have been remarkably impressive    Turing-test experiments,
able to pass as human for as long as ten    or fifteen minutes of
conversation.

   Note that bots used to be `robots' when the term first appeared in
the early 1990s, but the shortened form is now habitual.

   :bot spot: n.  [MUD, IRC] The user on a MUD with the    longest
connect time.  Derives from the fact that {bot}s on MUDS    often stay
constantly connected and appear at the bottom of the    list.

   :bottom feeder: n.  Syn. for {slopsucker}, derived from the
fishermen's and naturalists' term for finny creatures who subsist    on
the primordial ooze.

   :bottom-up implementation: n.  Hackish opposite of the    techspeak
term `top-down design'.  It is now received wisdom in    most
programming cultures that it is best to design from higher    levels of
abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences of action    in
increasing detail until you get to actual code.  Hackers often    find
(especially in exploratory designs that cannot be closely    specified
in advance) that it works best to _build_ things in    the opposite
order, by writing and testing a clean set of primitive    operations
and then knitting them together.

   :bounce: v.  1. [common; perhaps by analogy to a bouncing    check]
An electronic mail message that is undeliverable and returns    an
error notification to the sender is said to `bounce'.  See    also
{bounce message}.  2. [Stanford] To play volleyball.  The
now-demolished {D. C. Power Lab} building used by the Stanford    AI
Lab in the 1970s had a volleyball court on the front lawn.  From    5
P.M. to 7 P.M. was the scheduled maintenance time for the    computer,
so every afternoon at 5 would come over the intercom the    cry: "Now
hear this: bounce, bounce!", followed by Brian McCune    loudly
bouncing a volleyball on the floor outside the offices of    known
volleyballers.  3. To engage in sexual intercourse; prob.     from the
expression `bouncing the mattress', but influenced by    Roo's
psychosexually loaded "Try bouncing me, Tigger!" from the
"Winnie-the-Pooh" books.  Compare {boink}.  4. To casually    reboot a
system in order to clear up a transient problem.  Reported    primarily
among {VMS} and {Unix} users.  5.  [VM/CMS    programmers] _Automatic_
warm-start of a machine after an    error.  "I logged on this morning
and found it had bounced 7 times    during the night" 6. [IBM] To
{power cycle} a peripheral in    order to reset it.

   :bounce message: n.  [common] Notification message    returned to
sender by a site unable to relay {email} to the    intended {{Internet
address}} recipient or the next link in a    {bang path} (see {bounce},
sense 1).  Reasons might include a    nonexistent or misspelled
username or a {down} relay site.     Bounce messages can themselves
fail, with occasionally ugly    results; see {sorcerer's apprentice
mode} and {software    laser}.  The terms `bounce mail' and `barfmail'
are also    common.

   :boustrophedon: n.  [from a Greek word for turning like an ox
while plowing] An ancient method of writing using alternate
left-to-right and right-to-left lines.  This term is actually
philologists' techspeak and typesetters' jargon.  Erudite hackers
use it for an optimization performed by some computer typesetting
software and moving-head printers.  The adverbial form
`boustrophedonically' is also found (hackers purely love
constructions like this).

   :box: n.  1. A computer; esp. in the construction `foo    box' where
foo is some functional qualifier, like    `graphics', or the name of an
OS (thus, `Unix box', `MS-DOS    box', etc.)  "We preprocess the data
on Unix boxes before handing    it up to the mainframe."  2. [IBM]
Without qualification but    within an SNA-using site, this refers
specifically to an IBM    front-end processor or FEP /F-E-P/.  An FEP
is a small computer    necessary to enable an IBM {mainframe} to
communicate beyond the    limits of the {dinosaur pen}.  Typically used
in expressions    like the cry that goes up when an SNA network goes
down: "Looks    like the {box} has fallen over." (See {fall over}.) See
also    {IBM}, {fear and loathing}, {Blue Glue}.

   :boxed comments: n.  Comments (explanatory notes attached to
program instructions) that occupy several lines by themselves; so
called because in assembler and C code they are often surrounded by
a box in a style something like this:

     /*************************************************
      *
      * This is a boxed comment in C style
      *
      *************************************************/

Common variants of this style omit the asterisks in column 2 or add
a matching row of asterisks closing the right side of the box.  The
sparest variant omits all but the comment delimiters themselves;    the
`box' is implied.  Oppose {winged comments}.

   :boxen: /bok'sn/ pl.n.  [very common; by analogy with    {VAXen}]
Fanciful plural of {box} often encountered in the    phrase `Unix
boxen', used to describe commodity {{Unix}}    hardware.  The
connotation is that any two Unix boxen are    interchangeable.

   :boxology: /bok-sol'*-jee/ n.  Syn. {ASCII art}.  This    term
implies a more restricted domain, that of box-and-arrow    drawings.
"His report has a lot of boxology in it."  Compare    {macrology}.

   :bozotic: /boh-zoh'tik/ or /boh-zo'tik/ adj.  [from    the name of a
TV clown even more losing than Ronald McDonald]    Resembling or having
the quality of a bozo; that is, clownish,    ludicrously wrong,
unintentionally humorous.  Compare {wonky},    {demented}.  Note that
the noun `bozo' occurs in slang, but    the mainstream adjectival form
would be `bozo-like' or (in New    England) `bozoish'.

   :BQS: /B-Q-S/ adj.  Syn. {Berkeley Quality Software}.

   :brain dump: n.  [common] The act of telling someone    everything
one knows about a particular topic or project.     Typically used when
someone is going to let a new party maintain a    piece of code.
Conceptually analogous to an operating system    {core dump} in that it
saves a lot of useful {state} before    an exit.  "You'll have to give
me a brain dump on FOOBAR before    you start your new job at
HackerCorp."  See {core dump} (sense    4).  At Sun, this is also known
as `TOI' (transfer of    information).

   :brain fart: n.  The actual result of a {braino}, as    opposed to
the mental glitch that is the braino itself.  E.g.,    typing `dir' on
a Unix box after a session with DOS.

   :brain-damaged: adj.  1. [common; generalization of    `Honeywell
Brain Damage' (HBD), a theoretical disease invented to    explain
certain utter cretinisms in Honeywell {{Multics}}]    adj. Obviously
wrong; {cretinous}; {demented}.  There is    an implication that the
person responsible must have suffered brain    damage, because he
should have known better.  Calling something    brain-damaged is really
bad; it also implies it is unusable, and    that its failure to work is
due to poor design rather than some    accident.  "Only six monocase
characters per file name?  Now    _that's_ brain-damaged!"  2. [esp. in
the Mac world] May    refer to free demonstration software that has
been deliberately    crippled in some way so as not to compete with the
commercial    product it is intended to sell.  Syn.  {crippleware}.

   :brain-dead: adj.  [common] Brain-damaged in the extreme.     It
tends to imply terminal design failure rather than malfunction    or
simple stupidity.  "This comm program doesn't know how to send    a
break -- how brain-dead!"

   :braino: /bray'no/ n.  Syn. for {thinko}. See also    {brain fart}.

   :branch to Fishkill: n.  [IBM: from the location of one of the
corporation's facilities] Any unexpected jump in a program that
produces catastrophic or just plain weird results.  See {jump    off
into never-never land}, {hyperspace}.

   :bread crumbs: n.  Debugging statements inserted into a    program
that emit output or log indicators of the program's    {state} to a
file so you can see where it dies or pin down the    cause of
surprising behavior. The term is probably a reference to    the Hansel
and Gretel story from the Brothers Grimm or the older    French
folktale of Thumbelina; in several variants of these, a    character
leaves a trail of bread crumbs so as not to get lost in    the woods.

   :break:  1. vt. To cause to be {broken} (in any sense).     "Your
latest patch to the editor broke the paragraph commands."     2. v.
(of a program) To stop temporarily, so that it may debugged.     The
place where it stops is a `breakpoint'.  3. [techspeak]    vi. To send
an RS-232 break (two character widths of line high)    over a serial
comm line.  4. [Unix] vi. To strike whatever key    currently causes
the tty driver to send SIGINT to the current    process.  Normally,
break (sense 3), delete or {control-C} does    this.  5. `break break'
may be said to interrupt a conversation    (this is an example of verb
doubling).  This usage comes from radio    communications, which in
turn probably came from landline    telegraph/teleprinter usage, as
badly abused in the Citizen's Band    craze a few years ago.

   :break-even point: n.  In the process of implementing a new
computer language, the point at which the language is sufficiently
effective that one can implement the language in itself.  That is,
for a new language called, hypothetically, FOOGOL, one has reached
break-even when one can write a demonstration compiler for FOOGOL    in
FOOGOL, discard the original implementation language, and    thereafter
use working versions of FOOGOL to develop newer ones.     This is an
important milestone; see {MFTL}.

   Since this entry was first written, several correspondents have
reported that there actually was a compiler for a tiny Algol-like
language called Foogol floating around on various {VAXen} in the
early and mid-1980s.  A FOOGOL implementation is available at the
Retrocomputing Museum `http://www.ccil.org/retro'.

   :breath-of-life packet: n.  [XEROX PARC] An Ethernet packet    that
contains bootstrap (see {boot}) code, periodically sent out    from a
working computer to infuse the `breath of life' into any    computer on
the network that has happened to crash.  Machines    depending on such
packets have sufficient hardware or firmware code    to wait for (or
request) such a packet during the reboot process.     See also
{dickless workstation}.

   The notional `kiss-of-death packet', with a function
complementary to that of a breath-of-life packet, is recommended    for
dealing with hosts that consume too many network resources.     Though
`kiss-of-death packet' is usually used in jest, there is    at least
one documented instance of an Internet subnet with limited
address-table slots in a gateway machine in which such packets were
routinely used to compete for slots, rather like Christmas shoppers
competing for scarce parking spaces.

   :breedle: n.  See {feep}.

   :Breidbart Index: /bri:d'bart ind*ks/  A measurement of the
severity of spam invented by long-time hacker Seth Breidbart, used
for programming cancelbots. The Breidbart Index takes into account
the fact that excessive multi-posting {EMP} is worse than    excessive
cross-posting {ECP}.  The Breidbart Index is computed    as follows:
For each article in a spam, take the square-root of the    number of
newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart    Index is
the sum of the square roots of all of the posts in the    spam. For
example, one article posted to nine newsgroups and again    to sixteen
would have BI = sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 7.  It is generally    agreed that
a spam is cancelable if the Breidbart Index exceeds    20.

   The Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles
yesterday and ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up
to a 30-article spam. Spam fighters will often reset the count if
you can convince them that the spam was accidental    and/or you have
seen the error of your ways and won't repeat it.     Breidbart Index
can accumulate over multiple authors. For example,    the "Make Money
Fast" pyramid scheme exceeded a BI    of 20 a long time ago, and is now
considered "cancel on sight".

   :bring X to its knees: v.  [common] To present a machine,
operating system, piece of software, or algorithm with a load so
extreme or {pathological} that it grinds to a halt. "To bring    a
MicroVAX to its knees, try twenty users running {vi} -- or    four
running {EMACS}."  Compare {hog}.

   :brittle: adj.  Said of software that is functional but easily
broken by changes in operating environment or configuration, or by
any minor tweak to the software itself.  Also, any system that
responds inappropriately and disastrously to abnormal but expected
external stimuli; e.g., a file system that is usually totally
scrambled by a power failure is said to be brittle.  This term is
often used to describe the results of a research effort that were
never intended to be robust, but it can be applied to commercially
developed software, which displays the quality far more often than
it ought to.  Oppose {robust}.

   :broadcast storm: n.  [common] An incorrect packet    broadcast on a
network that causes most hosts to respond all at    once, typically
with wrong answers that start the process over    again.  See {network
meltdown}; compare {mail storm}.

   :brochureware: n.  Planned but non-existent product like
{vaporware}, but with the added implication that marketing is
actively selling and promoting it (they've printed brochures).
Brochureware is often deployed as a strategic weapon; the idea is    to
con customers into not committing to an existing product of the
competition's.  It is a safe bet that when a brochureware product
finally becomes real, it will be more expensive than and inferior    to
the alternatives that had been available for years.

   :broken: adj.  1. Not working properly (of programs).     2.
Behaving strangely; especially (when used of people) exhibiting
extreme depression.

   :broken arrow: n.  [IBM] The error code displayed on line 25    of a
3270 terminal (or a PC emulating a 3270) for various kinds of
protocol violations and "unexpected" error conditions (including
connection to a {down} computer).  On a PC, simulated with    `->/_',
with the two center characters overstruck.

   Note: to appreciate this term fully, it helps to know that `broken
arrow' is also military jargon for an accident involving nuclear
weapons....

   :BrokenWindows: n.  Abusive hackerism for the {crufty} and
{elephantine} {X} environment on Sun machines; properly    called
`OpenWindows'.

   :broket: /broh'k*t/ or /broh'ket`/ n.  [rare; by    analogy with
`bracket': a `broken bracket'] Either of the    characters `<' and `>',
when used as paired enclosing    delimiters.  This word originated as a
contraction of the phrase    `broken bracket', that is, a bracket that
is bent in the middle.     (At MIT, and apparently in the {Real World}
as well, these are    usually called {angle brackets}.)

   :Brooks's Law: prov.  "Adding manpower to a late software    project
makes it later" -- a result of the fact that the expected    advantage
from splitting development work among N    programmers is O(N) (that
is, proportional to N), but    the complexity and communications cost
associated with coordinating    and then merging their work is O(N^2)
(that is, proportional    to the square of N).  The quote is from Fred
Brooks, a    manager of IBM's OS/360 project and author of "The Mythical
  Man-Month" (Addison-Wesley, 1975, ISBN 0-201-00650-2), an excellent
 early book on software engineering.  The myth in question has been
most tersely expressed as "Programmer time is fungible" and    Brooks
established conclusively that it is not.  Hackers have never
forgotten his advice (though it's not the whole story; see
{bazaar}); too often, {management} still does.  See also
{creationism}, {second-system effect}, {optimism}.

   :brown-paper-bag bug: n.  A bug in a public software    release that
is so embarassing that the author notionally wears    a brown paper bag
over his head for a while so he won't be    recognized on the net.
Entered popular usage after the early-1999    release of the first
Linux 2.2, which had one.  The phrase was used    in Linus Torvalds's
apology posting.

   :browser: n.  A program specifically designed to help users view
and navigate hypertext, on-line documentation, or a database.     While
this general sense has been present in jargon for a long    time, the
proliferation of browsers for the World Wide Web after    1992 has made
it much more popular and provided a central or    default meaning of
the word previously lacking in hacker usage.     Nowadays, if someone
mentions using a `browser' without    qualification, one may assume it
is a Web browser.

   :BRS: /B-R-S/ n.  Syn. {Big Red Switch}.  This    abbreviation is
fairly common on-line.

   :brute force: adj.  Describes a primitive programming style,    one
in which the programmer relies on the computer's processing    power
instead of using his or her own intelligence to simplify the
problem, often ignoring problems of scale and applying naive    methods
suited to small problems directly to large ones.  The term    can also
be used in reference to programming style: brute-force    programs are
written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of    repetition and devoid
of any elegance or useful abstraction (see    also {brute force and
ignorance}).

   The {canonical} example of a brute-force algorithm is associated
with the `traveling salesman problem' (TSP), a classical    {NP-}hard
problem: Suppose a person is in, say, Boston, and    wishes to drive to
N other cities.  In what order should the    cities be visited in order
to minimize the distance travelled?  The    brute-force method is to
simply generate all possible routes and    compare the distances; while
guaranteed to work and simple to    implement, this algorithm is
clearly very stupid in that it    considers even obviously absurd
routes (like going from Boston to    Houston via San Francisco and New
York, in that order).  For very    small N it works well, but it
rapidly becomes absurdly    inefficient when N increases (for N = 15,
there are    already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to consider, and
for    N = 1000 -- well, see {bignum}).  Sometimes,    unfortunately,
there is no better general solution than brute    force.  See also
{NP-}.

   A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding
the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing
program to sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the
first number off the front.

   Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered
stupid or not depends on the context; if the problem is not    terribly
big, the extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution    may cost
less than the programmer time it would take to develop a    more
`intelligent' algorithm.  Additionally, a more intelligent    algorithm
may imply more long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing    than are
justified by the speed improvement.

   Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the
epigram "When in doubt, use brute force".  He probably intended
this as a {ha ha only serious}, but the original Unix kernel's
preference for simple, robust, and portable algorithms over
{brittle} `smart' ones does seem to have been a significant    factor
in the success of that OS.  Like so many other tradeoffs in    software
design, the choice between brute force and complex,    finely-tuned
cleverness is often a difficult one that requires both    engineering
savvy and delicate esthetic judgment.

   :brute force and ignorance: n.  A popular design technique at
many software houses -- {brute force} coding unrelieved by any
knowledge of how problems have been previously solved in elegant
ways.  Dogmatic adherence to design methodologies tends to    encourage
this sort of thing.  Characteristic of early {larval    stage}
programming; unfortunately, many never outgrow it.  Often
abbreviated BFI: "Gak, they used a {bubble sort}!  That's    strictly
from BFI."  Compare {bogosity}.

   :BSD: /B-S-D/ n.  [abbreviation for `Berkeley Software
Distribution'] a family of {{Unix}} versions for the {DEC}    {VAX} and
PDP-11 developed by Bill Joy and others at    {Berzerkeley} starting
around 1980, incorporating paged virtual    memory, TCP/IP networking
enhancements, and many other features.     The BSD versions (4.1, 4.2,
and 4.3) and the commercial versions    derived from them (SunOS,
ULTRIX, and Mt. Xinu) held the technical    lead in the Unix world
until AT&T's successful standardization    efforts after about 1986,
and are still widely popular.  Note that    BSD versions going back to
2.9 are often referred to by their    version numbers, without the BSD
prefix.  See {4.2}, {{Unix}},    {USG Unix}.

   :BSOD: //   Very commmon abbreviation for {Blue    Screen of Death}.
Both spoken and written.

   :BUAF: // n.  [abbreviation, from alt.fan.warlord] Big    Ugly ASCII
Font -- a special form of {ASCII art}.  Various    programs exist for
rendering text strings into block, bloob, and    pseudo-script fonts in
cells between four and six character cells    on a side; this is
smaller than the letters generated by older    {banner} (sense 2)
programs.  These are sometimes used to render    one's name in a {sig
block}, and are critically referred to as    `BUAF's.  See {warlording}.

   :BUAG: // n.  [abbreviation, from alt.fan.warlord] Big    Ugly ASCII
Graphic.  Pejorative term for ugly {ASCII art},    especially as found
in {sig block}s.  For some reason, mutations    of the head of Bart
Simpson are particularly common in the least    imaginative {sig
block}s.  See {warlording}.

   :bubble sort: n.  Techspeak for a particular sorting technique    in
which pairs of adjacent values in the list to be sorted are    compared
and interchanged if they are out of order; thus, list    entries
`bubble upward' in the list until they bump into one    with a lower
sort value.  Because it is not very good relative to    other methods
and is the one typically stumbled on by {naive}    and untutored
programmers, hackers consider it the {canonical}    example of a naive
algorithm.  The canonical example of a really    _bad_ algorithm is
{bogo-sort}.  A bubble sort might be    used out of ignorance, but any
use of bogo-sort could issue only    from brain damage or willful
perversity.

   :bucky bits: /buh'kee bits/ n.  1. obs. The bits produced by    the
CONTROL and META shift keys on a SAIL keyboard (octal 200 and    400
respectively), resulting in a 9-bit keyboard character set.     The MIT
AI TV (Knight) keyboards extended this with TOP and    separate left
and right CONTROL and META keys, resulting in a    12-bit character
set; later, LISP Machines added such keys as    SUPER, HYPER, and GREEK
(see {space-cadet keyboard}).  2. By    extension, bits associated with
`extra' shift keys on any    keyboard, e.g., the ALT on an IBM PC or
command and option keys on    a Macintosh.

   It has long been rumored that `bucky bits' were named for
Buckminster Fuller during a period when he was consulting at
Stanford.  Actually, bucky bits were invented by Niklaus Wirth when
_he_ was at Stanford in 1964-65; he first suggested the idea    of an
EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an otherwise 7-bit ASCII    character).
It seems that, unknown to Wirth, certain Stanford    hackers had
privately nicknamed him `Bucky' after a prominent    portion of his
dental anatomy, and this nickname transferred to the    bit.  Bucky-bit
commands were used in a number of editors written    at Stanford,
including most notably TV-EDIT and NLS.

   The term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use.
Ironically, Wirth himself remained unaware of its derivation for
nearly 30 years, until GLS dug up this history in early 1993!  See
{double bucky}, {quadruple bucky}.

   :buffer chuck: n.  Shorter and ruder syn. for {buffer    overflow}.

   :buffer overflow: n.  What happens when you try to stuff    more
data into a buffer (holding area) than it can handle.  This    problem
is commonly exploited by {cracker}s to get arbitrary    commands
executed by a program running with root permissions.  This    may be
due to a mismatch in the processing rates of the producing    and
consuming processes (see {overrun} and {firehose    syndrome}), or
because the buffer is simply too small to hold all    the data that
must accumulate before a piece of it can be    processed.  For example,
in a text-processing tool that    {crunch}es a line at a time, a short
line buffer can result in    {lossage} as input from a long line
overflows the buffer and    trashes data beyond it.  Good defensive
programming would check for    overflow on each character and stop
accepting data when the buffer    is full up.  The term is used of and
by humans in a metaphorical    sense.  "What time did I agree to meet
you?  My buffer must have    overflowed."  Or "If I answer that phone
my buffer is going to    overflow."  See also {spam}, {overrun screw}.

   :bug: n.  An unwanted and unintended property of a program or
piece of hardware, esp. one that causes it to malfunction.     Antonym
of {feature}.  Examples: "There's a bug in the editor:    it writes
things out backwards."  "The system crashed because of    a hardware
bug."  "Fred is a winner, but he has a few bugs"    (i.e., Fred is a
good guy, but he has a few personality problems).

   Historical note: Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer
better known for inventing {COBOL}) liked to tell a story in    which a
technician solved a {glitch} in the Harvard Mark II    machine by
pulling an actual insect out from between the contacts    of one of its
relays, and she subsequently promulgated {bug} in    its hackish sense
as a joke about the incident (though, as she was    careful to admit,
she was not there when it happened).  For many    years the logbook
associated with the incident and the actual bug    in question (a moth)
sat in a display case at the Naval Surface    Warfare Center (NSWC).
The entire story, with a picture of the    logbook and the moth taped
into it, is recorded in the "Annals    of the History of Computing",
Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981),    pp. 285-286.

   The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads "1545
Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
found".  This wording establishes that the term was already    in use
at the time in its current specific sense -- and Hopper    herself
reports that the term `bug' was regularly applied to    problems in
radar electronics during WWII.

   Indeed, the use of `bug' to mean an industrial defect was already
established in Thomas Edison's time, and a more specific and rather
modern use can be found in an electrical handbook from 1896
("Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity", Theo. Audel & Co.)     which
says: "The term `bug' is used to a limited extent to    designate any
fault or trouble in the connections or working of    electric
apparatus."  It further notes that the term is "said to    have
originated in quadruplex telegraphy and have been transferred    to all
electric apparatus."

   The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the
term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which "bugs in    a
telephone cable" were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this
derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory
of a joke first current among _telegraph_ operators more than    a
century ago!

   Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the
term "bug" was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy to
refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would
send a string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the    Vibroplex
keyers (which were among the most common of this type)    even had a
graphic of a beetle on them (and still do)!  While the    ability to
send repeated dots automatically was very useful for    professional
morse code operators, these were also significantly    trickier to use
than the older manual keyers, and it could take    some practice to
ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into    the code by holding
the key down a fraction too long.  In the hands    of an inexperienced
operator, a Vibroplex "bug" on the line could    mean that a lot of
garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.

   Further, the term "bug" has long been used among radio technicians to
  describe a device that converts electromagnetic field variations into
  acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio interference and look
for    dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community usage derives from
the    roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century
physicists.     The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach
body), with the two    wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly
touch forming a spark gap    (roach antennae).  The bug is to the radio
technician what the stethoscope    is to the stereotype medical doctor.
This sense is almost certainly    ancestral to modern use of "bug" for
a covert monitoring device,    but may also have contributed to the use
of "bug" for the effects    of radio interference itself.

   Actually, use of `bug' in the general sense of a disruptive event
goes back to Shakespeare!  (Henry VI, part III - Act V, Scene II:
King Edward: "So, lie thou there. Die thou; and die our fear; For
Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.")  In the first edition of
Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of `bug' is "A frightful
object; a walking spectre"; this is traced to `bugbear', a Welsh
term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the
circle) has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon
through fantasy role-playing games.

   In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects.
Here is a plausible conversation that never actually happened:

   "There is a bug in this ant farm!"

   "What do you mean?  I don't see any ants in it."

   "That's the bug."

   A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a
paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, "Entomology of the Computer Bug:
History and Folklore", American Speech 62(4):376-378.

   [There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved
to the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so
asserted.  A correspondent who thought to check discovered that the
bug was not there.  While investigating this in late 1990, your
editor discovered that the NSWC still had the bug, but had
unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to accept it -- and    that
the present curator of their History of American Technology    Museum
didn't know this and agreed that it would make a worthwhile    exhibit.
It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due to    space and
money constraints was not actually exhibited years    afterwards.
Thus, the process of investigating the    original-computer-bug bug
fixed it in an entirely unexpected way,    by making the myth true!
--ESR]

   :bug-compatible: adj.  [common] Said of a design or    revision that
has been badly compromised by a requirement to be    compatible with
{fossil}s or {misfeature}s in other programs    or (esp.) previous
releases of itself. "MS-DOS 2.0 used \ as a    path separator to be
bug-compatible with some cretin's choice of /    as an option character
in 1.0."

   :bug-for-bug compatible: n.  Same as {bug-compatible}, with    the
additional implication that much tedious effort went into    ensuring
that each (known) bug was replicated.

   :bug-of-the-month club: n.  [from "book-of-the-month    club", a
time-honored mail-order-marketing technique in the U.S.]     A mythical
club which users of `sendmail(8)' (the UNIX mail    daemon) belong to;
this was coined on the Usenet newsgroup    comp.security.unix at a time
when sendmail security holes, which    allowed outside {cracker}s
access to the system, were being    uncovered at an alarming rate,
forcing sysadmins to update very    often.  Also, more completely,
`fatal security bug-of-the-month    club'.

   :buglix: /buhg'liks/ n.  [uncommon] Pejorative term    referring to
{DEC}'s ULTRIX operating system in its earlier    _severely_ buggy
versions.  Still used to describe ULTRIX, but    without nearly so much
venom.  Compare {AIDX}, {HP-SUX},    {Nominal Semidestructor},
{Telerat}, {sun-stools}.

   :bulletproof: adj.  Used of an algorithm or implementation
considered extremely {robust}; lossage-resistant; capable of
correctly recovering from any imaginable exception condition -- a
rare and valued quality.  Implies that the programmer has thought    of
all possible errors, and added {code} to protect against each    one.
Thus, in some cases, this can imply code that is too    heavyweight,
due to excessive paranoia on the part of the    programmer. Syn.
{armor-plated}.

   :bum:  1. vt. To make highly efficient, either in time or    space,
often at the expense of clarity.  "I managed to bum three    more
instructions out of that code."  "I spent half the night    bumming the
interrupt code."  In 1996, this term and the practice it    describes
are semi-obsolete. In {elder days}, John McCarthy    (inventor of
{LISP}) used to compare some efficiency-obsessed    hackers among his
students to "ski bums"; thus, optimization    became "program bumming",
and eventually just "bumming".  2. To    squeeze out excess; to remove
something in order to improve    whatever it was removed from (without
changing function; this    distinguishes the process from a
{featurectomy}).  3. n. A small    change to an algorithm, program, or
hardware device to make it more    efficient.  "This hardware bum makes
the jump instruction    faster."  Usage: now uncommon, largely
superseded by v. {tune}    (and n. {tweak}, {hack}), though none of
these exactly    capture sense 2.  All these uses are rare in
Commonwealth hackish,    because in the parent dialects of English the
noun `bum' is a rude synonym    for `buttocks' and the verb `bum' for
buggery.

   :bump: vt.  Synonym for increment.  Has the same meaning as    C's
++ operator.  Used esp. of counter variables, pointers, and    index
dummies in `for', `while', and `do-while'    loops.

   :burble: v.  [from Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky"] Like    {flame},
but connotes that the source is truly clueless and    ineffectual (mere
flamers can be competent).  A term of deep    contempt.  "There's some
guy on the phone burbling about how he    got a DISK FULL error and
it's all our comm software's fault."     This is mainstream slang in
some parts of England.

   :buried treasure: n.  A surprising piece of code found in some
program.  While usually not wrong, it tends to vary from    {crufty} to
{bletcherous}, and has lain undiscovered only    because it was
functionally correct, however horrible it is.  Used    sarcastically,
because what is found is anything _but_    treasure.  Buried treasure
almost always needs to be dug up and    removed.  "I just found that
the scheduler sorts its queue using    {bubble sort}!  Buried treasure!"

   :burn-in period: n.  1. A factory test designed to catch    systems
with {marginal} components before they get out the door;    the theory
is that burn-in will protect customers by outwaiting the    steepest
part of the {bathtub curve} (see {infant    mortality}).  2. A period
of indeterminate length in which a person    using a computer is so
intensely involved in his project that he    forgets basic needs such
as food, drink, sleep, etc.  Warning:    Excessive burn-in can lead to
burn-out.  See {hack mode},    {larval stage}.

   Historical note:  the origin of "burn-in" (sense 1) is apparently
the practice of setting a new-model airplane's brakes on fire, then
extinguishing the fire, in order to make them hold better.  This was
done on the first version of the U.S. spy-plane, the U-2.

   :burst page: n.  Syn. {banner}, sense 1.

   :busy-wait: vi.  Used of human behavior, conveys that the    subject
is busy waiting for someone or something, intends to move    instantly
as soon as it shows up, and thus cannot do anything else    at the
moment.  "Can't talk now, I'm busy-waiting till Bill gets    off the
phone."

   Technically, `busy-wait' means to wait on an event by    {spin}ning
through a tight or timed-delay loop that polls for    the event on each
pass, as opposed to setting up an interrupt    handler and continuing
execution on another part of the task.  This    is a wasteful
technique, best avoided on time-sharing systems where    a busy-waiting
program may {hog} the processor.

   :buzz: vi.  1. Of a program, to run with no indication of
progress and perhaps without guarantee of ever finishing; esp.     said
of programs thought to be executing tight loops of code.  A    program
that is buzzing appears to be {catatonic}, but never    gets out of
catatonia, while a buzzing loop may eventually end of    its own
accord.  "The program buzzes for about 10 seconds trying    to sort all
the names into order."  See {spin}; see also    {grovel}.  2. [ETA
Systems] To test a wire or printed circuit    trace for continuity by
applying an AC rather than DC signal.  Some    wire faults will pass DC
tests but fail a buzz test.  3. To process    an array or list in
sequence, doing the same thing to each element.     "This loop buzzes
through the tz array looking for a terminator    type."

   :BWQ: /B-W-Q/ n.  [IBM: abbreviation, `Buzz Word Quotient']    The
percentage of buzzwords in a speech or documents.  Usually    roughly
proportional to {bogosity}.  See {TLA}.

   :by hand: adv.  [common] 1. Said of an operation (especially a
repetitive, trivial, and/or tedious one) that ought to be performed
automatically by the computer, but which a hacker instead has to
step tediously through.  "My mailer doesn't have a command to
include the text of the message I'm replying to, so I have to do it
by hand."  This does not necessarily mean the speaker has to    retype
a copy of the message; it might refer to, say, dropping into    a
subshell from the mailer, making a copy of one's mailbox file,
reading that into an editor, locating the top and bottom of the
message in question, deleting the rest of the file, inserting `>'
characters on each line, writing the file, leaving the editor,
returning to the mailer, reading the file in, and later remembering
to delete the file.  Compare {eyeball search}.  2. By extension,
writing code which does something in an explicit or low-level way
for which a presupplied library routine ought to have been
available.  "This cretinous B-tree library doesn't supply a decent
iterator, so I'm having to walk the trees by hand."

   :byte:: /bi:t/ n.  [techspeak] A unit of memory or data equal to
the amount used to represent one character; on modern architectures
this is usually 8 bits, but may be 9 on 36-bit machines.  Some    older
architectures used `byte' for quantities of 6 or 7 bits, and    the
PDP-10 supported `bytes' that were actually bitfields of    1 to 36
bits!  These usages are now obsolete, and even 9-bit bytes    have
become rare in the general trend toward power-of-2 word sizes.

   Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956
during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer;
originally it was described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment    of
the period used 6-bit chunks of information).  The move to an    8-bit
byte happened in late 1956, and this size was later adopted    and
promulgated as a standard by the System/360.  The word was    coined by
mutating the word `bite' so it would not be    accidentally misspelled
as {bit}.  See also {nybble}.

   :byte sex: n.  [common] The byte sex of hardware is    {big-endian}
or {little-endian}; see those entries.

   :bytesexual: /bi:t`sek'shu-*l/ adj.  [rare] Said of    hardware,
denotes willingness to compute or pass data in either    {big-endian}
or {little-endian} format (depending,    presumably, on a {mode bit}
somewhere).  See also {NUXI    problem}.

   :Bzzzt!  Wrong.: /bzt rong/ excl.  [common; Usenet/Internet;
punctuation varies] From a Robin Williams routine in the movie    "Dead
Poets Society" spoofing radio or TV quiz programs, such    as _Truth or
Consequences_, where an incorrect answer earns    one a blast from the
buzzer and condolences from the interlocutor.     A way of expressing
mock-rude disagreement, usually immediately    following an included
quote from another poster.  The less    abbreviated "*Bzzzzt*, wrong,
but thank you for playing" is also    common; capitalization and
emphasis of the buzzer sound varies.

   :C: n.  1. The third letter of the English alphabet.  2. ASCII
1000011.  3. The name of a programming language designed by Dennis
Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement
{{Unix}}; so called because many features derived from an earlier
compiler named `B' in commemoration of _its_ parent, BCPL.     (BCPL
was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived language,    CPL.)
Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing    {C++},
there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should    be
named `D' or `P'.  C became immensely popular outside Bell Labs
after about 1980 and is now the dominant language in systems and
microcomputer applications programming.  See also {languages of
choice}, {indent style}.

   C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain
varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines    all
the elegance and power of assembly language with all the    readability
and maintainability of assembly language".

   :C Programmer's Disease: n.  The tendency of the undisciplined    C
programmer to set arbitrary but supposedly generous static limits    on
table sizes (defined, if you're lucky, by constants in header    files)
rather than taking the trouble to do proper dynamic storage
allocation.  If an application user later needs to put 68 elements
into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer reasons that he    or
she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as much as    70, to
allow for future expansion) and recompile.  This gives the
programmer the comfortable feeling of having made the effort to
satisfy the user's (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the
user multiple opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences    of
{fandango on core}.  In severe cases of the disease, the    programmer
cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only    to further
disgruntle the user.

   :C++: /C'-pluhs-pluhs/ n.  Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup    of AT&T
Bell Labs as a successor to {C}.  Now one of the    {languages of
choice}, although many hackers still grumble that    it is the
successor to either Algol 68 or {Ada} (depending on    generation), and
a prime example of {second-system effect}.     Almost anything that can
be done in any language can be done in    C++, but it requires a
{language lawyer} to know what is and    what is not legal-- the design
is _almost_ too large to hold    in even hackers' heads.  Much of the
{cruft} results from C++'s    attempt to be backward compatible with C.
Stroustrup himself has    said in his retrospective book "The Design
and Evolution of    C++" (p. 207), "Within C++, there is a much smaller
and cleaner    language struggling to get out."  [Many hackers would
now add    "Yes, and it's called {Java}" --ESR]

   :calculator: [Cambridge] n.  Syn. for {bitty box}.

   :Camel Book: n.  Universally recognized nickname for the    book
"Programming Perl", by Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz,    O'Reilly
Associates 1991, ISBN 0-937175-64-1 (second edition 1996,    ISBN
1-56592-149-6).  The definitive reference on    {Perl}.

   :can: vt.  To abort a job on a time-sharing system.  Used    esp.
when the person doing the deed is an operator, as in    "canned from
the {{console}}".  Frequently used in an imperative    sense, as in
"Can that print job, the LPT just popped a    sprocket!"  Synonymous
with {gun}.  It is said that the ASCII    character with mnemonic CAN
(0011000) was used as a kill-job    character on some early OSes.
Alternatively, this term may derive    from mainstream slang `canned'
for being laid off or fired.

   :can't happen:  The traditional program comment for code    executed
under a condition that should never be true, for example a    file size
computed as negative.  Often, such a condition being true    indicates
data corruption or a faulty algorithm; it is almost    always handled
by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or    crashing, since
there is little else that can be done.  Some case    variant of "can't
happen" is also often the text emitted if the    `impossible' error
actually happens!  Although "can't happen"    events are genuinely
infrequent in production code, programmers    wise enough to check for
them habitually are often surprised at how    frequently they are
triggered during development and how many    headaches checking for
them turns out to head off. See also    {firewall code} (sense 2).

   :cancelbot: /kan'sel-bot/  [Usenet: portmanteau, cancel +    robot]
1. Mythically, a {robocanceller}  2. In reality, most    cancelbots are
manually operated by being fed lists of spam message    IDs.

   :Cancelmoose[tm]: /kan'sel-moos/  [Usenet] The archetype and model of
  all good {spam}-fighters. Once upon a time, the 'Moose would send
out spam-cancels and then post notice anonymously to
news.admin.policy, news.admin.misc, and
alt.current-events.net-abuse.  The 'Moose stepped to the fore on    its
own initiative, at a time (mid-1994) when spam-cancels were
irregular and disorganized, and behaved altogether admirably -    fair,
even-handed, and quick to respond to comments and criticism,    all
without self-aggrandizement or martyrdom.  Cancelmoose[tm]    quickly
gained near-unanimous support from the readership of all    three
above-mentioned groups.

   Nobody knows who Cancelmoose[tm] really is, and there aren't even
any good rumors.  However, the 'Moose now has an e-mail address
(<moose@cm.org>) and a web site (`http://www.cm.org'.)

   By early 1995, others had stepped into the spam-cancel business,
and appeared to be comporting themselves well, after the 'Moose's
manner. The 'Moose has now gotten out of the business, and is more
interested in ending spam (and cancels) entirely.

   :candygrammar: n.  A programming-language grammar that is    mostly
{syntactic sugar}; the term is also a play on    `candygram'.  {COBOL},
Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot    of the so-called `4GL'
database languages share this property.     The usual intent of such
designs is that they be as English-like as    possible, on the theory
that they will then be easier for unskilled    people to program.  This
intention comes to grief on the reality    that syntax isn't what makes
programming hard; it's the mental    effort and organization required
to specify an algorithm precisely    that costs.  Thus the invariable
result is that `candygrammar'    languages are just as difficult to
program in as terser ones, and    far more painful for the experienced
hacker.

   [The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
 should not be overlooked.  This was a "Jaws" parody.  Someone
lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to
get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the
background.  The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!"     When
the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor    occupant.
[There is a similar gag in "Blazing Saddles" --ESR]    There is a moral
here for those attracted to candygrammars.  Note    that, in many
circles, pretty much the same ones who remember Monty    Python
sketches, all it takes is the word "Candygram!", suitably    timed, to
get people rolling on the floor. -- GLS]

   :canonical: adj.  [very common; historically, `according    to
religious law'] The usual or standard state or manner of    something.
This word has a somewhat more technical meaning in    mathematics.  Two
formulas such as 9 + x and x + 9    are said to be equivalent because
they mean the same thing, but the    second one is in `canonical form'
because it is written in the    usual way, with the highest power of x
first.  Usually there    are fixed rules you can use to decide whether
something is in    canonical form.  The jargon meaning, a relaxation of
the technical    meaning, acquired its present loading in
computer-science culture    largely through its prominence in Alonzo
Church's work in    computation theory and mathematical logic (see
{Knights of the    Lambda Calculus}).  Compare {vanilla}.

   Non-technical academics do not use the adjective `canonical' in
any of the senses defined above with any regularity; they do    however
use the nouns `canon' and `canonicity' (not    **canonicalness or
**canonicality). The `canon' of a given author    is the complete body
of authentic works by that author (this usage    is familiar to
Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary    scholars).  `_The_
canon' is the body of works in a given    field (e.g., works of
literature, or of art, or of music) deemed    worthwhile for students
to study and for scholars to investigate.

   The word `canon' has an interesting history.  It derives
ultimately from the Greek    `kanon'    (akin to the English `cane')
referring to a reed.  Reeds were used    for measurement, and in Latin
and later Greek the word `canon'    meant a rule or a standard.  The
establishment of a canon of    scriptures within Christianity was meant
to define a standard or a    rule for the religion.  The above
non-techspeak academic usages    stem from this instance of a defined
and accepted body of work.     Alongside this usage was the
promulgation of `canons' (`rules')    for the government of the
Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages    ("according to religious
law") derive from this use of the Latin    `canon'.

   Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob
Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the
incessant use of jargon.  Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS    made
a point of using as much of it as possible in his presence,    and
eventually it began to sink in.  Finally, in one conversation,    he
used the word `canonical' in jargon-like fashion without    thinking.
Steele: "Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon    too!"  Stallman:
"What did he say?"  Steele: "Bob just used    `canonical' in the
canonical way."

   Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
defined as the way _hackers_ normally expect things to be.     Thus, a
hacker may claim with a straight face that `according to    religious
law' is _not_ the canonical meaning of    `canonical'.

   :card walloper: n.  An EDP programmer who grinds out batch
programs that do stupid things like print people's paychecks.
Compare {code grinder}.  See also {{punched card}},    {eighty-column
mind}.

   :careware: /keir'weir/ n.  A variety of {shareware} for    which
either the author suggests that some payment be made to a    nominated
charity or a levy directed to charity is included on top    of the
distribution charge.  Syn. {charityware}; compare    {crippleware},
sense 2.

   :cargo cult programming: n.  A style of (incompetent)    programming
dominated by ritual inclusion of code or program    structures that
serve no real purpose.  A cargo cult programmer    will usually explain
the extra code as a way of working around some    bug encountered in
the past, but usually neither the bug nor the    reason the code
apparently avoided the bug was ever fully    understood (compare
{shotgun debugging}, {voodoo    programming}).

   The term `cargo cult' is a reference to aboriginal religions that
grew up in the South Pacific after World War II.  The practices of
these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and
military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of
the god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the
war.  Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's
characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" in    his
book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" (W. W. Norton    & Co, New
York 1985, ISBN 0-393-01921-7).

   :cascade: n.  1. A huge volume of spurious error-message    output
produced by a compiler with poor error recovery.  Too    frequently,
one trivial syntax error (such as a missing `)' or    `}') throws the
parser out of synch so that much of the remaining    program text is
interpreted as garbaged or ill-formed.  2. A chain    of Usenet
followups, each adding some trivial variation or riposte    to the text
of the previous one, all of which is reproduced in the    new message;
an {include war} in which the object is to create a    sort of communal
graffito.

   :case and paste: n.  [from `cut and paste'] 1. The    addition of a
new {feature} to an existing system by selecting    the code from an
existing feature and pasting it in with minor    changes.  Common in
telephony circles because most operations in a    telephone switch are
selected using `case' statements.  Leads    to {software bloat}.

   In some circles of EMACS users this is called `programming by
Meta-W', because Meta-W is the EMACS command for copying a block of
text to a kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere.
The term is condescending, implying that the programmer is acting
mindlessly rather than thinking carefully about what is required to
integrate the code for two similar cases.

   At {DEC} (now Compaq), this is sometimes called    `clone-and-hack'
coding.

   :casters-up mode: n.  [IBM, prob. fr. slang belly up] Yet    another
synonym for `broken' or `down'.  Usually connotes a    major failure.
A system (hardware or software) which is `down'    may be already being
restarted before the failure is noticed,    whereas one which is
`casters up' is usually a good excuse to    take the rest of the day
off (as long as you're not responsible for    fixing it).

   :casting the runes: n.  What a {guru} does when you ask him    or
her to run a particular program and type at it because it never
works for anyone else; esp. used when nobody can ever see what    the
guru is doing different from what J. Random Luser does.     Compare
{incantation}, {runes}, {examining the entrails};    also see the AI
koan about Tom Knight in "{Some AI Koans}"    (Appendix A).

   A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most
talented systems designers used to be called out occasionally to
service machines which the {field circus} had given up on.     Since he
knew the design inside out, he could often find faults    simply by
listening to a quick outline of the symptoms.  He used to    play on
this by going to some site where the field circus had just    spent the
last two weeks solid trying to find a fault, and    spreading a diagram
of the system out on a table top.  He'd then    shake some chicken
bones and cast them over the diagram, peer at    the bones intently for
a minute, and then tell them that a certain    module needed replacing.
The system would start working again    immediately upon the
replacement.

   :cat: [from `catenate' via {{Unix}} `cat(1)'] vt.     1. [techspeak]
To spew an entire file to the screen or some other    output sink
without pause.  2. By extension, to dump large amounts    of data at an
unprepared target or with no intention of browsing it    carefully.
Usage: considered silly.  Rare outside Unix sites.  See    also {dd},
{BLT}.

   Among Unix fans, `cat(1)' is considered an excellent example    of
user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents    without
such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and    because
it does not require the files to consist of lines of text,    but works
with any sort of data.

   Among Unix haters, `cat(1)' is considered the {canonical}    example
of _bad_ user-interface design, because of its    woefully unobvious
name.  It is far more often used to {blast} a    file to standard
output than to concatenate two files.  The name    `cat' for the former
operation is just as unintuitive as, say,    LISP's {cdr}.

   Of such oppositions are {holy wars} made....

   :catatonic: adj.  Describes a condition of suspended animation    in
which something is so {wedged} or {hung} that it makes no    response.
If you are typing on a terminal and suddenly the    computer doesn't
even echo the letters back to the screen as you    type, let alone do
what you're asking it to do, then the computer    is suffering from
catatonia (possibly because it has crashed).     "There I was in the
middle of a winning game of {nethack} and    it went catatonic on me!
Aaargh!" Compare {buzz}.

   :cathedral: n.,adj.  [see {bazaar} for derivation] The
`classical' mode of software engineering long thought to be
necessarily implied by {Brooks's Law}.  Features small teams,    tight
project control, and long release intervals.  This term came    into
use after analysis of the Linux experience suggested there    might be
something wrong (or at least incomplete) in the classical
assumptions.

   :cd tilde: /C-D til-d*/ vi.  To go home.  From the Unix    C-shell
and Korn-shell command `cd ~', which takes one to    one's `$HOME'
(`cd' with no arguments happens to do the    same thing).  By
extension, may be used with other arguments; thus,    over an
electronic chat link, `cd ~coffee' would mean "I'm    going to the
coffee machine."

   :CDA: /C-D-A/   The "Communications Decency Act" of 1996,    passed
on {Black Thursday} as section 502 of a major    telecommunications
reform bill. The CDA made it a federal crime in    the USA to send a
communication which is "obscene,    lewd, lascivious, filthy, or
indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse,    threaten, or harass another
person." It also threatened with    imprisonment anyone who "knowingly"
makes accessible to minors    any message that "describes, in terms
patently offensive as    measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory    activities or organs".

   While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the
putative evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the
bill were laid bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to    outlaw
discussion of abortion on the Internet.

   To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech
rights was not well received on the Internet would be putting it
mildly.  A firestorm of protest followed, including a February 29th
mass demonstration by thousands of netters who turned their    {home
page}s black for 48 hours.  Several civil-rights groups    and
computing/telecommunications companies mounted a constitutional
challenge.  The CDA was demolished by a strongly-worded decision
handed down on in 8th-circuit Federal court and subsequently
affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court on 26 June 1997 (`White
Thursday'). See also {Exon}.

   :cdr: /ku'dr/ or /kuh'dr/ vt.  [from LISP] To skip past    the first
item from a list of things (generalized from the LISP    operation on
binary tree structures, which returns a list    consisting of all but
the first element of its argument).  In the    form `cdr down', to
trace down a list of elements: "Shall we cdr    down the agenda?"
Usage: silly.  See also {loop through}.

   Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 704 that hosted
the original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called
the `address' and `decrement' parts.  The term `cdr' was originally
`Contents of Decrement part of Register'.  Similarly, `car' stood
for `Contents of Address part of Register'.

   The cdr and car operations have since become bases for    formation
of compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts.  GLS recalls,    for
example, a programming project in which strings were    represented as
linked lists; the get-character and skip-character    operations were
of course called CHAR and CHDR.

   :chad: /chad/ n.  1. [common] The perforated edge strips    on
printer paper, after they have been separated from the printed
portion.  Also called {selvage}, {perf}, and {ripoff}.     2. obs. The
confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or    paper tape; this
has also been called `chaff', `computer    confetti', and `keypunch
droppings'.  It's reported that this was    very old Army slang, and it
may now be mainstream; it has been    reported seen (1993) in
directions for a card-based voting machine    in California.

   Historical note: One correspondent believes `chad' (sense 2)
derives from the Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which
cut little u-shaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab
folded back, rather than punching out a circle/rectangle; it was
clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make them, then the    stuff
that other keypunches made had to be `chad'.  There is a    legend that
the word was originally acronymic, standing for    "Card Hole Aggregate
Debris", but this has all the earmarks of    a {backronym}.

   :chad box: n.  A metal box about the size of a lunchbox (or in
some models a large wastebasket), for collecting the {chad}    (sense
2) that accumulated in {Iron Age} card punches.  You had    to open the
covers of the card punch periodically and empty the    chad box.  The
{bit bucket} was notionally the equivalent device    in the CPU
enclosure, which was typically across the room in    another great
gray-and-blue box.

   :chain:  1. vi. [orig. from BASIC's `CHAIN' statement]    To hand
off execution to a child or successor without going    through the {OS}
command interpreter that invoked it.  The state    of the parent
program is lost and there is no returning to it.     Though this
facility used to be common on memory-limited micros and    is still
widely supported for backward compatibility, the jargon    usage is
semi-obsolescent; in particular, most Unix programmers    will think of
this as an {exec}.  Oppose the more modern    `subshell'.  2. n. A
series of linked data areas within an    operating system or
application.  `Chain rattling' is the process    of repeatedly running
through the linked data areas searching for    one which is of interest
to the executing program.  The implication    is that there is a very
large number of links on the chain.

   :channel: n.  [IRC] The basic unit of discussion on    {IRC}.  Once
one joins a channel, everything one types is read    by others on that
channel.  Channels are named with strings that    begin with a `#' sign
and can have topic descriptions (which are    generally irrelevant to
the actual subject of discussion).  Some    notable channels are
`#initgame', `#hottub',    `callahans', and `#report'.  At times of
international    crisis, `#report' has hundreds of members, some of
whom take    turns listening to various news services and typing in
summaries of    the news, or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts
of the    action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the
Gulf War    in 1991).

   :channel hopping: n.  [common; IRC, GEnie] To rapidly    switch
channels on {IRC}, or a GEnie chat board, just as a    social butterfly
might hop from one group to another at a party.     This term may
derive from the TV watcher's idiom, `channel    surfing'.

   :channel op: /chan'l op/ n.  [IRC] Someone who is endowed    with
privileges on a particular {IRC} channel; commonly    abbreviated
`chanop' or `CHOP'.  These privileges include the    right to {kick}
users, to change various status bits, and to    make others into CHOPs.

   :chanop: /chan'-op/ n.  [IRC] See {channel op}.

   :char: /keir/ or /char/; rarely, /kar/ n.  Shorthand for
`character'.  Esp. used by C programmers, as `char' is C's    typename
for character data.

   :charityware: /cha'rit-ee-weir`/ n.  Syn. {careware}.

   :chase pointers:  1. vi. To go through multiple levels of
indirection, as in traversing a linked list or graph structure.
Used esp. by programmers in C, where explicit pointers are a very
common data type.  This is techspeak, but it remains jargon when
used of human networks.  "I'm chasing pointers.  Bob said you    could
tell me who to talk to about...." See {dangling    pointer} and {snap}.
2. [Cambridge] `pointer chase' or    `pointer hunt': The process of
going through a {core dump}    (sense 1), interactively or on a large
piece of paper printed with    hex {runes}, following dynamic
data-structures.  Used only in a    debugging context.

   :chawmp: n.  [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a
machine word).  This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late
1970s/early 1980s; it is said to have been archaic then, and may    now
be obsolete.  It was coined in revolt against the promiscuous    use of
`word' for anything between 16 and 32 bits; `word' has    an additional
special meaning for FORTH hacks that made the    overloading
intolerable.  For similar reasons, /gaw'bl/ (spelled    `gawble' or
possibly `gawbul') was in use as a term for 32 or    48 bits
(presumably a full machine word, but our sources are    unclear on
this).  These terms are more easily understood if one    thinks of them
as faithful phonetic spellings of `chomp' and    `gobble' pronounced in
a Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect.     For general discussion of
similar terms, see {nybble}.

   :check: n.  A hardware-detected error condition, most commonly
used to refer to actual hardware failures rather than
software-induced traps.  E.g., a `parity check' is the result of    a
hardware-detected parity error.  Recorded here because the word
often humorously extended to non-technical problems. For example,
the term `child check' has been used to refer to the problems    caused
by a small child who is curious to know what happens when    s/he
presses all the cute buttons on a computer's console (of    course,
this particular problem could have been prevented with
{molly-guard}s).

   :chemist: n.  [Cambridge] Someone who wastes computer time    on
{number-crunching} when you'd far rather the machine were    doing
something more productive, such as working out anagrams of    your name
or printing Snoopy calendars or running {life}    patterns.  May or may
not refer to someone who actually studies    chemistry.

   :Chernobyl chicken: n.  See {laser chicken}.

   :Chernobyl packet: /cher-noh'b*l pak'*t/ n.  A network    packet
that induces a {broadcast storm} and/or {network    meltdown}, in
memory of the April 1986 nuclear accident at    Chernobyl in Ukraine.
The typical scenario involves an IP Ethernet    datagram that passes
through a gateway with both source and    destination Ether and IP
address set as the respective broadcast    addresses for the
subnetworks being gated between.  Compare    {Christmas tree packet}.

   :chicken head: n.  [Commodore] The Commodore Business    Machines
logo, which strongly resembles a poultry part.  Rendered    in ASCII as
`C='.  With the arguable exception of the Amiga (see    {amoeba}),
Commodore's machines are notoriously crocky little    {bitty box}es
(see also {PETSCII}).  Thus, this usage may owe    something to Philip
K. Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of    Electric Sheep?"  (the basis
for the movie "Blade Runner"; the    novel is now sold under that
title), in which a `chickenhead' is    a mutant with below-average
intelligence.

   :chiclet keyboard: n.  A keyboard with a small, flat    rectangular
or lozenge-shaped rubber or plastic keys that look like    pieces of
chewing gum.  (Chiclets is the brand name of a variety of    chewing
gum that does in fact resemble the keys of chiclet    keyboards.)  Used
esp. to describe the original IBM PCjr    keyboard.  Vendors
unanimously liked these because they were cheap,    and a lot of early
portable and laptop products got launched using    them.  Customers
rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity, and    chiclets are not
often seen on anything larger than a digital watch    any more.

   :Chinese Army technique: n.  Syn. {Mongolian Hordes    technique}.

   :choad: /chohd/ n.  Synonym for `penis' used in    alt.tasteless and
popularized by the denizens thereof.  They    say: "We think maybe it's
from Middle English but we're all too    damned lazy to check the OED."
[I'm not.  It isn't. --ESR] This    term is alleged to have been
inherited through 1960s underground    comics, and to have been
recently sighted in the Beavis and    Butthead cartoons.  Speakers of
the Hindi, Bengali and Gujarati    languages have confirmed that
`choad' is in fact an Indian    vernacular word equivalent to `fuck';
it is therefore likely to    have entered English slang via the British
Raj.

   :choke: v.  1. [common] To reject input, often    ungracefully.
"NULs make System V's `lpr(1)' choke."  "I    tried building an {EMACS}
binary to use {X}, but    `cpp(1)' choked on all those `#define's."  See
  {barf}, {gag}, {vi}.  2. [MIT] More generally, to fail at    any
endeavor, but with some flair or bravado; the popular    definition is
"to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory."

   :chomp: vi.  1. To {lose}; specifically, to chew on something    of
which more was bitten off than one can.  Probably related to
gnashing of teeth.  2. To bite the bag; See {bagbiter}.

   A hand gesture commonly accompanies this.  To perform it, hold the
four fingers together and place the thumb against their tips.  Now
open and close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much
like what Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this
pantomime seems to predate that).  The gesture alone means `chomp
chomp' (see "{Verb Doubling}" in the "{Jargon    Construction}" section
of the Prependices).  The hand may be    pointed at the object of
complaint, and for real emphasis you can    use both hands at once.
Doing this to a person is equivalent to    saying "You chomper!"  If
you point the gesture at yourself, it    is a humble but humorous
admission of some failure.  You might do    this if someone told you
that a program you had written had failed    in some surprising way and
you felt dumb for not having anticipated    it.

   :chomper: n.  Someone or something that is chomping; a loser.
See {loser}, {bagbiter}, {chomp}.

   :CHOP: /chop/ n.  [IRC] See {channel op}.

   :Christmas tree: n.  A kind of RS-232 line tester or breakout    box
featuring rows of blinking red and green LEDs suggestive of
Christmas lights.

   :Christmas tree packet: n.  A packet with every single    option set
for whatever protocol is in use.  See {kamikaze    packet}, {Chernobyl
packet}.  (The term doubtless derives from a    fanciful image of each
little option bit being represented by a    different-colored light
bulb, all turned on.) Compare    {Godzillagram}.

   :chrome: n.  [from automotive slang via wargaming] Showy features
added to attract users but contributing little or nothing to    the
power of a system.  "The 3D icons in Motif are just chrome,    but they
certainly are _pretty_ chrome!"  Distinguished from    {bells and
whistles} by the fact that the latter are usually    added to gratify
developers' own desires for featurefulness.     Often used as a term of
contempt.

   :chug: vi.  To run slowly; to {grind} or {grovel}.     "The disk is
chugging like crazy."

   :Church of the SubGenius: n.  A mutant offshoot of
{Discordianism} launched in 1981 as a spoof of fundamentalist
Christianity by the `Reverend' Ivan Stang, a brilliant satirist    with
a gift for promotion.  Popular among hackers as a rich source    of
bizarre imagery and references such as "Bob" the divine
drilling-equipment salesman, the Benevolent Space Xists, and the
Stark Fist of Removal.  Much SubGenius theory is concerned with the
acquisition of the mystical substance or quality of {slack}.

   :Cinderella Book: [CMU] n.  "Introduction to Automata    Theory,
Languages, and Computation", by John Hopcroft and Jeffrey    Ullman,
(Addison-Wesley, 1979).  So called because the cover    depicts a girl
(putatively Cinderella) sitting in front of a Rube    Goldberg device
and holding a rope coming out of it.  On the back    cover, the device
is in shambles after she has (inevitably) pulled    on the rope.  See
also {{book titles}}.

   :CI$: // n.  Hackerism for `CIS', CompuServe Information    Service.
The dollar sign refers to CompuServe's rather steep line    charges.
Often used in {sig block}s just before a CompuServe    address.  Syn.
{Compu$erve}.

   :Classic C: /klas'ik C/ n.  [a play on `Coke Classic']    The C
programming language as defined in the first edition of    {K&R}, with
some small additions.  It is also known as `K&R C'.     The name came
into use while C was being standardized by the ANSI    X3J11 committee.
Also `C Classic'.

   An analogous construction is sometimes applied elsewhere: thus,
`X Classic', where X = Star Trek (referring to the original TV
series) or X = PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed    to
the PS/2 series).  This construction is especially used of    product
series in which the newer versions are considered serious    losers
relative to the older ones.

   :clean: 1. adj.  Used of hardware or software designs, implies
`elegance in the small', that is, a design or implementation that
may not hold any surprises but does things in a way that is
reasonably intuitive and relatively easy to comprehend from the
outside.  The antonym is `grungy' or {crufty}.  2. v. To    remove
unneeded or undesired files in a effort to reduce clutter:    "I'm
cleaning up my account."  "I cleaned up the garbage and now    have 100
Meg free on that partition."

   :CLM: /C-L-M/  [Sun: `Career Limiting Move'] 1. n. An action
endangering one's future prospects of getting plum projects and
raises, and possibly one's job: "His Halloween costume was a    parody
of his manager.  He won the prize for `best CLM'."  2. adj.     Denotes
extreme severity of a bug, discovered by a customer and    obviously
missed earlier because of poor testing: "That's a CLM    bug!"

   :clobber: vt.  To overwrite, usually unintentionally: "I    walked
off the end of the array and clobbered the stack."  Compare    {mung},
{scribble}, {trash}, and {smash the stack}.

   :clock:  1. n 1. [techspeak] The master oscillator that    steps a
CPU or other digital circuit through its paces. This has    nothing to
do with the time of day, although the software counter    that keeps
track of the latter may be derived from the    former. 2. vt.  To run a
CPU or other digital circuit at a    particular rate. "If you clock it
at 100MHz, it gets warm.".  See    {overclock}.  3. vt. To force a
digital circuit from one    state to the next by applying a single
clock pulse. "The data must    be stable 10ns before you clock the
latch."

   :clocks: n.  Processor logic cycles, so called because each
generally corresponds to one clock pulse in the processor's timing.
The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are
usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a
second; one good reason for this is that clock speeds for various
models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it    is
usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing    the
instruction set.  Compare {cycle}, {jiffy}.

   :clone: n.  1. An exact duplicate: "Our product is a clone of
their product."  Implies a legal reimplementation from    documentation
or by reverse-engineering.  Also connotes lower    price.  2. A shoddy,
spurious copy: "Their product is a clone of    our product."  3. A
blatant ripoff, most likely violating    copyright, patent, or trade
secret protections: "Your product is a    clone of my product."  This
use implies legal action is pending.     4. `PC clone:' a PC-BUS/ISA or
EISA-compatible 80x86-based    microcomputer (this use is sometimes
spelled `klone' or    `PClone').  These invariably have much more bang
for the buck    than the IBM archetypes they resemble.  5. In the
construction    `Unix clone': An OS designed to deliver a Unix-lookalike
  environment without Unix license fees, or with additional
`mission-critical' features such as support for real-time
programming.  6. v. To make an exact copy of something.  "Let me
clone that" might mean "I want to borrow that paper so I can make    a
photocopy" or "Let me get a copy of that file before you    {mung} it".

   :clone-and-hack coding: n.  [DEC] Syn. {case and paste}.

   :clover key: n.  [Mac users] See {feature key}.

   :clue-by-four:  [Usenet: portmanteau, clue + two-by-four] The
notional stick with which one whacks an aggressively clueless
person.  This term derives from a western American folk saying    about
training a mule "First, you got to hit him with a    two-by-four.
That's to get his attention." The clue-by-four is a    close relative
of the {LART}.

   :clustergeeking: /kluh'st*r-gee`king/ n.  [CMU] Spending    more
time at a computer cluster doing CS homework than most people    spend
breathing.

   :coaster: n.  1. Unuseable CD produced during failed attempt    at
writing to writeable or re-writeable CD media.  Certainly    related to
the coaster-like shape of a CD, and the relative value    of these
failures.  "I made a lot of coasters before I got a good    CD." 2.
Useless CDs received in the mail from the likes of    AOL, MSN, CI$,
Prodigy, ad nauseam.

   :COBOL: /koh'bol/ n.  [COmmon Business-Oriented Language]
(Synonymous with {evil}.)  A weak, verbose, and flabby language    used
by {card walloper}s to do boring mindless things on    {dinosaur}
mainframes.  Hackers believe that all COBOL    programmers are {suit}s
or {code grinder}s, and no    self-respecting hacker will ever admit to
having learned the    language.  Its very name is seldom uttered
without ritual    expressions of disgust or horror.  One popular one is
Edsger W.     Dijkstra's famous observation that "The use of COBOL
cripples the    mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a
criminal    offense." (from "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal
  Perspective") See also {fear and loathing}, {software    rot}.

   :COBOL fingers: /koh'bol fing'grz/ n.  Reported from Sweden,    a
(hypothetical) disease one might get from coding in COBOL.  The
language requires code verbose beyond all reason (see
{candygrammar}); thus it is alleged that programming too much in
COBOL causes one's fingers to wear down to stubs by the endless
typing.  "I refuse to type in all that source code again; it would
give me COBOL fingers!"

   :cobweb site: n.  A World Wide Web Site that hasn't been    updated
so long it has figuratively grown cobwebs.

   :code: n.  The stuff that software writers write, either    in
source form or after translation by a compiler or assembler.     Often
used in opposition to "data", which is the stuff that code    operates
on.  This is a mass noun, as in "How much code does it    take to do a
{bubble sort}?", or "The code is loaded at the    high end of RAM."
Anyone referring to software as "the software    codes" is probably a
{newbie} or a {suit}.

   :code grinder: n.  1. A {suit}-wearing minion of the sort    hired
in legion strength by banks and insurance companies to    implement
payroll packages in RPG and other such unspeakable    horrors.  In its
native habitat, the code grinder often removes the    suit jacket to
reveal an underplumage consisting of button-down    shirt (starch
optional) and a tie.  In times of dire stress, the    sleeves (if long)
may be rolled up and the tie loosened about half    an inch.  It seldom
helps.  The {code grinder}'s milieu is about    as far from hackerdom
as one can get and still touch a computer;    the term connotes pity.
See {Real World}, {suit}.  2. Used    of or to a hacker, a really
serious slur on the person's creative    ability; connotes a design
style characterized by primitive    technique, rule-boundedness, {brute
force}, and utter lack of    imagination.  Compare {card walloper};
contrast {hacker},    {Real Programmer}.

   :Code of the Geeks: n.  see {geek code}.

   :code police: n.  [by analogy with George Orwell's `thought
police'] A mythical team of Gestapo-like storm troopers that might
burst into one's office and arrest one for violating programming
style rules.  May be used either seriously, to underline a claim
that a particular style violation is dangerous, or ironically, to
suggest that the practice under discussion is condemned mainly by
anal-retentive {weenie}s.  "Dike out that goto or the code    police
will get you!"  The ironic usage is perhaps more common.

   :codes: n.  [scientific computing] Programs.  This usage is common
in people who hack supercomputers and heavy-duty
{number-crunching}, rare to unknown elsewhere (if you say    "codes" to
hackers outside scientific computing, their    first association is
likely to be "and cyphers").

   :codewalker: n.  A program component that traverses other
programs for a living.  Compilers have codewalkers in their front
ends; so do cross-reference generators and some database front    ends.
Other utility programs that try to do too much with source    code may
turn into codewalkers.  As in "This new `vgrind'    feature would
require a codewalker to implement."

   :coefficient of X: n.  Hackish speech makes heavy use of
pseudo-mathematical metaphors.  Four particularly important    ones
involve the terms `coefficient', `factor', `index of X', and
`quotient'.  They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions
among them that convey information about the way the speaker
mentally models whatever he or she is describing.

   `Foo factor' and `foo quotient' tend to describe something for
which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical
example is {fudge factor}.  It's not important how much you're
fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.
You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.     Quotient
tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two    opposing factors:
"I would have won except for my luck quotient."     This could also be
"I would have won except for the luck factor",    but using _quotient_
emphasizes that it was bad luck    overpowering good luck (or someone
else's good luck overpowering    your own).

   `Foo index' and `coefficient of foo' both tend to imply    that foo
is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that    can be
larger or smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or    person as
having a `high bogosity index', whereas you would be less    likely to
speak of a `high bogosity factor'.  `Foo index' suggests    that foo is
a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane    cost-of-living
index; `coefficient of foo' suggests that foo is a    fundamental
quantity, as in a coefficient of friction.  The choice    between these
terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some    people might
feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus    say
`coefficient of bogosity', whereas others might feel it is a
combination of factors and thus say `bogosity index'.

   :cokebottle: /kohk'bot-l/ n.  Any very unusual character,
particularly one you can't type because it isn't on your    keyboard.
MIT people used to complain about the    `control-meta-cokebottle'
commands at SAIL, and SAIL people    complained right back about the
`escape-escape-cokebottle'    commands at MIT.  After the demise of the
{space-cadet    keyboard}, `cokebottle' faded away as serious usage,
but was    often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird
or    non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due for a second
inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager, `mwm(1)', has    a
reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of    keybindings
and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not)
`control-meta-bang' (see {bang}).  Since the exclamation point    looks
a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have    begun
referring to this keystroke as `cokebottle'.  See also    {quadruple
bucky}.

   :cold boot: n.  See {boot}.

   :COME FROM: n.  A semi-mythical language construct dual to the
`go to'; `COME FROM' <label> would cause the referenced label    to act
as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever reached    it
control would quietly and {automagically} be transferred to    the
statement following the `COME FROM'.  `COME FROM'    was first proposed
in R. Lawrence Clark's "A Linguistic    Contribution to GOTO-less
programming", which appeared in a 1973    {Datamation} issue (and was
reprinted in the April 1984 issue of    "Communications of the ACM").
This parodied the then-raging    `structured programming' {holy wars}
(see {considered    harmful}).  Mythically, some variants are the
`assigned COME    FROM' and the `computed COME FROM' (parodying some
nasty control    constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of
course,    multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by
having    more than one `COME FROM' statement coming from the same
label.

   In some ways the FORTRAN `DO' looks like a `COME FROM'    statement.
After the terminating statement number/`CONTINUE'    is reached,
control continues at the statement following the DO.     Some generous
FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than    `CONTINUE')
for the statement, leading to examples like:

           DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
     C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
     C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
           WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
      10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)

in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.     (This
is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear    to have
anything to do with the flow of control at all!)

   While sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this
form of `COME FROM' statement isn't completely general.  After    all,
control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN,    ca.
1975 (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040    ten
years earlier).  The statement `AT 100' would perform a    `COME FROM
100'.  It was intended strictly as a debugging aid,    with dire
consequences promised to anyone so deranged as to use it    in
production code.  More horrible things had already been    perpetrated
in production languages, however; doubters need only    contemplate the
`ALTER' verb in {COBOL}.

   `COME FROM' was supported under its own name for the first    time
15 years later, in C-INTERCAL (see {INTERCAL},    {retrocomputing});
knowledgeable observers are still reeling    from the shock.

   :comm mode: /kom mohd/ n.  [ITS: from the feature supporting
on-line chat; the term may spelled with one or two m's] Syn. for
{talk mode}.

   :command key: n.  [Mac users] Syn. {feature key}.

   :comment out: vt.  To surround a section of code with comment
delimiters or to prefix every line in the section with a comment
marker; this prevents it from being compiled or interpreted.  Often
done when the code is redundant or obsolete, but is being left in
the source to make the intent of the active code clearer; also when
the code in that section is broken and you want to bypass it in
order to debug some other part of the code.  Compare {condition
out}, usually the preferred technique in languages (such as {C})
that make it possible.

   :Commonwealth Hackish:: n.  Hacker jargon as spoken in    English
outside the U.S., esp. in the British Commonwealth.  It    is reported
that Commonwealth speakers are more likely to pronounce    truncations
like `char' and `soc', etc., as spelled (/char/,    /sok/), as opposed
to American /keir/ and /sohsh/.  Dots in    {newsgroup} names
(especially two-component names) tend to be    pronounced more often
(so soc.wibble is /sok dot wib'l/ rather    than /sohsh wib'l/).  The
prefix {meta} may be pronounced    /mee't*/; similarly, Greek letter
beta is usually /bee't*/,    zeta is usually /zee't*/, and so forth.
Preferred    {metasyntactic variable}s include {blurgle}, `eek',
`ook', `frodo', and `bilbo'; {wibble},    `wobble', and in emergencies
`wubble'; `flob',    `banana', `tom', `dick', `harry',    `wombat',
`frog', {fish}, {womble} and so on and on    (see {foo}, sense 4).

   Alternatives to verb doubling include suffixes `-o-rama',
`frenzy' (as in feeding frenzy), and `city' (examples: "barf    city!"
"hack-o-rama!"  "core dump frenzy!").  Finally, note    that the
American terms `parens', `brackets', and `braces' for (),    [], and {}
are uncommon; Commonwealth hackish prefers    `brackets', `square
brackets', and `curly brackets'.  Also, the    use of `pling' for
{bang} is common outside the United States.

   See also {attoparsec}, {calculator}, {chemist},    {console jockey},
{fish}, {go-faster stripes},    {grunge}, {hakspek}, {heavy metal},
{leaky heap},    {lord high fixer}, {loose bytes}, {muddie}, {nadger},
 {noddy}, {psychedelicware}, {plingnet}, {raster    blaster}, {RTBM},
{seggie}, {spod}, {sun lounge},    {terminal junkie}, {tick-list
features}, {weeble},    {weasel}, {YABA}, and notes or definitions
under {Bad    Thing}, {barf}, {bogus}, {bum}, {chase pointers},
{cosmic rays}, {crippleware}, {crunch}, {dodgy},    {gonk}, {hamster},
{hardwarily}, {mess-dos},    {nybble}, {proglet}, {root}, {SEX},
{tweak},    {womble}, and {xyzzy}.

   :compact: adj.  Of a design, describes the valuable property    that
it can all be apprehended at once in one's head.  This    generally
means the thing created from the design can be used with    greater
facility and fewer errors than an equivalent tool that is    not
compact.  Compactness does not imply triviality or lack of    power;
for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is more    powerful
than FORTRAN.  Designs become non-compact through    accreting
{feature}s and {cruft} that don't merge cleanly    into the overall
design scheme (thus, some fans of {Classic C}    maintain that ANSI C
is no longer compact).

   :compiler jock: n.  See {jock} (sense 2).

   :compo: n.  [{demoscene}] Finnish-originated slang for
`competition'. Demo compos are held at a {demoparty}. The usual
protocol is that several groups make demos for a compo, they are
shown on a big screen, and then the party participants vote for the
best one. Prizes (from sponsors and party entrance fees) are    given.
Standard compo formats include {intro} compos (4k or 64k    demos),
music compos, graphics compos, quick {demo} compos    (build a demo
within 4 hours for example), etc.

   :compress: [Unix] vt.  When used without a qualifier,    generally
refers to {crunch}ing of a file using a particular C    implementation
of compression by Joseph M. Orost et al. and widely    circulated via
{Usenet}; use of {crunch} itself in this sense    is rare among Unix
hackers.  Specifically, compress is built around    the
Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm as described in "A Technique for    High
Performance Data Compression", Terry A. Welch, "IEEE    Computer", vol.
17, no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19.

   :Compu$erve: n.  See {CI$}.  Synonyms CompuSpend and    Compu$pend
are also reported.

   :computer confetti: n.  Syn. {chad}.  Though this term is    common,
this use of punched-card chad is not a good idea, as the    pieces are
stiff and have sharp corners that could injure the eyes.     GLS
reports that he once attended a wedding at MIT during which he    and a
few other guests enthusiastically threw chad instead of    rice. The
groom later grumbled that he and his bride had spent most    of the
evening trying to get the stuff out of their hair.

   :computer geek: n.  1. One who eats (computer) bugs for a    living.
One who fulfills all the dreariest negative stereotypes    about
hackers: an asocial, malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with    all the
personality of a cheese grater.  Cannot be used by    outsiders without
implied insult to all hackers; compare    black-on-black vs.
white-on-black usage of `nigger'.  A computer    geek may be either a
fundamentally clueless individual or a    proto-hacker in {larval
stage}.  Also called `turbo nerd',    `turbo geek'.  See also
{propeller head}, {clustergeeking},    {geek out}, {wannabee},
{terminal junkie}, {spod},    {weenie}.  2. Some self-described
computer geeks use this term    in a positive sense and protest sense 1
(this seems to have    been a post-1990 development).  For one such
argument, see    `http://samsara.circus.com/~omni/geek.html'. See also
 {geek code}.

   :computron: /kom'pyoo-tron`/  n. 1. [common] A notional    unit of
computing power combining instruction speed and storage    capacity,
dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second times
megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage.  "That
machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have enough computrons!"
This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power
as a fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel
horsepower.  See {bitty box}, {Get a real computer!},    {toy},
{crank}.  2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears    the unit
quantity of computation or information, in much the same    way that an
electron bears one unit of electric charge (see also    {bogon}).  An
elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons    has been developed
based on the physical fact that the molecules in    a solid object move
more rapidly as it is heated.  It is argued    that an object melts
because the molecules have lost their    information about where they
are supposed to be (that is, they have    emitted computrons).  This
explains why computers get so hot and    require air conditioning; they
use up computrons.  Conversely, it    should be possible to cool down
an object by placing it in the path    of a computron beam.  It is
believed that this may also explain why    machines that work at the
factory fail in the computer room: the    computrons there have been
all used up by the other hardware.  (The    popularity of this theory
probably owes something to the    "Warlock" stories by Larry Niven, the
best known being    "What Good is a Glass Dagger?", in which magic is
fueled by    an exhaustible natural resource called `mana'.)

   :con:  n.  [from SF fandom] A science-fiction convention.  Not
used of other sorts of conventions, such as professional meetings.
This term, unlike many others of SF-fan slang, is widely recognized
even by hackers who aren't {fan}s. "We'd been corresponding on    the
net for months, then we met face-to-face at a con."

   :condition out: vt.  To prevent a section of code from being
compiled by surrounding it with a conditional-compilation directive
whose condition is always false.  The {canonical} examples of    these
directives are `#if 0' (or `#ifdef notdef', though    some find the
latter {bletcherous}) and `#endif' in C.     Compare {comment out}.

   :condom: n.  1. The protective plastic bag that accompanies
3.5-inch microfloppy diskettes.  Rarely, also used of (paper) disk
envelopes.  Unlike the write protect tab, the condom (when left on)
not only impedes the practice of {SEX} but has also been shown    to
have a high failure rate as drive mechanisms attempt to access    the
disk -- and can even fatally frustrate insertion.  2. The    protective
cladding on a {light pipe}.  3. `keyboard condom':    A flexible,
transparent plastic cover for a keyboard, designed to    provide some
protection against dust and {programming fluid}    without impeding
typing.  4. `elephant condom': the plastic    shipping bags used inside
cardboard boxes to protect hardware in    transit.  5. n. obs. A dummy
directory `/usr/tmp/sh', created    to foil the {Great Worm} by
exploiting a portability bug in one    of its parts.  So named in the
title of a comp.risks article by    Gene Spafford during the Worm
crisis, and again in the text of    "The Internet Worm Program: An
Analysis", Purdue Technical    Report CSD-TR-823.

   :confuser: n.  Common soundalike slang for `computer'.     Usually
encountered in compounds such as `confuser room',    `personal
confuser', `confuser guru'.  Usage: silly.

   :connector conspiracy: n.  [probably came into prominence with
the appearance of the KL-10 (one model of the {PDP-10}), none of
whose connectors matched anything else] The tendency of
manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of
anything) to come up with new products that don't fit together with
the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or
expensive interface devices.  The KL-10 Massbus connector was
actually _patented_ by {DEC}, which reputedly refused to    license the
design and thus effectively locked third parties out of    competition
for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market.  This    policy is a
source of never-ending frustration for the diehards who    maintain
older PDP-10 or VAX systems.  Their CPUs work fine, but    they are
stuck with dying, obsolescent disk and tape drives with    low capacity
and high power requirements.

   (A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly different intent, is
 the habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw heads so that
only Designated Persons, possessing the magic screwdrivers, can
remove covers and make repairs or install options.  A good 1990s
example is the use of Torx screws for cable-TV set-top boxes.     Older
Apple Macintoshes took this one step further, requiring not    only a
long Torx screwdriver but a specialized case-cracking tool    to open
the box.)

   In these latter days of open-systems computing this term has fallen
 somewhat into disuse, to be replaced by the observation that
"Standards are great!  There are so many of them to choose    from!"
Compare {backward combatability}.

   :cons: /konz/ or /kons/  [from LISP] 1. vt. To add a new    element
to a specified list, esp. at the top.  "OK, cons picking    a
replacement for the console TTY onto the agenda."  2. `cons    up': vt.
To synthesize from smaller pieces: "to cons up an    example".

   In LISP itself, `cons' is the most fundamental operation for
building structures.  It takes any two objects and returns a
`dot-pair' or two-branched tree with one object hanging from each
branch.  Because the result of a cons is an object, it can be used
to build binary trees of any shape and complexity.  Hackers think    of
it as a sort of universal constructor, and that is where the    jargon
meanings spring from.

   :considered harmful: adj.  [very common] Edsger    W. Dijkstra's
note in the March 1968 "Communications of the    ACM", "Goto Statement
Considered Harmful", fired the first    salvo in the structured
programming wars (text at    `http://www.acm.org/classics').
Amusingly, the ACM considered    the resulting acrimony sufficiently
harmful that it will (by    policy) no longer print an article taking
so assertive a position    against a coding practice. (Years
afterwards, a contrary view    contrary view was uttered in a CACM
letter called, inevitably,    "`Goto considered harmful' considered
harmful'"'.  In the    ensuing decades, a large number of both serious
papers and parodies    have borne titles of the form "X considered Y".
The    structured-programming wars eventually blew over with the
realization that both sides were wrong, but use of such titles has
remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the `considered silly'    found
at various places in this lexicon is related).

   :console:: n.  1. The operator's station of a {mainframe}.     In
times past, this was a privileged location that conveyed godlike
powers to anyone with fingers on its keys.  Under Unix and other
modern timesharing OSes, such privileges are guarded by passwords
instead, and the console is just the {tty} the system was booted
from.  Some of the mystique remains, however, and it is traditional
for sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from the console
(on Unix, /dev/console).  2. On microcomputer Unix boxes, the main
screen and keyboard (as opposed to character-only terminals talking
to a serial port).  Typically only the console can do real graphics
or run {X}.

   :console jockey: n.  See {terminal junkie}.

   :content-free: adj.  [by analogy with techspeak    `context-free']
Used of a message that adds nothing to the    recipient's knowledge.
Though this adjective is sometimes applied    to {flamage}, it more
usually connotes derision for    communication styles that exalt form
over substance or are centered    on concerns irrelevant to the subject
ostensibly at hand.  Perhaps    most used with reference to speeches by
company presidents and    other professional manipulators.
"Content-free?  Uh... that's    anything printed on glossy paper."
(See also {four-color    glossies}.)  "He gave a talk on the
implications of electronic    networks for postmodernism and the
fin-de-siecle aesthetic.  It was    content-free."

   :control-C: vi.  1. "Stop whatever you are doing."  From the
interrupt character used on many operating systems to abort a
running program.  Considered silly.  2. interj. Among BSD Unix
hackers, the canonical humorous response to "Give me a break!"

   :control-O: vi.  "Stop talking."  From the character used on    some
operating systems to abort output but allow the program to    keep on
running.  Generally means that you are not interested in    hearing
anything more from that person, at least on that topic; a    standard
response to someone who is flaming.  Considered silly.     Compare
{control-S}.

   :control-Q: vi.  "Resume."  From the ASCII DC1 or {XON}    character
(the pronunciation /X-on/ is therefore also used), used    to undo a
previous {control-S}.

   :control-S: vi.  "Stop talking for a second."  From the    ASCII DC3
or XOFF character (the pronunciation /X-of/ is    therefore also used).
Control-S differs from {control-O} in    that the person is asked to
stop talking (perhaps because you are    on the phone) but will be
allowed to continue when you're ready to    listen to him -- as opposed
to control-O, which has more of the    meaning of "Shut up."
Considered silly.

   :Conway's Law: prov.  The rule that the organization of    the
software and the organization of the software team will be
congruent; commonly stated as "If you have four groups working on    a
compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler".  The original statement    was
more general, "Organizations which design systems are    constrained to
produce designs which are copies of the    communication structures of
these organizations."  This first    appeared in the April 1968 issue
of {Datamation}. Compare    {SNAFU principle}.

   The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE.  (The name
`SAVE' didn't stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer
card decks and listings because they all had SAVE written on them.)

   There is also Tom Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law:    "If a
group of N persons implements a COBOL compiler, there will be    N-1
passes.  Someone in the group has to be the manager."

   :cookbook: n.  [from amateur electronics and radio] A book of small
 code segments that the reader can use to do various {magic}    things
in programs.  One current example is the    "{{PostScript}} Language
Tutorial and Cookbook" by Adobe    Systems, Inc (Addison-Wesley, ISBN
0-201-10179-3), also known as    the {Blue Book} which has recipes for
things like wrapping text    around arbitrary curves and making 3D
fonts.  Cookbooks, slavishly    followed, can lead one into {voodoo
programming}, but are useful    for hackers trying to {monkey up} small
programs in unknown    languages.  This function is analogous to the
role of phrasebooks    in human languages.

   :cooked mode: n.  [Unix, by opposition from {raw mode}] The
normal character-input mode, with interrupts enabled and with    erase,
kill and other special-character interpretations performed    directly
by the tty driver.  Oppose {raw mode}, {rare mode}.     This term is
techspeak under Unix but jargon elsewhere; other    operating systems
often have similar mode distinctions, and the    raw/rare/cooked way of
describing them has spread widely along with    the C language and
other Unix exports.  Most generally, `cooked    mode' may refer to any
mode of a system that does extensive    preprocessing before presenting
data to a program.

   :cookie: n.  A handle, transaction ID, or other token of
agreement between cooperating programs.  "I give him a packet, he
gives me back a cookie."  The claim check you get from a
dry-cleaning shop is a perfect mundane example of a cookie; the    only
thing it's useful for is to relate a later transaction to this    one
(so you get the same clothes back).  Compare {magic cookie};    see
also {fortune cookie}.  Now mainstream in the specific sense    of
web-browser cookies.

   :cookie bear: n. obs.  Original term, pre-Sesame-Street, for    what
is now universally called a {cookie monster}. A    correspondent
observes "In those days, hackers were actually    getting their yucks
from...sit down now...Andy Williams.     Yes, _that_ Andy Williams.
Seems he had a rather hip (by the    standards of the day) TV variety
show. One of the best parts of the    show was the recurring `cookie
bear' sketch. In these sketches, a    guy in a bear suit tried all
sorts of tricks to get a cookie out of    Williams. The sketches would
always end with Williams shrieking    (and I don't mean figuratively),
`No cookies! Not now, not    ever...NEVER!!!' And the bear would fall
down.  Great stuff."

   :cookie file: n.  A collection of {fortune cookie}s in a    format
that facilitates retrieval by a fortune program.  There are    several
different cookie files in public distribution, and site    admins often
assemble their own from various sources including this    lexicon.

   :cookie jar: n.  An area of memory set aside for storing
{cookie}s.  Most commonly heard in the Atari ST community; many
useful ST programs record their presence by storing a distinctive
{magic number} in the jar.  Programs can inquire after the    presence
or otherwise of other programs by searching the contents    of the jar.

   :cookie monster: n.  [from the children's TV program    "Sesame
Street"] Any of a family of early (1970s) hacks    reported on
{{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}}, {{Multics}}, and elsewhere    that would lock up
either the victim's terminal (on a time-sharing    machine) or the
{{console}} (on a batch {mainframe}),    repeatedly demanding "I WANT A
COOKIE".  The required responses    ranged in complexity from "COOKIE"
through "HAVE A COOKIE" and    upward.  Folklorist Jan Brunvand (see
{FOAF}) has described    these programs as urban legends (implying they
probably never    existed) but they existed, all right, in several
different    versions.  See also {wabbit}.  Interestingly, the term
`cookie    monster' appears to be a {retcon}; the original term was
{cookie bear}.

   :copious free time: n.  [Apple; orig. fr. the intro to Tom
Lehrer's song "It Makes A Fellow Proud To Be A Soldier"]    1. [used
ironically to indicate the speaker's lack of the quantity    in
question] A mythical schedule slot for accomplishing tasks held    to
be unlikely or impossible.  Sometimes used to indicate that the
speaker is interested in accomplishing the task, but believes that
the opportunity will not arise.  "I'll implement the automatic
layout stuff in my copious free time."  2. [Archly] Time reserved
for bogus or otherwise idiotic tasks, such as implementation of
{chrome}, or the stroking of {suit}s.  "I'll get back to him    on that
feature in my copious free time."

   :copper: n.  Conventional electron-carrying network cable with    a
core conductor of copper -- or aluminum!  Opposed to {light    pipe}
or, say, a short-range microwave link.

   :copy protection: n.  A class of methods for preventing
incompetent pirates from stealing software and legitimate customers
from using it.  Considered silly.

   :copybroke: /kop'ee-brohk/ adj.  1. [play on `copyright']    Used to
describe an instance of a copy-protected program that has    been
`broken'; that is, a copy with the copy-protection scheme    disabled.
Syn.  {copywronged}.  2. Copy-protected software    which is unusable
because of some bit-rot or bug that has confused    the anti-piracy
check.  See also {copy protection}.

   :copyleft: /kop'ee-left/ n.  [play on `copyright'] 1. The
copyright notice (`General Public License') carried by {GNU}    {EMACS}
and other Free Software Foundation software, granting reuse    and
reproduction rights to all comers (but see also {General    Public
Virus}).  2. By extension, any copyright notice intended to    achieve
similar aims.

   :copyparty: n.  [C64/amiga {demoscene} ]A computer    party
organized so demosceners can meet other in real life, and to
facilitate software copying (mostly pirated software).  The
copyparty has become less common as the Internet makes    communication
easier.  The demoscene has gradually evolved the    {demoparty} to
replace it.

   :copywronged: /kop'ee-rongd/ adj.  [play on `copyright']    Syn. for
{copybroke}.

   :core: n.  Main storage or RAM.  Dates from the days of
ferrite-core memory; now archaic as techspeak most places outside
IBM, but also still used in the Unix community and by old-time
hackers or those who would sound like them.  Some derived idioms    are
quite current; `in core', for example, means `in memory'    (as opposed
to `on disk'), and both {core dump} and the `core    image' or `core
file' produced by one are terms in favor.  Some    varieties of
Commonwealth hackish prefer {store}.

   :core cancer: n.  [rare] A process that exhibits a slow    but
inexorable resource {leak} -- like a cancer, it kills by    crowding
out productive `tissue'.

   :core dump: n.  [common {Iron Age} jargon, preserved by    Unix] 1.
[techspeak] A copy of the contents of {core}, produced    when a
process is aborted by certain kinds of internal error.     2. By
extension, used for humans passing out, vomiting, or    registering
extreme shock.  "He dumped core.  All over the floor.     What a mess."
"He heard about X and dumped core."     3. Occasionally used for a
human rambling on pointlessly at great    length; esp. in apology:
"Sorry, I dumped core on you".  4. A    recapitulation of knowledge
(compare {bits}, sense 1).  Hence,    spewing all one knows about a
topic (syn. {brain dump}), esp.     in a lecture or answer to an exam
question.  "Short, concise    answers are better than core dumps" (from
the instructions to an    exam at Columbia).  See {core}.

   :core leak: n.  Syn. {memory leak}.

   :Core Wars: n.  A game between `assembler' programs in    a machine
or machine simulator, where the objective is to kill your    opponent's
program by overwriting it.  Popularized in the 1980s by    A. K.
Dewdney's column in "Scientific American" magazine, but    described in
"Software Practice And Experience" a decade    earlier.  The game was
actually devised and played by Victor    Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr.,
and Doug McIlroy in the early 1960s    (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes
incorrectly cited as a co-author, but    was not involved).  Their
original game was called `Darwin' and ran    on a IBM 7090 at Bell
Labs.  See {core}.  For information on the    modern game, do a web
search for the `rec.games.corewar    FAQ'.

   :corge: /korj/ n.  [originally, the name of a cat] Yet    another
{metasyntactic variable}, invented by Mike Gallaher and    propagated
by the {GOSMACS} documentation.  See {grault}.

   :cosmic rays: n.  Notionally, the cause of {bit rot}.     However,
this is a semi-independent usage that may be invoked as a    humorous
way to {handwave} away any minor {randomness} that    doesn't seem
worth the bother of investigating.  "Hey, Eric -- I    just got a burst
of garbage on my {tube}, where did that come    from?"  "Cosmic rays, I
guess."  Compare {sunspots},    {phase of the moon}.  The British seem
to prefer the usage    `cosmic showers'; `alpha particles' is also
heard, because    stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip
can cause    single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely
as memory    sizes and densities increase).

   Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
(except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not
explain random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis
was cosmic rays.  So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe,
using 25 tons of the stuff, and used two identical boards for
testing.  One was placed in the safe, one outside.  The hypothesis
was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops, they should see
a statistically significant difference between the error rates on
the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.  Further
investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser
degree uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is
impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
distributed through the earth's crust, with the statistically
insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that    one
has to design memories to withstand these hits.

   :cough and die: v.  Syn. {barf}.  Connotes that the program    is
throwing its hands up by design rather than because of a bug or
oversight.  "The parser saw a control-A in its input where it was
looking for a printable, so it coughed and died."  Compare    {die},
{die horribly}, {scream and die}.

   :cow orker: n.  [Usenet] n. fortuitous typo for co-worker,    widely
used in Usenet, with perhaps a hint that orking cows is    illegal.
Some people believe this was coined by Scott Adams, the    creator of
{Dilbert}. Compare {hing}, {grilf}, {filk},    {newsfroup}.

   :cowboy: n.  [Sun, from William Gibson's {cyberpunk} SF]    Synonym
for {hacker}.  It is reported that at Sun this word is    often said
with reverence.

   :CP/M:: /C-P-M/ n.  [Control Program/Monitor; later    {retcon}ned
to Control Program for Microcomputers] An early    microcomputer {OS}
written by hacker Gary Kildall for 8080- and    Z80-based machines,
very popular in the late 1970s but virtually    wiped out by MS-DOS
after the release of the IBM PC in 1981.     Legend has it that
Kildall's company blew its chance to write the    OS for the IBM PC
because Kildall decided to spend a day IBM's reps    wanted to meet
with him enjoying the perfect flying weather in his    private plane.
Many of CP/M's features and conventions strongly    resemble those of
early {DEC} operating systems such as    {{TOPS-10}}, OS/8, RSTS, and
RSX-11.  See {{MS-DOS}},    {operating system}.

   :CPU Wars: /C-P-U worz/ n.  A 1979 large-format comic by    Chas
Andres chronicling the attempts of the brainwashed androids of    IPM
(Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer and destroy the    peaceful
denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).  This rather
transparent allegory featured many references to {ADVENT} and    the
immortal line "Eat flaming death, minicomputer mongrels!"     (uttered,
of course, by an IPM stormtrooper).  The whole shebang    is now
available on the Web (http://www.e-pix.com/CPUWARS/cpuwars.html).

   It is alleged that the author subsequently received a letter of
appreciation on IBM company stationery from the head of IBM's    Thomas
J. Watson Research Laboratories (then, as now, one of the    few
islands of true hackerdom in the IBM archipelago).  The lower    loop
of the B in the IBM logo, it is said, had been carefully    whited out.
See {eat flaming death}.

   :crack root: v.  [very common] To defeat the security    system of a
Unix machine and gain {root} privileges thereby; see    {cracking}.

   :cracker: n.  One who breaks security on a system.  Coined    ca.
1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of    {hacker}
(q.v., sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish    `worm' in this
sense around 1981-82 on Usenet was largely a    failure.

   Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against
the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings.  While it is
expected that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking
and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past {larval    stage}
is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so except for
immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if it's    necessary
to get around some security in order to get some work    done).

   Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom
than the {mundane} reader misled by sensationalistic journalism
might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit, very
secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
describe _themselves_ as hackers, most true hackers consider    them a
separate and lower form of life.

   Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
breaking into someone else's has to be pretty {losing}.  Some    other
reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the    entries on
{cracking} and {phreaking}.  See also    {samurai}, {dark-side hacker},
and {hacker ethic}.  For a    portrait of the typical teenage cracker,
see {warez    d00dz}.

   :cracking: n.  [very common] The act of breaking into a    computer
system; what a {cracker} does.  Contrary to widespread    myth, this
does not usually involve some mysterious leap of    hackerly
brilliance, but rather persistence and the dogged    repetition of a
handful of fairly well-known tricks that exploit    common weaknesses
in the security of target systems.  Accordingly,    most crackers are
only mediocre hackers.

   :crank: vt.  [from automotive slang] Verb used to describe the
performance of a machine, especially sustained performance.  "This
box cranks (or, cranks at) about 6 megaflops, with a burst mode of
twice that on vectorized operations."

   :crapplet: n.  [portmanteau, crap + applet] A worthless    applet,
esp. a Java widget attached to a web page that doesn't    work or even
crashes your browser.

   :CrApTeX: /krap'tekh/ n.  [University of York, England] Term    of
abuse used to describe TeX and LaTeX when they don't work (when    used
by TeXhackers), or all the time (by everyone else).  The
non-TeX-enthusiasts generally dislike it because it is more verbose
than other formatters (e.g. {{troff}}) and because (particularly    if
the standard Computer Modern fonts are used) it generates vast
output files.  See {religious issues}, {{TeX}}.

   :crash:  1. n. A sudden, usually drastic failure.  Most often
said of the {system} (q.v., sense 1), esp. of magnetic disk    drives
(the term originally described what happens when the air    gap of a
hard disk collapses).  "Three {luser}s lost their    files in last
night's disk crash."  A disk crash that involves the    read/write
heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and    scraping off the
oxide may also be referred to as a `head crash',    whereas the term
`system crash' usually, though not always,    implies that the
operating system or other software was at fault.     2. v. To fail
suddenly.  "Has the system just crashed?"     "Something crashed the
OS!" See {down}.  Also used    transitively to indicate the cause of
the crash (usually a person    or a program, or both).  "Those idiots
playing {SPACEWAR}    crashed the system." 3. vi.  Sometimes said of
people hitting the    sack after a long {hacking run}; see {gronk out}.

   :crash and burn: vi.,n.  A spectacular crash, in the mode of    the
conclusion of the car-chase scene in the movie "Bullitt"    and many
subsequent imitators (compare {die horribly}).  Sun-3    monitors
losing the flyback transformer and lightning strikes on    VAX-11/780
backplanes are notable crash and burn generators.  The    construction
`crash-and-burn machine' is reported for a computer    used exclusively
for alpha or {beta} testing, or reproducing    bugs (i.e., not for
development).  The implication is that it    wouldn't be such a
disaster if that machine crashed, since only the    testers would be
inconvenienced.

   :crawling horror: n.  Ancient crufty hardware or software that    is
kept obstinately alive by forces beyond the control of the    hackers
at a site.  Like {dusty deck} or {gonkulator}, but    connotes that the
thing described is not just an irritation but an    active menace to
health and sanity.  "Mostly we code new stuff in    C, but they pay us
to maintain one big FORTRAN II application from    nineteen-sixty-X
that's a real crawling horror...." Compare    {WOMBAT}.

   :cray: /kray/ n.  1. (properly, capitalized) One of the line    of
supercomputers designed by Cray Research.  2. Any supercomputer    at
all.  3. The {canonical} {number-crunching} machine.

   The term is actually the lowercased last name of Seymour Cray, a
noted computer architect and co-founder of the company.  Numerous
vivid legends surround him, some true and some admittedly invented
by Cray Research brass to shape their corporate culture and image.

   :cray instability: n.  1. A shortcoming of a program or    algorithm
that manifests itself only when a large problem is being    run on a
powerful machine (see {cray}).  Generally more subtle    than bugs that
can be detected in smaller problems running on a    workstation or
mini.  2. More specifically, a shortcoming of    algorithms which are
well behaved when run on gentle floating point    hardware (such as
IEEE-standard or PDP-series machines) but which    break down badly
when exposed to a Cray's unique `rounding'    rules.

   :crayola: /kray-oh'l*/ n.  A super-mini or -micro computer    that
provides some reasonable percentage of supercomputer    performance for
an unreasonably low price.  Might also be a    {killer micro}.

   :crayola books: n.  The {rainbow series} of National    Computer
Security Center (NCSC) computer security standards (see    {Orange
Book}).  Usage: humorous and/or disparaging.

   :crayon: n.  1. Someone who works on Cray supercomputers.     More
specifically, it implies a programmer, probably of the CDC    ilk,
probably male, and almost certainly wearing a tie    (irrespective of
gender).  Systems types who have a Unix background    tend not to be
described as crayons.  2. A {computron} (sense 2)    that participates
only in {number-crunching}.  3. A unit of    computational power equal
to that of a single Cray-1.  There is a    standard joke about this
usage that derives from an old Crayola    crayon promotional gimmick:
When you buy 64 crayons you get a free    sharpener.

   :creationism: n.  The (false) belief that large, innovative
software designs can be completely specified in advance and then
painlessly magicked out of the void by the normal efforts of a team
of normally talented programmers.  In fact, experience has shown
repeatedly that good designs arise only from evolutionary,
exploratory interaction between one (or at most a small handful of)
exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user population --    and
that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong.
Unfortunately, because these truths don't fit the planning models
beloved of {management}, they are generally ignored.

   :creep: v.  To advance, grow, or multiply inexorably.  In    hackish
usage this verb has overtones of menace and silliness,    evoking the
creeping horrors of low-budget monster movies.

   :creeping elegance: n.  Describes a tendency for parts of a
design to become {elegant} past the point of diminishing return,
something which often happens at the expense of the less    interesting
parts of the design, the schedule, and other things    deemed important
in the {Real World}.  See also {creeping    featurism}, {second-system
effect}, {tense}.

   :creeping featurism: /kree'ping fee'chr-izm/ n.     [common] 1.
Describes a systematic tendency to load more    {chrome} and {feature}s
onto systems at the expense of    whatever elegance they may have
possessed when originally designed.     See also {feeping creaturism}.
"You know, the main problem    with {BSD} Unix has always been creeping
featurism."  2. More    generally, the tendency for anything
complicated to become even    more complicated because people keep
saying "Gee, it would be even    better if it had this feature too".
(See {feature}.)  The    result is usually a patchwork because it grew
one ad-hoc step at a    time, rather than being planned.  Planning is a
lot of work, but    it's easy to add just one extra little feature to
help someone    ... and then another ... and another.... When
creeping featurism gets out of hand, it's like a cancer.  Usually
this term is used to describe computer programs, but it could also
be said of the federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars.
A similar phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see
{second-system effect}.  See also {creeping elegance}.

   :creeping featuritis: /kree'ping fee'-chr-i:`t*s/ n.     Variant of
{creeping featurism}, with its own spoonerization:    `feeping
creaturitis'.  Some people like to reserve this form for    the disease
as it actually manifests in software or hardware, as    opposed to the
lurking general tendency in designers' minds.     (After all, -ism
means `condition' or `pursuit of', whereas    -itis usually means
`inflammation of'.)

   :cretin: /kret'in/ or /kree'tn/ n.  Congenital {loser};    an
obnoxious person; someone who can't do anything right.  It has    been
observed that many American hackers tend to favor the British
pronunciation /kret'in/ over standard American /kree'tn/; it is
thought this may be due to the insidious phonetic influence of    Monty
Python's Flying Circus.

   :cretinous: /kret'n-*s/ or /kreet'n-*s/ adj.  Wrong;    stupid;
non-functional; very poorly designed.  Also used    pejoratively of
people.  See {dread high-bit disease} for an    example.  Approximate
synonyms: {bletcherous}, {bagbiting}    {losing}, {brain-damaged}.

   :crippleware: n.  1. [common] Software that has some important
functionality deliberately removed, so as to entice potential users
to pay for a working version.  2. [Cambridge] Variety of    {guiltware}
that exhorts you to donate to some charity (compare    {careware},
{nagware}).  3. Hardware deliberately crippled,    which can be
upgraded to a more expensive model by a trivial change    (e.g.,
cutting a jumper).

   An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX
chip, which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor dyked    out
(in some early versions it was present but disabled).  To    upgrade,
you buy a complete 486DX chip with _working_    co-processor (its
identity thinly veiled by a different pinout) and    plug it into the
board's expansion socket.  It then disables the    SX, which becomes a
fancy power sink.  Don't you love Intel?

   :critical mass: n.  In physics, the minimum amount of    fissionable
material required to sustain a chain reaction.  Of a    software
product, describes a condition of the software such that    fixing one
bug introduces one plus {epsilon} bugs.  (This malady    has many
causes: {creeping featurism}, ports to too many    disparate
environments, poor initial design, etc.)  When software    achieves
critical mass, it can never be fixed; it can only be    discarded and
rewritten.

   :crlf: /ker'l*f/, sometimes /kru'l*f/ or /C-R-L-F/ n.     (often
capitalized as `CRLF') A carriage return (CR, ASCII 0001101)
followed by a line feed (LF, ASCII 0001010).  More loosely,    whatever
it takes to get you from the end of one line of text to    the
beginning of the next line.  See {newline}, {terpri}.     Under
{{Unix}} influence this usage has become less common (Unix    uses a
bare line feed as its `CRLF').

   :crock: n.  [from the American scatologism `crock of    shit'] 1. An
awkward feature or programming technique that ought to    be made
cleaner.  For example, using small integers to represent    error codes
without the program interpreting them to the user (as    in, for
example, Unix `make(1)', which returns code 139 for a    process that
dies due to {segfault}).  2. A technique that works    acceptably, but
which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the    least.  For
example, a too-clever programmer might write an    assembler which
mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric opcodes    algorithmically, a
trick which depends far too intimately on the    particular bit
patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of    programming with a
dependence on actual opcode values, see    {The Story of Mel} in
Appendix A.)  Many crocks have a tightly    woven, almost completely
unmodifiable structure.  See {kluge},    {brittle}.  The adjectives
`crockish' and `crocky', and the    nouns `crockishness' and
`crockitude', are also used.

   :cross-post: vi.  [Usenet; very common] To post a single    article
simultaneously to several newsgroups.  Distinguished from    posting
the article repeatedly, once to each newsgroup, which    causes people
to see it multiple times (which is very bad form).     Gratuitous
cross-posting without a Followup-To line directing    responses to a
single followup group is frowned upon, as it tends    to cause
{followup} articles to go to inappropriate newsgroups    when people
respond to only one part of the original posting.

   :crudware: /kruhd'weir/ n.  Pejorative term for the hundreds    of
megabytes of low-quality {freeware} circulated by user's    groups and
BBS systems in the micro-hobbyist world.  "Yet    _another_ set of disk
catalog utilities for {{MS-DOS}}?     What crudware!"

   :cruft: /kruhft/  [very common; back-formation from {crufty}] 1. n.
An    unpleasant substance.  The dust that gathers under your bed is
cruft; the TMRC Dictionary correctly noted that attacking it with a
broom only produces more.  2. n. The results of shoddy    construction.
3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft']    To write assembler
code for something normally (and better) done by    a compiler (see
{hand-hacking}).  4. n. Excess; superfluous    junk; used esp. of
redundant or superseded code.  5. [University    of Wisconsin] n. Cruft
is to hackers as gaggle is to geese; that    is, at UW one properly
says "a cruft of hackers".

   :cruft together: vt.  (also `cruft up') To throw together
something ugly but temporarily workable.  Like vt. {kluge up},    but
more pejorative.  "There isn't any program now to reverse all    the
lines of a file, but I can probably cruft one together in about    10
minutes."  See {hack together}, {hack up}, {kluge up},    {crufty}.

   :cruftsmanship: /kruhfts'm*n-ship / n.  [from {cruft}]    The
antithesis of craftsmanship.

   :crufty: /kruhf'tee/ adj.  [very common; origin unknown;    poss.
from `crusty' or `cruddy'] 1. Poorly built, possibly    over-complex.
The {canonical} example is "This is standard old    crufty {DEC}
software".  In fact, one fanciful theory of the    origin of `crufty'
holds that was originally a mutation of    `crusty' applied to DEC
software so old that the `s' characters    were tall and skinny,
looking more like `f' characters.     2. Unpleasant, especially to the
touch, often with encrusted junk.     Like spilled coffee smeared with
peanut butter and catsup.     3. Generally unpleasant.  4. (sometimes
spelled `cruftie') n.     A small crufty object (see {frob}); often one
that doesn't fit    well into the scheme of things.  "A LISP property
list is a good    place to store crufties (or, collectively, {random}
cruft)."

   This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of
its etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at
Harvard University which is part of the old physics building; it's
said to have been the physics department's radar lab during WWII.
To this day (early 1993) the windows appear to be full of random
techno-junk.  MIT or Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the
term as a knock on the competition.

   :crumb: n.  Two binary digits; a {quad}.  Larger than a    {bit},
smaller than a {nybble}.  Considered silly.     Syn. {tayste}.  General
discussion of such terms is under    {nybble}.

   :crunch: 1. vi.  To process, usually in a time-consuming or
complicated way.  Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is
nonetheless painful to perform.  The pain may be due to the
triviality's being embedded in a loop from 1 to 1,000,000,000.
"FORTRAN programs do mostly {number-crunching}."  2. vt. To    reduce
the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as    by
a Huffman code.  (The file ends up looking something like a    paper
document would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.)     Since
such compression usually takes more computations than simpler
methods such as run-length encoding, the term is doubly    appropriate.
(This meaning is usually used in the construction    `file
crunch(ing)' to distinguish it from {number-crunching}.)     See
{compress}.  3. n. The character `#'.  Used at XEROX    and CMU, among
other places.  See {{ASCII}}.  4. vt. To squeeze    program source into
a minimum-size representation that will still    compile or execute.
The term came into being specifically for a    famous program on the
BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order    to make it run more
quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so    the number of
characters mattered).  {Obfuscated C Contest}    entries are often
crunched; see the first example under that entry.

   :cryppie: /krip'ee/ n.  A cryptographer.  One who hacks or
implements cryptographic software or hardware.

   :CTSS: /C-T-S-S/ n.  Compatible Time-Sharing System.  An    early
(1963) experiment in the design of interactive time-sharing
operating systems, ancestral to {{Multics}}, {{Unix}}, and    {{ITS}}.
The name {{ITS}} (Incompatible Time-sharing System)    was a hack on
CTSS, meant both as a joke and to express some basic    differences in
philosophy about the way I/O services should be    presented to user
programs.

   :cube: n.  1. [short for `cubicle'] A module in the    open-plan
offices used at many programming shops.  "I've got the    manuals in my
cube."  2. A NeXT machine (which resembles a    matte-black cube).

   :cubing: vi.  [parallel with `tubing'] 1. Hacking on an IPSC
(Intel Personal SuperComputer) hypercube.  "Louella's gone cubing
_again_!!"  2. Hacking Rubik's Cube or related puzzles,    either
physically or mathematically.  3. An indescribable form of
self-torture (see sense 1 or 2).

   :cup holder: n.  The tray of a CD-ROM drive, or by    extension the
CD drive itself. So called because of a common tech    support legend
about the idiot who called to complain that the cup    holder on his
computer broke. A joke program was once distributed    around the net
called "cupholder.exe", which when run simply    extended the CD drive
tray. The humor of this was of course lost on    people whose drive had
a slot or a caddy instead.

   :cursor dipped in X: n.  There are a couple of metaphors in
English of the form `pen dipped in X' (perhaps the most common
values of X are `acid', `bile', and `vitriol').  These map    over
neatly to this hackish usage (the cursor being what moves,    leaving
letters behind, when one is composing on-line).  "Talk    about a
{nastygram}!  He must've had his cursor dipped in acid    when he wrote
that one!"

   :cuspy: /kuhs'pee/ adj.  [WPI: from the {DEC}    abbreviation CUSP,
for `Commonly Used System Program', i.e., a    utility program used by
many people] 1. (of a program)    Well-written.  2. Functionally
excellent.  A program that performs    well and interfaces well to
users is cuspy.  See {rude}.     3. [NYU] Said of an attractive woman,
especially one regarded as    available.  Implies a certain
curvaceousness.

   :cut a tape: vi.  To write a software or document distribution    on
magnetic tape for shipment.  Has nothing to do with physically
cutting the medium!  Early versions of this lexicon claimed that    one
never analogously speaks of `cutting a disk', but this has    since
been reported as live usage.  Related slang usages are    mainstream
business's `cut a check', the recording industry's    `cut a record',
and the military's `cut an order'.

   All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete
recording and duplication technologies.  The first stage in
manufacturing an old-style vinyl record involved cutting grooves in
a stamping die with a precision lathe.  More mundanely, the    dominant
technology for mass duplication of paper documents in
pre-photocopying days involved "cutting a stencil", punching away
portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen.  More directly,    paper
tape with holes punched in it was an important early storage    medium.

   :cybercrud: /si:'ber-kruhd/ n.  1. [coined by Ted Nelson]
Obfuscatory tech-talk.  Verbiage with a high {MEGO} factor.  The
computer equivalent of bureaucratese.  2. Incomprehensible stuff
embedded in email.  First there were the "Received" headers that
show how mail flows through systems, then MIME (Multi-purpose
Internet Mail Extensions) headers and part boundaries, and now huge
blocks of hex for PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) or PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) digital signatures and certificates of authenticity.  This
stuff all services a purpose and good user interfaces should hide
it, but all too often users are forced to wade through it.

   :cyberpunk: /si:'ber-puhnk/ n.,adj.  [orig. by SF writer    Bruce
Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A subgenre of SF    launched in
1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel    "Neuromancer" (though
its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's    "True Names" (see the
{Bibliography} in Appendix C) to    John Brunner's 1975 novel "The
Shockwave Rider").  Gibson's    near-total ignorance of computers and
the present-day hacker    culture enabled him to speculate about the
role of computers and    hackers in the future in ways hackers have
since found both    irritatingly nai"ve and tremendously stimulating.
Gibson's work    was widely imitated, in particular by the short-lived
but    innovative "Max Headroom" TV series.  See {cyberspace},
{ice}, {jack in}, {go flatline}.

   Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or
fashion trend that calls itself `cyberpunk', associated especially
with the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about
this.  On the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to
be shallow trendoids in black leather who have substituted
enthusiastic blathering about technology for actually learning and
_doing_ it.  Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the    other
hand, at least cyberpunks are excited about the right things    and
properly respectful of hacking talent in those who have it.     The
general consensus is to tolerate them politely in hopes that    they'll
attract people who grow into being true hackers.

   :cyberspace: /si:'br-spays`/ n.  1. Notional    `information-space'
loaded with visual cues and navigable with    brain-computer interfaces
called `cyberspace decks'; a    characteristic prop of {cyberpunk} SF.
Serious efforts to    construct {virtual reality} interfaces modeled
explicitly on    Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more
conventional devices    such as glove sensors and binocular TV
headsets.  Few hackers are    prepared to deny outright the possibility
of a cyberspace someday    evolving out of the network (see {the
network}).  2. The    Internet or {Matrix} (sense #2) as a whole,
considered as a    crude cyberspace (sense 1).  Although this usage
became widely    popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the
Internet    exploded into public awareness, it is strongly deprecated
among    hackers because the Internet does not meet the high,
SF-inspired    standards they have for true cyberspace technology.
Thus, this use    of the term usually tags a {wannabee} or outsider.
3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in
{hack mode}.  Some hackers report experiencing strong eidetic
imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from
multiple sources suggest that there are common features to the
experience.  In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective
`cyberspace' are often gray and silver, and the imagery often
involves constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting
patterns of lines and angles, or moire patterns.

   :cycle:  1. n. The basic unit of computation.  What every    hacker
wants more of (noted hacker Bill Gosper described himself as    a
"cycle junkie"). One can describe an instruction as taking so    many
`clock cycles'.  Often the computer can access its memory    once on
every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of `memory    cycles'.  These
are technical meanings of {cycle}.  The jargon    meaning comes from
the observation that there are only so many    cycles per second, and
when you are sharing a computer the cycles    get divided up among the
users.  The more cycles the computer    spends working on your program
rather than someone else's, the    faster your program will run.
That's why every hacker wants more    cycles: so he can spend less time
waiting for the computer to    respond.  2. By extension, a notional
unit of _human_ thought    power, emphasizing that lots of things
compete for the typical    hacker's think time.  "I refused to get
involved with the Rubik's    Cube back when it was big.  Knew I'd burn
too many cycles on it if    I let myself."  3. vt. Syn. {bounce} (sense
4), {120 reset};    from the phrase `cycle power'. "Cycle the machine
again, that    serial port's still hung."

   :cycle crunch: n.,obs.  A situation wherein the number of    people
trying to use a computer simultaneously has reached the    point where
no one can get enough cycles because they are spread    too thin and
the system has probably begun to {thrash}.  This    scenario is an
inevitable result of Parkinson's Law applied to    timesharing.
Usually the only solution is to buy more computer.     Happily, this
has rapidly become easier since the mid-1980s, so    much so that the
very term `cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic    flavor; most
hackers now use workstations or personal computers as    opposed to
traditional timesharing systems, and are far more likely    to complain
of `bandwidth crunch' on their shared networks rather than    cycle
crunch.

   :cycle drought: n.  A scarcity of cycles.  It may be due to a
{cycle crunch}, but it could also occur because part of the    computer
is temporarily not working, leaving fewer cycles to go    around.  "The
{high moby} is {down}, so we're running with    only half the usual
amount of memory.  There will be a cycle    drought until it's fixed."

   :cycle of reincarnation: n.  [coined in a paper by T. H. Myer    and
I.E. Sutherland "On the Design of Display Processors", Comm.     ACM,
Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to refer to a well-known
effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated    out
to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the
peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job,
then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function
back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

   Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in    communications
and floating-point processors.  Also known as `the    Wheel of Life',
`the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of    the basic
Hindu/Buddhist theological idea.  See also {blitter},    {bit bang}.

   :cycle server: n.  A powerful machine that exists    primarily for
running large compute-, disk-, or memory-intensive    jobs (more
formally called a `compute server').  Implies that    interactive tasks
such as editing are done on other machines on the    network, such as
workstations.

   :cypherpunk: n.  [from {cyberpunk}] Someone interested in the
uses of encryption via electronic ciphers for enhancing personal
privacy and guarding against tyranny by centralized, authoritarian
power structures, especially government.  There is an active
cypherpunks mailing list at <cypherpunks-request@toad.com>
coordinating work on public-key encryption freeware, privacy, and
digital cash.  See also {tentacle}.

   :C|N>K: n.  [Usenet] Coffee through Nose to Keyboard; that    is, "I
laughed so hard I {snarf}ed my coffee onto my    keyboard.".  Common on
alt.fan.pratchett and {scary    devil monastery}; recognized elsewhere.
The    Acronymphomania FAQ
(http://www.lspace.org/faqs/acronym-faq.g.html) on alt.fan.pratchett
recognizes    variants such as T|N>K = `Tea through Nose to Keyboard'
and    C|N>S = `Coffee through Nose to Screen'.

= D =
=====

   :D. C. Power Lab: n.  The former site of {{SAIL}}.  Hackers
thought this was very funny because the obvious connection to
electrical engineering was nonexistent -- the lab was named for a
Donald C.  Power.  Compare {Marginal Hacks}.

   :daemon: /day'mn/ or /dee'mn/ n.  [from the mythological    meaning,
later rationalized as the acronym `Disk And Execution    MONitor'] A
program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies    dormant waiting for
some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that    the perpetrator of the
condition need not be aware that a daemon is    lurking (though often a
program will commit an action only because    it knows that it will
implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example,    under {{ITS}} writing a
file on the {LPT} spooler's directory    would invoke the spooling
daemon, which would then print the file.     The advantage is that
programs wanting (in this example) files    printed need neither
compete for access to nor understand any    idiosyncrasies of the
{LPT}.  They simply enter their implicit    requests and let the daemon
decide what to do with them.  Daemons    are usually spawned
automatically by the system, and may either    live forever or be
regenerated at intervals.

   Daemon and {demon} are often used interchangeably, but seem to
have distinct connotations.  The term `daemon' was introduced to
computing by {CTSS} people (who pronounced it /dee'mon/) and    used it
to refer to what ITS called a {dragon}.  Although the    meaning and
the pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary    reflects
current (1999) usage.

   :daemon book: n.  "The Design and Implementation of    the 4.3BSD
UNIX Operating System", by Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall    Kirk
McKusick, Michael J. Karels, and John S. Quarterman    (Addison-Wesley
Publishers, 1989, ISBN 0-201-06196-1); or    "The Design and
Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating    System" by Marshall Kirk
McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels    and John S. Quarterman
(Addison-Wesley Longman, 1996, SBN    0-201-54979-4) Either of the
standard reference books on the    internals of {BSD} Unix.  So called
because the covers have a    picture depicting a little devil (a visual
play on {daemon}) in    sneakers, holding a pitchfork (referring to one
of the    characteristic features of Unix, the `fork(2)' system call).
  Also known as the {Devil Book}.

   :dahmum: /dah'mum/ n.  [Usenet] The material of which    protracted
{flame war}s, especially those about operating    systems, is composed.
Homeomorphic to {spam}.  The term    `dahmum' is derived from the name
of a militant {OS/2}    advocate, and originated when an extensively
crossposted    OS/2-versus-{Linux} debate was fed through {Dissociated
 Press}.

   :dancing frog: n.  [Vancouver area] A problem that occurs    on a
computer that will not reappear while anyone else is watching.     From
the classic Warner Brothers cartoon "One Froggy    Evening", featuring
a dancing and singing Michigan J. Frog that    just croaks when anyone
else is around (now the WB network    mascot).

   :dangling pointer: n.  [common] A reference that doesn't    actually
lead anywhere (in C and some other languages, a pointer    that doesn't
actually point at anything valid).  Usually this    happens because it
formerly pointed to something that has moved or    disappeared.  Used
as jargon in a generalization of its techspeak    meaning; for example,
a local phone number for a person who has    since moved to the other
coast is a dangling pointer.  Compare    {dead link}.

   :dark-side hacker: n.  A criminal or malicious hacker; a
{cracker}.  From George Lucas's Darth Vader, "seduced by the    dark
side of the Force".  The implication that hackers form a sort    of
elite of technological Jedi Knights is intended.  Oppose    {samurai}.

   :Datamation: /day`t*-may'sh*n/ n.  A magazine that many    hackers
assume all {suit}s read.  Used to question an unbelieved    quote, as
in "Did you read that in `Datamation?'" (But see    below; this slur
may be dated by the time you read this.) It used    to publish
something hackishly funny every once in a while, like    the original
paper on {COME FROM} in 1973, and Ed Post's    "Real Programmers Don't
Use Pascal" ten years later, but for    a long time after that it was
much more exclusively    {suit}-oriented and boring.  Following a
change of editorship in    1994, Datamation is trying for more of the
technical content and    irreverent humor that marked its early days.

   Datamation now has a WWW page at `http://www.datamation.com'
worth visiting for its selection of computer humor, including    "Real
Programmers Don't Use Pascal" and the `Bastard Operator    From Hell'
stories by Simon Travaglia (see {BOFH}).

   :DAU: /dow/ n.  [German FidoNet] German acronym for    Du"mmster
Anzunehmender User (stupidest imaginable user).     From the
engineering-slang GAU for Gro"sster Anzunehmender    Unfall, worst
assumable accident, esp. of a LNG tank farm plant    or something with
similarly disastrous consequences.  In popular    German, GAU is used
only to refer to worst-case nuclear acidents    such as a core
meltdown. See {cretin}, {fool}, {loser} and    {weasel}.

   :Dave the Resurrector: n.  [Usenet; also abbreviated DtR]    A
{cancelbot} that cancels cancels.  Dave the Resurrector    originated
when some {spam}-spewers decided to try to impede    spam-fighting by
wholesale cancellation of anti-spam coordination    messages in the
news.admin.net-abuse.usenet    newsgroup.

   :day mode: n.  See {phase} (sense 1).  Used of people only.

   :dd: /dee-dee/ vt.  [Unix: from IBM {JCL}] Equivalent to    {cat} or
{BLT}.  Originally the name of a Unix copy command    with special
options suitable for block-oriented devices; it was    often used in
heavy-handed system maintenance, as in "Let's    `dd' the root
partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to    load it back on to
a new disk".  The Unix `dd(1)' was    designed with a weird, distinctly
non-Unixy keyword option syntax    reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL
(which had an elaborate DD    `Dataset Definition' specification for
I/O devices); though the    command filled a need, the interface design
was clearly a prank.     The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix
sites and now nearly    obsolete even there, as `dd(1)' has been
{deprecated} for a    long time (though it has no exact replacement).
The term has been    displaced by {BLT} or simple English `copy'.

   :DDT: /D-D-T/ n.  1. Generic term for a program that assists    in
debugging other programs by showing individual machine    instructions
in a readable symbolic form and letting the user    change them.  In
this sense the term DDT is now archaic, having    been widely displaced
by `debugger' or names of individual    programs like `adb', `sdb',
`dbx', or `gdb'.     2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled {{ITS}} operating
system, DDT (running    under the alias HACTRN, a six-letterism for
`Hack Translator') was    also used as the {shell} or top level command
language used to    execute other programs.  3. Any one of several
specific DDTs (sense    1) supported on early {DEC} hardware and CP/M.
The PDP-10 Reference    Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the
first page of the    documentation for DDT that illuminates the origin
of the term:

     Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
     computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging
     Tape".  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has
     propagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are now
     available for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape are
     now frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging
     Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.
     Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
     dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (C14-H9-Cl5) should be minimal
     since each attacks a different, and apparently mutually exclusive,
     class of bugs.

(The `tape' referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.)
Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the
handbook after the {suit}s took over and {DEC} became much more
`businesslike'.

   The history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's
more: Peter Samson, compiler of the original {TMRC} lexicon,    reports
that he named `DDT' after a similar tool on the TX-0    computer, the
direct ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln    Lab in 1957.
The debugger on that ground-breaking machine (the    first
transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT    (FLexowriter
Interrogation Tape).

   :de-rezz: /dee-rez'/  [from `de-resolve' via the movie    "Tron"]
(also `derez') 1. vi. To disappear or dissolve; the    image that goes
with it is of an object breaking up into raster    lines and static and
then dissolving.  Occasionally used of a    person who seems to have
suddenly `fuzzed out' mentally rather than    physically.  Usage:
extremely silly, also rare.  This verb was    actually invented as
_fictional_ hacker jargon, and adopted in    a spirit of irony by real
hackers years after the fact.  2. vt. The    Macintosh resource
decompiler.  On a Macintosh, many program    structures (including the
code itself) are managed in small    segments of the program file known
as `resources'; `Rez' and    `DeRez' are a pair of utilities for
compiling and decompiling    resource files.  Thus, decompiling a
resource is `derezzing'.     Usage: very common.

   :dead: adj.  1. Non-functional; {down}; {crash}ed.     Especially
used of hardware.  2. At XEROX PARC, software that is    working but
not undergoing continued development and support.     3. Useless;
inaccessible.  Antonym: `live'.  Compare {dead    code}.

   :dead code: n.  Routines that can never be accessed because    all
calls to them have been removed, or code that cannot be reached
because it is guarded by a control structure that provably must
always transfer control somewhere else.  The presence of dead code
may reveal either logical errors due to alterations in the program
or significant changes in the assumptions and environment of the
program (see also {software rot}); a good compiler should report
dead code so a maintainer can think about what it means.     (Sometimes
it simply means that an _extremely_ defensive    programmer has
inserted {can't happen} tests which really can't    happen -- yet.)
Syn. {grunge}.  See also {dead}, and    {The Story of Mel}.

   :dead link: n.  [very common] A World-Wide-Web URL that no    longer
points to the information it was written to reach.  Usually    this
happens because the document has been moved or deleted.  Lots    of
dead links make a WWW page frustrating and useless and are the    #1
sign of poor page maintainance. Compare {dangling    pointer}, {link
rot}.

   :DEADBEEF: /ded-beef/ n.  The hexadecimal word-fill pattern    for
freshly allocated memory (decimal -21524111) under a number of    IBM
environments, including the RS/6000.  Some modern debugging    tools
deliberately fill freed memory with this value as a way of
converting {heisenbug}s into {Bohr bug}s.  As in "Your    program is
DEADBEEF" (meaning gone, aborted, flushed from memory);    if you start
from an odd half-word boundary, of course, you have    BEEFDEAD.  See
also the anecdote under {fool}.

   :deadlock: n.  1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more
processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of
the others to do something.  A common example is a program
communicating to a server, which may find itself waiting for output
from the server before sending anything more to it, while the    server
is similarly waiting for more input from the controlling    program
before outputting anything.  (It is reported that this    particular
flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a `starvation    deadlock',
though the term `starvation' is more properly used for    situations
where a program can never run simply because it never    gets high
enough priority.  Another common flavor is    `constipation', in which
each process is trying to send stuff to    the other but all buffers
are full because nobody is reading    anything.)  See {deadly embrace}.
2. Also used of deadlock-like    interactions between humans, as when
two people meet in a narrow    corridor, and each tries to be polite by
moving aside to let the    other pass, but they end up swaying from
side to side without    making any progress because they always move
the same way at the    same time.

   :deadly embrace: n.  Same as {deadlock}, though usually    used only
when exactly two processes are involved.  This is the    more popular
term in Europe, while {deadlock} predominates in    the United States.

   :death code: n.  A routine whose job is to set everything in    the
computer -- registers, memory, flags, everything -- to zero,
including that portion of memory where it is running; its last act
is to stomp on its own "store zero" instruction.  Death code    isn't
very useful, but writing it is an interesting hacking    challenge on
architectures where the instruction set makes it    possible, such as
the PDP-8 (it has also been done on the DG Nova).

   Perhaps the ultimate death code is on the TI 990 series, where all
registers are actually in RAM, and the instruction "store    immediate
0" has the opcode "0". The PC will immediately wrap    around core as
many times as it can until a user hits HALT.  Any    empty memory
location is death code.  Worse, the manufacturer    recommended use of
this instruction in startup code (which would be    in ROM and
therefore survive).

   :Death Square: n.  The corporate logo of Novell, the people    who
acquired USL after AT&T let go of it (Novell eventually sold    the
Unix group to SCO).  Coined by analogy with {Death Star},    because
many people believed Novell was bungling the lead in Unix    systems
exactly as AT&T did for many years.

   :Death Star: n.  [from the movie "Star Wars"] 1. The    AT&T
corporate logo, which appears on computers sold by AT&T and    bears an
uncanny resemblance to the Death Star in the movie.  This    usage is
particularly common among partisans of {BSD} Unix, who    tend to
regard the AT&T versions as inferior and AT&T as a bad guy.     Copies
still circulate of a poster printed by Mt. Xinu showing a    starscape
with a space fighter labeled 4.2 BSD streaking away from    a broken
AT&T logo wreathed in flames.  2. AT&T's internal    magazine, "Focus",
uses `death star' to describe an    incorrectly done AT&T logo in which
the inner circle in the top    left is dark instead of light -- a
frequent result of    dark-on-light logo images.

   :DEC:: /dek/ n.  1. v. Verbal (and only rarely    written) shorthand
for decrement, i.e. `decrease by one'.     Especially used by assembly
programmers, as many assembly languages    have a `dec' mnemonic.
Antonym: {inc}.  2. n. Commonly    used abbreviation for Digital
Equipment Corporation, later    deprecated by DEC itself in favor of
"Digital" and now entirely    obsolete following the buyout by Compaq.
Before the {killer    micro} revolution of the late 1980s, hackerdom
was closely    symbiotic with DEC's pioneering timesharing machines.
The first of    the group of cultures described by this lexicon
nucleated around    the PDP-1 (see {TMRC}).  Subsequently, the PDP-6,
{PDP-10},    {PDP-20}, PDP-11 and {VAX} were all foci of large and
important hackerdoms, and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET
and Internet machine population.  DEC was the technological leader
of the minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to
embrace microcomputers and Unix early cost it heavily in profits    and
prestige after {silicon} got cheap.  Nevertheless, the
microprocessor design tradition owes a major debt to the PDP-11
instruction set, and every one of the major general-purpose
microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was
either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC
hardware, or both.  Accordingly, DEC was for many years still
regarded with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too
young to have grown up on DEC machines.

   DEC reclaimed some of its old reputation among techies in the first
 half of the 1990s.  The success of the Alpha, an
innovatively-designed and very high-performance {killer micro},
helped a lot.  So did DEC's newfound receptiveness to Unix and open
systems in general.  When Compaq acquired DEC at the end of 1998
there was some concern that these gains would be lost along with    the
DEC nameplate, but the merged company has so far turned out to    be
culturally dominated by the ex-DEC side.

   :DEC Wars: n.  A 1983 {Usenet} posting by Alan Hastings    and Steve
Tarr spoofing the "Star Wars" movies in hackish    terms.  Some years
later, ESR (disappointed by Hastings and Tarr's    failure to exploit a
great premise more thoroughly) posted a    3-times-longer complete
rewrite called    Unix WARS
(http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/unixwars.html);    the two are
often confused.

   :decay: n.,vi  [from nuclear physics] An automatic conversion which
 is applied to most array-valued expressions in {C}; they `decay
into' pointer-valued expressions pointing to the array's first
element.  This term is borderline techspeak, but is not used in the
official standard for the language.

   :deckle: /dek'l/ n.  [from dec- and {nybble}; the original
spelling seems to have been `decle'] Two {nickle}s; 10    bits.
Reported among developers for Mattel's GI 1600 (the    Intellivision
games processor), a chip with 16-bit-wide RAM but    10-bit-wide ROM.
See {nybble} for other such terms.

   :DED: /D-E-D/ n.  Dark-Emitting Diode (that is, a burned-out
LED).  Compare {SED}, {LER}, {write-only memory}.  In the    early
1970s both Signetics and Texas instruments released DED spec    sheets
as {AFJ}s (suggested uses included "as a power-off    indicator").

   :deep hack mode: n.  See {hack mode}.

   :deep magic: n.  [poss. from C. S. Lewis's "Narnia"    books] An
awesomely arcane technique central to a program or    system, esp. one
neither generally published nor available to    hackers at large
(compare {black art}); one that could only have    been composed by a
true {wizard}.  Compiler optimization    techniques and many aspects of
{OS} design used to be {deep    magic}; many techniques in
cryptography, signal processing,    graphics, and AI still are.
Compare {heavy wizardry}.  Esp.     found in comments of the form "Deep
magic begins here...".     Compare {voodoo programming}.

   :deep space: n.  1. Describes the notional location of any
program that has gone {off the trolley}.  Esp. used of    programs that
just sit there silently grinding long after either    failure or some
output is expected.  "Uh oh.  I should have gotten    a prompt ten
seconds ago.  The program's in deep space somewhere."     Compare
{buzz}, {catatonic}, {hyperspace}.  2. The    metaphorical location of
a human so dazed and/or confused or caught    up in some esoteric form
of {bogosity} that he or she no longer    responds coherently to normal
communication.  Compare {page    out}.

   :defenestration: n.  [from the traditional Czechoslovakian    method
of assassinating prime ministers, via SF fandom] 1. Proper    karmic
retribution for an incorrigible punster.  "Oh, ghod, that    was
_awful_!"  "Quick! Defenestrate him!"  2. The act of    exiting a
window system in order to get better response time from a
full-screen program.  This comes from the dictionary meaning of
`defenestrate', which is to throw something out a window.  3. The
act of discarding something under the assumption that it will
improve matters.  "I don't have any disk space left."  "Well,    why
don't you defenestrate that 100 megs worth of old core dumps?"     4.
Under a GUI, the act of dragging something out of a window    (onto the
screen). "Next, defenestrate the MugWump icon."     5. The act of
completely removing Micro$oft Windows from a PC in    favor of a better
OS (typically Linux).

   :defined as: adj.  In the role of, usually in an
organization-chart sense.  "Pete is currently defined as bug
prioritizer."  Compare {logical}.

   :dehose: /dee-hohz/ vt.  To clear a {hosed} condition.

   :deliminator: /de-lim'-in-ay-t*r/ n.  [portmanteau,    delimiter +
eliminate]  A string or pattern used to delimit text into    fields,
but which is itself eliminated from the resulting list of    fields.
This jargon seems to have originated among Perl hackers in
connection with the Perl split() function; however, it has been
sighted in live use among Java and even Visual Basic programmers.

   :delint: /dee-lint/ v. obs.  To modify code to remove    problems
detected when {lint}ing.  Confusingly, this process is    also referred
to as `linting' code.  This term is no longer in    general use because
ANSI C compilers typically issue compile-time    warnings almost as
detailed as lint warnings.

   :delta: n.  1. [techspeak] A quantitative change, especially a
small or incremental one (this use is general in physics and
engineering).  "I just doubled the speed of my program!"  "What    was
the delta on program size?"  "About 30 percent."  (He    doubled the
speed of his program, but increased its size by only 30    percent.)
2. [Unix] A {diff}, especially a {diff} stored    under the set of
version-control tools called SCCS (Source Code    Control System) or
RCS (Revision Control System).  3. n. A small    quantity, but not as
small as {epsilon}.  The jargon usage of    {delta} and {epsilon} stems
from the traditional use of these    letters in mathematics for very
small numerical quantities,    particularly in `epsilon-delta' proofs
in limit theory (as in the    differential calculus).  The term {delta}
is often used, once    {epsilon} has been mentioned, to mean a quantity
that is    slightly bigger than {epsilon} but still very small.  "The
cost    isn't epsilon, but it's delta" means that the cost isn't totally
  negligible, but it is nevertheless very small.  Common
constructions include `within delta of --', `within epsilon of    --':
that is, `close to' and `even closer to'.

   :demented: adj.  Yet another term of disgust used to    describe a
malfunctioning program.  The connotation in this case is    that the
program works as designed, but the design is bad.  Said,    for
example, of a program that generates large numbers of    meaningless
error messages, implying that it is on the brink of    imminent
collapse.  Compare {wonky}, {brain-damaged},    {bozotic}.

   :demigod: n.  A hacker with years of experience, a    world-wide
reputation, and a major role in the development of at    least one
design, tool, or game used by or known to more than half    of the
hacker community.  To qualify as a genuine demigod, the    person must
recognizably identify with the hacker community and    have helped
shape it.  Major demigods include Ken Thompson and    Dennis Ritchie
(co-inventors of {{Unix}} and {C}), Richard    M. Stallman (inventor of
{EMACS}), Larry Wall (inventor of    {Perl}), Linus Torvalds (inventor
of Linux), and most recently    James Gosling (inventor of Java).  In
their hearts of hearts, most    hackers dream of someday becoming
demigods themselves, and more    than one major software project has
been driven to completion by    the author's veiled hopes of
apotheosis.  See also {net.god},    {true-hacker}.

   :demo: /de'moh/  [short for `demonstration'] 1. v. To    demonstrate
a product or prototype.  A far more effective way of    inducing bugs
to manifest than any number of {test} runs,    especially when
important people are watching.  2. n. The act    of demoing.  "I've
gotta give a demo of the drool-proof interface;    how does it work
again?"  3. n. Esp. as `demo version', can    refer either to an early,
barely-functional version of a program    which can be used for
demonstration purposes as long as the    operator uses _exactly_ the
right commands and skirts its    numerous bugs, deficiencies, and
unimplemented portions, or to a    special version of a program
(frequently with some features    crippled) which is distributed at
little or no cost to the user for    enticement purposes.  4.
[{demoscene}] A sequence of    {demoeffect}s (usually) combined with
self-composed music and    hand-drawn ("pixelated") graphics. These
days (1997) usually    built to attend a {compo}. Often called
`eurodemos' outside    Europe, as most of the {demoscene} activity
seems to have gathered    in northern Europe and especially
Scandinavia.  See also    {intro}, {dentro}.

   :demo mode: n.  1. [Sun] The state of being {heads down}    in order
to finish code in time for a {demo}, usually due    yesterday.  2. A
mode in which video games sit by themselves    running through a
portion of the game, also known as `attract    mode'.  Some serious
{app}s have a demo mode they use as a    screen saver, or may go
through a demo mode on startup (for    example, the Microsoft Windows
opening screen -- which lets you    impress your neighbors without
actually having to put up with    {Microsloth Windows}).

   :demoeffect: n.  [{demoscene}] What among hackers is    called a
{display hack}. Classical effects include "plasma"    (colorful mess),
"keftales" (x*x+y*y and other similar    patterns, usually combined
with color-cycling), realtime fractals,    realtime 3d graphics, etc.
Historically, demo effects have cheated    as much as possible to gain
more speed and more complexity, using    low-precision math and masses
of assembler code and building    animation realtime are three common
tricks, but use of special    hardware to fake effects is a {Good
Thing} on the demoscene    (though this is becoming less common as
platforms like the Amiga    fade away).

   :demogroup: n.  [{demoscene}] A group of {demo}    (sense 4)
composers.  Job titles within a group include coders (the    ones who
write programs), graphicians (the ones who painstakingly    pixelate
the fine art), musicians (the music composers),    {sysop}s,
traders/swappers (the ones who do the trading and    other PR), and
organizers (in larger groups).  It is not uncommon    for one person to
do multiple jobs, but it has been observed that    good coders are
rarely good composers and vice versa. [How odd.     Musical talent
seems common among Internet/Unix hackers --ESR]

   :demon: n.  1. [MIT] A portion of a program that is not    invoked
explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some    condition(s) to
occur.  See {daemon}.  The distinction is that    demons are usually
processes within a program, while daemons are    usually programs
running on an operating system.  2. [outside MIT]    Often used
equivalently to {daemon} -- especially in the    {{Unix}} world, where
the latter spelling and pronunciation is    considered mildly archaic.

   Demons in sense 1 are particularly common in AI programs.  For
example, a knowledge-manipulation program might implement inference
rules as demons.  Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added,
various demons would activate (which demons depends on the
particular piece of data) and would create additional pieces of
knowledge by applying their respective inference rules to the
original piece.  These new pieces could in turn activate more    demons
as the inferences filtered down through chains of logic.     Meanwhile,
the main program could continue with whatever its    primary task was.

   :demon dialer: n.  A program which repeatedly calls the same
telephone number.  Demon dialing may be benign (as when a number of
communications programs contend for legitimate access to a {BBS}
line) or malign (that is, used as a prank or denial-of-service
attack).  This term dates from the {blue box} days of the 1970s    and
early 1980s and is now semi-obsolescent among {phreaker}s;    see {war
dialer} for its contemporary progeny.

   :demoparty: n.  [{demoscene}] Aboveground descendant of    the
{copyparty}, with emphasis shifted away from software piracy    and
towards {compo}s. Smaller demoparties, for 100 persons or    less, are
held quite often, sometimes even once a month, and    usually last for
one to two days. On the other end of the scale,    huge demo parties
are held once a year (and four of these have    grown very large and
occur annually - Assembly in Finland, The    Party in Denmark, The
Gathering in Norway, and NAID somewhere in    north America). These
parties usually last for three to five days,    have room for 3000-5000
people, and have a party network with    connection to the internet.

   :demoscene: /dem'oh-seen/  [also `demo scene'] A culture of
multimedia hackers located primarily in Scandinavia and northern
Europe. Demoscene folklore recounts that when old-time {warez    d00dz}
cracked some piece of software they often added an    advertisement of
in the beginning, usually containing colorful    {display hack}s with
greetings to other cracking groups.  The    demoscene was born among
people who decided building these display    hacks is more interesting
than hacking and began to build    self-contained display hacks of
considerable elaboration and beauty    (within the culture such a hack
is called a {demo}).  The split    seems to have happened at the end of
the 1980s.  As more of these    {demogroup}s emerged, they started to
have {compo}s at    copying parties (see {copyparty}), which later
evolved to    standalone events (see {demoparty}).  The demoscene has
retained    some traits from the {warez d00dz}, including their style of
  handles and group names and some of their jargon.

   Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of
 smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the
like.  Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and
a couple of years after that, they also started using Java.

   Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its
original platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under
DOS) die out and activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the
Internet.  While deeply underground in the past, demoscene is    trying
to get into the mainstream as accepted art form, and one    symptom of
this is the commercialization of bigger    demoparties. Older
demosceneers frown at this, but the majority think    it's a good
direction.  Many demosceneers end up working in the    computer game
industry.   Demoscene resource pages are available at
`http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/' and
`http://www.scene.org/'.

   :dentro: /den'troh/  [{demoscene}] Combination of    {demo} (sense
4) and {intro}. Other name mixings include    intmo, dentmo etc. and
are used usually when the authors are not    quite sure whether the
program is a {demo} or an {intro}.     Special purposes coinages like
wedtro (some member of a group got    married), invtro (invitation
intro) etc. have also been    sighted.

   :depeditate: /dee-ped'*-tayt/ n.  [by (faulty) analogy with
`decapitate'] Humorously, to cut off the feet of.  When one is    using
some computer-aided typesetting tools, careless placement of    text
blocks within a page or above a rule can result in chopped-off
letter descenders.  Such letters are said to have been depeditated.

   :deprecated: adj.  Said of a program or feature that is
considered obsolescent and in the process of being phased out,
usually in favor of a specified replacement.  Deprecated features
can, unfortunately, linger on for many years.  This term appears
with distressing frequency in standards documents when the
committees writing the documents realize that large amounts of
extant (and presumably happily working) code depend on the
feature(s) that have passed out of favor.  See also {dusty    deck}.

   :derf: /derf/ v.,n.  [PLATO] The act of exploiting a    terminal
which someone else has absentmindedly left logged on, to    use that
person's account, especially to post articles intended to    make an
ass of the victim you're impersonating.  It has been    alleged that
the term originated as a reversal of the name of the    gentleman who
most usually left himself vulnerable to it, who also    happened to be
the head of the department that handled PLATO at the    University of
Delaware.

   :deserves to lose: adj.  [common] Said of someone who    willfully
does the {Wrong Thing}; humorously, if one uses a    feature known to
be {marginal}.  What is meant is that one    deserves the consequences
of one's {losing} actions.  "Boy,    anyone who tries to use {mess-dos}
deserves to {lose}!"     ({{ITS}} fans used to say the same thing of
{{Unix}}; many still    do.)  See also {screw}, {chomp}, {bagbiter}.

   :desk check: n.,v.  To {grovel} over hardcopy of source    code,
mentally simulating the control flow; a method of catching    bugs.  No
longer common practice in this age of on-screen editing,    fast
compiles, and sophisticated debuggers -- though some maintain
stoutly that it ought to be.  Compare {eyeball search},    {vdiff},
{vgrep}.

   :despew: /d*-spyoo'/ v.  [Usenet] To automatically generate    a
large amount of garbage to the net, esp. from an automated    posting
program gone wild.  See {ARMM}.

   :Devil Book: n.  See {daemon book}, the term preferred by    its
authors.

   :/dev/null: /dev-nuhl/ n.  [from the Unix null device, used    as a
data sink] A notional `black hole' in any information space    being
discussed, used, or referred to.  A controversial posting,    for
example, might end "Kudos to rasputin@kremlin.org, flames to
/dev/null".  See {bit bucket}.

   :dickless workstation: n.  Extremely pejorative hackerism for
`diskless workstation', a class of botches including the Sun 3/50
and other machines designed exclusively to network with an    expensive
central disk server.  These combine all the disadvantages    of
time-sharing with all the disadvantages of distributed personal
computers; typically, they cannot even {boot} themselves without
help (in the form of some kind of {breath-of-life packet}) from    the
server.

   :dictionary flame: n.  [Usenet] An attempt to sidetrack a    debate
away from issues by insisting on meanings for key terms that
presuppose a desired conclusion or smuggle in an implicit premise.
A common tactic of people who prefer argument over definitions to
disputes about reality.  Compare {spelling flame}.

   :diddle:  1. vt. To work with or modify in a not particularly
serious manner.  "I diddled a copy of {ADVENT} so it didn't
double-space all the time."  "Let's diddle this piece of code and
see if the problem goes away."  See {tweak} and {twiddle}.     2. n.
The action or result of diddling.  See also {tweak},    {twiddle},
{frob}.

   :die: v.  Syn. {crash}.  Unlike {crash}, which is used    primarily
of hardware, this verb is used of both hardware and    software.  See
also {go flatline}, {casters-up mode}.

   :die horribly: v.  The software equivalent of {crash and    burn},
and the preferred emphatic form of {die}.  "The    converter choked on
an FF in its input and died horribly".

   :diff: /dif/ n.  1. A change listing, especially giving
differences between (and additions to) source code or documents    (the
term is often used in the plural `diffs').  "Send me your    diffs for
the Jargon File!"  Compare {vdiff}.  2. Specifically,    such a listing
produced by the `diff(1)' command, esp. when    used as specification
input to the `patch(1)' utility (which    can actually perform the
modifications; see {patch}).  This is a    common method of
distributing patches and source updates in the    Unix/C world.  3. v.
To compare (whether or not by use of automated    tools on
machine-readable files); see also {vdiff}, {mod}.

   :digit: n.,obs.  An employee of Digital Equipment    Corporation.
See also {VAX}, {VMS}, {PDP-10},    {{TOPS-10}}, {field circus}.

   :dike: vt.  To remove or disable a portion of something, as a
wire from a computer or a subroutine from a program.  A standard
slogan is "When in doubt, dike it out".  (The implication is that    it
is usually more effective to attack software problems by    reducing
complexity than by increasing it.)  The word `dikes' is    widely used
among mechanics and engineers to mean `diagonal    cutters', esp. the
heavy-duty metal-cutting version, but may also    refer to a kind of
wire-cutters used by electronics techs.  To    `dike something out'
means to use such cutters to remove    something.  Indeed, the TMRC
Dictionary defined dike as "to attack    with dikes".  Among hackers
this term has been metaphorically    extended to informational objects
such as sections of code.

   :Dilbert:   n. Name and title character of a comic strip
nationally syndicated in the U.S. and enormously popular among
hackers.  Dilbert is an archetypical engineer-nerd who works at an
anonymous high-technology company; the strips present a lacerating
satire of insane working conditions and idiotic {management}
practices all too readily recognized by hackers.  Adams, who spent
nine years in {cube} 4S700R at Pacific Bell (not {DEC} as often
reported), often remarks that he has never been able to come up    with
a fictional management blunder that his correspondents didn't
quickly either report to have actually happened or top with a
similar but even more bizarre incident.  In 1996 Adams distilled    his
insights into the collective psychology of businesses into an    even
funnier book, "The Dilbert Principle" (HarperCollins,    ISBN
0-887-30787-6).  See also {pointy-haired}, {rat dance}.

   :ding: n.,vi.  1. Synonym for {feep}.  Usage: rare among    hackers,
but commoner in the {Real World}.  2. `dinged': What    happens when
someone in authority gives you a minor bitching about    something,
esp. something trivial.  "I was dinged for having a    messy desk."

   :dink: /dink/ adj.  Said of a machine that has the {bitty    box}
nature; a machine too small to be worth bothering with --    sometimes
the system you're currently forced to work on.  First    heard from an
MIT hacker working on a CP/M system with 64K, in    reference to any
6502 system, then from fans of 32-bit    architectures about 16-bit
machines.  "GNUMACS will never work on    that dink machine."  Probably
derived from mainstream `dinky',    which isn't sufficiently
pejorative.  See {macdink}.

   :dinosaur: n.  1. Any hardware requiring raised flooring and
special power.  Used especially of old minis and mainframes, in
contrast with newer microprocessor-based machines.  In a famous
quote from the 1988 Unix EXPO, Bill Joy compared the liquid-cooled
mainframe in the massive IBM display with a grazing dinosaur "with    a
truck outside pumping its bodily fluids through it".  IBM was    not
amused.  Compare {big iron}; see also {mainframe}.     2. [IBM] A very
conservative user; a {zipperhead}.

   :dinosaur pen: n.  A traditional {mainframe} computer room
complete with raised flooring, special power, its own
ultra-heavy-duty air conditioning, and a side order of Halon fire
extinguishers.  See {boa}.

   :dinosaurs mating: n.  Said to occur when yet another    {big iron}
merger or buyout occurs; reflects a perception by    hackers that these
signal another stage in the long, slow dying of    the {mainframe}
industry.  In its glory days of the 1960s, it    was `IBM and the Seven
Dwarves': Burroughs, Control Data, General    Electric, Honeywell, NCR,
RCA, and Univac.  RCA and GE sold out    early, and it was `IBM and the
Bunch' (Burroughs, Univac, NCR,    Control Data, and Honeywell) for a
while.  Honeywell was bought out    by Bull; Burroughs merged with
Univac to form Unisys (in 1984 --    this was when the phrase
`dinosaurs mating' was coined); and in    1991 AT&T absorbed NCR (but
spat it back out a few years    later). Control Data still exists but
is no longer in the mainframe    business.  More such earth-shaking
unions of doomed giants seem    inevitable.

   :dirtball: n.  [XEROX PARC] A small, perhaps struggling    outsider;
not in the major or even the minor leagues.  For example,    "Xerox is
not a dirtball company".

   [Outsiders often observe in the PARC culture an institutional
arrogance which usage of this term exemplifies.  The brilliance and
scope of PARC's contributions to computer science have been such
that this superior attitude is not much resented. --ESR]

   :dirty power: n.  Electrical mains voltage that is unfriendly    to
the delicate innards of computers.  Spikes, {drop-outs},    average
voltage significantly higher or lower than nominal, or just    plain
noise can all cause problems of varying subtlety and severity    (these
are collectively known as {power hit}s).

   :disclaimer: n.  [Usenet] Statement ritually appended to many
Usenet postings (sometimes automatically, by the posting software)
reiterating the fact (which should be obvious, but is easily
forgotten) that the article reflects its author's opinions and not
necessarily those of the organization running the machine through
which the article entered the network.

   :Discordianism: /dis-kor'di-*n-ism/ n.  The veneration of    {Eris},
a.k.a. Discordia; widely popular among hackers.     Discordianism was
popularized by Robert Shea and Robert Anton    Wilson's novel
"{Illuminatus!}" as a sort of    self-subverting Dada-Zen for
Westerners -- it should on no account    be taken seriously but is far
more serious than most jokes.     Consider, for example, the Fifth
Commandment of the Pentabarf, from    "Principia Discordia": "A
Discordian is Prohibited of    Believing What he Reads."  Discordianism
is usually connected with    an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke
involving millennia-long    warfare between the anarcho-surrealist
partisans of Eris and a    malevolent, authoritarian secret society
called the Illuminati.     See {Religion} in Appendix B, {Church of the
  SubGenius}, and {ha ha only serious}.

   :disk farm: n.  (also {laundromat}) A large room or rooms    filled
with disk drives (esp. {washing machine}s).

   :display hack: n.  A program with the same approximate    purpose as
a kaleidoscope: to make pretty pictures.  Famous display    hacks
include {munching squares}, {smoking clover}, the BSD    Unix `rain(6)'
program, `worms(6)' on miscellaneous    Unixes, and the {X} `kaleid(1)'
program.  Display hacks can    also be implemented by creating text
files containing numerous    escape sequences for interpretation by a
video terminal; one    notable example displayed, on any VT100, a
Christmas tree with    twinkling lights and a toy train circling its
base.  The {hack    value} of a display hack is proportional to the
esthetic value of    the images times the cleverness of the algorithm
divided by the    size of the code.  Syn. {psychedelicware}.

   :dispress: vt.  [contraction of `Dissociated Press' due to
eight-character MS-DOS filenames] To apply the {Dissociated Press}
algorithm to a block of text. The resultant output is also referred to
 as a 'dispression'.

   :Dissociated Press: n.  [play on `Associated Press'; perhaps
inspired by a reference in the 1950 Bugs Bunny cartoon    "What's Up,
Doc?"] An algorithm for transforming any text    into potentially
humorous garbage even more efficiently than by    passing it through a
{marketroid}.  The algorithm starts by    printing any N consecutive
words (or letters) in the text.     Then at every step it searches for
any random occurrence in the    original text of the last N words (or
letters) already    printed and then prints the next word or letter.
{EMACS} has a    handy command for this.  Here is a short example of
word-based    Dissociated Press applied to an earlier version of this
Jargon    File:

     wart: n. A small, crocky {feature} that sticks out of an array (C
     has no checks for this).  This is relatively benign and easy to
     spot if the phrase is bent so as to be not worth paying attention
     to the medium in question.

   Here is a short example of letter-based Dissociated Press applied
to the same source:

     window sysIWYG: n. A bit was named aften /bee't*/ prefer to use
     the other guy's re, especially in every cast a chuckle on neithout
     getting into useful informash speech makes removing a featuring a
     move or usage actual abstractionsidered interj. Indeed spectace
     logic or problem!

   A hackish idle pastime is to apply letter-based Dissociated Press
to a random body of text and {vgrep} the output in hopes of finding
an interesting new word.  (In the preceding example, `window
sysIWYG' and `informash' show some promise.)  Iterated applications
of Dissociated Press usually yield better results.  Similar
techniques called `travesty generators' have been employed with
considerable satirical effect to the utterances of Usenet flamers;
see {pseudo}.

   :distribution: n.  1. A software source tree packaged for
distribution; but see {kit}.  2. A vague term encompassing    mailing
lists and Usenet newsgroups (but not {BBS} {fora});    any
topic-oriented message channel with multiple recipients.  3. An
information-space domain (usually loosely correlated with    geography)
to which propagation of a Usenet message is restricted;    a
much-underutilized feature.

   :disusered: adj.  [Usenet] Said of a person whose account on a
computer has been removed, esp. for cause rather than through    normal
attrition.  "He got disusered when they found out he'd been    cracking
through the school's Internet access."  The verbal form    `disuser' is
live but less common.  Both usages probably derive    from the DISUSER
account status flag on VMS; setting it disables    the account.
Compare {star out}.

   :do protocol: vi.  [from network protocol programming] To    perform
an interaction with somebody or something that follows a    clearly
defined procedure.  For example, "Let's do protocol with    the check"
at a restaurant means to ask for the check, calculate    the tip and
everybody's share, collect money from everybody,    generate change as
necessary, and pay the bill.  See {protocol}.

   :doc: /dok/ n.  Common spoken and written shorthand for
`documentation'.  Often used in the plural `docs' and in the
construction `doc file' (i.e., documentation available on-line).

   :documentation:: n.  The multiple kilograms of macerated,
pounded, steamed, bleached, and pressed trees that accompany most
modern software or hardware products (see also {tree-killer}).
Hackers seldom read paper documentation and (too) often resist
writing it; they prefer theirs to be terse and on-line.  A common
comment on this predilection is "You can't {grep} dead trees".     See
{drool-proof paper}, {verbiage}, {treeware}.

   :dodgy: adj.  Syn. with {flaky}.  Preferred outside the    U.S.

   :dogcow: /dog'kow/ n.  See {Moof}.  The dogcow is a
semi-legendary creature that lurks in the depths of the Macintosh
Technical Notes Hypercard stack V3.1.  The full story of the dogcow
is told in technical note #31 (the particular dogcow illustrated is
properly named `Clarus').  Option-shift-click will cause it to emit
a characteristic `Moof!' or `!fooM' sound.  _Getting_ to tech    note
31 is the hard part; to discover how to do that, one must    needs
examine the stack script with a hackerly eye.  Clue:    {rot13} is
involved.  A dogcow also appears if you choose `Page    Setup...' with
a LaserWriter selected and click on the    `Options' button.  It also
lurks in other Mac printer drivers,    notably those for the
now-discontinued Style Writers.

   :dogfood: n.  [Microsoft, Netscape] Interim software used
internally for testing.  "To eat one's own dogfood" (from which    the
slang noun derives) means to use the software one is    developing, as
part of one's everyday development environment (the    phrase is used
outside Microsoft and Netscape). The practice is    normal in the Linux
community and elsewhere, but the term    `dogfood' is seldom used as
open-source betas tend to be quite    tasty and nourishing.  The idea
is that developers who are using    their own software will quickly
learn what's missing or broken.     Dogfood is typically not even of
{beta} quality.

   :dogpile: v.  [Usenet: prob. fr. mainstream "puppy pile"]    When
many people post unfriendly responses in short order to a    single
posting, they are sometimes said to "dogpile" or "dogpile    on" the
person to whom they're responding.  For example, when a    religious
missionary posts a simplistic appeal to alt.atheism,    he can expect
to be dogpiled.  It has been suggested that this    derives from U.S,
football slang for a tackle involving three or    more people.

   :dogwash: /dog'wosh/  [From a quip in the `urgency' field    of a
very optional software change request, ca. 1982.  It was    something
like "Urgency: Wash your dog first".] 1. n. A project    of minimal
priority, undertaken as an escape from more serious    work.  2. v.  To
engage in such a project.  Many games and much    {freeware} get
written this way.

   :domainist: /doh-mayn'ist/ adj.  1. [Usenet, by pointed    analogy
with "sexist", "racist", etc.] Someone who judges    people by the
domain of their email addresses; esp. someone who    dismisses anyone
who posts from a public internet provider. "What    do you expect from
an article posted from aol.com?"  2. Said of an    {{Internet address}}
(as opposed to a {bang path}) because the    part to the right of the
`@' specifies a nested series of    `domains'; for example,
<esr@snark.thyrsus.com> specifies    the machine called snark in the
subdomain called thyrsus    within the top-level domain called com.
See also    {big-endian}, sense 2.

   The meaning of this term has drifted.  At one time sense 2 was
primary.  In elder days it was also used of a site, mailer, or
routing program which knew how to handle domainist addresses; or of
a person (esp. a site admin) who preferred domain addressing,
supported a domainist mailer, or proselytized for domainist
addressing and disdained {bang path}s.  These senses are now    (1996)
obsolete, as effectively all sites have converted.

   :Don't do that then!: imp.  [from an old doctor's office joke
about a patient with a trivial complaint] Stock response to a user
complaint.  "When I type control-S, the whole system comes to a    halt
for thirty seconds."  "Don't do that, then!" (or "So don't    do
that!").  Compare {RTFM}.

   :dongle: /dong'gl/ n.  1. A security or {copy protection}    device
for commercial microcomputer programs consisting of a    serialized
EPROM and some drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which    must be
connected to an I/O port of the computer while the program    is run.
Programs that use a dongle query the port at startup and    at
programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does not
respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus, users
can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay    for
each dongle.  The idea was clever, but it was initially a    failure,
as users disliked tying up a serial port this way.  Almost    all
dongles on the market today (1993) will pass data through the    port
and monitor for {magic} codes (and combinations of status    lines)
with minimal if any interference with devices further down    the line
-- this innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained    dongles for
multiple pieces of software.  The devices are still not    widely used,
as the industry has moved away from copy-protection    schemes in
general.  2. By extension, any physical electronic key    or
transferable ID required for a program to function.  Common
variations on this theme have used parallel or even joystick ports.
See {dongle-disk}.

   [Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a
 manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived
from "Don Gall", allegedly the inventor of the device.  The
company's receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a
myth invented for the ad copy.  Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt
my life as a lexicographer for at least the next ten years. :-(
--ESR]

   :dongle-disk: /don'gl disk/ n.  A special floppy disk that    is
required in order to perform some task.  Some contain special    coding
that allows an application to identify it uniquely, others    _are_
special code that does something that normally-resident    programs
don't or can't.  (For example, AT&T's "Unix PC" would    only come up
in {root mode} with a special boot disk.)  Also    called a `key disk'.
See {dongle}.

   :donuts: n. obs.  A collective noun for any set of memory bits.
This usage is extremely archaic and may no longer be live jargon;    it
dates from the days of ferrite-{core} memories in which each    bit was
implemented by a doughnut-shaped magnetic flip-flop.

   :doorstop: n.  Used to describe equipment that is    non-functional
and halfway expected to remain so, especially    obsolete equipment
kept around for political reasons or ostensibly    as a backup.  "When
we get another Wyse-50 in here, that ADM 3    will turn into a
doorstop."  Compare {boat anchor}.

   :DoS attack: //  [Usenet] Abbreviation for Denial-Of-Service
attack.  This abbreviation is most often used of attempts to shut
down newsgroups with floods of {spam}.

   :dot file: [Unix] n.  A file that is not visible by default to
normal directory-browsing tools (on Unix, files named with a    leading
dot are, by convention, not normally presented in directory
listings).  Many programs define one or more dot files in which
startup or configuration information may be optionally recorded; a
user can customize the program's behavior by creating the
appropriate file in the current or home directory.  (Therefore, dot
files tend to {creep} -- with every nontrivial application    program
defining at least one, a user's home directory can be    filled with
scores of dot files, of course without the user's    really being aware
of it.)  See also {profile} (sense 1), {rc    file}.

   :double bucky: adj.  Using both the CTRL and META keys.  "The
command to burn all LEDs is double bucky F."

   This term originated on the Stanford extended-ASCII keyboard, and
was later taken up by users of the {space-cadet keyboard} at    MIT.  A
typical MIT comment was that the Stanford {bucky bits}    (control and
meta shifting keys) were nice, but there weren't    enough of them; you
could type only 512 different characters on a    Stanford keyboard.  An
obvious way to address this was simply to    add more shifting keys,
and this was eventually done; but a    keyboard with that many shifting
keys is hard on touch-typists, who    don't like to move their hands
away from the home position on the    keyboard.  It was half-seriously
suggested that the extra shifting    keys be implemented as pedals;
typing on such a keyboard would be    very much like playing a full
pipe organ.  This idea is mentioned    in a parody of a very fine song
by Jeffrey Moss called    "Rubber Duckie", which was published in "The
Sesame    Street Songbook" (Simon and Schuster 1971, ISBN
0-671-21036-X).     These lyrics were written on May 27, 1978, in
celebration of the    Stanford keyboard:

     			Double Bucky

     	Double bucky, you're the one!
     	You make my keyboard lots of fun.
     	    Double bucky, an additional bit or two:
     	(Vo-vo-de-o!)
     	Control and meta, side by side,
     	Augmented ASCII, nine bits wide!
     	    Double bucky!  Half a thousand glyphs, plus a few!
     		Oh,
     		I sure wish that I
     		Had a couple of
     		    Bits more!
     		Perhaps a
     		Set of pedals to
     		Make the number of
     		    Bits four:
     		Double double bucky!
     	Double bucky, left and right
     	OR'd together, outta sight!
     	    Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of
     	    Double bucky, I'm happy I heard of
     	    Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of you!

     	--- The Great Quux (with apologies to Jeffrey Moss)

   [This, by the way, is an excellent example of computer {filk}
--ESR]  See also {meta bit}, {cokebottle}, and {quadruple    bucky}.

   :doubled sig: [Usenet] n.  A {sig block} that has been    included
twice in a {Usenet} article or, less commonly, in an    electronic mail
message.  An article or message with a doubled sig    can be caused by
improperly configured software.  More often,    however, it reveals the
author's lack of experience in electronic    communication.  See
{B1FF}, {pseudo}.

   :down:  1. adj. Not operating.  "The up escalator is down"    is
considered a humorous thing to say (unless of course you were
expecting to use it), and "The elevator is down" always means    "The
elevator isn't working" and never refers to what floor the    elevator
is on.  With respect to computers, this term has passed    into the
mainstream; the extension to other kinds of machine is    still
confined to techies (e.g. boiler mechanics may speak of a    boiler
being down).  2. `go down' vi. To stop functioning;    usually said of
the {system}.  The message from the {console}    that every hacker
hates to hear from the operator is "System going    down in 5 minutes".
3. `take down', `bring down' vt. To    deactivate purposely, usually
for repair work or {PM}.  "I'm    taking the system down to work on
that bug in the tape drive."     Occasionally one hears the word `down'
by itself used as a verb    in this vt. sense.  See {crash}; oppose
{up}.

   :download: vt.  To transfer data or (esp.) code from a    larger
`host' system (esp. a {mainframe}) over a digital    comm link to a
smaller `client' system, esp. a microcomputer    or specialized
peripheral.  Oppose {upload}.

   However, note that ground-to-space communications has its own usage
 rule for this term.  Space-to-earth transmission is always `down'
and the reverse `up' regardless of the relative size of the
computers involved.  So far the in-space machines have invariably
been smaller; thus the upload/download distinction has been    reversed
from its usual sense.

   :DP: /D-P/ n.  1. Data Processing.  Listed here because,
according to hackers, use of the term marks one immediately as a
{suit}.  See {DPer}.  2. Common abbrev for {Dissociated    Press}.

   :DPB: /d*-pib'/ vt.  [from the PDP-10 instruction set] To    plop
something down in the middle.  Usage: silly.  "DPB yourself    into
that couch there."  The connotation would be that the couch    is full
except for one slot just big enough for one last person to    sit in.
DPB means `DePosit Byte', and was the name of a PDP-10    instruction
that inserts some bits into the middle of some other    bits.  Hackish
usage has been kept alive by the Common LISP    function of the same
name.

   :DPer: /dee-pee-er/ n.  Data Processor.  Hackers are    absolutely
amazed that {suit}s use this term self-referentially.     _Computers_
process data, not people!  See {DP}.

   :Dr. Fred Mbogo: /*m-boh'goh, dok'tr fred/ n.     [Stanford] The
archetypal man you don't want to see about a    problem, esp. an
incompetent professional; a shyster.  "Do you    know a good eye
doctor?"  "Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and    Professional Dry Cleaning."
The name comes from synergy between    {bogus} and the original Dr.
Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez    Addams' physician on the old
"Addams Family" TV show.     Compare {Bloggs Family} and {J. Random
Hacker}; see also    {Fred Foobar} and {fred}.

   :dragon: n.  [MIT] A program similar to a {daemon}, except    that
it is not invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to
perform various secondary tasks.  A typical example would be an
accounting program, which keeps track of who is logged in,
accumulates load-average statistics, etc.  Under ITS, many    terminals
displayed a list of people logged in, where they were,    what they
were running, etc., along with some random picture (such    as a
unicorn, Snoopy, or the Enterprise), which was generated by    the
`name dragon'.  Usage: rare outside MIT -- under Unix and most    other
OSes this would be called a `background demon' or    {daemon}.  The
best-known Unix example of a dragon is    `cron(1)'.  At SAIL, they
called this sort of thing a    `phantom'.

   :Dragon Book: n.  The classic text "Compilers:    Principles,
Techniques and Tools", by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi,    and Jeffrey D.
Ullman (Addison-Wesley 1986; ISBN 0-201-10088-6),    so called because
of the cover design featuring a dragon labeled    `complexity of
compiler design' and a knight bearing the lance    `LALR parser
generator' among his other trappings.  This one is    more specifically
known as the `Red Dragon Book' (1986); an earlier    edition, sans
Sethi and titled "Principles Of Compiler Design"    (Alfred V. Aho and
Jeffrey D. Ullman; Addison-Wesley, 1977; ISBN    0-201-00022-9), was
the `Green Dragon Book' (1977).  (Also `New    Dragon Book', `Old
Dragon Book'.)  The horsed knight and the    Green Dragon were warily
eying each other at a distance; now the    knight is typing (wearing
gauntlets!) at a terminal showing a    video-game representation of the
Red Dragon's head while the rest    of the beast extends back in normal
space.  See also {{book    titles}}.

   :drain: v.  [IBM] Syn. for {flush} (sense 2).  Has a    connotation
of finality about it; one speaks of draining a device    before taking
it offline.

   :dread high-bit disease: n.  A condition endemic to some
now-obsolete computers and peripherals (including ASR-33 teletypes
and PRIME minicomputers) that results in all characters having    their
high (0x80) bit forced on.  This of course makes transporting    files
to other systems much more difficult, not to mention the    problems
these machines have talking with true 8-bit devices.

   This term was originally used specifically of PRIME (a.k.a.  PR1ME)
 minicomputers.  Folklore has it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit
  convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine;
PRIME old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the
disease from Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility
requirements and struggled heroically to cure it.  Whoever was
responsible, this probably qualifies as one of the most    {cretinous}
design tradeoffs ever made.  See {meta bit}.

   :Dread Questionmark Disease:  n. The result of saving HTML    from
Microsoft Word or some other program that uses the nonstandard
Microsoft variant of Latin-1; the symptom is that various of those
nonstandard characters in positions 128-160 show up as
questionmarks.  The usual culprit is the misnamed `smart quotes'
feature in Microsoft Word.  For more details (and a program called
`demoroniser' that cleans up the mess) see
`http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/demoroniser/'.

   :DRECNET: /drek'net/ n.  [from Yiddish/German `dreck',    meaning
filth] Deliberate distortion of DECNET, a networking    protocol used
in the {VMS} community.  So called because {DEC}    helped write the
Ethernet specification and then (either stupidly    or as a malignant
customer-control tactic) violated that spec in    the design of DRECNET
in a way that made it incompatible.  See also    {connector conspiracy}.

   :driver: n.  1. The {main loop} of an event-processing    program;
the code that gets commands and dispatches them for    execution.  2.
[techspeak] In `device driver', code designed to    handle a particular
peripheral device such as a magnetic disk or    tape unit.  3. In the
TeX world and the computerized typesetting    world in general, a
program that translates some device-independent    or other common
format to something a real device can actually    understand.

   :droid: n.  [from `android', SF terminology for a humanoid    robot
of essentially biological (as opposed to    mechanical/electronic)
construction] A person (esp. a    low-level bureaucrat or
service-business employee) exhibiting most    of the following
characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of    the parent
organization or `the system'; (b) a blind-faith    propensity to
believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures    (or
computers!); (c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or    unable
to look beyond the `letter of the law' in exceptional    situations;
(d) a paralyzing fear of official reprimand or worse if    Procedures
are not followed No Matter What; and (e) no interest in    doing
anything above or beyond the call of a very    narrowly-interpreted
duty, or in particular in fixing that which is    broken; an "It's not
my job, man" attitude.

   Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and
bank clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government
employees.  The implication is that the rules and official
procedures constitute software that the droid is executing;    problems
arise when the software has not been properly debugged.     The term
`droid mentality' is also used to describe the mindset    behind this
behavior. Compare {suit}, {marketroid}; see    {-oid}.

   In England there is equivalent mainstream slang; a `jobsworth' is
an obstructive, rule-following bureaucrat, often of the uniformed    or
suited variety.  Named for the habit of denying a reasonable    request
by sucking his teeth and saying "Oh no, guv, sorry I can't    help you:
that's more than my job's worth".

   :drool-proof paper: n.  Documentation that has been    obsessively
{dumbed down}, to the point where only a {cretin}    could bear to read
it, is said to have succumbed to the    `drool-proof paper syndrome' or
to have been `written on    drool-proof paper'.  For example, this is
an actual quote from    Apple's LaserWriter manual: "Do not expose your
LaserWriter to    open fire or flame."

   :drop on the floor: vt.  To react to an error condition by
silently discarding messages or other valuable data.  "The gateway
ran out of memory, so it just started dropping packets on the
floor."  Also frequently used of faulty mail and netnews relay    sites
that lose messages.  See also {black hole}, {bit    bucket}.

   :drop-ins: n.  [prob. by analogy with {drop-outs}]    Spurious
characters appearing on a terminal or console as a result    of line
noise or a system malfunction of some sort.  Esp. used    when these
are interspersed with one's own typed input.  Compare    {drop-outs},
sense 2.

   :drop-outs: n.  1. A variety of `power glitch' (see    {glitch});
momentary 0 voltage on the electrical mains.     2. Missing characters
in typed input due to software malfunction or    system saturation (one
cause of such behavior under Unix when a bad    connection to a modem
swamps the processor with spurious character    interrupts; see
{screaming tty}).  3. Mental glitches; used as a    way of describing
those occasions when the mind just seems to shut    down for a couple
of beats.  See {glitch}, {fried}.

   :drugged: adj.  (also `on drugs') 1. Conspicuously stupid,
heading toward {brain-damaged}.  Often accompanied by a    pantomime of
toking a joint.  2. Of hardware, very slow relative to    normal
performance.

   :drum: adj, n.  Ancient techspeak term referring to slow,
cylindrical magnetic media that were once state-of-the-art storage
devices.  Under BSD Unix the disk partition used for swapping is
still called `/dev/drum'; this has led to considerable humor    and not
a few straight-faced but utterly bogus `explanations'    getting
foisted on {newbie}s.  See also "{The Story of    Mel}" in Appendix A.

   :drunk mouse syndrome: n.  (also `mouse on drugs') A malady
exhibited by the mouse pointing device of some computers.  The
typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen to move in
random directions and not in sync with the motion of the actual
mouse.  Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse and
plugging it back again.  Another recommended fix for optical mice    is
to rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees.

   At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier
cleaner (isopropyl alcohol) at their desks.  When the steel ball on
the mouse had picked up enough {cruft} to be unreliable, the    mouse
was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while.     However, this
operation left a fine residue that accelerated the    accumulation of
cruft, so the dousings became more and more    frequent.  Finally, the
mouse was declared `alcoholic' and sent    to the clinic to be dried
out in a CFC ultrasonic bath.

   :Duff's device: n.  The most dramatic use yet seen of {fall
through} in C, invented by Tom Duff when he was at Lucasfilm.
Trying to {bum} all the instructions he could out of an inner    loop
that copied data serially onto an output port, he decided to    unroll
it.  He then realized that the unrolled version could be    implemented
by _interlacing_ the structures of a switch and a    loop:

        register n = (count + 7) / 8;      /* count > 0 assumed */

        switch (count % 8)
        {
        case 0:        do {  *to = *from++;
        case 7:              *to = *from++;
        case 6:              *to = *from++;
        case 5:              *to = *from++;
        case 4:              *to = *from++;
        case 3:              *to = *from++;
        case 2:              *to = *from++;
        case 1:              *to = *from++;
                           } while (--n > 0);
        }

Shocking though it appears to all who encounter it for the first
time, the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C.  C's default
{fall through} in case statements has long been its most
controversial single feature; Duff observed that "This code forms
some sort of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's
for or against." Duff has discussed the device in detail at
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html'.  Note    that the
omission of postfix `++' from `*to' was    intentional (though
confusing).  Duff's device can be used to    implement memory copy, but
the original aim was to copy values    serially into a magic IO
register.

   [For maximal obscurity, the outermost pair of braces above could be
 actually be removed -- GLS]

   :dumb terminal: n.  A terminal that is one step above a    {glass
tty}, having a minimally addressable cursor but no    on-screen editing
or other features normally supported by a    {smart terminal}.  Once
upon a time, when glass ttys were common    and addressable cursors
were something special, what is now called    a dumb terminal could
pass for a smart terminal.

   :dumbass attack: /duhm'as *-tak'/ n.  [Purdue] Notional    cause of
a novice's mistake made by the experienced, especially one    made
while running as {root} under Unix, e.g., typing `rm    -r *' or `mkfs'
on a mounted file system.  Compare {adger}.

   :dumbed down: adj.  Simplified, with a strong connotation of
_over_simplified.  Often, a {marketroid} will insist that    the
interfaces and documentation of software be dumbed down after    the
designer has burned untold gallons of midnight oil making it    smart.
This creates friction.  See {user-friendly}.

   :dump: n.  1. An undigested and voluminous mass of information
about a problem or the state of a system, especially one routed to
the slowest available output device (compare {core dump}), and    most
especially one consisting of hex or octal {runes}    describing the
byte-by-byte state of memory, mass storage, or some    file.  In {elder
days}, debugging was generally done by    `groveling over' a dump (see
{grovel}); increasing use of    high-level languages and interactive
debuggers has made such tedium    uncommon, and the term `dump' now has
a faintly archaic flavor.     2. A backup.  This usage is typical only
at large timesharing    installations.

   :dumpster diving: /dump'-ster di:'-ving/ n.  1. The practice    of
sifting refuse from an office or technical installation to    extract
confidential data, especially security-compromising    information
(`dumpster' is an Americanism for what is elsewhere    called a
`skip').  Back in AT&T's monopoly days, before paper    shredders
became common office equipment, phone phreaks (see    {phreaking}) used
to organize regular dumpster runs against    phone company plants and
offices.  Discarded and damaged copies of    AT&T internal manuals
taught them much.  The technique is still    rumored to be a favorite
of crackers operating against careless    targets.  2. The practice of
raiding the dumpsters behind buildings    where producers and/or
consumers of high-tech equipment are    located, with the expectation
(usually justified) of finding    discarded but still-valuable
equipment to be nursed back to health    in some hacker's den.
Experienced dumpster-divers not infrequently    accumulate basements
full of moldering (but still potentially    useful) {cruft}.

   :dup killer: /d[y]oop kill'r/ n.  [FidoNet] Software that is
supposed to detect and delete duplicates of a message that may have
reached the FidoNet system via different routes.

   :dup loop: /d[y]oop loop/ (also `dupe loop') n.  [FidoNet]    An
infinite stream of duplicated, near-identical messages on a    FidoNet
{echo}, the only difference being unique or mangled    identification
information applied by a faulty or incorrectly    configured system or
network gateway, thus rendering {dup    killer}s ineffective.  If such
a duplicate message eventually    reaches a system through which it has
already passed (with the    original identification information), all
systems passed on the way    back to that system are said to be
involved in a {dup loop}.

   :dusty deck: n.  Old software (especially applications) which    one
is obliged to remain compatible with, or to maintain ({DP}    types
call this `legacy code', a term hackers consider smarmy and
excessively reverent).  The term implies that the software in
question is a holdover from card-punch days.  Used esp. when
referring to old scientific and {number-crunching} software,    much of
which was written in FORTRAN and very poorly documented but    is
believed to be too expensive to replace.  See {fossil};    compare
{crawling horror}.

   :DWIM: /dwim/  [acronym, `Do What I Mean'] 1. adj. Able    to guess,
sometimes even correctly, the result intended when bogus    input was
provided.  2. n. obs. The BBNLISP/INTERLISP function    that attempted
to accomplish this feat by correcting many of the    more common
errors.  See {hairy}.  3. Occasionally, an    interjection hurled at a
balky computer, esp. when one senses one    might be tripping over
legalisms (see {legalese}).  4. Of a    person, someone whose
directions are incomprehensible and vague,    but who nevertheless has
the expectation that you will solve the    problem using the specific
method he/she has in mind.

   Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and
spelling errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and
would often make hash of anyone else's typos if they were
stylistically different.  Some victims of DWIM thus claimed that    the
acronym stood for `Damn Warren's Infernal Machine!'.

   In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the
command interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker
there typed `delete *$' to free up some disk space.  (The    editor
there named backup files by appending `$' to the    original file name,
so he was trying to delete any backup files    left over from old
editing sessions.)  It happened that there    weren't any editor backup
files, so DWIM helpfully reported    `*$ not found, assuming you meant
'delete *'.' It then started    to delete all the files on the disk!
The hacker managed to stop it    with a {Vulcan nerve pinch} after only
a half dozen or so files    were lost.

   The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go
to Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his
workstation, and then type `delete *$' twice.

   DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
program; it is also occasionally described as the single
instruction the ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of
program correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about
`DWIMC' (Do What I Mean, Correctly).  A related term, more often
seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing); see {Right Thing}.

   :dynner: /din'r/ n.  32 bits, by analogy with {nybble} and
{{byte}}.  Usage: rare and extremely silly.  See also {playte},
{tayste}, {crumb}.  General discussion of such terms is under
{nybble}.

=====

   :earthquake: n.  [IBM] The ultimate real-world shock test for
computer hardware.  Hackish sources at IBM deny the rumor that the
Bay Area quake of 1989 was initiated by the company to test
quality-assurance procedures at its California plants.

   :Easter egg: n.  [from the custom of the Easter Egg hunt    observed
in the U.S. and many parts of Europe] 1. A message hidden    in the
object code of a program as a joke, intended to be found by    persons
disassembling or browsing the code.  2. A message, graphic,    or sound
effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS ROM) in    response
to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes,    intended as a
joke or to display program credits.  One well-known    early Easter egg
found in a couple of OSes caused them to respond    to the command
`make love' with `not war?'.  Many    personal computers have much more
elaborate eggs hidden in ROM,    including lists of the developers'
names, political exhortations,    snatches of music, and (in one case)
graphics images of the entire    development team.

   :Easter egging: n.  [IBM] The act of replacing unrelated
components more or less at random in hopes that a malfunction will
go away.  Hackers consider this the normal operating mode of    {field
circus} techs and do not love them for it.  See also the    jokes under
{field circus}.  Compare {shotgun debugging}.

   :eat flaming death: imp.  A construction popularized among
hackers by the infamous {CPU Wars} comic; supposedly derive from    a
famously turgid line in a WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic    that
ran "Eat flaming death, non-Aryan mongrels!" or something    of the
sort (however, it is also reported that the Firesign    Theatre's 1975
album "In The Next World, You're On Your Own"    a character won the
right to scream "Eat flaming death, fascist    media pigs" in the
middle of Oscar night on a game show; this may    have been an
influence).  Used in humorously overblown expressions    of hostility.
"Eat flaming death, {{EBCDIC}} users!"

   :EBCDIC:: /eb's*-dik/, /eb'see`dik/, or /eb'k*-dik/ n.
[abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An
alleged character set used on IBM {dinosaur}s.  It exists in at
least six mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such
delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of
several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern
computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies
according to which version of EBCDIC you're looking at).  IBM
adapted EBCDIC from {{punched card}} code in the early 1960s and
promulgated it as a customer-control tactic (see {connector
conspiracy}), spurning the already established ASCII standard.
Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own
description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them
is still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading.
Hackers blanch at the very _name_ of EBCDIC and consider it a
manifestation of purest {evil}.  See also {fear and    loathing}.

   :echo: [FidoNet] n.  A {topic group} on {FidoNet}'s    echomail
system.  Compare {newsgroup}.

   :ECP: /E-C-P/ n.  See {spam} and {velveeta}.

   :egosurf: vi.  To search the net for your name or links    to your
web pages.  Perhaps connected to long-established SF-fan    slang
`egoscan', to search for one's name in a fanzine.

   :eighty-column mind: n.  [IBM] The sort said to be possessed by
persons for whom the transition from {punched card} to tape was
traumatic (nobody has dared tell them about disks yet).  It is said
that these people, including (according to an old joke) the founder
of IBM, will be buried `face down, 9-edge first' (the 9-edge being
the bottom of the card).  This directive is inscribed on IBM's 1402
and 1622 card readers and is referenced in a famous bit of doggerel
called "The Last Bug", the climactic lines of which are as    follows:

        He died at the console
        Of hunger and thirst.
        Next day he was buried,
        Face down, 9-edge first.

The eighty-column mind was thought by most hackers to dominate    IBM's
customer base and its thinking.  This only began to change in the
mid-1990s when IBM began to reinvent itself after the triumph of    the
{killer micro}.  See {IBM}, {fear and loathing},    {card walloper}.

   :El Camino Bignum: /el' k*-mee'noh big'nuhm/ n.  The road
mundanely called El Camino Real, running along San Francisco
peninsula.  It originally extended all the way down to Mexico City;
many portions of the old road are still intact.  Navigation on the
San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real,
which defines {logical} north and south even though it isn't    really
north-south in many places.  El Camino Real runs right past    Stanford
University and so is familiar to hackers.

   The Spanish word `real' (which has two syllables: /ray-ahl'/)
means `royal'; El Camino Real is `the royal road'.  In the FORTRAN
language, a `real' quantity is a number typically precise to seven
significant digits, and a `double precision' quantity is a larger
floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant
digits (other languages have similar `real' types).

   When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a
 long road El Camino Real was.  Making a pun on `real', he started
calling it `El Camino Double Precision' -- but when the hacker    was
told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it    `El
Camino Bignum', and that name has stuck.  (See {bignum}.)

   [GLS has since let slip that the unnamed hacker in this story was
in fact himself --ESR]

   In recent years, the synonym `El Camino Virtual' has been
reported as an alternate at IBM and Amdahl sites in the Valley.
Mathematically literate hackers in the Valley have also been heard
to refer to some major cross-street intersecting El Camino Real as
"El Camino Imaginary".  One popular theory is that the    intersection
is located near Moffett Field - where they keep all    those complex
planes.

   :elder days: n.  The heroic age of hackerdom (roughly,    pre-1980);
the era of the {PDP-10}, {TECO}, {{ITS}}, and the    ARPANET.  This
term has been rather consciously adopted from    J. R. R. Tolkien's
fantasy epic "The Lord of the Rings".     Compare {Iron Age}; see also
{elvish} and {Great Worm}.

   :elegant: adj.  [common; from mathematical usage]    Combining
simplicity, power, and a certain ineffable grace of    design.  Higher
praise than `clever', `winning', or even    {cuspy}.

   The French aviator, adventurer, and author Antoine de
Saint-Exupe'ry, probably best known for his classic children's    book
"The Little Prince", was also an aircraft designer.  He    gave us
perhaps the best definition of engineering elegance when he    said "A
designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there    is nothing
left to add, but when there is nothing left to take    away."

   :elephantine: adj.  Used of programs or systems that are both
conspicuous {hog}s (owing perhaps to poor design founded on    {brute
force and ignorance}) and exceedingly {hairy} in    source form.  An
elephantine program may be functional and even    friendly, but (as in
the old joke about being in bed with an    elephant) it's tough to have
around all the same (and, like a    pachyderm, difficult to maintain).
In extreme cases, hackers have    been known to make trumpeting sounds
or perform expressive    proboscatory mime at the mention of the
offending program.  Usage:    semi-humorous.  Compare `has the elephant
nature' and the    somewhat more pejorative {monstrosity}.  See also
{second-system effect} and {baroque}.

   :elevator controller: n.  An archetypal dumb embedded-systems
application, like {toaster} (which superseded it).  During one
period (1983-84) in the deliberations of ANSI X3J11 (the C
standardization committee) this was the canonical example of a
really stupid, memory-limited computation environment.  "You can't
require `printf(3)' to be part of the default runtime library    --
what if you're targeting an elevator controller?"  Elevator
controllers became important rhetorical weapons on both sides of
several {holy wars}.

   :elite: adj.  Clueful.  Plugged-in.  One of the    cognoscenti.
Also used as a general positive adjective.  This term    is not
actually hacker slang in the strict sense; it is used    primarily by
crackers and {warez d00dz}, for which reason    hackers use it only
with heavy irony.  The term used to    refer to the folks allowed in to
the "hidden" or "privileged"    sections of BBSes in the early 1980s
(which, typically, contained    pirated software). Frequently, early
boards would only let you    post, or even see, a certain subset of the
sections (or `boards')    on a BBS. Those who got to the frequently
legendary `triple super    secret' boards were elite. Misspellings of
this term in warez d00dz    style abound; the forms `eleet', and
`31337' (among others)    have been sighted.

   A true hacker would be more likely to use `wizardly'. Oppose
{lamer}.

   :ELIZA effect: /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ n.  [AI community] The    tendency
of humans to attach associations to terms from prior    experience.
For example, there is nothing magic about the symbol    `+' that makes
it well-suited to indicate addition; it's just    that people associate
it with addition.  Using `+' or `plus'    to mean addition in a
computer language is taking advantage of the    ELIZA effect.

   This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,
 which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by rephrasing many of
the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the
patient.  It worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution
of key words into canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however,
that there are many anecdotes about people becoming very    emotionally
caught up in dealing with ELIZA.  All this was due to    people's
tendency to attach to words meanings which the computer    never put
there.  The ELIZA effect is a {Good Thing} when    writing a
programming language, but it can blind you to serious    shortcomings
when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system.     Compare
{ad-hockery}; see also {AI-complete}.     Sources for a clone of the
original Eliza are available at
`ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/pub/AI_ATTIC/Programs/Classic/Eliza/Eliza.c'.

   :elvish: n.  1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms
resembling the beautiful Celtic half-uncial hand of the "Book    of
Kells".  Invented and described by J. R. R. Tolkien in "The    Lord of
The Rings" as an orthography for his fictional `elvish'    languages,
this system (which is both visually and phonetically    {elegant}) has
long fascinated hackers (who tend to be intrigued    by artificial
languages in general).  It is traditional for    graphics printers,
plotters, window systems, and the like to    support a Feanorian
typeface as one of their demo items.  See also    {elder days}.  2. By
extension, any odd or unreadable typeface    produced by a graphics
device.  3. The typeface mundanely called    `Bo"cklin', an art-Noveau
display font.

   :EMACS: /ee'maks/ n.  [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus    ultra of
hacker editors, a programmable text editor with an entire    LISP
system inside it.  It was originally written by Richard    Stallman in
{TECO} under {{ITS}} at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554    described it as
"an advanced, self-documenting, customizable,    extensible real-time
display editor".  It has since been    reimplemented any number of
times, by various hackers, and versions    exist that run under most
major operating systems.  Perhaps the    most widely used version, also
written by Stallman and now called    "{GNU} EMACS" or {GNUMACS}, runs
principally under Unix.     (Its close relative XEmacs is the second
most popular version.)  It    includes facilities to run compilation
subprocesses and send and    receive mail or news; many hackers spend
up to 80% of their    {tube time} inside it.  Other variants include
{GOSMACS}, CCA    EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS, jove,
epsilon, and    MicroEMACS.  (Though we use the original all-caps
spelling here, it    is nowadays very commonly `Emacs'.)

   Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an
overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the
editor does not (yet) include.  Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too
{heavyweight} and {baroque} for their taste, and expand the    name as
`Escape Meta Alt Control Shift' to spoof its heavy reliance    on
keystrokes decorated with {bucky bits}.  Other spoof    expansions
include `Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping' (from    when that
was a lot of {core}), `Eventually `malloc()'s All    Computer Storage',
and `EMACS Makes A Computer Slow' (see    {{recursive acronym}}).  See
also {vi}.

   :email: /ee'mayl/  (also written `e-mail' and `E-mail')    1. n.
Electronic mail automatically passed through computer    networks
and/or via modems over common-carrier lines.  Contrast    {snail-mail},
{paper-net}, {voice-net}.  See {network    address}.  2. vt. To send
electronic mail.

   Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED;
it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a
net or open work".  A use from 1480 is given. The word is probably
derived from French `e'maille'' (enameled) and related to Old    French
`emmailleu"re' (network).  A French correspondent tells    us that in
modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by    heating special
paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is    a craftsman who
makes email (he generally paints some objects    (like, say, jewelry)
and cooks them in a furnace).

   There are numerous spelling variants of this word.  In Internet
traffic up to 1995, `email' predominates, `e-mail' runs a
not-too-distant second, and `E-mail' and `Email' are a distant    third
and fourth.

   :emoticon: /ee-moh'ti-kon/ n.  [common] An ASCII glyph    used to
indicate an emotional state in email or news.  Although    originally
intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some other    explicit humor
indication) are virtually required under certain    circumstances in
high-volume text-only communication forums such as    Usenet; the lack
of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what    were intended to
be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise    non-100%-serious
comments to be badly misinterpreted (not always    even by {newbie}s),
resulting in arguments and {flame war}s.

   Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed, but only a few are in
common use.  These include:

    :-)
          `smiley face' (for humor, laughter, friendliness,
          occasionally sarcasm)

    :-(
          `frowney face' (for sadness, anger, or upset)

    ;-)
          `half-smiley' ({ha ha only serious}); also known as
          `semi-smiley' or `winkey face'.

    :-/
          `wry face'

(These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head
sideways, to the left.)

   The first two listed are by far the most frequently encountered.
Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX;
see also {bixie}.  On {Usenet}, `smiley' is often used as a    generic
term synonymous with {emoticon}, as well as specifically    for the
happy-face emoticon.

   It appears that the emoticon was invented by one Scott Fahlman on
the CMU {bboard} systems sometime between early 1981 and    mid-1982.
He later wrote: "I wish I had saved the original post,    or at least
recorded the date for posterity, but I had no idea that    I was
starting something that would soon pollute all the world's
communication channels."  [GLS confirms that he remembers this
original posting].

   Note for the {newbie}: Overuse of the smiley is a mark of
loserhood!  More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign that
you've gone over the line.

   :EMP: /E-M-P/  See {spam}.

   :empire: n.  Any of a family of military simulations derived    from
a game written by Peter Langston many years ago.  A number of
multi-player variants of varying degrees of sophistication exist,
and one single-player version implemented for both Unix and VMS;    the
latter is even available as MS-DOS freeware.  All are    notoriously
addictive.  Of various commercial derivatives the    best known is
probably "Empire Deluxe" on PCs and Amigas.

   Modern empire is a real-time wargame played over the internet    by
up to 120 players. Typical games last from 24 hours (blitz) to    a
couple of months (long term).  The amount of sleep you can get    while
playing is a function of the rate at which updates occur and    the
number of co-rulers of your country.  Empire server software is
available for unix-like machines, and clients for Unix and other
platforms.  A comprehensive history of the game is available at
`http://empire.idlpaper.com/infopages/History.html'.  The    Empire
resource site is at `http://empire.idlpaper.com/'.

   :engine: n.  1. A piece of hardware that encapsulates some
function but can't be used without some kind of {front end}.     Today
we have, especially, `print engine': the guts of a laser    printer.
2. An analogous piece of software; notionally, one that    does a lot
of noisy crunching, such as a `database engine'.

   The hacker senses of `engine' are actually close to its original,
pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill, clever device, or
instrument (the word is cognate to `ingenuity').  This sense had    not
been completely eclipsed by the modern connotation of
power-transducing machinery in Charles Babbage's time, which
explains why he named the stored-program computer that    he designed
in 1844 the `Analytical Engine'.

   :English:  1. n. obs. The source code for a program, which may    be
in any language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary
produced from it by a compiler.  The idea behind the term is that    to
a real hacker, a program written in his favorite programming
language is at least as readable as English.  Usage: mostly by
old-time hackers, though recognizable in context.  2. The official
name of the database language used by the Pick Operating System,
actually a sort of crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions of
grandeur.  The name permits {marketroid}s to say "Yes, and you    can
program our computers in English!" to ignorant {suit}s    without quite
running afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws.

   :enhancement: n.  Common {marketroid}-speak for a bug    {fix}.
This abuse of language is a popular and time-tested way    to turn
incompetence into increased revenue.  A hacker being ironic    would
instead call the fix a {feature} -- or perhaps save some    effort by
declaring the bug itself to be a feature.

   :ENQ: /enkw/ or /enk/  [from the ASCII mnemonic ENQuire    for
0000101] An on-line convention for querying someone's    availability.
After opening a {talk mode} connection to someone    apparently in
heavy hack mode, one might type `SYN SYN ENQ?'    (the SYNs
representing notional synchronization bytes), and expect    a return of
{ACK} or {NAK} depending on whether or not the    person felt
interruptible.  Compare {ping}, {finger}, and the    usage of `FOO?'
listed under {talk mode}.

   :EOF: /E-O-F/ n.  [abbreviation, `End Of File']    1. [techspeak]
The {out-of-band} value returned by C's    sequential character-input
functions (and their equivalents in    other environments) when end of
file has been reached.  This value    is usually -1 under C libraries
postdating V6 Unix, but was    originally 0.  DOS hackers think EOF is
^Z, and a few Amiga hackers    think it's ^\.  2. [Unix] The keyboard
character (usually control-D,    the ASCII EOT (End Of Transmission)
character) that is mapped by    the terminal driver into an end-of-file
condition.  3. Used by    extension in non-computer contexts when a
human is doing something    that can be modeled as a sequential read
and can't go further.     "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics
to post as a joke, but    I hit EOF pretty fast; all the library had
was a {JCL} manual."     See also {EOL}.

   :EOL: /E-O-L/ n.  [End Of Line] Syn. for {newline},    derived
perhaps from the original CDC6600 Pascal.  Now rare, but    widely
recognized and occasionally used for brevity.  Used in the    example
entry under {BNF}.  See also {EOF}.

   :EOU: /E-O-U/ n.  The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control
character (End Of User) that would make an ASR-33 Teletype explode
on receipt.  This construction parodies the numerous obscure
delimiter and control characters left in ASCII from the days when    it
was associated more with wire-service teletypes than computers
(e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX, and esp. EOT).  It is worth
remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a
lot of clattering parts; the notion that one might explode was
nowhere near as ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in
front of a {tube} or flatscreen today.

   :epoch: n.  [Unix: prob. from astronomical timekeeping] The    time
and date corresponding to 0 in an operating system's clock and
timestamp values.  Under most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00
GMT, January 1, 1970; under VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858
(base date of the U.S. Naval Observatory's ephemerides); on a
Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning January 1 1904.  System time
is measured in seconds or {tick}s past the epoch.  Weird    problems
may ensue when the clock wraps around (see {wrap    around}), which is
not necessarily a rare event; on systems    counting 10 ticks per
second, a signed 32-bit count of ticks is    good only for 6.8 years.
The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is    good only until January 18,
2038, assuming at least some software    continues to consider it
signed and that word lengths don't    increase by then.  See also {wall
time}.  Microsoft Windows, on    the other hand, has an epoch problem
every 49.7 days - but this    is seldom noticed as Windows is almost
incapable of staying    up continuously for that long.

   :epsilon:  [see {delta}] 1. n. A small quantity of    anything.
"The cost is epsilon."  2. adj. Very small,    negligible; less than
{marginal}.  "We can get this feature for    epsilon cost."  3. `within
epsilon of': close enough to be    indistinguishable for all practical
purposes, even closer than    being `within delta of'.  "That's not
what I asked for, but it's    within epsilon of what I wanted."
Alternatively, it may mean not    close enough, but very little is
required to get it there: "My    program is within epsilon of working."

   :epsilon squared: n.  A quantity even smaller than    {epsilon}, as
small in comparison to epsilon as epsilon is to    something normal;
completely negligible.  If you buy a    supercomputer for a million
dollars, the cost of the    thousand-dollar terminal to go with it is
{epsilon}, and the    cost of the ten-dollar cable to connect them is
epsilon squared.     Compare {lost in the underflow}, {lost in the
noise}.

   :era: n.  Syn. {epoch}.  Webster's Unabridged makes these    words
almost synonymous, but `era' more often connotes a span of    time
rather than a point in time, whereas the reverse is true for
{epoch}.  The {epoch} usage is recommended.

   :Eric Conspiracy: n.  A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers
named Eric first pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous
talk.bizarre posting ca. 1987; this was doubtless influenced    by the
numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty Python oeuvre.  There    do indeed
seem to be considerably more mustachioed Erics in    hackerdom than the
frequency of these three traits can account for    unless they are
correlated in some arcane way.  Well-known examples    include Eric
Allman (he of the `Allman style' described under    {indent style}) and
Erik Fair (co-author of NNTP); your editor    has heard from more than
sixty others by email, and the organization    line `Eric Conspiracy
Secret Laboratories' now emanates regularly    from more than one site.
See the Eric Conspiracy Web Page at
`http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ecsl/' for full details.

   :Eris: /e'ris/ n.  The Greek goddess of Chaos, Discord,
Confusion, and Things You Know Not Of; her name was latinized to
Discordia and she was worshiped by that name in Rome.  Not a very
friendly deity in the Classical original, she was reinvented as a
more benign personification of creative anarchy starting in 1959 by
the adherents of {Discordianism} and has since been a    semi-serious
subject of veneration in several `fringe' cultures,    including
hackerdom.  See {Discordianism}, {Church of the    SubGenius}.

   :erotics: /ee-ro'tiks/ n.  [Helsinki University of    Technology,
Finland] n. English-language university slang for    electronics.
Often used by hackers in Helsinki, maybe because good    electronics
excites them and makes them warm.

   :error 33: [XEROX PARC] n.  1. Predicating one research effort
upon the success of another.  2. Allowing your own research effort
to be placed on the critical path of some other project (be it a
research effort or not).

   :eurodemo: /yoor'o-dem`-o/  a {demo}, sense 4

   :evil: adj.  As used by hackers, implies that some system,
program, person, or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to    be
not worth the bother of dealing with.  Unlike the adjectives in    the
{cretinous}/{losing}/{brain-damaged} series, `evil'    does not imply
incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of    goals or design
criteria fatally incompatible with the speaker's.     This usage is
more an esthetic and engineering judgment than a    moral one in the
mainstream sense.  "We thought about adding a    {Blue Glue} interface
but decided it was too evil to deal    with."  "{TECO} is neat, but it
can be pretty evil if you're    prone to typos."  Often pronounced with
the first syllable    lengthened, as /eeee'vil/.  Compare {evil and
rude}.

   :evil and rude: adj.  Both {evil} and {rude}, but with    the
additional connotation that the rudeness was due to malice    rather
than incompetence.  Thus, for example: Microsoft's Windows    NT is
evil because it's a competent implementation of a bad    design; it's
rude because it's gratuitously incompatible with    Unix in places
where compatibility would have been as easy and    effective to do; but
it's evil and rude because the    incompatibilities are apparently
there not to fix design bugs in    Unix but rather to lock hapless
customers and developers into the    Microsoft way.  Hackish evil and
rude is close to the    mainstream sense of `evil'.

   :Evil Empire: n.  [from Ronald Reagan's famous    characterization
of the communist Soviet Union] Formerly {IBM},    now Microsoft.
Functionally, the company most hackers love to hate    at any given
time.  Hackers like to see themselves as romantic    rebels against the
Evil Empire, and frequently adopt this role    to the point of
ascribing rather more power and malice to the    Empire than it
actually has.  See also {Borg} and search for    Evil Empire
(http://pages.prodigy.net/rkusnery/amsind.html)    pages on the Web.

   :exa-: /ek's*/ pref.  [SI] See {{quantifiers}}.

   :examining the entrails: n.  The process of {grovel}ling    through
a {core dump} or hex image in an attempt to discover the    bug that
brought a program or system down.  The reference is to    divination
from the entrails of a sacrified animal.  Compare    {runes},
{incantation}, {black art}, {desk check}.

   :EXCH: /eks'ch*/ or /eksch/ vt.  To exchange two things,    each for
the other; to swap places.  If you point to two people    sitting down
and say "Exch!", you are asking them to trade    places.  EXCH, meaning
EXCHange, was originally the name of a    PDP-10 instruction that
exchanged the contents of a register and a    memory location.  Many
newer hackers are probably thinking instead    of the {{PostScript}}
exchange operator (which is usually written    in lowercase).

   :excl: /eks'kl/ n.  Abbreviation for `exclamation point'.     See
{bang}, {shriek}, {{ASCII}}.

   :EXE: /eks'ee/ or /eek'see/ or /E-X-E/ n.  An executable    binary
file.  Some operating systems (notably MS-DOS, VMS, and    TWENEX) use
the extension .EXE to mark such files.  This usage is    also
occasionally found among Unix programmers even though Unix
executables don't have any required suffix.

   :exec: /eg-zek'/ or /eks'ek/ vt., n.  1. [Unix: from    `execute']
Synonym for {chain}, derives from the    `exec(2)' call.  2. [from
`executive'] obs. The command    interpreter for an {OS} (see {shell});
term esp. used    around mainframes, and prob. derived from UNIVAC's
archaic EXEC 2    and EXEC 8 operating systems.  3. At IBM and VM/CMS
shops, the    equivalent of a shell command file (among VM/CMS users).

   The mainstream `exec' as an abbreviation for (human) executive is
_not_ used.  To a hacker, an `exec' is a always a program,    never a
person.

   :exercise, left as an: adj.  [from technical books] Used to
complete a proof when one doesn't mind a {handwave}, or to avoid    one
entirely.  The complete phrase is: "The proof [or `the rest']    is
left as an exercise for the reader."  This comment _has_
occasionally been attached to unsolved research problems by authors
possessed of either an evil sense of humor or a vast faith in the
capabilities of their audiences.

   :Exon: /eks'on/ excl.  A generic obscenity that quickly    entered
wide use on the Internet and Usenet after {Black    Thursday}. From the
last name of Senator James Exon    (Democrat-Nebraska), primary author
of the {CDA}.

   :Exploder: n.  Used within Microsoft to refer to the    Windows
Explorer, the interface component of Windows 95 and WinNT    4. Our
spies report that most of the heavy guns at MS came from a    Unix
background and use command line utilities; even they are    scornful of
the over-gingerbreaded {WIMP environment}s that they    have been
called upon to create.

   :exploit: n.  [originally cracker slang] 1. A vulnerability    in
software that can be used for breaking security or otherwise
attacking an Internet host over the network.  The {Ping O'    Death} is
a famous exploit. 2. More grammatically, a program that    exploits an
exploit in sense 1,

   :external memory: n.  A memo pad, palmtop computer, or written
notes.  "Hold on while I write that to external memory".  The
analogy is with store or DRAM versus nonvolatile disk storage on
computers.

   :eye candy:  /i:' kand`ee/ n.  [from mainstream slang    "ear
candy"] A display of some sort that's presented to {luser}s    to keep
them distracted while the program performs necessary    background
tasks.  "Give 'em some eye candy while the back-end    {slurp}s that
{BLOB} into core." Reported as mainstream    usage among players of
graphics-heavy computer games.

   :eyeball search: n.,v.  To look for something in a mass of    code
or data with one's own native optical sensors, as opposed to    using
some sort of pattern matching software like {grep} or any    other
automated search tool.  Also called a {vgrep}; compare    {vdiff},
{desk check}.

= F =
=====

   :face time: n.  [common] Time spent interacting with somebody
face-to-face (as opposed to via electronic links).  "Oh, yeah, I
spent some face time with him at the last Usenix."

   :factor: n.  See {coefficient of X}.

   :fall over: vi.  [IBM] Yet another synonym for {crash} or    {lose}.
`Fall over hard' equates to {crash and burn}.

   :fall through: v.  (n. `fallthrough', var.     `fall-through') 1. To
exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by having    fulfilled its exit
condition rather than via a break or exception    condition that exits
from the middle of it.  This usage appears to    be _really_ old,
dating from the 1940s and 1950s.  2. To fail    a test that would have
passed control to a subroutine or some other    distant portion of
code.  3. In C, `fall-through' occurs when the    flow of execution in
a switch statement reaches a `case' label    other than by jumping
there from the switch header, passing a point    where one would
normally expect to find a `break'.  A trivial    example:

     switch (color)
     {
     case GREEN:
        do_green();
        break;
     case PINK:
        do_pink();
        /* FALL THROUGH */
     case RED:
        do_red();
        break;
     default:
        do_blue();
        break;
     }

The variant spelling `/* FALL THRU */' is also common.

   The effect of the above code is to `do_green()' when color is
`GREEN', `do_red()' when color is `RED',    `do_blue()' on any other
color other than `PINK', and    (and this is the important part)
`do_pink()' _and then_    `do_red()' when color is `PINK'.
Fall-through is    {considered harmful} by some, though there are
contexts (such as    the coding of state machines) in which it is
natural; it is    generally considered good practice to include a
comment    highlighting the fall-through where one would normally
expect a    break.  See also {Duff's device}.

   :fan: n.  Without qualification, indicates a fan of science
fiction, especially one who goes to {con}s and tends to hang out
with other fans.  Many hackers are fans, so this term has been
imported from fannish slang; however, unlike much fannish slang it
is recognized by most non-fannish hackers.  Among SF fans the    plural
is correctly `fen', but this usage is not automatic to    hackers.
"Laura reads the stuff occasionally but isn't really a    fan."

   :fandango on core: n.  [Unix/C hackers, from the Iberian    dance]
In C, a wild pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a    {core dump},
or corrupts the `malloc(3)' {arena} in such    a way as to cause
mysterious failures later on, is sometimes said    to have `done a
fandango on core'.  On low-end personal machines    without an MMU,
this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive    lossage.  Other
frenetic dances such as the rhumba, cha-cha, or    watusi, may be
substituted.  See {aliasing bug}, {precedence    lossage}, {smash the
stack}, {memory leak}, {memory    smash}, {overrun screw}, {core}.

   :FAQ: /F-A-Q/ or /fak/ n.  [Usenet] 1. A Frequently Asked
Question.  2. A compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically
to high-volume newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such    questions.
Some people prefer the term `FAQ list' or `FAQL'    /fa'kl/, reserving
`FAQ' for sense 1.

   This lexicon itself serves as a good example of a collection of one
 kind of lore, although it is far too big for a regular FAQ
posting.  Examples: "What is the proper type of NULL?"  and    "What's
that funny name for the `#' character?" are both    Frequently Asked
Questions.  Several FAQs refer readers to    this file.

   :FAQ list: /F-A-Q list/ or /fak list/ n.  [common;    Usenet] Syn
{FAQ}, sense 2.

   :FAQL: /fa'kl/ n.  Syn. {FAQ list}.

   :faradize: /far'*-di:z/ v.  [US Geological Survey] To start any
hyper-addictive process or trend, or to continue adding current to
such a trend.  Telling one user about a new octo-tetris game you
compiled would be a faradizing act -- in two weeks you might find
your entire department playing the faradic game.

   :farkled: /far'kld/ adj.  [DeVry Institute of Technology,
Atlanta] Syn. {hosed}.  Poss. owes something to Yiddish
`farblondjet' and/or the `Farkle Family' skits on "Rowan    and
Martin's Laugh-In", a popular comedy show of the late 1960s.

   :farming: n.  [Adelaide University, Australia] What the heads    of
a disk drive are said to do when they plow little furrows in the
magnetic media.  Associated with a {crash}.  Typically used as
follows: "Oh no, the machine has just crashed; I hope the hard    drive
hasn't gone {farming} again." No longer common; modern    drives
automatically park their heads in a safe zone on    power-down, so it
takes a real mechanical problem to induce this.

   :fascist: adj.  1. [common] Said of a computer system with
excessive or annoying security barriers, usage limits, or access
policies.  The implication is that said policies are preventing
hackers from getting interesting work done.  The variant    `fascistic'
seems to have been preferred at MIT, poss. by analogy    with
`touristic' (see {tourist} or under the influence of    German/Yiddish
`faschistisch').  2. In the design of languages    and other software
tools, `the fascist alternative' is the most    restrictive and
structured way of capturing a particular function;    the implication
is that this may be desirable in order to simplify    the
implementation or provide tighter error checking.  Compare
{bondage-and-discipline language}, although that term is global
rather than local.

   :fat electrons: n.  Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on    the
causation of computer glitches.  Your typical electric utility    draws
its line current out of the big generators with a pair of    coil taps
located near the top of the dynamo.  When the normal tap    brushes get
dirty, they take them off line to clean them up, and    use special
auxiliary taps on the _bottom_ of the coil.  Now,    this is a problem,
because when they do that they get not ordinary    or `thin' electrons,
but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are    heavier and so settle to the
bottom of the generator.  These flow    down ordinary wires just fine,
but when they have to turn a sharp    corner (as in an
integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck.     This is what
causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.  Obviously,    fat electrons
must gain mass by {bogon} absorption --ESR]    Compare {bogon}, {magic
smoke}.

   :faulty: adj.  Non-functional; buggy.  Same denotation as
{bletcherous}, {losing}, q.v., but the connotation is much    milder.

   :fd leak: /F-D leek/ n.  A kind of programming bug analogous    to a
{core leak}, in which a program fails to close file    descriptors
(`fd's) after file operations are completed, and    thus eventually
runs out of them.  See {leak}.

   :fear and loathing: n.  [from Hunter S. Thompson] A state
inspired by the prospect of dealing with certain real-world systems
and standards that are totally {brain-damaged} but ubiquitous    --
Intel 8086s, or {COBOL}, or {{EBCDIC}}, or any {IBM}    machine bigger
than a workstation.  "Ack!  They want PCs to be    able to talk to the
AI machine.  Fear and loathing time!"

   :feature: n.  1. [common] A good property or behavior (as    of a
program).  Whether it was intended or not is immaterial.     2.
[common] An intended property or behavior (as of a program).
Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
{misfeature}).  3. A surprising property or behavior; in    particular,
one that is purposely inconsistent because it works    better that way
-- such an inconsistency is therefore a    {feature} and not a {bug}.
This kind of feature is sometimes    called a {miswart}; see that entry
for a classic example.  4. A    property or behavior that is gratuitous
or unnecessary, though    perhaps also impressive or cute.  For
example, one feature of    Common LISP's `format' function is the
ability to print    numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see
{bells    whistles and gongs}).  5. A property or behavior that was put
in to    help someone else but that happens to be in your way.  6.
[common]    A bug that has been documented.  To call something a feature
  sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the
particular case, and that the program responded in a way that was
unexpected but not strictly incorrect.  A standard joke is that a
bug can be turned into a {feature} simply by documenting it    (then
theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in    the
manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good.  "That's    not a
bug, that's a feature!" is a common catchphrase.  See also    {feetch
feetch}, {creeping featurism}, {wart}, {green    lightning}.

   The relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and
miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange
between two hackers on an airliner:

   A: "This seat doesn't recline."

   B: "That's not a bug, that's a feature.  There is an emergency
exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to
be kept clear."

   A: "Oh.  Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the
spacing between rows here."

   B: "Yes.  But if they'd increased spacing in only one section it
would have been a wart -- they would've had to make
nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced    seats."

   A: "A miswart, actually.  If they increased spacing throughout
they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin.  So
unequal spacing would actually be the Right Thing."

   B: "Indeed."

   `Undocumented feature' is a common, allegedly humorous euphemism
for a {bug}.  There's a related joke that is sometimes referred    to
as the "one-question geek test".  You say to someone "I saw a
Volkswagen Beetle today with a vanity license plate that read
FEATURE".  If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see {computer    geek},
sense 2).

   :feature creature: n.  [poss. fr. slang `creature feature'    for a
horror movie] 1. One who loves to add features to designs or
programs, perhaps at the expense of coherence, concision, or
{taste}.  2. Alternately, a mythical being that induces    otherwise
rational programmers to perpetrate such crocks.  See also    {feeping
creaturism}, {creeping featurism}.

   :feature creep: n.  [common] The result of {creeping    featurism},
as in "Emacs has a bad case of feature    creep".

   :feature key: n.  [common] The Macintosh key with the    cloverleaf
graphic on its keytop; sometimes referred to as    `flower', `pretzel',
`clover', `propeller', `beanie' (an    apparent reference to the major
feature of a propeller beanie),    {splat}, or the `command key'.  The
proliferation of terms for    this creature may illustrate one subtle
peril of iconic    interfaces.

   Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is `cross of St.
Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to
mark sites of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from
an early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple
documentation gives the translation "interesting feature"!

   There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this
symbol.  It technically stands for the word `seva"rdhet'
(interesting feature); many of these are old churches. Some Swedes
report as an idiom for it the word `kyrka', cognate to English
`church' and Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in    modern
Swedish.  Others say this is nonsense.  Another idiom    reported for
the sign is `runsten' /roon'stn/, derived from    the fact that many of
the interesting features are Viking    rune-stones.

   :feature shock: n.  [from Alvin Toffler's book title    "Future
Shock"] A user's (or programmer's!) confusion when    confronted with a
package that has too many features and poor    introductory material.

   :featurectomy: /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ n.  The act of removing    a
feature from a program.  Featurectomies come in two flavors, the
`righteous' and the `reluctant'.  Righteous featurectomies are
performed because the remover believes the program would be more
elegant without the feature, or there is already an equivalent and
better way to achieve the same end.  (Doing so is not quite the    same
thing as removing a {misfeature}.)  Reluctant    featurectomies are
performed to satisfy some external constraint    such as code size or
execution speed.

   :feep: /feep/  1. n. The soft electronic `bell' sound of a
display terminal (except for a VT-52); a beep (in fact, the
microcomputer world seems to prefer {beep}).  2. vi. To cause    the
display to make a feep sound.  ASR-33s (the original TTYs) do    not
feep; they have mechanical bells that ring.  Alternate forms:
{beep}, `bleep', or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic.
(Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip "Shoe", uses the word    `eep' for
sounds made by computer terminals and video games; this    is perhaps
the closest written approximation yet.)  The term    `breedle' was
sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal    bleepers are not
particularly soft (they sound more like the    musical equivalent of a
raspberry or Bronx cheer; for a close    approximation, imagine the
sound of a Star Trek communicator's beep    lasting for five seconds).
The `feeper' on a VT-52 has been    compared to the sound of a '52
Chevy stripping its gears.  See also    {ding}.

   :feeper: /fee'pr/ n.  The device in a terminal or    workstation
(usually a loudspeaker of some kind) that makes the    {feep} sound.

   :feeping creature: n.  [from {feeping creaturism}] An    unnecessary
feature; a bit of {chrome} that, in the speaker's    judgment, is the
camel's nose for a whole horde of new features.

   :feeping creaturism: /fee'ping kree`ch*r-izm/ n.  A    deliberate
spoonerism for {creeping featurism}, meant to imply    that the system
or program in question has become a misshapen    creature of hacks.
This term isn't really well defined, but it    sounds so neat that most
hackers have said or heard it.  It is    probably reinforced by an
image of terminals prowling about in the    dark making their customary
noises.

   :feetch feetch: /feech feech/ interj.  If someone tells you    about
some new improvement to a program, you might respond:    "Feetch,
feetch!"  The meaning of this depends critically on    vocal
inflection.  With enthusiasm, it means something like "Boy,    that's
great!  What a great hack!"  Grudgingly or with obvious    doubt, it
means "I don't know; it sounds like just one more    unnecessary and
complicated thing".  With a tone of resignation,    it means, "Well,
I'd rather keep it simple, but I suppose it has    to be done".

   :fence: n. 1.  A sequence of one or more distinguished
({out-of-band}) characters (or other data items), used to    delimit a
piece of data intended to be treated as a unit (the    computer-science
literature calls this a `sentinel').  The NUL    (ASCII 0000000)
character that terminates strings in C is a fence.     Hex FF is also
(though slightly less frequently) used this way.     See {zigamorph}.
2. An extra data value inserted in an array or    other data structure
in order to allow some normal test on the    array's contents also to
function as a termination test.  For    example, a highly optimized
routine for finding a value in an array    might artificially place a
copy of the value to be searched for    after the last slot of the
array, thus allowing the main search    loop to search for the value
without having to check at each pass    whether the end of the array
had been reached.  3. [among users of    optimizing compilers] Any
technique, usually exploiting knowledge    about the compiler, that
blocks certain optimizations.  Used when    explicit mechanisms are not
available or are overkill.  Typically a    hack: "I call a dummy
procedure there to force a flush of the    optimizer's
register-coloring info" can be expressed by the    shorter "That's a
fence procedure".

   :fencepost error: n.  1. [common] A problem with the discrete
equivalent of a boundary condition, often exhibited in programs by
iterative loops.  From the following problem: "If you build a    fence
100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, how many posts do you    need?"
(Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.)     For
example, suppose you have a long list or array of items, and    want to
process items m through n; how many items are    there?  The obvious
answer is n - m, but that is off by one;    the right answer is n - m +
1.  A program that used the    `obvious' formula would have a fencepost
error in it.  See also    {zeroth} and {off-by-one error}, and note
that not all    off-by-one errors are fencepost errors.  The game of
Musical Chairs    involves a catastrophic off-by-one error where N
people try    to sit in N - 1 chairs, but it's not a fencepost error.
 Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces
between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether
one should count one or both ends of a row.  2. [rare] An error
induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can (for
instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree    or
hash table implementation.  (The error here involves the    difference
between expected and worst case behaviors of an    algorithm.)

   :FidoNet: n.  A worldwide hobbyist network of personal    computers
which exchanges mail, discussion groups, and files.     Founded in 1984
and originally consisting only of IBM PCs and    compatibles, FidoNet
now includes such diverse machines as Apple    ][s, Ataris, Amigas, and
Unix systems.  For years FidoNet actually    grew faster than Usenet,
but the advent of cheap Internet access    probably means its days are
numbered.  In early 1999 Fidonet    has approximately 30,000 nodes,
down from 38K in 1996.

   :field circus: n.  [a derogatory pun on `field service'] The
field service organization of any hardware manufacturer, but
originally {DEC}.  There is an entire genre of jokes about field
circus engineers:

     Q: How can you recognize a field circus engineer
        with a flat tire?
     A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat.

     Q: How can you recognize a field circus engineer
        who is out of gas?
     A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is flat.

     Q: How can you tell it's _your_ field circus engineer?
     A: The spare is flat, too.

[See {Easter egging} for additional insight on these jokes.]

   There is also the `Field Circus Cheer' (from the old {plan file} for
  DEC on MIT-AI):

     Maynard! Maynard!
     Don't mess with us!
     We're mean and we're tough!
     If you get us confused
     We'll screw up your stuff.

(DEC's service HQ, still extant under the Compaq regime, is located
in Maynard, Massachusetts.)

   :field servoid: [play on `android'] /fee'ld ser'voyd/ n.
Representative of a field service organization (see {field    circus}).
This has many of the implications of {droid}.

   :Fight-o-net: n.  [FidoNet] Deliberate distortion of {FidoNet},
often applied after a flurry of {flamage} in a particular    {echo},
especially the SYSOP echo or Fidonews (see {'Snooze}).

   :File Attach: [FidoNet]  1. n. A file sent along with a mail
message from one FidoNet to another.  2. vt. Sending someone a file by
 using the File Attach option in a FidoNet mailer.

   :File Request: [FidoNet]  1. n. The {FidoNet} equivalent of
{FTP}, in which one FidoNet system automatically dials another and
{snarf}s one or more files.  Often abbreviated `FReq'; files    are
often announced as being "available for FReq" in the same way    that
files are announced as being "available for/by anonymous    FTP" on the
Internet.  2. vt. The act of getting a copy of a file    by using the
File Request option of the FidoNet mailer.

   :file signature: n.  A {magic number}, sense 3.

   :filk: /filk/ n.,v.  [from SF fandom, where a typo for    `folk' was
adopted as a new word] A popular or folk song with    lyrics revised or
completely new lyrics and/or music, intended for    humorous effect
when read, and/or to be sung late at night at SF    conventions.  There
is a flourishing subgenre of these called    `computer filks', written
by hackers and often containing rather    sophisticated technical
humor.  See {double bucky} for an    example.  Compare {grilf}, {hing},
{pr0n}, and    {newsfroup}.

   :film at 11:  [MIT: in parody of TV newscasters] 1. Used in
conversation to announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic
implication that these events are earth-shattering.  "{{ITS}}
crashes; film at 11."  "Bug found in scheduler; film at 11."     2.
Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional    information
will be available at some future time, _without_    the implication of
anything particularly ordinary about the    referenced event.  For
example, "The mail file server died this    morning; we found garbage
all over the root directory.  Film at    11." would indicate that a
major failure had occurred but that the    people working on it have no
additional information about it as    yet; use of the phrase in this
way suggests gently that the problem    is liable to be fixed more
quickly if the people doing the fixing    can spend time doing the
fixing rather than responding to    questions, the answers to which
will appear on the normal "11:00    news", if people will just be
patient.

   The variant "MPEGs at 11" has recently been cited (MPEG is a
digital-video format.)

   :filter: n.  [very common; orig. {{Unix}}, now also in
{{MS-DOS}}] A program that processes an input data stream into an
output data stream in some well-defined way, and does no I/O to
anywhere else except possibly on error conditions; one designed to
be used as a stage in a `pipeline' (see {plumbing}).  Compare
{sponge}.

   :Finagle's Law: n.  The generalized or `folk' version of
{Murphy's Law}, fully named "Finagle's Law of Dynamic    Negatives" and
usually rendered "Anything that can go wrong,    will".  One variant
favored among hackers is "The perversity of    the Universe tends
towards a maximum" (but see also {Hanlon's    Razor}).  The label
`Finagle's Law' was popularized by SF author    Larry Niven in several
stories depicting a frontier culture of    asteroid miners; this
`Belter' culture professed a religion    and/or running joke involving
the worship of the dread god Finagle    and his mad prophet Murphy.
Some technical and scientific cultures    (e.g., paleontologists) know
it under the name `Sod's Law'; this    usage may be more common in
Great Britain.

   :fine: adj.  [WPI] Good, but not good enough to be {cuspy}.     The
word `fine' is used elsewhere, of course, but without the    implicit
comparison to the higher level implied by {cuspy}.

   :finger:  [WAITS, via BSD Unix] 1. n. A program that displays
information about a particular user or all users logged on the
system, or a remote system.  Typically shows full name, last login
time, idle time, terminal line, and terminal location (where
applicable).  May also display a {plan file} left by the user    (see
also {Hacking X for Y}).  2. vt. To apply finger to a    username.  3.
vt. By extension, to check a human's current state by    any means.
"Foodp?"  "T!"  "OK, finger Lisa and see if she's    idle."  4. Any
picture (composed of ASCII characters) depicting    `the finger'.
Originally a humorous component of one's plan file    to deter the
curious fingerer (sense 2), it has entered the arsenal    of some
{flamer}s.

   :finger trouble: n.  Mistyping, typos, or generalized keyboard
incompetence (this is surprisingly common among hackers, given the
amount of time they spend at keyboards). "I keep putting colons at
the end of statements instead of semicolons", "Finger trouble    again,
eh?".

   :finger-pointing syndrome: n.  All-too-frequent result of    bugs,
esp. in new or experimental configurations.  The hardware    vendor
points a finger at the software.  The software vendor points    a
finger at the hardware.  All the poor users get is the finger.

   :finn: v.  [IRC] To pull rank on somebody based on the amount    of
time one has spent on {IRC}.  The term derives from the fact    that
IRC was originally written in Finland in 1987.  There may be    some
influence from the `Finn' character in William Gibson's    seminal
cyberpunk novel "Count Zero", who at one point says to    another (much
younger) character "I have a pair of shoes older    than you are, so
shut up!"

   :firebottle: n.obs.  A large, primitive, power-hungry active
electrical device, similar in function to a FET but constructed out
of glass, metal, and vacuum.  Characterized by high cost, low
density, low reliability, high-temperature operation, and high    power
dissipation.  Sometimes mistakenly called a `tube' in the    U.S.  or a
`valve' in England; another hackish term is    {glassfet}.

   :firefighting: n.  1. What sysadmins have to do to correct    sudden
operational problems.  An opposite of hacking.  "Been    hacking your
new newsreader?"  "No, a power glitch hosed the    network and I spent
the whole afternoon fighting fires."  2. The    act of throwing lots of
manpower and late nights at a project,    esp. to get it out before
deadline.  See also {gang bang},    {Mongolian Hordes technique};
however, the term `firefighting'    connotes that the effort is going
into chasing bugs rather than    adding features.

   :firehose syndrome: n.  In mainstream folklore it is observed
that trying to drink from a firehose can be a good way to rip your
lips off.  On computer networks, the absence or failure of flow
control mechanisms can lead to situations in which the sending
system sprays a massive flood of packets at an unfortunate    receiving
system, more than it can handle.  Compare {overrun},    {buffer
overflow}.

   :firewall code: n.  1. The code you put in a system (say, a
telephone switch) to make sure that the users can't do any    damage.
Since users always want to be able to do everything but    never want
to suffer for any mistakes, the construction of a    firewall is a
question not only of defensive coding but also of    interface
presentation, so that users don't even get curious about    those
corners of a system where they can burn themselves.     2. Any sanity
check inserted to catch a {can't happen} error.     Wise programmers
often change code to fix a bug twice: once to fix    the bug, and once
to insert a firewall which would have arrested    the bug before it did
quite as much damage.

   :firewall machine: n.  A dedicated gateway machine with    special
security precautions on it, used to service outside network
connections and dial-in lines.  The idea is to protect a cluster of
more loosely administered machines hidden behind it from    {cracker}s.
The typical firewall is an inexpensive micro-based    Unix box kept
clean of critical data, with a bunch of modems and    public network
ports on it but just one carefully watched    connection back to the
rest of the cluster.  The special    precautions may include threat
monitoring, callback, and even a    complete {iron box} keyable to
particular incoming IDs or    activity patterns.  Syn. {flytrap},
{Venus flytrap}.

   [When first coined in the mid-1980s this term was pure jargon. Now
(1999) it is techspeak, and has been retained only as an example of
uptake --ESR]

   :fireworks mode: n.  The mode a machine is sometimes said to    be
in when it is performing a {crash and burn} operation.

   :firmware: /ferm'weir/ n.  Embedded software contained    in EPROM
or flash memory. It isn't quite hardware, but at least    doesn't have
to be loaded from a disk like regular software. Hacker    usage differs
from straight techspeak in that hackers don't    normally apply it to
stuff that you can't possibly get at, such as    the program that runs
a pocket calculator. Instead, it implies that    the firmware could be
changed, even if doing so would mean opening    a box and plugging in a
new chip. A computer's BIOS is the classic    example, although
nowadays there is firmware in disk controllers,    modems, video cards
and even CD-ROM drives.

   :firmy: /fer'mee/ n.  Syn. {stiffy} (a 3.5-inch floppy    disk).

   :fish: n.  [Adelaide University, Australia] 1. Another
{metasyntactic variable}.  See {foo}.  Derived originally    from the
Monty Python skit in the middle of "The Meaning of    Life" entitled
"Find the Fish".  2. A pun for `microfiche'.     A microfiche file
cabinet may be referred to as a `fish tank'.

   :FISH queue: n.  [acronym, by analogy with FIFO (First In,    First
Out)] `First In, Still Here'.  A joking way of pointing out    that
processing of a particular sequence of events or requests has
stopped dead.  Also `FISH mode' and `FISHnet'; the latter may    be
applied to any network that is running really slowly or    exhibiting
extreme flakiness.

   :FITNR: // adj.  [Thinking Machines, Inc.] Fixed In The    Next
Release.  A written-only notation attached to bug reports.     Often
wishful thinking.

   :fix: n.,v.  What one does when a problem has been reported    too
many times to be ignored.

   :FIXME: imp.  [common] A standard tag often put in C    comments
near a piece of code that needs work.  The point of doing    so is that
a `grep' or a similar pattern-matching tool can    find all such places
quickly.

     /* FIXME: note this is common in {GNU} code. */

Compare {XXX}.

   :flag: n.  [very common] A variable or quantity that can    take on
one of two values; a bit, particularly one that is used to    indicate
one of two outcomes or is used to control which of two    things is to
be done.  "This flag controls whether to clear the    screen before
printing the message."  "The program status word    contains several
flag bits."  Used of humans analogously to    {bit}.  See also {hidden
flag}, {mode bit}.

   :flag day: n.  A software change that is neither forward- nor
backward-compatible, and which is costly to make and costly to
reverse.  "Can we install that without causing a flag day for all
users?"  This term has nothing to do with the use of the word    {flag}
to mean a variable that has two values.  It came into use    when a
massive change was made to the {{Multics}} timesharing    system to
convert from the old ASCII code to the new one; this was    scheduled
for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966.  See also    {backward
combatability}.

   :flaky: adj.  (var sp. `flakey') Subject to frequent    {lossage}.
This use is of course related to the common slang    use of the word to
describe a person as eccentric, craz
