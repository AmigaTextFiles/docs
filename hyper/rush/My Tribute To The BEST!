 Polarize me
 Sensitize me
 Criticize me
 Civilize me

 Animate me
 Complicate me
 Elevate me

 Goddess in my garden
 Sister in my soul
 Angel in my armor
 Actress in my role

 Daughter of a demon-lover
 Empress of the hidden face
 Priestess of the pagan mother
 Ancient queen of inner space

 Spirit in my psyche
 Double in my role
 Alter in my image
 Struggle for control

 Mistress of the dark unconscious
 Mermaid of the lunar sea
 Daughter of the great enchantress
 Sister to the boy inside of me

 @{i}My counterpart - my foolish heart
 A man must learn to rule his tender part
 A warming trend - a gentle friend
 A man must build a fortress to defend@{ui}

 A secret face - a touch of grace
 A man must learn to give a little space
 A peaceful state - a submissive trait
 A man must learn to gently dominate

 Natural reflex
 Pendulum swing
 You might be too dizzy
 To do the right thing

 Trial under fire
 Ultimate proof
 Moment of crisis
 Don't swallow the truth

 @{b}@{i}Stick it out@{ub}@{ui}

 Each time we bathe our reactions
 In artificial light
 Each time we alter the focus
 To make the wrong move seem right

 You get so used to deception
 You make yourself a nervous wreck
 You get so used to surrender
 Running back to cover your neck

 It is the fire that lights itself
 But it burns with a restless flame
 The arrow on a moving target
 The archer must be sure of his aim

 It is the engine that drives itself
 But it chooses the uphill climb
 A bearing on magnetic north
 Growing farther away all the time
 Can't stop - moving
 Can't stop - moving
 Can't stop -

 @{i}You may be right
 It's all a waste of time
 I guess that's just a chance I'm prepared to take
 A danger I'm prepared to face
 @{b}Cut to the chase@{ub}@{ui}

 It is the rocket that ignites itself
 And launches its way to the stars
 A driver on a busy freeway
 Racing the oblivious cars

 It's the motor of the western world
 Spinning off to every extreme
 Pure as a lover's desire
 Evil as a murderer's dream

 Young enough not to care too much
 About the way things used to be
 I'm young enough to remember the future -
 The past has no claim on me

 I'm old enough not to care too much
 About what you think of me
 But I'm young enough to remember the future
 And the way things ought to be

 What kind of difference can one person make?

 @{i}I knew he was different, in his sexuality
 I went to his parties, as the straight minority
 It never seemed a threat to my masculinity
 He only introduced me to a wider reality@{ui}

 @{i}As the years went by, we drifted apart
 When I heard that he was gone
 I felt a shadow cross my heart
 But he's nobody's -@{ui}

 Hero - saves a drowning child
 Cures a wasting disease
 Hero - lands the crippled airplane
 Solves great mysteries

 Hero - not the handsome actor
 Who plays a hero's role
 Hero - not the glamor girl
 Who'd love to sell her soul
 If anybody's buying
 Nobody's hero

 @{i}I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family
 All their lives were shattered in a nightmare of brutality
 They try to carry on, try to bear the agony
 Try to hold some faith in the goodness of humanity@{ui}

 As the years went by, we drifted apart
 When I heard that she was gone
 I felt a shadow cross my heart
 But she's nobody's -

 Hero - the voice of reason
 Against the howling mob
 Hero - the pride of purpose
 In the unrewarding job

 Hero - not the champion player
 Who plays the perfect game
 Not the glamor boy
 Who loves to sell his name
 Everybody's buying

 There is a lake
 Between sun and moon
 Not too many know about
 In the silence between
 Whisper and shout
 The space between
 Wonder and doubt

 This is a fine place
 Shining face to face
 Those bonfire lights
 In the mirror of sky
 The space between
 Wonder and why

 ahh yes to yes, to ahh ahh to yes
 why the sun why the sun

 There is a fine line
 Between love and illusion -
 A fine place to penetrate
 The gap between actor and act
 The lens between wishes and fact

 This is a fine place to hesitate
 Those bonfire lights
 In the lake of sky
 The time between wonder and why

 Some need to pray to the sun at high noon
 Some need to howl at the midwinter moon
 Reborn and baptized in a moment of grace
 We just need a break - from the headlong race

 ahh yes to yes, to ahh ahh to yes
 why the sun why the sun

 You and I,
 We are strangers by one chromosome
 Slave to the hormone, body and soul
 In a struggle to be happy and free
 Swimming in a primitive sea

 You and I,
 We must dive below the surface
 A world of red neon, and ultramarine
 Shining bridges on the ocean floor
 Reaching to the alien shore

 For you and me - Sex is not a competition
 For you and me - Sex is not a job description
 For you and me - We agree

 You and I,
 We are pressed into these solitudes
 Color and culture, language and race
 Just variations on a theme
 Islands in a much larger stream

 For you and me - Race is not a competition
 For you and me - Race is not a definition
 For you and me - We agree

 Reaching for the alien shore

 You and I,
 We reject these narrow attitudes
 We add to each other,
 like a coral reef
 Building bridges on the ocean floor
 Reaching for the alien shore

 For you and me - We hold these truths to be self-evident
 For you and me - We'd elect each other president
 For you and me - We might agree
 But that's just us

 Reaching for the alien shore

 Love is born with lightning bolts
 Electro-magnetic force
 Burning skin and fireworks
 A storm on a raging course

 Like a force of nature,
 Love can fade with the stars at dawn
 Sometimes it takes all your strength
 Just to keep holding on
 At the speed of love
 A radiance that travels
 At the speed of love
 My heart goes out to you

 Love is born with solar flares
 From two magnetic poles
 It moves toward a higher plane
 Where 2 halves make 2 wholes

 Like a force of nature,
 Love shines in many forms
 One night we are bathed in light
 One day carried away in storms
 At the speed of love
 Nothing changes faster
 Than the speed of love
 My heart goes out to you

 We don't have to talk
 We don't even have to touch
 I can feel your presence
 In the silence that we share
 Got to keep on moving
 At the speed of love

 Nothing changes faster
 Than the speed of love
 Got to keep on shining
 At the speed of love
 Nothing changes faster
 Than the speed of love
 My heart goes out to you

 Where would you rather be?
 Anywhere but here
 When will the time be right?
 Anytime but now

 On the edge of sleep,
 I was drifting for half the night
 Anxious and restless,
 Pressed down by the darkness
 Bound up and wound up so tight
 So many decisions, a million revisions
 Caught between darkness and light ...
 Wilderness of mirrors
 World of polished steel
 Gears and iron chains
 Turn the grinding wheel
 I run between the shadows
 Some are phantoms, some are real

 Where would you rather be?
 Anywhere but here
 When will the time be right?
 Anytime but now
 The doubt and the fear
 I know would all disappear
 Anywhere but here

 On the edge of sleep,
 I heard voices behind the door
 The known and the nameless,
 Familiar and faceless
 My angels and my demons at war
 Which one will lose - 
 Depends on what I choose
 Or maybe which voice I ignore

 Wilderness of mirrors
 Streets of cold desire
 My precious sense of honor
 Just a shield of rusty wire
 I hold against the chaos -
 And the cross of holy fire

 Wilderness of mirrors
 So easy to deceive
 My precious sense of rightness
 Is sometimes so naive
 So that which I imagine
 Is that which I believe

 On the edge of sleep,
 I awoke to a sun so bright
 Rested and fearless,
 Cheered by your nearness
 I knew which direction was right
 The case had been tried by the jury inside
 The choice between darkness and light ...

 It was long after midnight
 When we got to unconditional love
 She said sure, my heart is boundless
 But don't push my limits too far

 I said if love is so transcendant
 I don't understand these boundaries
 She said just don't disappoint me -
 You know how complex women are
 I'll be around
 If you don't let me down
 Too far

 It was just before sunrise
 When we started on traditional roles
 She said sure, I'll be your partner
 But don't make too many demands

 I said if love has these conditions
 I don't understand
 Those songs you love
 She said this is not a love song

 This isn't fantasy-land
 I'll be around
 If you don't push me down
 Too far

 Don't go too far -
 The phosphorescent wave
 On a tropical sea
 Is a cold fire

 Don't cross the line - 
 The pattern of moonlight
 On the bedroom floor
 Is a cold fire

 Don't let me down -
 The flame at the heart
 Of a pawnbroker's diamond
 Is a cold fire

 Don't break the spell -
 The look in your eyes
 As you head for the door
 Is a cold fire

 Love is blind if you are gentle
 Love can turn to a long, cold burn

 In the house where nobody laughs
 And nobody sleeps
 In the house where love lies dying
 And the shadows creep
 A little girl hides, shaking,
 With her hands on her ears
 Pushing back the tears,
 'til the pain disappears

 Mama says some ugly words
 Daddy pounds the wall
 They can fight about
 Their little girl later
 But right now, they don't care at all
 No matter what they say ...
 No matter what they say ...


 Everyday people
 Everyday shame
 Everyday promise
 Shot down in flames

 Everyday sunrise
 Another everyday story
 Rise from the ashes -
 A blaze of everyday glory

 In the city where nobody smiles
 And nobody dreams
 In the city where desperation
 Drives the bored to extremes

 Just one spark of decency
 Against the starless night
 One glow of hope and dignity
 A child can follow the light
 No matter what they say ...
 No matter what they say ...

 If the future's looking dark
 We're the ones who have to shine
 If there's no one in control
 We're the ones who draw the line
 Though we live in trying times -
 We're the ones who have to try
 Though we know that time has wings -
 We're the ones who have to fly

 He's got a road map of Jupiter
 A radar fix on the stars
 All along the highway
 She's got a liquid-crystal compass 
 A picture book of the rivers
 Under the Sahara

 They travel in the time of the prophets
 On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
 Like lovers and hereos, and the restless part of everyone
 We're only at home when we're on the run
 On the run

 He's got a star map of Hollywood
 A list of cheap motels
 All along the freeway
 She's got a sister out in Vegas
 The promise of a decent job
 Far away from her hometown

 They travel on the road to redemption
 A highway out of yesterday - that tomorrow will bring
 Like lovers and heroes, birds in the last days of spring
 We're only at home when we're on the wing
 On the wing

 WHEN WE ARE YOUNG
 WANDERING THE FACE OF THE EARTH
 WONDERING WHAT OUR DREAMS MIGHT BE WORTH
 LEARNING THAT WE'RE ONLY IMMORTAL -
 FOR A LIMITED TIME

 Time is a gypsy caravan
 Steals away in the night
 To leave you stranded in Dreamland
 Distance is a long-range filter
 Memory a flickering light
 Left behind in the heartland

 We travel in the dark of the new moon
 A starry highway traced on the map of the sky
 Like lovers and heroes, lonely as the eagle's cry
 We're only at home when we're on the fly
 On the fly

 We travel on the road to adventure
 On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
 Like lovers and hereos, and the restless part of everyone
 We're only at home when we're on the run
 On the run...

 If we burn our wings
 Flying too close to the sun
 If the moment of glory
 Is over before it's begun
 If the dream is won
 Though everything is lost
 We will pay the price,
 But we will not count the cost

 When the dust has cleared
 And victory denied
 A summit too lofty
 River a little too wide
 If we keep our pride
 Though paradise is lost
 We will pay the price,
 But we will not count the cost

 And if the music stops
 There's only the sound of the rain
 All the hope and glory
 All the sacrifice in vain
 [And] if love remains
 Though everything is lost
 We will pay the price,
 But we will not count the cost

 Well, you can stake that claim
 Good work is the key to good fortune
 Winners take that praise
 Losers seldom take that blame
 If they don't take that game
 And sometimes the winner takes nothing
 We draw our own designs
 But fortune has to make that frame

 We go out in the world and take our chances
 Fate is just the weight of circumstances
 That's the way that lady luck dances
 Roll the bones

 Why are we here?
 Because we're here
 Roll the bones
 Why does it happen?
 Because it happens
 Roll the bones

 Faith is cold as ice -
 Why are little ones born only to suffer
 For the want of immunity 
 Or a bowl of rice?
 Well, who would hold a price
 On the heads of the innocent children
 If there's some immortal power 
 To control the dice?

 We come into the world and take our chances
 Fate is just the weight of circumstances
 That's the way that lady luck dances
 Roll the bones

 Jack -- relax.
 Get busy with the facts.
 No zodiacs or almanacs,
 No maniacs in polyester slacks.
 Just the facts.
 Gonna kick some gluteus max.
 It's a parallax -- you dig?
 You move around
 The small gets big. It's a rig
 It's action -- reaction --
 Random interaction.
 So who's afraid 
 Of a little abstraction?
 Can't get no satisfaction
 From the facts?
 You better run, homeboy --
 A fact's a fact 
 From Nome to Rome, boy.

 What's the deal? Spin the wheel.
 If the dice are hot -- take a shot.
 Play your cards. Show us what you got
 What you're holding.
 If the cards are cold,
 Don't go folding.
 Lady Luck is golden; 
 She favors the bold. That's cold
 Stop throwing stones --
 The night has a thousand saxophones.
 So get out there and rock,
 And roll the bones.
 Get busy!

 You turn my head
 I spin my wheels
 Running on empty
 You know how that feels

 I'm on a roll now -
 Or is it a slide?
 Can't be too careful 
 With that dangerous pride
 If I could only reach that dial inside
 And turn it up

 FACE UP - Or you can only back down
 FACE UP - Hit the target, or you better hit the ground
 FACE UP - There's still time to turn the game around
 FACE UP - Turn it up -
 Or turn that wild card down
 Turn it up

 Don't complain
 Don't explain
 I don't think my new resolve
 Can stand the strain

 I'm in a groove now -
 Or is it a rut?
 I need some feedback
 But all the lines are cut
 I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut
 And turn it up

 You get all squeezed up inside
 Like the days were carved in stone
 You get all wired up inside
 And it's bad to be alone

 You can go out, you can take a ride
 And when you get out on your own
 You get all smoothed out inside
 And it's good to be alone
 Turn it up

 Well, I was only a kid - didn't know enough to be afraid
 Playing the game, but not the way the big boys played
 Nothing to lose - maybe I had something to trade
 The way the big wheel spins

 Well, I was only a kid, on a holy crusade
 I placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made
 Take no chances on paradise delayed
 So I do a slow fade

 PLAYING FOR TIME
 Don't want to wait for heaven
 LOOKING FOR LOVE
 For an angel to forgive my sins
 PLAYING WITH FIRE
 Chasing something new to believe in
 LOOKING FOR LOVE
 The way the big wheel spins

 Well, I was only a kid, cruising around in a trance
 Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance
 I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance
 The way the big wheel spins

 Well, I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance
 Going for broke, going for another chance
 Hoping for heaven - hoping for a fine romance
 If I do the right dance

 Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith
 Taking your chances you'll have the right answers
 When the final judgment begins

 Wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate
 Life redirected in ways unexpected
 Sometimes the odd number wins
 The way the big wheel spins

 All around that dull gray world
 From Moscow to Berlin
 People storm the barricades
 Walls go tumbling in

 The counter-revolution
 People smiling through their tears
 Who can give them back their lives
 And all those wasted years?
 All those precious wasted years -
 Who will pay?

 All around that dull gray world
 Of ideology
 People storm the marketplace
 And buy up fantasy

 The counter-revolution
 At the counter of a store
 People buy the things they want
 And borrow for a little more
 All those wasted years
 All those precious wasted years
 Who will pay?

 Do we have to be forgiving at last?
 What else can we do?
 Do we have to say goodbye to the past?
 Yes I guess we do

 All around this great big world
 All the crap we had to take
 Bombs and basement fallout shelters
 All our lives at stake

 The bloody revolution
 All the warheads in its wake
 All the fear and suffering 
 All a big mistake
 All those wasted years
 All those precious wasted years
 Who will pay?

 Like a million little doorways
 All the choices we made
 All the stages we passed through
 All the roles we played

 For so many different directions
 Our separate paths might have turned
 With every door that we opened
 Every bridge that we burned

 Somehow we find each other
 Through all that masquerade
 Somehow we found each other
 Somehow we have stayed
 In a state of grace

 I DON'T BELIEVE IN DESTINY
 OR THE GUIDING HAND OF FATE
 I DON'T BELIEVE IN FOREVER
 OR LOVE AS A MYSTICAL STATE

 I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE STARS OR THE PLANETS
 OR ANGELS WATCHING FROM ABOVE
 BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A GHOST OF A CHANCE
 WE CAN FIND SOMEONE TO LOVE
 AND MAKE IT LAST

 Like a million little crossroads
 Through the backstreets of youth
 Each time we turn a new corner
 A tiny moment of truth

 [For] so many different connections
 Our separate paths might have made
 With every door that we opened
 Every game we played

 You just don't get it
 What it is ... well, you're not really sure
 You move like you're walking on this ice
 Talking like you're still insecure

 Time is a spiral - Space is a curve
 I know you get dizzy, but try not to lose your nerve
 Life is a diamond you turn into dust
 Waiting for rescue, and I know you just
 Don't get it
 You just don't get it

 Neurotica - Exotica
 It's just Erotica - Hypnotica
 It's just Psychotica - Chaotica
 It's just Exotica - Neurotica

 You just don't get it
 Baby, don't you ask yourself why?
 If you don't like the answer - forget it
 You know I hate to see you cry

 Fortune is random - Fate shoots from the hip
 I know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip
 Life is a diamond you turn into dust
 Looking for trust, and I know that you just
 Don't get it
 You just don't get it

 SNAP!
 Hide in your shell, let the world go to hell
 It's like Russian roulette to you
 SNAP!
 Sweat running cold, you can't face growing old
 It's a personal threat to you
 SNAP!
 The world is a cage for your impotent rage
 But don't let it get to you
 SNAP!

 How many times do you hear it?
 It goes on all day long
 Everyone knows everything

 It's hard to play it safe
 But apart from a few good friends
 We don't take anything on faith
 Until later

 Energy is contagious
 Enthusiasm spreads
 Tides respond to lunar gravitation
 Everything turns in synchronous relation

 Laughter is infectious
 Excitement goes to my head
 Winds are stirred by planets in rotation
 Sparks ignite and spread new information

 Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate

 Sun dogs fire on the horizon
 Meteor rain stars across the night
 This moment may be brief
 But it can be so bright

 Hope is epidemic
 Optimism spreads
 Bitterness breeds irritation
 Ignorance breeds imitation

 Sun dogs fire on the horizon
 Meteor rain stars across the night
 This moment may be brief
 But it can be so bright
 Reflected in another source of light
 When the moment dies
 The spark still flies
 Reflected in another pair of eyes

 Dreams are sometimes catching
 Desire goes to my head
 Love responds to your invitation
 Love responds to imagination

 Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate

 What is "Chain Lightning" about?

 Neil Peart ("Rush Profiled!"):

 "I'm a weather fanatic, I really love weather, and I watch the weather and
 look for a good weatherman. And, one night I was watching it, and there are
 2 incidents in that song that are synchronicity to one weather report, where
 the weatherman showed a picture of sun dogs, and described them, and they
 are just 2 little points of light that appear at sunset, often in the winter
 when the sky is clear and crystalline, and they are like little prisms, and
 they sit about 10 degrees north and south of the setting sun, and they are
 just beautiful little diamonds of light, and often times there's a circle of
 light; one line, that connects them. So they are a really beautiful natural
 phenomenon, and I love the name, too. "Sun dogs" just has a great sound to
 it. And in that same weather forecast, the weatherman announced a meteor
 shower that night, and so my daughter and I went out on the lake in the
 middle of the night and watched this meteor shower. So the whole idea of the
 song was response and how people respond to things, and it's a thing I've
 found a lot in traveling around the world, too. It's not enough just to
 travel and see things. You have to respond to them; you have to feel them,
 and a lot of the thrust of that song is how things are transferred, like
 chain lightning or enthusiasm or energy or love are things that are
 contagious, and if someone feels them, they are easily transferrable to
 another person, or in the case of watching a meteor shower, it's made more
 special if there is someone else there. "Reflected in another pair of eyes"
 is the idea that it's a wonderful thing already, just you and the meteor
 shower, but if there's someone else there with you to share it, then it
 multiplies, you know, it becomes exponentially a bigger experience, so
 response is a theme that recurs in several of the songs and was one of my
 probably dominant sub-themes in the writing."

 Proud swagger out of the schoolyard
 Waiting for the world's applause
 Rebel without a conscience
 Marter without a cause

 Static on your frequency
 Electrical storm in your veins
 Raging at unreachable glory
 Straining at invisible chains

 And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
 Staring down into a heartless sea
 Can't face life on a razor's edge
 Nothing's what you thought it would be

 All of us get lost in the darkness
 Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
 All of us do time in the gutter
 Dreamers turn to look at the cars
 Turn around and turn around and turn around
 Turn around and walk the razor's edge
 Don't turn your back
 And slam the door on me

 It's not as if this barricade
 Blocks the only road
 It's not as if you're all alone
 In wanting to explode

 Someone set a bad example
 Made surrender seem all right
 The act of a noble warrior
 Who lost the will to fight

 And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
 Staring down into a heartless sea
 Done with life on a razor's edge
 Nothing's what you thought it would be

 No hero in your tragedy
 No daring in your escape
 No salutes for your surrender
 Nothing noble in your fate
 Christ, what have you done?

 Girl before the mirror
 Appraises her disguise
 Child become a mother
 Tries to fix her eyes
 No more of his excuses
 It has to be today
 She can keep her fantasy
 If she can get away

 Paint her name on a one-way street
 Painted cheeks with angry heat
 Wounded pride on painted eyes
 Paint the night with battlecries

 All puffed up with vanity
 We see what we want to see
 To the beautiful and the wise
 The mirror always lies

 Boy before the mirror
 Checks his camoflauge
 Polishes his armor
 And the charger in the garage
 No more lame excuses
 It has to be tonight
 He can take the princess
 If he can take the fight

 Pound the drums with martial beat
 Pound the streets with marching feet
 Wounded pride, distorted eyes
 Paint the night with battlecries

 All puffed up with vanity
 We see what we want to see
 To the powerful and the wise
 The mirror always lies

 Boys and girls together
 Mistake conceit for pride
 - ambition for illusion
 - dreams for self-delusion
 Girls and boys together
 See what it is we lack
 Boys and girls together
 Let's paint the mirror black
 Paint it black

 I've stood upon my mountaintop
 And shouted at the sky
 Walked above the pavement
 With my sense amplified
 - I get this feeling

 All my nerves are naked wires
 Tender to the touch
 Sometimes super-sensitive
 But who can care too much?
 - I get this feeling

 Scars of pleasure
 Scars of pain
 Atmospheric changes
 Make them sensitive again

 Each emotional injury
 Leaves behind its mark
 Sometimes they come tumbling out
 Like shadows in the dark
 - I get this feeling

 When I think about all I have seen
 And all I'll never see
 When I think about the people
 Who have opened up to me
 - I get this feeling

 Snow falls deep around my house
 And holds the winter light
 I've heard the lions hunting
 In the Serengeti night
 - I get this feeling

 Forests turned to factories
 And river, sea, and sky
 Hungry child in the desert
 And the flies that cloud her eyes
 - I get this feeling

 Pleasure leaves a fingerprint
 As surely as mortal pain
 In memories they resonate
 And echo back again

 If I could wave my magic wand...

 I am made from the dust of the stars
 And the oceans flow in my veins
 Here I hide in the heart of the city
 Like a stranger coming out of the rain

 The evening plane rises up from the runway
 Over constellations of light
 I look down into a million houses
 And wonder what you're doing tonight

 If I could wave my magic wand
 I'd make everything all right

 I'm not one to believe in magic
 But I sometimes have a second-sight
 I'm not one with a sense of proportion
 When my heart still changes overnight

 I had a dream of a winter garden
 A midnight rendezvous
 Silver, blue, and frozen silence
 What a fool I was for you

 I had a dream of the open water
 I was swimming away out to sea
 So deep I could never touch bottom
 What a fool I used to be

 If I could wave my magic wand
 I'd set everybody free

 I'm not one to believe in magic
 Though my memory has a second-sight
 I'm not one to go pointing my finger
 When I radiate more heat than light

 Don't ask me
 I'm just improvising
 My illusion of careless flight
 Can't you see
 My temperature's rising
 I radiate more heat than light

 Don't ask me
 I'm just sympathizing
 My illusions a harmless flight
 Can't you see
 My temperature's rising
 I radiate more heat than light

 Package the illusion of persona

 The fact that she's only too real

 She never leaves it

 Hit you in a soft place
 With sentimental ease

 There's a snake coming out of the darkness
 Parade from paradise
 End the need for eden
 Chase the dreams of merchandise

 There is tic and toc in atomic
 Leaders make a deal
 The cosmic is largely comic
 A con they couldn't conceal

 There is no safe seat at the feast
 Take your best stab at the beast
 The night is turning thin
 The saint is turning to sin

 Raise the art to resistance
 Danger dare to be grand
 Pride reduced to humble pie
 Diamonds down to sand

 Take heart from earth and weather
 The brightness of new birth
 Take heart from the harvest
 Shave the harvest from the earth

 Reasoning is partly insane
 Image just an eyeless game
 The night is turning thin
 The saint is turning to sin

 Miracles will have their claimers
 More will bow to Rome
 He and she are in the house
 But there's only me at home

 Rose is a rose of splendor
 Posed to respond in the end
 Lonely things like nights,
 I find, end finer with a friend

 I hear in the rate of her heart
 A tear in the heat of the art

 The night turns thin
 The saint turns to sin

 Nature has some new plague
 To run in our streets
 History some new wrinkle
 We are doomed to repeat
 Fugitives at the bedroom door
 Lovers pause to find an open store
 Rain is burning on the forest floor
 And the red tide kisses the shore

 THIS IS NOT A FALSE ALARM
 THIS IS NOT A TEST

 Stay out of the sun
 It only burns my skin
 Sky full of poison
 And the atmosphere's too thin
 Bless the sun, the rain no more
 River running like an open sore
 Black wind falling to the ocean floor
 And the red tide washes ashore

 THIS IS NOT A FALSE ALARM
 THIS IS NOT A TEST
 Nowhere we can fly away
 Nowhere we can rest
 The party is disrupted by
 An uninvited guest

 Deadline approaches
 For the weary land
 It used to be something
 But we let it run down in our hands
 Too late for debate, too bad to ignore
 Quiet rebellion leads to open war
 Bring a sea-change to the factory floor
 As the red tide covers the shore

 Now's the time to turn the tide
 Now's the time to fight
 Let us not go gently
 To the endless winter night
 Now's the time to make the time
 While hope is still in sight
 Let us not go gently
 To the endless winter night

 Hand over fist
 Paper around the stone
 Scissors cut the paper
 Cut the paper to the bone
 Hand over fist
 Paper around the stone
 Scissors cut the paper
 And the rock must stand alone

 I could disappear into the crowd
 But not if I keep my head in the clouds
 I could walk away so proud
 It's easy enough if you don't laugh too loud

 I thought I was okay alone
 Wait for the postman and the telephone
 Lost in a world of my own
 I thought I could run alone
 Thought I could run through the night alone

 Hand over hand
 Doesn't seem so much
 Hand over hand
 Is the strength of the common touch

 You talk as we walk along
 You never imagined I could be so wrong
 Humming your favorite song
 You know I've hated that song for so long

 How can we ever agree?
 Like the rest of the world
 We grow farther apart
 I swear you don't listen to me
 Holding my hand to my heart
 Holding my fist to my racing heart

 Take a walk outside myself
 In some exotic land
 Greet a passing stranger
 Feel the strength in his hand
 Feel the world expand

 I feel my spirit resist
 But I open up my fist
 Lay hand over hand over
 Hand over fist

 The restless wind
 Has seen all things
 In every kind of light
 Rising with the full moon
 To go howling through the night

 The sleepless wind
 Has heard all things
 Between the sea and sky
 In the canyons of the city
 You can hear the buildings cry

 Oh the wind can carry
 All the voices of the sea
 Oh the wind can carry
 All the echoes home to me

 Run with wind and weather
 To the music of the sea
 All 4 winds together
 Can't bring the world to me
 Chase the wind around the world
 I want to look at life -
 In the available light

 Play of light
 A photograph
 The way I used to be
 Some half-forgotten stranger
 Doesn't mean that much to me

 Trick of light
 Moving picture
 Moments caught in flight
 Make the shadows darker
 Or the colors shine too bright

 Oh the light can carry
 All the visions of the sea
 Oh the light can carry
 All the images to me

 Run to light from shadow
 Sun gives me no rest
 Promise offered in the east
 Broken in the west
 Chase the sun around the world
 I want to look at life -
 In the available light

 All 4 winds together
 Can't bring the world to me
 Shadows hide the play of light
 So much I want to see
 Chase the light around the world
 I want to look at life -
 In the available light

 I'll go with the wind
 I'll stand in the light

 Tough times demand tough talk
 Demand tough hearts demand tough songs
 Demand -

 We can rise and fall like empires
 Flow in and out like the tide
 Be vain and smart, humble and dumb
 We can hit and miss like pride

 We can circle around like hurricanes
 Dance and dream like lovers
 Attack the day like birds of prey
 Or scavengers under cover

 Look in - to the eye of the storm
 Look out - for the force without form
 Look around - at the sight and the sound
 Look in look out look around -

 We can move with savage grace
 To the rhythms of the night
 Cool and remote like dancing girls
 In the heat of the beat and the lights

 We can wear the rose of romance
 An air of joie de vivre
 Too-tender hearts upon our sleeves
 Or skin as thick as thieves'

 Rising falling at force 10
 We twist the world and ride the wind

 Look in - look the storm in the eye
 Look out - to the sea and the sky
 Look around - at the sight and the sound
 Look in look out look around -

 I turn my back to the wind
 To catch my breath,
 Before I start off again.
 Driven on without a moment to spend
 To pass an evening with a drink and a friend

 I let my skin get too thin
 I'd like to pause.
 No matter what I pretend
 Like some pilgrim -
 Who learns to transcend -
 Learns to live
 As if each step was the end

 Time stand still - I'm not looking back
 But I want to look around me now
 See more of the people and the places that surround me now

 Freeze this moment a little bit longer
 Make each sensation a little bit stronger
 Experience slips away...

 I turn my face to the sun
 Close my eyes.
 Let my defences down -
 All those wounds that I can't get unwound

 I let my past go too fast
 No time to pause -
 If I could slow it all down
 Like some captain, whose ship runs aground -
 I can wait until the tide comes around

 Make each impression a little bit stronger
 Freeze this motion a little bit longer
 The innocence slips away...

 Summer's going fast, nights growing colder
 Children growing up - old friends growing colder
 Experience slips away...

 It went right by me -
 At the time it went over my head
 I was looking out the window
 I should have looked at your face instead

 It went right by me -
 Just another wall
 There should have been a moment
 When we let our barriers fall
 I never meant what you're thinking -
 That is not what I meant at all...

 Well I guess we all have these feelings
 We can't leave unreconciled
 Some of them burned on our ceilings
 Some of them learned as a child

 The things that we're concealing
 Will never let us grow
 Time will do its healing
 You've got to let it go

 Closed for my protection -
 Open to your scorn
 Between these 2 directions
 My heart is sometimes torn

 I lie awake with my secrets
 Spinning around my head
 Something that somehow escaped me -
 Something you shouldn't have said
 I was looking out the window
 I should have looked at your face instead...

 I find no absolution
 In my rational point of view
 Maybe some things are instinctive
 But there's one thing you could do
 You could try to understand me -
 I could try to understand you...

 A memo to a higher office
 Open letter to the powers-that-be
 To a God, a king, a head of state
 A captain of industry
 To the movers and the shakers -
 Can't everybody see?

 It ought to be second nature -
 I mean, the places where we live!
 Let's talk about this sensibly -
 We're not insensitive
 I know progress has no patience -
 But something's got to give

 I know you're different -
 You know I'm the same
 We're both too busy
 To be taking the blame
 I'd like some changes
 But you don't have the time
 We can't go on thinking
 It's a victimless crime
 No one is blameless
 But we're all without shame
 We fight the fire - while we're feeding the flames

 Folks have got to make choices -
 And choices got to have voices
 Folks are basically decent
 Conventional wisdom would say
 Well, we read about the exceptions
 In the papers every day

 It ought to be second nature -
 At least, that's what I feel
 "Now I lay me down in Dreamland" -
 I know perfect's not for real
 I thought we might get closer -
 But I'm ready to make a deal

 Today is different, and tomorrow the same
 It's hard to take the world the way that it came
 Too many rapids keep us sweeping along
 Too many captains keep on steering us wrong
 It's hard to take the heat -
 It's hard to lay blame
 To fight the fire - while we're feeding the flames

 Basic elemental instinct to survive
 Stirs the higher passions
 Thrill to be alive

 Alternating currents in a tidewater surge
 Rational resistance to an unwise urge
 (anything can happen)

 From the point of conception
 To the moment of Truth
 At the point of surrender
 To the burden of proof

 From the point of ignition
 To the final drive
 The point of the journey is not to arrive
 (anything can happen)

 Basic temperamental filters on our eyes
 Alter our perceptions
 Lenses polarize

 Alternating currents force a show of hands
 Rational responses force a change of plans
 (anything can happen)

 From a point on the compass
 To magnetic north
 The point of the needle moving back and forth

 From the point of entry -
 Until the candle is burned
 The point of departure is not to return
 (anything can happen)

 I set the wheels in motion
 Turn up all the machines
 Activate the programs
 And run behind the scene

 I set the clouds in motion
 Turn up light and sound
 Activate the window
 And watch the world go 'round -
 (anything can happen)

 I don't want to face the killer instinct -
 Face it in your or me

 We carry a sensitive cargo
 Below the waterline -
 Ticking like a time bomb
 With a primitive design

 Behind the finer feelings -
 This civilized veneer -
 The heart of a lonely hunter
 Guards a dangerous frontier

 The balance can sometimes fail -
 Strong emotions can tip the scale -

 Don't want to silence a desperate voice
 For the sake of security
 No one wants to make a terrible choice
 On the price of being free
 I don't want to face the killer instinct - face it in you or me
 So we keep it under lock and key...

 It's not a matter of mercy
 It's not a matter of laws
 Plenty of people will kill you for some fanatical cause

 It's not a matter of conscience -
 A search for probable cause
 It's just a matter of instinct - a matter of fatal flaws

 No reward for resistance
 No assistance - no applause...

 We don't want to be victims
 On that we all agree, so we lock up the killer instinct -
 And throw away the key...

 Hold your fire -
 Keep it burning bright
 Hold the flame 'til the dream ignites -
 A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission

 I hear their passionate music
 Read the words that touch my heart
 I gaze at their feverish pictures
 The secrets that set them apart

 When I feel the powerful visions
 Their fire has made alive
 I wish I had that instinct - I wish I had that drive

 Spirits fly on dangerous missions
 Imaginations on fire
 Focused high on soaring ambitions
 Consumed in a single desire

 In the grip of a nameless possession -
 A slave to the drive of obsession -
 A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission...

 I watch their images flicker
 Bringing light to a lifeless screen
 I walk through their beautiful buildings
 And I wish I had their dreams

 But dreams don't need to have motion
 To keep their spark alive
 Obsession has to have action -
 Pride turns on the drive

 It's cold comfort
 To the ones without it
 To know how they struggled -
 How they suffered about it

 If their lives were exotic and strange
 They would likely have gladly exchanged them
 For something a little more plain
 Maybe something a little more sane

 We each pay a fabulous price
 For our visions of paradise
 But a spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission...

 Nothing can survive in a vacuum
 No one can exists all alone
 We pretend things only happen to strangers
 We've all got problems of our own

 It's enough to learn to share our pleasures
 We can't sooth pain with sympathy
 All that we can do is be reminded -
 We shake our heads at the tragedy

 Every day we're standing in a time capsule
 Racing down a river from the past
 Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel
 Facing down the future coming fast

 It's just the age
 It's just a stage -
 We disengage - We turn the page...

 Looking at the long-range forecast
 Catching all the names in the news
 Checking out the state of the nation
 Learning the environmental blues

 Truth is after all a moving target
 Hairs to split, and pieces that don't fit
 How can anybody be enlightened?
 Truth is after all so poorly lit

 High on the sacred mountain
 Up the seven thousand stairs
 In the golden light of autumn
 There was magic in the air

 Clouds surrounded the summit
 The wind blew strong and cold
 Among the silent temples
 And the writing carved in gold
 Somewhere in my instincts
 The primitive took hold...

 I stood at the top of the mountain
 And China sang to me
 In the peaceful haze of harvest time
 A song of eternity -

 If you raise your hands to heaven
 You will live a hundred years
 I stood there like a mystic
 Lost in the atmosphere

 The clouds were suddenly parted
 For a moment I could see
 The patterns of the landscape
 Reaching to the eastern sea
 I looked upon a presence
 Spanning forty centuries...

 I thought of time and distance
 The hardships of history
 I heard the hope and the hunger
 When China sang to me...

 When the waters rose in the darkness
 In the wake of the endless flood
 It flowed into our memory - it flowed into our blood

 When something broke the surface
 Just to see the starry dome -
 We still feel that relation
 When the water takes us home
 In the flying spray of the ocean
 The water takes you home -

 Springing from the weight of the mountains
 Like the heart of the earth would burst
 Flowing out from marble fountains
 In the dreams of a desert thirst

 Something swam through the jungles
 Where the mighty rivers roam -
 Something breaks the silence
 When the water takes you home
 I hear the wordless voices
 When the water takes me home -

 Waves that crash on the shoreline
 Torrents of tropical rain streaming down
 Beyond our memory
 Streaming down inside our veins

 When something left the ocean
 To crawl high above the foam -
 We still feel that elation
 When the water takes us home
 In a driving rain of redemption
 The water takes me home...

 Big money goes around the world
 Big money underground
 Big money got a mighty voice
 Big money make no sound
 Big money pull a million strings
 Big money hold the prize
 Big money weave a mighty web
 Big money draw the flies

 Sometimes pushing people around
 Sometimes pulling out the rug
 Sometimes pushing all the buttons
 Sometimes pulling out the plug
 It's the power and the glory
 It's a war in paradise
 It's a cinderella story
 On a tumble of the dice

 Big money goes around the world
 Big money take a cruise
 Big money leave a mighty wake
 Big money leave a bruise
 Big money make a million dreams
 Big money spin big deals
 Big money make a mighty head
 Big money spin big wheels

 Sometimes building ivory towers
 Sometimes knocking castles down
 Sometimes building you a stairway -
 Lock you underground
 It's that old-time religion
 it's the kingdom they would rule
 It's the fool on television
 Getting paid to play the fool

 Big money goes around the world
 Big money give and take
 Big money done a power of good
 Big money make mistakes
 Big money got a heavy hand
 Big money take control
 Big money got a mean streak
 Big money got no soul...

 A to B -
 Different degrees...

 So much style without substance
 So much stuff without style
 It's hard to recognize the real thing
 It comes along once in a while
 Like a rare and precious metal beneath a ton of rock
 It takes some time and trouble to separate from the stock
 You sometimes have to listen to a lot of useless talk

 Shapes and forms against the norms -
 Against the run of the mill
 Swimming against the stream
 Life in 2 dimensions is a mass production scheme

 So much poison in power, the principles get left out
 So much mind on the matter, the spirit gets forgotten about
 Like a righteous inspiration overlooked in haste
 Like a teardrop in the ocean, a diamond in the waste
 Some world-views are spacious - and some are merely spaced

 Against the run of the mill
 Static as it seems
 We break the surface tension with our wild kinetic dreams
 Curves and lines - of grand designs...

 Imagine a time when it all began
 In the dying days of a war
 A weapon - that would settle the score
 Whoever found it first would be sure to do their worst -
 They always had before...

 Imagine a man where it all began
 A scientist pacing the floor
 In each nation - always eager to explore
 To build the best big stick
 To turn the winning trick -
 But this was something more...

 The big bang - took and shook the world
 Shot down the rising sun
 The end was begun - it would hit everyone
 When the chain reaction was done
 The big shots - try to hold it back
 Fools try to wish it away
 The hopeful depend on a world without end
 Whatever the hopeless may say

 Imagine a place where it all began
 They gathered from across the land
 To work in the secrecy of the desert sand
 All of the brightest boys
 To play with the biggest toys -
 More than they bargained for...

 Imagine a man when it all began
 The pilot of "Enola Gay"
 Flying out of the shockwave on that August day
 All the powers that be, and the course of history,
 Would be changed for evermore...

 It's not how fast you can go
 The force goes into the flow
 If you pick up the beat
 You can forget about the heat
 More than just survival
 More than just a flash
 More than just a dotted line
 More than just a dash

 It's a test of ultimate will
 The heartbreak climb uphill
 Got to pick up the pace
 If you want to stay in the race
 More than just blind ambition
 More than just simple greed
 More than just a finish line
 Must feed this burning need -
 In the long run...

 From first to last
 The peak is never passed
 Something always fires the light that gets in your eyes
 One moment's high, and glory rolls on by
 Like a streak of lightening that flashes and fades
 In the summer sky

 Our meters may overload
 You can rest at the side of the road
 You can miss a stride
 But nobody gets a free ride

 More than high performance
 More than just a spark
 More than just the bottom line
 Or a lucky shot in the dark -
 In the long run...

 You can do a lot in a lifetime
 If you don't burn out too fast
 You can make the most of the distance
 First you need endurance -
 First you've got to last...

 I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth
 Like the Chinese call the country of their birth
 We all figure that our homes are set above
 Other people than the ones we know and love
 In every place with a name
 They play the same territorial game
 Hiding behind the lines
 Sending up warning signs

 The whole wide world
 An endless universe
 Yet we keep looking through
 The eyeglass in reverse
 Don't feed the people
 But we feed the machines
 Can't really feel
 What international means
 In different circles, we keep holding our ground
 In different circles, we keep spinning round and round

 We see so many tribes - overrun and undermined
 While their invaders dream of lands they've left behind
 Better people - better food - and better beer
 Why move around the world when Eden was so near?
 The bosses get talking so tough
 And if that wasn't evil enough
 We get the drunken and passionate pride
 Of the citizens along for the ride

 They shoot without shame
 In the name of a piece of dirt
 For a change of accent
 Or the colour of your shirt
 Better the pride that resides
 In a citizen of the world
 Than the pride that divides
 When a colourful rag is unfurled

 The office door closed early
 The hidden bottle came out
 The salesman turned to close the blinds
 A little slow now, a little stout
 But he's still heading down those tracks
 Any day now for sure
 Another day as drab as today
 Is more than a man can endure

 Dreams flow across the heartland
 Feeding on the fires
 Dreams transport desires
 Drive you when you're down -
 Dreams transport the ones who need to get out of town

 The boy walks with his best friend
 Through the fields of early May
 They walk awhile in silence
 One close - one far away
 But he'd be climbing on that bus
 Just him and his guitar
 To blaze across the heavens
 Like a brilliant shooting star

 The middle-aged madonna
 Calls her neighbour on the phone
 Day by day the seasons pass
 And leave her life alone
 But she'll go walking out that door
 On some bright afternoon
 To go and paint big cities
 From a lonely attic room

 It's understood
 By every single person
 Who'd be elsewhere if they could
 So far so good
 And life's not unpleasant
 In their little neighbourhood

 They dream in Middletown...

 When we lift the covers from our feelings
 We expose our insecure spots
 Trust is just as rare as devotion-
 Forgive us our cynical thoughts
 If we need too much attention -
 Not content with being cool
 We must throw ourselves wide open
 And start acting like a fool
 If we need too much approval
 Then the cuts can seem too cruel

 Right to the heart of the matter
 Right to the beautiful part
 Illusions are painfully shattered
 Right where discovery starts
 In the secret wells of emotion
 Buried deep in our hearts

 It's true that love can change us
 But never quite enough
 Sometimes we are too tender
 Sometimes we're too tough
 If we get too much attention
 It gets hard to overrule
 So often fragile power turns
 To scorn and ridicule
 Sometimes our big splashes
 Are just ripples in the pool

 Feelings run high

 So many things I think about
 When I look far away
 Things I know - things I wonder
 Things I'd like to say
 The more we think we know about
 The greater the unknown
 We suspend our disbelief
 And we are not alone -

 Mystic rhythms - capture my thoughts
 And carry them away
 Mysteries of night escape the light of day
 Mystic rhythms - under northern lights
 Primitive things stir
 The hearts of everyone

 We sometimes catch a window
 A glimpse of what's beyond
 Was it just imagination
 Stringing us along?
 More things than are dreamed about
 Unseen and unexplained
 We suspend our disbelief
 And we are entertained

 Mystic rhythms - capture my thoughts
 And carry them away
 Nature seems to spin
 A supernatural way
 Mystic rhythms - under city lights
 Or a canopy of stars
 We feel the powers and we wonder what they are
 We feel the push and pull of restless rhythms from afar

 An ill wind comes arising
 Across the cities of the plain
 There's no swimming in the heavy water;
 No singing in the acid rain
 Red alert
 Red alert

 It's so hard to stay together
 Passing through revolving doors
 We need someone to talk to
 And someone to sweep the floors;
 Incomplete
 Incomplete

 The world weighs on my shoulders
 But what am I to do?
 You sometimes drive me crazy;
 But I worry about you

 I know it makes on difference
 To what you're going through
 But I see the tip of the iceberg;
 And I worry about you...

 Cruising under your radar
 Watching from satellites
 Take a page from the red book;
 Keep them in your sights
 Red alert
 Red alert

 Left and rights of passage
 Black and whites of youth
 Who can face the knowledge
 That the truth is not the truth?
 Obsolete
 Absolute

 Suddenly,
 You were gone
 From all the lives
 You left your mark upon

 I remember,
 How we talked and drank
 Into the misty dawn
 - I hear the voices

 We ran by the water
 On the wet summer lawn
 - I see the foot prints
 I remember,

 - I feel the way you would
 - I feel the way you would

 Tried to believe
 But you know it's no good
 This is something
 That just can't be understood

 I remember,
 The shouts of joy
 Skiing fast through the woods
 - I hear the echoes

 I learned your love for life
 I feel the way that you would
 - I feel your presence
 I remember -

 I feel the way you would
 This just can't be understood...

 All that we can do is just survive
 All that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive...

 Ragged lines of ragged grey
 Skeletons, they shuffle away
 Shouting guards and smoking guns
 Will cut down the unlucky ones

 I clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed
 A wound that will not heal, a heart that cannot feel,
 Hoping that the horror will recede
 Hoping that tomorrow, we'll all be freed

 Sickness to insanity
 Prayer to profanity
 Days and weeks and months go by
 Don't feel the hunger, too weak to cry

 I hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate
 Are the liberators here, do I hope or do I fear?
 For my father and my brother, it's too late
 But I must help my mother stand up straight...

 Are we the last ones left alive?
 Are we the only human beings to survive?...

 Things crawl in the darkness
 That imagination spins
 Needles at your nerve ends
 Crawl like spiders on your skin

 Pounding in your temples
 And a surge of adrenaline
 Every muscle tense, to fence the enemy within

 I'm not giving in to security under pressure
 I'm not missing out on the promise of adventure
 I'm not giving up on implausible dreams
 Experience to extremes,
 Experience to extremes

 Suspicious-looking stranger
 Flashes you a dangerous grin
 Shadows across your window,
 Was it only trees in the wind?

 Every breath a static charge,
 A tongue that tastes like tin
 Steely-eyed outside to hide the enemy within...

 To you; is it movement or is it action?
 It is contact or just reaction?
 And you; revolution or just resistance?
 Is it living, or just existence?
 Yeah, you; it takes a little more persistence
 To get up and go the distance...

 One android on the run
 Seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun

 Trying to change its program
 Trying to change the mode, crack the code
 Images conflicting into data overload

 Unit 1's in trouble and it's scared out of its wits

 A pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist...

 It replays each of the days
 A hundred years of routines
 Bows its head and prays

 A world of difference
 A world so out of touch
 Overwhelmed by everything
 But wanting more so much,

 Call it blind frustration
 Call it blind man's bluff
 Call each other names,
 Our voices rude; your voices rough
 Then you learn the lesson
 That it's cool to be so tough

 Handle with kid gloves
 Handle with kid gloves
 Then you learn the lessons
 Taught in school won't be enough
 Put on your kid gloves
 Put on your kid gloves
 Then you learn the lesson
 That it's cool to be so tough

 A world of indifference
 Heads and hearts too full
 Careless of the consequence
 Of constant push and pull

 Anger got bare knuckles
 Anger play the fool
 Anger wear a crown of thorns
 Reverse the golden rule
 Then you learn the lesson
 That it's tough to be so cool

 Handle with kid gloves
 Handle with kid gloves
 Then you learn the weapons
 And the ways of hard-knock school
 Put on your kid gloves
 Put on your kid gloves

 I see red
 It hurts my head
 Guess it must be something
 That I read

 It's the color of your heartbeat
 A rising summer sun
 The battle lost, or won
 The flash to fashion
 And the pulse to passion,
 Feels red
 Inside my head
 And truth is often bitter,
 Left unsaid
 Said red red
 Thinking about the overhead,
 The underfed
 - Couldn't we talk about something else instead?

 We've got mars on the horizon
 Says the national midnight star
 (it's true)
 What you believe is what you are
 A pair of dancing shoes,
 The soviets are the blues,
 The reds
 Under your bed
 Lying,
 In the darkness
 Dead ahead

 And the mercury is rising
 Barometer starts to fall
 You know it gets to us all
 The pain that is learning
 And the rain that is burning,
 Feel red
 Still; go ahead
 You see black and white,
 And I see red
 (not blue)

 To live between a rock and a hard place
 In between time,
 Cruising in prime time, soaking up the cathode rays

 To live between the wars in our time,
 Living in real time,
 Holding the good time, Holding on to yesterdays...

 You know how that rabbit feels
 Going under your speeding wheels
 Bright images flashing by
 Like windshields towards a fly
 Frozen in the fatal climb, but the wheels of time,
 Just pass you by...

 Wheels can take you around
 Wheels can cut you down

 We can go from boom to bust
 From dreams to a bowl of dust
 We can fall from rockets' red glare
 Down to "Brother can you spare..."
 Another war, another waste land,
 And another lost generation...

 It slips between your hands like water
 This living in real time
 A dizzying lifetime
 Reeling by on celluloid

 Struck between the eyes
 By the big-time world
 Walking uneasy streets,
 Hiding beneath the sheets,
 Got to try and fill the void...

 Sprawling on the fringes of the city
 In geometric order
 An insulated border
 In between the bright lights
 And the far unlit unknown

 Growing up it all seems so one-sided
 Opinions all provided
 The future pre-decided
 Detached and subdivided
 In the mass production zone

 Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

 Subdivisions -
 In the high school halls
 In the shopping malls
 Conform or be cast out
 Subdivisions -
 In the basement bars
 In the backs of cars
 Be cool or be cast out
 Any escape might help to smooth
 The unattractive truth
 But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
 The restless dreams of youth

 Drawn like moths we drift into the city
 The timeless old attraction
 Cruising for the action
 Lit up like a firefly
 Just to feel the living night

 Some will sell their dreams for small desires
 Or lose the race to rats
 Get caught in ticking traps

 A hot and windy August afternoon
 Has the trees in constant motion
 With a flash of silver leaves
 As they're rocking in the breeze

 The boy lies in the grass with one blade
 Stuck between his teeth
 A vague sensation quickens
 In his young and restless heart
 And a bright and nameless vision
 Has him longing to depart

 You move me -
 You move me -
 With your buildings and your eyes
 Autumn woods and winter skies
 You move me -
 You move me -
 Open sea and city lights
 Busy streets and dizzy heights
 You call me -
 You call me -

 The fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs
 Dances on the edge of his dream
 And her voice rings in his ears
 Like the music of the spheres

 The boy lies in the grass, unmoving
 Staring at the sky
 His mother starts to call him
 As a hawk goes soaring by
 The boy pulls down his baseball cap
 And covers up his eyes

 Too many hands on my time
 Too many feelings -
 Too many things on my mind
 When I leave I don't know
 What I'm hoping to find
 When I leave I don't know
 What I'm leaving behind...

 His world is under observation -
 We monitor his station
 Under faces and the places
 Where he traces points of view

 He picks up scraps of conversation -
 Radio and radiation
 From the dancers and romancers
 With the answers - but no clue

 He'd love to spend the night in Zion
 He's been a long while in Babylon
 He'd like a lover's wings to fly on
 To a tropic isle of Avalon

 His world is under anaesthetic -
 Subdivided and synthetic
 His reliance on the giants
 In the science of the day

 He picks up scraps of information -
 He's adept at adaptation
 'Cause for strangers and arrangers
 Constant change is here to stay

 He's got a force field and a flexible plan
 He's got a date with fate in a black sedan
 He plays fast forward for as long as he can
 But he won't need a bed -
 He's a digital man

 We've got nothing to fear - but fear itself?
 Not pain or failure, not fatal tragedy?
 Not the faulty units in this mad machinery?
 Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?

 With an iron fist in a velvet glove
 We are sheltered under the gun
 In the glory game on the power train
 Thy kingdom's will be done

 And the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us...

 He's not afraid of your judgement
 He knows of horrors worse than your Hell
 He's a little bit afraid of dying -
 But he's a lot more afraid of your lying

 And the things that he fears are a weapon to be held against him...

 Can any part of life - be larger than life?
 Even love must be limited by time
 And those who push us down that they might climb -
 Is any killer worth more than his crime?

 Like a steely blade in a silken sheath
 We don't see what they're made of
 They shout about love, but when push comes to shove
 They live for the things they're afraid of

 And the knowledge that they fear is a weapon to be used against them...

 He's a rebel and a runner
 He's a signal turning green
 He's a restless young romantic
 Wants to run the big machine

 He's got a problem with his poisons
 But you know he'll find a cure
 He's cleaning up his systems
 To keep his nature pure

 Learning to match the beat of the Old World man
 Learning to catch the heat of the Third World man

 He's got to make his own mistakes
 And learn to mend the mess he makes
 He's old enough to know what's right
 But young enough not to choose it
 He's noble enough to win the world
 But weak enough to lose it -
 He's a New World man...

 He's a radio receiver
 Tuned to factories and farms
 He's a writer and arranger
 And a young boy bearing arms

 He's got a problem with his power
 With weapons on patrol
 He's got to walk a fine line
 And keep his self-control

 Trying to save the day for the Old World man
 Trying to pave the way for the Third World man

 He's not concerned with yesterday
 He knows constant change is here today
 He's noble enough to know what's right
 But weak enough not to choose it
 He's wise enough to win the world
 But fool enough to lose it -

 The dancer slows her frantic pace
 In pain and desperation,
 Her aching limbs and downcast face
 Aglow with perspiration

 Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire,
 With just the briefest pause -
 The flooding through her memory,
 The echoes of old applause.

 She limps across the floor
 And closes her bedroom door...

 The writer stares with glassy eyes -
 Defies the empty page
 His beard is white, his face is lined
 And streaked with tears of rage.

 30 years ago, how the words would flow
 With passion and precision,
 But now his mind is dark and dulled
 By sickness and indecision

 And he stares out the kitchen door
 Where the sun will rise no more...

 Some are born to move the world -
 To live their fantasies
 But most of us just dream about
 The things we'd like to be

 Sadder still to watch it die
 Than never to have known it
 For you - the blind who once could see -
 The bell tolls for thee...

 Lit up with anticipation
 We arrive at the launching site
 The sky is still dark, nearing dawn
 On the Florida coastline

 Circling choppers slash the night
 With roving searchlight beams
 This magic day when super-science
 Mingles with the bright stuff of dreams

 Floodlit in the hazy distance
 The star of this unearthly show
 Venting vapours, like the breath
 Of a sleeping white dragon

 Crackling speakers, voices tense
 Resume the final count
 All systems check, T minus 9
 As the sun and the drama start to mount

 The air is charged - a humid, motionless mass
 The crowds and the cameras,
 The cars full of spectators pass
 Excitement so thick - you could cut it with a knife
 Technology - high, on the leading edge of life

 The earth beneath us starts to tremble
 With the spreading of a low black cloud
 A thunderous roar shakes the air
 Like the whole world exploding

 Scorching blast of golden fire
 As it slowly leaves the ground
 Tears away with a mighty force
 The air is shattered by the awesome sound

 Like a pillar of cloud, the smoke lingers
 High in the air
 In fascination - with the eyes of the world
 We stare...

   A modern-day warrior
   Mean mean stride,
   Today's Tom Sawyer
   Mean mean pride.

 Though his mind is not for rent,
 Don't put him down as arrogant.
 His reserve, a quiet defense,
 Riding out the day's events.
 The river

 What you say about his company
 Is what you say about society.
 Catch the mist, catch the myth
 Catch the mystery, catch the drift.

 The world is, the world is,
 Love and life are deep,
 Maybe as his skies are wide.

   Today's Tom Sawyer,
   He gets high on you,
   And the space he invades
   He gets by on you.

 No, his mind is not for rent
 To any god or government.
 Always hopeful, yet discontent,
 He knows changes aren't permanent,
 But change is.

 What you say about his company
 Is what you say about society.
 Catch the witness, catch the wit,
 Catch the spirit, catch the spit.

 The world is, the world is,
 Love and life are deep,
 Maybe as his eyes are wide.

   Exit the warrior,
   Today's Tom Sawyer,
   He gets high on you,
   And the energy you trade,
   He gets right on to the friction of the day.

 My uncle has a country place
 That no one knows about.
 He says it used to be a farm,
 Before the Motor Law.
 And on Sundays I elude the Eyes,
 And hop the Turbine Freight
 To far outside the Wire,
 Where my white-haired uncle waits.

 Jump to the ground
 As the Turbo slows to cross the Borderline.
 Run like the wind,
 As excitement shivers up and down my spine.
 Down in his barn,
 My uncle preserved for me an old machine,
 For 50-odd years.
 To keep it as new has been his dearest dream.

 I strip away the old debris
 That hides a shining car.
 A brilliant Red Barchetta
 From a better, vanished time.
 I fire up the willing engine,
 Responding with a roar.
 Tires spitting gravel,
 I commit my weekly crime...

 Wind-
 In my hair-
 Shifting and drifting-
 Mechanical music-
 Adrenalin surge...

 Well-weathered leather,
 Hot metal and oil,
 The scented country air.
 Sunlight on chrome,
 The blur of the landscape,
 Every nerve aware.

 Suddenly ahead of me,
 Across the mountainside,
 A gleaming alloy air-car
 Shoots towards me, 2 lanes wide.
 I spin around with shrieking tires,
 To run the deadly race,
 Go screaming through the valley
 As another joins the chase.

 Drive like the wind,
 Straining the limits of machine and man.
 Laughing out loud
 With fear and hope, I've got a desperate plan.
 At the 1-lane bridge
 I leave the giants stranded at the riverside.
 Race back to the farm, to dream with my uncle at the fireside.

 @{u}@{fg shine}What does YYZ stand for?@{uu}@{fg text}

  YYZ is the transmitter code for Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International
  Airport. Every airport is assigned a unique 3 letter code, and that code is
  always being transmitted so that pilots can tell, roughly, where they are
  and verify that their navigational radios are tuned properly. These codes
  are also written on your luggage tags when you fly. The intro to the song
  is Morse code for "YYZ."

 Living on a lighted stage
 Approaches the unreal
 For those who think and feel
 In touch with some reality
 Beyond the gilded cage.

 Cast in this unlikely role,
 Ill-equipped to act,
 With insufficient tact,
 One must put up barriers
 To keep oneself intact.

 Living in the Limelight,
 The universal dream
 For those who wish to seem.
 Those who wish to be
 Must put aside the alienation,
 Get on with the fascination,
 The real relation,
 The underlying theme.

 Living in a fisheye lens,
 Caught in the camera eye.
 I have no heart to lie,
 I can't pretend a stranger
 Is a long-awaited friend.

 All the world's indeed a stage,
 And we are merely players,
 Performers and portrayers,
 Each another's audience
 Outside the gilded cage.

 @{b}1@{ub} Grim-faced and forbidding,
   Their faces closed tight,
   An angular mass of New Yorkers
   Pacing in rhythm,
   Race the oncoming night,
   They chase through the streets of Manhattan.
   Head-first humanity,
   Pause at a light,
   Then flow through the streets of the city.

   They seem oblivious
   To a soft spring rain,
   Like an English rain
   So light, yet endless
   From a leaden sky.

   The buildings are lost 
   In their limitless rise.
   My feet catch the pulse 
   And the purposeful stride.

   I feel the sense of possibilities,
   I feel the wrench of hard realities.
   The focus is sharp in the city.

   On life's ancient tales,
   Steeped in the history of London.

   Green and grey washes

   The pride still prevails,
   Alive in the streets of the city.

   Are they oblivious
   To this quality?
   A quality
   Of light unique to
   Every city's streets.

   Pavements may teem 
   With intense energy,
   But the city is calm

   The night is black, 
   Without a moon.
   The air is thick and still.

   The vigilantes gather on
   The lonely torchlit hill.
      
 Features distorted in the flickering light,
 The faces are twisted and grotesque.
 Silent and stern in the sweltering night,
 The mob moves like demons possesed.
 Quiet in conscience, calm in their right,
 Confident their ways are best.

   The righteous rise
   With burning eyes
   Of hatred and ill-will.

   Madmen fed on fear and lies
   To beat and burn and kill.

 They say there are strangers who threaten us,
 In our immigrants and infidels.
 They say there is strangeness, too dangerous
 In our theatres and bookstore shelves,
 That those who know what's best for us
 Must rise and save us from ourselves.

   Quick to judge,
   Quick to anger,
   Slow to understand

   Ignorance and prejudice
   And fear 
   Walk hand in hand.

 Unstable condition,
 A symptom of life,
 In mental and environmental change.
 Atmospheric disturbance,
 The feverish flux
 Of human interface and interchange.

 The impulse is pure;
 Sometimes our circuits get shorted
 By external interference.
 Signals get crossed
 And the balance distorted
 By internal incoherence.

 A tired mind become a shape-shifter,
 Everybody need a mood lifter,
 Everybody need reverse polarity.
 Everybody got mixed feelings
 About the function and the form.
 Everybody got to deviate from the norm.

 An ounce of perception,
 A pound of obscure.
 Process information at half speed.
 Pause, rewind, replay,
 Warm memory chip,
 Random sample, hold the one you need.

 Leave out the fiction,
 The fact is, this friction
 Will only be worn by persistence.
 Leave out conditions,
 Courageous convictions
 Will drag the dream into existence.

 A tired mind become a shape-shifter,
 Everybody need a soft filter,
 Everybody need reverse polarity.
 Everybody got mixed feelings
 About the function and the form.
 Everybody got to elevate from the norm...

 A companion, unobtrusive

 Shatter the illusion

 There are those who think that life
 Has nothing left to chance
 With a host of holy horrors
 To direct our aimless dance

 A planet of playthings
 We dance on the strings
 Of powers we cannot perceive
 "The stars aren't aligned -
 Or the gods are malign"
 Blame is better to give than receive

 You can choose a ready guide
 In some celestial voice
 If you choose not to decide
 You cannot have made a choice

 You can choose from phantom fears
 And kindness that can kill
 I will choose a path that's clear
 I will choose Free Will

 There are those who think that
 They've been dealt a losing hand
 The cards were stacked against them-
 They weren't born in Lotus-Land

 All pre-ordained
 A prisoner in chains
 A victim of venomous fate
 Kicked in the face
 You can't pray for a place
 In Heaven's unearthly estate

 Each of us
 A cell of awareness
 Imperfect and incomplete
 Genetic blends
 With uncertain ends
 On a fortune hunt
 That's far too fleet...

 I can make you all aware"

 "I will find you food and shelter
 Show you fire to keep you warm
 Through the endless winter storm
 You can live in grace and comfort
 In the world that you transform."

 @{i}The people were delighted
 Coming forth to claim their prize
 They ran to build their cities
 And converse among the wise

 But one day the streets fell silent
 Yet they knew not what was wrong
 The urge to build these fine things
 Seemed not to be so strong

 The wise men were consulted
 And the Bridge of Death was crossed
 In quest of Dionysus
 To find out what they had lost...@{ui}

 @{b}3. Dionysus: Bringer of Love@{ub}
 -- --------  ------- -- ----
 "I bring love to give you solace
 In the darkness of the night
 In the heart's eternal light
 You need only trust your feelings
 Only love can steer you right."

 "I bring laughter, I bring music
 I bring Joy and I bring Tears
 I will soothe your primal fears
 Throw off those chains of Reason
 And your prison disappears."

 @{i}The cities were abandoned
 And the forests echoed song
 They danced and lived as brothers
 They knew love could not be wrong

 Food and wine they had aplenty
 And they slept beneath the stars
 The people were contented
 And the Gods watched from afar

 But the winter fell upon them
 And it caught them unprepared
 Bringing wolves and cold starvation
 And the hearts of men despaired...@{ui}

 @{b}4. Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind@{ub}
 -- ----------  --- ------ -- ----- --- ----
 The Universe divided
 As the Heart and Mind collided
 With our people left unguided
 For so many troubled years
 In a cloud of doubts and fears
 Our world was torn asunder
 Into hollow hemispheres

 Some fought themselves, some fought each other
 Most just followed one another
 Lost and aimless like their brothers
 For their Hearts were so unclear
 And the Truth could not appear
 Their spirits were divided
 Into blinded Hemispheres

 @{i}Some who did not fight
 Brought tales of old to light
 My "Rocinante'" sailed by night
 On her final flight

 To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force
 We set our course
 Spiralled through that timeless space
 To this immortal place@{ui}


 @{b}5. Cygnus: Bringer of Balance@{ub}
 -- ------  ------- -- -------
 @{i}I have memory and awareness
 But I have no shape or form
 As a disembodied spirit
 I am dead and yet unborn

 I have passed into Olympus
 As was told in tales of old
 To the City of Immortals
 Marble white and purest gold

 I see the Gods in battle rage on high
 Thunderbolts across the sky
 I cannot move, I cannot hide
 I feel a silent scream begin inside@{ui}

 Then all at once the Chaos ceased
 A stillness fell, a sudden peace
 The Warriors felt my silent cry
 And stayed their struggle, mystified

 Apollo was atonished
 Dionysus thought me mad
 But they heard my story further
 And they wondered, and were sad

 Looking down from Olympus
 On a world of doubt and fear
 It's surface splintered into
 Sorry hemispheres

 They sat a while in silence
 Then they turned at last to me
 "We will call you Cygnus,
 The God of Balance you shall be."

 @{b}6. The Sphere: A Kind of Dream@{ub}
 -- ----------  - ---- -- -----
 @{b}@{i}We can walk our road together
 If our goals are all the same
 We can run alone and free
 If we pursue a different aim

 Let the truth of Love be lighted
 Let the love of Truth shine clear
 Sensibility
 Armed with sense and liberty
 With the Heart and Mind united
 In a single perfect Sphere@{ub}@{ui}

 A boy alone, so far from home
 Endless rooftops from my window
 I felt the gloom of empty rooms
 On rainy afternoons

 Sometimes, in confusion
 I felt so lost and disillusioned
 Innocence gave me confidence
 To go up against reality

 There is unrest in the Forest
 There is trouble with the trees
 For the Maples want more sunlight
 And the Oaks ignore their pleas

 The trouble with the Maples
 (And they're quite convinced the're right)
 They say the Oaks are just too lofty
 And they grab up all the light
 But the Oaks can't help their feelings
 If they like the way they're made
 And they wonder why the Maples
 Can't be happy in their shade?

 There is trouble in the Forest
 And the creatures all have fled
 As the Maples scream "@{fg shine}Oppression@{fg text}"

    A modest man from Mandrake
    Travelled rich to the city
    He had a need to discover
    A use for his newly-found wealth

 Because he was human
 Because he had goodness
 Because he was moral
 They called him insane

 Delusions of grandeur
 Visions of splendour
 A manic depressive

 When the dragons grow too mighty
 To slay with pen or sword
 I grow weary of the battle
 And the storm I walk toward
 When all around is madness
 And there's no safe port in view
 I long to turn my path homeward
 To stop awhile with you

 When life becomes so barren
 And as cold as winter skies
 There's a beacon in the darkness
 In a distant pair of eyes
 In vain to search for order
 In vain to search for truth
 But these things can still be given
 Your love has shown me proof

 @{b}@{i}Book 1 - The Voyage
 Prologue@{ub}@{ui}

 In the constellation of Cygnus
 There lurks a mysterious, invisible force
 The Black Hole
 Of Cygnus X-1

 6 Stars of the Northern Cross
 In mourning for their sister's loss
 In a final flash of glory
 Nevermore to grace the night...

 @{b}1@{ub}

 Invisible
 To telescopic eye
 Infinity
 The star that would not die

 All who dare
 To cross her course
 Are swallowed by
 A fearsome force

 Through the void
 To be destroyed
 Or is there something more?
 Atomized - at the core
 Or through the Astral Door -
 To soar...

 @{b}2@{ub}

 I set a course just east of Lyra
 And northwest of Pegasus
 Flew into the light of Deneb
 Sailed across the Milky Way

 On my ship, the "@{b}@{fg shine}Rocinante@{ub}@{fg text}"
 Wheeling through the galaxies,
 Headed for the heart of Cygnus
 Headlong into mystery

 The x-ray is her siren song
 My ship cannot resist her long
 Nearer to my deadly goal
 Until the Black Hole -
 Gains control...

 @{b}3@{ub}

 Spinning, whirling,
 Still descending
 Like a spiral sea,
 Unending

 Sound and fury
 Drowns my heart
 Every nerve
 Is torn apart....

 @{b}@{i}"I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become
  one, merging into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin
  Moons, just 2 pale orbs as they trace their way across the steely sky. I
  used to think I had a pretty good life here, just plugging into my machine
  for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper in the
  evening. 
   My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric
  domes of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the
  surviving planets were banded together under the Red Star of the Solar
  Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.
   I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was
  happy. Then I found something that changed it all..."@{ub}@{ui}

   single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within!  Our
   books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the

 We've taken care of everything
 The words you read
 The songs you sing
 The pictures that give pleasure
 To your eyes
 One for all and all for one
 We work together
 Common sons
 Never need to wonder
 How or why

 We are the Priests
 Of the Temples of Syrinx
 Our great computers
 Fill the hallowed halls
 We are the Priests
 Of the Temples of Syrinx
 All the gifts of life
 Are held within our walls

 Look around this world we've made
 Equality
 Our stock in trade
 Come and join the Brotherhood

 What a nice contented world
 Let the banners
 Be unfurled
 Hold the Red Star proudly
 High in hand

   @{b}@{i}... "Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden
   beneath the cave, I found it.  I brushed away the dust of the years, and
   picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands.  I had no idea what it
   might be, but it was beautiful" ...
   ... "I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys
   to make them sound differently.  As I struck the wires with my other
   hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music!  How
   different it could be from the music of the Temples!  I can't wait to
   tell the priests about it! ..."@{ub}@{ui}

 What can this strange device be?
 When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
 It's got wires that vibrate and give music
 What can this thing be that I've found?

 See how it sings like a sad heart
 And joyously screams out its pain
 Chords that build high like a mountain
 Or notes that fall gently, like rain

 I can't wait to share this new wonder
 The people will all see its light
 Let them all make their own music
 The Priests praise my name on this night

   @{b}@{i}... "In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle
   of grim, expressionless faces.  Father Brown rose to his feet, and his
   somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall." ...
   ... "Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of
   quiet rejection!  Instead of praise, sullen dismissal.  I watched in shock
   and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters
   beneath his feet..."@{ub}@{ui}

 I know it's most unusual
 To come before you so
 But I've found an ancient miracle
 I thought that you should know
 Listen to my music

 There's something here as strong as life
 I know that it will reach you

 Yes, we know
 It's nothing new
 It's just a waste of time
 We have no need for ancient ways

 It doesn't fit the plan

 I can't believe you're saying

 Just think what we might do

 I know that it will reach you

   Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the
   summit of the staircase" ...
   ... "I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the
   pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world.  I was
   overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely
   different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the Federation long
   ago.  I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all
   these things ..."@{ub}@{ui}

 I wandered home though silent streets
 And fell into a fitful sleep
 Escape to realms beyond the night
 Dream - can't you show me the light?

 I stand atop a spiral stair
 An oracle confronts me there
 He leads me on, light years away
 Through astral nights, galactic days

 I see the works of gifted hands
 That grace this strange and wondrous land
 I see the hand of man arise
 With hungry mind and open eyes

 They left our planet long ago
 The elder race still learn and grow
 Their power grows with purpose strong
 To claim the home, where they belong
 Home, to tear the Temples down...
 Home, to change...

 @{b}6@{ub}. @{i}Soliloquy@{ui}

   @{b}@{i}... "I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge
   in my total despair.  I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me
   now.  I can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there
   is no other place to go.  My last hope is that with my death I may pass
   into the world of my dream, and know peace at last."@{ub}@{ui}

 The sleep is still in my eyes
 The dream is still in my head
 I heave a sigh, and sadly smile
 And lie a while in bed

 I wish that it might come to pass
 Not fade like all my dreams
 Just think of what my life might be
 In a world like I have seen

 I don't think I can carry on
 Carry on this cold and empty life
 Oh...noo.
 My spirits are low, in the depths of despair
 My lifeblood
 Spills over..

 (Chorus)

 You don't get something for nothing
 You don't get freedom for free
 You won't get wise
 With the sleep still in your eyes
 No matter what your dreams might be

 Waiting for someone to call
 And turn your world around
 Looking for an answer to
 The question you have found
 Looking for
 An open door

 (Chorus)

 What you own is your own kingdom
 What you do is your own glory
 What you love is your own power
 What you live is your own story
 In your head is the answer
 Let it guide you along
 Let your heart be the anchor
 And the beat of your own song

 Ooh, there's no bread let 'em eat cake
 There's no end to what they'll take
 Flaunt the fruits of noble birth
 Wash the salt into the earth

 But they're marching to Bastille Day
 La guillotine will claim her bloody prize
 Free the dungeons of the innocent
 The king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise

 Ooh, blood stained velvet, dirty lace
 Naked fear on every face
 See them bow their heads to die
 As we would bow as they rode by

 And we're marching to Bastille Day
 La guillotine will claim her bloody prize
 Sing, oh choirs of cacophony
 The king has kneeled, to let his kingdom rise

 Lessons taught, but never learned
 All around us anger burns
 Guide the future by the past
 Long ago the mould was cast

 For they marched up to Bastille Day
 La guillotine - claimed her bloody prize
 Hear the echoes of the centuries
 Power isn't all that money buys

 I looked in the mirror today
 My eyes just didn't seem so bright
 I've lost a few more hairs
 I think I'm going bald
 I think I'm going bald
 Seems like only yesterday
 We would sit and talk of dreams all night
 Dreams of youth
 And simple truths
 Now we're all so involved
 So involved with life

 Walk down vanity fair
 Memory lane everywhere
 Wall Stree shuffles there
 Dressed in flowing hair

 Once we loved the flowers
 Now we ask the price of the land
 Once we would take water
 But now it must be wine.
 Now we've been
 And now we've seen
 What price peace of mind
 Take a piece of my mind

 My life is slipping away
 I'm aging every day
 But even when I'm grey
 I'll still be grey my way

 Midway hawkers calling "Try your luck with me."
 Merry-go-round wheezing
 Same old melody
 A thousand 10-cent wonders
 Who could ask for more
 A pocketful of silver
 The key to heaven's door

 Lakeside Park
 Willows in the breeze
 Lakeside Park
 So many memories
 Laughing rides
 Midway lights
 Shining stars on summer nights

 Days of barefoot freedom
 Racing with the waves
 Nights of starlit secrets
 Crackling driftwood flames
 Drinking by the lighthouse
 Smoking on the pier
 Still we saw the magic
 Was fading every year

 Everyone would gather
 On the 24th of May
 Sitting in the sand
 To watch the fireworks display
 Dancing fires on the beach
 Singing songs together
 Though it's just a memory
 Some memories last forever

 1. Into Darkness

 @{b}@{fg shadow}As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, the 3 travelers, men of
 Willow Dale, emerge from the forest shadow. Fording the River Dawn, they
 turn south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the
 Necromancer.  Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt,
 weakening the body and saddening the heart.  Ultimately they will become
 empty, mindless spectres, stripped of will and soul.  Only their thirst for
 freedom gives them hunger for vengeance...@{ub}@{fg text}

  Silence shrouds the forest
  As the birds announce the dawn
  3 travellers ford the river
  And southward journey on
  The road is lined with peril
  And the air is charged with fear
  The shadow of his nearness
  Weighs like iron tears

 2. Under the Shadow

 @{b}@{fg shadow}Shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies, the Necromancer keeps watch
 with his magic prism eyes.  He views all his lands and is already aware of
 the 3 helpless invaders trapped in his lair...@{ub}@{fg text}

  Brooding in the tower
  Watching over his land
  Holding every creature
  Helplessly they stand

  Gaze into his prisms
  Knowing they are near
  Lead them to the dungeons
  Spectres numb with fear
  They bow defeated

 3. Return of the Prince

 @{b}@{fg shadow}Enter the Champion.
 Prince By-Tor appears to battle for freedom from chains of long years.
 The spell has been broken...the Dark Lands are bright, the Wraith of the
 Necromancer soars away...in the night.@{ub}@{fg text}

  Stealthily attacking
  By-Tor slays his foe
  The men are free to run now
  From labyrinths below
  Wraith of the Necromancer
  Shadows through the sky
  Another land to darken
  With evil prism eye

 1. In the Valley

 I am born
 I am me
 I am new
 I am free

 Look at me
 I am young
 Sight unseen
 Life unsung

 My eyes have just been opened
 And they're open very wide
 Images around me
 Don't identify inside

 Just one blur I recognize
 The one that soothes and feeds
 My way of life is easy
 And as simple are my needs

 Yet my eyes are drawn toward
 The mountain in the east
 Fascinates and captivates
 Gives my heart no peace

 The mountain holds the sunrise
 In the prison of the night
 Till bursting forth from rocky chains
 The valley floods with light

 Living one long sunrise
 For to me all things are new
 I've never watched the sky grow
 Pale, or strolled through fields of dew

 I do not know of dust to dust
 I live from breath to breath
 I live to climb that mountain
 To the Fountain of Lamneth

 Crying back to consciousness
 The coldness grips my skin
 The sky is pitching violently
 And drawn by shrieking winds
 
 Seaspray blurs my vision
 Waves roll by so fast
 Save my ship of freedom
 I'm lashed, helpless, to the mast
 
 Remembering when first I held
 The wheel in my own hands
 I took the helm so eagerly
 And sailed for distant lands
 
 But now the sea's too heavy
 And I just don't understand
 Why must my crew desert me
 When I need a guiding hand
 
 Call out for direction
 And there's no one there to steer
 Shout out for salvation
 But there's no one there to hear
 
 Cry out supplication
 For the maelstrom is near
 Scream out desperation
 But no one cares to hear

 The whiteness of confusion
 Is unfolding from my mind
 I stare around in wonder
 Have I left my life behind

 I catch the scent of ambergris
 And turn my head...surprised
 My gaze is caught and held
 And I am helpless, mesmerized

 Panacea - liquid grace
 Oh, let me touch your gentle face
 Enchantment falls around me
 And I know I cannot leave

 Here's a meaning for my life
 A shelter from the storm
 Pacify my troubles with
 Her body soft and warm

 Naked in our unity
 A smile for every tear
 Gentle hands that promise me
 Comfort through the years

 Yet I know I must be gone
 Before the light of dawn

 Panacea - passion pure
 I can't resist your gentle lure
 My heart will lie beside you
 And my wandering body grieve

 Another endless day
 Silhouettes of grey
 Another glass of wine
 Drink with eyes that shine

 To days without that chill at morning
 Long nights time out of mind

 Draw another goblet
 From the cask of 43
 Crimson, misty memory
 Hazy glimpse of me

 Give me back my wonder
 - I've something more to give
 I guess it doesn't matter
 - There's not much more to
 not much more to live

 Another foggy dawn
 The mountain almost gone
 Another doubtful fear
 The road is not so clear
 My soul grows ever weary and...
 The end is ever near

 Look...the mist is rising
 And the sun is peaking through
 See, the steps grow lighter
 As I reach their final few
 Hear, the dancing waters
 I must be drawing near
 Feel, my heart is pounding
 With embattled hope and fear
 
 Now at last I fall before
 The Fountain of Lamneth
 I thought I would be singing
 but I'm tired...out of breath
 Many journeys end here
 But, the secret's told the same
 Life is just a candle
 And a dream must give it flame
 
 The key, the end, the answer
 Stripped of their disguise
 Still it's all confusion
 And tears spring to my eyes.
 Though I've reached a signpost
 It's really not the end
 Like Old Sol' behind the mountain
 I'll be coming up again...
 
 I'm in motion
 I am still
 I am crying
 I am still
 I'm together
 I'm apart
 I'm forever
 At the start
 Still...I am

 Know your place in life
 Is where you want to be
 Don't let them tell you
 That you owe it all to me
 Keep on looking forward
 No use in looking 'round
 Hold your head above the ground
 And they won't bring you down
 
 Anthem of the heart
 And anthem of the mind
 A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
 We marvel after those who sought
 New wonders in the world
 Wonders in the world
 Wonders in the world they wrought
 
 Live for yourself
 There's no one else
 More worth living for
 Begging hands and bleeding hearts will
 Only cry out for more
 
 Well, I know they've always told you
 Selfishness was wrong
 Yet it was for me
 Not you
 I came to write this song

 I've got a livin' that's rough
 A future that's tough
 You know what I mean
 Blankers and boasters
 All the bluffers and posers
 I'm not into that scene

 You can tell me
 That I got no class
 Look around you'll see
 Who's laughin' last
 Don't give me speeches
 'cause they're oh so droll
 Leave me alone
 Let me rock and roll

 Got an itchin' to rock
 A hate for small talk
 I'm funny that way
 Got my sights on the stars
 Won't get that far
 But I'll try anyway
 I just like to please
 Don't like to tease
 I'm easy like that
 Don't like long rests
 I must confess
 I'm an impatient cat

 I do the best that I can
 I'm just what I am
 I do the best I can
 Well, I know what I am

 Rock and roll-in's a scream
 Makin' millions my dream
 Well, I do that a lot
 I'll just give it a try
 Won't let good times pass me by
 They're all I've got

 10 score years ago
 Defeat the kingly foe
 A wondrous dream came into being
 Tame the trackless waste
 No virgin land left chaste
 All shining eyes
 But never seeing

 Beneath the noble birth
 Between the proudest words
 Behind the beauty
 Cracks appear
 Once, with heads held high
 They sang out to the sky
 Why do their shadows bow in fear?

 Watch the cities rise
 Another ship arrives
 Earth's melting pot and ever growing
 Fantastic dreams come true
 Inventing something new
 The greatest minds
 And never knowing...

 The guns replace the plow
 Facades are tarnished now
 The principles have been betrayed
 The dreams gone stale
 But still, let hope prevail
 History's debt won't be repaid

 The Tobes of Hades
 Lit by flickering torchlight
 The netherworld is gathered in the glare
 Prince By-Tor takes the cavern to the north light
 The sign of Eth is rising in the air
 By-Tor, knight of darkness
 Centurion of evil
 Devil's prince

 Across the River Styx
 Out of the lamplight
 His nemesis is waiting at the gate
 The Snow Dog
 Ermine glowing in the damp night
 Coal-black eyes
 Shimmering with hate
 By-Tor and the Snow Dog
 Square for battle
 Let the fray begin

 The battle's over
 And the dust is clearing
 Disciples of the Snow Dog
 Sound the knell
 Rejoicing echoes
 As the dawn is nearing
 By-Tor in defeat
 Retreats to Hell
 Snow Dog is victorious
 The land of the Overworld
 Is saved again

 Airport scurry flurry faces
 Parade of passers by
 People going many places
 With a smile or just a sigh
 Waiting waiting pass the time
 Another cigarette
 Get in line - gate 39
 The time is not here yet
 
 Why try?
 I know why
 The feeling inside me
 Says it's time I was gone
 Clear head
 New life ahead
 I want to be king now
 Not just one more pawn
 
 Fly by night
 Away from here
 Change my life again
 Fly by night
 Goodbye my dear
 My ship isn't coming
 And I just can't pretend
 
 Moon rise
 Thoughtful eyes
 Staring back at me
 From the window beside
 No fright or hindsight
 Leaving behind
 That empty feeling inside
 
 Start a new chapter
 Find what I'm after
 It's changing every day
 The change of a season
 Is enough of a reason
 To want to get away
 
 Quiet and pensive
 My thoughts apprehensive
 The hours drift away
 Leaving my homeland
 Playing a lone hand
 My life begins today

 There's a time for feelin'
 As good as we can
 The time is now
 And there's no stoppin' us
 There's a time for livin'
 As high as we can
 Behind us
 You will only see our dust

 You know we're havin' good days
 And we hope they're gonna last
 Our future still looks brighter than our past
 We feel no need to worry
 No reason to be sad
 Our memories remind us
 Maybe road life's not so bad

 Just keep smilin'
 Move onward every day
 And try to keep our thoughts away from home
 We're travelin' around
 No time to settle down
 And satisfy our wanderlust to roam

 Well from sea to shining sea
 And a hundred points between
 Still we go on diggin' every show
 The cities in the land
 All extend a welcome hand
 Till morning when it's time for us to go

 Sunlight dances
 Through the leaves
 Soft winds stir
 The sighing trees
 Lying in the warm grass
 Feel the sun upon your face
 Elfin songs
 And endless nights
 Sweet wine
 And soft relaxing lights
 Time will never touch you
 Here in this enchanted place

 You feel there's something calling you
 You're wanting to return
 To where the misty mountains rise
 And friendly fires burn
 A place you can escape the world
 Where the dark lord cannot go
 Peace of mind
 And sanctuary
 By loud water's flow

 I've traveled now
 For many miles
 It feels so good to see the smiles
 Of Friends who never left your mind
 When you were far away
 From the golden light
 Of coming dawn
 Till the twilight
 Where the sun is gone
 We treasure every season
 And every passing day

 We feel the coming of a new day
 Darkness gives way to light a new way
 Stop here for a while until the world
 The world calls you away
 Yet you know I've had the feeling
 Standing with my senses reeling
 This is the place to grow old till
 I reach my final day

 You can make me smile in the end

 Well, I can do what you do
 You just do it better
 And I can cry like you cry
 It just makes me sadder

 Well, I can shine like you shine
 It doesn't make me brighter
 But if I think like you think

 This Amiga Guide is about 4 years or more in the making.  I was heavily
invovled with it & many people were expecting to see it on AmiNet a long time
ago.  I'm sorry it has taken this long.  Many things have changed in my life
just as for anyone else.  I haven't edited this text in over a year but have
recently start modifying it. :D

 I plan to include some graphics as well as Sound samples.  So I intend to add a
History to this.  I've considered making it into HTML so it could be read by all
computer users but I'm pretty dedicated to the Amiga & it started out as an
Amiga ONLY project.  So I'm not sure yet, for now, Amiga Guide only.  Perhaps if
I get enough Email from this in a possitive direction I'll make an HTML
version.

 I've been a MASSIVE RUSH Fanatic for Years!  Actually, ever since 1974 which;
amazingly enough (Ahhhhh...WOW!) is when the trio started...commercially anyway.
;)  They are to ME then *BEST* Rock'N'Roll group ever!  I know the Stones, &
AC/DC & Led Zeppelin are huge, too & have a pretty loyal following & I won't
knock any of them because I like them a LOT, too, but RUSH is...the Pinical of
Music to me.  All of this & I consider them to be HUMAN being with Incrediable
Talent & not some kind of Gods.  Afterall, people ARE people...you know?


 RUSH is the only Group that has captured my Mind & Feelings in such a special
way.  As soon as I hear a Note from ANY song I KNOW it's them.  They are VERY
Unique.  I must admit, though, I'm SOOOOOoooooOOoooOoo tired of Tom Sawyer,
...I'm not going to go into a Major (Where's my) Thing about it though.  SO,
flame ME if you must... I'll reply with, "You know, they have OTHER Much BETTER
songs.  Have you Truely explored the well over 50 songs?"

 Me?  Well, I'm a HUGE fan of the Amiga... A500 (x2), A1000, A2000, A4000. I
have LONG dark brown salty hair (didn't use to have the Salt in it, hehe..) also
love collecting MAX HEADROOM stuff.  My other music interests consist of AC/DC,
Pink Floyd, Dio, The Art Of Noise, Megadeth, (Older) MetallicA (I cannot stand
Re/Load), Van Halen, & TONS of 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s & earlier 90s music.



 Okay, I think that wraps it up for now.  I'll add to this later.  See you
online. :)  RUSH Rocks, RUSH Rules!  The 3 Stooges on Stage!
