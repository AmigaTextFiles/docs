Introduction
------------

What is MPEG audio ?

It's a very efficient audio compression standard. Actually, there is 3
compression methods, named layer I, II & III. Layer III is more efficient
than layer II, witch is more efficient than layer I. But, more efficient
means more complex. For this reasons, Layer III is not implemented yet.
MPEG audio allows to compress a 16-bits PCM sound file from 1.2 to
32 times.

Why is it so hard to make a real time MPEG audio decoder ?

MPEG audio decoding requires a lot of arithmetic calculation, so a lot of CPU
power is required. Normally, MPEG audio decoding is made with help of a DSP.


History

V1.0	23-Jun-1995	First aminet release

Description
-----------

You need at least a 68020 CPU to use it !

This is an highly optimized MPEG audio decoder. This one can decode MPEG audio
standard streams, layer I & II. The output can be either a raw PCM file, an AIFF
file or AMIGA-built in audio device. The output samples can be 16 or 8 bits wide
(for audio 16 bits are reduced to 14 bits, due to hardware limitations).

Some results:

on my A1200/GVPTurboI 68030/40MHz/4Mo Fast RAM,
SCSI Hard drives with Squirrel interface:

Bitstream parameters field is <layer>/<bitrate>/<sfreq>/<mode>
<bitrate> is in kbits/sec
<sfreq> is in kHz
<mode> are M:mono (=single channel), S:stereo, J:joint-stereo, D:dual-channel

Options are the options that follows the mpega command
Decoding output was always a ram file.
