@node Introduction "FastView: Introduction"

FastView is a program which shows IFF/GIF pictures on your screen.
Ofcourse many programs exist for this task, but this one is special
because it is very fast and was designed with both OCS/ECS and AGA
users in mind.  For example:  FastView can show HAM8 and IFF24Bit
pictures on OCS/ECS machines in HAM which was one of the things I
missed in all the other viewing-programs I've seen.

@node Features "FastView: Features"

 - Displays any IFF ILBM picture (even HAM8 or 24Bit pictures) in HAM on
   OCS/ECS machines.  Ofcourse if the picture doesn't need to be rerendered
   in HAM it will use a normal OCS/ECS screenmode.  On AGA machines FastView
   will show the pictures if possible in upto 256 colors or in HAM8.

 - Displays GIF pictures of 17 or more colors in HAM on OCS/ECS machines.
   If less colors are used HIRES-INTERLACED will be used.  On AGA machines
   GIFs always get displayed in upto 256 colors.

 - Optional Dithering of rerendered pictures (ie. pictures which are
   converted from 256 colors to HAM, or from 24Bit to HAM8 etc...)

 - If multiple pictures were specified on the commandline FastView will
   automatically load and decode the next picture while you're still
   viewing the previous one

 - Optional (Down)Scaling of rerendered pictures to fit screen 

 - On OCS/ECS machines FastView tries to recognize pictures with B&W palettes
   and will display these in HIRES-INTERLACED instead of HAM

 - Smart color-selection when rerendering pictures to HAM

 - Very fast conversion to HAM/HAM8

 - Very fast C2P routines (copied from TextDemo :-))

 - Uses asynchronous I/O (loading and decoding at the same time)

 - Keyboard can be used to scroll picture (or the mouse ofcourse)

 - Coded in 100% Assembler

@node Requirements "FastView: System requirements"

FastView should run on any 68020+ Amiga system with at least 512K RAM and
one disk-drive.  FastView requires KickStart V2.04 or higher to run.

FastView is KickStart 3.0 compatible and aware.  It will use some V39
functions when available.

Should you have any trouble running FastView on your machine, please
@{" contact me " link About} with the full specifications of your machine,
that is KickStart version, model, expansion boards etc...

@node About "FastView: About the author and the program"

FastView has been created using the Devpac Assembler and CygnusED on a Amiga
2000 with a 68030/22 and 7 MB of memory.

If you have suggestions or remarks about this program, or if you find any
bugs, please let me know.

When sending in bug reports, please state exactly under what circumstances
the bug occurred, what equipment was used and what happened.  If possible
also try to give me enough information to reproduce the bug.  It is very
difficult to find bugs when you don't know exactly what happened.

@node Usage "FastView: Usage"

There is nothing to it really.  Just run it from the CLI or install
it in your favourite Directory utility.

Commandline:

 FILES/M/A,DITHER/S,NOINTERLACE/S,SCALE/S,DELAY/K/N


FILES/M/A
 
This argument is required, you'll need to specify atleast one picture to
run FastView.  You can use AmigaDOS wildcards to make viewing multiple
pictures easier.  You can add as many names/wildcards on the commandline
as you want, and all pictures will be viewed in the order you specified.
(Note: wildcards matching multiple pictures will be shown in a somewhat
random order)  In case you're viewing multiple pictures the Right Mouse
button will act as an abort-function, thus it will enable you to exit
FastView completely at any time.  LeftMouse button will continue to the
next picture.


DELAY/K/N

Using this option you can turn FastView into a slideshow.  It allows you
to set the number of seconds each picture will be displayed.  Note that
FastView will automatically load the next picture in the background while
you're still viewing the current picture, which makes slideshows look
much better.


DITHER/S

Specify this on the commandline if you want to add a simple form of
dithering to the (rerendered) pictures.  This will slow-down FastView by
about 50%.


NOINTERLACE/S

Specify this to make sure FastView doesn't use interlaced displays.


SCALE/S

When you specify this on the commandline FastView will down-scale
(rerendered) pictures so they will fit on your screen, while keeping the
aspect ratio intact.


Keys while viewing pictures:

 Arrow keys or the Numeric Keypad can be used to scroll the screen

 Holding shift while scrolling will use larger steps
 Holding alt while scrolling scrolls one pixel at the time

 Space, Enter  - Skip to next picture
 Escape        - Exit FastView completely

@node History "FastView: History"

Aug 20 1994 - V0.90 - Added GIF decoding
Aug 24 1994 - V0.91 - Speeded up HAM conversion routine by almost 20%;
                      Speeded GIF conversion by about 5%; LMB now also
                      exits the viewer when displaying a GIF
Aug 25 1994 - V0.92 - Handles interlaced GIFs; Uses LoRes HAM if picture
                      is smaller than 320x256; Displays B&W pictures in
                      Hires 16 colors instead of HAM
Aug 26 1994 - V0.93 - Almost doubled IFF displaying speed thanks to the
                      BackFill-Hooks (Other picture types will also
                      benefit from this)
Aug 27 1994 - V0.94 - Displays uncompressed IFFs
Aug 31 1994 - V0.95 - Finally figured out how to convert HAM8 to 24Bit
                      (it turned out IFF-HAM8 has its control-bits as
                      bit 6 and 7...); Added Dithering for pictures
                      which are converted to HAM or B&W
              V0.96 - Now outputs info about the picture; Possible to
                      specify multiple pictures on commandline and RMB
                      now exits completely when viewing multiple
                      pictures; Uses BusyPtr while decoding; Blanks
                      mouse after decoding
              V0.97 - Added IFF 24bit decoding using fixed HAM palette;
                      Also added NOINTERLACE commandline option
Sep  5 1994 - V0.98 - Added variable (Down)Scaling; Now centers picture
                      if it is too small (this avoids the trash at the
                      right-edge due to Hardware limitations)
Sep  8 1994 - V0.99 - No longer crashes when a BadCode is encountered
                      in a GIF file
Sep 16 1994 - V0.99 - Fixed color-selecting algorithm -- it now does
                      very good color-selecting
Sep 17 1994 - V1.00 - Added AGA support (hopefully) and made it Kick2.04
                      compatible

 - First Release - (let the bug-reports roll in ;-(( )

Sep 18 1994 - V1.01 - Added intelligent ViewMode selection if CAMG chunk
                      is missing from an IFF file
Sep 19 1994 - V1.02 - Fixed small bug which caused uncompressed HAM8
                      pictures not to be displayed
Sep 20 1994 - V1.03 - Fixed problem with IFF pictures which weren't
                      exactly the same width as the screen; Added
                      rendering to HAM8 for AGA machines
Sep 25 1994 - V1.04 - Fixed Enforcer hit when no palette was found in
                      picture; Added Wildcard support
Sep 29 1994 - V1.05 - Fixed LoadRGB4 code; Fixed bugs in Wildcard
                      support which caused memory freed twice errors;
                      Fixed HAM8 support
Oct  3 1994 - V1.06 - Added simple local-colormap handling code to GIF
                      decoder; When initial codesize was too small or
                      too big GIF decoder crashed, bug fixed
Oct  4 1994 - V1.07 - Added Delay keyword; Added keyboard support while
                      viewing/decoding picture
Oct 12 1994 - V1.08 - FastView now automatically loads and decodes the next
                      picture in the background for nicer slideshows and
                      faster viewing; Fixed small bugs which caused
                      small uncompressed IFF files to be displayed
                      incorrectly
Oct 14 1994 - V1.09 - Finally IFF24->HAM8 works; Removed some more bugs
