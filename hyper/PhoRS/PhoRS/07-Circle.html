This month, we introduce the traction budget.  This is a way of thinking about
the traction available for car control under various conditions.  It can help you
make decisions about driving style, the right line around a course, and diagnosing
handling problems.  We introduce a diagramming technique for visualizing the
traction budget and combine this with a 
well-known visualization tool, the ``circle of traction,'' also known as the
circle of friction.  So this month's article is about tools, conceptual and visual, for
thinking about some aspects of the physics of racing.
<P>
To introduce the traction budget, we first need to visualize a tire in contact with
the ground.  Figure 1 <A HREF=#xrayvision><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows how the bottom surface of a tire might
look if we could see that surface by looking down from above.  In other words, this
figure shows an imaginary ``X-ray'' view of the bottom surface of a tire.  
For the rest of the discussion, we will always imagine that we view
the tire this way.  From this point of view, ``up'' on the diagram corresponds to
forward forces and motion of the tire and the car, ``down'' corresponds to
backward forces and motion, ``left'' corresponds to leftward forces
and motion, and ``right'' on the diagram corresponds to rightward forces and
motion.
<P>

``X-ray vision.''</a><br><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="xray.gif">
<P>
The figure shows a shaded, elliptical region, where the tire presses
against the ground.  All the interaction between the tire and the ground
takes place in this <em>contact patch</em>: that part of the 
tire that touches the ground.  As the tire rolls, one bunch of tire molecules
after another move into the contact patch.  But the patch itself more-or-less
keeps the same shape, size, and position relative to the axis of
rotation of the tire and the car as a whole.  We can use this fact 
to develop a simplified view of the interaction between tire and ground.  This 
simplified view lets us quickly and easily do approximate calculations
good within a few percent.  
(A full-blown, mathematical analysis requires tire coordinates
that roll with the tire, ground coordinates fixed on the ground, car
coordinates fixed to the car, and many complicated equations relating these
coordinate systems; the last few percent of accuracy in a mathematical model of
tire-ground interaction involves a great deal more complexity.)
<P>
You will recall that forces on the tire from the
ground are required to make a car change either its speed of motion or its
direction of motion.  Thinking of the X-ray vision picture, forces pointing up are
required to make the car accelerate, forces pointing down are required to make it
brake, and forces pointing right and left are required to make the car turn. 
Consider forward acceleration, for a moment.  The engine applies a torque to the
axle.  This torque becomes a force, pointing backwards (down, on the diagram), that
the tire applies to the ground.  By Newton's third law, the ground applies an equal
and opposite force, therefore pointing forward (up), on the contact patch.  This
force is transmitted back to the car, accelerating it forward.  It is easy to get
confused with all this backward and forward action and reaction.  Remember to
think only about the forces on the tire and to ignore the forces on the ground,
which point the opposite way.
<P>
You will also recall that a tire has a limited ability to stick to the ground.  Apply a
force that is too large, and the tire slides.  The maximum force that a tire can
take depends on the weight applied to the tire: 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap72.xbm">
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap84.xbm"> is the force on the tire, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap86.xbm"> is the coefficient
of adhesion (and depends on tire compound, ground characteristics, temperature,
humidity, phase of the moon, <em>etc.</em>), and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap88.xbm"> is the weight or load on the tire.
<P>
By Newton's second law, the weight on the tire depends on the fraction of the car's
mass that the tire must support
and the acceleration of gravity, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap90.xbm">.  The fraction of
the car's mass that the tire must support depends on geometrical
factors such as the wheelbase and the height of the center of gravity.  
It also depends on the acceleration of the car, which completely accounts for
weight transfer.
<P>
It is critical to separate the geometrical, or <em>kinematic</em>, aspects of weight
transfer from the mass of the car.  Imagine two cars with the same geometry
but different masses (weights).  In a one <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap94.xbm"> braking maneuver, the same <em>fraction</em> of each car's total weight will be transferred to the front.  In the example
of Part 1 of this series, we calculated a 20%weight transfer during one <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap94.xbm">
braking because the height of the CG was 20%of the wheelbase.  This
weight transfer will be the same 20%in a 3500 pound, stock Corvette as in a
2200 pound, tube-frame, Trans-Am Corvette so long as the geometry (wheelbase,
CG height, <em>etc.</em>) of the two cars is the same.  Although  the actual weight, in pounds,
will be different in the two cases, the fractions of the cars' total weight will be
equal.
<P>
Separating kinematics from mass, then, we have for the weight
 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap73.xbm">
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> is the fraction of the car's mass the tire must support and also
accounts for weight transfer, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> is the car's mass, 
and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap94.xbm"> is the acceleration of gravity.
<P>
Finally, by Newton's second law again, the acceleration of the tire due to the
force <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap84.xbm"> applied to it is
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap74.xbm">
We can now combine the expressions above to discover a fascinating fact:
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap75.xbm"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap76.xbm">
The maximum acceleration a tire can take is <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap104.xbm">, a constant,
independent of the mass of the car!  
While the maximum <em>force</em> a tire can take depends very much on the
current vertical load or weight on the tire, the acceleration of that tire does not
depend on the current weight.  If a tire can take one <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap94.xbm"> before sliding, 
it can take it on a lightweight car as well as on a heavy car, and it can take
it under load as well as when lightly loaded.  We hinted at this fact in Part 2, but 
the analysis above hopefully gives some deeper insight into it.  We
note that <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap108.xbm"> being constant
is only approximately true, because <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap86.xbm"> changes slightly as tire
load varies, but this is a second-order effect (covered in a later article).
<P>
So, in an approximate way, we can consider the available acceleration from 
a tire independently of details of weight transfer.  The tire will give you so many 
gees and that's that.  This is the essential idea of the traction budget.  What
you do with your budget is your affair.  If you have a tire that will give you one 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap94.xbm">, you can use it for accelerating, braking, cornering, or some combination, but
you cannot use more than your budget or you will slide.  The front-back component
of the budget measures accelerating and braking, and the right-left component
measures cornering acceleration.  The front-back component, call it <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap114.xbm">,
combines with the left-right component, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap116.xbm">, not by adding, but by the
Pythagorean formula:
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8602_tex2html_wrap77.xbm">
<P>
Rather than trying to deal with this formula, there is a convenient, visual
representation of the traction budget in the <em>circle of traction</em>.  Figure 2
<A HREF=#basiccircle><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows the circle.  It is oriented in the same way as the X-ray
view of the contact patch, Figure 1 <A HREF=#xrayvision><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, so that up is forward and right
is rightward.  The circular boundary represents the limits of the traction budget,
and every point inside the circle represents a particular choice of how you spend
your budget.  A point near the top of the circle represents pure, forward
acceleration, a point near the bottom represents pure braking.  A point near the
right boundary, with no up or down component, represents pure rightward
cornering acceleration.  Other points represent Pythagorean combinations of
cornering and forward or backward acceleration.
<P>
The beauty of this representation is that the effects of weight transfer are
factored out.  So the circle remains approximately the same no matter what the
load on a tire.
<P>
<a name="basiccircle">The Circle of Traction.</a><br><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="circle.gif">
<P>
In racing, of course, we try to spend our budget so as to stay as close to the limit,
<em>i.e. </em>, the circular boundary, as possible.  In street driving, we try to stay well inside
the limit so that we have lots of traction available to react to unforeseen
circumstances.
<P>
I have emphasized that the circle is only an approximate representation of the
truth.  It is probably close enough to make a computer driving simulation that
feels right (I'm pretty sure that ``Hard Drivin' '' and other such games use it).  As
mentioned, tire loads do cause slight, dynamic variations.  Car characteristics also
give rise to variations.  Imagine a car with slippery tires in the back and sticky
tires in the front.  Such a car will tend to oversteer by sliding.  Its traction budget
will not look like a circle.  Figure 3 <A HREF=#combined><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> gives an indication of what the
traction budget for the whole car might look like (we have been discussing the
budget of a single tire up to this point, but the same notions apply to the
whole car).  In Figure 3 <A HREF=#combined><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, there is a large traction circle for the sticky
front tires and a small circle for the slippery rear tires.  Under acceleration, the
slippery rears dominate the combined traction budget because of weight transfer. 
Under braking, the sticky fronts dominate.  The combined traction budget looks
something like an egg, flattened at top and wide in the middle.  Under braking, the
traction available for cornering is considerably greater than the traction available
during acceleration because the sticky fronts are working.  So, although this poorly
handling car tends to oversteer by sliding the rear, it also tends to understeer
during acceleration because the slippery rears will not follow the steering front
tires very effectively.

The traction budget is a versatile and simple technique for analyzing and 
visualizing car handling.  The same technique can be applied to developing driver's
skills, planning the line around a course, and diagnosing handling problems.
