In the last two articles, we plunged right into some relatively 
complex issues, namely weight transfer and tire adhesion.  This 
month, we regroup and review some of the basic units and 
dimensions needed to do dynamical calculations.  Eventually, we 
can work up to equations sufficient for a full-blown computer 
simulation of car dynamics.  The equations can then be `doctored' 
so that the computer simulation will run fast enough to be the 
core of an autocross computer game.  Eventually, we might direct 
this series of articles to show how to build such a game in a 
typical microcomputer programming language such as C or BASIC, or 
perhaps even my personal favorite, LISP.  All of this is in 
keeping with the spirit of the series, the Physics of Racing, 
because so much of physics today involves computing.  Software 
design and programming are essential skills of the modern 
physicist, so much so that many of us become involved in computing 
full time.
<P>
	Physics is the science of measurement.  Perhaps you have heard 
of highly abstract branches of physics such as quantum mechanics 
and relativity, in which exotic mathematics is in the forefront.  
But when theories are taken to the laboratory (or the race course) 
for testing, all the mathematics must boil down to quantities that 
can be measured.  In racing, the fundamental quantities are 
distance, time, and mass.  This month, we will review basic 
equations that will enable you to do quick calculations in your 
head while cooling off between runs.  It is very valuable to 
develop a skill for estimating quantities quickly, and I will show 
you how.
<P>
	Equations that don't involve mass are called <em>kinematic</em>.  The 
first kinematic equation relates speed, time, and distance.  If a 
car is moving at a constant speed or velocity, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap111.xbm">, then the 
distance <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap113.xbm"> it travels in time <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap115.xbm"> is
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap95.xbm">
or velocity times time.  This equation really expresses nothing 
more than the definition of velocity.
<P>
	If we are to do mental calculations, the first hurdle we must 
jump comes from the fact that we usually measure speed in miles 
per hour (mph), but distance in feet and time in seconds.  So, we 
must modify our equation with a conversion factor, like this
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap96.xbm">
<P>
If you ``cancel out'' the units parts of this equation, you will see 
that you get feet on both the left and right hand sides, as is 
appropriate, since equality is required of any equation.  The 
conversion factor is 5280/3600, which happens to equal 22/15.  
Let's do a few quick examples.  How far does a car go in one 
second (remember, say, ``one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand,'' 
<em>etc.</em> to yourself to count off seconds)?  At fifteen mph, we can see 
that we go
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap97.xbm">
or about 1 and a half car lengths for a 14 and 2/3 foot car like a 
late-model Corvette.  So, at 30 mph, a second is three car lengths 
and at 60 mph it is six.  If you lose an autocross by 1 second 
(and you'll be pretty good if you can do that with all the good 
drivers in our region), you're losing by somewhere between 3 and 6 
car lengths!  This is because the average speed in an autocross is 
between 30 and 60 mph.
<P>
	Everytime you plow a little or get a little sideways, just 
visualize your competition overtaking you by a car length or so.  
One of the reasons autocross is such a difficult sport, but also 
such a pure sport, from the driver's standpoint, is that you can't 
make up this time.  If you blow a corner in a road race, you may 
have a few laps in which to make it up.  But to win an autocross 
against good competition, you must drive nearly perfectly.  The 
driver who makes the fewest mistakes usually wins!
<P>
	The next kinematic equation involves acceleration.  It so 
happens that the distance covered by a car at constant 
acceleration from a standing start is given by
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">
or 1/2 times the acceleration times the time, squared.  What 
conversions will help us do mental calculations with this 
equation?  Usually, we like to measure acceleration in <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap117.xbm">s.  One <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap117.xbm"> 
happens to be 32.1 feet per second squared.  Fortunately, we don't 
have to deal with miles and hours here, so our equation becomes, 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap99.xbm">
roughly.  So, a car accelerating from a standing start at 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap121.xbm">, 
which is a typical number for a good, stock sports car, will go 8 
feet in 1 second.  Not very far!  However, this picks up rapidly.  
In two seconds, the car will go 32 feet, or over two car lengths.
<P>
Just to prove to you that this isn't crazy, let's answer the 
question ``How long will it take a car accelerating at 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap123.xbm"> to do 
the quarter mile?''  We invert the equation above (recall your high 
school algebra), to get
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap100.xbm">
and we plug in the numbers: the quarter mile equals 1320 feet, 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap125.xbm">, 
and we get 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap127.xbm">
which is about 13 seconds.  Not
too unreasonable!  A real car will  not be able to keep up full
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap129.xbm">
acceleration for a quarter mile  due to air resistance and reduced
torque in the higher gears.   This explains why real (stock) sports
cars do the quarter mile in  14 or 15 seconds.
<P>
	The more interesting result is the fact that it takes a full 
second to go the first 8 feet.  So, we can see that the launch is 
critical in an autocross.  With excessive wheelspin, which robs 
you of acceleration, you can lose a whole second right at the 
start.  Just visualize your competition pulling 8 feet ahead 
instantly, and that margin grows because they are `hooked up' 
better.
<P>
	For doing these mental calculations, it is helpful to memorize a 
few squares.  8 squared is 64, 10 squared is 100, 11 squared is 
121, 12 squared is 144, 13 squared is 169, and so on.  You can 
then estimate square roots in your head with acceptable precision.
<P>
	Finally, let's examine how engine torque becomes force at the 
drive wheels and finally acceleration.  For this examination, we 
will need to know the mass of the car.  Any equation in physics 
that involves mass is called <em>dynamic</em>, as opposed to kinematic.  
Let's say we have a Corvette that weighs 3200 pounds and produces 
330 foot-pounds of torque at the crankshaft.  The Corvette's 
automatic transmission has a first gear ratio of 3.06 (the auto is 
the trick set up for vettes-just ask Roger Johnson or Mark 
Thornton).  A transmission is nothing but a set of circular, 
rotating levers, and the gear ratio is the leverage, multiplying 
the torque of the engine.  So, at the output of the transmission, 
we have 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap101.xbm">
of torque.  The differential is a further lever-multiplier, in the 
case of the Corvette by a factor of 3.07, yielding 3100 foot 
pounds at the center of the rear wheels (this is a lot of 
torque!).  The distance from the center of the wheel to the ground 
is about 13 inches, or 1.08 feet, so the maximum force that the 
engine can put to the ground in a rearward direction (causing the 
ground to push back forward-remember part 1 of this series!) in 
first gear is 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap102.xbm">
Now, at rest, the car has about 50/50 weight distribution, so 
there is about 1600 pounds of load on the rear tires.  You will 
remember from last month's article on tire adhesion that the tires 
cannot respond with a forward force much greater than the weight 
that is on them, so they simply will spin if you stomp on the 
throttle, asking them to give you 2870 pounds of force.
<P>
	We can now see why it is important to squeeeeeeeze the throttle 
gently when launching.  In the very first instant of a launch, 
your goal as a driver is to get the engine up to where it is 
pushing on the tire contact patch at about 1600 pounds.  The tires 
will squeal or hiss just a little when you get this right.  Not so 
coincidentally, this will give you a forward force of about 1600 
pounds, for an <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap131.xbm"> (part 1) acceleration of about 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap133.xbm">, or 
half the weight of the car.  The main reason a car will accelerate 
with only 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7731_tex2html_wrap135.xbm">
 to start with is that half of the weight is on the 
front wheels and is unavailable to increase the stiction of the 
rear, driving tires.  Immediately, however, there will be some 
weight transfer to the rear.  Remembering part 1 of this series 
again, you can estimate that about 320 pounds will be transferred 
to the rear immediately.  You can now ask the tires to give you a 
little more, and you can gently push on the throttle.  Within a 
second or so, you can be at full throttle, putting all that torque 
to work for a beautiful hole shot!
<P>
	In a rear drive car, weight transfer acts to make the driving 
wheels capable of withstanding greater forward loads.  In a front 
drive car, weight transfer works against acceleration, so you have 
to be even more gentle on the throttle if you have a lot of power.  
An all-wheel drive car puts all the wheels to work delivering 
force to the ground and is theoretically the best.
<P>
	Technical people call this style of calculating ``back of the 
envelope,'' which is a somewhat picturesque reference to the habit 
we have of writing equations and numbers on any piece of paper 
that happens to be handy.  You do it without calculators or slide 
rules or abacuses.  You do it in the garage or the pits.  It is 
not exactly precise, but gives you a rough idea, say within 10 or 
20 percent, of the forces and accelerations at work.  And now you 
know how to do back-of-the-envelope calculations, too.
