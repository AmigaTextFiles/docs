Most autocrossers and race drivers learn early in their
careers the importance of balancing a car.  Learning to do
it consistently and  automatically is one essential part of
becoming a truly good driver.  While the skills for
balancing a car are commonly taught in drivers' schools,
the rationale behind them is not usually adequately
explained.  That rationale comes from simple physics. 
Understanding the physics of driving not only  helps one be
a better driver, but increases one's enjoyment of driving
as  well.  If you know the deep reasons why you ought to do
certain things  you will remember the things better and
move faster toward complete internalization of the skills.
<P>
	Balancing a car is controlling weight transfer using
throttle, brakes, and steering.  This article explains the
physics of weight transfer.  You will often hear
instructors and drivers say that applying the brakes shifts 
weight to the front of a car and can induce oversteer. 
Likewise, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, inducing
understeer, and cornering shifts weight to the opposite
side, unloading the inside tires.  But why does weight
shift during these maneuvers?  How can weight shift when 
everything is in the car bolted in and strapped down? 
Briefly, the reason is that inertia acts through the center
of gravity (CG) of the car, which is above the ground, but
adhesive forces act at ground level through the tire 
contact patches.  The effects of weight transfer are
proportional to the  height of the CG off the ground.  A
flatter car, one with a lower CG, handles better and
quicker because weight transfer is not so drastic as it is 
in a high car.
<P>
The rest of this article explains how
inertia and adhesive forces give rise to weight transfer
through Newton's laws.  
The article begins with the
elements and works up to some simple equations that you can
use to calculate weight transfer in any car knowing only
the wheelbase, the height of the CG, the static weight
distribution, and the track, or distance between the tires
across the car.  These numbers are reported in shop manuals
and most journalistic reviews of cars.
<P>
	Most people remember Newton's laws from school physics. 
These  are fundamental laws that apply to all large things
in the universe, such as cars.  In the context of our
racing application, they are:
<P>
The first law: <b>a car in straight-line motion at a
constant speed will  keep such motion until acted on by an
external force</b>.  The only reason a car in neutral will not
coast forever is that friction, an external force,  gradually
slows the car down.  Friction comes from the tires on the
ground  and the air flowing over the car.  The tendency of a
car to keep moving the  way it is moving is the inertia of
the car, and this tendency is concentrated  at the CG
point.
<P>
	The second law: <b>When a force is applied to a car, the
change in  motion is proportional to the force divided by
the mass of the car</b>.  This law is expressed by the famous
equation <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap72.xbm">, where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap74.xbm"> is a force, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap76.xbm"> is the 
mass of the car, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap78.xbm"> is the acceleration, or change in
motion, of the car.   A larger force causes quicker changes
in motion, and a heavier car reacts more slowly to forces. 
Newton's second law explains why quick cars are powerful and
lightweight.  The more <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap74.xbm"> and the less <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap76.xbm"> you have, the
more <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap78.xbm"> you can get.
<P>
	The third law: <b>Every force on a car by another object,
such as the ground, is matched by an equal and opposite
force on the object by the car</b>.   When you apply the brakes,
you cause the tires to push forward against the ground, and
the ground pushes back.  As long as the tires stay on the
car,  the ground pushing on them slows the car down.
<P>
	Let us continue analyzing braking.  Weight transfer during 
accelerating and cornering are mere variations on the
theme.  We won't consider subtleties such as suspension and
tire deflection yet.  These effects are very important, but
secondary.  The figure shows a car and the forces on it
during a ``one g'' braking maneuver.  One g means that
the total braking force equals the weight of the car, say, in
pounds.
<P>
<P><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_figure35.gif"><P>
<P>In this figure, the black and white ``pie plate'' in the
center is the CG.   <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap140.xbm"> is the force of gravity that pulls
the car toward the center of the Earth.   This is the weight
of the car; weight is just another word for the force of 
gravity.  It is a fact of Nature, only fully explained by
Albert Einstein, that  gravitational forces act through the
CG of an object, just like inertia.  This  fact can be
explained at deeper levels, but such an explanation would
take  us too far off the subject of weight transfer.
<P>
	<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> is the lift force exerted by the ground on the front
tire, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> is the  lift force on the rear tire.  These
lift forces are as real as the ones that keep  an airplane
in the air, and they keep the car from falling through the 
ground to the center of the Earth.
<P>
	We don't often notice the forces that the ground exerts on
objects  because they are so ordinary, but they are at the
essence of car dynamics.   The reason is that the magnitude
of these forces determine the ability of a  tire to stick,
and imbalances between the front and rear lift forces
account  for understeer and oversteer.  The figure only
shows forces on the car, not  forces on the ground and the
CG of the Earth.  Newton's third law  requires that these
equal and opposite forces exist, but we are only concerned
about how the ground and the Earth's gravity affect the
car.
<P>
	If the car were standing still or coasting, and its weight
distribution  were 50-50, then <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> would be the same as
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">.  It is always the case that <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm">  plus <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> equals
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap140.xbm">, the weight of the car.  Why?  Because of Newton's first 
law.  The car is not changing its motion in the vertical
direction, at least as  long as it doesn't get airborne, so
the total sum of all forces in the vertical  direction must
be zero.  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap140.xbm"> points down and counteracts the sum of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm">
and  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">, which point up.
<P>
	Braking causes <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> to be greater than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">.  Literally, the
``rear end gets  light,'' as one often hears racers say. 
Consider the front and rear braking  forces, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap112.xbm"> and
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap114.xbm">, in the diagram.  They push backwards on the tires,
which  push on the wheels, which push on the suspension
parts, which push on the rest of the car, slowing it down. 
But these forces are acting at ground level, not at the
level of the CG.  The braking forces are indirectly slowing 
down the car by pushing at ground level, while the inertia
of the car is  `trying' to keep it moving forward as a unit
at the CG level.
<P>
	The braking forces create a rotating tendency, or torque,
about the  CG.  Imagine pulling a table cloth out from under
some glasses and  candelabra.  These objects would have a
tendency to tip or rotate over, and  the tendency is greater
for taller objects and is greater the harder you pull  on
the cloth.  The rotational tendency of a car under braking
is due to  identical physics.
<P>
	The braking torque acts in such a way as to put the car up
on its nose.   Since the car does not actually go up on its
nose (we hope), some other  forces must be counteracting
that tendency, by Newton's first law.  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap140.xbm"> cannot be doing it
since it passes right through the cetner of gravity.  The 
only forces that can counteract that tendency are the lift
forces, and the  only way they can do so is for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> to become
greater than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">.  Literally, the  ground pushes up harder on
the front tires during braking to try to keep  the car from
tipping forward.
<P>
	By how much does <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> exceed <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">?  The braking torque is
proportional  to the sum of the braking forces and to the
height of the CG.  Let's say that  height is 20 inches.  The
counterbalancing torque resisting the braking torque is
proportional to <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> and half the wheelbase (in a car
with 50-50 weight distribution), minus <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> times half
the wheelbase since <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> is helping  the braking forces
upend the car.  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap96.xbm"> has a lot of work to do: it must
resist  the torques of both the braking forces and the lift
on the rear tires.  Let's  say the wheelbase is 100 inches. 
Since we are braking at one g, the braking  forces equal
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap140.xbm">, say, 3200 pounds.  All this is summarized in the
following  equations:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap60.xbm">
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap61.xbm">
<P>
	With the help of a little algebra, we can find out that
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap62.xbm">
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap63.xbm">
<P>
Thus, by braking at one g in our example car, we add 640
pounds of load to  the front tires and take 640 pounds off
the rears!  This is very pronounced  weight transfer.
<P>
	By doing a similar analysis for a more general car with CG
height of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap136.xbm">, wheelbase <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap138.xbm">, weight <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap140.xbm">, static weight
distribution <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap142.xbm"> expressed as a  fraction of weight in the
front, and braking with force <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap144.xbm">, we can show that
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap64.xbm">
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap65.xbm">
<P>
These equations can be used to calculate weight transfer
during  acceleration by treating acceleration force as
negative braking force.  If  you have acceleration figures
in gees, say from a <em>G-analyst</em> or other  device, just
multiply them by the weight of the car to get acceleration 
forces (Newton's second law!).  Weight transfer during
cornering can be  analyzed in a similar way, where the track
of the car replaces the  wheelbase and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7138_tex2html_wrap142.xbm"> is always 50%(unless you account for the weight of the driver).  Those
of you with science or engineering backgrounds may enjoy 
deriving these equations for yourselves.  The equations for
a car doing a  combination of braking and cornering, as in a
trail braking maneuver, are  much more complicated and
require some mathematical tricks to derive.
<P>
	Now you know why weight transfer happens.  The next topic
that comes to mind is the physics of tire adhesion, which
explains how weight transfer can lead to understeer and
oversteer conditions.
