In last month's article, we explained the physics behind weight 
transfer.  That is, we explained why braking shifts weight to the 
front of the car, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, and 
cornering shifts weight to the outside of a curve.  Weight 
transfer is a side-effect of the tires keeping the car from 
flipping over during maneuvers.  We found out that a one <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap64.xbm"> braking 
maneuver in our 3200 pound example car causes 640 pounds to 
transfer from the rear tires to the front tires.  The explanations 
were given directly in terms of Newton's fundamental laws of 
Nature.
<P>
	This month, we investigate what causes tires to stay stuck 
and what causes them to break away and slide.  We will find out 
that you can make a tire slide either by pushing too hard on it or 
by causing weight to transfer off the tire by your control inputs 
of throttle, brakes, and steering.  Conversely, you can cause a 
sliding tire to stick again by pushing less hard on it or by 
tranferring weight to it.  The rest of this article explains all 
this in term of (you guessed it) physics.
<P>
	This knowledge, coupled with a good `instinct' for weight 
transfer, can help a driver predict the consequences of all his or 
her actions and develop good instincts for staying out of trouble, 
getting out of trouble when it comes, and driving consistently at 
ten tenths.  It is said of Tazio Nuvolari, one of the greatest 
racing drivers ever, that he knew at all times while driving the 
weight on each of the four tires to within a few pounds.  He could 
think, while driving, how the loads would change if he lifted off 
the throttle or turned the wheel a little more, for example.  His 
knowledge of the physics of racing enabled him to make tiny, 
accurate adjustments to suit every circumstance, and perhaps to 
make these adjustments better than his competitors.  Of course, he 
had a very fast brain and phenomenal reflexes, too.
<P>
	I am going to ask you to do a few physics ``lab'' experiments 
with me to investigate tire adhesion.  You can actually do them, 
or you can just follow along in your imagination.  First, get a 
tire and wheel off your car.  If you are a serious autocrosser, 
you probably have a few loose sets in your garage.  You can do the 
experiments with a heavy box or some object that is easier to 
handle than a tire, but the numbers you get won't apply directly 
to tires, although the principles we investigate will apply.
<P>
	Weigh yourself both holding the wheel and not holding it on a 
bathroom scale.  The difference is the weight of the tire and 
wheel assembly.  In my case, it is 50 pounds (it would be a lot 
less if I had those $3000Jongbloed wheels!  Any sponsors 
reading?).  Now put the wheel on the ground or on a table and push 
sideways with your hand against the tire until it slides.  When 
you push it, push down low near the point where the tire touches 
the ground so it doesn't tip over.
<P>
	The question is, how hard did you have to push to make the 
tire slide?  You can find out by putting the bathroom scale 
between your hand and the tire when you push.  This procedure 
doesn't give a very accurate reading of the force you need to make 
the tire slide, but it gives a rough estimate.  In my case, on the 
concrete walkway in front of my house, I had to push with 85 
pounds of force (my neighbors don't bother staring at me any more; 
they're used to my strange antics).  On my linoleum kitchen floor, 
I only had to push with 60 pounds (but my wife does stare at me 
when I do this stuff in the house).  What do these numbers mean?
<P>
	They mean that, on concrete, my tire gave me <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap54.xbm"> 
gees of sideways resistance before sliding.  On a linoleum race 
course (ahem!), I would only be able to get <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap56.xbm">.  We have 
directly experienced the physics of grip with our bare hands.  The 
fact that the tire resists sliding, up to a point, is called the 
<em>grip phenomenon</em>.  If you could view the interface between the 
ground and the tire with a microscope, you would see complex 
interactions between long-chain rubber molecules bending, 
stretching, and locking into concrete molecules creating the grip.  
Tire researchers look into the detailed workings of tires at these 
levels of detail.
<P>
	Now, I'm not getting too excited about being able to achieve 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap58.xbm"> cornering in an autocross.  Before I performed this 
experiment, I frankly expected to see a number below <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap68.xbm">.  This 
rather unbelievable number of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap58.xbm"> would certainly not be 
attainable under driving conditions, but is still a testimony to 
the rather unbelievable state of tire technology nowadays.  Thirty 
years ago, engineers believed that one <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap64.xbm"> was theoretically 
impossible from a tire.  This had all kinds of consequences.  It 
implied, for example, that dragsters could not possibly go faster 
than 200 miles per hour in a quarter mile: you can go 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap66.xbm"> if you can keep <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap68.xbm"> acceleration all
the  way down the track.  Nowadays, drag racing safety watchdogs are 
working hard to keep the cars under 300 mph; top fuel dragsters  launch
at more than 3 gees.
<P>
	For the second experiment, try weighing down your tire with 
some ballast.  I used a couple of dumbells slung through the 
center of the wheel with rope to give me a total weight of 90 
pounds.  Now, I had to push with 150 pounds of force to move the 
tire sideways on concrete.  Still about <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap58.xbm">.  We observe the 
fundamental law of adhesion: the force required to slide a tire is 
proportional to the weight supported by the tire.  When your tire 
is on the car, weighed down with the car, you cannot push it 
sideways simply because you can't push hard enough.
<P>
	The force required to slide a tire is called the <em>adhesive 
limit</em> of the tire, or sometimes the <em>stiction</em>, which is a slang 
combination of ``stick'' and ``friction.''  This law, in mathematical 
form, is 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap50.xbm">
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap78.xbm"> is the force with which the tire resists sliding; <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap84.xbm"> is 
the <em>coefficient of static friction</em> or <em>coefficient of
adhesion</em>; and  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap86.xbm"> is the weight or vertical load on the tire contact
patch.  Both  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap78.xbm"> and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap86.xbm"> have the units of force (remember that weight is
the force  of gravity), so <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap84.xbm"> is just a number, a proportionality
constant.   This equation states that the sideways force a tire can
withstand  before sliding is less than or equal to <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap84.xbm"> times <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap86.xbm">. 
Thus, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap88.xbm"> is the maximum sideways force the tire can withstand and is 
equal to the stiction.  We often like to speak of the sideways 
acceleration the car can achieve, and we can convert the stiction 
force into acceleration in gees by dividing by <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap86.xbm">, the weight of 
the car.  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap84.xbm"> can thus be measured in gees.
<P>
	The coefficient of static friction is not exactly a constant.  
Under driving conditions, many effects come into play that reduce 
the stiction of a good autocross tire to somewhere around <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7599_tex2html_wrap94.xbm">.  These
effects are deflection of the tire, suspension  movement, temperature,
inflation pressure, and so on.  But the  proportionality law still holds
reasonably true under these  conditions.  Now you can see that if you are
cornering, braking,  or accelerating at the limit, which means at the
adhesive limit of  the tires, any weight transfer will cause the tires
unloaded by  the weight transfer to pass from sticking into sliding.
<P>
	Actually, the transition from sticking `mode' to sliding mode 
should not be very abrupt in a well-designed tire.  When one 
speaks of a ``forgiving'' tire, one means a tire that breaks away 
slowly as it gets more and more force or less and less weight, 
giving the driver time to correct.  Old, hard tires are, generally 
speaking, less forgiving than new, soft tires.  Low-profile tires 
are less forgiving than high-profile tires.  Slicks are less 
forgiving than DOT tires.  But these are very broad generalities 
and tires must be judged individually, usually by getting some 
word-of-mouth recommendations or just by trying them out in an 
autocross.  Some tires are so unforgiving that they break away 
virtually without warning, leading to driver dramatics usually 
resulting in a spin.  Forgiving tires are much easier to control 
and much more fun to drive with.
<P>
	``Driving by the seat of your pants'' means sensing the slight 
changes in cornering, braking, and acceleration forces that signal 
that one or more tires are about to slide.  You can sense these 
change literally in your seat, but you can also feel changes in 
steering resistance and in the sounds the tires make.  Generally, 
tires `squeak' when they are nearing the limit, `squeal' at the 
limit, and `squall' over the limit.  I find tire sounds very 
informative and always listen to them while driving.
<P>
	So, to keep your tires stuck to the ground, be aware that 
accelerating gives the front tires less stiction and the rear 
tires more, that braking gives the front tire more stiction and 
the rear tires less, and that cornering gives the inside tires 
less stiction and the outside tires more.  These facts are due to 
the combination of weight transfer and the grip phenomenon.  
Finally, drive smoothly, that is, translate your awareness into 
gentle control inputs that always keep appropriate tires stuck at 
the right times.  This is the essential knowledge required for car 
control, and, of course, is much easier said than done.  Later 
articles will use the knowledge we have accumulated so far to 
explain understeer, oversteer, and chassis set-up.
