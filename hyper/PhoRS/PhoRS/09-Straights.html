We found in part 5 of this series,
``Introduction to the Racing Line,'' that a driver can lose a
shocking amount of time by taking a bad line in a corner.   
With a six-foot-wide car on a ten-foot-wide course, one can lose
sixteen hundredths by `blowing' a single right-angle turn.  
This month, we extend the analysis of the racing line by following
our example car down a straight.  
It is often said that the most critical corner in a course is the
one before the longest straight.   
Let's find out how critical it is.   
We calculate how much time it takes to go down a straight
as a function of the speed entering the straight.  
The results, which are given at the end, 
are not terribly dramatic, but we make several, key
improvements in the mathematical model that is under continuing
development in this series of articles.  
These improvements will be used as we 
proceed designing the computer program
begun in Part 8.
<P>
The mathematical model for traveling down a straight follows from
Newton's second law:
<P><A NAME=newton><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation29.xbm"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap185.xbm"> is the force on the car, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap267.xbm"> is the mass of the car,
and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap269.xbm"> is the acceleration of the car.  
We want to solve this equation to get time as a function of
distance down the straight.  
Basically, we want a
table of numbers so that we can look up the time it takes to go
any distance.  
We can build this table using accountants' columnar
paper, or we can use the modern version of the
columnar pad: the electronic spreadsheet program.
<P>
To solve equation 1 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#newton><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, we first invert it: 
<P><A NAME=foo><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation33.xbm"><P>
Now <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap269.xbm">, the acceleration, is the rate of change of velocity with
time.  
<em>Rate of change</em> is simply the ratio of a small change
in velocity to a small change in time.  
Let us assume that we have filled in a column of times on our
table.  The times start with <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap193.xbm"> and go up by the same,
small amount, say <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap195.xbm"> sec.  Physicists call this small
time the <em>integration step</em>.  It is standard practice to begin
solving an equation with a fixed integration step.  There
are sometimes good reasons to vary the integration step, but those
reasons do not arise in this problem.  Let us call the
integration step <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap197.xbm">.  
If we call the time in the <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">-th row <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap201.xbm">, then for
every row except the first, 
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation41.xbm"><P>
<P>
We label
another column <em>velocity</em>, and we'll call the velocity in the
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">-th row <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap207.xbm">.  For every row except the first,
equation 2 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#foo><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> becomes:
<P><A NAME=baz><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation48.xbm"><P>
We want to fill in velocities as we go down the columns, so we
need to solve equation 4 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#baz><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap207.xbm">.  This will give
us a formula for computing <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> given <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap211.xbm"> for every row
except the first.  In the first row, we put the speed with which we
enter the straight, which is an input to the problem.  We get:
<P><A NAME=bar><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation55.xbm"><P>
<P>
We label another column <em>distance</em>, and we call the distance
value in the <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">-th row <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap215.xbm">.  Just as acceleration is the
rate of change of velocity, so velocity is the rate of change of
distance over time.  Just as before, then, we may write:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation62.xbm"><P>
Solved for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap215.xbm">, this is:
<P><A NAME=qux><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation66.xbm"><P>
<P>
Equation 7 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#qux><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> gives us a formula for calculating the
distance for any time given the previous distance and the
velocity calculated by equation 5 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#bar><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  Physicists would say
that we have a scheme for <em>integrating the equations of
motion</em>.
<P>
A small detail is missing: what is the force, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap185.xbm">?  Everything to
this point is <em>kinematic</em>.  The real modeling starts now with
formulas for calculating the force.  For this, we will draw
on all the previous articles in this series.  
Let's label another column <em>force</em>, and a few
more with <em>drag</em>, <em>rolling resistance</em>, <em>engine
torque</em>, <em>engine rpm</em>, <em>wheel rpm</em>, <em>trans gear
ratio</em>, <em>drive ratio</em>, <em>wheel torque</em>, and <em>drive
force</em>.  As you can see, we are going to derive a fairly complete,
if not accurate, model of accelerating down the straight.  We need
a few constants: 
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tabular86.gif"><P>
<P>
and a few variables:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tabular93.gif"><P>
<P>
All the example values are for a late model Corvette. 
<em>Slugs</em> are the English unit of mass, and 1 slug weighs
about 32.1 lbs at sea level (another manifestation of 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap263.xbm">, with <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap185.xbm"> in lbs, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap267.xbm"> in slugs, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap269.xbm"> being 
the acceleration of gravity, 32.1 ft/sec<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap271.xbm">).
<P>
The most basic modeling equation is that the force we can
use for forward acceleration is the propelling
force transmitted through
the wheels minus drag and rolling resistance:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation100.xbm"><P>
The force of drag we get from Part 6:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation102.xbm"><P>
Note that to calculate the force at step <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">, we can use the
velocity at step <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">.  This force goes into calculating the 
acceleration at step <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">, which is used to calculate the 
velocity and distance at step <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap279.xbm"> by equations 5 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#bar><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>
and 7 <A HREF=09-Straights.html#qux><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  Those two equations represent the only `backward
references' we need.  Thus, the only inputs to the integration
are the initial distance, 0, and the entrance velocity, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap281.xbm">.
<P>
The rolling resistance is approximately proportional to the
velocity:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation108.xbm"><P>
This approximation is probably the weakest one in the model.  I
derived it by noting from a Corvette book that 8.2 hp were needed
to overcome rolling resistance at 55 mph.  I have nothing else
but intuition to go on for this equation, so take it with a 
grain of salt.
<P>
Finally, we must calculate the forward force delivered by the
ground to the car by reaction to the rearward force delivered to
the ground <em>via</em> the engine and drive train:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation110.xbm"><P>
This equation simply states that we take the engine torque
multiplied by the rear axle ratio and the transmission drive
ratio in the <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap283.xbm">-th gear, which is the torque at the drive
wheels, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap285.xbm">, and  divide it by the radius of the wheel, which is
half the diameter of the wheel, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap287.xbm">.
<P>
To calculate the forward force, we must decide what gear to 
be in.  The logic we use to do this is the following: from the 
velocity, we can calculate the wheel rpm:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation115.xbm"><P>
From this, we know the engine rpm:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_equation121.xbm"><P>
At each step of integration, we look at the current engine rpm
and ask ``is it past the torque peak of the engine?''  If so, 
we shift to the next highest gear, if possible.  Somewhat
arbitrarily, we assume that the torque peak is at 4200 rpm.  To
keep things simple, we also make the optimistic assumption that the
engine puts out a constant torque of 330 ft-lbs.  To make the
model more realistic, we need merely look up a torque curve for
our engine, usually expressed as a function of rpm, and read the
torque off the curve at each step of the integration.  The
current approximation is not terrible however; it merely gives
us artificially good times and speeds.  Another important
improvement on the logic would be to check whether the wheels
are spinning, <em>i.e.</em>, that acceleration is less than about 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8916_tex2html_wrap289.xbm">, and to `lift off the gas' in that case.
<P>
We have all the ingredients necessary to calculate how much time
it takes to cover a straight given an initial speed.  
You can imagine
doing the calculations outlined above by hand on columnar paper,
or you can check my results (below) by programming them up in a
spreadsheet program like Lotus 1-2-3 or Microsoft Excel. 
Eventually, of course, if you follow this series, you will see
these equations again as we write our Scheme program for
simulating car dynamics.  Integrating the equations of motion by
hand will take you many hours.  Using a spreadsheet will
take several hours, too, but many less than integrating by hand.
<P>
To illustrate the process, we show below the times and exit speeds
for a 200 foot straight,  which is a fairly long one 
in autocrossing, and a 500
foot straight, which you should only see on race tracks.  We
show times and speeds for a variety of speeds entering the
straight from 25 to 50 mph in Table 1
<A HREF=09-Straights.html#thetable><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.  
The results are also summarized in the two plots, 
Figures 1
<A HREF=#time><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> and 2
<A HREF=#speed><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

<P>
The notable facts arising in this analysis are the following.  
The time difference resulting from entering the 200' 
straight at 27
mph rather than 25 mph is about 6 hundredths.  Frankly, not
as much as I expected.  The time difference between entering
at 31 mph over 25 mph is about 2 tenths, again less than
I would have guessed.  The speed difference at the end of 
the straight between entering at 25 mph and 50 mph is only 
8 mph, a result of the fact that the car labors against 
friction and higher gear ratios at high speeds.  It is also
a consequence of the fact that there is so much torque available
at 25 mph in low gear
that the car can almost make up the difference
over the relatively short 200' straight.  In fact, on the 
longer 500'
straight, the exit speed difference between entering at
25 mph and 50 mph is not even 5 mph, though the time difference
is nearly a full second.
<P>
This analysis would most likely be 
much more dramatic for a car with less torque than a Corvette. 
In a Corvette, with 330 ft-lbs of torque on tap, the penalty
for entering a straight slower than necessary is not so 
great as it would be in a more typical car, where recovering
speed lost through timidity or bad cornering is much more 
difficult.
<P>
Again, the analysis can be improved by using a real torque
curve and by checking whether the wheels are spinning in lower
gears.
