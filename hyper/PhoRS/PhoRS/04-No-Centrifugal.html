One often hears of ``centrifugal force.''  This is the apparent 
force that throws you to the outside of a turn during cornering.  
If there is anything loose in the car, it will immediately slide 
to the right in a left hand turn, and <em>vice versa</em>.  Perhaps you 
have experienced what happened to me once.  I had omitted to 
remove an empty Pepsi can hidden under the passenger seat.  During 
a particularly aggressive run (something for which I am not 
unknown), this can came loose, fluttered around the cockpit for a 
while, and eventually flew out the passenger window in the middle 
of a hard left hand corner.
<P>
	I shall attempt to convince you, in this month's article, that 
centrifugal force is a fiction, and a consequence of the fact 
first noticed just over three hundred years ago by Newton that
objects tend to continue moving in a straight line unless acted on by
an external force.
<P>
	When you turn the steering wheel, you are trying to get the 
front tires to push a little sideways on the ground, which then 
pushes back, by Newton's third law.  When the ground pushes back, 
it causes a little sideways acceleration.  This sideways acceleration
is a change in the sideways velocity.   The acceleration is
proportional to the sideways force, and inversely proportional to the
mass of the car, by Newton's second law.  The sideways acceleration
thus causes the car to veer a little  sideways, which is what you
wanted when you turned the wheel.  If  you keep the steering and
throttle at constant positions, you will continue to go mostly
forwards and a little sideways until you end up where you started. 
In other words, you will go in a circle.  When driving through a
sweeper, you are going part way around a circle.  If you take skid
pad lessons (highly recommended), you will go around in circles all
day.
<P>
	If you turn the steering wheel a little more, you will go in a 
tighter circle, and the sideways force needed to keep you going is 
greater.  If you go around the same circle but faster, the 
necessary force is greater.  If you try to go around too fast, the 
adhesive limit of the tires will be exceeded, they will slide, and 
you will not stick to the circular path-you will not ``make it.''
<P>
	From the discussion above, we can see that in order to turn 
right, for example, a force, pointing to the right, must act on 
the car that veers it away from the straight line it naturally 
tries to follow.  If the force stays constant, the car will go in 
a circle.  From the point of view of the car, the force always 
points to the right.  From a point of view outside the car, at 
rest with respect to the ground, however, the force points toward 
the center of the circle.  From this point of view, although the 
force is constant in <em>magnitude</em>, it changes <em>direction</em>,
going around and around as the car turns, always pointing at the
geometrical center of the  circle.  This force is called
<em>centripetal</em>,
from the Greek for ``center seeking.''   The point
of view on the ground is privileged, since objects at rest from this
point of view feel no net forces.  Physicists call this special point
of view an <em>inertial frame of reference</em>.  The forces measured in
an inertial frame are, in a sense, more correct than those measured by
a physicist riding in the car.  Forces measured inside the car are
<em>biased</em> by the centripetal force.
<P>
	Inside the car, all objects, such as the driver, feel the 
natural inertial tendency to continue moving in a straight line.  
The driver receives a centripetal force from the car through the 
seat and the belts.  If you don't have good restraints, you may 
find yourself pushing with your knee against the door and tugging 
on the controls in order to get the centripetal force you need to 
go in a circle with the car.  It took me a long time to overcome 
the habit of tugging on the car in order to stay put in it.  I 
used to come home with bruises on my left knee from pushing hard 
against the door during an autocross.  I found that a tight five-
point harness helped me to overcome this unnecessary habit.  With 
it, I no longer think about body position while driving-I can 
concentrate on trying to be smooth and fast.  As a result, I use 
the wheel and the gearshift lever for steering and shifting rather 
than for helping me stay put in the car!
<P>
	The `forces' that the driver and other objects inside the car 
feel are actually centripetal.  The term <em>centrifugal</em>, or
``center  fleeing,'' refers to the inertial tendency to resist the
centripetal force and to continue going straight.  If the centripetal
force is constant in magnitude, the centrifugal tendency will be
constant.  There is no such thing as centrifugal force (although it
is a convenient fiction for the purpose of some calculations).
<P>
	Let's figure out exactly how much sideways acceleration is 
needed to keep a car going at speed <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> in a circle of radius <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap100.xbm">.  We 
can then convert this into force using Newton's second law, and 
then figure out how fast we can go in a circle before exceeding 
the adhesive limit-in other words, we can derive maximum cornering 
speed.  For the following discussion, it will be helpful for you to
draw little back-of-the-envelope pictures (I'm leaving them out, giving
our editor a rest from transcribing my graphics into the newsletter).
<P>
	Consider a very short interval of time, far less than a second.  
Call it <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap118.xbm"> (<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap104.xbm"> stands for ``delta,'' a Greek letter mathematicians 
use as shorthand for ``tiny increment'').  In time <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap118.xbm">, let us say we 
go forward a distance <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap128.xbm"> and sideways a distance <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap136.xbm">.  The forward 
component of the velocity of the car is approximately <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap140.xbm">.   At the beginning of the time interval <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap118.xbm">, the car has no
sideways  velocity.  At the end, it has sideways velocity <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap120.xbm">.  In
the  time <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap118.xbm">, the car has thus had a change in sideways velocity of 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap120.xbm">.  Acceleration is, precisely, the change in velocity over a
certain time, divided by the time; just as velocity is the change in 
position over a certain time, divided by the time.  Thus, the 
sideways acceleration is 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap90.xbm">
How is <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap136.xbm"> related to <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap100.xbm">, the radius of the circle?  If we go 
forward by a fraction <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap126.xbm"> of the radius of the circle, we must go 
sideways by exactly the same fraction of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap128.xbm"> to stay on the circle.  
This means that <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap130.xbm">.  The fraction <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap126.xbm"> is, however, nothing 
but <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap134.xbm">.  By this reasoning, we get the relation
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap91.xbm">
We can substitute this expression for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap136.xbm"> into the expression for 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap148.xbm">, and remembering that <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap140.xbm">, we get the final result
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap92.xbm">
	This equation simply says quantitatively what we wrote before: 
that the acceleration (and the force) needed to keep to a circular 
line increases with the velocity and increases as the radius gets 
smaller.
<P>
	What was <em>not</em> appreciated before we went through this derivation 
is that the necessary acceleration increases as the <em>square</em> of
the  velocity.  This means that the centripetal force your tires must 
give you for you to make it through a sweeper is very sensitive to 
your speed.   If you go just a little bit too fast, you might as 
well go <em>much</em> too fast-your're not going to make it.  The 
following table shows the maximum speed that can be achieved in 
turns of various radii for various sideways accelerations.  This 
table shows the value of the expression
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap93.xbm">
which is the solution of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap142.xbm"> for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">, the velocity. 
The  conversion factor 15/22 converts <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap98.xbm"> from feet per second to
miles  per hour, and 32.1 converts <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap148.xbm"> from gees to feet per second 
squared.  We covered these conversion factors in part 3 of this 
series.
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tabular65.gif"><P>
<P>
	For autocrossing, the columns for 50 and 100 feet and the row 
for 1.00 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap150.xbm"> are most germane.  The table tells us that to achieve 
1.00 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap150.xbm"> sideways acceleration in a corner of 50 foot radius (this 
kind of corner is all too common in autocross), a driver must not 
go faster than 27.32 miles per hour.  To go 30 mph, 1.25 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7932_tex2html_wrap150.xbm"> is 
required, which is probably not within the capability of an 
autocross tire at this speed.  There is not much subjective 
difference between 27 and 30 mph, but the objective difference is 
usually between making a controlled run and spinning badly.
<P>
	The absolute fastest way to go through a corner is to be just 
over the limit near the exit, in a controlled slide.  To do this, 
however, you must be pointed in just such a way that when the car 
breaks loose and slides to the exit of the corner it will be 
pointed straight down the optimal racing line at the exit when it 
``hooks up'' again.  You can smoothly add throttle during this 
maneuver and be really moving out of the corner.  But you must do 
it smoothly.  It takes a long time to learn this, and probably a 
lifetime to perfect it, but it feels absolutely triumphal when 
done right.  I have not figured out how to drive through a 
sweeper, except for the exit, at anything greater than the 
limiting velocity because sweepers are just too long to slide 
around.  If anyone (Ayrton Senna, perhaps?) knows how, please tell 
me!
<P>
	The chain of reasoning we have just gone through was first 
discovered by Newton and Leibniz, working independently.  It is, 
in fact, a derivation in differential calculus, the mathematics of 
very small quantities.  Newton keeps popping up.  He was perhaps 
the greatest of all physicists, having discovered the laws of 
motion, the law of gravity, and calculus, among other things such 
as the fact that white light is made up of multiple colors mixed 
together.
<P>
	It is an excellent diagnostic exercise to drive a car around a 
circle marked with cones or chalk and gently to increase the speed 
until the car slides.  If the front breaks away first, your car 
has natural understeer, and if the rear slides first, it has 
natural oversteer.  You can use this information for chassis 
tuning.  Of course, this is only to be done in safe circumstances, 
on a rented skid pad or your own private parking lot.  The police 
will gleefully give you a ticket if they catch you doing this in 
the wrong places.
