<h1> Physics of Racing Series, FAQ </h1>
<p>
<i> This FAQ was written by </i><b>Brian Beckman</b>, <i> with 
updates by </i> <b> Robert Keller </b>.
<ul>
<li> 
What is the PhORS?
<p>
   It is a series of articles about the physics of racing
   cars.  It is decidedly slanted toward autocrossing (my
   favorite sport), but sidebars from other forms of racing
   appear when relevant.  I start with the fundamentals
   (Newton's Laws, for example) and am slowly but surely
   building up complexity and covering more advanced topics.  I
   cover all aspects of racing where physics applies, from
   driving to car setup to computer simulations.  I am trying
   hard to make the articles useful and enjoyable for the
   non-technical reader who knows that physics is important for
   racing but needs some help understanding it.  So, you don't
   have to be a physicist, engineer, etc. to understand the
   articles.  
<p>
   The series started in our local-area autocrosser's newsletter
   in June '90.  I started posting them to Team.Net not long
   thereafter.  To date (27 July 91) there are nine articles.
   There is no end in sight. <i>(There are now twelve 
   articles in total -rck 1995)</i>
<p>
<li>
What are your sources for info in the articles?
<p>
   The analyses in the articles are totally original.  I'm
   figuring out the physics as I go along, as part of figuring
   out autocrossing and trying to get better at it.  I'm a
   professional physicist (actually doing computer science,
   these days), and an amateur racer.  The articles are kind of
   a journal of a personal learning process from a physicist's
   point of view.
<p>
   I avoid reading the "classical" technical texts (Smith,
   Puhn, Taruffi, etc.) before writing an article (though I
   *sometimes* cross-check my results with them).  I do this on
   purpose for several reasons:  
<ul>
<li> It would be of little value
   to you to see mere regurgitations of material you can read
   yourself in those sources, 
<li> I want the depth of
   understanding that can come only from figuring out the
   physics from first principles, 
<li> "peeking at the answer"
   would spoil the fun for me, 
<li> I hope and can give a
   somewhat fresh outlook on things.  
</ul>
<p>
   As time goes on, I am working into more accurate approxi-
   mations at the cost of greater complexity.  The earlier 
   articles are easier to understand but less accurate.  
<p>
<li>
How can I get copies of the series?
<p>
   The articles are stored in electronic form for anonymous ftp
   on <a href="ftp://ftp.team.net/autocross">ftp://ftp.team.net/autocross/</a> 
   thanks to the generosity of Mark Bradakis, one of the founders 
   of Team.net.  Ask your local network guru for help with ftp 
   and the decoding procedures outlined below.
<p>
   The articles are free for the taking for personal use,
   though they are copyrighted by me (more about that below).
<p>
   The following describes the format of the files by giving
   the example of Physics09.tar.Z, the file that contains the
   ninth physics article on "Straights."  
<p>
   First, download the file to your favorite machine using
   anonymous ftp.  On my unix machine, I would do the following:
<p>
<pre>
   $ ftp ftp.team.net
   Name: ftp
   331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
   Password: your@email.address
   :
   230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
   ftp> binary
   200 Type set to I.
   ftp> cd autocross
   ftp> ls P*
   150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.

   226 Transfer complete.
   ftp> get Physics09.tar.Z
   ftp> quit
   $
</pre>
<p>
   Then, uncompress the file, as in the following:
<p>
<pre>
   $ zcat Physics09.tar.Z
</pre>
<p>
   That results in Physics09.tar, which is a virtual "Tape ARchive."
   Extract the files from it as follows:
<p>
<pre>
   $ tar xvf Physics09.tar
</pre>
<p>
   A directory "09" containing three files will appear.  The files
   are:

   This is a file containing PostScript input for any PostScript 
   printer.  The file was made and tested on an Apple LaserWriter,
   but should work on anything.  Notice it is very large.  The
   reason is that the Apple Macintosh software that produces it
   is kind of dumb.  The articles are usually five or six pages
   when printed.  
<p>

   This contains original Macintosh files.  The files are
   encoded in "binhex" format.  This file is straight ASCII.
   Get it over to your Mac, run Stuffit 1.5.1 or 1.6, select
   "decode binhex" from a menu, and decode the file.  An
   application program will result.  This application program
   is a so-called "self-unstuffing archive."  Just execute it
   (by double clicking, for example).  It will extract its
   contents automagically.
<p>
   There is always a "Textures" file.  Textures is a Mac
   implementation of TeX, Donald Knuth's technical typesetting
   software package, with extensions for pictures.  Textures
   allows me to put figures in the articles.  I know of no UNIX
   implementation of TeX that makes it easy to put in pictures,
   so I use the Mac implementation.
<p>
   Sometimes there are other supporting files such as Excel
   spreadsheets or original artwork files.  
<p>
<pre>
   -rw-r--r--  1 brian       13176 Jul  9 06:28 09-Straights.tex
</pre>
<p>
   This is the TeX source for the article.  It is a
   human-readable, ASCII file, so you can still get the gist of
   an article by reading it if you don't have an implementation
   of TeX for typesetting the article.  **NOTE** if you process
   this file, you will get the text of the articles and any 
   equations and tables.  You will not get the figures.  The
   figures are available only to Mac users via the Textures file
   or to hardcopy users who print out the PostScript file.
<p>
<li>
What are the terms of the copyright?
<p>
   Anyone can download the files, print them, read them, give
   copies to your friends, etc.  I ask that you do not charge
   money if you give away copies.  I ask that you not change
   the articles.  Essentially, the articles are "copylefted:"
   use them freely, but do not restrict the access of anyone
   else to them by charging money or altering them.
  <p> 
   You are free to print them in your local
   autocrossing newsletter if you
<ul>
<li>
ask me first (email is OK, <a href="mailto:brianbec@microsoft.com">brianbec@microsoft.com</a>),
<br>
<li>
make sure you attribute them to me with my name and 
      address and copyright stuff in the printed version
      (make sure the blame gets to the right person),
<br>
<li>
send me copies of your newsletter.
<br>
</ul>
<p>
   These articles are already being published in at least four
   newsletters around the country and I have gotten generally
   positive reviews.  I've also generated some debates, which is
   great fun and really brings out the issues.  
<p>
</ul>
Hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them!
