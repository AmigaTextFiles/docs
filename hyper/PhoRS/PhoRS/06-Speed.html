The title of this month's article consists of two words dear to every 
racer's heart.  This month, we do some ``back of the envelope'' calculations 
to investigate the basic physics of speed and horsepower (the ``back of the 
envelope'' style of calculating was covered in part 3 of this series).
<P>
	How much horsepower does it take to go a certain speed?  At first 
blush, a physicist might be tempted to say ``none,'' because he or she 
remembers Newton's first law, by which an object moving at a constant 
speed in a straight line continues so moving forever, even to the end of the 
Universe, unless acted on by an external force.  Everyone knows, however, 
that it is necessary to keep your foot on the gas to keep a car moving at a 
constant speed.  Keeping your foot on the gas means that you are making 
the engine apply a backward force to the ground, which applies a reaction
force forward on the car, to keep the car moving.  In fact, we know a few
numbers from our car's shop manual.  A late  model Corvette, for example,
has a top speed of about 150 miles per hour and about 240 hp.  This means
that if you keep your foot <em>all</em> the way down, using up all 240 hp,
you can eventually go 150 mph.  It takes a while to get there.  In this
car, you can get to 60 mph in about 6 seconds (if you don't spin the drive
wheels), to 100 mph in about 15 seconds, and 150 in about a  minute.
<P>
	All this seems to contradict Newton's first law.  What is going on?  An 
automobile moving at constant speed in a straight line on level ground is, 
in fact, acted on by a number of external forces that tend to slow it down.  
Without these forces, the car <em>would</em> coast forever as guaranteed by
Newton's first law.   You must counteract these forces with the engine,
which indirectly creates a reaction force that
keeps the car going.   When the car is going at a constant speed, the <em>net</em> force on the car, that is, the speeding-up forces minus the
slowing-down forces, is zero.
<P>
	The most important external, slowing-down force is <em>air resistance</em> 
or <em>drag</em>.  The second most important force is friction between the
tires and the ground, the so-called <em>rolling resistance</em>.  Both these
forces are called <em>resistance</em> because they always act to oppose the
forward motion of the car in whatever direction it is going.  Another
physical effect that slows a car down is internal friction in the drive
train and wheel bearings.  Acting internally, these forces cannot slow the
car.  However, they push backwards on the tires, which push forward on the
ground, which pushes back by Newton's third law, slowing the car down. 
The internal friction forces are opposed by external reaction
forces, which act as slight braking forces, slowing the car.  So,
Newton and the Universe are safe; everything is working as it should.
<P>
	How big are the resistance forces, and what role does horsepower play? 
The physics of air resistance is very complex and an area of vigorous
research today.  Most of this research is done by the aerospace industry,
which is technologically very closely related to the automobile industry,
especially when it comes to racing.  We'll slog through some arithmetic
here to come up with a table that shows how much horsepower it takes to
sustain speed.  Those who don't have the stomach to go through the math
can skim the next few paragraphs.
<P>
We cannot derive equations for air
resistance here.  We'll just look them up.  My source is <em>Fluid
Mechanics</em>, by L. D.  Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, two eminent Russian
physicists.  They give the  following approximate formula: 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap148.xbm">
The factors in this equation are the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap160.xbm">
<DD>  coefficient of friction, a factor depending on the
shape of a car and  determined by experiment; for a
late model Corvette it is about 0.30;
    <DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap162.xbm">

calculate below;
    <DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap166.xbm">
<DD> speed of the car.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
	Let us calculate the density of air using ``back of the envelope'' 
methods.  We know that air is about 79%Nitrogen and 21%Oxygen.  We 
can look up the fact that Nitrogen has a molecular weight of about 28 and 
Oxygen has a molecular weight of about 32.  What is molecular weight?  It 
is the mass (not the weight, despite the name) of 22.4 liters of gas.  It is
a number of historical convention, just like feet and inches, and doesn't
have any real science behind it.  So, we figure that air has an average
molecular weight of
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap149.xbm">
I admit to using a calculator to do this calculation, against the spirit of the 
``back of the envelope'' style.  So sue me.
<P>
	We need to convert <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap168.xbm"> to pounds of mass per cubic
foot so that we can do the force calculations in familiar, if not
convenient, units.  It is worthwhile to note, as an aside, that a great deal
of the difficulty of doing calculations in the physics of racing has to do
with the traditional units of feet, miles, and pounds we use.  The metric
system makes all such calculations vastly simpler.  Napoleon Bonaparte
wanted to convert the world the metric system (mostly so his own soldiers
could do artillery calculations quickly in their heads) but it is still
not in common use in America nearly 200  years later!
<P>
	Again, we look up the conversion factors.  My source is <em>Engineering 
Formulas</em> by Kurt Gieck, but they can be looked up in almost any 
encyclopedia or dictionary.  There are 1000 liters in a cubic meter, which
in turn contains 35.51 cubic feet.  Also, a pound-mass contains 453.6
grams.  These figures give us, for the density of air
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap150.xbm">
<P>
	This says that a cubic foot of air weighs 8 hundredths of a pound, and 
so it does!  Air is much more massive than it seems, until you are moving 
quickly through it, that is.
<P>
	Let's finish off our equation for air resistance.  We want to fill in all 
the numbers except for speed, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap170.xbm">, using the Corvette as an example car so
that we can calculate the force of air resistance for a variety of
speeds.  We get
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap151.xbm">
We want, at the end, to have <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap170.xbm"> in miles per hour, but we need <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap170.xbm"> in feet
per seconds for the calculations to come out right.  We recall that there
are 22 feet per second for every 15 miles per hour, giving us
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_eqnarray*71.xbm"><P>
<P>
	Now (this gets confusing, and it wouldn't be if we were using the 
metric system), a pound mass is a phony unit.  A lb-mass is concocted to 
have a weight  of 1 pound under the action of the Earth's gravity.  Pounds 
are a unit of force or weight, not of mass.  We want our force of air 
resistance in pounds of force, so we have to divide 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap176.xbm">
by  32.1, numerically equal to the acceleration of Earth's gravity in 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap178.xbm">, to get pounds 
of force.  You just have to know these things.  This was a lot of work, but 
it's over now.  We finally get
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap152.xbm">
<P>
	Let's calculate a few numbers.  The following table gives the force of 
air resistance for a number of interesting speeds:
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tabular88.gif"><P>
<P>
We can see that the force of air resistance goes up rapidly with speed,
until we need over 350 pounds of constant force just to overcome drag at
150 miles per hour.  We can now show where horsepower comes in.
<P>
	Horsepower is a measure of <em>power</em>, which is a technical term in 
physics.  It measures the amount of work that a force does as it acts over 
time.  <em>Work</em> is another technical term in physics.  It measures the
actual effect of a force in moving an object over a distance.  If we move
an object one foot by applying a force of one pound, we are said to be
doing one foot-pound of work.  If it takes us one second to move
the object, we have exerted one foot-pound per second of power.  A
horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second.  It is another one of those
historical units that Napoleon hated and that has no reasonable origin in
science.
<P>
 We can expend one horsepower by exerting
550 pounds of force to move an object 1 foot in 1 second, or by exerting 1
pound of force to move an object 550 feet in 1 second, or by exerting 1
pound of force to move an object 1 foot in 0.001818 seconds, and so on. 
All these actions take the same amount of  power.  Incidentally, a
horsepower happens to be equal also to 745 watts.   So, if you burn about 8
light bulbs in your house, someone somewhere is expending at least one
horsepower (and probably more like four or five) in  electrical forces to
keep all that going for you, and you pay for the service  at the end of the
month!.
<P>
	All this means that to find out how much horsepower it takes to 
overcome air resistance at any speed, we need to multiply the force of air 
resistance by speed (in feet per second, converted from miles per hour), and 
divide by 550, to convert foot-lb/sec to horsepower.  The formula is
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tex2html_wrap153.xbm">
and we get the following numbers from the formula for a few interesting 
speeds.
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8387_tabular103.gif"><P>
<P>
I put 55 mph and 65 mph in this table to show why some people think that 
the 55 mph national speed limit saves gasoline.  It only requires about 7 hp 
to overcome drag at 55 mph, while it requires almost 12 hp to overcome 
drag at 65.  Fuel consumption is approximately proportional to 
horsepower expended.
<P>
More interesting to the racer is the fact that it takes 145 hp to 
overcome drag at 150 mph.  We know that our Corvette example car has 
about 240 hp, so about 95 hp must be going into overcoming rolling 
resistance and the slight braking forces arising from 
internal friction in the 
drive train and wheel bearings.  Race cars capable of going 200 mph 
usually have at least 650 hp, about 350 of which goes into overcoming air 
resistance.  It is probably possible to go 200 mph with a car in the
450-500  hp range, but such a car would have very good aerodynamics;
expensive, low-friction internal parts; and low rolling resistance tires,
which are designed to have the smallest possible contact patch like high
performance bicycle tires, and are therefore not good for handling.
