The cybernetic DWIM car is coming.  DWIM stands for ``Do What I
Mean.''<A NAME=tex2html1 HREF="12-Cybercar-foot.html#29"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>  
It is a commonplace term in the field of Human-machine
Interfaces, and refers to systems that automatically interpret the
user's intent from his or her inputs.
<P>
Cybernetics (or at least one aspect of it) is the science of
unifying humans and machines.  The objective of cybernetics is
usually to amplify human capability 
with `intelligent' machines, but
sometimes the objective is the reverse.  Most of the work in
cybernetics has been under the aegis of defense, for building
advanced tanks and aircraft.  There is a modest amount of
cybernetics in the automotive industry, as well.
Anti-lock Braking (ABS), Acceleration Slip Reduction (ASR),
Electronic Engine Management, and Automatic
Traction Control (ATC) are cybernetic 
DWIM systems---of a kind---already in production.  They all make
`corrections' on the driver's input based on an assumed intention. 
Steer-by-wire, Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT), and
active suspensions are on the immediate horizon.  All these
features are part of a distinct trend to automate the driving
experience.  This month, we take a break from hard physics to look
at the better and the worse of increased automation, and we look at
one concept of the ultimate result, CyberCar.
<P>
Among the research directions in cybernetics are advanced sensors
for human inputs.  One of the more incredible is a system that
reads brain waves and figures out what a fighter pilot wants to do
directly from patterns in the waves.
<P>
A major challenge in the fighter cockpit is information overload. 
Pilots have far too many instruments, displays, horns, buzzers,
radio channels, and idiot lights competing for their attention.  In
stressful situations, such as high speed dogfights, the pilot's
brain simply ignores inputs beyond its capacity, so the pilot may
not hear a critical buzzer or see a critical warning light.  In the
`intelligent cockpit,' however, the pilot <em> consciously</em>
suppresses certain displays and auditory channels, thus reducing
sensory clutter.  By the same token, the intelligent cockpit must
be able to override the pilot's choices and to put up critical
displays and to sound alarms in emergencies.  In the reduced
clutter of the cockpit, then, it is much less likely that a
pilot will miss critical information.
<P>
How does the pilot select the displays that he<A NAME=tex2html2 HREF="12-Cybercar-foot.html#31"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> wants to
see?  The pilot cannot afford the time to scroll through menus
like those on a personal computer screen or hunt-and-peck on a
button panel like that on an automatic bank teller machine.
<P>
There are already sensors that can read a pilot's brain waves and
anticipate what he  wants to look at next.  Before the pilot even
consciously knows that he wants to look at a weapon status display,
for example, the cybernetic system can infer the intention from his
brain waves and pop up the display.  If he thinks it is time to look
at the radar, before he could speak the command, the system
reads his brain waves, pops up the radar display, and puts away
the weapon status display.
<P>
How does it work?  During a training phase, the system reads brain
waves and gets explicit commands through a button panel.  The
system analyzes the brain waves, looking for certain unique
features that it can associate with the intention (inferred from
the command from the button panel) to see the radar display, and
other unique features to associate with the intention to look at
weapon status, and so on.  The system must be trained individually
for each pilot.   Later, during operation, whenever the system sees
the unique brain wave patterns, it `knows' what the pilot wants to
do.
<P>
The implications of technology like this for automobiles is
amazing.  Already, things like ABS are a kind of rudimentary
cybernetics.  When a driver stands all over the brake pedal, it is
assumed that his intention is to stop, not to skid.  The
ABS system `knows,' in a manner of speaking, the driver's intention
and manages the physical system of the car to accomplish that
goal.  So, instead of being a mere mechanical linkage between
your foot and the brakes, the brake pedal becomes a kind of
intentional, DWIM control.  Same goes for traction control and
ASR.  When the driver is on the gas, the system `knows' that he
wants to go forward, not to spin out or do doughnuts.  In the case
of TC, the system regulates the torque split to the drive wheels,
whether there be two or four.  In the case of ASR,
the system backs off the throttle when there is wheel spin. 
Cybernetics again.
<P>
ABS, TC, and ASR exist now.  What about the future?  Consider
steer-by-wire.  CyberCar, the total cybernetic car, infers the
driver's intended direction from the steering wheel position.  It
makes corrections to the actual direction of the steered wheels and
to the throttle and brakes much more quickly and smoothly
than any driver can do.  Coupled with 
slip angle<A NAME=tex2html3 HREF="12-Cybercar-foot.html#63"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> sensors
[<A HREF="12-Cybercar-node2.html#slipanglesensors">1</A>] and inertial guidance systems, perhaps
based on miniaturized laser/fiber optic gyros (no moving parts),
cybernetic steering, throttle, and brake controls will make up a
formidable racing car that could drive a course in practically
optimal fashion given only the driver's <em> desired</em> racing
line.
<P>
In an understeering situation, when a car is
not turning as much as desired, a common driver mistake is to
turn the steering wheel more.  That is a mistake, however, only
because the driver is treating the steering wheel as an <em>
intentional</em> control rather than the physical control it actually
is.  In CyberCar, however, the steering wheel <em> is</em> an
intentional control.  When the driver adds more lock in a corner,
CyberCar `knows' that the driver just wants more steering.  Near
the limits of adhesion, CyberCar knows that the appropriate <em>
physical</em> reaction is, in fact, some weight transfer to
the front, either by trailing throttle or a little braking, and a
little less steering wheel lock.  When the fronts hook up again,
CyberCar can immediately get back into the throttle and add a
little more steering lock, all the while tracking the driver's
desires through the intentional steering wheel in the cockpit. 
Similarly, in an oversteer situation, when the driver gives
opposite steering lock, CyberCar knows what to do.  First, CyberCar
determines whether the condition is trailing throttle oversteer
(TTO) or power oversteer (PO).  It can do this by monitoring tire
loads through suspension deflection and engine torque output over
time.  In TTO, CyberCar adds a little throttle and countersteers. 
When the drive wheels hook up again, it modulates the throttle and
dials in a little forward lock.  In PO, CyberCar gently trails off
the throttle and countersteers.  All the while, CyberCar monitors
driver's intentional inputs and the physical status of the car at
the rate of several kilohertz (thousands of times per second).
<P>
The very terms `understeer' and `oversteer' carry cybernetic
implication, for these are terms of intent.  Understeer means the
car is not steering as much as wanted, and oversteer 
means it is steering too much.
<P>
The above description is within current
technology.  What if we get <em> really</em> fantastic?  How about
doing away with the steering wheel altogether?  CyberCar, version
II, knows where the driver wants to go by watching his eyes, and it
knows whether to accelerate or brake by watching brain waves. 
With Virtual Reality and teleoperation, the driver does not
even have to be inside the car.  The driver, wearing binocular video
displays that control in-car cameras (or even synthetic computer
graphics) <em> via</em> head position, sits in a virtual cockpit in
the pits.
<P>
Now we must ask how much cybernetics is desirable? 
Autocrossing is, largely, a pure driver skill contest. 
Wheel-to-wheel racing adds racecraft---drafting, passing, 
deception, <em> etc.</em> ---to car control skills.  Does it not seem that
cybernetics eliminates driver skill as a factor by automating it? 
Is it not just another way for the `haves' to beat the `have-nots'
by out-spending them?  Drivers who do not have ABS have already
complained that it gives their competition an unfair advantage. 
On the other hand, drivers who <em> do</em> have it have complained 
that it reduces their feel of control and their options while
braking.  I think they doth protest too much.
<P>
In the highest forms of racing, where money is literally no
object, cybernetics is already playing a critical role.  The
clutch-less seven speed transmissions of the Williams/Renault team
dominated the latter half of the 1991 Formula 1 season.  But for
some unattributable bad luck, they would have won the driver's
championship and the constructor's cup.  Carrol Smith, noted
racing engineer, has been predicting for years that ABS will show
up in Formula 1 as soon as systems can be made small and light
enough [<A HREF="12-Cybercar-node2.html#Smith">2</A>].  It seems inevitable to me that cybernetic
systems will give the unfair advantage to those teams most awash
in money.  However, autocrossers, club racers, and other grass
roots competitors will be spared the expense, and the experience
of being relieved of the enjoyment of car control, for at least
another decade or two.
