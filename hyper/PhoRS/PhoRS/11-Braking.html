I was recently helping to crew Mark Thornton's effort at the 
Silver State Grand Prix in Nevada.  Mark had built a beautiful
car with a theoretical top speed of over 200 miles per hour 
for the 92 mile time trial from Lund to Hiko.  Mark had no 
experience driving at these speeds and asked me as a physicist
if I could predict what braking at 200 mph would be like.  This
month I report on the back-of-the-envelope calculations
on braking I did there in the field.
<P>
There are a couple of ways of looking at this problem.   Brakes work by
converting the energy of motion, <em>kinetic</em>energy, into the energy of
heat in the brakes.  Converting energy from useful forms (motion, electrical,
chemical, <em>etc.</em>) to heat is generally called <em>dissipating</em>the energy,
because there is no easy way to get it back from heat.   If we assume that
brakes dissipate energy at a constant rate, then we can immediately conclude
that it takes four times as much time to stop from 200 mph as from 100
mph.  The reason is that kinetic energy goes up as the square of the
speed.  Going at twice the speed means you have four times the kinetic energy
because <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap102.xbm">.  The exact formula for kinetic energy is
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap104.xbm">, where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap106.xbm"> is the mass of an object and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap112.xbm"> is its
speed.  This was useful to Mark because braking from 100 mph was within the
range of familiar driving experience.
<P>
That's pretty simple, but is it right?  Do brakes dissipate energy at a
constant rate?  My guess as a physicist is `probably not.'  The efficiency 
of the braking process, dissipation, will depend on details of the friction
interaction between the brake pads and disks.  That interaction is likely to
vary with temperature.  Most brake pads are formulated to grip harder when hot,
but only up to a point.  Brake fade occurs when the pads and rotors are
overheated.  If you continue braking, heating the system even more, the
brake fluid will eventually boil and there will be no braking at all.  Brake
fluid has the function of transmitting the pressure of your foot
on the pedal to the brake pads by hydrostatics.  If the fluid boils,
then the pressure of your foot on the pedal goes into crushing little bubbles
of gaseous brake fluid in the brake lines rather than into crushing the pads
against the disks.  Hence, no brakes.
<P>
We now arrive at the second way of looking at this problem.  Let us assume
that we have good brakes, so that the braking process is limited
<em>not</em>by the interaction between the pads and disks but by the
interaction between the tires and the ground.  In other words, let us assume
that our brakes are better than our tires.  To keep things simple and
back-of-the-envelope, assume that our tires will give us a constant
deceleration of 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap96.xbm">
The time <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap110.xbm"> required for braking from speed <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap112.xbm"> can be calculated from:
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap97.xbm">
which simply follows from the definition of constant acceleration.  Given the
time for braking, we can calculate the distance <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap114.xbm">, again from the
definitions of acceleration and velocity: <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap98.xbm">
Remembering to be careful about converting miles per hour to feet per second,
we arrive at the numbers in Table 1.
<P>
<A NAME=75><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="icons/invis_anchor.xbm"></A><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9497_table39.gif"><P>
<P>
We can immediately see from this table (and, indeed, from the formulas)
that it is the <em>distance</em>, not the time, that varies as the square of 
the starting speed v.  The braking time only goes up linearly with speed, that
is, in simple proportion.
<P>
The numbers in the table are in the ballpark of the braking figures one
reads in published tests of high performance cars, so I am inclined to
believe that the second way of looking at the problem is the right way.  In
other words, the assumption that the brakes are better than the tires, so long
as they are not overheated, is probably right, and the assumption that
brakes dissipate energy at a constant rate is probably wrong because it leads
to the conclusion that braking takes more time than it actually does.
<P>
My final advice to Mark was to leave <em>lots of room</em>.  You can see from the
table that stopping from 210 mph takes well over a quarter mile of very
hard, precise, threshold braking at 1<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_7417_tex2html_wrap116.xbm">!
