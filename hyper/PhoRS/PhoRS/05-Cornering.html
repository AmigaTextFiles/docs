This month, we analyze the best way to go through a corner.  
``Best'' means in the least time, at the greatest average speed.  We 
ask ``what is the shape of the driving line through the corner that 
gives the best time?'' and ``what are the times for some other 
lines, say hugging the outside or the inside of the corner?''  
Given the answers to these questions, we go on to ask ``what shape 
does a corner have to be before the driving line I choose doesn't 
make any time difference?''  The answer is a little surprising.
<P>
The analysis presented here is the simplest I could come up with, 
and yet is still quite complicated.  My calculations went through 
about thirty steps before I got the answer.  Don't worry, I won't 
drag you through the mathematics; I just sketch out the analysis, 
trying to focus on the basic principles.  Anyone who would read 
through thirty formulas would probably just as soon derive them 
for him or herself.
<P>
There are several simplifying assumptions I make to get through 
the analysis.  First of all, I consider the corner in isolation; 
as an abstract entity lifted out of the rest of a course.  The 
actual best driving line through a corner depends on what comes 
before it and after it.  You usually want to optimize exit speed 
if the corner leads onto a straight.  You might not apex if 
another corner is coming up.  You may be forced into an 
unfavorable entrance by a prior curve or slalom.
<P>
Speaking of road courses, you will hear drivers say things like 
``you have to do such-and-such in turn six to be on line for turn 
ten and the front straight.''  In other words, actions in any one 
spot carry consequences pretty much all the way around.  The 
ultimate drivers figure out the line for the entire course and 
drive it as a unit, taking a Zen-like approach.  When learning, it 
is probably best to start out optimizing each kind of corner in 
isolation, then work up to combinations of two corners, three 
corners, and so on.  In my own driving, there are certain kinds of 
three corner combinations I know, but mostly I work in twos.  I 
have a long way to go.
<P>
It is not feasible to analyze an actual course in an exact, 
mathematical way.  In other words, although science can provide 
general principles and hints, finding the line is, in practice, an 
art.  For me, it is one of the most fun parts of racing.
<P>
Other simplifying assumptions I make are that the car can either 
accelerate, brake, or corner at constant speed, with abrupt 
transitions between behaviors.  Thus, the lines I analyze are 
splices of accelerating, braking, and cornering phases.  A real 
car can, must, and should do these things in combination and with 
smooth transitions between phases.  It is, in fact, possible to do 
an exact, mathematical analysis with a more realistic car that 
transitions smoothly, but it is much more difficult than the 
splice-type analysis and does not provide enough more quantitative 
insight to justify its extra complexity for this article.
<P>
Our corner is the following ninety-degree right-hander:
<P>
<P><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_figure30.gif"><P>}
<P>This figure actually represents a family of corners with any 
constant width, any radius, and short straights before and after.  
First, we go through the entire analysis with a particular corner 
of 75 foot radius and 30 foot width, then we end up with times for 
corners of various radii and widths.
<P>
Let us define the following parameters:
<DL COMPACT><DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap113.xbm">
<DD> radius of corner center line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap115.xbm"> feet
	<DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap117.xbm">
<DD> width of course = 30 feet
	<DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap119.xbm">
<DD> radius of outer edge <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap121.xbm">
feet
	<DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap123.xbm">
<DD> radius of inner edge <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap125.xbm"> feet
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Now, when we drive this corner, we must keep the tires on the 
course, otherwise we get a lot of cone penalties (or go into the 
weeds).  It is easiest (though not so realistic) to do the 
analysis considering the path of the center of gravity of the car 
rather than the paths of each wheel.  So, we define an <em>effective</em> course, narrower than the real course, down which we may
drive the  center of the car.  
<DL COMPACT><DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap127.xbm">
<DD> width of car <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap129.xbm"> feet
	<DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap131.xbm">
<DD> effective outer radius <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap133.xbm"> feet
	<DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap135.xbm">
<DD> effective inner radius <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap137.xbm"> feet
	<DT><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap139.xbm">
<DD> effective width of course <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap141.xbm"> feet
<P>
 </DL>
This course is indicated by the labels and the thick radius lines 
in the figure.
<P>
From last month's article, we know that for a fixed centripetal 
acceleration, the maximum driving speed increases as the square 
root of the radius.  So, if we drive the largest possible circle 
through the effective corner, starting at the outside of the 
entrance straight, going all the way to the inside in the middle 
of the corner (the <em>apex</em>), and ending up at the outside of the
exit  straight, we can corner at the maximum speed.  Such a line is 
shown in the figure as the thick circle labeled ``line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.''  This is 
a simplified version of the classic racing line through the 
corner.  Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> reaches the apex at the geometrical center of the 
circle, whereas the classic racing line reaches an apex after the 
geometrical center-a <em>late</em> apex-because it assumes we are 
accelerating out of the corner and must therefore have a 
continuously increasing radius in the second half and a slightly 
tighter radius in the first half to prepare for the acceleration.  
But, we continue analyzing the geometrically perfect line because 
it is relatively easy.  The figure shows also Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm">, the <em>inside</em> line, which come  up the inside of the entrance straight,
corners on the inside, and  goes down the inside of the exit straight;
and Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap215.xbm">, the <em>outside</em> line, which comes up the outside,
corners on the outside, and exits on the outside.
<P>
One might argue that there are certain advantages of line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> over 
line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.  Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> is considerably shorter than Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">, and
although  we have to go slower through the corner part, we have less
total  distance to cover and might get through faster.  Also, we can 
accelerate on part of the entrance chute and all the way on the 
exit chute, while we have to drive line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> at constant speed.  
Let's find out how much time it takes to get through lines <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> and 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.  We include line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap215.xbm"> for completeness, even though it looks bad 
because it is both slower and longer than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.
<P>
If we assume a maximum centripetal acceleration of 1.10g, which
is  just within the capability of autocross tires, we get the 
following speeds for the cornering phases of Lines <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm">, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap215.xbm">, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">:
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tabular52.gif"><P>
<P>
Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> is all cornering, so we can easily calculate the time to 
drive it once we know the radius, labeled <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap189.xbm"> in the figure.  A 
geometrical analysis results in 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap109.xbm">
and the time is
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap110.xbm">
<P>
For line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm">, we accelerate for a bit, brake until we reach
32.16  mph, corner at that speed, and then accelerate on the
exit.  Let's  assume, to keep the comparison fair, that we have timing
lights at  the beginning and end of line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> and that we can begin
driving line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> at 48.78 mph, the same speed that we can drive line
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.  Let us  also assume that the car can accelerate at
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap199.xbm">g and brake at 1g.   Our driving plan for
line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> results in the following velocity  profile:
<P>
<P><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_figure70.gif"><P>}
<P>Because we can begin by accelerating, we start beating line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> a 
little.  We have to brake hard to make the corner.  Finally, 
although we accelerate on the exit, we don't quite come up to 
48.78 mph, the exit speed for line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.  But, we don't care
about  exit speed, only time through the corner.  Using the velocity 
profile above, we can calculate the time for line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm">, call it <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap209.xbm">, 
to be 4.08 seconds.  Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> loses by 9/10ths of a second.  It
is a  fair margin to lose an autocross by this much over a whole
course,  but this analysis shows we can lose it in just one typical
corner!   In this case, line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> is a catastrophic mistake. 
Incidentally,  line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap215.xbm"> takes 4.24 seconds <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap217.xbm">.
<P>
What if the corner were tighter or of greater radius?  The 
following table shows some times for 30 foot wide corners of 
various radii:
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tabular76.gif"><P>
<P>
Line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> <em>never</em> beats line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> even though that as the radius 
increases, the margin of loss decreases.  The trend is intuitive 
because corners of greater radius are also longer and the extra 
speed in line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> over line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> is less.  The margin is greatest for 
tight corners because the width is a greater fraction of the 
length and the speed differential is greater.
<P>
How about for various widths?  The following table shows times for 
a 75 foot radius corner of several widths:
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tabular82.gif"><P>
<P>
The wider the course, the greater the margin of loss.  This is,
again,  intuitive since on a wide course, line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> is a really large
circle  through even a very tight corner.  Note that line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap215.xbm"> becomes
better  than line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> for wide courses.  This is because the speed 
differential between lines <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap215.xbm"> and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> is very great for wide
courses.   The most notable fact is that line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm"> beats line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap207.xbm"> by
0.16 seconds  even on a course that is only four feet wider than
the car!  You  really must ``use up the whole course.''
<P>
So, the answer is, under the assumptions made, that the inside 
line is <em>never</em> better than the classic racing line.  For the 
splice-type car behavior assumed, I conjecture that <em>no</em> line is 
faster than line <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_8119_tex2html_wrap229.xbm">.
<P>
We have gone through a simplified kind of <em>variational
analysis</em>.   Variational analysis is used in all branches of physics, 
especially mechanics and optics.  It is possible, in fact, to 
express all theories of physics, even the most arcane, in
variational  form, and many physicists find this form very appealing. 
It is  also possible to use variational analysis to write a computer 
program that finds an approximately perfect line through a 
complete, realistic course.
