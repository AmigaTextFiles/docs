In many ways, tire mechanics is an unpleasant topic.  It is shrouded in
uncertainty, controversy, and trade secrecy.  Both theoretical and
experimental studies are extremely difficult and expensive.  
It is probably the most
uncontrollable variable in racing today.  As such, it is
the source of many highs and lows.  An improvement in modeling or
design, even if it is found by lucky accident, can lead to several years of
domination by one tire company, as with BFGoodrich in autocrossing now.  An
unfortunate choice of tire by a competitor can lead to frustration and a
disastrous hole in the budget.
<P>
This month, we investigate the physics of tire adhesion a little more
deeply than in the past.  In Parts 2, 4, and 7, we used the simple
friction model given by <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap69.xbm">, where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap63.xbm"> is the maximum
traction force available from a tire; <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap65.xbm">, assumed constant, is the
coefficient of friction; and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap67.xbm"> is the instantaneous vertical load, or
weight, on a tire.  While this model is adequate for a rough,
intuitive feel for tire behavior, it is grossly inadequate for
quantitative use, say, for the computer program we began in Part 8 or for
race car engineering and set up.
<P>
I am not a tire engineer. 
As always, I try to give a fresh look at any topic from a physicist's
point of view.  I may write things that are heretical or even wrong,
especially on such a difficult topic as tire mechanics.  I invite debate and
corrections from those more knowledgeable than I.  Such interaction is part
of the fun of these articles for me.
<P>
I call this month's topic `grip angle.'  The grip angle is a quantity that
captures, for many purposes, the complex and subtle mechanics of a tire. 
Most writers call this quantity `slip angle.'  I think this name is
misleading because it suggests that a tire works by slipping and sliding. 
The truth is more complicated.  Near maximum loads, the contact
patch is partly gripping and partly slipping.  
The maximum net force a tire can 
yield occurs at the threshold where the tire is still gripping but is just
about to give way to total slipping.  Also, I have some difficulties with
the analyses of slip angle in the literature.  I will 
present these difficulties in these articles, unfortunately, probably
without resolution.  For these reasons, I give the quantity a new name.
<P>
A tire is an elastic or deformable body.  It delivers forces to the car by
stretching, compressing, and twisting.  It is thus a very complex sort of
spring with several different ways, or <em>modes</em>, of deformation.  The
hypothetical tire implied by <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap69.xbm"> with constant <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap65.xbm">
would be a non-elastic tire.  Anyone who has driven  hard tires on ice
knows that non-elastic tires are basically uncontrollable, not just because
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap65.xbm"> is small but because regular tires on ice do not twist
appreciably.
<P>
The first and most obvious mode of derformation is radial.  This
deformation is along the radius of the tire, the line from the center to
the tread.  It is easily visible as a bulge in the sidewall near the
contact patch, where the tire touches the ground.  Thus, radial compression
varies around the circumference.
<P>
Second is circumferential deformation.  This is most easily visble as
wrinkling of the sidewalls of drag tires.  These tires are intentionally
set up to deform dramatically in the circumferential direction.
<P>
Third is axial deformation.  This is a deflection that tends to pull the
tire off the (non-elastic) wheel or rim.
<P>
Last, and most important for cornering, is <em>torsional</em> deformation. 
This is a difference in axial deflection from the front to the back of the
contact patch.  Fundamentally, radial, circumferential, and axial
deformation furnish a complete description of a tire.  But it is very useful
to consider the <em>differences</em>in these deflections around the
circumference.
<P>
Let us examine exactly how a tire 
delivers cornering force to the car.  We can get a good intuition 
into the physics with a pencil eraser. 
Get a block eraser, of the rectangular kind like `Pink Pearl' or
`Magic Rub.'  Stand it up on a table or desk and think of it as a little
segment of the circumference of a tire.  Think of the part touching the
desk as the contact patch.  Grab the top of the eraser and think of your
hand as the wheel or rim, which is going to push, pull, and twist on the
segment of tire circumference as we go along the following analysis.
<P>
Consider a car traveling at speed
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_9409_tex2html_wrap75.xbm"> in a straight line.  Let us turn the steering wheel slightly to the
right (twist the top of the eraser to the right).  At the instant we begin
turning, the rim (your hand on the eraser), at a circumferential position
just behind the contact patch, pushes slightly leftward on the bead of the
tire.  Just ahead of the contact patch, likewise, the rim pulls the bead a
little to the right.  The push and pull together are called a <em>force
couple</em>.  This couple delivers a torsional, clockwise stress to the inner
part of the tire carcass, near the bead.  This stress is communicated to
the contact patch by the elastic material in the sidewalls (or the main
body of the eraser).  As a result of turning the steering wheel, therefore,
the rim twists the contact patch clockwise.
<P>
The car is still going straight, just for an instant.  How are we going to
explain a net rightward force from the road on the contact patch?  This net
force <em>must</em>be there, otherwise the tire and the car would continue
in a straight line by Newton's First Law.
<P>
Consider the piece of road just under the contact patch at the
instant the turn begins.  The rubber particles on the left side of the
patch are going a little bit faster with respect to the road than the rest
of the car and the rubber particles on the right side of the patch are
going a little bit slower than the rest of the car.  As a result, the left
side of the patch grips a little bit less than the right.  The rubber
particles on the left are more likely to slide and the ones on the right
are more likely to grip.  Thus, the left edge of the patch `walks' a
little bit upward, resulting in a net clockwise twisting motion of the
patch.  The torsional stress becomes a torsional motion.  As this motion
is repeated from one instant to the next, the tire (and the eraser-I
hope you are still following along with the eraser) walks continuosly to the
right.
<P>
The better grip on the right hand side of the contact patch adds up
to a net rightward force on the tire, which is transmitted back through the
sidewall to the car.  The chassis of the car begins to yaw to the right,
changing the direction of the rear wheels.  A torsional stress on the rear
contact patches results, and the rear tires commence a similar `walking'
motion.
<P>
The wheel (your hand) is twisted more away from the direction of the car
than is the contact patch.  The angular difference between the direction
the wheel is pointed and the direction the tire walks is
the grip angle.  All quantities of interest in tire mechanics-forces,
friction coefficients, <em>etc.</em>, are conventionally expressed as functions of
grip angle.
<P>
In steady state cornering, as in sweepers, an understeering car
has larger grip angles in front, and an oversteering car has larger grip
angles in the rear.  How to control grip angles statically with wheel
alignment and dynamically with four-wheel steering are subjects for later
treatment.
<P>
The greater the grip angle, the larger the cornering force becomes, up to
a point.  After this point, greater grip angle delivers less force.  This
point is analogous to the idealized adhesive limit mentioned earlier in this
series.  Thus, a real tire behaves <em>qualitatively</em>like an ideal
tire, which grips until the adhesive limit is exceeded and then slides. 
A real tire, however, grips gradually better as cornering force
increases, and then grips gradually worse as the limit is exceeded.
<P>
The walking motion of the contact patch is not entirely smooth, or in
otherwords, somewhat <em>discrete</em>.  Individual blocks of rubber
alternately grip and slide at high frequency, thousands of times per
second.  Under hard cornering, the rubber blocks vibrating on the road
make an audible squaling sound.  Beyond the
adhesive limit, squealing becomes a lower frequency sound, `squalling,' as
the point of optimum efficiency of the walking process is bypassed.
<P>
There is a lot more to say on this subject, and I admit that my first
attempts at a mathematical analysis of grip angle and contact patch
mechanics got bogged down.  However, I think we now have an intuitive,
conceptual basis for better modeling in the future.
<P>
Speaking of the future, 
summarize briefly the past of and plans for the <em>Physics of Racing</em>series.   The following overlapping threads run through it:
<DL ><DT>Tire Physics
<DD> concerns adhesion, grip angle, and elastic modeling. 
This has been covered in Parts 2, 4, 7, and 10, and will be covered in
several later parts.
  <DT>Car Dynamics
<DD> concerns handling, suspension movement,
and motion of a car around a course; has been covered in Parts 1, 4, 5,
and 8 and will continue. 
  <DT>Drive Line Physics
<DD> concerns modeling of engine performance and
acceleration.  Has been covered in Parts 3, 6, and 9 and will also
continue.  
  <DT>Computer Simulation
<DD> concerns the design of a working program that
captures all the physics.  This is the ultimate goal of the series.  It
was begun in Part 8 and will eventually dominate discussion.

<P>
 </DL>
<P>
In practice, I try to keep the lengths of articles about the same, so if a
topic is getting too long (and grip angle definitely did), I break it up
in to several articles.
