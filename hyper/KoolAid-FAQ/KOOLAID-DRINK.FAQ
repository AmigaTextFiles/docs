A Tribute to alt.drinks.kool-aid:
---------------------------------
"Wow!

"I don't actually drink KA (or I haven't regularly, I think I'm
gonna start) but I was cruising the infohighway and your newsgroup
looked kinda kooky so I decided to check it out...WOW!  This is the
nicest, giddiest, neatest newsgroup I've ever read!  People on UseNet
are usually so quick to anger...I think they just post when they need
to vent for whatever reason.  In any case, UseNet is almost NEVER a
nice, relaxed type atmosphere.  This group is a glorious exception.
Is it the KA that does it to y'all?..maybe I oughta try some...

"Kudos!"

-from a net surfer who stumbled across our wonderful group.

I. Where does Kool-Aid come from?
---------------------------------
The following was posted by Ron Gregory, who obtained it from Kraft
General Foods.  Additions were made by Lynn Wiegard, Jane Murray and Doug
Adcock.

"When he was just 11, Edwin Perkins had the idea of becoming a
businessman.  He sent for a pamphlet called 'How To Become a
Manufacturer.'  It must have inspired him, for some 20 years later he
was running a 125-product line business out of Hastings, Nebraska.  The
line ran the gamut from perfumes and toothpaste to flavorings and
household products.  But the most popular item was a small bottle of
flavored syrup called Fruit Smack.

"This soft drink syrup was expensive to market because transportation
and glass breakage added heavily to the costs of manufacturing and
advertising.  So in 1927 Perkins decided to remove the water and
bottle and offer the concentrated beverage powder in convenient
envelopes.

He also changed the name to Kool-Ade.  The name was soon altered again, to
the now familiar Kool-Aid.  This attempt at changing the name ran into
difficulty, as in 1914 a Lewis, Iowa based Drug Store owner and Chemist
named Jake Ross invented and patented a little known lemon flavored
drink, which he called "Kool-Aid".  Perkins bought the patent off of Ross,
and the current incarnation of Kool-Aid was founded.

A few years later the company moved to Chicago and discontinued all other
products to turn its attention entirely to Kool-Aid instant soft drink
mix. By 1939, the Perkins Chicago factory was doubled and additional
employees were hired.

"In 1953 the Perkins Products Company became part of General Foods
Corporation.  About that time, print ads for Kool-Aid mixes showed the
soft drink in a large pitcher with a design drawn on the surface
condensation -- a heart, a 5-cent symbol or a smiling face.  The
smile became the favorite, and from 1954 it was used on pitchers in
all advertising.  It was also in 1954 that Kool-Aid began being produced
and distributed in Canada.  When presweetened Kool-Aid came out in
1964, the package carried an illustration of the now well-known rounded
pitcher with the smiling face.  At that time both the shape and the
smile were registered.

"As the demand for Kool-Aid increased, additions have been made to
the original line of six flavors.  There are flavored mixes to be
dissolved with sugar in water and ice.  There are also sugar-
sweetened mixes, available in packages and canisters.  Kool-Aid sugar
free mixes, sweetened with NutraSweet, come in both packages and
canisters. And now we have Kool-Aid Koolers, ready-to-drink juice
drinks, in convenient 8.5 ounce containers."

The six original flavors were Grape, Lemon Lime, Cherry, Orange,
Raspberry, and Strawberry.

A slightly different version of this story is available at
[http://www.greasyspoon.com/koolaid/story.html]
http://www.greasyspoon.com/koolaid/story.html
It was provided by Doug Adcock (douga@ntrnet.net) and comes from a 1950's
Kool-Aid tour pamphlet.

II.  What about flavors?
-------------------------
Not all current flavors are available in all areas.  Pina-Pineapple, for
example, seems to have limited availability in the US and is not found in
Canada at all.  Flavors marked US are only available in the United
States.  There are also flavors marked "Mexico" and "Canada"  Flavors
that are unmarked indicate that the flavor is available in all three
countries.

Special thanks to Ron Gregory, Lynn Wiegard and Dr. Christopher
Hollinshed, for providing the discontinued flavors, as well as Kevin
Whalen, Gary Boltralik and Christine Jean Lee for their
invaluable contributions.  Lynn Wiegard is also responsible for the
seasonal flavor list.

Blastin' Berry Cherry  (US)
Cherry   (US, Canada, Russia, Phillipines, Venezuela)

NOTE: "Frutas" is Spanish for "Fruit".  This could also mean "Punch".
Also, Pina-Pinapple is available in Mexico under the name "Pina" which
translated into English is "Pineapple".  Lastly, "Guarana" is the name of
a plant found in Brazil.  Presumably, that flavor tastes like that plant.

+ Also, recent product introductions have included Kool-Aid Splash which
+ is premade Kool-Aid is sports bottle containers and Kool-Aid Slushies
+ that you put in your freezer.

Seasonal Flavors
-----------------

the US, and "Hallowe'en Kool" instead of "Kool-Aid" in Canada.
Eerie Orange (CAN)
Scary Black Cherry (CAN)
Scary Blackberry (US)

Kraft has finally confirmed that Hallowe'en Cools are now a *permanent*
item, and they should be available from now on, each year, from Oct 1 -
Nov 5.  There are no plans to expand the Hallowe'en Cool flavor lineup.

Mexican Flavor Information  (Gary Boltralik - Boltralg@AEPCO.com)
---------------------------
All the KA sold in Mexico (per the person who bought it for me) comes
in boxes of 5 packs.  This includes the Cola flavor.  I have a Cola
box containing only the Cola flavor.  If Cola was sold as a
promotional flavor at one point, it would appear to be a current
flavor now.

Reason's for the Discontinuation of Flavors
--------------------------------------------
prex@golden.net (Lynn M Wiegard)

According to K/GF, a lot of flavors are discontinued because they are too
similar to exisiting flavors.  After all, every flavor available in a
grocery store takes up about 1-1/2 feet of shelf space.  Grocery chains
may not be into devoting more space to something like SFP when they
already carry Strawberry.  Thus, even before the flavor hits the shelves
(i.e. before any consumer input), a decision about the success of the
flavor has already been made :-(

I think that may be the case with a lot of the berry KA's that have been
discontinued over time.

Sometimes, too, it's not even the grocer's decision, but that of the
wholesaler who sells to the grocer.  ...And K/GF has no control over all
these decisions.

If there is a flavor that you *know* is still produced, but missing from
the shelves of your grocery, rattle the chains at the buying office for
your store.  Sadly, this may get you Lime or Strawberry, hard to find in
parts--but will not bring back SFP, Bluedini, P. Rex, or anything else
that has been *discontinued*.

K/GF will probably not resurrect any flavor deemed "too similar", simply
because of the concerns related to getting it on the shelf.  The blue
stuff--well, that's a different story [note the post re: safety concerns].

I personally think a lot of the discontinued flavors fell victim in the
war for shelf space, without fault to the consumer or K/GF.

Resurrecting Flavors        Jaye <jaelithe@earthlink.net>
--------------------
The young woman I spoke to told me that if they get enough complaints
about a flavor being killed off, they will resurrect it. So tell everyone
who loves raspberry (or any other discontinued flavor) Kool-Aid to call
1-800-367-9225 (in the USA) or 1-800-268-7808 (In Canada) between 9am-4pm
EST and complain politely.

---
Notes on the discontinuation of Berry Blue and Great Bluedini:  Several
sources have indicated that Berry Blue was discontinued because of
parental concerns that those flavors looked too much like toxic
substances, and could encourage kids to poison themselves.  Berry Blue was
discontinued because it allegedly looked too much like Winshield washer
fluid.  Great Bluedini was similarly discontinued because it looked too
much like anti-freeze.

This just in from George Eggleston (jester@txdirect.net) and Lynn Weigard
(prex@golden.net):
Just wanted to point out:  Berry Blue is "back" as a US Island Twist
flavor:  a blue raspberry lemonade called Ice Blue Island Twist!
I asked Kraft up here if there were any plans to bring the flavor to
Canada, and they said they want to wait and see how it does.

Other Kool-Aid Products   From: Lynn Wiegard <prex@golden.net>
------------------------

Kool-Aid Bubble Gum
Kool-Aid Ice Cream Mix
Kool-Aid Shake Mix

III.  How do you prepare Kool-Aid?
----------------------------------
This section is devoted to the technique involved in mixing up our
favourite beverage.  Send in your method and I'll stick it in.

A. First, I grab one of those empty two quart ocean spray cranberry
   juice bottle (or any other kind with that shape).  Then I dump in
   the Kool stuff, then the sucre, then put in water (I recommend
   Reverse Osmosis water, because it doesn't add any nasty flavor to
   the perfection of Kool-Aid) almost to the top.  Then I do a little
   shaky dance until it's bubbly at the top, and pop it in the fridge
   Or, if I'm really thirsty, I just chug that warm Kool-Aid out of
   the bottle.  mmmmmmmmmmmm, good.

  -by MUZAK

B. I make Kool-Aid in the sacred traditions of my ancestors.  First I
   get my one gallon jug (ocean spray), then I add about two cups of
   sugar (never measure, always estimate) next I fill the bottle two
   thirds of the way full.  After replacing the lid I shake the
   bottle until all of the sugar is dissolved.  Then I remove the
   lid and add Kool-Aid, one packet at a time.  You may want to
   add more sugar at this point.  If you are up for a very special
   treat, add a teaspoon of salt....yes salt.  Salt makes the
   flavor more intense.  Let it sit for one hour, and
   enjoy.....and hey, if you squint it looks purple.

  -by Peter White

C. 1. Start with a pitcher that still has the last droplets of your
      last batch of Kool-Aid. (If you are not in possesion of said
      pitcher then put a tiny bit of water into your dry pitcher
      before you continue)
   2. Add the Kool-Aid powder
   3. Add the sugar
   4. Fill the pitcher 1/3 of the way full with *warm* water. (Yes
      this means you might wanna stick it into the fridge prior to
      drinking, but were talking just tap water warm, not hot)
   5. Stir, shake, etc to mix up the sugar, Kool-Aid powder and
      water.
   6. Then add the rest of the water (preferably as cold and pure
      (ie: not from the tap) as possible).
   7. [optional:] Place in fridge to cool
   8. Chug away...

  -by Andy

D.   --- Here is the way I make Kool-Aid,
	-One plastic Happy Face Pitcher
	-two-thirds cup of sugar
	-one packet of the Kool-Aid (flavor of choice)
   *Add the Kool-Aid and the sugar, and shake it like you were sauteeing it.
    Mixing the Flavor and the sugar equally.
   *Then add a little bit of Hot tap water to make a syrupy mixture.
   *Fill with icy cold water and Ice cubes, just to above the eyebrows.
    As you pour it to drink the ice gets stuck in the spout and the Kool-Aid
    trickles out around it making it nice and chilled.
   *Enjoy.

+ E. I'm now in my mid-40's but when I was a kid (back in the 50's), my
+    dad always made the Kool-Aid in our house.  For many years I didn't
+    know why Kool-Aid at any of my friends houses always tasted so bland
+    and different.  I had always helped him make it, but I was probably
+    around 10 years old before I finally asked my him why ours tasted so
+    different.  I'd never noticed before that we weren't making it
+    according to the package directions.  It's funny, but I've never run
+    across anyone since either that made it like we did.  But I think
+    anyone who tries it may NEVER go back to the original method.  So
+    here it is:
+
+    "Frank B. Anderson's Secret Kool-Aid Recipe."
+
+    Take whatever 2-qt contain you usually use to make your Kool-Aid,
+    and whatever flavor of unsweetened Kool-Aid you prefer.  (If you do
+    use a pre-sweetened version, you should be able to figure out how to
+    substitute.)  Start by adding 4 Cups of tepid to warm water into
+    your container. Then, add your favorite flavor of Kool-Aid to your
+    regular amount of sugar (we always used 1 Cup) and mix (this keeps
+    the Kool-Aid from clumping). Slowly pour the mixture into the
+    container of water while stirring, and/or shake well until at least
+    most of the sugar is dissolved.
+
+    Now for the secret ingredient!!
+
+    Add 2 Cups of your favorite brand of Ginger Ale (if you like Diet
+    Ginger Ale, that's fine too).  NOTE: do not start with the ginger
+    ale because adding the sugar mix to it will foam up and possibly
+    overflow!!
+
+    Then, fill the container to the 2 qt. level with ice and refrigerate
+    at least an hour before serving.  If you're in a rush, here's what
+    we used to do.  Instead of topping off the container with ice, fill
+    your glasses with ice and pour the Kool-Aid mix over the ice as is.
+
+    Note: the only flavors I didn't like as well with this recipe was
+    the old Root Beer flavor (long since disscontinued) and any of the
+    Lemonade flavors.  But feel free to experiment, you may like it.
+
+    Additional Note:  As an "Adult Drink" my dad also used to substitute
+    1 Cup of Water with a cup of Gin.  His favorite flavors for this was
+    either Cherry or Lemon-Lime.  But remember too, this was back in the
+    50's and early 60's before many of the newer flavors existed, so
+    again feel free to experiment here too.  I Hope everyone Enjoys this
+    recipe as much as I have almost my entire life!!
+
+ Submitted by Robert B. Anderson

+ F. Jonadab's Way -
+
+   I use a 1-gallon jug.  Upon drinking the last bit of skim milk,
+    *immediately* rinse the jug three times, filling it 1/3 full with
+    water each time, shaking it, and then dumping it.  By this time
+    the water from the tap should be sufficiently cold.  Fill the jug
+    1/3 full a fourth time, but do not dump.  Instead, insert a small
+    funnel in the top.  Into the funnel pour the contents of exactly
+    two packets of Kool-Aid, any flavour(s).  Follow that with 1-1/2
+    cups of granulated white sucrose.  Then fill each empty packet with
+    water three times and pour that into the funnel.  Pour a little
+    more water through the funnel until no more colour is present in
+    the funnel.  Remove the funnel and place it in a handy location
+    for next time.  Cap off the jug and shake it vigorously until
+    everything is thoroughly dissolved.  Open it.  If both KA packets
+    were Lemonade or Lemon-Lime, add a swish of lemon juice at this
+    point.  Now, fill the jug almost to the top with water, cap, and
+    shake just a bit more.  Pour into 32oz cup over ice; put the jug
+    containing the rest of it in the fridge.  Drink.

In addition to official a.d.k-a polls, there is now a Kool-Aid voting
booth on the WWW.  Matt's "Hey Kool-Aid!" Page has its own Kool-Aid
voting booth, so if a poll is not being run by a.d.k-a, go to his site
and cast a ballot!  ([http://www.arc.miami.edu/matt/koolaid.htm]
http://www.arc.miami.edu/matt/koolaid.htm)

Lastly, it should be noted that the favourite flavor of Kool-Aid
inventor Edwin Perkins was Raspberry (now discontinued).  This is
according to his great nephew, Stephen Spady (sspady@microsoft.com).

V.  What does that code on the package mean?
---------------------------------------------
Once again, Ron Gregory is to thank, along with Bernard Marrocco.

The first four NUMBERS in the code indicate the date.  The first
indicates the year (ie. 4 for 1994, 0 for 1990 etc).  The next three
numbers are the day of the year it was produced (ie. 001 for Jan 1 up to
365 for Dec 31). The letter indicates place of production.  In the US,
Chicago is represented by A, EV is for Evanston, Illinois, and M for
Modesto, California.  In Canada CO stands for Cobourg Ontario.

VI.  Can I dye my hair with Kool-Aid?
-------------------------------------
Several methods of using Kool-Aid to dye hair have been proposed.

Method # 1

    -In a large bowl (a little bigger than your head) put in hot water
     and Kool-Aid.  The longer your hair the more packets you need:  for
     shoulder length try 3.
    -Dunk your head in the bowl, and with a cup and a friend work on
     pouring the K.A. all through your hair.
    -Once it is totally covered and saturated squeeze out the excess
     and blow dry.
    -Let it sit on your hair for a day.  (Beware:  it can be VERY
     messy, and during the day it is on your hair it might smear on
     your clothes....be careful!  Bleach seems to take the stain of
     off hands and counter tops.)

    -by Jodie Zwart

Method # 2
----------
1. Decide what color you want your hair to be.  Remember that the color of
      your hair will affect the way the color turns out.  If you have
      really light blonde hair, it will be about the same color as the
      drink, but the darker your hair is, the duller it will end up being.
      And if you're a redhead like me, greens and blues just don't work very
      well...they usually turn brown.  I've got reddish blond hair, and I
      used one package of Rock-O-Dile Red and one of Orange.  Now my hair
      looks kinda like it's on fire.
2. Get as many packages of unsweetened Kool-Aid as you feel necessary.
      My hair is pretty thick, and reaches most of the way to my waist, and
      I got pretty good results with only two packages.  And don't forget
      that you can mix different flavors to get new colors.  One package
      of Berry Blue and one of Lemon Lime turned my brothers light blond
      hair an amazing shade of turquoise.
3. Boil enough water to completely soak the part of your hair that you want
      to dye.  It has to be really hot, so don't plan on dyeing too close to
      your head.  This is another reason you might want to pick a color
      that will look OK with your natural color (or, in my case the color
      your hair happens to be at the moment).  Just make sure you're using
      less water than you would if you were making Kool-Aid to drink.  I
      used six cups of water for each package of Kool-Aid, instead of
      eight.  My brother only used four, but I don't think it made too much
      of a difference.
4. Dissolve the Kool-Aid in the water
5. Dunk your hair in the dye (careful...it's hot...don't get your face too
      close to the dye...or any part of yourself other than your hair for
      that matter).  Let your hair soak in the dye for at least five
      minutes, then you might want to dry off some of the dye with a towel.
6. Let your hair dry (it will drip dye all over the place...I usually go
      outside) but I don't reccommend using a hair dryer...it won't leave
      your hair very healthy-looking.
7. As soon as your hair is dry, you can wash it to rinse out some of the
      extra dye, so that it doesn't get all over your shirt.  But if you
      rinse the dye out before it dries, it might all wash off, leaving
      your hair the same color as when you started.  Now is also a good
      time to use a good conditioner, because the hot dye can dry out your
      hair pretty badly.

Unfortunately, so far I don't know how long the dye will last...at least a
week, fading just a little bit each day.  The color runs a little for the
first few days, and after that it's only noticeable when you wash your
hair. Rock-O-Dile Red mixed with Orange on dark reddish blond hair gives a
very bright red, which looks a little like fire if you only dye the ends
and a few streaks of your hair. Berry Blue mixed with Lemon-Lime on light
blond hair gives an intense blue-green.  Grape on black hair gives purple
highlights when the light hits it the right way.

Method # 3
----------

    -Take the packet of dry Kool-Aid and pour it into a paper cup.
    -Add a squirt of conditioner and about 3 drops of water.
    -Mix it so it is kind of thick.
    -Wet the part of your hair that you want to dye, put it on (cover
     your hands because it stains really badly) and wrap said hair in
     Saran Wrap.
    -Leave it in for 10 mins, and rinse lightly.
    -Blowdry and style as usual :)

    -by Mindy Sue

Method # 4
----------
Just a spoonful of vinegar added to the koolaid solution helps the color
stay in longer, and wrapping your head in plastic wrap  and then a towel or
something and sleeping overnight with the Koolaid in works well.  As a
brunette, I have trouble getting my hair to "take,"  but my best friend, a
light blonde since birth, used less koolaid than I, and only as "streaks"
which we painted onto her head with a basting brush for turkeys and stuff,
yet pink and blue strands were still found in her hair up to four or five
months later!  An asian friend of mine also dyed her hair with absolutely
no success.  Know your hair type.

As for the staining effects of the Koolaid, I highly recommend that you
designate a towel as your Kool-Aid towel, and keep the
rainbow-colored-thing around through all your trials of hair color, as a
sort of trophey of your accompleshments, and a colorful history of your
explorations.  Those blue scouring pads work to get the stains off skin
relatively quickly with only a little removal of skin (hey, it was either
that or a blue forehead!) But I have recently found that baking powder
(good ole Arm and Hammer) provides all the scouring power that you could
want without the pain.  In hardship, I used baking soda-toothpaste, which
worked so well and so quickly, that it made my head spin.  Vasaline, as
always, is a good idea to rub onto your forehead and ears, to keep those
runs from staining your skin.

WARNING:  the strong and pungent flavor of the koolaid you use will remain
as a scent in your hair for several days, and while pleasent, it might earn
you a nickname (i.e. Strawberry-Jill) from your dormmates for the rest of
the year.  :)

VII - Sugar and other Kool-Aid Sweeteners.
------------------------------------------

How much sugar is in Kool-Aid?     (Courtesy of the Street Cents Homepage)
------------------------------
   Pre-sweetened Kool-Aid contains 21 grams of sugar in a 250 millilitre
   serving. If it tastes too sweet for you, you can always add more
   water, or buy unsweetened Kool-Aid and just add less sugar than they
   suggest. Or there's Sugar Free Kool-Aid with Nutrasweet.

   You might not realize it but sugar is a major ingredient in lots of
   popular drinks:
     * Chocolate Milk has 23 grams of sugar.
     * Pops like 7-Up, Coke or Pepsi contain about 25 grams per 250
       millilitres.
     * Orange juice from frozen concentrate has 26 grams of sugar.
     * Iced tea mixes have about 26 grams of sugar.
     * Cranberry cocktail has 34 grams of sugar.

   Milk, on the other hand, has less sugar than Kool-Aid at about 11 or
   12 grams.
   There are also artificially sweetened diet drinks without sugar.

SUBSTITUTES FOR SUGAR

Vanilla Frosting      _tree_ (tree_bg@usa.pipeline.com)
-----------------
I once tried vanilla frosting and cherry koolaid, and that tasted pretty
good...

Brown Sugar, Honey   (Paul Schmidt)
------------------
The only things that I've tried other than white sugar are brown sugar and
honey.  The honey didn't work very well because it was hard to dissolve.
I suspect that if I'd heated up some water and then dissolved the honey in
there it would have worked ok, but that seems like too much effort, and
the honey has a really strong flavor anyways.  The brown sugar worked
just like regular white sugar and it tasted the same.  The only difference
was that the Kool-Aid was a bit browner.  It was rather unpleasant looking
for the Pina-Pineapple, but it might look good on some other flavors.

Cyclamates and presweetened Kool-Aid     Bruce Lee <brucel@microsoft.com>
------------------------------------
I remember finding an OLD pack of Kool-Aid in my parents cabinet (c.
1984) dating from the early 1970's (c. 1971).  It was labeled as
'pre-sweetened' Kool-Aid, was lemon-lime flavor, and had Warner
Brothers' "Bugs Bunny" character holding a pitcher of Kool-Aid on the
front package art.  The interesting thing was the size of the packet -
it was the SAME size as a packet of traditional unsweetened Kool-Aid!!

Yes, no triple-thick, double-sized packet... just one small slim
envelope containing lemon-lime elixir, and the sweetener of death.  The
Sweetener in Question was Cyclamate.

The contents tasted GREAT!!  Sweeter by far than the later pre-sweetened
Kool-Aid, and with no saccarin aftertaste. It made me yearn for the days
of Cyclamates, and their cancer causing side-effects.

It is unknown how long Kool-Aid was sold in the Cyclamate Pre-sweetened
form.  My brother thinks it was either a promotional trial (hence the
"Bugs Bunny" caricature on the packet), or was dicontinued once the bad
press on the carcinogenic effects of cyclamates reached a fever pitch
(about the time the Red M&M's were pulled because of fears of the Red Dye).

VIII.  What else can I do with Kool-Aid?
----------------------------------------
Kool Klothes Dye:            Jill Boughey (athene@uclink4.berkeley.edu)
-----------------
I tye-dyed a large sheet with several flavors of koolaid for a wonderful
pattern of colors which I proudly display on my wall.  Two years after
dying, the sheet still faintly smells of that wonderful koolaid-touch.

1) Sheets good for dyeing can be found cheaply at your local thrift stores,
they always have extra bed sheets for only a few bucks, and the lighter the
color the sheet, the more koolaid you will see.  I sugest an unpatterned,
white or light pastel sheet.

2) Especially if your sheet is white, it is recomended that you base-dye
the sheet with either yellow (my favorite) or a VERY DILUTED concentration
of another color dye.  Let the sheet saturate itself in the color, and then
squeez the extra water out.

3)  grasp a place on your sheet where you want to be the center of the dye.
 (You can have more than one center)  pull it into a type of rope, twisting
and knoting that section up until it has a lot of wrinkles.  Bind it
tightly into this shape with a rubber band.  Do the same to other areas,
until you have the sheet pretty darn twisted up.  Start with your lighter
colors of koolaid first, dippign more of your knot into the dye and letting
it sit long enough for the dye to move it's way into the fabric, but not to
completely saturate it. Squeeze the fabric to get rid of extra water, then
dip less of it into a darker color.  Repeate as desired all over the
diffrent knotted sections.

4)  Let the knots stay in for a few hours, maybe overnight, then unwrap the
still-wet sheet and lay it on the grass.  THE DYE WILL RUN until the sheet
dries, so no carpet or tables here!  I have  never washed my sheet, so I'm
not sure how permenant the dye is in water, but for a great-smelling,
beautiful wall covering, this is the way to go.

5) Two to Three packets of Koolaid recomended for each regular sized
bowlful of dye.

6)  Have fun!   (Use baking powder to remove any color from the hands.
Don't use tuperware bowls for the dye, they will absorb the color!)

Kool-Aid Play Dough:
--------------------
1 cup flour             1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 package unsweetened Kool-Aid      1/4 cup salt
2 tablespoons cream of tartar       1 cup water

Mix flour, salt, cream of tartara and Kool-Aid in a medium pot
Add water and oil.  Stir over medium heat 3 to 5 minutes.  When
mixture forms a ball in pot, remove.  Knead until smooth.  Put in
a plastic bag and refrigerate.

-from Ellen Davis' WWW page.

Kool Sugar Rush      Jill Boughey (athene@uclink4.berkeley.edu)
---------------
For that great-tasting sugar rush:  try a packet of koolaid and a cup or
more of sugar (depending on how much tartness you like) in a sealable
plastic baggie for a great sugar rush that turns your tongue red (or
purple, or blue) and gets you really hyped for a party.  Really popular
among high school and junior high kids!  Probably not mother-approved.

Dyeing Wool       (Robert Matthews)
----------
What I use KA for, like many of my fellow knitters, is dyeing wool. It
makes a really great dye, with bright colors that hang around, as long as
you don't leave them lying in the sun for a long time. Grape is the best;
it gives a brilliant, fresh-looking purple that ordinary chemical dyes
just can't seem to manage.

Sharon (huston@why.net) has also suggested that The Knitting Network's site
([http://www.fearless.net/knit/dyeing.html]
http://www.fearless.net/knit/dyeing.html) is a good place to get
information on dyeing all sorts of fibres with Kool-Aid.

Dyeing Fish             (Steve Schaefer  schaef@interpac.net)
----------
  Many years ago I fished commercially for salmon in Alaska. King Salmon
have two flesh colors , a deep orange and quite rarely white. The two
flesh colors tasted the same but we recieved only a fraction of the
price for the white fleshed variety so a friend found that he could dye
the incision on the belly of the white fleshed fish to a deep orange
color (with orange Kool-Aid of courrse) thereby increasing the value of
his catch.

Bubbling Kool-Aid      (The Merry Prankster)
-----------------
Here is something neat-o to try with Kool-Aid...
take any flavor  Kool-Aid and put it in a clear glass with some dry
ice...it look really swanky...it bubbles and make a little fog...so try
it...dry ice isn't too expensive...especially if you share it with a
bunch of people!!!!!!!

Hot Kool-Aid    (Keith - kgunders@isd.net)
------------
Have you ever tried HOT Kool-Aid? Try it before you dismiss it. It's better
than you might think. Just put a cup in the microwave for about 2 minutes
(depending on microwave). The reds seem to taste best hot, but others
aren't too bad either.

Kool-paint        (tba@vcn.bc.ca)
----------
Put a packet of Kool-Aid in a bowl and then put in just enough water to
disolve it and you can use it as a kool paint... i have some intresting
designs painted onn my walls.... now i can look at Kool-Aid anytime i
want! woo!

Industrial Uses of Kool-Aid        -Jim Dukat- ( jimduk@sierra.net )
---------------------------
I have another unusual use for Kool-Aid.  I work as an engineer on US flag
merchant ships. We use Kool-Aid mixed into the control water system of the
auto-shooting fuel purification centrifuges. It is a cheap - excellent -
mild acid and helps to keep scale from forming in the solenoid valves and
control orifices. The consensus is that Grape works best.

Along similar lines - I have also seen Kool-Aid used in ultraviolet
water purifiers aboard ships to keep scale off the internal quartz
tubes. It is usually charged into the offline standby unit.

Dishwasher Cleaner      - Bobby KY (bobbyky@aol.com)
------------------
I heard a few years ago from a gal who manages an apartment complex, that
they occassionally use orange Kool-Aid to clean the apartment dishwashers.
You know how hard water stains and soap gunk can accumulate in the
dishwasher? She suggested that a package or 2 run through the regular long
wash cycle will make the inside of the washer sparkling clean.  The
Citric Acid helps break down the stains.

Removing rust and chlorine      monkey1@kode.net
---------------------------
As far as uses for KA go, my family has used Lemon KA since I was a kid in the
shower.  It removes that funky green tint from chlorine in pools, and also will

get rid of rust discoloration if your well water is less than perfect.  You
only need a little bit of the KA, and mix it with some shampoo in your hand.
Shampoo it into your hair, then rinse.  I sometimes let it sit on my hair
before rinsing to give it time to work, and I also re-wash my hair with plain
shampoo to get everything out.  We keep a packet of Lemon KA in the shower if
we are swimming a lot.

Just one note though: it is the citric acid in the KA that makes it work, and
the same thing that can make your eyes & scalp sting.  Just try not to get too
much in your eyes, and it will go away as soon as you rinse.

Shower Head/Kool-Aid Prank  (courtesy D. Rogers' Homepage)
---------------------------
   This is a simple prank. All you have to do is mix up a batch of
   Kool-Aid, remove the shower head from your shower and poor in the
   Kool-Aid into the shower head. NOTE: Make sure you are not the next
   one to take a shower.

By pouring thin layers of KA into an ice cube tray and freezing after
each layer has been added, you can create striped Kool-Cubes!!
Reports of up to four distinct layers have been heard.

Popsicles         (found by Robert Buisson)
---------
1 pkg. Kool-Aid
1 pkg. jello
1/2 - 1 C sugar
2 C boiling water
2 C cold water

Mix and pour in molds and freeze.

Kool-Aid Cookies     (Thersa)
----------------
*1 cup sugar
*1 cup flour
*1 egg

Mix and bake and stuff. :)

Toasted Kool-Aid:     (Joe Kool - jamoross@twics.com)
-----------------
1 Packet     Kool-Aid Unsweetened Drink Mix Powder
1 Cup        Sugar
2 Quarts     Water
1 Tablespoon Margarine or Butter (softened)
2 Slices     Bread

1.  Place margarine and two teaspoons sugar in a very small mixing
    bowl or custard dish and set aside.
2.  Place remaining sugar and Kool-Aid powder in a large plastic or
    glass pitcher and blend thoroughly (keep dry!).
3.  Add one teaspoon of Kool-Aid+sugar mixture from pitcher to small
    bowl from step 1 and blend until smooth. (This is easiest if the
    margarine is very soft.)  It'll be grainy, that's OK.
4.  Spread onto bread and bake in pre-heated oven at 450F (230C) for
    about 5 minutes.  Or, broil in toaster-oven on high for about 1
    and a half to 2 minutes until very bubbly on top.
5.  While the feature item is baking (or broiling), add water to the
    pitcher and stir to dissolve.  Place in fridge for later :-)
6.  Remove Toasted Kool-Aid from oven and kool briefly before serving.
    Makes two slices.

Sour BANG! Kids                     (MJcandies@pmg.stu.rpi.edu)
---------------
     * First get all the supplies. Here's what ya need...
          + A microwave.
          + Some sour-patch kids!
          + Some Kool-Aid mix, we used grape.
          + A plate, we recommend ceramic and not paper!
     * Next step: preperation.
          + Spread a layer of Kool-Aid mix on the plate. Make sure you
            put enough on or else you'll have to scrape your kids off
            your plate.
          + Place some sour-patch kids on top of the Kool-Aid mix.
          + Sprinkle plenty of Kool-Aid mix on top of the sour-patch
            kids.
     * Alright, now your ready to nuke your kids!
          + Place the plate in the microwave.
          + Microwave on high for about 45 secs. to about 1:30 depending
            on how many kids you have.
          + We recommend that you watch the microwave process, and
            shutting off the microwave when you see the Kool-Aid melt into
            your kids.
          + Note if you over cook your kids they become hard and crispy,
            they are still edible, though. Don't throw your crunchy kids
            in the toilet!
          + The more you nuke your kids the bigger the bang of sourness,
            try to find a good balance of crunchiness and bang.
     * Eat!
          + Place in mouth and chew. Oh yeah, you should probably cool
            your kids first.
          + At first you will taste the Kool-Aid mix, but don't swallow
            yet, it's not over!
          + Pretty soon the Kool-Aid wears off and then BANG! your kids
            turn sour!

Kool-Aid Rice Krispies Squares   (Robert Stave <stave@why.net>)
------------------------------    XAMER (xamer@aol.com)
Here is a colorful dessert to make for Christmas.

Make rice krispie treats according to the instruciotns on the rice-krispie box,
except multiply the recipe by 1.5 on all ingrediants.  Mix in your favorite KA
into the marshmellow creme.

If you don't increase the recipe by 1.5, it will be sour.
I was looking in my Sunday paper and noticed an ad for Rice Krispies.
They Suggest that you add a pack of Kool-Aid to your batch of Rice Krispy
treats for fruity flavor and wacky color.

Kool-Aid Sandwiches   (Fransciso Toro)
-------------------
I told my girlfriend about all ye friendly folks on a.d.ka and she
chuckled and told me that when she was a little kid in Elementary
School (2nd Grade about) she used to come home from school every day
while her mom was still at work and make herself Kool-Aid Sandwiches.
This is not a joke!  She used to dump the sweetened powder between
two slices of Wonder Bread and munch away.  It was years before her
mom figured out that's where all the Kool-Aid she'd buy was going!
In honor of this reminiscence we went and made a Kool-Aid Sandwich.
It's, ah, interesting.  Makes sort of a novel dessert.

Kool-Whip:      (John Nielson)
----------
I found that it mixes very nicely with Cool Whip.  You may have to
add a bit of sugar (sweeten to taste.)  Part of the exploratory
process is to discover for yourself the ratio of Cool Whip to sugar
to KA.  It should reflect your personal preferences.  Color is not
important, but do not substitute any actual dairy whipped cream,
as this treat must have a certain amount of unnaturalness about it.
It's great for dipping twinkies into.

Homemade Frozen Pops   (From the Berkeley Recipe Archive)
--------------------
Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v7.07
      1    Kool-Aid, unsweetened, pack.
      1    Jelly Powder, package
    3/4 c  Granulated Sugar
      2 c  Boiling Water
      2 c  Cold Water

  Servings: 18

  In a 2-quart glass measure, combine the Kool-Aid, jelly powder and sugar.
  Add hot water and stir until sugar is dissolved. Stir in cold water. Pour
  into pop molds and freeze. Makes about 18.

Kool Snow Slushy:    (Rock-a-dial Rachel)
-----------------
When I was a kid, My sisters and I would get a bowl of snow, then sprinkle
pre-sweetened Kool-Aid on it then eat it with a spoon.  You may think
this sounds gross, but damn, was it good.  Kinda like a snow cone.  Try
it this winter.  (If you have snow where you live).

Kool Ice Cream    (Russell Hansen - rhansen@powerup.com.au)
--------------
Mix Ice Cream powder (this was done in Australia, I am unsure of the
availability of such powder elsewhere), with 600 milliliters of whipped
cream, and add one packet of your favourite flavor.  A few hours later,
you will have Kool-Aid Flavor Ice Cream (It works very well with
incrediberry, so says Russell).

Kool Ice Cream - Part II - (Michael S. Cooper - mscooper@airmail.net)
------------------------
Ingredients:

1	8 oz. tub of Cool Whip (or some other whipped topping)
1	4 oz. box of Junket Ice Cream Mix (Vanilla)
1	packet of unsweetened Kool-Aid (your choice)

Cool Whip - $1.25 US
Ice Cream Mix $1.00 US
Kool-Aid $.25 US
Total: $2.50 US

Directions:

Since Cool Whip is usually partially frozen at the store, you need to
thaw it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before using.  Empty
the Cool Whip into a two-quart plastic bowl that you have a lid for.
Pour about a fourth of the ice cream mix into the Cool Whip and stir
briskly.  I use a wire whip because it helps fold the ingredients
better.  Continue adding the ice cream mix a fourth at a time until it
is all mixed in.  Then start adding the Kool-Aid the same way.  If you
dump it all in at once, it will be a lot harder to mix and maintain
the color throughout the ice cream.  After you finish mixing all the
ingredients, you can either eat it as is, or return it to the freezer
(with the lid on) for a couple of hours so it will stiffen up.

Note:  This stuff does not get to the consistency of ice cream, but
you may be able to scoop it with a wet scoop if you wish.

Those of you who do not have access to Junket may contact me at
mscooper@airmail.net.  I have a source for it.

--------------------------
1 Cup Confectioners Sugar.
1 teaspoon Water.

Mix and add water until you have a good
thick paste.

Add a pinch of your favorite Kool-Aid to
color your icing. For red, I used fruit punch

more appropriate (the fruitiness was a bit
overwhelming).

Half a glass of Coke

Mix.

+ Kool-Aid Slushies (Steve Woolley)
+ -----------------
+ I missed the original message, but the subject provoked me to inform
+ you fellow kool-aiders about my secret slush recipe.  It is the only
+ way to drink kool-aid (in my view).  So, here it is.  First of all
+ you'll need a blender.  (mine holds about 7 cups I think)  Put in two
+ cups of cold water, one cup of sugar (of course, you can't measure it
+ exactly or it would be ruined)  add whatever flavor or mixture of
+ flavors of kool-aid to it and mix it.  Then, fill it the rest of the
+ way (or at least most of the way to the top) with ice.  Finally, blend
+ that puppy!  (hopefully you have a powerful blender)  Then once it is
+ done chopping the ice, pour it into your pitcher and drink it all.  If
+ you do it as often as myself, soon you'll be immune to the headache
+ that it gives you.  Also, it can be done in a matter of minutes rather
+ than hours.

X. What can you tell me about the Atari Kool-Aid video game?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a description and detailed instruction of the Kool-Aid video
game.  the info comes from a web page at the following URL:
[http://www.sponsor.net/~gchancel/2600Stuff/2600Docs/Kool-Aid_Man]
http://www.sponsor.net/~gchancel/2600Stuff/2600Docs/Kool-Aid_Man

        KOOL-AID MAN  (M-Network)

        Instructions
        (1 Player vs. Computer)
Help Kool-Aid Man in a battle with the Thirsties!  Those insatiable
Thirsties are stealing the water out of your swimming pool.  You want to
catch tem when they stop to dip their straws in the pool.  Also, help Kool-
Aid Man gobble up Kool-Aid ingredients in order to keep the Thirsties from
bouncing Kool-Aid Man around the backyard.

        For your Atari 2600 Game System.

Kool-Aid and Kool-Aid Man are trademarks of General Foods Corporation.
Copyright 1983 General Foods Corporation.  All Rights Reserved.  Atari is a
trademark of Atari Inc.

        THE GAME
[Screen Shot: Score (black number top center of screen), Time (red number
below score), Kool-Aid Man (a pitcher), Backyard Walls (vertical
multi-colored barriers on left and right sides of screen), Pool (blue area
at bottom of screen), Thirsties With Straws (bomb/apple shaped with eyes
looking left and right), Thirsties Without Straws (bomb/apple shaped with
eyes facing forward and sucking water out of the pool) and Water Ingredient
(large floating "W").]

You can move Kool-Aid Man anywhere in your backyard.  Make him catch the
Thirsties by colliding with them when they stop to drink the water out of
your swimming pool.  For every Thirstie he catches, you add a hundred points
to your score.  However, the Thirsties are pretty tough customers!  When
they're not standing still, drinking the water out of your swimming pool,
they're moving across the screen, trying to bounce Kool-Aid Man around the
yard.  So you best dodge them as they come after you.  If a Thirstie hits
Kool-Aid Man, you'll lose control of him temporarily.

You can aid Kool-Aid Man by making him gobble up the Water (W's), Sugar
(S's) and Kool-Aid (K's) which occasionally pass through the yard.  He
gobbles them up by catching them on the run.  These ingredients make
Kool-Aid Man temporarily unaffected by the moving Thirsties.  This means he
can move about without being knocked around by them.  That's when you can
really catch the other Thirsties who have stopped to steal your water.

If the Thirsties steal all the water from your pool before you catch every
one of them, the game is over.  If you catch them all before that happens,
you WIN and automatically move on to the next level of difficulty.

        CONTROLLERS
Use your Left Joystick Controller to move Kool-Aid Man.  (The Right Joystick
is not used in this game.)  Be sure your controller cable is securely
plugged into the back of the game console.  Hold the controller with the
word "top" facing the top of the T.V. screen.

- Push joystick LEFT to move Kool-Aid Man LEFT.
- Push joystick RIGHT to move Kool-Aid Man RIGHT.
- Push joystick FORWARD to move Kool-Aid Man UP.
- Push joystick BACK to move Kool-Aid Man DOWN.

Note: The red button is not used in this game!

        DIFFICULTY SWITCHES
The switch on the RIGHT sets the level of difficulty.  In the A position,
the Thirsties move at a faster speed.  In the B position, the Thirsties move
at a normal speed.

The switch on the LEFT is used to freeze the action of the game by sliding
it to the A position.  Position B is used to return the game to action from
the point at which it was stopped.  (Always begin with the switch in
position B.)

        ACTION!
Get ready to join Kool-Aid Man in battling the Thirsties!

To start the game, press the Reset Switch on the console.  Be ready!!!...The
game starts right after Kool-Aid Man breaks through the wall of the yard.

When Kool-Aid Man appears on the screen with the Thirsties, push the Left
Joystick in any of the four directions available.

Controlling Kool-Aid Man: Push your Joystick Controller in the direction you
want Kool-Aid Man to go.  Don't let Kool-Aid Man bump into the walls or the
water in the pool.  If you do, you'll lose control of him temporarily.

Dodge the Thirsties as they pass horizontally across the screen.  If you
don't, you will bounce Kool-Aid Man around the yard, and you will
temporarily lose control of him.

When a Thirstie stops and dunks its straw in the pool, make Kool-Aid Man
bump into it.  The Thirstie will disappear from the yard, and you'll add a
hundred points to your score on the screen.

The Kool-Aid Ingredients: You will notice W's, S'S and K's passing
horizontally across the screen.  They stand for Water, Sugar and Kool-Aid.
Try to make Kool-Aid Man catch them if you can.  He will gobble them up and
music will play.  This will keep Kool-Aid Man temporarily unaffected by the
Thirsties.  That means he gets bigger, and the moving Thirsties can't bounce
him around.  It's the best time to catch as many stationary Thirsties as you
can.  But when the music stops, Kool-Aid Man will shrink back to his normal
size and can be knocked around by the Thirsties once again.

Every time Kool-Aid Man gobbles up an ingredient, a little water is added
back to the swimming pool.  This amounts to slowing down the clock, so you
have more time to catch the Thirsties.

        SCORING
Your score at the top-center of the screen will increase by 100 points for
every Thirstie you catch.

Timing: There are 30 Thirsties trying to drink the water out of your pool.
If you catch every one of them before they drink all the water, you WIN and
automatically move on to the next level of difficulty.

If the Thirsties drink all the water out of your swimming pool before you
catch every one of them, the game is over.

Bonus Points: Bonus points are awarded for the time left on the clock at the
end of each round.  So, catch all the Thirsties as fast as you can for the
best score possible!

        WINNING TIPS
When Kool-Aid Man gets bounced around by the Thirsties, relax!  It will only
last a few seconds.  Just be ready to take over when he settles down.

Go after every Ingredient you can.  While you're unaffected by the moving
Thirsties, you can catch a lot of other Thirsties who are stealing the water
out of your pool.

XI. What can you tell me about Marvel Kool-Aid Man Comics?
----------------------------------------------------------
From: Terry Wiegard <wiegard@idirect.com>
Marvel published about a half a dozen Kool-Aid Comics in the 80's.
They're basically just big Kool-Aid ads, but are mildly amusing to
browse through.  Around six different comics were made in the series.
For more information about the rarity of the comic series and the cost of
obtaining a set, see your nearest Comic Book retailer.

XII.  What is the Kool-Aid Fan-Fic?
-----------------------------------
Kool-Aid Fan-Fic is a fictional(?) story of the adventures of Kool-
Aid Man and his struggle against the evils of Flavor-Aid Fella.  It
was/is(?) written by Chris M. Ackney, aka GREEN GUY.

Chapter 1.  It All Began on a Nice Quiet Day...
Chapter 2.  Flavor-Aid Fella on a Rampage!
Chapter 3.  Kool-Aid Man, Timmy, and the Flavor-Aid Death Machine.
Chapter 4.  Kool-Aid goes Film Noire.
Chapter 5.  Gumshoe Kool-Aid

These are now available on the web at the Kool-Aid Archive:

XIII.  Does anyone else mix Kool-Aid flavors?
----------------------------------------------
Many KA drinkers enjoy creating their own special blends of Kool-Aid.

RIVER WATER     Dave Freidkin <freidkin@doitnow.com>
My wife Sunny came up with a great combination called RIVER WATER.  You
make it with one packet of Lemon-Lime and one packet of Watermelon-Cherry,
and of course, 2 cups of sugar. Makes a gallon of funky brown water, like
the result of a vacation in Mexico, but it tastes great!

XIV. Recapturing Lost Flavors through Kool-Aid Mixing
-------------------------------------------------------
In my many experiences with K-A, I have found mixes that taste like
some of the discontinued flavors.

Purplesaurus Rex
1.5 scoops Grape
2.5 scoops Lemonaid

Sunshine Punch
2 Scoops Orange
2 Scoops Lemonaid

Hope this helps those who miss these flavors as much as I do.
-Olanin (fskml@aurora.alaska.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Sharkleberry Finn:  (Donovan <bakd@gwtc.net>)
-----------------
1/2 tsp of Lemonade(unsweetened)
1/2 tsp of Orange(unsweetened)
1/2 tsp of Strawberry(unsweetened)
1 Cup of sugar(use the full cup of sugar on this, or it will be tart)
1/2 gallon of water as usual

Scarry Blackberry(?)   (Michael S. Cooper <mscooper@flash.net>)
--------------------
Just a note to let you all know I mixed up my own Scary Blackberry tonight,
just a little different than the recipe given by Kraft.

I actually mixed grape, cherry, and tropical punch and three (3!) cups of
sugar together in a three quart pitcher (That's double-strength, guys!) and
then diluted it accordingly into my storage pitchers.

For the record, I can't say it tastes exactly like Scary Blackberry,
because I've never had any.  We don't seem to get it down here in Dallas,
or Texas for that matter.  I will say that it tastes *exactly* like a mix
of those three flavors, with the tropical punch flavor being most dominant.
 The color, however, is a great Halloween blood reddish-purple.
------------
Cheap Immitations of lost flavors
----------------------------------

There are also cheap immitations of lost Kool-Aid Flavors still
available on the market...
From:  Susan Hoover <71061.2052@CompuServe.COM>

Drink Aid (an American immitation of Kool-Aid) has the following flavors
which approximate discontinued flavors:

  Kangablue Brew - this is Great Bluedini in disguise; it even
      starts out green and changes to blue
  Purple Mania - this is a grape / lemonade mix; Its their version of
      Purplesaurus Rex?
  Boppin' Redbird - god knows; this is a red drink that tastes
      kind of like raspberry-cherry-fruit punch (Rock-a-dile Red)

XV. Non Alcoholic Kool-Aid Mixes
----------------------------------

Blood Kool-Aid    Amy Mundhenk (amundhen@Phoenix.kent.edu)
---------------
1 Package Cherry Sugar-Free
1 Package regular grape
1 cup sugar
1 Dr. Pepper
Water to make 1 Gallon

Mix the Kool-Aid and sugar with the Dr.Pepper. Add water. The results look
remarkably like blood and taste like killer pixy sticks. This recipie was
invented by my friend D.M. who is one of those "more vampyric than thou"
types.

Kool Milk Shakes    (Russell Hansen - rhansen@powerup.com.au)
----------------
First select your favourite Kool-Aid flavor.  Take 1/4 tsp of Kool-Aid
powder, 300mls of milk, and 4-5 scoops of ice-cream.  It makes a
wonderful treat...

Kool Koffee    (Mats Fjellner - d94-mfj@nada.kth.se)
-----------
* 1 red Philips Cafe DUO coffee machine with built-in re-usable filter.
* 1 packet of Oh-Yeah Orange Pineapple.
* Lofbergs Lila (swedish brand) coffee

Step 1:
 Pour a small amount of coffee into the filter, and pour a very
 thin layer of Kool-Aid on the coffee.
Step 2:
 Repeat step 1, until you've used the whole packet of Kool-Aid.
Step 3:
 Turn on the coffee machine.
Step 4:
 Wait anxiously.

well.. what can i say about the taste.. i can imagine this is what the
coffee they serve in hell must taste like. I guess this is the reason you
never hear about people mixing Kool-Aid with coffee; if anyone's done it
before me, they probably freaked out & got locked up in a cuckoo's nest
somewhere. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, KIDS ! Unless you're an experienced
Kool-Aid user & you know what you're doing.

Lemonade with an Orange   (Mark Atkins)
-----------------------
Use one orange for each packet of lemonade KA.  Make KA as usual.  Fill
container about halfway.  Slice orange, and place slices in KA.  Since
the ends of the orange will be mostly peel, I squeeze that to get the
juice into the KA, then toss the peel.  Fill container to top, then place
in the cooler.  It needs to sit awhile to let everything mix.  I let it
set overnight.  After you drink your KA, you have tasty oranges to eat.

KOOL-AID FRUIT PUNCH        (Paul Lindberg)
--------------------
Ingredients:
      2 packets UNsweetened red Koolaid mix
              2 2-liter bottles soda
          1 can frozen lemonade concentrate
          1 can frozen pineapple juice concentrate
                sugar, as needed

Mixing instructions:
   Make up the koolaid ahead of time, by dissolving in a small amount on
   water (as little as possible). Don't add sugar! Cool this mixture.
   With everything cold, mix it all together, just before the party. You
   can add sherbert to keep it cold, or make ice cubes, or an ice cube
   ring, using the koolaid mixture. You probably won't need to add any
   sugar to this, as the soda, lemondade, and pineapple juice should
   contain plenty.

Super Kool-Aid     (Brian O'Shea bwoshea@uiuc.edu)
--------------
Here's the Recipe for Brian O'Shea's Super Kool-Aid
"So good it crunches!"
Still legal in 13 states - and Puerto Rico!  (Approval pending in
Canada)

Ingredients:
12 ozs pre-mixed Fruit Punch Kool-Aid (the stuff with the sugar already
in it)
2 packages unsweetened Kool-Aid ( I recommend Pink Lemonade and Cherry
flavor)
2 1/2 pounds sugar (approx. 1 kilogram) Note:  Better more than less!
Water

Put the sugar, sweetened, and unsweetened Kool-Aid packages into a
two-quart container.  Add lots of ice, add water to two-quart line, and
shake.  Serve!  For more entertaining results, add one dose of a
commercial caffeine supplement such as Vivarin per 8-oz serving and
shake until fully dissolved.

Notes:  This is best taken when you don't have to get up early -
hyperactivity is a common side-effect.

-PS Rex-Rum                                 (Jennifer, Ruler of Rex)
 My personal fave mix is a little PS Rex and about two oz. Spiced Rum.
 Makes a fascinating treat. If you make a whole batch you can put it in
 the freezer and make slushies. It's great for those parties where you
 wanna try a little something different.

-Velvet Crush 		                        (Travis W Fisher)
 If you have ever heard of the band Soul Coughing, they mention an
 alcoholic drink called a Velvet Crush.  It is described simply as "Kool
 Aid and Gin"

-Kool-Aid Dacquiri        (KellyAnn - 71534.1735@CompuServe.COM)
 -Dissolve 1 cup sugar in 1 pint hot water
 -Add Kool-Aid powder (Black Cherry is recommended) blend well and cool.
 -Add a few ounces of this concentrate to a blenderful of ice and rum,
  blend and voila!

 I added vodka to kiwi-lime Kool-Aid once, and it turned clear green (as

-GLOWING BLUEDINI-EVERCLEAR        (Tirza)
 Adding everclear to great bluedini and then putting it into one of those
 frosted glass Flintstones cups that McDonald's used to sell creates one of
 most aesthetically pleasing beverages that anyone could ever want.  It glows
 kind of like the core of a nuclear reactor.

Blue Slushy        Larry Pasakarnis <RoloVincent@compuserve.com>
-----------
I did this for the following drink....take a large rectangular tupperware
container and mix up your Kool-Aid in it.  Add Everclear to this mixture
and add more flavor and sugar  to taste.  Once completed place the
container in the freezer.  Let sit until frozen....mine usually does not
freeze solid do to the amount of everclear I add this makes it easy to
break the block up with a knife into a slushy mixture......after this place
the block of BLUE into a cooler and add more Kool-Aid and everclear.
Quantities are dependent on containers and your alcoholic ability.......

XVII.  How can I get Kool-Aid flavors that aren't sold in my area?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Alt.drinks.kool-aid is an excellent aid in acquiring those rare
flavors and old packets of Kool-Aid.  Just post a message with what
you are looking for.  You may have to be persistent, but the payoff
can be quite good.  Many have acquired several extinct flavors in this
way.

Secondly, consult the kool-traders list.  It contains a list of people who
want to trade Kool-Aid.  For more info, check the kool-traders list, or
e-mail Walter Klimczak (klimczak@mindspring.com).

XIX.  Where else do they sell Kool-Aid?
-----------------------------------------
-This is a hard question to answer.  Research in this area is
 ongoing. Naturally, it is available in the US and Canada.  Ron
 Gregory has acquired a single serving packet from somewhere in the
 Middle East.  It has arabic writing (maybe) on it, but the origin is
 unknown.  It is also available in Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, The
 Phillipines, Russia, and Japan, where packets are naturally printed in
 different languages, and in some cases, have different flavors then
 are available in North America.

The following is an excerpt from a brochure Ron Gregory received from Kraft:
****************************************************************************
The Kraft General Foods Inc. (KGFI) international markets are

Middle East and Africa:
~~~
Best selling products across the area include Tang powdered beverage,
Kraft cheddar cheese in the famous "blue can," cream cheese spread,
mayonnaise, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O desserts and Vitalite
margarine.

Our largest area markets are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, with agressive developemnt
plans to expand sales in Egypt, Algeria and Moroco.

Asia/Pacific
~~~
KGFI's Asia/Pacific region, headquatered in Hong Kong, includes
countries in varying stages of development: from westernized
Australia and New Zealand, and highly industrialized Japan and South
Korea, to such emerging economies as those of India, Thailand,
Indonesia and the People's Republic of China....

Our present operations are most extensive in Australia, Japan, South
Korea and the Philippines.  Although coffee and cheese are our key
categories in the region, the product portfolio varies markedly from
country to country.

... In the Philippines, we have a commanding position in the cheese
market and are strongly represented in the powdered beverage
catagory, with our Tang and Kool-Aid brands.

RUSSIA    Gary Boltralik  (BOLTRALG@aepco.com)
------
Kraft made six flavors that were printed in dual language, English-Russian
packs.  They come only sugar sweetened, are about 13cm X 13cm and make 1
liter(not the usual 2L or 2 Quarts).  I got a English-Russian dictionary
and tried my hand at a translation of the Cyrillic language.  There really
isn't a one to one match of characters since the Russian language has 33
characters.  The best you can do is to give somewhat of an English
phonetic interpretation of what the Russian characters sound like.  I
compared my translation to one Matt Coon did and they are similar enough
that I feel the translation is close.  Of course an exact translation from
a native Russian speaker would be best, however, since I don't have that,
here are the Russian flavors with translation.

     Strawberry / Klubinka
     Orange / Apelsin
     Raspberry / Malina
     Cherry / Vishnya
     Tropical Punch / Tropicheskiye Fruktui
     Lemonade / Limon   (actually lemonade translates just a little
                        different as Limon means Lemon not Lemonade)
     Note: The i in the above words is pronounced like ee in see.

Venezuela  (Lynn Weigard)
---------
Cereza (Cherry)
Fresa (Strawberry)
Kolita (Kola Champagne)
Tropical (Tropical Punch)
Uva (Grape)

"Kolita" is a kid's flavor--like a cola, but brilliant red.

Brazil     (Gary Boltralik)
------
I now have a set of five Brazilian Kool-Aids.  I don't know if there are
more than five flavors, but the person shopping for me bought everyone
sold.  The packets are all sugar sweetened, make 1 liter and are in
Portuguese.  Gee, another language I don't know.  After quite a bit of
browsing all the Portuguese dictionaries I could find both on the Internet
and local library, I am ready to take a stab at translation.  The flavors
are as follows:

     Laranja  -  Orange
     Morango  -  Strawberry
     Uva      -  Grape
     Guarana  -  OK, this isn't a fruit flavor.  I finally found out that
                this is a Brazilian plant.  A Spanish dictionary listed it
                as a "refreshing drink" made from the seeds of the plant.
                I guess it would be like a Mexican Cola or a rootbeer in
                that its a "plant" flavor rather than fruit.
     Frutas Vermelhas  -  The Tropical Punch equivalent.  Frutas means
                Fruit(duh).  Now Vermelhas, well, it is an adjective that
                describes something as red.  It doesn't necessarily mean
                something is the color red.  Kind of like China having a
                Red Army.  The Army itself is not the color red but it is
                called red.  That's how Vermelhas describes Frutas,
                literally as Red Fruit.  So it could be viewed as Punch,
                anybody's guess really.

     The packs have Ki-Suco Wacky as there title instead of Kool-Aid.  The
     Suco part translates to "juice".  The Ki part, who the hell knows.  So
     Brazilians are drinking something akin to wacky juice.  Yum.

   The Phillipines (From the Kool-Aid Koolectors Home Page
-------------------
   Flavors:  Cherry, Grape, Great Bluedini, Lemonade Sparkle;,
   Orange, Orange Enerjooz;, Pineapple, Pink Swimmingo;,
   Strawberry, Tropical Punch, perhaps others.

   Notes:  Pouches are constructed of something similar to MylarTM and
   bear surprising resemblance to soggy North American coffee packages.
   No full-package mix instructions are listed, but the bag claims to
   make approximately 11 200ml (6.4 fl. oz) servings on an as-needed
   basis.  Filipino Kool-Aid&reg; contains real juice...news that will
   perhaps come as a mild disappointment to the true Kool-Aid
   aficionado.  Equally disheartening, Filipino Kool-Aid contains a
   stunning array of 17 "essential vitamins and minerals"...especially,
   my bags seem to note, beta carotene.  The Orange tastes a bit too
   suspiciously like Tang&reg;, a drink that does serious business in the
   Phillipines.

    Pouch backs feature puzzles or games.  Shown, right, the complex maze
   on the back of a pouchful of Great Bluedini&reg; Kool-Aid
   Juicer&reg;.  The following inspiring text appears to the top right
   of the maze:  "This is Kool!  Hey!  Meet the new Kool-Aid Magic.  Yo
   check this out.  Color changes quick.  New Kool-Aid...Great Bluedini,
   Super fruity Blue, Yummy-yummy Kool!  Kool-Aid Great Bluedini.  Yo
   It's Kool."  Sigh, maybe I really am too old for this stuff.

   There are two known sweetened pouch designs:
     * Early:  Packets feature roughly rendered designs that are at times
       equivalent to the US Super-Fruity (SF) and Pre-Super-Fruity (PSF)
       design series.  Filipino pouches features some new designs and/or
       color schemes.
     * Late (Current):  Photographic-styled pouches show Kool-Aid&reg;
       bountifully pouring forth from fresh fruit into a small fountain
       glass.

   Columbian Packet Profile  (From the Kool-Aid Koolectors Page)
---------------------------
   (Known) Flavors:  Strawberry(Fresa), Orange (Naranja).
   Notes:  A small number of packets that somehow made it to the store
   shelves of Michigan are all that there is to show here for Columbian
   Kool-Aid;.  The bilingual Spanish and English packets are composed
   of stiff, glossy, unfoiled paper and were produced in Columbia by
   Columbina General Foods S.A.  Because of the older-style GF logo on
   the packets, we suspect they date back to 1983.

Kool-Aid in Great Britain
-------------------------
Thanks to Keri, who supplied us with the location of England's
underground supply of "black market" Kool-Aid...

I am American, but I'm studying in Manchester, England this year.  No one
here knows what Kool-Aid even is, let alone where I could buy some, so my
mom has been mailing some to me every week. However, when browsing through
Affleck's Palace (a big building with stalls where they sell stuff, like a
market sort of thing), I found a guy who was selling individual packets
for 50p, which is about 75 american cents!  It is robbery, but the guy has
to have friends in the US mail him the Kool-Aid every month, so the costs
are bound to be high.

-Keri Rains

Sweden   (Mats Fjellner d94-mfj@nada.kth.se)
------
Kool-Aid is not sold in Stores in Sweden, but a dealer from the United
States sends "all the Kool-Aid that they need".  Mats Fjelner and his
friends celebrate Kool-Aid periodically (about once a month) by holding a
festival, known as the "Lappis Kool-Aid Festial".  They have been holding
this festival since 1995.  The Festival is named after the area of Sweden
where it is held

Norway       Cato Hognestad Jensen <catjense@sn.no>
------
I know that you can get Kool-Aid from the NATO store here in
Stavanger... but they aren't allowed to give any or sell any... I they
do, they can get deported from Norway... a kid last year got a fin on
120 US Dollars for doing it, and his dad a NATO person got put on
probation for 1 year, if anything like that happens again they will get
deported...

Japan       (Lynn Wiegard - prex@golden.net)
-----
Kool-Aid has started a Trial run in Japan.  If you have anymore info
on the Japanese sale of Kool-Aid, please inform Paul Dawson-Schmidt,
or post to alt.drinks.kool-aid.

-If you have friends in other countries, ask them if they sell Kool-
 Aid where they live.

XX. "What kind of Kool-Aid did the people of Jonestown drink?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It is a popular misconception that 900 followers of cult leader Jim Jones
committed suicide by drinking Grape Kool-Aid laced with cyanide at their
commune in Jonestown Guyana in the late 1970's.  This is not true.  The
followers of Jones actually drank cyanide laced flavor-aid, a cheap
imitation of Kool-Aid. The flavor-aid flavor they consumed was grape.
Therefore, Kool-Aid played no part in this tragedy.

XXI.  What is the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test?
----------------------------------------------
Thanks to David Jones <djones@eng.mc.xerox.com>
          Mats Fjellner <d94-mfj@nada.kth.se>

"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" is a book about author Ken Kesey ("One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" etc.), the Merry Pranksters, and assorted
other "60s types" going around in a refurbished school bus and giving
people Kool-Aid spiked with LSD to see how they react. This was in the
real early days of the hippie culture, (1965-66) before LSD was
criminalized (in late 1966).

I daresay the publicity people at Kool-Aid were not very happy about
having their product associated with such things. You won't find it in
official company histories.

"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" was written by Tom Wolfe ("The Right
Stuff") and published in 1968 or 69, depending on which catalog entry
you believe. Apparently Kesey et al. weren't too fond of Wolfe or the
book.  He seems to have hung around for a few days and then headed back
for the big city, where they know how to look after guys in white suits.

XXII.  The Wacky Warehouse
-------------------------
A thank you to Paul Schmidt for the updated Wacky Warehouse Info.

The Wacky Warehouse is a trading post of sorts that rewards loyal
Kool-Aid drinkers to mail in their Kool-Aid points for prizes.  In the
past, Kool-Aid watches, walkmans, t-shirts and smiling pitchers have been
available.  In 1995, the wearhouse changed the way it operates, and now
only offers prizes on a periodic basis.

A new Wacky Warehouse catalog was released sometime in March-April 1997,
and should be available in stores that sell Kool-Aid.  If you want to find
out what specifically is available you can call the Kool-Aid number and
select the Wacky Warehouse part.  The number is 1-800-367-9225 (in the
US) or 1-800-268-7808 (in Canada).

You can also write the Wacky Warehouse in the US:
WACKY WAREHOUSE
P.O. Box 3328
Maple Plain, MN  55593-3328

Or in Canada:

XXIII. Is there a differnce between regular and super-fruity Kool-Aid?

Well, there is substantial debate about this.  On December 27, 1994, in my
kitchen in Winnipeg Manitoba, I conducted a taste test between Regualar
Orange and Super Fruity Orange.  The next day I performed a similar test
between regular and super-fruity Cherry.  My conclusion was, that in both
cases, there was no difference at all.  However, others refuse to believe
those results, and adamantly deny my claims.

For those who don't remember, old Kool-Aid (Pre-1995) was not "super
fruity".  Late in 1994, Super Fruity Kool-Aid made its appearance on
store shelves.

XXIV. When has Kool-Aid been featured in the Media?
---------------------------------------------------
Recently, Kool-Aid has recieved much attention from the media, mainly due
to the hair dying craze.  Here is a brief list of appearances the
Kool-Aid has made in the media (this list is surely incomplete).

January, 1996: Article entitled "Never too old to be a Kool-Aid kid"
appears in a 'Zine called "Avalanche".  (The article is available online
at The Kool-Aid Web Archive).

April 17, 1996: A Canada Newswire article appears about a charitable
project called "Kool-Aid for Kids" (available on-line via the Kool-Aid web
archive)

July, 1996: Article entitled "Kool-Aid Goes to Kids heads" appears in the
Wall Street Journal.  It also appears in the Halifax Chronical-Herald on
July 24.  It is written by Yumiko Ono, and is available on line at the
Kool-Aid Web Archive.

July-August 1996: Not to be outdone, CBS News and the Fort Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinal both interview Matt Mankins, (Creator of the Hey Kool-Aid
Page) for stories about Kool-Aid hair dying.  Data about when these
stories appeared is incomplete.

September 16, 1996: A mini-article entitled "Dye-namite fun" appears in
Maclean's Magazine, on page 15. (The article is about kool hair-dye).

October 1, 1996: An interview with Rob Buisson, Keeper of the Kool-Aid FAQ
is featured on page 65 of "Internet Underground".  It is in the October
1996 issue (Issue #11).  The FAQ, the newsgroup and of course Kool-Aid are
discussed.

ShadZ <shadz@rocketmail.com> found this about Kool-Aid in an archie comic...
IN: Betty# 46 (Feb 1997)
PUBLISHER: Archie Comics
TITLE: To Dye For
WRITER: Bill Golliher
ARTISTS: Stan Goldberg & Mike Esposito

PLOT: Veronica is showing off her expensive new hair-do.  Betty is bummed
because she can't afford to do anything new with her hair, until a
12-year-old skateboarder shares the secret of dying hair with Kool-Aid
(refered to in the story as "Cool Juice").  Betty wows everyone at a
party with her new pink hair (thanks to Radical Racoon Rootin' Tootin'
Raspberry flavor Cool Juice), but Jughead can smell her secret . . . (I'd
better stop there before I give away the ending :-) )

+ May 22, 1998 (Reuters press release):  Kool-Aid is declared Nebraska's
+ official state drink to recognize the fact that it was invented in the
+ state 61 years before.

+ August 1998 (exact date unkown): An upcoming article on Kool-Aid Days
+ (see the next section of the FAQ) that may or may not include part of
+ an interview with Paul Dawson-Schmidt, Keeper of the Kool-Aid FAQ.
+ More details will appear here once the story is published (it should
+ be on a Sunday).

If you know of any other media stories about Kool-Aid, please e-mail
Paul Dawson-Schmidt with the details (dawsons@augsburg.edu or
dawsons@visi.com).
