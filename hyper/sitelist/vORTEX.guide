 The Vortex GSM Server -Introduction-

 What is GSM ?

 GSM is a form of speech compression used world wide with mobile phones and
 other such devices. Play back is ay 8khz (the same as real audio)

 What does that have to do with me ?

 Theres a program on Aminet (GIR06.lha) which allows you to listen to
 files encoded using gsm until recently threre were very few sites which
 actually had anything worth listening to , but now thats changed.....

 How has it changed ?

 Two months ago the Vortex gsm server was created with the help of a few
 tools created by the author of GIR06 and by Fortunecity being a very
 generous free web space provider (not to mention tripod also being good).
 The server was intially set up for use by the members of @{"vORTEX" link "vortexinfo" 0} but now
 the site is ready to be used by everyone.
 (note: because the site is hosted by fortunecity slow connects and general
 unsmoothness of play back should be expected , find out how to help with
 that @{"HERE" link "support" 0})

 And thats How the vORTEX gSM sERVER was created.

                     What When Why and Where

 What can I find at on Server ?

 At the Vortex server you will find song that are in gsm format for you to
 listen over the internet in realtime or that you can download and listen
 to them (the best option if you have a 14.4 or less? modem)
 The server web site is also where you can download GIR06 full version from
 aminet or a smaller quick start version, the most uptodate version of the
 prefs file is also available from the site aswell.



 When is it Updated ?

 As a rule it is updated once a fortnight , but if there is a song that i
 particularly like i will most likely sample it and upload it sooner, there
 is a mailing list you can join to keep uptodate with when the site is
 updated & changed.

 Why do you do it ?

 Good Question.

 Where is the 'vORTEX gSM Sever' ?

 At the moment the server is located with FortuneCity and Tripod
 (both free web site providers) but as Im hoping this will change to
 a more reliable and less busy server so that the gsm streams flow smooth
 90% of the time the site can be located at http://vtx.home.ml.org
 (free domain courtest of www.ml.org) if you bookmark the above url
 you will always be at the most recent version of the server.
