  Matters of Honour

Transmission order: No. 301

Production order: No. 301

Captain Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) pays a visit to Vorlon Ambassador Kosh to
personally thank him for saving his life, especially since Kosh had to reveal
his true appearance in the process.

Meanwhile, David Endawi (TUCKER SMALLWOOD) of Earthforce Special Intelligence
arrives on Babylon 5 to investigate the station inhabitant's knowledge of the
Shadows. With Sheridan's permission, Endawi interviews the ambassadors,
station crew and other Babylon 5 residents, claiming he's seeking information
on an unknown alien force. Using camera footage of a Shadow ship retrieved
from an Earth alliance fighter that was destroyed in hyperspace, Endawi
proceeds with his investigation, gathering some interesting information.
Captain Sheridan does not recognize the ship in the photo. Ambassador Delenn
(MIRA FURLAN) claims she's never seen the ship before, but later confides to
Sheridan that she has seen drawings of the vessel. Centauri Ambassador Londo
Mollari (PETER JURASIK) tells Endawi he has seen the vessel in a dream and
Narn citizen G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS) shows Endawi an illustration of a
Shadow ship found in the ancient Narn Book of G'Quon.

Later, Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari meets with Morden of the Shadows (ED
WASSER) to end their alliance. A smug Morden agrees, but presents certain
terms involving territory, including a restriction on the planet Zagros 7.

Marcus Cole (JASON CARTER), a Ranger, arrives at Babylon 5 seeking help from
Captain Sheridan and Ambassador Delenn. He comes to request their assistance
in breaking a Centauri blockade of Zagros 7, the location of a secret
training camp and headquarters for the Rangers. When Sheridan agrees to help,
Marcus presents him with the highly advanced White Star, a new ship which
combines Human, Minbari and Vorlon technology. Sheridan, Ivanova (CLAUDIA
CHRISTIAN), Delenn, Lennier (BILL MUMY) and the White Star crew set out for
Zagros 7, but are surprised to find no Centauri fighters guarding the planet.
Just as they begin to break the blockade, they have their first encounter
with a Shadow vessel and a battle ensues. Sheridan gives the order for
evasive action as the White Star destroys enough mines to allow the Rangers
to escape. As the chase continues, Sheridan makes a risky move, exploiting
the unique qualities of his new ship, allowing the White Star to escape and
destroying the Shadow vessel in the process.

In the end, Endawi returns to Earthdome to report his findings. Back on
Babylon 5, Sheridan calls his most trusted crew, Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE),
Ivanova and Dr. Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS) together with Ambassador Delenn,
Lennier, Ambassador Kosh and Marcus to enact a secret war council designed to
protect them from the powerful evil force and the threat of impending war.
During this meeting, Marcus attempts to befriend a reluctant Ivanova.

  Convictions

Production order: No. 302

Shortly after an anonymous warning of impending chaos is received, the
station's DownBelow is ravaged by a horrible explosion. Around the same time,
a band of Dominican monks from Earth arrive seeking residence on Babylon 5 in
order to study the lives and religions of the various alien races. A second
bomb explodes in the customs area just as Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) is
returning from a trip to Minbar. She is unharmed but Lennier (BILL MUMY) is
injured as they help rescue a Centauri woman who has been trapped under heavy
debris. G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS), no longer an ambassador, is convinced that
the Centauri are behind the bombings. Likewise, Ambassador Londo Mollari
(PETER JURASIK) is sure the Narns are responsible for the problem.

As the explosions continue, Captain Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER), feeling that
the bomber may want to survey his handiwork, suggests they scan the security
surveillance tapes from the affected areas before, during and after the
explosions. Commander Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) enlists the help of Brother
Theo (LOUIS TURENNE) and the other monks to take on the cumbersome, but
crucial task. Meanwhile, Londo and G'Kar, sworn enemies, find themselves
trapped in the same transport tube after it is disabled by one of the bombs.

Ivanova is surprised at how quickly the monks are able to solve the problem
and identify the bomber as Robert Carlson (PATRICK KILPATRICK). When Security
Chief Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) attempts to apprehend the bomber, Carlson asks
to see Captain Sheridan and warns them that he's holding a remote device that
will activate a hidden bomb strong enough to destroy the entire station.
Sheridan agrees to meet Carlson alone, but manages to smuggle in his
communication link under his belt so that Garibaldi can hear what is said. At
gunpoint, the bomber demands that Sheridan provide him with a ship to escape
from Babylon 5. Sheridan tries to buy more time for Garibaldi's men to locate
the bomb by keeping him talking. Sheridan, through his conversation with
Carlson, learns that he went crazy after losing everything that was important
to him. He lost his job, his home and his wife. Then, Carlson discovers
Sheridan's communication link and a panics, attempting to detonate the bomb.
A struggle ensues and the detonation device is knocked from Carlson's hand.

Meanwhile, the bomb is located and attached to a magnetic thruster pack. Just
before Carlson is able to retrieve the device, the bomb is sent into space.
Carlson accepts defeat when there is no explosion after he presses the
detonation button.

As things return to normal, Londo and G'Kar are rescued from the transport
tube and Lennier recovers from his injuries.

  A Day in the Strife

Transmission order: No. 303

Production order: No. 303

Na'Far (STEPHEN MACHT) and his bodyguard Ta'Lon (MARSHALL TEAGUE) arrive on
Babylon 5 with the news that Na'Far has been ordered to replace G'Kar
(ANDREAS KATSULAS) and have him returned to the Narn homeworld. Captain
Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) denies this request and explains that Babylon 5
has promised the former Ambassador G'Kar sanctuary for as long as he
requires. But when Na'Far confronts G'Kar and tells him that the Centauri
have promised to make things very difficult for the families of any Narns on
Babylon 5, unless he returns to the Narn Homeworld, G'Kar is faced with a
difficult decision.

After noticing some strange behavior from Dr. Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS),
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) invites him to dinner and confronts him with
suspicions that he's been misusing prescription artificial stimulants. At
first Franklin tells Garibaldi that it is none of his business, but finally
admits that he's been using these "stims" to stay awake for long shifts in
Med Lab. Garibaldi expresses his concern and Franklin promises to cut back.

After realizing that he and his aide Vir (STEPHEN FURST), have very different
views on the war with the Narns, Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari (PETER
JURASIK) asks Minbari Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) to recommend Vir as the
new Centauri diplomat to Minbar. She agrees, and Vir is awarded this new
position.

Later, a mysterious unknown alien ship enters Babylon 5 space and approaches
the station with a message. It transmits a list of questions, a test of
intelligence of sorts. The message promises advanced technological and
medical information if they answer all the questions correctly. It also
states that they have 24 hours to provide the correct answers or the pod will
self-destruct with a force powerful enough to destroy Babylon 5. Sheridan
orders Ivanova to pursue the answers to the questions.

Ivanova manages to compile the correct answers to all the questions just in
time to prepare them for transmission when Captain Sheridan makes a
surprising tactical decision regarding the situation.

  Passing Trough Gethsemane

Telepath Lyta Alexander (PATRICIA TALLMAN) returns to Babylon 5 as an aide to
Vorlon Ambassador Kosh. Everyone is surprised to learn that she has actually
visited the Vorlon homeworld. Dr. Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS) suggests she
undergo a routine physical after her journey and is puzzled when he finds
that she's in better health than when she left, finding no trace of prior
chronic conditions.

While watching a news broadcast about a murderer on Earth who has been
sentenced to "death of personality," Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) explains to
Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) that this type of punishment has replaced the
death penalty. He explains that a "mindwipe" erases the personality of the
criminal and replaces it with a new one before placing him or her in some
form of community service.

Meanwhile, Brother Edward (BRAD DOURIF), one of the monks who recently
arrived on Babylon 5, is surprised to find a black rose in his tote bag and
the phrase "Death Walks Among Us" in blood on his bedroom wall. When
Garibaldi arrives to investigate, no blood is found on the wall, making
Brother Edward wonder if he is losing his mind. Later in the hallway, Brother
Edward hears a woman screaming and a voice calling out to someone named
Charlie. Again, he sees the words in blood and has a vision of a horrible
murder being committed.

When Brother Edward confides to Brother Theo (LOUIS TURENNE) that he fears
he's possibly having memories of horrible things from the past, Brother Theo
asks Captain Sheridan for help. Both Brother Edward and Sheridan's crew set
out to investigate his past, using the clues they have found. It turns out
that Brother Edward was a former murderer who was sentenced to death of
personality, but a family member of one of the victims didn't feel the
punishment suited the crimes, so he hired a Centauri telepath to help break
the mindwipe, bringing back the memories before planning to kill him.

  Voices of Authority

Transmission order: No. 305

Production order: No. 304

Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) invites Draal (JOHN SCHUCK) from the planet
below to a meeting of the secret alliance consisting of Sheridan (BRUCE
BOXLEITNER), Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) and Marcus
(JASON CARTER). Draal tells the group about the great machine running the
planet below, a machine that has information on the First Ones, a race that
fought the Shadows many times over the past million years. If the secret
alliance could be associated with the First Ones, it would prove very useful
in their battle against the mysterious Shadows. Sheridan accepts Draal's
invitation to visit the planet and retrieve the information.

Later, G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS) approaches Delenn with his suspicions
surrounding the meetings of the secret alliance and the "Rangers."

Meanwhile, Julie Musante (SHARI SHATTUCK) of Earth's Ministry of Peace
arrives on Babylon 5. Musante informs Sheridan that she has been sent by the
Ministry of Peace, Night Watch Division, to be his new political officer.
When Sheridan argues that he doesn't need a political advisor, Musante tells
him that Earth's senate disagrees, citing his recent actions and decisions
regarding the Narns, Centauri and Minbari. Sheridan becomes very upset that
his authority and decisions are in question by his government. Not wanting to
arouse the suspicion of the secret alliance, Sheridan asks Ivanova to take
his place at the meeting with Draal, so he can meet with the Musante.

Draal, who was expecting Sheridan, is upset when Ivanova arrives in his
place, but Ivanova's quick wit wins him over and he allows her to stay. Draal
hooks up Ivanova to the matrix, a holographic system, and encourages her to
stay focused and keep an open mind. While attached to the machine, Ivanova
has two telepathic visions: one that implicates current Earthforce President
Clark in the assassination of former President Santiago; the other of making
contact with the First Ones on a planet known as Sigma 957. Ivanova records
the vision onto a datacrystal and uplinks the information back to Sheridan
and Garibaldi, who release it to Earthdome.

Back on Babylon 5, Musante's meeting with Sheridan takes an interesting turn
when she attempts to seduce him. Ivanova's return provides an interruption,
however, and Sheridan manages to escape Musante's allure.

Ivanova and Marcus set out for Sigma 957 in an attempt to connect with the
First Ones. After making initial contact, a clever-talking Ivanova manages to
pursuade the First Ones to join their cause. She is instructed to venture to
Sigma 957 "when it is time" and "they will be there."

Finally, Musante is forced to return to Earthdome to deal with a crisis
involving rumors that implicate President Clark in an assassination
conspiracy.

  Dust to Dust

Transmission order: No. 306

Production order: No. 306

Mr. Bester (WALTER KOENIG), an elite Psi-cop, informs Sheridan (BRUCE
BOXLEITNER) of his plans to visit Babylon 5 in pursuit of an individual he
feels poses a threat to Babylon 5, Earth and the Psi Corps. Sheridan believes
he is coming to engage in unauthorized mind scans and is afraid Bester will
uncover not only the group's involvement with the Rangers, but also the fact
that they've been providing evidence in the assassination of President's
Santiago.

Upon Bester's arrival, a determined Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) decides to
take matters into her own hands and prepares to fire on his vessel. However,
Sheridan comes in at the last second and de-activates the defense grid. Using
an alternative plan devised by Delenn (MIRA FURLAN), Sheridan, Ivanova,
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) and Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS) surround themselves with
Minbari telepaths and block Bester's mind flow. Franklin then injects a serum
into a reluctant Bester, temporarily suppressing his abilities to scan.

Bester informs the group about a dangerous drug called Dust, which enhances
the telepathic gene and allows a person to invade the mind of another and
experience their entire life in a matter of minutes. Bester believes one of
the main distributors for Dust has come to Babylon 5 with the intention of
selling massive quantities to foreign governments who will use it as a weapon
to learn the secrets of their enemy.

Meanwhile, Vir (STEPHEN FURST) returns from his first diplomatic trip to
Minbar and attempts to pursuade a skeptical Londo (PETER JURASIK) that the
Minbari can be trusted.

G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS) secretly meets with Lindstrom (GEORGE GERDES), the
supplier of Dust. Before making a transaction, G'Kar insists on sampling the
drug to experience its merits. He injects it into himself and seeks out his
enemy, Londo, in order to get into his mind.

Bester and Garibaldi question Ashi (PHILIP MOON), a man with strong ties to
the black market. Ashi informs them of an incoming shipment of Dust arriving
later that day. Using this privileged information, Bester and Garibaldi bust
Lindstrom and his men. They interrogate them to find out with whom they are
doing business. Bester and Garibaldi's questioning is interrupted by a
security guard who informs them that a drugged G'Kar is on the rampage, and
has ventured into Londo's quarters, after having knocking Vir unconscious.

While in Londo's mind, G'Kar discovers that Londo was given the Ambassador
job at Babylon 5 because no one else wanted it. He also finds out that he was
responsible for the death of ten thousand Narns in Quadrant 37. G'Kar then
experiences a vision of his father, and of the God G'lan who tells him he
must keep his honor. They instruct him to accept the notion that the Narns
and Centauri are not fighting to kill one another, but rather to save one
another. In order to achieve this however, some must be sacrificed if all are
to be saved. The drug wears off, and an enlightened G'Kar has a new sense of
peace.

G'Kar pleads guilty to the use and purchase of prohibited materials and is
sentenced to the prison facilities for a period of no less than sixty days.
Having accomplished his goal, Bester returns to earth.

  Exogenesis

Transmission order: No. 307

Production order: No. 307

Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) instructs Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) to set up a
private meeting with newly-promoted Lieutenant Corwin (JOSHUA COX) to
discover whether he can help their cause. Corwin misinterprets her
intentions, believing Ivanova is asking him out on a date. When the two
finally meet, Ivanova discovers Corwin would not be an ally of the Rangers
because of his claim that we would not act against any orders sent by
Earthdome.

Marcus (JASON CARTER) gets word from one of his informants that the Rangers
should go on a heightened state of alert and pull back from Earth space due
to a gathering of Shadow vessels on the edge of Centauri space. Marcus gives
instructions to drop a long-range scanner in the area of build-up.

Meanwhile, Dr. Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS) is baffled upon the discovery of
several people who have died as the result of a small, unknown, alien
parasite which lodges itself onto the spinal cord of its victims.

When Samuel (ERIC STEINBERG) and Duncan (AUBREY MORRIS), several of Marcus's
liaisons, disappear, Franklin and Marcus go to their Downbelow quarters to
investigate. They are surprised to find several Lurkers, including Samuel and
Duncan, armed and an unconscious man on the floor. Being held captive for
their accidental discovery, Franklin and Marcus learn that the parasite is a
way of serving a race known as the Vindrizi, and by voluntarily accepting the
parasite, the person is actually merging with their race. For some, like
Duncan, it improves their health, however, for those whose body's reject it,
it's lethal.

The Vindrizi seek out those who have nothing to look forward to, namely
Lurkers, and give them the gift of life. By accepting the parasite, their
host bodies are instilled with vast memories of all that has been seen and
touched. Their mission is to preserve all of these memories until the
inevitable day when all life and knowledge falls into a new dark age, Then,
all will turn to them, and they will be keepers of the past.

After Marcus confesses his fondness for Ivanova to Franklin, Samuel and
Duncan take Franklin to a room where a Lurker is ill with the parasite in his
spine. Franklin is ordered to heal him, but he claims he cannot without the
proper medical equipment.

Left alone and fearing danger, Marcus convinces one of his captures that his
pike is actually a medical scanner which might be useful to Franklin. When he
talks his capture into looking through the pike, the man unknowingly arms it
and knocks himself out. Then, Marcus signals Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) on
Franklin's link, and Garibaldi sends several guards to their aid. Marcus then
finds his way into the room where Franklin is being held, and together they
subdue their captures.

Seeing no other choice and knowing it can never be reattached, Duncan pulls
out the parasite as a show of loyalty, and to convince Franklin of his belief
in the Vindrizi cause. A convinced Franklin ultimately accepts the methods
and principles employed by the Vindrizi cause. A convinced Franklin
ultimately accepts the methods and principles employed by the Vindrizi, and
promises to keep them secret, but only under his direct supervision.
Relegated back to what he believes to be his life without purpose, Duncan
leaves Babylon 5.

Production order: No. 308

Senate hearings continue on Earth investigating claims that President Clark
had faked an illness which prevented him from boarding Earthforce One when it
exploded, killing President Santiago. Representatives from President Clark
dismissed the allegations as attempts to destabilize the government.

Marcus (JASON CARTER) rescues Dr. Mary Kirkish (NANCY STAFFORD) from a group
of assailants attempting to subdue her. Regaining consciousness, Dr. Kirkish
explains to Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER), Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN), Delenn
(MIRA FURLAN), Marcus, Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS), Lennier (BILL MUMY) and
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), that her life is in danger because of information
she knows. While stationed on Mars conducting an archaeological dig, she
discovered a Shadow ship buried three hundred feet below the surface, and
witnessed one of the workers die instantly after touching the ship with his
bare hand. Following orders to stop digging, Dr. Kirkish recalls the arrival
of a second Shadow ship, which had come to dig out the discovered vessel.
Threatened by Earth to keep the incident secret, she and the other
archaeologists were assigned by Earth to different worlds to ensure that
nobody spoke to one another. Garibaldi, who was stationed on Mars at roughly
the same time, confirms that he also witnessed several unknown alien ships.

Recently called into a new dig, because another Shadow ship was discovered on
Ganymede, Dr. Kirkish uncovers secret government plans to bring the ship to
Earth in seventy-two hours to study its secrets and learn how to use it --
against other races or fellow Earth inhabitants if necessary. Realizing the
danger surrounding Dr. Kirkish, Delenn makes plans to get her into Minbari
space for protection.

Officials begin to covertly search out those with information. Night Watch
Security suspects the captain and several crew members of having their own
agenda, and instruct Zack to confront Sheridan.

Sheridan makes the decision to try to prevent Earth from getting their hands
on the Shadow ship. Along with Delenn, he commands the Minbari ship White
Star into earth-controlled space with the intentions of finding and
destroying the vessel before it leaves Ganymede. When the White Star emerges
from its jump point, it sets off all long-range scanners, sending a Shadow
ship on the attack. The White Star fires upon it, causing little damage.
Captain Sheridan orders the ship to go inside the thick atmosphere of nearby
Jupiter, hoping the extreme atmosphere and gravity will help destroy the
Shadow vessel. Venturing deeper into space, the White Star's outer hull
begins to buckle, but not before the Shadow implodes from the severe
gravitational pull.

Attempting to get out of the atmosphere, they encounter the destroyer
Agamemnon, which instructs the White Star to surrender. Knowing they will be
blamed for the attack, Sheridan finds himself in a dilemma -- fire upon his
old ship or surrender. Left with little choice, he decides to take a chance
and opens up the jump gates inside the atmosphere, something never done
before, and successfully makes it back to Babylon 5.

President Clark signs a decree declaring martial law throughout Earth
Central, citing threats to planetary security.

At Londo's (PETER JURASIK) persistent urging, Lady Morella (MAJEL BARRETT), a
prophetess and third wife of the deceased Emperor Turhan, agress to visit
Babylon 5 with her entourage and tour the facilities. However, Londo's true
motive for the visit is to have her reveal his future.

With martial law imposed on Earth, Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) speaks to Lt.
General O'Reilly (ED TROTTA) who informs him that President Clark has issued
an executive order dissolving the Senate. Following this news, the Elite
Guard opens fire on the Senate building, setting off a wave of riots and
unrest on Earth.

General Hague, the captain's main contact on Earth, issues a communiqu  on
his way back from Io, telling Sheridan that he and the others on Babylon 5
are on their own. Sensing the threat that Earth or other governments will
move against them, Sheridan orders combat readiness. Believing that General
Hague is organizing a counter strike against President Clark, Garibaldi
(JERRY DOYLE) suspects the General may be coming to Babylon 5.

General Smits (LEWIS ARQUETTE) brings news that the Political Office has
assigned responsibility for all off-world security to Nightwatch personnel
exclusively. Zack (JEFF CONAWAY) is ordered to a Nightwatch meeting and is
informed of the change in policy. When an angry Garibaldi shows up and pleads
with the group to reconsider their allegiance with Nightwatch, he gets
escorted out by a reluctant Zack.

In light of the current crisis, Garibaldi lets G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS) out
of prison early. As he walks to his quarters, he is greeted by Ta'Lon
(MARSHALL TEAGUE). G'Kar tells him that while incarcerated, he had a
revelation - to save our people, we must sacrifice out people.

Meanwhile, Sheridan receives orders from Earth Alliance declaring martial law
effective immediately on Babylon 5. When the captain announces this to the
inhabitants on board, a riot breaks out. When an object is thrown in the
crowd, Vir (STEPHEN FURST) steps in front of Lady Morella and absorbs the
impact of the blow.

Later, Morella confronts Londo of his true intentions for her visit and he
confesses. Eventually, Lady Morella looks into future and tells Londo that he
will one day become emperor. She then turns to Vir and tells him he also will
be emperor, much to his surprise. When asked what this means, Lady Morella
explains that one will become emperor after the other dies.

Realizing they must get through Nightwatch in order to reach General Hague,
Zack is approached by Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS), Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN),
Garibaldi, G'Kar and Sheridan.

With Zack's help, false information is passed to Nightwatch of arrival of a
ship containing several hundred Narns who are ordered by Sheridan to serve as
replacements for Nightwatch personnel. With this information, the Security
Guard for Nightwatch instructs his group to ambush the Narns upon arrival.
With all Nightwatch standing inside a customs bay, the doors lock, capturing
the entire group.

Sheridan places them under arrest for mutiny and failure to obey the chain of
command. With all security personnel incarcerated, Sheridan places a group of
Narns on security patrol. G'Kar later confronts Sheridan wanting to be part
of the new alliance.

Finally, through an ISN telecast, news spreads that General Hague's vessel
was surrounded by Earthforce cruisers and ordered to surrender, but he
miraculously managed to escape.

General Hague's Earthforce destroyer, the Alexander, arrives at Babylon 5,
seeking refuge after suffering heavy damage in a battle. When Major Ed Ryan
(BRUCE McGILL) disembarks from the ship, he informs Captain Sheridan (BRUCE
BOXLEITNER) of news that the General had been killed during their last
firefight.

Drakhen (JAMES PARKS), a Minbari Ranger recently injured, passes along
important information to Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) and Lennier (BILL MUMY) that
the Shadows have made alliances with many of the non-aligned worlds, urging
them to war with their neighbors. They were persuaded for fear that if they
did not, they would be conquered by the Centauri.

Meanwhile, the head of the Mars Provisional Government announces plans to
refuse the implementation of the martial law order given to him by the
President. Responding to this act of defiance, President Clark orders
bombings on Mars. Other colonies quickly join Mars in seeking to break away
from the Earth alliance -- vowing to remain independent states until the
President is impeached. Fearing the release of this information, President
Clark sends armed troops to shut down the ISN Broadcasting Center.

Delenn leaves Babylon 5 to speak to the Grey Council, and reprimands them for
standing silent rather than taking on the burden of war. Suggesting the
Council be broken up, Delenn convinces five of the nine members to come with
her and join the cause.

Sandra Hiroshi (KIM MIYORI), captain of the Churchill, signals Babylon 5
after intercepting attack orders relayed to two destroyers to seize Babylon
5, arrest and detain Captain Sheridan and the rest of the command staff and
put the station under direct authority of the President of Nightwatch.
Knowing that they have six hours until the ships arrive, the crew agrees to
fight rather than surrender. Commander Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) asks
permission to join the Starfury squadron to help fight, which Captain
Sheridan reluctantly agrees to.

When the destroyers arrive and move in for the attack, a breaching pod
latches onto the hull, bringing a stream of Marines into Babylon 5.
Anticipating this, Garibaldi quickly instructs a group of Narn and Human
security guards to post up and cut them off. A battle ensues between Marines
and Garibaldi's (JERRY DOYLE) forces.

Helping fight off the first wave of destroyers in a fierce air battle,
Ivanova is forced to eject out of her damaged plane, seconds before it
crashes into an enemy cruiser. Fortunately, she escapes with bruises and a
fractured rib. Captain Sheridan becomes concerned upon discovering the next
wave of destroyers moving in. However, Delenn returns with three Minbari
heavy cruisers and a white star, and together they swoop in forming an
invincible presence that causes the aggressor ships to retreat.

In the end, thirty percent of Sheridan's Starfuries were either disabled or
destroyed, along with the Churchill. For their invaluable assistance,
Sheridan agrees to house the crew of the Churchill.

  Ceremonies of Light and Dark

Transmission order: No. 311

Production order: No. 311

A ceremony is held, including Babylon 5 crew members and Starfury pilots, to
honor the memory and names of those who gave their lives defending Babylon 5.

Having seceded from Earth, groups of Nightwatch personnel are being shipped
off Babylon 5, but some still linger. One of those siding with Nightwatch, a
sniper (PAUL PERRI), seeks his own justice, and aims his rifle at Sheridan
(BRUCE BOXLEITNER). At the last minute, he gets interrupted by Boggs (DON
STROUD), also from Nightwatch, who claims the time isn't right and that he
should wait.

Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) and Lennier (BILL MUMY) urge the crew and the key
ambassadors to participate in a rebirth ceremony to commemorate the great
change that is coming. The ritual includes a part for all participants to
expose a personal secret.

Londo (PETER JURASIK) meets with Lord Refa (WILLIAM FORWARD), a fellow
Centauri who he summoned to Babylon 5. Londo plays a tape of a past
conversation he had with Mr. Morden, recounting how Lord Refa will help aid
the Shadows in securing the planet. Londo, expressing his concern over the
Centauri's unfocused aggression, feels that by drawing their attention to
many smaller wars, they have weakened their main line of defense, making them
a vulnerable target. He asks Refa to break off the relationship with Mr.
Morden and poisons his drink to guarantee his cooperation. Londo also asks
Refa to bolster the lines of defense around Centauri Prime or else he will
receive the second half of the poison, which is certain to be deadly.

Meanwhile, Boggs and the sniper get new orders from Nightwatch instructing
them to focus their aggression towards Ambassador Delenn, since she was the
persuasive force who got the Minbari warships to protect Babylon 5. Their
plan includes setting up Sheridan to make him look as if he had done it. When
Lenann (KIM STRAUSS), a captain from one of the Minbari warships, requests
permission to tour Babylon 5, Delenn agrees to escort them. On the way back
from the docking bay, she, Lennier and Lenann are ambushed by a group of men,
including Boggs and the sniper. Lennier, Lenann, Delenn and a Minbari aide
are forced to go with their captors.

Boggs then links up a monitor to Sheridan, and issues orders for him to send
the Minbari cruisers away within six hours or else he will kill Lenann and
Delenn. To prove his threat, Boggs kills one of the Minbari aides wounded in
the ambush. However, tracing sounds from the transmission, Sheridan, Ivanova
(CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) and Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) uncover the captures
approximate location. In the meantime, Marcus (JASON CARTER) meets one of his
contacts and uses force to get more specific information concerning the
whereabouts of Delenn and Lenann.

Quickly losing patience, the sniper takes it upon himself to shoot Delenn,
but Lenann manages to hurl himself toward the sniper, causing him to miss his
target. However, in the ensuing fight, Lenann gets shot. As he turns to shoot
Delenn, Boggs comes storming in, and argues to keep Delenn alive until their
agreement is met.

Accessing past images on the security system, Sheridan and Garibaldi trick
the captors in to believing the Minbari ships have left; and that Sheridan
has surrendered. Knowing their location, Sheridan and Garibaldi plan a leak
in the nearby fusion reactor which creates a diversion and sends Boggs and
the sniper running. They are met by Sheridan's forces and a fight ensues.
Boggs is subdued by Ivanova, while the sniper, having lost his gun, pulls out
a knife and runs toward Sheridan. Seeing what is about to happen, Delenn runs
in front of the knife and takes the impact intended for Sheridan. Sheridan
chases after the sniper and captures him.

With Delenn recovering from her wound in Medlab, Sheridan requests the
rebirth ceremony take place there, and confesses how much he cares for her.
Garibaldi confesses that he is afraid, Ivanova divulges she loved Talia,
while Franklin admits he has a problem. As her gift for participating in the
ritual, Delenn gives them their new uniforms, which proudly displays the
Ranger symbol and a new "Babylon 5" logo.

  Sic Transit Vir

Transmission order: No. 312

Production order: No. 313

Londo has a surprise for Vir when he introduces him to Lyndisty, a Centauri
woman and recent arrival to Babylon 5. Londo explains that through a
prearranged agreement between Vir's uncle and mother, Lyndisty is to be Vir's
wife, much to his surprise.

Zack alerts Ivanova about an unusually large influx of Narns coming to
Babylon 5. Ivanova isn't suspicious until she discovers that they were all
approved through Vir's office on Minbar. When she confronts Vir, he claims
that the transfer of Narns is actually part of a work program. Without
authority to approve such transfers, he forged a fake identity to ensure
their relocation.

Meanwhile, Sheridan asks Delenn out on a date, and she graciously accepts. As
the two enjoy a romantic dinner at his quarters, they are interrupted by news
from security of an assault in progress. When Sheridan arrives, he finds Vir
struggling with a Narn armed with a knife. Sheridan joins in the fight, and
subdues the Narn long enough for Zack to arrive. The Narn still manages to
charge, and security guards intervene and shoot the attacker.

Ivanova confronts Londo, who confesses to knowing nothing of Vir's actions.
When Ivanova approaches Vir, he finally confesses the truth: those relocated
were mostly females and children injured when the Centauri bombed their
world. Since they weren't receiving proper medical treatment, he had them
transferred to other worlds to get them proper care. When they were healthy,
Vir filtered them back to several places, including Babylon 5.

Later, Lyndisty brings Vir to her quarters for a surprise. What he discovers
are the two Narns lying hurt on the floor, one of them being his assailant.
Lyndisty confesses that they were actually intending to harm her, not Vir,
since she took part in the pacification of many Narn populations following
the war. These two had escaped and were looking to kill her. Lyndisty asks
Vir to finish them off as a testimony to their marriage, but he refuses.

Londo ends Vir's tenure as the Centauri liaison to Minbar, and informs Vir
that the marriage with Lyndisty has been put on hold as a result of the
recent developments. Lyndisty leaves Babylon 5, but expresses that she will
continue to wait for him. Vir, however, knows that their beliefs are far too
different to overcome.

Unbeknownst to Londo, Ivanova keeps Vir's fake identity at the Centauri
Relocation Bureau so that he can continue to keep issuing travel papers to
those Narns in need of help.

  A Late Delivery from Avalon

Transmission order: No. 313

Production order: No. 312

Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) and Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) ask Londo (PETER
JURASIK) if the Centauri government will recognize Babylon 5 as an
independent state, and he refuses. Meanwhile, G'Kar ( ) agrees to acknowledge
the independence of Babylon 5, and vows to contribute to the defense of the
station.

Arthur (MICHAEL YORK) arrives at Babylon 5 dressed in knight's clothing,
believing he is the legend. Marcus (JASON CARTER) and Franklin (RICHARD
BIGGS) meet Arthur and take him to Medlab, which he reluctantly agrees to.
With no identification, travel papers or knowledge of how he got to Babylon
5, Franklin takes a DNA sequence to discover his real identity. Arthur
escapes, and eventually befriends G'Kar, who he refers to as Sir G'Kar, the
Red Knight.

Meanwhile, Sheridan addresses the Members of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds
and unveils the Babylon Treaty. In exchange for using the facility as neutral
territory to use for peace negotiations, the participants must agree to ask
their respective governments to take part in the ongoing defense of Babylon
5. With the Drazi ambassador appointed spokesman of the league, a number of
governments comply to make the treaty an effective policy of defense.

From the DNA sequence, Marcus learns that Arthur is actually David McIntyre,
a man who was honorably discharged from Earthforce several years ago. He was
a gunnery sergeant on the Prometheus, one of the first ships to encounter the
Minbari, and took part in what was to become history when he was ordered to
fire upon a passing Minbari vessel which had its gun ports open. The captain
misinterpreted this Minbari sign of respect as a threat, and his unlawful
attack killed Dukhat, the Minbari leader, thus starting the Earth-Minbari
war. He was never able to put the incident behind him, living with recurring
nightmares despite being absolved of all responsibilities by the review
board.

Marcus and Franklin realize from the legend of King Arthur that if they took
away his sword, or the symbol of his pain, he may regain his old identity.
Using Delenn's (MIRA FURLAN) help, he eventually gives up his sword, and his
past torment. In the end, G'Kar takes him to his people, promising that
Arthur will be placed in a prominent position of authority in the resistance
-- perhaps the start of a new round table.

  Ship of Tears

Transmission order: No. 314

Production order: No. 114

Having been destroyed by President Clark's troops, The Intersteller Network
News (ISN) returns to the airwaves. Through an ISN reporter, they falsely
explain the reason for their absence was the result of an attack on their
facilities by the saboteurs intent on paralyzing all Earth communications
systems.

While piloting a new Starfury, Sheridan answers an earth distress call, which
turns out to be Psi Cop Bester. Bester tells Sheridan that they must talk,
believing that they can help each other out. A reluctant and skeptical
Sheridan escorts him to Babylon 5.

Meanwhile, G'Kar approaches Ivanova requesting to become a part of the new
alliance as promised by Sheridan. Before agreeing to this, Delenn confesses
to G'Kar of knowing that the Shadows had become allies with the Centauri, and
worked together to overtake the Narn. The Grey Council, realizing nobody
would believe them, chose to remain silent with their knowledge.

Bester reveals to Sheridan and Ivanova that President Clark is relying on the
Shadows to make important decisions, and they have managed to infiltrate the
Psi Corps. Bester explains details of a convoy of ships containing supplies
for the Shadows. If they were able to seize the ship, they could deprive the
Shadows of precious weapons capabilities. Utilizing the White Star, they
manage to capture the transport ship, but not before encountering a Shadow
ship. Unloading the cargo, they uncover hundreds of cryogenic tubes with Psi
Corps in a suspended state. Bester recognizes one in particular and describes
her as Carolyn (JOAN McMURTREY), a telepath who has refused to join the
corps. She is unloaded from the ship and brought to Medlab for observation.
Mysteriously, Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS) later discovers that the medical
instruments in Carolyn's room have torn themselves out of the walls and
ceiling and wrapped themselves around her body like a cocoon.

Bester insists on talking to her. When she sees him, she calls for him to
help her, but then shoots a bolt of concentrated electricity from her hand
towards Bester that he barely escapes. Suddenly, Bester has a "mind-flash"
and discovers that the Shadows have operated on Carolyn, and programmed her
to attack anything related to the Psi Corps.

Bester confesses to Sheridan that Carolyn is his true love who is pregnant
with their child. As a result of Carolyn's state, Bester declares his
allegiance in helping Sheridan fight the Shadows.

Using the Book of G'Quan, Garibaldi discovers that Carolyn and the other Psi
Corps members who were captured were programmed by the Shadows to protect
them against telepaths. Realizing the Shadows are scared of telepaths,
Sheridan recognizes that he now has a weapon to use against them. This
discovery comes just in time, as Ivanova receives a report that the Shadows
have opened up an attack on Brakiri space.

With the Shadows on the attack, Sheridan arranges a meeting with Gaim
Ambassador She'Lah and Brakiri to ask for their cooperation. Sheridan pleads
that with their help, other worlds would join the resistance. Ambassador
She'lah refuses, explaining that they do not want to provoke the Shadows.

An excited Londo is busy making last-minute arrangements for Adira Tyree, his
true love, who is on her way to Babylon 5 for a visit. Prior to her arrival,
Morden confronts Londo about the reduced military campaign that the Centauri
are undertaking. Londo, however, believes he is being used as a distraction
for the Shadows. When Morden threatens Londo, dictating that he better not
violate the terms of their agreement, a confident Londo dismisses him.

Later, when Morden finds out about Londo's prized guest, Adira, he bribes a
guard to have her poisoned. Londo, believing the act was in retaliation of
his poisoning Lord Refa, vows revenge and asks Morden to help him get back at
Lord Refa.

Dr. Franklin begins to perform erratically as a result of his addiction to
stims. His most recent mistake almost costs him the life of a patient, but he
is saved when Dr. Hobbs intervenes. Garibaldi confronts a resentful Franklin
who denies there is a problem. Garibaldi asks Dr. Hobbs to pull Dr.
Franklin's blood samples, which she refuses, but leaves him the access code
to obtain the information. Garibaldi attempts to get the information, but
morally cannot go through with it, feeling that he is betraying his friend.
Franklin, witnessing this act, realizes that he actually does have an
addiction and confesses to Sheridan. Knowing he cannot perform his duties,
Franklin resigns as chief of staff of the medlab facility.

Realizing he must score a major victory over the Shadows to get others to
join the cause, Sheridan approaches Kosh, asking to convince the Vorlon
government to send out an expedition to engage in a battle against the
Shadows. Kosh says it is not time yet, but a determined Sheridan eventually
convinces him to help. However, Kosh says that by doing this favor, he will
not be there to help him when he goes to Z'ha'dum, as he had promised. The
Vorlon fleet destroys several shadow vessels, scoring the victory Sheridan
needed. In retaliation, Morden, with the help of several shadow vessels,
kills Kosh in his quarters, leaving behind only his shattered headpiece. Not
wanting news of Kosh's death to spread, fearing it would destroy the fragile,
new alliance just formed with other world's, the crew and Vorlon government
agree to send a replacement. As a final act, the Vorlon government asks that
Kosh's encounter suit be placed in his ship.

  War Without End, Part I

Transmission order: No. 316

Production order: No. 316

Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) hears a distress signal of her own voice coming
from Sector 14, the area where Babylon 4 had disappeared. Garibaldi (JERRY
DOYLE) reveals that the signal may be coming from the future and explains
that when Babylon 4 reappeared two years ago, he and Commander Sinclair
(MICHAEL O'HARE) went on board to evacuate the crew. While there, he
experienced a flash into the future where he saw the fall of Babylon 5. A
concerned Sheridan sends Gairbaldi to Sector 14 to check the area.

Jeffrey Sinclair summoned by a note locked and sealed for over nine hundred
years, arrives at Babylon 5. Delenn (MIRA FURLAN), also receiving a note,
explains to Captain Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) that the time had come for
them to take the White Star to Sector 14, immediately. In explaining why,
Delenn recounts history and details how the Minbari, with the help of the
Vorlons and a few others, were able to defeat the Shadows when they last
fought a thousand years ago. However, to achieve this victory, their side
needed a long range base of operations from which to launch their forces.
Babylon 4 was the answer, and they took it into the distant past to help
defeat the Shadows.

With the reappearance of Babylon 4 two years ago, allies of the Shadows sent
ships to destroy it, but something mysteriously had prevented this from
happening. Delenn reveals to a shocked Sheridan that he was responsible for
stopping them. Continuing on, she explains that with the aid of The Great
Machine on Epsilon 3, which is enlarging the temporal rift in Sector 14, they
need to go back six years into the past to prevent the destruction of Babylon
4. If successful, they must move the station ahead to the present time.
Delenn carefully warns Sheridan, and the crew, that failure to save Babylon 4
would ultimately result in the destruction of Babylon 5. To prove her story,
Delenn explains that the distress call Ivanova encountered was the
alternative future calling for help. Zathras, one of Draal's aides from
Epsilon 3, is sent to assist the crew in their mission.

At the urging of Sinclair, Sheridan instructs an angry Garibaldi to return to
Babylon 5 and instructs him not to mention Sinclair's presence on the White
Star. Upon arrival, Zack informs him that Sinclair had been to the station,
and an unbelieving Garibaldi, checking his messages, eventually accesses a
message from Sinclair that wasn't supposed to be opened yet. In the
communication, Sinclair explains to Garibaldi that he won't be returning from
Babylon 4, and that Garibaldi would be suffering the same fate had he
accompanied them on the journey.

Upon descending on Babylon 4, Sheridan and the crew spot six Shadow fighters
with grapples holding a fusion bomb. Sheridan intercepts their course and
destroys some of the enemy ships, but not before the bomb goes off, sweeping
the White Star in a massive shockwave. In the explosion, Sheridan's time
stabilizer is damaged, causing him to disappear, and stick in time. When
Sheridan awakens, it is eighteen years later and he is in a Centauri palace
next to an aged Londo, who is now emperor, sitting on a throne and telling
Sheridan he will die.

  War Without End, Part II

Transmission order: No. 317

Production order: No. 317

When Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) appears seventeen years in the future, Londo
(PETER JURASIK) sits on the throne. Centauri Prime has been left in ruins as
a result of the war, and an angry Londo, feeling the Centauri were abandoned,
tells Sheridan he will kill him for the role he played in the war. Later, for
secretive reasons, Londo explains to Sheridan and an aged Delenn (MIRA
FURLAN), that they are his last hope for redemption. Londo tells them to take
his ship and escape in exchange for their help in freeing his world. They
agree, and as Sheridan and Delenn race toward the vessel, Sheridan gets
pulled back in time again, but not before Delenn warns him not to go to
Z'ha'dum.

From knowledge passed along by Delenn, Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) speaks to
Marcus (RICHARD BIGGS) about Valen, the great leader, and one of the
Minbari's holiest figures, who defeated the Shadows and formed the Grey
Council. Ivanova wonders if they will get a chance to meet him during their
travels.

To divert the attention of the Babylon 4 crew, so that a homing device can be
placed in the central core of Babylon 4 to move the station through time,
Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) and Ivanova rig the pressure alarms to go off. This
action would leave Major Krantz (KENT BROADHURST) commander of Babylon 4,
with no choice but to evacuate the crew for fear that the station would
destruct. However, when Ivanova rigs the scanners, the time device activates
prematurely moving the station four years ahead.

Meanwhile, Lennier (BILL MUMY) discovers several ships approaching. When
asked who they could be, Sinclair explains it is him and Garibaldi, when they
arrived two years ago to answer a distress call from Babylon 4.

In the time flash, Sheridan again disappears, and Sinclair, who had
previously passed unprotected through the time distortion field with
Garibaldi, ages twenty years. Meanwhile, Sheridan phases in and out in view
to Zathras (TIM CHOATE), and his broken time stabilizer falls to the floor.
Again returning to the future, he finds himself in a cell with Delenn, who
tells him their son, David, is safe now.

Zathras, attempting to fix Sheridan's time stabilizer, gets caught by
security guards and is taken to a lockup area. While there, he explains to
Sinclair the need to use Babylon 4 as a base of operations in the war to help
save the galaxy. When a blue-suited figure appears phasing in and out,
Zathras explains he is the One, and hands the figure the fixed stabilizer
before he vanishes. Zathras then declares it time to leave or suffer the fate
of being trapped in time forever. Sheridan the reappears, the result of his
time stabilizer being switched by the One.

Sinclair commands Babylon 4 back to the distant past, explaining the reason
that brought him to the present in the first place was the letter received
(see episode #316), which had been written by him nine hundred years ago. In
the note, he described these events as they had unfolded -- including him
taking Babylon 4 back in time.

  Walkabout

Transmission order: No. 318

Production order: No. 318

Sheridan convenes a meeting of the war council with the Ambassadors and
details his suspicions about how the Shadows are vulnerable to telepathic
interference. From past encounters, Sheridan believes that a telepath may be
able to jam their central operating system, leaving them susceptible to
attack. In an effort to test this theory, he makes plans to take the White
Star, accompanied by a skeleton crew including resident telepath Lyta
Alexander, and engage one of the Shadow fleet ships. Sheridan asks the
Ambassadors if they could lend their assistance by sending along backup
ships. Delenn agrees and suggests they also bind in a few Minbari telepaths
in case Lyta's telepathic powers don't prove strong enough. G'Kar asks was
leader Na'Kal if they could use one of the Narn ships for this important
mission, but he refuses. Later, an agitated Garibaldi confronts G'Kar about
Na'Kals decision, and implores him to rethink their stance.

After setting out for a precise area, Sheridan and the crew encounter a
Shadow vessel and Lyta freezes the ship so that the White Star can attack. In
need of additional fire power, Lennier turns the jump engines off-line,
leaving them unable to jump for 20 minutes. The White Star eventually
destroys the enemy, but not before the ship sends out a distress signal for
help. Four Shadow vessels answer the call, and a stranded Sheridan, still 10
minutes away from being able to jump, is left with no choice but to outrun
the Shadows. The backup Minbari ship comes to the air of the White Star,
armed with three telepaths who attempt to influence and slow down the four
Shadow ships.

Being pursued by the one Shadow vessel, not affected by a telepath, the White
Star loses ground and is on the verge of being overtaken. At the last minute,
to the surprise of everyone, the Narn war cruiser emerges, flanked by G'Kar
and several other fighters who successfully manage to chase away the Shadows.

Meanwhile, Garibaldi tracks down Dr. Franklin who hasn't been seen for
several days. Franklin explains that he has no idea who he is anymore and in
an effort to find himself, is embarking on a journey he refers to as
"walkabout." A determined Franklin claims that he will walk every inch of the
station until he finds himself once again.

On his journey, Franklin meets a singer named Cailyn and a mutual attraction
develops. Going back to her apartment, they spend some intimate time
together. When she learns he is a doctor, Cailyn asks him about getting the
narcotic Metazine. He strongly refuses. As Franklin sleeps, Cailyn goes
through his belonging and steals his identicard. When he awakens, Franklin
finds her unconscious on the floor, clutching a vial of Metazine. Later at
Medlab, Franklin discovers that Cailyn used his identicard to get Metazine
from the local dispensary. It is then Franklin learns of Cailyn's true
illness and vows to see she gets whatever medical attention she needs.

Zack is in the throes of conducting interviews with telepaths to recruit for
the fight against the Shadows, but he's receiving less than positive results.
Remembering that Dr. Franklin runs an underground railroad for telepaths
escaping Psi Corps, Sheridan instructs Ivanova to track him down and get the
details. Ivanova eventually locates Franklin, who is on walkabout, at a bar
in DownBelow. He gives her the code to his computer where the information is
located, but only after she promises not to allow anybody, herself included,
to come looking for him until he has finished his journey.

With the loss of Ranger One, Rathenn asks Delenn to be the replacement in
leading the Rangers. Delenn accepts, and decides to hold her initiation
ceremony on Babylon 5 in public so the Rangers could finally get some of the
recognition they deserve. Hearing the news, Neroon, a warrior caste Minbari
and former member of the Grey Council, challenges her right to lead the
Rangers. Neroon threatens Delenn - turn over control of the Rangers to the
warrior caste or he will kill her. Lennier witnesses the threat but is
instructed by Delenn not to tell Sheridan. . Fearing for Delenn's life,
Lennier approaches Marcus, believing a non-Minbari should stop Neroon - to
avoid a possible civil war among the Minbari. Marcus agrees to help and
finding Neroon, challenges him to a fight, invoking denn-shah - a fight to
the death. The battle is brutal, and Neroon proves to be too strong and
powerful with his fighting pike. With Marcus bloody and exposed for the kill,
the sight of a human willing to give up his life for a Minbari, while Neroon
was willing to kill one of his own, is enough to make him reconsider his
stance.

Meanwhile, a maintenance worker gets mysteriously sucked into a hole in the
floor in the Grey 16 sector and disappears. Taking the transport tube to the
area, Garibaldi begins to poke around and discovers and entire level hidden
between Grey 16 and 17. Investigating this mysterious area, he crosses paths
with a cult, led by Jeremiah (ROBERT ENGLUND), who has reprogrammed the
transport tube, welded the pressure doors shut and adjusted the power grids
so that nobody would be aware of their presence.

Garibaldi learns that Jeremiah and the others isolated themselves to obtain
purity of thought so they can achieve their goal: a perfect and spiritual
death. Not wanting to let their secret location be made public, the cult hold
Garibaldi hostage. Pretending to be sick, Garibaldi eventually overpowers his
captors and threatens Jeremiah to get him to take him to the only door
leading out of the area. With Jeremiah's help, Garibaldi is led to the exit,
only to discover it blocked by a Zarg, a perfect predator and one of the most
dangerous of aliens. The Zarg had killed the maintenance worker and is
revered by the cult for its sheer power of destruction. Using bullets and a
little creativity, Garibaldi subdues the creature and escapes.

With the rivalry between Lord Refa and Londo threatening to destabilize the
Royal Court, Centauri noble, Virini arrives at Babylon 5 to decide who should
be elevated in the hierarchy. Lord Refa also accompanies him to the station.

To aid his position, Londo devises a plan. He instructs Vir to tell G'Kar
that Na'Toth, his former aide, believed to be dead, has actually been taken
prisoner and is being held in a cell on Narn. Knowing he will come to her
rescue, Londo sets a trap and arranges to have guards present to arrest
G'Kar, who is a fugitive on Narn. Upon hearing the news, G'Kar unknowingly
asks Garibaldi to smuggle him to his homeland.

Meanwhile, Refa kidnaps Vir and has a Centauri telepath get into his mind to
expose Londo's scheme. Learning of the plan, Refa travels to Narn and asks
for Drigo's help in capturing G'Kar. Later, Londo rescues Vir.

Arriving on Narn, G'Kar asks for the assistance of G'Dan to help find
Na'Toth. Using an underground tunnel, they begin their search only to find
their path blocked by an awaiting Refa and a group of imperial guards. G'Lar
then pulls out a black box containing a full-size holographic image of Londo,
with a message explaining how Refa was the one who orchestrated the bombing
of the Narn homeworld, against his advice, and was the force responsible for
the creation of death camps which killed millions of Narns.

Londo meets with Virini carrying a datacrystal containing information making
Refa out to be a traitor. The results were enough to discredit Refa and
remove all controversy in the Royal Court in Londo's favor.

signals Sheridan to release their fleet, knowing that the White Star is
temporarily stranded and that the communication will reveal their exact
location.

Aboard the vessel "Dogato," Sheridan and Delenn go to the tactical center to
track the battle. Suddenly, a huge jump point forms, from which a fleet of
enemy ships emerge. One ship advances to attack the helpless White Star, but
before it has a chance to reach its target it gets sidetracked by the arrival
of Sheridans fleet.

A major fight ensues and the battle is furious. In the end, Sheridan
experiences a victory of sorts, turning back the attack, but at a great
price. For every Shadow destroyed, two of his ships were lost.

Meanwhile, still on walkabout and vowing to keep walking until e meets
himself, Franklin attempts to stop two thugs from robbing a man in a remote
part of DownBelow. Fighting off the assailants, Franklin is stabbed twice.
With no one in the area, Franklin crawls for help. Hes paralyzed with fear -
faces with the prospect of dying.

Suddenly, an image of himself appears, and Franklin has a conversation which
leads him to realize how he has always run away from his problems. With shock
and trauma beginning to set in, Franklin pleads for another chance to do it
over again. He gathers enough strength to pick himself off the floor and
search for help. Dragging himself through the corridors, Franklin eventually
spots a security guard and collapses in his arms. Placed in medlab, Franklins
condition stabilizes, and Sheridan offers him his old job back, which he
graciously accepts.

  Z'ha'dum

Transmission order: No. 322

Production order: No. 322

Captain John Sheridan receives a shock when Anna, his wife who disappeared
five years ago on Z'ha'dum, the homeworld of the Shadows, comes to Babylon 5.
She had departed on the Icarus for a planned six-month scientific and
archaeological mission, but it never returned and the 139 people aboard were
believed to have died.

Dr. Franklin examines her, and she physically checks out, but Sheridan
remains skeptical. Ensuring his safety, and claiming that Delenn, Kosh and
the others had been misleading him, Anna pleads with John to go back with her
to Z'ha'dum. Despite his fears that it might be a trap, Sheridan eventually
agrees, but on the condition that she tell him exactly what happened to her
and the Icarus when they landed on Z'ha'dum. Anna concedes and recounts the
story.

Meanwhile, G'Kar arranges with the ambassador from Gaim for the delivery of
several thermonuclear bombs. The plan is to learn where the Shadows next plan
to strike so that they can mine the area with the devices.

Londo receives news that he has been offered a position in the royal court as
advisor to Emperor Cartagia on matters of planetary security. He feels that
they are reeling him in because now he is forced to divide his time between
Babylon 5 and the Homeworld. Following the news, he receives a visit from a
messenger instructing him to leave the station immediately.

Before boarding the White Star with Anna and departing for Z'ha'dum, Sheridan
records a message to Delenn explaining his reasons for leaving. Upon their
arrival, Anna takes him to a room where Morden is present, and introduces him
to Justin who explains in detail who and what the Shadows are. Not wanting to
kill him for fear of turning him into a martyr, Justin asks Sheridan to join
their side, knowing the other races which he has organized to help fight the
Shadows would be lost without his leadership. Not giving in, Sheridan
confronts Justin about Anna, knowing that she was used to lure him to
Z'ha'dum.

Back on Babylon 5, Shadow vessels have surrounded the station, poised for
attack. Ivanova, who cannot figure out what they are waiting for, launches
fighter squadrons instructing them not to approach until authorized. As if
things couldn't get any worse, G'Kar informs Ivanova that two thermonuclear
devices are missing.

Using a concealed PPG, Sheridan attempts to escape. On a parapet several
miles above the city, he is left with nowhere to go. Using his link, he
ignites the engines of the White Star, armed with the two missing
thermonuclear devices set to detonate in 30 seconds. Sheridan jumps off the
ledge as the devices come hurling toward the city.

Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the Shadow vessels surrounding the station
leave. G'Kar concludes that Sheridan is dead, and their departure was due to
the fact that Babylon 5 no longer poses a threat. In addition, news comes
that one of the fighters sent out by Ivanova is missing.

  Midnight on the Firing Line

Transmission order: No. 101

Production order: No. 103

In a distant galaxy, the planet Raghesh 3 is home to a peaceful agricultural
colony for the alien Centauri race. An enemy race, The Narn, attacks the
planet with a fleet of powerful warships and news of this slaughter causes
angry debate among the four alien ambassadors stationed aboard Babylon 5, a
huge, politically neutral space station operated by the Earth Alliance.

Londo Mollari, the Centauri ambassador, accuses G'Kar, the Narn
representative, and his leaders of attempting to slaughter innocent farmers.
G'Kar reminds Londo that the Centauri originally invaded the Narn stronghold
on Raghesh 3 over a hundred years ago, and the Narns are simply regaining
what they believe is rightfully theirs.

Meanwhile, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair, leader of the Babylon 5 crew,
investigates a series of attacks on cargo ships by space pirates. Assisted by
Michael Garibaldi, his chief security officer, and Lieutenant Commander Susan
Ivanova, Sinclair also maintains peace aboard Babylon 5 until the security
council, including Minbari Ambassador Delenn and the mysterious Vorlon
Ambassador, Kosh Naranek can debate the Centauri problem.

Londo is concerned for the safety of his nephew, Carn Mollari (PETER
TRENCHER), a scientist stationed on Raghesh 3. Carn sends a message to the
Babylon 5 council, stating that his people requested Narn assistance to
liberate their colony from Centauri's oppressive rule. Defending his nephew's
loyalty, Londo insists that Carn was forced to make that statement by the
Narns to discourage any intervention. But despite Londo's objection, the
council votes not to investigate the incident.

Commanding Babylon 5's fighter squadron, Sinclair chases space pirates away
from the neutral sector. However, he captures a Narn advisor from the
pirates' command ship and presents him to G'Kar. Sinclair accuses the Narns
of selling weapons to the pirates and profiting from the pirates' random
violent attacks.

Sinclair also captures evidence of a monitored transmission between the
Raghesh 3 invasion fleet and the Narn military command that proves Carn was
forced to make his statement and confirms the attack on the space colony was
indeed a hostile takeover. Sinclair tells G'Kar to advise his leaders to
withdraw the Narn forces from Raghesh 3 or he will present the evidence to
the council, which will prompt the other races to collectively retaliate
against the Narns. G'Kar reluctantly complies, and peace is temporarily
restored.

  Soul Hunter

Transmission order: No. 102

Production order: No. 102

When an unidentified spacecraft hurtles toward Babylon 5 on a collision
course, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair, Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova and
their crew safely captures the craft.

The station's medical officer, Dr. Stephen Franklin, and Security Chief
Michael Garibaldi inspect the injured alien pilot and its ship. Ambassador
Delenn, representing the Minbari Empire, is horrified to see that it's the
Soul Hunter (W. MORGAN SHEPPARD), a feared enemy who captures and collects
the souls of dying aliens.

Delenn begs Sinclair to kill the evil stranger, but Sinclair doesn't agree
with her religious fears--until he witnesses the Hunter's chilling behavior
at the exact moment when a man dies elsewhere inside Babylon 5. The Hunter
can literally see the man's soul leave it's body--and he reacts with ecstasy.
To calm the intense fears of the aliens aboard the space station, Sinclair
orders the Soul Hunter to leave Babylon 5.

Before he departs, Delenn confronts the Soul Hunter, demanding the location
of his "collection" - the assortment of trapped souls he always carries. The
Soul Hunter recognizes Delenn as being from the Minbari's highest ruling
class. Why, he asks, is she posing as a mere diplomatic ambassador aboard
Babylon 5? He escapes from Garibaldi's security guards, retrieves his
collection pouch from his ship and hides in a deserted construction zone of
the station.

Soul Hunter #2 (JOHN SNYDER) arrives in pursuit, revealing to Sinclair that
his colleague is a fanatical renegade who murders aliens instead of waiting
for them to die. As the Soul Hunter kidnaps Delenn and slowly drains her
blood to preserve her soul without trauma, Sinclair and Garibaldi find his
hiding place. Sinclair turns the Soul Hunter's soul-stealing machine against
the Soul Hunter and encases him in one of the "soul stones."

Dr. Franklin nurses Delenn back to health, but after learning her true
identity from the Soul Hunter, Sinclair is also suspicious of her reasons for
posing as a Minbari ambassador.

Londo Mollari, the Centauri ambassador stationed on Babylon 5, is infatuated
with Adira Tyree (FABIANA UDENIO), an exotic Centauri dancer who performs on
the recreation level of the gigantic space station. Their affair often
distracts him from his political duties. Station Commander Jeffrey Sinclair
is annoyed when Londo arrives late to a treaty negotiation with the Narn
ambassador, G'Kar and his imposing new assistant, Ko 'Dath (MARY WORONOV).

Adira is later confronted by Trakis (CLIVE REVILL), the alien slave trader
who owns her contract. Trakis orders Adira to seduce Londo and get a copy of
his "purple files," a private collection of scandalous secrets about Centauri
royal families. Trakis hopes to sell the files to G'Kar who will generously
pay for any information he can use to unbalance the treaty negotiations in
his favor.

Adira hesitates to obey Trakis because she genuinely cares for Londo and
doesn't want to ruin his political career. However, to grain her freedom from
Trakis, she weakens Londo with a drug, fits him with s small mind-controlling
device and forces him to reveal his personal computer access code for the
incriminating files. She transfers the data to a tiny memory crystal and
sadly bids Londo farewell as he sleeps from the drug's aftereffects.

Suddenly deciding not to betray Londo, Adira keeps the crystal and hides
within the labyrinth of Babylon 5. Trakis and his hired killers eventually
find her and take the crystal while the killers guard her in a secluded
corner of the space station, waiting to depart with her on the next shuttle
flight.

When Londo realizes that Adira disappeared and his purple files are missing,
he begs Sinclair to help him save his career. Pretending to favor the Narns,
Sinclair arranges a meeting between Trakis and G'Kar for the sale of the
crystal. In attendance is Talia Winters (ANDREA THOMPSON), Babylon 5's
resident telepath, who mentions Adira's disappearance, then uses her psychic
powers to read Trakis' mind and learn her location as he thinks about her.
Security guards rescue Adira from the killers as Londo forcefully retrieves
the crystal from Trakis.

Sinclair agrees not to arrest Trakis if he will release Adira from her
contract, and he complies. Adira apologizes to Londo for deceiving him as she
boards her departing shuttle. He forgives her and invites her to return to
him after she's experienced some of the opportunities awaiting her in life as
a free woman.

Dr. Vance Hendricks (DAVID McCALLUM), a respected archaeologist, discovers
several strange artifacts on a barren planet that provide the secret to
organic technology - they are blueprints for living machines. Helped by his
assistant. Nelson Drake, Hendricks smuggles the mysterious relics aboard the
gigantic space station, Babylon 5. Hendricks hopes to discover the secrets of
the objects with the unsuspecting aid of his former student, Dr. Stephen
Franklin, the station's medical officer.

Meanwhile, the station's commander, Jeffrey Sinclair and Security Chief
Michael Garibaldi investigate the death of a security clerk. They don't know
that Drake murdered the clerk to get the relics aboard Babylon 5 without the
required quarantine inspection. As the scientists experiment on the objects,
Drake begins to transform into a cybernetic killer - part human, part machine
and attacks Dr. Franklin.

As Franklin recovers, Hendricks confesses the truth to Sinclair and
Garibaldi. He illegally smuggled the object into the laboratory hoping to
sell the secret to a wealthy Earth-based weapons corporation. He also
explains that Drake was accidentally infected with the cells of the
mechanized organisms. As Drake transforms completely into a humanoid machine,
he prowls throughout the station, absorbing its energy and killing anyone he
believes to be a threat.

Franklin isolates the genetic code that motivates the cybernetic Drake to
kill. Over a thousand years ago, the civilization on the barren planet
created artificial soldiers to cleanse their race of genetic impurities.
Unfortunately, this desire to create a perfect world was interpreted too
literally by these cybernauts and they destroyed all life on the planet.

Sinclair finally confronts the unstoppable Drake with these facts, and
Drake's artificial memory destroys itself out of shame for failing in its
mission. Drake recovers from his transformations but is arrested for the
murder of the security clerk. Franklin rejects Hendricks's plan to help him
sell the rest of the objects that allows Garibaldi's men to arrest the greedy
scientist.

To help promote intergalactic peace, the Earth Alliance hosts a religious
festival aboard Babylon 5, the gigantic politically neutral space station.
Representatives from every alien race arrive to demonstrate the customs of
their diverse religions.

G'Kar, the militant Narn ambassador, meets Tu'Pari (THOMAS KOPACHE), a
courier from their homeworld, who gives him a data crystal from Du'Rog (MARK
HENDRICKSON), G'Kar's political enemy. On this video message, Du'Rog claims
that his own political career was ruined by G'Kar's ambitious treachery.
Dying of an incurable disease, Du'Rog also wants G'Kar to die. He's hired an
unknown assassin to murder G'Kar during the festival.

G'Kar suspects every stranger arriving at the space station, including his
new diplomatic aide, Na'Toth (CAITLIN BROWN). She claims to be innocent and
reminds G'Kar that members of the Narn assassination guild leave a black rose
near their intended victims. When G'Kar awakens with a black rose on his
pillow, he hires a hulking alien bodyguard to protect him. The unknown
assassin kills the guard, and Babylon 5's security Chief, Michael Garibaldi
investigates.

Meanwhile, Station Commander Jeffrey Sinclair reunites with his frequent
lover, Catherine Sakai (JULIA NICKSON), a geological surveyor who arrives on
Babylon 5 to meet with some alien mining executives. Sinclair and Catherine's
conflicting careers and expectations frequently make them quarrel. After
reluctantly agreeing to try once again to have a committed relationship,
Catherine promises to return to Babylon 5 in a few weeks so they can be
together.

During one religious demonstration, Minbari Ambassador Delenn and her new
associate, Lennier conduct a ceremony where a spiritual rebirth supposedly
occurs after eating a special fruit. The ritual also aids Delenn with her
secret mission - to make sure Sinclair still does not remember the 24
mysterious hours of his war experience against the Minbari years ago. If
Sinclair remembers, Delenn has orders to kill him.

Later, while meeting with Babylon 5's Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova,
Sinclair expresses sudden suspicion about the intentions and trustworthiness
of the enigmatic Vorlon ambassador, Kosh Naranek.

As the festival concludes, Tu'Pari, the actual assassin, abducts G'Kar into
the cluttered interior level of Babylon 5 known as "Downbelow," and tortures
him in preparation to completing his assassin's contract. Luckily, Na'Toth
follows them and helps G'Kar defeat Tu'Pari in a brutal fist fight. Failing
to fulfill the terms of his contract, Tu'Pari flees from the space station on
the next shuttle flight before the Narn assassin's guild arrives to punish
him.

Jason Ironheart (WILLIAM ALLEN YOUNG), a fugitive from the Earth Alliance's
military Psi Corps, arrives on Babylon 5, the gigantic intergalactic space
station. He is a gifted telepath who was the subject of a psychological
experiment to expand the limits of psychic powers with special drugs and
therapy. Two Psi Cops, Mr. Bester (WALTER KOENIG) and Ms. Kelsey (FELICITY
WATERMAN), searching for Ironheart, arrive soon after and demand that Station
Commander Jeffrey Sinclair and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi help them
find him. They believe Ironheart intends to reveal military secrets to
Earth's alien enemies.

Eluding their search, Ironheart hides among the crowded Babylon 5 populace
and confronts his trusted former lover and Psi Corps pupil, Talia Winters,
the station's resident commercial telepath. He tells her that after months
painful genetic surgery and injections, he mutated to the point where he can
destroy molecular matter with his thought waves. Since the psi cops can't
control him, they want to dissect him, learn the chemical composition of his
superpowers and use it as a military weapon. Ironheart asks Talia to help him
escape in a shuttle craft before he loses control of his volatile impulses
and involuntarily destroys the entire space station.

Meanwhile, Sinclair's lover, Catherine Sakai (JULIA NICKSON), a geological
surveyor, is hired by an industrial company from Earth to find a rare mineral
on the planet Sigma 957, an uninhabitable world in a far corner of the galaxy
controlled by the Narn empire. When Catherine asks Ambassador G'Kar , the
Narn representative stationed on Babylon 5, for permission to survey the
planet, he warns her not to go into that ominous sector of space. She defies
him and departs in an exploratory vehicle while G'Kar orders two Narn
warships to pursue her.

Approaching Sigma 957, Catherine's vehicle is suddenly dwarfed by an enormous
alien spacecraft. When it disappears in a blinding light, Catherine's
incapacitated vehicle falls into a collision orbit with the planet. Luckily,
the Narn warship arrive to rescue her. G'Kar explains to Catherine that for
millions of years, his people have avoided Sigma 957 because of the
unexplainable events that frequently occur there, analogous to an ant trying
to explain the intrusion of a human fingertip into its nest.

Back on Babylon 5, Ironheart's uncontrollable psychic waves begin to such the
living space around him into a self-destructive fourth dimension, destroying
a corridor of the space station. He uses his remaining strength to allow
Talia and Sinclair near him to convince them of the danger of his constantly
mutating mind power to negotiate his escape from Babylon 5.

Ironheart easily deflects the psi cops' attempt to capture him as he's led to
a shuttle craft and ejected into space by himself. As the crew watches,
Ironheart's craft transforms into a benevolent humanoid apparition, bigger
than Babylon 5 itself. In a final gesture of grateful love, Ironheart gives
Talia the telekinetic mind power that she's always dreamed of possessing,
then dissolves into the molecular fabric of the universe to experience the
next stage of his psychic mutation.

A group of racial fanatics known as the Home Guard is attacking prominent

Commander Jeffrey Sinclair and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi assure them
that the crimes are being investigated.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova meets arriving passenger
Malcolm Biggs (TRISTAN ROGERS), a special lover whom she hasn't seen in eight
years. Malcolm claims he wants to renew their romance. He rents office space
aboard Babylon 5 to begin a new business and be near Ivanova. While she
appreciates his attentions, Ivanova warns him that she's dedicated to her
duties as an officer.

Two other passengers, Kiron Maray (RODNEY EASTMAN) and Aria Tensus (DANICA
McKELLAR), a young Centauri couple, are forcibly escorted by security guards
to the office of their alien ambassador, Londo Mollari. Refusing to obey the
ancient tradition of their race and submit to the prearranged marriages to
wealthy nobles selected by their parents, the young lovers stole Centauri
credit cards and fled from their planet, hoping to marry each other and start
a new life on Babylon 5.

Londo explains that love has no purpose in marriage, but Vir Cotto, his inept
assistant and Kiron's cousin, boldly condemns the old tradition, citing
Londo's own unhappiness with his three ugly prearranged wives. Reluctantly
agreeing with Vir, Londo arranges for Kiron and Aria to live with an
influential foster family who will thoroughly teach them Centauri traditions,
then marry them "for love" if they still wish it.

As the racial attacks continue, Sinclair and Garibaldi learn that Malcolm is
the secret Home Guard organizer. They persuade a shocked Ivanova to help them
entrap Malcolm and his unknown compatriots. Pretending to secretly hate all
aliens, Sinclair and Ivanova convince Malcolm of their bigotry. As Malcolm
tests their loyalty by ordering Sinclair to kill a captive alien, Garibaldi
traces their rendezvous with his security monitors and the Home Guard
terrorists are arrested.

Ivanova, seeing Malcolm led away in shackles, says good-bye for the last

For ten years since the Great War between Earth and the alien Minbari race,
Jeffrey Sinclair, presently the commander of the Babylon 5 space station, is
tortured by nightmares about the Battle of the Line. In this final heroic
assault in the Great War, young Sinclair inadvertently led his fighter
squadron into a Minbari trap. All Earth ships were destroyed except his own.
Twenty-four hours later, the superior Minbari forces unexplainably
surrendered to Earth. Unfortunately, Sinclair has no memories of what
happened to him during those 24 hours.

Two mysterious beings, known only as Knight One (JUDSON SCOTT) and Knight Two
(CHRISTOPHER NEAME), smuggle strange, experimental equipment aboard Babylon
5. They kidnap Sinclair and seclude him in a room deep inside the station.
Using advanced drugs and technology, the Knights connect Sinclair to
cybernetic inputs that allow their images to interact with the images hidden
within Sinclair's memory. The Knights hope to replay and analyze Sinclair's
final moments during the battle until they learn what happened to him during
that mysterious 24-hour period.

Sinclair's absence is soon discovered by lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova
and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi. They order an immediate search of every
room on Babylon 5. Delenn, the resident Minbari ambassador, is especially
concerned by Sinclair's disappearance.

Meanwhile, the Knights probe Sinclair's subconscious immediately after he
purposely crashed his space fighter into a Minbari warship at the climax of
the battle. They see Sinclair brought inside the warship with a tractor beam,
surrounded by the hooded figures of the Minbari Grey Council, including
Delenn. She shoots him with a strange energy discharge, but Sinclair's memory
of this pain is so strong that it shocks his mind and body free of the
Knights' cybernetic restraints.

Sinclair escapes from the Knights. Security monitors quickly locate him
stumbling along a corridor. Under Dr. Stephen Franklin's care, Sinclair soon
recovers from his ordeal. Garibaldi arrests the Knights, revealing that they
were part of an Earth-based supremacy group who suspected Sinclair of
conspiring with the Minbari. Suspicious of Delenn's friendship now that he
remembers what she and the Grey Council did to him, Sinclair tells her that
his memory is still unclear about what happened after the battle. However,
the Grey Council secretly advises Delenn that if Sinclair ever learns the
truth, he must die.

When Jha'dur (SARAH DOUGLAS), a sinister alien, arrives in disguise on
Babylon 5, she is attacked by Na'Toth (CAITLIN BROWN), attach  to the Narn
ambassador G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS). As Dr. Stephen Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS)
dresses Jha'dur's wounds, Na'Toth is questioned by Commander Jeffrey Sinclair
(MICHAEL O'HARE) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE).

Na'Toth explains that years ago during the interplanetary wars, her
grandfather's family was butchered by Jha'dur, an infamous scientist and was
criminal then known as DeathWalker, who was famous for her cruel biological
experiments. Na'Toth swore to avenge her ancestor's murders.

Meanwhile, Talia Winters (ANDREA THOMPSON), Babylon 5's resident telepath, is
hired by the enigmatic Vorlon ambassador, Kosh Naranek, supposedly to
secretly monitor his meetings with a humanoid named Abbut (COSIE COSTA).
During the sessions between Kosh and Abbut, Talia senses no emotions or
thoughts coming from Abbut. However, she experiences brief memories of a
terrifying serial killer whose mind she scanned years earlier.

Talia later learns that Abbut is Vicker, a cybernetic video recorder, who
tricked her with his conversations into feeling memories of her most
vulnerable emotions, then imprinted her feats on a data crystal for Kosh.
Garibaldi and Sinclair suggests that Kosh hired Abbut to discover Talia's
greatest fears and plans to use them against her in some future
confrontation.

Meanwhile, Sinclair's Earth Alliance superiors order him to Jha'dur to Earth
immediately. Scientists are eager to perfect her promising experiments for a
youth serum. However, Ambassador Kalika (ROBIN CURTIS), representing the many
minority alien races aboard Babylon 5, demands that Jha'dur be tried for her
war crimes against their planets by the station's League of Non-Aligned
Worlds. To avoid a riot, Sinclair agrees to conduct a hearing.

Evidence confirms that Jha'dur is DeathWalker. Her serum was developed by
performing sadistic experiments on the alien minorities for many years.
however, for their own political self-interests, a bare majority of the
ambassadors, with an abstention from Kosh, vote to send Jha'dur to Earth.
Outrages, Kalika and the alien minorities that she represents reject the
League's decision. A short time later, fleets of their warships surround
Babylon 5.

Sinclair negotiates a compromise with Kalika. A coalition of alien scientists
will accompany Jha'dur to Earth and help perfect the serum for the benefit of
all races. Afterward, Jha'dur will be officially tried for her crimes.
However, Jha'dur tells Sinclair that the active ingredient in her serum is
taken from the living tissue of another being. Each donor must die so the
recipient can live forever. The scientists who control the serum will become
greater butchers than Jha'dur ever was.

As Jha'dur's transport shuttle departs, a massive Vorlon warship appears and
destroys it. Having resolved the moral dilemma for everyone, Ambassador Kosh
tells the assembled leaders that they are not ready for immortality.

Dr. Stephen Franklin, chief medical officer on the space station Babylon 5,
examines Shon (JONATHAN CHARLES KAPLAN), the young child of a visiting alien
family. He tell the parents, M'ola (TRICIA O'NEIL) and Tharg (STEPHEN LEE),
that a simple operation is needed to remove a blockage from Shon's throat.
However, the family's ancient religion dictates that any puncture of the body
allows the spirit to escape, leaving a carcass that can't be redeemed by
their God. Dr. Franklin insists that Shon will die without the procedure, but
they refuse to give the doctor permission to operate.

Furious that the child will die because of an alien superstition, Dr.
Franklin files an official complaint with station commander Jeffrey Sinclair.
By the laws of the Earth Alliance that controls Babylon 5, he asks Sinclair
to overrule the aliens' parental authority and approve the operation.

Fearing that Sinclair will decide in favor of Dr. Franklin, M'ola and Tharg
asks the four alien ambassadors to plead their case before Babylon 5's
security council and prevent Dr. Franklin from disobeying their religious
belief. G'Kar, Londo Mollari, Ambassador Delenn and Kosh Naranek all refuse

After learning how devoutly the alien family believes in the body's purity,
Sinclair realizes that defying their faith would contradict Babylon 5's
humanitarian mission to be a peaceful galactic oasis that respects the unique
rights of every alien race. He forbids Dr. Franklin to operate on Shon.

After M'ola and Tharg say a final good-bye to their dying child, Dr. Franklin
and his assistant, Dr. Maya Hernandez (SILVANA GALLARDO), risk their careers
by performing the operation. Obeying their medical ethics, they're convinced
that once the aliens see their child alive and healthy, they'll realize the
error of their superstitious judgment.

Even though Shon recovers completely, when M'ola and Tharg see his neck
incision, they curse him as an undead thing without a soul. Shon allows them
to destroy his body in a sacrificial ritual. M'ola and Tharg concede that Dr.
Franklin was obeying his own morality but can't forgive his desecration of
their child. Dr. Franklin realizes that the multi-cultural galaxy is filled
with many different definitions of morality. He'll forever be haunted by the
ordeal of Shon's struggle between life and death.

As the Earthforce president and his staff travel to Babylon 5, the huge
intergalactic space station, to dedicate the opening of a new docking bay, an
explosion destroys part of the construction site. A worker, Nolan (JOSE
ROSARIO), is critically injured. Major Lianna Kemmer (ELAINE THOMAS), the
president's security adviser, and her assistant, Agent Cutter (TOM
DONALDSON), arrive to inspect Babylon 5's safety precautions.

Lianna is hostile to Babylon 5's security chief, Michael Garibaldi (JERRY
DOYLE). Suspecting a personal grievance that might hamper the investigation,
Station Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE), confronts Garibaldi
about Lianna. Garibaldi confesses that 13 years ago, while working as a guard
for a mining company, her was close friends with Frank Kemmer, a pilot, and
his 15-year-old daughter, Lianna. They helped him stay sober when the
pressure of defying corrupt supervisors tempted him to drink too much
alcohol. When the vengeful supervisors sabotaged a launch pad that
accidentally killed Frank, Garibaldi was blamed for being careless. The
mining company edited the accident report to avoid a scandal, but Lianna
never believed that her "Uncle Mike" was innocent of killing her father.
Garibaldi became a guilt-ridden alcoholic for several years.

Ignoring the protests of Dr. Stephen Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS), Babylon 5's
medical officer, Lianna interrogates Nolan. Before he dies, Nolan insists
that Garibaldi put a bomb in the construction site. Lianna temporarily
relieves Garibaldi of his duty when Cutter finds evidence of the bomb and a
detailed blueprint of the site in Garibaldi's living quarters. Lianna arrests
Garibaldi for sabotage, but after proclaiming his innocence to her once
again, Garibaldi flees into the crowded interior of Babylon 5. Convinced that
Garibaldi is loyal, Sinclair orders his own security man, Lou Welch (DAVID
CROWLEY), to search Nolan's living quarters.

While eluding Lianna and Cutter, Garibaldi frantically searches Babylon 5 to
learn who incriminated him as the saboteur. He hides in a tavern in
Downbelow, the station's equivalent of a criminal underworld, and escapes his
troubles by drinking., As the president's ship docks, Lianna and Cutter
capture Garibaldi and take him to his security office., Welch returns with
evidence that Nolan belonged to a subversive radical group called the Home
Guard. Nolan himself was the saboteur who inadvertently triggered the
explosion intended to kill the Earthforce president.

Lianna and Garibaldi hurry to the docking bay to inspect for more bombs.
There they meet Cutter, another home Guard terrorist in disguise, who is
preparing to detonate another explosion after the president's speech.
Garibaldi fights with Cutter and kills him before he can activate the bomb.

After the ceremony, Garibaldi thanks Sinclair for his devotion. Their
personal friendship is reaffirmed. Lianna apologizes to Garibaldi for blaming
him for her father's death. After reaffirming their friendship as well,
Lianna departs with the president's staff, promises to visit Babylon 5 again
to see her "Uncle Mike."

A tragic accident occurs in one of the overcrowded loading docks on Babylon
5, the huge intergalactic space station. A computer control error causes a
Narn transport ship to crash against the dock, damaging the structure and
killing a worker. The dead man's brother, dock chief Eduardo Delvientos (JOSE
REY), blames the death on obsolete equipment and the terrible working
conditions imposed by the Earth Alliance Senate. Neooma Connally (KATY
BOYER), the union worker's representative, confronts station commander
Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE). She demands better wages, equipment and
work schedules.

Among the cargo destroyed in the accident is a G'Quan Eth, a rare flower
being shipped to G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS), the Narn ambassador stationed
aboard Babylon 5. G'Kar is desperate to find another G'Quan Eth before the
hour when sunlight strikes a sacred mountain on his homeworld and all devout
Narns must perform a religious ritual with the flower. Unfortunately, the
only other G'Quan Eth on Babylon 5 belongs to G'Kar's spiteful rival,
Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari (PETER JURASIK), who stole it from Narn to
enjoy its powers as a drug.

Londo refuses to sell the flower, so G'Kar vengefully orders his attach,
Na'Toth (CAITLIN BROWN), to steal a sacred stature from the Centauri cultural
center. This spiteful battle continues until the moment for G'Kar's ritual
passes. Finally Commander Sinclair convinces Londo to sell the flower. He
also convinces G'Kar that because of the vast distance between Narn and
Babylon 5, the sunlight that struck the sacred mountain won't arrive at the
space station for several hours. Impressed by Sinclair's logic, G'Kar happily
prepares for his ritual with the G'Quan Eth.

Reluctantly obeying the wishes of the Senate, Sinclair refuses to address the
union's problems. Connally orders her workers to desert their shifts. Dozens
of cargo ships wait to be unloaded at the empty docks. The Senate immediately
send Orin Zento (JOHN SNYDER), a callous labor negotiator, to Babylon 5 to
resolve the conflict.

When talks between Zento and Connally fail to satisfy the workers, Zento
produces a special military order to force them back to work. The worked
riot, clashing with Babylon 5's security force, led by security chief Michael
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE). Many people are injured before Sinclair, opposing
Zento's tactics, takes commands, Under the authority of the military order,
Sinclair directs over a million credits from the station's military budget
for immediate wage increases and equipment repair. He also pardons the
rebellious union workers.

Outraged by Sinclair's political betrayal, Zento returns to the Senate. He
condemns Sinclair's actions and questions his loyalty to the Earth Alliance.
Though peace returns to Babylon 5, Sinclair realizes that he's possible
jeopardized his career by defying the powerful politicians on Earth.

When a small fleet of unknown space raiders rob and destroy cargo vessels
near Babylon 5, the gigantic interstellar space station, Commander Jeffrey
Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) order Lieutenant Command Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA
CHRISTIAN) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) to prepare to
defend the station.

Increasingly troubled by memories of his 24-hour amnesia during a crucial
battle in the Minbari war 11 years earlier, Sinclair confides in Garibaldi.
Sinclair thinks he was hypnotized and questioned by the Minbari Grey Council,
then returned to his ship after the stronger Minbari military force
surrendered to Earth. Garibaldi offers to help solve the mystery using his
law enforcement contacts. He doesn't know that Delenn (MIRA FURLAN), a Grey
Council member and the Minbari ambassador on Babylon 5 is ordered to kill
Sinclair if he ever learns the truth.

Londo Mollari (PETER JURASIK), the resident Centauri ambassador, hires an
alien archaeologist who retrieves The Eye, an ancient Centauri symbol of
power that was stolen over a century ago from the Emperor's palace. To
advance his own political career, Londo offers The Eye to Lord Kiro (GERRIT
GRAHAM), the Centauri Emperor's heir, as he arrives on Babylon 5, accompanied
by his aunt, Lady Ladira (FREDI OLSTER), a royal prophetess. As they speak,
Ladira experiences two frightening visions: Kiro's death enveloped by shadows
and an explosion that destroys Babylon 5.

Morden (ED WASSER), a sinister agent secretly working for the powerful
mercenaries known as The Shadowmen, arrives on Babylon 5 to privately
interview the various ambassadors, repeatedly asking them the puzzling
question, "What do you want?"

Meanwhile, preparing to attack Babylon 5, the space raiders lure the
station's starfuries, commanded by Ivanova and Garibaldi, into a distant
sector of space. Three raiders abduct Kira and The Eye into a Centauri
transport shuttle and escape.

Aboard the shuttle, Kiro is betrayed by the raiders whom he secretly hired to
abduct him. He intended to return to Centauri Prime and, unhindered by Londo
or Ladira, use The Eye to proclaim himself the new Emperor. As the raiders
plot to ransom Kira and The Eye, two Shadowmen cruisers destroy the shuttle.
The Babylon 5 fighter planes defeat most of the other raiders in battle.

As the Babylon 5 crew celebrates victory, Ladira senses that her first vision
came true. Morden return The Eye in its charred container to Londo. Garibaldi
tells Sinclair what he learned: Sinclair was chosen to command Babylon 5 by
the Minbari. Finally, Ladira reveals her second vision, involving the
destruction of Babylon 5, to Sinclair and prays that he can prevent it from
happening.

Walker Smith (GREG McKINNEY), a brawny prizefighter from Earth, arrives on
Babylon 5 and visits his longtime friends, the station's security chief,
Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE). As they eat dinner together, the two friends
reminisce about their past. Walker explains how he lost his chance at a
world-championship boxing match on Earth.

Walker had a reputation as an honest, drug-free athlete until he refused to
cooperate with the gamblers of a crime syndicate who wanted him to purposely
lose the championship fight. They altered his medical records to show the
news media that Walker used illegal drugs. Disgraced and unable to box
professionally, Walker reveals that he came to Babylon 5 to reclaim his honor
by becoming the first human to fight in the Mutai, a fierce sporting event
hosted by the alien minority races aboard the space station.

Meanwhile, Rabbi Yossel Koslov (THEODORE BIKEL), representing the ancient
Jewish religion that still flourishes on Earth, arrives on Babylon 5 to
console Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) due to the
recent death of her father, Andrei (ROBERT PHALEN). Koslov is a longtime
friend of the Ivanov family. Even though Andrei disowned Susan for joining
the Earthforce military service several years ago, he asked Koslov to give
her a treasured heirloom upon his death. Koslov also helps Susan release her
emotional grief and anger from lifetime of conflict with Andrei and joins her
in an overdue "shivah," a Jewish mourning ritual.

Walker is rejected by the Muta-Do (SOON-TECK OH), the Mutai trainer, who
insists that humans aren't allowed to compete against aliens. Caliban (DON
STROUD), an old and battered Mutai fighter, secretly tells Walker how to
circumvent the Muta-Do's authority. Walker and Garibaldi attend a Mutai event
featuring the Sho-Rin Gyor (JAMES JUDE COURTNEY), the greatest Mutai
champion, and watch him defeat his challengers in a sport that is similar to
but much more brutal than the boxing matches on Earth.

As part of the regular event, Gyor challenges amateurs from the crowd to
fight him. With the proper insults learned from Caliban, Walker provokes
Gyor. Forbidden to oppose the champion's decision when he accepts a
challenge, the Muta-Do reluctantly announces a date for the match between
Walker and Gyor. Caliban, eager to avenge his championship defeat against
Gyor years ago, helps Walker train for his event and assists Garibaldi as
Walker's ringside assistant during the actual match.

After several bloody and violent rounds of combat, the Muta-Do declares the
fighters evenly matched and stops the fight. As the predominantly alien crowd
cheers equally for Gyor and Walker, the champion offers his handshake to the
human out of respect for his strength and endurance. The Muta-Do proclaims
that humans may now legally compete in the Mutai. Walker thanks Garibaldi and
Caliban for helping him regain his honor as a professional athlete and
retires to an agricultural planet to become a farmer.

Aldous Gajic (DAVID WARNER), a spiritual crusader on a quest for the mystic
"Holy Grail," arrives on Babylon 5 to consult with the various alien
ambassadors. Explorers wishing to cure the evils of mankind have sought it
for hundreds of years. Gajic's quest has taken him from the forgotten
sanctuaries of Earth to every inhabited galaxy.

Meanwhile, Deuce (aka Desmond Muzyshenko) (WILLIAM SANDERSON), a crime boss
in "Downbelow," Babylon 5's criminal underworld, threatens Jinxo (aka Thomas
Jordan) (TOM BOOKER), a petty thief and former construction worker. Jinxo
must repay Deuce a huge gambling debt. To demonstrate his power, Deuce forces
Jinxo to watch the "execution" of a witness. The witness planned to testify
against Deuce in a trial before Babylon 5's judicial authority, the Ombuds
Wellington (JIM NORTON). A hideous, tentacled created known as a Na'ka'leen
Feeder drains the witness of her memory. The Feeder is disguised in the same
non-descript environmental exoskeleton worn by the enigmatic Vorlon
ambassador, Kosh Naranek.

Security Chief Michael Garibaldi apprehends Jinxo stealing Gajic's credit
card and brings him to Wellington. About to be expelled from Babylon 5, Jinxo
desperately explains that he was a worker on the four preview Babylon space
stations, and each time he left the stations, they collapsed or exploded.
Despite his current problems with Deuce, Jinxo fears that if he ever leaves
Babylon 5, it will be destroyed as well. Doubting the curse but impressed
with Jinxo's compassion for the station's occupants, Gajic offer to
rehabilitate Jinxo, and Wellington pardons him.

When Garibaldi's guard find the near-lifeless trial witness, they suspect
Deuce is responsible but cannot prove it. Dr. Stephen Franklin, Babylon 5's
medical officer, matches the witness's symptoms and the symptoms of several
previous victims with the known results of a Feeder attack. Station Commander
Jeffrey Sinclair and Garibaldi suspect that Deuce smuggled the creature
aboard to enforce his criminal rule. Since Feeder's are indigenous to a
Centauri sector of the galaxy, Sinclair consults Londo Mollari , the Centauri
ambassador, who expresses his race's mortal terror of the Feeder.

Gajic and Jinxo develop a close friendship as they interview the ambassadors
about the elusive Grail. When Deuce's henchmen abduct Gajic and Wellington to
satisfy the Feeder's hunger, Jinxo frantically leads Sinclair and Garibaldi
to Deuce's lair in Downbelow. Garibaldi's guards join the fight, and after an
exhausting chase, they subdue Deuce and his henchmen and kill the Feeder.
Unfortunately, Gajic is mortally wounded protecting Jinxo. As the crusader
dies, Jinxo promises to continue searching for the Holy Grail.

Colonel Ari Ben Zayn (GREGORY MARTIN), an undercover investigator nicknamed
"Eyes" from the Earthforce Bureau of Internal Affairs, arrives on Babylon 5,
the huge interstellar space station built by the Earth Alliance. He is
accompanied by Harriman Gray (JEFFREY COMBS), a military specialist from the
Psi Corps, Eathforce's division of genetically-enhanced telepaths. They tell
station commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) that they've been ordered
by Earthforce Security to evaluate the loyalty of the space station's command
staff.

Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) doesn't want to submit
to Gray's mindscan, a telepathic survey of her personal thoughts. She resents
the Psi Corps' authority and has painful personal memories of her mother, a
disobedient telepath who died after her powers were neutralized by the Psi
Corps. Ivanova threatens to resign from her command rather than allow Gray to
expose her most private emotions. However, Sinclair assures her that he'll
delay Zayn's unwarranted investigation.

Ben Zayn appoints Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), Babylon 5's security chief
and Sinclair's close friend, to be his assistant, ordering him to collect all
of the biographical data on the command staff from the computer files.
Garibaldi reluctantly obeys. However, he suspects that the investigators have
a personal vendetta against Sinclair./ Therefore, he secretly retrieves data
on Zayn and Gray.

Meanwhile, Sinclair challenged Ben Zayn's authority by invoking a
little-known legal article of the Earthforce Code that requires a special
military review prior to officers complying with the mindscan of a Psi Corps
telepath. Gray, who is sympathetic to Ivanova's desire for privacy, questions
Ben Zayn's motives. He agrees with Sinclair and refuses to scan the officers.
Enraged by Sinclair's bold defiance, Ben Zayn assumes command of Babylon 5
and threatens to court-martial Sinclair.

Garibaldi collects the results of his computer data search and tells Sinclair
that Ben Zayn was originally selected to be the commander of Babylon 5 during
its construction. But because of the unusual political demands by the
Minbari, an alien race vanquished by the Earth Alliance in an interstellar
war, Sinclair was unexpectedly given the prestigious command.

When Ben Zayn uses his self-appointed power to order Gray to mindscan the
command staff, Sinclair demands that Ben Zayn be scanned as well. Sinclair
provoke Ben Zayn, who becomes furious before the assembled officer, while
Gray confirms Ben Zayn's vengeful ambition with a mindscan. When Ben Zayn
threatens everyone with a PPG, Gray telepathically causes him to drop it and
Garibaldi arrests the insane "Eyes."

Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) and Security Chief Michael
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) are surprised when a Minbari war cruiser arrives at
Babylon 5, the peaceful intergalactic space station. Resident Minbari
ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) explains that officers of the Minbari warrior
caste, led by Shai Alit Neroon (JOHN VICKERY), are escorting the corpse of
their great war hero, Branmer, for memorial display at various Minbari
outposts throughout the galaxy.

Sinclair permits the cruiser to dock, even though he's reminded of his own
encounter with Branmer during The Battle of the Line, a fateful clash in the
war between Earth and Minbar several years earlier. After this battle, the
stronger Minbari forces inexplicable surrendered. After preparing a place of
honor for the overnight memorial, Sinclair and Garibaldi watch the Minbari
gather near Branmer's coffin. But when the lid is raised, everyone is
horrified to see that the corpse is missing. Garibaldi leads a frantic search
to find it.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) and Talia
Winters (ANDREA THOMPSON), Babylon 5's resident commercial telepath, rescue
Alisa Beldon (GRACE UNA), a 14-year-old human orphan, after she collapses in
the crowded Babylon 5 marketplace. With the help of Dr. Stephen Franklin
(RICHARD BIGGS), the resident medical officer, Talia learns that Alisa is a
powerful undocumented telepath.

Talia takes custody of Alisa, hoping to prepare her for the Psi Corps, the
military branch of the Earth Alliance that regulates all telepaths. Ivanova,
whose telepathic mother refuses to join the Corps and died young from
power-repressing drugs she was forced to take, angrily opposes Talia and
wants to protect Alisa from the Corps until the girl is old enough to choose
for herself. Frustrated because his race is not telepathic, Narn ambassador
G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS) offers to nurture Alisa and eventually breed her
with Narn males.

As Ambassador Delenn tells Alisa about honor Minbari telepaths, the girl
glimpses a disturbing vision in Delenn's subconscious. Later, she tells
Sinclair that Delenn stole Branmer's corpse. When confronted by Sinclair,
Delenn confesses that since she opposes the warrior caste, she secretly
cremated the body to end Neroon's military display. Branmer, a childhood
friend of Delenn's who diverged from her politically, always requested a
simple funeral. Delenn honored his wish.

As Neroon threatens to start another war due to Branmer's disappearance,
Delenn privately confronts him, and speaks on behalf of Minbar's elite ruling
body, the Grey Council. Just as the Council ordered Branmer and Neroon to
surrender during the former war, she now orders Neroon to support her
explanation that Branmer "took his place with the Gods."

Neroon reluctantly apologizes to Sinclair and leaves Babylon 5 with his
guards. Talia and Ivanova reach a compromise that someday may lead to
friendship. Alisa decides to travel to Minbari under Delenn's sponsorship to
help improve relations between the aliens and humans. However, she privately
reveals to Sinclair another puzzling vision she saw in Delenn's subconscious:

Babylon 5, the interstellar space station, is in a permanent orbit around
Epsilon 3, an uninhabited planet. Detecting seismic activity within the
planet, station commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) and Lieutenant
Commander Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) send geologist Dr. Tasaki (JIM
ISHIDA) and his crew to Epsilon 3 in a shuttle craft to learn if a volcanic
eruption will damage Babylon 5.

A massive beam of light suddenly emitted from the planet destroys most of the
shuttle's controls. After being rescued and re-equipped in another shuttle,
Dr. Tasaki and his crew approach the planet once again. This time, the
shuttle is targeted by three rockets launched from deep chasm but returns to
Babylon 5 with minimal damage. Tasaki suspects that the Epsilon 3 chasm may
contain an automated defense system built by a long-forgotten civilization
and reactivated by the seismic activity. Sinclair and Ivanova agree to
descend into the chasm in a shuttle to search for the truth.

Meanwhile, Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) is concerned when
he learn of a violent political revolt on the Mars colony where his former
girlfriend, Lise Hampton (DENISE GENTILE), is stationed. Unable to contact
her through normal communications channels, Garibaldi asks Talia Winters
(ANDREA THOMPSON), Babylon 5's resident commercial telepath, to contact the
colony on the secret frequency used by the Psi Corps, the military unit that
regulates all telepaths. Talia learns that Lise's name is not on any list of
survivors nor any list of the deceased and missing. Still in love with Lise,
Garibaldi is determined to discover what happened to her.

Minbari Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) is visited by one of her former
teachers, Draal (LOUIS TURENNE). They discuss the increasing political
conflict between the Minbari's religious and military social castes and agree
that the Minbari people are restless and eager for an enlightening change.

Before boarding the shuttle with Ivanova, Sinclair sees a vision of an
ancient, withered alien creature pleading for help.. With Babylon 5's
battleships firing their weapons to distract the planet's automatic defenses,
Sinclair's shuttle descends into the black chasm on Epsilon 3 and stops at a
docking port. Following a tunnel protected by automatic defense lasers,
Sinclair and Ivanova discover a huge cavern filled with active machinery,
dwarfing them in a massive scale beyond anything ever conceived by Mankind.

After reporting their discovery to Garibaldi on Babylon 5, an earthquake
traps Sinclair and Ivanova in another tunnel, blocking their return path to
the shuttle. Searching for another exit, they both see the floating vision of
the endangered alien, whom they learn is called Varn (CURT LOWENS). The

Babylon 5's Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) and Lieutenant
Commander Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) rescue a cybernetic 500-year-old
alien named Varn (CURT LOWENS) on the planet Epsilon 3 and return to Babylon
5 with him. Varn previously controlled the planet's highly advanced defense
system.

Babylon 5's medical officer, Dr. Stephen Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS), analyzes
Varn's comatose condition. Meanwhile, an Earthforce war cruiser, commanded by
Captain Ellis Pierce (RON CANADA), arrives to claim the super-technology
found on Epsilon 3 for the Earth Alliance. Sinclair contacts the Earth
Alliance about Pierce's unnecessary interference. When pierce launches his
patrol ships to the planet, they are immobilized by the planet's defenses.
Ivanova learns that Pierce's offensive triggered a chain reaction in the
reactor core of the planet and Epsilon 3 will explode in less than 48 hours.

Draal (LOUIS TUREMME), a retired Minbari teacher visiting his former pupil,
Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN), suddenly hears Varn calling to his
subconscious. Draal and Delenn go to the medical lab and Varn awakens,
telling them that he is too old to control Epsilon 3's defenses and needs
someone to replace him.

Suddenly, an alien warship appears, commanded by Takarn (MICHELAN SISTI),
leading a group of criminal outcasts who were banished from Epsilon 3
centuries ago. He demands to reclaim the planet, but Pierce, who believes the
dense system can be deactivated, fights Takarn for control of the
super-technology as they both travel toward Epsilon 3.

Londo Mollari (PETER JURASIK), the Centauri ambassador, privately confronts
Draal and Delenn and confesses that Varn called to him, as well. The three
aliens realize that Varn wants Draal to become the planet's new guardian.
They abduct Varn from the lab, and with Londo flying his private shuttle,
Draal and Delenn race towards Epsilon 3 to connect Draal to the defense
system's control panel before the planet explodes.

Luckily, Varn has enough strength to telepathically control the defense
system. Despite a battle between Pierce's and Takarn's forces, Varn and those
with him arrive on Epsilon 3 safely. Varn connects Draal to the cybernetic
control panel and the enlightened Minbari terminates the core's chain
reaction, preventing the explosion of the planet. Draal also projects his
image in Babylon 5, Pierce's cruiser and Takarn's warship.

Conveying the will of Varn's people, Draal says that no one must possess the
technological secrets of Epsilon 3 for now. He orders all warships back to
their bases, but when Takarn attempts to descend instead, Draal destroys the
alien ship. Then Varn prepares to die. Reprimanded for opposing Sinclair,
Pierce apologizes and returns his ship to Earth.

Finally, Sinclair locates Lise Hampton (DENISE GENTILE), Security Chief
Michael Garibaldi's (JERRY DOYLE) former girlfriend, who disappeared during a
revolt on Mars. Garibaldi confesses that he still loves her but Lise reveals
that she's marries someone else.

A spaceship is launched from Babylon 5 to investigate a powerful energy
source in the galaxy, known as Sector 14. The ship is enveloped in a white
light and the pilot dies after setting the ship's automatic return guidance
system. Station commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE), Lieutenant
Command Susan Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) and Security Chief Michael
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE) are surprise by the autopsy report. While the pilot's
corpse looks normal, his internal organs have ages a hundred years.

Sinclair leans that the energy in Sector 14 is coming from the exact location
where Babylon 4, the Earth Alliance's previous space station, mysteriously
disappeared four years ago. He suddenly receives an emergency video
transmission from Major Lewis Krantz (KENT BROADHURST), Babylon 4's missing
commander, pleading for help in evacuating his ship which is trapped in a
violent time warp. Puzzled by Babylon 4's reappearance, Sinclair orders every
rescue shuttle on Babylon 5 to fly to Sector 14.

Meanwhile, Minbari Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) pilots her own shuttle to
a Minbari war cruiser and reunites with the Grey Council, the elite ruling
body. Delenn learns that she's been elected by the Council to be the new
Minbari leader. Though honored, she insists that her spiritual mission aboard
Babylon 5, involving Commander Sinclair and an ancient Minbari prophecy, is
unfinished. She must fulfill the prophecy and see the human race achieve its
ultimate destiny which will benefit the Minbari, as well. They Grey Council
accepts her decision but regretfully removes her from their ruling body.
Delenn returns to Babylon 5 as Minbari Ambassador again.

Leading the rescue team, Sinclair and Garibaldi board Babylon 4 and confront
Major Krantz. He is terrified by the tremors and white lights that have
weakened his space station. He is also astounded to learn that the rescuers
are from Babylon 5 in the year 2258. Krantz explains that hours after Babylon
4 went operation, they were caught in a spatial warp that randomly projects
the station forward and backward in time. He has no way of knowing how long
it's been happening or what the present time is.

As the crew evacuates, another tremor occurs and Sinclair sees a vision of
his own future: Babylon 5 being destroyed by an alien invasion and Garibaldi
sacrificing himself by activating the station's self-destruct mechanism.
Krantz shows Sinclair and Garibaldi an imprisoned alien creature, Zathras
(TIM CHOATE), who suddenly appeared during one of the earlier tremor. Zathras
explains that arrived from another time in history, sent by "The One," the
galaxy's spiritual leader, to pull Babylon 4 through the time warp and
ultimately use its technology to end an intergalactic war.

As the tremors increase, "The One" suddenly appears, stabilizing Babylon 4's
disintegration long enough for the occupants of Babylon 4 to board the
shuttles. Zathras, obviously fulfilling a pre-arranged command, gives "The
One" a small black box and the dark-helmeted specter disappears with it. As
the Babylon 4 station vibrates violently, Zathras strains to save Sinclair
from falling debris and is critically wounded., Krantz, Sinclair and
Garibaldi escape on a shuttle, leaving Zathras who insists he must meet his
fate aboard Babylon 4.

"The One," accompanied by an unseen woman, appears once again to comfort
Zathras. Watching the shuttles depart, "The One" removes his helmet,
revealing the aged and battle-scarred face of Jeffrey Sinclair. Babylon 4

investigates Dr. Laura Rosen (JUNE LOCKHART), an ailing, middle-aged woman
who is illegally treating the poor passengers in Downbelow, the station's
criminal underworld, with an alien healing machine. Janice (KATE McNEIL),
Laura's loyal daughter, tells Dr. Franklin that years ago her mother was a
respected physician. But after exhausting herself in her practice, she
accidentally killed one of her patients. Her medical license was revoked.
Experimenting with the unknown powers of the machine is restoring Laura's
devotion to healing the sick.

Dr. Franklin thinks Laura is a charlatan until he reviews her patient's
recovery records. Examining the machine, Dr. Franklin realizes that transfers
biological energy from Laura to her patients, gradually draining her of her
own life-force. Laura confesses that she's suffering from Lake's Syndrome, a
painful neurological disease, and hopes to perfect the machine's efficiency
before she dies.

Ordered by superiors to learn more about the rival alien races, Londo Mollari
(PETER JURASIK), the fun-loving Centauri ambassador, reluctantly escorts
Lennier (BILL MUMY) , a repressed and virginal young Minbari attach , on a
night of wild adventure in one of Babylon 5's nightclubs. Londo is caught
cheating in a poker game, and the ensuing brawl destroys the club. When
station commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) disciplines Londo,
Lennier accepts responsibility for the brawl and pays for the damages. Londo
is surprised by the Minbari's generosity and feels indebted.

During the preliminary scan, Talia is traumatized by the secrets of Mueller's
subconscious. Before the brainwipe, Mueller escapes. Severely wounded in the
process, he flees into Downbelow. Mueller locates Laura's clinic, and while
holding Janice hostage, forces Laura to heal his wound with her machine.

Suspecting Mueller's intent, Dr. Franklin alerts some of the guards and
hurries to rescue the Rosens. Connected to Mueller with the machine, Laura
suddenly reverses its power, transferring her disease into Mueller's body as
he dies in agonizing pain.

Ombuds Wellington declares that Laura acted in self-defense and doesn't
charge her with Mueller's murder. However, though Mueller's life-force cured
her, Laura feels she violated her medical ethics by killing him. She departs
from Babylon 5, leaving Dr. Franklin and Janice to perfect the healing
machine.

Aboard Babylon 5, the huge intergalactic space station, Londo Mollari (PETER
JURASIK), the Centauri ambassador, argues with G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS), the
Narn ambassador, over a boundary dispute in the distant quadrant 37 that
separates a portion of their alien empires. Frustrated by G'Kar's
militaristic logic, Londo cautiously accepts the help of Morden (ED WASSER),
an agent of the powerful mercenaries known as The Shadowmen. In return for an
unspecified future favor from Londo, Morden promises to eliminate the Narn
threat in Quadrant 37 and allow Londo to take full credit for personally
resolving the dispute.

Meanwhile, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE) and geological
surveyor Catherine Sakai (JULIA NICKSON) agree on their wedding date and ask
their friend, Babylon 5's Security Chief, Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), to
participate in the ceremony. Soon after, Garibaldi learns of a plot to
assassinate Earth Alliance President Luis Santiago. His investigation
indicates that Edgar Devereaux (EDWARD CONERY), a corrupt businessman based
on Babylon 5, is a renegade Earthforce security agent who is helping an
unknown group with the plot.

Garibaldi is critically wounded by one of his own aides, loyal to Devereaux.
As Babylon 5's medical officer, Dr. Stephen Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS), and his
team struggle to save his life, Garibaldi tells Sinclair about the
assassination plot. As Sinclair and Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova
(CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) try to contact the President's transport ship, it
explodes in a huge fireball. As the Earth Alliance mourns, the weak and
ineffective Vice-President, Morgan Clark (GARY McGURK), is sworn in as the
new leader.

Meanwhile, four massive Shadowmen warships completely destroy the Narn
military base in Quadrant 37, killing ten thousand troops. Londo conveys his
shock over the senseless slaughter to Morden, but the sinister Shadowman
merely tells Londo to enjoy the heroic gratitude that the Centauri race is
bestowing upon him. Suspecting that a powerful, unknown alien race is
responsible, G'Kar returns to his homeworld to investigate the massacre.

After a solemn consultation with the enigmatic Vorlon ambassador, Kosh
Naranek, Minbari Ambassador Delenn (MIRA FURLAN) reluctantly isolates herself
in a corner of her living quarters and activates a small device that encases
her in a translucent chrysalis, slowly changing her appearance. When
questioned by Sinclair, Delenn's assistant, Lennier (BILL MUMY), confesses
that he doesn't know why Delenn is transforming herself.

  Points of Departure

Transmission order: No. 201

Production order: No. 201

Everyone on Babylon 5 is surprised to learn that their old commander, Jeffrey
Sinclair, was reassigned and that they have a new leader: Captain John
Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER). A controversial choice, Sheridan is most opposed
by the Minbari because he was responsible for destroying a Minbari outpost 12
years ago and was named a war hero as a result.

Also, Security Chief Michael Garibaldi remains in critical condition, shot in
the back by one of his aides when he attempted to investigate a plot to
assassinate the Earth Alliance President. Later, the president was killed.

Ambassador Delenn's associated, Lennier, reveals few clues to Commander Susan
Ivanova about Delenn's transformation, which is related to the Minbari's
belief that souls never die. Delenn's sacrifice is due to the fact that "the
great Enemy is returning and the prophecy that the two sides of our spirit
must unite against the darkness or be destroyed. Both races must join to stop
the darkness."

New squadron pilot Warren Keffer (ROBERT RUSLER) leads a defense against the
attack by a Tragati warship, which happens after Sheridan and Ivanova detain
the rogue warship's captain, Kalain (RICHARD GROVE). Kalain purposely comes
aboard Babylon 5 but does not provoke an attack due to an elaborate plan to
force Sheridan to start a war so that a Minbari attack on Babylon 5 will be
justified.

As Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari's status among his race increases, he
becomes more indebted to the sinister morden, an agent of the powerful
mercenaries known as the Shadows.

Narn Ambassador G'Kar suddenly reappears after conduction his own
investigation of the obliteration of Quadrant 37 that destroyed a Narn
military base, killin 10,000 troops. Unbeknownst to him and his people, Londo
is responsible for the attack.

G'Kar talks to his diplomatic aide, Na'Toth, about the destruction in
Quadrant 37. His theory is that a very old race, as described in the holy
book, still exists on the Rim (of known space) and is gaining power, creating
havok throughout space. G'Kar pleads with the council to join forces and
investigate.

Meanwhile, Dr. Stephen Franklin tries an alien experimental procedure to help
save Security Chief Michael Garibaldi, who remains in critical condition in a
coma. The procedure works and, after having his mind scanned by a Psi Corps
member, Talia, Garibaldi realizes that his own aide is responsible for his
near death.

The aide is arrested, but the new Earth Alliance President requests that the
man be sent to Earth in order to investifate and connection with the
assassination of the previous Earth Alliance President. But before he arrives
on Earth, the accused man disappears in space. Garibaldi speculates that the
new President, in league with the Psi Corps, is responsible for the
assassination of the former president.

Captain John Sheridan's younger sister, Elizabeth Sheridan (BEVERLY LEECH),
visits him and forces him to confront his sadness and guilt about his
deceased wife.

Finally, Minbari Ambassador Delenn emerges from the cocoon as a beautiful
woman with very few distinguishing Minbari features remaining. Her
responsibilities will be to act as a link between her people and the human
race.

An old war buddy of Captain Sheridan's (BRUCE BOXLEITNER), Maynard (RUSS
TAMBLYN), visits Babylon 5 to restock his Explorer ship, the Cortez, before
he and his crew set out to chart more unseen worlds. Maynard mentions to
Sheridan that while he was on a recent mission, he witnessed something
strange out at the Rim -- an indescribable black figure. With Maynard's
return comes self-doubt in Sheridan, who is feeling that he's nothing more
than a desk jockey now and is yearning for his old exploration days.

As they map out sector 900, a severe explosion occurs on the Cortez, causing
them to lose power and fly blind, with no way out of hyperspace. After
receiving a faint mayday signal from Cortez, Sheridan becomes determined to
save the ship -- and his good friend -- from peril. Although, no ship has
ever been recovered from hyperspace before, he knowingly risks the loss of
his best fighter pilots, commanding them to find and rescue the Cortez at all
costs. And, when the fighter ships are threatened by the force of a
mysterious Shadowman vessel, which tumbles the fighters off-course, they find
that there may not be a safe return to Babylon 5.

Meanwhile, Teronn (SANDY GRINN), a Minbari, tells Delenn (MIRA FURLAN), he
fears she is no longer one of them and he insists he take the matter to the
Grey Council, in case she has something to hide. Delenn, who continues to
endure tests from Dr. Franklin (RICHARD BIGGS), to monitor her health, begins
to develop a mutual appreciation with Captain Sheridan.

Also, Sheridan, Ivanova and Garibaldi find themselves on the receiving end of
new diets, enforced by Dr. Franklin...and they're not happy about it.

Aboard Babylon 5, Bester (WALTER KOENIG), a Psi Corps cop, asks telepath
Talia Winters to help investigate the underground railroad of unregistered
telepaths. According to law, all human telepaths must be registered with the
Psi Corps and their activities monitored to prevent breaches of security and
invasion of privacy. However, some unregistered telepaths are escaping from
Earth and being smuggled to the outer colonies where the Corps cannot detect
them.

Determined to apprehend the telepaths, Bester's methods are dubious. When
Bester and Talia locate the telepaths, they attempt to kill Bester and, in
the process, capture Talia instead. A Lurker (GIANIN LOFFLER) asks Talia to
help them with their cause. The telepaths convince Talia of the widespread
corruption within the Psi Corps, and she begins to question her own future
with the Corps.

Sheridan and Talia eventually learn that Dr. Franklin is responsible for the
smuggling of telepaths aboard Babylon 5. Sheridan, too, becomes sympathetic.
Using their collective minds to foil Bester, the renegade telepaths escape
with the help of Talia. However, Bester is convinced that he killed them and
that Talia agrees with his actions. Franklin promises Sheridan that he will
no longer use Babylon 5 as a hideaway for other telepaths since it has become

Meanwhile, Sheridan is outraged that he and Ivanova may soon be charged rent

immediately, a move that makes Captain Sheridan uneasy as Babylon 5 is
supposed to be a neutral port-of-call.

General Franklin's arrival also brings about mixed emotions from his son. The

While some of the surly Gropos interact peacefully with their hosts, there

Lyta is convicted there is a "sleeper" spy on Babylon 5 and she wants to send
the password to each major crew member to root out the spy. Sheridan is
concerned that it is an invasion of privacy, but when someone tries to kill
Lyta, he allows her to do it. Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) initially refuses
the procedure--she has never allowed a mind scan because her mother abused
her by probing her thoughts constantly. Ivanova eventually admits to Sheridan
that she herself is a latent telepath--an admission that endangers them both,
since she is not registered with the Psi Corps. When Lyta finally does link
with Ivanova's mind, she finds that she is not the spy.

When the station's commercial telepath, Talia Winters (ANDREA THOMPSON),
enters the room and Lyta sends her the password, Talia's personality is
instantly changed. She becomes furious and tries to kill Lyta. Talia, whom
everyone loved and trusted, is a Psi corps spy, unwittingly gathering
information for the day when they would use her. Fortunately, Sheridan did
not include Talia in the small group of officers who are secretly
investigating a conspiracy involving the assassination of the president on
Earth, but she did learn about the "underground railroad" of escaped
telepaths.

Before leaving the station, Lyta has a rendezvous with the enigmatic Vorlon
Ambassador Kosh--the two seem to be very familiar with each other.

  The Long, Twilight Struggle

Transmission order: No. 220

Production order: No. 220

After a long period of war, the Narn are running out of resources. As a last,
desperate attempt to hold off the Centauri, the Narn secretly plan to use the
majority of their fleet to destroy a heavily guarded Centauri supply world.
While this would leave the Narn homeworld vulnerable, it would temporarily
cripple the Centauri forces and give the Narn time to build their defenses.

Unfortunately, the Centauri intercept a Narn transmission detailing the plan.
The Centauri forces, aided by shadow fighters and the ambitious Centauri
Ambassador Londo Mollari (PETER JURASIK), avert the supply world attack and
launch a surprise attack on the Narn homeworld, using incredibly powerful
"mass drivers" that are outlawed by treaty. Londo seems pained by the bloody
culmination of what he himself started, but obeys his government's orders.
The Narn surrender and Londo orders the removal of Narn Ambassador G'Kar
(ANDREAS KATSULAS) from the Babylon 5 Advisory Council. G'Kar proudly states
that his people will not be shackled forever, and Captain Sheridan provides
him with sanctuary.

Meanwhile, Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) and Minbari Ambassador Delenn (MIRA
FURLAN) are contacted by Draal (JOHN SCHUCK), a mysterious creature who
merged with a computer deep inside a planet near Babylon 5. Draal has access
to information spanning the universe and, along with Delenn, knows of the
"coming darkness."

After their meeting with Draal, Delenn introduces Sheridan to the Rangers, a
secret band of freedom fighters supported by the Minbari Security Chief
Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), and various Minbaris and Humans. Prophesying that
the recent bloodshed is only a harbinger of even greater destruction, Delenn
confers partial leadership of the Rangers on Sheridan, and Draal gives him
access to his phenomenal resources. Babylon 5 is about to become a fortress
of light, guarding the frontiers of civilization.

  Comes the Inquisitor

Transmission order: No. 221

Production order: No. 221

Now a civilian, G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS) staunchly continues the resistance
effort against the Centauri, publicly trying to rally the Narns on Babylon 5.
The Centauri have cut off all contact with the Narn homeworld, but with the
help of sympathetic Security Chief Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), G'Kar locates an
illegal arms supplier who can smuggle the weapons to the Narn homeworld.

Meanwhile, Vorlon Ambassador Kosh must determine if Minbari Ambassador
Delenn's (MIRA FURLAN) motives are genuine in allying with him against the
coming onslaught of the evil Shadows. Kosh summons a bizarre emissary,
Sebastian (WAYNE ALEXANDER), apparently a human in 19th Century Earth
clothes, who arrives in a Vorlon ship. Sebastian claims to have lived in
London, England in 1888, but will explain no more.

Sebastian subjects Delenn to a series of degrading and torturous tests of
willpower. Delenn falters under his intense and enigmatic questioning. But
when Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) tries to save her and is almost killed by
Sebastian, she proves herself. Delenn offers to sacrifice herself to save
Sheridan. Sebastian declares that she passed the test, as no other has ever
done. Even knowing the gravity of her mission, she would give her life for
just one person, alone and unnoticed. Others would only do so for millions of
lives and personal glory.

Later, Sheridan consults the station computers and learns that Sebastian did
live in London 1888, but disappeared the morning after a series of violent
murders. Sheridan confronts Sebastian and Sebastian explains that the Vorlons
abducted him and subjected him to centuries of service as penance for his
crimes. He also reveals his nickname when he was on Earth: Jack the Ripper.

  The Fall of Night

Transmission order: No. 222

Production order: No. 222

Following their staggering victory in the Centauri/Narn war, the Centauris
continue their expansion by invading the territories of both the Drazi and
Pak'ma'ra races. Captain Sheridan (BRUCE BOXLEITNER) angrily confronts
Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari (PETER JURASIK), accusing his people of
destabilizing the entire region. Londo, who secretly has misgivings about the
swiftness of the Centauri empire's growth, nonetheless warns Sheridan to stay
out of the situation.

After months of vexing neutrality during the Centauri domination of Narn,
Earth sends a representative from the Ministry of Peace, Frederick Lantz (ROY
DOTRICE), to Babylon 5. Sheridan is relieved that someone will finally
investigate the Centauris' aggression. Lantz immediately interviews Mollari
and the representatives from the invaded worlds. Then, Lantz gives Sheridan
some incredible news about Earth's position on the matter.

Meanwhile, Lantz's assistant, Welles (JOHN VICKERY), conducts an
interrogation and learns that Sheridan is secretly harboring a battered Narn
battle cruiser until they can make repairs and escape. Welles tells the
Centauris, who send a heavily armed cruiser to block the Narn ship. Sheridan
orders a fleet of fighters to escort the Narn ship out of Babylon 5's space,
and when the Centauris fire on Babylon 5, a firefight ensues and the Centauri
ship is destroyed. Lieutenant Keffer (ROBERT RUSLER), who once glimpsed a
Shadow, the evil and as-yet-undetected race who are in league with the
Centauri, escorts the Narn ship through hyperspace and makes a terrifying
discovery.

As Sheridan travels by shuttle to a neutral meeting place to formally
apologize to the Centauris, a Centauri bomb explodes, sending Sheridan flying
through the air. It appears that no one can save him before he hits the deck
and is pulverized. But Vorlon Ambassador Kosh performs an amazing feat to
save Sheridan. Later, the true history and motives of the Vorlons are finally
revealed.

As the year 2259 ends, the success of Babylon 5's peacekeeping mission is
questioned. But, before lighting a Menorah in commemoration of Hanukkah,
Commander Ivanova (CLAUDIA CHRISTIAN) gives Sheridan a Christmas gift: a
piece of shrapnel from a supposedly indestructible ship he once demolished.
She reminds him that sometimes the impossible...is possible.

Character:
@{i}@{b}Ambassador Delenn@{ui}@{ub}

Race:
@{i}@{b}Minbari@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

Delenn was raised as a member of the Religious Caste from an early age.
Delenn became part of the Grey Council and was there at the death of their
leader Dukhat in 2242. She has hated Soul Hunters ever since she defended
Dukhat's soul from one shortly after his death. During the Earth-Minbari war
she was onboard a Minbari cruiser on the Battle of the Line, and was the one
who chose Sinclair to be brought aboard the ship so they could examine
Humans. When they discovered that Minbari souls were being reborn into Humans
she decided to support the decision to surrender.

In 2256 she was assigned to Babylon 5 to study the Humans and determine
whether they were the race Valen once spoke of. She decided to keep her
position within the Grey Council a secret and was known simply as Ambassador
Delenn. Later when an assassination attempt was made on Ambassador Kosh, she
supplied Sinclair with the necessary information to help save his life. From
then on she has always had a close relationship with the Commander. In 2258
she was offered the position as leader of the Grey Council, but declined on
the grounds that she must continue her work aboard Babylon 5. At the end of
2258 Delenn entered a Chrysalis and emerged at the beginning of 2259 as a
half Human, half Minbari hybrid. After her transformation many of the Minbari
lost respect for her and she was removed from the Grey Council. When Babylon
5 fought for independence from Earth in 2260 she went back to the Grey
Council once again and demanded that they act. At this point the Council was
split and then disbanded. She now has a very close relationship with Captain
Sheridan and is known as Ranger 1, the leader of the Rangers.

Character:
@{i}@{b}Dr. Stephen Franklin@{ui}@{ub}

Race:
@{i}@{b}Human@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

Stephen Franklin was assigned to Babylon 5 in 2258 to replace Dr. Benjamin
Kyle. As the son of General Richard Franklin, he has had a difficult
relationship with his father who, because of the nature of his job, spent
most of his time away from his family. Franklin studied Xenobiology under
both Dr. Vance Hendricks and Dr. Everett Jacobs. Soon after, Franklin began
hitchhiking across the galaxy, trading his medical skills for passage aboard
the ships. When the Earth-Minbari war began, Franklin joined Earthforce and
nearing the end of the war was instructed to hand over his notes on Minbari
genetics. Earthforce wanted to develop biological weapons that could be used
against the Minbari, but Franklin refused and destroyed all his records.

Franklin strongly believes that every life is sacred and will break any rules
necessary to ensure he does everything he can to save a patient. He showed
this devotion to his job shortly after arriving on Babylon 5 in 2258, by
attempting to save a dying alien boy against his parent's wishes. In 2259,
Franklin also helped to illegally relocate escaping telepaths away from the
Psi Corp by running an underground operation aboard the station. Because of
his devotion to his work in 2259, Franklin started to become dependant on
Stims, a type of physical and mentally enhancing drug. By mid 2260 he had
become addicted and once he had admitted his problem, resigned from his post
and went on 'Walkabout'. Near the end of 2260 he had kicked the habit and
after being attacked and left for dead, managed to get help and soon after
was re-appointed to his position in Medlab.

Race:
@{i}@{b}Human@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

Born on Earth in 2221, Michael Garibaldi has worked most of his life in
security, as did his father before him. He has spent a lot of that time
fighting his own alcoholism, and admits that he hit the bottle when life got
too tough. In 2241 Garibaldi worked as a security officer on Europa. Many of
the other members of security were corrupt and would accept bribes. As the
only one who tried to do his job properly he was under immense pressure,
which eventually drove him to drink. While working there he became strong
friends with a pilot called Frank Kemmer. When Garibaldi came too close to
uncovering the bribery, Frank was killed by a bomb and Garibaldi was framed
for it. He was then blackballed through the entire system. His other postings
include Orion 4 and Fortune City.

He played his part in the Earth-Minbari war as a GROPOS and for a long time
afterwards sufferred from nightmares. In 2255, while operating a 'no
questions asked' shuttle run on Mars, he was hired by Lieutenant Jeffrey
Sinclair. Afterwards he became close friends with Sinclair. Later that year
he began working for Mars Colony Security until he was offerred the post as
Chief of security in 2256 on Babylon 5 by Commander Sinclair. Garibaldi was
an unlikly choice, but Sinclair insisted that he was given the job. In 2258
he was almost killed by one of his own men, and as a result began to doubt
his ability to do his job. Garibaldi showed his loyalty most at the close of
2260, by following the orders of Captain Sheridan, even though he strongly
disagreed with them. While Sheridan was on Z'ha'dum fighting for his life,
Garibaldi was scrambled with the rest of Babylon 5's fighter wings to defend
the station against the shadows, but did not return after the Shadows
retreated.

Character:
@{i}@{b}Ambassador/Citizen G'Kar@{ui}@{ub}

Race:
@{i}@{b}Narn@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

As a child, G'Kar lived on the Narn Homeworld with his family. At that time
the Centauri still had control of the Narn Homeworld, and he and his family
were made to serve as slaves. After his father had spilt some drink over his
Centauri master he was hung from a tree for three days before he died. During
this time G'Kar visited his father against his mother's wishes. Before he
died he told G'Kar to be all the things he never was, and to fight for his
freedom. Shortly after, G'Kar ran away and killed his first Centauri. G'Kar
has always believed that the Narn would be under threat while the Centauri
race was still alive. In 2253 he became part of the third circle of the
Kha'Ri.

In 2256 he was sent to Babylon 5 and assumed the position of Ambassador
there. When Ambassador Kosh arrived on the station, G'Kar became mixed up in
an assassination attempt on the Vorlon's life in an effort to gain extra
alliances. When the Centauri Emperor Turhan visited the station G'Kar got the
approval of the Kha'Ri to kill him. Before he got his wish the Centauri
Emperor died, but sent a message to G'Kar telling him that he wished to
apologise for what his family had done to the Narn. For the first time G'Kar
believed that there may be a spark of decency in the Centauri. This belief
was shattered 24 hours later when the Centauri destroyed a Narn outpost in
Quadrant 14 and this led to another Narn-Centauri war. After the Narn were
forced to surrender, G'Kar was given sanctuary aboard Babylon 5 by Captain
Sheridan, and as part of the Narn unconditional surrender was stripped of his
position as Ambassador. He now helps run the Narn underground resistance in
the hope of freedom and revenge. In G'Kar's time aboard Babylon 5 he has
survived three separate assassination attempts on his life. In 2260 after
attacking Londo, G'Kar was sentenced to 60 days in the station's prison
facility. He was released early, shortly before the station's conflict with
Earth. Later that year he was accepted into the Conspiracy of Light and has
provided them with both information and weapons support. He is a strong
follower of the book of G'Quan which provided Sheridan and his allies with
one of the Shadow's weaknesses.

@node ivanova "Commander Susan Ivanova"


Character:
@{i}@{b}Commander Susan Ivanova@{ui}@{ub}

Race:
@{i}@{b}Human@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

Susan Ivanova was born in St. Petersburg, Earth on 30th August 2230. She was
raised as a Jew abroad, to avoid the Psi Corp discovering her telepathic
abilities. At a young age her mother Sofie had warned her to never allow a
telepath to scan her. Sofie succeeded in hiding her telepathic ability until
her 35th birthday when she was discovered. She was forced to take drugs to
suppress her telepathic ability and this drove her to commit suicide,
something for which Ivanova will never forgive the Psi Corp. Ivanova had one
brother called Gayna who was killed in the Earth-Minbari war a year after
Sofie's suicide.

Susan followed in the footsteps of her brother when she joined Earthforce,
against her father Andrei's wishes, in 2247. In 2249 she graduated from the
OTC and was later transferred to Io, where she served under John Sheridan.
Ivanova worked her way up though the ranks and in 2258 became Babylon 5's
second in command, under Commander Sinclair. She does not like to show
weakness, and when her father died in 2258, she continued her normal duties
until Rabbi Koslov convinced her to let go. She was promoted to the rank of
Commander shortly after Sheridan's arrival on the station. In an attempt to
avoid a scan by a telepath, Ivanova admitted to Captian Sheridan that she is
a latent telepath. Despite her hatred of the Psi Corp she showed strong
feelings towards telepath Talia Winters, until Talia was revealed to be a Psi
Corp spy and was transferred back to Earth. In 2260 Ivanova played a vital
part in the both the station's fight for independence and the huge
confrontation with the Shadows.

Character:
@{i}@{b}Ambassador Kosh@{ui}@{ub}

Race:
@{i}@{b}Vorlon@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

Little is known about the Vorlon Ambassador Kosh, and even less about the
Vorlon race. Both the Earth Alliance and the Centauri Republic sent
exploration craft into Vorlon space but both dissapeared without a trace.
Ever since his first arrival on Babylon 5 in 2256, Kosh has always kept a low
profile and rarely attended Council meetings stating, that the affairs of
others were not his concerns. Kosh wears what is referred to as an
Environment Suit but is thought to only be a disguise. Delenn once revealed
that Kosh hides his true form within this suit, to avoid being recognised.
Kosh usually stores his organic ship in Bay 13, a bay that many maintenence
crew now refuse to enter.

Shortly after his arrival on the Station in 2257, Kosh was poisoned and
Commander Sinclair was framed for the attack. Once Captain Sheridan had taken
command of Babylon 5, Kosh began to observe things more closely and had many
meetings with Sheridan to help the Captain learn about himself. At the close
of the year 2259, Kosh left his suit to save Sheridan's life as he jumped
from a transport tube over the Babylon 5 gardens. Lyta Alexander now serves
as his aide after returning with him from the Vorlon Homeworld in 2260. Later
that year, after Kosh had ordered Vorlon forces to attack a group of
advancing Shadow ships, he was attacked and killed in his quarters. During
the fight Kosh spoke to Sheridan's mind while the Captain slept. Even since
his death he still seems to be with Sheridan in some way and often speaks to
him. Kosh's death was kept a secret at the request of the Vorlon Empire and
his replacement arrived shortly after. When asked his name the new Vorlon
simply replied "Kosh. We are all Kosh".

Profile:

Lennier was born into the Religious Caste and is a member of the Third Fain
of Chu'Domo. He was raised in a monastery from an early age and spent most of
his time learning about other races and studying the 97 different dialects of
the Minbari language. He achieved the rank of Master Adept in maths and
excels in the area of probability. Lennier also learnt Minbari martial arts
intended for use in self defence and has a strong passion for history.

In 2258 Lennier left the monastery for the first time and travelled to
Babylon 5 to assume his position as Ambassador Delenn's aide. During his time
on the station with Delenn he has always stood by her, and in 2259, when she
lost her place in the Grey Council, refused to return home to Minbar, stating
that he would stand by her side for the rest of her life. Although Lennier
lost many of his clan and family aboard the Black Star in the Earth-Minbari
war, he was never shown any hatred towards Captain Sheridan. Lennier is a
vital part of the crew of the White Star, both as the pilot and as a
translator for the Minbari crew. Like Dr. Franklin, he believes all life is
sacred, and in 2260, during a series of bombings aboard the station, put his
own life in danger trying to save Delenn and Londo. As part of a religious
ceremony Lennier revealed to Marcus that he was in love with Delenn, but knew
her love was for someone else.

Race:
@{i}@{b}Centauri@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

As a young Centauri and a member of the Couro Prido, Londo was always looking
for some way to prove his worth to the world. This led him to swear that he
would die on his feet doing something noble and brave. After one failed
marriage to a Centauri dancing girl, Londo was left to enter three arranged
marriages, and just like every Centauri, believes that he has seen his own
death in a vision, and that it will be at the hands of G'Kar.

In 2256 Londo was sent to Babylon 5 with orders to make alliances with other
races. On the station, Londo has had many conflicts with the Narn Ambassador,
most of which were just another way of venting his anger at the Narn race.
The year 2258 saw a visit by a mysterious man called Morden, and shortly
afterwards saw a secret alliance with the ancient Shadow race. In 2259 Londo
made a further alliance with Lord Refa who shared his hope for glory to
return to the Centauri. Just before the death of the Centauri Emperor Turhan,
Londo was instucted that it was time to do something to make them stand out
from the other factions, and asked the Shadows to attack a Narn outpost in
Quadrant 14. Following the attack the Narn declared war on the Centauri. When
the war drew to a close Londo was there at the bombing of the Narn Homeworld,
and was later hailed as the main architect in the victory. At the end of
2259, when Kosh came out of his Environment Suit, Londo was the only alien
present who did not see Kosh's true form and could not understand why. In
2260 Londo decided to break his alliance with the Shadows and met with
Morden, who stated he would honor the request on the condition that the
Centauri did not enter a specified Quadrant of space set aside by the
Shadows. Throughout his reign of terror and corruption Londo has lost many
things, including the friendship of Garibaldi and the respect of Vir.

Profile:

Lyta Alexander was born on 10th December 2225 on Earth. She joined the Psi
Corps at the age of 26 in 2252. While working on the Psi Corps Intern Program
she worked alongside Talia Winters. Lyta has also worked as a Psi Cop but
disliked her position. As a registered telepath she has a rating of P5.

She became Babylon 5's first commercial telepath on January 3rd 2257. As a
loyal telepath she always kept to the rules of the Psi Corps. When Ambassador
Kosh was poisoned in 2257, Commander Sinclair convinced Lyta to illegally
scan the Vorlon in an attempt to save his life. As a result of the scan Dr.
Kyle was able to locate the poison and save the Vorlon's life. After this
incident Lyta was recalled to Earth and fiercely interrogated by the Psi
Corps in an attempt to discover what she had seen in the Vorlon's mind. Lyta
simply stated she had experienced a feeling she could not express in words.
six months after escaping from the Psi Corps, Lyta returned to Babylon 5 to
warn the Captain that they were under threat from a spy. 'Sleeper spies' as
they are known, are programmed with an alternate personality to
subconsciously collect information until they are telepathically sent a
password to unlock it. Lyta revealed the spy to be Talia Winters and Talia
was sent back to Earth. Ever since she had scanned Kosh in 2257, Lyta had
always been drawn to Vorlon space. In 2260 she finally got her wish when she
returned to Babylon 5 with Kosh from the Vorlon Homeworld, and now works as
his aide. She has been a loyal ally of the Conspiracy of Light as she proved
later in 2260 when she managed to block a Shadow ship's thoughts long enough
for the White Star to destroy it.

Marcus Cole is one of the many Rangers of the Conspiracy of Light. When his

In 2260 Marcus escaped from Zagros 7 where many of the Rangers were being
trained, and travelled to Babylon 5. Once there he asked Sheridan to help
rescue the remaining Rangers from the blockade at Zagros 7. Marcus is a
trusted and loyal member of the Conspiracy of Light and will always keep his
word. When Delenn became head of the Rangers nearing the end of 2260, he
risked his own life to save hers by fighting Neroon of the Minbari Warrior
Caste. Neroon had intended to stop Delenn taking the position of Ranger 1 at

Character:

Race:
@{i}@{b}Human@{ui}@{ub}

Profile:

John Sheridan began his career serving under Captain Jack Maynard on the
Moon-Mars patrol. He was also posted to the jump point at Io along with Susan
Ivanova. While in command of the Earth Alliance Agammemnon, during the
Earth-Minbari war, he managed to destroy the Minbari flagship known as the
Black Star. Although a great victory for the Earth Alliance, the sending of a
fake distress signal after the mining of the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter was seen by the Minbari as a dishonourable act. Because of this, many
Minbari still refer to him as the 'Starkiller'.

Sheridan assumed command of Babylon 5 at the beginning of 2259 following
Commander Sinclair's surprising re-assignment to the Minbari Homeworld. After
Sheridan's arrival, Ambassador Kosh began to show more of an interest in
station affairs and especially in Sheridan. Soon after, Kosh began a series
of meetings to help the Captain understand himself and to prepare him to
fight legends. Kosh has from time to time touched Sheridan's mind when they
were far apart to help him, even following the Vorlon's death in 2260,
Sheridan still hears Kosh talk to him. He has now taken on a far greater role
than Babylon 5's Commander, as one of the leaders of the Conspiracy of Light
in the fight against the Shadows. Sheridan also shares joint leadership of
the Army of Light known as the Rangers, and has his own craft called the
White Star. He has always been haunted by the death of his wife Anna, who was
believed to have died on the Icarus exploration craft, while exploring the
planet Z'Ha'Dum. Nearing the close of 2260 he learnt many things about her
disappearance, including the fact that she was still alive. Following his
visit to Z'ha'dum he managed to kill many of the Shadows by instructing the
White Star with two 500 mega ton bombs to fly into the planet. After the
explosion Sheridan was missing and presumed dead.

Profile:

Jeffrey David Sinclair, born 3rd May 2218, joined Earthforce in 2237. He was
promoted to fighter pilot in 2240 and soon after became Squad leader. In 2248
he was involved in the last stand against the Minbari, known as the Battle of
the Line. During the fight many Humans died as the Minbari attacked Earth
with deadly force. When Sinclair's Starfury was hit and partially disabled,
he decided to ram a Minbari Cruiser. Before the impact he blacked out, only
to awaken 24 hours later to find that the Minbari had withdrawn on the brink
of victory.

Sinclair became Babylon 5's first Commander in 2256 when he was mysteriously
selected from a long list of higher ranking Earthforce personnel by the
Minbari. Sinclair has always respected the religious beliefs of others and at
the end of 2259 he became Ambassador Sinclair. At this time he moved off the
station and was permanently based on the Minbari Homeworld. From there he
became Ranger 1 and, in secret, began to gather the Rangers together in
preparation to fight the Shadows. In late 2260 he returned to Babylon 5 to
embark on a joint mission to take Babylon 4 back in time. During the trip
back with Babylon 4 he went through the same transformation as Delenn and
became Valen, A highly respected religious Minbari leader.

disagrees with them.

He has shown distrust and dislike towards Mr Morden ever since Londo's
alliance with him, near the end of 2258. In early 2260 Vir was sent to Minbar
to take up the temporary position of Centauri representative. While there, he
also played an important part in helping the fleeing Narns escape from the
Centauri by organizing an Underground Railroad. This led him to falsify

  The Hour of the Wolf

Transmission order: No. 401

Production order: No. 401

With reports of a thermonuclear detonation on Z'ha'dum, Ivanova battles with
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to maintain their forces on Babylon 5.
Realizing the alliance is fracturing, the members of the league instead
choose to tighten all defenses back on their respective homeworlds.

Now a member of the Centauri royal court, Londo returns to his homeland at
the request of Emperor Cartagia. While there he gets a surprise visit from
Mr. Morden, who is horribly scarred from the thermonuclear blast. Morden
explains how the incident on Z'ha'dum has forced the Shadows to look for some
outside support. In an effort to strengthen his power. Emperor Cartagia
strikes a deal with the Shadows, allowing them a base of operations on
Centauri Prime in the belief that they will grant him godhood, like the
emperors of old. Londo, realizing the emperor is insane, instructs Vir to
come at once to Centauri Prime. Upon his arrival, Londo explains to Vir how
they must stop Cartagia before it's too late.

Delenn pleads with Kosh to send a force to investigate the whereabouts of
Sheridan but Kosh Refuses. Meanwhile, G'Kar tells Zack that he is going to
search for the missing Garibaldi, vowing to find him and bring him back to
Babylon 5.

Lyta Alexander visits Ivanova and brings up the idea of taking a vessel to an
area near Z'ha'dum so she can scan for any signals from the missing Captain
Sheridan. Wanting to exhaust all possible resources, Ivanova goes along with
the plan and takes command of a ship in the White Star fleet, along with
Lyta, Delenn and Lennier. Nearing Z'ha'dum, Lyta focuses her telepathic
powers, but is unable to pick up any signs of Sheridan. Now convinced that
the captain is dead, Ivanova realizes she must complete the work he has
started.

  Whatever Happened to Mr Garibaldi

Transmission order: No. 402

Production order: No. 402

Sheridan finds himself in an underground area of Z'ha'dum in the presence of
Lorien, who informs the Captain that he is in a state suspended between life
and death. Lorien pleads to Sheridan to surrender himself to death, or run
the risk of being caught forever in-between. Sheridan also discovers some
interesting information on who Lorien actually is.

G'Kar continues on his search for Garibaldi and meets up with Isaac who had
salvaged a part of an abandoned Starfury. G'Kar pleads to know who told him
where the ship was, but their conversation gets interrupted by Harry, the bar
owner. A fight quickly ensues, and to the surprise of G'Kar, Marcus and his
fighting pike are there to help ward off the attackers. Marcus had come to
help G'Kar in case he landed into trouble. Later, after some investigation,
Marcus learns that the location of Garibaldi's Starfury was given to Isaac by
a person from Interplanetary Expeditions name Montagne. G'Kar please with
Marcus and convinces him to go back to Babylon 5 to utilize the station's
vast resources to help him solve Garibaldi's whereabouts.

Meanwhile, a concerned Dr. Franklin visits Delenn who has fasted for seven
days. Believing the latest turn of events are her fault, she instructs the
doctor that she will not eat or drink until Sheridan returns.

Harry identifies G'Kar to a Centauri guard from sheets of wanted posters
after discovering that a reward has been placed on him. His whereabouts
uncovered, G'Kar is overcome by a group of Centauri guards who fire their
weapons, striking him in the shoulder.

At Delenn's urging, jump gate forms near Babylon 5 and the entire White Star
fleet emerges. Addressing the gathering of Rangers, Minbari and Humans,
Delenn pleads with them to strike one last blow against the Shadows and
attack Z'ha'dum. Her plan is to wait seven days so that ships that wish to
fight have sufficient time to arrive. The Rangers respond to her plan with a
unified shout of support.

Emperor Cartagia insists on meeting with Londo and presents him with a gift
-- the captured G'Kar. Londo is torn with this development and secretly
offers G'Kar a proposition. IN exchange for his life being spared, G'Kar must
assist Londo in his plan to get the Emperor removed from the throne. G'Kar
agrees, but only if the Centauri leave Narn, setting his homeworld free.
Londo gives him his word.

Meanwhile, a captured Garibaldi remains hostage in a dark, isolated cell, and
is questioned by a faceless voices about what he remembers after he was taken
from Babylon 5. Garibaldi claims he remembers nothing.

  The Summoning

Transmission order: No. 403

Production order: No. 403

While on their quest in search of The First Ones, Ivanova and Marcus discover
an enormous fleet of Vorlon ships, along with a daunting and mysterious
station, hiding in hyperspace.

Meanwhile, Zack decides to track the transport vessel which found Garibaldi's
fighter, believing it may house the missing security chief. Escorted by
several Starfuries, Zack eventually locates the ship and orders them to
surrender. When the transport refuses, Zack attacks them, firing several
shots. The vessel explodes, but not before ejecting a life pod. Rescuing the
pod, Zack finds an unconscious Garibaldi inside and rushes him back to
Babylon 5. When Garibaldi regains consciousness under Dr. Franklin's medical
care, an unsure Zack feels as if something isn't quite right with him.

Emperor Cartagia tortures a determined G'Kar who refuses to comply with the
demands of his captors. Left with no choice, a frustrated Londo and Vir wait
for the right time to set their plan in motion, hoping G'Kar will live to
help take part.

Brakiri Ambassador Lethke informs Delenn of news that the other League worlds
are worried about her decision to attack Z'ha'dum, believing it will only
provoke a deadly response. In protest of her actions, the opposition
organizes an open forum to stir up popular support. In the middle of the
rally, a ship approaches Babylon 5 and boards the station. To the surprise of
everyone, Captain Sheridan emerges and catches the attention of those
assembled. Speaking to the divided crowd, Sheridan convinces them that he is
living proof that the enemy is not indestructible and can be beaten. With his
inspiring words, he pleads for everyone to band together and form the largest
fleet in history. The crowd, now unified, cheers together.

Later, in the presence of the mysterious Lorien, Sheridan address Delenn,
Lennier, Franklin and Garibaldi and explains the history behind the situation
which has been unfolding, concluding that they are caught in the middle of a
long and bitter conflict between the Shadows and the Vorlons.

  Falling Towards Apotheosis

Transmission order: No. 404

Production order: No. 404

The Vorlon forces continue to escalate the crisis by utilizing their deadly
weapon , the planet killer, to eliminate any world, base or colony where the
Shadows have influence. With survivors streaming into Babylon 5, Dr. Franklin
recommends that Epsilon 3, the planet below which has never been touched by
Shadows, be used to set up a portable Medlab and to house refugees. Captain
Sheridan agrees.

Fearing for the safety of Centauri Prime, a concerned Londo pleads with
Morden and Emperor Cartagia to get rid of the numerous Shadow vessels housed
there. A confident Morden remains certain that the Vorlons would never attack
a world as big as theirs, and requests that Londo arrange for a blockade of
ships around them to defend against any attack. Later, alone with the
Emperor, Londo uncovers the leader's twisted plans to turn what he believes
may be his soon-to-be-fallen Centauri Prime into a huge inauguration pyre to
commemorate his ascension into godhood.

In light of his government's recent attacks against the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds, Sheridan asks Garibaldi to get rid of Kosh, but the stubborn Vorlon
refuses to go away without a fight.

A suspicious Garibaldi remains intent on uncovering who Lorien is and why he
seems to follow Sheridan around.

With information that the Vorlons may reach Centauri Prime in seven days,
Londo spins a plan and convinces the emperor to conduct the execution of
G'Kar on Narn so that others can witness his greatness. Cartagia buys into
his plan and agrees to go.

Meanwhile, Lorien explains to Delenn that when Sheridan was wounded at
Z'ha'dum, he extended the captain's life by giving a little of his own.
However, it comes with a downside -- Sheridan has no longer than twenty years
left to live. Not wanting to lose Delenn again, Sheridan gives her an
engagement ring.

Lennier confirms reports on the latest attacks by the Shadows and Vorlons.
While each side continues to target support facilities and opposing colonies,
neither side has directed an attack against their enemies' homeworld. Sending
out Ranger ships to investigate the attacks, a probe captures images of the
planetkiller, which looks like a huge cloud, Shadow in design, housing
thousands of deadly angular missiles. Watching via a monitor, Delenn quickly
orders the ships to evacuate at once.

Meanwhile, Lennier reports that their scout ships have located the bulk of
the Vorlon fleet massing in hyperspace preparing to strike Coriana 6, a
planet inhabited by over six billion people. Convening the league worlds,
Sheridan explains how they cannot let the Vorlons attack, and quickly makes
plans for launching a major counter-offensive. His idea to hit Vorlon target,
delaying them long enough to put his fleet in a killing zone between the
Vorlons and the Shadows. As part of his master plan, Sheridan makes
arrangements to establish a base near Coriana 6, with intentions of tipping
off the Shadows on its "secret" location in an attempt to lure them into the
area.

With Shadow vessels based on Centauri Prime, Londo and Vir realize they do
not have much time before the Vorlons attack their homeworld. Knowing the
emperor will never release the ships, Londo knows he must act quickly to rid
himself of Cartagia. Spinning his plan, Londo acquires a silver rod housing a
five-inch needle with plans to inject the emperor with a lethal toxin at the
right time.

Paraded around just prior to his execution at the hands of the Centauri,
Londo's scheme kicks into action and G'Kar suddenly tears away his confining
shackles. Pandemonium ensues and fights quickly break out. In the middle of
the activity, Londo asks the emperor to come with him to ensure his safety.
Cartagia follows Londo, and, in the middle of a tirade, Cartagia is
assassinated. Later, Londo expresses to his fellow Centauri that the death of
Cartagia was the result of a weakened heart and should be interpreted as a
sign for them to leave Narn, an option which makes good on his agreement with
G'Kar. Londo is nominated to the position of Prime Minister, much to his
surprise.

Meanwhile, Sheridan orders Ivanova and Lorien to continue in their search for
the First Ones.

Ivanova and Lorien, who continue their search for The First Ones, meet with
some success. Instructed by Sheridan to journey to the rendezvous point to
prepare for battle, an impatient Ivanova, afraid she will miss the battle, is
told by Lorien that they cannot win the war by force, but must rather
understand their way through it.

Londo learns from Durano, Minister of Intelligence, that the earlier death of
his companion, Lady Adira, was commissioned by Mr. Morden. Newly elevated to
Prime Minister, Londo exercises his power and orders Morden to remove the
Shadow ships immediately off the Centauri island of Celini. When he refuses,
Londo pushes a button, triggering an enormous explosion which send the entire
island into flames. Londo then throw a bewildered Morden into a cell.

Meanwhile, the entire Vorlon fleet emerges from hyperspace with their own
planetkiller, and side off against the Shadow army, leaving Sheridan's fleet
caught in the middle. Both sides head towards each other, but Sheridan
surprises them and detonates one of his nukes. The intense blast stops the
nearby ships, but doesn't manage to slow down the planetkiller, which
continues to bear down on Coriana 6. Opening up a com channel, Sheridan
pleads with the Shadows not to destroy the planet. As the planetkiller moves
into range on Coriana 6, Sheridan uses his ace in the hole, and signals The
First Ones, which destroy the planetkiller using a burst of concentrated
power. The First Ones then take aim against the Shadow and Vorlon vessels,
who have just sent for reinforcements. A second Shadow deathcloud suddenly
appears and surrounds Sheridan's fleet. The extreme cold shuts down the jump
gates and Marcus realizes they have ten minutes before the cold drops them
below what they can survive.

Inside the White Star, Lyta, without warning, emits a fierce bright light
which immobilizes Sheridan and Delenn with a bursting field of energy. In
their suspended state, Sheridan and Delenn are met with opposing holographic
images of Vorlon and Shadow, which each ask the captain to side with them.

Meanwhile, a missile fires from the deathcloud to the White Star, but a Drazi
ship bravely intercepts the impact, saving the White Star from destruction.
Following this, Sheridan's fleet surround his ship to protect it from the
rash of incoming missiles sent by the deathcloud.

Refusing both sides his loyalty, Sheridan explains to both images that his
forces now have the ability to stand on their own. Lorien interjects, and
explains to the Shadows and Vorlons that their age is now past and the fight
exists now for those races which are younger and possess the will to stand on
their own. With war averted, Lorien turns to Sheridan and explains that an
obligation now rests on his shoulders to teach the races that will follow to
step aside when the time is right in order to allow others to follow their
own destiny. With that, Lorien departs with the Shadows and the Vorlons
beyond the rim, to join the past races who have exited.

Realizing that some thought the death of Cartagia was an attempt to undermine
the monarchy, Londo decides to leave for a while.

Prior to Londo's return back to Babylon 5, he informs a surprised Minister
that the Centarum have decided to appoint him, the Minister as Regent to the
throne until a new emperor can be selected.

Garibaldi shocks everyone when he tenders his resignation as head of
security, effective immediately. Sheridan, learning from Zack that Garibaldi
has been acting strange ever since his return, places him in charge of
security.

Meeting with a high ranking Psi Corps official, Bester uncovers President
Clark's plans to shut down Babylon 5 permanently. Later, through an ISN
broadcast, Sheridan and the crew learn of Clark's ban on all travel between
Earth and Babylon 5, and his orders to seize any ship found in violation of
the new rules.

Spinning his own plan, Bester journeys to Babylon 5 and asks to meet with the
Captain. Once convened, he details specifics on the President's plan to
launch a propaganda war in order to undermine Sheridan's position back home
and among the alien governments. In exchange for the second part of the
President's plan, Bester requests that he be taken back to Z'ha'dum so that
he can uncover Shadow technology which he can subsequently use to free his
lover, who lays in a suspended state inside a cryogenic freezer.

Reluctantly agreeing to Bester's demands, Sheridan learns of the President's
scheme to dispatch the Black Omega Squadron, an elite attack for answerable
only to him, with orders to destroy a squadron of Starfuries previously sent
out by Earthforce for patrol purposes. The evidence left behind would
implicate Babylon 5 and help sway public opinion back on Clark's side. Acting
quickly, Sheridan sends Ivanova along with a fleet of fighters which
successfully assist the Earthforce patrol in fending off the ambush.

Holding up his end of the agreement, Sheridan, Bester and the crew venture to
the Z'ha'dum jump gate, where Sheridan notices a stream of ships evacuating.
Acting on instinct, Sheridan orders the White Star to turn around, just prior
to a massive explosion which levels Z'ha'dum. Later, Sheridan visits Lyta who
confesses that her telepathic signal has set off the planet's destruction
sequence. She, however, chose not to pass along that knowledge for fear of
allowing Z'ha'dum and its complex technology to fall into the wrong hands,
including Bester. While agreeing with her ethic, Sheridan informs Lyta that
any future command level decisions be run through him or else he will turn
her over to the Psi Corps.

While Sheridan is troubled by the fact that the President's embargo is
beginning to have a financial effect on the station, Ivanova remains certain
that the situation will work its way out. Talking to Ivanova, Sheridan also
confesses that he is bothered by his latest correspondence with his father,
having received news from him that strangers have been seen around his family
asking unusual questions. A confident Sheridan believes the President is
somehow involved.

Experiencing mechanical problems with the cryogenic freezers housing
telepaths, Franklin makes preparations to move half of them to another
freezer bank. These telepaths are in a suspended state because of the threat
they pose on themselves and others as a result of the Shadow technology they
have knowledge of.

Meanwhile, Garibaldi sets up his new private venture in the marketplace, but
continues to experience flashbacks from his earlier disappearance.

Dan Randall from ISN News comes to Babylon 5. Sheridan and the crew are less
than enthused by his arrival since the ISN has been turned into a propaganda
arm for President Clark. When Randall promises to get their side of the story
told through an honest, behind-the-scene feature on the current situation of
Babylon 5, the captain acquiesces and assigns Lennier to be his liaison.

Six days later, the ISN Special Report is broadcast, but not as Sheridan had
been promised. Rather than the truth, the station is depicted as a filthy
environment where alien governments are calling the shots. As the forefront,
the story bashes Captain Sheridan, depicting him as a selfish, unstable
figurehead suffering from Minbari War Syndrome, whose effects have left him
with a desire to become an alien and make others around him the same way.
Taking events from Randall's stay out of context, the footage captures images
which falsely accuse Sheridan of conducting medical experiments in an effort
to turn humans into aliens which many be used to help fight against Earth.
Randall also breaks the news to a disbelieving Sheridan that his family's
farm and recently been burned to the ground and that his father is missing,
thus confirming his worst fears. Randall concludes that Babylon 5 is
deteriorating rapidly and must be dealt with before it poses a major threat
to Earth.

Zack gets fitted for his new uniform, but remains ambivalent because in his
mind the gesture admits that Garibaldi is never coming back to his Security
Chief post.

Making plans to counter President Clark's propaganda war, Sheridan asks
Franklin and Marcus to meet with their allies on the Mars colony in an effort
to ensure that they are ready to help in their fight against Earth. In the
absence of all shipping routes, Franklin and Marcus are forced into a
two-week trek to reach their destination.

Delenn informs Sheridan that she is going back to Minbar the following day in
order to conduct some old business. What she isn't telling him is that she
had been summoned back to Minbar and instructed to stand before her clan in
order to justify her relationship with Sheridan.

Upon arrival at Minbar, Delenn and Lennier are greeted by Callenn. Before an
assembled crowd, Callenn explains that in the history of their world, no
Minbari has ever taken an off-worlder as lover or mate. Delenn agrees to
abide by the decision which will be made by the assembled leaders, knowing
she must convince them to accept her relationship on grounds other than the
fact that she is in love with Sheridan.

As part of the process, Delenn drinks from a goblet which induces a dreaming
phase. In this state, she relives her years with Dukhat, leader of the
religious caste and considered the greatest of them. In a series of
flashbacks, Delenn witnesses the attack which prompted the great Minbari War,
and is forced to relive the moment where her vote as a member of the Grey
Council was the deciding one which steered a divided council in favor of a
Minbari strike against the Humans. Lennier is surprised by the news, and
informs Delenn that the others will interpret her actions to become one with
Sheridan as a response at feeling guilt for the death of so many humans.

Wanting a clearer explanation for her actions, she drinks from the goblet
again, and asks Callenn to come with her to the Dreaming so that he can feel
what she has felt. He reluctantly agrees and they flashback to a point where
a dying Dukhat tells Delenn that she is a child of Valen and therefore not a
pure Minbari. Rather than exposing this truth, Callenn urges the assembled
leaders to accept Delenn's relationship with Sheridan. Delenn returns to
Babylon 5 without uttering a word to Sheridan of what had taken place on
Minbar.

Marcus manages to kill it before it inflicts any damage, but in the process

Ivanova works to prepare a broadcast back to Earth; however, her plans are
delayed as Babylon 5 does not have the proper relay stations to boost the
signal. Luckily, Dr. Franklin returns from Mars with good news, reporting
that the Resistance will join their coalition... for now. Learning of
Ivanova's problem, he reminds her that there is enough energy on Epsilon 3 to
make a successful transmission. Although frustrated that she didn't think of
this first, she goes to Epsilon 3 to broadcast directly from there.

Sheridan orders Zack to retrieve Garibaldi's PPG, identicard and link, which
he does reluctantly, to the dismay of Garibaldi. Wade (guest star MARK
SCHNEIDER) pays a visit to Garibaldi proposing to hire him as a bodyguard and
expediter. He wants him to assist in helping a visitor get on Babylon 5
without passing through the mandatory security check. Feeling betrayed by
Zack and Sheridan, Garibaldi accepts the mission.

Garibaldi is shocked to find the visitor is Lise Hampton (guest star DENISE
GENTILE), his old lover from Mars. She tell shim that she is married for the
second time, currently to William Edgars, the owner of the largest medical
research lab on Mars.

  Rumors, Bargains and Lies

Transmission order: No. 413

Production order: No. 413

Sheridan manages to convince Londo and G'Kar to allow White Star ships along
their borders as protection from The Raiders. In an attempt to get the other
League worlds to concur, Sheridan proposes to *NOT* convince them into border
protection, hoping it will have the reverse effect.

A civil war breaks out on Minbar in the capital and Delenn feels partially
responsible since she broke up the Grey Council. She meets with Neroon (guest
star JOHN VICKERY), of the Minbari Warrior Caste, to discuss the civil unrest
of their people. The two plan to work together by agreeing that neither side
will surrender, rather they will use alternate means to achieve peace.

The Drazi ambassador (guest star RON CAMPBELL) is suspicious of the White
Star ships that are at the borders of the Centauri Republic, concluding that
there is something dangerous going on that Sheridan is hiding.

Mistaking Delenn's meeting with Neroon as a sign of betrayal, members of the
Religious Caste decide the only way to stop her is to sacrifice themselves
for the good of their people. They plan to release a poison into the air that
will kill everyone on board. However, Lennier overhears their plan and risks
his own life to stop them before it is too late.

The Drazi ambassador and other race leaders surmise that they are being
discriminated against and left to fend for themselves against an invisible
enemy. The League meets with Sheridan and demands the protection of the White
Star fleet, with the understanding that in return they will support any
actions and decisions made by the fleet. Sheridan's plan is a success.

Neroon secretly leaves the Minbari Cruiser with no intention of making peace
with Delenn. In fact, he has stolen the plans to the Religious Caste's
counterattack, and thinks they can easily be defeated.

  Moments of Transition

Transmission order: No. 414

The leader of the Warrior Caste, Shakiri (guest star BART McCARTHY,) sends
word to Delenn that his forces have surrounded the city. He demands that the
Religious Caste surrender or he will raze the city.

Lyta is unable to find work as she is not a member of the Psi Corps and has
no one to turn to for help. Coincidentally, Bester (special guest star WALTER
KOENIG) resurfaces on Babylon 5 and approaches Lyta with a proposition. He
wants her to rejoin the Psi Corps but in name only, allowing her to continue
doing freelance work. The catch is that she must sign her body over to Bester
upon her death. He suspects that the Vorlons enhanced her telepathic
abilities, and does not want the secret of how they did this to die with her.
Angered by his motives, she turns him down.

Delenn instructs Lennier to tell the Warrior Caste that they are prepared to
surrender. Neroon (guest star JOHN VICKERY) decides that the surrender should
take place at the temple of Varenni, where long ago the disputes between the
castes were settled. Shakiri tells Neroon that Delenn is a threat to their
authority and must die after the surrender is made.

Zack informs Lyta that the station resources department wants her to move
into smaller quarters because she does not have a regular income. He offers
her a job which entails scanning Garibaldi without his consent, which she
refuses as it is against her ethics. Lyta visits Garibaldi to ask for a job,
just as he is finishing business with a new client, Mr. Adams (guest star
SCOTT ADAMS, creator of the comic strip, "Dilbert"), who needs help finding
his lost pets. When the job with Garibaldi doesn't work out, Lyta resigns
herself to Bester's hideous proposition in an act of desperation.

Meanwhile, back on Minbar, Delenn surrenders at the temple of Varenni in
front of her people. However, she proclaims that the Religious Caste will not
give up their rights to form a new government. She invites Shakiri to
determine their leader as the Ancients did, by stepping into a circle on the
temple floor where the Starfire wheel would open, consuming them in its
flames. Whoever gives their life for their caste determines which caste shall
lead. Delenn enters the circle accepting death and challenging Shakiri who
enters the circle but doesn't want to die and dives out. Neroon runs into the
circle sacrificing his life to save Delenn.

Delenn, who is physically weak but mentally strong, calls upon a new Grey
Council. However this time each caste is not equally represented as they were
in the past. She appoints two members from the Religious and Warrior castes
and five members from the Worker caste. She reminds the Minbari that in the
past the Worker caste had always been forgotten, which will not be the case
any longer.

Back at Babylon 5, an infuriated Ivanova informs Sheridan that 10,000 people
aboard commercial liners transporting sick women and children were killed in
an attempt to flee President Clark's killing zone. Enraged, Sheridan declares
it is time to fight back against President Clark and calls an emergency
meeting with the league worlds.

  No Surrender, No Retreat

Transmission order: No. 415

Sheridan calls an emergency meeting with the league worlds and asks that in
exchange for the protection that has been provided to their borders, they
nullify their mutual defense treaties with Earth. He also asks that they each
contribute one destroyer-class ship to the defense of Babylon 5, and then
remain neutral.

Proxima 3 is being patrolled by six of Clark's destroyers, and the civilians
are desperate. Sheridan decides there is no choice but to attack the
destroyers and return control of Proxima 3 to its local government.

Londo visits G'Kar to tell him that his government wants to issue a joint
statement with the Narn government in support of Sheridan, in hopes that it
may convince the other league worlds to do the same. He offers a drink to
share the fact that the Humans have somehow created a bridge between their
races; however, G'Kar does not accept either proposition.

Sheridan joins the White Stars and fighters to begin their attack on Clark's
destroyers. He warns them that they are in violation of the Proxima Treaty
and their attacks are illegal under the Rules of Engagement and the Articles
of War. One of the Earth destroyers fires at a White Star ship barely missing
it, and the battle ensues. The captain of one of the destroyers, the Vesta,
turns out to be an old friend of Sheridan's, Edward MacDougan. Sheridan
announces to the other ships that they will not be considered hostile unless
they lock their weapons systems onto his ships. Just before Sheridan is about
to fire on the Vesta in an act of defense, they declare themselves
non-hostile. Finally, the remaining ships surrender and agree to return
control of Proxima 3 to its local government.

Sheridan calls a meeting with the captains of the four remaining ships. He
offers them three alternatives: they can return home, stay and help protect
Proxima 3, or join the fight against President Clark. The destroyer captains
deliberate and decide that one ship will retire from the field and go in for
repairs, one will stay and help with the defense of Proxima 3, and the
remaining two, including MacDougan's ship, will sign on with Sheridan.

Meanwhile, G'Kar finds Londo, sits down with him to have a drink and tells
him to issue the joint statement.

Garibaldi leaves Babylon 5 and heads to Mars with no plans of returning.

  The Exercise of Vital Powers

Transmission order: No. 416

Production order: No. 416

Garibaldi is back on Mars to his own disbelief, to meet his employer, William
Edgars (guest star EFREM ZIMBALIST, JR.), face to face. Garibaldi doesn't
trust President Clark and thinks he should be stopped, but not by taking
military action like Sheridan. He wants William to stop Sheridan, because the
megacorporations can handle things from the inside, which may prevent Clark
from killing Sheridan once they turn him over.

Back in the Medlab, Franklin continues to work on the unconscious implanted
telepaths per Sheridan's orders. Frustrated that Sheridan is demanding
results faster than he is getting them,, Franklin insists to know why this is
a matter of urgency.

Lyta goes to the lab to look for Zack but before she leaves, she is somehow
able to connect with the patient in the Isolab. The patient miraculously
rises and opens his mouth as if he about to speak, but when her concentration
is broken, the patient falls to the floor. Lyta explains to Franklin, who is
shocked, that when she saw the patient she began hearing the scream that a
Shadow vessel makes when it goes by. She instinctively made it go away, and
that was when the patient awoke. Later, Lyta tries to connect with the
patient again under Franklin's supervision, and the telepath tries to kill
himself. Lyta prevents him from doing so but is very upset by what she
experiences through him.

William contemplates Garibaldi's proposal, but before making any decisions,
he "tests" his trustworthiness by having a telepath do a surface scan. During
this time, Garibaldi admits that he feels telepaths are the biggest problem
in society. William decides to confide in Garibaldi, and reveals that he
thinks Clark is giving power to telepaths in order to institute complete and
total loyalty. He explains that if Sheridan attacks, Clark will turn the Psi
Corps into a thought police force, answerable only to him.

Sheridan checks in with Franklin to see if he's made any progress with the
telepaths, and he finally explains why it is so crucial, leaving Franklin
stunned. Franklin then tells Lyta they must leave for Mars, but he does not
explain why.

Garibaldi admits to Lise (guest star DENISE GENTILE) that he never stopped
loving her Garibaldi then goes to William to tell him he wants to help Clark.
In turn, William tells him to prove it by turning Sheridan in. Garibaldi
resigns himself to this request, realizing that he has to do the right thing,
no matter what that may mean for Sheridan.

  The Face of the Enemy

Transmission order: No. 417

The battle to liberate Earth and her colonies continues. Sheridan's old crew
and ship, Agamemnon, catches up with him and wants to join his plight.

Garibaldi tells William that he has managed to find Sheridan's father, whom
he is now holding in custody, and he'll be contacting Sheridan as soon as
everything is in place. William promises to tell him the whole truth of what
is going on, once Sheridan is out of the way.

Marcus and Lyta make it to Mars along with their cargo -- several telepaths
frozen in cryo tubes still wearing the Shadow implants. When they arrive,
Lyta is not received with open arms by Number One because recently telepaths
were assigned to the military divisions occupying Mars, and anyone suspected
of partaking in the Resistance is scanned, very deeply. A deep scan can cause
heart attacks, seizures and even death. This used to be illegal, and still
is, unless the orders come directly from Earthdome.

Sheridan boards his old ship and while there he receives a transmission from
Garibaldi. He tells Sheridan that Clark's got his father and is trying to use
him to get to Sheridan. He continues that if Sheridan doesn't surrender, they
will kill his father. Sheridan tells Ivanova that he is going to Mars and
wants her to take his place in his absence.

Lyta explains to Franklin that when she interned at the Psi Corps a number of
telepaths were murdered, but no one cared. The Corps decided to take of it
themselves by illegally scanning anyone who may have had a lead. When they
found the perpetrator, they filled his mind with visions of horror and he is
now in an institution. If not for his straight jacket, he would tear his own
eyes out. She also tells Franklin that one day there will be a war between
telepaths and mundanes, and only hopes she is not alive to see it.

Delenn and Lennier return to Babylon 5 in time for Ivanova to update them and
ask Delenn to keep an eye on things while she's gone with the fleet.

Sheridan arrives on Mars and meets Garibaldi. While they are discussing
Sheridan's father, Garibaldi quickly grabs Sheridan's wrist and within
seconds Sheridan is surrounded. He fights but his efforts prove futile, as
Garibaldi watches on.

After Sheridan's capture, Garibaldi goes to William to find out what the rest
of the truth is. William tells him that Clark is not the real threat, rather
it is the telepaths he put in power, the Psi Corps. If information is power,
the telepaths represent the greatest threat to freedom imaginable, and
possible human extinction. He has created a virus that would wipe out all of
the telepaths and has possession of the only antidote to stop it. Also, the
antidote must be taken every two weeks, or infected persons will die.

Sheridan remains locks up in a dark cell on Mars. An official begins
interrogating him, telling Sheridan that his father is still alive and they
will only keep him captive al long as they hold Sheridan. The bottom line is
that Sheridan must confess publicly to a multitude of charges dealing with
his part in the conspiracy to overthrow the government.

The next morning, William (guest star RAYE BIRK) returns and brings with him
a Drazi (guest star WAYNE ALEXANDER) whom Sheridan has never met. However,
the Drazi says he was one of the parties responsible for manipulating
Sheridan into turning against his own government, and that he took part in
the conspiracy to overthrow it. He also lists his co-conspirators as Ivanova,
Delenn, and Senator Ross Fowler. Sheridan pleads with the Drazi to stop
giving in, and when the Drazi ceases to cooperate, they take him outside and
kill him. William tells Sheridan that if he cooperates he will be released
and returned to society, but if he resists he will be punished.

William continues to do what he can to make Sheridan sign the confession, but
he does not budge. William continues that if Sheridan does not confess, and
dies, it is okay, because they have his image on file and can create a false
confession. When he refuses to sign yet again, guards come in and strap him
to a gurney. They take him to another room which seems to have an electric
chair in it. However, upon closer inspection, Sheridan realizes it is the
same interrogation room in which he was first brought. An interrogator comes
in and begins asking him the same questions as when he first arrived -- it is
happening all over again, just like a recurring nightmare.

With the help of a deep scan by Lyta, who is able to break past blocks put in
place by P12 telepaths, Garibaldi has convinced Franklin and the others that
Bester manipulated him into betraying his fellow officers.

Garibaldi, Franklin, and Lyta have freed Sheridan. Londo and G'Kar have
convinced the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to join the fight against Clark
and help Sheridan, who came to their aid against the Shadows. Sheridan's
fleet now contains Narn and Centauri warships,among others.

Not all the so-called defectors to the rebel fleet have really betrayed
Earth; there are some spies who have been feeding information about fleet
movement back to Earth. Earth has been adapting Shadow technology for use in
its own ships. The resulting vessels are capable of putting up a strong fight
against White Star-class ships.

Ivanova was mortally injured during a clash with a fleet of Shadow-enhanced
Earth ships. Minbari physicians estimate she has no more than a week left. At
Ivanova's request, Sheridan has assumed command of the Agamemnon once again.

Sheridan's plan for the frozen telepaths ("Ship of Tears") was to smuggle
them onto as many Earth warships as possible and activate them. The telepaths
would wake up and merge with the ships' computer systems, making the ships
unable to maneuver or attack and thus removing the need for Sheridan's forces
to destroy them. The plan succeeded in disabling the better part of the Earth
fleet at the Mars colony.

Sheridan's forces have arrived at Earth, prompting President Clark to commit
suicide rather than face capture or trial. A member of the Earth Senate,
apparently friendly to Sheridan, has at least temporarily filled in the power
vacuum.

Marcus has used the alien healing machine ("The Quality of Mercy") to give
his life to Ivanova, apparently dying in the process.

In the year 2257 A.D., an immense space station called Babylon 5 floats in a
stationary orbit in a neutral corner of a distant galaxy. Manned by a crew of
peaceful Earthmen and women, Babylon 5 serves as a non-political economic and
social hub for the four alien races - the Narn, Centauri, Vorlon and Minbari
- who fight to control the galaxy.

The alien ambassadors are convening there to negotiate a peace treaty.
Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (MICHAEL O'HARE), Lieutenant Takashima (TAMLYN
TOMITA) and their security chief, Michael Garibaldi (JERRY DOYLE), are
unprepared when the most mysterious of the ambassadors, Kosh Naranek, arrives
two days early. Within minutes, Kosh is found near death in an airlock. The
station's doctor, Benjamin Kyle (JOHNNY SEKKA), determines that Kosh was
poisoned. If Kosh dies, the peace conference will fail.

Kosh had ordered all security cameras to be turned off because his Vorlon
race is very secretive about its appearance. Therefore, no one can identify
the attacker except Kosh himself. Dr. Kyle convinces Lyta Alexander (PATRICIA
TALLMAN), a visiting "telepath" from Earth, to use her mind-reading powers to
scan the dying ambassador's unconscious memory. To everyone's horror, Lyta
reveals that Commander Sinclair greeted Kosh in the airlock.

Garibaldi is suspicious of Lyta's powers and searches the station for
evidence of the attacker. Meanwhile, the council, led by the ambitious alien
ambassador G'Kar (ANDREAS KATSULAS), reluctantly votes to send Sinclair to
Kosh's homeworld for trial.

Garibaldi's technicians soon discover a small alien vehicle attached to the
outside of the space station's hull. They also find the corpse of a worker,
Del Varner (JOHN FLECK), who had smuggled aboard a "changeling net," a device
that completely disguises the wearer to look like anyone he chooses.

As Kosh's warships arrive to arrest Sinclair, the commander tracks down and
kills the shape-shifting alien that used the changeling net to impersonate
him in the airlock. Sinclair learns that to corrupt the balance of power in
the galaxy, G'Kar conspired with another person on Babylon 5 to murder Kosh
and blame the peacekeepers of Babylon 5. Fortunately, Kosh recovers, the
truth is revealed, and G'Kar is appropriately punished.

B5 is now under the command of Captain Elizabeth Lochley, an Earth Force
officer hand-picked by Sheridan for her ability to defuse crises without
resorting to violence, and her ability to fight effectively when required. He
has placed her in charge of all aspects of station operation except political
decisions affecting the Interstellar Alliance.

B5 hasn't rejoined Earth yet. The Alliance is discussing buying it from
Earth. In the meantime it remains an independent state. Sheridan has allowed
a group of rogue human telepaths, led by a man named Byron (whose psi powers
seem to be quite strong) to establish a colony on Babylon 5.

Narns aren't given their adult names at birth; they're given temporary ones
for the first ten years of their lives, after which they're allowed to select
their true names from whatever pantheon they've come to believe in. G'Kar was
no exception.

G'Kar has assembled a declaration of principles for the Alliance. It consists
of the first page of every holy book of every race in the Alliance, a
reminder that the Alliance is a multitude of voices and beliefs, all worthy
of respect. See Analysis) G'Kar continues to write his own book ("Point of No
Return") and has shown it to other Narn and to Garibaldi.

The other Narn have even begun quoting it. Sheridan has named Garibaldi the
head of the Alliance's covert operations division. B5 continues to employ
Narns in its security forces. Sheridan's first assignment in Earthforce was

Ever since he started dreaming of his own death, Londo has felt somehow that

Londo has apologized to G'Kar for all his past misdeeds. It's the first time,

The Centauri have been using telepaths in their military for over 300 years.
At Garibaldi's behest, and with great trepidation, Sheridan has approved the
use of telepaths as intelligence peratives of the Interstellar Alliance.
Byron has agreed to supply Garibaldi with two members of his
group,well-trained telepaths who will ferret out dark secrets wherever they
lie.

For the past 10 years, the Drazi have been secretly supporting raiders who
attack minor worlds on the edge of Drazi space. Byron has uncovered the
secret and brought it to Sheridan's attention, and now the Drazi have most
likely stopped the practice.

Lyta has been in the mind of two people at the moment of death. It's a
tremendously traumatic experience; a telepath actually sees what she believes
is the soul departing, and a little of the telepath's departs as well. She
says Bester has scanned the dying on numerous occasions in an attempt to try
to see what's on the other side -- something she says isn't supposed to be
known by the living -- and his soul has been diminished as a result.

Byron believes that telepaths are superior to mundanes, and feels that
mundanes don't think of telepaths as anything but tools to be used when
needed. Byron's telepaths, if he's to be believed, make no effort to shield
their thoughts from one another. Nor do they make any effort to avoid picking
up the thoughts of others around them, something Byron claims takes a lot of
effort to avoid.

Before the Dilgar War, Franklin's father was captured by one of the factions

Lochley wasn't on Sheridan's side in the civil war, though she may not have
been on Clark's side either. She feels her role as a soldier is to follow
orders until she's given a specific order she finds immoral. As a soldier,
she says, the most important words in her vocabulary are loyalty, duty, and
honor, and turning against the chain of command would mean sacrificing one of
the three, rendering the other two meaningless.

Sheridan and Lochley appear to have had a relationship of some sort in the
past. Several races are now represented in the ranks of Ranger trainees,
including the Pak'ma'ra, who will specialize as couriers and infiltrators
since they're so unpleasant to most other races that everyone goes to great
lengths toignore them.

The two telepaths supplied by Byron to Garibaldi ("The Paragon of Animals")
have begun their training. Lennier, according to one of his instructors, is
pushing himself too hard in his Ranger training, most likely in an attempt to

relationship ended quickly because both of them wanted to be in control all
the time. But it's thanks to their time together that Sheridan knows he can
trust her even though she was on the other side in the civil war.

Lochley was stationed on an outpost on which a rogue telepath murdered two
crewmen. Bester and his people arrived and tracked down the rogue, saving the
lives of additional people under Lochley's command. Many of Byron's people
have been the subjects of Psi Corps medical experiments, and don't trust
doctors.

Lyta appears to have genuinely joined Byron's cause. The two of them appear
to be developing either a close friendship or romantic attraction. G'Kar is
now working as Londo's bodyguard. He accepted the assignment largely to see
the looks on the faces ofthe Centauri royal court when a Narn is present at
important state functions and the like.

Londo is the second Mollari to become Emperor. Londo says his ancestor's life
ended badly. The Centauri Regent's health is failing; Londo will soon spend
much of his time shuttling back and forth between B5 and Centauri Prime.

Franklin has been given a new assignment, to thoroughly catalog any diseases

other forms of humor. Minbari humor, Rebo says, is based on failure to attain
spiritual enlightenment, though puns seem to be effective in Minbari humor as
well.

  In the Kingdom of the Blind

Transmission order: No. 510

Production order: No. 510

Someone is secretly using Centauri war cruisers to stage random attacks on
the cargo vessels of all the Alliance worlds. The Alliance is aware of the
attacks, but doesn't yet know of the Centauri connection. The Centauri Regent
continues to be controlled by his Keeper ("Epiphanies.") He has started
drinking heavily,something he never did in the past, and, like Captain Jack
("Racing Mars") occasionally lets slip that something is wrong, even getting
as far as asking a palace guard to kill him.

The Keeper, in turn, appears to be under the control of as-yet-unidentified
aliens lurking in the shadows on Centauri Prime. The aliens, according to the
Regent, believe they have a lot in common with Londo, and in fact have
already thwarted one attempt to assassinate Londo. They appear to be
telekinetic (though whether by psi or technological means is unclear.)

Byron has attempted to blackmail the Alliance into giving his people a
homeworld by using his people to scan the minds of all the ambassadors,
allegedly gathering a stockpile of sensitive information. His threat to make
all the information public has backfired and erupted into violence at least
once.

Now the Alliance, including Sheridan, is clamoring for Byron's arrest, and
most of his people (including Lyta) have sealed themselves into a small
section of Brown Sector in an attempt to hold out as long as they can and
give cooler heads time to prevail. A militant faction of telepaths has left
the group and promises to take a more active approach, sabotaging station
operations if necessary until the Alliance capitulates.

  A Tragedy of Telepaths

Transmission order: No. 511

Production order: No. 509

Na'Toth was on Narn when the Centauri bombed it ("The Long, Twilight
Struggle.") She was captured by Centauri troops, along with other Narns, and
brought to Centauri Prime to serve as entertainment in the royal palace. When
she proved insufficiently entertaining, she was locked in a cell and
forgotten. Londo and G'Kar have returned her to the care of the Narn, but
G'Kar believes it'll be some time before she recovers from the experience of
being locked in a Centauri prison cell for two years.

The militant faction of Byron's telepaths have obtained weapons and have
staged violent attacks on station personnel. They believe they're doing what
they're doing because it's the only way to protect Byron; he is dismayed that
they're killing in his name.

At Lochley's request, Bester and a team of bloodhound telepaths have come to
the station to take the telepath colonists away. The attacks (presumably
still by Centauri forces) on Alliance ships continue. The attackers have
attempted to up the ante by planting evidence that points to various members
of the Alliance being responsible for the attacks, but Sheridan has so far
managed to keep the member races from attacking one another in revenge.

Sheridan has positioned a fleet of White Stars near a Drazi fleet at the
border of Brakiri space. If the Drazi attack the Brakiri in retaliation for
the apparent Brakiri attacks on Drazi ships, Sheridan says, the White Stars
will retaliate against the Drazi. This gambit is working so far, but both the
Drazi and the Brakiri are furious about what they see as an infringement on
their right to self-defense.

According to reports received by Londo, Centauri weapons manufacturing has
risen 15 percent recently, something counter to normal Centauri peacetime
policy.

  Phoenix Rising

Transmission order: No. 512

Production order: No. 512

Byron grew up in the Corps. He was rated a strong P12, so was inducted into
the Psi Cops and served as Bester's protege. During one mission, Bester
ordered Byron to destroy an unarmed ship full of mundanes who were helping
smuggle telepaths out of Psi Corps' reach. Byron followed the order
reluctantly, but shortly thereafter fled the Corps, convinced that telepaths
could build a society based on nobler principles than violence.

To avoid being taken by the Psi Corps, Byron and the militant faction of the
telepath colonists have killed themselves. The other members of Byron's group
have been allowed to go free, despite Bester's objections. The Psi Corps
headquarters on Earth has been bombed. The bombers haven't been found, but
they did leave the message, "Remember Byron."

During Garibaldi's conditioning, Bester implanted a modified version of one
of Asimov's Laws of Robotics: Garibaldi is incapable of harming Bester, or
through inaction, allowing Bester to come to harm. (See Notes.) As far as
Garibaldi knows, the prohibition doesn't apply to all telepaths, just Bester.
His inability to exact revenge has driven Garibaldi back to drinking (but see
Analysis.)

Lyta's powers include sending her senses far away from her body, scouting
ahead for danger. Bester is able to project himself into someone's mind from
a distance, similar to Byron's projection to Lochley in "No Compromises."

  The Ragged Edge

Transmission order: No. 513

Production order: No. 513

Garibaldi's drinking has begun to seriously impair his ability to do his job,
and although he seems to realize he has a problem, he has so far refused to
mention it to anyone.

While G'Kar was with Londo on Centauri Prime, some Narn broke into his
quarters and stole his book. It has, in under a month, gained great
popularity, and may soon outsell the Book of G'Quon. As a result, many Narn
now consider G'Kar a holy figure, and are gathering on Babylon 5 to hear him
speak.

Franklin has been offered a position in Earthdome, as head of xenobiological
research. The position is currently held by Dr. Benjamin Kyle ("The
Gathering") but Kyle intends to step down at the end of the year. Franklin
will use the position to continue his research on cross-species diseases
("Strange Relations.")

Although Alliance member worlds are officially obliged to boycott certain
products (dust and some other drugs, certain biological weapons, etc.) many
of them simply use smugglers to trade in forbidden goods unofficially.

  The Corps is Mother, The Corps is Father

Transmission order: No. 514

Production order: No. 514

Very high on the Corps' list of priorities is that mundanes believe that
nothing ever goes wrong within the Corps. To that end, and because they
justifiably don't believe mundane security forces would be of much use in
capturing rogue telepaths, they use the Psi Cops to track down rogues with a
minimum of publicity.

The Psi Corps maintains a fleet of large transport ships in hyperspace, where
they're used to ferry shuttles back and forth between jump points. Eventually
they'll be used for some other unspecified purpose. Nobody outside the Corps
is supposed to know the ships exist.

Psi Corps field operatives must be able to maintain a mental block against a
telepathic probe for at least one hour to ensure that they're safe against
attack by untrained rogues. Even the most powerful rogues, according to
Bester, can't sustain a psi attack for more than 30 or 40 minutes.

Bester's parents were killed in an accident when he was barely a month old.
The Corps found him thanks to a random DNA screening, and raised him from
childhood.

The Corps is training some of its members in offensive skills known as "mind
shredding." A P10-rated shredder is a danger even to a P12-rated telepath,
and a P12-rated shredder can kill a mundane telepathically in a matter of
seconds.

If a telepath has multiple personalities, each of the personalities can
exhibit different levels of psi ability. The Corps' screening program doesn't
detect multiple personalities. Even new Corps trainees are willing to act as
judge, jury, and executioner for mundanes who kill telepaths.
