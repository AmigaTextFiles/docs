@Node MAIN "A Guide to the Star Wars Universe - sandcrawler"

* A sandcrawler is a huge, multistoried land vehicle that travels on giant
treads. The @{"Jawas" link SWG:Data/Jawa.GDE/MAIN} of @{"Tatooine" link SWG:Data/Tatooine.GDE/MAIN} live, work, and travel within sandcrawlers.
The interiors, which have been described as warrenlike, are filled with all
of the items the Jawas salvage in their wanderings.
