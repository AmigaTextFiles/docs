@Node MAIN "A Guide to the Star Wars Universe - antigrav drive"

* A starship or speeder propulsion system that works by countering the
normal effects of gravity. An antigrav drive only works when a large gravity
mass is nearby, such as within the gravity well of a planet. The most common
antigrav drive is the repulsorlift engine.
