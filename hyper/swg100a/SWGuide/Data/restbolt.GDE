@Node MAIN "A Guide to the Star Wars Universe - restraining bolt"

* A small, cylindrical device, a restraining bolt fits in a special socket
on the exterior of a @{"droid" link SWG:Data/droid.GDE/MAIN}. When inserted, a restraining bolt keeps a droid
from wandering off, and also forces it to respond immediately to signals
produced by a hand-held summoning device keyed to a specific bolt or series
of bolts.
