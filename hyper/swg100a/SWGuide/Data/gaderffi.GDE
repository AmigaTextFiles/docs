* The traditional weapon of @{"Tatooine" link SWG:Data/Tatooine.GDE/MAIN}'s @{"Sand People" link SWG:Data/SandPeop.GDE/MAIN} (or Tusken Raiders) is
the double-edged gaderffii, or gaffi stick. This deadly, axelike weapon is
fashioned from metal scavenged from wrecked or abandoned vehicles and
spaceships that wind up in the Tatooine wastes.
