* Ishi Tib was one of @{"Jabba the Hutt" link SWG:Data/Jabba.GDE/MAIN}'s alien subordinates. Bipedal, with
bulbous eyes and a beaklike mouth common to his species, Ishi Tib was
slightly more than 1.5 meters tall. While it has not been confirmed, it is
believed that Ishi Tib died with the rest of Jabba's entourage aboard the
crime lord's sail barge.
