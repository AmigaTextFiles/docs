@Node MAIN "A Guide to the Star Wars Universe - consular ship"

* A consular ship is any vessel officially registered to a member of the
@{"Imperial Senate" link SWG:Data/Senate.GDE/MAIN}. When consular ships are on diplomatic missions, they are
immune to the normal mire of spaceport and deep-space inspection. Since the
Senate was disbanded, such courtesies are no longer extended.
