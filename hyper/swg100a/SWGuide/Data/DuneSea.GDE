* The Dune Sea stretches across the @{"Tatooine" link SWG:Data/Tatooine.GDE/MAIN} wastes, a vast desert that
once was a large inland sea. This inhospitable area suffers from extreme
temperature variations and a lack of water. @{"Ben Kenobi" link SWG:Data/BKenobi.GDE/MAIN} lived within the
western portion of the area.
