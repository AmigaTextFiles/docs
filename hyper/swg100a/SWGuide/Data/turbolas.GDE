* A turbolaser fires supercharged bolts of energy, usually from the desk of
a capital ship or a surface-based defense installation. Turbolasers are more
powerful than regular laser cannons, discharging hotter and more
concentrated energy bolts. These weapons require constant temperature
regulation from built-in cryogenic cooling units.
