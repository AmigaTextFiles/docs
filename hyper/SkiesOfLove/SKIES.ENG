Skies of Love ~ Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu
"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu" opening theme (1988)

I look above, the stars are bright
but I'm blinded by your light
Heaven seems so far away
Come back to me some day

The skies seem so blue
they lead me to you
Somewhere there's a dream in my heart
in the skies of love
