%
Q. What was the Atari Lynx?
%
A. The Lynx was the world's first hand-held color video game system.  Sold by
%  Atari, the Lynx offered true multi-player competition, built-in 3D and
%  distortion graphic effects, reversible controls, and fast arcade action.

==============================================================================
%
Q. What was included when you bought a Lynx?
%
A. The Lynx was available in two packages:
%
%  The Lynx "Deluxe Package" included the Lynx unit, a copy of the CALIFORNIA
%  GAMES game card, a carrying case, a ComLynx cable, and six AA Alkaline
%  batteries.  The Lynx "Base Package" came with only the Lynx but no
%  accessories.
%
%  Near the end of the Lynx's retail life, some stores were selling a
%  "maximum" Lynx package, consisting of the Lynx itself and four games.  It
%  was primarily a clearance/liquidation move, and is no longer available.

==============================================================================
%
Q. What happened to Atari, anyway?
%
A. The trials and tribulations of Atari could fill a small book (and, in fact,
%  once did).  To summarize VERY briefly, the history of Atari is as follows:
%
%    1972   Atari Inc. founded by Nolan Bushnell from a $250 investment.
%             Pong arcade game becomes a smash sensation.
%    1976   Atari Inc. sold by Bushnell to Warner Inc. for $28 million.
%    1980   Atari Inc. posts record sales.  $2 billion profits annually.
%             Atari occupies 80 offices in Sunnyvale, CA.
%    1983   Decline of video games and irresponsible spending by Atari Inc.
%             results in record losses ($536 million, up to $2 million daily).
%    1984   Warner divides Atari Inc.  Home division (Atari Corp.) is sold to
%             Jack Tramiel.  Arcade division (Atari Games/Tengen) becomes its
%             own company.
%    1986   Atari Corp. releases Atari ST home computer.
%    1989   Atari Corp. releases Atari Lynx, the world's first color hand-held
%             video game system.
%    1993   Atari Games bought by Time-Warner, became Time-Warner Interactive.
%    1993   Atari Corp. releases Atari Jaguar, the world's first 64-bit home
%             video game system (see the Atari Jaguar FAQ).
%    1996   Time-Warner Interactive (Atari Games) sold to WMS.
%    1996   Atari Corp. announces reverse merger with JTS Corporation.
%    1996   Atari Corp. and JTS connsumate deal on July 31 1996.
%
%  The deal was beneficial to both parties; JTS needed Atari's $50 million
%  to shore up their financial situation, and the Tramiels needed some way to
%  liquidate their SEC Rule 144 holdings in Atari.  The Tramiels are now
%  obligated to find fiances for JTS, and the Atari "profit center" in JTS
%  must continue to do some business to validate the tax loss carryforward.
%  Hence, the name Atari continues to live on for tax purposes, and the odds
%  are very good that the licensing of titles and patents under the Atari name
%  will continue for several years, at least.
%
==============================================================================
%
Q. Who now owns/handles Atari's properties?
%
A. At the time of this writing, Atari Corp.'s licenses and intellectual
%  property are now owned by JTS.  Whether Atari/JTS has plans to license or
%  sell these properties to other companies is unknown.
%
%  CWest has been contacted to sell Atari Jaguar software and hardware.  CWest
%  can be reached via electronic mail at atari@cwest.com, or on their WWW page
%  at http://www.cwest.com/atari/
%
==============================================================================
%
Q. What was the relationship between the Atari Lynx and Epyx?
%
A. The Lynx was originally conceived by Epyx in 1987.  It was called the
   "Handy" at that time.  Two creators of the system, Dave Needle and R.J.
   Mical, were also members of the Amiga design team.  Atari bought the
%  rights, and the rest is history.  Epyx no longer has any connection with
%  the Lynx.

==============================================================================

Q. What are the specifications of the Lynx?

A. Physical dimensions:

       Size: 9.25" x 4.25" x 2" (10.75" x 4.25" x 1.5" for original Lynx)
     Screen: 3.5" diagonal (3.25" x 1.88" approx.)
    Speaker: 2" diameter

    Buttons: Two sets of fire buttons (A and B)
             Two option buttons (OPTION 1 and OPTION 2)
             Pause button
             (OPTION 1 + Pause = Restarts the game
              OPTION 2 + Pause = Flips the screen, which allows the Lynx
              controls to be reversed)
             Power on light (Not on original Lynx; indicates unit is on)
             Power on button
             Power off button
             Backlight button (Not on original Lynx; turns off the screen,
               but does not turn off the game.  This saves electricity use
               when a game is paused)
     Joypad: Eight directional
   Controls: Volume
             Brightness
      Ports: Headphones (mini-DIN 3.5mm stereo; wired for mono on the
               original Lynx)
             ComLynx (multiple unit communications)
             Power (9V DC, 1 A)
             Game card slot
             Battery holder (six AA)

  For the technically minded, the Lynx has two basic chips that form a
  cooperative set of co-processing subsystems that maximize the Lynx's
  performance by sharing the work of executing a game program.  These
  chips are called Mikey and Suzy.

  Mikey (16-bit custom CMOS chip running at 16MHz)
  - MOS 65C02 processor running at up to 4MHz (~3.6MHz average)
      8-bit CPU, 16-bit address space
  - Sound engine
       4 channel sound
       8-bit DAC for each channel
       (4 channels x 8-bits/channel = 32 bits commonly quoted)
       Atari reports the range is "100Hz to above the range of human
         hearing"; spectrum analysis shows the range may go as low as 32Hz.
       Stereo with panning (mono for original Lynx)
  - Video DMA driver for LCD display
      4096 color (12-bit) palette
      16 simultaneous colors (4 bits) from palette at one time
  - System timers
  - Interrupt controller
  - UART (for ComLynx)
  - 512 bytes of bootstrap and game-card loading ROM

  Suzy (16-bit custom CMOS chip running at 16MHz)
  - Blitter (bit-map block transfer) unit
  - Graphics engine
      Hardware drawing support
      Unlimited number of high-speed sprites with collision detection
      Hardware high-speed sprite scaling, distortion, and tilting effects
      Hardware decoding of compressed sprite data
      Hardware clipping and multi-directional scrolling
      Variable frame rate (up to 75 frames/second)
      160 x 102 "triad" standard resolution (16,320 addressable pixels)
      (A triad is three LCD elements: red, green, and blue)
      Capability of 480 x 102 artificially high resolution
  - Math co-processor
      Hardware 16-bit multiply and divide (32-bit answer)
      Parallel processing of single multiply or divide instruction

   The Lynx contains 64K (half a megabit) of 120ns DRAM.  Game-cards
   currently hold 128K (1 megabit) or 256K (2 megabits) of ROM, but there
   is a capability of up to 1 megabyte (8 megabits) on one game-card.  In
   theory, this limit can be exceeded with extra bank-switching hardware in
   the card.  The first few hundred bytes of the game card is encrypted to
   prevent unauthorized developers from writing Lynx software.  This scheme
   was introduced by Epyx as an effort to enforce game quality.

   With alkaline batteries, the reasonable average battery life is 5 hours.
   (4 hours with the original Lynx)  The Lynx can run off rechargeable
   Ni-Cad batteries, but average battery life drops drastically to 1.5 hours
   per recharge (1 hour for the original Lynx).  Your mileage may vary.

==============================================================================
%
Q. What were the differences between the original Lynx ("Lynx Classic") and
%  the later-model Lynx ("Lynx II")?
%
A. The Lynx II is a bit smaller and lighter than the original Lynx.  It had a
   slightly longer battery life, and can also just turn the screen off during
   a game pause to save batteries.  (The original Lynx had a five minute
   auto-power shut-off that would have prevented this from being useful.  It
%  was removed in the Lynx II).  A power LED was added (which also blinks
   when battery power is low), and cartridges are easier to insert.

%  The only differences in a technical sense is that the Lynx II has a more
   efficient internal design, and the headphone jack supports stereo sound.
%  The speaker in the Lynx II is also not as loud as the original Lynx, though
   it's more than adequate for all but the noisiest situations.

%  Also, the Lynx II can experience what is called "blinking pixel syndrome".
   With certain game cards, one pixel on the screen (usually stationary)
   cycles through all the colors very quickly.  It does not affect game play,
   and isn't always noticed unless it's looked for.  It seems to be fixed in
   later Lynxes, making it even less of a factor.

%  The power consumption in the Lynx II is about fifteen percent less than
   that of the original Lynx.  Harry Dodgson (hdodgson@ford.com) shows Classic
   using 343 mA, versus 296 mA for the Lynx II.  Also, about two-thirds of the
   Lynx power use is for the backlight screen alone, as using the Lynx II with
   the backlight off used only 97 mA.  He concludes, "the 'battery life of
   five hours' claim by Atari is realistic."

==============================================================================

Q. Is the Lynx an 8-bit or 16-bit system?

A. If 16-bit refers to the main CPU (such as the Sega Genesis/MegaDrive), then
   the Lynx is an 8-bit system.  If 16-bit refers to the graphics engine
   (such as the NEC TurboDuo/PC-Engine), then the Lynx is a 16-bit system.

==============================================================================

Q. Why does the Lynx use a 6502 and not a 68000?

A. "Some people believe it's less of a processor than the 68000, for example.
   That series of chip was used in the Amiga, but it wouldn't make our machine
   do things any better.  In fact, it would only make the unit larger and more
   expensive.  It's also harder to write 68000 code, so we definitely made the
   right decision."
                                                --R.J. Mical

   "The real answer for the choice for the 6502 vs. 68000 was price.
   Secondary considerations (that did not really enter into the decision
   making process): 68000 code is very fat compared to 6502 code.  An
   application that takes 1K of 6502 code averages 2.5 to 3K of 68000 code.
   The 6502 is very bus-efficient, the 68000 has lots of dead time on the
   bus.  As for it being harder to write 68000 code, that is probably not
   true, and in any case was not part of the reason the decision was made."
                                                --Stephen Landrum

%  Additionally, inside sources at Atari said that one major reason for the
   6502 vs 68000 processor choice was that the 6502 design was available as a
   component that could be plugged into a custom chip design.  This allowed
   engineers to build a chip with a 6502 and other supporting hardware around
%  it all in one package.  It was not until 1993-1994 that Motorola offered
   the 68000 as a design component.

Q. What were the unreleased Lynx games?
%
A: The following games were announced at one time or another as being planned
%  for the Lynx.  With the dissolution of Atari, the chances are very slim
%  that any of these games will ever be produced or released.  However, a few
%  enterprising companies and individuals have considered plans to either
%  finish their Lynx titles for release, to sell finished-but-unreleased
%  games, or to produce new games on their own.

Q. Was there a TV tuner option for the Lynx?
%
A. No.  Atari's official position was that market research showed that a TV
   tuner, while a neat idea, would not be bought by most players.  The
   unofficial word from Stephen Landrum is that the Lynx screen display is not
   capable of handling a broadcast television picture.

==============================================================================

Q. What can I use to carry my Lynx game cards?

A. A cheap and easy solution is the plastic cases used to hold trading cards.
   They're transparent, sturdy, and lock shut when closed.  Most hobby and
   comic book stores will sell them; a large case costs $0.50 to $1.00, and
   can hold up to 14 Lynx cards.

   Another solution are Lynx card wallets.  Sold by Hardysoft, a wallet costs
   $7.50 each, or you can buy three for $20.  Each wallet holds 9 cards
   firmly.  To order, write to:

   For Lynx owners who don't care about brand names, a Gameboy plastic
   cartridge case holds two Lynx cards easily.  The cases can be bought from
   Nintendo at 800-255-3700, part number 21648.

==============================================================================

Q. What does "ComLynx" mean, exactly?

A. Some Lynx games allow multiple players to play together simultaneously.
   This works when each player has a Lynx game machine, and all of the
   machines are connected to each other via cables.  The connection is the
   ComLynx port, and the cables are ComLynx cables.  Games that support this
   mutiplayer simultaneous play are usually identified by the phrase "1 to N
   players Lynx up" on the box, the instruction manual, and/or the game card.

==============================================================================

Q. Do all players "Lynxed up" via the ComLynx need a copy of the game being
   played?

A. Yes.  All players need a copy of the game card.

==============================================================================

Q. What's the ComLynx port like?

A. There is a limit of 18 players via ComLynx.  In practice it may be possible
   to connect more units together, but to operate within specifications, the
   drivers in the Lynx cannot drive over more than 17 units with pull-ups on
%  the serial ports.  It's easier for the Lynx to manage fewer players,
%  however, since each Lynx has to track all of the others, and having more
%  players means more data must be exchanged (growth is exponential).  Also,
%  tracking more than 8 players requires an extra byte to encode the Lynx unit
%  number with each data packet.

   ComLynx runs from 300.5 to 62.5K baud.  It works on a "listen and send"
   structure.  Data transmission between Lynxes is done in the background,
   freeing up the CPU to run the game instead of communicating.  It's called
   "RedEye" in-house at Atari, named after an early idea of having Lynxes
   communicate with infra-red transmissions.

   It uses a three-wire cable (+5V/Ground/Data) and allows for bi-directional
   serial communications.  The system frames messages in terms of 11-bit
   words, each consisting of a start bit, eight data bits, a parity bit, and a
   stop bit.  The ComLynx port is used solely for communications; it can't be
   used to control other aspects of the Lynx, though in theory it can be used
   to send signals to external devices.

==============================================================================

Q. Sometimes a multiplayer ComLynx game will freeze up.  Why?

A. A ComLynxed game will freeze if communication between the Lynxes is
   interrupted.  If communications can be restored, the game will continue.
   The most common cause of this problem is a fray in one of the ComLynx
   cables, or a loose seating in one of the ComLynx jacks.  Communication is
   broken, and the game "freezes".  Jiggling the cable or reseating the jacks
   may fix the solution temporarily, but the best cure is a new cable.

==============================================================================
%
Q. I hear there was a ComLynx port on the Atari Jaguar.  How did that work?
%  Could I connect my Lynx to it?  Was there a Lynx adaptor for the Jaguar?
%
A. The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
%  on the system bus.  An expansion port add-on would have made the port
%  available, and developers had announced plans for such accessories.  It is
%  possible to daisy-chain multiple Jaguars for multiplayer games into a
%  "Jaguar network".  In theory, it would have also been possible to connect
%  Jaguars and Lynxes, though no plans for cross-system software were ever
%  finalized.
%
%  There was also talk that the Jaguar's ComLynx signal could allow Lynxes to
%  be used as peripherals: software could have been developed to allow Lynxes
%  to be part of a Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.  Again, no actual plans
%  were ever announced.
%
%  An adaptor to allow the Jaguar to play Lynx games was never planned.

==============================================================================

Q. My Lynx screen is badly scratched!  How can I fix it, what can I do?

A. Get some "plastic scratch remover" or "plexiglass scratch remover".  You
   can find it in hardware stores, or look in your Yellow Pages under
   "Plastics."

==============================================================================
%
Q. Agh! My Lynx is broken! How can I fix it?
%
A. Unforutnately, with the dissolution of Atari Corp., repair or replacement
%  of broken Lynxes is no longer available.

==============================================================================

Q. How do I disassemble my Lynx II (assuming I want to)?

A. The original Lynxes were easy to take apart, for whatever reason you
   needed.  The new Lynx IIs were more puzzling, but not impossible.  The
   following set of (edited) instructions are provided by Ken Small
   (kens@umich.edu):

                                    * * *

   "It's not hard, but there are a lot of fragile pieces and the electronics
   are sensitive to all the things that electronics are usually sensitive to,
   like static.  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

   "First, remove the rubber pads from the bottom of the Lynx.  They're glued
   on, but they peel off pretty easily.  Beneath them are screw holes --
   remove them.  Note that it's *very* easy to tell if your lynx has been
   opened, since you leave holes in the glue stuff.  Take off the back of the
   case.

   "Remove the screw located inside the battery area.  Be careful when
   replacing this; it can strip easily.  Mine is stripped, but the rest of the
   case holds the battery bay in place.  Remove the battery bay piece.

   "You will see a circuit board with a couple of wires and circuit ribbons
   attached to it.  Carefully unplug all of these.  The ribbon in particular
   seems flimsy.  Do not puncture or otherwise damage it.  Remove the circuit
   board.

   "Beneath the circuit board is an assembly screwed to the inside of the
   case, which contains the screen, button contacts and buttons.  A warning
   when unscrewing this-- the are LOTS of small pieces in here, and they're
   particular about how they go back in.  In particular, be careful about the
   A/B buttons, which are slightly different sizes, and the rubber mat around
   the LCD screen, which has nothing to hold it in place.  (NOTE: Also, there
   are contacts on the circuit board hooked up to the high-voltage supply for
   the backlight. They won't do any damage, but can give a mild shock.)

   "The last thing is the joypad contact itself.  This is a small rubber mat
   held in place by a snap-on piece of plastic.  You can carefully remove the
   plastic to get under the apron, where the contacts can be cleaned.  Clean
   in-between the contacts, being careful not to abrase the contacts
   themselves.  They look like half-circles with a small (half-millimeter or
   less) space between.  Grunge between them can register an intermittent
   false contact, which looks to the player like the joypad is being quickly,
   repeatedly pressed in one direction."
