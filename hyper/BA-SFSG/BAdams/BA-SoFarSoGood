So Far So Good


1.  Summer Of '69

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jodie got married
Should have known we'd never get far
When I look back now
The summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah I'll always be there
Those were the best days of my life

Aint no use in complainin'
When y' got a job to do
Spend my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you yeah
Standin' on ya mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh when y' hold my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

[Oh Yeah] Back in the summer of '69 [Oh]

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless-we needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever [Forever...No...Yeah]

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that ol' six string
I think about you and what went wrong
Standin' on ya mama's porch
You told me that it last's forever
Oh when y' held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

[Oh yeah] Back in the summer of '69 [Oh]
It was the summer of '69 [Oh yeah]
Me and my baby in '69 [Oh]
It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69


2.  Straight from the Heart

I could start dreaming but it never ends
As long as you go on we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin' - Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but whose to say
That we'll be able to keep it this way
But it's easier - Comin' straight from the heart

Oh give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - As long as I know 
It's comin' straight from the heart

I see you on the streets some of the time
And all our words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin - Straight from the heart

Oh give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - As long as I know 
It's comin' straight from the heart

[Dont ever leave me darlin']

Oh - straight from the heart                        }
Tell me we can make one more start            }   X 2
You know I'll never go - As long as I know  }   
        Y' give it to me now                            }
 (To replace 4th line on the second time:-
        It's comin' straight from the heart    )

Give it to me [Oh no, Oh no]
Straight from the heart
You know I'll never go - As long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

Whisper words, of desire

Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you
How good we are together

6.  This Time

I think about her all the time
She's my fantasy
An image burning in my mind
Callin' out to me
While my imagination's runnin' wild
Yeah - Things are gettin' clearer
Oh

This time - Everything is all right
No way - She's gonna get away
This time - Everything is easy
Any day - I'm gonna make her mine

Give or take a few
But she turns and slowly walks away
What do I have to do
Hey turn up your radio
Oh - there's somethin' I want you to know

No way - She's gonna get away
This time - Everything is easy

7.  Run To You

She says her love for me could never die
But that'll change if she ever found out about you and I

Wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know coz
When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
Coz when the feelin's right
I'm gonna run all night

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now - You keep me comin' back for more

Baby y' all that I want

That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
Yeah it cuts like a knife
Oh but it feels so right

There's times I've been mistaken
There's times I thought I been mis-understood
Oh yeah

Now you've thrown it all away

10. (Everything I Do) I Do It For You

Look into my eyes
And you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart
Search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more
Don't tell me, it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me, it's not worth dyin' for
Y' know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you

Look into your heart
And you will find
There's nothing there to hide
Well take me as I am, take my life
I will give it up, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me, it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
Y' know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you
[Oh Yeah]

There's no love - like your love
And no other - could give more love
There's no way - unless your there
All the time, all the way, yeah

[Listen to your heart baby]

Oh, you can't tell me, it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
Yeah would fight for you
I'd lie for you
Walk the wild for you
Yeah I'd die for you

You know it's true
Everything I do - oo - I do it for you

---The following are background words for the end---
Everything I do...I will see it through...I will see it 
through...oh yeah...yeah...listen to your heart...you can't 
tell me what I'd die for...oh yeah...I'd be there...


11. Somebody

I been lookin' for someone
T'ween the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin' - to ease the pain
Now who can we turn to
When it's all black and white
And the winners are losers - we see 'em every night
Oh Yeah

I need sombody - Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody - Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody

When your out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
Doesn't take long to realise - it 'aint worth fightin' for
I thought I saw the right time
When you walked in the room
When your eyes were like diamons
And they cut right through, oh, they cut right through 

I need sombody - Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody - Oh yeah
I need somebody - Hey what about you
We all need somebody - Hey

Yeah
Another night, another lesson learned
It's the distance keeps us sane
When the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again
Oh yeah

I need somebody - Somebody like you         }
Everybody needs somebody - Oh yeah          }   Repeat
I need somebody - Oh(Yeah) what about you   }    To
Everybody(We all) need somebody - Hey       }  Infinity


12. Kids Wanna Rock

Turn down the radio
Soundin' like a disco
Must've turned the dial for a couple of miles
But I couldn't find the rock 'n' roll
Just the penalised crap 'anit killin' me off
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock

Run down the airway
Talkin' 'bout the new ways
For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut
'N' waste your life away
Around the world - not around the block
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock
[Yeah]

Killin' our DJ
I can't stand what he's gotta play
I wanna hear it anyway
Turn it up - Turn it up
[Yeah...Oh]

Kick down the baracades
Listen what the kids say
From time to time people change their minds
The music is here t' stay
I've seen it all from the bottom to the top
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock
Around the world - not around the block
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock


13. Heat Of The Night

I was caught in the crossfire
Of a silent scream
One mans nightmare
Is another mans dream
Pull the covers up high
And pray for the mornin' light

Cause your livin' alone - In the heat of the night

Met a man with a message
From the other side
Couldn't take the pressure
Had to leave it be-hind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight
[Yeah that's right]

Better leave it alone - In the heat of the night

In the heat of the night
They'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers
They'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
Where ya gonna hide when it all comes down?
Don't look back - Don't ever turn around

Had to pay the piper
Had to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday
Said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low
You'll know when the time is right
[Yeah]

When you're lyin' alone - In the heat of the night

In the heat of the night
They'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers
They'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
Where ya gonna hide when it all comes down?
Don't look back - Don't ever turn around


14. Please Forgive Me

Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss
It's gettin' better baby
No-one can bear this
Still holdin' on - you're still the one
First time our eyes met
Same feelin' I get
Only feels much stronger
I wanna love you longer
You still turn the fire on

So if you're feelin lonely don't
You're the only one, I ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love ya, a little, more than I show
Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - I need ya like I do
Please belive every word I say is true
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you

Still feels like our best time t-together
Feels like the first touch
We're still gettin' closer baby
Can't get close enough
Still holdin' on - Y' still number one
I remember the smell of your skin
I remember everythin'
I remember all your moves
I remember you yeah
I remember the nights, ya know I still do

So if you're feelin lonely don't
You're the only one, I ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love ya, a little, more than I show

Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - If need ya like I do

The one thing I'm sure of
Is the way we make love
The one thing I depend on

With every right and every breath I'm prayin'
That's why I'm sayin'

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - I need ya like I do
Babe belive every word I say is true

Oh belive me - I don't know what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
