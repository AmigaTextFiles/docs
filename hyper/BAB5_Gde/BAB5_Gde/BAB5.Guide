 @{b}The Gathering [#P]@{ub} (1993)
 
 Ambassador Kosh of the Vorlon Empire arrives early and a welcoming committee
 is hastily arranged, but Sinclair is delayed in getting to the docking bay. By

 Telepath Lyta Alexander is persuaded to scan Kosh, and determines that Kosh
 was poisoned by Commander Sinclair. Sinclair is relieved of command, and a
 meeting of the Babylon 5 Advisory Council is called to determine whether he
 should face trial. They vote that he should be tried on the Vorlon Homeworld.

 may be a "sleeper" spy within his crew. She claims that the spy has been
 implanted by the Psi Corps, with an alternative personality that can be
 activated with a telepathic password. Ivanova objects to the Captains request
 to let Lyta scan her, and reveals a well hidden secret about herself.

 returning 1700 years after his reported death. When Dr. Franklin examines
 Arthur's DNA he discovers the truth behind his terrifying past. Meanwhile,
 Sheridan asks the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to help protect the Station,
 and Garibaldi tries to retrieve a package that is being held back until he

 Bester returns to the station, but this time to inform the Captain that a
 shipment of weapons is being moved through hyperspace heading for the Shadows.
 When the White Star manages to retrieve the cargo ship, the crew make a
 terrifying discovery in the form of 1000s of cryogenically frozen telepaths
 destined for Shadow space. G'Kar's recent pressure finally pays off as he is
 accepted as part of the Conspiracy of Light, and Garibaldi thinks he may have
 a weapon to use against the Shadows.

 Many of the Non-Aligned Worlds are now asking for help but are questioning
 Sheridan's ability to stop the Shadows. The Captain asks Kosh for the Vorlons
 support in stopping the slaughter of many races. Morden begins to make threats

 aggressive behaviour starts to show though as his growing addiction to Stims

 When Sinclair receives a message sent to him by Valen, he returns to Babylon

 from destruction by the Shadows. Sinclair joins forces with Sheridan, Delenn,

 to save Babylon 4 from a Shadow attack. To fail would mean the Shadows would
 exit the war 1000 years ago even stronger than they currently are and would

 @{b}Epiphanies [#73]@{ub} (1996)
 
 The Shadow war is over, the threat of galactic damnation is gone, as are the
 Vorlons and their cynical manipulations of the younger races. The Alliance now
 faces an even greater task, fight the Earth Government and reclaim its
 territory planet by planet, all the way back to Earth. This time humans will
 die on both sides.
 
 The arrival of Bester on Babylon 5, a key Earth hatchet man, does not bode
 well. But Bester wants to cut a deal, in exchange for information of an Earth
 ambush that will be blamed on Babylon 5, he wants to go to Z'Ha'Dum and access
 the forbidden technology of the Shadows. But as Kosh once said, "If you go to
 Z'Ha'Dum, you will die..."

 @{b}The Illusion Of Truth [#74]@{ub} (1996)
 
 Captain Sheridan has always known that ISN, the Interstellar News Network, is
 the corrupt mouthpiece of the evil Earth Government, but when an ISN reporter
 turns up at the station to make a "fair" broadcast about Babylon 5, Sheridan
 foolishly relents. The broadcast turns out to be a pathetic travesty,
 portraying Babylon 5 as a place where humans are the subject of cruel and
 terrifying experiments and suffer terrible deprivations. If this was not bad
 enough, Sheridan's father has gone missing.

 When Delenn is summoned back to Minbar to justify her relationship with
 Sheridan, she is placed into a dream state in which disturbing revelations are
 made about her, and the entire Minbari race. It was she that cast the deciding
 vote to wage war on Earth, a war in which millions from both sides died.
 
 Meanwhile, Captain Sheridan takes the fight back to Earth when he despatches
 Franklin and Marcus to Mars to link up with the Martian resistance. The
 beginning of the end is in sight for the corrupt and fascist Earth Government.
