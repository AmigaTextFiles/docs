Dear Shareware author,

     I have posted this rather long text in the hope that we can get some
feedback from you. Please give this idea a fair reading and let us know what
your thoughts on it are, good or bad. This is exactly how the F1 Licenceware
scheme started and we intend to make the F1 Shareware scheme even more
successful, it all depends on people like yourself.

                           The F1 Shareware Scheme

YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY READING THIS TEXT, IT IS NOT A GIMMICK, IT IS
A SERIOUS BUSINESS PROPOSITION OPEN TO ALL SHAREWARE AUTHORS AND BEST OF
ALL, IT WON'T COST YOU ANY MONEY, IN FACT IT WILL MAKE YOU MONEY.

This is only a first draft (beta to you lot) for the scheme, and everything
here is open to suggestions/constructive criticism/ideas/refinements etc.
Nothing much is set in stone. We are trying to create a scheme that
will benefit:

i)   Shareware programmers
ii)  Shareware customers
iii) F1 Shareware (i.e. create a useful service and make a few bob)
iiii)Enhance the Shareware image in general as we believe the future
     of decent Amiga software will be just Licenceware and Shareware
     and we intend to be there, big time.

If you think any part of this scheme is unfair or crap or just a bad idea 
then don't go around slagging it off, let me know and I will do my best to
fix it. It is important that programmers are happy with the running of the
scheme, as this alone will ensure its success.
  
General concept
---------------

* Shareware programmers send in their program(s) for free evaluation to F1.
  (please send in now)
  We are going to create a scheme that only contains high quality programs
  which will be a selling point in itself.

* If accepted, you (the programmer) can supply us with custom printed labels
  so you can track sales from the amount of labels we use, this is not a
  perfect solution, but you will have to trust us on this one. Anyone who
  knows how F1 works will already know we are rock solid on royalty payments
  we have been paying out royalties for three years now and have never been
  late or given anyone cause for alarm/dissatisfaction or suspicion.

  You supplying the labels is optional, if you can't or don't want to we
  will use the F1 Software label for you (probably free of charge? We will
  have to see how the costings go)

* If your program has a printed manual, you will have to supply us with
  a bundle of them, this is a good way also to track your sales.
  If you want us to reproduce your manual from one you send us this may be
  possible, we will have to take each case individually. If we are printing
  the manual for you, there will be a small charge from your royalty of
  course. You will be told at what price.

  We are considering some form of guarantee where if sales are low and we
  have printed manuals for you you will NOT lose money if your income
  does not exceed that of the printing costs.

* Money from your sales will be paid once a quarter (every three months)
  at the same time as all F1 royalties are paid, there are set months for
  this to keep life at F1 simple. The months are:

  March, June, September, December.

  Payment is sent during the first few days of the month , usually the 2nd
  or thereabouts with a statement of your sales.

  At the moment we only pay foreign programmers on a UK cheque in Sterling,
  we are looking into ways of sending cash abroad with little or no charges
  at either end.

  There will be a minimum cash sum that we pay out, this will be £25.
  If your programs sales are less than £25 then we will hold the money over
  until the next quarter or until £25 is reached. This should be unusual
  in most cases, but we have to keep our bank charges down. For a nominal
  fee (probably £1 taken off your royalty) you can claim your cash if you
  really need it, but not early, we are strict on that as it causes chaos.
  

* Unlike our Licenceware scheme, we do NOT expect to have exclusive
  distribution rights. In other words you can continue selling your program 
  as well, and in other outlets if you wish too.

  You keep all copyrights to your program of course.
  You can withdraw your program from F1 Shareware at any time, giving two
  months notice, this is needed to halt any possible advertising, let us fill
  any orders and to give your customers one last chance to buy.
  Not only that it's the decent thing to do.
  
  If for some reason F1 wants to stop selling your program we will afford
  you this same courtesy.

  There will be no contract, just terms and conditions which will be laid
  out in this document and revised from time to time, as any contract will 
  be fairly useless anyway due to the international flavour of this scheme.
 
* We have no discrimination against any PROGRAMMING languages, though we will
  NOT accept programs written with SEUCK or The 3D Construction Kit for
  obvious reasons.

* We will NOT accept pornography or anything likely to offend.

* We will consider any type of program util/game/tutor etc.

* Pricing, this is up to you. Tell us what price you want for your program
  and we may advise you raise or lower it, but ultimately it is up to you.
  F1 has enough experience with pricing to know a good and bad price and you
  would be wise to consider our suggestion though.

* Updates, you can send in new versions as much as you like and we
  will update your master disk free of charge. Though adding an additional
  disk or more to your program would mean a re-adjustment to the
  selling price to compensate for the extra costs involved on each sale.



             What do you, as a programmer get out of the scheme?
             ----------------------------------------------------

* Marketing 
-----------
ADVERTISING: A percentage (tba) of profits from Shareware sales will go
toward advertising in the UK Amiga magazines and maybe other Euro mags.
This won't happen at first though as we will have start-up costs and need
to retrieve this first.

MAGAZINE REVIEWS: F1 has many contacts within the Amiga mags and a proven
track record of getting a high hit ratio. We have secured nearly 200
reviews in UK mags in the last three years. Reviews are an essential
ingredient to your products awareness.

NEWS PLUGS: Another form of free advertising that we can get you. We know
the tricks of the trade and you can benefit from the F1 name.

F1 DISTRIBUTERS: We are not sure here wether to ask our Licenceware
distributers to sell your programs too. The problem here is they will want a
large cut of the profits to make it worth their while advertising your
product. Of course you can easily account for all this by ADDING our fee
to the price you are asking for your software, so in fact you get all our
services free, in a way. Let me know what you think about the F1
distributers idea, they will help sales but reduce profits. It's 6 of one
half a dozen of the other!

DISTRIBUTION: Your demo version, that you must supply us with of course,
will be uploaded to the Aminet and other distribution sites (suggestions
please) The demo will also be passed to all our distributers, which between
them have the UK market virtually sewn up. They include 17 Bit Software,
Active Software, Seasoft Computing, Saddletramps PD, Exclusive PD and
others. We MAY also upload to PD bulletin boards. Demos and or flyers will 
also be sent to customers on the F1 database that may have an obvious 
interest in your program. For example if your program was a brilliant game
creation system we would contact all our customers that bought Grac from us.
(Graphical Adventure Creator) and there are a LOT of them, we have thousands
of Amiga customers on our list just waiting to buy quality software.

THE F1 CATALOGUE: The F1 Licenceware catalogue is sent out FREE OF CHARGE
to hundreds of customers all over the world every month, your programs will
be listed in there in a special section.


* The work:
----------- 
We will do all the copying, labelling, packing and sending of your product.
We will deal with customer inquiries to a point, things like faulty disks, 
or getting a beginner started with loading, installing problems BUT you
**MUST** offer technical help to your customers by putting your postal
address or phone or e-mail address in the program/docs somewhere and offer
support. It is obvious that F1 cannot know every program we sell inside out
but we do familiarize ourselves the best we can. If you make your program 
easy and friendly to use and as bug free as possible you won't get many 
people contacting you anyway.


* Other benefits:
-----------------
Your program will gain instant respect by being attached to the F1 name.
This is not an idle boast, we have spent 3 years building a solid reputation
of quality and trust with our customers, programmers and the Amiga press.
In other words people WILL take notice of your program, simply because F1
are selling it for you.

We can accept credit card orders on your behalf. This will be a MAJOR 
advantage to most of you. How many Shareware programmers do you know that can
accept credit card orders? Around 70% of all mail order goods are bought by
credit card, some people refuse to pay by anything else because with a
credit card they can't lose their money, in the event of the customer being
ripped off the credit card company refunds them and so this is insurance for
the customer. There is no doubt about it, you will lose sales if you can't 
take credit cards.

We only use high quality branded disks (usually TDK coloured or FUJI)
which from customer feedback we know is appreciated. This also reduces
customer frustration with r/r errors.

The whole system will not cost you anything, we do NOT request any money
from you at any stage. If there are costs to be met, like printed manuals
for example, we will pay it and wait for your royalty to pay us back.
YOU WILL NEVER GET A BILL FROM US FOR MONEY.

You won't have to purchase floppy disks, jiffy bags, postage stamps or cash
cheques (well, one every  quarter) which all costs money.

You won't have to copy all those disks, address all those jiffies and 
go to the Post Office. Which means you are free to program your next
production or continue work on the next version of your program.
 

                             Down to brass tacks:
                             --------------------

Here is an example of an imaginary title.

* Invaders from Venus (Shoot-Em-Up game) on 1 disk.

* Author supplies labels and manual

* Author sets price at £5 per copy.

* Our costs are around £5 to initiate the title in to the scheme, this
  covers sending out of reviews, demos, uploading, and a little toward
  future adverts. Don't forget about things like postage costs, jiffy bags
  our time etc. It all adds up

* On a single sale we will have the following costs:

 disk         25p (high quality branded disks used)

 jiffy        10p 

 labour costs 50p (copying/packing/posting time/wear&tear of equipment etc.)  

 postage stamp25p (will be more for overseas, but 25p will do)

 credit card  36p (credit card company charges 5% on each order)
 or bank           banking charges are more, to cash a cheque can cost 72p,
 charge            so middle ground selected) 
 
TOTAL COST BEFORE ANY PROFIT  ON A SINGLE SALE=£1.46 Round that up to £1.50.


*****PLEASE REMEMBER THE ABOVE COSTS WOULD APPLY TO YOU IF YOU WERE*********
                      SELLING YOUR PROGRAM

We are in business to make a profit so we will want at least £1 profit from 
a single disk sale. Income tax is approx. 20% of our profits so we must take
another £1.20.

TOTAL COST NOW= £2.70.

We would advise the programmer to charge £7.50 for his game. 
That way he would STILL GET HIS £5.00 (bar 20p) from us for every copy we 
sold for him.
The above is just to give you a general idea of what we have in mind.
I think the scheme is unbeatable and I am surprised nobody else has done
this on the Amiga in a big way. I know there are a few but they just sell 
one or two programs, we intend to sell lots of high quality full Shareware
titles and because they will all be good they will compliment each other and
generate interest in other programs in the scheme, they will feed off each
other. Just imagine for example if the scheme had such top titles as Virus
Checker, MUI, Magic Workbench, Edword and other similar titles, wouldn't you
want to get your program in amongst them? I know I would.


I will be e-mailing this text to a lot of Shareware authors over the coming
weeks and we will be getting a mention for the scheme in a few of the UK mags
so keep an eye out. Please help the scheme by spreading this text to
everyone you know.


Please send in your comments/ideas/enquiries and or evaluation copies now
and we will get in touch very soon.

We hope to start the scheme proper in August 96 sometime so get a move on
and you could be one of the first to be in on the biggest shake up in
Shareware history on the Amiga.  

               YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN
