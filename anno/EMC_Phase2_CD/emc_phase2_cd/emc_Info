                         ------ the book ------



The emc.INFO typeface book is a hard backed A5 ringbound binder, containing
approx. 100 pages. These 100 pages contain examples, in alphabetical order, of
every font (apart from IFF and clipfonts) contained on the EMC Phase 1, 2 and 3
CD's along with full details of the format that each font is available in and
details of where the fonts are located on each CD.


emc.INFO is initially supplied 1/3 full. The reason for this is so the binder
will also accommodate future update pages for the forthcoming EMC CD releases as
and when they become available. At the end of the day purchasers of EMC.INFO will
have one book containing the complete information set on all of the EMC CDs


The price is £9.99 including UK postage. For European orders please add £5.00
and Rest of World add £7.00 for first class recorded airmal.
