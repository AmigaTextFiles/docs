  VIScorp IRC Transcript
  
   
   [INLINE] 6/3/96 - The following is a transcript of a recent IRC
   conference held with Carl Sassenrath of VIScorp. Also answering some
   questions is Andy Finkel.
   
   Q. What is VIScorp's position on the sudden multiple OS problem? If
   there are other wanting to make OS's compatible to whatever the
   official one is, is there going to be standards so we don't get broken
   into smaller groups of users?
   A. Actually, we are close to a solution on that. But cannot say
   anymore right now.
   
   Q. Will new OS (4.0?) have FULL memory protection? It will be make it
   compatible with 680x0 apps. And what about resource-tracking? And,
   after all, will you manage the OS port/development?
   A. Ah, starting with one of the most difficult questions. Yes, and no.
   I think it is likely that there would be two types of memory operation
   running concurrently. Tasks running as threads within a larger address
   space... ie, virtual Amiga mode. And, full, new-style tasks
   (super-tasks) that have their own address space. Resource tracking is
   another issue. It's kind of like why Exceptions in Exec had
   difficulty. The problem is.... What happens when you blow out in
   system code. Who will free your blitter lock, etc. But these are
   solvable problems by a lot of you younger gurus out there. So far as
   my involvement is concerned: Yes, I plan on taking an active role. But
   I am an architect and designer, no longer have time for coding....
   even thought I find it to be an important part of the process. When
   you build something, you often don't get the insight unless you are
   down in the trenches. But on the other hand, I've seen just about
   everything that can be done in programming several times over.... And
   I have not seen much new. Anyway, Yes, I will be involved to a degree.
   
   Q. Hello. Why don't Viscorp don't simply ask amiga community to
   actually build future OS, in a very coordinated manner. In fact most
   of amiga users BUILT current OS look and feel and have the capability
   and knowledge of what Amiga OS should become.
   A. You are reading my mind. I originally thought that VIScorp should
   release the source code to the net and use a linx style of R and D. I
   like the idea because it lets motivated people makes and fixes without
   waiting for us. Was a problem for VIScorp though. They thought that
   would be giving away the shop. But, there is a way to make it work,
   even without doing that. So, yes, I plan on it!
   
   Q. How will VIScorp stop the immense flee of developers from Amiga to
   PC/BeBox which is going on right now?
   A. Honestly, only by making the Amiga better. Soon.
   
   Q. Will VISCorp make/support the AGAExtender?
   A. AGAExtender.... that is a good question for Don, who has left.
   
   Q. Hi Carl...How do VIScorp hope to a) Bring back ex-Amiga developers
   and b) Convince the few remaining developers to stay? which has just
   been asked...*doh*
   A. Hang. Chairman of the Board of Viscorp is on the phone. Still on
   phone. Sorry for the delay. Ok, back now. That was a call from Jerry
   Greenberg, co-founder and chairman of VIScorp. (So he gets priority on
   the channel).
   
   Q. Hi Carl. What will be the main improvements in the next release of
   the OS?
   A. Phone. Hang. Andy Finkel this time.
   
   Q. advise them to buy an A1200 with the Surfer kit and get their asses
   online)
   A. I'll ask Andy if he wants to join the channel. (Talking about Amiga
   Technologies) Andy is writing down the irc channel info. (We'll need
   to make room for him) Sorry. But, perhaps we can open it up for a few
   minutes until I'm off the phone. Need to take this call from Andy! The
   idea behind new OS developments is NOT TO FRAGMENT the Amiga world any
   more than it already is. Can we give voice to afinkel? Ok, off the
   phone. And, I've taken that line off hook.
   
   Q. Will VIScorp define a decent standard (OS, CPU, bus) for the clone
   makers (Phase5, PIOS, etc.) since VIScorp itself seems not to be
   interested in building a PPC Amiga? And how long will take this
   approx. (we are waiting too long already)?
   A. Yes. We will coordinate the standard, but not define it. In other
   words, much of this will be up to you. Yes, you have been waiting much
   too long. I've found that there are a lot of very qualified developers
   out there that are willing to help.
   
   Q. this question is mainly for Andy ... according to Phase5, the main
   reason they broke with AT is because you stalled the changes they
   needed for their compiler!?
   A. Interesting. No, what I said was that I felt reserving 16+
   registers for the 68K emulation was the wrong approach... Motorola
   agreed with me. I felt that compromising the native PPC that badly
   would be a mistake in the longer run. So I wouldn't make Motorola
   change the compiler that way.
   
   Q. What of the following can you promise for me: power, decent
   multiuser, autodocs avail like unix manual pages, some killer software
   that sells, good networking as standard ?
   A. Ah, promises. Well... Power: yes. That has to happen. Multuser:
   hmmm. Autodocs online: YES! and linked. Killer Software: that's your
   part. Good networking built in: happening as we talk.
   
   Q. Is there a plan for 2-byte character support (e.g. kanji)? Also,
   will CAOS return?)
   A. As far as I know, there is work for 2-byte chars. Andy might know
   more, Andy? Regarding CAOS, even it has gained a few gray hairs. I've
   had many more ideas since CAOS.... that would make CAOS look like
   MSDOS. ;)
   
   Q. Compatibility with other platforms will be essential in the future.
   Are you going to introduce, for example, Windows NT or some other OS
   running beside the Amiga OS? If so, tell us a little about this. Also,
   are you planning to support the users in any way by user's groups,
   helplines etc.?
   A. Are you saying you want NT on the Amiga? Hmmm. We don't plan on
   supporting that effort..... but we won't stop others if they want to
   try it. As far as user group support. Hard to do in a small company,
   but, yes... to some degree. Esspecially if it can be done via the web.
   
   Q. Where do you see the Amiga's market niche today? It's lost its
   position in the games market, and it never had one for business
   software. Will you try and hop on Oracle's network computer train?
   A. There are two niches for the Amiga today: 1) As the computer for
   the guy who does not like Bill Gates and his idea of software. 2) As a
   box (not just a set-top box) that will be in X0,000,000 homes by the
   end of the decade. So far as oracle is concerned. I was part of their
   set-top box aliance for 3 years. It did not impress me much.
   
   Q. what are your relations with phase5? will you support them in the
   powerpc project or make your own version?
   A. Ah, a very good question. I'm pushing viscorp to work with Phase 5.
   And, of course, anyone else who thinks they can make a great PPC based
   Amiga. That's all I can say until don returns.
   
   Q. What is the current/planned status of relationship with PIOS? Does
   Viscorp itself intend to release a PPC OS?
   A. Ok, hold the voices for a minute. Time perhaps to back up and bring
   everyone up to date. Let me see if I can get this across. 1. VIScorp
   wants to see the Amiga survive as a computer system, not just as a
   set-top box. 2. Our focus and goal as a company is to make as many
   boxes as that big old factory overseas can crank them out. 3. Many
   companies want to make Amiga based systems. VIScorp does not want to
   shoot these guys in the knees as has been done in the past. 4. VIScorp
   needs to manage the development of future OS systems so as not to
   fragment the market. What would happen if PIOS, P4, VT, and others did
   their own private versions of the OS? Problem right now is one of
   timing.... And THAT is up to the corporate powers. Be they as they
   are.
   
   Q. What are VIScorp doing to promote ED in Europe? Are VIScorp talking
   with European cable companies?
   A. From what I know, VIScorp has a good number of contacts related to
   ED in Europe. In fact, more than in the US. There are also some much
   bigger, world-wide possibilities very near on the horizon. (The reason
   I word it this way, is that the question should be answered by David
   Rosen, Business Development, rather than by me, Director of Software.)
   
   Q. Does Viscorp now have control of AT? If not, when? And when will
   viscorp start selling Amiga computers in the USA?
   A. AT control. No, but it is getting very close. Meeting last week.
   long, tough, complicated. But soon. USA sales. I don't known. Would be
   yesterday if I ran the show.... What has been happening here seems to
   me much like a self-fulfilling prophecy: you can't sell computers if
   you don't stock them. Petro was telling me that they won't sell.
   Perhaps he is right, but again, you have to give it a try or you don't
   really know.
   
   Q. When can we expect a new highend AMIGA (PPC?) with a new OS? Will
   it have custom gfx chips or one of the PCI SVGA boards? What about RTG
   and DSP?
   A. Ok, so Andy and Don are no longer on channel. That's too bad. I
   think that IRC as it exists right now is pretty poor (sorry guys). The
   problem is that the user interface is not designed for the pragmatic
   user. People like Don take little flack from the technology. It it's
   too unfriendly, he's go much better things to do. One of you out there
   should invent a REAL IRC client. ... Then send me a copy.) .... If IRC
   worked better, I bet i could get the entire VIScorp on it.
   
   Q. there are decent IRC clients for one, and there are better IRC
   networks than this one aswell. just let some people who have a clue
   about IRC organise something next time
   A. Ok. Well thanks for the input on IRC. (I am running AMIRC.)
   
   Q. When can we expect a new highend AMIGA (PPC?) with a new OS? Will
   it have custom gfx chips or one of the PCI SVGA boards? What about RTG
   and DSP?
   A. PPC computer..... andy, they want to know when. Care to answer? The
   OS port would take about a year, best guess (my best guess, I mean).
   Don't know when such a thing would actually appear.
   
   Q. I Feel somehow the future of amiga will be decided by the success
   (or failure) of ED. What processor has been decided for ED, and will
   all ED software be compatible to Amiga computers, either Existing or
   coming models? My point is, If Ed becomes a success, and is 100%
   compatible to amiga, Then the market for amiga soft will expand
   largely, bringing back the developers to make ED/Amiga software, that
   will sell to a bigger market then the limited Amiga Community of
   today. Also, Will ED be Upgradable in any way?
   A. YES! Thank you.... that is what it is all about. ED is an Amiga.
   Most like an A1200, but with fast memory. I'd also like to add a
   faster processor (040 speed), but I'm beating on the powers to be
   about that one, because AT bought x00,000 68020s beforing we entered
   the scene, and now we are stuck with them. The only compatibility
   problems that might exist have to do with DF0:. Since some ED boxes
   may not have DF0:, we'll need to virtualize it. That might break a
   small number of apps. But the machine should be able to download and
   run anything via FTP off the net (within reason that is).
   
   Q. I want a Computer. I hate TV's. I want a real computer, that i can
   plug a 17" monitor, some scsii periherals and everything else i can. I
   also want to play games, programm on C++ [development support/software
   where?], and also do local networking [ethernet]. ED maybe is cool,
   for people not familiar with computers, but not for the others. Would
   we ever seen some real computers and not enchanched ED's with the same
   old AGA chipset [that is really old right now]? - not Alpha Stations
   btw, but mid-range or low-range computers...[before 2000] [btw LOW
   range is not 020 or 00 ! Standard Low range should be at least a
   030:)]
   A. Yes, I hear you. Ok, so was Walker low range? (squiz, give him
   voice to answer) Ok, then, I cannot tell you directly, but I've seen a
   very nice little 040 system that you would consider low range. It's
   meant for production in the next few months. But... problem as I see
   it is really about the chips. I agree that AGA absolutely does not cut
   it for a modern computer. But, you have to spend very big money these
   days to do you own chips... and there are some pretty hot multimedia
   chips out there. Ever look at the new brooktree chip set? Or PowerVR,
   whatever. The thing is there are companies 10 times the size of
   VIScorp who work on nothing but doing the chips. So, find a good one.
   Promise some volume. .... And it doesn't have to be the only one
   either! RTG.
   
   Q. sorry to have to ask this question - do you intend to develop the
   Amiga in its own right as a desktop workstation, or just as a settop
   box? We all fear, I think, the latter. Is VISCorp financially big
   enough to develop & support for the *massive* user base the Amiga has?
   and- (sorry I know some of this has already been asnwered) what is
   VISCorps choice of CPU? I heard that you may drop PPC and go for the
   DEC Alpha for example?
   A. Ok, no... I think the alpha idea was sort of a joke... started
   because someone wanted to stress what it means for the OS to be
   ported. The rest of this question was answered earlier....
   
   Q. What about more and better APIs for sound, GFX, fonts, printing,
   etc, support for standards like Twain, OpenDoc, etc, enhanced
   Datatypes...? I strongly believe future AmigaOS needs much better
   compatibility support built in direct in the OS. I would also prefer
   if NG Amiga will be as hardware independent as possible. How much will
   a PPC, PPCP, amiga be ? will it have 24bit gxf and 16bit sound built
   in ? I hope it won't. Also, will OS4 (?) have a better BOOPSI class
   set, something on the lines of class act (TM) ? Also, what about multi
   CPU support ? Also, will the new amiga be able to use PC ISA sound
   cards, more importantly, will there be a retagetable standard for
   sound ? Is it true that NetScrape is being ported too ? Can we speed
   this conf up a bit too ? ;)
   A. you are asking five or six questions. Most everyone out there wants
   the same thing... over and over I receive the same mail. I wonder if
   there is some way that we can communicate and sync with all of you,
   rather than me or don needing to talk to each of you one at a time?
   Perhaps via the net, Web? Do most people out there use the web?
   
   Q. not with this amount of people... Web doesn't solve it... either
   it's a conferencing system (same problems) or it's a news-alike
   system, which easily ends up in flame wars maybe someone wants to
   collect questions & answers and turn it into a FAQ?
   A. No, what I am thinking is that there would be two parts: 1)
   Suggestions - with archive and new postings, and a way to classify
   each suggestion. 2) Actions - the specs for what is in process, what's
   currently being built. With the jet lag and all, I've reached my limit
   for tonight. Why not open it back up and I'll answer a few /msg then
   call it a night. Yes, some other night. Also, I'm thinking about how
   VIScorp might organize a means of communications that gives all of you
   a chance to be heard. Right now it is tough for the people working on
   things to answer their mail. To much other stuff to do. Ok, well that
   should do it. Thanks all of you! Please don't give up. If the Amiga
   truly decides to dies some day, you will know it. This is not it. Hang
   with us.
   
   Q. Hi Carl: Will VisCorp be putting an Amiga logo on the ED's, and if
   not why? I think this would reintroduce the Amiga and boost it's image
   (by having the logo emblazoned on the 1000's of these you sell) in the
   marketplace! Also, I think it would be a missed opportunity and tragic
   if this is not done! IMHO
   A. good idea. Amiga logo on the STB. I like it.
   
   Q. Why doesn't Viscorp release the hardware that has already been
   developed (AAA, PPC, Walker)? And I heard something about a DEC based
   Amiga
   A...Also Releasing this will make you money in the meantime (for
   further developments) and keep us happy and show the world that the
   Amiga still lives on...Or at least license that technology out to
   someone who will?No, alpha was kind of an example of what could
   happen. Some of those projects should be helpful. Others, might be out
   of date already.
   
   Q. Will they release the source code or is that what you want to
   happen? Could be handy for everyone to know the internals properly! Do
   VISCorp actually own the amiga or not?
   A. not yet. Ok, if you want to contact VIScorp and have a reasonable
   chance of getting through SEND YOUR MESSAGES TO: flo@vistv.com If you
   send messages to Don, David, me or others, chances are not as good
   that you will get a reply.
   Contact VIScorp INC. via email. Visit their website for more
   information.
