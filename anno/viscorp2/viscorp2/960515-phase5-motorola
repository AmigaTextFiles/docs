    Oberursel, May 1996: Oberursel, May 1996: According to the plans of
      phase 5 digital products, Oberursel near Frankfurt, Germany, the
   coming year, 1997, will be a year of joy for all Amiga enthusiasts. As
   an expansion of the PowerUp project, which involves developing PowerPC
    processor cards for existing Amiga models, the company has announced
      that an independent Amiga OS-compatible computer system will be
    available in the first six months of 1997, representing a revolution
                          on the computer market.
                                      
    "We will continue to give our full support to the Amiga idea because
    as we were among the first Amiga users we continue to believe in the
    advantages and superior concepts of the Amiga", says Wolf Dietrich,
    Managing Director of phase 5 digital products. "However, it is high
   time for a radical leap forwards in technology that needs to be borne
    by a vision of a computer for the next millennium. We have seen too
             many half-hearted efforts in the last few years."
                                      
     In the view of Gerald Carda, Technical Director at phase 5, it is
      necessary to take a step towards complete innovation in order to
       realise such a vision. "Concepts that build up on the standard
   components of the PC world never offer the scope that give a computer
    system the lead that the Amiga 1000 had over other systems 12 years
                                   ago."
                                      
     In line with this philosophy, the new computer will be based on a
    highly integrated Custom Chip design which, as a central functional
         unit, will enable the system to achieve a hitherto unknown
   performance. "We will demonstrate the possibilities that are inherent
    in the resolute and single-minded pursuit of a new development that
      does not become submerged in the mainstream of adaptation to the
    Wintel world and the general tendency towards economy in the PC mass
   market which more or less throttles innovation for the sake of saving
    one single dollar", continues Gerald Carda. Despite this, the system
    now being announced is not intended to become a dream machine in the
    high price category. In the words of Wolf Dietrich: "On the basis of
   our current price calculation we will be able to offer unusually good
      value for money for which our products for the Amiga market are
                             already renowned."
                                      
   It is actually true that the extremely high degree of integration and
    the realisation of novel concepts will make it possible to achieve a
   performance that explodes existing bounds. Based on the PowerPC as the
   main processor, the new computer, in addition to the high performance
   of the processor, offers hardware support for multimedia (MPEG) and 3D
       functions, while even the basic system offers a resolution of
   1600x1200 pixels at 24-bit color depth and a refresh rate of 72 Hz. At
   the same time special functions for image and video effects have been
    implemented in the hardware. In addition there are audio inputs and
    outputs in stereo CD quality, a video-compatible and Genlock-capable
     24-bit video output and an FBAS/S-VHS video input. Along with the
       usual interfaces, the system is rounded off by a Fast SCSI-II
     controller, a network interface and an ISDN interface. With these
      features a complete system with a 120 MHz 603e PowerPC, 16 MByte
      memory, a SCSI hard disk of 1 GB and a quad-speed CD ROM will be
    available for a purchase price of around 3,000 DM (1,400 £ or 2,000
    US$, respectively) on the basis of the present market prices for the
   components. "We hope that in just about one year from now we will even
      be able to offer a 150 to 166 MHz 603e-processor at this price",
   anticipates Wolf Dietrich. "In terms of performance the processor has
     no problems in keeping up with a Pentium processor with an equally
      fast clock. However, there is no sign of any comparable graphic
   performance anywhere the PC field and the features of our systems will
   be difficult to match." There will be a similar system available with
    a PowerPC 604-e processor and 150 MHz for about 4,000 DM (1,800 £ or
                         2,700 US$, respectively).
                                      
   Although phase 5 digital products state that the total concept for the
   system has already been under development for quite some time and has
   practically been concluded, it is not possible to publish a more exact
    description of the system features at the present point in time. "At
    the moment we are intensively concerned with looking into whether it
    would be worth applying for a patent for any of the concepts we have
    developed and, if so, for which. So unfortunately we are not able to
    publish more precise details of the concept until after this process
     has been concluded and we have possibly applied for protection by
   patent", says Gerald Carda. For this reason we cannot reckon with any
    publication of the full system specifications until the end of June.
                                      
      Not only the hardware concept of phase 5, but also the software
   approach comes as a surprise. The new computer system will be supplied
   with a completely new operating system written in Native PowerPC code,
   but with binary compatibility with Amiga-OS 3.x. Here Gerald Carda has
          the following comments: "As we are already developing an
   Amiga-compatible PowerPC-Exec with an expansion library and a PowerPC
   CyberGraphX version in the context of the PowerUp developments, it is
     the logical consequence that the next step will be the innovative
      development of the other components. An operating system that is
       compatible with Amiga-OS 3.x makes it possible for the user to
   continue to use the existing software that can run under CyberGraphX,
   while developers who already give massive support to CyberGraphX will
     be able to continue to maintain and develop their products at the
    present level. In this way we will be enabling Amiga users to switch
     to the new system without any problems." "In addition", continues
      Gerald Carda, "we will be opening up ways of making considerable
   improvements in the internal structure and extensive additions to the
     scope of functions". Besides the 24-bit support which has already
    become a standard due to CyberGraphX, Gerald Carda names the coming
   CyberGraphX 3D and multimedia interface as an example. There will also
     be an optimisation of the system's performance and a revision and
      adaptation of the user interface in line with the functional and
     optical state of the art. "For years Amiga-OS has represented the
    conceptual realisation of ideas that today are propagated by many to
     be special innovations. This means that reprogramming will make it
    possible to achieve a really highly powered and modern OS. Of course
        our system will also be open for other operating systems or
     emulations, such as MacOS or an X-Windows link-up. The discussion
   concerning so-called new operating systems, however, was intended more
            as marketing hype than as a realistic alternative."
                                      
   The commitment with which phase 5 digital products will force forward
     this project is reflected not least in the considerable volume of
    investment that has been made in the development. "By the middle of
   1997 we will have invested seven-digit figures in this project", says
      Wolf Dietrich. "We have the know-how, the development team, the
      technical equipment, the support from third parties (especially
     Motorola) and the financial basis for this project. The only thing
   that we still need is massive and positive support from the Amiga user
      basis. With this early disclosure of our objectives we expect to
   receive the anticipated response from the users, for, after all, such
       a project only makes sense if there is still a large number of
    convinced Amiga fans. We therefore appeal to all Amiga fans to write
   to us, to send us faxes or to contact us via E-mail (under the address
       specially set up for this purpose: aproject@phase5.de ). Every
      positive reaction will strengthen this forward-looking project."
                                      
                                      
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
                 PowerUP project continues to make progress
                                      
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   The PowerUp project also continues to make progress. "The delivery of
    the developer PowerPC boards will now start in summer", says Gerald
   Carda. "Unfortunately, we are a few months behind in our schedule due
     to extensive discussions between Motorola, Amiga Technologies and
     phase 5. These companies were to agree on a close cooperation and
    clarify a number of matters, especially with regard to new standards
       specific to the new PowerPC. After the discussion concerning a
   takeover by VIScorp started and the wave or redundancies that directly
      followed at Amiga Technologies, which led to most of the contact
   persons who had been involved in the projects leaving the company, AT
    abandoned the present cooperation. For this reason we will waste no
   further time and will continue with our project on our own, which was
   the way in which we started it. Nor can we wait any longer to see what
               VIScorp might possibly intend or not intend."
                                      
     The support for external developers in the PowerUp program is now
    complete. More than 250 developers - including practically all noted
   commercial software suppliers in the Amiga field - are registered and
     their numbers are growing every day. This alone is evidence of the
    strong support for the future Amiga-compatible PowerPC platform. As
   from the second half of May, the registered users will now be able to
    order the PowerPC Beta developer boards from phase 5 which mean the
   green light for the hot phase of the world-wide software development.

    In the realisation of their new, innovative computer system phase 5
    will be fully supported by Motorola. "We appreciate the powerful and
    innovative concept that phase 5 represents and we fully support the
   efforts of this company as a partner in our global PowerPC strategy."
   says John Letham, European Technical Marketing Manager, Motorola RISC
    Microprocessors. "We have had a number of joint meetings now and we
    are impressed by the know-how and vision that is the basis of phase
                            5«'s driving force."

     In close cooperation with Motorola phase 5 is preparing technology
   demonstrations, to be shown in due course, which will demonstrate the
   impressive capabilities of the next generation of PowerPC 603e CPUs at
       significantly increased clock rates. This programme is already
     underway and Summer of 1996 will see phase 5 present prototypes of
   PowerPC boards for Amiga 3000/4000 as well as for the Apple Macintosh
   7500/8500/9500 series. "With the presentation of these new processors,
    Motorola as a leading semiconductor manufacturer clearly illustrates
    their capabilities demonstrating exactly why the next generation of
       PowerPC CPUs will hold the pole position in the microprocessor
      performance race". says Wolf Dietrich of phase 5. "Our computer
   system, when shipping next year, will also offer these extremely fast
     processors, delivering true high-end workstation performance. The
    higher speed of the CPUs will also deliver a performance increase to
   the upgrade boards for existing Amiga systems." With the presentation
     of this PowerPC technology demo on Apple MacIntosh system phase 5
   digital products announces their entry into the MacIntosh accelerator
   market. This new branch of their operation will make additional use of
    the PowerPC know-how that is been build up in the Amiga development,
    while for both the Amiga and the MacIntosh PowerPC products an even
     more attractive pricing can be realized due to the higher quantity
                       demands of PowerPC processors

      phase 5 digital products on the situation of Amiga Technologies
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   In addition to this project announcement, phase 5 also made some side
        remarks on the current state of affairs with regard to Amiga
    Technologies. "To our regret we found that Amiga Technologies offers
    us no sort of outlook or basis for developing into the future", says
    Wolf Dietrich. "The first year of Amiga Technologies was marked by a
   continued chain of wrong decisions which have been responsible for the
   bad situation in which the company now finds itself. The results must
    be adequate to the objectives set in the spring of 1995 and in this
     respect they are more than disappointing. There is no getting away
    from this. In fact the same mistakes were made that were previously
   made at Commodore and partly by the same people. For example, attempts
      continue to keep technically outdated products on the market at
     unrealistic prices, which is particularly true in the case of the
    A4000T. Another point is that the marketing concepts are completely
    outdated, there is an absence of any kind of futuristic vision and a
   lack of any independent development, which is so pronounced that today
   AT neither has any 68060 technology to show for itself nor even a sign
       of any PowerPC technology. The brief spark of any independent
   development was extinguished again by the latest wave of redundancies.
    In this respect the only thing that we can just about expect from AT
   is that they sell off their large quantities of existing stock. These
    do give us some cause to hope that the existing products will be on
    the market for a while and that, in due course, they will be offered
     at more realistic prices. Finally, the only thing that can be said
     about the activities of AT is: They should have asked someone who
                             knows his stuff."
                                      
   In the opinion of phase 5 a takeover of Amiga Technologies by VIScorp
   does not awaken hope of any major innovations or any strengthening of
     the Amiga system. "So far we have heard nothing from VIScorp that
   would cause us to assume that anything different is being planned than
    the exploitation of the Amiga technology in a settop box. Nor do we
   see why this company, which must certainly concentrate all its efforts
     on realising its settop projects, should be interested in further
   pursuing the primary aim of continuing with the Amiga system. If this
      had been the case, it would already have been quite feasible for
       VIScorp to initiate such a project as a licensee of the Amiga
    technology." phase 5 sees this critical opinion confirmed by current
      events. "The actions of VIScorp do not convince us that they are
   serious in continuing with the Amiga. So far, for example, VIScorp has
   not directly spoken to the developers who were the last to support the
    Amiga. Nor was there any reaction when we tried to make contact. The
   VIScorp meeting in Toulouse that has now been announced lacks any kind
    of organisation and was called without there being any recognisable
    concept behind it. For this reason it is more than doubtful whether
   even a sign of any constructive result can be expected to come out of
   it, so that in our view it would be a pure waste of time to attend, as
     we have repeatedly found in the recent year at ESCOM meetings. We
   don't need a repeat of that." Let it be mentioned in passing that the
    hope often expressed in the general discussion, i.e. that in VIScorp
    Amiga will find itself taken over by a company that will finance the
    development of a new generation of Amiga products more or less from
    the petty cash, is something that Wolf Dietrich considers to be very
    optimistic. "For a start we had exactly the same expectations a year
   ago when everyone thought that the giant ESCOM would get things moving
   at Amiga from a standing position and quickly produce a new generation
    of Amiga computers for a more competitive price. Secondly we should
   first wait and see whether the figures that have been bandied about in
    the discussion concerning VIScorp's takeover of AT have any sort of
                              real fundament."

                       About phase 5 digital products
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
      phase 5 digital products, based in Oberursel near Frankfurt, are
      internationally operating manufacturers of hardware and software
   products. The company is entirely owned by its founders, Gerald Carda
    and Wolf Dietrich. Since the market launch of its first product line
     in 1992 this company, which consists of an experienced team of the
   first Amiga users and developers, quickly established itself as one of
   the leading manufacturers in the Amiga market. Since 1992 its products
   have been distinguished many times, including 20 awards for Product of
    the Year in Amiga journals. In 1995 phase 5 supplied accessories to
    the value of some DM 12 million (5.5 million £ or 8 million US$) in
     the Amiga market alone. Since the Christmas season of 1995 almost
    30,000 hardware products have been delivered. The product portfolio
    for Amiga includes accelerator cards, SCSI controllers and graphics
   cards. In these fields phase 5 digital products has repeatedly proved
      itself to be manufacturer that is a forerunner and an innovative
     leader, for instance in bringing out the first Zorro III-DMA-SCSI
    controller world-wide, the Fastlane Z3, in producing the first 68030
     card world-wide with a DMA-SCSI controller for the Amiga 1200, in
      offering the first 68060 card world-wide for Amiga systems (the
      Cyberstorm 060/50 for A4000), in manufacturing the first 64-bit
    graphics card world-wide with full system-integrated 24-bit support
   (the CyberVision64 for A3000/A4000) or in bringing out the first 68060
   card for the A1200 world-wide, the Blizzard 1260. Along with intensive
    development activities as a Beta developer for Motorola in the 68060
      and PowerPC field, hardware developments at phase 5 include pure
   research work in the field of multimedia high-performance DSPs and in
    the latest development department ASE (advanced silicon engineering)
     VLSI chip design. An expanding team of some 20 staff is currently
    working on these projects at the company's headquarters in Oberursel
    on premises covering an area of 960 square metres. In the adjoining
    service area, which covers an area of almost 600 square metres, the
     company, as from August 96, will be producing hardware products -
       including the new PowerPC products - in its own, highly modern
    manufacturing plant using the most recent manufacturing techniques.
