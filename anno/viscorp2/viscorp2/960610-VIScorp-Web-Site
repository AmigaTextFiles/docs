     CHICAGO, June 10 -- Visual Information Service Corp. (Nasdaq: VICP
   Bulletin Board), has established a site on the World Wide Web, located
   at www.vistv.com, to provide information on the company and updates on
   new developments related to its Interactive TV (ITV) technologies such
    as the Universal Internet-Television Interface(R) (UITI(R)) set-top
   device, which the company anticipates will be in retail stores by the
                            1996 holiday season.
                                      
     The Web site provides resumes of key company executives, and easy
    click-and-point e-mail access to company officers. Because VIScorp's
   interactive device utilizes the Amiga operating system and chip sets,
    the site also offers a hot link to an Amiga Web site so visitors can
             find out more information about the Amiga system.
                                      
   In addition, the company has been using the site to keep Web visitors
    informed on developments related to VIScorp's pending acquisition of
    Amiga Technologies GMbH. VIScorp announced on April 11, 1996, that a
     letter of understanding had been signed with Escom, AG to acquire
    Amiga. The companies are currently in negotiations. VIScorp already
   holds a license to use the Amiga operating system and chip sets in its
    ITV set-top devices and is developing several products that utilize
   the Amiga technology. The company is exploring numerous possibilities
        for distribution of its set-top device, as well as licensing
                  opportunities for the Amiga technology.
                                      
   "The site receives a significant amount of 'hits' every day from Amiga
     users, those who follow ITV developments, and interested potential
       investors," said William Buck, Chief Executive Officer. "As we
     introduce new ITV products, we see the opportunity to obtain rapid
     feedback from consumers using our Web site. We anticipate that the
    site will also facilitate dialogue with a broad audience, including
       software developers, distributors, suppliers, and customers."
                                      
      The company has announced that it intends to begin marketing the
      UITI(R) in the fourth quarter of 1996. According to VIScorp, the
       device will give home television viewers new and exciting home
    entertainment options by giving them access to Internet, World Wide
    Web and on-line services, dramatically expanding the capabilities of
    the family television set with options such as e-mail, on-line chat
   and Net surfing that has, until now, been available only to those who
                          own personal computers.
                                      
   The UITI(R) is designed to be placed on top of or next to a television
      set and connected to a standard telephone line. It comes with a
       built-in 14.4 BPS modem and, using special fonts and graphics,
     presents text and graphics through the television set that can be
      easily enjoyed at normal viewing distances. Viewers can control
    extensive functions with an enhanced remote control. The device also
     features local memory storage to enable users to download text and
   graphics. The UITI(R) runs on the proprietary Amiga operating system,
       which VIScorp explains has long been recognized for delivering
   superior graphic quality. The device can overlay graphics and text on
   the television picture so viewers can continue to watch their favorite
    shows, or bring up a solid background to facilitate viewing of text.
                                      
      In addition to the UITI(R), the company says an enhanced set-top
   device, the Electronic Device(R) (ED(R)) is scheduled for roll out in
    1997, and will feature capabilities such as telephone reception and
    dial-up, facsimile, pay-per-view options, electronic mail, access to
            on- line services, including the Internet, and more.
