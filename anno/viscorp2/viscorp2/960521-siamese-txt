   Siamese System for the Amiga
   [INLINE] 5/6/96 - HiQ Limited are proud to announce the launch and
   immediate availability of the Siamese System for the Amiga range of
   Computers which creates the First fully integrated Multi platform
   computer system. This system which uses the flexibility of the Amiga's
   true Multitasking operating system and the low cost of standard
   Windows 95 based PC's give the user the potential of a fully
   integrated Amiga / Win95 PC / Macintosh platform all controlled from
   one keyboard, mouse and monitor. The benefits are obvious in having
   all file sharing between all of the running operating systems, text
   clipboard cut and paste and access to the low cost PC components to
   create a very powerful Multimedia authoring and general purpose
   workstation
   
   From the Amiga owners point of view, the user can run PC software and
   media from the Amiga's Workbench and use the low cost PC hardware to
   add to the Amiga's abilities, enabling it to play 16 bit sound, Midi
   files, and view high quality digital video, Indeo, Quicktime, Mpeg and
   MJpeg etc. The Siamese software gives the Amiga access to all of the
   PC's disk drives including Floppy, CDrom, etc. Even drives mounted via
   a networked machine are available on the Amiga. All of this allows
   programs like Scala on the Amiga which is generally acknowledged as
   the best of its kind, to have even more features added to the standard
   Amiga system under its control via Arexx.
