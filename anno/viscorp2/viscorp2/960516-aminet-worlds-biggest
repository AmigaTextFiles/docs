                            By Urban D. Mueller
                                      
   Today, May 16th 1996, four years after its inception, Aminet is the
   world's largest collection of freely distributable software for any
   computer system. I'd like to seize this opportunity to talk about the
   recent history of our archive and thank everyone involved. Also, to
   celebrate the event, we're giving away a CDROM drive and 10 Aminet CD
   subscriptions; read more below.
   
  THE PAST
  
   It has been a long while - 17 months - since I last talked about the
   Aminet. That's simply because the violent early days are definitely
   over. Much about Aminet is now routine, everyone has grown used to it.
   (For more on the early history, check docs/misc/5000.txt and
   10000.txt).
   
   Again, there has been steady growth. The number of mirrors has
   increased from 12 to 30, we have more and better search services and
   other incremental improvements. Some services still wait to be
   implemented, though, especially the possibility for everyone to submit
   comments to Aminet software and append them to the .readme file. Other
   services are only rudimentary, like the rating facility. Clearly,
   improvement is due.
   
   More important than those access features, however, are the contents.
   And here, the situation looks very good. Firstly, there have been more
   uploads by the users than ever before, with a record high of 430 in
   one week just recently. Additional growth was caused by the fact that
   the Aminet CD's now appear bi-monthly (which is the way the
   participants in a large survey wanted it), and because those CD's
   don't get completely filled in that short time, more material is
   integrated into Aminet regularly to fill them. Thanks to that, we now
   have large collections of clip art, mods, fonts, games and other
   interesting stuff from outside sources on Aminet.
   
   The most important development, though, is the fact that Aminet has
   now been accepted by the world outside the networks as the place where
   one can publish freely distributable software to make it widely
   available. Thus, almost everything that is available for the Amiga
   ends up here. And I am absolutely convinced that this service, the
   availability of everything to everyone, has contributed considerably
   to the amazing life-force that the Amiga is showing in those tough
   times.
   
  THE PRESENT
  
   Once more, it's statistics time. Apart from the record number of
   29.000 files (world record according to www.shareware.com), we're just
   crossing the total size of 5 gigabytes (second to a 5.7G OS/2
   distribution archive). In addition, as mentioned before, we just saw
   an all time upload record of 433 files in one week. Some further
   stats: Monthly uploads (excluding integrated material):

  THE FUTURE
  
   Currently, my main project is rewriting the Aminet mirror scripts.
   Duh, you say, what does that mean for me? More than you think. The new
   scripts will allow alternate main sites to take over in case wuarchive
   goes down, so you get more reliable service. And they're very easy to
   install, so you can expect more mirrors to pop up. Next, they run on
   Amigas as well, do you can have your personal Aminet mirror on your
   harddisk. Finally, they are a precondition for implementing the long
   promised annotations, and a thing called views.
   
   Annotations are the last big missing feature from Aminet. Everyone
   should be able to post comments about other people's uploads, giving
   usage hints, recommendations or compatibility notes. I still cannot
   promise any dates on this one, but chances to get this implemented
   have increased now.
   
   The other nice-to-have that's still missing are views. Views are trees
   of softlinks that create a different image of the Aminet file
   collection. You could, for example, have a second 'Aminet' that only
   contains modules, but the modules are sorted by author. Or one that
   only contains files that are in the download charts. That, too, will
   still take a while.
   
   Finally, some improvements are due in the access software of Aminet
   CDs. That will hopefully be adressed soon, too.
   
  THE CONTEST
  
   To celebrate this event, we've decided to run a big contest. To take
   part, you have to guess the exact number of files there were on Aminet
   one year ago, ie. on May 16th 1995. Mail your guess (just the raw
   number in the body of the mail) to aminet-server@aminet.org . Among
   the best guesses, we give away:
   
   1 CDROM drive with Aminet Set 1,2,3 and a one year Aminet CD
   subscription
   10 one year Aminet CD subscriptions
   
   We're also accepting snail-mailed submissions, send them (just your
   guess and your address) to:
   
   Schatztruhe GmbH
   Aminet-Wettbewerb
   Veronikastr. 33
   D-45131 Essen
   GERMANY
   
   Submissions are accepted until mid-August. Winners will be drawn then.
   Good luck!
