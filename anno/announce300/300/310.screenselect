TITLE
 
  ScreenSelect V1.2 - A Commodity to change screen orders.
 
 
AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION
 
  ScreenSelect is a commodity program for users who commonly have more
  than 2 screens open at the same time. It gives you a list of screen
  names where you can then pick the screen you want to come frontmost.
  
  In addition you can bind a hotkey for every public screen and also
  bind a hotkey to change Default Public Screen.

  ScreenSelect also has a font independent GadTools interface.
 

VERSION INFO

  Changes to V1.1b.

  Version 1.2
  ===========

   Compilation date was 07-Dec-1992.

   * Previously `ScreenSelect' exited when it couldn't find screens.
     This made it impossible to put it in `Startup-Sequence' or
     `User-Startup' file before `Workbench' screen is opened.

   * From now on, version number format should be Amiga Style Guide
     compliant.

   * Added `AUTOACTIVATE' option.

   * Added `SCREENKEY' option which allows easy default public screen
     selection with hotkey.

   * Added `Default PubScreen' text gadget.

   * First version compiled with SAS/C V6.1. Size reduced almost 2k
     compared to V1.1b.

   * Better documentation.


REQUIREMENTS

  Kickstart V37 or greater.
