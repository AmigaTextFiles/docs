DESCRIPTION

	FastLife is an Amiga implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

	In 1970 John Horton Conway invented the game of Life.  Conway's goal
	was to create a board "game" with simple rules that would exhibit
	complex behavior.

	The desire to combine the speed of Tom Rokicki's blitter Life
	routines with an Intuition interface and access to many of the
	classic Life patterns led to the development of FastLife.  Olaf
	Seibert's 32-bit fallback 680x0 mode allows the CPU to take over
	when there is insufficient memory to use the blitter or if you have
	a fast CPU.

	Features:

	   Full Intuition interface
	   High Speed Blitter mode for slower Amigas (screens up to 1023x1023)
	   CPU mode for faster Amigas (screens up to 16384x16384)
	   Automatic fallback to CPU mode when memory is low
	   Any screen width and height (dependent on memory and mode)
	   Screen mode and screen size requester
	   Speed control
	   Run for a specified number of generations
	   Run to a specified generation
	   Runs from Workbench and CLI
	   200+ Life patterns in text file format
	   Executable size is less than 30 kilobytes
	   Tested with Enforcer and MungWall
