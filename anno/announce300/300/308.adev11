TITLE:         ADev11
VERSION:       1.2
AUTHOR:        Stan Burton
               Internet: sburton@dres.dnd.ca
               BIX:      sburton

DESCRIPTION:   ADev11 is a complete development system for the Motorola
               MC68HC11 processor.  Separately assembled source files are
               linked to produce an S-record file.  Includes assembler
               (a highly modified version of DAsm), linker, librarian,
               disassembler and serial downloader.  Additionally, the
               assembler, linker and librarian handle source for 6800,
               6303 and 68HC16.  For those that dislike S-records there
               is a converter which converts to memory dump.  Source for
               the converter is included.

REQUIREMENTS:  AmigaDos 1.3 or later

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: None

NEW FEATURES:  Mostly bug fixes, some new features and additional library
               functions.  Multiple processor support for downloader.  For
               those who tried to use the disassembler and failed - sorry,
               this one is much better.
