DESCRIPTION

        Arn is a newsreader for USENET/UUCP messages to use with
        Amiga UUCP installations (CNews and derivates or AmigaUUCP D).

        Arn is a fast newsreader which allows you to select groups and
        articles individually. It uses small databases (2% of newsvolume)
        for providing fast overviews over articles. It's simliar to the
        well known UN*X 'nn'-newsreader, but its no ported software.

        It offers much functionality to the user and is well configurable
        (runs with nearly all UUCP-installations). Especially when you have
        a lot of newsgroups and articles Arn is a good choice, because other
        newsreaders hold all their information in memory, but Arn tries to
        use as little as possible.
        Arn has a new scheme for managing newsgroups, which makes
        subscription and unsubscription easy.

        Arn is completely controllable via the keyboard. Intuition/mouse
        support is planned for further versions, but it has the advantage
        of being used via serial ports.

        Features:

        * table overview over newsgroups and articles

        * selection of groups and articles of interest

        * articles are grouped together by their subjects and then
          chronologically sorted

        * auto-selection and global/local kill-files

        * fast overview presentation of all articles by use of small
          databases

        * doesn't require much memory and is fast even with really many and
          large groups

        * configurable display of article-headers

        * built-in pager, recognizing extra long lines

        * full usage of screen sizes

        * multi-user support

        * works over the serial line (using termcap), too

        * rudimentary MIME support

NEW FEATURES

        Since the V1.00 beta and V1.00 preliminary there has changed a lot:

        + AUX: support via termcap
        + configurable font
        + new method of managing (adding/removing) newsgroups
        + Arn now shows all threads chronologically
        + using upto 78 screen lines within selection screens
        + using local,environment variables for USERNAME etc.
        + Correct handling of empty newsgroups.
        + optimized screen refresh at group- and article-selection
        + Pager now can jump to bottom of the file.
        + search functions in group- and article level work now.
        + 'k' junk thread in pager
        + New design of key mappings. No longer Ctrl-keys, instead
          submenus are used. I hope they are now more orthogonal
          (consistent) than the old ones.
        + Complete rewrite of the manual (70 pages TeX).
        + "moderators"-file support.
        + additional check for "FollowUp-To: poster" and non existing groups.
        + longer subjects at article selector (depends on screen size)
        + limited MIME-support (qp and base64-decoding for text/plain).
        + many other changes

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        Naturally, UUCP software is required for getting news.
        This can be CNews or AmigaUUCP 1.16D for example.
        CNews has an advantage over AmigaUUCP by providing an
        "active"-file, which lets ArnMaster build its databases
        faster (no scanning for new articles needed).

        Arn should work on any Amiga model. OS2.04 or higher is
        recommended, because a few functions are only available
        with this OS-versions. Nevertheless it should work with
        Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3, too.
