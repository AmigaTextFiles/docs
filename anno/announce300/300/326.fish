Disks 801-810 are now available.  Shipping to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by 27-Jan-93.

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

	Fred Fish
	Catalog Disk Requests
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, Arizona  85284
	USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other sort of
	proprietary material included, since I then have to go examine
	each file to decide if it is distributable or not, and if not,
	what effect removing it might have.  Unless the material is
	particularly interesting, I frequently just toss such disks
	into the recycling bin.

2.	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my disks.  I.E,
	place all files related to a particular submission under a single
	directory on the disk.  If there is more than one submission per
	disk, place each submission in its own directory.

3.	Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing that
	summarizes your submission.  It should be about 3-10 lines, and
	include the current version number, the version and disk number
	of the most recent version (if any) that was last included in the
	library, whether or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from its sub-
	directory and if necessary, supply a script runnable from workbench
	(via :c/xicon or c:iconx) that makes all necessary assigns, copies
	fonts and libraries, etc.

5.	Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient padding.

Thanks!!!

		Whenever a new screen is brought to the front, this screen is
		examined.  If it is a public screen, it is made into the de-

		public screen is always the one which you have most recently
		brought to the front, and applications which use the default
		public screen will appear there.  Version 1.2, an update to

CPK		A program to render a space filling representation of atoms
		in molecules.  This is the type of representation one would
		find in the plastic 'CPK' (Corey, Pauling, Kendrew) models
		often used in organic chemistry.  There are no hard coded
		constraints on the number of atoms it can process, it cor-
		rectly handles intersecting 3-dimensional spheres by using
		the Bresenham circle algorithm in 3D, and computes using the
		the current display screen resolution for simplicity and
		speed.  Version 1.0, binary only.

SmallMath	"Drop-in" replacements for the Commodore IEEE math libraries
		for users with a math coprocessor.  Since these libraries do

		same reason, however, they cannot be used without a coproces-
		sor.  Version 1.2, an update to version 1.1 on disk 718,
