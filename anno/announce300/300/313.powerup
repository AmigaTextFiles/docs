               COMMODORE ANNOUNCES "POWER UP" SAVINGS 
                 PROGRAM FOR THE AMIGA 4000 AND 1200

(West Chester, PA-----December 14, 1992) Commodore Business Machines,
Inc. (U.S.) today announced that the company's newest and most
technologically advanced systems, the Amiga (R) 4000 and the Amiga 1200,
will be available at major cost-savings through its "Power Up" program.
This offer begins January 1, 1993 and runs through March 31, 1993.

The Amiga 4000-25/120 plus ASDG Art Department Professional TM and
Electronic Arts DeluxePaint IV TM AGA will be available for an MSRP of
$2693, a savings of $1500 (if these items are sold separately). The A4000
was introduced in September 1992 as Commodore's premier multimedia
computer.

The Amiga 1200 plus SoftWood Inc.'s Final Copy 1.3 TM and Electronic
Arts DeluxePaint IV AGA, will be available at an MSRP of $599, a savings
of $600. Both the A4000 and the A1200 feature Commodore's new
Advanced Graphics Architecture TM (AGA) chip set that enables users to
display and animate graphics in multiple resolutions at up to 256,000
colors from a palette of 16.8 million colors.

Important to note is that the "Power Up" software programs listed with
the A4000 and the A1200 are not packaged with the systems. Customers
will receive these software packages within 30 days, at no additional cost,
directly from Commodore after receipt of proof of purchase and a
completed CPU Warranty Card. All "power-up" software offers are
designed to support the (AGA) chip set design.

The A4000 comes standard with a 120MB hard drive, 6MB of memory, a
dual speed high-density floppy drive, and CrossDOS software which
enables users to read and write to MS-DOS formatted floppy and hard
drives. The A1200, the lower cost, entry level member of the AGA based
family, is the company's newest 32-bit personal computer. Other features
include a low-profile design, CrossDOS and PCMCIA expandability. 
                    
"Since their introduction, both the A4000 and the A1200 have been widely
publicized as the newest standard setters for video and multimedia users.
Now through the `Power Up' program, these Amiga systems are being
offered at substantial savings. This program is an excellent opportunity
for multimedia users to purchase outstanding Amiga equipment at
competitive prices," commented David Archambault, director of business
marketing.
