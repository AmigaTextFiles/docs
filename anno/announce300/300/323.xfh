DESCRIPTION

	XFH is an AmigaDOS filesystem handler that can be used with the
	Xpk compression standard to provide transparent access to data
	compression for applications. Programs and data can be
	automatically compressed when written and decompressed when read
	back; the fact that the data is stored compressed is invisible
	to other programs. A first approcsimation is to say that
	XFH is sort of a cross between Stacker on the PC and PPPatch.

	XFH is fully compatible with Xpk and the compressed data can be
	accessed normally with standard Xpk applications if prefered.
	Also, XFH is completely system-friendly and does not affect
	normal disk operation.

	This version is a much improved update to the version
	distributed as a part of Xpk.

NEW FEATURES

	Major changes since v1.12:

	- Bug fixes. Most important, the infamous bug in ExNext() /
	  ExAll() when using filenotes should now be fixed.
	- Improved user interface: The handler now mounts in a new,
	  hopefully better way, and it can be controlled with a gui
	  front panel (written by Nicola Salmoria).
	- Arexx support (for setting options).
	- MODE_READWRITE support (for appending to files).
	- Full source code included (finally).


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	XFH requires that Xpk has been installed properly on the system
	(any version should do). Xpk is available as

		Filename: xpk25usr.lha
		Directory: /amiga/util/pack
		Site: amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80)

	XFH has no other system requirements. However, OS2.0 and a Hard
	Disk are recommended.
