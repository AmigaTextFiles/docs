ANNOUNCING DENNY ATKIN'S BEST AMIGA TIPS AND SECRETS!

This new release from COMPUTE Books contains 256 pages of
hints, tips, and troubleshooting info for the Amiga
computer. Among the topics covered:

  Tips for AmigaDOS 1.2 through 3.0
  Using Workbench 1.2 through 3.0
  AGA Amiga tips, covering both the A4000 and A1200
  Expanding your Amiga
  Getting online
  Speeding up your Amiga
  Emulating other computers
  Adding a CD-ROM drive
  Solving compatibility problems
  and much more!

This book provides hundreds of useful tips for the beginner
and experienced user alike. Atkin gathered the tips in the
book over seven years of providing Amiga technical support,
both as founder of one of the country's first Amiga user
groups in 1985 and as a writer and editor for major Amiga
magazines.

Denny Atkin is editor of COMPUTE's Amiga Resource and the
U.S. correspondent for the British magazine Amiga Computing.
He's been writing professionally about the Amiga since 1987,
with articles appearing in COMPUTE, Omni, AMnews,
AmigaWorld, .info, AmigoTimes, AX, Amiga Computing, and
Shareware Shopper.

DENNY ATKIN'S BEST AMIGA TIPS AND SECRETS will be available
in bookstores around the second week in January. Many
Software Etc. stores should be keeping it in stock, and it
can easily be ordered from B.Dalton and Waldenbooks stores.
ISBN: 0-87455-275-3.
