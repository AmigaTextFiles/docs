Hi Dan:

	This article is really from Denny Atkin, DennyA@cup.portal.com,
so it should be posted in his name, not mine.  However, he is having
trouble on Portal and can't seem to get it to you.  (Feel free to
e-mail one of his other addresses or call him and ask, if this is a
problem.)

                                                        Dan

From: DennyA@cup.portal.com (Denny Atkin)

	COMPUTE's Amiga Resource is happy to announce an irregular new column
beginning in the March 1993 issue.  Written by comp.sys.amiga's Dan Barrett,
the column is entitled

			W E I R D B E N C H

and its focus and style will be familiar to BLAZEMONGER fans throughout the
universe!

	Every WeirdBench column will concentrate on the WEIRD and STRANGE
aspects of the Amiga... information that you cannot get ANYWHERE else.
For example, did you know:

	o	In Sweden, it is illegal to put a live panda into your
		floppy disk drive?

	o	The Amiga was actually developed by the "Mrs. Pauls"
		Fish Fillet Company?

	o	880K floppies can be changed into high-density (1.7 MB)
		disks by using THE POWER OF YOUR MIND?

	o	The new Workbench has secret BACKDOORS where you can find 
		the lyrics to all of Dave Haynie's favorite music, translated
		into assembly code?

These are just a few examples of the kind of USEFUL, PERTINENT information
you'll find in WeirdBench.  Are there any questions?

(?)	"Why is the column called 'WeirdBench'?"

		Well, we wanted to call it "Irving Does Dallas", but the
		name was already taken.

(?)	"Will WeirdBench simply be reprints of Dan's old articles from
	comp.sys.amiga.advocacy?"

		No -- it is all new material, except for part of one column
		which introduces, um... a "well known" Amiga arcade game.

(?)	"Is WeirdBench about BLAZEMONGER?"

		No, definitely not.  Well... maybe there will be a LITTLE bit
		of BLAZEMONGER.  Just a little.  Or maybe a lot.  We can
		definitely say that maybe there might be some unknown amount
		of BLAZEMONGER-like material, but we won't commit to that.
		OK?

(?)	"Why are you making up questions and asking them to yourself?"

		Don't ask.

So watch for WeirdBench -- the new column from the creator of BLAZEMONGER,
PHRASEMONGER, SPAZMONGER, AmigaDOS 17.0, and the TURING MACHINE!  Coming in
March 1993 in COMPUTE's Amiga Resource.
