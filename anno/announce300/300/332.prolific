DESCRIPTION

  Prolific, Inc. provides a complete line of E-CAD software for producing
Printed Circuit Boards.  A complete description of Prolific's product
line is included in this announcement.


Pro-Net         Schematic Capture program draws your circuit quickly
                and easily.  A large (3 disk) library of device
                definitions provides a range of TTL, LSTTL, and other
                logic families, plus easy modification of existing
                devices to new logic families.  Analog devices are
                supported with lessened Error Checking.

                Pro-Net supports multiple page schematics with Page
                Referencing (industry first), and Net List
                connections can be made directly on one page or
                indirectly on any number of pages by means of Signal
                Names applied to the Signal Lines.

                Signal Lines can be bundled together for cleaner
                schematics and Bundles can be named as well for more
                readable schematics.
                
                Device and Pin Swapping is supported with error
                checking.  Device Labels can be assigned by Zones so
                that logical gates will not share a physical device
                with gates in another area (industry first).
                
                The hierarchical command structure groups commands
                by mode and is implemented by context sensitive
                Intelligent Function Keys (IFKs).
                
                Powerful commands augment schematic creation:
                Demorgan equivalence, Rubberbanding, Grid Snap, Grid
                Display, Grid Size control, Bus Bundling, Signal
                Name stepping, Move, Repeat, etc.
                
                New devices can be quickly and easily drawn and
                described.

                Variable template sizes support MIL-STD 860.
                
                Page size ranges from A to E.
                
                Flexibility in drawing connectors.  Several
                different types of traditional connector drawings
                are supported.
                
                Industry's first to have weight assignment to insure
                that important Nets are presented for routing first.
                
                Post Processing function generates Net List (used
                for guided or automatic routing in Pro-Board), Bill
                of Materials (BOM), Component Mapping, and Error
                Reporting.
                
                Performs Back Annotation from PCB layout to renumber
                ICs.
                
                User-specified Power Plane generation.
                
                Supports Dot Matrix and Laser printers, and HPGL and
                non-HPGL pen plotters.


Pro-Board V2.1  The latest version of our manual PCB router contains
                all the improvements that went into Version 3.0 with
                the exception of the automatic placement and
                automatic routing functions.

                Easily add DIPs, SIPs, 2-Pin devices (such as
                standard, though-hole resistors and capacitors), and
                Library Parts (custom designed for unique physical
                footprints, such as PGA and PLCC ICs, transistors,
                and SMT components).
                
                Device orientation and position can be quickly
                modified after placement using the commands Move,
                Rotate, and Swap.

                The Net List generated by Pro-Net aids in routing by
                highlighting the Pins to be connected in each Net. 
                You will not have to refer to the schematic or count
                pins to know which connections to make.  Net List
                optimization function re-orders the list of
                connections in each Net according to actual Device
                Placement on the PCB to provide the shortest
                interconnects.

                Powerful Maze Search algorithm is used to find the
                shortest path to connect two points.  If suitable, a
                trace will be drawn to another pin if already
                connected, or a trace segment will be drawn to an
                existing trace if that provides the best results.

                Powerful commands exist for modifying traces to
                increase routability.  Traces may be pushed out of
                the way, rerouted around areas, stretched between
                two points, or broken in the middle and modified by
                sections.

                Direct support for 16 layer PCBs, plus automatic
                Power and Ground layer generation.

                Error Checking can be dynamic or advisory.  Dynamic
                error checking presents each incorrectly routed
                Net in sequence for correction.  Advisory error
                checking sends a list of incorrectly routed Nets to
                the printer, screen, or a file.
                
                Standard PCB resolution is 0.025" (25 mils) with 12
                mil traces and 13 mil separations.  The Fine Line
                mode operates on a 20 mil grid with 8 mil trace
                widths and separations, allowing two traces to be
                routed between two standard Pads with a 0.1"
                separation.  Wide traces range from 12 to 400 mils.

                Device labels can be automatically renamed by
                location on the PCB.  Coordinate references are
                non-linear so devices will have unique labels
                regardless of placement density.  Back Annotation
                function allows Pro-Net to relabel the components on
                the schematic to conform with the PCB.

                Force traces to avoid certain areas of the PCB by
                setting Forbidden Areas.  This reserves space for
                mounting brackets and other non-electrical devices
                that mount to the board.


Pro-Board V3.0  Our top of the line automatic routing and automatic
                placement PCB layout software.  In addition to the
                features listed for Pro-Board V2.1, Version 3.0
                provides the following features:
                
                Automatic placement of all Devices.  This operation
                can be applied to every component en masse or to
                groups of components separated according to your
                needs.

                Placement Grids can limit the number of choices for
                positioning a Device.  This is used to either speed
                the placement process; restrict placement to one area
                of the PCB; or to ensure alignment on a grid larger
                than 20 or 25 mils.

                Orientation can be set to allow any or all axes for
                placement.
                
                Manually positioned parts such as goldfinger edge
                connectors, headers, and jacks can be glued in
                position so that they are not altered by the
                automatic placement algorithm.
                
                Forbidden areas force Devices to avoid space set
                aside for brackets or low clearances.

                Two automatic placement routines; optimize
                orientation and placement within a group of
                components, and optimize orientation and placement
                between groups of components.

                Autorouter provides five operational modes with ten
                trace widths, five Speed/Thoroughness settings, and
                four options for Channel Width.

                Select Nets or Devices for autorouting by area, part,
                Net, or pin, or all Nets or all unrouted Nets.
                
                Set priority rankings to specify the order that Nets
                are presented for routing.  Select by pin or Net.
                
                RipUp option increases the priority of failed Nets
                and reroutes selected Nets to increase success rate.
                
                Via Optimization analyzes routed Nets and reroutes
                to eliminate Vias and consolidate traces.

                sizes.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Prolific products work under AmigaDOS V1.3, V2, and V3.

     Pro-Board now requires 1 Meg for small projects
     and, typically, 1.5 Megs for medium to large PCBs.

     A hard disk is recommended (the library disk for Pro-Net fills
     3 disks).

     All products use integer math, so there is no loss of speed for
     systems which do not have a math coprocessor.


PRICE
