Hi Dan !
Here is the announce for Denis Gounelle's backup program "ABackup". Please
note that he wrote this announce, but since he has no direct access to the
net (his email address is in fact an alias on my Amiga), he asked me to post
it... So here it is :

TITLE
    ABackup

VERSION
    2.40

AUTHOR
    Denis Gounelle, gounelle@alphanet.ch

DESCRIPTION
    ABackup is a backup program with a lot of features, like :

    - backup to floppies or to an archive file
    - backup of several partitions in the same archive
    - full and partial backup and restore
      (you can save your favorite selections, and recall them later)
    - cyclic backup to and restore from several drives
    - optionnal data compression
    - function to rebuild catalog
    - error recovering function
      (if an error occurs while writing to the 17th disk, you won't have
      to restart from the first one)
    - High Density disks (1.76 Mb) and links (hard and soft) are supported
    - full Intuition interface, as well as "batch" mode for CLI lovers
      and automatic backups
    - true multitask program
      (a child task is created, and performs all write operations to
      floppies. This makes ABackup about 10 to 20% faster).

    The network distribution consists of French and English executables
    and documentations. It is freely redistribuable. However, to get the
    registred version, without the "shareware" requester, you have to
    send a contribution (see documentation).

NEW FEATURES
    First announcement

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    None. Works under OS 1.3, 2.04, 2.1 and 3.0.

HOST NAME
    litamiga.epfl.ch [128.178.151.32]

DIRECTORY
    /pub/amiga/gounelle/

FILE NAME
    ABackup_240.lha

DISTRIBUABILITY
    Freely distribuable (source not included). Not allowed to modify the
    archive in anyway. The registered version is NOT redistribuable.

OTHER
    The (unregistred) network distribution is fully equivalent to the
    registered version, except the "shareware" requester. If you use this
    program, don't forget to register (see documentation).
