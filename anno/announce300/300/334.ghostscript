DESCRIPTION

        GhostScript is the GNU postscript engine application.  It
        provides similar (perhaps more?) functionality than the
        programs in the post17 distribution for the Amiga (see below).
        
        Ghostscript allows your Amiga to act as a PostScript 
        interpreter.  So, even if you do not have a PostScript 
        printer, you can still process PostScript files and 
        print/display them.  The GhostScript program has many 
        device drivers for printers, modems, and bitmap formats.  
        You can tell GhostScript via command line arguments what 
        output you would like generated and whether you would 
        like it to write directly to a device, or to a scratch 
        file, or to another program (using pipes).  
        
        The distributed version of GhostScript for the Amiga 
        contains support for these output devices: 
        
             deskjet bj10e cdeskjet cdjcolor cdjmono dfaxhigh 
             dfaxlow djet500 djet500c epson eps9high epsonc 
             laserjet lbp8 ljet2p ljet3 ljetplus necp6 paintjet 
             pjetxl r4081 bit gifmono gif8 pcxmono pcx256 pbm 
             pbmraw pgm pgmraw ppm ppmraw 
             
        The last items in the list represent bitmap/pixmap 
        formats which you can display with other programs.  The 
        original GNU source code allows you to configure even 
        more devices than those listed here, but the author chose 
        to ignore devices that did not seem relevant to the Amiga 
        (e.g.  vga, svga).  Some of the included devices may not 
        be relevant but got thrown in because they compiled 
        without errors.  Refer to the GhostScript documentation 
        and sources for more information about the device drivers 
        supported by this release of Ghostscript.  

        GhostScript fonts are available from many FTP sites.  The README 
        files distributed with GhostScript give information about how to 
        get and install the fonts.  
        
        The major difference between Post and GhostScript is that 
        GhostScript provides many more output devices (I think 
        Post only supports HP laserjet and deskjet devices).  
        Also, there are quite a few more fonts available for 
        GhostScript than for Post.  One advantage that Post has 
        versus GhostScript is the ability to open a screen on the 
        Amiga display and directly display output.  GhostScript 
        has the ability to do this on platforms such as Unix 
        (X11), and MS-DOS.  There is currently no equivalent 
        Amiga facility to do this.  You must use some other 
        program to display the output on the Amiga display or 
        direct output directly to some device.  Hopefully, 
        someone will spend some time to write an Intuition 
        interface for Amiga GhostScript that could be included in 
        future releases.  

        This version of GhostScript is the same as the originally 
        distributed version of GhostScript on ftp.uu.net.  No 
        attempt was made to add functionality.  Where changes 
        were made to the source code or makefiles, it was done 
        only to fix bugs or work around incompatibilities with 
        Unix/MS-DOS versus the author's Amiga development 
        environment (gcc/dmake).  See the README.AMIGA file distributed
        with Amiga GhostScript for details.
        
        The original GNU documentation for GhostScript-2.5.2 can 
        be found in the usr:lib/ghostscript/doc directory (in the 
        original released version for the Amiga).  
        
NEW FEATURES 

        Bug fix patch for GhostScript 2.5.2.  The patch fixes 2 
        known problems with the original release and contains 
        revised README files.  
        
        The fixes are: 

        1. A workaround for the mktemp() bug in ixemul.library 
           (v39.45).  A new version of mktemp() is provided that 
           works.  This caused some drivers to fail with a 
           setdevice error and a message about not being able to 
           open the scratch file.  Hopefully, a subsequent release
           of ixemul.library will fix this problem.
           
        2. The epsonc driver has a memory allocation bug.  
           Memory is allocated, but then memory locations outside 
           the allocated segments are written to.  I have applied 
           a band-aid fix and sent mail to the author of the 
           driver for assistance.  A more permanent fix should be 
           available soon.
           

        Additional files: 

        1. A revised version of README.AMIGA.  It contains more 
           information about installing and using GhostScript on 
           the Amiga.  Hopefully, it addresses some of the 
           complaints about the original documentation.  
           
        2. A README.AMIGA.PATCH file explains about the problems 
           fixed and what files were included in the patch 
           archive.  This is also the same information as in the 
           file ghostscript-2.5.2-fix1.readme.  
           
        3. All the source code I changed to install the 
           patches.  This is for those users who might wish to 
           build GhostScript themselves.  This amounts to 2 C 
           files and a Makefile.
