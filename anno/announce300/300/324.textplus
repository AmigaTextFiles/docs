NAME

    TeXt Plus Professional V4.10

DESCRIPTION

    TeXt Plus Professional is a TeX frontend word processor. TeX is a
    professional freeware typesetting programm. The greatest problem of
    TeX for the average user was - up to now - TeX's complexity and the
    resulting difficulty to fast and efficiently create documents. This is
    where TPP starts to work.

    Now you just have to load a form sheet, which has to be modified at
    the respective places only. After this the file is compiled to a TeX-
    file by TPP, which then itself is processed by the TeX compiler. After
    both compilations either the previewer or the printer driver can be
    invoked.

    TPP cooperates with PasTeX, the freeware Amiga implementation of TeX
    written by Georg Hessmann. Among TPP's features are tables, staggered
    lists, mailmerge, footnotes, inclusion of graphics, an ARexx-port (111
    commands) and full OS2.0/3.0 compatibility. You can make use of all
    functions of TeX, even if they are not supported directly, e. g. there
    is no editor for mathematical formulae, yet.

    TPP combines its user friendliness with the typesetting power of TeX
    in order to open the world of TeX to a totally new group of users.

NEW FEATURES

    - Full support of LaTeX.
    - Automatic generation of an index with the help of MakeIndex.
    - Printing via PRT:. (TeX is not needed for this).

HARD- AND SOFTWARE-REQUIREMENTS

    - Amiga OS 2.04
    - at least. 2 MB RAM
    - at least. 10 MB hard disk space
    - PasTeX V1.3

    from 2.xx/3.xx to 4.10.
