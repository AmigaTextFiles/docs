TITLE
	OmniPlay - A multi-format sound player for AmigaDOS

VERSION
	1.231, 31 Jan 1993

DESCRIPTION
	OmniPlay plays samples sounds from a variety of sound file
	formats, including IFF-8SVX, AIFF, WAV, VOC, .au, .snd,
	and 8-bit raw (signed, unsigned, u-law).  In addition,
	PowerPacked sounds can be played if you have v34+ of
	powerpacker.library installed.

	OmniPlay determines the type of sound it's dealing with
	automagically,  so the minimum command is "oplay somesound".
	This works on *any* file, although raw files might sound
	better if you specify a rate.

	Options control rate, volume, output audio channel, wait-time
	between sounds, process priority, printing of sound properties
	(such as IFF NAME, AUTH, etc.), and more.  Options are
	sequenced, not pre-scanned, so two files can have different
	option sets.  One option even writes the audio data played
	into an IFF-8SVX file, so technically oplay is a converter as
	well as a player.

REQUIREMENTS
	A sampled sound file.  If you wish to PowerPack sounds, you
	should have powerpacker.library (not included) in your libs:
	directory.

CHANGES
	(since v1.231)
	- Memory deallocation bug fixed; all memory is now returned.
	- '-w' option fixed; timeout is measured in 1/50 seconds.
	- '-R' option added.  Allows sounds to be played any number of
	  times in succession.
	- Documentation rewritten in AmigaGuide format.
