DESCRIPTION

        Arn is a newsreader for USENET/UUCP messages to use with
        Amiga UUCP installations (CNews and derivates or AmigaUUCP D).

        Arn is a fast newsreader which allows you to select groups and
        articles individually. It uses small databases (2% of newsvolume)
        for providing fast overviews over articles. It's simliar to the
        well known UN*X 'nn'-newsreader, but its no ported software.

        It offers much functionality to the user and is well configurable
        (runs with nearly all UUCP-installations). Especially when you have
        a lot of newsgroups and articles Arn is a good choice, because other
        newsreaders hold all their information in memory, but Arn tries to
        use as little as possible.
        Arn has a new scheme for managing newsgroups, which makes
        subscription and unsubscription easy.

        Arn is completely controllable via the keyboard. Intuition/mouse
        support is planned for further versions, but it has the advantage
        of working via serial ports.

        Features:

        * table overview over newsgroups and articles

        * selection of groups and articles of interest

        * articles are grouped together by their subjects and then
          chronologically sorted

        * auto-selection and global/local kill-files

        * fast overview presentation of all articles by use of small
          databases

        * doesn't require much memory and is fast even with really many and
          large groups

        * configurable display of article-headers

        * built-in pager, recognizing extra long lines

        * full usage of screen sizes

        * multi-user support

        * works over the serial line (using termcap), too

        * rudimentary MIME support

NEW FEATURES

        Since the V1.00 there were some bugfixes (didn't had the time to
        make all requested enhancements bug-fixes):

        - fixed SCREENDATA bug
        - fixed quoted-printable softlinebreak bug
        - no overview-refresh if paging back/forward on first/last pages
        - unsubscribe flag 'U' overrides new flag '+'
        - compiled under SASC 6.2
        - fclose(stderr) back in code, because SAS C fixed it.
        - using $USER before $USERNAME for compatability
        - overworked CheckLibMarks() and NewMark() routine
        - removed the need for a _sorted_ active-file. Arn reads
          unsorted active-files, too, but you may loose performance.
        - removed CMDCLEARKLUDGE, because it caused more problems than
          the original C=-bug.
        - created smakefile for source-distribution
        + using QueryOverScan to get screen-sizes
        - changed Execute() into system(), so no EOF is needed
          if calling editor.
        - followup and reply work with encoded postings, too.
        - ArnMaster was compiled without optimization, so it wont
          produce inconsistent databases.

        Naturally, UUCP software is required for getting news.
        This can be CNews, wCNews or AmigaUUCP 1.16D for example.
        CNews/wCNews have an advantage over AmigaUUCP by providing an
        "active"-file, which lets ArnMaster build its databases
        faster (no scanning for new articles needed).

        Arn should work on any Amiga model. OS2.04 or higher is
        recommended, because a few functions are only available
        with this OS-versions. Nevertheless it should work with
        Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3, too.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

        Arn is copyrighted software! Arn is (c)opyrighted by Roland Bless.
        You can distribute it unchanged for free (charging no more than the
        usual copying fee). It is allowed to upload it on commercial dialup
        services like BIX, Compuserve etc.
        Because UN*X newsreaders are free, too, Arn is no explicit sharware,
        but you if you really enjoy it, you _can_ send a contribution.
        It is forbidden to distribute a changed source!
