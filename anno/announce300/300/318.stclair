ST. CLAIR DESIGNS AND PACKAGES 
INDUSTRY LEADER KIOSK SYSTEMS

(West Chester, PA -- January 4, 1993) St. Clair Interactive
Communications today announced that they have developed a line of
NEW, HIGH PERFORMANCE interactive, multimedia kiosk systems. These
custom packaged, turnkey models are standardized and tailored for retail
markets at a price level that sets them apart as an industry leader. 

St. Clair Interactive Communications is a full service company that has
been developing custom, multimedia information systems, commonly known
as kiosks, for the last ten years. Their new line of three standardized
interactive kiosk systems are designed to be flexible, exceptionally
cost-effective and easy to use while maintaining the highest level of
performance. Unlike many other systems in the market today, these
kiosks are custom designed by one source that includes a team of
professional specialists in the specified retail markets AND are packaged
as a turnkey product at an extremely competitive price level. 

St. Clair is also pleased to announce that they have selected Commodore
Business Machine's Amiga as the computer component for their three new,
innovative turnkey systems. With the inclusion of the Amiga system, each
one of these kiosk models has multimedia capabilities that can exceed
other industry standards. They include quality digital audio, exquisite
graphics and multimedia capabilities that are all designed for mass market
retail applications. 

Included in each system is the kiosk equipment, software and the
interactive multimedia program. The Basic unit includes a simple
enclosure, digitized and painted graphics with 50 custom graphics screens,
animation and audio, plus authoring and run time software. This basic
unit is best suited for tourist and visitor centers, store information,
corporate and employee directories. In quantities of 100, this system is
available at an MSRP of $2,850. 

The Deluxe system is based on a high speed multimedia computer which
includes a 32bit processor, 100 MB hard drive, a touch screen, digitized
and painted animation using 256,000 color pictorial graphics, stereo digital
audio, text, an upgraded enclosure, modem and communications software
capabilities. This model is targeted for P.O.P. couponing, vendor
merchandising, customer service, real estate, ticketing and reservations
applications. In quantities of 100, this system is available at an MSRP of
$5,500.

The Premier system includes all the features of the deluxe system plus a
faster processor, 10 MB RAM, 100 MB Hard Drive and full motion video
from the hard drive. In addition, there is a printer, graphics processors, a
central control panel for remote updating for graphics, audio, video and
text. Applications for this system include fashion merchandising, travel,
product catalogs and corporate communications. In quantities of 100, this
system is available at an MSRP of $9,600.

"The interactive information market is exploding. With the number of
retail kiosk applications expanding rapidly, we anticipate sizeable growth.
We especially feel confident that our custom developed, professional
systems with full service networks far exceed the present industry
standards in content, operational and multimedia capabilities. Plus, these
custom packaged systems are complete turnkey kiosks from just one
source AND are one of the best price/performance systems in the
industry," commented H. Douglas Peter, president, St. Clair Interactive
Communications. 

"We are also pleased to announce that we have chosen the Commodore
Amiga as the exceptional multimedia computer component. The Amiga's
quality digital audio, digital video and multitasking capabilities
tremendously enhance each system's delivery performance. We know this
from experience since St. Clair has already developed and installed
successfully running multimedia kiosks that incorporate the Amiga. Some
of these prestigious installations include The Logan Airport,
Massachusetts; K Mart Coupon Centers; and The National Auto League in
Ontario, Canada," added Doug Peter.

Commodore Business Machines, Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is the
U.S. subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company
manufactures and markets a complete line of Amiga computers and
peripherals for the business, consumer, education and government
markets. The company's worldwide installed Amiga user base is presently
