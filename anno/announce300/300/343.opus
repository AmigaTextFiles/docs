        Directory OPUS 4.0: More Versatile, Infinitely Customizable

(____)NOVAtronics announces Directory OPUS 4.0, a major revision of their
best-selling Amiga disk and file management utility. Along with A4000 and
A1200 compatibility, increased audio/image file support, and many other new
features, Directory OPUS 4.0 is now more intuitive, more helpful and more
flexible than before. You can even completely re-configure the interface to
suit the way you want to use the program.

Graphics Compatibility, Improved File Support, Other New Features

Directory OPUS 4.0 now supports all Amiga graphics hardware, including the
AGA and AA chipsets used in the Amiga 4000 and Amiga 1200. Graphics and Audio
support have also been expanded. Now you can use Directory OPUS 4.0 to play
Anim and Anim Brush files, or view images saved in all ILBM formats. You can
also play sound files stories as Noisetracker, SoundTrackers, ProTracker, and
MED w/MIDI, Oktalyzer, 8SVX or Raw Data.

Together with expanded ARexx support (now over 100 commands), Directory OPUS
now has a convenient Hotkey feature for launching any Amiga application from
the keyboard, so long as OPUS is either running or iconified. (Amiga-D, for
example, could be set to launch DeluxePaint.)

Directory OPUS 4.0 now also lets you print individual frames from full screen
and brush animations. Also new: a new Font View facility that lets you print
out an entire alphabet of any font you select, including Amiga and
Compugraphic Bitmap fonts under Kickstart 2.04 and beyond.

Other new features include improved documentation, players for CanDo decks,
and a completely revised approach to using system resources. Instead of
loading the entire program at once, OPUS now runs individual functions as
they are called for. This not only reduces demands on system RAM, it gives
users a way to access individual program features directly from the CLI,
without ever having to load Directory OPUS.

Infinitely Configurable, More Easily Configurable

Directory OPUS 4.0 is now very user-configurable, meaning that you can
optionally modify the interface to suit your needs or personal preference.
You could, for example, configure as many buttons or add as many actual or
virtual devices as you'd like, modify the size of each directory window, or
minimize the program so that only one, or two or three rows of buttons are
visible. Directory OPUS 4.0 now lets you select any screen font for use in
any part of the interface. You can also filter the files you see displayed --
such as only file names that match the DOS pattern "#?.doc."

Configuring OPUS to meet your needs is a lot easier than you might expect,
thanks to an extensive new configuration system that gives instant on-line
assistance for whatever you need to do. For instance, if you are in the
middle of attaching an AmigaDOS command to an onscreen button, you could
instantly call up a list of executable command names. Whatever you're doing
in OPUS, help is always close at hand. And (under AmigaDOS 2.0) configuring
buttons to run programs also got easier; just drag any program icon over any
OPUS button, and release!

We Didn't Kill a Good Friend

Most important, the new features added to Directory OPUS 4.0 won't put off
users of previous versions for day-to-day tasks -- like formatting floppy
disks, copying or deleting files, viewing directory lists, viewing image,
text and HEX files, or playing sound files.

"We didn't kill off an old friend," says Tim Martin, the new president of
INOVAtronics. "Many upgrades make changes that kill the usability that made
people like the program in the first place. With Directory OPUS 4.0, we
solved this problem by making everything optional, and by making it extremely
easy for OPUS owners to use any or all of the new features they want. Despite
all the changes," Tim says, "OPUS will remain the most useful tool on your
Amiga computer."

New Price and Upgrade Policy

Directory OPUS 4.0 carries a new retail price of $99.95, and will be
available after December 4, 1992. Registered owners of Directory OPUS version
3.4 or later can upgrade for $40, plus $5 for shipping and handling. If you
own a version of Directory OPUS prior to 3.4, the upgrade is $50, plus $5
shipping and handling. Directory OPUS 4.0 works with any Amiga with one
Megabyte of RAM or better, running any version of Kickstart.
