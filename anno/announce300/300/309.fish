Subject: Disks 781-790 now available
Status: RO

Disks 781-790 are now available.  Shipping to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by Monday (28-Dec-92).

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

	Fred Fish
	Catalog Disk Requests
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, Arizona  85284
	USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other sort of
	proprietary material included, since I then have to go examine
	each file to decide if it is distributable or not, and if not,
	what effect removing it might have.  Unless the material is
	particularly interesting, I frequently just toss such disks
	into the recycling bin.

2.	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my disks.  I.E,
	place all files related to a particular submission under a single
	directory on the disk.  If there is more than one submission per
	disk, place each submission in its own directory.

3.	Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing that
	summarizes your submission.  It should be about 3-10 lines, and
	include the current version number, the version and disk number
	of the most recent version (if any) that was last included in the
	library, whether or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from its sub-
	directory and if necessary, supply a script runnable from workbench
	(via :c/xicon or c:iconx) that makes all necessary assigns, copies
	fonts and libraries, etc.

5.	Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient padding.

Thanks!!!

PowerSnap	A utility that allows you to use the mouse to mark characters
		anywhere on the screen, and then paste them somewhere else,
		such as in another CLI or in a string gadget.  Checks what
		font is used in the window you snap from and will look for
		the position of the characters automatically.  Recognizes all
		non-proportional fonts of up to 24 pixels wide and of any
		height.  Works with AmigaDOS 2.0 in both shell and WorkBench
		environments.  This is version 2.1b, an update to version 2.0
		on disk 726.  Binary only.

		for programmers, macros, undo, wordwrap, supports foldings,
		has an online help mode, and many other features.  TKEd is re-
		entrant and can be made resident.  It's Kickstart 1.3/2.04
		compatible, supports the new ECS-screenmodes, an application

		Author:  Udo Schuermann


CONTENTS OF DISK 784
--------------------

BindNames	A solution to the problem of having to continually edit
		your startup-sequence to add assignments for logical variables
		when you add a new program.  BindNames will read one or more
		files in a special directory and then create all the logical
		assignments at once and it can figure out dependencies, so it
		doesn't matter how you order the entries in the file(s).  It
		will create directories that it can't find, such as RAM:Env
		and RAM:T and will generate warnings for assignments that it
		can't resolve.  Version 1.0, includes source, public domain.
		Author:  Dave Haynie

DirKing		A very powerful replacement for the AmigaDOS 'List' and 'Dir'
		commands.  It gives full control on the format of the directory
		listing and what information should be printed.  The directory
		can be sorted on any field, or on several fields in the order
		you want.  Supports many filters, such as name and date, and
		the filters can be made effective on files only, directories
		only or on both.  You can also define a pattern for each level
		of the directory tree.  Has an LFORMAT option which is useful
		for generating scripts.  A unique feature is the ability to
		monitor the scanning process.  English version supplied,
		German, French and Dutch versions available from the author.
		Version 2.10, shareware, binary only.
		Author:  Chris Vandierendonck

Lyapunovia	A mindboggingly colorful program that makes pictures from a
		simple mathematical formula.  (And it's NOT Mandelbrot!)
		Lyapunovia pictures vary from colorful candy to mean metal
		(or something), offering you everything you ever wanted in
		visual representation of abstract nothings...  This freely
		redistributable version of Lyapunovia has been thoroughly
		tested to work on all Amigas.  Special registered versions
		with precision-extension, optimized for bigger CPUs, and
		support of WB 2.0/2.1 and WB 3.0 displaymodes (all 256 colors)
		are available.  Version 1.0, binary only.
		Author:  Jesper Juul


CONTENTS OF DISK 785

FileStorage	Small demo of a file librarian, a database for files.  The
		database exists as a number of index files and disks where
		FileStorage puts your collection of files.  FileStorage
		'remembers' how many free bytes each storage disk has and
		tries to fill the disks to the maximum.  For each file you
		can add a 320 character long description and set 16 different
		(user definable)  filetypes.   Searching / adding / deleting /
		changing it's all there!  Version 1.2, binary only.
		Author:  Joep Grooten

		itself.  SeePix features an ARP interface, Iconization and the
		PathMaster File Selector.  Manx AZTEC "C" Source included.
		Author:  Hank Schafer

Showgerb	A Gerber display program.  Gerber plotfiles are generated by

		several sample plotfiles.  Version 1.00, binary only,
		shareware.
		Author:  Paul Gill

		give the elapsed time in ticks, seconds or in the normal hh:mm:
		ss format.  Version 1.21, freeware, binary only.
		Author:  Chris Vandierendonck

UCD		A utility for changing the current directory.  It scans a disk

Macro		A small utility that records a sequence of keypresses that can
		be recalled at any time.  Handy for "on the fly" recording
