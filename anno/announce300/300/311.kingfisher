Subject: NEW RELEASE:  KingFisher v1.15
Status: RO


  Available via anonymous ftp is version 1.15 of KingFisher, fixing all
  bugs (including a problem with national characters the presence of which
  could lockup the program.)  Version 1.15 also adds a number of features,
  such as FirstFish/LastFish gadgets.

  General overview of KingFisher:

  KingFisher is a freely distributable replacement for Aquarium, providing
  a mechanism to search for software in Fred Fish's Library of Freely
  Distributable Software.  KingFisher has been designed for users of both
  floppy-only and harddisks systems operating under either Kickstart 1.3
  or Kickstart 2.0.  Some features are available only under Kickstart 2.0.

  KingFisher v1.15 offers the following features:

  - Maintains a split database across multiple disk volumes,
  - Searches this database more than 3 times faster than Aquarium,
  - Provides a small and very fast program name search index,
  - Adds new fish directly from Contents files or Usenet postings,
    even from multiple concatenated postings or email contents files,
  - Fish can be deleted from the end of the database to undo errors,
  - Database is a line-oriented text file accessed through index
    which can be modified by hand and then reindexed,
  - Flexible print and export functions, including search-filtered
    output,
  - Select from multiple different search strings,
  - Limit searches to a portion of the database,
  - Follow version links to older or newer versions of software,
  - Maintain multiple different "bookmarks" into the database and
    switch between them with a single mouse click,
  - Supports proportional and scalable fonts for description text,
  - Now supports the 2.0 display database including Text Overscan.
    Limited support for overscan, PAL, and interlace displays is
    available under 1.3.
  - String gadgets are optionally kept active for keyboard comfort,
  - Full configuration saved between executions,
  - Iconifies to save Chip RAM (46K).

This update does not include a database.  To obtain the database you must
obtain a file named KingFisher.lha which is 477691 bytes in size, or obtain
version 1.11 (the version from the Fish Disks.)  KingFisher115.lha is 75809
bytes in size.

KingFisher115.lha can be found at the following ftp sites:

wuarchive.wustl.edu	128.252.135.4	   /systems/amiga/incoming/fish
grind.isca.uiowa.edu	128.255.19.233	   /amiga/Read.These         (*)
ux1.cso.uiuc.edu	128.174.5.59	   /pub/amiga/KingFisher     (*)

(*) May take a little time for KingFisher115.lha to show up there.
