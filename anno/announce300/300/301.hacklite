AUTHOR

     Hack Lite is an evolved version of the public domain game Hack, by
     Jay Fenlason, Andries Brouwer, Don Kneller and various others.
     Hack Lite was developed by Alan Beale.  E-mail address:
     ponds!squink!biljir@dg-rtp.dg.com

     Utilities included with Hack Lite were written by Jim Cooper and
     Doug Walker.

DESCRIPTION

     Hack Lite is a dungeon adventure game in the style of Rogue, Hack,
     Moria, etc.  It uses a customizable graphical dungeon display.  The
     package includes a simple-to-use installation program, and a
     "Preferences"-style configuration editor.

     Plays great!  Less killing!

NEW FEATURES

     Many new objects, traps, monsters and ways to die have been added.

     Saved games are now much smaller.

     "Tournament mode" allows several players to compete for the highest
     score playing in identical dungeons.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The distribution includes two versions of the game: a full version
     and a limited version.  The full version requires a meg of RAM.  The
     limited version will run in 512K, but of necessity many features are
     not present in this version.

     Hack Lite is compatible with AmigaDOS 1.3 and 2.0, and with both
     NTSC and PAL.
