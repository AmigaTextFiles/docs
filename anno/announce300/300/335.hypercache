PRESS RELEASE  [FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE]   JANUARY 29, 1993

FROM:	  David Plummer, President
		  SILICON PRAIRIE SOFTWARE

RE  :   HyperCache Professional v1.01 Now Available
        (Upgrade information follows for v1.0 owners)

HyperCache Professional is a filesystem and device accelerator for the
Amiga series of personal computers.  It greatly improves the performance
of all AmigaDOS compatible storage devices, including hard drives, floppies,
CD-ROMs, optical floppies, and removable SCSI devices.  Performance 
increases of up to 2200% are attainable via HyperCache's intelligent
sector caching algorithms, and its ability to anticipate the demands placed
upon the storage devices attached to your Amiga.  In fact, its fast enough
to accelerate some RAM disks!

>From a technical standpoint, HyperCache Pro is an "N-way associative
look-ahead line cache system" for any block-accessible device.  It employs
a method of cache preservation based on the LRU algorithm, which is 
normally used on mini- and mainframe computers for high-performance
virtual memory systems.  HyperCache also provides a configurable sector
prefetch that can increase performance even when data is read for the
first time.

HyperCache can provide these benefits on all Amiga models.  It is compatible
with all KickStart versions 1.2 through 3.0, and works well with the new
DCFS system and IDE controllers.  It is compatible with Commodore and third-
party SCSI, ST-506, XT-IDE, AT-IDE, and several other interface technologies.
512K RAM is required, although 1M is recommended.  

Filesystem performance on a HyperCache-equipped A500 can exceed that of
a stock A3000, while sustained read speeds for the A4000 can jump to more
than 5 megabytes per second.  Owners of the new IDE equipped systems will
appreciate the workstation-like performance not normally attainable with the 
restrictive IDE controllers.

While HyperCache provides unmatched benefits for BBS operators, developers,
and video professionals, even the novice user will appreciate the speed
with which windows open and reopen, programs load, and file operations
take place.  HyperCache provides these benefits through both the Shell
and Workbench interfaces.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.01

 - The data-transfer algorithm has been completely re-written, providing
	an average speed increase of 37% over version 1.00
 - The caching system has been optimized for use with OFS, FFS, and MSDOS
	filesystems in particular.
 - New cache summary information, such as device information.
 - A new utility (HCSummary) is included to provide information on all 
	currently active instanced of HyperCache on the system.
 - The sector preservation algorithm has been improved to provide a better
	overall hit ratio, thus giving higher performance.
