[confidential to moderator - I am discussing with our SYSOP the
possiblity of myself and another student moderating the group. I don't
know how this will come out, since he is worried about being held
responcible, but if he does agree, I'll send another announcement. Any
ideas on good reasons that I can put forward as to the re-creation of
the site? (I kinda expect some resistance.. Anyway, if it does come
about, I'll send in another announcement. 
For the time being, though, this is the current situation. - Addison]

   The Amiga FTP site at HUBCAP (hubcap.clemson.edu) has been deleted, after
the discovery of a "pirate" directory. 

   Due to the possible liability concerns, the entire directory has been
deleted. In an e-mail message, the sysop said that he thought that
wuarchive will pick up the files that used to be in the HUBCAP directory. 
   There was discussion on this in the comp.sys.amiga.graphics, but I no
longer have the name of the person coordinating the effort.

   He has requested funds to restart the site, with a moderator, but
with the current budget, it seems unlikely.

Appended is the README message from the archive, written by the sysop:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can thank the scum hackers of the world for the deletion of the
public amiga directory here.

Seems they had a hidden directory called 
/usr/spool/ftp/pub/amiga/incoming/program.tools/".ami "  that they
were using to move stolen software around the Internet. They are using
lots of other places besides hubcap, anyplace they can find with public 
write turned on, it seems. Don't be surprised if you find lots of
your favorite sites closed down.

You know, my mom used to be able to stand on the corner, at night, in DC,
with her arms full of shopping bags, waiting for the bus... oh nevermind.
