  OFFICE MEMO          Textra v1.13 Announcement              Date:1/25/93
Hi, Dan.  I recently (Jan 9) released Textra 1.13 to GEnie and
some BBS's local to the SF Bay Area, but do not have FTP
access.

I tried not to "ramble", but it has been almost a year since
the last release.

Thanx.

DESCRIPTION

     Textra is the User-Friendly text editor for the Amiga.
     It contains a fully-Intuitionized GUI as well as an
     ARexx interface with 45+ commands.  The package
     interfaces with the WB2.0+ asl font requester,
     supports multiple windows and cut, copy, paste
     between them.  Undo and Drag-select with left mouse
     button is also supported.  User-settable preferences
     which can be saved are included.  The editor displays
     fast text and continuous-movement vertical and
     horizontal scroll bars.

     The package contains full, detailed documentation,
     25+ Arexx scripts (including an interactive tutorial)
     and a hard disk installer program.

NEW FEATURES

     v1.13 can display each window in a different font.
     Also, both print jobs and ARexx scripts may be
     executed in the background.  v1.13 sports many more
     user-settable preferences than earlier versions.
     Textra's ARexx scripts are nestable... they can call
     other Textra ARexx scripts.  This version adds HSPascal
     as another programming environment which Textra
     can serve as an "integrated editor" (in addition to
     to JForth).  The interactive tutorial ARexx script and
     the hard disk installer program are also new.  Many
     subtler enhancements and bug fixes are noted in the
     complete change history.
