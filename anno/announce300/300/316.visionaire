Sorry, we forgot to say that we are independent programmers, and the
authors of Visionaire (me, Bruno Costa, and Lucia Darsa). Impulse is
publishing and marketing the software. Here follows the hopefully fixed
announcement, and thanks for being so prompt:

---------------------------- cut here ----------------------------------

                       Visionaire Demo Version
                       -----------------------

Visionaire is the newest and most powerful morphing and image warping
software for the Amiga.  Visionaire is published by Impulse, Inc, the
well known publisher of quality Amiga software like Imagine.
Visionaire and the Visionaire Demo were created by Bruno Costa &
Lucia Darsa.

The Demo version is freely distributable as long as it is kept in its
original form, including all the support files. It is currently
available using anonymous FTP from amiga.physik.unizh.ch, as the file
/amiga/biz/demo/VisionaireDemo.lha, and also on many other aminet sites
which mirror amiga.physik.unizh.ch.

The fully featured version of Visionaire is available NOW from:

     Impulse, Inc.
     8416 Xerxes Ave. North
     Minneapolis, MN 55444

     (612) 425-0557
     FAX: (612) 425-0701


We have provided the Visionaire demo version upon request from many
potential users that would like to feel and see Visionaire's user
interface.  Visionaire is fun to use, allowing you to quickly create
simple morphings.  At the same time it is a powerful and versatile
software, so that you will be able to create effects just as complex as
those you've seen in movies and commercials.  Visionaire was created by
computer graphics professionals, with computer graphics professionals
in mind.

The demo version will enable you to test *all* the features of
Visionaire, including the creation of animations, output for the newest
AGA chip set, and 24bit rendering.  Of course, as this is a demo
version, a few things must be disabled.

Note that Visionaire *requires* Workbench 2.04 or greater, and at least
1.5Mb of free memory (3Mb are recommended for full performance).

An animation created using some of Visionaire's more complex features,
like alpha channels and background compositing, is currently available
through anonymous ftp from amiga.physik.unizh.ch as the file
/amiga/gfx/anim/DrinkMorph.lha.


Some of Visionaire Features:
----------------------------

- Morphing, Warping and Dissolving;

- Range of effects is limited only by your imagination;

- Morphing and Warping using animations as input (to create warpings
  and morphings of moving subjects, like in the "Black or White" clip);

- Color and Shape Mixers give total visual control over the progress of
  the warping or morphing, limited only by your imagination;

- Exclusive Local Color and Shape Mixers allow the warping or morphing
  of different parts of the images at different times (a *must* for
  professional results!);

- Sophisticated 2 level antialiasing, the best for dramatic deformations;

- The best and most complete alpha channel support, for transparencies
  and background compositing;

- Image cache scheme that avoids unnecessary loading of images from disk;

- Full support for the AGA chip set new modes;

- Support for 24-bit displays and single-frame video tape recorders.

- Unlimited Undo/Redo capability;

- Full support for Workbench 2.0 and beyond, including ARexx, special
  display modes and public and auto-scrolling screens;

- Intuitive, easy-to-use user interface, including an Expert Mode;

- Full Image Zoom in and out, that makes it easy to work on image
  details -- proportional gadgets and arrow keys (or in fact, any other
  key) allow you to move over the image;

- Fully configurable keyboard shortcuts and macros;

- Completely customizable with many preferences-like requesters.

- Includes predefined ARexx macros that allows you to create special
  effects without knowing anything about ARexx.

- Includes ready-to-use effects such as Sphere, Wave and Twirl, and
  you can easily create your own effects, too. The effects are
  naturally integrated with the rest of the package, and can be
  combined with all the other features.

- Comprehensive 180 page user and reference manual, including
  many tutorials and examples, and also a reference for all menus,
  requesters and ARexx commands.
