Subject: Post V1.86enh announcement
Date: Sun, 14 Feb 1993 13:47:09 EST

Hi!  I sent along an announcement for Post 1.86enh, but have not seen it
posted to comp.sys.amiga.announce.  If you have not yet posted it to this
newsgroup, I have a couple corrections:

(1) The aminet sites put the archives in /amiga/text/print (or
/aminet/text/print)
(2) The archive names were shrunk down by the folks at amiga.physik, no doubt
to preserve the directory listing formatting.  The new file names are
Post186enh_min.lha
Post186enh_bin.lha
Post186enh_src.lha

If the announcement posting never arrived at announce@cs.ucdavis.edu, please
let me know.

Thank you.
