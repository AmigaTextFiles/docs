Below is the general announcement for NetHack 3.1:


                NetHack 3.1 -- General information

NetHack 3.1 is a new generation of the dungeon exploration game NetHack.
It is a distant descendent of Hack, and a direct descendent of NetHack 3.0.
It is the product of two years of very intensive effort by the NetHack
Development Team and its porting sub-teams.  Many parts of 3.0 were
rewritten for NetHack 3.1, and many new features were added.

There are a number of dramatic new additions or changes in the game:

A general "mythology" was adopted for the game.  The various tasks in the
game are now articulated in the context of that mythology, and this gives
the game a greater coherence and unity.

The dungeon design was changed.  Unlike the linear form of the dungeon in
3.0, the dungeon in 3.1 is tree-structured, with dungeons that branch off
the "main" dungeon.  These branch-dungeons have each unique features which
distinguish them from one another.  As a part of this new design, a dungeon
"compiler" was added, which enables some control of the game's dungeon
design from a data file.  A goal for the future is making that control
complete.

The special levels facility of the game was greatly enhanced.  It is now
highly versatile, and we took advantage of its extended capacity to add many
new special levels.

The game's display code was completely re-written.  The display is now based
on a line-of-sight principle.  It is much more efficient than the old
display code, and a lot more interesting.

Intelligent creatures in the game can now wear armor, and they can wield
and use weapons in combat.  They can also use wands, spells, and throw
objects.  This must be taken into consideration in choosing a game strategy.

We sought to increase the differences between the various character
classes, so as to make playing each of them a distinct experience.  To this
end, special character-specific tasks and dungeons were introduced into the
game.

These are some of the most prominent global changes.  But there are many
other changes in the game, and they are not less dramatic.  To mention just
a few:  The shop code was revised.  Shopkeepers are smarter, and they know
how to repair damage to their shop.  The endgame is now a multi-level
dungeon, full of surprises.  The artifact code was rewritten, and gaining
access to the Amulet of Yendor requires the coordinated use of special
artifacts.  Many new creatures and objects were added to the game.  We leave
it to you to discover the rest for yourselves.

We dedicate the game to the many players of 3.0, with special note of those
who communicated with us and contributed their ideas to the development of
this new version.

                  -- Good luck, and happy Hacking --

(for the Amiga NetHack Team)
