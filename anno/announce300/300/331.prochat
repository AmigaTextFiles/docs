> That's fine, but you should be more specific.

Yes, the friend is the author and he doesn't have an e-mail address.
Well, if you don't use fidonet gateway anyway.. Anyone with questions
can find out how to use fidonet gateways. At least that would be better
than mailing me (I will forward the mail, but..).

> Also, you sent the message to announce@iris.cs.ucdavis.edu.

Sorry, I just peeked into the mail aliases file.. I will send a message
to the postmaster so that he can correct the moderator-address..

DESCRIPTION
     ProChat is a sysop-chat for the Dialog bulletin board systems.
     It doesn't work with any other system.
 
     ProChat can be used when the sysop of a BBS and the user of the BBS
     want to chat. Unlike normal sysop-chats, ProChat is much more
     convenient to use. ProChat opens two 'windows', which are used as
     individual screens for the sysop and the user. Both writers can write
     simultaneously to their own windows and a text written by one user
     is immediately readable to the other user. And this really means
     immediately, not after pressing return. ProChat moves the cursor
     between 'windows' very fast updating both of them at the same time.
     This may sound slow but it isn't.
 
     Of course, there are many other nice features like word-wrapping,
     redrawing of the screen, clearing of the window, beeping...
 
     All texts output by ProChat can be changed easily. Each text is
     in its own file so it's possible to use ANSI-editors if you want.
     No more language problems !
 
     A separate program called ProChatConfigEditor is used to change other
     configurable things. It is very easy to use with GadTools user
     interface. With the ProChatConfigEditor you can, for example, set
     a CLI-command which is executed when someone is calling/yelling
     the sysop. If you want that the ProChat asks for a chat-reason from
     the user and shows it when the user is calling you (easy to decide is
     it worth answering). You can also forbid calling for char at certain
     hours of a day.
 
NEW FEATURES
     The whole program is reprogrammed.
 
     Here are some of the new features:
 
         - More configurable and easier to configure
         - Uses user's rows and columns variables, the size of a sysop's
           screen, the size of a font etc. to open a window which is
           biggest possible to both users.
         - Faster
         - More system-friendly, a window has a close and zip gadgets and
           takes less CPU-time.
 
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
     Requires version 2.0 of the OS. I haven't had a chance to test if
     V36 is a new enough.
 
     The Dialog BBS made by TelePro Technologies.
