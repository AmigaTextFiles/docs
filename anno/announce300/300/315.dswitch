DESCRIPTION
 
        DSwitch is a shell command for controlling DCTV video.
        It allows the user to toggle video pass-thru on/off along
        with selecting a few experimental modes.  Can be used to
        control interactive presentations where a mix of Amiga
        video (or any other composite source) and DCTV encoded
        pictures/animations is needed.  Also, it prevents the user
        from having to switch cables to check the Video Input to
        the DCTV unit.
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
        AmigaDos 1.2 or later.
