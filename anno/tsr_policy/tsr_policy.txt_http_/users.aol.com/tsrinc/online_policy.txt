     The TSR Internet Policy Revisited     Ever since TSR first introduced its Internet policy, there has been a grumble of disapproval over the net.  While the policy was meant to be aplain-English translation of how to avoid infringing TSR's copyrights andtrademarks, some saw it as a strong-arm tactic.  In an effort to clear upthis misconception, what follows is some detailed information concerningwhat can and cannot be done with TSR property.     WHAT IS PROTECTED?     All of TSR's copyrighted material (including characters and theirdistinctive likenesses, unique magical items, monsters, artifacts,artwork, and other material) cannot be used in personally publishedmaterials unless the personally published materials are stored only onTSR-approved sites (MPG-Net (ftp.  mpgn.  com), America Online, andGEnie).     WHAT YOU CAN POST ON APPROVED SITES     The current TSR-approved sites are: ftp.mpgn.com; America Online;GEnie.  You are allowed to post anything using TSR's copyrights, including:     1.) New monsters, spells, etc.  including all of the pertinent game         information (AC, HD, casting times, etc.).     2.) Computer programs that you have created for the game.     3.) Complete adventures that utilize all of the AD&D game mechanics.     4.) Short stories and other written works set in a TSR campaign         world.     TSR reserves the right to delete material that is morallyunacceptable.     WHAT YOU CAN POST OUTSIDE OF APPROVED SITES     You are free to post the following types of information on the net:     1.) An index of spells, monsters, races, classes, etc., tellingwhere they can be found in TSR's products.     Example: Melf's Acid Arrow, 2nd level conjuration (Page 186 of theRev. PHB).     2.) Generic adventures that reference typical fantasy creatures found in most fantasy RPG's ("This room contains three Skeletons").     A solution: Create your adventure just like a module that TSRproduces, including all of the pertinent information like AC, THAC0, etc.Post it on an approved site.  Then make an advertisement for your moduleand post it on the net along with where it can be found.     3.) New Spells and creatures that you have created, described in ageneral manner, so that they can be used in any fantasy RPG (don'tdescribe them in AD&D game terms like THAC0, AC, etc.).     4.) Short stories, novels, and other written works that do not drawon specific TSR worlds, characters, monsters, etc.  (generic fantasy).     WHAT YOU CAN'T POST ANYWHERE     Text and artwork that has been copied from TSR products.  Forexample, you can't make a text version of the Revised Player's Handbookavailable.  This would include items like an electronic index of spells,with all the spell information from the Revised Player's Handbook.     WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USING AND REFERENCING TSR MATERIAL?     Use of copyrighted material means that you are building somethingaround an established TSR creation.  For example, writing an adventurearound the drow, creating a subclass of psionicist, or creating a list ofunique spells of the FORGOTTEN REALMS(R) world are all examples of using a TSR materials.  You're free to create such works, but you can only release them to your personal gaming group or on official TSR-approved sites.     Referencing a copyrighted work or trademark is just that, areference.  For example, a statement that "this adventure can be easilyadapted for the AD&D(R) game" is acceptablr.  A reference to TSR materialdoes not limit where you may distribute your original creation.  Ofcourse, you're still free to distribute original works throughTSR-approved sites.  And, of course, you cannot reference TSR trademarksin a manner that is likely to cause confusion about your relationship toTSR.     PROFIT     You cannot create anything that is based on TSR material and releaseit for profit.  You can't write shareware programs that use material fromTSR products (character generation software, monster random-encounterprograms, etc.) and charge for "unlocking" them, nor can you release aprogram as "begware" (begging for money for your efforts).  In short, youcan't use TSR material for monetary gain.     ELECTRONIC ACCESSORIES     If you want to distribute programs based on TSR games, you mustrelease them to a TSR-approved site (MPG-Net, America Online, or GEnie). You still can't seek payment through shareware or begware, even if you dosend them to an approved site.  In essence, you're doing this as a laborof love.  Who knows, you just might write the next generation ofrole-playing software, and TSR might decide to offer you all sorts ofincentives to write other software.  Then again, TSR might not.  Createsoftware for the same reasons that a writer writes--because the story isthere.     THE JOY OF TEXT     Adventures and short stories have done much to create the flavor andfeel of the various TSR campaign worlds.  If you've got the creative urgeto write a short story, adventure module, or gaming supplement, and youwant to make it available to the general public, there are a few things to keep in mind.     You can't base your work on a TSR game world unless you post it to aTSR-approved site.  If you want to post it anywhere else, use a genericfantasy setting or a campaign world of your own creation.     You can reference generic fantasy monsters, spells, etc.  in yourwork.  For example, you could include elves in your adventure, but notTSR's drow elves.  (Yes, the Scottish mythology includes a race calleddrow elves, but true mythological drow are not the same as TSR's drow.  If your story is about a race of elves that live underground, have dark skin, white hair, lavender eyes, worship a spider god, etc., then you areinfringing TSR's rights).     PERSONAL USE     Of course, you're free to create your own material based on theofficial AD&D materials for your personal use.  You can create a spellplanner that includes spell statistics and give it those you play AD&Dwith (no more than a dozen, realistically), write a nifty campaignsupplement for a TSR campaign world and give a copy to your gaming group,etc.  What you can't do is post a copy of it on the internet for everyoneto use (although you could upload it to a TSR-approved site, given theexceptions stated above).     Keep in mind that the internet web sites, ftp sites, and such are essentially self-publishing houses.  Whatever you upload to one of thesesites is no different than if you had went to a printing company andprinted off 10 or 10,000 copies of your post.  Legally, it makes nodifference that you're not charging for your effort.  While many players'intent is not to infringe upon TSR's intellectual property, TSR must takecertain actions to protect itself from the actions of unscrupulous peopleand other companies.     BUT I WANT TO GET PUBLISHED!     TSR offers a variety of ways for you to get your hard work published.  DRAGON(R) Magazine is always looking for up-and-coming writers tocontribute to its pages.  DUNGEON(R) Adventures is always looking forquality adventures that take place in any of TSR's campaign worlds (andworlds of your invention as well).  POLYHEDRON(R) Newszine is anothersource for your writing.     You can get a list of submission guidelines for DUNGEON and DRAGON by:     email:  TSRinc@aol.com     ftp:  ftp.mpgn.com     WWW:  http://users.aol.com/tsrinc/     Likewise, you can receive a copy of the guidelines for POLYHEDRONNewszine by contacting the RPGA at rpgahq@aol.com.     CLOSING     TSR wants you to continue to enjoy all of our game worlds, but at the same time TSR needs to protect its investment of time and money increating high-quality products from the few out there who would abuseTSR's permissions.     As TSR continues deeper into the electronic jungle, additional siteswill undoubtedly be authorized to make life on the internet even easierfor the creative minds that lurk out here.  Currently, the only internetsite available for uploads is ftp.mpgn.com.     TSR can not provide legal counsel for the internet by answering every hypothetical question on what can and cannot be done with TSR intellectual property.  Follow these guidelines and, if you're in doubt as to thelegality of what you'd like to do, post it to a TSR-approved site.     AD&D, DRAGON, DUNGEON, FORGOTTEN REALMS, and POLYHEDRON areregistered trademarks of TSR, Inc.
