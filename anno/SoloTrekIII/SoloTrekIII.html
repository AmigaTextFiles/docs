SoloTrek featured an 8X8 galaxy with six levels of play. You had no options
of alliance, you were the Federation. The graphics were minimal, but it was
still difficult to beat level six.

SoloTrek II featured a 16X16 galaxy. You could choose one of five alliances
and six difficulty levels. There were good graphics and sounds. Level six was
still almost impossible to beat, especially without a save option.

<BR>
SoloTrek III features a 20X20 main galaxy, with a 20X20 secondary galaxy. The
graphic interface has been improved and graphic display has been enhanced.
You're back to being the Federation (The Dominion War), but there's more than
enough to keep you busy as it is.
<P>
The biggest addition to the game is the module approach. The galaxy, hailing
messages, events, planets and missions are all based on external script files.
This means that new games can be developed to run on the SoloTrek III engine.
<P>
It is now possible to create modules from other SF universes and integrate
them into the SoloTrek game engine. With any luck, SoloTrek III will have at
least three modules included with the main archive.

The Galaxy
20X20 with a 20X20 linked section
<P>
The Hailing Messages
No more yes or no messages. Each hailing message appears only once in a game
session and each message can have up to four different responses. Each
response means different results.
<P>
Events
Events can now have much more dire results for your ship. As with Hailing
Messages, each Event only happens once per game session.
<P>
Planets
Along with the standard random Class M planets, specific planets dot the
galaxies. They can be either fixed, like Earth at sector 001, or randomly
placed.
<P>
Missions
No longer simple exploration and combat for you, Captain. There are several
missions to be completed as well. Some are as simple as finding a Dominion
Outpost and destroying it (The Dominion War). Some are more complex, asking
you to find items and take them to specific locations.
<P>
Starbases
Like the planets, Starbases can be randomly placed, or fixed. Just like
SoloTrek II, not all Starbases will be friendly to you.
<P>
Save Game
Praise Emperor Kayless! Finally, you don't have to take on the whole galaxy in
one sitting.
<P>
Hidden Items
Q, lovable Q, still shows up to pester you. The Borg are not going to give up
any time soon either.
<P>
Game Action
You start out with a Runabout (The Dominion War) and must work your
way up to bigger and better ships. Get your `Federation Factor' high enough
and you'll be promoted and given a new command. Or, you bloodthirsty types
can take on enemy ships to plunder them for latinum to buy new ships.
<P>
Timeline
Used to taking your time? Not any more, Space Jockey! There's a timeline
running; if you don't get the situation under control, it will get you under
its control.

Now that the editor is producing good data on enough topics, the engine itself
can be built. At this point, the Alpha stage can:
<BR>
Load RAW modules (uncompiled), Quit, Iconify, Transfer power, Show power
status, Move at impulse speeds, Scan adjacent sectors, Move at warp speed,
Scan any sector, Destroy asteroids, Destroy comets, Destroy nebulas, Repair
damage.

The timeline is running and the Dominion is playing for keeps. Grab your mouse
and get the galaxy back under control. You can even make it to the Gamma
Quadrant.

<BR>
Its the 23rd Century, an age where the future was forged! You can explore
where it all began, meet the Klingons, outwit the Romulans and get tangled
up in the Tholian Web. You can also come face to face with your counterpart
in the Mirror Universe.

<B>Borg</B> by <A HREF="mailto:2260designs@zetnet.co.uk

<BR>
The Borg have launched a third invasion of the Federation and, this time,
they're serious. They came in hordes, descending on the Cardassians and the
Ferengi, leaving only a trail of destruction. Starfleet is desperate. Your
orders are simple:
<BR>
Take care of the Borg threat, by any means neccesary.

<B>Voyager</B> by <A HREF="mailto:2260designs@zetnet.co.uk

Voyager is lost in space. It's your job to guide her home in one piece. You
are faced with new races, new allies and new enemies. Your supreme goal -
Earth. But can you find a way home before it is descended upon by your new
enemies?

The Year is 2259! The place Babylon 5! Relive the action of the TV Series
by defending the galaxy from the Shadows.

<BR>
Lost on the far side of the Barrier, your only hope for survival is your wits.
Couple that with post nuclear holocaust technology, roving gangs of thugs,
mutants and other assorted plug-uglies, and you've got a fantastic adventure.
The odds are against you. Make it and you'll be a hero. Fail and you'll be
<B>Nuked</B>!

The Module Editor is in alpha stages. It makes designing your own module a
question of creativity, not computing brains. You can define almost every
aspect of ST3. The Module Editor also compiles your data for use with ST3
(registered version of ModEd only).
<P>
You can define:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Alliances
<LI>Galaxy Names
<LI>Territories
<LI>Planet names and locations
<LI>Starbase names and locations
<LI>Location of the link between the two galaxies
<LI>Hostility of the Alliances
<LI>Home sector of the Alliances
<LI>Add random position Planets and Starbases
<LI>Ship names and stats
<LI>Ship start positions
<LI>Ship graphic template
<LI>Different backdrop graphic templates for each galaxy
<LI>Communication messages and responses
<LI>Events
<LI>Change the words to reflect your module
<LI>Add up to 4 cheat codes
<LI>Weapon names, types and power
