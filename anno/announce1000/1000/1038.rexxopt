Hello Dan!

I sent the announcement below to announce@cs.ucdavis.edu two weeks ago
and haven't received a rejection nor have I seen it in
comp.sys.amiga.announce. Could you check this, please?


Thanks,

      Uli

DESCRIPTION

	RexxOpt optimizes your ARexx scripts by removing all
	information not necessary.  This results in a faster execution
	speed, making working with ARexx much more comfortable.

	When run in default mode (no switch given in command line) the
	following is done:

	  - all unnecessary blank characters (ASCII 9, 32 and 160) are
	    removed
	  - all comments are removed
	  - consecutive strings are merged to one single string
	  - ';' is inserted in front of any DO within the script
	  - all blank characters outside strings and comments are
	    replaced by <space> (ASCII 32)
	  - all (remaining) lines are put into one single line
	  - a new comment line is put in front of the script because
	    ARexx requires ARexx scripts to begin with a comment.

	This is V1.7, an update to V1.6.


NEW FEATURES

	- New switch DEOPT: (re)insert linefeeds
	- Minor code optimization concerning nested comments
	- New switch FIRSTCOMMENT: Don't strip first comment
	- Filehandling rewritten: it is no longer necessary to provide a
	  destination filename. This introduced some new error messages and
	  made some of the old obsolete.
	- Titlecomment and filecomment are now set according to current mode
	  (optimize/deoptimize).


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	You need AmigaOS 2.0 or better to run RexxOpt.

	Additionally it would be a good idea to have ARexx installed
	on your system since it makes not much sense to optimize ARexx
	scripts when you can't use them.
