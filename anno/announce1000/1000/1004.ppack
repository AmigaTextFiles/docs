DESCRIPTION

	PPack is a shell command interface to the powerpacker.library by

	data files. PPack offers more features than the original shell
	commands.

FEATURES

	o PPack is a fast PowerPacker data cruncher and decruncher.

	o The size of the speedup buffer is chosen depending on the
	  available memory.

	o Multiple files and wildcards are supported.

	o Supports crypting/decrypting of files.

	o Perfect to use in tools like Directory Opus.

	o As an option PPack handles renaming files with '.pp' suffix for
	  packed files.

	o Filenotes may be added to distinguish between packed and not
	  packed files.

	o Recrunching packed files with a different efficiency is
	  supported.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Kickstart 2.04
