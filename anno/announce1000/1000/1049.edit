DESCRIPTION

     MUIProCalc is a MUI-based calculator much like Jimmy Yang's
     Calc 3.0. It still lacks the plotter, but it offers a quite
     flexible history facility for inserting previously entered
     expressions. If offers different output formats and plenty of
     functions the user may choose from. Furthermore the look
     of the calculator may be customized.

     MUIProCalc comes with a fancy GUI you may configure to your needs.
     Function gadgets may be flipped through using pages so that they
     don't eat up too much of space. MUIProCalc supports an input/output
     history you may configure so that you may re-insert previously entered
     expressions/results. History entries may be copied to a user definable
     clipboard unit. It features various display/output bases such as decimal,
     hexadecimal, octal, and binary and of course calculation sizes ranging
     from 8-bit to 32-bit width. Angles may be displayed as radians, degrees,
     or grads. MUIProCalc offers an ARexx port you may use to calc expressions
     externally. These commands are able to return TeX compatible output
     such as "1\cdot 10^{-5}". It comes with two example scripts for use
     with CED Pro.
