============
FRESHFISH CD
============

The FreshFish Volume 7 (Nov/Dec) CD's went into production on Nov 1st, and
started shipping on Nov 4th.  The next FreshFish CD, Volume 8, is expected
to go into production during the middle of January.

We have several planned improvements in the FreshFish CD, that we are
keeping under our hat for the moment, and that are expected to start
appearing with Volume 8.  We think our customers will be quite pleased with
the pending changes, and we will continue to strive for the highest possible
level of excellence in all our products.

============
GOLDFISH  CD
============

GoldFish Volume 1, a 2-CD set released in April of 1994, provides a complete
archive of the 1000 "fish disk" floppy library, with all the disks provided
in both archived and ready-to-run form.  It can be used to produce master
floppy disks for further duplication and distribution, using a simple to use
program that is provided on the CD-ROM.  It can also be used by BBS or
anonymous ftp sites to provide convenient electronic access to all the
material from the floppy library.

GoldFish Volume 2, a 2-CD set released in December of 1994, includes all the
new submissions included on the first 7 volumes of the FreshFish CD series,
with all the material updated to the latest available version as of the date
of completion of the GoldFish CD.  As with Volume 1, all of the material is
included in both archived and unarchived form.  It also includes the latest
versions of the "useful tools" included on each FreshFish CD, such as the
GNU utilities, reviews of hardware and software, etc.  This CD will start
shipping on Dec 13th.

============
LIGHT-ROM CD
============

In cooperation with Lightwave artist Michael Meshew, we now offer a new CD
called "LIGHT-ROM".  This is a 647 Mb CD dedicated to 3D artists all over
the world, and contains Lightwave objects, scene files, textures, bump maps
(JPEG, IFF, & TARGA), fonts, thumbnail renderings, and text files with
advice from the rendering pros.  It also contains a "Showcase Directory",
displaying the talents of selected Lightwave artists from all over the
world.

LIGHT-ROM will be updated at approximately 6 month intervals.  Contributors
will be eligible for a free copy.  The retail price is $39.95 plus $3.95 for
shipping and handling.

=============
FRESHFONTS CD
=============

In cooperation with fonts enthusiast Daniel Amor, we published a new fonts
CD in early November.  This CD was published as an experiment under
conditions similar to the Meeting Pearls CD, whereby users that find the CD
interesting and useful are expected to make a shareware like donation to the
creators of the CD.

Thousands of these CDs were distributed free of charge at the Computer '94
show to customers at Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe booth.  We have also
distributed almost all of the CD's that we had allocated for our customers
that receive other CD's during November and December.  So far the results
have been quite disappointing, with at most a few hundred dollars in
donations received.  We will declare the experiment officially over on
February 1st, 1995, and provide a summary of the results at that time.

==============
TURBOCALC V2.0
==============

We are an authorized U.S. distributor of TurboCalc V2.0, a very powerful
Amiga spreadsheet program.  TurboCalc has extensive formatting options,
supports many different font formats, more than 40 different number, time,
and date formats, more than 100 functions covering arithmetic and financial
needs, more than 120 ARexx and macro instructions, integrated database, and
more.  TurboCalc retails for $115 plus $6.95 for shipping and handling.

=========
AMINET CD
=========

We are an authorized U.S. distributor of the new Aminet CD.  Both the Aminet
Gold and the Aminet Share are available.  Subscriptions for both CD's are
also available, at $59.95 per year for the Gold version and $44.95 for the
Share version.  There are expected to be four releases per year, so the
subscription is actually for 4 CD's, regardless of when they actually end up
shipping.

The only physical difference between the Aminet Gold CD and the Aminet Share
CD is the front cover artwork.  Built into the price of the Aminet Gold CD
is an automatic contribution to the creators of the CD and sufficient margin
to make the disk attractive to low volume resellers and retail sales
outlets.  Users who purchase to the Aminet Share version are expected to
make their own contributions directly to the creators if they feel that the
CD is worthwhile and wish to support creation of future Aminet CD's.

We currently have Volume 4 (Nov 1994) in stock.

=================
MEETING PEARLS CD
=================

We are expecting to have the second pressing of the Meeting Pearls CD in
stock in the next few days.  This CD contains about 150 high quality and
high resolution fractals, a ready to run version of PasTeX which includes
fonts for FAX and 600 DPI printers, a ready to install version of the Amiga
NetBSD port, and many other ready to run applications including UMS, DaggeX,
a lot of utilities, games, etc.

Because the version of NetBSD expected to be included on the CD-ROM includes
encryption code that is restricted for U.S export, all imported CD's will
only be available for resale within the U.S.

=================================
SPECIAL BBS VERSION OF FROZENFISH
=================================

By special request from BBS operators, we are issuing a limited number of a
custom version of the April 1994 FrozenFish CD, updated with some new
material, and called "FrozenFish-PC".  This CD has the complete contents of
each floppy disk 1-1000 in a single archive and all directory and file names
are ISO-9660 level 1 compliant (8.3 format, uppercase only, etc).  This
means that the CD is completely compatible with IBM-PC based systems, unlike
our regular Amiga CD's which are closer to ISO-9660 level 2.

For at least the next month or so, each copy of this CD is an individually
created CD-R "gold disk", which is completely compatible with mass
production CD's and CD-ROM drives.  Sometime soon we expect to do a small
production run of this CD and people who received the CD-R versions can
upgrade to the production version for $5 plus shipping costs.  The price of
this CD is $24.95 for either version, because of the lower volumes and thus
higher production costs per CD.

=====================
ATTENTION ALL AUTHORS
=====================

Amiga Library Services is actively looking to expand our CD-ROM offerings.
If you are an Amiga user with a good idea for an Amiga specific CD-ROM,
please consider letting us act as your publisher.  We will handle all
details concerning actual production of the CD-ROM, advertising, sales, and
distribution.  All you have to do is have a good idea and to be willing to
spend the necessary time to create a ready-to-publish master file tree for
the CD.

===========================
FUTURE FLOPPY DISK RELEASES
===========================

After completing disk 1000 in the floppy library earlier this year, we made
arrangements with another party to continue the floppy library past disk
1000.  It has now been over six months since we were first promised a new
batch of floppy disks, based on selected material from the FreshFish CD's,
and we have yet to see any results.

While I was at the Computer '94 show in Cologne in early November, I made
tentative arrangements to have this task taken over by someone else with the
time and experience to do an excellent job of continuing the floppy library.
I expect to finalize this arrangement soon, and am sorry that it has taken
so long to bring the floppy distribution back on line.

======================
ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS
======================

Material for inclusion in the CD-ROM distribution can now be submitted
electronically via anonymous ftp.  Please upload your submissions as an lha
archive, one archive per submitted program, to the ftp incoming directory on
ftp.amigalib.com.  Please include a "Product-Info" file in the lha archive.
This file describes the material using a standard format that is recognized
by the new version of KingFisher and by tools that we use to automatically
generate information about the CD contents.  If you don't have a copy of the
Product-Info specification, it can be retrieved via anonymous ftp from
ftp.amigalib.com, in directory pub/amiga.

If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can still submit material
electronically by mailing a uuencoded lha archive to
"submissions@amigalib.com".

=================
ELECTRONIC ORDERS
=================

You can email orders to be paid via credit card (VISA or MasterCard only) to
"orders@amigalib.com".  All such orders must include the full name of the
card holder, the card number, the expiration date, and a daytime phone
number which can be used to verify the order.  We will attempt to
acknowledge all such received orders via return email, and to verify an
unspecified percentage via phone calls.

Please note that it is considered to be somewhat risky to send credit card
information via electronic mail without encrypting it.  We are not currently
ready to start receiving encrypted orders, but may be able to do so in the
future.  We cannot be responsible for any fraudulent use of credit card info
that is intercepted by a third party during it's transmission.

For further information about our CD's, or to obtain an electronic copy of
our order form, send email to "orders@amigalib.com".
