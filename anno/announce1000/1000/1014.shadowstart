VERSION

DESCRIPTION
         ShadowStart is a small utility that should be called from 
         the startup-sequence.
         If the activation-key is pressed down a requester pops up,
         asking you if you want the WBStartup-drawer, the 
         User-Startup script or both to be disabled.
         This means, you can bootup a "clean" Workbench, 
         without any programs in WBStartup or User-Startup executed!
         And also a new shell-window can be opened for changing 
         things befor executing the startup-sequence.
         (Sourcecode is included.)
