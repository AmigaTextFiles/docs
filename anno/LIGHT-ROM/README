  Included are two archives. 3D-Objects.lha contains a collection of
Lightwave 3D objects taken from LIGHT-ROM, the CD ROM dedicated to
Lightwave artists. These objects represent a very small sampling of the 
hundreds of objects on LIGHT-ROM. LIGHT-ROM also contains a collection 
of objects in the Imagine, Sculpt & GEO formats although none are
included in this sampling.


   The second archives, Index.lha contains a collection of hires 16 color
index images with thumbnail renderings of over 240 of the hundreds
of Lightwave 3D objects included on LIGHT-ROM. The limited palette
does not do justice to the quality of these objects, but was necessary
to limit the size of this file. These thumbnail renderings are
designed to save the owner of LIGHT-ROM hours of having to render
each object to see what they look like. On LIGHT-ROM the thumbnail
renderings are presented to you in hires, HAM8 & Targa formats at a 
resolution of 640x400. These thumbnail renderings look great on a
directory utility program like Directory Opus or any of the great PD
ones.
