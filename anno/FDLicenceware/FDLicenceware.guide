@{i}@{fg highlight}Dear Programmer@{ui}@{fg text}

Thank you for dowloading our information archive.

5th  Dimension  was  setup  to  produce  and  supply high quality, low cost
software  to  all  Amiga  users.   We've  selected  the  very best from our
collection  including  titles  that have already sold well in other schemes
and  also  some  brand  new  commercial quality titles.  We hold to date 34
titles,  quality not quantity is our motto.  Any title sold by ourselves is
supplied  to  the  customer  in  a  clear  plastic case with professionally
printed  insert.  We also advertise in all popular Amiga based publications
and our distributors are encouraged to promote all 5DL titles to the full.

Our main website is located in the UK at:

                     @{fg highlight}http://www.ware5d.demon.co.uk@{fg text}

Please surf across and browse through the pages to get a better idea of the
sort of software we sell.  You can even download some of our demos to check
on their quality.

Here's  how  it  all works.  The retail price of a one disk title is £3.95,
with  £1.25 going to the  programmer,  £2.45  to  the retailer, and 25p for
administration.   You  will receive payment from the sales of your title(s)
every  two  months, by direct bank transfer (if you hold a UK bank account)
if  the  value is £10 or less the amount will rollover to the next pay day,
but don't worry, I always keep you well informed.

The dates for payment are around the 18th of:

                                  JANUARY
                                  MARCH
                                  MAY
                                  JULY
                                  SEPTEMBER
                                  NOVEMBER


The  complete  title  should  be  sent  in for evaluation and if accepted a
couple  of  things  need  to  be done to each disk to help protect both our
interests.

1.  The official 5D disk icon to be added.
2.  The official 5D title screen to be added.

I hope that the above will be of interest to you.

I  would  also  recommend  if  possible, a cutdown PD version, to spread to
other  libraries  and 5DL distributors.  A screenshot of your program would
also  be  appreciated,  to aid in magazine reviews and advertising.  Please
remember  that  signing  the  agreement gives 5th Dimension Licenceware the
exclusive right to sell the title.

@NODE "evaluation" "5DL Evaluations"


@{i}5D Evaluations@{ui}
@{i}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ui}

When a program is received for evaluation, it's tested immediately by myself
and a few notes are taken down containing program type, presentation,  first
impressions, and value for money. All that takes place early in the  morning
before any work as begun, so nothing is decided just yet.

When  customers  pop  in I'll show them the title and jot down any  comments
they may make, good or bad.  At the days end when all is quiet  I'll load up
any  evaluations  and  this  time go through them with a  more critical eye,
again  making  notes  and looking for the  hidden features which make a good
program into a great program.  Running this  business as given me an eye for
what's hot and what's not in the crazy world  of computer software.  Some of
the programs may be good,  but not good enough for the scheme, others may be
not  suitable  to sell as licenceware.   This doesn't mean they are rubbish,
just not able to join the 5D scheme  and if this happens alternative ways of
marketing may be suggested.  Either way you can be  sure that you'll receive
an answer from me quickly to let you know just what as been decided.

If  you  would  like  to  submit one  of your programs to the 5D scheme then
please read the following notes.


1.    Make  sure that you include your name,  address, telephone number, and
      if possible E-Mail address.

2.    The complete program must be sent in for evaluation, no PD  or cutdown
      versions, I can then see just what's on offer to the customers.

3.    Include a description of the title, ie number of levels, hardware
      required, is it new!

4.    Tell me if there are any cheats to allow access to later levels ;)

5.    Use the AmigaDOS filing system OFS/FFS depending on target machine.

6.    HardDrive installable is prefered, but not essential.


All  the  above  points will allow me to check your program to the full, if
the program is accepted an official 5D screen will have to be added, so the
disk will need to have some free space.  So that's all there is to it, some
titles  are  signed  up  and  on  sale  within  weeks,  others require more
development,  which  I'm  always  happy to help with and may take months to
reach the public.  If you've got something finished send it in now and I'll
take a look.

Don't  forget that all 5DL programmers receive a 20% discount off any title
in  the  scheme,  that's another great reason to join us.  Don't delay join
today and order some of the best value Amiga titles around for even less!!

@{i}Required Now@{ui}
@{i}~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ui}

All  program  types  are  welcome  at the moment, but one or two are really
needed.   If  you've  got  one  of the following then please send it in for
evaluation.

1.    I'm a big fan of racing/driving games, infact I love'em. The scheme
      would benefit from a car racing game and the whole world is waiting
      for a good motorcycle racing game. Someone must be able to produce
      one, so please send it in.

2.    Educational software is always needed, specially for the 5-9 year age
      groups, parents ask for these all the time.

@NODE "history" "5DL - History"


@{b}-- 1994 --@{ub}

Way back in the winter of 1994, trouble reared it's loathsome head over our
beloved  Amiga.   The  good times had gone and with them the support of all
the  large software companies, their attention now turned to the PeeCee.  I
had  used  the  Amiga  since  the first WB1.2 A500 in the late eighties and
always supported the machine and PD markets, during 1994 I decided to leave
my  job  and started my own Public Domain library called "SaddleTramps PD",
which  is  still a very active and successful company in it's own right.  I
quickly  acquired  the  distribution  rights  for  the two main licenceware
schemes  at the time, CLR and F1.  It soon became clear that the CLR scheme
was,  shall we say, in a bit of trouble.  It was losing all the support and
respect  of  it's programmers and was consequently going to close.  At this
point I decided to start a new company and so 5th Dimension Licenceware was
born.



@{b}-- The Beginning --@{ub}

I  contacted many friends, programmers, and customers to find out just what
they  expected  to  gain  from either submitting titles to or buying titles
from  5DL,  the  response  was  amazing!!  Ideas came in thick and fast and
gradually  I  was  able to create an exiting new structure to suit everyone
programmers, distributers, customers, and even little old me ;) Competitors
though  that the aggressive pricing structure and the complete new approach
to  licenceware  would  never  work,  but  as  you  see to their dismay, it
did.

The main battle plan is simple, 5DL can produce high quality Amiga software
for  a  retail  price  that  anyone  can  afford,  if  bought directly from
ourselves  it's  even supplied in a rather smart plastic case complete with
printed  insert  card at no extra cost, so keeping your software investment
safe.   Customers  are  getting  excellent value for money, programmers are
getting  their  titles presented with the respect they deserve, and putting
profits  into  their  pockets  for  all  the  time  spent  in  development.
Everybody wins with 5DL and the Amiga is kept alive.



@{b}-- What Now? --@{ub}

It's  over  a  year since the introduction of 5DL onto the Amiga market and
things  are  going  very well, coverage of our titles in the has been good.
The  CLR  scheme  did close and so we were able to fill a gap in the market
and  move along side F1L, who's titles we still support and sell along side
our  own  range.   The  owner  of  F1,  Steve Bye, and myself are always in
contact and operate with a friendly rivalry, both fully committed to seeing
the Amiga back on top.

The  success  of  5DL  so  far  does  not mean that we are sitting back and
resting on our laurels, many new titles are in development and great things
are  planned for the coming year.  Our latest release comes complete with a
fully  printed manual (not photocopied) and is written/produced in house by
us to enhance this great new product.

Amivoice  is  a  brand  new invoice/order form creator with some innovative
ideas,  the program saves all the invoices/orders to disk and allows you to
find  any  data  within  seconds,  it can printout a whole days work in one
session, allows you to enter stock codes, plus much much more.  A new paint
package  Belle's  Paint  V2.0  as just been released and some of the titles
will  be  totally  updated for 1996.  One of the main problems I found with
other  schemes  was the repetition of titles in the collection, thus making
an impressively long but misleading program list.  At 5DL we are constantly
looking  at  our  current titles and checking their value in the scheme and
seeing  if  any  improvements  can be made, if changes can be made or a new
version is released then the title is directly updated and not added to the
end of our lists.

This creates a small but perfectly formed collection ;)



@{b}-- The Future --@{ub}

5DL  is  now  the  fastest growing licenceware company in the UK.  Our high
standards  and  vigarious testing ensures the released software will always
perform as advertised.  We recieve many letters from customers praising our
excellent  service  and  product  range,  try  us yourself today and you'll
wonder why you didn't try us sooner.

Programmers  are  always  impressed  with  the  care and enthusiasm we show
towards  their  titles.   They also know that if a program is excepted onto
the 5DL books it must be of the very highest quality.

Keep  your  eyes  open  in  the  Amiga  press for details of our first full
commercial  release  during early 1997.  The project is reaching the end of
it's development, please call back here for the latest news.

@NODE "copyright" "Copyright"


@{i}Copyright Warning@{ui}
@{i}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ui}

I  check  the contents of all the programs in the scheme and to the best of
my  knowledge,  non  contain any copyright material.  Please make sure that
before  you  send  in  any title it contains only your own work and if not,
then  permission  from the owner to use their work must be given.  Areas to
check are music modules and art work.

Once a program is signed up to the 5D scheme it cannot be sold by any other
company.   This means that 5th Dimension Licenceware as exclusive rights of
sale  and only 5th Dimension Licenceware and it's official distributors can
legally sell the product.

Official 5DL distributors (January 1997) are:

      @{fg highlight}SaddleTramps PD        HorneSoft PD           Snappy PD
      SeaSoft Computing      Pixel Digital PD       Norwich PD
      Sagittarius Software   Der Spezialist@{fg text}

Titles can also be purchased from:

      @{fg highlight}Doncaster Road Post Office, Wath-Upon-Dearne@{fg text}

Each  title sold direct from 5D Licenceware will include a plastic case and
a  printed insert displaying the products name, please note that service is
not  part of the distribution contract and so may not be available from all
outlets.
