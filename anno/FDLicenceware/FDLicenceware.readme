5DLicenceware are looking for new, high quality, titles to add to our Amiga
licenceware scheme.

This  archive  contains details of the titles we require, information about
how  the  scheme  started,  and  best  of all how you will get paid if your
program is accepted.

We're backing the Amiga, are you?
