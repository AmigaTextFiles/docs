  IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE AND INFORMATION

  Makin Musik

  While  we  at  CD  Exchange  feel  we  have  put together the best music
  software  available  on  this  CD,  we in no way wish to take credit for

@Node OctaMedv6

  OctaMed V6

  OctaMed is a classic program in the Amiga World which has been around
  for many years.

  It is a sequencer.... Below is the text file 'NewTov6'.

                       OCTAMED V6 - WHAT IS NEW?

  I will here describe the most significant changes in V6.

  My  military  service  ended  on  February 1994, and that's when I began
  working  on V6.  It took therefore slightly more than a year to complete
  it.   This  is more than with the previous major versions, mostly due to
  my studies, which has somewhat badly delayed the work.  Anyway, only one
  major improvement that was planned for V6 had to be left out, because of
  lack time.  ( A much improved notation editor, see below.)

  Let's  talk  about  the improvements.  One fundamental shortcoming in V5
  was its fixed 640 × 256 medres screen.  Many people requested for screen
  mode  selection.  It would have been reasonably easy to add, but imagine
  the  V5 screen on a 1280 × 512 screen - it would have filled one quarter
  of  the  screen,  and  the  extra screen space would end up being mostly
  useless.   Therefore,  the  need for a more flexible method of adjusting
  windows  and  also  using  bigger  fonts (Topaz 8 would be too tiny on a
  Super  Hi-Res  screen  -  and  nowadays  I  consider it ugly anyway) was
  imminent.  Also, even though V5 was much more "programmer-friendly" than
  V4,  the window layout could be still simplified.  The first thing I did
  were a set of routines called:


  RTFSWB

  This  strange  acronym  stands  for  "Real  Time  Font  Sensitive Window
  Builder".   (  not a mixture of My and Rays initials ) ;) It is a simple
  GUI  design  "language"  which  contains  commands like GBOOL (creates a
  boolean  gadget) or TXT (creates a text item).  When a window is opened,
  RTFSWB does the layout of the window according to the currently selected
  font.   As  the  name  says, it is fully font sensitive, supporting both
  non-proportional  and  proportional  fonts.  RTFSWB greatly improves the
  outlook  of  OctaMED,  especially on high resolution screens with bigger
  fonts.

  There  are  some  more  GUI changes besides RTFSWB; there is no longer a
  default  backdrop window, but all parts of the user interface are now in
  windows  for  better  configurability.   OctaMED  screen has also become
  public; other applications may open windows on it.


  ARexx

  Yes,  as  most  self-respecting  applications,  OctaMED now has an ARexx
  port!   Most  (but not all) features of OctaMED are available for use by
  external  programs  or  scripts.   This  means  that  users  can add new
  features  by simply writing an ARexx script.  (Of course, not everything
  can  be  made  this  way,  but  features  based on existing features are
  usually  possible.) In V6, OctaMED's keyboard shortcuts are also totally
  implemented via the ARexx interface; each shortcut is mapped to an ARexx
  command.  The shortcuts are user-modifiable.


  Improved soundcard support

  The last V5 revisions added Aura support.
  V6 supports MacroSystem's Toccata as well.
  Currently  only  one sample can be played through it at a time, but this
  will  change  in the future (see below).  Both soundcards support stereo
  output, and OctaMED now supports stereo samples.  (They can be used even
  without a soundcard.)

  Because  16-bit  samples  are  now  becoming more and more common on the
  Amiga,  OctaMED  supports many new sample formats:  MAUD (Toccata's file
  format),  Audio  IFF  (perhaps  the  most  common  multi-platform sample
  format) and RIFF WAVE (these are the PC .WAV files).


  Improved sample editor

  The  sample editor has a lot of new features.  The sample display is now
  significantly  faster  and  it  has  a  new  zooming  slider.  The speed
  improvement is optional, however, as it consumes some memory.

  New editing operations include an overwriting Paste, vertical adjustment
  of  the sample, tuning tone, Add Workspace window, plus more.  Also, the
  ultra-  slow  sampling  Monitor  window  has been replaced with a faster
  monitor screen.


  File handling

  Packer  support is now "finished", I suppose (nothing more to add).  XPK
  is  supported  for  both compression and decompression, with a parameter
  window  for selecting the compression type.  A similar window exists for
  PowerPacker parameters.

  Standard  MIDI  File  (SMF)  saving was added during Spring -94.  Due to
  lack  of  time,  I  didn't  intend  to  add SMF loading to V6.  However,
  eventually  Ray  decided that this feature should be added, so it exists
  now,  and it seems to work pretty well, although SMF->OctaMED conversion
  is   not   quite   straight-   forward.   (I  had  an  old,  practically
  non-functional routine as a basis.)

  A  popular  request  to  Ray was the ability to save modules directly as
  executable  files,  and  this is now possible.  Executables are about 12
  kilobytes longer than the corresponding module itself and they cannot be
  loaded  and  re-mixed  by  other  composers  and  then  re-released then
  anothers  work.  This was the main reason given to Ray for this request,
  but also by those making music disks who hated having to use the player.

  Many  users  have  the  need  of writing information about a song or its
  author,  or  perhaps  about  the  MIDI  setup  the  song  uses.   During
  distribution,  Read Me files tend to get lost easily.  So, thanks to Ray
  you can now embed text files in modules.  They certainly won't get lost!

  Finally,  OctaMED  now  uses four different icons for different types of
  files.    The   icons   now   have   eight  colours,  and  they  can  be
  modified/replaced by the user.


  Player

  There  are  no  new  player  commands,  however,  One  feature  is worth
  mentioning,  you  can now have several commands besides a note.  This is
  carried  out  by  having "command pages".  Each block can have 1 - 32767
  pages,  each one containing a different set of commands (usually no more
  than  three  are used), Shift-Tab cycles between the command pages.  For
  example, to combine slide, vibrato and volume change, you could have the
  following command pages:

    Page 1 (slide):     Page 2 (vibr.):     Page 3 (vol chg):
    C-2 10000       04A6            0D01
    --- 00102       0400            0D01
    --- 00102       0400            0D01
    --- 00102       0400            0D01
    --- 00102       0400            0D40


  Miscellaneous

  Above  I've  described the most significant changes in V6.  There are so
  "many"  minor  changes  I  can't  mention  them all here.  However, I'll
  mention briefly just a few of the minor features here...

  * You  can  free  and  reallocate  audio  channels at any time.  This is
    handy,  as  you  don't  need  to  quit OctaMED in order to use another
    program that requires the audio channels.

  * Slow  HQ  allows  pre-V5  HQ  mode  tempo  compatibility.  Speaking of
    tempos,  there's  a  new  window  for  rough tempo conversions between
    SPD<->BPM and four channel <-> eight channel modes.

  * Instruments  can  be  disabled.   This  is   much   like  setting  the
    instrument's volume to 0, but not quite, as the default volume setting
    can  be  overridden  with  player  commands.   By  the way, Instrument
    Parameters window updating has been optimized, and it's now faster.

  * A  new   Miscellaneous  Options  window  with  a  lot   of...   hmm...
    miscellaneous   options  :-)  such  as:   Close  Workbench,  Overwrite
    Requesters, Use ReqTools, Warn if Disk Full etc.

  * Block/track/range editing operations now have three separate buffers.

  * The Block List window can mark unused blocks, if desired.


  Future

  Well,  I  don't  usually  promise anything until I have actually made it
  already,   but  there  are  some  plans  already  for  future  versions.
  Particularly, there are two major features I would like to mention here.

  The  first is an improved notation editor.  This was planned for V6, but
  it it would have delayed the release for another few Months at least and
  Ray  said that this was too long a break from the old, ( very old ), V5,
  so  it  is  going  to appear within the next major version.  The old and
  outdated  notation  editor  is  temporarily removed in this V6.  This is
  because  it would have taken a "lot" of effort to convert the old editor
  for  RTFSWB,  and  converting  the  editor  for  RTFSWB  first, and then
  completely rewriting it in the next version would have wasted MORE time.

  I  still have no clear vision what the notation editor should look like.
  It  won't  probably  get its form until actually programming it, but Ray
  says  he wants it as good, if not better than "Bars and Pipes"®, does'nt
  want much does he?  ;)

  The  other  major  feature  is  a  new  mixing routine.  This would work
  similarly  to  the  existing eight channel routines, but with a lot more
  flexibility.   I  consider  "at  least"  these  extra  additions  to  be
  important:

    * full 16-bit resolution
    * fully selectable mixing rate up to ~50 kHz
    * far more than just the present eight channels
    * individual volume control for all channels
    * several output devices (including Toccata)

  Naturally,  a  routine with all these features would be much slower than
  the  existing  routine, and probably quite useless on an A500.  However,
  not   all   features   should   be  unjustified  by  the  lowest  common
  denominator...   I  have  not  yet decided the exact way of implementing
  this.    I  know  that  shared  mixing  libraries  are  currently  under
  development.   Whether  or not I'll use some, or all of them, depends on
  if it fulfills our, ( and your ), needs.



  Have Fun and many thanks for your continued support,


  Teijo

@Node Samples

             Sound Samples to be used in Music Applications.

                         @{fg highlight}Courtesy of AKAI UK LTD@{fg text}

  Makin  Musik  contains  some fantastic Professional High quality Samples
  courtesy  of AKAI UK.  These Samples are of the Highest Quality and were
  not  sampled, but  Digitally  Transfered from AKAI sources.

  They  were  originally  16-bit,  converted  from one of AKAI's fantastic
  Samplers,  then  converted down to 8-bit for the Amiga.  They are in IFF
  format, therefore can be used in  almost everything  that supports sound
  on the Amiga.

  Therefore you can load them into the Trackers on Makin Musik and create
  your own Music Modules.

  For  applications  that support 16 bit WAV Samples we have also included
  these  on  the CD in the SampleWAV  Directory.  These can be loaded into
  programs  such  as Octamed v6 or Symphonie which both support 16 bit WAV
  samples


                              @{b}Please Note !@{ub}
            These Samples are not Public Domain or ShareWare,

                        Midi Files on Makin Musik


  Makin  Musik  contains  a  collection of Midi files, these can be loaded
  into  various  music applications and from there you can play them, edit
  them or even create your own.

  Midi ( Musical Instrument Digital Interface ) files, are the majority of
  the  time  played  from  within  a  sequencer ( a music application on a
  Computer or even a hi-tech music keyboard ) which plays the music piece.

  Sequencers  on computers allow you to attach Midi compatible Instruments
  to  the  computer  via  a  Midi Interface and allow you to control these
  Instruments from the Computer.  i.e you could have a keyboard and a drum
  machine playing at the same time.

@Node MultiPlayer

  Module Player with many features.

                         Supported Module Formats
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MultiPlayer currently supports the following module types:

  15-instrument SoundTracker modules (most anyway)
  31-instrument SoundTracker/NoiseTracker 1.3D modules
  Protracker 1.0-1.1B modules
  SoundTracker 2.6 modules
  NoiseTracker 1.3D packed modules (with or without the embedded player)
  NoisePacker 2.01 modules
  Digital Sound Studio modules
  StarTrekker 1.2 AM/FM modules (Extra '.NT' file required)
  MED 3.00-3.21 and OctaMED/OctaMED Pro modules
          Note: Modules (MMD0, MMD1) only - not "Song&Samples" files.
  Oktalyzer 4- and 8-channel modules
          Uses my own 8-channel play engine.  8-channel modules will
          be slightly higher quality on a 68020+ processor.
  SoundFX V1.3 executable modules (Player V2.2)
          Will probably ONLY work with this version, since it does
          some run-time patching to make it play under MultiPlayer.
  Future Composer 1.3 ('SMOD') and 1.4 ('FC14') modules
  JamCrackerPro 1.0a modules
  SoundMonitor 2.0 modules
  SidMon 2.1 modules
  Delta Music modules (two versions)
  Mark II modules
  Dave Whittaker modules
  Face The Music modules (DO NOT COMPRESS!)
          This is very kludgy at best - you must have "PlayFTM:" ASSIGNed
          to the PlayFTM program file.  (Didn't know you could ASSIGN
          to a file?  Now you do!)  The procedure involves loading the
          module, the external player, and then the module again.  Ack!
  Generic embedded-player modules that start with something like
                  jmp init(pc)
                  jmp music(pc)
                  jmp end(pc)
          (Such as NoiseTracker 1.3 packed w/player modules)
  AudioMaster III sequenced 8SVX sounds (mono only)
  'XMOD', 'AMOD', and 'GMOD' formats described in 'Formats.doc'

  Music  lovers!   Now  you  can enjoy the great sound of tracker music on
  your  Amiga  with  a minimum of fuss.  DES-Tracker has been designed for
  low-memory  platforms  (like  mine  :).   The  library  is only 25K, the
  included  jukebox  program  that  uses the library is only 3.5K, and the
  library  only requires an extra 2K in memory overhead (not including any
  loaded  module,  that  is).   So you can be running the included jukebox
  program using a total of about 30K of fast mem.  Pretty slim.

  Programmers!   Now you can have the great sound of Tracker music in your
  programs  with  a  minimum  of  fuss  and your program can still be user
  friendly  and  elegant  in  nature!   Now you can have more control over
  syncing  program  events  to  music  and have much more control over the
  music  you  play!   Even  ARexx  programmers  can  make  full use of the
  library's powerful features and ample status information!

  This  is  the DES-Tracker library system.  The library does all the work
  for  you  and  provides  lots of helpful information about the song that
  it's  playing  as  well.

@Node DASModPlay

  @{b}First of all: YOU NEED MUI (MagicUserInterface) package 2.0 or newer.
  Check your local BBS/FTP or PD software dealer. @{ub}

  Ultimate goal when developing DASMP was to make pro level module player,
  since there exists many moduleplayers, I wanted to make player for those
  who  have  hundreds  of  modules  which needed to be handled efficiently
  without  unnecessary limitations.  So this is kind of a highend response
  to  those small and neat players.  (although the "highend" isn't so high
  after all, more like "end" only)


  Following  is  not the complete features list.  Most of the features you
  can  find  by  experimenting  the  player.   Besides,  I  don't remember
  everything myself either.

    o MUI = Boopsi object oriented Graphical User Interface with
        some awesome user configurable features.

    o Unique Author and style based list handling/sorting system.

    o Basically ANY External archiver supported.
     - External Archs
     - Multiple files within one archive supported.
     - XPK packer libraries supported.
     - PowerPacker supported through xpkmaster.library

    o All existing and future module types can be supported
      through External Player libraries  EPL
      Already finished libraries:
     - S3M (up to 32 channels) modules. ScreamTracker 3.x
     - 6CHN/8CHN FastTracker modules.
     - FAST ram Protracker player.
     - QuadraComposer 2.0 EMOD modules.
     - (Octa)MED modules. 4 - 8 tracks. (dasMMD0.library)
     - Future Composer 1.0-1.3 & 1.4

    o Unique "Active search system".
     - For master modules list
     - Author listing window.

    o Sorting by
     - Name         (Alphabetical)
     - Name reverse (Reverse alphabetical)
     - Date         (From newest to oldest)
     - Date reverse (From oldest to newest)

    o Several ways of keeping module list up to date.
     - Normal filerequester (multiple selections supported)
     - Arexx adding
     - Whole directory adding (ASL req.. for reqtools use ALL gadget)
     - List file load
     - Add update (only newer than specified date added)
     - Check for non existing modules.
     - Double checking for existing modules.

    o Info
     - File sizes
     - Authors/style
     - Compression factor (xpk files)

    o Clocks
     - Time elapsed since module started
     - Time still left. (After set once)
     - Whole visible list time

    o High Configurability
     - Double buffering
     - Fading at definable speed.
     - Joystick control option. -> Joystick view popup on frontmost screen.
     - Pre schedule load
     - Option to use reqtools instead of default ASL

    o Auto detaching when opened from CLI/Shell

    o Screen jumping to frontmost screen when hotkey'd.

    o Massive AREXX support.

    o Neat little quadrascope and doublescope view.
        - 3.0: Huge quadrascope generated from little QS by scaling.
        - Task priority for these is definable
        - Drawing speed is definable.
        - Scope "pixel" width is definable.
        - GENERAL RULE: Keep priority at minimum (minus value)

    o MUCH OPTIONS THAT I DON'T REMEMBER MYSELF EITHER.

@Node EDPlayer

  EdPlayer  is  a music player.  It can play both NoiseTracker modules and
  MED  version  3.21  (or  greater??)  modules.   Note  that SOME MED 3.00
  modules  will  work  also,  however,  others will show up as "Unknown or
  corrupt  module" because MED 3.00 had a serious bug in the module-saving
  routines  (it  didn't  word-align the chunks sometimes, and caused other
  MED  players  to  GURU,  but EdPlayer has a check for this and will only
  report  a "corrupt module" error).  To fix a MED 3.00 or earlier module,
  simply  load  it into MED 3.21 and save it back out as a MODULE.  As far
  as  #?Tracker  modules  go,  I  am  now using the ProTracker 1.1b replay
  routine  by Lars "Zap" Hamre/Amiga Freelancers 1991.  This may make some
  old  NT mods not work properly anymore, but I think that PT mods are far
  more popular by now.

  What EdPlayer can be used for:

  I  had  MANY uses in mind as I was designing EdPlayer.  I wanted a music
  player that could be used directly for entertainment, or multitask while
  the  user  did word-processing or whatever, and also be able to run from
  both  ARexx  and  CLI  scripts for use in IFF slide shows, presentations
  with background music (AmigaVision, DVideo III, Director 2, etc.), music
  for  games  written in AmigaBasic or other languages for which there are
  no  music-playing routines available, and basically any situation at all
  where someone wants their Amiga to play some tunes.  ;->

  EdPlayerJr  is  a small version of EdPlayer, one that has no main panel.
  It  can  be controlled from ARexx, telled, cteled, etc.  It is very good
  in  low-mem  conditions,  because it only takes a few bytes of CHIP mem,
  leaving  most  of  the  memory  free  for  mods.   It  is  also good for
  presentations  that don't need the main panel, etc.  You can even create
  programs  (lists  of songs) in the main EdPlayer and play them back with
  EdPlayerJr.

  EdPlayerJr  tries to be as compatible as possible with the main EdPlayer
  except  for  the  lack of the panel.  Almost all the same ARexx commands
  work,  the  same  startup script is used, etc.  Even the version numbers
  are  the  same  so  you  can  keep  matching  versions  of  EdPlayer and
  EdPlayerJr together.

@Node IntuiTracker

1.1  Features
-------------

  * MULTITASKS better than any other player. Does NOT use busywaits or
    rasterline counts in the replay routine.

  * NEW REPLAY ROUTINE that supports
      - SoundTracker 2.0 - 2.6
      - NoiseTracker 1.0 - 1.3  & 2.0
      - ProTracker   1.0 - 1.3b & 2.1a

  * COMPATIBLE with all screenmodes and processors
  * EASY TO USE  file/directory requester via asl.library
  * ARQ requester support
  * POWERPACKER packing supported if powerpacker.library is available
  * XPK packing supported if xpk.library is available.
  * ADVANCED  MENU  SYSTEM.  Select the modules you want to play from  a
    menu, in the order you want, or select random mode.
  * SPECTRUM ANALYZER to visualize the music being played.
  * MODULE INFORMATION will be shown if you press the "Triumph" gadget.
  * 2.0 BASED COMMODITY OPERATION
  * TOTALLY INTUITION BASED


  1.2  "Yeah, so why is IntuiTracker better than whateverplayer?"
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  IntuiTracker  is,  as  far  as  I  know, the only module player with the
  following not-quite-so-ordinary features:

  *  The  first  replayer  ever used in a module player without busywaits.
  This of course makes IntuiTracker the fastest player available.  No time
  is  wasted  anywhere!   In fact, this is the way the ProTracker replayer
  should have been written, not to mention the first SoundTracker player!

  *  Uses only standard system libraries

  * Does not force you to install packer libraries if you don't need them.
  If  you need powerpacker, install powerpacker.  If you need xpk, install
  xpk.

  *  Supports  -multiply-  crunched  XPK  modules.  Try using DLTA+NUKE or
  DLTA+SHRI for great results.

  *  All decrunching is done is fast ram if possible.

  *  Does  not  just  allocate  sound  channels and sit on them.  Tries to
  allocate the channels when needed instead.

  *  Does not do the same with the timers needed either.

  *  Guranteed to play SoundTracker, NoiseTracker AND ProTracker.  Yes, we
  know there are differences, but they are taken care of.

  *  Smarter module idenfication routine. 'M.K.' is not enough...

  *  Great looking graphics in high res modes! :-)

  *  Actually uses menus in a sensible way.

  PowerTracker  is  a  music  player  that  goes back to the basics.  It's

  wide range of music formats without the need for many external libraries
  and  players.   PowerTracker  is  a  complete  music  player in one tidy
  package!   If  you  want volume control, get a remote control, or if you
  need   fancy   oscilloscopes   and   REAL  equalizers,  get  a  HI-FI...

  All modules are played with a CIA-B interrupt so that timing on NTSC and
  PAL  machines,  and others with different resolution monitors will sound
  correct.   However some replayers, just take over the CIA and I'm forced
  to  use a VBL interrupt which means the music speed changes.  Sorry, but
  this isn't PowerTracker's fault!  Blame the guy who wrote the replayer!

@Node SPLAY31

  SmartPlay is a quite small, and really fast multiformat moduleplayer for
  OS2.0+. SmartPlay supports most moduleformats around, and  will play all
  modules with the _right_ replayroutines. The CPU usage of this player is
  also really low, so  it  will run fine even on a 7MHz Amiga, while doing
  some highspeed serial transfers.

  SmartPlay features a smart way of loading the normal ST/NT/PT/PM modules
  into either  CHIP  or  FAST  memory, loading the samples one by one into
  memory. And as the fastplayer doesn't need the 260K CHIP buffer anymore,
  the new "Chip Save" mode should be quite useful even for daily use.

  Nowadays SmartPlay is really easy to use,  featuring  that  improved CD-
  style userinterface, and  the easy way of selecting the modules to play.
  All kinds of packed modules are also supported; both LhA, XPK and Power-
  Packed modules will automatically be decrunched & played.

  So, SmartPlay v3.1 should  be  the  ultimate moduleplayer for people who
  like  really  small & fast 100% assembler coded programs. SmartPlay v3.1
  is able to play most moduleformats, with _low_ memory  usage,  and  fast
  replayroutines. Like it!


 SmartPlay v3.1 Main Features:
 =============================

     => Supports most moduleformats around. (About 20 different formats)
     => Reliable & Fast FastMemory replayroutine for BIG modules
     => Full LhA, XPK, and PowerPacker support
     => FAST replayroutines. Very low CPU-Usage (Nice for modemtrading)
     => Simple CD-Style userinterface. (Optionally removeable)
     => Logarithmic realtime Volume & Balance controls
     => Nice fast-selection of modules to play, right from the mainwindow
     => Easy to use programlist editor (Featuring multipath programs etc.)
     => Unlimited amount of modules in one programlist
     => Possibility to Save/Load/Play/Link programlists
     => External shared replaylibraries used to reduce memory/disk usage
     => Still possible to use as a simple commandline program
     => SmartPlay is tested on A500-A3000 running OS2.0 and 3.0

  Smart enough? Well, future versions of SmartPlay will include full ARexx
  and  WBench support, an extended programlist editor and many new module-
  formats, to mention a few improvements.  Send  any  ideas,  suggestions,
  possible bugreports, or new/not currently supported moduleformats to the
  author. (Address below)


 Supported ModuleFormats:
 ========================

  These ST/NT/PT/PM formats are replayed using the  internal replayroutine
  in SmartPlay: SoundTracker 31ins., StarTrekker, NoiseTracker, ProTracker
  PowerMusic, and ST/NT/PT SONG files. The following formats are supported
  trough the different SPlay_xxxx replaylibraries:

      Format:              Library Used:       Ver:  VBLPP

      SoundTracker 15inst. SPlay_ST15.library  v1.0  ----*

  The VBLPP support-flags: Volume/Balance/Loop/PositionJump/Pause

  The SPlay_xxxx.libraries should be placed in the LIBS:SmartPlay/ drawer,
  to make them easy to update for future  releases.  It's also possible to
  place them  in  the  LIBS:  root, but if you don't like to have 13 extra
  libraries  right  in your LIBS: drawer, just create that LIBS:SmartPlay/
  drawer, and copy all new SPlay_xxxx.libs into it.

  All kinds of XPK and PowerPacked  modules  are decrunched to a temporary
  directory using the xpkmaster.library v2.0+ and the powerpacker.library.

  Modules  packed  with  LhA  will  be decrunched using an external LhA/LZ
  command (defined in the configuration). SmartPlay  will unpack the first
  file in the archive to a temporary directory,  and  try  to play it as a
  normal module.

  More moduleformats will be supported in future releases of SmartPlay. If
  you have any moduleformats that SmartPlay 3.1 doesn't support right now,
  please  send  some  information  on  them  to the author, so they can be
  implemented in coming releases.

  There is no LhA program included in the  SmartPlay  archive, as most LhA
  versions are  (c) Copyrighted.  Any LhA or LZ  program should  work just
  fine with SmartPlay.

                       ShareWare - Copyright © 1991



 Introduction to UltraPlayer
 ----------------------------
 Welcome to UltraPlayer v1.1.  UltraPlayer is a program to play music
 modules.  Music modules are created by various programs that employ
 different techniques that create stunning soundtracks with your Amiga.
 UltraPlayer is designed to play 18 types of modules from 14 different
 programs.  It will play almost any module you can find.  And you can
 find them just about anywhere.  You can rip them from games, download
 them from your local BBS, or create them yourself.

 What UltraPlayer Can Play
 ---------------------------
 UltraPlayer v1.1 can play any of the following music module types
 (powerpacked or not):

                           David Whittaker Music
                              DeltaMusic v2.0
                            FutureComposer v1.3
                            FutureComposer v1.4
                              JamCracker Pro

@Node OctaMEDPlayer

                  OctaMEDPlayer V3.00 instructions
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  OctaMEDPlayer  is a stand-alone player program for playing songs made in
  OctaMED.   You may freely distribute this with your songs, and it can be
  started from both CLI and Workbench.

  OctaMEDPlayer  V3.0  can  load  sng+samples-format and MMD0/MMD1-modules
  made  in  MED  V2.10 or later, or any version of OctaMED.  It can't load
  MED  songs or files created with previous versions of MED (1.12 or 2.0).
  I  think it is more important that OctaMEDPlayer is as compact and quick
  as  possible  instead  of  the ability to load millions of file formats,
  there  are  dedicated player programs for that (e.g.  MultiPlayer).  You
  can  convert older files by loading them to OctaMED and saving them back
  again.   Please  note that there may be problems with playing speed when
  loading  modules  saved  with  MED V2.10.  In that case, load the module
  into  OctaMED, correct the tempo2 (change to 6) and save it back.  Also,
  a  bug  in  the  module  save routine of MED 3.00 causes some modules to
  crash  when  played.  You can fix the modules by loading the module into
  OctaMED and saving the file back.

  OctaMEDPlayer  can play "standard" four channel Amiga songs, MIDI songs,
  5 - 8 channel OctaMED songs, and multi-modules.

  Powerpacked  MMD0/MMD1 modules are automatically decrunched (powerpacker
  library required).

  OctaMEDPlayer  has  a nice 2.0-look and it works fine under 2.0 (as well
  as 1.3, of course).

Some words about PS3M:
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

  This  little  thing  could  be  just  another program to play music.  It
  wouldn't  even  be the first one I have done.  The only special thing is
  that  it  plays  S3M-modules.  For those to whom that word says nothing,
  can  be  told that they are the modules from all newer Future Crew demos
  (from  Fishtro onwards), compotunes and the three Journey musicdisks and
  Chaotic  Mind  from  Skaven.   After the recent release of ScreamTracker
  3.01  Beta  more  and  more  modules  are  obviously  coming  from other
  musicians  too, as it really is the best tracker on the PC.  As they use
  1-32 channels (although "only" 16 digital channels and 9 AdLib-channels)
  and  8 octaves, a normal Amiga is not capable to play them, right?  Yes,
  until now.

  From  version  000.9 onwards also 6-8 channel FastTracker modules can be
  played with PS3M (should I change the name?!?).  Although you can play 4
  channel  ProTracker  tunes,  I think there are faster programs available
  for that :)...

  In  version  002.5  came support for MultiTracker (MTM) modules and 1-32
  channel Protracker-style modules (TakeTracker and FastTracker 2(?)).

@Node RXTracker

			      RxTracker
   - A Program for playing MED and Soundtracker modules from ARexx -

				 by
			  Dominic Giampaolo
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


  Have  you noticed that AmigaVision only plays those really crappy Deluxe
  Music  Construction  Set SMUS files?  The ones that sound like they were
  taken from a Commodore 64?

  Well I did.

  I  also  noticed that SoundTracker/MED produce music that is an order of
  magnitude  better.  As a matter of fact, if I was blindfolded and didn't
  know, I wouldn't believe the music was coming from the same computer.

  This  is  why  I wrote RxTracker.  It lets you play MED and SoundTracker
  modules  via  ARexx.  This means that you are no longer forced to listen
  to  those  crappy  DMCS files in your AmigaVision presentation.  It also
  means  you  can  play  songs from within your editor, spreadsheet, paint
  program,  or even a telecommunications program!  Now tell me ARexx isn't
  the most killer thing on earth....

  Oh,  one  quick thing.  The medplayer.library will ONLY play files saved
  from  the  2.0 or higher version of MED.  For a module to be loaded as a
  MED  module, the first 4 bytes of the file must be (in ascii) MMD0.  You
  can see if a file is a good MED module by doing "type hex <modulename>".
  If  the  first  thing  you see is MMD0, you're all set.  If not, fire up
  MED, load the module, and just save it back out again.

  ADDITIONAL  NOTES  :  I'm now including a few ARexx scripts that you can
  use  to test things out.  Look in the Rexx directory.  They are all very
  straightforward  and  easy  to  use.   You  should  be  able to use them
  directly from AmigaVision or from the CLI or wherever.

@Node HiP

  HippoPlayer  (HiP)  is  a  moduleplayer  for  the  Amiga.   It  it works
  perfectly under Kickstart 1.2 and has about all the same features as the
  Multiplayer,  which  is  Kick2.0+  only.  One main reason why I bothered
  myself  by  making  this  program  was  that  there were no good Kick1.3
  compatible  players  around.   The  other reason was that my good friend
  Jarno  Paananen  (Guru/Sahara  Surfers)  made a replayroutine for Scream
  Tracker ]I[ modules.

  Hip  is  the  best  Kickstart 1.2/1.3 moduleplayer I've seen so far.  It
  doesn't  need over 100kb of disk space nor memory, and can't play dozens
  of  weird music formats.  It can cope with some different music formats,
  though.   I  have  to mention, that the Protracker replayer in HiP is my
  own,  and  quite  fast.   Average  rasterline  usage  (on A500) is 3 and
  maximum   is  6-7.   Beat  that  ;-)...   HiP  also  supports  multisong
  PT-modules (see below).

  HiP has a good support for Scream Tracker ]I[, FastTracker, TakeTracker,
  and  MultiTracker modules, meaning that you can listen them with a 68000
  Amiga with listenable quality.  All are played by the famous replayer by
  Guru.


 Some features:
 · Scream Tracker ]I[, FastTracker, TakeTracker, MultiTracker, 1 to 32ch.
 · The Player 6.0A. Samples may be packed, but not in a different file.
 · TFMX modules, normal and the seven channel-ones
 · Oktalyzer modules. Really good quality due to the turbocharged replayer.
 · A handful of other 4 channel sample & synth music formats.
 · Easy to use, nice 3D interface.
 · Moduleprogram. Can be loaded and saved.
 · Memory usage about 100kb.
 · Loads and decompresses XPK, FImp and PowerPacker files.
 · Internal multitasking.
 · Tested and works on A500 running Kickstarts 1.2, 1.3 and 3.0.


****************
* Requirements *
****************
  Any Amiga with some memory and Kickstart 1.2 or higher.
  Reqtools.library of any version will be needed for requesters.

  In order to decompress XPK or PowerPacker files, you will need
  xpkmaster.library (with some sublibs) and powerpacker.library.

  For MED modules (4 channels), medplayer.library V2 or higher
  will be required.

  These mentioned libraries are included in the package.  Among them are
  some XPK sublibs too.  You should copy the desired libraries into your
  LIBS:   drawer.   Note  that  only  the  reqtools.library  is absolutely
  necessary.

  The program will run fine on 512kb Amigas but decompressing bigger files
  may not work due to greater use of memory.

  HippoPlayer can be loaded from CLI or Workbench.  An own process will
  be created so there's no need to run it.  This also means that you
  mustn't merge hunks in the file.

  reqtools.library and powerpacker.library by Nico François.
  medplayer.library by Teijo Kinnunen.

*****************
* Music formats *
*****************
 Here's a list of the music formats in HippoPlayer and what functions
 they support. Also the authors are listed.

 Stop/Continue    = 1 - The music can be stopped and continued at will.
 Multiple songs   = 2 - Modules can have more than one song.
 Volume		  = 3 - Volume can be controlled.
 End detect	  = 4 - The end of the song can be detected.
 Forward/backward = 5 - You can jump forwards and backwards in the song.

 Replayer			12345	Author

  Note  that not all of the functions work on all replayers.  Eg you can't
  stop  Oktalyzer  when  you've  started  it.   Well  you can, but only by
  ejecting, so you can't continue.

  Normally   all   modules   will  be  loaded  in  CHIP.   Oktalyzer-  and
  S3M/FTM/MOD/MTM  modules and TFMX songdata will be loaded in FAST RAM if
  possible.   All  compressed  files  will  normally  be  loaded  in CHIP.
  However,  it's  possible to uncompress some kilobytes from the beginning
  of  a  XPKed  file, and check if it is a S3M/FTM/MOD/MTM-, or PT module,
  which  is to be passed to the mixing replayer, OR TFMX music data.  This
  slowes  the  loading  down  a  bit,  but speed is gained because FAST is
  FASTer than CHIP.  This feature can be controlled from the prefs window.


Protracker
----------
  There  are  some  modules  around  with several songs separated by the B
  command.   HiP allows you to play these kind of modules correctly.  Just
  use the 'PS' and 'NS' gadgets to select different songs.

TFMX
----
  HiP  can play both 4 and 7 channel TFMX modules, including the excellent
  Turrican  2  and  3  intro  tunes.  A TFMX module consists of two files.
  They  must  be  named  'mdat.<name>' and 'smpl.<name>'.  To play, select
  'mdat.<name>'.  HippoPlayer will then try to load the 'smpl.<name>' file.

  The  mixing  rate of TFMX 7 channel replayer can be changed.  The bigger
  value, the better quality and bigger CPU load.

S3M/FTM/MOD/MTM
---------------
  (ScreamTracker ]I[/FastTracker/TakeTracker/MultiTracker)

  Jarno  Paananen (Guru/Sahara Surfers) has made replayers for these.  The
  mixing  routine  is amazingly fast.  Even on Amiga 500 8 channel modules
  are  very  listenable.   The  replayer gobbles quite a bit of memory for
  it's buffers, so don't be surprised.

  Mixing  rates  can  be  changed.   Again,  the  bigger value, the better
  quality  and  bigger  CPU  load.  Using the system friendly mode on A500
  will probably more or less jam the machine, therefore you should use the
  killer mode for the best quality.

@Node PlaySid3

  This  is a utility which uses the playsid.library to emulate the SID and
  6510  chip.   The  SID  chip  is  the component in the C64 computer that
  handles  sound.   The  6510  chip  is the CPU of the C64, that means the
  component  that  actually executes all programs.  Because the Amiga does
  not  have these chips and others, you can't run C64 programs directly on
  Amiga.

  Now  this  utility  lets  you  play  all those C64 programs that produce
  sound.   As  you  probably  know,  the C64 has three sound channels (the
  amiga  has  four).   But  this  utility  also  allows  use of the fourth
  channel.  This channel is the product of some special programming on the
  C64, it isn't really a channel.

@Node Player61a

  A Player with the following features:

-  a  very efficient method to pack the pattern data and play it VERY fast
   in realtime

-  cut-down  header  compared  to  the  original  one  (4  bytes  info,  6
   bytes/sample,  8  bytes/pattern,  1  byte/position  plus  one  byte for
   stopmark)

-  removes  all  names,  unused patterns, samples, data after loops, empty
   data  after  unlooped  samples,  commands  with no use and some smaller
   things

-  Delta  format  samples!   Samples  have  the  same quality, but packing
   efficiency  is  better  with for example Imploder or Powerpacker.  Look
   below for some stats!

-  4-bit  delta packing!  Packs samples in ratio 1:2 with very little loss
   of quality.  Try it!

-  nearly  impossible to rip without finding the call to the init routine,
   except if the optional `P61A`-sign is used

-  works  on  every Amiga, under KS1.2-3.1, from WB or CLI/Shell, detaches
   itself from CLI, supports WB icons, etc...

-  loads  files  packed  with  Powerpacker, FImp or XPK (all references to
   Powerpacked files also apply to FImp and XPK files)

  Should  support  modules  with  100  patterns  (At  least  in PT2.x from
  Noxious)  IF  patterns are packed under 64kB in PASS 1...  (pointers are

@Node APlayer

  The  AccessiblePlayer  is  our contribution to the Amiga market of music
  players.   We  thought that our favourite player (Smartplay) just wasn't
  good  enough  anymore,  and  since  neither  D.A.S.   Modplayer  nor the
  Delitracker fulfilled our needs we decide to write our own player.

  We  hope  we  have  reached  our  goal  by  making  a  small,  fast  and
  user-friendly player, the AccessiblePlayer.

  NEW FEATURES

     - Now supports S3M, XM and more

     - 50 Module formats

     - Noteplayers (Surround, 14bit etc.)

     - Multi channel sample play (1-32)

  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher)

  AVAILABILITY

     FTP/Internet: AmiNet and mirrors

@Node DMCSMacro

  Three  AREXX  macros  that  assist  users  of DMCS who have General Midi
  protocol instruments.  The three macros are:

  NumPatch.dmcs  takes  a  number  as  input  and  returns the name of the
  associated instrument patch.

  PatchNum.dmcs  allows  you to get the patch number given the name of the
  instrument.   You  may search for the desired instrument in a variety of
  ways.

  DrumNum.dmcs allows you to insert a note that corresponds to a specified
  drum sound.  You may search for the drum name in a variety of ways.

  These  macros  should  be  helpful  in  several  situations.   They  are
  invaluable  for  entering  scores  that  are  to  be  played  on your GM
  instrument.   You  no  longer need to constantly refer to your manual to
  pick  out  patch numbers and drum note numbers.  It is also helpful when
  you  read  in  a  GM Standard Midi File.  You can quickly find out which
  instruments are used in the song.

@Node MPM

  `MPM'  offers  you  a  lot  of  possibilities to manage your synthesizer
  equipement.   Suppose  you  have an Amiga and some synthesizers that are
  attached to your Amiga with a Midi interface.  Programming more than one
  synthesizer  is very difficult and takes a lot of time.  Therefore `MPM'
  was written.  `MPM' automatizes a lot of things for you.

  A  setup  is  created for all settings.  It contains all operations that
  are  neccessary  to  control  the  synthesizers.  Operations are program
  changes,  controller  messages  and  many  more.   You  can  perform all
  operations by pressing a single button.

  `MPM'  has  a  synthesizer editor to integrate `MPM' in your synthesizer
  enviroment.

  With  help  of  the dump editor it is possible to send and receive dumps
  from any midi device or synthesizer.

  `MPM'  has  an  ARexx  port.  So `MPM' is able to communicate with other
  programs.  Also other programs can control the work of `MPM'.

  Beneath  the  editors  `MPM' offers some modules that run independant of
  `MPM'  and  use  the  multitasking  facilities  of  the Amiga.  The user
  interface is easy use and was programmed in respect to the Commdore User
  Interface Style Guide

  MPM offers an online help system.  It uses the AmigaGuide system that is
  included  in  this MPM package.  Pressing the `HELP' button affects that
  MPM  will give you a context sensitive help.  You can browse through the
  whole documentation by pressing the buttons on the wished topics.

@Node Cyluphonics

  mcf2  is  an  implementation  of  a  concept I have dubbed cycluphonics.
  Cycluphonics  is  based on the idea that there is some similarity in the
  feelings  suggested by combinations of hues and combinations of pitches.
  All  previous  attempts  at correlating musical sound to color that I am
  aware  of have been based on attempts to find a particular musical pitch
  which  is  equivalent to some particular hue or shade of color.  None of
  these  methods have met with any lasting success or popularity.  This is
  due  to  (what  I  consider the fact) that there is no natural basis for
  this approach.

  Suspicions  that  a  "working" color-organ is possible persist, however.
  Human  language  is rife with cross-references between the sonic and the
  visual  domains.   It  happens that by implementing a particular form of
  indirection,  i.e.  by use of a system based on "same difference" rather
  than direct hue to pitch correlation, a method emerges where the implied
  feelings  of  a  sequence  of  colors  can  clearly  be  seen  to relate
  semantically  to  the  implied  feelings  of  a  musical  sequence.  Dr.
  Vacarro's  program  mcf2,  included  in this directory, generates colors
  from  sounds.  The fundamental cycluphonic transform can also be used to
  generate  sounds  from  colors  ,  or to generate both from intermediate
  "condissance" arguments.

  Stated  simply,  cycluphonics  is  achieved  by mapping the twelve named
  notes  of  the  equal-tempered  scale  to the hues of a twelve hue color
  wheel.   This is nothing new.  The crucial point is that the pitches are
  not to be in chromatic order.  The order of the musical pitches is given
  by  the  well-known  construct,  the  cycle  of fifths.  In other words,
  cycluphonics is a matter of mapping a cycle of fifths to a color wheel.

  This  method causes a certain emotional resonance between the visual and
  the  aural  because  a  color  wheel  and a cycle of fifths have similar
  harmonic geometries.  Colors opposite each other on a color wheel clash,
  and  blend  to black in subtractive systhesis or white (white noise?) in
  additive  synthesis.   notes  opposite each other on the cycle of fifths
  differ  by six semitones, a flatted fifth, which is quite dissonant.  In
  both  domains  nearby things tend to blend and things at a distance tend
  to  clash.   Also, in both domains the harmonic geometry of the wheel or
  cycle is identical once any keynote or main hue is picked as a reference
  point.   Thus, the initial assignment of keynote to hue is arbitrary.  C
  can  be  red  or  blue  or any pure hue.  This agrees with the fact that
  cycluphonics  is  about 'same difference', and not about a direct hue to
  pitch relation.

  Once a mapping has been chosen, for example c is set to yellow, and both
  'wheels  are  aligned'  accordingly, this mapping has to remain constant
  for  some  period  of time to have any meaning.  However, realigning the
  mapping  periodically  constitutes  a sort of meta-modulation, and would
  no-doubt add to the process of cycluphonics.

  Cycluphonics  exists in a very treacherous domain between visual art and
  music  and science.  The similarity of the two wheels in question is not
  even  as  good  an approximation as the twelve tone system of pitches or
  the RGB system of color imitation.  The only meaningful results are your
  feelings.   Therefore, I  truly hope you enjoy mcf2.  Stay tuned for the
  aroma and geometry of cycluphonics .  ( or not.  )

@Node JVRClassic

  Hello,  fellow  MIDI  musicians.   In  this archive, you should have the
  following files:

  Divert_1.MID
  gesualdo.MID
  greatlove.MID
  Silver_Swan.MID
  UbiCaritas.MID

  Divert_1.ALL
  gesualdo.ALL
  greatlove.ALL
  Silver_Swan.ALL
  UbiCaritas.ALL

  The  .MID files, obviously, are meant for anyone who wants to use a MIDI
  application that supports the generic .MID format (.MID1 to be precise..
  these are multiple-track files).

  The  .ALL  files  are  meant  for those using Dr.  T's KCS.  I've been a
  fairly dedicated user of the Dr.  T line of products.  It's really quite
  a pity they have given up on the Amiga market.  It would seem to suggest
  that,  perhaps,  as a batch of users, we are not prone to pay for decent
  programs,  because  I  KNOW there are tons of Amiga musicians out there,
  and Dr.  T's KCS is an excellent program, if a little cumbersome because
  of  their  assinine  MS-DOS feel.  When will a software company learn to
  stick to a system's specifications, and USE WHAT IS AVAILABLE!?

  But  enough bitter woe concerning the Amiga and Commodore's astrological
  approach  to  marketing.   These files represent a bit of work that I've
  put in over time for some excellent music that will culturally stimulate
  your  mind, if it doesn't put you to sleep.  Contrary to popular belief,
  not  ALL  Americans  are  culturally  illiterate.  Those who are are not
  always as sarcastic as I am, either.

  *  Divert_1.MID  :   Mozart's "Divertimento #1" for Strings.  You should
  recognize  it.   It represents perhaps the most work I've put into a MID
  file.   It is huge.  It will eat your mother.  Unfortunately, I consider
  it  unfinished,  as  I  couldn't  put  in all the repeats (for which you
  should  thank  me),  and  various  other details I like to commit to MID
  files  were left undone (dynamics, phrasing, etc).  My apologies for the
  slop job, but I didn't get to keep the music I was borrowing long enough
  to  finish  these  details.   Perhaps  another  time  I'll finish it, or
  perhaps someone else will do the detail work.

  *  gesualdo.MID  :   Carlo  Gesualdo's  "Morro  Lasso  Al Mio Duolo" for
  voices.   In  this  case,  however, I'd suggest using a nice pipe-organ.
  Unfortunately,  you  will miss every bit of text-painting that you would
  otherwise  have,  but  at  least  you  can  listen  to the beautiful (if
  bizarre)  chordwork he didn't use.  I say that he didn't use it, because
  he  wrote  this  madrigal  in 1611, when composers didn't use functional
  harmony.   Gesualdo was definately before his time.  Be advised:  if you
  cheat  on  your husband while listening to this song, you and your lover
  will  be  killed,  and  your  naked  bodies left on your husband's front
  porch.   This is some powerful music.  Unfortunately, I have not yet put
  in phrasings in this piece.

  * greatlove.MID :  "No Greater Love Hath Man" for organ and voices.  For
  the most part, I've been extremely careful to stick to the music on this
  piece,  however,  I've made the mistake of not making the organ's pedals
  staccato  in  various  parts  throughout  the music (the music calls for
  staccato,  but  again,  I  didn't  get  to it before I had to return the
  music).   I've  mapped the voices for strings on a Yamaha TG-33, and the
  solo  voices  are set for individual instruments..  you may wish to edit
  them  to your own tastes and instrumentation.  Phrases, dynamics, tempo,
  and  all  kinds of other nonsense have been painstakingly attended to in
  order  to  make up for the lack of staccato in the pedals.  If you don't
  enjoy  this  piece  of  music,  get  better  equipment.  I apologize for
  forgetting the composor's name.

  *  Silver_Swan.MID  :   "The  Silver  Swan" for voices.  I would suggest
  using  a  very  nice, ethericalish (note:  newly created word..  I claim
  credit  for this one) instrument for this..  or experiment a little with
  your own tastes.  This is a beautiful madrigal that should be sung to be
  fully  appreciated..  but you'll have to do with this .MID file instead.
  I've  taken  pains  to  put  crescendoes  and decrescendoes in strategic
  places,  although  I don't think I was careful about phrasing.  Again, I
  forgot the composor's name.

  *  UbiCaritas.MID  :  Durofle`'s "Ubi Caritas et Amor" for voices.  Once
  more, a soft, ethericalish instrument would probably apply to this work.
  I  programmed  it  EXACTLY  as the score would have a group perform it..
  although,  personally,  I  feel  it  should  be taken slower.  This is a
  sacred  work,  full  of  reverence  and  awe of God..  enough to make an
  atheist  become  Christian.  The work is based on a Gregorian chant, but
  the  chord  progressions  and  voice  leading  adds a new dimension to a
  wondrous  work.  This five part sacred work blew me away when our little
  church  choir  sang it for the congregation; it is truly an amazing work
  of  art.   I  have taken great pains to include phrasings, dynamics, and
  temp changes.

@Node midiwatcher

  MidiWatcher  is  for  people  with  MIDI  keyboards.   It  requires  the
  midi.library  v2 or higher by Bill Barton (not included).  It should run
  under almost any version of the Amiga's OS.

  New for v1.1:  Failure programs (see below).  Also, improved -d debug
                 mode, various bug fixes, tries to find if MidiWatcher
                 is already running and exit it, etc.  Also I decided to
                 release source code with this version.  Good luck trying
                 to read it!!  ;-)
                 **** Old save files from v1.0 still work fine!! ****

  Basically, this program sits in the background and watches your MIDI IN
  port for certain tunes.  When it recognizes a tune, it runs a program.

  For instance, if I need my directory utility up, I can do one of three
  things:  (1) I can search through subdirectories for its icon (takes too
  much time and is boring), (2) I can press a ToolManager hotkey (takes
  much less time but is still boring), or (3) I can reach over and play a
  little jingle on my MIDI keyboard, and up pops MegaD.  The third choice
  is clearly much more fun than either of the others ;-).

  Have  you  ever  wanted  to  see  what  MIDI  data  your  instrument  is
  transmitting?   Have  you ever wanted to send your own MIDI data to your
  MIDI instrument?  Then MP is for you!!

  MP  (MIDI  Playground)  is  a versatile tool for sending, receiving, and
  storing MIDI data.  It has many uses:

	o	Learning about MIDI.

	o	Discovering your instrument's system exclusive data
		format.

	o	Testing your instrument's MIDI capabilities.

	o	Acting as a patch librarian.  (VERY VERY basic, though.)

	o	Helping you write MIDI software.

  Essentially,  MP  is  a  "translator"  program  that  understands 3 data
  formats and translates between any pair:

		(1)	English text
		(2)	Binary data
		(3)	MIDI data

  Formats  (2)  and (3) are really the same, but (2) is stored in files on
  your Amiga, and (3) is transmitted via your MIDI interface.

@Node MidiStuff

MIDI Ports	V1.2	MIDI Ports Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~
  This  little tool will always keep you up to date upon public MIDI ports
  attached  to  the  MIDI.Library.   Actually  it  was  meant  to become a
  patchbay the way Bill suggested it, but I found no way of getting a list
  of all existing routes between the ports (Bill:  hint!  hint!), so all I
  can  do  is  display the names of the ports.  At least this is done with
  elegance:   Ports  opens up a window and writes the list of 'sources' to
  the  left  and  the  'dests'  to  the right.  Nice thing about it is, it
  automatically  resizes  the  window  to the necessary amount of lines to
  display everything.

MIDI Keys	V2.0	Virtual MIDI Keyboard
~~~~~~~~~
  Shows a 10-octave (full MIDI note range) keyboard in a window, displays
  all  incoming  MIDI  notes  ('OMNI  mode') by highlighting the keys with
  colours  changing  by  velocity.   When  the window is activated a piano
  keyboard  is  simulated  on the Amiga keyboard.  You can also play notes
  with the mouse button.  A 'thru' route can be established by hitting the
  F10  key,  it  will  connect the Input and Output ports with each other.
  F2/F1 will in/decrement the current channel the keyboard sends on.

MIDI Recorder	V1.2	Little MIDI Recorder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Records  or  plays  back  note  data from the musical instrument digital
  interface  (MIDI)  using  MIDI  realtime  information  as  timing clock.
  Sequential music data can be stored and retrieved from DOS.

MIDI Clock Daemon	V1.1	MIDI Clock Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The  clock daemon is used to produce standard MIDI timing signals.  This
  program  has  no  user  interface by itself, it needs a controller to be
  used.   As  the  word  'daemon'  suggests,  you must run it in the back-
  ground  with runback, as it doesn't detach itself, and then it will wait
  for  orders  from  its  MIDI  ports.   It runs quite stable now and only
  seldom  looses  the  beat  or  something  like that.  You must of course
  maintain  the  multitasking environment.  To stop it you can use CTRL C,
  the BREAK command from a shell, or feed it with an unexpected MIDI code.

MIDI Control	V1.0	MIDI Clock Daemon Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Finally you get the tool with the classic "START", "STOP" and "CONTINUE"
  gadgets.   When  you  start it up, it will look for a running ClockD and
  connect  itself to it so that you can use the gadgets.  The tempo gadget
  works  as  you would expect and correctly displays the beats per minute.
  However  be  careful  not  to hassle too much with it while the clock is
  running  as  bad  things  can  happen.  Best is to change the speed only
  while stopped.  Maybe if you have a faster Amiga than mine, this problem
  will not arise for you.

MIDI Echo	V1.0	MIDI Echo Processor
~~~~~~~~~
  This   filter   produces  copies  of  incoming  notes  at  exponentially
  decrementing  velocity  at the beat of the music.  It expects both notes
  and  MIDI  timing  information  to come into its listening port and will
  count  the  MIDI timing to produce the echoes, therefore being always in
  time  with  the  rest of the music and following changes in speed of the
  MIDI clock if you set it up to do so.

MIDI Holder	V1.1	Hold - A MIDI effect filter
~~~~~~~~~~~
  This one is more simple, it just holds back the release of notes as long
  as possible.  However the effect is interesting.

MIDI Dump	V1.1	Simple MIDI SysX Dumper
~~~~~~~~~
  Receives  &  Sends  MIDI  "System Exclusive" data, (sysx, patch data for
  synthesizers etc.).  Data can be stored and retrieved from DOS.

General usage notes (for all programs in the package):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The screen title is often used for messages.
- The programs use a certain <Name> in the MIDI library port lists, if
  this  name  is  already taken they will automatically append a number to
  the  name.   You  can  override  this by specifying the name you want as
  argument.   -  All  utilities  are  now interruptable by CTRL-C or break
  command  from CLI.  - Automatic routes can be modified with the '-i' and
  '-o'  switches.   -  Some  utilities  have  'thru'  routes  that  can be
  activated  with  '-t'.   -  If a program fails to start try to run it in
  foreground, error messages are displayed to stdout sometimes.
- None of the executables can be made resident.

  The  Music Web is an environment that lets you do extensive manipulation
  of   MIDI  event  streams  in  real  time.   It  is  a  `diagram'  based
  environment,  which  means  that you build the configuration you want to
  perform   the  desired  processing  directly  by  placing  elements  and
  connecting them together on the screen.

MidiUtility 2.0       2/16/87     Djj

  Version  2.0  is  an improved (I hope) version of MidiUtility 1.0.  I've
  added  an  Intuition interface, a file requester and default directories
  for  patch  data,  sequence  data  and  bank  data.  This version is now
  compiled with Manx C.

  When  started,  a  movable  window  will  open  indicating  the commands
  available.   You  may  either press a letter on the keyboard or click on
  the command letter to activate a command.

  Commands  which  require  disk  files,  will  bring  up a file requester
  (thanks  to  C.   Heath)  showing  the  files  contained  in the default
  directory.   All  initial  default  directories  will  point to the RAM:
  device.   (Instructions  for patching the file for the directory of your
  choice  will follow.) You may click on the category gadgets (PAT1, PAT2,
  SEQ,  BANK)  to  change  to  a  different  directory, or you may enter a
  directory  name  in  the DRAWER gadget at the top of the requester.  The
  category gadgets default to the current logged in drive until changed by
  the user.  (See below)

  There  is a maximum of 5000 midi events which can be recorded.  This can
  only be changed by recompilation.

  Also included in this ARC file are 4 banks of my favorite instruments, a
  bank containing the standard internal instruments and a bank of modified
  internal instruments required for Music Studio.

  ------------
  Directory usage:

      PAT1  -- can hold data patches
      PAT2  -- can hold more data patches
      SEQ   -- can hold recorded sequences
      BANK  -- can hold banks of 16 data patches


  -----------
  To  change  a default directory, you will need a binary file editor such
  as  NEWZAP  to  patch  the  program.   You  will  enter  the name of the
  directories directly into the program data area.

  In  NEWZAP,  GOTO  sector 32.  At the offsets listed below you will find
  the  areas  for  each  default  directory.   You  have 40 characters per
  directory name.  You may use less than 40 characters, but NO MORE.

           dir   offset (hex)
           PAT1  185
           PAT2  1AD
           SEQ   1D5
           BANK  1FD

  For  example, if you entered DH1:MIDI/PATCH at offset 185, then when you
  select the PAT1 gadget, the above directory contents will be listed.

  Also,  at  offset  184  (sector  32)  is  a  byte that determines if the
  filename  gadget  'remembers'  filenames.  If set to 01, the gadget will
  come  up  empty  each  time the requester opens.  If set to 00, the last
  filename  entered  will  be  'remembered'  and  will  appear in the name
  gadget.  Your choice.

@Node MidiSyn

Requirements:
 - MIDI interface connected to serial port (RS-232).  Multiple serial
   ports are not supported, you have to use the standard port.
 - MIDI equipment (preferably a keyboard or a sequencer).
 - Old NTSC machines requires ECS-Agnus.


Features:
 - A **very Very VERY NICE-LOOKING** MIDI keyboard simulator.  Its
   purpose is to display incoming MIDI messages on screen.
 - MidiSyn does nothing useful, it's just a kind of demo.
 - Option to copy MIDI In to MIDI Out (useful if your MIDI interface
   doesn't has a MIDI Thru connection).
 - MidiSyn is written completely in 100% optimized Assembler.
 - Always 50Hz refresh rate on a standard 7MHz Amiga!!
 - Disables all interrupts, then uses hardware directly.  It's tricky
   to restore all hardware registers before exit.  However, my routines
   are very reliable.
 - No extra memory allocation needed.  MidiSyn loads into a 35KB
   ChipMem block.

@Node 01w-Driver

  This  archive contains a PatchMeister driver I just created for the Korg
  01/W  synthesizer.  I created it for the Pro-model but I guess it should
  work  with  the other models as well.  (The PatchMeister is an universal
  SysEx  librarian  from Blue Ribbon Soundworks.) Please feel free to pass
  this  driver  around.  I haven't experienced any real bugs in the driver
  but I will not make any guarantees that bugs are none-existant here......


  01W-series  driver  for  The  PatchMeister  from Blue Ribbon Soundworks.
  Created by Espen Beranek Holm in October 1993.

@Node GMP

  This  program  allows  you  to  create/store new sounds PATCHES for your
  synth(s)  in REALTIME.  This new version allows you to deeply operate on
  the  sound  parameters.   In  fact from version 1.0 to 1.1 the number of
  editing  parameters  passed from about 14 to about 100!!!  and it's name
  has  changed  from  Step By Step Patcher to General Midi Patcher (a more
  comprehensive  name !).  It has been developped for making sound editing
  operations  as  easy  as  possible for making your brain concentrated on
  your new sounds (JOKE!).

@Node Oscillograph

  This  is the translation of the german documentation.  Please excuse the
  mistakes.

  OSCILLOGRAPH  changes  your Amiga into an oscillograph.  The program can
  simulate  an XY-oscillograph (from now on called software-oscillograph),
  and  if you have an analogue-digital-converter, can make AD-gaugings and
  act as a real oscillograph (hardware- oscillograph).

  With  the software-oscillograph you can put nearly all kinds of periodic
  oscillations on X and Y of the oscillograph, and so study the effects of
  combining  two  oscillations.   For  that  you  not  only can choose the
  oscillations,  but  change  the  frequencies  and  the  phase.  And as a
  special  effect  you  can  let  the program change the phase continually
  (with  adjustable  speed), which results in interesting animations (so I
  have called this effect "animation").

  For  the AD-gaugings the program has been prepared to utilize the "AMIGA
  SOUNDER" digitizer (this four channel digitizer was published in Germany
  by Markt&Technik).  Alas there doesn´t exist a norm for audio digitizers
  on the Amiga, so it possibly won´t work with the digitizer You have.  If
  the  program  doesn´t  recognize  a  digitizer  some  features  won´t be
  available,  but  the  software- oscillograph will still work, and that´s
  the main part of OSCILLOGRAPH.

@Node Smusmidi

  The  standard  MIDI  file  format,  defined in "Standard MIDI Files 1.0"
  published  by  the  International  MIDI Association, is an international
  format for the exchange of MIDI event recordings, and may be so for many
  years  to  come.  SMUS (Simple Music) format, defined by Electronic Arts
  and   Commodore   Business  Machines,  Inc.,  is  still  being  used  by
  multi-media programs; I can't estimate it's life.  It is one of two file
  formats  produced  by  DMCS  from  Electronic Arts (TM).  The other is a
  proprietary  IFF  form  with  private chunks.  The proprietary DMCS file
  holds more information than SMUS format, but it is not publicly defined.
  SMUS format is publicly defined, as is Standard MIDI File format.

  Although  some  multi-media programs for the Amiga use SMUS format, MIDI
  sequencing programs almost universally use Standard MIDI File format, in
  addition  to  private formats that hold more information, just as DMCS's
  proprietary  format does.  The current commercial SMUS-MIDI converter is
  available  as  an  add-on  to another program for a total of hundreds of
  dollars.   Many  people  have  written  music in DMCS, only to later buy
  inexpensive  modern  MIDI sequencing software, and find that they cannot
  transfer the old files to the new program.

  This  program,  SMUSMIDI, makes it possible to transfer DMCS SMUS output
  files  to  a  modern MIDI sequencing program by converting the DMCS SMUS
  file to Standard MIDI File format.

  SMUSMIDI does not:

	1.  Convert SMUS forms that are embedded in other IFF files.
	2.  Convert all SMUS files, for example, those output by software other
		than DMCS.
	3.  Support file icons
	4.  Require a MIDI hardware interface or use internal Amiga voices.

  SMUSMIDI was compiled with SAS/C 5.1a.

  HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

  SMUSMIDI  probably  would run on an Amiga with 512K bytes of memory.  To
  estimate  the  amount  of  memory  needed for a conversion, multiply the
  length  of  the  SMUS file in bytes times five.  To find its length, use
  the AmigaDOS list command.

  This  is  a  upgrade  of  ProTracker  1.3/2.0B, and is not based on PT's
  released  after  the  original  release  of  PT1.3 by Amiga Freelancers,
  therefore  you  may find features implemented in Pre PT1.3 releases that
  this  version  lacks.   However  we  hope  that you'll find this release
  better  than  the other PT's around :) We will ship new releases as soon
  as  bugs  are fixed, and new features are implemented.  Final release is
  scheduled to the Easter of '93.

  ProTracker 3.01 was developed from April '92 to January '93 by Ivar Just
  Olsen,  Tom  Bech and Bjarte Andreassen.  Thanks to these people without
  whom this program would not have been possible:

  For  demonstration music:  Gregorian3 by Krest and Vortex, EX-T-Sheep by
  Vortex.

  Amiga  Freelancers  (especially Lars Hamre) for releasing the Sourcecode
  of  PT1.3/2.0B,  Janne  S.   for  numerous  suggestions  and bugreports,
  Guardian  for  testing  PT  on  his NTSC '040 Amiga, ALFred and U4IA for

  This  archive contains source for protracker 1.2 (and 2.0) plus graphics
  in IFF, RAW and my own PAK format (RLE coding).

  The  sources are 100% 68000 assembler and sparsely commented.  I take no
  responsibility for what will happen it you try to do anything with them.
  The  code  was  assembled  using  Hisoft Devpac 2 and 3 using NO include
  files.   Known  bugs  in the 1.2 version are the sampler (not the sample
  editor)  and  problems  with  requesters that does not originate from PT
  (like R/W errors).

  hsi!genly!ang!thanos@uunet.uu.net (Thanos Angelopoulos) has written this
  patch to make the input handler code work with 2.04.  This in not in the
  current  1.2  source.   You  should put it there yourself, and change my

  NewTracker  is  a  clone  of  the famous tracker music-programs.  What's
  different with this version, is that it uses the system-routines to open
  screens, windows, etc.  It also requires V37 or higher in order to work.

  Thanks  to Nico François for the two great libraries powerpacker.library
  and reqtools.library.  NewTracker uses these a lot.

  Features of this version of NewTracker:
    - loads  MED-modules  (MMD0  and  MMD1)  with automatic conversion of
      commands
    - automatic loading of powerpacked files
    - also possible to save using powerpacker.library
    - samples upto 128k
    - works on AGA-machines (developed on A1200)
    - fully multitasking with other programs running at the same time
    - uses the filerequester of reqtools.library
    - loads packed ST/NT/PT-songs (I think)
    - you can change tempo using gadgets
    - clocks telling time and playtime of song
    - play-list editor shows SEVEN entries, not just one
    - possibility to print block or hole song
    - scopes added at the bottom of the screen
    - improved VU-meters
    - PLST is now implemented (unlimited number of entries)
    - Bigger font (7 points high)

Limitations of this version of NewTracker:
    - "Save Sample" isn't implemented

  If you also think that Symphonie is a breakthrough in Amiga soundquality
  think  about  this:   Symphonie  would  also run on a A1000 of 1986 if I
  didn't  use  the  expanded 020 assembler instructions, because the paula
  chip  producing the sound has never changed since then.  (But protracker
  led into the wrong direction, until today...)

  link  EMods  together in a list to be played in sequence.  The interface
  allows  much  flexibility  in  how EMods are played.  Digital Aesthetics
  takes  very  little processor time, and is meant to be used to provide a

@Node AGMSRS_v8

  AGMSPlaySound  is  a  Modula-2  program by Alexander G.  M.  Smith which
  plays arbitrarily large IFF and raw sound samples from disk.

  Sound Samples

  Since  AGMSPlaySound  doesn't load the whole sample into memory, you can
  play  samples longer than your memory size (up to 2 gigabytes).  It also
  leaves lots of memory free for other uses (such as running several other
  AGMSPlaySounds  simultaneously, for quadraphonic sound :-).  Unlike some
  other  sound  playing  programs, AGMSPlaySound can play from floppy disk
  without annoying pauses.  It achieves this performance by processing the
  IFF  file  headers  and locating the sound data before starting to play.
  It  also  opens  all  the files before playing so that no time is wasted
  during playback.

@Node OmniPlay

  Well,  here  you  go.   OmniPlay is an Amiga sound player that reads and

  linear-16),  WAV,  VOC,  signed  raw,  unsigned raw, and raw u-law sound
  formats.   OmniPlay determines the sound type on its own, so you needn't
  tell  it what format something is (although you can if you wish), and it
  reads  all relevant playback information from headered formats (although
  you  can  override  these  on the command line).  Additionally, optional
  properties  of  a  formatted  sound  (e.g.,  IFF's NAME, AUTH, etc.) are
  (optionally)  printed  to  the  output stream (usually console) whenever
  encountered  in a file.  OmniPlay also plays PowerPacked sounds, as long
  as  they  decompress to one of the above formats.  Furthermore, OmniPlay
  is  as fast as or faster than the average sound converter, and can parse
  a  sound  file  quickly enough to keep up with the audio device.  Unless
  you  need  IFF  sounds  for another application, there's no real need to
  convert sounds.

  WHAT IS THE SOUND MACHINE?
  ==========================

  The  Sound  Machine  is  a  set of two programs for your Amiga that will
  enable  you  to  load  and play sound samples that are commonly found on
  IBM-type  systems.   It  will  also  enable  you  to save files in these
  formats.   This  makes  it  very useful for people who frequent computer
  bulletin-board  services,  as  it  opens  up  an entire library of sound
  files.

  There  is  a  simpler  version of The Sound Machine called 'SMPLAY' that
  should  have  included in this archive.  It is a CLI-only version of the
  program  that only plays sound files.  It is useful for your C directory
  as  it  takes up less memory and is good for those who like the keyboard
  more than the mouse.

  The Sound Machine presently reads and writes the following formats:

	IFF - the format used on the Amiga, in 8SVX form.

	RAW - RAW audio data, which most sound programs will load.

	WAV - The "Wave" format, most commonly used in MicroSoft Windows.

	VOC - The "Voice" format, from Creative Labs (they make the
						SoundBlaster for the IBM).


  WHAT ISN'T THE SOUND MACHINE?
  =============================

  The  Sound  Machine  is NOT A SOUND EDITOR!  Although you can change the
  playback  rate  and  "flip"  signed samples, it does not actually do any
  editing on the sound files.

  The  Sound  Machine  isn't  the  perfect  sound  converter,  either.  At
  present,  it  does  not support writing 16 bit samples (although it will
  convert them to 8-bit for playback)

  For  what  most  people  will want, however, it does everything.  If you
  would  like  to see more sound formats supported, please write and we'll
  see what we can do.

  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
  ====================

  The  Sound Machine will run on any Amiga with 512k and OS 1.2 or higher.
  It has been tested with an Amiga 3000 running AmigaDOS 2.1, and an Amiga
  1000 running 1.3.

  Under  2.x  or  3.x, the program will use the ASL File Requester.  Under
  1.2  or  1.3, you will need to install the "REQ.LIBRARY" (provided) into
  your LIBS directory.  Do this with:

      copy req.library libs:

  Please  note  that  'SMPLAY', the companion player-only program does not
  require either of these libraries.

  this program in early 87 and there have been 5 versions out.  I have not
  put  out a new version in quite a while and thought I would play with it
  some  more  since  I have gotten better at my programming skills.  Since
  there  were  so  many new changes, I decided to release it as 2.0.  Hope
  you  enjoy  BMP  and  thanks  to  all  those  who  had sent in shareware

@Node Play16

     -- Play16 version 1.1 - a versatile soundplayer for the Amiga --


  Features in brief
  -----------------
   - autodetects and plays several soundfiles, up to 16 bit / 56 kHz / stereo
   - correct playback speed, even for sounds >28 kHz
   - plays mono sounds on *both* channels, not only on the left one
   - plays files that are larger than memory
   - fast uLaw decompression
   - system friendly audio channel allocation
   - supported Filetypes are:

   * Microsoft RIFF-WAVE  (.WAV)  mono / stereo, 8 / 16 bit, linear / uLaw
   * Sun/NeXT Audio       (.AU)   mono / stereo, 8 / 16 bit, linear / uLaw
   * MacroSystem MAUD     (.MAUD) mono / stereo, 8 / 16 bit, linear
   * Apple/SGI/Amiga AIFF (.AIFF) mono / stereo, 8 / 16 bit, linear


  What do I need to use Play16?
  -----------------------------
  Any Amiga running Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 or greater.


  What does it do?
  ----------------
  Basically,   Play16  is  capable  of  playing  uncompressed  and  *some*
  compressed  soundfiles  through  Amiga's  standard audio device.  If the
  actual  resolution  or playback rate exceeds that of the Amiga hardware,
  realtime conversion is done so that the sound is being played correctly.

  You  can even play 16 bit / 44.1 kHz sounds, providing all parts of your
  system  can  keep  up  with  the  high  data  transfer  rate and lots of
  calculations  needed  for this task.  (In this case an accelerated Amiga
  is recommended :-)

  '000  is  better  than the performance ratio of the '030 to an '020, and
  not much less than '030 to '000.  Essentially, '030 users lose little by
  using  an  '020  binary,  but '020 users gain much by not using the '000
  version.  This solution, then, maximizes the benefit distribution.

  Changes from patchlevel 8 to patchlevel 8 include:
    - new high-pass filter
    - modified WAVE handler to accept RIFF's optional properties
    - miscellaneous fixes elsewhere

  As  an  Amiga  user, you benefit from better documentation; the docs for
  public  SOX  have  not  been  updated in a long while, but I updated the
  [pt,tt,n]roff, ascii, and AmigaGuide manuals.

@Node Smus2Mod

  smus2mod  converts  a  SMUS  music  file  into a SoundTracker compatible
  MODule.   The SMUS file's instruments are not converted, but their names
  are  used  in  the MODule.  The MODule can then be loaded into a tracker
  program  such  as MED or SoundTracker, where the appropriate samples can
  be added.

  To  make  adding  the  samples  easier, the octave of each instrument is
  appended to the sample name in the MODule.  In a SMUS file it's possible
  for an instrument to be used, but not named.  In that case an underscore
  character followed by the octave number will be the sample name.

  MODules  can  have  samples  in  only  three  octaves,  but  SMUS files'
  instruments  do not have that limitation, so if an instrument spans more
  than three octaves, a new sample will be required.  The name of this new
  sample will be the same as the original sample, but the octave number at
  the  end  of it will be three higher, and the sample itself will have to
  be  three octaves higher.  (with MED you can easily change the octave of
  a sample)


  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

  - Notes which are either below octave 1 or above octave 6 are simply
    treated as rests.
  - If a SMUS file is too long and cannot fit in 64 blocks, a message is
    printed, and the MODule will only contain whatever fits.
  - The SMUS file cannot have more than 31 instruments (less if some
    instruments span more than 3 octaves).
  - The  SMUS  standard  also  allows  for  triplets,  quintuplets,  and
    septuplets.
    These  modify  the length of the current note or rest in the following
    way:
      triplet note    = 2/3 normal note
      quintuplet note = 4/5 normal note
      septuplet note  = 6/7 normal note
    n-tuplet  notes  are  not  handled  by  smus2mod,  and  when  they are
    encountered  in a SMUS file, they are treated as a regular note, and a
    message  is  printed  on  the  screen disclosing their position in the
    MODule.   Once  the  MODule is loaded into a tracker, some cutting and
    pasting  may  be  required  to correct the timing problem.  The reason
    that N-tuplets are not supported by smus2mod is that the length of the
    MODule would increase by a great deal, and they are not very common.

   ModInfo   is  a  program  to  count  all  effects  in  a  soundtracker,
   noisetracker or protracker module.  The module maybe in old format ( 15
   samples  ) or in the newer format ( 31 samples ).  Modules with only 15
   samples  may  not  always recognized correctly but this shouldn't cause
   any problems.  ModInfo can be used from cli or from the workbench.  The
   program is able to handle powerpacked modules so it is not necessary to
   decrunch  before.   ModInfo  is  a pure program meaning you can made it
   resident.   I  wrote this program to select modules to test a rewritten
   protracker replayer.  The program requires at least Kick 1.2 ( yes i am
   still  using  a  A500  with kick 1.2, but i will update soon to a newer
   machine !  ).  Should work on all other systems too ( only tested on my

@Node OptiMod

  OptiMod  is  a  utility to optimize NoiseTracker and ProTracker modules.
  All  modules  must  be  in  the  31  instruments  fileformat  and  be  a
  ProTracker/NoiseTracker module.  ie OptiMod won't accept any StarTrekker
  or  15  instruments SoundTracker modules.  To use OptiMod on any of them
  please  load  them  into  ProTracker (or some other Tracker) and save it
  again.

  OptiMod started when I saw that most modules were longer than they would
  have  to  be.   And  the  stupid  fileformat  of modules doesn't make it
  shorter.   Some  other  authors  have  already  tried  to do this but in
  another  way:   Azatoth  of Phenomena with his ProPacker, but it changed
  the  whole  format  and  deleted all instrument names etc.  But by using
  OptiMod  with the NewPM option, and then crunch/archive them you'll gain
  about 10% than just crunching it.

  YOU'LL SAVE ABOUT 40-50% WITH   NEWPM OPTION + LhA   (by Stefan Boberg)

  But  now  with  OptiMod  you  can  optimize  modules and they will sound
  EXACTLY the same.  OptiMod will try to do these things:

@Node ProRunCrack

  This  program  was  written  to convert ProRunner2.0 files back into the
  normal pt module format.  ProRunner2.0 by Cosmos of Sanity strips unused
  pattern,samplenames  and  compacts  the other patterns to an own format.
  So  the  file  becomes  shorter to gain memory space.  The format can be
  easily  recognized  by  the first four bytes 'SNT!'.  Because of the new
  format you can't play these mods with protracker.  When the conversation
  is  done  it  is  again  possible  to  use  the  file  with  protracker.
  ProRunCrack is able to read a powerpacked prorunner file.  The file will
  be  decrunched  and after that it will be converted.  The program can be
  started  from  CLI  or  launched from the workbench ( no tooltypes !  ).
  ProRunCrack  is  a  pure  program  meaning  it can be made resident.  It
  requires  at  least  kickstart  1.2.  Should work an all other systems (
  only tested on a A500 with 2.3 meg ).

@Node XModule_2.8

  The  Amiga  computer  has  standard  file formats almost for everything.
  Graphics,  text,  animations,  hypertext  and  many other data types are
  easily imported into any program that supports the given standards.  But
  this  isn't  true  for music.  Too bad the music interchange file format
  defined  by Electronic Arts (the old IFF SMUS) was too poor to be usable
  in high-quality music sequencers.  Therefore, every music editor created
  its  own  proprietary  module  format, so that, for instance, you cannot
  load into ProTracker music written with Oktalyzer.

  XModule  (pronounced  Cross Module) is a music module conversion utility
  that tries to solve this problem.  The project started in early 1993, as
  a  friend of mine (Fabio), who wrote a lot of (good) music on Oktalyzer,
  needed  ProTracker  to  obtain  certain  effects.   He  had  an  old  PD
  conversion  program  called  `Tracker',  that  worked only in particular
  conditions  and  was  really bogus.  So, I decided to contact the author
  and he let me have the source for Lit30000 (about $20).

  The  original program has been completely rewritten from scratch, as the
  source  was  really poorly coded.  At the moment, Oktalyzer, ProTracker,
  NoiseTracker  and  SoundTracker  are the only supported formats, but I'm
  still developing XModule, so contact me if you want to see your favorite
  music editor added to this (short) list (see Author).

  Now XModule sports many other features, like module optimization, a nice
  user  interface  and complex module editing.  This is why I like to call
  XModule a module processor.  XModule stands to the music processing like
  ADPro or ImageFX stand to image processing (am I a bit immodest?).

                  IT  NEEDS  KICKSTART  2.04+  (V37+) !!
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



  New Features in this V2.11 :
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - "Scan Buffer" which looks for a memory buffer allocated
                  either by Exotic Ripper or ChipSaver, and then
                  scans directly in this memory for modules !

  - "Free Buffer" which deallocates the buffer and
                  frees the memory.   Also displays Available Memory Status.

  - Several OPTIONAL functions like : Quit-Confirmation,
                  Enter Author's name, Edit SampleTexts, PlayTime
                  calculation & insertion in the DOS_Comment, and
                  Saving of the original (packed) module too...

  - Modifications in the Graphic User Interface ! All formats
                  now appear in a listview (no more checkboxes), and
                  another listview is used to display all the actions
                  that Pro-Wizard makes (kind of history).

  - Main window is re-sizeable in its heigth (maxi 512).

  - Colors allowed in reqtools requesters, gadtools gadgets,
                  window titles.... (Patch fixed !! v2.1 ---> v2.11)

  - Public Screen ! So you can put Delitracker's window on
                  Pro-Wizard's screen ;-)
                  In order to play the just-converted modules
                  without swapping screens !
  
  - New Recognized Formats (10). Total = 50 !

                  - The Player v4.0a - v4.0b - v4.1a
                  - Tracker Packer 1 - 2 - 3
                  - NoiseTracker Compressed (Fixed! v2.1 ---> v2.11)
                  - Polka Packer ;-)
                  - Power Music
                  - SoundTracker Pro 3.0

  - P60A modules with packed/delta samples are now recognized !!

  - Reqtools File-Requesters are now REFRESHED.

  - Iconify Window's positions are saved in the preferences.

  - Come back to "Right Mouse Button" to Uniconify.

  - Several check-routines improved and/or debugged.

  - Internal "Help-Mode" (as the mousepointer states...)

  - The "Status-Window" texts can be saved in a file (ANSI-form).

  - Edit SampleTexts option : so that you can enter some texts
                  in the sample_names. (Module's provenance, compodate,
                  informations about the author, or whatelse you want).

      IMPORTANT : Pro-Wizard now checks if there are some empty
      ~~~~~~~~~   text lines before inserting its informations (original
                  format, ripped & converted by....., etc...).
                  This, to avoid erasing of important data
                  like the author's name & address... Cool ehh ?

  - PlayTime calculation option, and insertion at the beginning
                  of the saved module's DOS_Comment.

  - Saving of the Original (packed) Module as well as the
                  converted module (this is optional !). Useful for
                  those who want to use the packed modules with
                  Deli-Wizard (Delitracker-2's Genie).



    So what !?? Is this enough ?? héhé..         (who said NO !?!? :-)

@Node Mod2Midi

  Mod2Midi - What it does
  ======================
  Mod2Midi  is  a  program which converts music modules generated by Amiga
  tracker programs (MOD files) to general MIDI format 1 (MID files).  Some
  editing  of  the output MID file might be necessary, but next time there
  will be less editing to do as Mod2Midi can remember previous settings.


  Why convert MOD files to MID files?
  ===================================
  Even  though  MOD  files  contain some music-instructions that cannot be
  represented in MID format, there are many reasons why it is desirable to
  have music in MID form rather than MOD form:

  * Top-of-the-range music editing programs do not handle MOD files, but
    almost  always handle MID files, or at least allow you to convert from
    MID files.

  * There exist programs to print out MID files as musical score.  I don't
    know of any which do the same for MOD files

  * MID files tend to be much smaller than MOD files

  * MID  files  are  more  portable,  having a well-known format, and have
    utilities on many different computers.  MID files _ARE_ the industry
    standard.

  * MID files can be played on professional keyboards, allowing expert
    recording/presentation of music

@Node NoiseConverter

  Noiseconverter  is a FREEWARE tool to rip and convert Protracker related
  Modules  like Propacker, Prorunner, Noisepacker etc.  It is able to load
  those  formats  and save the modules in the format you like (Protracker,
  Quadracomposer, Art of Noise and lots more).  It requires Kickstart 2.04
  (V37)  and  Reqtools.library.   From  Kickstart 3.0 on locale.library is
  supported.  Currently English, German and Dutch catalog files.

  Some features:

  - completely  font sensitive  gadtools window, style guide conform, easy
    to use
  - Keyboard support for simple one key strokes
  - decrunches almost every file using XPK and XFDMaster.library
  - supports localization (Kick2.1+)
  - direct   Eagleplayer   support  (Grab  module  from  /  send module to
    Eagleplayer + additional commands)
  - complete module informations including playtime calculation
  - auto detect of the module formats
  - built in Ripper  for almost all supported  formats including depacking
    ability for most usual file packers.  That means you can load an intro
    or  file  demo  of  your choice and when it was packed with a cruncher
    supported by XFDMaster.library it will be decrunched automatically and
    the  ripper  will  start  immediately after that.  No need to put your
    mouse away and use Command line commands for that task.
  - automatically adds the right prefixes for the saved formats (of course
    compatible to the Eagleplayer/ExoticRipper ones)
  - written of course 100 % in Assembler
  - saves the last used paths into "env:" and "envarc:" so every time you
    start Noiseconverter you can continue where you stopped your work, of
    course uses separate paths for load and save operation
  - able  to  remove  wrong  tempo  commands  used  in  modules like e.g.
    =Mod.face   another  day"  by  Jogeir  Liljedahl,  "Prun.techdust"  by
    hobbes/Infect or "Prun.Russian Theme" by TDK
  - able to rebuild damaged or wrong Patterndatas produced e.g. by the old
    "Perverter" tool, as second example I only want to mention "Mod.Project
    X Title" (it seems that most people only have got the damaged version)
  - possibility to alter the modulename
  - renaming of samples + saving as IFF8SVX supported
  - currently 19 different module formats at saving including splitting of
    modules into songs + samples
  - own, correct working Prorunner 2.0 saver included
  - option to set the author`s name into the module
  - online help
  - Virtual Memory support, VMM and Gigamem tested
  - written on a turbocharged machine, enforcer and mungwall proof
  - support for Chipsaver, ExoticBoot and Exotic mempatch

@Node Sam-Pull

  Sam-Pull  is a utility for WorkBench 2.0+ which allows you to manipulate
  and save the samples of a music module, (only the Noise/Sound/Protracker
  MOD   format   for  now),  in  a  user-friendly  and  efficient  graphic
  environment.   In  addition,  Sam-Pull features a sub-program which will
  scan for MODs in memory, on any format of disk, and in files.

@Node Hunter

  HunterIII  is  a  sample  ripper.  Basically, this means it is a program
  which  will  allow  you to use voices, instruments or sound effects from
  games or demos that you cannot re-create or re-sample yourself.


  How does HunterIII "rip" samples ?
  -------------------------------
  All  sounds  that  the  Amiga  plays in games or demos must obviously be
  stored  somewhere  in  memory.   HunterIII works by allowing you to play
  these chunks of memory through your audio output.  All YOU have to do is
  listen  to  the  sounds  being  played  back  to  you until you hear the
  instrument,  voice or sound effect you want to save, and then adjust the
  size  of the sample until you have no "garbage" being played back.  Then
  you may save the sample in either the IFF standard file format, as a raw
  dump  of  memory,  or as part of an AMOS bank.  The raw dump option will
  create  a voice suitable for use in most music composition software such
  as SoundTracker, NoiseTracker, Med, Oktalyzer etc.

	*   Runs on Workbench saving approx 40K of Chip RAM
	*   Detaches for CLI
	*   Load/Save AMOS Banks
	*   Remove/Add samples to AMOS Banks
	*   Uses REQ file requester - Well I think its better than the ARP
	    one.
	*   Configures to the amount of Chip RAM you have.
	*   Sleep Mode
	*   Loads Powerpacker Data files (Not programs)
	*   Does anything the old version did!

	- Now select yourself what you want to search for!
	- SEARCH-Button: First looks for PT-replay, then for
	  PT-module, and at last for a NP2-module.
	- EDIT-Function removed, may be realized in future...
	  Save the samples with Protracker, that should be
	  no prob for you.
	- Information-Gadget: Opens window and shows title,
	  length and location. If I have in future enough
	  motivation, I will expand this window to display all
	  instruments with the chance of editing, playing and saving.
	- TURBO-Switch: If TURBO is activated, A-Ripper will
	  switch off Multitasking, IRQs and DMA, so it has
	  all CPU-time! Otherwise it searches without disabling
	  anything.
	- Works fine on OS2.0 and FFS-Devices and ramdisk
	- SAVE-Button simply saves the module named in the string-gadget
	- Aripper won't find tunes with 15 samples, because
	  nowadays nobody uses the old tracker...
	- Replay-search goes now first Chip, then Fastmem
	  because most demos are assembled absolutely in chipram.
	- Replaysearch looks for PT-replay
	- PTmodulesearch now faster and safer! Aripper checks now
	  the whole song on correct notes!
	- Aripper respects at offset 1084: M.K., FLT4, FLT8.
	  Otherwise AR will put M.K. instead.
	  (e.g. on "NORIP"-mods with NORI at 1084)
	- Checks free space on disk before saving, even on ramdisk!

  JukeBox  is a program to play compact digital audio discs by emulating a
  graphical  user  interface  similar to common cd players.  It provides a
  command  line oriented, fully programmable ARexx user interface as well.
  It  will  work on CD-ROM players plugged to a scsi-hostadapter.  JukeBox
  will  open its windows on the workbench (or any other public screen with
  intuition  V36+)  and do its best to allow a font sensitive layout.  The
  main  goal  during development was to create a very comprehensive, self-
  explanatory utility.

@Node CDTV-PLAYER

  The idea for this program came up to me, as I was sitting in front of my
  CDTV  and  wanted  to  listen to some music and do some work at the same
  time.   There  is the possibility to press the play button while working
  on  Workbench, but nothing else than the track number will be displayed.
  The  other possibility to play Audio-CD's was to forget multitasking and
  use  the  built-in  player-screen.  I thought that this was quite lousy.
  In  the  German  magazine  'AMIGA-DOS'  I  found a little program by Dr.
  Peter Kittel of Commodore - Germany in AMIGA-BASIC.  This program looked
  more like a C-64 program with a lot of PEEKS and POKES.  So I translated
  it  into  KICK-PASCAL (Lines in AmigaBasic vs Lines in Kick-Pascal = 200
  vs  15)  and  designed  a  Workbench-Interface  (September  1992).  This
  program  is FISH-WARE.  Commodore may even include this program into the
  original  CDTV-package  or bundle it with every CD-ROM.  If you use this
  program for commercial matters, please don't forget to mention my name.

  II. Features

  CDTV-Player  2.2  features  quite  a lot of new options.  First of all I
  added  preferences in order to keep the program user-friendly (this will
  be  extended  in  future versions).  Then I've programmed a routine that
  recognizes  the  CD  if it's in the archive (thanks to Frédéric Botton -
  Paris  for his «Gimme_a_CD»-program and the idea).  Then I've introduced
  a  SHUFFLE function and an option to jump to seconds BACK and FORTH.  In
  earlier  version  only  owners  of a CD-ROM-drive could use the program.
  Now everybody with an AMIGA has access to the archive in order to search
  for  a  song  or  just have a look at the program.  I've included now an
  option  called KARAOKE.  If any lyrics are found in the archive they may
  be displayed on-screen.  Now an AREXX-Port has been included in order to
  control the function of the CDTV from other programs.

  instead  of shuffling through windows or screens, clicking on something,
  then finding your way back.

		* Archos' Overdrive/Zappo CD-Rom
		* SCSI CD-Rom drives under Kickstart 3.1
		* Power CD-Rom (Using squirrel pcmcia scsi interface)
		* Commodore CD32 (with SX-1 Module present)
		* SCSI CD-Roms connected to the Squirrel scsi interface.

@Node Jukeboxprog

  JukeBox  is  a great program with many functions normal audio CD players
  don`t have, but I`ve been missing a simple programming function like the
  ones  of  even  the most simple normal CD-players.  Well, you don`t need
  this  very  often,  but  in  my  opinion  it makes the program even more
  perfect.   In order to keep work at a minimum level I decided to combine
  an AREXX-script and a small program.  The script just reads the contents
  of  the inserted CD and passes it to the program using a temporary file.
  The  program  lets  the  user  spectify  the order for playing the audio
  tracks.   When finished, it writes the numbers to another temporary file
  which can be parsed by the AREXX-Script.

 me.  In it's current incarnation it has the following features:

  - read the capacity of a SCSI device
  - read 16 bit raw digital audio off an audio CD (works with Sony CDU
    561 & 8003 & Toshiba 3401) (left/right channel and stereo
    reading supported)
  - read 16 bit raw digital audio off an audio CD and convert to 8 bit
    (left/right channel supported)
  - eject/insert a medium via software control
  - display the Inquiry data of a SCSI device
  - read & interpret a CD-ROM data block address header
  - start/stop the motor on a device
  - read pages via MODE SENSE
  - play audio on a CD-ROM drive (tested with Sony CDU 561 = Apple CD-300
    and Tosiba 3401)
  - read sectors
  - seek to a specified sector
  - display table of contents (TOC) of a CD
  - read subchannel information of a CD (tested with Sony CDU 561)
  - allow/prevent medium removal
  - change the output channel volume of a CD-ROM drive

  landscapes,  colorsets.   When  the  video is finished, you can save the
  module  and  video  data  as  a  "Vidule".   A  vidule  is  a crunchable
  executable  file  which  plays the module and the video.  You can make a
  small  intro  or a big house-demo.  You also can use VideoTracker with a
  GenLock and, for example, make professional movie-titles with colorfonts.

  When  the  module  plays  a  sample,  VideoTracker  shows an "effect" on
  screen.   This  effect  can by a picture, brush, anim, routine, etcetra.
  or  a  combination  of  these.   You  can  edit  for  each  of  the  128
  song-positions the 31 samples and use up to 256 effects in a video.  All
  the explained effects are used in the example-videos.
