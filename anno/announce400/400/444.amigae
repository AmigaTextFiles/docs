		     ANNOUNCING A MAILING LIST FOR
		    The AmigaE Programming Language

For the users of Wouter van Oortmerssen's AmigaE programming language,
and for those interested in this language, a mailing list is forming.

Topics of discussion will cover the full range of Amiga programming using
E, such as graphics, file handling, compiler questions, and more. This
is also the place to keep up on the latest AmigaE information, get news
about AmigaE releases, and find others who share your enthusiasm for
this wonderful new programming environment! And with Wouter van 
Oortmerssen as a member of this list, it's definitely the place to be
if you use AmigaE!

This list is managed by a person (me), not a listserv, so please keep
that in mind when addressing list administration problems. Also, for
now, I would like to ask all participants to resist the temptation to
post large uuencoded binaries to this list. We really must be considerate
of those down the line who may not have the disk space for such posts.

To join the AmigaE mailing list, send an e-mail message to
amigae-request@bkhouse.cts.com. Remember, this request is read by
a person, so you may ask other questions about the list, or ask to
be subscribed at an address differing from where you sent the 
message. I will read each of these, and I'll do my best to answer
your questions and configure things the way you want them. You should
generally send all administrative questions to the request address.
I'm guaranteed to read this mail at least once a day, but it may
take me a couple of days to address questions posted to the list
at large.

One thing you should indicate in your request is whether or not
you want your own postings mailed back to you with the rest of the
list traffic. By default you will receive your own posts.

Bkhouse, home of ArgusNet, is an Amiga 3000/25 running list handling
software that I wrote in AmigaE. We are uucp connected (every two
hours) to a system that is full-time wired to the Internet. Mail
turnaround is pretty fast, all things considered. Messages posted
to the list should be processed and sent to the participants in
a maximum of four hours. If list traffic becomes heavy, I may have
to stretch that window out a bit.

To post  to the list, send your message in an e-mail to:
amigae@bkhouse.cts.com. 

If you have other questions, or you have problems subscribing to 
the list, please let me know at nkraft@bkhouse.cts.com,
nkraft@crash.cts.com or nkraft@ucsd.edu (whichever works best
for you). The first address is, of course, preferred.
