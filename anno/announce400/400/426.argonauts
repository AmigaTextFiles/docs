INTRODUCING ARGONAUTS. After a favorable reception among
registered developers it is being introduced to a wider 
audience.


Argonauts is a quarterly newsletter for the commercially
active Amiganaut. It seeks to help build a business
infrastructure that will make our live easier and more
profitable. Regular features include first person business
accounts of product development, business opportunities,
research papers, news from overseas, a developers roundtable
and more.


Currently we are building a registry of amiga talent,
(publishers, programmers, artists, technical writers). Next
issue we will be introducing $500 challenge prizes. These
will be in the centuries old tradition of offering a prize
to the first person to achieve some specified goal in a set
time. Argonauts is also about putting some fun back into
being in this market. Too many people have forgotten that is
why they originally came here instead of the PC or Mac.


The current issue has articles about Objective-C, DevCon 93,
DICE, European CD-ROM, the registry, developers roundtable
and more. Authors include Sarah Bell, marketing director for
Stepstone Corp, developers of Objective-C, Dan Weiss,
VP R&D Soft-Logik, Carl Rollo, Matt Dillon who needs no
introduction and Janet Bickerstaff from the UK ICPUG.


So take a chance and spend 29 cents to write for a free  
sample copy and subscription information ($24.95 US) to:


Argonauts, Dept. A
Box 94
Pearl River NY 10965 - 0094
USA

Please feel free to upload this to other services such as BIX
and Compuserve etc.
