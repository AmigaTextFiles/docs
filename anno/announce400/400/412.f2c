original freely distributable sources available on netlib.

Amiga port by Eric G. Stern (egstern@fnpx19.fnal.gov)

DESCRIPTION

F2c is a program that translates Fortran 77 into C or C++.  F2c lets
one portably mix C and Fortran and makes a large body of well-tested
Fortran source code available to C environments.

This is a port for the SAS/C 6.2 environment.  The f2c executable
supplied will run on any sufficiently large Amiga, but the support
libraries were assembled for the SAS/C 6.2 librarian and linker.

NEW FEATURES

This release has no new features from the original documented f2c.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

The f2c executable and libraries are large.  A hard disk would
probably be necessary for reasonable use.  Also, the resulting code
generated after conversion and linking is quite large.  Probably 2 or
more megabytes of RAM are needed.  The I/O support library uses some
AmigaDOS 2.0 routines.
