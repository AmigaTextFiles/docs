TITLE

DESCRIPTION

ACE is a PD Amiga BASIC compiler which, in conjunction with A68K and Blink
produces standalone executables. No special run-time shared libraries are 
required.
 
The language is both a subset and superset of AmigaBASIC with many features
not found in the latter such as: turtle graphics, recursion, SUBs with return
values, structures, arguments, include files, a better WAVE command which 
allows for large waveforms, external references, named constants and several
extra functions.

In total, ACE currently supports some 150 commands and functions. 

ACE is still under development, but is quite usable in its present form.

NEW FEATURES (since v1.01)

	- KILL and NAME commands.
	- ON..GOTO and ON..GOSUB.
	- ON <event> GOTO added to Event Trapping
	  (already had ON <event> GOSUB).
	- Improved SAY command. Asynchronous speech is
	  now supported.
	- SAY(n) function added so that asynchronous
	  speech can be monitored and mouth width/height
	  can be read (only works properly under 2.04/higher
	  at the moment).
	- Faster INSTR function.
	- New #include files: fexists.h, julian.h for file
	  existence checking and date calculations respectively.
	- Compiler switch (-i) to create an icon for 
	  the executable produced by ACE.

There were a few bug fixes also. First, string variables were sometimes
being associated with bogus addresses. Second, there was a 32K limit
on branches due to gratuitous use of bsr/bra instructions which was
corrected by use of jsr and combinations of jmp and beq/bne. 

See docs/history and readme.first in the ACE archive for details on these
and other changes. 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	ACE has been tested on machines ranging from an A1000 running Wb 1.3
	with 512K of RAM to a 68030 machine running Wb 3.0 with 5M of RAM. 	

	For moderately large programs to compile however, 1M is required.

	I run ACE on an unaccelerated A500 with 3M of RAM and a 52M 
	hard drive under Wb 2.04.
