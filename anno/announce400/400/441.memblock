NAME
  MemBlocker Version 1.1

INTRODUCTION
  MemBlocker blocks memory. You are able to allocate memory blocks of a
  specified size and release them later. This may be done from Workbench or
  CLI, Kick 37.175 (OS2.04) or greater is needed anyway.

WHY BLOCK MEMORY?
  Blocking memory is usefull for all those with different types of FAST-RAM,
  this is 32-bit and 16-bit ram. Many owners of accelerator cards and some
  other expansion memory have both of these types in their system. When you
  boot your system, the software or hardware of the accelerator assign the
  32-bit ram to the highest memory-priority. So nearly all of this 'fastest'
  ram is used before the 16-bit ram is touched. When there is no more 32-bit
  ram left you suddenly see a significant slowdown after starting a program in
  16-bit ram. So one would like to save as much as possible of the 32-bit ram
  for those programs that need 'fastest' memory.
  One the other hand, there are many programs that don't need 'fastest' ram.
  Comodities, other utilities, diskcaches, buffers and more. Many of these are
  started in the startup-sequence, user-startup or wbstartup-drawer. This is
  where MemBlocker comes in: You block your precious 'fastest' 32-bit ram
  before launching those applications and release it afterwards. So the
  applications are forced to use the slower 16-bit ram.
  But be careful what programs you force into slower ram: devices, handlers,
  simply everything where speed is needed should get 'fastest' ram.
  Another usage might be to shrink your availible memory for test purposes.

DISTRIBUTION
 MemBlocker may be freely distributed, as long as no charge is made other
 than to cover time and copying costs. The package must be distributed as
 the original archive. If you want to include MemBlocker as part of a 
 commercial package, contact the author listed below. Fred Fish is 
 specifically given permission to include MemBlocker in his fine disk 
 library. It is also allowed to put MemBlocker on free accessible BBS's
 or Internet sites.
