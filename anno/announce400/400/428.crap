Announcing the newest online amiga newsletter. Crap contains all the
latest (and some of the oldest) information on games, hardware, music,
programming, coding, reviews, announcements, and more... Trust me its good.
Its so great I can't even bring myself to type out the words to 
explain it. So you will have to find our for yourself. Not convined,
listen to what some of these people had to say:

        "Crap Is So Good, I Stayed In The Bathroom For Two Hours, With My
         Printed Out Copy."      -- Gene Babinsky

        "When You Print Crap Out, It Makes Great Wall Paper"
                                 -- Anonymous

        "Amazing, Outstanding, The Best Movie of 93"
                                 -- Siskely & Edgbert
                                 (Sorry Wrong Announcement - ed.)
