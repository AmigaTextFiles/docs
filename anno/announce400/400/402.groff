DESCRIPTION

        Groff is the GNU version of U*nix troff and associated programs.  
        For those unfamiliar with troff (or ditroff), it is a facility 
        similar to TeX for typesetting and formatting text by embedding 
        commands in the text which are then interpreted by troff to change 
        the way the text is displayed.  For example, you can change 
        attributes like page margins, font, and point size.  You can do 
        formatting operations like centering, filling, and justifying.  
        This does not even begin to describe all the things you can do with 
        groff.  There are whole volumes of text at your local bookstore 
        which do a much better job.  

        Groff is good to use for formatting and displaying text directly in 
        your screen.  In ascii mode, you can print files to PRT: directly.  
        To get even fancier, it is also very useful in conjunction with 
        other programs such as GNU GhostScript (version 2.5.2 available on 
        aminet), Post (version 1.86 available on aminet) and Nenscript for 
        formatting output for postscript drivers.  It should also be suitable 
        for producing dvi output for TeX post-processors.  

        The GNU version of troff comes with all the de facto standard 
        pre-processing programs: eqn for formatting arithmetic expressions, 
        pic for drawing pictures, tbl for formatting tables of data, grap 
        for drawing graphs, neqn, refer, indxbib, and much more!  

        Also included are several post processors including one that causes 
        troff to produce PostScript, ASCII, latin1, and dvi output.  There 
        are several macro packages including man, mm, me, and ms.  Using 
        these macro packages allows you to format documents using higher 
        level expressions designed to make n/troff easier to use. With the
        man macros, you can now display or print all those man page files
        that come with other Un*x packages distributed for the Amiga!

        The Amiga version of groff has been distributed in 2 parts.  One 
        archive (groff-1.07bin.lha) contains a run-time distribution only.  
        It includes all the files you need to install and run n/troff on 
        your Amiga.  Also included are some of the interesting text files 
        from the original distribution.  These were included to help users 
        to use groff more effectively and to resolve problems.  

        If you want to compile and build groff yourself, the archive 
        groff-1.07src.lha contains the source plus patches you need to 
        compile, build, and install groff on your Amiga (using g++ and 
        gmake).  It does not contain any runtime code.  Of course, there 
        are many requirements to do this.  I would only recommend this if 
        you have problems running the version I built.  See the 
        README.amiga file included with the distribution for a list of 
        requirements needed to build groff.  

NEW FEATURES 

        Upgrade from version 1.06 posted earlier this year.  This was a GNU 
        update, see the file ChangeLog in the release for specific 
        features/bug fixes in 1.07.  

SPECIAL REQUIREMENT 

        You probably need KS 2.x for full compatibility with AmigaDOS.  
        This is mostly due to dependencies on ixemul.library which is best 
        suited for 2.x (and higher?) systems.  

        You are encouraged to get and install pdksh on your system so you 
        can take advantage of the shell scripts which come with groff.  
        Pdksh is not required; everything done in shell scripts can be 
        converted to AmigaDOS syntax.  
        
        You need the lha program to unpack the archive.  

HOST NAME

        below).
