DESCRIPTION

    AIBB is a system performance analysis tool complete with a number of
    built in tests and informative displays to provide a full picture of
    performance levels.  Tests are divided into integer, graphics, and
    floating point types to exercise the full range of these system
    attributes.  Comparisons are provided against 4 internally contained
    systems, or any number of others via AIBB's "load module" creation/
    loading ability.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 6.0 of AIBB incorporates a number of new testing options,
     information display changes, and reworking of the tests themselves.
     Graphics-based tests have been changed a great deal, with the ability
     to choose the screen mode used for them under AmigaOS 2.1 or above.
     Various bug fixes from previous versions have also been implemented.
