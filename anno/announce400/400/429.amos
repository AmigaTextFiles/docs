I know, but this is how it was setup here.  amos-list for sending to the list
and amos-request for sending to the administer.

	Attention all AMOS, AMOS Pro, and Easy AMOS coders!  Attention please!!!

	The AMOS mailing list run by David Tiberio is now gone!  :(  Let's
all thank David for his help in setting up the first AMOS mailing list!
(HOOOORAY!)

	However, do not despair!  A new AMOS mailing list is here!  Being
the most obnoxious and loudest AMOS advocate on the network, I have decided to
continue the list!  That's right, I have assumed control!

	To subscribe to the new AMOS list, send mail to:

			amos-request@access.digex.com

In the body of the message, please put:

			SUBSCRIBE	<your email address>

For example, if I wanted to subscribe, I would put:

			SUBSCRIBE	aj639@Cleveland.Freenet.edu

(It is not case sensitive so do not worry about it)

	Okay, now that you have subscribed, this is how you send a message to
everyone on the list.  Compose your message as normal and send it to:

			amos-list@access.digex.com

	That is all you do!  Everyone, including yourself, will get a copy of
your message.  What a great way to find out about updates and ask questions
about anything relating to AMOS!

	If you want to send me mail concerning the list, such as to unsubscribe,
heaven forbid, send it to the amos-request address.  If you are unsubscribing,
heaven forbid, put UNSUBSCRIBE in the Subject line.

	So what are you waiting for?  Subscribe then send a message to amos-list
introducing yourself and telling everyone what you do with AMOS!

	For those unaware of what AMOS, Easy AMOS, or AMOS Pro is, here is short
description:

All AMOS flavors (Easy, Pro, Creator) are a BASIC language with many advanced
commands to give you complete control over your Amiga.  AMOS is geared toward
providing the most power with the least amount of work on the part of the
coder.  There are over 700 commands that allow you to open screens, play music,
move sprites/BOBs, detect collisions, create menus, change fonts, scroll text,
math computations, disk access, and interface with machine language code.
AMOS Pro is the most powerful.  Easy AMOS is designed for beginners and AMOS the
Creator is in the middle.
	If you have questions about what else AMOS can do, just send a message
to the list and I am sure several people will answer.  If you are not subscribed
you may want to say this in the message to make sure that those replying will
mail you directly.

Mike
