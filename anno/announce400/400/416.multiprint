To Dan Zerkle,
  please post this on the Comp.Sys.Amiga.Announce news group.
  This should be the last update for a while, and it has
  significant improvements/bug fixes. (Yes, I know I said that
  last time :-) )

Let me know if you have any problems with it.

DESCRIPTION

     MultiPrint is a program initially designed to print
     document files, and other text files, to as few sheets
     of paper as possible. It has since had other features
     such as bold/italic/font support, Compugraphic support,
     paragraph reformating and full justification added
     for improved flexability and readability.
     
     MultiPrint prints text files to multiple columns, on
     both sides of the sheet automatically, with no need
     to shuffle the pages.
     
     Pages are printed with a footer, with margins, page
     numbers, and with a gutter to allow easy stapling,
     or hole punching.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 1.8 fixes a few bugs that crept into the last
     released version, and adds a few significant features.

    Bugs fixed :
      1. Persistant bug with centering in non-reformatting mode fixed.
      2. Fixed bug with inter-process communication, which caused the
         program to jam sometimes when aborted.
      3. Aborting print fixed when a command-line option is misspelt,
         resulting in a non-existant file message.
      Maybe more. It's easier to debug with the preview option present.
      Uses less paper when printing to the screen.
    Changes :
      1. Slight redefinition of command format. If you want to place
         formatting commands, in particular Justification and Centering,
         on their own line (they must start the line anyway or they
         will be ignored) without leaving a blank line, leave
         off the closing brace. Alternately, remember to leave the
         closing brace it there is supposed to be a blank line.
      2. Improved preview function, to allow it to run on existing
         (public) screens, especially Workbench.
      3. Improved preview to allow for large 'virtual' screens, in
         one direction (usually height) with autoscroll.
      4. Added spoolling to disk, for those really large files, and
         background printing, where memory is required for other
         things.

    Version 1.9 fixes a few more bugs/misfeatures

    Bugs fixed :
      1. Changed Footer options from xxxFootxxx back to xxxFooterxxx.
         My compiler has trouble with long string constants, so now
         some things are linked in as objects, and the template can
         be as long as necessary.
      2. End-of-paragraph at end-of-page code was commented out during
         testing
      3. LargeScreen option should now (correctly) only give you
         scrolling in one dimension in all displays.
      4. Default Footers now give the name of the first file on a page,
         rather than the last.
    Changes
      1. Made balancing the columns on last pages an option.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     MultiPrint requires 2.04 or higher.
     
     MultiPrint works best with page oriented printers, such
     as lasers and HP deskjets. A fast printer helps.

     MultiPrint provides better output with the use of
     Scalable fonts, and better italics/bold if you have a
     complete family (or more) of Scalable fonts.


HOST NAME

     This version can be found as MultiPrint18.lha on
     amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80), where I uploaded
     it in the new directory.
     
     You could also try wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).
     
     In New Zealand, you can try kauri.vuw.ac.nz.


DIRECTORY

     Should end up in /pub/aminet/text/print, where the last
     version was put.

FILE NAMES

     MultiPrint19.lha, MultiPrint19.readme

PRICE

     MultiPrint is shareware, basically. If you find the
     program useful, or need anything added, and want to
     encourage me, a donation is welcome, but not
     essential.
     
     I would like to make enough money from MultiPrint to
     replace the Ink Cartridge I used most of in testing
     MultiPrint.
     
     Suggestion, US$20 or equivalent, NZ$ if you can get them.
     Any amount is fine though.
     
     Hey, here's ambition ... maybe I could make enough
     to buy a laser printer! :-)


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     Shareware. Distribute to whoever, but if you plan
     to include it in a magazine's cover disk, or anything
     like that - let me know first.
     
     No matter what, leave the documentation intact.
