Emplant by UTILITIES UNLIMITED


	One of the most talked about products on the net has been the
Emplant board by Utilities Unlimited.   In addition, the president of
Utilities unlimited, Jim Drew, has been accused of being everything from
an overconfident fool to a disreputible con-artist.  While at the world
of Commodore-Amiga, I had an opportunity to talk to Jim Drew and to see
the Emplant board in operation.

	First, my impressions of the controversial Jim Drew:

	Jim Drew appeared to be a friendly, intelligent man in his late 20's.
he answered all of the questions he was asked (including some of the really
stupid ones and some of the ones that he had probably been asked a thousand
times during the show) in a forthright manner.  He did not appear to hold a
grudge against anyone (except maybe the infamous Marc Barrett:  He laughed,
when I mentioned that Marc was about the only one who fell for my April 
fool's Day prank (about the new high-end chip to be shown to developers at
WOCA-NYC)).  He said that he recieved one apology from one of the many peo-
ple who attacked him over the net.  In other words, none of the accusations
people made about him appear to have any truth.

Now on to Emplant:

	By now I assume that most people have seen pictures of the product
and descriptions of it's features, so I will skip over them.  However if you 
don't know, then you can get one from the Usenet archives.   The Emplant
board was demoed on two amigas, an A4000 with a 1960 monitor, and an A3000
with a 1084s monitor (which was used to show the way it would look on an
accellerated a2000 or 500.  On both Amigas, they were running a variety of Mac
programs multitasking with Amiga software.  He demoed MS Word, Excel,
Adobe Photoshop, Quark Express, and several others.  The 3000 version was
running in 16 color interlaced 640 x 480 (overscan) mode and the 4000 in 
640 x 480 productivity 256 color mode.  All software was running and looked
good (especially on the 4000).

	I asked him if he had had any reports of software incompatabilities.
He responded that the only program incompatible with the current version of
the emulation software was Apple's own disk copier (he said that it broke
every rule for Mac software).  He commented that he could produce a patch
to fix it (Microsoft software, which also breaks Apple's rules, has been
patched to work).

	I also asked him if and when he would have an emulation of the Mac
32k color mode.  He looked over at his Mac programmer, who responded "about
6 hours after we get back."

	Plans for the next version:  Addition of ability to access Amiga
files from the Amiga partition on the Mac desktop, 32,000 color mode on 
AGA amigas, and possibly addition of a patch to allow the use of an ec030
accellerator (the Mac color system uses the MMU extensively).  He says that
the ability to use all of the other Mac ROMs should be completed by the 
end of September, and 386/486 emulation by the end of the year or the 
beginning of next year.

	All, in all I feel that the Emplant appears to be an excellent
product and Jim Drew seems very dedicated to the enhancement and expansion
of its capabilities and features.   His policy of making upgrades in the
emulation free and expansion (such as 386 emulation) cheap (~ $70), show
him to be committed to customer satisfaction.  I predict that Jim Drew will
soon be a very successful businessman.
