VERSION

DESCRIPTION

  MainActor is a modular animator package.

  It allows you to create,edit,play animations of the provided
  animation formats.

  You can convert any format into any other, allowing you to
  convert for example a range of pictures into an animation format
  of your choice, or resave the frames of an animation to an
  picture format, or simply to convert different picture formats.
  
  The following modules are included in this release:
  
  Animation Loader                           Animation Saver
  ----------------                           ---------------
  IFF-Anim5                                  IFF-Anim5
  IFF-Anim7_16                               IFF-Anim7_16
  IFF-Anim7_32                               IFF-Anim7_32
  IFF-AnimBrush


  Picture Loader                             Picture Saver
  --------------                             -------------
  IFF                                        IFF
                                             ICON

  Features:-
  
  -Intelligent caching/tracking, MainActor can cache your animations and
   picture lists, if you have not enough memory it will directly access
   your data from any device. This makes it for example possible to
   create/edit/play a 400MB animation on your 2MB Amiga.

  -If you run OS 3.0 or higher, you will get an extra speed bonus on
   animations through the use of the new graphics routines.
   For OS2.0/2.1 users there are specific routines in the modules, which
   will give them the best playback speed possible on their system
   (and my knowledge :)).

  -Under OS 3.0 you will get the extra features of showing pictures or
   playing animations in a scrollable, resizable window on your MainActor
   or Workbench screen. The colors will be properly adjusted to your screen
   attributes.

  -The modules have play routines of their own, so it will be possible
   to redirect the input/output of special modules to graphic cards or other
   hardware.
   
  -The play routines support a timecode per frame option. A Sound Module
   (per frame) option will be there in one of the next releases.

  -MainActor has a totally user reconfigureable GUI. The settings of your
   sessions can be saved, this includes the size/position of windows
   as well as the status of the projects.

  -MainActor has an arexx port, nearly all functions can be accessed through
   it. You can for example scale or dither whole animations through
   the use of an image processor, scripts are included.

  -MainActor lets you setup and save nearly everything concerning the
   display mode for playing an animation or showing a picture.
   For example you can set the X/Y offsets, the display mode ID
   of your screen (view) and so on.

  -MainActor supports localization.
