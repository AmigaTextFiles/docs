DESCRIPTION

     This is a game written for the Commodore Installer Utility.
     (no, I'm not kidding)  It runs on the Installer, however it
     installs nothing. Installer just provides an interface to a 
     simple adventure game, where the goal is to "escape from 
     Commodore!"

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Installer binary, v1.24 or higher.
     Whatever system runs installer (show me one that doesn't)

FILE NAME

     InstallerGame.lha

PRICE

     Nada.  FreeWare.  Enjoy it.  I'm just not responsible for it.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     Everywhere your heart desires.
