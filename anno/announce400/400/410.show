Emplant by UTILITIES UNLIMITED


One of the most talked about products on the net has been the Emplant board
by Utilities Unlimited.   In addition, the president of Utilities unlimited,
Jim Drew, has been accused of being everything from an overconfident fool
to a disreputible con-artist.  While at the world of Commodore-Amiga, I had
an opportunity to talk to Jim Drew and to see the Emplant board in operation.

first, my impressions of the controvercial Jim Drew:

	Jim Drew appeared to be a friendly, intelligent man in his late 20's.
he answered all of the questions he was asked (including some of the really
stupid ones and some of the ones that he had probably been asked a thousand
times during the show) in a forthright manner.  He did not appear to hold a
grudge against anyone (except maybe the infamous Marc Barrett:  He laughed,
when I mentioned that Marc was about the only one who fell for my April 
fool's Day prank (about the new High-end chip to be shown to developers at
WOCA-NYC)), he said that he recieved one appology from one of the many peo-
ple who attacked him over the net.  In other words, none of the accusations
people made of him, appear to have any truth.

now on to Emplant:

	By now I assume that most people have seen pictures of the product,
and descriptions of it's features so I will skip over them, however if you 
don't know, then you can get one from the Usenet archives.   The Emplant
board was demoed on two amigas, an A4000 with a 1960 monitor, and an A3000
with a 1084s monitor (which was used to show the way it would look on an
accellerated a2000 or 500.  On both amigas they were running a variety of MAC
programs multitasking with Amiga software, he demoed MS Word and Excel, 
Adobe Photoshop, Quark express, and several others.  The 3000 version was
running in 16 color interlaced 640 x 480 (overscan) mode and the 4000 in 
640 x 480 productivity 256 color mode.  All software was running and looked
good (especially the 4000).   I asked him if he had had any reports of 
software incompatabilities, and he responded tha the only one with the current
version of the emulation software was Apples own disk copier (he said that  
it broke every rule for mac software) he commented that he could produce a
patch to fix it, but that he did'nt do it by choice (microsoft software,
which also breaks apple's rules, has been patched to work).  I also asked
him If and when he would have an emulation of the mac 32k color mode, he
looked over at his mac programmer, who responded "about 6 hours after we get
back".  Plans for the next version:  Addition of ability to access Amiga
files from the amiga partition on the Mac desktop, 32,000 color mode on 
AGA amigas, and possibly addition of a patch to allow the use of an ec030
accellerator (the mac color system uses the MMU extensively).  He says that
the ability to use all of the other mac Roms, should be completed by the 
end of the summer. and 386/486 emulation by the end of the year or the 
beginning of next year.


all, in all I feel that the Emplant appears to be an excellent product and
Jim Drew seems very dedicated to the enhancement and expansion of its capa-
bilities and features.   His policy of making upgrades in the emulation free
and expansion (such as 386 emulation) cheap (~ $70), show him to be commited
to customer satisfaction.  I predict that Jim Drew will soon be a very success-
ful man.

I will submit my next review soon.
