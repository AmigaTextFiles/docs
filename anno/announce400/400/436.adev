DESCRIPTION:   ADev11 is a complete development system for the Motorola
               MC68HC11 processor.  Separately compiled/assembled source
               files are linked to produce an S-record file.  Includes
               C compiler, assembler (a highly modified version of DAsm),
               linker, librarian, disassembler and serial downloader.
               Additionally, the assembler, linker and librarian handle
               source for 6800, 6303 and 68HC16.  For those that dislike
               S-records there is a converter which converts to memory
               dump.  Source for the converter is included.

REQUIREMENTS:  AmigaDos 1.3 or later

NEW FEATURES:  C compiler, bug fixes, some new features and additional library
