DESCRIPTION

	This is the second release of the game which is a clone of
	the popular C64 program.  Amiga Boulder Dash is a multi-
	level single-player game in which the objective is to 
	hunt through a maze of walls, rocks and dirt to collect
	diamonds.  Includes lots of goodies to make the task
	more interesting than a trip to the garden.  Also featured
	in the program is the cave-editor which allows the player
	to create his/her own game screens.

	- Works will all processors (68000-68040)
	- Tested to work in A2000, A3000, A4000

	- Fully function cave editor (with gadtools interface)
	- Much more

CHANGES
	The version uploaded to amiga.physik as V1.1809 was incorrectly
	named;  it was actually version 1.1908.  In addition, at least
	one file was missing, rendering the program unusable.  Version
	1.1909 supplies the missing file, as well as some minor changes
	to the hard-disk installation guidelines in the documentation.
