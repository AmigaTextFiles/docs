     MRsoftare) can upgrade to the current version of MRBackup by
     sending their original program disk plus $10.00 to MRsoftware.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     MRBackup Professional is a commercial program, copyrighted by
     MRsoftware. The demo version of MRBackup Professional, clearly
     indicated by a pop-up requester when the program is started,
     is freely distributable as long as the demo archive is
     distributed in its entirety.

OTHER

     MRBackup Professional has a wealth of features which are not
     easily summed up in such a brief format. A three page laser-printed
     product brochure, giving a more in-depth overview, is available
     upon request.

AND FINALLY

=====================================================================
Dan - I've included this "other" MRBackup feature description simply
as supplemental information.  I don't have ftp access and thus don't
have an easy way to post this as a README file to an ftp site.
However, if you feel it's worthwhile...

Thanks!

MRBackup Professional Feature Overview

Last Update:   04/16/93
Version:	     1.14a
Orders:	     See Ordering Information near the end of this document.

MRBackup  Professional is a feature-laden hard disk backup program for
the Amiga tm family of computers, providing the following features:

7 Employs the Amiga's Intuition graphical user interface. 

7 Context-sensitive hypertext help via AmigaGuide tm 

7 Employs AmigaDOS speech capability as a very effective
  attention-getting device (disk changes,error messages, etc.)

7 Operates under AmigaDOS versions 1.3, 2.04 and beyond. 

7 Backups may be done to floppy, streaming SCSI tape (including DAT)
  or sequential file/device.

7 Highly configurable - different "project" settings can be saved to
  individual files.

7 Provides flexible data compression/decompression with user-tunable
  compression factor.

7 Supports incremental backups via modification date and/or archive
  bit testing/setting.

7 Filename "filters" are provided to enhance backup and restore file
  selection.

7 Rich ARexx command set to provide full or partial control of
  backups/restores  and  parameter  settings.   Scripts  can  be invoked
  externally (rx scriptname) or via user- customizable menu entries.

7 Built-in file management utilities.

7 SCSI tape handler included - may be used with other programs. 
  Multiple savesets may be stored on a single tape.  Savesets may span
  multiple tapes.

7 Many more features.

MRBackup  Pro  sports  3 backup modes - AmigaDOS, "Fast Disk" and SCSI
Tape.   The  "Fast  Disk"  method  outputs data as a sequential stream
containing  embedded  structure  and  error  recovery  information and
enables  much  higher throughput when using floppy disks as the backup
medium.   The  "Fast  Disk" format is also used when writing streaming
SCSI  tape.  Another very special feature of the "Fast Disk" format is
that  it  can  be  directed to/from a file (local or networked) or any
sequential  device.   If  you  are fortunate enough to have your Amiga
hooked  up  to  a  network  with  a high-capacity file server, you can
backup  over  the  network.   To the remote filesystem, the backup set
just  appears  to  be  a  stream  of  bytes.   The Amiga-specific file
attributes  are  safely  encapsulated  in the "Fast Disk" envelope and
therefore  do  not  need  to  be translated into approximations on the
remote   filesystem   (potentially   losing   or   corrupting   useful
information).

[  Note:   the  Fast  Disk  format,  while custom, is not proprietary.
Information  describing  the  Fast  Disk  structure  is  available  to
registered owners of MRBackup Professional upon request.  ]

When running under AmigaDOS 1.3, MRBackup Professional employs the ARP
(Amiga  Resource  Project)  library  for  its  file requester and date
manipulation  support.   When  running under AmigaDOS 2.04 and beyond,
the  Amiga's  standard  ASL  file  requester  is used.  Some users are
confused  by  this,  thinking  that  a  full  installation of ARP (and
replacement  of original Amiga programs) is required.  This is not the
case.   It  is  only  necessary  to  copy  the  library  to your LIBS:
directory (done by MRBackup's installation script) and this will IN NO
WAY interfere with your other software.

MRBackup  Professional  comes bundled with its own tape handler.  Most
of  the  major  vendors' tape drives are currently supported (Archive,
Sony  (DAT),  Wangtek,  Tandberg,  etc.)  and I am committed to adding
support  for  any  other  "standard" drive which can be configured for
Amiga  use.  While SCSI defines, in a general sense, the methods to be
used  when  talking  to  a tape drive, there is a surprising amount of
variability in the capabilities available from the various tape drives
and  the  methods  employed  to  tap those capabilities.  The included
mrtape-handler  builds  upon  a  known  common  denominator  and  then
fine-tunes   itself   by   interrogating   the  drive  for  additional
information.

MRBackup  Pro  supports  software  data compression (LZW method) which
will  allow more data to be packed onto the backup media.  Compression
results will vary with the content of the data, but run typically from
35%  to  65%.   The  user  can  control  the  degree of compression by
selecting  the  number  of  bits  in  the compression codes (12 - 16).
Higher  code  sizes  yield more efficient compression but require more
memory and time to achieve it.

The  user  interface  is  fully  "Intuitionized", allowing the user to
point-and-click  when  setting just about any option.  MRBackup's many
features  are  represented by a series of windows and their "gadgets".
Almost  all  operating parameters may be controlled simply by pointing
and  clicking with the mouse.  The user may load/save custom parameter
sets via menu selection or ARexx control.  When a backup or restore is
initiated, a Status window which reports the progress of the backup or
restore and even provides "buttons" to pause/resume or stop the action
in progress.

MRBackup can be started either from the CLI or the WorkBench.  The CLI
interface  supports  several  optional  command-line  parameters.  The
MRBackup project icon supports several equivalent ToolType entries for
establishing MRBackup's initial operating environment.

If you wish, MRBackup Pro will talk to you, using the Amiga's built-in
speech capability.  This may seem silly until you realize that you can
leave the room and MRBackup will call you when the next floppy disk is
required  for  a backup or restore or when an error condition requires
your intervention.

A  special Utilities window can be activated via menu selection.  This
allows you to perform a number of useful functions on individual files
or groups of files (copy, delete, rename (move), compress, decompress,
set date, etc.).

Incremental backups may be performed, using the file modification date
or  the  file  "archive  bit"  (or  both)  as  the  criteria  for file
selection.   MRBackup Pro can be directed to set each backed-up file's
archive  bit,  as  well.  Filter files (text files containing filename
patterns  - wildcards are supported) can be employed to further refine
the    set    of   files   selected   for   backup   or   to   inhibit
compression/decompression on certain files.

When a backup is started, MRBackup builds a list of all files eligible
for  backup.   This  list  is  presented  to  you  via  a special file
selection  requester  which  has  many  features  for  navigating  and
"pruning"  the  list.   MRBackup  Pro  doesn't  just copy files to the
backup   media   in   the   order   that   they   were  scanned.   All
files/directories  are  output  in  sorted order or in "native" order,
depending  upon  the  user's  preference.   All  file attributes (file
creation/modification   date,  comment,  protection  word,  etc.)  are
preserved by the backup/restore process.

Upon  completion  of  a backup, a "catalog" file describing the backup
set is created and stored at a location of your choosing.  This can be
on  a separate floppy disk or in a special location on your hard disk.
What  if  you lose the catalog file?  No problem!  The Rebuild Catalog
command will let you recreate it.

A  formatted  listing  of your backup set is generated for you, if you
wish.   Also, MRBackup will create a log file of the backup or restore
process,  recording  any  errors or noteworthy events that occur along
the way

Upon  starting  a restore operation, MRBackup Pro reads the previously
created  catalog  and presents the file selection requester to you (or
you  can  ignore the catalog if you're doing a full restore).  You may
then easily select all, some or only one file to be recovered from the
backup set.  If you happen to select the last file on the last floppy,
you won't have to "wade through" scores of backup disks.  MRBackup Pro
will  simply  skip  the  backup  disks  on  which  no  files have been
selected.   MRBackup Pro will not overwrite files which are newer than
their backed-up versions unless you enable the "Force Copy" option.

MRBackup  Pro  also  sports  an ARexx port which allows you to control
just  about  every  aspect  of  its  operation  from  an ARexx script.
MRBackup  Professional  has the best ARexx implementation of any Amiga
backup  program  on  the  market today.  Using a public domain program
such  as  "dcron"  or  "AmiCron"  in  conjunction with the appropriate
script,  you  can  schedule automatic backups at intervals appropriate
for you.

This  should  give  you  a  useful overview of MRBackup Professional's
capabilities,  though there are many, many more features available and
new  features  are  being  regularly  added.  If you have any specific
questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
