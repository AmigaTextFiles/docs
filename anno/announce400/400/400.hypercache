TITLE

	HyperCache Professional Summary Utility  "Summary"

COMPANY

	Silicon Prairie Software

DESCRIPTION
 
	Summary is a utility provided in the distribution of the commercial 
	product HyperCache Professional.  It provided statistics and information
	on such matters as device geometry, cache hit ratio, etc.

	Versions of Summary up to 1.01B have a minor defect that prevents them
	find finding all active caches on certain systems.  This did not affect
	all users, but rather usually only those running HyperCache Pro on more
	than two device units on a single controller.

	The interim update, Summary 1.01C, is now available from Silicon Prairie
	Software.                                          

AVAILABILITY

	Summary 1.01C may be otained via email by sending a message including
	your registration number (ie: serial number from your distribution
	disk that will match the card your mailed in... you did mail it in?)
	and a short note requesting the update.  Send your email to the address
	listed above.

	To receive the update by postal mail, send $4.00 US funds to cover 
	shipping and handling to the address shown above.  Again, please
	include your serial number.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	Summary is part of a copyrighted commercial product and as such 
	Silicon Prairie retains all rights associated with it.  It is for use
	solely by registered owners of HyperCache Pro.  Unauthorised
	duplication or distribution is prohibited.  Although the original
	distribution version included on the disk is a serialized executable,
	this update will not be. (It is, of course, wholely useless without the
	actual HyperCache program).
