   ******************** ATTENTION DETROIT-AREA AMIGA OWNERS *******************

The Detroit Area Amiga User Group announces a raffle for a brand new copy of 
Soft Logik's PageStream 3.0.  The raffle will be held at the Farmington Hills
Library on 12 mile road between Orchard Lake and Farmington roads, just off
I-696 on Saturday, July 17 at 2:00 PM.  Tickets are $5, and are available
from DAAUG members, or by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to me
c/o DAAUG Raffle.  Please do not send cash by mail; send check or money
order, $5 per ticket, made out to the Detroit Area Amiga User Group.  You
will receive your tickets within 5 days of receipt of your order.  Or,
you may make arrangements to meet with one of our members to purchase the
tickets, or purchase tickets at the door.

Proceeds will go to DAAUG, a non-profit organization whose main goal is to
help market the Amiga in the U.S., and to push Commodore to be more aggres-
sive in its domestic marketing.

Please mail to me, Jay Imerman, President, DAAUG at the address below.
