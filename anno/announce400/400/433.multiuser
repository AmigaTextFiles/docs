SHORT

        Many users live in harmony on one system

DESCRIPTION

        You've got an Amiga with Kickstart 2.04 or higher and
        several people are regularly fooling around with it ... Last
        week your sister deleted your 20MB GIF collection by mistake
        and you don't want this to happen again ...  Well, here's
        the answer: MultiUser!

        MultiUser allows you to create a *IX-like environment where
        several users live together in harmony, unable to delete
        each others files, unable to read those private love-letters
        of other users ... And this even if several users are
        working on the machine at the same time (on a terminal
        hooked up to the serial port) ...

        You are the sole user of your computer? Well, make sure it
        stays that way by installing MultiUser! People without a
        valid login ID and password won't be able to access files
        you have made private with MultiUser. If you make all files
        private (not readable for others), the only useful thing
        they could do, is boot from a floppy ...

NEW FEATURES

        Owner change during execution, and a lot more...
