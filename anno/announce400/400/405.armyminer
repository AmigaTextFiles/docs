  Hello Dan,
           Ok, I added the correct paths for the game in
all the FTP sites where it can be found.

----- Corrected announce -----

  Description:

    ArmyMiner is a logic board game where some of the squares
do contain bombs. When clicked, the bomb-free squares display
the number of bombs in their neighbourhood. The objective of
the game is for the user to mark all the squares having bombs
in a minimum of time. The game requires good concentration
and offers a very interesting mental challenge.

    There are many instances of that game on different
platforms (Minesweeper on IBM-compatible, XMines on XWindows,
etc). ArmyMiner v1.0 integrates all of the good aspects I've
seen on all the versions of that game available on 
personal computers. Its options include:

  - Automatically mark or clean the neighbours of a square
  - Safe start (no explosion at first click)
  - Safe click (gadget-like behavior for squares)
  - Question marks (for configuration analysis)

  You can also specify your own custom board settings.
The game has a very useful pause option, sound effects,
high-score tables and a very nice interface. It works
on either OS v1.3 or 2.0, under NTSC or PAL.

  ArmyMiner v1.0 is public domain, binary only. You are free
to use it as long as you leave my copyright notice intact.
You can distribute that program as long as you don't ask any
more money for it than a nominal fee for copying, and if you
keep the "ArmyMiner.doc" file with it. If you want to include
this program in a commercial package, you need my written
permission.

  ArmyMiner v1.0 is currently available on the following
FTP sites:

  Switz.  amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80)  pub/aminet/game/think
  Scand.  ftp.luth.se           (130.240.18.3)  pub/aminet/game/think
  USA     ftp.etsu.edu          (192.43.199.20) pub/aminet/game/think
  USA     oes.orst.edu          (128.193.124.2) pub/aminet/game/think
 
  Have fun!
