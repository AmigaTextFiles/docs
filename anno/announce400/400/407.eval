DESCRIPTION

     A full-featured floating point expression evaluator, Eval
     evaluates expressions (C-like syntax) and instantly prints the 
     result.  Eval includes several built-in functions, many 
     predefined constants (scientific constants, conversion factors,
     etc.), and built-in documentation.  Just run the program.
     Number base conversion and bitwise operators are also included.
     Full ANSI C source is included.  Eval has been compiled on
     Amiga, Unix, VMS, MS-DOS, and Macintosh environments.  The
     source has no system dependent conditional compile directives.
     Instructions are included in the source so that you can easily
     customize Eval with your own functions and predefined constants
     by modifying and recompiling the source.
