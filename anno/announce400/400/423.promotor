DESCRIPTION

   The  Promotor is *THE*  screen promotion  utility  every AGA user  ever
wanted.  Amiga2xxx wasn't bad, ForceMonitor is nice and PKludge was rather
good, but  they all  lack the features the Promotor  has  to offer.  Well,
here's a list of what you can do ...

o Specify specific screens to be promoted using the following criteria:

  - Name of the task requesting the screen
  - In  case  the  screen  is  opened as a public screen, the name of that
    public screen.
  - The default title of the screen
  - The screen-mode requested for this screen.

  For this you can use any AmigaDOS wild-card pattern.

o Change  position  and  dimensions  of  the  screen even the depth can be
  changed.

o Change  the  screen-mode  to  use  for this screen.  Screen-modes can be
  entered  using  their  name  or  using  their hex ID (useful if the mode
  doesn't have a name).

o Change the overscan mode : standard, text, graphics or video overscan ?

o Change   the  number  of  Colourmap  entries,  whether  or  not  to  use
  auto-scroll,  whether  or  not  the  screen should have a full intuition
  palette,  should it be draggable, have exclusive rights for the display,
  have  shared  dripens,  should  it  look  like  the  workbench,  have an
  interleaved bitmap, use the old or new system-font.

o Change  the  dripens of the screen or use the Promotors default dripens.
  Specify whether 2.x or 3.x like dripens should be used.

   Any of  these changes  can be forced so that they will be used, even if
the  task  opening  the  screen requested other values  than  the ones you
specified.

   This is a full-functioning evaluation version of the Promotor.  It pops
up a requester to remind you to register, everytime you open a screen.


NEW FEATURES

   Version 1.01
   ------------

      Version 1.01 fixes  a bug  in the registration check.   Registered
   version would do  some strange things and  give  some enforcer  hits.
   Nobody  will have noticed  this,  since nobody subscribed yet.  Well,
   maybe noone knows this program exists  ... Better post an announce to
   comp.sys.amiga :-)

   Version 1.02
   ------------

      Version 1.02 fixes a bug in the font handling for the screen.  The
   previous versions didn't allow tasks  to specify their own font for a
   screen, due to a  bug in the handling  of the  SA_Font and SA_SysFont
   tags.  This bug should now be fixed.

      In addition I've added  SYSFONT  and  FORCESYSFONT options  so the
   user can dictate what  system font (the old topaz one  or  the one in
   the Preferences) should be used for the screen.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   The Promotor requires  kickstart 3.0 or  higher.   I don't think I'll
   bother programming around the bugs in ReadArgs of 2.x!

   The Promotor is most useful for people with  the AGA  chipset, to get
   rid of the interlace  screen, but  it could also  be  used  by  A3000
   owners  running 3.x  (developers  only  :-) who  want to  change  the
   screenmode of their  favourite application.  Pre  3.0 users  won't be
   able to use it though!

HOST NAME

FILE NAMES

   Promotor_1.02.lha, Promotor_1.02.readme

PRICE

      The  Promotor is shareware.   If  you  find the program useful, or
   need anything added, and want to  encourage  me, or just want  to get
   rid of the requester,  a donation is welcome.  As stated  in the  doc
   file, the shareware fee  is $20  US or an equivalent  amount in  some
   other currency my  bank will accept.  Don't worry to  much  about the
   exchange rate, if it's about $20 US, you'll get your registration.

      The money would go into a modem, so I could still contact the rest
   of  the  world  when my  account  disappears.   At the  moment,  only
   bureaucracy is delaying the closing down of it, so it may be possible
   tha emailing me won't work anymore.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

Shareware.  You may distribute it as much as you want, but you aren't
allowed to distribute anything but the archive as I presented it.  No
file may be removed nor added.  If you DO want to change something,
you will need approval from me first.
