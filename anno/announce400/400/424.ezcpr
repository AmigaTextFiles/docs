DESCRIPTION 

     This utility makes the SAS/C Debugger(CPR) easier to 
     use.  Why type in the names of all the variables you 
     want to trace in CPR when you can use EZcpr to extract 
     the variables from your source code.  EZcpr then shows 
     the list of all your variables and all you have to do 
     is select with the mouse the one(s) you want to trace.  
     EZcpr then writes out a CPR script which you can run 
     from CPR to automatically trace the variable(s) you 
     selected.
