DESCRIPTION

    This program can do both pagination and line numbering on files.

    PAGINATION

	The pagination involves breaking a text file up into pages of equal
	length, and optionally marking each page with a header,  a  footer,
	or both. The headers and footers may contain  the  page  number  in
	various formats, including both upper and lowercase roman numerals,
	as well as the time and date in  various  formats.  They  may  also
	include any other text you want to put in them.

	You may choose different headers  and  footers	for  odd  and  even
	pages, as well as for the first page. You may also choose  to  have
	no header or footer on the first page, on odd  pages,  or  on  even
	pages. And you may choose to have the same footer or header on	all
	pages.

	You may also choose to make the first page a title  page.  A  title
	page has no headers and footers on it. Also,  "Paginate"  does  not
	begin page numbering with a title page. And as far as  the  headers
	and footers for the first page are concerned, "Paginate"  does  not
	regard the title page as the first page. It  considers	it  as	the
	page prior to the first page.

    LINE NUMBERING

	The line numbering consists of printing  a  string  with  the  line
	number in it at the beginning of each  line.  You  may	choose	the
	format of the line number, and you may put other text in  the  line
	number string. The default is to do no line numbering.
