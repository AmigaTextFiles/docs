Hi Dan,

I made a small mistake that someone pointed out in my groff
announcement. Is it possible to do a follow-up announcement?
Here is what I would like to put in the follow-up...

DESCRIPTION

        In my original posting, I incorrectly identified grap (the Un*x 
        graph drawing pre-processor normally found with n/troff) as being 
        part of the groff-1.07 distribution.  It is not part of groff 
        (yet).  Thanks to jjc@jclark.com for pointing out my mistake.


What's your recomendation?
