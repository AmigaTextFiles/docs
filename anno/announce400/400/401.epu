TITLE:   EPU

VERSION: 1.4

AUTHOR: Jaroslav Mechacek

E-MAIL: jara@adelard.dcs.muni.cs
        (jara@lion.ics.muni.cs)

DESCRIPTION:

  EPU is Stacker-like program.

  After installing EPU to any device (HardDisk, Floppy, Rad: etc.), every
  file written to the device is compressed and 
  compressed file read by any application is automatically
  decompressed. 

  That means the EPU doubles your disk capacity!

  EPU is very easy to install or remove, its size is very small,
  and it works with many compression libraries like lh.library or
  xpk(NUKE,...).  

  The file sizes are not limited by memory,
  (maximum file size is about 1GB).

  There are no differences or limitations when you are working with
  EPU installed or without it (of course it can be slower if the CPU
  is slow.)

  More info is in epu.doc
  
NEW FEATURES:

 1. This version runs on ALL machines and with ALL OS 
    (The previous 1.0 version didn't work on A3000/A4000)-KS1.2 was not tested.

 2. Now EPU can work with xpk sublibraries like NUKE etc.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: None
    xpk????.library suggested.
