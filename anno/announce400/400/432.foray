DESCRIPTION

    When enthusiasts get together to collect, identify, and learn more about
    mushrooms it's called a "foray." With a keen interest in extending that
    feeling of fun and discovery, eye 2 eye design is pleased to announce
    "FORAY" ... a pictorial mushroom information and identification database
    for the Amiga.

    Even someone who has never picked a wild mushroom, and doesn't intend to,
    can enjoy FORAY as a pictorial information source. You can modify the
    included records, add new records, or create entire new databases. FORAY 
    is also designed to assist the serious mycologist, offering the matrix
    for an extensive multi-genus database. FORAY follows the same Group, then 
    Genus, then species naming convention found in mushroom books and field 
    guides.

    The present version of FORAY supports the four major mushroom Groups:
    Agarics, Boletes, Chanterelles, and Polypores. (Future upgrades will add
    more.) Records may be retrieved by Genus, Genus.species, common name, or
    by selecting feature keys and initializing a search. Features associated
    with any mushroom record may be changed, providing the opportunity to
    fine-tune an entry. Individualized comments and "field notes" may be saved
    with any record.

    Each mushroom entry can have a picture. The included pictures are a study
    of how the Amiga's basic 16 colors may be expanded to accurately reproduce
    the much wider palette of mushrooms in the wild. Using an Amiga paint
    program, you can create new pictures to add to the database.

    FORAY opens on its own hi-res screen on any Amiga with 2.0 or greater. It
    has its own proportional font, picture gadgets, and a beautiful, easy-to-use
    interface.

    All the pictures are original, created with DPaint... nothing was scanned.
    Please do not separate the pictures from the program.
