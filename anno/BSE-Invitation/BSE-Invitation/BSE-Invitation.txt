===============================================================================

1) Introduction
----------------

You might have already heard about the Belgian Scene Event last year.
If you did, you might also recall that the BSE 1997 was the first
Amiga-only party in Belgium since 1992! And guess what folks, this year
we're back with the BSE 1998 - Amiga only ofcourse!

After the successful experiment last year (to see whether it is possible
to organize an Amiga-event in god-forgotten Belgium) we have decided that
Amiga IS capable of attracting enough people and giving them a good time!
(For more information on BSE 1997, see the BSE 1997 chapter).

Furthermore, Mr. Darreck Lisle of Amiga Inc. will probably also be present
at the BSE party to answer any questions you might have. Ofcourse you can 
also have a nice chat with him ;).

So that's why we are inviting all Amiga-lovers out there to come and join
us at the BSE 1998 party, the cooooooooowlest Amiga-party in Belgium!

===============================================================================

2) Where
---------

This year we have decided to organize the party in a very easy to reach
location! (We admit that it was a bit difficult to find it last year ;).
The BSE 1998 will be held in Diepenbeek, near Hasselt. It is a small town
very close to all the surrounding countries of Belgium. Diepenbeek is
situated at about 40 kilometers of the Netherlands, 60km of Germany and
about 80 kilometers of France.

The partyplace will be the 'Ontmoetingscentrum Lutselus', which is directly
next to the two major highways from Belgium. Maybe an idiot like Bill Gates
would have some troubles finding it, so we are confident that you Amiga people
will find it very easily!

This is the adress:
        Ontmoetingscentrum Lutselus
        Pastorijstraat 7
        3590 Diepenbeek
        Belgium

Read the 'How To Get There' part for more info on... how to get there! :)

===============================================================================

3) When
--------

The BSE 1998 party will be held the 7th, 8th and 9th of August 1998. We
already know this clashes with the Assembly 1998 event, but are you going
to drive all the way up to Finland ? Not us :)

Partydoors will open Friday 12:00 noon and will close Sunday at noon too. This
means 48 hours of non-stop Amiga action, competitions, and entertainment!

===============================================================================

4) How to get there
--------------------

By car :
- - - - -

This is a real easy one. All you have to do is make sure that you get on either
the E313 or E314 (two major roads in Belgium). Depending on what country you're
from (or pass), you will either get on the E313 (France) or E314 (Netherlands,
Germany).

If you are coming from the E313 get off at exit 30 (Diepenbeek), take direction
Genk (LEFT when you are coming from Antwerp, RIGHT if you're coming from
Luik/Liege/Luttich) when you exit the highway, at the 2nd trafic lights there
should be a (modern architecture) church on your right and a big open place on
your left. Turn right there and the partyplace is right in front of you.
(There's a huge plaque saying "Ontmoetingscentrum Lutselus" in front of it, so
you really can't miss it).

From the E314 get off at exit 31 and drive to Genk, go straight ahead all the
time until you drive over the "Albertkanaal" (big pile of water you can't miss).
Then at the second traffic lights take left. The church mentioned above should be
on your left when arriving at the lights, the open place to your right.

Ofcourse we will put up huge, visible everywhere. We made a deal with the local
Police station so that they won't remove the signs.

By Train :
- - - - - -

There are 2 stations where you can get off, both are on the same line
(Knokke-Blankenberge / Luik-Maastricht), namely Hasselt and Genk. In Hasselt
you can take a bus (see below). If you decide to go to Genk, you can use our
Train-Shuttle (read below). If you are coming from Antwerpen or Luik/Liege
there is a train riding between the 2 cities which also stops in Hasselt.
Do NOT get off in Diepenbeek (the train stops there too), it will have you
end up at the complete wrong side of Diepenbeek and you will have to walk
A LOT to get to the party-place (if your sadistic enough to carry around 20kgs
of computer equipment for 10km, then this might be the stop for you ;).

By Bus :
- - - - -

From Hasselt trainstation, you can take the bus in the direction of the
party-place. There is bus nr 36, direction Genk. It departs right in front
of the Railway station's main building (there's a bus every hour). 
Get off at "Lutselus Kerk". Just before the stop you will pass a big 
open space and quite a big road and the party-place on your right, but you 
will have to ring VERY URGENTLY when you pass the party-place since the 
stop is right in front of it :).

However : it is unlikely that this bus wil ride on sunday, so try to
use our Train-shuttle between Genk station and the party place as much as
possible. If you want more bus information, you can check the regional office
of De Lijn.

Here are the time tables for the bus from Hasselt to the partyplace:
These shedules are ONLY valid on FRIDAYS. If you plan to come over on
Saturday, then you're strongly advised to use our Train Shuttle service.

All bustickets cost about 80 BFR towards the Partyplace.

Train Shuttle :
- - - - - - - - -

If you are coming by train and have some stuff with you that you dont like to
take on a (bumpy) bus-ride, we offer a train-shuttle between the trainstation
of Genk and the partyplace. If you want to use this shuttle-service we DO ask
you to inform us in advance when you will we ariving at the trainstation!!
When you inform us in advance, we will give you a cellular (GSM) phonenumber
to call when you arrived at the trainstation or have missed your train so
that we don't end up waiting for nothing in Genk. A small (symbolic) fee
will be asked for the trip (the gas in fact). If you plan on using this
service, please let us know. Thanks.

By Plane :
- - - - - -

Fly into Zaventem /Brussels (code BRU) and there take a train (omnibus towards
Brussels rides about every 15-20 minutes, the trainstation in the airport is
not hard to find btw.). Look above for the train stuff or if you should continue
by car get on the E40 in direction Luik-Liege and in Leuven get on the A2
(E313/E314) direction Aachen and then look on the maps you can find above.

===============================================================================

5) Facilities
--------------

* The partyplace can accommodate over 300 people, has powerful PA equipment. We
  will also have a high-quality videobeamer (and it won't blow up ;) that will
  provide the online party-news, competitions, and entertainment for 48 hours.

* 200 Amps (in total about 80000 Watt) of high-quality, clean and secure power.

* Loads of people seemed to enjoy last year's bar, so we are going to have a
  fully equiped bar again this year where you will be able to buy Real Belgian
  Beers and real Belgian food! This all will be at very cheap prices, you will
  get 1 consumption for 40 BEF (= about 2 DM / 2 HFL / 1 USD / 6,5 FFR).
  Ofcourse we will also sell a wide variety of sandwiches, snacks. We know the
  food and drinks are a bit more expensive than first announced (well, 7 BEF)
  but this is because the drinks are more expensive in this partyplace then we
  first expected. It is still cheap though :)

  This proves once more that we are not interested in the money! Everything that
  rests after the expenses are paid of will go directly to the competitions!

* There are dozens of places you can eat nearby, there are sandwichbars (a la
  MacDonalds), backeries, grocery stores so you won't have any problems
  getting those hot meals!

* There is a quiet sleeping area reserved where you can do those bits of
  sleeping everyone needs now and then ;).

Things we won't have:

* A party-network: Who needs a network anyhow ? PC-gamers playing
  Quake II ultra-mmx-accelerated versions ? Young kids trading pornography ?
  We Amigians don't need any of that. If we want to trade we do it the real
  way: swapping disks, harddisks and parnet! Ofcourse you are free to setup
  a local parnet/sernet/... network of your own!

* Nasty PC users consuming all the bloody power!

===============================================================================

6) Reservations
----------------

You can make your reservations by either sending an email to:

                             bse98@gmx.net

Just include your NAME/HANDLE/EMAIL and the number of seats you want
to reserve.

Ofcourse you can also reserve your seats online at the BSE 1998 homepage:

    http://uc2.unicall.be/crisp    or    http://bse.base.org

Or if you don't have the internet, try:

PO Box 25
3000 Leuven 3

We will not accept payments in advance. If you reserve your seats you
will get them. The best seats will go first ofcourse.

We strongly ask you to reserve your seats in advance so we have a good
estimate of the people that will attend the BSE 1998. That way we can
make sure there are enough seats for everyone and that everyone has a
decent view!

===============================================================================

and even whole computer systems (last year there was a complete A1200HD Magic
Pack!)

===============================================================================

8) Party Rules
----------------

* You are on Belgian soil, so the Belgian laws apply inside & outside the
  party-hall. Some fragments of the Belgian Law:
  - Thou shall not copy illegal software.
  - Thou shall not smoke weed.
  - Thou shall not fraud with the public telephone system.

* The party-organizers have the right to refuse anybody at anytime for any
  reason to connect their whole, or a piece of their equipment.

* Intoxicated (read: drunk, stoned) people and troublemakers will be thrown out.

* If you damage something, you will pay for it yourself. No money ? No problem,
  we'll call your parents.

===============================================================================

9) Useful informations
-----------------------

* Entrance fee is will be 500 BEF (25 DM/ 25 HFL / 16 USD / 85 FFR).

* The party organisers will be at the partyplace starting from Thursday (6th)
  evening. Please note that we can only guarantee that everything will be up
  and working Friday 7th at noon! So if you arrive too early, you might not
  immediatelly have power.

* Mr. Darreck Lisle of Amiga Inc. (Events Co-ordinator) will probably also be 
  present to answer any questions you have concerning the future of the Amiga.

===============================================================================

10) The BSE 1997
----------------

As we already mentioned, last year's BSE was some sort of an experiment, to
verify if enough people were interested in visiting Belgium. We were pleasantly
suprised by the number of visitors: 32 visitors in total! Considering that it
was the first edition, that was not that bad at all! (The average start of a
party is 20 visitors, so we had about 60% more :).

As for the organising last year: we actually organised the whole thing with
a telephonebook & some friends in 3 hours and it turned out rather good :).
This year we are spending 8 months to organize, so it can only get way better!

Ofcourse some mistakes were made last year, and we also learned from them!
Therefor the BSE 1998 will be completely different with:
 - more staff ('coz we really lacked that last year)
 - better equiped bar with more drinks/snacks
 - more entertainment (how about a 4hour videocassette of all those classic
   demos ?)
 - more fun competitions
 - and especially ... more Amiga people to talk to!

So if you don't want the Amiga 40kb intro competition to be announced
on a bloody 233Mhz Pentium PisswCee running a buggy PC Scala, if you don't
want organizers asking how they have to start an Amiga program, then be sure
to visit the BSE 1998! :)
