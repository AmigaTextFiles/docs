Thank you for inquiring about our VertiSketch 3D digitizing system.

Included on this diskette are some sample models created with VertiSketch.

Feel free to load and render these objects in LightWave 3D. These
examples show the ability of VertiSketch to reproduce complex surfaces
that would be extremely time consuming, if not impossible, to create
in Modeler alone.

Bookend.lw and Hand.lw were created with the Polhemus IsotrakII
interfaced with LightWave Modeler through the VertiSketch software.
Similarly, Femur.lw used the Science Accessories Corp. GP-12XL
hardware with VertiSketch.

VertiSketch_objects.ham is a picture of the above objects rendered in
LightWave. You may load this into ToasterPaint or any other program
capable of reading Amiga iff images.

VertiSketch.readme lists information about the different VertiSketch
models that are available, as well as how you can reach us should you
have questions about VertiSketch or wish to place an order.
