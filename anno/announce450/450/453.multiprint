To Dan Zerkle,
  please post this on the Comp.Sys.Amiga.Announce news group.

Hopefully, this will be the last version for a loooonnnngggg time,
but it fixes a bug which caused problems for just about everyone in
2.00, so please post it.
Unless serious bugs are found in this version, new versions (if there
are any) will be released quietly.
Let me know if you have any problems with it.

DESCRIPTION

     MultiPrint is a program initially designed to print
     document files, and other text files, to as few sheets
     of paper as possible. It has since had other features
     such as bold/italic/font support, Compugraphic support,
     paragraph reformating and full justification added
     for improved flexability and readability.
     
     MultiPrint prints text files to multiple columns, on
     both sides of the sheet automatically, with no need
     to shuffle the pages.
     
     Pages are printed with a footer, with margins, page
     numbers, and with a gutter to allow easy stapling,
     or hole punching.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 2.01 fixes a few bugs that were found in the last
     released version, and adds a few significant features.


2.01 June 9, 1993
    Bugs Fixed :
      1. Major bug : Output to multi-pin printers was broken, and
         now works correctly. Should now work with printers such as
         Canon bubble jets.
      2. Aborting printing could leave the printer in a state where
         another print would fail, and the program would just sit there.
    Added Features :
      1. Force Bold option added, for printers that can't print thin fonts
         well. Forces all body-text into bold.
      2. PercentPage option added.
         This option is designed for people with laser printer without
         enough memory to print a full page.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     MultiPrint requires 2.04 or higher.
     
     MultiPrint works best with page oriented printers, such
     as lasers and HP deskjets. A fast printer helps.

     MultiPrint provides better output with the use of
     Scalable fonts, and better italics/bold if you have a
     complete family (or more) of Scalable fonts.


HOST NAME

     This version can be found as MultiPrint201.lha on
     amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80), where I uploaded
     it in the new directory.
     
     You could also try wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).
     
     In New Zealand, you can try kauri.vuw.ac.nz.


DIRECTORY

     Should end up in /pub/aminet/text/print, where the last
     version was put.

FILE NAMES

     MultiPrint201.lha, MultiPrint201.readme

PRICE

     MultiPrint is shareware, basically. If you find the
     program useful, or need anything added, and want to
     encourage me, a donation is welcome, but not
     essential.
     
     I would like to make enough money from MultiPrint to
     replace the Ink Cartridge I used most of in testing
     MultiPrint.
     
     Suggestion, US$20 or equivalent, NZ$ if you can get them.
     Any amount is fine though.
     
     Hey, here's ambition ... maybe I could make enough
     to buy a laser printer! :-)


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     Shareware. Distribute to whoever, but if you plan
     to include it in a magazine's cover disk, or anything
     like that - let me know first.
     
     No matter what, leave the documentation intact.
