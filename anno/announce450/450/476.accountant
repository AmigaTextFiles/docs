DESCRIPTION

	The Home Accountant allows one to keep track of any type of
	account one may use in the home.  This includes checking,
	savings, mutual funds, and more.  Along with it's record keeping
	features, one may use it to budget any revenue/expenses which
	flow through an account.  One may also group accounts into 
	what is called a transaction base to compute net worth and 
	obtain batch printings.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	The Home Accountant was developed on an Amiga 500 (ECS) with
	1 meg RAM.  It requires the mathtrans.library included with
	AmigaDOS. 

	It is unknown whether The Home Accountant will work with AGA
	machines.  Feedback is appreciated in this area as I want to
	rectify this if it doesn't.
