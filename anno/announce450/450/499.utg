DESCRIPTION

	UTG is a graphical adventure game similar to 'Legend of Lothian'
or Ultima IV.  Set in a typical medieval arrangement, the player assumes
the role of a serf who must locate the vanished kind and restore order
to the land.  In order to locate the king, the player must move about the
country visiting various towns, talking to their inhabitants.  Gold must
be harvested from slain monsters to fund such worthy causes as food and
armor.
	I was inspired to write UTG after enjoying 'Legend of Lothian'
and being mysteriously unable to run the ill-behaved Ultima IV on my 
system.
