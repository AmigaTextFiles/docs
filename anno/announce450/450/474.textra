DESCRIPTION

     Textra is the User-Friendly text editor for the Amiga.
     It contains a fully-Intuitionized GUI as well as an
     ARexx interface with 50+ commands.  The package
     interfaces with the WB2.0+ asl font requester,
     supports multiple windows with cut, copy and paste
     between them.  Undo and Drag-select with left mouse
     button, background printing and ARexx script exec-
     ution, user-settable preferences which can be saved,
     all supported.  The editor displays fast text and
     continuous-movement vertical and horizontal scroll bars.

     The package contains full, detailed documentation,
     30+ Arexx scripts (including an interactive tutorial)
     and a hard disk installer program.

     Scripts are provided to integrate Textra with
     JForth Professional 3.x, HSPascal and Paul Kienitz's
     Q-Blue Offline Mail Reader program.

NEW FEATURES

     Textra 1.14 sports a status line indicating current
     cursor position or select range location.  The ARexx
     requester is improved, allowing 10 strings, utilizes
     additional function keys for single-key launching.
     All alphabetic keys, as well as the HELP key, are now
     user-configurable; each may be bound to any Textra script
     or internal Textra command via the CTRL key.  Double-
     clicking any ( ) < > [ ] { } character locates the
     balancing character (forward searches conducted for
     balancing double-quote characters).  User-definable
     startup ARexx script is checked for at launch.
     Increased system fault checking.  More menu key
     equivalents.  New ARexx commands & scripts.
     Bug fixes.
