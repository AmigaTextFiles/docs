Fair enough. See below.

Yeah, fair enough I guess. I had considered that, but despite the fact that
it's mathematically incorrect, it's descriptive I think. Anyway, I've changed
it in what follows.

TITLE

	ACE  -  Amiga BASIC Compiler with Extras. 

VERSION

	v1.1a        

COMPANY

	Private developer.

DESCRIPTION

ACE is a PD Amiga BASIC compiler which, in conjunction with A68K and Blink
produces standalone executables. No special run-time shared libraries are 
required.
 
The language is a large subset of AmigaBASIC but also has many extra features
not found in the latter such as: turtle graphics, recursion, SUBs with return
values, structures, arguments, include files, a better WAVE command which 
allows for large waveforms, external references, named constants and several
extra functions.

In total, ACE currently supports some 150 commands and functions. 

ACE is still under development, but is quite usable in its present form.

NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

New features since v1.02 include CHDIR, FILES, SLEEP, SWAP and ALLOC. The 
latter is a hassle-free memory allocator. ACE automatically frees all 
memory allocated via ALLOC even if a program aborts due to an error or after 
a user break (ctrl-c).

An ADDRESS data type has been added, ARG$(0) now returns the executable's name,
string arrays can have element size specified and inline assembly code is now
supported. The OPTION command allows compiler directives to be set/reset    
in a program. 

Bug fixes involved CLOSE, CLS, BIN$, OCT$ and some string functions. The 
latter were overwriting a shared buffer in some cases. 

See docs/history and readme.first in the ACE archive for details on these
and other changes. 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	ACE has been tested on machines ranging from an A1000 running Wb 1.3
	with 512K of RAM to a 68030 machine running Wb 3.0 with 5M of RAM. 	

	For moderately large programs to compile however, 1M is required.

	I run ACE on an unaccelerated A500 with 3M of RAM and a 52M 
	hard drive under Wb 2.04.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	The ACE archive may be freely distributed, but no source code
	is currently included. Even when the sources are included, I
	will retain the copyright to them.
