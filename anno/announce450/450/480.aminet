Good policy, I hadn't kept a copy.


Quite a few things about Aminet have changed recently. We lost the sites
amiga.physik.unizh.ch and oes.orst.edu. But new services have been added
in exchange:

- There is a weekly and a daily mailing list of new files on Aminet.
  You can subscribe to them by sending a mail with
    subscribe aminet-weekly
  in its body (or aminet-daily for daily updates) to the address
  listserv@wunet.wustl.edu .

- You can now download Aminet files through FSP at the address
  ftp.luth.se with port number 6969 and at src.doc.ic.ac.uk with
  port number 21.

- There's a new gopher server for Aminet at src.doc.ic.ac.uk

- And you can download through telnet (using ZMODEM or kermit) at
  146.169.2.1

- The Walnut Creek CD-ROM is out and can be ordered. You can have a 
  look at its file structure at ftp.etsu.edu in /aminet_cd

Please read pub/aminet/README on any Aminet site for more details.


As for uploading, the following things have changed:

- Uploads should now go to wuarchive.wust.edu since its the new main
  site of Aminet. If you can't get in use ftp.luth.se or ftp.uni-kl.de

- It is now highly recommended to add Uploader: fields to your 
  .readme files since we can't find out uploaders of corrupt files easily
  anymore.

- Also, from now on, uploading to Aminet means agreement with the 
  distribution of same files on CD-ROM. Please include Author: fields
  with your files (including modules!) to be sure they don't get 
  deleted from CD distributions. Having a file on the ROM means you
  get a free copy.

Please read the updated README.BEFORE.UPLOAD carefully before putting
anything on Aminet. Thank you.
