TITLE

   Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI).

VERSION

   Version 7.0

AUTHOR

   Richard Horne (RHorne@cup.portal.com).  Comments or questions welcome.

DESCRIPTION

   This is the final version (7.0) of Voice Command Line Interface (VCLI)
   which will execute CLI commands, ARexx commands, or ARexx scripts by
   voice command.  VCLI allows you to launch multiple applications or
   control any program with an ARexx capability entirely by spoken voice
   command.  VCLI is multitasking and will run in the background, listening
   for your voice command even while other programs may be running.

NEW FEATURES

   Many improvements requested by users have now been incorporated.  VCLI
   now has its own ARexx port so that its internal functions and options
   can be controlled by ARexx command.  Menu operations have been improved.
   Documentation is provided in AmigaGuide format.  This is the fastest
   version of VCLI yet, and it fully supports DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3, Sound
   Magic (Sound Master), and Generic audio digitizers.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   VCLI 7.0 requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher.  An audio digitizer is also
   required (DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic or a generic digitizer).

HOST NAME

   VCLI 7.0 is available via FTP at all Aminet sites.

DIRECTORY/FILE NAME

   VCLI 7.0 is located at pub/aminet/util/misc as VCLI70.lha.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

   VCLI 7.0 is free public domain software.
