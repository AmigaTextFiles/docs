TITLE

	AlertPatch - replacement patch for exec.library/Alert()

VERSION

	Distribution version 2.16

AUTHORS

	David Swasbrook

	E-mail address: dswa1@cs.aukuni.ac.nz (expires 01-Jan-94)


DESCRIPTION

	AlertPatch replaces the system exec.library/Alert() with
	two custom routines to give the user a choice of how the
	alert is to be displayed, either as an intuition window or
	a system alert with additional information.

FEATURES	

	1. Alerts now displayable as windows. With options to
	   Continue, Suspend or Reboot for all alert types.

	2. Displays description of alert and name of the offending
	   task.

	3. Dumps contents of CPU data and address registers and
	   displays a text representation.

	4. Can list or get information on alert numbers from cli or
	   listview.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	OS release 2.04 or newer is required.

	"matrix.library" version 23.390 required. (included in archive)

	Hypertext compatable document. (ie. MultiView/AmigaGuide)

	Distribution is archived with lha so program to
	un-archive them is needed. 

HOST NAME

	Software has been uploaded to the Aminet Site:

        ftp.luth.se              130.240.18.2    pub/aminet/

	and will be readily available on other Aminet sites.

	NB: All attempts to connect to Wuarchive from my site
            failed, whereas luth had no problems :(
