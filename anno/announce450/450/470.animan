TITLE

   AniMan Voice Recognition.

VERSION

   Version 5.2

AUTHOR

   Richard Horne (RHorne@cup.portal.com).  Comments or questions welcome.

DESCRIPTION

   This is the final version (5.2) of AniMan, the voice recognition program
   that allows you to converse with an animated talking head to execute any
   ARexx or CLI command.  AniMan appears as a full color animation in a
   miniature window on the 3.0 Workbench screen.  AniMan will respond to
   your spoken voice commands or will bother you with witty quips if not
   satisfied with your performance.  AniMan will also recite poetry if you
   ask nicely.  AniMan is multitasking and runs in the foreground or
   background, listening for your voice commands even while other programs
   may be running.

NEW FEATURES

   This final version of AniMan incorporates improvements requested by many
   users.  Full advantage is taken of AGA animation capabilities.  Menu
   operations have been improved.  Documentation is provided in AmigaGuide
   format.  Audio digitizers supported now include DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3,
   Sound Magic (Sound Master), and Generic audio digitizers.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   required (DSS 8, Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic or a generic digitizer).
