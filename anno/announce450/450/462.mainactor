DESCRIPTION

  MainActor is a modular animation package.

  It allows you to create,edit,play animations of the provided
  animation formats.

  You can convert any format into any other, allowing you to
  convert for example a range of pictures into an animation format
  of your choice, or resave the frames of an animation to an
  picture format, or simply to convert different picture formats.
  
  The following modules are included in this release:
  
  Animation Loader        Max. Depth         Animation Saver
  ----------------        ----------         ---------------
  Universal
  Universal_PicassoII
  IFF-Anim5                  8 Bit           IFF-Anim5
  IFF-Anim7_16               8 Bit           IFF-Anim7_16
  IFF-Anim7_32               8 Bit           IFF-Anim7_32

  PCX                        8 Bit
                                             ICON

  New features of Version 1.1
  
  -You can now map your arexx scripts to the function keys.

  -New IFF-Anim8_32, IFF-Anim8_16, PCX modules.

  -The new Universal modules allow you to easily load all of the supported
   graphic formats.
   The Universal_Picasso-II modules remap the output of all modules
   directly to the Picasso-II graphics board from Village Tronic.
   
  -MainActor has now an powerful external player named 'MainView', it
   can view all animations/pictures for which MainActor has the proper
   loader module.
   It is executeable from the wb or cli and supports, per tooltypes or
   cli arguments, all of MainActors view options.

  -MainActor now (optionally) saves icons for your newly created animations
   or pictures, enabling you to view the animations/pictures by selecting 
   their icons. These icons support the same tooltypes as MainView.

  -You can now control how many times MainActor/MainView plays
   animations.
   
  -The new 'Flash' option allows you to profile your animations.

  General Features:
  
  -Intelligent caching/tracking, MainActor can cache your animations and
   picture lists, if you have not enough memory it will directly access
   your data from any device. This makes it for example possible to
   create/edit/play a 400MB animation on your 2MB Amiga.

  -If you run OS 3.0 or higher, you will get an extra speed bonus on
   animations through the use of the new graphics routines.
   For OS2.0/2.1 users there are specific routines in the modules, which
   will give them the best playback speed possible on their system
   (and my knowledge :)).

  -Under OS 3.0 you will get the extra features of showing pictures or
   playing animations in a scrollable, resizable window on your MainActor
   or Workbench screen. The colors will be properly adjusted to your screen
   attributes.

  -MainActor has an arexx port, nearly all functions can be accessed through
   it. You can for example scale or dither whole animations through
   the use of an image processor, scripts are included.
