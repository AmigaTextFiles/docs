DESCRIPTION

     KCommodity is a multifunctional commodity like Mach IV or
     AutoCli and so forth. It comes with several new features
     not seen in other programs of that kind. Furthermore
     the "standard" features of such an utility are included like
     mouse acceleration, window activation, closing windows
     via hotkey and many, many more. It incorporates the features
     of several smaller tools in one whole with a "User Interface
     Style Guide" compliant GUI in order to let the user have a
     simple control panel for all the functions.

NEW FEATURES

     New since version 2.5 (only bug fixes, mainly) :

     - JobManager <-> KCommodity bug removed. When running JM, one couldn`t
       launch another KCX program while one was active, due to some
       misbehaviour of JM.

     - DOS call from within patched intuition routine secured, so that no
       task may call DOS.

     - "Print Aspect" settings won`t be ignored anymore

     and some minor fixes...

     Only OS 2.x and up
