ConFusion XX is celebrating 20 years, and will be held January 21-
23 at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 8000 Merriman Road, Romulus, MI
(off I-94 and Merriman near Detroit Metro Airport).  Membership to
the convention is $18 until 10/1/93, $22 until 12/31/93 and $25
thereafter, but this membership fee is waived if you pledge equipment
and/or your efforts to help out.

This year's Con features an Amiga Room and Seminars, Computer Room,
Seminars and Work Shops, Art Show and Auction, Masquerade Ball, Banquet,
Gaming and much more.

ConFusion has had an Amiga Room for 4 years now, and in the past has
conducted seminars on such topics as the Video Toaster, Freely-Dist-
ributable Software, Digging Into DOS (AmigaDOS), and many others.  If
you are willing to set up your equipment in the Amiga Room, please be
assured that security is good, and we have a perfect record of no lost
or damaged merchandise.  If you just want to help out, we need gophers
to help with various logistical aspects of organizing the Con.
