  Hello Dan,
           I've just finished (1 hour ago!) the new version of
ArmyMiner. This one has a nice UNDO option and board display is
a last faster. That plus a few fixes.

  You would be very kind to post the announce for that new
version. Here it is:

----- ArmyMiner v1.3 Release Announce -----
  
TITLE
        ArmyMiner

VERSION
        1.3

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

    ArmyMiner is a logic board game where some of the squares do contain
bombs. When clicked, the bomb-free squares display the number of bombs in
their neighbourhood. The objective of the game is for the user to mark all
the squares having bombs in a minimum of time. The game requires good
concentration and offers a very interesting mental challenge.

    There are many instances of that game on different platforms
(Minesweeper on IBM-compatible, XMines on XWindows, etc). ArmyMiner does
integrate all of the good aspects I've seen on all the versions of that game
available on personal computers.

FEATURES

  In addition to the conventional XMines-type features, it has:

  - Automatically mark or clean the neighbours of a square
  - Safe start (no explosion at first click)
  - Safe click (gadget-like behavior for squares)
  - Question marks (for configuration analysis)
  - A PAUSE option
  - An UNDO option that lets you restart a game after an explosion

  You can also specify your own custom board settings. The game has sound
effects, high-score tables and a very nice interface. It works on either
OS v1.3 or 2.0, under NTSC or PAL.

CHANGES

  The new features since v1.2 are:

  - Addition of the UNDO option

  - The displayed values when moving the CUSTOM requester sliders were not
    properly updated are that has now been fixed.

  - When you opened the CUSTOM requester while a game was in progress, the
    timer kept on incrementing. This has also been fixed.

  - Initial board display speed and other board refreshes have been greatly
    improved.

  - The default dimensions for the EXPERT board have been changed from
    25 by 25 to 30 by 25 (maximal size) which offers an even greater
    challenge.
