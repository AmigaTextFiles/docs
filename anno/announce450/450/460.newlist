I tried looking for your rules file on c.s.a.announce, but evidently our
news machine only keeps old news 2 weeks.  Instead of posting directly,
I figured that I'd mail it to you as you would know where this file should
go.
 
I replaced all the things you told me too.  Here is the file:

TITLE

     NewList

VERSION

     8.0  

     This is an update to version 7.1a released on the
     25th of December 1992.

DESCRIPTION

     Newlist is my attempt at the ultimate 'list' and 'ls'
     replacement.  Not only is Newlist very fast, very configurable, and
     and very powerful, but it has some unique features that makes 
     Newlist a must for Amiga owners.

     Newlist is very fast.  Currently, with certain flags
     set, it is the fastest shell printing directory lister
     available by seconds!

     Newlist allows almost complete configurability from
     custom header, print, and date formatting, to default
     ENV: settings, to complete internal string localization and
     editing.  Currently newlist runs in 10 languages including
     Danish, Dutch, Elite, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian,
     Polish, and Swedish.

     Newlist can be emulated to run like Commodore's list, ls, LSjr, ddir,
     and many other listers.  These aliases are included in the package.

     Newlist has complete WB2.0 compatibility incuding assign adds, 
       links (soft and hard), and many other nice things.

     Newlist also contains some amazing new features that will revolutionize
     the way one uses 'ls'.  See below.


NEW FEATURES

     Version 8 was made to add full WB3.0/3.1 compatibility and power features 
     including:
            -networking extensions
            -datatype support
            -numeric localization
            -multiuser filesystem 1.3 (mufs)
            -Commodore's Envoy filesystem
            -user definable styles for names and datatypes just like color-ls
            -an expert mode
            -and a turbo mode that speeds up shell printing by 30%!

     Besides these major new features, the usual bug fixes and minor
     enhancements have been applied all over the place.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Newlist requires 2.04 or higher.  
     For use of all features offered by Newlist, 3.0 is recommended.
