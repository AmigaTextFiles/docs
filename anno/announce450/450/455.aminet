The FTP site at amiga.physik.unizh.ch is no longer available for download
access and will soon disappear completely. The reason for this is the excessive
amount of bandwidth the site used (we *told* you to use the mirrors). Aminet
will probably survive, although we haven't found a suitable replacement for
our site yet. Uploads should go to ftp.luth.se for now, but this site is *not*
going to be the new Aminet center. Whatever comes, don't expect full 
functionality from Aminet within the next one or two weeks.

PS: Do *not* try to log in. We've already had 13'000 attempted logins today,
    which shows how many people tried to force their way into amiga.physik
    using scripts.
