TITLE

     MultiUser

RELEASE

     1.4

SHORT

     A protection system for several users

DESCRIPTION

       You've got an Amiga with Kickstart 2.04 or higher and several
     people are regularly fooling around with it ...  Last week your
     sister deleted your 20MB JPEG collection by mistake and you don't
     want this to happen again ...  Well, here's the answer:
     MultiUser!

       MultiUser allows you to create a *IX-like environment where
     several users live together in harmony, unable to delete each
     others files, unable to read those private love-letters of other
     users ...  And this even if several users are working on the
     machine at the same time (on a terminal hooked up to the serial
     port) ...

       You are the sole user of your computer?  Well, make sure it
     stays that way by installing MultiUser!  People without a valid
     login ID and password won't be able to access files you have made
     private with MultiUser.  If you make all files private (not
     readable for others), the only useful thing they could do, is
     boot from a floppy ...

       And ...  you do not have to reformat your hard drive!
