  Hello Dan,
           I would like to post a final announce for ArmyMiner.
This is version 1.4, and that version fixes everything that
caused a problem in previous ones.

  I hope this is not too much trouble for you (at least not as
much as it was to program the game! :) ).

  Thanks!

  Here's the announce...

TITLE
        ArmyMiner

VERSION
        1.4

DESCRIPTION

    ArmyMiner is a logic board game where some of the squares do contain
bombs. When clicked, the bomb-free squares display the number of bombs in
their neighbourhood. The objective of the game is for the user to mark all
the squares having bombs in a minimum of time. The game requires good
concentration and offers a very interesting mental challenge.

    There are many instances of that game on different platforms
(Minesweeper on IBM-compatible, XMines on XWindows, etc). ArmyMiner does
integrate all of the good aspects I've seen on all the versions of that game
available on personal computers.

FEATURES

  In addition to the conventional XMines-type features, it has:

  - Automatically mark or clean the neighbours of a square
  - Safe start (no explosion at first click)
  - Safe click (gadget-like behavior for squares)
  - Question marks (for configuration analysis)
  - A PAUSE option
  - An UNDO option that lets you restart a game after an explosion

  You can also specify your own custom board settings. The game has sound
effects, high-score tables and a very nice interface. It works on either
OS v1.3 or 2.0, under NTSC or PAL.

CHANGES

  The new features in v1.4 are:

  - The PAUSE button is now available after an UNDO

  - All bugs of version 1.3 are fixed (e.g. UNDO with question marks).

  - System fonts other than "topaz 8" are not causing a problem anymore with
    the CUSTOM board requester
