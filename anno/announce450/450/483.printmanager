TITLE

        PrintManager - printer spooler

VERSION

        2.0

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

        PrintManager is a printer spooler. Data sent to the printer is
        cached on a disk file so that the printing program is able to
        resume interactive operations.
        The program is a system wedge, so it will work with *any* program,
        not just ones explicitly written to take advantage of it.
        PrintManager has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which allows
        the user to view the list of queued print jobs and perform some
        operations like pause, remove, sort, save.
        After a system crash or reset, unfinished printings are
        automatically recovered.
        An AppIcon is available on request where the user may drag icons
        to print files. Under Kickstart 3.0, datatypes.library is used
        to allow printing of any document which may be displayed by
        MultiView.
        Under Workbench 2.1 or later, localization is supported (currently
        only italian and german catalogs included).

NEW FEATURES

        It's now possible to spool PAR: and SER:, via the DEVICE ToolType.
        "How can I make PrintManager work with PageStream?" is a question
        I will hopefully not have to answer any more. ;-)

        Auto Form Feed feature
