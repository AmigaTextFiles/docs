TITLE

     BigAnim

VERSION

     3.3 (23-Jul-93)

AUTHOR

     Christer Sundin, d8sunch@dtek.chalmers.se

DESCRIPTION

     BigAnim is an animation player, capable of "direct from disk"
     playback, with user selectable buffer size and playback speed.
     BigAnim can display IFF ANIM animations of types 5 and 7, and
     makes use of the new graphics.library double-buffering routines
     when run on an Amiga with Kickstart 3.0 or later.

NEW FEATURES

     These are a few of the new features that have been added since
     version 2.0:

     o Several new options, including options to set buffer size and
       playback speed

     o Uses the new V39 graphics.library functions for colour loading
       and double-buffering when available

     o On pre-V39 systems, a display mechanism based on copper interrupts
       is used (to avoid a bug in the WaitBOVP() function)

     o New decompression routines, optimised for 68020+ processors
       have been added

REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 2.04 or higher. BigAnim will take advantage of Kickstart 3.0
     and 68020+ processors if found.
