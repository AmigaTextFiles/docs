DESCRIPTION

	AlertPatch replaces the system exec.library/Alert() with
	two custom routines to give the user a choice of how the
	alert is to be displayed, either as an intuition window or
	a system alert with additional information.

FEATURES	

	1. Alerts now displayable as windows. With options to
	   Continue, Suspend or Reboot for all alert types.

	2. Displays description of alert and name of the offending
	   task.

	3. Dumps contents of CPU data and address registers and
	   displays a text representation.

	4. Can list or get information on alert numbers from cli or
	   listview.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	OS release 2.04 or newer is required.

	"matrix.library" version 23.410 required. (included in archive)

	Hypertext compatable document. (ie. MultiView/AmigaGuide)

	un-archive them is needed.

	which due to an oversight asked for V39 of the Utility

	correctly. Apologies to all people who were inconvenienced
	and thanks to all those who reported the problem.
