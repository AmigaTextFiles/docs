DESCRIPTION

     LCD Calculator II is the first upgrade to the original
     LCD Calculator released in 1990.  The program was
     noted and/or pictured in AmigaWorld, .INFO and other
     magazines, and most recently included in the "Recommended
     Software" chapter of "Denny Atkin's Best Amiga Tips
     and Secrets" (1993, Compute Books).
     
     The program presents a graphically-gorgeous 4 function
     calculator with memory... the kind best suited for
     checkbook balancing and the like.  A direct mapping
     of the Amiga keyboard-to-calculator functions is
     illustrated and animated.  Both standard keyboards
     as well as the original Amiga 1000 keyboard are
     supported.

NEW FEATURES

     LCD Calculator II adds the features most often requested
     from the original.  Printing to file and/or PRT: (it will
     log to both at the same time; files are opened in "append"
     mode and date-stamped each time), color requester to
     permit customization of key calculator colors (preferences
     are saved across reboots), improved overflow handling,
     improved graphics, a few bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     none

PRICE

     $15.00 Shareware fee.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     Freely distributable.

OTHER

     I initially released a version (1.251) that would crash
     on startup.  I sent out this fixed version less than a
     week later.  My apologies if you were bitten by this :-(
     Please delete any of those bogus versions you may run into.
     Thanks.
