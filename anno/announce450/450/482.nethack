TITLE

	Amiga NetHack 3.1.3

VERSION

	Amiga NetHack 3.1.3 is the third patchlevel of NetHack 3.1.
	Saved games and bones files from previous versions (including
	previous patch levels of 3.1) will NOT work with this release.

AUTHOR

	NetHack is created by the NetHack Development Team and ported to
	the Amiga by the Amiga NetHack Team.  Please report bugs, problems,
	and suggestions to nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.  Please note
	that you are using the Amiga version.

DESCRIPTION

	NetHack 3.1 is a new generation of the dungeon exploration game
	NetHack.  It is a distant descendent of Hack, and a direct
	descendent of NetHack 3.0.  It is the product of two years of
	very intensive effort by the NetHack Development Team and its
	porting sub-teams.  Many parts of 3.0 were rewritten for
	NetHack 3.1, and many new features were added.

	We dedicate the game to the many players of 3.0, with special
	note of those who communicated with us and contributed their
	ideas to the development of this new version.

NEW FEATURES

	NetHack 3.1.3 is primarily a bug-fix update.  Other improvements
	are left for you to discover.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	NetHack runs on any Amiga with at least 2 meg of RAM and AmigaDOS
	1.3 or 2.04 (or later).  NetHack will run from floppy but a hard
	disk is strongly recommended - NetHack requires approximately 3
	meg of hard disk space.  The official binaries are packed with
	the lz archiver, version 1.92.

FTP INFORMATION

	The official binaries are available in two .lzh files on aminet.
	The files are NH31P3-1.lzh and NH31P3-2.lzh.  (They have been
	uploaded to the new directory on ftp.wustl.edu; I expect they
	will be moved to game/role.)

	In addition, the same files are available on linc.cis.upenn.edu
	(please limit transfers from linc to non-business hours, East
	Coast USA time).  The files on linc are in pub/NH3.1/binaries/amiga.
	Full source code for all versions of NetHack (Amiga, Unix, MS-DOS,
	Macintosh, OS/2, VMS, NT, Atari) is available in pub/NH3.1/source.


	The official binaries for Amiga NetHack come in two .lzh
	files.  Extract the installation instructions from the first
	archive (probably called NH31P3-1.lzh) with the following
	command:
	  lz x NH31P3-1.lzh NetHack/ReadMe
	and follow the directions.  Note that the ReadMe file will be
	in a NetHack subdirectory.

	We have been informed that the default stack is not big enough
	to unpack the archives with some archivers - if you have
	trouble unpacking the archives try increasing your stack to
	40000.

	For problems with the archives contact keni@oasys.dt.navy.mil
	or use the central address nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.
	Please mention that you are using the official Amiga binaries
	for 3.1.3.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	NetHack is freely-redistributable copyrighted code - please see
	the license for details.
