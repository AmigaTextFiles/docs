DESCRIPTION

    Inspire! V1.4 is the second release of JoshWorks Software's text 
    editor.


    Key features:
     * Uses new features of AmigaDOS Release 2 extensively
        Inspire! uses the ASL requester for font and file selection and
        uses the gadtools.library for standardized gadgets.  Also, the
        display database is used so that you may open any type of screen
        that your computer is capable of.  AmigaDos Release 3 style menus
        and gadgets are also supported without sacrificing compatibility
        with AmigaDos Release 2 machines.

     * Flexible multiple window handling
        You can select the previous and next windows via menu selections.
         Windows are added to the list according to which window is selected
         when you open that window.  That list may be displayed for quick
         selection.

     * AppIcon
        Drag'n'Drop icons from the workbench to load files into Inspire!

     * Iconify
        Inspire! can be iconified to get it out of your way when you're
        busy doing something else.

     * Fast text handling using true tabs
        The screen updates speedily as you edit.

     * True Amiga clipboards
        Local and true Amiga clipboards are both supported.

     * Right mouse button editing
        The right mouse button can be used to quickly cut, copy, and
        paste.

     * Word wrap
        Word wrapping may be set at any character position.

     * Turbo Loading and Saving of Files
        Files will load and save very fast using a speed up buffer,
         however, if you're low on memory, this function can be disabled.

     * Removing and adding of CR+LF line endings
        CR+LF end of line sequences are converted upon loading to a
        single LF sequence.  Optionally, they may be resaved in that
        format.

     * Printing task works in the background while you edit
        You no longer have to wait for your printer to finish in order for
         you to get back to editing your file.  A storage buffer is used
         to print from, which can also be disabled if you are low on
         memory.

     * Loading, saving and printing of clips
        Clips may be loaded, saved, and printed.  This also allows for a
         standardized way to insert files within another file.

     * Undo
        Errors may be corrected by selecting the Undo function.

     * Find and replace
        Text may be searched for and replaced.  Case sensitivity can be
        toggled on and off.

     * Bookmarks and jump to line
        You may store up to five locations in your document that may be
         quickly restored.  Also, you may jump to any given line.

     * Text centering
        Any selected area of text may be centered.

     * Case conversions
        Any selected area can be converted to three different case
         formats.

     * ARexx implementation
        ARexx macros may be assigned to any function key for quick access.


    Programming specific features:
     * C procedure listing for quick jumps to procedures
        All valid C procedures can be listed in a single window.  You may
        instantly jump to any one by clicking on it in the window.

     * Tab Blocks Left or Right
        Any selected blocks of text can be tabbed to the left or to the
        right.  This is a real time-saver for C programmers.

     * Auto indenting
        An auto indenting function may be turned on as needed.

     * Find matched bracket
        Inspire! will find the bracket that matches the one currently
        under the cursor.

     * Auto match bracket
        Inspire! can automatically show you the start bracket which
        matches the end bracket just typed for instant feedback of
        blocked off areas.
