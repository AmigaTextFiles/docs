DESCRIPTION

     MegaView is a front-end to your favorite file viewer. It is
     similar to "MultiView" from Workbench 3.0, but MegaView runs
     under 37.175. Front-end means that you specify which file you
     want to view, and MegaView selects the correct viewer programs,
     e.g. you specify a text file, and MegaView starts MuchMore with it,
     or you specify an ILBM file, and MegaView starts the Display program.
     MegaView can be configured to recognize almost any file type. It can
     be used from the shell as well as from an icon. Also included is the
     possibility to use an AppIcon or AppMenuItem with MegaView, so that
     all files dropped on the icon will get shown. MegaView can also be used
     as default tool, e.g. the default tool of your envarc:sys/def_*.info
     files. Note however that MegaView has _no_ buildin file viewing
     capabilities, it is, as stated, "just" a front-end.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     MegaView requires the whatis.library (included in the archive)
     and Workbench/Kickstart 2.04 (not included 8-). Not tested with
     V36 and V39. Will NOT run on 1.3!
