The Amiga Aminet archive is available now on CDROM.  The disc contains the
entire Aminet from amiga.physik.unizh.ch as of mid-May 1993.  It also contains
the old AB20 archive and most of comp.sources.amiga and comp.binaries.amiga.
We had to leave off some of the older comp.binaries.amiga files because the
disc was too full.  There is a total of 650 meg of stuff on this disc.

The disc is in Level-2 ISO-9660, which means that filenames are up to
32 characters, single case.  We made sure the filenames are unique in
the first 8 chars, so this disc will work okay MSDOS too.  The disc has
index files for several MSDOS BBS's.

The disc contains thousands of programs, including utilities, games,
development tools, graphics, business software, hardware documents,
sound and music programs, and much more.  If you want to check out what
is on this disc, the readme and index files are available via anonymous
ftp from cdrom.com in the directory /cdrom/cdroms/aminet.

The price is $25.  S&H is $5 (per order, not per disc) for US/Can/Mex, and
$10 for overseas.  If you live in California, please add sales tax.  You can
send a check or money order, or you can order with Visa/MC/AmEx.
