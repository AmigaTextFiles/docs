DESCRIPTION

     Ami2D forms the core of a collection of codes developed
     to perform various analyses on structures using the
     finite element technique.  Specifically, Ami2D is a
     pre/post-processor used to create two dimensional
     finite element models and to interpret the results from
     subsequent solutions.  It was developed to handle both
     "plane" and axisymmetric two dimensional finite element
     analysis problems.  It is a fairly general capability
     in the sense that a wide variety of two dimensional
     problems can be modeled by Ami2D.  Other codes are
     included to provide a fairly complete analysis
     capability.  These codes include the solvers (Lin2D and
     Nln2D), a node equivilence code (Equ2D), a node order
     optimizer (Opt2D), and a couple of ancillary codes
     (Rexxcon and Rexxbar).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The minimum system requirements for running the codes
     are:  A 68020 processor or better, 68881 floating point
     processor or better, AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher, ARexx and
     at least 2 megabytes of free RAM.  Optionally, a hard
     drive and lots more memory are highly desirable.
