DESCRIPTION:

Lyapunovia  is  a  mindboggingly  colorful  program  that  produces fractal
pictures from a simple mathematical formula called "Lyapunov Space".

Lyapunovia is by far the fastest Amiga implementation of this formula.

Lyapunovia pictures vary from colorful candy to mean  metal (or something),
offering  you  everything  you  ever  wanted  in  visual  representation of
mathematical abstractions.

Lyapunovia has been programmed with flexibility in mind: It works fine on a
512K A500  with no harddisk, but it can also take advantage of AGA graphics
and the internal FPU of the A4000.

The program is Shareware. Is has been thoroughly tested.


FEATURES:

Lyapunovia V1.5 features:

-Runs on all Amigas.
-AGA support.
-Optimized version for 68020+ CPUs.
-FPU support.
-Allows a zoom factor of 10,000,000,000,000,000!
-24 bit output. (To 65000 x 65000 pixels.)


PLEASE NOTE:

The previous version (1.0) was released as a limited, but working,
shareware program, with the full version only avaliable upon
registration. This time I decided to release the complete program for
everybody to enjoy.
However, registrations have dropped radically since that! I haven't
decided yet, but if the registration rate doesn't pick up within
a month or two, the next version of the program will be for the
registered users only.
I am currently implementing AREXX and elaborate animation facilities,
including camera "swoops" over evolving fractals. (Both to standard
Anim7 and to 24-bit formats.) Furthermore, I'm looking into other
types of fractals and the possibility of an xfrac.library standard.
(Fractal programmers, please contact me.)

So don't count on the others to do it! _Every_ registration makes a
big difference, as a both financial _and_ personal incentive for me!


DISTRIBUTION:

Lyapunovia is Freely Redistributable, as long as you distribute all the
files in the release!
It may not, however be sold for more than a nominal copying charge.
Fred Fish gets express permission to include the program in his library.


THIS RELEASE:

Release 1.5 includes:

-The Lyapunovia program and documentation. (In plain text and AmigaGuide
 format.)
-Nico Francois' ReqTools.library.
-A set of (IFF) palette files.
-A set of Lyapunovia coordinate files.
-A set of (IFF) pictures.


REQUIREMENTS:

An Amiga.


RELEASE DATE:

May 26th, 1993.
(Yes, this posting is _very_ late!)


AVALIABILITY:

You'll find the program on Fish Disk #877.
