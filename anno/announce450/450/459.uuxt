TITLE
         UUxT 

VERSION
         2.0

AUTHOR
         Asher Feldman, asher@shell.portal.com  or  Wizard0@cup.portal.com

DESCRIPTION
         UUxT is an update to UUx 1.0.  UUxT is the ultimate 
         uuencode/decode utility for the Amiga.  Uuencoding is 
         the process of converting a binary file into ASCII, so that 
         it may be transmitted over a text, or "mail only" network 
         such as the Usenet.  Many files are posted to the Usenet daily, 
         but the must be uudecoded before you can use them.  UUxT 
         makes the task of uuencoding and decoding simple, with its 
         amiga style command interface.  You can even LhA and uuencode 
         multiple files in a single step.  (And vice-versa)  (LhA is a 
         popular compression program/format that allows you to compress 
         and archive multiple files)  Also, UUxT will decode 
         uuencoded files with multiple mail headers and other 
         garbage in them.  So you can download multiple part 
         archives off the Usenet, and decode them without 
         editing out all the headers.  UUxT also allows you to decode
         multi-part archives without joining all the parts together
         first.

NEW FEATURES

         - Now allows you to encode multiple programs into a single               
           uencoded file.                                                           
                                                                         
         - Decodes all files in a "multi-file" uuencoded package.                 
                                                                         
         - Ability to decode "multi-part" (split) uuencoded files, without        
           having to first join them together.  The separate parts can even       
           be on separate volumes, allowing floppy users to decode larger         
           files.                                                                 
                                                                         
         - Bath decoding.  UUxT can now decode multiple uuencoded files at        
           once.                                                                  
                                                                         
         - Greatly improved status messages, and improved command line error-     
           checking.                                                              
                                                                         
         - No longer asks if you want to overwrite an exsisting file.  I liked    
           this feature at first, but it got annoying so I removed it.  I plan    
           on putting it back in the next version, along with a "QUIET" 
           parameter.
                                                                         
         - The 68030 version has been removed.  The new decode routines are       
           optimized and have caught up with the 030 version.
