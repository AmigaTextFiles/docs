I am considering a possible radical change to the way the current library
works, and would like to bounce it off the user community to guage the
interest level, gather suggestions, etc.

For the last couple of years, I have been regularly asked why I don't
distribute the library directly on CD-ROM, rather than floppy disks.
I'm starting to think that this may be the right time to consider switching
from a floppy based distribution to a CD-ROM based distribution.

First of all, the price of CD-ROM drives have dropped dramatically over
the last couple of years, and the cost of producing CD-ROM disks has dropped
as well, to the point where it might actually be cheaper to do a monthly
CD-ROM than to maintain the current floppy distributions of 10 disks every
3 to 4 weeks.

The current cost of a floppy based subscription averages about $40/month.
Depending upon quantity, the cost to subscribers for a CD-ROM distribution on
a monthly basis could be in the $20-$30 range, with vastly increased limits
on the amount of new material that could be distributed each month.  With
CD-ROM distributions I could easily include material that I now have to
routinely reject because of size considerations.  The material could be
organized in a more natural manner, along subject lines, like separate
directories for demos, games, utilities, animations, etc.  There would also
be no need to pack any of the material, it could be distributed "ready to
run", regardless of size (assuming no 300Mb animations of course).

The way I envision a CD-ROM distribution channel working is that each
monthly CD-ROM release would contain some fraction of older material that
has appeared on a previous monthly CD-ROM, along with the current months
new material.  As space is needed for new material, the older material
would be deleted, on a first in - first out basis.  Thus there would be
a significant overlap in the contents of each successive disk, with the
amount of overlap depending upon the quantity of new material appearing
on each CD-ROM.  Subscribers could elect to receive a new CD-ROM every
month, every two months, every three months, etc, according to their needs,
and probably not miss any material as long as the interval doesn't extend
past 5-6 months, assuming up to 100Mb of new material every month.

It would help me a lot to decide how feasible a CD-ROM distribution might
be if people interested in receiving the library directly on CD-ROM could
fill out the following short questionaire and either email it or send a
hardcopy back to:
