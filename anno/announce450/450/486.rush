TITLE

VERSION

    Demo release 1.0

AUTHOR

    Douglas Keller  dkeller@bix.com  Comments or questions welcomed.

DESCRIPTION

    Rush is a directory utility for AmigaDOS 2.0 or greater.  It
    allows files and directories to be manipulated quickly and
    easily.  Rush uses features of AmigaDOS 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0, and
    follows the Amiga User Interface Style Guide.

    This demo version differs from the registered version in the
    following ways:

     - The demo version will not save the definitions for the center
       gadgets, the settings file is ascii text so it can be changed
       with a text editor.

     - Annoying requesters will appear periodically in the demo
       version.

     - The registered version includes more utilities, see the
       registration section below for a full list.

FEATURES

    Rush is an AmigaDOS 2.0 directory utility with dozens of build in
    commands like copy, move, etc.  It can also execute AmigaDOS
    commands and ARexx scripts.

    Rush is fully localized and includes language catalogs for
    francais and deutsch.

    Rush takes fully advantage of AmigaDOS 3.0 and AGA.

    Rush has been tested with Enforcer and MungWall!
