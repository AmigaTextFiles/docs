@node Welcome

@{u}Welcome to the DraCo guide.@{uu}


When reading this guide, please remember:
 @{i}All translation- and typing-errors are intentional 
 and belong to the whole work of art.@{ui} ;-))


During a programer-meeting in Burlafingen near Ulm, Germany I had the
chance to take a look at the new Amiga clone developed by the german
company - MacroSystem.

As you may already know, its name is @{" DraCo " link DraCo-pix/Draco3.jpg/main}.
Two MacroSystem developers presented a proto version of the DraCo on
the meeting.


The included pictures were taken during the meeting by Christian
Gottschling, Frank J. Dürring and me, Lars Eilebrecht. 
Scanning was done by Christian Gottschling rsp. Frank J. Dürring 
with some fine-tuning done by me.
 

I thought some people may like to get some information about the DraCo,
therefore I decided to make this small compilation.
I do not claim that the information provided in this guide is 100% bug-free
or covers every detail of the DraCo, I just want to provide you with
some information about this new Amiga clone.

I hope you like it... :-)

@node Distribution

@{b}Feel free to write me an email if you like it... :-)@{ub}

This package may be freely distributed as long as no charge is made other
than to cover time and copying costs.  
This should be not higher than what Fred Fish charges from one of 
his freely redistributable disks.

The guide and the pictures must be distributed in their original
unmodified form.

It is allowed to distribute the package on the Meeting Pearls CD-ROMs,
the Aminet CD-ROMs and the Fred Fish CD-ROMs. 

Other commercial usage/distribution is @{b}not@{ub} allowed!

@node Requirements

@{u}What do you need to get happy with this package?@{uu}

   · an Amiga :-)

   · at least 'AmigaGuide' to view this guide
   
   · to follow the links to the pictures, you need 'MultiView'/OS 3.1
     (But of course you can view the pictures with an external viewer.)


@endnode

@node tech "Technical information"

@{i}Note: all links on this page are leading to pictures.@{ui}

@{u}DraCo package:@{uu}

  Hardware:
 
     · Motorola 68060 processor (66 Mhz version)

     · serial and parallel interfaces (up to 5 MByte/s)

     · SCSI-III host adapter

     · SCSI CD-ROM drive (currently a quadra speed drive is planned)

     · @{"DraCo-Retina" link DraCo-pix/Draco9.jpg/main} graphic card (4 MB version)

     · 4 MB @{"memory" link DraCo-pix/Draco7.jpg/main} (max 128 MB)

     · hard drive (various possiblities)

     · standard PC keyboard (Amiga keyboard is optional)

     · three button mouse

     · optional: PC floppy disk (1.44 or 2.88 MB version)
                 (not Amiga compatible)

     · optional: DEC Alpha co-processor card
                 planned is the use of the Alpha 21066 (233 MHz, 450 MIPS)

     · all this will come in one of those standard @{"tower cases" link DraCo-pix/Draco10.jpg/main}


  Software:

     · Operating system: Amiga OS 3.1 (WB 40.42, @{"Kickstart 40.48" link DraCo-pix/Draco2.jpg/main})

     · Bundled software: Planned is to include a CD-ROM with ADPro,
                         Morph Plus, Xi-Paint, Digital Image and AnCoS.


@{u}DraCo boards:@{uu}

  The DraCo consists mainly of about three @{"boards" link DraCo-pix/Draco0.jpg/main}, the motherboard with
  the slots, the DraCo version of the @{"Retina" link DraCo-pix/Draco9.jpg/main} and the @{"mainboard" link DraCo-pix/Draco4.jpg/main} with the
  @{"processor" link DraCo-pix/Draco5.jpg/main}, @{"memory" link DraCo-pix/Draco7.jpg/main}, @{"ROMs" link DraCo-pix/Draco2.jpg/main} and the @{"other chips" link DraCo-pix/Draco1.jpg/main}.

  The motherboard has two slot types, @{i}DraCo-Direct-Slots@{ui} and Zorro-II slots
  (no Zorro-III slots).
  MacroSystem says the do not need Zorro-III slots, because the
  @{i}DraCo-Direct-Slots@{ui} are faster with approx. 30 MByte/s.
  The DraCo can be equipped with seven cards (apart from the processor
  board). One slot must be used for the DraCo-Retina (direct-slot) the
  other slots can be either used for two DraCo cards and four ZII cards
  or one DraCo card and five ZII cards.

  It is planned to use Alpha processors cards as additional co-processors
  to give the system a performance boost.

@endnode

@node clone "Amiga clone"

People doing graphic related things and are in the need of a fast
machine are maybe interested in the DraCo, because it is a kind
of graphic workstation.

But the DraCo can not be seen as a @{i}real@{ui} Amiga, because no
Amiga-custom-chips are used (except the ROMs and CIA chips).
The DraCo @{i}only@{ui} uses the Amiga operating system and therefore
can run Amiga @{"programs" link compatible} that don't rely on Amiga-custom-chips.

Note: Currently the CIA chips are used for timing and for keyboard connection, but
      MacroSystem is trying to replace these 'special chips' with other ones.

@endnode

@node compatible "Compatible programs"

@{u}What programs will run on the DraCo?@{uu}

   All programs that @{b}don't@{ub} do any direct Amiga-custom-chip
   programming should work.
   They @{i}should@{ui}, but they may not do it... ,-)
   But most programs that work with graphic cards should work on the DraCo.
   Therefore most games relying on Amiga-custom-chips won't work.

   On the meeting we had the chance to test several programs on the DraCo.

   For example:
 
     · MPEG_play/MP (only in Retina24 mode, due to RetinaEmu problems)

     · MPEG codec (Standford)

     · MUI (Magic User Interface)

     · AmigaRoute

     · ImageFX 2.0 (thumbnail-requester didn't worked)

     · UMS (Universal Message System)

     · IntuiNews

     · Lightwave
    
     · ToolManager 2.1

     · Filer (some problems caused by the RetinaEmu)

     · ...


   Most of the tested programs worked without any problems, only the
   RetinaEmu caused problems with some programs.

@node Credits

I would like to say thanks to all people on IRC, channels #Amiga and #AmigaGER,
for the nice hours there...  :-)

Especially I have to thank Christian Gottschling who made most of the photos,
for lending me his camera during the meeting and for scanning the photos.
And to Frank J. Dürring who contributed three of the included pictures.

Thanks go also to Angela Schmidt and all the others who made the meeting
possible.

And of course, thanks to the guys from MacroSystem who showed us the DraCo.

And last but not least to all the other people from the meeting...
