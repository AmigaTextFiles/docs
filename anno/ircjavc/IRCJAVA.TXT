               AMIGA ONLINE JAVA CHAT ROOMS OPEN 18/5/98

Id Just like to annouce the online Java Chat Rooms for Amiga users just 
opened at this URL

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Network/7218/

What is it?
-----------

This Page contains a number of IRC CHAT ROOMS, linked via the net to a 
DALNET server allowing you to connect to IRC via your browser!

It is limited to JAVA and I know Amiga browsers dont support java, but ive
been told this will be with us soon! you can access it via emulation ie
Shapeshifter or by using a normal IRC client to connect to a DalNet server

See at the end to manually connect to DalNet.

what will you be able to access 
-------------------------------

AmigaGames
Amiga
AmigaNL
AmigaSWE
AmigaZONE
AmigaUSERS
Amirc
Amiga2d
Amiga-3d+
Amiga3d0
blitz

And soon many more chat rooms...

With Games, Technical, comms, amiga news in general, coding, what more 
could you need!

RULES
-----

This is Java IRC and IRC Has some rules....here they are

With that cleared up, lets introduce to the rules.....

NO FLAMING, NO ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR, NO SWEARING, NO FLOODING 

THESE CHANNELS ARE FOR CONSTRUCTIVE TALK, BY ALL MEANS SAY WHAT YOU THINK,
BUT RESPECT OTHER USERS, IF THEY HAVE THERE OWN IDEAS DONT CRITISE THEM,
OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE UNPOPULAR VERY QUICKLY!

Its important to stick to these guides as you will soon find yourself 
being banned from the rooms, they do have Operators by the way! some are
human, and will each react differently to sacasm and wit :) others are
BOTs...get used to that word, as you will be seeing a lot of them! :) 
what is a bot? a bot is quite simply a scripted program, set to respond 
to certain things, Ie a swear word my cause a bot to react in a automatic
way, advertising may, flooding etc you get the picture! so if your new, 
ask someone the rules of the perticular group first before saying to much!
and if it is a bot it may not be that talkative, so dont be offended if
it doesnt respond! :)

How Do I connect?
-----------------

Ok what do ya need to get started? simple a Java based web browser..aha
...first problem, Amiga Browsers dont actually suppot Java (YET!) but 
they will very very soon! this is the only way I could find to do this, 
so if there is any other way, by all means let me know!  So you either 
need a PC with a PC web browser (or mac!) or a dedicated IRC program for
the Amiga and hook up manually! (try spider.dal.net).

Here is a list of DalNet servers to manually hook up...
