-------- Introduction ------------------------------------------------------

                       Citizens of the World rejoice

        As of today, a new chapter of mankind's history has begun!

        This one man was called upon from the edge of the Universe

              Who will set you free from your deepest fears.

                      He shall forever be known as...

                               THE CRUSADER



Crusaders Productions ARE BACK!!!

AND THROUGH THE KANDU ORGANIZATION THEY ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO MAKE
THE GATHERING 1996 INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALTOGETHER.

TG 96 is set to be one of the most exciting parties this decade.

As The Gathering is having a 5 year celebration, we have made TG 96 a
special one (as always), where the focus is upon party, party and party.

The setting is the Vikingship in Hamar, Norway. Famous from the
Olympics, and one of the largest stadiums available in Scandinavia.
It is also one of the most modern and well equipped stadiums as well.

Rave-party, concerts, stand-up comedians and other attractions will be
held for those who need some extra stimulation during the long party
hours.

A ski-trip for those who want to enjoy the Olympic slopes of
Hafjell/Kvitfjell will be arranged. You can even rent the equipment you
need (the wooden planks needed to run down the slopes and poles to stick
in the snow [together with your heads :-D]).

We have heard your complaints about bad choice of locations, loss of power,
poor networking, expensive entry fees, prizes that were not paid until many
months after the party (if paid at all) and so forth...

THIS YEAR WE HAVE CORRECTED THEM ALL (well, most of them anyway).
By using professional companies instead of doing everything ourselves,
everything you need for a great party will be there.

                IN TIME, IN PLACE and IN A WORKING ORDER
                -----------------------------------------

Together with our connections in some of the largest companies around,
we're going to make THE GATHERING 1996 more fun, provide more non-stop
action, featuring more insane events than any other party!

As TG95 which was *NOT* arranged by KANDU (Crusaders, Cryptoburners,
Ano-Tech etc) many of the things from last year leaves a lot to be
desired. As a way of clearing this up, we wish to at least make the
competition prizes to be paid out. As of know, we have contact with 3 of
the prizewinners.

Calvin/Proxima already have received his prize for his 2nd place in the
PC 4K intro competition.

Trinity have received their prizes for the contribution(s) to the
animation/wild compo.

Valhalla received their prizes after the party last year.

Several others have also received the intention of the prizes.

Please contact us to receive more information if you didn't receive your
prize. We do this to state our seriousness and sincerity concerning the
name The Gathering.

Just of windy balloon full of hot air loaded with a pile of horsemanure
or a real fact? Keep your weary eyes open and read on...

LOCATION:   "VIKINGSKIPET" in Hamar, north of Oslo, Norway.
            The main hall from the '94 Olympics in Norway.
            (If you don't know what the Olympics are, you are just the
            guy we want at TG, and believe us, the hall is big!!!)
            They even held an INDOORS cross-country skiing event in
            this hall.

            12.000 square meters of pure pleasure (the same size as 3
            soccer fields or 3000 tabletennis tables.)
            The total area of the hall is 26 000 square meters
            and 350 000 cubic meters. (350 million liters).
            Stairsfree entrances (excellent for rolling those carts
            filled to the brink with equipment).

            3000+ seats, tables and SEPARATE poweroutlets available.
            Every person gets a seat, every person gets a tablespace
            and every person gets his own grounded poweroutlet.
                (1 power outlet per person, bring your own grounded
                 multiple power outlets to have more than one item
                 connected at a time).

            10 seperate LARGE wardrobes with 4-10 showers per wardrobe.
            Of course no money will be charged for this basic facility.
            Don't panic, bring your own towel!
            Sauna is optionally available.

            Coin-operated laundry to get those clothes refreshened.

            Catering will be provided. Junkfood and not-so-junk
            food will be served at your leisure.
            Silicone and methane lifeforms make special arrangments.

            Sleeping area is inside the hall. You will be allowed to
            sleep next to your beloved computers, separate
            facilities will be available for those who require less
            noisy environment to sleep in.

            Also, for those who need something less 'campy', there's a
            motell next-door with 56 rooms totalling 224 beds.
            Be warned that these rooms are often filled to the rim with
            other tourists.

            Swimminghall, tennishall and so on are available in the
            Hamar area, but at this time, opening hours at Easter is not
            available.

PARKING:    Big parking facilities available immediately outside the hall
            at no extra charge. Will take any kind of possible vehicle
            you can arrive in. Extraterrastials call ahead for separate
            reservations.
            Limousine service available.
            No car queues at ANY time to the main road, or blocking of fire
            lanes to the main road. Failure to do so will result in
            summerily towing, no warnings will be given! There's plenty of
            parking space, so there's no need for a queue anyhow.

DATE:       Easter'96
            System Boot     : Tuesday  2 April 1996 00:01
            System Shutdown : Saturday 6 April 1996 16:00

            before 0:01.
            Official openening and the time which every feature will be
            available is 12:00.

PRICE:      More than 110 hours of party for 200 NOK! (About US$ 30).
            This requires you to pay in advance. If you wish to pay at
            the entrance, the fee will be 250,- NOK (About US$ 37).
            This gives you an exciting party for less than 50 cents an

PREREGISTRATION:
            Filling out this form and paying in advance will bring you
            straight past the queue in the registration hall. In
            addition, it will save you the fair amount of NOK 50,-.
            You will need to include a facial photo 3x4 cm.
            Having this information HANDY upon entering the hall, without
            prepaying will also save you a lot of time.

            It is GREATLY appreciated.

            Then we need to know what you intend to bring to TG'96.

            Other hardware  :
            Other hardware  :

            Now fill out the PostalGiro or BankGiro, and pay the amount of
            200,- NOK pr. attendant. If you pay for more than one person,
            make a clear note here for which person(s) you are paying.

            The PostalGiro account name, adress and number is:

            Put the reference name for payment in the adress field
            for the payee with a complete name and address.
            Failure to do so can cause your payment to end up as little
            else than an anonymous gift to TG96.

            All the attendants must fill out their own registration-forms
            and include a photo. If you send several preregistration-forms
            in one envelope give each photo a number, and write the same
            number in the form that it belongs to. Please fill out the form
            as correct as possible, and do not make jokes with sex:
            (ie. SEX: YES, plenty! or similar). If the data we receive are
            incorrect, you will have to line up with the others. The photo
            will be used for the ID-card, and is a reference to your face,
            so do not send a photo of your girlfriends beaver, your dog,
            or your 128 year old grandpa.

            If someone else is paying for you:

            _________________________________________ is paying for me.

            If we do not receive the payment, or are incapable of verifying
            that proper payment has occured, you have to pay entrance at
            the gate as everybody else (so be concise to avoid
            misunderstandings).

            If you are paying for others.
						Send the forms and Photos
I pay for these people:                         to us, and you will recieve
_________________________________________       an ID-card, which you MUST
						bring. The card will be your
_________________________________________       proof of payment.

SLEEPING:   Special arrangements with the local fire department allow

            You'll be allowed to sleep next to your dear computers.

TV-STATIONS:
            As a lot you sets up your own TV-stations, we wish to
            provide with the best transmittance possibilities available.
            To make the Tech-crew help you out with this, a few rules
            have been set.
                - No pornography or violence level which violates
                  Norwegian law will be allowed.
                - One person will be made editor and be our contact
                  person. He's also responsible for the content of his
                  TV-station.
                - A schedule for transmittance MUST be sent the
                  Tech-Crew to allow for other transmitters.
                  This schedule includes which CHANNEL and what TIMES
                  the transmitter will be send. This allows us to help
                  you bugfix your transmissions in case of difficulty.
                - A channel-indicator has to be included in the picture,
                  this indicator can be any kind of logo or similar.
            By doing this, you can just ask the Tech-crew to assist you
            in setting up your transmissions, and possibly relay it to
            the main screen.

FIRE REGULATIONS:
            See parking and general rules.
            In case of fire, warnings will be issued over the PA-system
            and by our guards, there's no need for a panic, as the hall
            is built to evacuate 19 000 people within 60 seconds.
            Warnings by alarm systems will be given MANUALLY and will be
            verified by our guards, so please report any incidents to
            your nearest guard immediately.
            The fire dept. is located at the side of the hall, and they
            will support us to avoid unnecessary firedrills or
            situations.

MEDICAL REGULATIONS
            Be aware of your own limitations and contact one of our
            guards if you need assistance. Also be aware of your
            buddies. Astmatic and diabetic attacks have been observed
            earlier and will hopefully not occur at Hamar.

-------- Rules -------------------------------------------------------------

General rules that really should be obvious...

- Fireregulations allow us sleep inside the hall (in fact, the fire
  dept. is at the side of the hall, so they'll watch over us).
  HOWEVER, parking regulations provides the following:
  No car queues at ANY time to the main road, or blocking of fire lanes
  to the main road. Failure to do so will result in summerily towing,
  no warnings will be given!! There's plenty of parking space, so
  there's no need for a queue anyhow.

- Political, racist and religious activities will not be tolerated.
  The organizers reserve EXCLUSIVE right to determine what will be
  tolerated or not.

- Commercial activity or trading will not be allowed without prior written
  permission from the organizers. (And a proper bribe of course).

- Alcohol, drugs, firearms, projectile weapons, fireworks and nuclear devices
  not intended for public transportation are not allowed inside or
  immediately outside the hall.

- No flammable unnecessary material allowed. This includes

arenas that hosted the alpine diciplines during the 1994 Winter Olympics.
These are two of Scandinavia's most modern alpine centers today, well suited
for those family members who don't want to spend the entire week indoor.
