  The enclosed files are all sample pictures generated by
current or early releases of World Construction Set. Some
files have had obvious post-rendering processing done to
them (text overlay in several, pseudo smoke in another.)
This is the only processing done. These images are _real_
output.

  We apologize for the rather high JPEG compression, but
with the great variety of capabilities our program has, we
wished to iunclude a number of very different images while
still keeping the archive small enough for people to handle.

  If you would like higher-quality versions of any of these
images to examine, feel free to contact us.

  Also included is a large 16-color 1024x768 screenshot of
the program in operation. This picture shows some dozen or so
of the program's requesters. This is not a composite -- WCS'
nonmodal design allows you to be working in several different
places at once. Don't let the picture scare you, you don't
_have_ to have all those windows open. But you could. I
attempted to get all of the most interesting capabilities
into view on the screen, but even then, several would not fit.

  Finally, you will also find a file called WCS-Info.txt. This
file contains some exhuberant ad copy about our beloved
program, and a bulleted feature-list.

  The pictures and texts enclosed are all copyright 1993-1994
by Questar Productions, but may be freely distributed for
non-profit use.

  Finally, if you have _any_ questions at all, feel free to
contact us, electronically, by mail or by phone.
