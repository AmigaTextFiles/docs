REVISE DAN

Hi Dan,

-> Ben-
->
-> Thank you for your submission to comp.sys.amiga.announce.  Before I
-> put it on the newsgroup, I'd like you to make a few small changes.
->
-> You are not using the proper URL format.  Please see the document
-> "Guidelines for Software Announcements" for an explanation of how to
-> do this.  The document is available from the mail server at
-> announce@cs.ucdavis.edu and can be found on the newsgroup.  Please
-> read it carefully.
->
-> You don't explain what kind of News installation this will work with.
-> Is it OK if you get it through UUCP?  What about if you just pull it
-> off of an NNTP server and don't keep News locally.  Does it work if
-> the News is downloaded via the Internet and kept locally?  All of
-> these?  Something else?  Which software does it work with?  Please
-> explain.  You may want to put this in the SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS section.
->
-> Don't announce your other software here.  Use another announcement!
->
-> You ask for a fee of "10".  This newsgroup is international!  Do you
-> mean ten pounds, dollars, deutch marks, or what?  Please be more
-> specific.
->
-> After you have made these changes, please send the announcement in
-> again using the REVISE DAN command.  I take care of all such revisions
-> before the other announcements.
->
-> Thanks!!
->
-> 					-Dan

Sorry about the errors, this is my first posting (no excuse, I
know:)). If you've read my other email, you know why you won't be
able to see the pound sign in between these quotes "" (It's a
fnord!).

Thanks for your help,

Ben

DESCRIPTION

	GroupEditor is a tool which uses any NNTP grouplist as a
	basis on which to create a new uulib:newsgroups list. Simple,
	button-based and, most importantly, there is no typing
	needed. GroupEditor also lets you set the number of days
	articles should be kept before being subjected to TrimNews.
	You can also edit newsgroups lists apart from
	uulib:newsgroups (for AmiTCPHelper support).

NEW FEATURES

	New to version 1.01 are the following features:

	 Multiple source and destination documents, general tidying
	up.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	None (apart from an internet account :) ). This tool is
	designed to allow the user to edit a local NNTP group list
	for use with offline news reading such as TIN.

	version is for people who don't have CanDo.library v 3.6 the
	other is for people who do have it:

	ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/comms/tcp/TCPGroupEd100NoLb.lha (7004)

	GroupEditor is nominally shareware, although nothing has
	been disabled and there are no annoying requesters. The fee
	is 10 UK Pounds.

	is 10. GroupEditor comes with CanDo.library version 3.6
