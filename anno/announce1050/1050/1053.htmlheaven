Sorry, but I have to disagree. I cut the REVISE DAN out of your
e-mail and pasted it into the revised announce. As I do save my
outgoing mail I'm able to retrieve that actual message. Here it
is: (I've put a ! in front of the headers.) I've also just sent
that exact same message to announce again.

DESCRIPTION
        HTML-Heaven is a suite of three programs intended to make the
        creation and maintenance of WWW (HTML) pages easy. The programs
        in the suite interface with your favorite editor (providing it
        supports text insertion via ARexx) to provide you with a very
        comfortable environment. Now inserting HTML commands is as simple
        as point and click. This is the upgrade from version 1.0 with a
        host of new features.

NEW FEATURES
        version 1.01 has all the features of version 1.0. Plus:
        * New Tooltypes/CLI parameters:
          - HTML (UPPERLOWER) specify if outputted HTML commands are
            to be in upper or lower case.
          - MENU (COMBINESPLIT) specify if the menu should be with
            submenu's for the different HTML categories. (Like version
            1.0) or that each HTML category gets their own menu.
        * New editors supported. Turbotext and Textra.
        * Now also supports HTML fill-in forms.
        * A number of other HTML commands like <CENTER>, ALT=, HEIGHT=,
          WIDTH=, <HTML> and so on have been added.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
        HTML-Heaven requires:

        * A Text-Editor allowing insertion of text via ARexx. Examples of
          such editors are SC, Ed, GoldEd, CygnusEd, FRexxEd to name a few.
        * Workbench 2.04 or above.
        * Around 1MB of free memory.
        * About 200KB of floppy or harddisk space.

|Please send in your revisions with the proper REVISE DAN
