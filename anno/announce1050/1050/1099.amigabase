Dear Dan,

yes I used the old instructions. I stored them some time ago 
and reused them now. I just have been lazy to use the new instructions,
sorry for that.

Here is the new announcement.

DESCRIPTION
    
    AmigaBase is a powerful programmable database with 
    its own graphical user interface.

    AmigaBase is not a relational database with SQL interface 
    or something like this.  Nevertheless, or just because, 
    AmigaBase is ideal for managing music cassettes, videos, 
    addresses, etc. Complex applications like a finance manager 
    with automatic printing of transfer forms and writing client 
    accounts is no problem for AmigaBase, too.

    AmigaBase knows of the following data types: BOOLEAN 
    (boolean values), CHOICE (one item out of many items),
    INTEGER (integer values), REAL (floating point values),
    STRING (any text), DATE (date values), TIME (time values),
    and MEMO (unlimited multi line text).

    For more information see the ReadMe file in the archive.

NEW FEATURES

      o  Danish and French catalog file.
      o  New programming functions: Filename, Changes, ARexxPort,
         ChooseString, Now, StrCmp and ChoiceLabels.
      o  Improvements for file requesters.
      o  Many bug fixes and other improvements.
