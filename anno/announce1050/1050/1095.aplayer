REVISE DAN
I've been designing most of the program (as stated in the manual), and
Thomas haven't got Internet access untill 2 days ago :) so I was supposed
to do the uploading stuff! (Sorry but I completely forgot this note in the
first revise :)

TITLE

     APlayer

VERSION

     1.21 ("APlayer works on OS2.0 again"-version :)

AUTHOR

     Thomas Neumann

DESCRIPTION

     The AccessiblePlayer is our contribution to the Amiga market of  music
     players.  We thought that our favourite player (Smartplay) just wasn't
     good  enough  anymore, and  since  neither D.A.S.  Modplayer  nor  the
     Delitracker fulfilled our needs we decide to write our own player.

     We hope we  have reached our  goal by making a  small, fast and  user-
     friendly player, the AccessiblePlayer.

NEW FEATURES

     - Now works with OS2.0 again! There was some  mistakes in version 1.20
       of APlayer. Delete that archive and use this version!

     - The  name  of  the  active  module  is  printed  in the main windows
       titlebar if you zip the window.
     - Besides that only some minor bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher)
