REVISE DAN

My name is Jaco Barnhoorn, president of Barnie Productions and member of 
IPR's design- and programmers-group. I'm not familiar with xs4all's unix
system so I don't know yet how to change 'barnie' into 'Jaco Barnhoorn'.
Maybe you can do it when you post this announcement. Also, you are right 
about my English... it 's not perfect and you're welcome to correct
all errors/faults/mistakes I made. Please notify me if your corrections
turns out to be a major rewrite - it's not my intention to let you
do the job of promoting Barnie Production's first product!
IPR is already reviewed by a Dutch Magazine, called Amiga Magazine (what's
in a name...) and with good results!
