TITLE

	AmiTCPHelper

VERSION

	Version 1.09

AUTHOR

	Ben Vost. email me at: Ben@subway.demon.co.uk

DESCRIPTION

	AmiTCPHelper is a button-based front end for Internet
	operations. You can use it to link up, link down, read and
	send mail, FTP, browse the Web and use Gopher. In addition to
	these features, you can also use Ping and Finger and
	synchronise your computer's clock to another machine.
	AmiTCPHelper also lets you select between different
	newsgroups and also lets you edit important files without you
	having to go looking for them (ie. your dialscript,
	datestamp, newsgroups, aliases, etc.). AmiTCPHelper is
	very configurable letting you set its window position and what
	programs you want to use for all its features.

NEW FEATURES

	New to version 1.09 are the following features:

	Added startnet script editing in the Edit menu.
	Added IRC and Prefs buttons to the interface which has been
	jiggled to fit the new buttons in without requiring more
	space. The Prefs button doesn't work at the mo, but will
	eventually let you edit TCP-related ENV variables and the
	co-ordinates and size of the windows that AmiTCPHelper opens
	amongst other things.

	The Get News button now works! Hurrah!

	Multiple mail folders. If you have more than one mail
	folder, AmiTCPHelper asks which one you wish to enter.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	The only special requirement I can think of is the fact that you
     	really need AmiTCP to use this tool, but just so you know, it
     	has been tested on a PAL Amiga 3000T which PicassoII, 2MB Chip,
     	16MB Fast, blah, blah...

AVAILABILITY

	AmiTCPHelper is available on the Aminet in two versions. One
	version is for people who don't have CanDo.library v 3.6 the
	other is for people who do have it (if you already have the
	library, then you can get the NoLb version):

	ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/comms/tcp/TCPHelp109.lha(130544)
	ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/comms/tcp/TCPHelp109NoLb.lha(13394)


PRICE

	AmiTCPHelper is nominally shareware, although nothing has
	been disabled and there are no annoying requesters. The fee
	is 10 UK Pounds.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	AmiTCPHelper is copyright Ben Vost 1995. It's shareware fee
	is 10 UK Pounds. AmiTCPHelper comes with CanDo.library version 3.6
	which is copyright Inovatronics.

OTHER

	AmiTCPHelper was written (using CanDo) for use with Demon
	Internet Services dialup account facility but with a bit of
	tweaking it should work with any account provider. Please
	send me details if you want AmiTCPHelper to work with a
	different account provider's setup.
