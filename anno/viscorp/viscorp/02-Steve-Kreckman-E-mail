I got a reply on mail mail concerning the Power Amigas and development in
general. No I think we all can relax and actually look forward to all
this.

We have no plans for scrapping any projects in the works. We're not out to
radically alter or gut Amiga Technologies. We need to keep our developer
happy and thriving, not piss them off.

Any improvements to the chipsets that we make can and will be applied to all
the product line. We want to keep the Amiga architecture intact, not take it
in a radically new direction. If we change the architecture, we break a lot
of existing software and that's like shooting ourselves in the foot. We will
grow the computer side of the business along with our own set top boxes.

Look for announcements in the very near future on our web site at
http://www.vistv.com

Cheers, Steve

I got a reply on my letter concerning the deal. I think those guys really 
have intentions to let Amiga Tech in Germany go on as planned and to 
really develope the Amiga chipsets. They also have new visions on the 
Amiga, can be good for the Amiga.

Hi,
Thanks for your concern. Just to let you know, we are not just another
faceless corporate entity looking to disembowl companies for a profit.
The pricipal people (myself included) involved in VisCorp are
ex-Commodore folks, both managers and engineers. We're the same group
that brought you CDTV.

Believe it or not, there are people in charge of the Amiga that
actually *care* about the technology. What a concept. One of the main
reasons that we considered what some might call a 'dead' platform for
our set-top applications is that there is still a huge, loyal developer
base on tap. We plan on making the best use of available applications
and talent.

Our set-top boxes are architecturally similar to the current Amiga
products so anything we do to promote the current Amiga lines only
helps us in the long run. We intend to continue production of existing
models and we *will* consider the development of new machines.

Our primary purpose for wanting to aquire the technology is to support
it properly, improve the chipsets, and apply the technology in new
markets. Things that the old C= never wanted to do. The Amiga
architecture is key to our own products and we wanted to insure its
future.

We *like* the Amiga and intend to keep up production of the current
models. The vision isn't dead, it's being reborn.

Cheers, Steve

They seems to care about the Amiga and also want to move it into new 
markets. I really hope the PPC Amigas will see the day of light anyway!
