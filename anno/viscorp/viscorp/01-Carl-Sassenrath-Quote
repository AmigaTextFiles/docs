The following quote is from Carl Sassenrath, Director of Software for
VISorp, the company which has proposed a plan to purchase Amiga
Technologies from Escom. His comments were in answer to questions
posed to him about the future of the Amiga from CUCUG. He has made
these comments to others on the net, as well.

"What I have been telling people is not to worry.  We are all Amiga
lovers here. Unlike ESCOM or even Commodore, VIScorp does not have a
single IBM PC person in the group.  We are all solid Amigans from the
very beginning (for example, I developed the Amiga's Multitasking OS,
CDTV system, AmigaLogo, Bay, OptCD, ISOCD, etc.).

Personally speaking, I don't plan on killing the Amiga.  In fact, if
they ask me to take over system development, you'll see one killer
Amiga!"
