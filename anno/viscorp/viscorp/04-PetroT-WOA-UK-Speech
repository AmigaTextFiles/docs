  Keynote from Petro Tyschtschenko, April 13 1996 Press conference at World of
  Amiga in London
  
                           Ladies and Gentlemen,
                                      
   First of all, I'd like to thank you for being here at this first World
                     of Amiga show in the UK this year.
                                      
     As you might most certainly have heard already, our company, Amiga
       Technologies GmbH is about to be sold by ESCOM to VIScorp. The
   process, engaged by the signature of a binding letter of understanding
    between ESCOM, VIScorp and Amiga has been announced on Thursday this
                                   week.
                                      
       I will use this opportunity to introduce you Mr. William Buck,
   president and CEO of VIScorp. I'm quite sure that Bill will say a few
                             words afterwards.
                                      
     A lot of questions arise. Why is this happening ? Who is VIScorp ?
                      What does this mean for Amiga ?
                                      
   In 1995, when ESCOM took over the intellectual property of the former
    Commodore, ESCOM was in a financially good shape. The year 1994 had
      been excellent and the corporate policy was set to expansion. A
    multimedia company was formed. The decisions taken at this time were
       good and ESCOM saved the Amiga computer from its bad destiny.
                                      
    Amiga Technologies was founded and Amiga computers were brought back
    to a demanding market. Strategic decisions were taken to ensure the
     venue of new technology based models as soon as possible. We have
          achieved all this and we are proud of that performance.
                                      
     Of course, all these projects and plans are to be financed. it was
   clear from the beginning that it would take some time for a break-even
   point to be reached. The company created in may 1995 only could begin
   with sales in mid-September. We have then sold 40 thousand A1200 , 13
   thousand monitors and 2000 A4000T machines worldwide until now, which
                          is a satisfying result.
                                      
   As you might be aware of, ESCOM is currently facing a quite difficult
    financial situation. A bad christmas season and inventory write offs
      were the main reasons for this. This situation of course is also
       directly affecting Amiga Technologies. The fact is that ESCOM
   currently does not have the financial resources needed to support the
      still ongoing costs of our operation, especially advertising and
                          research & development.
                                      
   To continue a successfull Amiga business, a solution to this situation
   has to be found. I checked a lot of possibilities, I looked into a lot
   of alternatives. Ladies and Gentlemen, I personnaly think that VIScorp
   is one of the best solutions. It is a very interesting opportunity for
                                our future.
                                      
    Last year, in december, a license agreement was signed between Amiga
     Technologies and VIScorp, for the making of the Amiga set-top box.
     This product is network oriented and needs a system like the Amiga
   with its video abilities and tight operating system. The relationship
     between Amiga Technologies and VIScorp built up from this time on
                         became closer and closer.
                                      
    VIScorp is a research & development oriented company. These research
    efforts are based on the Amiga technology for use in set top boxes.
    Former Commodore engineers work for VIScorp, which will of course be
      an appreciable synergy for the development of Amiga in general.
                                      
   The set-top box market is huge and will be a fantastic engine for our
                                activities.
                                      
     As I told our staff yesterday, this procedure is not affecting our
     daily business and ongoing projects, as well as my position as the
    president of the company. We want the migration to be made as smooth
   and transparent as possible, for our company and also for our business
                     partners and the Amiga community.
                                      
    I am confident that this is a good chance for us to be successful in
                                the future.
                                      
   When this deal will be finalised, the Amiga technology will return to
       an american company, which understands our technology and its
                               manufacturing.
                                      
                            Thank you very much.
