                          NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
                                      
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   This Agreement is made between Visual Information Services Corp.
   (VIScorp), a Nevada corporation, having offices at 111 North Canal
   Street, Suite 933, Chicago, Illinois 60606-7204, and
   ____________________________________.
   
   WHEREAS, the parties find it mutually beneficial to discuss business
   and technical matters relating to set-top boxes.
   
   WHEREAS, it is in the interest of both parties to disclose, one party
   to the other, certain information that is considered confidential and
   proprietary in order to most effectively further the purpose of these
   discussions and only to further the purposes of these discussions,
   
   NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed as follows:
   
    1. Information relating to the Business may be designated as
       confidential and/or proprietary by a party if it is reasonably
       held by that party to be relevant to the success of its business
       and it is not known to the public. A party that furnishes
       confidential information shall be designated the
       &quotDiscloser.&quot The party receiving such information shall be
       designated the &quotRecipient.&quot
    2. For the purpose of the Agreement, written information that is
       considered confidential or proprietary shall be so marked by the
       Discloser. Information that is furnished orally shall be
       considered confidential if the disclosure so indicated at the time
       of the furnishings of said information.
    3. In addition to the above, furnished information shall be
       confidential if it is obvious from its content if the context
       under which it is furnished that it is confidential.
    4. The Discloser may give notice in writing that written or verbal
       information that has been previously furnished, but not declared
       confidential, is in fact confidential. This information is to be
       treated as &quotConfidential&quot by the Recipient from the time
       of receipt of said notice. The Recipient is to make reasonable
       efforts to mark all written copies of such information under its
       control as &quotConfidential&quot or &quotProprietary&quot and to
       make reasonable effort to inform the Discloser of any disclosures
       by the Recipient to third parties of such information that have
       occurred between the time of receipt of the information and
       receipt of notice that it is confidential. Recipient has no
       responsibility to attempt to control the use of such information
       by such a third party.
    5. For a period of five (5) years from the date of receipt, all
       Confidential information shall be maintained in confidence by
       Recipient, shall not be disclosed to any third party, and shall be
       protected with the same degree of care as recipient normally uses
       in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary
       information, but in no case with any less degree than reasonable
       care. Recipient further agrees not to use any confidential
       information received from Discloser except for the purposes set
       forth herein.
    6. The restrictions herein set forth shall not apply with respect to
       information designated by Discloser as Confidential which:
         1. Is known by Recipient at the time of receipt as evidenced by
            Recipient's records, or
         2. Is or becomes a part of the public domain without breach of
            the Agreement by Recipient, or
         3. Is obtained by Recipient from a third party under conditions
            permitting its disclosure to others, or
         4. Is independently developed by Recipient, or
         5. Is disclosed by Recipient pursuant to judicial action or
            Government regulations provided Recipient notifies Discloser
            prior to such disclosure and cooperates with Discloser in the
            event Discloser elects to legally contest and avoid such
            disclosure.
    7. Except as expressly herein provided, this Agreement shall not be
       construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or
       implicitly, any rights, licenses, or relationships by the
       furnishing of Confidential information pursuant to the Agreement.
    8. All tangible information, including drawings, specifications and
       other information furnished hereunder shall remain the property of
       the Discloser. If either party elects not to pursue any further
       business undertaking, Recipient (being either or both of the
       parties) shall promptly return all tangible information, including
       any and all copies or partial copies thereof.
    9. This Agreement shall become effective as of date second written
       below and shall terminate two (2) years thereafter. Expiration of
       the term of the Agreement shall not relieve either party of any
       obligation set forth in Paragraph 5 with respect to Confidential
       information, and all such obligations shall continue until
       expiration of the period set forth in Paragraph 5.
   10. This Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance
       with the laws of the State of Nevada in the United States of
       America.
   
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed as of the date
   second written below.
