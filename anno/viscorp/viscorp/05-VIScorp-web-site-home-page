I have put together the documents - etc from the VIScorp site for viewing
by people who are not yet on the Internet. This document contains info on
the AMIGA People who work there and at the end are some of their e-mailed
statements to other that I seen. I hope you will get the same good vibes
from all this that I have..... Jerry Smith - jws@cris.com
