Dear Fellow *#@%$? Amiga survivor,

I have tried to gather together documents from reliable sources and the 
VIScorp web site for your viewing pleasure.

I know those with Internet access will most likely have visited the 
VIScorp site at HTTP://WWW.VISTV.COM and have read most of what appears
here. This is more directed at those with only Amiga BBS access who
have heard all kinds of rumours about the sky falling.

Please post this archive on any and all Amiga BBSes in your area and
feel free to reproduce any and all of this to share with fellow Amiga
users.

The documents in this archive are numbered for handy reference and
some documents will reference these numbers by using a *# notation.

I hope you get the same good vibes from all this that I have.....

                             Have fun,

                                  Jerry Smith  -  jws@cris.com
