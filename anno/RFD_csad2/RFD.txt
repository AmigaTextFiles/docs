	About what's going on about comp.sys.amiga.demos

	Finally, after 2 months the RFD for c.s.a.d. is posted.

	You can't vote yet ! This is just a proposal for the
	creation of a comp.sys.amiga.* newsgroup concerning
	the amiga demo-scene. In 21 days after the official
	posting of the RFD voting takes place. More info about
	that in a coming posting.

	The RFD was officialy posted on 19 June '96, which means
	that official voting starts 10 July '96. More information
	in the CFV (Call For Votes) that will be posted then.

	For those who are too lazy to read the complete RFD,
	here's a summary.

	Advantages of a comp.* newsgroup above a comp.* group:

	 - comp.* newsgroups are more common, ie.: more newsservers
           will carry this newsgroups (opposite of alt.* newsgroups).
	   This means that more people are able to follow and post
	   in comp.sys.amiga.demos than in alt.sys.amiga.demos/
	   alt.amiga.demos;

	 - there's generally speaking less spamming in comp.* news-
	   groups than in alt.* newsgroups. This way there won't
	   be that much pyramid-schemes as there are now in both
	   alt-groups that cover the amiga demo-scene;

	 - with this we hope to join the two existing amiga demo-
	   scene newsgroups into one. At the moment these two
           run next to eachother.
