I have some interesting news tidbits concerning my 1000 disk archive
CD-ROM.  Please feel free to give this information the widest possible
distribution, such as uploading to local BBS's and other electronic
news services, since I would like to reach as many authors of material
in the library as possible.


CD-ROM NAME
-----------

I have decided on "Goldfish" for the name of the CD-ROM.  Previously I
had considered "Frozenfish", but after input from many users, I
decided to reserve that name for the periodic archives of material
from the Freshfish CD-ROM's.  So what I previously refered to as
quarterly CD-ROM's will be "Frozenfish", and the 1000 disk archive
CD-ROM will be "Goldfish".


COMPLIMENTARY CD-ROM's FOR AUTHORS
----------------------------------

I have allocated a minimum of 1000 free CD-ROM's for authors of
material that has been included (or will be included) in the floppy
library.  The floppy library would not have existed without the hard
work and generosity of people who released their software for free
redistribution.  Yes, I (or people working with me) spent many
thousands of hours over the last eight years organizing this material,
but without the authors, there would have been no material to
organize.  Depending upon the total number of Goldfish CD-ROM's
ordered, I may be able to increase the number of complimentary copies
to authors, but I can't promise more at this time.

If you are the author of material that was included on any floppy
between 1-1000, you can request your free copy (including shipping and
handling, send no money) by sending me email, a written request, or a
FAX, as follows:

	email:	fnf@cygnus.com  or  fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com

	mail:	Amiga Library Services
		610 N. Alma School Road, Suite 18
		Chandler, AZ  85224-3687
		USA

	FAX:	(602) 917-0917

There is one catch though (isn't there always :-).  Your request must
be accompanied by a "Product-Info" file for use in indexing the
material on the Goldfish CD-ROM.  The specification for Product-Info
files was recently posted to comp.sys.amiga.announce (Draft #5:
940205).  Please use that one or any later one that may be posted in
the future.  If you can't find a copy of the spec, I will be happy to
email you one.

The Product-Info file must be submitted in electronic form, either via
email or on a mailed AmigaDOS floppy, and must reach me no later than
March 15, 1994.  FAX'd requests must be followed up within a
reasonable time by a suitable Product-Info file via email or floppy.
Once I've received both the request for a CD-ROM and the Product-Info
file, I will assign you a sequence number for the free CD-ROM queue,
and you should receive a written confirmation within two weeks.

If you qualify for a complimentary CD-ROM, and have already previously
ordered the Goldfish CD-ROM, you can receive a refund or apply your
balance to selecting another CD-ROM, your choice.


STRUCTURE OF GOLDFISH CD-ROM
----------------------------

Now that I have all the material copied from my master floppies to a
hard drive based staging area for the Goldfish CD-ROM, I can better
judge what will fit where.  As a result, I have decided that Goldfish
will be a two CD-ROM set.

The first CD-ROM will contain the contents of floppy disks 1-750 in
unarchived form, the second CD-ROM will contain the contents of floppy
disks 700-1000 in unarchived form and the entire 1-1000 floppies in
archived (BBS-ready) form.  The archived form will have separate lha
archives for each of the main directories on the floppy (I.E.  for
each different submission), one lha archive for all the "overhead"
files like my usual readme type files, contents files, etc, and a CRC
list for the file contents.  There will be a program, tentatively
called GenFloppy, that uses these archives and CRC list to regenerate
any floppy or sequence of floppies on demand, directly off the CD-ROM.

The 2-CD Goldfish set will sell for the same price as each Freshfish
or Frozenfish CD-ROM, currently $19.95 plus shipping and handling when
ordered directly from me, slightly higher when purchased over the
counter from a retail outlet or through a local distributor (suggested
$29.95 retail or equivalent in local currency).

EXCLUDING MATERIAL FROM GOLDFISH CD-ROM
---------------------------------------

Except for a small amount of material that the authors have explicitly
requested not be included on the Goldfish CD-ROM, everything from the
floppy library will be included.  If you are the author of material
that you wish to have excluded from the CD-ROM, and have not already
advised me of your wishes, please let me know as soon as possible, and
at least by March 15, 1994.  You can send email to me at
'fnf@cygnus.com', 'fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com', or call/FAX (602)
917-0917.

Requesting to have your material excluded does not disqualify you from
receiving your free CD-ROM, however you should note that since this
CD-ROM may become the official source base from which many people
recreate floppies for distribution, it is likely your material may be
disappear from some branches of the floppy distribution as well.
