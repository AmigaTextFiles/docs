-----------------
PREVIOUS CD-ROM's
-----------------

I still have a limited quantity (15) of the Oct-93 FreshFish CD-ROM's
available, plus a very limited quantity (10) of the Hypermedia Version 1.7
CD-ROM's (floppy disks 1-900).  These disks are available on a first-come
first-served basis for $19.95 plus shipping and handling.  At this time,
the Dec-93 FreshFish CD-ROM's are sold out.

-----------------
FRESHFISH CD-ROM's
-----------------

As I write this, the third FreshFish CD-ROM (March/April 1994) is going
into production and should start shipping about March 12th.  I decided to
start doing like magazines do, and name the CD-ROM for the period over
which it is expected to be current, rather than the period over which it
was created.  It was delayed about a week due to my switching mastering
software and the need to test the resulting disk with several different
CD-ROM drivers.  The next FreshFish CD-ROM will be the May/June issue, and
is expected to be available in the first couple weeks of May.

-------------------
FROZENFISH CD-ROM's
-------------------

The "quarterly" CD-ROM's have been officially named the "FrozenFish"
CD-ROM's, both to give them a more interesting name and to remove the
implication that there will be four issues per year.  The current plan is
to issue FrozenFish CD-ROM's after every third or forth FreshFish CD-ROM.
Given the current production schedule of FreshFish CD-ROM's, that would
mean a new FrozenFish CD-ROM about every 6-8 months.

Work is now proceeding on the first FrozenFish CD-ROM, and it is expected
to be ready for distribution during the last half of March.  It will
contain at least all the new material off of the previous three FreshFish
CD-ROM's, as well as possibly some of the other material off the FreshFish
CD-ROM's, all in archived form.  This will still leave a considerable
amount of free space on the CD-ROM, which I plan to fill with material from
the floppy library (in archived form), working backwards from the most
recently released floppy disk.  It is very likely that I will be able to
include the entire contents of disks 1-975, but I won't know until fairly
late in the construction process.

-----------------
GOLDFISH CD-ROM's
-----------------

What was previously referred to as the 1000 disk archive CD-ROM is now
officially named the "GoldFish" CD-ROM.  This will actually be a two CD
set, in a single slimline jewel case, and will contain the entire contents
of the 1000 disk floppy library in both archived (BBS ready) and unarchived
form.  The first CD will contain disks 1-750 in unarchived form and the
second CD will contain disks 751-1000 in unarchived form as well as disks
1-1000 in archived form.

The GoldFish CD-ROM will contain a program that makes it simple to create
master floppy disks directly off the CD-ROM, for further duplication and
distribution.  It will also have more direct support for BBS systems than
has been previously included on the Fresh Fish CD-ROM's (files.bbs files
for example).

We are now in the process of creating the last 25 floppy disks (976-1000),
and should be ready to start finalizing the GoldFish CD-ROM about the end
of March.  It is expected to be ready for distribution during the first
half of April.

---------------------------
FUTURE FLOPPY DISK RELEASES
---------------------------

Once I reach disk 1000, I will no longer continue to produce a floppy disk
based distribution.  When I first announced this several months ago, a
number of organizations and individuals inquired about taking over this job
and continuing the library past disk 1000, with my "official blessing".  I
have selected Amazing Computing (PIM Publications) for this job, based on
their longtime commitment to the Amiga.

The conditions of continuing to keep my endorsement as the official
continuation of the floppy based library include adherence to my standards
for quality, production values (look and feel), and free redistribution of
the resulting work.  The plan is that they will select the best bits and
pieces off each FreshFish CD-ROM, and organize new floppy releases using
this material.  They may of course, decide to incorporate material from
other sources as well.

------------------
PRODUCT-INFO FILES
------------------

Material included in future CD-ROM distributions will be accompanied by a
file that contains information about the material, for various database
programs or other tools to use to index specific types of material, find
specific programs, etc.  This file, currently called a "Product-Info" file,
contains important information like the program name, version number,
author information, short and long descriptions, etc.  A specification
exists (included on the March/April FreshFish CD-ROM in the Information
directory) which authors can follow to generate appropriate Product-Info
files for previously released material or future releases.

Most of the work I will be doing for the FrozenFish and GoldFish CD-ROM's
involves generating these Product-Info files so they can be used to build
description files for BBS systems, databases for indexing tools included on
the CD-ROM, etc.  Currently I have a file tree containing more than 7000
Product-Info files that cover all 975 disks in the floppy library and much
of the material on the previous three FreshFish CD-ROM's.  Less than 10% of
these were generated manually, the bulk of them were generated by
mechanical translation of existing Contents files.

Since manually generating accurate Product-Info files for previous releases
is a massive effort, I am calling on all authors and other interested
parties for help.  Ideally, the author of specific material should submit
updated Product-Info files, but anyone is free to do so.  The tree of all
current Product-Info files is periodically uploaded to aminet systems, in
the fish/docs directory, under names like pifiles-MMDD.lha, so these can be
used as a starting point.  The archive also contains the latest
Product-Info file specification.

---------------------------
ISO-9660 MASTERING SOFTWARE
---------------------------

For the March/April FreshFish CD-ROM, I switched mastering software.  I am
now using an enhanced version of mkisofs, which was written by Eric
Youngdale, and enhanced by Frank Munkert to make it suitable for generating
the "Amiga flavor" of ISO-9660.  This software is covered by the GPL (GNU
General Public License) and once a few more enhancements are made, myself
or Frank will be working to get the changes folded back into the version
maintained by Eric.  In any case, the package will be available for anyone
to use.  Hopefully someone with detailed knowledge of Amiga Intuition
programming will write a graphical user interface for it, thus making it
even easier to use.

-----------------
CDTV/CD32 BOOTING
-----------------

One of the current side effects of switching to different mastering
software is that support for directly booting the CD-ROM's on the CDTV/CD32
has been suspended.  Because of the relatively high license fees that
needed to be paid to Commodore for each CD-ROM sold (more than the cost of
actually pressing the CD-ROM), and the relatively small numbers of users
that currently actually make use of this feature, I have decided to produce
royalty free CD-ROM's for the moment.  The money previously spent on these
fees can be put to better use to improve the CD-ROM distributions for the
vast majority of current users that don't care about CDTV or CD32
bootability.

This does not mean that the CD-ROM's cannot be used on a CDTV or CD32, just
that users that wish to use them must acquire additional hardware.  In the
case of the CDTV, all that is required is a floppy disk drive to boot from,
and a suitable bootable Work bench disk.  In the case of the CD32, an
additional requirement is an expansion box that provides a floppy disk
port.  Such expansion boxes are currently under development by a number of
different companies and/or already available in certain markets.

It is possible that when demand warrants it, I may do special versions of
the CD-ROM's that are CDTV/CD32 bootable, or else produce CD-ROM's that are
targeted directly for CDTV/CD32 users with considerably different content
than current CD-ROM's.  So these moves do not mean I am abandoning
CDTV/CD32 users, or ignoring their needs, just that I am attempting to make
the best use of available resources, and the payment of license fees on
every CD-ROM was not judged to be cost effective at this time.
