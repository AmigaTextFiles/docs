TITLE

    "LhA V1.38" - An LZH/LHA archiver for the Commodore Amiga Computer
    -- Unregistered evaluation version.

VERSION DATE

    September 1st, 1992

AUTHOR

    Stefan Boberg  /  LhA Development      (boberg@lysator.liu.se)

DESCRIPTION

    LhA is a CLI/Shell controlled archiver program for the Commodore Amiga
computer series. It handles archives with names ending in `.LZH', `.LHA',
and `.RUN'. It is compatible with UNIX LHa V1.00, MS-DOS LHA V2.13, Amiga
Lharc V1.30 and LZ V1.92. LhA is commonly used to pack/unpack files from
various networks and for transferring files over modem, but can also be
used as a HD backup program.

NEW FEATURES

    This is primarily a bug-fix release for V1.32e, but it also contains
some new features. Nothing spectacular, but here's some of them:

  - Quick-add mode. When in this mode LhA will add files to existing
    archives considerably faster than normal.

  - `y' command to recreate archives with new options (change header
    level, remove pathnames etc.) without having to extract and re-arc
    all files.

  - `h' command compares an archive's contents with a device/directory
    and reports any differences.

  - `c' command concatenates several archives into one.

  - Enables the WILDSTAR flag when run under Release 2. Previously the
    `*' pattern character would not work unless a program such as
    `StarBurst' was used. Some believed this was a bug in LhA, but the
    problem is that AmigaDOS disables the `*' token by default.

BUGS FIXED

  Several bugs and misfeatures have been corrected. Notably the annoying
system-requester bug has been fixed.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  LhA requires 512K or more RAM and at least KickStart 1.2

AVAILABILITY

   LhA V1.38 is available now for anonymous FTP from:

     lysator.liu.se (Sweden) :
                /pub/amiga/LhA/LhA_e138.run

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    This evaluation package is freely distributable, provided it is kept
intact. If you continue to use the program after the evaluation period
you are expected to register (the program is ShareWare).
