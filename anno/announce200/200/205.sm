                              ScreenManager

                         by Bernhard Moellemann

           An utility to deal with public screens under AmigaOS2.0

                  Version V1.13, the first public release


ScreenManager (SM) is a small CLI utility used to open, close or modify
public screens and retrieve information about them. Screens can be opened
with userselectable colors and DrawInfo's (they determine which color is
used for highlighting). The resolution is also selectable on a wide range.

On the other hand SM can also be used to make a certain screen the system's
default screen, or to change the screen modes of other public screens.
Finally, it is possible to view a list of all currently open screens in the
system and to get informed about resolution and other properties of screens.


As Public Screens are only available in release 2 (and above) of
AmigaOS, you need at least that version to run ScreenManager.


ScreenManager is available as sm.lzh on the public-ftp-server:
