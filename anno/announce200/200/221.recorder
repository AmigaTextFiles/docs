TITLE

	Fighter Duel Pro Flight Recorder


VERSION DATE

	November 1991


DESCRIPTION

	Fighter Duel Pro Flight Recorder is the first interactive motion path 
	generator.  Flight Recorder retains all the breakthrough features of 
	the Fighter Duel World War II flight simulator series, while adding the
	ability to create realistic and complex object motion paths for use in
	NewTek's Lightwave 3D software.

	One of the most difficult and time consuming aspects of 3D animation is
	motion.  FDPro Flight Recorder replaces the tedious methoud of hand
	plotting flying motion paths with a flight simulator you control.
	Flight Recorder records the flight path of up to three (3) aircraft
	engaged in maneuvers or dogfighting.  Positional information has a
	resolution of 30 frames per second.  Motion paths may then be imported
	into Lightwave 3D to accurately animate flying objects, the camera
	viewpoint, aircraft, spacecraft, flying logos, etc.......

	You may fly solo against computer controlled opponents or interactively
	with another person via modem or null modem cable.

	FDPro Flight Recorder also has the ability to simultaneously generate
	Fighter Duel Pro Demo Reels that can be used to review your solo flights


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	FDPro Flight Recorder will run on any Amiga with 3 megs of RAM and 
	Kickstart 1.2 or higher.  A hard drive is recommended.
