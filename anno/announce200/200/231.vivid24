Vivid 24

DMI's 24-bit Color Graphics Co-Processor
The "Vivid 24" is a super high resolution graphics rendering engine designed
for the Commodore Amiga A3000 series of computers. Capable of calculating
and rendering 100,000 Gouraud shaded polygons per second, DMI's newest
graphics controller can display 24-bit color images at resolutions up to
2048 x 2048.

Features

- 100,000 Shaded Polygons Per Second
- 160 MFLOPS
- 24-bit Color Graphics
- 8-bit Alpha Channel
- 2048 x 2048 Interlaced Resolution
- 1280 x 1024 Non-interlaced resolution
- 40 MHz TMS34020 Graphics Processor
- 4 Graphics Math Co-processors
- Broadcast Quality Video Encoder
- 16 MB Video Memory
- 8 MB Program Memory
- User Programmable Resolution
 
Modular Design

Single Graphics Math Co-processors, Double Graphics Math Co-processors,
Video Memory, Broadcast Quality Digital Video Encoder, Video Effects
Generator, Program Memory.

The "Vivid 24"'s modular approach gives users the ability and versatility to
add features and power according to their needs and as their system
requirements grow.  The completely modular design also allows DMI's
engineers to incorporate the very latest in chip technology.

Single Graphics Math Co-processor Upgrade Kit - Adds 40 MFLOPS (Million
Floating-point Operations Per Second) and 25,000 shaded polygons per second.
Add two "Single" Kits for 80 MFLOPS and 50,000 shaded polygons per second.

Double Graphics Math Co-processor Upgrade Kit - The "Double Kit" adds an
additional 80 MFLOPS and 50,000 shaded polygons per second.  The "Double"
kit and two "Single" kits yield a total of 160 MFLOPS and 100,000 shaded
polygons per second.

Video Memory Upgrade Kit - The "Vivid 24"'s standard configuration includes
one 4 MB Video Memory Module providing 24-bit color display in
Non-interlaced resolutions up to 1024 x 1024.  Add up to three additional
Video Memory Modules for a total of 16 MB of VRAM and 24-bit color display
in resolutions up to an incredible 2048 x 2048.  The Video Memory can also
be used as system memory by your Amiga.

Broadcast Quality Digital Video Encoder - Allows super high resolution
graphics to be taken directly to video tape retaining their broadcast
quality.  The "Encoder" module supports NTSC or PAL and SVHS. Genlocks the
"Vivid 24" using either a sync generator or any external video source.  The
Module plugs into the same location as a Video Memory Module.

Video Effects Generator - Provides an input for two video sources and allows
for special effects and switching on both a pixel by pixel basis between the
video sources and the "Vivid 24" computer generated graphics.
 
Program Memory Upgrade - The "Vivid 24" comes with 4MB of program  memory
which allows your application to run directly on the board at incredible
speeds.  The Program Memory Upgrade provides for an additional 4 MB of DRAM
(for a total of 8MB) for specific applications requiring more than 4MB. 

Software

DMI-Workbench - Allows you to display a super
high-resolution Amiga Workbench on the DMI "Vivid 24"
board. Completely compatible with ALL Amiga
applications.
DMI-Paint - Full-featured 24-bit paint package that
contains all the standard tools including: multisize
airbrush, cut and paste, multiple brush sizes, zoom,
undo, and much more all in the DMI super
high-resolutions.
DMI-Render - Imports models and frames from industry
standard 3D packages and renders images in near
real-time using either Gouraud or Phong shading.
DMI-Tweek - Allows you to configure and control the fully
programmable resolution output of the "Vivid 24"
graphic board.
SAGE - Standard Amiga Graphics Environment
TMS340 Graphics Library - TIGA for the Amiga
