TITLE

    Perl

VERSION

     Perl version: 4.035  Amiga port version: 0.1.0


DESCRIPTION

    This is a port of the perl programming language by Larry Wall
    to the Amiga series of personal computers.

    For those of you who may not be familiar with perl, it is a
    programming language that has become very popular among users
    of the Unix operating system.  The language is very useful
    for the manipulation of text, files, and processes and the
    syntax is very C-like.  Perl is interpreted, which can be
    very convenient when developing small utilities and one-shot
    scripts.


REQUIREMENTS

      o  Amiga OS 2.04 or higher is absolutely required!  Do not
         send e-mail asking about 1.3 and below support.  Any such
         requests will be silently ignored.

      o  An absolute minimum of 1Mb of memory is required to use
         perl.  At least 3Mb is recommended for executing non-trivial
         scripts along with background processes and spawned processes.
	 In general, the more RAM you have, the better.

      o  A hard disk is strongly recommended.  Perl will probably
         be pretty worthless without one.

      o  A complete GCC 2.2.2 installation is recommended (but not required).
         It comes with a lot of the support stuff needed by perl (making
         perl easier to install) (ixpipe, ixemul, etc) and you can
         use it to hack the source (see 'Hacking' section of the Amiga guide
         in the distribution)!
