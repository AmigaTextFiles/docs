Disks 691-700 are now available.  Shipment to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by Sunday (7/19)

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

	Fred Fish
	Catalog Disk Requests
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, Arizona  85284
	USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other
	sort of proprietary material included, since I then
	have to go examine each file to decide if it is
	distributable or not, and if not, what effect removing
	it might have.

2.	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my
	disks.  I.E, place all files related to a particular
	submission under a single directory on the disk.  If
	there is more than one submission per disk, it's ok to
	to place each submission in it's own directory.

3.	Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing
	that summarizes your submission.  It should be about
	3-10 lines, and include the current version number,
	the version and disk number of the most recent version
	(if any) that was last included in the library, whether
	or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from
	it's subdirectory and if necessary, supply a script
	runnable from workbench (via :c/xicon) that makes all
	necessary assigns, copies fonts and libraries, etc.

5.	Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient
	padding.

Thanks!!!

CONTENTS OF DISK 691
--------------------

CManual		Disk 1 of a 5 disk distribution of one of the largest collect-
		ions of documents, examples, and utilities in C for the Amiga.
		It consists of six manuals, with more than 40 chapters, 175
		fully executable examples complete with source code, and sev-
		eral utilities and other goodies.  The manuals describe how
		to open and work with Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets,
		Requesters, Alerts, Menus, IDCMP, Sprites, VSprites, AmigaDOS,
		Low Level Graphics Routines, etc.  They also explain how to
		use your C Compiler and give you important information about
		how the Amiga works and how your programs should be designed.
		When unpacked, the manuals and examples nearly fill up twelve
		standard Amiga floppies.  This is version 3.0, an update to
		version 2.0 on disks 456 and 457.  Because of its size, it is
		distributed on five library disks, 691 through 695.

		but no clues.  The object is to find a way to place all the
		words back into the puzzle.  Options include 10, 20, or 30
		word games with one or two players.  Version 1.0, binary only.

		the DOS library.  This program will simulate the Trashcan
		function provided by Workbench.  Support programs provided
		to allow automatic purging of Kan directory from startup
		sequence.  Compatible with 1.3, 2.0 and Amiga 3000.  Version

PgmToShd	Takes a standard PGM format graphics image and creates from it
		a PPM image containing information to view black and white
		images in 151 shades of gray instead of the Amiga's standard
		16.  It uses the monochrome composite video output jack avail-
		able on the Amiga 500 and 2000, so provided you have one of
		these computers and a monitor capable of receiving its input
		through composite video, no modifications are required to the
		Amiga.  The PBMPlus library of graphics manipulation routines
		is required to make use of this program, as well as a standard
		IFF viewer such as Mostra.  A sample test image is included.
		This is version 1.0, binary only.
