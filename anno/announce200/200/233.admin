Some administrative notes about my last show report:

David Masterson (cimshop!prometheus!davidm@uunet.UU.NET)
has pointed out that the address of Comeau Computing
(who make a C++ front end that works with SAS C 6.0) is as follows:

Comeau Computing
91-34 120th St.
Richmond Hill, NY 11418
718-945-0009

(Thanks, David!)

Also, Doug Walker (walker@unx.sas.com) pointed out that he was the
"someone" at the SAS booth who knew that Comeau C++ works with the
latest version of SAS C.
