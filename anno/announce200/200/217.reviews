Subject: New moderator for comp.sys.amiga.reviews
Status: R


	No, comp.sys.amiga.reviews is not "dead."  Just "resting."

	Jason Tibbitts, the moderator of comp.sys.amiga.reviews, has
unfortunately become too swamped with work to continue devoting his time to
the newsgroup.  And so, effective immediately, I'll be taking over Jason's
duties as the moderator.  Personally, I'd like to give a big THANK YOU to
Jason for his volunteer efforts over the years, and I'm sorry that he didn't
have the time to continue.  But I'm looking forward to handling the work and
soliciting your reviews.

{NOTE:  The newsgroup will stay "resting" until approximately September 20,
because I am studying for my Ph.D. comprehensive exams.  YOU CAN STILL SEND
IN REVIEWS, but they won't be posted until September 20 or so.  Also, all
reviews that were sent to Jason but not posted yet WILL be posted.  However,
if you want, you can re-submit your review just to be sure.}

	If you have used an Amiga software or hardware product that you have
enjoyed or disliked, you can submit a review to the same addresses as always:

	Submissions go to:           amiga-reviews-submissions@math.uh.edu
	Requests go to:              amiga-reviews-requests@math.uh.edu
	General correspondence to:   amiga-reviews@math.uh.edu

	You can review Amiga application programs, games, expansion
products, data disks, CDTV discs, books, or whatever...  let's hear what you
have to say!  It doesn't matter whether the product is commercial or
freeware, new or old, general or specialized.  It also doesn't matter if the
product has been reviewed before; different people have different opinions.

	Reviews don't have to be long.  In fact, there are three "official"
kinds of reviews that I'd like to encourage:

(1)	The "mini review"

		Write down 1 or 2 organized paragraphs about the product,
		describing it briefly and saying what you like and don't
		like.

(2)	The "full review"

		Just like in the magazines, only better... because YOU
		did it!

		I will be supplying review "templates" (blank forms) that
		people can use if they need help in organizing a review.
		They are not required.

(3)	The "survey"	[This is a new category.]

		If you posted a question to USENET about a product, and you
		got lots of responses, then summarize your responses neatly
		and send them in.  It is best if you organize the
		information -- by making tables, separating the responses
		into categories, etc. -- and add your own comments.  If you
		just lump all the responses together and send them in, your
		survey might not be interesting to read.

		If you want to see an example of a survey article, send mail
		to amiga-reviews-requests@math.uh.edu.

	Like Jason did, I'll post submission guidelines and information
every month in the newsgroup.  Reviews will continue to be archived and
available by request.

                                                        Dan

	fjords" will be shot. :-)
