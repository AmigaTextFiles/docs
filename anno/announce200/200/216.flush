Subject: FLUSH Library - A library to announce low memory events.
Status: RO

Hi. This is an official "package" announcement. Hope you will be able to
post it.

Thanks in advance.

Bye Ms...

------- cut here.

TITLE
    FLUSH Library

VERSION
    1.1new

AUTHORS
    General concept and implementation: Marc SCHAEFER,	sysop@alphanet.ch
    C support examples: 		Michel SCHINZ,	mschinz@alphanet.ch
    Fine tuning:			Yves PERRENOUD, pyves@alphanet.ch
    Maintainer is flush@alphanet.ch.

DESCRIPTION
    The flush library package is a shared runtime library which allows
    applications to be informed when a low memory event (a "flush" event)
    occurs.

    Applications first "subscribe" to a flush event, and choose how they
    want to be informed of the flush event. It is possible to be signalled,
    or to receive a reply to a message, or to be directly called as a function.
    Each of the methods have their advantages and drawbacks, and it's up to the
    programmer to decide.

    The network distribution consists of documentation, include files for both
    assembly language and C. It does not include the library source itself in
    order not to confuse people. [available on request if really needed.]

NEW FEATURES
    First announcement.
    The "new" keyword is because the package now contains C-language
    examples and support 1.1 didn't contain.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    None.

HOST NAME
    liasun3.epfl.ch
    Note: Currently ONLY available from 01h00 GMT+2 to 08h00 GMT+2
    (23h00 to 06h00 UTC).

DIRECTORY
    /pub2/amiga/alphanet/pd/

FILE NAME
    flush1_1new.lha

DISTRIBUTABILITY
    Freely redistributable (library source is not included). Not allowed to
    modify the archive in any way. Not shareware. Not crippled. Useful ?

OTHER
    Warning to users:
     Since there is to our knowledge no (publically) available program
     which uses the library, it is totally useless for users !

    This announcement is only for application writers.
