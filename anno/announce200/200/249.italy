'Planetario Comunale' will be held IPISA '92, a meeting among italian
Amiga programmers. There will be famous italian Amiga programmers
illustrating their new programs & utilities.

This meeting is also an excellent business occasion for talented Amiga

appreciated point of the last IPISA edition.

The structure of the meeting is the same as the last year, with
roundtables and single speakers.
On request, highly interesting topics could be discussed and included
in the official IPISA acts.
