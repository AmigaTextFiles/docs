DESCRIPTION
 
  ADT  is  to ftp what elm is to mail.  It lets you select files using the
  cursor  keys  and  download  them  by simply pressing 'd'.  You can sort
  files,  find  files, and do many other convenient things.  It has online
  help  where  not  self-explaining.  It only works with Aminet FTP sites;
  these  are  the sites around amiga.physik.unizh.ch, they're listed right

  contact me if you meet problems.
