DESCRIPTION
 
  XPK is an interfacing standard between application programs and packer 
  libraries. Every XPK application program can pack data with any XPK
  packer.
  There are already some applications in this archive: A (de)compressing 
  filesystem, a packing app-icon, command line packers, a LoadSeg() patch, 
  an adapted image displayer, a movie player, plus many more. All these
  can thus handle compressed data.
  Four packers are included in this package, plus two very safe encryptor
  and various demo or special purpose XPK libraries.
 
  
FILE NAMES
 
  xpk24usr.lha    -  User's package, contents see above
  xpk24dev.lha    -  Developer's package, for writing apps and libs
