TITLE
	Some GNU Unix utilities

VERSION
	v1.6 of GNU grep
	v3.3 of GNU fileutils
	v1.3 of GNU textutils

AUTHOR
	Various
	Amiga port by David Gay

DESCRIPTION

While working on emacs, I ported several Unix utilities to provide
programs which are called by emacs (eg, ls is used by dired, rmdir is
used by the delete-file command). I am now releasing these, along with
the unix compatibility library which I wrote to assist porting these
various utilities (and emacs).

Ports of the following software (written or distributed as part of
the GNU project) are available for download:

- grep (version 1.6). The standard unix utility of the same name.
- textutils (version 1.3). A dozen odd standard unix utilities
for handling text, like sort, cat, head, etc.
- fileutils (version 3.3). A set of standard unix utilities
for managing files, like ls, rm, chmod, etc.

The unix compatibility library, which is written for SAS C 5.10b,
provides a more unix-like environment for programs compiled with it,
along with a number of C functions which I needed to compile the
above programs. These are either new or replacements for similar
functions in the SAS C library (where these functions lacked
some features or were buggy).
