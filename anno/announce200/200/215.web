TITLE

    "The Web" Data Acquisition and Processing Environment
    -- Demonstration Edition.


VERSION DATE

    July 1992


DESCRIPTION

    "The Web" is a an interactive, graphic-diagram based, environment
    designed (at least initially) for Data Acquisition and Processing of
    almost any kind. This Demonstration Edition has a restricted set of
    data-handling modules, and cannot save things to disk, but is otherwise
    full-featured.

    Modules with specific data-collection or filtering functions can be
    "plugged together" by placing icons in a diagram and linking them in
    the desired configuration.  More than one separate `web' may be in
    action at a time if desired -- full advantage is taken of the Amiga's
    multitasking, and the system is designed for speed.

    Modules can be written to handle almost any kind of data. For this
    demo, the "Data Sources" are random wave generators (although a file
    reader and some recorded actual data files are also supplied), and
    the "Filters" comprise display scopes and various manipulations like
    scaling, gating, and FFTs.

    (Note that though the current system is tailored to a scientific
    application -- namely the analysis of acoustic data -- the graphic
    management scheme and the underlying principles should be easily
    adaptable to other things.  It would be at home almost any place
    where you want to pass data -- arrays, text, MIDI, images, what have
    you -- around between modules to perform operations on it.  Let us
    know where you'd like to see it applied!)


NEW FEATURES

    This release supersedes an ealier version of the package that was
    posted a few months back to amiga.physik.unizh.ch.  Aside from the
    modules and their usage being improved, this version permits much
    more flexible configurations (multiple inputs to an element and so on).
    New example configurations (and real data!) have been included.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    The Web needs the 2.04 or later operating system.  It should run in a
    1MB machine.  It shows off its capabilities best on a 68030 system with
    floating point accelerator, but does not need either of these.  Likewise
    a hard disk is preferable but not necessary (the current system fits
    easily on a floppy -- about 1/2 MB).


AUTHORS

    Peter Goodeve and David Navas
    (based on an idea and additional script by Kent Polk)


AVAILABILITY

    The Web demo is available for ftp from:

        wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) (USA) as:
                /systems/amiga/science/general/web_demo.lzh

        amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80) (Switzerland) as:
                /amiga/cdemos/web_demo.lzh  (eventually)
                (temporarily /amiga/new/web_demo.lzh)

    You will find a short description (web_demo.readme) in the same
    directory on each system.

    It should also eventually be accessible on the various mirrors for
    these systems.  Check there if overcrowding on physik causes it to
    be deleted.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

    This demonstration edition package is freely distributable,
    provided it is kept intact.  The full version is licensable for
    a fee to be negotiated depending on the amount of customization
    needed.
