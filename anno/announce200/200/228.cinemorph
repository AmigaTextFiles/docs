I, along with my partner Tom Krehbiel, developed the software.  GVP is 
marketing it and is the contact point.  The text for the online release,

                CINEMORPH DEBUTS AT PASEDENA WOC
 
   KING OF PRUSSIA, PA - September, 1992.  In a surprise move, GVP has 
released a previously unannounced morphing package.  Called CineMorph, 
this impressive software system brings the features of a high-end 
commercial morphing system to the Amiga, giving any user the ability to 
warp single images, morph between two or more images, and even create 
sequences of full motion morphs.
 
   CineMorph features include exceptionally fast rendering that can be 
fully automated to save you time.  You can preview results within 
CineMorph or render directly to Amiga formats, HAM-E, DCTV and 
24-bit IFF with controls provided directly in CineMorph.  The system 
also supports full 24-bit output for professional needs on framebuffers 
such as the IV24.
 
   Using the industry standard dual window interface, CineMorph takes 
this one step further by making these windows fully intuition based to 
allow images to be shown and morphed in their correct aspect ratio.  
These same windows can also be enlarged for precise editing.  CineMorph 
follows Amiga style conventions in all areas and uses logical and easy 
to understand controls for it's entire operation.
 
   Computer and video artists will appreciate the many professional 
capabilities of CineMorph.  Some of these features include the ability 
to warp images for comic effect, merge similar scenes for film or video 
to eliminate bad edits, and create full motion morph sequences for 
cinematic or video effects using CineMorph's unmatched controls for 
automating the creation of full motion sequences.  Abilities not found 
in any other Amiga-based morphing software!
 
   "CineMorph is boon to anyone who uses the Amiga for video 
applications," says Lawrence Ough, Product Manager for the new product. 
"And it's suggested retail price of $149.00 will put sophisticated 
morphing capabilities within everyone's reach."
 
   CineMorph represents the state of the art in morphing software on the 
Amiga.  It's currently being used by high profile companies in several 
productions in Hollywood, New York and Florida, as well as many other 
companies for their advertising, multimedia, and commercial works.
