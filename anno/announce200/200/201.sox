TITLE

	Amiga SOX - multi-format sound converter

VERSION

	Amiga release 2.0, after public release 5

AUTHOR

	Lance Norskog and Sundry Contributors
	Amiga port by David Champion

DESCRIPTION

	SOX converts *between* any two of 8SVX, AIFF, HCOM, ulaw, VOC,
	WAV, and raw (signed/unsigned, byte/word/longword) sound
	formats.  You should be able to convert *any* sound file to a
	format readable by *any* Amiga application, and vice versa.

	SOX can also perform any of various effects on a sound file,
	including echo, vibrato, rate change (resample), volume
	change, filter (low-pass, band-pass), and a minimal
	statistical analysis.

	The Amiga version includes FPU (68881/2 math coprocessor) and
	non-FPU versions to peform mathematically intensive effects
	more quickly, and a set of scripts for the Amiga Shell and for
	U. Dominik Mueller's csh which perform many of the most common
	conversions without the full command line.

NEW FEATURES

	amisox 2.0 is a direct port of the new public release 5 of
	Unix SOX.  There are no new features in the Amiga version over
	amisox+wav, distributed to the Internet a few weeks ago, but
	some features are now standard to the regular distribution.

	Some bugs have been fixed in some of the conversions and
	effects.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	None.
	Math coprocessor version is included for those so fortunate.
