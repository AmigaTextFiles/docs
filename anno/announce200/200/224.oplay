TITLE
	OmniPlay - A multi-format sound player for AmigaDOS

VERSION
	0.98, 3-Sept-92

DESCRIPTION
	OmniPlay plays samples sounds from a variety of sound file
	formats, including IFF (8svx and aiff), WAV, VOC, .au, .snd,
	and 8-bit raw (signed, unsigned, u-law).  In addition,
	PowerPacked sounds can be played if you have v34+ of
	powerpacker.library installed.

	OmniPlay determines the type of sound it's dealing with
	automagically,  so the minimum command is "oplay somesound".
	This works on *any* file, although raw files might sound
	better if you specify a rate.

	Options control rate, volume, output audio channel, wait-time
	between sounds, process priority, printing of sound properties
	(such as IFF NAME, AUTH, etc.), and more.  Options are
	sequenced, not pre-scanned, so two files can have different
	option sets.

REQUIREMENTS
	A sampled sound file.  If you wish to PowerPack sounds, you
	should have powerpacker.library (not included) in your libs:
	directory.
