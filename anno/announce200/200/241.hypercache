NAME
        HyperCache Professional

DESCRIPTION

        HyperCache is a media caching system for the Amiga series of
        personal computers.  It uses an intelligent caching system to
        bring the filesystem performance up to workstation levels, and
        far exceeds the capabilities of the standard system, Addbuffers.
        While any Amiga user can benefit, the greatest performance gains
        are realized in situtations where storage devices are important,
        such as compiler operation, database manipulation, manipulating
        large word-processng files, etc.  

FEATURES

        - Works with any AmigaDOS compatible storage device, including
          but not limited to:
                SCSI Hard Drives
                IDE Hard Drive (AT and XT style)
                ST-506 Hard Drives
                Trackdisk-based floppies
                CD-ROM drives (CDTV included!)
                SCSI Tape Backup Units

        - HyperCache employs a pre-fetch technique that intelligently
          reads data BEFORE IT IS REQUESTED.  In this way, even first
          time reads that are not in the cache are accelerated.

        - Any number of devices, and any number of units per device (up
          to available memory) may be cached.  Drives may be spread 
          across multiple devices (SCSI, IDE, and Trackdisk caches
          resident in the same machine simultaneously).

        - Works with any filesystem, independant of device geometry.  
          Alternate systems, such as MessyDOS and most CD-ROM filesystems
          are supported.

        - User-configurable cache parameters.  The cache is maintained as
          an n-way associative line cache, where the number of lines, line
          size, prefetch size, and overall cache size are configurable 
          independantly for each device being cached.  Automatic 
          configuration is also supplied for the novice user.

REQUIREMENTS

		  - Kickstart 1.2 or higher (fully compatible and tested with 2.X)
		  - 1M RAM recommended (and it screams with 32 bit RAM!)
		  - Floppy, Hard Disk, CD-ROM, and Tape supported
