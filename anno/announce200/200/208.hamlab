TITLE

HAMLAB PLUS (DEMO)

VERSION

2.0.6, a major upgrade to HamLab 1.1, and the first public "PLUS" release

DESCRIPTION

HAMLAB PLUS is an image format conversion utility.  It can read
bit-mapped images in many formats, perform some basic operations on
them, reduce them to a native Amiga display mode, and save them in
Amiga IFF format.  It is intended mainly to read images with more
colors and higher resolution than are displayable on Amigas (JPEG
files and 256 color GIFs, for example) and to reduce the number of
colors in the image until the Amiga can display it, preserving
as much of the original image's quality as possible.

FEATURES

Reads:
	GIF, IFF, HAM-E, TIFF, JPEG, BMP, Targa, PBMPLUS, MTV,
	Spectrum 512, QRT, DKBTrace, Sun Rasterfiles

Writes:
	IFF lo-res 1-5 bit planes, halfbrite, HAM, hi-res 1-4 bit planes
	PCHG (multi-palette), SHAM, and Dynamic versions of all modes
	24-bit IFF
	PostScript (color or gray)

Many options:
	Color control (brightness, contrast, gamma, custom curves)
	Cropping 
	Scaling (10% to 1000% of original size)
	Dithering (6 types)
	
Flexible configuration - can run in 1 meg

Point-and-click user interface with AmigaOS Release 2 look and feel
(still runs under 1.3)

Powerful AREXX command set

Simple command line batch mode

COMPATIBILITY

AmigaOS 1.3 and 2.04 (ARP recommended for 1.3)
Runs in 1 meg -- can be configured to use additional memory and disk space.
