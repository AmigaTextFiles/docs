Soft-Logik Publishing Announces:

HotLinks Editions Version 1.1 Upgrade

PageLiner 1.1 has many new features, including an all-new Settings menu
to make it easier to set your preferences. You can even load and save 
settings. The new Font command allows you to specify fonts and type sizes.
(PageLiner now reads your PageStream fontlist!) You can program the 
function keys to switch fonts, sizes and tags, or to enter text strings.
PageLiner 1.1 is the ultimate text entry program to use with PageStream
2.21. (You will receive a 2.21 patch with your order.)

HotLinks >> We've taken many of the suggestions users have sent us to
create HotLinks 1.1. The new version has totally redesigned requesters 
which provide more edition information and are easier to use. The Publish
and Information requesters use popup menus to switch between blocks of
information. Like all the programs in this package, HotLinks follows the
latest Amiga interface guidelines and is compatible with WorkBench 3.0.
All three programs are now Locale compatible for better international
language support.

BME trace. BME 1.1 is an amazing upgrade to this indispensable bitmap 
editor. You can now load TIFF pictures in addition to IFF and GIF. But 
the biggest change is the addition of a single menu command: Trace. BME 
now has a built-in autotracer which converts selected areas of bitmap
pictures into structured drawings. With numerous options, you have total
control over the trace process. Save your traced drawings in IFF DR2D 
format for use with PageStream and other programs.

Compatability

Using HotLinks just got better. New Horizons has added HotLinks support to
ProWrite 3.3 and Black Belt has incorporated it into ImageMaster. More 
great HotLinks programs are on the way.

Upgrade to HotLinks Editions 1.1 now for only $35 US plus $5 shipping and 
handling ($15 shipping and handling outside the USA and Canada.) Mail
orders to Soft-Logik Publishing Corporation, P. O. Box 510589,
St. Louis, MO 63151-0589, USA or call 1-800-829-8608 (314-894-8608). Visa
and MasterCard are accepted.
