     --------------- A Brief Summary of GPFax for the Amiga    -------------

     GPFax has been designed as the Fax Solution for Amigas. It supports
     the TR 29 class 2 draft specifications for FAX modems. A version is
     also available for Class 1 modems (Rockwell AT224ATF chipset).
     Supported modems include the Supra, Maestro, Interlink and many
     others.  (Generally any modem using Rockwell or XR chipsets)

     GPFax is a full send and receive FAX package providing the user with
     more options than available on most fax machines.

     The software incorporates:

     * GPFax runs on any Amiga, PAL or NTSC, under any Amiga OS from 1.3 or
     later including WB2.xx.  1Mb required and hard disk drive strongly
     preferred. Operates with a full intuition interface either fully mouse
     and/or keyboard driven requiring NO external libraries or other
     software.

     * Automatic or manual reception of faxes with time, date and sender ID
     saving.  A full transaction log is kept which allows easy access to
     sent or received faxes and can be printed from within the software.

     * Multiple faxes may be sent to multiple numbers with auto generation
     of individual cover pages and fax header stamps.  Faxes may be sent
     immediately or scheduled for unattended transmission at a later time.

     * Received faxes can be viewed as a 1:1 image, or scaled 1:2, 1:4 or
     inverted for full width viewing. Faxes may be printed on standard
     Amiga printer or saved as black and white IFF images.

     * A printer driver is supplied with the software and is installed as
     the  default printer on request.  All printing via the standard Amiga
     printer  device will be converted and saved as a G3 fax, ready for
     transmission.  For example, this allows direct creation of faxes from
     programs such as  Deluxe Paint (standard graphics printing), PPage &
     PageStream (desktop  publishing) and from Prowrite and WordPerfect etc
     (text to PRT:)

     * Receive 'security' is available on incoming faxes to prevent Junk
     fax.

     * A full phonebook system is included.  Single, multiple and group
     dialling are supported.

     * User defined cover page information is stored with every phone
     number entry for automatic generation of fax header sheets. Has the
     ability to include any IFF image as part of the header for company
     logo etc. Allows inclusion of scanned or IFF signature files.
     Transmission of Cover page is optional.

     * Create and send faxes in FINE or STANDARD mode. Received faxes may
     be re-transmitted as received.  Both resolution faxes are able to be
     printed on a standard amiga printer.


     * Any TEXT file or IFF image can be converted to Group 3 fax image
     format either prior to or during sending.  A limited set of imbedded
     commands are  available with text->fax conversion. These allow
     highlighting with bold,  italic, underlined or reversed text and page
     breaks, plus inclusion of  IFF graphic images within the created fax
     page.

     * Full AREXX support with more than 25 commands allowing complete
     remote  control of fax functions.

     * Auto-detection between FAX and DATA connections.  Ability to
     interface  with BBS software such as STAR-NET etc to provide a fax
     server  capability for dial-in users

     * Faxes are created in the standard CBM IFF FAX form with proprietary
     extensions. (The format is freely available)

     * Under WB2.04, an application icon can be switched on which enables
     the  user to drop any type of icon onto it and the software will take
     the  appropriate action.

     * The program can be iconified full functional background operation.


      Recommended retail price for the software is currently $AUS159.00
