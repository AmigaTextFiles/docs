                      AmiStation - The Amiga Workstation
                      ----------------------------------
Do you get tired of your roomates always using your computer?  Are you
afraid that your children or coworkers might accidentally destroy your data
or beat your hi-score at Tetris while you're not around?  AmiStation
provides a way of not only protecting your machine from casual users, but
also gives your Amiga the look and feel of a hi-cost workstation machine.

AmiStation is a security program that restricts use, and can also track it.
Each "trusted" user is assigned a login name and password.  At bootup they
are presented with a login panel, ala a NeXT workstation where they must
enter their assigned username and password.  The system then records the
date and time of their login, so if someone screws up your system you'll
know who to blame.


Requirements:
-------------
     KickStart 2.x is REQUIRED!
     Has been tested on A500/A2000/A3000 and with the 68000,6030,68040


Purpose:
--------
   o Provide somewhat of a multi-user environment
   o Make your Amiga look a little bit more professional looking
   o Limit machine access (to the less knowledgeable user)


Features:
---------
   o Login panel (ala NeXT) at startup, unique username and password 
     are required to access machine.
   o Logs user's access
   o Utility to add/remove/edit users (password protected)
   o Finger utility to display user information
   o Unix like user data
   o Backdoor maintenance password
