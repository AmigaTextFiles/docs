More Directory Opus woes.

I have been informed that there is also a version of Directory Opus
going round called 3.51. I would like to publicly announce that this
has nothing whatsoever to do with me at all. 3.50 is a legitimate
beta version that escaped, but 3.51 has obviously been hacked by some
mindless idiot, for what purpose I'm not sure.

It is accompanied by a file called the Dorex.library, and version 3.51
of ConfigOpus and DirOpus itself. You should on no accounts even
consider running this version; it could be a trojan virus for all I
know.
