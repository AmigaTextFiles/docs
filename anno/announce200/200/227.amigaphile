===========================================================================

   This issue fell together in record time.  I do believe I'm getting
better at this.  Actually, I'm just getting more organized.  I also had a
good number of submission right off the bat.  All the letters I have
gotten from readers so far, tell me how much you like AMIGAphile and think
it's a good idea.  This is great and the encouragement keeps me trying to
improve each issue.  I just wish the letters were more specific.  What do
you want to read about?  What columns should I keep and which ones are
slug feed?  After all, the newsletter is for you and you have 100% say in
its future.
   This month brings us to the final article covering the AMIGAphile
survey.  This brings me great relief because it means I don't have to
right any more of them.  It does leave me with the question "What will I
do next?"  New in this issue is the Amiga Assembly programming series.  If
you know little to nothing about assembly programming this column won't be
much help.  It focuses on how to program the Amiga and make use of its
many unique capabilities.  You know, the ones we wish more companies would
use to improve the programs made for the Amiga.
   I sent some copies of issue #2 to advertisers hoping that they will
decide AMIGAphile it is worth their advertising dollars.  This will
greatly improve the issues to come.  I will continue producing the version
distributed in ASCII over the networks and BBSs of the world as long as
someone will read them but if I can't get some advertisers, I will have to
either drop the hardcopy version or start charging for it.  If you want to
advertise your Amiga product, please contact me, we have reasonable rates
and a very large distribution.
   If I understood a little more about the legal aspects of running a
magazine, I'd like to offer AMIGAphile's hardcopy version on a
subscription basis.  Each issue would only cost about $1.00 US.  I think
that is a real bargain.  Those with access to a BBS or Internet could
still read it for free but then those who are not as privileged could pick
it up at the newsstand or receive it in the mail.  All good things take
time.  If you have any experience in this area, please give me a hand.
   Lately, there are a lot of rumors flying about Commodore's new
products.  The A3000T-040 and the A3640 card have been officially
announced.  More new items will be announced at the World of Commodore
show in Pasadena September 11-13.  The A4000 will be announced along with
the long anticipated AA chipset.  The line between fact and rumor is very
thin right now so take all these new tidings with a grain of salt.
AMIGAphile will try to keep you informed as best it can.

===========================================================================
============================= AMIGAphilosophy =============================
===========================================================================

   I didn't get much response on the ideas I mentioned in the last issue
of AMIGAphile.  I hope more readers take the time to get in touch with me.
I enjoy speaking with each of you and trading ideas.

WHY IS AMIGAphile A 'NEWSLETTER' AND NOT A MAGAZINE?

   This has to do with filing taxes and gets into areas I don't
understand.  Maybe a reader who is more legally inclined can help me here.
If it were a magazine, I'd have to go about getting an ISSN number and
deal with a bunch of stuff I have no idea about.  I'm not a publisher and
most of them seem to shy away from Amiga related magazines.  This is all
created on my home Amiga.  That's the only way to keep the costs down and
the bureaucratic red tape at bay.  AMIGAphile is a non-profit
organization.  Usually this involves a lot of forms for taxes and
inventory.  According to the people I talked with at the Department of
Taxation, I don't need to get a business license because I don't sell
anything (this is true but could change).  I wouldn't have to pay tax on
materials used to make the newsletter but that doesn't save me but about
$.02 (which I'd just add to some other conversation).  But, then I'd have
to fill a bunch of zeros into a bunch of forms for the rest of my life
(that's the bad news).  I was told to register the name (where do you
register a trademark?) so nobody else could use it without permission.
Then, claim any money I happen to make on my personal taxes.  For a non-
profit organization, this profit has to be under a certain amount which I
have never made in a year anyway.  In short, remember, it's a 'newsletter'
not a magazine.  I hope somebody can give me a better idea about what
forms to fill out and who to file with in order to make this all on the up
and up.  I'd even consider hiring somebody to do it (if I had any money).
I'd like to take this newsletter into the magazine frontier but not this
month.

THE MAKING OF AMIGAphile

   You though it was some type of organic substance which regenerates and
mutates each month but I'm here to dispel this rumor.  I work very hard
putting together each issue.  There are many other involved including
those who submit articles and reviews and the assistant editors who check
everything I write to eliminate any errors and make this a quality
newsletter.
   I begin by collecting any submission articles.  I insert all of them
into a word processor (Excellence! by Micro-Systems Software) and create
the ASCII version of the newsletter.  I then send it to my assistant
editors (via Internet) and they correct all my slip-ups.  I send a copy to
Mike Neylon who creates the troff version.  My edited copy gets imported
into PageStream (by Soft-Logik Publishing) and I create the PostScript
version from here.  I print a master copy of each page and take them to
the printer where they get photocopied to create the hardcopy version of
the newsletter.  I take the pages and collate, fold, staple, label, and
stamp before mailing them to their final destination.
   Sounds easy doesn't it?  If you have some better suggestion which won't
cost me an arm, a leg, and a vital organ, pass them along.  The method
described above works.  I hope all the effort is appreciated.
   Does anyone have any ideas how to add some color?  How about pictures
for the postscript/hardcopy edition?  I was thinking about color laser
copies for the hardcopy edition.  Maybe some digitizing for the postscript
version.  Just tossing around some ideas.  (as the editor drifts into a
hazy dream)

EMAILING LIST

   Does anyone know how to setup an automated emailing list?  I have been
doing it by hand but I know there is a better way.  I don't mind sending
out AMIGAphile issues through email, especially since some people don't
have ftp capabilities at their site, but I'd rather have it be automated.
That would leave me more time to devote to creating each issue.

TITLE PAGES

   Everyone doesn't get to see the lovely title page but those who print
(or view) the postscript version or get the hardcopy version seem to enjoy
them.  If you have a piece of original artwork to display on the cover of
AMIGAphile, send it to me.  Remember, it will only be black and white.
Pictures in electronic form can be pasted into the postscript version
easily.  Photos could only appear in the hardcopy version unless I can get
someone to digitize them for me.

CLASSIFIED ADS

   Does everyone think these are too expensive or am I just being
impatient.  I tried to make them comparatively low.  Maybe you just don't
have any Amiga related items to get rid of.

NEXT MONTH

   Next month I want to include articles on upgrading from WB 1.3 to WB
2.0.  Any volunteers?

   That's all the news about AMIGAphile that's fit to print.  I hope to
hear from everyone this month.

   FIGHTER DUEL PRO (FDPro) is the successor to Fighter Duel, Corsair vs.
Zero.  FDPro retains all of the breakthrough features of its predecessor
and combines a full selection of aircraft and performance enhancements to
deliver a professional package for the serious aviator.
   Included among the 16 Allied and Axis aircraft are the Mustang,
Spitfire and Me109.  Some interesting lesser types, like the Japanese J7W
Shinden are also included.
   An exciting and exclusive new feature of FDPro is the ability to
connect a second computer through the main flight computer's parallel port
(special adapter available from Jaeger Software for $15.00) that
continually displays the view to the rear of the aircraft.  Now you can
duel an opponent through the serial port while watching your six on the
slave, all at 28 frames per second on a high resolution, interlaced
display.
   New features include:  Rear view mode (with a second 'slave' computer),
16 Airplanes, Unrestricted view panorama, Rudder pedal support, Integrated
tournament mode, Ground dots (switchable from dim, bright, and off),
Multiple computer controlled enemy bogeys (2), Enemy skill level is user
selectable, Catapult launches, New ground scenery, Review the last minute
of flight, and 'Turbo' mode to get to places at 16 times normal speed.
   FDPro will run on any 1 meg Amiga, from the 500 up through the 3000T.
All processors are supported.  Kickstart 1.2 or higher is required.  A
faster processor and more RAM is recommended for some of the extra
features (multiple bogeys and ground dots).

Authors:  Jaeger Software, William F Manders, and Matt Shaw

   Release date for FDPro is September 1992.  The list price is $59.95.
Owners of Fighter Duel, Corsair vs Zero may upgrade to FDPro by sending a
certified check or money order (sorry, no credit card orders) for $25.00,
and disk #1 of Fighter Duel, Corsair vs Zero, to:

   FIGHTER DUEL PRO FLIGHT RECORDER is the first interactive motion path
generator.  Flight Recorder retains all the breakthrough features of the
Fighter Duel World War II flight simulator series, while adding the
ability to create realistic and complex object motion paths for use in
NewTek's Lightwave 3D software.
   One of the most difficult and time consuming aspects of 3D animation is
motion.  FDPro Flight Recorder replaces the tedious method of hand
plotting flying motion paths with a flight simulator you control.  Flight
Recorder records the flight path of up to three (3) aircraft engaged in
maneuvers or dogfighting.  Positional information has a resolution of 30
frames per second.  Motion paths may then be imported into Lightwave 3D to
accurately animate flying objects, the camera viewpoint, aircraft,
spacecraft, flying logos, etc.......
   You may fly solo against computer controlled opponents or interactively
with another person via modem or null modem cable.
   FDPro Flight Recorder also has the ability to simultaneously generate
Fighter Duel Pro Demo Reels that can be used to review your solo flights
   FDPro Flight Recorder will run on any Amiga with 3 megs of RAM and
Kickstart 1.2 or higher.  A hard drive is recommended.
   Release date for FDPro Flight Recorder is November 1992.  The list
price is US $79.95.   Owners of Fighter Duel Pro may upgrade to FDPro
Flight Recorder by sending a certified check or money order (sorry, no
credit card orders) for US $25.00 (including shipping), and disk #1 of
FDPro, to Jaeger Software [listed in the FDPro section above]

   This special parallel adapter allows the connection of the two
computers.
   Two Centronics-type parallel cables and the FDPro Parallel Adapter are
required.
   Release date for the FDPro Parallel Adapter is September 1992. The list
price is US $15.00.   To order, send a certified check or money order
(sorry, no credit card orders) for US $15.00 (shipping included) to Jaeger

     Resolutions available on the Atari Falcon030 (c) 1992 Atari Corp.
                         Written by John Townsend

A couple of notes: Unlike previous machines, there are just too many
resolutions to give each resolution a name.  Therefore, I will do my best
to describe what the resolution is and which monitor it is on.

- NOTE: TV and a Color Monitor are the same..  by Color Monitor, I am
talking about the standard SC1224.  By VGA, I mean a standard VGA Monitor.

  256 color, line-doubling, VGA: 640x240,  256 colors, 8 planes

and lastly..  there are compatibility modes for ST Low, ST Medium, and ST
High on both VGA monitors and SC1224 monitors.  (On a color monitor, ST
High is achieved by using the interlace mode).

Also, the ST Monochrome monitor (the SM124) will work with Falcon030 as
well.  However, it only supports one resolution: ST High Resolution.

All modes on a TV can be overscanned.  This means multiplying the X and Y
resolution by 1.2.  For example, modes with 320 pixels of horizontal
resolution (X res) will become 384 pixels across, and modes with 640
pixels will become 768 across.  Overscanning is done in the X and Y
resolution.  You can't do them independently.  Special Note: On a VGA
monitor, overscan is "faked"..  since the video hardware doesn't have the
capability to do overscan on a VGA monitor, we made it so that if a
overscan mode is set on a VGA monitor, you still see the normal size
screen, but the screen is a window onto the bigger overscanned image.
Make sense?  We did this for compatibility.   This way if a game that has
an overscanned startup picture can use the same pic on both the VGA
monitor and the TV monitor.  Pretty cool, eh?  <grin>

BTW...  Overscan can NOT be set from the desktop.  The AES and Desktop
will work just fine with it, but because you can't see the parts of the
screen, we thought that option shouldn't be available from the desktop.
We don't want to confuse people.  However, Overscan can be set using a new
XBIOS call (Vsetmode())...  so it is still available.

I hope I haven't made any mistakes.  I triple-checked this document in
search of errors and I couldn't find any.  If you do find some, send me
Email on GEnie (to TOWNS) or CIS (70007,1135) and let me know.

-- John Townsend, Atari Corp.

   After looking at this one more time...  one point to clear up: By
saying SC1224 Color Monitor, I mean any Color Monitor that Atari have
manufactured for the ST/Mega/STE/MegaSTE computers.  Clear as mud?

    ASDG Incorporated announces the development of Art Department
Professional support for the industry standard digital video scheme used
by Abekas Digital Disk Recorders.
   Using this support, digital video images stored on 8mm cartridge tapes
can be directly exchanged between the Amiga and Abekas A60, A65 and A66
systems.  As a result, it is now more likely that professional
videographers will use Amigas for high-end video work.
   ADPro support for the Abekas carries a list price of $200 and requires
a Commodore SCSI disk controller and an Exabyte tape drive to function.
   For information as to how to acquire ADPro's Abekas support or where to
purchase Exabyte tape drives, contact Gina Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated,
925 Stewart Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call (608) 273-6585.

   Supra is doing the final beta testing on its latest rom for the
SupraFaxModem V32 and V32bis.  Provided that this testing is completed
with no problems, Supra will be ready to ship this rom to its current
customers in a few weeks.
   Many of the enhancements are unique to the Supra V32/V32bis modem and
are not available from other manufactures who are using Rockwell's
v32/v32bis chipset or other v32/v32bis modems/fax modems that are on the
market.
   The new rom is currently reved as 1.2G and will include the following 
features:

   Enhances Busy Detection
   Fixes several Lock Display/Modem problems
   Improved Speed Renegotiation (Fall Back) upon bad line conditions
   Implements Fall Forward upon better line conditions
   Fixes Adaptive Answering (allows data/fax determination)
   Implements ECM  (Error Correction Mode)
      Note:  Must be supported by fax software
   Implements BFT mode (Binary File Transfer)
      Note:  Must be supported by fax/terminal software
   Fixes problem with DCD line turning off if modem configured with &C
   &Dx and &Cx settings are respected when in fax mode
   Fixes problem connecting with some fax machines
   Added S-Register S109
   Added S-Register S110=3
   Implements Silent Answer (allows voice/fax determination) 
      Note:  Must be supported by fax software
   Implements Caller ID

   Supra will be sending an upgrade offer to all registered owners.  This
offer will be for either a free ROM which has all of the above features,
except silent answer and caller ID, or for a charge of less than $30, a
rom which has all of the above features, including silent answer and
caller ID.  Oversees customers will be able to get the roms from the
overseas dealer that sold it to them.  If they purchased the modem from a
US dealer or Supra, they will need to order the rom from Supra, but there
will be a shipping and handling charge.
   You will be able to order either rom from Supra via its BBS.  We are
currently working on the software to allow this, plus to allow you to
enter your warranty card or change your warranty card online.  Once this
is working, it will be activated and you can immediately enter your order.
The quickest way to order the rom will be via the BBS.  Until then, please
do not contact Supra to order either rom.
   The above information is subject to change or modification.  At this
time, this is all that is known.  As soon as costs and other information
is known, we will let you know via the Supra BBS.

   New Horizons is pleased to announce a new upgrade to ProWrite, the best
selling Amiga word processor.  ProWrite version 3.3 adds a number of
enhancements over version 3.2; these enhancements include:

*  HotLinks
ProWrite 3.3 supports the HotLinks dynamic data exchange system developed
by Soft-Logik Publishing.  This gives you a very close integration between
ProWrite and other HotLinks-capable programs; you can edit text in
ProWrite and have it automatically incorporated into your desktop
publishing system, or change graphics in a drawing or painting program and
have the changes automatically brought into ProWrite!

*  Automatic Text Wrap Around Pictures
You can now have text automatically wrap around pictures, either block-
style or following the picture's curves, and with an adjustable offset.

*  Picture Enhancements
There are a great many enhancements to picture handling in ProWrite 3.3,
including the ability to name pictures and search for them in your
documents, and precise control over a picture's location and size.

*  Print Preview
Now you can get a reduced view of the each page of your document, to see
on the screen how your final layout looks.

*  Improved Font Handling
You can specify any font size for your text, not just those that are
installed on your system.  This gives you complete creative control over
your text's appearance, and is especially useful if you are using outline
fonts or printing on PostScript printers.

*  System Clipboard Support
ProWrite 3.3 can exchange text and pictures with other Amiga programs
through the Amiga's system clipboard.

*  Macro and AREXX Enhancements
ProWrite 3.3 adds a very large number of new macro commands, giving you
virtually complete control over ProWriteUs operation through AREXX.

*  Kickstart 3.0 and New Amiga Graphics Chips Support
ProWrite 3.3 includes support for new features in Kickstart 3.0, as well
as allowing you to open up to 256 color screens on machines with the new
Amiga graphics chips.

*  And Much More!
There are many more improvements throughout the program; things like
document password protection, an optional vertical ruler, and much faster
PostScript picture printing.

ProWrite 3.3 will be shipping in September 1992, with a new suggested
retail price of $99.95 US.

Registered owners will be sent upgrade information in the mail.  Upgrade
information is as follows:

Upgrading from version 3.0 or later:   $20.00
          from version 2.5 or earlier: $60.00

Shipping and handling in US:            $5.00
            other countries:           $10.00

(Texas residents must add 8% sales tax.)

CANONSTUDIO

   CanonStudio  is a new program which is intended for all Amiga Canon
printer drivers.  It does print 24/8Bit IFF graphics with up to 24 bit
accuracy in any size (Want a 100*100m poster?).  CanonStudio is not
limited to the max.  4096 colors of the Amiga printer device, though it
does work with nearly all Amiga printer drivers.  The pictures are printed
FROM DISK ie.  you don't need much memory for printing a 10MByte 24 Bit
graphic in high quality.

   CanonStudio is specially written for the Amiga operation system and is
not  just a simple portation from an IBM or Apple computer.  Because of
this, CanonStudio makes heavily use of multitasking and Kickstart 2.04.
CanonStudio includes a spooler which allows you to specify multiple print
jobs while the program is already printing in background.  The program
does provide a nice "click-and-drag" user interface.

Now, here are some of the CanonStudio features:

- prints IFF pictures from disk
- does support nearly every IFF format including IFF24, HAM6,
  HAM8 and EHB.
- does not require $&%$ MBytes memory!
- poster function allows printing of any sized pictures
- number of copies can be defined
- 24/8 Bit accuracy
- multiple jobs can be defined and printed in background (estimated print
  time and more will be displayed)
- ink compensation does correct ink impurities
- color adjustment (gamma, contrast, brightness, weights,...)
- Free definable ordered dither routines.  Following ordered dither
  matrices are already included:  Haltone-A, Halftone-B, Ordered-A,
  Ordered-B, Spiral, Horizontal, Vertical, Bck-Diagonal, Fwd-Diagonal
- Three error diffusion dither routines:  Floyd Steinberg, Jarvis, Stucki
- Two serpentine blue noise dither routines are included:  30% random
  weight, 50% random weight
- ARexx interface
- font independent user interface

What does CanonStudio requires:

- an Amiga with at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04
- ~300KB memory (yep, that's all!)
- a Canon printer driver:
  - CanonBJ130 V11.1 (Fish 696 and Canon)
  - CanonBJ10 V4     (Fish 696 and Canon)
  - CanonBJ300 V4.1  (Fish 696 and Canon)
  - CanonLBP V3      (Canon, Version 1 on Fish 4xx)
  - CanonBJC V.99d   (new, see message that follows)  (supports Epson 24
and 48 pin emulation! Epson24Plus and Star24Plus user should switch!!!)

This program is shareware and limited.  In case you want the full
version you can order CanonStudio from:

============================= ASK THE EXPERTS =============================

   I recruited a few experts but we have no questions to answer.  I was
hoping the hardcopy edition would pick up (before the financial problems
anyway).  Most of the questions would be from people without access to
Internet.  The net makes life easier for the majority of us who encounter
problems but not everyone is lucky enough to have access.
   To prove that there are experts out there who don't know they have
expertise, I would like to point out that if you upgraded to WB 2.0 (and
it works) then you are an expert at this.  Send me you experiences and
opinions for next months column.

                         What My Amiga Means To Me

                              by Chuck Kenney


   Radio controlled cars and airplanes, CB radios, police scanners,
calculators, remote-controlled consumer electronics of all kinds, etc...
I've bought them all - usually within days of their first appearances on
the market!  OKay-Okay, I admit it.  I'm a hard-core neo-techno-phile.

   Or is it techno-neo-phile?

   It was all the rage in the late seventies.  Many of my fellow computer
technicians were buying 'home computers' for themselves.  "Home
computer?", I thought.  "I can have my own computer at home?".  "I've
gotta check this out!".  So I drove down to my local RADIO SHACK.  I took
one look at this big grey thing that was called a 'home computer'.  "It
has a TV screen?", I asked.   "Oh, it's called a 'C-R-T'.  Sorry."  "What
does C-R-T mean?", I wondered.  "And you can save programs on a cassette
tape?".  "Nice."  <blah, blah..$$$.>  "It costs HOW MUCH ???".  For THAT
kind of money, it wasn't quite nice enough!  I mean, a home computer
should be like a color TV with a keyboard - you know, it should do COLOR
and draw PICTURES and make MUSIC!  I decided to 'pass' on this T-R-S...
whatever it was called.  So I bought the latest and greatest printing
calculator.  "Never walk out of a technology store empty-handed."  Oops!
Batteries, extra printing paper... and oh....a pair of mini-book-shelf
speakers while I'm here.
                       ...And speaker wire.
   Not more than a month later, I saw THE AD in a magazine...  It looks
like a keyboard with a computer built-in!  It does color!  It hooks up to
your color TV!!  It has special graphics and sound!!!   And look at the
key-caps on the keyboard!!!  LOOK!!  There's little graphics pictures
right there on the fronts of the key-caps!!!!  WOW!!!!!
   My next income tax return was plowed into my new Commodore VIC-20.
Three hundred and ninety-nine dollars... plus tax.  I think that's what I
paid.  I was so excited the day I bought it, I can't remember now what
store I bought my VIC-20 from.  I only remember this colorful box under my
arm and driving home to get started with my new 'home computer' hobby!
How long ago was that?  10...15 years?  It was exactly 4 apartments, 1
job, 1 wife, 1 home and 1 baby ago, all of which are still 'in service',
even the apartments (presumably).  During that time, and mostly before I
got married, I had acquired a Commodore 64, Amiga-1000 and Amiga-2000, and
let's not forget ALL the requisite accessories and peripherals; disk
drives, hard drives, video, music, monitors, MIDI, memory, modems,
aaannnnd multitudes of software.  These are all still 'in service'.  OKay-
Okay, the VIC-20 is in a closet.
   So, as I have grown/aged/matured/withered (choose one) from a 'typical'
American bachelor (who used to blow his entire paycheck) to a 'typical'
home-owner/husband/father (who is saving for a hair-cut), I will now
(finally) tell you what my Amiga (specifically) and Commodore computing
(in general) has come to mean to me... or maybe you can guess...
   I like to compose music - DMCS, SoundScape, Music-X, Dr. T's.
   Photography is another hobby - Digi-View, ECA PhotoLab, TV*Text,
      DeluxePaint IV.
   Videos for friends and family - Deluxe Paint IV, Deluxe Video III,
      The Director, Animation station, etc.
   Pocket Billiards is another hobby - Animate the trick shots I know
      (BIG unfinished project!)
   Golf!  I'll never break ninety - maybe if I digitize a pro's swing
      and genlock it over my own swing...
   I probably SHOULD keep my resume updated - Final Copy and my wife's,
      and sisters', and in-laws'... - Final Copy again
   Mailing lists for a couple of local music groups - SuperBase
   Games - Too many to mention, but the C-64 "JUMPMAN" is a CLASSIC.
      (I wrote a program to pick the start level!)
   What if I opened a Billiard Parlor? - VIP_Professional
   personal inventory - SuperBase
   Interactive video for my daughter, Faith - AmigaVision

   and on and on and on...

   As my life habits and routines have changed over the years, so have my
computing habits changed, from weekend-long cold-pizza-programming to
intermittent tinkering.  When I first purchased my Commodore 64, the first
thing I did was to convert all my VIC-20 cartridge games to C-64 disks.
This was a fun project for learning machine language, disk drives, memory
maps, memory expanders, etc.  My first Amiga project was to convert a C-64
"Simons's Basic" program I had written to AmigaBasic - the program
simulates a Spiro-Graph (remember that set of plastic rings and wheels
that you could draw neat little designs with?).  Shortly before getting
married, I purchased my first 'C compiler' and a couple 3-D ray-tracers. I
managed to get the famous "Hello, world"  C-program to compile, and to
generate a glass sphere in TurboSilver, but since then I have become a
devout home-owner/husband/father and the 'C' programming and ray-tracing
doors will likely not ever be opened any wider by me.  Well, maybe when I
retire - it's only about 30 years away.
   Only 30 years away?  You may laugh...I'm serious!  I met a retired
'home-computer nut' at an 'in-law' family reunion.  He's a great-uncle of
my wife.  He was thrillfully telling me about his COCO (Radio Shack COlor
COmputer) computing hobby.  He had just hooked-up his brand new "5-1/2
inch disk drive".  "5-1/4, Uncle COCO, not 5-1/2", I thought.  He was
amazed at how much faster it was than his data-cassette drive!  So, I just
MAY be sitting down in front of my old Amiga in the year two-thousand-and-
twenty-something to try some ray-tracing as a retiree.  I am quite sure I
won't have the money to buy an Amiga 9000 or whatever Amiga model will
(hopefully) be available by then.  It WILL be fun though to bore a great-
nephew-in-law computer hobbyist at a family reunion with a story of my
recent upgrade to 8 Megs of memory!  And he will probably be thinking
something like, "God!  Doesn't he know that RAM went out with the 1990's?
NAM modules are the ONLY way to go these days.".  (writer's note:  NAM -
Neural Access Memory module, infinite capacity, uses turn-of-the-21st-
century neuralectronics technology.)

   ... But,  I am getting off the subject...

   So, at the risk of sounding ridiculously romantic, the Amiga has become
a sort of "friend" - one I intend to keep for a long, long time. The Amiga
has depths I will never explore.  It has POWERFUL programs that can be
intuitively learned (and revisited after long periods of time). "Ami" is
both EASY to use AND to be PRODUCTIVE with - a rare combination.  I get
the feeling that the Amiga has the power to enable the prodigy, REGARDLESS
of his field of interest.  EVERY other computer I have EVER sat down to
seems like only a box, a tube, and a keyboard - no personality, no
excitement, no pizzazz.  Just... well, not fun.  Maybe this is why the
other computers are making it in the business arena.  After all, work IS
supposed to be "work", you know... not "fun".  Without the Amiga, I would
have quite an un-interesting, un-fun, and difficult time getting various
things accomplished.

           Bravo, Amiga!  Kudos, Commodore (not you, Marketing)!

                              Amiga Assembly

                      An Introduction - 'Hello World'

                              by Sean Conner


   Welcome to the first of a (hopefully) ongoing series of articles on
Assembly Language for the Amiga.

   Anyway, after some thought, I decided to stay away from the traditional
course of things, where I spend an article describing binary, octal,
decimal and hexadecimal notation, then spend several articles describing
the instruction set of the MC68000 (shorthand version: 68k), and THEN
spend an article on how to use an Assembler and linker and then ...

   I've had enough of that type of teaching method in class.  Besides,
there are many, many books out there that can teach you that stuff.  Like
I said, I'm not going the tradition route here.

   "Well," you say, "if I can just buy a book and learn Assembly Language
that way, why waste my time reading this?"  Glad you asked (pretend you
asked).  Most books on the subject (about 99%) on Assembly go into
excruciating detail about the instruction set, giving trivial examples on
how to use most of the instructions available, and maybe an overview of
the computer system (just enough to run some not-quite-as-trivial-but-
still-useless-in-the-real-world examples (not all books are like this, but
many are).  Also, some books assume you've never programmed a computer
before.  Other's assume some programming experience (BASIC, C, Fortran,
Pascal, stuff like that) and try to use that knowledge to teach you.  I've
found that that usually is a hindrance to learning something so radically
different (and no, C is not quite the 'portable Assembly' some say it is).

   What I'm planning on doing is to present some (hopefully) realistic
situations that face the Assembly Language programmer, offer several
solutions, and explain why I did what I did.  I also hope to teach
something about the art of optimization (or, in the old days of hacking,
what was called bumming code [1]).  I also hope to teach you about what's
available on the Amiga, both software wise (Exec, AmigaDOS, Intuition,
etc) and hardware wise (DMA, Blitter, Copper, etc).
   I've found that the best way to learn Assembly Language is to have a
good book (or some book if you can't find a good book), look at as much
Assembly code as you can get (the good, the bad and the ugly) and then
program as much as possible (typing in examples by hand, if you have to).

   So grab that 68k reference, the RKMs [6] and come on ...

                         *     *     *     *     *

   But first!  A word about the software I use (simply because Dan Abend
(the almighty Editor-in-Chief) mentioned that I should mention it) and the
hardware I have.  So here goes ...

   The Assembler I use is A68k [3] by Charlie Gibbs (well, the Amiga port
anyway).  The reason I use A68k is that one, it's free.  Two, is that you
get the source code.  Also, it does support separate compilation of source
code for later linking.  It may not be as fast as ASMOne, but ASMOne
doesn't really allow you to have separate modules (at least the versions
I've seen).

   The linker is Blink [3], from the Software Distillery.  It too, is
freely available and (from what I've heard) a bit better than Alink (the
default linker for the Amiga).  Besides, A68k works in conjunction with
Blink anyway, so ...

   And the editor I use is Dme [3], by Matt Dillion.  If you've never
heard of Matt Dillion, that's surprising, because Matt is a code factory
(Dme, Dmake, DICE (an integrated C environment including front end, pre-
processor, compiler and assembler (not sure about the linker though)), Csh
(a replacement for the CLI) and various other miscellaneous utilities).
The editor is, again, free, comes with source code and is customizable
(remap the entire keyboard if you want to).

   About the only thing that isn't quite freely available are the include
files from Commodore.  You basically get them from Commodore, or from a
development environment like Lattice C (that's where I got mine from), or
type them in from the RMK books (not something I recommend 8-).  I use
them because they're there, but if many of you don't have them, I guess I
can supply the values (mostly offsets inside of structures really) needed.

   As for hardware, I have an Amiga 500 with a lowly 68000 running 1.3, 3
meg RAM (512K of that is chip) and a GVP Impack Series II A500-HD+ 50M
hard drive (at least, that's what it says), and two 3.5 disk drives.
Nothing that spectacular (well, except for the hard drive), although for
development work, a harddrive is recommended, but you may get by without
one (which I've done on a old IBM PC. Not for the faint of heart).

   But enough of formalities, on with the show ...

                         *     *     *     *     *

   Seeing how this is the first article (of a series) and all, I've
decided that a frivolous program wouldn't be all that bad.  Besides, the
following program is one that is done in each programming language (at
least, every time I learned a new language, I've done this program in it),
and if you can get this one to run, you're on your way.  Besides, even K&R
[4] did this program in their book, _The_C_Programing_Language_.

   All the program does is print 'hello world' to the screen (well, in
this case, to the CLI window you run the program from), but it does
illustrate some points about the structure of an Assembly language
program, and some of what is needed to start a program on the Amiga.

   The first few lines include the Amiga specific include files.  I've
found that this order of includes works (at least for the Assembly .i
files from SAS/Lattice and A68k).  I've included them because (1) they're
there, and (2) I don't feel like tracking down the offsets manually
through the RKMs (although, like I said, I can probably find out the
offsets they provide if enough people ask me ... ).

   The next section is the actual code, as you can see from the line that
starts 'section mycode,code'.  I include the section directive because (1)
I come from the MS-DOS world where it's MANDATORY to have sections for
code, data and stack (old habits die hard) and (2) because I tend to write
large programs that span several files, and this way, the linker (Blink)
will string together all the code sections that have the same name, and
all the data sections with the same name.  It keeps things more manageable
with small files than one large monolithic piece of code that's about 70K
in size!

   Sections are optional under A68k, and you can forego them, but I feel
that the benefits of using this method outweigh any other reason you may
have for not doing it.  Anyway ... on to the actual code.

   The first thing you'll notice is that I open up dos.library.  Since
this is a complete stand alone program (not linked with anything else), I
have to do this step.  The next thing I have to do is get the file handle
for output to the CLI window (usually, unless you re-direct output to a
file, in which case, the file handle I get references that file).  Only
then can I actually output any message.

   After the message is written, I then can close the dos.library and then
simply return to the system.

   Wow!  Quite a bit of code just to print out a 13 byte message.  Well,
welcome to the wonderful world of Assembly.  One thing you'll notice is
that the source code for programs written in Assembly tend to be a bit
larger than their counterparts written in higher level languages (HLLs)
like C or Pascal, but the resulting executable is usually smaller (unless
you link in a large static library like c.lib).  Because with Assembly,
you're more or less telling the CPU exactly what you want done, as opposed
to, say C, which has to take a more general route to get something done.

   So, track down an Assembler and linker (maybe even an editor), read
your 68k reference manual, peruse the RKMs (if you have them) and play
around with the code some, and next month, we'll see about getting rid of
those nasty gurus that seem to keep popping up on the system, if you're
like me and still running under 1.3.  Even if you have 2.0 (which, if I
understand, has done away with gurus), you will still find next month's
topic interesting.  Also, some code to output more than just static text.

  See you later ...

UN*X: n. Used to refer to the UNIX operating system (a trademark of AT&T)
in writing, but avoiding the need for the ugly {(TM)} typography. Also
used to refer to any or all varieties of Unixoid operating systems.
Ironically, lawyers now say (1990) that the requirement for the TM-postfix
has no legal force, but the asterisk usage is entrenched anyhow.  It has
been suggested that there may be a psychological connection to practice in
certain religions (especially Judaism) in which the name of the deity is
never written out in full, e.g., `YHWH' or `G--d' is used.  See also

                             AMIGAphile Survey
                        part III: The Final Chapter


   Overall, the AMIGAphile survey was fun and enlightening.  I hope to do
this again next year but until then, here are a few final figures to think
about.

SHAREWARE

   Eighty three percent of those surveyed (chose Trident for their
patients who chew gum) use shareware programs.  The Amiga has the largest
number of shareware programs available.  This makes 83% no surprising.
Most users would never consider using software without paying for it.
This would ensure that developers keep developing and a good software
market would exist.  The problem is that only 56% register the shareware
they use.  At least 20% register some of the shareware programs they use.
They are honest about this fact.  Some authors don't support their
products and I think users should demand good support before registering.
The bad news is, this leaves 24% who don't register the shareware they
use.  Bad user!  Bad user!  The above figures are alarming.  Everyone
complains about the software quality, the product support, the lack of
upgrades, blame it piracy.  Software companies are dropping the porting of
their software to the Amiga.  This is good news for those who have ugly,
slow, IBM ports but this is bad news for the software market.  The IBM
market is more lucrative.  If you use the software, register it.  If there
is a reason you won't register it, let the author know.  Without software
all our fabulous hardware is scrap metal.  I know that piracy exists but
all the problems can't be blamed on that alone.  Among pirates there is a
saying, "If it's good enough to take up disk space, it's good enough to
buy".  I do wish companies would do away with their stupid protection
schemes.  Pirates will always get around them and they annoy the helpless
user who owns a legitimate copy.  That's enough preaching.  Think about
supporting the software developers.  They will be the ones to say when the
Amiga is through in the market.  Even if Commodore stops making them,
there will still be those who have one.

HARDWARE HACKERS

   The Amiga was originally 'the' hacking machine.  Many users do their
own hardware upgrades.  A1000 owners are particularly prone do solder
things inside their system.  22% of those surveyed do, or have done, their
own hardware hack.  The number of successful hacks was not tabulated by
this survey.  Many of them are simple and most are the only way to upgrade
an old system.  I'd be more willing to take a soldering iron to my machine
if I knew I could upgrade (read A1000 owner).

AVERAGE USE

   How often do you use your Amiga?  Now that I do this newsletter, my
Amiga only gets turned off long enough for me to sleep.  I do everything
on my Amiga (except fry eggs - even though the SCSI drive does run hot
enough).

WHAT I DO WITH MY AMIGA

   I tried to include a selection of the most common things done with a
home computer (especially the Amiga).  Two people threw me a curve and
said they use it to teach.  Now that's refreshing news.  Since most of the
surveys came from people on InterNet, the large number of people doing
telecommunications is expected.  This gives AMIGAphile the large reader
base.  Everybody is a game player.  The Amiga has the talents and is often
necessary to blow of some steam.  The rest of the figures, I leave for you
the decipher.  I wonder what the software market is geared towards...

POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

   It seems that C is envogue on every platform but Amiga users are
entrenched in that camp as well.  The Amiga always seemed very suitable
for programming in C and Commodore seems to encourage this buy looking at
their Programmers Reference manuals.  The ever classic BASIC holds second
place but I think this is because of the efforts to make it more
structured.  When I was growing up, everyone knew BASIC.  I guess,
learning new languages is never fun and with the improved environments so
BASIC packages offer, there is little incentive to change.  I expected
assembly to rank high on the list since many things are done better using
assembly language; even if it is in-line code in a C program.  The rest of
the contenders are languages which cater to a specific programming task.
Being at a university gives one the opportunity to be exposed to many
different languages but I don't imagine too many companies have accepted
some of the newer languages.  Maybe, it's because many of these languages
aren't support by the big names in language packages.

WHAT OTHER MACHINES DO AMIGA USERS OWN?

   Sixty one percent of Amiga owners have another system (two timers,
hmpfh).  Forty three percent own an IBM or a compatible.  This doesn't
surprise me for some reason (I own one too).  Windows is a face-lift for a
poor excuse of an operating system.  Excuse me, Bill Gates, you need how
much RAM to multi-task?  4 meg minimum?  I think I can name that tune in
512K.  Most IBM users are zombies who do what they're told without know
why.  They say you need a 386 or better, then that's what you buy.  I must
admit that the prices are low and the graphics are superior (for now).
Macintosh owners make up 14% of those who own another system.  They are
easy for novices to use.  They don't have any of that Guru nonsense the
early Amigas seemed to proliferate.  The other 40% own something
different.  These systems range from Commodore 64's to Apple ]['s and
Atari's.  Most of these systems just collect dust.  I know, I have one of
each.  I just like to have the latest and greatest.  I guess that's why I
didn't buy a Nintendo (needed more computing power).

HOW'S OUR DRIVING - COMMODORE

   Oh boy did I receive a ton of comments on this question.  Everybody has
an opinion about Commodore.  At least we are entitled to this one.  The
categories to rate were marketing, sales, support, reputation, and overall
opinion.  These are all opinions and reflect the feelings of Amiga owners
everywhere.  Commodore (tap tap tap) are you listening?  This could save
you company... (trailing off into the hot air).  Commodore has exhibited
very little marketing.  Take some initiative.  I just got a packet in the
mail about the Amiga as a multimedia machine.  It's great literature.
Now, put it in some magazines (I got this by filling out a reader service
card in Byte).  The figures indicate that people feel sales have been
going well but not great.  Mediocre... the computer isn't and the users
aren't ... who does that leave?  Support was rated at Good.  This is
encouraging.  I find support to be very important and would like to take
the time to thank everyone from Commodore who participates in discussions
on the InterNet.  Commodore's reputation ranks at average.  Is this how
the owners see Commodore or how other see Commodore?  I don't know (best
Pee Wee Herman impression).  Overall, they rate better than hangnails but
worse than pepperoni pizza.  Now if we could just get some really good
press...

RIDING INTO THE SUNSET

   Most of all, this survey was fun.  I got to introduce myself to many
different people and find out if AMIGAphile would be worth the effort.
The numbers never lie and I think the questions where pertinent.  I hope
you learned something.  Y'all come back now, ya hear!

   Lucasfilm Games has done it again. I'll just skip any corny
introduction I might have spent more effort cooking up -- This game is
simply amazing!

   Guybrush Threepwood is back, a little older, a little less naive, and
with an entirely new adventure ahead.  Monkey Island II has four islands,
an evil pirate's fortress, some new friends, very tricky puzzles, really
cool music, and that great Lucasfilm humor.  All on a whopping ELEVEN
disks!  You don't need a harddrive, but if you don't have one here's your
excuse.

   You don't need to have played the first Monkey Island, but it helps,
since you'll meet up with people from the first game.  Ever wonder what
happened to 'ol Stan, or how Guybrush fared with Elaine?

   Now Guybrush is after the legendary treasure of Big Whoop, which could
also be his ticket to finally destroying his arch-nemesis and really
creepy dead dude, the Ghost-Pirate LeChuck!  That's right, LeChuck is back
too and revenge is on his decomposing mind.

   Better brush up on your voodoo and roulette, because this one's a
toughy.  Fortunately, there are two versions of the game: the normal
version and the "whimpy" one, which doesn't have all of the puzzles.  Some
of these brain-teasers aren't very obvious at first (or even last), but
once you figure them out (or get some nice person on the Internet to give
you some hints) you'll likely laugh your head off!  The frustration and
anxiety are well worth the effort!

   If you're not familiar with this type of game, it's what's commonly
termed an "interactive graphics adventure."  Most of the screen is the
view of what's going on in the game and the lower portion of the screen
has a bunch of words describing what you can do, along with little icons
representing your inventory.  To look at an object, you would click on
"look" and then on the object (either on the viewscreen or in your
inventory).  There are keyboard shortcuts for most of the commands, so you
can press 'L' and then point the mouse at the object.  A two-handed
operation like this works a bit faster than just using the mouse.  When
you need to talk to another person, the control area turns into a list of
phrases you can say.  Click on a phrase and it appears above Guybrush's
head while his mouth moves (as do all characters when they speak).  He
even gestures with his hands convincingly where appropriate!  At any rate,
the interface is very intuitive and easy to learn.

   The graphics were converted very well from 256-color VGA.  The
animation is fluid, and most of the sequences are quite humorous.  Sound
effects are limited but the music is great, changing styles depending on
the location, and setting a distinct mood for each.  It's especially nice
running through a sound system with a bit of hall reverb if you have a
digital signal processor.

   The game will run in 1 megabyte of RAM, and the copy protection is a
cute code-wheel affair with some very interesting cures for some common
pirate diseases. There's only one problem: it won't run under AmigaDOS
2.0. You have to switch to 1.3 to get it to work correctly. This may be a
problem for A3000 owners with 2.0 in ROM. Perhaps some tweaking with cache
and RAM options will allow it to work.

Retail: $59.00

   I can't rave enough about Monkey Island II.  What an experience!  I
spent a whole week on it and hated when it was over -- and what a
surprise!  I can only hope there's more to come from LucasFilm Games.

On a scale of one to ten, this is a definite TEN!

GAME REVIEW

                             Building a World
                        SimEarth vs. Global Effect
                              by Mike Neylon

   Remember the good old days of Populous and SimCity?  Two relatively
simple games to learn, but required strategy and planning to conquer?
Well, with the release of SimEarth and Global Effect (as well as
Civilization), you can now prepare yourself for hours of strategy and
planning as you construct your own world.
   SimEarth, by Maxis, uses the same premise as SimCity and SimAnt: the
development and manipulation of 'sims', computer-controlled creatures that
follow basic instinct.  Your goal in SimEarth is to create a suitable
environment for your sims to evolve from singled-cell life-forms to space-
age civilizations.  You are allocated a 'energy budget' which grows based
on the number and type of life-forms present.  Your energy is reduced as
you perform actions on your planet: adjusting the water cycle, increasing
seismic activity, decreasing the reproduction rate, and several other
features.  You can also add life-forms and terrains to the planet. And for
fun, you can send that random meteor or tidal wave and see how the sims
react.
   The full game is played in 4 stages.  Each stage represents an
evolutionary cycle, and requires a fulfillment of a goal to proceed to the
next stage.  For example, in the first stage, you must create a planet
suitable for life, cause life to begin, and to get land-roaming creatures.
In the final stage, you must take the sentient race from the start of the
Industrial Age to the beginning of space travel.  The time scale in each
stage varies, from billions of years in the beginning, to hundreds of year
at the end.
   The sims, as well as the planet, are controlled by a theory known as
the Gaia effect.  The theory states that the planet and life are connected
in complex ways, and the actions of one will affect the other.  This is
very well implemented in SimEarth.  Once cities start appearing on your
planet, you will notice an increase in temperature, carbon dioxide levels,
and the planet will react, with severe weather and changes in the
environment.  A special interface can be used to 'talk' to your planet,
but this merely consists of a few sentences of advice.
   Global Effect, from Millennium, also uses the concept of creating your
own world, but from a different starting point.  In Global Effect, you
must colonize a world, using its resources wisely and carefully, but
without upsetting the environment of the world.  Again, you have an
'energy budget' which grows with the production of fuel from the planet.
Building production sites, cities, forests and park lands, and farms all
cost money.  However, you are less directly in control of the planet.  If
the planet starts to freeze, you just can't increase the greenhouse effect
- you must build services to fix that, or destroy the existing services
that create the cold temperatures.
   Power can come from several resources including oil, coal, nuclear,
solar, and wind.  If necessary, the resources must be processed before
use, and storage devices must be created.  Power must be supplied to the
city, and distribution is very important.  You also must provide fresh
water, sewage treatment, recycling programs, and hospitals for the people.
However, an eye must be kept on resources and the planet.  Once mines are
mined out, they are shut down, and are unusable.
   Several one player situations are available, including creating a
colony on several different types of planets and repairing damage done to
a planet.  However, there are also features to play with a second player
over a modem, or to play against the computer, either to create a world,
or to win control over a world.  Several services are added for that goal,
including missile silos, airfields, and harbors.
   Global Effect is filled with information, as is SimEarth.  Ozone layer
levels, pollution, and contamination are just some of the data one can
inquire about.  Both games are HD-installable, and work under both 1.3 and
2.0.  Neither require a lot of memory (can be run on a 1 meg machine), and
both are multi-tasking.
   I must admit, Global Effect has one of the best-looking interfaces I've
seen for a game.  The 32-color presentation is magnificent, and can be
played in NTSC or PAL.  SimEarth is only 16 colors, but some of the
creature icons are done quite well. The worlds in Global Effect are much
larger than those in SimEarth, and seem to have a much better resolution
in the end.  The SimEarth interface also seems to have a few bugs (a
button doesn't activate once in a while).  However, control in SimEarth is
much easier.  You can select an object using a menu-like technique, while
in Global Effect, you must scan through a list of icons to choose an
object (you can define the function keys to select an object).  Moving in
SimEarth involves moving the mouse to the edges of the screen causing it
to scroll, while in Global Effect, you must constantly click on a
directional pad, which costs you energy points.  Also, you seem to have a
more direct control on your planet in SimEarth; the results of your
actions seem to come much faster.
   Although the concepts are basically alike, strategy is vastly
different.  In SimEarth, I found that I could make several mistakes
without a major change happening on the planet.  Therefore, I had a bit
more room to experiment.  In Global Effect, moves are very costly, so one
must be cautious and plan well in advance.  Spacial arrangement of the
buildings in Global Effect is also a prime consideration, unlike SimEarth.
For example, start building too far away from a water source, and you will
start to lose people due to dehydration.
   As for complexity, both games must have a very large algorithm to
handle the simulation.  The reproduction and mutation of species in
SimEarth, and the environmental effects of habitations in Global Effect
are modelled very well.
   Both games also have a definite bad point.  In SimEarth, a noticeable
lag time occurs quite often, and play is sometimes very slow.  In Global
Effect, the computer opponent is very fast, and I have yet to be able to
keep up with it before being destroyed.  Besides other minor points, both
games are very enjoyable, and will provide hours of fun as you become a
god once again...

RATINGS:
  SimEarth
    originality: 9
    graphics:    7  (could have used 32 colors, I think)
    sound:       3  (only merit is the introduction of the tone monitor)
    playability: 8
    OVERALL:     8

  Global Effect
    originality: 8  (I think this one followed in the other's shadows)
    graphics:   10
    sound:       8  (good intro music, sound accompanies mouse clicks)
    playability: 7
    OVERALL:     9

OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM COMMODORE!!!

Commodore Canada has officially announced a number of products.

- Hard Drive for CDTV expansion slot (presumably 2.5" IDE ala A600)

- DCTV upgrade card for CDTV (for CDTV video slot)

- Amiga 4000 an official product!!!  To be shown to the public at WOC
Pasadena on September 12!  It ***WILL*** have the AA ChipSet!  Finally the
speculation is about to end!!

- AA ChipSet (as said above) officially announced.

- 600HD officially announced and SHIPPING with *40* meg drive, not the 20
meg the European versions have.  It will retail for $799 Suggested
Canadian Retail, with street price likely to be lower in most centres
(definitely so if the units start selling in quantity).

- A570 officially announced.  No word on whether it will have internal RAM
and HD expansion like the UK final-revision does (which was added at the
last minute).  Officially ready to ship any time now.

- A3000T/040.  Tower A3000 with '040 on a card in the CPU slot, 5 megs of
RAM, and a 200 meg HD.  The '030 and '882 slots are empty.  I couldn't
find out pricing, other than to get an official comment that it would be
"much better" than adding an '040 card to a normal A3000T.

The A4000 and new CDTV add-ons to ship "this quarter" (read what you like
into that), but I was told that it will **DEFINITELY** ship before the end
of the year, come hell or high water.  If you have the dosh sitting in the
bank, you WILL be able to have a AA ChipSet equipped A4000 before
Christmas.  These announcements were made at a local show called the
Multimedia Event (hosted by Commodore and a local dealer).  I had the
scoop on all of them a few days before the show, though I can't reveal my
source.  And I have the scoop on one other (only slightly less official).
AmigaVision 3.0 Professional!  As far as I can discern, this was not an
error on my source's part though I'm trying to validate that he didn't
mean to say 2.0.  Possibly this means there will be an AmigaVision 2.0
'consumer' release.  Your guess is as good as mine.

[Ed. -- I was unable to confirm any of this so I'm leaving it as rumor
except for the A3000T/040 and the A3640 card which are new products.  AV
2.0 may be released with the A4000.]

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   All information on the AA chipset is based on rumors. Commodore has not
announced the new chipset.  A lot of people believe the will make an
announcement in September at the World Of Commodore Show in California,
and at Fall Comdex.

   The rumored specs about the AA chipset are:

25 Bit Color Palette (Extra bit used as Transparency Color (Genlock Use))
256 Color Modes in Most Resolutions
256,000 Extended Ham mode in most resolutions
Double Buffering Feature to allow for faster view of graphics
Larger Sprites with a larger color palette
Sprites can no be Hi-res and independent of the actual screen res.
Main Resolutions are, 320x200/400, 640x200/480, 800x300/600 10??x10??
Can boot with old ECS chips for 100% compatibility

   The only thing I believe 100% so far is that they are indeed working on
the AA chipset and it should be released along with the A4000.

[Ed. --   By the time you read this, the World of Commodore show will be
over and all our suspicions will be confirmed]

A Wing Commander I Demo is available for the Amiga.  It looks like
Mindscape's popular IBM game is being ported.  The opening animations are
well done.  They run smooth and the colors look good.  The titles all look
trashy with too much dithering from the converting of IBM 256 color
palette to the 32 colors they appear to be using on the Amiga.  Once
inside the cockpit, where most of the game will be played, it becomes
evident that over-dithering will play a big part in the graphics.  There
was no sound in the demo I watched but it is my guess that good sound
effects will not make up for the annoying graphics.  If they spend more
time fixing up the colors, I'd say this could be a good port but that lies
in the hands of Mindscape.

The rumored WorkBench 2.1 should be a disk based upgrade using the 2.04
ROMs (2.05 for the A600).  WB 2.1 was officially shown (as beta) at CeBIT
fair in Germany.

NewTek might not be making any more Video Toaster Workstations due to the
long-time tensions between Commodore and NewTek.  Evidently, NewTek no
longer covers the Amiga plate on the front of the machine but that wasn't
enough.  Commodore informed their dealers that if they became NewTek
Workstation dealers, they would be dropped.  Anyway, it looks as if the
last of the Video Toaster Workstations are those left in NewTek's
warehouse.  Remember this only rumor but it would shut up all those shoody
Mac users with Video Toaster Workstations who don't know they own an
Amiga.  It may also have something to due with the Toaster not being
compatible with the new AA chipset...
