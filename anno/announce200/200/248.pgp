PGP/amiga is now available on different sites around the world.
There has been at least 1 other binary of pgp, but thats not
an 'official' release. It did not feature any of the assembler
routines , cause they werent released with the normal pgp
distribution. Pgp/amiga is released as a binary, with all
documentation and a signature to check the integrity of the
binary. The source will be incorporated into the next
pgp distribution (update).

The archive is available on the following sites:

The name is:  PGP20amiga.lha
