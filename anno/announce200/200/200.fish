Disks 681-690 are now available.  Shipment to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by Monday (6/29)

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

	Fred Fish
	Catalog Disk Requests
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, Arizona  85284
	USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other
	sort of proprietary material included, since I then
	have to go examine each file to decide if it is
	distributable or not, and if not, what effect removing
	it might have.

2.	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my
	disks.  I.E, place all files related to a particular
	submission under a single directory on the disk.  If
	there is more than one submission per disk, it's ok to
	to place each submission in it's own directory.

3.	Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing
	that summarizes your submission.  It should be about
	3-10 lines, and include the current version number,
	the version and disk number of the most recent version
	(if any) that was last included in the library, whether
	or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from
	it's subdirectory and if necessary, supply a script
	runnable from workbench (via :c/xicon) that makes all
	necessary assigns, copies fonts and libraries, etc.

5.	Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient
	padding.

Thanks!!!
