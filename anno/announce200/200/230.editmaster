Digital Editmaster

- Full-motion JPEG Technology
- Real-time 30fps Video Capture
- Real-time Video Display & Recording
- Frame-by-frame Recording
- Direct 32 bit Pixel Bus
- Full Screen Non-linear Editing
- SMPTE Time Code Read & Write

The Digital EditMaster system from Digital Micronics,  Inc. allows you to
edit and produce professional quality video productions on your Commodore
A2000 or A3000.  It is the only video editing system for the Amiga that lets
you capture in real time full-screen NTSC, PAL and SVHS video to a standard
Amiga hard drive at 30 frames per second (25  fps for PAL), edit your
production and then output the final results in real time to a standard
video tape recorder.

REAL-TIME VIDEO CAPTURE - DMI's Digital EditMaster system records NTSC, PAL
or SVHS from a video camera or VCR directly to the standard hard disk drive
in the Commodore Amiga.  The heart of the system is the video compression
board which digitizes, compresses and stores video segments onto the hard
drive in real time.

REAL-TIME VIDEO DISPLAY AND RECORDING - DMI's video compression board
decompresses the stored video segments from the hard drive in real time,
delivering full screen, broadcast quality video frames to an NTSC, PAL or
SVHS recorder or monitor.  Making the final master of the production is as
simple as hooking up a VCR or Laser disk recorder and pressing record. 

COMPUTER ANIMATOR'S DREAM COME TRUE - The Digital EditMaster system is a
Computer Animator's  dream come true. Typical animation frames can be
compressed and stored to the hard drive on a frame-by-frame basis. The
animation can then be played back in real time, directly to tape, without
the aid of an expensive frame-by-frame recorder.  Video clips and computer
animations can be combined very easily to produce a final production.

NON-LINEAR EDITING SOFTWARE - Stored video segments can be edited, modified
and played back to tape.  DMl's Digital EditMaster software allows instant
access to any number of video segments stored on the hard drive, giving
complete creative freedom and flexibility to the editor.

THE DMI BUS - Supports the DMI 32-bit pixel bus which allows direct 32-bit
connectivity with DMl's Vivid 24 (TM) graphics co-processor for complete
digital transfer of data to and from the Digital EditMaster compression
board.

AUDIO - The Digital EditMaster system and sound  boards from SunRize
Industries are fully integrated using SMPTE time code for simultaneous
digitizing and editing of  both the audio and video tracks.

Based on full motion JPEG technology, using the LSI Logic chipset, the
Digital EditMaster system works in full screen, real-time NTSC (30 fps), PAL
(25 fps), and SVHS broadcast quality resolutions.  The digital video
compression  board digitizes the analog video signal, from any standard
NTSC, PAL and SVHS format video device, and then compresses the digital
frames to the hard drive in real time.  Video compression ratios are user
selectable, from between 15:1 and 70:1.  Editing is done on an NTSC, PAL, or
15kHz-capable RGB monitor.  The final edited production is decompressed,
encoded back to a composite signal and recorded to any standard NTSC, PAL or
SVHS format video device.
