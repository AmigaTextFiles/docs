Brandnew from the CeBIT 1993 - Commodore presents the A4000T , A4000/030 and
A4091

On this years CeBIT, world's biggest computer and communication fair, held
in  Hannover, Germany, Commodore presents the new high-end machine
Commodore Amiga 4000 T. 
This machine has the same ablilities as it's small brother, the A4000.
But it contains the A4091 SCSI-2 adaptor. (onboard ?)

The long-awaited A4000/030 completes the AA machines in the mid-range.
This machine has all the features as the A4000, but has the MC68EC030
(68030 without MMU) as CPU.

Also long-awaited is the A4091, a full blown SCSI-2 host adaptor for
Zorro-III Slots. This adaptor makes it possible to transfer at max.
20MB synchronous. Yet a hard drive which is capable to transfer this
has to be found... No further specs can be given right now.

--------------------------

For the Slots: (A4000T)
Seems that 5 Slots for Amiga and 4 Slots for ISA are in fact not more than
total 7 Slots, as 2 of the ISA Slots are blocked by 2 Amiga Slots.

_NO_ mentionings about a SECOND Video-Slot for the A4000T.

The tower-case of the A4000T looks like one of the Commodore PC-486-tower-
cases. It has a door which hides the drives. All connectors on the rear
side. The SCSI-2 external connector is compatible to the SCSI-2 connector
of Sun and DEC. 

Note: I can only bring you the specs noted in a broshure given to
      me by Commodore. You should ask your local dealer for more
      information.
