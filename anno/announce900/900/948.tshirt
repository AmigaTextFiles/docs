                         Connect Your Amiga! T-shirts
                              Available from IAM


Drexel Hill, PA (September 15, 1994) Intangible Assets Manufacturing
announces the availability of its "Connect Your Amiga!" T-shirt.  It comes
in 100% black cotton with color star-chart design (from the cover of the
book) and the words "Connect Your Amiga!"

It's a great way for Amiga users to identify themselves and their Amigas as
citizens of cyberspace.  They might even take it to a local T-shirt shop
and have their own email addresses printed on the back!

List price is $19.95 for men's S, M, L and XL (add $2 for XXL or $4 for
XXXL).  The shirt is available directly from IAM and from Amiga dealers
world-wide.  Hirsch & Wolf has recently become a distributor of IAM
products.

COMPANY INFORMATION
IAM now accepts Visa and Mastercard in addition to checks and money orders
in U.S.  dollars.  IAM accepts orders by email, fax, mail and telephone.

split in 215 earlier this year has caused problems for a small percentage
