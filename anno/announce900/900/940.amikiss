DESCRIPTION

	AmiKiss stands for Amiga Kisekae. Kisekae is Japanese for "changing

of popular Japanese Anime/Manga characters and sets of clothes that they 
can try on. Kiss programs have been found already on Mac, PC, and X-window
platforms. AmiKiss is an Amiga implementation for playing Kiss. 
The player can click and drag items of clothing onto the characters displayed
on the screen. Three sample data sets are provided with this archive.
