SHORT

  High-end terrain renderer and animator.


DESCRIPTION

  World Construction Set is a powerful program for rendering photorealistic
  landscapes from USGS DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data or other sources.
  Many types of ground shading and foliage are supported, with spline
  animation, import/export facilities and an elegant non-modal user-
  interface.


FEATURES

General Program Features:
   Uses Magic User Interface -- Amiga User Interface StyleGuide
    compliant
   Provides public screen on user-specified ScreenMode
   Enhanced display board (with Intuition emulation) compatibility
   68000, 68020/68030 and 68040 optimized versions

Import / Export Features:
   IO LightWave motion files
   I  U.S. Geological Survey Digital Line Graphs (USGS DLG)
   I  World Data Bank global vector data
   I  AutoCAD DXF vectors (LINE, POLYLINE, POINT primitives)
   I  USGS 3 arc second ASCII Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
   IO WCS Binary DEM
   IO Future support for Vista binary DEMs
   IO IFF and Sculpt image formats
   IO IFF-ZBUF and raw array Z-Buffer data
   IO Convert between any 2D binary data array and an image/DEM

Mapping Features:
   Extensively configurable algorithmic ecosystem mapping
   Multiple ecosystem types: Water, Bare, Rock, Grass, Conifer,
    Deciduous
   Visual sensitivity (ViewShed) analysis and display
   Summagraphics tablet support (future generic tablet support)

Animation Features:
   Automatic turn banking and lookahead options

   Individual Tension, Continuity and Bias for each spline channel
   Interactive 3D wireframe layout display
   Timeline (motion graph) editing of all splined parameters

Rendering Features:
   24 bit output with 4 bit (16-color) progress display
   Field Rendering for 60fps video output
   Any aspect and resolution up to 32767 x 32767 (memory permitting)
   Detailed 2D trees for realistic vegetation density within
    realistic rendering time-frames
   Supports Z-Buffered background compositing (IFF-ZBUF, Raw array)
