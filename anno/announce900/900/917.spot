DESCRIPTION

     Spot is a FidoNet tosser/editor for points.  It features a

     o Automatically creates new areas for you, no tedious work

     o Optional - fully transparent - message base crunching

     o Message list with powerful functions (e.g. search body text)

     o Excellent support for multiple character sets (LATIN-1, IBM,...)

     o Built-in, fully asynchronous, Fido file request

     o Multi-bossing and multi-domain capable

     o Userlist editor

     o ARexx port (100+ commands)

NEW FEATURES

     o Twitlist!  Automatically get rid of messages written by or to
       certain persons or with a specific subject.

     o Sound!  Add an optional sound to several events (message to you,
       message deleted,...).

     o Improved layout and look of several settings windows.

     o Skip thread function added.

     o Automatic readdressing of netmail.

     o Improved FSC-0035 support.

     o New ARexx commands: `messageadvance', `getkludge' and
       `getusername'.

     o Several ARexx commands have been improved.

     o Includes updated catalogs.

     o Several other smaller enhancements to make your life easier.
