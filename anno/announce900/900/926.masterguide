DESCRIPTION

     When using guides for all programs, it's often confusing where the
     icon for a specfic guide is. This is asuming that you are like me and
     keep all the guides in a place specified by the env:amigaguide/path
     variable.
     It can be recommended to do this and maybe use a compressed
     partition that is optimized for text compression.
     When you have this directory, Masteguide can be put to work. It
     will scan the directory for guide's and if asked, drawers, and put
     them in one big guide. The guide itself will not be included, but
     an amigaguide-link is made.
     The MasterGuide can be made anywhere you want, the full path
     (given as an argument) will be used.
     All guides can then be called from masterguide.
     If asked, masterguide will work recursively through a directory
     structure.

SPECIEAL REQUIREMENTS

     Arexx and rexxsupport.library
     And for the program to be any use, some guides.
