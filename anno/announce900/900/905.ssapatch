TITLE

	SSAPatch

VERSION

	3.14159265358979 (first and only version)

COMPANY

	Not worth mentioning

AUTHOR

	Eyal Teler

	e-mail (not for long): teler@cs.huji.ac.il

DESCRIPTION

     	SSAPatch allows ClariSSA v1.1, given on the July 94
     coverdisk of Amiga Format, to run under Kickstart 1.2.
     
     	Note that you'll get a lot of messages about not having
     ARexx, and won't be able to use a lot of the features the program
     offers.  I don't know if it's like this on all Worbench 1.3
     machines, or perhaps the program is saying to itself "I'm not
     running on Kickstart 1.3, so this must be 2.0 or higher".  You'll
     still be able to convert animations to SSA format.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	ClariSSA v1.1 is needed (or course).
	Kickstart 1.2 is not required, but let's face it, you don't need
       this program if you don't have it (and frankly, you'd be better
       off upgrading it anyway).

HOST

	Aminet, for example on ftp.wustl.edu
	[ I'm not really supposed to use FTP, but hey, it's for a good cause ]

DIRECTORY

	/pub/aminet/biz/patch

FILE NAME

	ssapatch.lzh

PRICE

     	This program is BLAZEware (for lack of a better name).  It's
     free, but if you find it useful, and you're feeling generous, you
     should send the latest version of the BLAZEMONGER archive to my
     snail mail address (since I'll be off the net soon).

     	Users of this program (and others) are also encouraged to
     play the Amber Diceless Role Playing game, and read the Hellrider
     fanzine.
     
DISTRIBUTABILITY

	This program is in the public domain.
