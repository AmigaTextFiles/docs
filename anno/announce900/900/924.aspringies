DESCRIPTION

     ASpringies is a simulator which allows you to interactively create and
     edit a system of masses and springs.  The parameters of the masses and
     springs (such as mass elasticity and spring K) as well as those of the
     surrounding system (such as air viscosity and gravity) can be changed.
     These systems can be loaded and saved into a file.

     I guess you could use ASpringies for real work, but it's really
     intended to be a time waster.

     ASpringies is the Amiga port of the program 'xspringies' by Douglas
     DeCarlo.

     Features:
       - Smooth, double buffered animation
       - Context sensitive hypertext help system
