DESCRIPTION

    At the start of this Formula One season Autosport magazine started
    running a Fantasy Grand Prix competition. FGP2 is a program which
    allows you to avoid at the tedious working out how many places your
    driver gained on his grid position and just how many points did
    Rubens Barrichello score by coming third. FGP2 has a simple command
    line and takes most of its input in the form of human-readable
    ascii files which can be created on any text editor. FGP2 comes
    with all the current driver/team data files required and can handle
    up to 50 different teams. Example files are also included for the
    files you have to create yourself.

UPDATE

    Version 2.03 is an update to version 2.02a. It contains some minor
    bug-fixes and a slight rule change. This distribution also contains
    the results for the German Grand Prix.
