DESCRIPTION

    `phonebill' is, simply said, a log file analyzer. What it basically
    does is scan log file(s) generated by a terminal program or a mailer,
    extract all information about calls you have made by using your modem,
    and store this in its own (short) format. After extracting the calls
    `phonebill' can generate various reports in which you can find
    information on duration and costs of the calls.

    Here is a small list of the main features:

     * Very flexible user-configurable rates, supporting exceptions for
       certain days and dates. Handles fees and time units with up to 9
       decimals (e.g. $1.2344657 dollars per 30.225678 seconds).

     * User-configurable log scanners: `phonebill' by default supports
       various log files, but for any log file that is not supported the
       user is able to create a scanner. The following is a list of log
       files that are already supported:
          * AutoPilot
          * CyberPager
          * GPFax
          * JrComm
          * MagiCall
          * MicroDot
          * Multifax (both v2.0 and Multifax professional)
          * NComm
          * Term action log and Term call log
          * Terminus
          * TheAnswer
          * TKR-BTX
          * Trapdoor
          * Trapfax
          * UUCP TimeLog

     * Log files can be automatically truncated if their size exceeds the
       maximum size.

     * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, ....

     * Context-sensitive online help.

     * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

     * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

     * Nice `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface.

NEW FEATURES

    The following is a list of the most significant changes:

     * Localized.

     * Moved from built-in scanners to user-configurable scanners. The
       only built-in scanner left is `GPFax' (which is binary log file).

     * Improved the rates: extended the limit of 4 decimals for units and
       seconds to 9, support for different rates in different time
       periods, you can enter more than one date in a date exception by
       seperating them using a `|' character, first and second unit have
       made place for a listview in which you can configure as much units
       as you wish.

     * You can set a different carrier detect time for each host, or use
       the default carrier detect time as desired.

     * Support for hosts with more than one phone number by seperating
       the numbers using a `|' character.

     * New user-interface featuring `gtlayout.library' by Olaf `Olsen'
       Barthel. I found this the best compromise between a plain and fast
       gui like the old `phonebill', and a slow but very configurable gui
       like `MUI'.
