TITLE

  CFX - the Crunched File eXaminer


VERSION

  5.533 - New worldwide OS2+ release


AUTHOR

  Bob Rye (bob@miggins.apana.org.au)
  

DESCRIPTION

  CFX is *the* filetype analyser for the Amiga. Developed over
  a period of 4+ years, CFX currently can identify literally
  hundreds of Amiga (and other platform) filetypes. You can
  for instance ask CFX to list all of the executable files on
  your entire harddrive, or maybe only *.lha archives.
  Whatever. CFX acts and runs just like a larger, and more
  intelligent "Dir" or "List" replacement, but is so much more
  useful. Don't let the title "Crunched File eXaminer" fool
  you: this isn't just for crunched files.


HOST NAME

  CFX should be available on all Aminet sites
