DESCRIPTION

   At last there is a product for the Amiga computer where young
   children can have fun learning about music! WindShadow Software has
   introduced "Making Music with Bertie Bunny". This is a product that
   is only available for the Commodore Amiga computer. It fully
   employs the multimedia capabilities of the computer.

   There are many features to enhance your enjoyment:

    - Fun for children of all ages. Even a 2 year old can "Bang Keys"
      to control Bertie. Bertie Bunny will  automatically move from
      place to place on the display. The child can simply bang on the
      keys to cause Bertie to choose an  instrument or tune.
   
      Older children can use the mouse. This makes it quicker to make
      selections and helps them to develop fine motor skills.
   
    - Learn to recognize the sound of various musical instruments.
   
    - Learn to recognize various musical tunes from one or more of 4
      different parts: the melody, a counterpoint to the melody,
      an obbligato  accompaniment or a rhythmic accompaniment.
   
    - Hear how different instruments sound in combination with each
      other.
   
    - Use the computer keyboard as a musical instrument. You can
      select which instrument sounds are to be used and then play
      notes (up to 4 at a time will sound) and see the corresponding
      key-presses on a piano keyboard.
   
    - Readily installs on a hard drive. Installation uses Commodore's
      Installer utility.  The Installer program is supplied
      under license from Commodore.
   
    - Supports the NTSC and PAL video standards and 6 languages.
   
    - Multitasks on the more powerful models of Amiga. Other
      software can run in the background at a low priority, for example,
      3D rendering, compiling large programs, or downloading batches of
      files.

    - the manual is in AmigaGuide format. The AmigaGuide program
      is supplied under license from Commodore.

   This product is unusual in that it is easy to use for children as
   young as 2 years old, while providing creative opportunities for
   older children to explore.
