TITLE

     EditKeys

VERSION

     1.61

AUTHOR

     David Kinder

DESCRIPTION

     EditKeys allows you to edit or create keymap files
     (They are found in the Devs/Keymaps/ directory of the
     boot disk). When you press a key on the Amiga's
     keyboard, the key press is translated by the keymap
     file that the system is using. For instance, British
     Amigas use the keymap 'gb'. Different keymaps can be
     found on the system disks supplied with your Amiga.

     All aspects of a keymap can be changed with EditKeys
     to give either minor or radical alterations; you
     could e.g. redefine the numerical keypad to produce
     strings of up to 255 characters. You can define or
     remove dead keys, modifiable keys, whether keys repeat
     when held down or not, whether Caps Lock causes the
     key's output to be Shifted, etc.

NEW FEATURES

     Changes from 1.5:

     * Enforcer hit removed.
     * New 'Put Char' menu item, which allows the insertion
       of any character into the editing string. This is
       very useful when changing keys to produce characters
       that do not usually appear on keymaps (e.g. characters
       with a numeric value < 32).
     * If 'Create Icons?' selected, when saving a keymap a
       new icon will only be written if an old one does not
       exist.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 1.2 required, Kickstart 2.04 or higher
     recommended. If running Kickstart 1.3 or lower,
     arp.library is required to be in the LIBS: directory.

HOST NAME

     Any Aminet site (e.g. src.doc.ic.ac.uk).

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/util/misc

FILE NAME
