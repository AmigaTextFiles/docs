As you probably know by now, Commodore's liquidation proceedings are taking
place in the Bahamas, where the company is incorporated.  Amiga World
magazine, published by IDG, has sent reporter Tim Walsh there to cover
events.

Given the long lead times for publishing magazines, Tim has made a
recording containing his reports.  You can hear the latest news about
Commodore's liquidation proceedings by calling 800-441-4403 or
603-924-0100.  Ask for extension 365 or the "Commodore Update Line."

I have obtained permission to republish this report.  The latest version is
included at the end of this message.  Thanks to Amiga World for the
permission, and to Carlos for typing it in!

       " Hi, you have reached the Commdore information hotline at Amiga
World.  Today is Thursday, August 4th.

        We know of four groups submitting bids for the Amiga technology.
Samsung Electronics, Phillips Armstrad, Creative Equipment International
and the management team of Commodore UK.  The latter two groups have
expressed intentions of resuming production and develpment of the Amiga
line.  The intentions of the other parties are not known to us.

        About twenty engineers remain at Commodore's engineering facilities
which have been relocated from West Chester to Norristown Pennsylvania.
Both CEI and the management group at Commodore UK plan to maintain the
staff.  We will continue to update this message as conditions warrant.
Also look for an update in the October issue."
