TITLE

VERSION

DESCRIPTION

     SnoopDos patches a variety of AmigaDOS library functions that
     are commonly called by other programs and allows you to monitor
     the activities carried out by those programs.

     For example, you can see what files a program is looking for,
     what fonts it opens, and any special libraries or devices that
     it requires. This is often invaluable when you are trying to
     install a new application which has complex or inadequate
     documentation 

NEW FEATURES

     Many features have been added to SnoopDos since version 1.7.
     Here's a brief list of the most important additions:

       o  Over 20 new system functions are supported
       o  A full GUI provides easy access to all options
       o  The output format can be customised using a new format editor
       o  Output that scrolls off the window can be recalled
       o  Messages sent by ARexx scripts can be monitored
       o  Commodity support lets SnoopDos run in the background
       o  Clipboard support lets you cut and paste output
       o  Programs that use ixemul.library for i/o can be monitored
       o0 A packet debugger lets programmers monitor all DOS packets
       o  Over 100 ARexx commands provide for unattended operation
       o  Online AmigaGuide help covers all aspects of operation

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 2.04 or above is required.

     Some new features work better if the debugging utilities Sushi
     and SegTracker are installed, but these are not essential.

PROGRAM SECURITY

     Several bogus versions of SnoopDos have appeared in the past
     two years. These have been disguised as legitimate updates while
     harbouring trojan horses or other undesirable intruders. The most
     recent such release, labelled 2.0, is still generally available.

     To help guard against this happening in the future, all new
     versions of SnoopDos will be signed using PGP (Pretty Good
     Privacy) by Philip Zimmermann. This allows anyone who is in
     possession of my PGP public key to verify that a particular
     release genuinely came from myself and not from a third party.

     PGP is not required to use SnoopDos; it merely allows you to
     verify that you have a legitimate and unmodified copy. You can
     download PGP from the /pub/aminet/util/crypt directory on
     Aminet. The filename is PGPAmiga2_3a.lha.

     My PGP public key is presented below for convenience. This key
     will work with all future releases of SnoopDos.
     
     If you have installed PGP, save this announcement to a file and
     then type "PGP <filename>" to install my key on your PGP keyring.
     You can then verify the integrity of SnoopDos by extracting the
     SnoopDos archive and typing "PGP Readme.first SnoopDos". See the
     PGP documentation for more ynformation on verifying signatures.
     
     Note that my public key is never included with the main SnoopDos
     archive -- if it was, then anyone modifying the program could
     also modify the key and escape undetected.
