DESCRIPTION:

        Grapevine is an Amiga Internet Relay Chat client.  The IRC
    is a worldwide network on which users can participate in realtime
    conversation.  Grapevine is a means by which to communicate over
    this network using an attractive, easy to use graphic interface
    that befits the nature of the Amiga.
        Grapevine supports several methods of communication.  You
    may use one of the TCP/IP stacks:  Commodore's AS225r2 or the
    freely distributable AmiTCP.
        Grapevine also support any serial.device compatible device
    by means of a simple Unix network connection utility and a small
    terminal program to log in and connect to the server, and pass
    control to Grapevine.

    - Over 50 input line commands with online syntax help.
      Modular DCC programs allow users to write their own DCC
    - clients, including games.  DCC file transfer modules included.

    - Ability to automatically join channels when first connecting
    - Attractive "Style Guide" compliant graphic user interface.

    - Text clipping and pasting
    - Command aliases
    - NOTIFY command to periodically check for signon/signoff of
