DESCRIPTION
	KingFisher 2.1, the successor to the popular KingFisher 1.40,
	a disk catalog tool originally aimed at Fred Fish's Amiga
	Library collection, but now capable of a more general purpose
	format, real multi-user capabilities, and a lot more.

	KingFisher began as a tool to catalog, maintain, and search
	Fred Fish's AmigaLibrary disks ("Fish Disks.")  It has been
	redesigned into a multi-purpose, multi-user, multi-database
	cataloging tool capable of delivering detailed information on
	software using Fred Fish's new Product-Info Specification.  As
	such, it can be used to catalog not only the Fish Disks, but
	your club's selection of software, as well, even the contents
	of Aminet itself.

PRE-RELEASES (KingFisher 2.0)
	Pre-release versions of KingFisher 2.0 have been available
	since March on Fred's FreshFish, FrozenFish, and GoldFish
	CD-ROMs, but only now has the program achieved the envisioned
	set of features that make a first public release feasible.

FEATURE OVERVIEW
	KingFisher 2.1, the product of nearly 20 test releases over a
	beta test period of three months, offers some of the following
	capabilities (features marked with {*} are new or
	significantly improved over the older KingFisher 1.40):

	{*} -	Fully resizable GadTools interface operating on the
		default public screen; uses the default screen font
		(even if proportional) for all menus, gadgets, and
		displayed text.

	{*} -	Multiple copies of KingFisher 2 can operate
		simultaneously, using a minimum of additional RAM
		overhead through the use of Client-Server technology.

	{*} -	Multiple copies of a supplied program, RexxFisher,
		provide ARexx ports at the cost of approximately 25K
		per client.  This contrasts sharply with achieving the
		same goal with KingFisher 1.40 where the cost was 350K
		for a complete, secondary copy of KingFisher.

	{*} -	Supplies any number of independently accessible
		databases to multiple clients (such as KingFisher,
		RexxFisher, etc.)

	{*} -	Search Sets can be built (as well as saved and
		restored) to select from a list of matching software
		that a previous search produced.  Matching records are
		listed and can be selected for instant viewing through
		a standard listview.

	{*} -	Any number of search expressions are memorized by
		KingFisher 2 and can be recalled at the press of a
		button to save typing.

	{*} -	The layout of information used for the display,
		printing, and exporting can be re-defined to suit
		individual taste or need.

	{*} -	Uses locale.library and comes supplied with Dansk,
		Deutsch, Nederlands, and Suomi language catalogs.
		More are expected.

	    -	Context sensitive and fully integrated AmigaGuide(R)
		documentation.

	    -	Includes a complete, ready-to-use database of
		descriptions for Fish Disks 1-1000!

REQUIREMENTS
	RAM requirements are less than for KingFisher 1.40 and merely
	a fraction thereof when multiple copies are run: approximately
	200K.  Also required is Kickstart V37 (2.04) but V38 (2.1) is
	required for localization.

COMPATIBILITY
	Tested with 68000 through 68040 CPUs, V37, V38, V39, and V40
	system software, Picasso II graphics board.  Enforcer and
	Mungwall used during testing.

HOSTS
     Any AMINET site such as:  ftp.wustl.eduinet: 

DIRECTORY
     fish/docs/

FILENAME
     KingFisher21.lha (759K)

PRICE
	KingFisher 2.1 is shareware and costs $20(US) or DM30.  A
	registration site in Germany is available for European users.
	The unregistered version is limited to two simultaneously
	running clients (KingFisher or RexxFisher.)
