As you probably know by now, Commodore's liquidation proceedings are taking
place in the Bahamas, where the company is incorporated.  Amiga World
magazine, published by IDG, has sent reporter Tim Walsh there to cover
events.

Given the long lead times for publishing magazines, Tim has made a
recording containing his reports.  You can hear the latest news about
Commodore's liquidation proceedings by calling 800-441-4403 or
603-924-0100.  Ask for extension 365 or the "Commodore Update Line."

I have obtained permission to republish this report.  The latest version is
included at the end of this message.  Thanks to Amiga World for the
permission.

"Hi, This is Dan Sullivan editor of Amiga World. It's Tuesday, August 16th.

        Many People have called over the last few days to say they've heard
that the Commodore UK management team has officially bought Commodore.
This is not true, although the UK group, led by David Pleasance, has
submitted a serious bid to buy and run the entire company.  I have spoken
with David Pleasance on a number of occasions recently including yesterday
evening and he assured me that Amiga World will be the first to know if his
group succeeds in acquiring the company.  Timewise his best guess is that a
decision won't come until after the Labor Day weekend.  Therefore I most
likely will NOT be updating this message until then.  Meanwhile, other bids
from CEI, Philips/Amstrad and Samsung are still on the table although the
last two groups seem to have backed away a little recently.  We will keep
you updated, probably with an update after the Labor Day weekend.  Thanks
now, Bye bye."
