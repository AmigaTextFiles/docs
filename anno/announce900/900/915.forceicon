DESCRIPTION

     ForceIcon is an utility mainly for users of CDRom drives
     or users of networking software capable of sharing devices
     and icons. Since one can not snapshot the position of a
     volume`s icon (on read only media), nor replace it by a
     user-defined one, I wrote this utility. ForceIcon allows
     you to set the position of a disk`s icon and/or replace
     it by a different image/icon which doesn`t have to be a
     disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may be selected.
     Special features include inheritance of device specific
     settings, specifying the root drawer`s size/position
     and display flags/modes.

NEW FEATURES

     - Using ForceIcon you may even "SnapShot" Disk icons now.
       Use SnapShot and then select SAVE from the Prefs program

     - No more quit requesters will be shown
       (Requested by : Bernhard Moellemann)

     - You may now even enter relative coordinates (relative to
       Workbench Screen`s width/height) for the icon`s position.
       This is accomplished through negative values for
       IconX/IconY
       (Requested by : Bernhard Moellemann)

     - IconPosition window is smaller now
       (Requested by : Bernhard Moellemann)

     - Sort routine could create enforcer hits!

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Only OS 2.x and up
     MUI (MagicUserInterface) version 7 (MUI 2.0)
