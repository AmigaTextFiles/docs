TITLE

         MultiTool II

VERSION

         V2.0d

AUTHOR

         Boris Jakubaschk
         (Boris@alice.tynet.sub.org)

DESCRIPTION

         MTool provides all standard features of a directory utility:
         You can use it to copy, move and delete files, analyze a file
         type and perform an action on it (i.e. show pictures or ani-
         mations, play mods, edit texts...).

         MTool handles LHA-archives like ordinary directories. You can
         doubleclick the name of a LHA-archive and its contents will
         be displayed in the filelist. Files can be deleted or copied
         to and from the archive.

         The layout of MTool resembles the good old DiskMaster (V1.4).

         MTool has been developed using the look and feel of OS2.04
         and WB2.1. It works with WB2.0 (not localized, no screen mode
         requester); KS1.3 is not supported any more. It can be run on
         an own screen, a public screen or on the Workbench (resizable,
         position and size can be configured).

         Docs and/or catalogs are included in English, German, Swedish,
         French, Norwegian, Danish and Italian.

NEW FEATURES

         V2.0d:
         - Some bugfixes (crash on ESC-Hide, garbled devicelist)
         - French manual
         - improved French catalogs

DISTRIBUTABILITY

         MTool is shareware. It is freely distributable, as long as
         you distribute all files! Feel free to include it in public
         domain collections (i.e. fishdisks).

REQUIREMENTS

         Workbench 2.04 or higher

         To use the archive support of MTool, you need any version of
         the LHA archiver (not included)

         To view pictures or animations, to play mods etc you need
         programs that can be included in the configuration of MTool. 
         (i.e. VT, Player...)

         To install MTool with its installation script, you need the
         commodore installer (not included)
