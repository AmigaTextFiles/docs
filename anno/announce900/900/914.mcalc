DESCRIPTION

          MUIProCalc is a MUI-based calculator much like Jimmy Yang`s
     Calc 3.0.  It still lacks the plotter, but it offers a quite
     flexible history facility for inserting previously entered
     expressions.  Different output formats offered and plenty of
     functions the user may choose from.  Furthermore the look of the
     calculator may be customized.  ARexx Port for ease of
     calculating from within an editor.  Some functions are able to
     return TeX compatible output.  Results or inputs may be copied
     to the Clipboard.

          MUIProCalc comes with a fancy GUI you may configure to your
     needs.  Function gadgets may be flipped through using pages so
     that they don`t eat up too much of space.  MUIProCalc supports
     an input/output history you may configure so that you may
     re-insert previously entered expressions/results.  History
     entries may be copied to a userdefiniable clipboard unit.  It
     features various display/output bases such as decimal,
     hexadecimal, octal, and binary and of course calculation sizes
     ranging from 8 Bit to 32 Bit width.  Angles may be displayed as
     radians or degrees.  MUIProCalc offers an ARexx port you may use
     to calc expressions externally.  These commands are able to
     return TeX compatible output such as "1\cdot 10^{-5}".  It comes
     with two example scripts for use with CED Pro.

     NEW FEATURES

     - This version fixes some bugs, which are :

      - MCalc didn`t even care about Percent calculations
      - atan() wasn`t definied for some ranges (somehow)
      - The InputString will be default object now
      - Recompiled with Scanner generated by flex 2.4.6
