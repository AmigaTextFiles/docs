DESCRIPTION

    HWGRCS is a port of GNU RCS 5.6.0.1 done with SAS/C 6.51.

    The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
    of  files.   RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
    identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
    text that is revised frequently, for example programs, docu-
    mentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

    Special features:

        - File pattern and response file expansion in all RCS commands.
        - Support for .a,.ag,.asm,.fd,.guide,.i,.mod,.ps extensions.
        - GNU DIFF 2.6, GNU patch 2.1 and a N*rton like LP utility.
        - AmigaGuide. docs.
        - I try to _support_ HWGRCS (See the docs).


NEW FEATURES

    Bugs fixed since patch level 10:

    - rcsfreeze works with long logs
    - $VER$ should never again give problems with repositories


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    >=V37, >1MB suggested, HD required.


HOST NAME

    Any Aminet site, e.g. ftp.uni-paderborn.de   (131.234.2.32) for users
    in germany. Please use the site that is closest to you.


DIRECTORY

    /pub/aminet/dev/misc

FILE NAMES

    HWGRCSp11f.lha      Binaries and full AmigaGuide. docs
    HWGRCSsrcp11f.lha   The sources
    HWGRCSmanp7f.lha    The ASCII unix man pages for RCS (Note: _7_!)

PRICE

    I don't declare it shareware as it is Gnu SW, but donations/gifts for
    my support are quite welcome! Donations in physical form preferred.
    Support ~ Gifts, especially for commercial users.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

    RCS is distributable under the Gnu Public License.

    For my support of HWGRCS I won't bill you, but I ask for donations. The
    work invested into creating distributions hasn't exactly paid of.
