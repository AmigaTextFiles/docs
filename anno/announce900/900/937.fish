==================
FRESHFISH CD-ROM's
==================

The Sep/Oct FreshFish CD's went into production on Sep 16th and are now
shipping.  We are sold out of all previous FreshFish CD's, except for about
200 of the Mar/Apr edition.

For various reasons, we have decided to start issuing the FreshFish CD's
with volume numbers, retroactively naming the first one (Oct 93) as volume
1, the second one (Dec 93) as volume 2, etc.  Thus the Sep/Oct CD is volume
6 and the Nov/Dec CD will be volume 7.  Starting with volume 8, due in early
January 1995, we will drop the publishing date as part of the name of each
FreshFish CD.

The next FreshFish CD will be volume 7 (Nov/Dec) and is expected to go into
production in the last week of October, in time to go on sale at the World
Of Commodore show in Cologne Germany on Nov 4th.

==============================
GOLDFISH & FROZENFISH CD-ROM's
==============================

Due to the very favorable feedback we got from users about the Apr-94
GoldFish 2-CD set containing all 1000 floppy disks in both archived and
unarchived form, we have decided to merge the GoldFish and FrozenFish series
into a single series of CD-ROM's, that will continue to be 2-CD sets
containing all material in both forms, and will be called GoldFish.

The Apr-94 GoldFish will retroactively become volume 1 of this new series,
followed by volume 2, to go into production in late October in time to go on
sale at the World Of Commodore show in Cologne Germany.  Users who have
already preordered future copies of the FrozenFish CD will have their orders
automatically converted to GoldFish preorders, and will be able to look
forward to getting 2-CD sets rather than single CD's, at approximately 6
month intervals.

GoldFish Volume 1 will continue to be the definitive archive of the first
1000 disks in my floppy library, and these disks will not be duplicated on
future GoldFish releases.  GoldFish Volume 2 will contain selected material
from the previous releases of FreshFish CD's, starting with the most recent
release and working backwards, up to the limit of what will fit on a 2-CD
set.

============
LIGHT-ROM CD
============

In cooperation with Lightwave artist Michael Meshew, we will be offering a
new CD in early November, called "LIGHT-ROM".  This is a 400 Mb CD-ROM
dedicated to 3D artists all over the world, and will contain Lightwave
objects, scene files, textures, bump maps (JPEG, TFF, & TARGA), fonts,
thumbnail renderings, and text files with advice from the rendering pros.
It will also contain a "Showcase Directory", displaying the talents of
selected Lightwave artists from all over the world.

LIGHT-ROM will be updated at approximately 6 month intervals.  Contributors
will be eligible for a free copy.  The retail price will be $39.95 plus
$3.95 for shipping and handling.

=============
FRESHFONTS CD
=============

In cooperation with fonts enthusiast Daniel Amor, we will be publishing a
new fonts CD in late October.  This CD will be published under conditions
similar to the Meeting Pearls CD, whereby users that find the CD interesting
and useful are expected to make a shareware like donation to the creators of
the CD.  This CD will be distributed free of charge to people that order one
or more other CD's from us that are shipped during the rest of 1994, for as
long as supplies of the FreshFonts CD last.  We expect to directly
distribute at least 1000 copies of this CD.

The FreshFonts CD will also be available at the World Of Commodore show in
Cologne, free to customers at Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe, or available at
a small charge for non-customers.

==============
TURBOCALC V2.0
==============

We are an authorized U.S. distributor of TurboCalc V2.0, a very powerful
Amiga spreadsheet program.  TurboCalc has extensive formatting options,
supports many different font formats, more than 40 different number, time,
and date formats, more than 100 functions covering arithmetic and financial
needs, more than 120 ARexx and macro instructions, integrated database, and
more.  TurboCalc retails for $115 plus $6.95 for shipping and handling.

===================
NEW AMINET CD-ROM's
===================

We are an authorized U.S. distributor of the new Aminet CD.  Both the Aminet
Gold and the Aminet Share are available.  Subscriptions for both CD's are
also available, at $59.95 per year for the Gold version and $44.95 for the
Share version.  There are expected to be four releases per year, so the
subscription is actually for 4 CD's, regardless of when they actually end up
shipping.

The only physical difference between the Aminet Gold CD and the Aminet Share
CD is the front cover artwork.  Built into the price of the Aminet Gold CD
is an automatic contribution to the creators of the CD and sufficient margin
to make the disk attractive to low volume resellers and retail sales
outlets.  Users who purchase to the Aminet Share version are expected to
make their own contributions directly to the creators if they feel that the
CD is worthwhile and wish to support creation of future Aminet CD's.

We currently have Volume 3 (July 1994) in stock.  Volume 4 (Nov 1994) is
expected to start shipping in early November.

=====================
MEETING PEARLS CD-ROM
=====================

We expect to have the second pressing of the Meeting Pearls CD in stock in
early October.  This CD contains about 150 high quality and high resolution
fractals, a ready to run version of PasTeX which includes fonts for FAX and
600 DPI printers, a ready to install version of the Amiga NetBSD port, and
many other ready to run applications including UMS, DaggeX, a lot of
utilities, games, etc.

Because the version of NetBSD expected to be included on the CD-ROM includes
encryption code that is restricted for U.S export, all imported CD's will
only be available for resale within the U.S.

=================================
SPECIAL BBS VERSION OF FROZENFISH
=================================

By special request from BBS operators, we are issuing a limited number of a
custom version of the April 1994 FrozenFish CD, updated with some new
material, and called "FrozenFish-PC".  This CD has the complete contents of
each floppy disk 1-1000 in a single archive and all directory and file names
are ISO-9660 level 1 compliant (8.3 format, uppercase only, etc).  This
means that the CD is completely compatible with IBM-PC based systems, unlike
our regular Amiga CD's which are closer to ISO-9660 level 2.

Until the actual demand is known, each copy of this CD is an individually
created CD-R "gold disk", which is completely compatible with mass
production CD's and CD-ROM drives.  If there is sufficient demand for the
CD, then there will be a small production run made and people who received
the CD-R versions can upgrade to the production version for $5 plus shipping
costs.  The price of this CD is $24.95 for either version, because of the
lower volumes and thus higher production costs per CD.

=====================
ATTENTION ALL AUTHORS
=====================

Amiga Library Services is actively looking to expand our CD-ROM offerings.
If you are an Amiga user with a good idea for an Amiga specific CD-ROM,
please consider letting us act as your publisher.  We will handle all
details concerning actual production of the CD-ROM, advertising, sales, and
distribution.  All you have to do is have a good idea and to be willing to
spend the necessary time to create a ready-to-publish master file tree for
the CD.

===========================
FUTURE FLOPPY DISK RELEASES
===========================

Floppy disks after disk 1000 will be produced by Amazing Computing (PIM
Publications) using material from each FreshFish CD.  We are expecting
delivery any time of the first batch of floppy disks after 1000, and these
floppies will be included on the next available FreshFish CD.  Contact PIM
Publications directly for further information (1-800-345-3360 voice,
1-508-675-6002 FAX).

======================
ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS
======================

Material for inclusion in the CD-ROM distribution can now be submitted
electronically via anonymous ftp.  Please upload your submissions as an lha
archive, one archive per submitted program, to the ftp incoming directory on
ftp.amigalib.com.  Please include a "Product-Info" file in the lha archive.
This file describes the material using a standard format that is recognized
by the new version of KingFisher and by tools that we use to automatically
generate information about the CD contents.  If you don't have a copy of the
Product-Info specification, it can be retrieved via anonymous ftp from
ftp.amigalib.com, in directory pub/amiga.

If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can still submit material
electronically by mailing a uuencoded lha archive to
"submissions@amigalib.com".

=================
ELECTRONIC ORDERS
=================

You can email orders to be paid via credit card (VISA or MasterCard only) to
"orders@amigalib.com".  All such orders must include the full name of the
card holder, the card number, the expiration date, and a daytime phone
number which can be used to verify the order.  We will attempt to
acknowledge all such received orders via return email, and to verify an
unspecified percentage via phone calls.

Please note that it is considered to be somewhat risky to send credit card
information via electronic mail without encrypting it.  We are not currently
ready to start receiving encrypted orders, but may be able to do so in the
future.  We cannot be responsible for any fraudulent use of credit card info
that is intercepted by a third party during it's transmission.
