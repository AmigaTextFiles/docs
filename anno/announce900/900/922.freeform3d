DESCRIPTION:
    
    FreeForm 3D Bspline modeler brings truly affordable,
    superfast Bspline modeling to your current 3D program
    rivaling that of high end workstations.  FreeForm can output
    to Lightwave, Aladdin4D, Real3D2, Imagine and Caligari.
    (POV and Rayshade are currently being added) FreeForm has
    realtime object and point editing in all views; and a
    real-time, 3D space, through the camera perspective view.
    In addition to the standard 3D tools, FreeForm has tension
    adjustment to Bsplines(giving NURB like control),
    deformations, rail extrusion, morph extrusion, cross
    sectional skinning, automatic Bones creation, real-time
    Bones manipulation and on-line help.  FreeForm even gives
    Real3D2 users a faster, easier to use Bspline environment.
