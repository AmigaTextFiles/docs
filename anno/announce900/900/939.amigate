DESCRIPTION

     Basically AmiGate will convert your UUCP news/emails into FidoNet
     echomail/netmail and the other way around. That's it.

     Short feature list:

      o Public or private gating.
      o Fully FidoNet FTS/FSC compliant.
      o Direct support for DLG user.data.
      o Mailing list -> Echomail conversion.
      o Crossposting can be ignored. (Eg. only posted to the first
        matching area.)
      o MIME-support (also for quoted-printable).
      o Will not post to moderated areas but instead send email to
        moderator.
      o FidoNet bouncing. Will inform sender if something goes wrong.
      o Optional accounting for emails.
      o Total customization of how to port the headers in UUCP
        messages.

     Even if you don't have a FidoNet address, using it together with
     Spot (a very nice FidoNet editor by Nico Francois) is a pleasing
     alternative to the mail and news readers available on the Amiga.
     (Please note that this is my personal opinion ;-)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     o Kickstart 37.175 or higher.

     o AmigaUUCP v1.17 or higher. 1.16 will work but generates dubious
       headers.
        All binaries, sources, and man pages for 1.17b4 are available
        for anonymous ftp from Hopper.ITC.Virginia.EDU:/pub/amiga and
        for BMS from adastra.cvl.va.us.

     o traplist.library version 4 or higher.
        ftp.luth.se:pub/aminet/comm/fido/TL_LIB.lzh

     o FidoNet editor/tosser of your choice. Spot recommended for
       private use.
        ftp.luth.se:pub/aminet/comm/fido/Spot13.lha

     o Probably won't be of much use without a modem.
