DESCRIPTION

    `Phonebill' is, simply said, a logfile analyser. What it basically
    does is scan the logfile(s) generated by a terminal program or a
    mailer, extract all information about calls you have made by using
    your modem, and store this in its own (short) format. Features:

    * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

    * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

    * Nice gadtools compliant GUI.

    * User-definable callrates, supporting  rate exceptions for certain
      days and dates. Handles fees and time-units with up to 4 decimals
      (e.g.  $1.2344 dollars per 30.5678 seconds) for extra accuracy.

    * Supports logfiles generated by:
         * AmigaUUCP Timelog
         * AutoPilot
         * GPFax
         * JrComm
         * MagiCall
         * MicroDot
         * MultiFax professional
         * NComm
         * Terminus
         * TKR-BTX
         * TrapDoor
         * TrapFax
         * Term (Term action-log and Term call-log)

    * Automatical logfile truncating.

    * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, etc.

    * Context-sensitive online help.


NEW FEATURES

    * When adding calls using the maintenance panel the date is
      automatically set to the current date instead of 01-jan-78.

    * Added GPFax support.

    * Bugfix: dupe-detection failed sometimes.

    * AutoPilot problem fixed: only sessions ending with "End of
      Session" were recognized.
