   DESCRIPTION

        AmyGUI is a C++ class library for creating font sensitive 
        graphical user interfaces easily.  It contains efficient code 
        and the created sources are quite verbal and understandable.  To 
        create an executable, the library is linked with user code to a 
        standalone executable with SAS C++ V6.5x, with GCC 
        ixemul.library is needed at runtime.  

        AmyGUI makes the use of gadgets simple, e.g.  the contents of a 
        listview and a cycle gadget are manipulated in the same way, 
        although their implementation in the system is quite different.  
        With just one function call AmyGUI enables icon dropping into a 
        window.  Each time user gives input, a prenamed function in user 
        code gets called with descriptive parameters.  

        If you know C, just by looking at the demo sources included in 
        the packet, you will see why C++ is the ideal language for 
        GUIs.  
        
        Features
        
        	* Font sensitivity
        		- All buttons are created as if they will
        		  contain a 8 pixel font, and AmyGUI
        		  takes care of the rest at runtime
        
        	* A window can receive an icon dropped into it, the
        	  enabling takes only one function call
        
        	* All different types of gadgets are created in the same
        	  manner, only the last one or two optional parameters
        	  vary if needed
        	
        	* Dynamic menu creation and handling. Menu layout can be
        	  changed easily at runtime.
        
        	* The strings contained in Menus, AmyListviews and
        	  AmyCycles can be added, inserted and deleted dynamically
        	  at runtime
        
        	* Wide code reuse due to C++'s inheritance making the
        	  executable size smaller
        
        	* Lots of useful classes not only for creation of GUIs
        	  e.g. AmyList, Dimension, Boolean, AmyPoint...
        
        	* Online manual containing class reference, examples and
        	  hints
        

   PRICE

        AmyGUI V1.0 costs FIM 300 or USD 55.  There is a 50% discount 
        for students (send us a copy of your valid studentcard).  

        The prices are subject to change without notice.  Appropriate 
        postage is added on top of the price.  Bugfixes are free, but 
        the updates cost moderately.  

        Inside Europe we are able to send you the package with 'cash on 
        delivery', but unfortunately it is not possible to outside of 
        Europe. So other customers will have to transfer their money in 
        advance.  Contact us for further information.  This packet 
        contains an orderform in binary form.  You can send it filled on 
        paper by mail or fax, or by email to one of the addresses 
        below.  

   SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        Because AmyGUI uses BOOPSI (for now), it needs at least 
        Kickstart 2.x.  

   HOSTNAME

        ftp.funet.fi and Aminet hosts.  

   DIRECTORY
        
        Aminet: /pub/aminet/dev/gui	( for example wuarchive.wustl.edu)
        ftp.funet.fi: ?
        

   FILENAME

   CORRECTION

        The readme of the demopacket should say that the idea was 
        concieved in July 1993, not 1994.
