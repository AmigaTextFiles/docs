DESCRIPTION

        LharcUUCP is a small tool to speed your uucico transfers up.
     uucico's performance goes down, when you have to transfer plenty of
     small files, like e-mail and the corresponding description file.
     Larger files, however, are transferred at satisfying speed and
     efficiency--at least with a larger block size.

        The idea is to batch all your e-mail and to transfer this large
     file rather than all of them separately. Additionally, this larger
     file can be crunched much better than the smaller ones. Ideas like
     this are available for several years now, namely BSMTP or RSMTP.

        But these methods have one significant disadvantage: Once, the
     mails are batched, you can't add any files anymore! This means,
     that you can't run the batcher several times a day without having
     several smaller files again. And if you batch only a few times a
     day, you're stuck with certain poll-times.

        "So," I thought, "why not use lharc or any similar archiver?"
     These archivers can crunch the data very well and they can still
     add files at a later time. Additionally, lzh-archives are
     understood on virtually every platform.

        This is what LharcUUCP does! It scans your spool directory for
     queued jobs and archives them into one file using lharc. Currently,
     only mail- and news jobs are processed. Future versions might batch
     UUCP file transfers, too. Then an appropriate command-
     (`X.system*') and description file (`D.systemX*') is created--to
     tell uucico what to do with the archive.

        In case, such an archive already exists when LharcUUCP is
     issued, it adds the new jobs to that archives, *not* creating a
     second file to transfer!

        On the other side of the transfer, an uuxqt that recognizes the
     new job-type `rlharc' is required.
