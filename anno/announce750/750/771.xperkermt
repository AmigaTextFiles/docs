TITLE

    XPR Kermit

VERSION

    2.36

AUTHOR
    Frank da Cruz, Columbia University (system-independent code)
    Stephen R. Walton, swalton@csun.edu (XPR sections)

DESCRIPTION

    XPR Kermit Version 2.36 is the latest release of the Kermit file
transfer protocol implemented as an Amiga External Protocol (XPR).  As
an XPR, it can be used by an XPR-supporting program by simply copying
the file xprkermit.library to your LIBS: directory.

NEW FEATURES

    XPR Kermit Version 2.36 is a bug-fix release of XPR Kermit Version
2, announced in this forum a couple of weeks ago.  The problem repaired
is one which resulted in corrupt setup strings being written as the
XPRKERMIT environment variable from Term and possibly other programs.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

    The Kermit file transfer protocol is copyrighted by Columbia
University.  Under the terms of the copyright, Kermit can be freely
distributed but not sold.  It can be included as part of a commercial
package, provided that such inclusion does not increase the cost of
that package.

SPECIAL NOTE

    My USENET feed is down as a result of the January 17 earthquake,
so questions regarding XPR Kermit which cannot be answered by the
comp.sys.amiga.datacomm community should be addressed to me by e-mail.
