  "The Boston Computer Society, Inc. is a nonprofit, educational organization
  dedicated to furthering the general public's understanding and knowledge
  about personal computers."  --BCS Magazine masthead

  The BCS has been described as the largest personal computer user group in
  the world.  Though most of its members are in the greater Boston area,
  there is a sizable number of members around the U.S./Canada and beyond.

  The BCS Amiga group is one of fifty interest groups that meet regularly
  (usually monthly) to share experience, assist "newbies", and stay
  current with the developments in their respective areas.

  The BCS has recently moved its main office from Cambridge to Waltham, MA.
  I've been asked to announce its new location and to post the BCS Amiga
  Group's monthly schedule.  Since this is MegaMeeting week, I'm posting
  information about that event also.


  New Location:
    BCS Waltham Office and Resource Center
    101 First Avenue, Suite 2
    Waltham, MA
    617/290-5700
    From the Mass Pike, take I95/128 north to Exit 27B and follow
    signs to First Avenue (to the right of Guest Quarters Hotel).
