TITLE

     FPL -- a script/macro programming language.

VERSION

     7.0

DESCRIPTION

     FPL is an interpreting script/macro language shared library, designed
     to be flexible and easy inserted in any code.

     FPL is a complete script programming language _very_ similar to C. If
     you are a software developer and plan to add any kind of macro/script
     control, consider the FPL alternative!

     The library lets the software programmer define functions that FPL
     should accept. The library will call a function in the software
     whenever any of these functions are used in an FPL program.

     FPL is distributed with extensive documentation and full source code. It
     has been successfully compiled under a large number of operating systems,
     in most of them as shared library.

     Features include:

     o Full ANSI C syntax statements with semicolon separations.

     o String, integer/long, char and short variables, including
       multidimensional arrays.

     o 100% ANSI C operator precedence and expression syntax.

     o C and C++ style comments. Optionally nested comments.

     o A subset of the ANSI C function declaration and prototyping syntax and
       concepts. The use of functions is exactly as C.

NEW FEATURES

     o A few, more or less sever, bugs removed.

     o Enhanced documentation structure.

     o [SunOS] GCC compiles should work.

     o switch() - extended C functionality. Handles strings and dynamic
       case expressions.

     o [Amiga] Funclibs: FPL now supports functions added by external third
       party programs. Add compiled functions to any host using fpl.library.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Amiga version requires at least AmigaDOS version 1.3 and runs fine on
     systems featuring 512KB and even less!

HOSTNAME

    Any Aminet site such as ftp.luth.se 
          (and also available by emailing the author).

DIRECTORY

    The file is named fpl70.lha, and resides in the
    /pub/aminet/dev/lang/ directory.

PRICE

     Free.
