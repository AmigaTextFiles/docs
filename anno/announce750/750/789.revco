SHORT

     A very simple yet flexible revision bumper for C

FEATURES

     RevCo is a small utility to control versions and revisions of C
programs.  It can be run from the shell only and looks a lot like all
the other revision bumpers already available.

     Why would you use RevCo instead of any other revision bumper?
Well...  RevCo is a very simple yet flexible utility that has all the
features I like in a revision bumper.

     It generates an include file (.h) in which it stores the following
information about a C program :

   - name string
   - version number
   - revision number
   - compilation number
   - subrevision character
   - stage (alpha, beta, public)
   - date string
   - time string
   - AmigaDOS version string

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - AmigaOS Release 2.04 (V37+)
