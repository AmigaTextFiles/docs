NAME

    MUI Fido File Request 1.2

DESCRIPTION

    MUI Fido File Request is a GUI for selecting files from a filelist,
    which almost every Fidonet mailbox provides for download.

    The list of selected files is written to a .REQ-file in your
    outbound directory.

    The next time you call up your Fido Boss these files are
    automatically downloaded by your Fidonet communications software.

CHANGES

    1.0 Initial release (23.01.94)

    1.1 (17.02.94)

    1.2 (16.04.94)

    - display of telephone charges, sum of sizes of all selected files
      in bytes and expected duration of transmission
      (suggested by Stefan Gybas)
    - two new environment variables MUIFFR/Outbound and MUIFFR/Config
      (suggested by Klaus Melchior)
    - bug removed: Filenames and passwords containing spaces inside of a
      .REQ file are not split in several parts any longer when loaded
      (reported by Matthias Scheler)
    - enforcer hit removed (WORD-READ), which appeared sometimes during
      startup
    - After a successful search the filelist listview gadget in automatically
      made the active object of the main window.
      (suggested by Stefan Gybas)
    - .REQ files, if present, are loaded from now on everytime the user
      selects a different alias.
