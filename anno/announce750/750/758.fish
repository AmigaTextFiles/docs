------------------
FRESHFISH CD-ROM's
------------------

At this point I am completely sold out on the first (Oct 93) and second (Dec
93) FreshFish CD-ROM's.  The third FreshFish CD (Mar/Apr 94) started shipping
on Mar 14th and I still have sufficient stock of these CD's to meet the
anticipated demand for the next month or two.  The next FreshFish CD will be
the May/June 94 issue, and is expected to go into production during the second
week of May and start shipping by about May 15th.

-------------------
FROZENFISH CD-ROM's
-------------------

The first FrozenFish CD-ROM was completed on Mar 30th, however has not yet
been released to production.  This CD contains over 6000 archives, including
the complete archived contents of floppy disks 1-975, all of the GNU and other
useful utilities off the latest FreshFish CD, and all of the new material on
the first three FreshFish CD's that was not included in the floppy library.
In summary, this CD currently contains everything I have ever released on
floppy or CD, except for the final 25 floppy disks.

Since we are now only a few days away from completing work on the final 25
floppy disks, we decided to put a hold on production of the FrozenFish CD
while we complete disks 976-1000 and integrate them into both the FrozenFish
CD and the GoldFish CD.  As soon as the floppy disks are complete on about Apr
7th, they will be integrated first into the master tree for the FrozenFish CD
and then the master tree for the GoldFish CD.  The updated FrozenFish CD
should be ready to go into production no later than Apr 14th, and the GoldFish
CD should follow a few days later.  Shipping of the FrozenFish CD should
commence on about Apr 20th.

The FrozenFish CD is the CD that I'll be recommending for BBS/FTP use, because
it will have a full 640+ Mb of archives, including much more material than
just what is in the floppy library.  Although the GoldFish CD is a two CD set
containing approximately 1295 Mb of material, it is the same material (disks
1-1000) presented in two different forms, archived (425 Mb) and unarchived
(870 Mb).

Anyone that has already preordered the GoldFish CD, that thinks the FrozenFish
CD would better suit their needs, can switch to the FrozenFish CD by simply
sending me a FAX or leaving me a message at (602) 917-0917.  You can also send
me electronic mail at my internet address "fnf@fishpond.cygnus.com".

-----------------
GOLDFISH CD-ROM's
-----------------

The GoldFish CD-ROM will be a two CD set, in a single slimline jewel case, and
will contain the entire contents of the 1000 disk floppy library in both
archived (BBS ready) and unarchived form.  The first CD will contain disks
1-1000 in archived form, and disks 1-250 in unarchived form.  The second CD
will contain disks 251-1000 in unarchived form.  (Note: the breakpoint at disk
250/251 may change slightly as the disks near completion, depending on the
free space available on each CD).

The GoldFish CD will contain a program called "PufferFish", that makes it
simple to create master floppy disks directly off the CD-ROM, for further
duplication and distribution.  It will also have the same level of BBS support
as the first FrozenFish CD.

The GoldFish CD is expected to be complete a few days after the first
FrozenFish CD, and follow it into production on about Apr 18th.  Shipping
should commence on about Apr 24th.
