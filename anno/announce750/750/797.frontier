Subject: Frontier Files v2.0 for Amiga
Status: R

TITLE

Frontier Files v2.0 for Amiga    [ ff2.0_amiga.lha ]


DESCRIPTION

"This directory contains our "Frontier Files" collection, and "best of" 
the EFF archives, including the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet, EFF's
Open Platform proposal, materials from the Steve Jackson Games v. Secret
Service, EFF contact and membership info, online activism resources and lots
more."

All of the text files in this archive have been filtered for the Amiga from
their original MS-DOS format, and icons with Tooltypes added so that Amiga
users can just click and go.  The Big Dummy's Guide has been converted to
hypertext AmigaGuide(R) format and included here.  I've tried to make this
archive very user-friendly!
