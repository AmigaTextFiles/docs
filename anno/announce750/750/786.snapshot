DESCRIPTION

	SnapShot is an interactive course in photography covering 
the basic functions of the camera, exposure, film types, and

the basics of photography.

	SnapShot features an interactive camera simulator.  The user 
looks through the viewfinder of the camera and must properly 
meter and expose various scenes which increase in difficulty.  
The results of the users exposure are displayed in a "final 
print" graphical display.  Overexposed, underexposed, and blurry 
final prints are displayed when incorrect camera settings are 
[Bused.  The user can learn and perfect setting the camera's
