DESCRIPTION

     TauIcons is a collection of additional icons designed in MagicWB
     style, to enhance the look of the Workbench.

NEW FEATURES

     New icons, as could be expected :)

     As a major new feature, TauIcons now includes Dockicons for use
     with ToolManager 2.1 or similar tools.
     
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Workbench 2.0 or later.

     While TauIcons does not require an installed MagicWB, it is
     highly recommended, as that's what it is designed for.

AVAILABILITY

     TauIcons has been uploaded to ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4), and
     will be on all Aminet sites shortly, with the directory and
     filename:
     /pub/aminet/util/wb/TauIcons16.lha

PRICE

     TauIcons is freely distributable and Giftware. If you like it,
     send a small gift (like a copy of your own program) to the author.
