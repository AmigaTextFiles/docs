     Fidonet:  2:285/312.0 (no routed netmail!)

DESCRIPTION

         XEchoGate is gatesoftware especially designed for use with Xenolink
      Professional Bulletin Board System 1.90. XEchoGate will gate messages
      written in Xenolink's messagebase directly to UUCP message by making use
      of the AmigaUUCP package. It'll also gates newgroups to fidonetareas by
      storing those messages directly into Xenolink's messagebase. Due to 
      Xenolink's *fast* performance it'll process those message *very* fast.

FEATURES

      o XEchoGate can be public as well as secure, messages are bounced when
        running in secure mode and user is unknown at your setup (both
        directions)

      o no real uucp msgs are needed, you can gate directly from and to
        Xenolink's messagebase

      o maximum configurability

      o really *fast* (aprox. 150 messages per minute)

      o can crosspost messages in Xenolink's messagebase if the original
        message was crossposted

      o can gate to UUCP only, to Xenolink only or in both directions

      o can put the messages in unknown newsgroups into a junksection

      o sends mail in a moderated newsgroup to the moderator in stead of
        posting it

      o can gate mail from a fidonet area to a mailinglist and vice versa,
        this area can be a known tagname or a junksection as well

      o can send messages from a echomail area direct to a email address
        whenever there is a TO: field at the first line of the message

      o seperate config files for :

                 -  general information
                 -  user information
                 -  area information
                 -  mailing lists

      o buffered log file

      o optional saving of gated emails as PKT in the inbound directory,
        saves up space for outbound netmails

     OS 2.04 or better.
     Xenolink Professional Bulletin Board System 1.90.
