        Reply to:   Re:  -TITLE--     JForth Profess
> try to cut back on that first paragraph of the DESCRIPTION
section.  The history is interesting, but not really appropriate for
this group.

>I'd like to see a little bit more about Forth itself.  Many
people in the group (myself included) have never used Forth.  Just say
what kind of language it is and what it is useful for.  You should
also say why it is good to use it on the Amiga.

here y' go... I hope I turned it into what you wanted... feel free to
edit/shorten etc. as you see fit.

let me know if it needs anything else!

DESCRIPTION

     Forth is an interactive software development environment,
     normally tailored for embedded controller and machine
     control applications.  With JForth's comprehensive Amiga
     system interface, Forth now excels at platform software
     development.   Originally created to provide precise control
     of observatory telescopes, Forth contains both an interpreter
     AND a compiler, combining the best features of both systems.
     The interpreter affords interactive access to all language
     features; programs are compiled into native 68K code.  JForth
     programs are compatible with all AMiga models and OS
     versions.  AGA support (3.1) is currently in beta test.

     This is a demo version of the JForth Professional 3.x
     software development system.  It includes a complete
     JForth interpreter/compiler which is fully-functional
     but limited in the size of executable code it will
     produce.  Also, the demo will NOT create standalone
     programs (the commercial package will).  This demo
     version also offers an "Introduction" which can be
     optionally viewed at startup.
     
     The demo interpreter/compiler includes a disassembler,
     assembler, as well as a source-level debugger.  While
     the demo package does not provide the JForth "include"
     files (similar to C's ",h" files, JForth calls them
     ".j"), MANY are pre-compiled and accessible in the demo
     program.  Similarly, the demo can also call many Amiga
     shared-library functions, as they have been pre-compiled
     for you (the demo package does NOT support adding more...
     the commercial package can call any Amiga library func-,
     tion, even custom libraries).
     
     Additionally, there is a compiled example program which
     demonstrates the JForth interface into graphics, menus,
     HAM mode, gadgets, etc.
     
     There are several source files provided, including an
     IFF file viewer, word/line counter and others (all will
     compile within the working space limitations imposed by
     the demo).  Additionally, several tutorials are provided
     for users new to Forth and/or JForth.
     
     Also provided is V1.11 of Textra, the user-friendly
     Amiga GUI-based text editor.  This is the same editor
     which accompanies the JForth package and can be
     integrated with JForth (even the demo) via ARexx.
     (Later versions of Textra are available and are
     completely backward-compatible with JForth).
     
     Finally, as an example of a JForth standalone,
     graphics-based productivity application, Mike Haas'
     1993 "LCD Calculator II" is included.
