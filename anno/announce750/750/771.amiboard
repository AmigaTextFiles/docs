Subject: REVISED AmiBoard announcement
Status: RO

Dear Dan,

I think you were right about the lack of detail in the DESCRIPTION section of
my announcement. So I have added what I think to be the most important
features. I hope it is ok now.

Thanks for your remarks

     NOT a port of GnuChess but a completely new program.

     Main features:

	- strong chess engine, evaluates between 500 and 1000 
	  nodes/sec on a 68030@25 Mhz (plays a bit stronger than
	  GnuChess 4.0pl58, very much stronger than VChess)

	- Opening book from GnuChess with about 30000 opening
  	  lines

	- supports import and export of games in PGN format.
	  Several thousand games in this format are available
	  via anonymous ftp

	- uses Standard Algebraic Notation (e.g. Nf3 instead of
	  g1-f3)

        - Chess pieces loaded from IFF brush, can easily be changed
	  with any standard painting program

	- Fontadaptive GUI

	- Mostly localized (some error texts will appear in english).
