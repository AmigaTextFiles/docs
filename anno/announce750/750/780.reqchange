DESCRIPTION

     ReqChange is a program that replaces the most common requesters
     in AmigaDOS with the ones available in ReqTools.  This program
     is similar to RTPatch (included in the ReqTools distribution),
     but offers a lot more, such as a builtin "AssignWedge", the
     ability to send a Rexx message when a requester appears and
     several other options (for each requester type).

NEW FEATURES

  Version 3.0 is a a complete rewrite. The new features include:
     - Resident code written in assembler and stored in a .library.
     - Complete ASL V38 (OS 2.1+) support. Can "fall back" to the
       original requester when needed.
     - Rexx messages can be sent from any requester, based on
       type/title(/body text).
     - Prefs editor to edit all settings (including the "pre-denied"
       volumes and rexx messages) with font-sensitive GUI and online
       help. 
     - Smarter/smaller patching code.
     - Documentation in AmigaGuide format.
     - OS 3.0 aware (memory pools etc).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     OS 2.04 or better. ReqTools is also required, but it is included.
