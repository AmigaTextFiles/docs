DESCRIPTION

   MUI-Builder is an application builder for MUI programs.
   It allows beginners and other programmers to build their
   graphic user interfaces very easily.

   It generates C, E or Assembly code for MUI.

   With the many options of MUI-Builder, you can generate
   precisely the part of the source code you really want, and not only the
   whole interface. This permits you to maintain easily your code
   whithout losing your previously modified program each time you
   change your interface.

   Moreover, you can design the inline hypertext guide from
   MUI-Builder by attaching a help text to each GUI-Object of your interface.
   The builder creates the AmigaGuide documentation automatically.

NEW FEATURES

   For the first time, an interface builder enables the creation of a
   catalog description file and the localized source code. With these
   features and the use of programs like Catcomp or Flexcat, localizing
   becomes really easy !!! ( I hope :-) ).

   You now can see the results of your work during the building
   of your GUI.
