Subject: RIPEM 1.2a-0
Status: R

TITLE

        RIPEM -- RSAREF-based Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail

VERSION

        1.2a-0, Amiga port

AUTHOR

        Principal author of RIPEM is Mark Riordan (mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu).
        RSAREF 1.0 on which RIPEM is based is by RSA Data Security
        (rsaref-info@rsa.com).  The Amiga version is ported and compiled by
        Robert Knop (rknop@netcom.com).

DESCRIPTION

        RIPEM implements a filter to process messages as part of a
        public key (asymmetric) cryptography privacy-enhanced mail
        system.

        RIPEM is expected to be used primarily to encrypt and
        decrypt text to be embedded in electronic mail messages.
        However, it also has two "sign-only" modes in which an
        authentication check is added to the message, but no encryp-
        tion of the message itself takes place.  RIPEM can also be
        used to generate RSA public keypairs.

        The techniques and data formats used by RIPEM are as compa-
        tible as possible with Privacy-Enhanced Mail Internet RFCs
        1421-1424.  However, there is no support for "certificates",
        so RIPEM is not really compatible with PEM as described in
        those documents.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        The Amiga port of RIPEM should run on all Amigas.  It may not
        run with Workbench < 2.04, but then again, it might.  The executable
        is about 90K, and it requires a fairly large amount of stack space
        (32K), and may have trouble running on 512K Amigas (but has not been
        tested on such systems).  A separate 68030 version is included.

AVAILABILITY

        Ripem is available on the Ripem FTP site ripem.msu.edu as file:

                /pub/crypt/ripem/binaries/ripem-amiga-1.2a.lha

        Under US Law, RIPEM may not be exported out of the United States or
        Canada.  Anybody may ftp anonymously to the site to take a look at
        what is there, but only users in the USA and Canada willing to comply
        with export laws will be granted the ability to download certain files
        on the site.  For more information on getting access, see the file

                /pub/crypt/ripem/GETTING_ACCESS

        on ripem.msu.edu.

PRICE

        Free

DISTRIBUTABILITY

        Freely distributable; RIPEM is composed of a combination of public
        domain and licenced code.  RIPEM is licenced and unquestionably legal
        to distribute and use under U.S. Patent laws.
