DESCRIPTION

    D.A.S Module Player is a player designed for a high end users.
    Special attention has been given to efficient handling of modules
    in lists. Modules can be sorted and handled with such attributes as
    name(+reverse), date(+reverse), style and author. For better
    handling modules can also be divided to two groups within every
    list and can also be played according to those groups.  Adding modules
    to list is easy since DASMP can take care of already existing modules
    and modules newer than current list.
    
    Modules can be extracted from virtually any external archives such
    as LHA and ZIP. XPK and PowerPacker packed modules can also be used.
    
    Since DASMP requires MUI, the Graphical user Interface of the player
    is totally under user control.  User control over other features of
    DASMP can be squeezed to three words:  6 configuration pages.  Module
    specific configurations includes things like module duration, author,
    style and date.
    
    In overall DASMP is very complex system giving user a possibility to
    use features he needs and forget the rest.

    What DASMP is not: 
    DASMP is not small and is not ment to be a replacement for those cute 
    little players floating around nets. DASMP is not ment to be used on
    non accelerated a500 or a2000.

NEW FEATURES

    First in any multi format module player  DASMP presents S3M (Scream
    Tracker III) module support. S3M modules are modules capable up to 
    32 channels played while multitasking. New and improved EPL system
    guarantees better module handling than before.
    
    To put new features short: History file is about 3 pages long 
    filled with new, changed and fixed routines.
