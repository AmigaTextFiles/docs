DESCRIPTION

  MainActor is a modular animation package.

  It allows you to create,edit,time and play animations of the provided
  animation formats.

  You can convert any format into any other, allowing you to
  convert for example a range of pictures into an animation format
  of your choice, or resave the frames of an animation to an
  picture format, or simply to convert different picture formats.

  New Features of Version 1.5 :
  -----------------------------
  
   - Major hd playback improvements of all modules. Average speed
     increase is about 2 - 5 times the speed of v1.2, giving you
     maximum performance.

   - Sound Support. MainActor now has Sound Modules which allow you to
     associate sound effects to every frame of an animation. This works
     for pictures too. The sound information is module independent, that
     means that you could use the same sound information ("#?.snd") on
     every module type MainActor supports.

   - New Real3D, IFF-Anim3, IFF-AnimJ, Picasso and AVI animation loader.

   - The usage of the Append function is now easier. The saver module
     now recognizes automatically if the destination project is of the
     right type. That means that you can now use the universal modules
     for appending.

   - Many smaller improvements.
   
  General Features:
  
  -Intelligent caching/tracking, MainActor can cache your animations and
   picture lists, if you have not enough memory it will directly access
   your data from any device. This makes it for example possible to
   create/edit/play a 400MB animation on your 2MB Amiga.

  -If you run OS 3.0 or higher, you will get an extra speed bonus on
   animations through the use of the new graphics routines.
   For OS2.0/2.1 users there are specific routines in the modules, which
   will give them the best playback speed possible on their system
   (and my knowledge :)).

  -Under OS 3.0 you will get the extra features of showing pictures or
   playing animations in a scrollable, resizable window on your MainActor
   or Workbench screen. The colors will be properly adjusted to your screen
   attributes.

  -MainActor has an arexx port, nearly all functions can be accessed through
   it. You can for example scale or dither whole animations through
   the use of an image processor, scripts are included.
