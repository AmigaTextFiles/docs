Amiga developper brainstorming in Heppenheim, Germany.



Bensheim, 18/07/95

On the 7th of July, Amiga Technologies invited all main hardware and software
development companies in Germany to a brainstroming meeting in Heppenheim.
Manfred Schmitt, chairman of the board at ESCOM AG and Petro Tyschtschenko,
General Manager at Amiga Technologies used the opportunity to present the new
Amiga daughtercompany of ESCOM and the plans for the future to the attendance.

The main discussion topics were about the development of the actual product
range in the future. Amiga Technologies wants to build up tight cooperations
with the most successfull development companies worldwide. "There is a high
potential for development from third party and we want this people to be on our
side and to work with us", says Manfred Schmitt.

During the meeting, the Amiga Technologies  staff and the developpers could
exchange their views and plans on the future of the Amiga. The use of  Amiga
technology in the set-top-boxes market as well as the migration towards new
generation models were also discussed topics.

In August, Amiga Technologies will also hold a conference for the press, the
developpers and the dealers in London.
