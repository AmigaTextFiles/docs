I adapted this part as you told me. As I don't have ftp access
by mayself, all I do is to give the archive to a friend of
mine to upload it. Therefore, I usually don't know exactly on
which Aminet Ftp server it is first. Ftp.wustl.edu should be
quite save, however.

Hmmm...what would _you_ call an address database tool?

I tried to make this a bit clearer. Hope it's ok now;-)

Ok.

TITLE

     DFA(ddress)

VERSION

     V2.25

AUTHOR

     Dirk Federlein

     UUCP:   dirkf@alcmy.franken.de

     Fido:   2:244/6302.12


DESCRIPTION

     DFA is the definite address database utility for you and the 
     Amiga computer.

     DFA manages your email addresses, allows direct dialing of
     the stored phone numbers, grouping of addresses, different 
     types of printing addresses, online help, application 
     icon/window and much more!

     DFA has an Arexx port, font sensitive windows and can be fully
     directed by keyboard. Native languages are supported as soon
     as Workbench 2.1 (and above) is installed.

     Nearly every aspect of DFA is customizable, so you may
     configure "your own" DFA.

     This is version 2.25, a minor update to version 2.2.

     DFA is an SASG product! Shareware, binary only.


NEW FEATURES (since v2.2)

     QuickSearch function for the DFAEditor main window.

     Improved mapping function for the MagicWB images.

     Several bug fixes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     DFA needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.

     It takes advantage of the new features included in version 2.1
     (Locale  support)  and  uses even some features coming with OS
     3.0 if available.

     DFA is made to run on all systems, starting with the A500+
     and ending up with the A4000(T).

     More than 512KB of RAM and a harddisk are recommended.

HOST NAME

     ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/biz/dbase/dfa-225.lha (717630)

     (and aminet mirrors)

PRICE
                                                DM        US$

     Shareware fee.............................30.00     20.00

     See documentation for additional information.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     DFA is NOT PD.  It is shareware.  The author keeps the
     copyright over the whole package.

     The public version of DFA (without the keyfile!) is freely
     (re)distributable, but noone is allowed to sell the program
     for more money than to cover just the costs of copying.

     In any case nobody may charge more than Fred Fish claims
     for one of his "Library Disks"!
