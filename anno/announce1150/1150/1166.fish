DESCRIPTION

    The FreshFish CD-ROM series is a 2-CD set released approximately every
    two months, that contains approximately 1.1 Gb of useful programmer's
    tools, submissions of newly released material, useful documentation,
    etc.

    Volume 9 contains new ports of GNU Fortran, GNU octave, and UnixTeX.
    Many other utilities, such as GNU ADA are updated.  Also included are
    copies of newly released disks 1001-1060 from the floppy library.

    The material is roughly divided into the following sections:

                        full GNU source code, original baseline source,
                        diff files, etc, all in archived form.

        94 Mb   GNU     Binaries, libraries, runtime files, and documentation
                        for utilities in the GNU tree.  Source is now located
                        in the BBS tree.

    GNU:bin directory):
