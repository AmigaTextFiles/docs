Amiga Technologies distribution in the USA

There has recently been an announcement made by an american distributor
about a price for the Amiga 4000T of 3500 USD.

We would like to contradict this information as it has not come from one of
our official press releases. There have been no firm distribution contracts
or agreements signed yet for northern America.

There has been no decision taken yet concerning the pricing of the Amiga
4000 T in the USA.

There will be a sales meeting in the USA next week where all american
dealers will be invited to discuss the market situation and future price
policy for the USA. Petro Tyschtschenko, General Manager at Amiga
Technologies GmbH will conduct that meeting.

Manfred Schmitt, Chairman of the Board at ESCOM AG and Petro Tyschtschenko
will thereafter take the decision for the pricing of the Amiga 4000 T in the
USA.

Potential Amiga dealers are welcome to send in their applications for
becoming one of our distributors in Northern America.
