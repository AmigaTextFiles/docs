... This is a notice to let everyone know of the new
ongoing movement to have ALynx 1.31 continue development,
and the change in the mailinglist location.

... ALynx version 1.31, is a text WWW browser, that is
fast, small and capable of going to any www site,
except those that 'require' cookies, or SSL encryption.
It also does not support Java/JavaScript.

... I have been in contact with a few Amiga Programmers
in reagrds to this undertaking.  So far to date, there
is one possible person who is willing to take a look at
the ALynx 1.31 program and see what needs doing in order
to add cookie and SSL capabilities to this program.

... Join the alynx mailing list, that is on the eGroups
site (moved from ONElist, due to the merger of ONElist
and eGroups.)  If you are already a subscriber to ONElist
or eGroups, just go to the alynx website, and follow
the 'subscribe' link.  If you are not a member of the
service, you will first have to signup as a member, before
you can join a list.


Thanks,
