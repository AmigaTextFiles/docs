                 The Interactive Course in Photography


  SnapShot is an interactive course in photography covering the basic
functions of the camera, exposure, film types, and camera accessories.
SnapShot uses a graphical point and click interface that is fun and
easy to use.  Upon completion of the SnapShot course the user should
have an expert understanding of the basics of photography.

  SnapShot features an interactive camera simulator.  The user looks
through the viewfinder of the camera and must properly meter and expose
various scenes which increase in difficulty.  The results of the users
exposure are displayed in a "final print" graphical display.  Overexposed,
underexposed, and blurry final prints are displayed when incorrect camera
settings are used.  The user can learn and perfect setting the camera's
exposure settings without wasting expensive film.

  SnapShot also features a film database and an illustrated glossary.  
Each section of SnapShot has a corresponding quiz.  Snapshot grades 
each quiz to indicate the user's performance.  

  If you hold an interest in photography, SnapShot is for you!
