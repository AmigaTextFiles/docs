==================
FRESHFISH CD-ROM's
==================

FreshFish Volume 7 (Nov/Dec-94) went into production on Oct 28th and should
be shipping by Nov 4th.  We are sold out of all previous FreshFish CD's,
except for about 200 copies of Volume 6 (Sep/Oct-94) and 100 copies of
Volume 3 (Mar/Apr-94).

The next FreshFish CD, Volume 8, is expected to go into production in the
last week of December.

=================
GOLDFISH CD-ROM's
=================

GoldFish Volume 1, which is the definitive archive of the first 1000 disks
in my floppy library, continues to sell well.  GoldFish Volume 2, which will
contain selected material from the previous releases of FreshFish CD's,
starting with the most recent release and working backwards, is expected to
go into production during the third week of November and ship by the end of
November.  As with GoldFish Volume 1, Volume 2 will be a 2-CD set with all
the material available in both archived and unarchived form.  The retail
price of GoldFish is $19.95.

============
LIGHT-ROM CD
============

In cooperation with Lightwave artist Michael Meshew, we are now offering a
new CD called "LIGHT-ROM".  This is a 650 Mb CD-ROM dedicated to 3D artists
all over the world, and contains Lightwave objects, scene files, textures,
bump maps (JPEG, TFF, & TARGA), fonts, thumbnail renderings, and text files
with advice from the rendering pros.  It also contains a "Showcase
Directory", displaying the talents of selected Lightwave artists from all
over the world.  Contributors will be eligible for a free copy.

LIGHT-ROM is scheduled to go into production on Oct 31st and start shipping
by Nov 4th.  It will be updated at approximately 6 month intervals.  The
retail price is $39.95 plus $3.95 for shipping and handling.

=============
FRESHFONTS CD
=============

In cooperation with fonts enthusiast Daniel Amor, we are publishing a new
fonts CD called FreshFonts.  This CD is published under conditions similar
to the Meeting Pearls CD, whereby users that find the CD interesting and
useful are expected to make a shareware like donation to the creators of the
CD.  This CD will be distributed free of charge to people that order one or
more other CD's from us that are shipped during the rest of 1994, for as
long as supplies of the FreshFonts CD last.  We expect to directly
distribute at least 1000 copies of this CD.

The FreshFonts CD will also be available at the World Of Commodore show in
Cologne, free to customers at Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe, or available at
a small charge for non-customers.

==============
TURBOCALC V2.0
==============

I am happy to announce that we are now an authorized U.S. distributor of
TurboCalc V2.0, a very powerful Amiga spreadsheet program.  TurboCalc has
extensive formatting options, supports many different font formats, more
than 40 different number, time, and date formats, more than 100 functions
covering arithmetic and financial needs, more than 120 ARexx and macro
instructions, integrated database, and more.  TurboCalc retails for $115
plus $6.95 for shipping and handling.

===================
NEW AMINET CD-ROM's
===================

We are an authorized U.S. distributor of the new Aminet CD.  Both the Aminet
Gold and the Aminet Share are available.  Subscriptions for both CD's are
also available, at $59.95 per year for the Gold version and $44.95 for the
Share version.  There are expected to be four releases per year, so the
subscription is actually for 4 CD's, regardless of when they actually end up
shipping.

The only physical difference between the Aminet Gold CD and the Aminet Share
CD is the front cover artwork.  Built into the price of the Aminet Gold CD
is an automatic contribution to the creators of the CD and sufficient margin
to make the disk attractive to low volume resellers and retail sales
outlets.  Users who purchase to the Aminet Share version are expected to
make their own contributions directly to the creators if they feel that the
CD is worthwhile and wish to support creation of future Aminet CD's.

We currently have Volume 3 (July 1994) in stock, however are expecting to
get Volume 4 (Nov 1994) on about Nov 8th.

=====================
MEETING PEARLS CD-ROM
=====================

I am happy to announce that we expect to have the second pressing of the
Meeting Pearls CD in stock in mid November.  This CD contains about 150 high
quality and high resolution fractals, a ready to run version of PasTeX which
includes fonts for FAX and 600 DPI printers, a ready to install version of
the Amiga NetBSD port, and many other ready to run applications including
UMS, DaggeX, a lot of utilities, games, etc.

Because the version of NetBSD expected to be included on the CD-ROM includes
encryption code that is restricted for U.S export, all imported CD's will
only be available for resale within the U.S.

=================================
SPECIAL BBS VERSION OF FROZENFISH
=================================

By special request from BBS operators, we are issuing a limited number of a
custom version of the April 1994 FrozenFish CD, updated with some new
material, and called "FrozenFish-PC".  This CD has the complete contents of
each floppy disk 1-1000 in a single archive and all directory and file names
are ISO-9660 level 1 compliant (8.3 format, uppercase only, etc).  This
means that the CD is completely compatible with IBM-PC based systems, unlike
our regular Amiga CD's which are closer to ISO-9660 level 2.

Until the actual demand is known, each copy of this CD is an individually
created CD-R "gold disk", which is completely compatible with mass
production CD's and CD-ROM drives.  If there is sufficient demand for the
CD, then there will be a small production run made and people who received
the CD-R versions can upgrade to the production version for $5 plus shipping
costs.  The price of this CD is $24.95 for either version, because of the
lower volumes and thus higher production costs per CD.

=====================
ATTENTION ALL AUTHORS
=====================

Amiga Library Services is actively looking to expand our CD-ROM offerings.
If you are an Amiga user with a good idea for an Amiga specific CD-ROM,
please consider letting us act as your publisher.  We will handle all
details concerning actual production of the CD-ROM, advertising, sales, and
distribution.  All you have to do is have a good idea and to be willing to
spend the necessary time to create a ready-to-publish master file tree for
the CD.

===========================
FUTURE FLOPPY DISK RELEASES
===========================

Floppy disks after disk 1000 will be produced by Amazing Computing (PIM
Publications) using material from each FreshFish CD.  We are expecting
delivery any time of the first batch of floppy disks after 1000, and these
floppies will be included on the next available FreshFish CD.  Contact PIM
Publications directly for further information (1-800-345-3360 voice,
1-508-675-6002 FAX).

======================
ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS
======================

Material for inclusion in the CD-ROM distribution can now be submitted
electronically via anonymous ftp.  Please upload your submissions as an lha
archive, one archive per submitted program, to the ftp incoming directory on
ftp.amigalib.com.  Please include a "Product-Info" file in the lha archive.
This file describes the material using a standard format that is recognized
by the new version of KingFisher and by tools that we use to automatically
generate information about the CD contents.  If you don't have a copy of the
Product-Info specification, it can be retrieved via anonymous ftp from
ftp.amigalib.com, in directory pub/amiga.

If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can still submit material
electronically by mailing a uuencoded lha archive to
"submissions@amigalib.com".

=================
ELECTRONIC ORDERS
=================

You can email orders to be paid via credit card (VISA or MasterCard only) to
"orders@amigalib.com".  All such orders must include the full name of the
card holder, the card number, the expiration date, and a daytime phone
number which can be used to verify the order.  We will attempt to
acknowledge all such received orders via return email, and to verify an
unspecified percentage via phone calls.

Please note that it is considered to be somewhat risky to send credit card
information via electronic mail without encrypting it.  We are not currently
ready to start receiving encrypted orders, but may be able to do so in the
future.  We cannot be responsible for any fraudulent use of credit card info
that is intercepted by a third party during it's transmission.
