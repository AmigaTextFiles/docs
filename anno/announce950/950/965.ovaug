DESCRIPTION

    OVAUG Online is the World Wide Web (WWW) site for the Ohio Valley
Amiga Users Group (OVAUG).

    Originally intended to be an online newsletter, I opted to make
this a general server of Amiga-related information with an emphasis on
OVAUG members' contributions. Most of the submissions are reviews,
artwork, and articles on everything from art and design with the Amiga
to technical articles. Therefore, this site is not just to serve OVAUG
members, but it is for all Amiga users.


NEW FEATURES

    New features can appear at any time. You just have to pop in on
occassion to see what's new.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    A WWW browser such as Mosaic (Preferred) or lynx.


URL

    http://iac.net/~ddennedy/OVAUG/OVAUG.html


PRICE

    Just a little bit of your precious time.
