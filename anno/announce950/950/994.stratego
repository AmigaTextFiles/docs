Ok, I've fixed that now.

Well I'm actually calling it "Serial Stratego", which is a different
name.  I need to have "stratego" in there somewhere so that people
will know what the game is.  I don't think that Milton Bradley would
have a problem with this title, and I know of some authors who have
written nice mac stratego shareware games, and they haven't come 
across any legal problems.  Anyways, I don't think that this will be
a problem.  If you are still concerned, please let me know.

 DESCRIPTION
 
 	Allows people to play Stratego, a popular board game, over a
 	serial connection.  Gameplay can take place over a null modem
 	connection, Modem, or while logged onto a remote host using
 	Internet Relay Chat, talk, or write.  The program is unique in
 	that it uses a robust packet sending algorithm which transmits
 	and receives packets using standard printable characters, and
 	filters out screen escape codes.  During game play, messages
 	may be sent, and optionally played through the SPEAK: device. 
 	Be sure to skim the documentation before trying the program.
 
 	New Features added to this version:
 		- Sound effects.
 		- CRC Error detection.
 		- Save game and recover after disconnections.
 		- Some minor problems have been fixed.
 
 DISTRIBUTABILITY
 
 	May be distributed freely.  I would be honored to have this
 	placed on a Fish Disk.  The program may not be sold to make
 	a profit.
 
 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
 
 	Runs on any OS.  Uses the SPEAK: device, but this is not a
 	requirement.
  
 DIRECTORY
 
  	Found on aminet sites such as ftp.cdrom.com in the directory
  	pub/aminet/game/2play
  
 FILENAME
 
 	SerStratego.lha 105804 bytes long.
