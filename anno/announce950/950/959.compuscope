DESCRIPTION

     gage_cs220.device is a driver for the CompuScope 220 ISA Digital
     Oscilloscope board from Gage Scientific.  With this driver and a
     GoldenGate 2 or GG2+ ISA/ZorroII bus bridge, you can use the CS220
     on an Amiga. 

     The driver allows access to nearly all features of the hardware,
     including dual channel sampling at up to 20MHz, and single
     channel up to 40MHz.

     A demo disk is available.  The demo disk contains gage_null.device,
     a demonstration and test version of the driver that doesn't require
     a CS220 or even an ISA/Zorro bus bridge.  It simulates the
     operation of the gage_cs220.device and provides the same interface,
     and allows development of software for gage_cs220.device when
     hardware is not available.  Since gage_cs220.device is a
     binddrivers-style device, and since gage_null.device is based on
     much of the same code, the gage_null.device is also a binddrivers
     style device and must be bound to an autoconfiguring board on your
     system.  However, gage_null.device doesn't actually access the
     board it is bound to, so it is safe to bind the driver to any
     unbound board on your system.  A ram expansion board is a good
     candidate. 

     The disk also contains the full autodocs and headers necessary to
     program for the gage_cs220.device, and to allow you to get a feel
     for the capabilities of the real driver.  Or, with the
     gage_null.device, you can develop complete applications for the
     CS220 without having the hardware or driver available. 

     See the file README.DataWeb on the demo disk for information on the
     DataWeb, a complete scientific data acquisition and processing
     environment that can be used with the gage_cs220.device.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Amiga 2000, 3000, or 4000 with OS 2.0 or later. See the section
     titled 'OTHER' for a special note about the A3000.

     A CompuScope 220 ISA Digital Oscilloscope board (naturally).

     A GoldenGate 2 or GG2+ ISA/ZorroII bus bridge.

HOST NAME

     The demonstration disk archive is available on
     Aminet (e.g. ftp.wustl.edu 128.252.135.4)

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/biz/demo

FILE NAMES

     gagedrv_demo.lha      (97526 bytes)
     gagedrv_demo.readme   (2770 bytes)

PRICE
     
     The price is $99.95 plus $5 S/H. Texas residents add sales tax.
     We also accept purchase orders from large organizations!

     The demonstration disk is free on Aminet, or can be ordered for $5
     plus shipping/handling. If you have previously ordered a demo
     disk, $5 will be deducted from the price.

     All prices in US funds. Please contact us by phone or email for
     international orders.

OTHER

     The CS220 board will not work in an A3000 as-is.  It draws too much
     power on start-up and prevents the 3000's power supply from coming
     up.  It works fine on 2000s, 3000Ts, and 4000s, but not the
     standard 3000.  Gage can provide a modified board that works around
     the problem, or you can modify your own.  Please contact us for
     details. 

     The driver has only been tested with the 32K board model, but
     should work with the other small (<512K) models.  It may not work
     without additional work on the large models.  I am unable to test
     this without access to a large-memory card.

     If you need a driver for other Gage Scientific hardware or require
     features not supported in the current CS220 driver (for example,
     non-automatic software triggering, or large-memory cards), please
     contact us.  We may be able to help.
