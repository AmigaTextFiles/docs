DESCRIPTION

     IBG Browser is a simple and fast viewer for the images contained
     on the cd-rom set: "Voyager to the Outer Planets" by NASA.
     Because of the moltitude of images present on the NASA cd-roms
     for one man is very hard to see all of them in one life.
     There are at least 12 full cd-rom of the probe Voyager images,
     the majority of which, stored in the PDS compressed format, but
     at the end of every subset of images (ie Saturn subset, etc)
     there are the "best of" stored in the IBG format (directory
     /BROWSE/ of the each cd-rom). So this program is useful to "fish"
     in the sea of images the preferred one in IBG format and then get
     the original image in the PDS compressed format.


     IBG Browser is easy to use and it can:

     - display the image (obviously)
     - show the image histogram
     - report the image information (tech data and so on)

     and in addiction it's possible to change the colors of the image
     so to put in evidence unexpected details. There are three options:

     - full gray scale
     - standard false colors
     - spectrum colors

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 3.0 (or higher)
