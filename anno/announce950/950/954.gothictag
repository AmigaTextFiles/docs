DESCRIPTION

   Taglines are the little amusing (or not) messages found at the 
   bottom of email messages. However not all mail systems support 
   them automatically. Gothic Tag is the solution.

   Gothic Tag is a thing for adding taglines to the bottom of email
   messages.  Or alternatively a thing for adding email messages to
   the top of taglines.

   This tiny utility will invisibly add a witty remark to any 
   message written in any mail software, whether it is on Usenet,
   Fidonet, Virtualnet or any other network.
