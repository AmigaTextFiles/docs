DESCRIPTION
     BlocNotes is a WB commodity that permits you to take notes.
     When you hit a custom hotkey it opens a window; in that window
     you can insert as much text as you want.  All the text will be
     stored, together with a description of the window, in a file so
     that at startup all the previously opened windows will be
     opened, each one with its text.

     It's possible to open a great number of windows.  For each
     window you can set the textfont, the size and position among
     other things (as GADGETLESS or EDITABLE).  You can set for each
     thing a default value.

     It supports the clipboard completely, so you can copy text from
     a shell or something else to a note-window or viceversa.  You
     can also import or export files.  All the windows can be closed
     or simply hided with a simple command.
