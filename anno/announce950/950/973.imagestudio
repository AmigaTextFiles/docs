DESCRIPTION
	ImageStudio is an image processor written for the casual
	graphics user who wishes to convert or manipulate various
	graphics formats on a modest Amiga system. The program
	tries to cover the most commonly performed operations
	like colour reduction, scaling and dithering in an easy
	to use Workbench2 style interface. Most of the commonly
	used file formats can be loaded or saved. Image processing,
	by its very nature, requires large amounts of RAM -
	ImageStudio includes its own virtual memory manager to
	reduce the ammount of RAM required.

	* Virtual memory
	* Upto 100 levels of undo / redo
	* Loads / saves IFF-ILBM (palette based upto 256 colours,
	HAM6, HAM8, extra halfbright), GIF, BMP, PCX, JPEG,
	Targa, EPS, datatypes.
	* User definable convolution filters.
	* Adjust colour balance (brightness, contrast and gamma).
	* ASCII and AmigaGuide documentation.
	* Requires no third party libraries or utilities.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
	ImageStudio requires:

	* Workbench 2.04 or above.
	* Around 1MB of free memory.
	* Several MB of free hard disk space (for virtual memory).

HOST NAME
	ftp.uni-paderborn.de or any Aminet site.
