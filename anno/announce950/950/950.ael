DESCRIPTION

    The Amiga Educator's List (AEL) is meant to be a resource for
    anyone using their Amiga to teach or to learn.  This could be at
    an educational institution or at home.  The AEL newsletter has
    been created to act as a forum for Amiga educators, providing a
    means to exchange ideas and talk about new products. People who
    have interesting stories, tips, or ideas to share are encouraged
    to write articles for the newsletter.  The first issue includes an
    editor's corner, new product announcements, a list of educational
    resources on the Internet, an article about accessing Aminet, and
    a list of schools using Amigas.

    The newsletter will be published quarterly, starting with the
    October 1994 issue.  It will be available electronically via
    Aminet and the OWL BBS.  Limited paper copies will be sent upon
    request. If you are interested in getting on the AEL please send
    e-mail to OWL Software with your address (postal and e-mail),
    phone number, and school affiliation.  Also let us know what form
    you would like the newsletter in.  If you can not download it or
    read it on the net, the newsletter can be e-mailed to you directly
    (specify uuencoded hypertext version with icon, hypertext version,
    or text version).  A paper copy can also be mailed to a postal
    address upon request.
