Dan,

        This looks like reject material to me howver you may disagree.  It
contains much to much information on past IPISA events instead of focusing
on IPISA'94 events and schedules as well as a description of what the event
is designed for.  He does get to that in the last remaining paragraphs but
the rest is what kills me.  Not to mention that this thing might bore the
pants off of some readers.  200+ lines is quite a lot.  It is very well
written apart from some very minor mistakes which can be fixed in a stich.

                               IPISA'94

      Incontro dei Programmatori Italiani per lo Sviluppo Amiga
                            Fourth Edition

                      Saturday, November 19 1994

                            Milano, Italy

The Italian Amiga community will meet on November 19th, 1994, at the
fourth annual IPISA conference. IPISA stands for Incontro dei
Programmatori Italiani per lo Sviluppo su Amiga (Italian Programmers'
Meeting for Amiga Development).

IPISA is an open meeting (advance registration is required for a
small fee) focussing on non-commercial products, projects and ideas,
and on the distribution of high-quality information and advanced
software tools.

It is also a chance for (usually isolated) novice users to talk each
other and to consult qualified and experienced Amiga users. IPISA is
(and has been) a valuable occasion for small Italian enterprises
working with the Amiga to do some head-hunting and to arrange
professional talks with usually unreachable people, such as magazines
chief editors and journalists, freelance programmers, etc.

In the past, IPISA was an opportunity for Commodore Italia to
introduce new products (the MPEG card at IPISA'93 was a hit) and to
answer questions on its policies. Commodore Italia has always
supported the IPISA conference by helping in the organization phase,
by giving computers and sample products, and by participating in the
conference through its representatives.


About past IPISA conferences

As we said, this is the	fourth conference; the first and second ones
were held in Modena and were organized by three former Amiga
developers. Even without press coverage, the conferences attracted 90
participants.

For the 1993 conference, the organization was taken over by a large
group of developers and users living in Milan. With the help of
Amiga-specific magazines, FidoNet Amiga chat groups, Commodore
developer support (Mr. Ettore Caurla) and fellow Amiga users who
helped to "spread the word", the last conference was attended by over
150 people from all over Italy (even from Sicily, which is one full
day of travel away).

During the conference, relators talked about their works (mainly
software programs, hardware projects, etc.), and Mr. Caurla described
the terms and conditions for becoming a registered Amiga developer.
He also answered many questions from users and the developer
community.

In the end, an impressive demo of CD32's MPEG card and CD32 games was
shown. IPISA'93 was covered in depth by several Amiga-specific
magazines, and reviewed by Italy's most influential computer
magazine: MC Microcomputer. All reviews were entusiastic and labeled
the organization "ottimo" (very good).


About this year's conference

The team organizing the IPISA'94 is composed of fifteen people:
Roberto Attias, Vittorio Calzolari, Marco Caimi, Federica Colla,
Alessandro Ferrarin, Giovanni Gentile, Fabrizio Lodi, Marco Menegon,
Sergio Ruocco (chair), Carlo Santagostino, Paolo Silvera, Reinhard
Spisser, Carlo Todeschini, Sebastiano Vigna and Marco Zandonadi.

All of them are long time Amiga users. Some are (or have been)
freelance authors for Amiga-specific magazines for years. Many of
them are working (or have worked) as programmers, artists or
qualified technicians for Italian companies setting up a number of
commercial Amiga-based multimedia projects.

This year, IPISA'94 will be held Saturday November 19, 1994, in the
Conference Hall of the Centro Universitario ISU (via Valvassori
Peroni 21 Milano); the hall is in the Northwest zone of the city,
also known as Citta` Studi, where the Politecnico di Milano and many
scientific departments of Universita` Statale di Milano are located.


The tentative schedule is:

  9:00 AM - 10:00 AM		Registration
 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM		Presentation and foreword
