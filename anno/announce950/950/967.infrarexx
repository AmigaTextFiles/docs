Status: RO

TITLE

     InfraRexx
     (and InfraJoy hardware design)

VERSION

     1.4
     (InfraJoy version 3.1)

RELEASE DATE

     24-Oct-94

AUTHORS

     Leon Woestenberg (leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)
     Jeroen Steenblik (jeroens@stack.urc.tue.nl)

DESCRIPTION

     The InfraRexx software along with the InfraJoy hardware serve as an
     ARexx-Infrared interface, that adds the function of an infrared
     remote controller to your Amiga, and more.

     With this software and hardware you can:

       o Control external audio/video devices via ARexx commands.
       o Control Amiga programs via a common remote control unit.
       o Learn and edit new remote control infrared commands.

     For example you can control a moduleplayer via your compact
     disc player remote control unit. Or, control your video tape
     recorder via a graphic user interface or an ARexx script.

     The main features are:

       o Seperate editor (with learner) and ARexx host commodity.
       o Multitasking-friendly infrared sampling monitor, with very
         low system overhead during monitoring, can even be disabled.
       o Font-sensitive, style-compliant graphic user interface.
       o Supports localization under Workbench 2.1 (or better) users.
       o Uses 3.x functions and gadtools features if present.
       o Lowcost hardware for joystickport, with optional throughput.
       o Uses the Amiga Installer Utility to install onto (hard)disk.

NOTES

       o People that build the InfraJoy v3 hardware of Release 1.3
         are advised to read the hardware guide to fix a missing track.

CHANGES

       o All known bugs removed.
       o Danish and Italian language catalogs included.
       o A track on the print circuit board solderside was missing.
         Instructions are added to patch and fix InfraJoy v3 devices.
       o Small corrections in documentation and illustrations.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       InfraRexx needs at least AmigaOS version 2.04, and the commodity
       needs RexxMast to be running in order to be useful. The software
       is useless without the small InfraJoy hardware add-on, off which
       the design and full building instructions are included. The
       hardware can also be ordered from one of the authors.

HOST NAME

       hardware costs about US$8 if self-built, but can also be ordered
       for the amount of US$17, which provides free registration and
       two updates.
