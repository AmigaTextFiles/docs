TITLE

     GTDriver

VERSION

     1.0

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

GTDriver is a program to control serial graphic tablets and serial
mice with your Amiga. Version 1.0 of GTDriver supports the following
tablets:

- Summagraphics MM
- Summagraphics Bitpadone
- CalComp 2000
- Cherry
- TekTronix 4957
- Wacom

and the following mice:

- Microsoft mouse
- Mouse System mouse

If your tablet or mouse emulates one of the previous models you can
use it with GTDriver (if not, contact the authors to have your device
supported in the next release of the package).

GTDriver has many parameters that can be configured using the prefs
program GTDOptions. Among the parameters you find the emulation type,
the baud rate, the dpi tablet resolution, the dimensions of the clip
region, etc.

GTDriver has two working modes: 'driver mode' and 'server mode'. In
'driver mode' the pointing device of the tablet becomes a mouse
replacement, and you can use the tablet with any program. If you have
a digitizing puck, it may have more than two buttons. However, only
three buttons are supported in 'driver mode'. The third button is
mapped to the third Amiga mouse button (that is supported by few
programs).

'Server mode' is intended for programmers only. You can write your
own programs that use GTDriver in server mode: in this way GTDriver
will not control the screen pointer, and will send complete tablet
information to your program in a documented format. By using GTDriver
in 'server mode' your software can take full advantage of any tablet
feature.

GTDriver supports user-defined tablet buttons (called pseudo-buttons
or p-buttons). A p-button is a rectangular area on the tablet, to
which an arbitrary key combination has been associated. Whenever you
press the stylus on a pseudo button, its key combination is sent to
the active program just like you were pressing it on the keyboard. As
many programs use keyboard shortcuts to select tools and menu items,
you can define sets of p-buttons even for programs not explicitly
written to work with GTDriver. For example, you can use Deluxe Paint
or DynaCadd with a graphic tablet without having tool bars on the
screen, without selecting menu items and, most of all, without the
software being aware of GTDriver!


FEATURES

- Message port with support for many commands;
- Two working modes: 'driver mode' (mouse replacement mode) and
'server mode' (direct control for programmers);
- Support for user defined pseudo-buttons on the tablet; a pseudo
button is associated to a keyboard sequence so that button masks can
be created to control software that isn't aware of GTDriver (Deluxe
Paint, etc.);
- Font-sensitive AUISG-compliant preferences program (GTDOptions);
- Enforcer and Mungwall test for both GTDriver and GTDOptions;
- Dvi, Amigaguide, ASCII and ANSI text documentation;
- C source example to show how to program GTDriver in 'server mode';
- Deluxe Paint 4.5 pseudo-button mask included;


HOST NAME

  GTDriver is available for anonymous FTP on Aminet sites such as
  ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).


DIRECTORY

        /pub/aminet/hard/drivr/

FILE NAMES

     GTDriver.lha         (183146 bytes)
     GTDriver.readme      (5146 bytes)
 

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

GTDriver needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run. A fast CPU
it's not required but the driver may have better performance with it.


PRICE

To become a registered user you have to send us a registration fee
and your full name and address. More details are explained in the
package documentation.

If you like `GTDriver' and use it, please register yourself, helping
us to enhance this product.  If you don't think this program is
useful enough to pay for it, please, at least e-mail (or mail) us
your suggestions, so that we can make improvements.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

GTDriver is NOT PD. It is shareware. The authors keep the copyright
over the whole package.

The unregistered version of GTDriver is freely (re)distributable, but
none is allowed to sell the program for more money than to cover just
the costs of copying.

In any case noone may charge more than Fred Fish claims for one of
his "Library Disks"!
