Subject: (CSAA) Aminet hits 10000 files
Status: RO

Today, October 14th 1994, three years after its inception, Aminet has
hit a total number of 10,000 online files. Again, I would like to step
on the soapbox and talk what happended in the meantime, how Aminet
looks today, and what is still in the making. And of course I'd like
to thank the countless people who helped to make Aminet what it is 
today.


THE HISTORY
-----------

As I expected, there's not nearly as many stories to tell about the the 
second 5000 files that found their way onto Aminet as there were about
the first 5000. Considering how violent the early days of Aminet were, 
this is certainly a progress.

Yes, there were some notable events. There was a first go at integrating
the boing archive into Aminet (thanks once again to the many, many 
volunteers who helped). Also, the manufacturer of the Aminet CD ROM's has
changed - for the better, I hope. We've also introduced some new services,
like gopher and WWW servers, new mirrors, and 50 BBSes carrying Aminet.
But far more important is that Aminet now has become established standard.

Aminet now grown to a point where almost everyone on the Internet
has a working Aminet mirror nearby, which removes the need to use
international Internet lines. There are 20 official Aminet mirrors now,
plus another dozen inofficial or partial ones. Aminet can also be 
accessed from about 60 BBSes around the world, as well as on CD-ROM
and diskettes. Amiga magazines have started quoting Aminet as the 
source of the freely distributable software they review.

It looks like a dream has come true. Back when I started doing the 
50 Megabyte archive that was to become Aminet, I had a look at how
the distribution of freely distributable software worked. It was 
quite messy. There were many possible channels (different FTP sites,
independent BBSes, and lots of diskette PD series) where a software
author could place his releases, but none of them came even close
to reaching everyone. And none of those channels came anywhere close
to carrying all the Amiga software released.

Wouldn't it be much nicer if there existed a large pool where simply 
*all* Amiga software is released and stored? It was a complete utopia
when Aminet was founded. It starts to become reality now. Much like the
Fish disks in the early days, Aminet has now become the place to check
for new software. We had the luck (lots of luck, considering how much 
could have gone wrong) to see a good thing succeed so totally that I 
don't expect any of my future ideas will ever come close.

Internet is a strange place to be. Aminet is being run by a team of 60
administrators who, for the most part, have never seen each other or 
even talked to each other. Aminet is moderated by a Swiss who never
got closer than 1000 miles to the computer he does his work on. The 
uploads are contributed by people who, for the most part, are never 
going to know who they wrote them for.

We may not know each other. But the users of the Amiga are, more than
the users of any other computer in the world, and on the Internet
more than anywhere else, a community. And I am happy to have provided
one bond that keeps that community together.


THE PRESENT
-----------

Monthly downloads in thousands (at wuarchive). The recent decline
shows a shift to the mirrors, since wuarchive is full almost all of
the time. Newer data not available.

THE FUTURE
----------

There really isn't very much left that I can promise for the future.
What I promised last time is reality now. A few improvements are
still ahead, though:

So far Aminet is very hard to use for people with mail only access
to Internet. I plan to make their lives easier with a distributed
specialized mail server for Aminet, and a mail-upload facility.

Also planned is an Aminet CD access tool that combines the browsing
and searching capabilities of the current software without using 
Amigaguide for viewing. Don't expect it very soon, though.

But the last real step ahead I'm trying to get implemented is called 
annotations. This will allow everyone to stick a short comment to
the .readme file of somebody else's upload, thus turning Aminet into
a two-way communication medium. That way, you will for example be 
able to point out that a program does not run under AGA , or give 
a program a rating (which will be collected, averaged and published). 
The whole thing is quite complicated to get going, though, so give me 
some time....

And of course, if there is any additional service you would like to see 
in Aminet, just tell me. I'm running out of ideas :)


CREDITS
-------

There are countless people who keep Aminet going. I'd like to thank 
them all, but especially:

I hope you liked the service so far, and if you have any comments, wishes or
ideas, please to contact me. Let's hope we'll be able to see a 15,000 file
