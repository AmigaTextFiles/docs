DESCRIPTION

     Viper is a snake game, but is not just another snake game.
     It has many features that put it above typical snake games:

     - Ability to turn at any angle (rotation is controlled by two keys 
       for each player)
     - One to six players (3 max in shareware version)
     - Computer controlled players
     - Suicide speed for maximum challenge
     - Extensive tournament program to keep stats on games played
     - OS friendly, multitasks, runs from Workbench
     - Runs on virtually any screenmode (704 x 467 overscan)
     - AGA only graphics (128 colours)
     - Neat sound effects

     The essence of the game is this.  You cannot control the speed of 
     your snake, all you can do it turn.  As the game goes on the game gets 
     faster.  The longer you live the more points you get.  But, as you 
     travel along, you leave little spaces in your trail.  With some 
     practice, you can "thread" these holes not only for bonus points, 
     but also to escape being trapped by other players.  The game 
     continues, round after round until someone reaches the winning score 
     (selectable).

REASON FOR EXISTENCE

     The idea for Viper came from a shareware game called Dune III 
     (which has nothing to do with the commercial games Dune I and
     Dune II).  Unfortunately, Dune III doesn't like NTSC nor the
     AGA chipset, runs in low resolution, and doesn't multitask.
     
NEW FEATURES

     This lastest version will try and pick the best compatible screen 
     mode to use.  If you do not like the screen mode chosen, you can 
     force any screen mode by using a tooltype.  An included program will 
     give this tooltype for you.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     You need an AGA Amiga with 1.1MB of memory free from Workbench and 
     0.7MB of hard drive space.  Viper will run in PAL or NTSC.
