DESCRIPTION
         The Designer is a GUI creator which can produce source
          code in Assembler, C and HSPascal. The code production
          is handled by separate programs called Producers. The
          available archive is the demo version, with restricted
          save.
     
         +You can create windows using all of the GadTools Gadgets,
           Boolean Gadgets and BOOPSI Objects. Images can be
           included in some of these Gadgets or just drawn on the
           window.
         +Creation of Menus is supported with every GadTools menu
           option available including using images in your menus.
           All menus are V39 NewLook by default.
         +You can import IFF Images for use in windows, menus or
           just to be placed in your source code.
         +Editing screens is easy and allows the use of custom
           palettes and you can redefine the pens.
         +Create IDCMP handlers for windows and menus, just fill
           in the gaps.
         +Create shell programs that will compile and run for most
           projects.
         +Create Open Library and Open DiskFonts functions.
         +Just about every tag that it is possible to support up
           to V40 of the OS is supported in everything.
         +Full locale support with creation of .ct and .cd files
           automatically done.
         +10 demonstration programs showing most features of
           The Designer, each one implemented in Asm, C and HSPascal.
         +Extensive documentation in the form of AmigaGuide
           on-line help.
         +Ability to import GadToolsBox files.
         +Extensive customisation of code possible.
         +Developer information on Producers supplied.
         +Registered users can upgrade using the latest demo.
