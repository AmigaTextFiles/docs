EmSai Galactica and James Ossi announce their first
online survey about the Amiga.

We would essentially like to know how you use your Amiga,
and what your favourite 10 programs are
and if you intend to keep on supporting the Amiga.

It takes you only few minutes and you can answer anonymously.
You'll find the result updated every month.
And if you wish, you can enter your email address,
and the final results will be mailed to you when ready.

Our not so modest goal is the biggest Amiga survey ever made on the Net!
You can reach us at:

Go to the Amiga part and link to "Surveys".
Thanks for your collaboration!
