<B>WebPlug</B> is a MUI based HTML editor for the Amiga.<BR>
It's not WYSIWYG, but at least it will help you (hope a lot) when creating your web pages.<BR>
<P>
You can send your HTML page to any WWW-browser (as long as it has ARexx port) to see the progress, and to correct mistakes. By now, AWeb, IBrowse, Multiview and AMosaic are supported.<BR>Adding a new browser is just a matter of creating a new BrowserLink, an external library that tells WebPlug how to communicate with a given browser.

<P>
WebPlug offers a number of buttons/GUIs for the HTML tags. For example, the image button. This one will open a GUI where you can specify an image, it's AltText, it's border, etc... Then simply press 'Insert' (or use Drag'n'Drop if you prefer) and WebPlug will send the information its' editor.
<P>
Of course, it can use cut & paste. Simply mark a block of text and press 'Bold' in the styles list. WebPlug will cut the block, type the desired tags and paste again the text between these tags.
<P>
By now, WebPlug supports most important HTML tags, including some HTML-3 and Netscape&reg; tags, such as CENTER and others.<BR>WebPlug doesn't support Frames yet. Expect this feature on a newer version of this program. By now, this can be partially done using the CustomTagList of v1.2.<BR>
