 This drawer contains various preference files to properly set up your working environment
 so that the icons will be showed with the correct colours and resolution.<P>
 If you are already using the "<FONT COLOR="dark blue"><B>MagicWB</B></FONT>" colour scheme,
 you will not need to execute these files.<BR>
 If you are using some other kinds of icons you are greatly suggested to select the appropriate
 resolution by clicking the "Colours" icon.
<P>
 A complete preferences management tool is also included for your personal use.
The <A HREF="ist_buy.html">ARPrefs</A> program will let you choose the best way to display or 
play various kind of files ( i.e. mods, images, web pages etc... ).
Many powerful tools have already been selected by the Amy Resource staff, so that the most appropriate
software will always be activated when requested.
