E is an object oriented / procedural / unpure functional higher programming
language, mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada, Lisp etc.  It is a
general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga implementation is
specifically targeted at programming system applications.  The number of
features of the language is really too great to sum up entirely, and include:
speed of >20000 lines/minute on a 7 Mhz amiga, inline assembler and linker
integrated into compiler, large set of integrated functions, great module
concept with v39 includes as modules, flexible type-system, quoted
expressions, immediate and typed lists, parametric and inclusion polymorphism,
exception handling, inheritance, data-hiding, methods, multiple return values,
default arguments, register allocation, fast memory management, unification,
LISP-Cells, gui-toolkit, (macro-) preprocessor, very intuitive and powerful
source-level debugger, easy .library linking, and much more...

This is what 'HelloWorld' looks like in E:

/* nominated for Most Boring Example */

PROC main()
  WriteF('Hello, World!\\n')
ENDPROC
