    ProgED is a new programmers editor inspired from two great editors:
CygnusEd and GoldED. In this new editor I have plugged in all I found
useful for a programmer without useless frills. Somebody will found
many features in common with CygnusED and GoldED. I did this choice
to get an editor sufficiently flexibile (like GoldED) and fast and
simple like CygnusED.<BR>
    Starting from 2.0 release I've added a new preferences system
which allows you to define various "filetypes". This new system allows
you to define different preferences for each type of file managed.
