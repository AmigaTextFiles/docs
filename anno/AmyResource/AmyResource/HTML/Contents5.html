<H4>
   A very simple question like "What is BackMan?" has a very simple answer:
"More than a simple backup program".
<P>
<IMG SRC="img/BackMan.gif" WIDTH=237 HEIGHT=267 ALT="Finestra di BackMan" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0>
Anyway, these are the main features of BackMan:
<UL>
<LI> A very user-friendly <B>MUI</B> (MagicUserInterface) GUI (Graphical User Interface) which makes use of this program a lovable task.
<P>
<LI> Supports the <B>XPK</B> (eXternal PacKing) libraries for data compression and encryption, to save space and add security to your backups.
<P>
<LI> Supports <B>muFS</B> (MultiUser File System), a shareware project that provides file protection for multi-user Amiga environments.
<P>
<LI> Support for almost all the backup media (floppy disks, tapes,
removables, AmigaDOS files, etc.) and alternative devices
(<B>diskspare.device</B>, <B>mfm.device</B>, etc.).
</UL><P>
   These are only the features that BackMan has and other software have not.
All the usual features (file selection filters, incremental backups, etc.)
aren't mentioned here, but are available!
