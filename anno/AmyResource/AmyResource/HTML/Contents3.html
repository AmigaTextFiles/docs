With FontMachine you can take a plain font and make it shine with powerful
graphical effects such as textures, borders, bevels etc. FontMachine saves
fonts with the standard Amiga ColorFont format. This makes simple the use
of FontMachine fonts in any Amiga program. <B>Create your very own fonts NOW !</B>
<P>
FontMachine is a program in order to create characters for Desk Top Video or
other applications which need special characters.<BR>
It is based on an easy to use and intuitive interface. The generation of fonts
upto 256 colours in the AMIGA ColourFont format is done by using the numerous
graphical operators, which can be applied directly to the font in the desired
size.<BR>
The base font can be AmigaFont, Agfa CompuGraphic Font or ColourFont, without
limits regarding the size (they will be rescaled automatically).  There are
many graphicals operators available and can be applied all at the same time
without any limits.<BR>
It is possible to add borders of any type, reliefs, shadow and you can even
add anti-aliasing, which enhances the quality of the fonts. In addition to
this you can use up to two images (datatypes are supported), for creating the
border and the front of the font.
<P>
FontMachine can create textures like sky, ocean, flames, stormes, gold, satin
designed to be personalized and totally automatically. The colours of the
textures are recalculated automatically (Floyd-Steinberg and Random are also
available) in order to adapt their palettes to font. The user keeps control
of all actions by looking at the preview window.
<P>
Once you have defined a style, you can save it and add it to any other font.
FontMachine will recalcutate and generate the new font automatically.
