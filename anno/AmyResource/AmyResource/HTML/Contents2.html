   ImageStudio is written for the casual graphics user who wishes to
convert or manipulate various graphics formats on a modest Amiga
system. There are several commercial offerings available, however the
casual user is paying a lot of money for many facilities and options
they would probably never use.<P>

   Bitmap graphics, by their nature, usually require large amounts of
RAM. One of the main objectives of ImageStudio was to reduce this
burden by utilising virtual memory - most users have more spare hard
disk space than spare RAM.
<P>
   ImageStudio works with several buffers at any one time (dependant on
how many levels of undo are specified), each of these buffers can hold
either colour-mapped or 24-bit images. For a detailed description of
colour-mapped and 24-bit images, See Image types.
<P>
   ImageStudio comes with a fully featured ARexx port, which allows the
writing of macro scripts to automate repetative processes and also
allows communication with other ARexx aware programs. Again, ARexx has
the reputation of being "something pretty difficult", so we've
simplified the use of ARexx in ImageStudio by allowing the user to
create, edit and run scripts entirely within ImageStudio - ImageStudio
even provides a blank template as a starting point for each new script.
