     This  text  is  my  first attempt to expose to the Amiga community an idea쟅'd
like to develope.  Everything you're going to read here is just @{b}A PROPOSAL@{ub}쟞nd doesn't
relate to any real object, at the moment.  With this guide  I  hope쟴o get some
feedback from Amiga Users worldwide, about the possibility  and쟴he  real  need (if
any) to set up such a project.  It's very  difficult  to쟪now exactly if some similar
projects had been already discussed  in  the쟰ast, anyway I'm posting this text hoping
you won't be unnecessarily bored.

     Please  feel  free  to  contact  me  sending your opinion on what I'm쟷riting.
Send,  first  of  all,  your judgment about the project and its쟰robability  to  be
developed,  then  send me your point of view, all the쟳uggestions  you'd  like to write
about how to modify the structure of the쟰roject as to fit your needs. If I should
receive more good feedback than bad쟯ne, I'll try to start the project someway. Of
course any request for쟦elping me in this project will be highly appreciated.

     Let's try to explain what I'd like to do...

---@{fg shine}INTRODUCTION@{fg text}-------------------------------------------------------



          Fortunately the Amiga community has always been different from others systems
users  groups,  as  we  share an unbeatable passion and affection  for  our beloved
machine,  followed  by  a  great  force in developing  PD  and  Shareware software  as
well with strong efforts to collect  and  distribute  it worldwide (I'm thinking of
Aminet and other sources).   All  this  didn't  stop even during the last big
Commodore's crisis, as to demonstrate the unique power of Amiga users.

     I  was thinking about setting up a sort of meeting point, spread by the  Net  and
other  networks,  able  to  link  good  ideas  with  good programmers.   I  know  these
two things don't came always together, so there  could  be  someone  who  need  a
particular program or script but doesn't  know  how  to  do  it (or where to get it) or
a good programmer losing time searching for some good idea to develope.

     Here's  what  I  mean:  imagine a database (see next page about the possible  ways
of  releasing  it), where you can find @{b}IDEAS@{ub} coming from people  who need it, and,
possibly, followed by suggestions, coming from other  people, about similar programs
already existing, or programs just written  for  the  occasion by someone.  This kind
of database should be updated  quite  frequently,  giving the possibility (if the
system could become wide spread) to create a unique place to exchange ideas, without
the need to post to newsgroups or other complicated ways. So why don't we simply create a
new newsgroup dedicated only to Amiga-Ideas? Well, I know newsgroups are a great place
to look for help, but I found them very dispersing, they also need to be browsed
periodically, and old messages may be discarded. This AID could be solution for a clean,
fast and capacious place to store ideas and solutions, far from flames and unappropriate
postings, and possibly it will be delivered directly to your door via mailing lists.

     Items  should  be  sorted  by  @{b}difficulty, @{ub} by  @{b}type  @{ub}(conventional program, Arexx
script,  Scala  (tm)  script,  AmigaDOS script...), and should contain as much
information as possible to describe what the user need.   Replies  containing
suggestions about existing programs or brand new  programs should be sent directly to
the user who posted the request and to the database itself.

     Items lasting on the database for more than a specified time (let's say  about two
months), will be moved into a not-recent database, as to maintain  the main file more
comfortable to handle.  Programs and script realized  specifically  due  to AID
requests will be listed into another file.

     The  AID  archive could be maintained in several formats, allowing the  wider
distribution  possible.   For a list of hypotetical formats, let's see the next page..


                                                  --> @{"Click Here" link "STRUCTURE" 0} <--
@endnode

@node "STRUCTURE" "Possible structure of AID."
---@{fg shine}STRUCTURE@{fg text}-----------------------------------------------------------

     
     AID requests should be sent by email to maintainer(s) of AID archive, and the 
updated archive could be spread by mailing lists or FTP.

     AID could be maintained in different file formats. Some of them may require
dedicated browsers. Anyway, the starting point should be:

      ASCII text: suitable for every way of distribution (such as 
                   mailing lists) and highly post-processing-able.
                   No need to use Amiga to read it.
                   Actually this format should be the starting point
                   for any other successive reprocessing.


     Next formats could be automatically generated and maintained starting from the
original AID ascii file:


      AMIGAGUIDE format: Easier to browse, as the browser is now
                          quite universal on recent Amigas.

      HTML format: Suitable for WWW online/offline reading
                    Capability to connect directly to Aminet or other
                    FTP sites containing the AID linked software.

      DEDICATED format: such as David Ekholm's DB. Improved search
                         and print capabilities.
                         Anyway dedicated formats should be handled 
                         with care.

-----

     More in depth, AID should feature special fields and sort of begin/end blocks
allowing easier handling and processing. Most of these fields and structures has to be
defined. 

Anyway, some of the most important fields should be:

-- Legend:
     * = obligatory field
     + = may include several lines of text
     % = Edited and/or updated by the maintainers of AID
-------------------------------------------


 DATE (*%): Date of the request 

 ID (*%): Number of the request

 SHORT (*): Short title for the AID request
         example: "Program for calculating lunar eclipses.."

 FULL (*+): Full description of the requested program

 FROM (*+): Address(es) of the user requesting the program

 TITLE: Supposed short title for the software, just for easy
         searching and linking

 DIFFICULTY: If known or supposed, the difficulty expressed in digits
              from 0 (just the time to type it down) to 10 (a very
              high-end program)

 TYPE: If known or supposed, this is the type of program needed
        examples: Conventional, AmigaDos Script, Arexx, Scala(tm) script
                  library, c/c++/basic/E/assembler source code etc..

 SIMILAR (+): Similar programs (even commercial) known BY THE USER
               REQUESTING the program, but not fully fitting his needs

 FEATURES (+): All main features and options needed

 NOTES (+): Whatever the user wants

 LINKS (+): If any, links to other similar software requests in AID current
         or not-recent database. This field could be edited by the user
         or by the maintainers of AID archive.

 ANSWER (%+): This field should contain every reply to the AID request
                (see example page)
                ---------------------------------------------

All standards have to be defined accurately, meanwhile all I can do is try to imagine a
sample ascii page of an AID archive.

---@{fg shine}EXAMPLE@{fg text}-------------------------------------------------------------


     Following previous guidelines, an AID ascii file should look like this (begin/end
blocks have to be defined yet).

 I'm trying to develope it in AmigaE! Stay tuned.
 Email me for a demo version 



(...etc)

     This is the "rich-ascii" format, a "soft" ascii format could be easier to 
read directly without a browser, anyway from the basic rich format we could build
other standards automatically.

     Well, if you think this kind of database would be useful for us, please drop me a
line, we can try to build it up!.

     I've   just   recently   joined   the  Net,  discovering  its  huge capabilities,
this idea for the AID project was originally conceived for the  local Italian User
Group "AET:  Amiga Expert Team", but I'd like to suggest  it  to  the  whole Amiga
community worldwide.  As stated in the @{"PREFACE" link "Preface" 0},  please  need  to  know your opinion
about this project and the probability  to  set it up.  Any kind of support and
suggestions will be very appreciated.  Thanks everyone!.
