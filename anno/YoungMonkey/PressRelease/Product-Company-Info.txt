==========================================================================

'young monkey' began as the vision of two musicians.  Over a decade ago,
it was just two people, an analog drum machine, two analog synthesizers,
a Commodore 64 and lot of hoping and dreaming.  Much has changed since
then... 'young monkey' has grown to include a professional audio/video
production facility, recording studio, creative design studio, and a
hardware and software development studio.  Projects have included film
soundtracks, audio recordings and book publications to name just a few.
We have even managed two TopTen alternative dance songs.  Even through
all that, one thing still holds it all together... 'young monkey' is a
birthplace for new ideas and dreams.

'young monkey' has always been about creativity and originality.  In
order to meet this expectation of ourselves, we began developing custom
software and hardware to facilitate creative ideas.  There has been much
interest in our developments and we have often been approached about our
one-of-a-kind devices and software.  With this in mind, we have started
assembling the pieces... it is time to share dreams.

==========================================================================

Future Development
------------------
One important thing to note about 'young monkey' is that we use all of
our software and hardware products ourselves.  For this reason, our
products will continue to evolve long into the future.  All of our
products are designed by people who use the products on a daily basis.
We have included many time saving features developed through years of
experience and put the features that are needed most often right at your
fingertips.

We are very excited about what we have to offer, and look forward to
helping others towards finding their own dreams.  We are very open to
suggestions and new ideas and hope to hear from others out there.

In addition to other software products, not listed here, we are currently
developing low-cost DSP and MIDI hardware for integration with our
software and for third party applications.


Technical Support
-----------------
We understand the frustrations of buying computer products and not being
able to get needed support.  We have been in that position ourselves.

'young monkey' will offer Internet support through EMail, a WWW
Information System, FTP and more.  We also have a couple surprises in the
works.  Of course... you can still send us letters through the postal
service.

Free software updates will be available online as often as daily.  If a
bug is found, you will not have to wait six months, or more, for a new
release.  We will do our best to fix the problem and have an update online
as soon as possible.


Developers
----------
To faciliate the need for our customers to develop their own ideas for
integration in our products, 'young monkey' will offer several developer
programs.


==========================================================================
                       GENERAL PRODUCT INFORMATION
==========================================================================

OS Compliant
------------
All software code follows Amiga OS guidelines and rules to ensure OS
compatibility.


Intuitive Interfaces
--------------------
User-friendly design: including WYSIWYG-like features that all programs
should have, such as smart gadgets.  For example:  If a particular numeric
entry gadget should not allow negative values, it will not let the user
enter a negative sign, rather than changing it after you press enter. -or-
If a gadget will have no effect at a particular time, it is disabled.


External Control
----------------
Where applicable, all software will be extensively controllable through
ARexx.


Third Party Support
-------------------
Where possible, support will be added for third party system
enhancements, such as: MIDI libraries, graphics cards and audio hardware.

                               PRELIMINARY
                      DETAILED PRODUCT INFORMATION

Please note: not all features are listed and not all listed features will
be ready for the first release, but will be available in following
updates.

As well as operating independantly, a special software control system
will allow integration of these programs within each other.  For example:
The ability to directly read waveform data from a sampler disk (via the
'Sampler Utility' module) into a waveform buffer within 'WaveFormer'.


==========================================================================
                               SIMthesizer
==========================================================================

'SIMthesizer' is a waveform generator/modifier that combines mutiple
synthesis technologies, including: analog, digital, wavetable, additive,
subtractive, granular, frequency modulation, phase modulation,
waveshaping, phonetic speech, Ghunöga, Re-Haus and more.

As well as generating new sounds, 'SIMthesizer's' extensive waveform
modification features can be used to enhance existing sound sample data.

The 'SIMthesizer' design engine is very intuitive and can be easily
understood by both novices and experts.  Multiple components, called
'Elements', are arranged on a grid and joined together as 'SIMths'.
Commonly used element configurations can be combined as macro elements,
called 'modules'.


Education
---------
The simplicity of 'SIMthesizer' makes it an ideal educational tool, as
well.  Beginning with as few as 2 elements (Sound Source element + Output
element) waveforms can be generated and visually/audibly studied.  As the
sound designer gains an understanding of audio basics, new elements can
be added to create enhanced and more complex sound structures.

Many tutorials and sample 'SIMths' will be included.


Emulation
---------
In attempting to emulate existing synthesizer technologies, several
important factors must be considered:

   Instability
   -----------
   Hardware components used in early analog synthesizers often colored
   sounds with parasitic variations.  Though sometimes unwanted, these
   variations could be used to enhance sounds.  Used properly, "thicker"
   and uncontrolled/unexpected, but desirable, harmonic content can be
   generated.  Newer technologies no longer capture the element of
   surprise like the good old days: "ZAP! Sizzle! What happened. What it
   is doing. WOW! What a great sound!"

   Inherent Noise
   --------------
   All synthesizers contain some level of inherent noise, caused by
   parasitic imperfections in the electronic components.  This noise is
   always present in the background and contributes to the instrument's
   signature 'sound'.  As more studios turn to full digital recording,
   engineers are sometimes finding it necessary to introduce noise into
   digital recordings to get a particular 'feel'.

To better emulate these kinds of factors, 'SIMthesizer' includes several
enhanced features:

   Parasitic Parameters
   --------------------
   'SIMthesizer' allows the assignment of Parasitic parameters in several
   areas.  This exciting feature provides the sound designer with the
   capability of creating subtle to extreme variations on built-in
   algorithms.

   Signature Profiles
   ------------------
   'Noise' Signature Profiles of various manufacturer's products will be
   included as controllable parameters.

In keeping with 'young monkey' philosophy, every original copy of
'SIMthesizer' will have a different internal Parasitic factor.  This
ensures that sounds created on one copy of 'SIMthesizer' will not sound
exactly the same as on another.


Elements
--------
Where applicable, elements have extensive parameter and modulation
capabilities.

   Sound Sources
   -------------
      Oscillator: Sin/Cosine, Sawtooth/Triangle, Pulse Width
      Sample: External sound sample data file



      Wavetable: Multi-sample loops
      Phonetic Speech: Phonetics based waveform generation
      Noise: Color controlled parametric equalization where noise spectrum
             can be defined using an RGB palette selector.  This feature
             provides the ability to create noise content other than the
             standard White/Pink.

      - Modulation parameters: Pitch, symmetry, amplitude.


   Outputs/Monitors
   ----------------
      Oscillocope, speaker, file, standard MIDI transfer.


   Envelopes
   ---------
      Fully controllable/programable Envelopes are available for
      modulation of Sound Sources, Wave Shapers, Filters and other
      Envelopes.

      : Exponential, dampen, DC offset, gate, linear envelope

      - Modulation parameters: amplitude.


   Mathematical Functions
   ----------------------
      These functions provide a means to mix and modify sounds.

      : Sum, multiply, average, gain, integration, differentiation,
        cross-fade.


   Feedback / Echo / Delay
   -----------------------
      Multi-Element feedback registers allow generated signals to modulate
      themselves and/or other element's parameters.


   Filters
   -------
      Provide a means of emphasizing/suppressing harmonic content.

      : Low, high, band pass, notch reject, all pass.

      - Modulation parameters: Cut-off frequency, resonance/Q


   Transforms
   ----------
      Allow direct modification of waverform shape using algorithms
      based on gamma curves, parabolas, sinusoids, linearity,
      non-linearities (such as diodes) and arbitrary shapes.

      - Modulation parameters: dependant on the shaping algorithm.


Clipping
--------
Should any potential clipping occur at any point in the sound generation
process, the 'element icon', where clipping would occur, is highlighted
and the sound designer may examine the waveform and consider
modifications.  Because 'SIMthesizer' generates sounds in a higher
resolution than the ouput waveform, clipping will not actually occur, but
warnings will be generated to show elements where clipping would exist on
the output waveform.


Data Conversion
---------------
8/12/16/24/32 bit data conversion.

Raw, IFF-8SVX, AIFF, NeXT, Sun, Wave, U-Law, A-Law, AVR, Mac, IRCAM, Voc,
SampleVision, etc.

'WaveFormer' is a waveform editing system designed to work standalone or
in conjunction with professional sampling hardware and third party audio
cards.  Support for hard disk recording hardware is planned.

Includes many time saving features such as 'free-hand repair mode' which
adjusts bad sample data.  For example: given levels '0 5 10 32767 10 0',
the level 32767 is very likely to be incorrect.  To repair it, simply
drag the mouse over the offending sample and it is adjusted to '0 5 10 5
