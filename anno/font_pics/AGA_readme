    Please feel free to download the file list in the filebase under
misc/text/aga_file_list.lha. It is updated nightly. Also, we are now
receiving mailing lists both publically and privately, including news
from Imagine, Lightwave, Real3D, Commodore-Amiga, Excelsior BBS, AMOS,
Emplant, and more. I urge all callers to download the file in the filebase
under misc/text/america.lha. It will open your eyes to America's future
as a nation and a global leader, and is also updated on a regular basis.
