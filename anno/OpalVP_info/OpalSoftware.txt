OpalVision Switcher:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selectable Preview, Program, and Preset busses allow switching flexibility 
when used with the OpalVision Video Suite.  Up to 9 video inputs are 
available, and the bus input buttons can be user-customized with names.  
The user also has the option to define the first three composite inputs on 
the Video Suite as a second RGB or YUV input.  Allows unlimited number of 
effects, all effects are icon-based, and effects are classified into 
categories (also user-configurable) for easy "drag-and-drop" grouping of 
often-used effects.  Includes dual on-screen video and audio T-bars, which 
can be manually moved with the mouse separately or together.  Features an 
on-screen slider for effect speed (in time units) and buttons for F,M,S 
speeds (configurable to time) as well as AUTO and TAKE buttons.  All 
switcher settings, including effect speed and video and audio settings, can 
be tied into an "Event List" for automated switcher control, and the Event 
List can be triggered by several sources, including mouse, keyboard, and 
GPI trigger.  The OpalVision Switcher is fully AREXX compatible.


COMPLETE AUTOMATED AUDIO MIXER AND AUDIO-FOLLOWS-VIDEO SWITCHER
---------------------------------------------------------------
When used in conjuction with the OpalVision Video Suite, features full 
audio-follows-video capability, plus an on-screen mixer with sliders for 
each of the 5 stereo audio inputs.  The on-screen sliders control either 
volume or EQ.  All audio control is linked with video.


FRAME GRABBING CAPABILITY
-------------------------
Freeze any incoming video source from the OpalSwitcher or from OpalPaint, 
and save it.  Can grab either a full frame or a single field, and also 
allows multiple frame grabs at reduced size and/or resolution.  When 
grabbed from OpalPaint, motion-removal can be performed, either globally or 
isolated by region, using the "DeInterlace" draw mode and any OpalPaint 
drawing tool.  Also supports several selected single-frame controllers for 
serial control of decks (with time code), allowing frame-accurate 
rotoscoping (grab any time-code marked frame from video).


FRAMESTORE CAPABILITY
---------------------
Allows access to framestores from any user-specified location on the hard 
drive.  Also allows frames currently located in one of OpalPaint's spare 
buffers to be instantly accessed directly from the switcher.  Creates 
automatic background gradients, with selectable direction and color.


VECTOR AND PIP FX EDITOR
------------------------
Using a keyframe system, allows user-defined wipes (Vector) and DVE moves 
(PIP) with an on-screen spline-based editor.  A wide assortment of DVEs or 
wipes can be created in this fashion, with each keypoint of the on-screen 
spline cure having its own independent position, size, and rotation (X,Y) 
information.  Editing is accomplished with the mouse, and is completely 
interactive, with the final effect performed immediately.  Effects can be 
saved and loaded, and IFF brushes can be used for effect icons.  Also, 
Amiga animations (of any format, including AGA) can be used as templates 
for wipes.


CHROMA/LUMA KEYER
-----------------
Provides complete support for chroma and luma keying, either between two 
video inputs (using the Video Suite) or between 24-bit graphics and a 
single video input.  The luma keyer supplies control over bright and dark 
key clip level, and the chroma keyer provides for definable color (key on 
blue, green, red, or any base color) and clip range for that color.  The 
chroma keyer also supports the Video Processor's "Chroma Sandwich Key", 
which allows a user-defined stencil to be created in OpalPaint, which is 
then used as a "mask" to allow a second layer of 24-bit graphics to be 
inserted into a chroma key.  Thus, chroma-keyed video not only passes in 
front of 24-bit graphics, but also behind the stenciled portions as well.


CHROMACTRL EDITOR
-----------------
Functionally similar to the ChromaCTRL draw mode in OpalPaint, this editor 
allows numerous color processing effects on video in real-time.  Adjust 
brightness, contrast, color, gamma, create your own color maps or load maps 
created from OpalPaint.  Includes several color processing effects, 
including Nuke, Posterize, Enhance, Gamma, and several others.


MULTI-PROGRAM LAUNCH CAPABILITY
-------------------------------
OpalPaint and OpalCG can be launched and controlled directly from the 
switcher.  Any Workbench program can also be launched directly from within 
the switcher interface screen, with full Workbench icon support.



OpalCG:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpalCG offers full 35ns text capability (on A3000 or A4000) with selectable 
font size, color, outline, drop shadow, and anti-aliasing.  Support Amiga, 
Compugraphic, and Color fonts, with Compugraphic fonts supporting any 
arbitrary size.  All fonts can be changed on a character-by-character 
basis, and "style lists" can be created to change defined groups of 
characters or blocks of text all at once.  Supports mouse-based text 
highlighting, and text can be cut and pasted with full clipboard support 
(paste text from any clipboard-compatible text editor or word processor 
into the CG, even multitasking in the background).  OpalCG can also create 
draggable boxes of text (ASCII import), graphic separators, or IFF brushes 
or pictures.  All boxes are draggable and positionable.  OpalCG offers 
several types of pages, including scroll and 24-bit, and can create pages 
with semi-transparent text and drop shadows over video.  Multiple pages can 
be defined, and a sequence of pages can be controlled by a timeline, with 
mouse, AREXX, or time code triggers supported for advancing each page.  
OpalCG also features its own event list for each page, where lines of text 
can have their own transition effect.  CG pages can be incorporated 
directly into the switcher.



OpalPIP software:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allows any video input or still image to be displayed in a draggable, 
scrollable, and resizable window on the Amiga workbench.  Also allows 
zooming in and out, and has AREXX control to allow remote operation from 
other software.
