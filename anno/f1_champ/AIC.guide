 *********************************************************************

 If you havent already changed the setting's using F1GP-ED you should
 change the following......

 @{u}TEAMS@{uu}

 Set this to 13 and Highlight the Normal Risk Factor box.
 You can use whichever team number you want , make sure you
 change the team name and add your name as the driver and select
 the none option as your teamate.
 Horespower must be set to 716
 Change your car colour and pit crew if you want.

 @{u}Drivers@{uu}

 Make sure your name is the selected driver.
 Change your helmet colour if you want.

 @{u}Standard Options@{uu}

 Select Auto Gears - Dotted Best Line and Suggested Gear.
 Practice sessions can have whatever time limit you want.
 Qualifying must be 30 minutes.
 Race Distance should be set to 40%

 @{u}Preferences@{uu}

 Set wet race probability to 0% if there is to be a wet race in the
 season you can change this to 100% before the race and resave you
 f1gp binary file.

 @{u}Cheats@{uu}

 Unselect everything in this window also make sure
 PLayer Hp is 716 and Finish Hp is also 716

 @{u}Display@{uu}

 Frames/sec: should be changed to 10.

 And thats all you have to change using F1GP-Ed

 You may use utilities such as Agperf and Splitime

 Agplaptime MUST be used (without the computer cars) Results will only
 be accepted if accompanied by the race log.

 Although it may be tempting if you spin to press F3 to auto correct the
 spin DONT the same goes for Using Indestructable at the start of a race
 It is CHEATING and very tempting at the same time.

 During anypart of a Race or Qualifying session you may pause and save the
 session and restart later, However please dont if you crash on lap 3
 just start the race again.

 After crossing the finishing line pause the game and save it, Keep this
 file safe until the results are posted , incase there is any suspicion
 of cheating.

 Scoring is as follows

 Points are awarded for qualifying positions remember you are qualifying
 against the computer controlled cars as well as the other members of
 the AIC so although you may be on Pole for a Race you could be 2 seconds
 short of the "Real" Pole Position times.

  @{u}Qualifying Points@{uu}

   1st   10 points
   2nd    8 points
   3rd    7 poibts       As you can see getting a good fast qualifying
   4th    6 points       time on a regular basis could boost your
   5th    5 points       your championship position.
   6th    4  points
   7th    3  points
   8th    2  points
   9th    1  points


 @{u}Race Points@{uu} are as follows

 1st  100 points
 2nd  80  points
 3rd  75  points      Hopefully this scoring system will
 4th  70  points      keep the championship close.
 5th  65  points
 6th  60  points
 7th  30  points
 8th  20  points
 9th  10  points

 You must follow the specific Guide of how to send your results in
 (dont worry about that bit yet , you will be told how to do that
 if you join the AIC)

 Try not to shunt other cars off the track during racing sometimes
 its difficult not to I know but try and be sporting.


 .....and thats the rules for the Championship is your still interested
