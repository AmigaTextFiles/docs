DESCRIPTION

     This packages is a demonstration version of Pro-Net V2.0C, a
     Schematic Capture program which allows you to create a circuit
     quickly and easily.  Several sample Library Device are provided which
     allow for experimentation and a basis for easy modification of
     existing devices to new logic families.  This demo is fully
     functional except that it cannot save schematic pages.

     The following description describes the commercial release of the
     software.  Several of the features described here require the ability
     to save pages in order to work.

     Pro-Net supports multiple page schematics with Page Referencing
     (industry first), and Net List connections can be made directly on
     one page or indirectly on any number of pages by means of Signal
     Names applied to the Signal Lines.

     Device Labels are tracked and automatically inserted when the device
     is called out.  Multiple device gates per package are directly
     supported (i.e. 7400 Quad NAND).  Device and Pin Swapping is
     supported with error checking.  Device Labels can be assigned by
     Zones so that logical gates will not share a physical device with
     gates in another area (industry first).  Device Labels, Device
     Numbers, and Pin Numbers may also be hidden, if desired.

     Signal Lines can be bundled together for cleaner schematics and
     Bundles can be named for more readable schematics.

     The hierarchical command structure groups commands by mode and is
     implemented by context-sensitive Intelligent Function Keys (IFKs).

     Powerful commands augment schematic creation: Demorgan equivalence,
     Rubberbanding, Grid Snap, Grid Display, Grid Size control, Bus
     Bundling, Signal Name stepping, Move, Repeat, Copy, etc.

     New devices can be quickly and easily drawn and described.

     Variable template sizes support MIL-STD 860.

     Page size ranges from A to E.
