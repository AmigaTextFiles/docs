Subject: Amiga NetHack 3.1.1 Official Binaries Now Available
Status: RO

(Ok - here we go again.  Thanks,
Ken Lorber, for the Amiga NetHack Team)

We are pleased to announce the release of the official binaries for
Amiga NetHack 3.1.1.   3.1.1 is a maintenance update with a few new
features and many fewer bugs.  Improvements to the Amiga version
include initial sound support and faster loading.

NOTE: old save files and bones files will NOT work with the new binaries.
      This includes save and bones files from NetHack3.1.0.

The official binaries have been uploaded to aminet and should be
available from the various mirrors shortly.  They will also be available for
anonymous ftp from linc.cis.upenn.edu (130.91.6.8) in a few days in
pub/NH3.1/binaries/amiga.  The sources are also available on that
system in pub/NH3.1/sources.  Please restrict transfers from linc to
non-business hours (USA east coast time).

The distribution consists of two .lzh files and a file called readmefirst.
The sizes of the two .lzh files are:
	426515 nh311am1.lzh
	459730 nh311am2.lzh

NetHack is copyrighted but freely redistributable - please see the file
license in the distribution for details.

                Amiga NetHack 3.1 -- Unpacking

The Amiga NetHack binary distribution comes in two .lzh files:  If you
are unpacking to floppy unpack each archive on a different disk; if you
are unpacking to a harddisk unpack them both to the same directory.
Installation instructions are in the ReadMe file in the top level
directory.

For problems with the archives please contact keni@oasys.dt.navy.mil
or use the central address nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.

Below is the general announcement for NetHack 3.1:


                NetHack 3.1 -- General information

NetHack 3.1 is a new generation of the dungeon exploration game NetHack.
It is a distant descendent of Hack, and a direct descendent of NetHack 3.0.
It is the product of two years of very intensive effort by the NetHack
Development Team and its porting sub-teams.  Many parts of 3.0 were
rewritten for NetHack 3.1, and many new features were added.

NetHack 3.1.1 is the first revision to NetHack 3.1.

                  -- Good luck, and happy Hacking --
