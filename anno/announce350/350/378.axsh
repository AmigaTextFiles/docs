DESCRIPTION

     AXsh's main purpose is to let other users have access to your
     Amiga and still be sure that nothing inappropriate can happen.
     AXsh ensures this by allowing access only to directories that are
     defined accessible and only accepting commands and arguments that
     are defined legal.

     AXsh supports multiple lines, multiple users logged in
     simultaneosly and 8 different user levels. User actions can be
     saved into a log file. Each user has his/her own home directory,
     but the used disk space can be/is restricted.

     AXsh can be used as a bulletin board system with or without
     UUCP or as a door program in a 'normal' BBS. It has its own mail,
     news and file transfer programs. However, AXsh is not restricted
     to remote access, it can be very well used as a local shell.

     The shell itself has command line editing, function key macros,
     history, aliases, variables and scripts. It also has filename and
     commandname completion assigned to the TAB key. VT100, Ansi and
     dumb terminal modes are currently supported.

     The shell uses Unix-like paths, which are converted to AmigaDOS
     paths before executing the commands.

     Many useful programs are included in the packet and any CLI-based
     programs can easily be added.

     AXsh systems can be connected together to form a network, so that
     mail and news are exchanged between systems. You can also use UUCP
     instead of the native AXsh net system or you can use another
     transport mechanism like Fidonet (TrapDoor) to transfer AXsh net
     packets. News and mail programs are configurable to fully interface
     with UUCP or CNews.

     If you have WB2.1, you can choose the used language from English,
     Finnish, Spanish, French, Danish and Swedish. New 2.0 features are
     also used, but you can still use AXsh with ks1.3 if you have
     arp.library.


NEW FEATURES

     Can use 2.0 resident commands and exports all variables to local
     shell variables. Also other new features support the use of various
     news and mail readers.

     Slightly improved command line editor has now a dumb-mode for dumb
     terminals.

     Rn can be configured to work on its own, with plain UUCP or with Cnews.

     Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

     Read the file AXshUpdates1.3 for details.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     arp.library (v39) OR ks2.0

     LhA to unpack the archive


SUGGESTED ENVIRONMENT

     A hard disk, about 1M for a basic one-user system without news

     At least 1M of memory, KS2.04 & WB2.1 or greater

     A modem for remote access


HOST NAME/FILE NAME

     nic.funet.fi:/pub/amiga/shells/AXsh/AXsh-1.3-demo.{lha,readme}
     nic.funet.fi:/pub/amiga/shells/AXsh/AXshSupport.{lha,readme}
     (128.214.6.100)

     And all aminet-sites,
     situated under util/shell,
       AXsh-1.3-demo.{lha,readme} and AXshSupport.{lha,readme}

     One of them is:

     ftp.luth.se:/pub/amiga/util/shell/AXsh-1.3-demo.{lha,readme}
     ftp.luth.se:/pub/amiga/util/shell/AXshSupport.{lha,readme}
     130.240.18.2 (New TCP/IP number!)


PRICE

     Suggested shareware/registration fee is US$30


DISTRIBUTABILITY

     The demo version can be freely distributed, provided that the
     contents of the archive remain intact. However, also the
     demo version is shareware and only intended for evaluation.


IMPORTANT!

     This can be the last 1.3-compatible version. However, bugfixes will
     be done for registered users, if needed. The next version will be
     totally new inside, writing applications will be easier, the security
     will improve etc. If there is enough interest (and registrations),
     I might consider making a 1.3-compatible version also.


OTHER

     AXsh version 1.3 will be available by BMS and probably also from
     fidonet fairly soon (at least the previous version was spread quite
     quickly). I hope that BMS-sites and Fidonet nodes that get the
     files, also announce that they have them in alt.sys.amiga.uucp.
     If you absolutely need to get the package quicly AND your system
     accepts big mail packets, you can request it directly from my
     Internet E-mail address: po87553@cs.tut.fi .
