           Incontro dei Programmatori Italiani per lo Sviluppo Amiga
                                 Third Edition

                                Call for Papers

                           Saturday, November 6 1993
                                 Milano, Italy

  IPISA is an annual meeting autonomously organized by a group of people
interested in computer science, programming and applications of the Amiga line
of computers.

  The meeting is dedicated to the presentation and diffusion of projects,
experiences and non-commercial products which have been developed using Amigas.
As in the previous events, it will be possible to discuss research programs or
job contacts with people otherwise difficult to reach.

  The meeting, one day in length, is laid out as a series of twenty
minute and forty-five minute talks. During these talks the Italian
language must be used to communicate. The proceedings consist of paper
documentation and software on magnetic support.  The paper documentation will be
edited by the editorial board of the electronic magazine AUGS Newsletter.

  The organizers invite to submit proposals in the form a 300 words abstract,
which must be received by May 1, 1993. The submission of papers to be published
in the proceedings independently of their public exposition is encouraged (if
necessary, the space presumably occupied on the magnetic support has to be
specified). The papers can be submitted in English or Italian.

  In case the author desires to personally exhibit his or her work, it is
necessary to specify the estimated duration of the talk. The authors will
receive confirmation of their participation by June 1, 1993, and will have to
send the complete papers for proceedings inclusion by September 15, 1993.

  Subscription costs will cover all expenses, and will be, all being well, less
than 20,000 Italian lire.

  Organizing committee: Roberto Attias, Vittorio Calzolari, Fabrizio Lodi,
Sergio Ruocco (chair), Carlo Santagostino, Paolo Silvera, Reinhard Spisser,
Carlo Todeschini, Marco Zandonadi.
