I sent this to you a week ago but haven't gotten a reply or seen it

NAME

       Digital Breadboard v1.1

AUTHOR

       Dan Griffin (griffin@egr.msu.edu)

DESCRIPTION

       Digital Breadboard is a full GUI digital circuit simulator. Digital
       Breadboard currently supports 2 and 3 input AND, OR, NAND, and NOR 
       gates, NOT and XOR gates, D, JK, and SR edge-triggered flip-flops,
       multiple independant clocks, switched and pulsed inputs, outputs, 
       Vcc, GND, independant 4-channel oscilloscope, event counters, 
       variable speed timer, preferences printing, and more.

NEW FEATURES

       v1.1 is primarily a bug fix, with some attention given to the user
       interface anomalies that have bugged some people. :)  Also provides
       for more program control over the printer and is PAL friendly.
