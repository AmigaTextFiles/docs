 ********* Pre-Announcement of Mailing-list for Kanji-Amiga users *******


	 All of you who are interested on currents of Japanese-version
of Amiga Computers, we are about to start the first Mailing-list directed
to the Amiga community in Japan.

	Problem is, due to the language-barriers between 1 byte-based 
Alphabet languages and 2 bytes-based Asian languages, at first we are 
considering this to be circulated only on JUNET(Japan Unix Network) where
Kanji-written(Japanese-EUC coded) transactions are standard.

	In case you have great interest, but don't have the system/knowledge
to read Japanese, please E-mail me to the account cited below. If the
responses from outside-Japan pass beyond 100, then Japanese<->English
translation will be done on all posts. If it doesn't reach 100, then we will 
dump the translation process and keep this in JUNET only. (Those of you who've
subscribed, will get the notification if this will be done or not.)

	Those who have Japanese-enabled-system installed on your terminal(like 
ANS for Amiga, KanjiTalk for Mac, JLE for Sun, DOS 5.0-J for PC-Compatibles) 
can also get the circulations in Kanji-form. 

WHAT TOPICS WILL BE COVERED??

	The topics will cover everything relating to Amiga's circulated
here in Japan. If you are a software developer and happen to have interest in
Japanese Amiga market, here is your chance. If you work as a Japanese
professor and happen to own an Amiga, you'll know how to creat your own 
Kanji-fonts in ANS. If you work in a computer-graphics production, you'll be 
surprised how many Amiga-created TV graphics are shown on here in Tokyo. 

WHEN WILL THIS START??

	We are about to get certification from our system manager. Therefore 
the name of this mailing-list address is not eligible at this time, but it 
should start running within 1-2 weeks. But like I said before, if requests 
from outside-Japan don't reach over 100, it won't be cirulated outside the 
JUNET community and no English translation will be given. No annoucements
will made here later on, also.

THEN WHERE CAN I SUBSCRIBE??

	If you want this to be circulated over Internet w/English translation,
send us your Internet address before April 20th, in the following simple form:
