At the end of this message is the ragged-right version of the
press release.  I appreciate your posting it.

I don't know what you consider to be an advertisment, but the magazine
will have ads on how to sign up to the various online services, and
a dealer listing in each issue.  I hope this doesn't count as
advertisements.

As for removing duplicate stuff, I'd rather not have two versions
of the magazine floating around.  I'm certain that there will be
people that would capture the entire issue from .announce, archive
it and post it elsewhere, and I'd like to keep it 100% intact.

Also, for what it's worth, 99% of what's in there is right-justified.

Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Rob
