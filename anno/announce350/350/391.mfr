 TITLE

    Magic File Requester (MFR)


 VERSION

    2.0e is available but we HIGHLY suggest 2.0d exclusively.


 AUTHOR

    Stefan Stuntz (stuntz@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)


 DESCRIPTION

  - MFR is a highly enhanced and highly configurable replacement to the
    AmigaDOS ASL file requester (not to mention it's much faster!).  On any
    program that calls the standard ASL file requester, MFR will patch
    it's self into the executing program, making it call MFR instead of
    the ASL requester.  All you really have to do to use MFR is to put it in
    your WBStartup drawer, then you just set it up they way you like!

  - MFR  is  completely controllable via keyboard, so you will never have to
    touch  your mouse when selecting files (of course you can, if you really
    want to).

  - MFR will use any font you want in its display.  Proportional  fonts like
    helvetica look really marvellous.

  - MFR  has  the  ability to quickly search your hard disk for any file, so
    you needn't remember each file's directory.

  - MFR offers a powerful directory caching mechanism.

  - MFR can display pictures, play sounds, view archives, etc.  with the aid
    of some external programs.

  - MFR has a history list.

  - MFR looks very nice, especially on high resolution screens.

  - MFR has a sizing gadget.

  - MFR takes advantage of new Kick 2.0 features like file notification.

  - MFR can be customized through a wide range of tooltypes and menu items.

  - MFR is fast.

  - MFR is simply magic :-)


 NEW FEATURES

    A new US/Canada (North America) registration site to make registering
    your MFR faster and easier.  For information EMailed to you, you may
    contact:

    robertb@liquid.albany.ny.us

    You will be mailed information on how to obtain your MFR registration
    in the US and Canada.  Just leave your EMail address again in the message
    in case the reply path gets munged.


 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

 PRICE

 DISTRIBUTABILITY

     archive is freely distributable.  Users who are satisfied with MFR and
     use it frequently are ask to register their MFR to assure support and
     newer revisions of the program.
