DESCRIPTION

ACE is a PD Amiga BASIC compiler which, in conjunction with A68K and Blink
produces standalone executables. No special run-time shared libraries are 
required.
 
The language is both a subset and superset of AmigaBASIC with many features
not found in the latter such as: turtle graphics, recursion, SUBs with return
values, structures, arguments, include files, a better WAVE command which 
allows for large waveforms, external references, named constants and several
extra functions.

In total, ACE currently supports some 150 commands and functions. 

ACE is still under development, but is quite usable in its present form.

NEW FEATURES

	1. Better compile-time error handling.
	2. Exponential and fixed-point single-precision values
	   are now recognised by all ACE commands and functions
	   as well as in program text. In v1.0, exponential format
	   was only recognised in program text, not by INPUT, VAL etc.
	3. BASIC line numbers are now supported by ACE, not just labels.
	   This is for backward compatibility with older BASICs and for
	   consistency with AmigaBASIC.
	4. Trailing characters (&%!#) can now follow literals as well as
	   variable names (eg: 12!). Prior to this version, only '&' was
	   allowed to trail a literal.
	5. Version strings have been included in all executables and          
	   libraries.
	   
These are the main changes, but there are others (see docs/history and
readme.first in the ACE archive). Some functions have also been rewritten
to improve efficiency.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	ACE has been tested on machines ranging from an A1000 running Wb 1.3
	with 512K of RAM to a 68030 machine running Wb 3.0 with 5M of RAM. 	

	For moderately large programs to compile however, 1 Meg is required.

	I run ACE on an A500 with 3 Megabytes of RAM under Wb 2.04.
