DESCRIPTION

	  A satellite tracking program.  Allows for selection of a database
          that can contain up to 300 satellites.  Tracks satellites on a 
          graphics display of the world.  All graphics are IFF compatible 
          allowing for loading of display to standard painting program.  
          Allows for input of satellite information using either standard 
          data format or by simple user input.  All operations use standard 
          windows and menus.  SatTrack has a simulation mode that allows for 
          predictions in the future.  Operates on Workbench 1.3 and 2.0.  
          This is version 2.1A. SatTrack is keyware, see the registration 
          file for more information.  SatTrack is fully operational until
	  the expiration time is reached.
          NEW: Besides several modifications and enforcer hit corrections,
	  SatTrack has added a FIND command as well as an OVERHEAD view
	  display which allows for easier viewing.
