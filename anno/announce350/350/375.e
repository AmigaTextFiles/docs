To the moderator: I made the correction, but only one of the two sites already
has it in the appropriate place, so delete the "incoming" one if you dislike it.

                               ANNOUNCEMENT:

                    release of the Amiga E compiler v2.1b,
                               update to v2.1

v2.1b is _not_ a new version of E, it features only:
- bug fixes (all known)
- additions to the distribution, like more example sources.

I won't repeat all E's features in full here, but for those of you
who've never heard of E before, I quote the ".readme":

Amiga_E		An Amiga specific E compiler.  E is a powerful and flexible
		procedural programming language and Amiga E a very fast com-
		piler for it, with features such as compilation speed of
		20000 lines/minute on a 7 Mhz amiga, inline assembler and
		linker integrated into compiler, large set of integrated
		functions, module concept with 2.04 includes as modules,
		flexible type-system, quoted expressions, immediate and typed
		lists, low level polymorphism, exception handling and much,
		much more.  Written in Assembly and E.  Version 2.1b, update
		to v2.1, public domain.  Includes partial sources.
		Author:  Wouter van Oortmerssen
