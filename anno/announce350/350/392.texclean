TITLE

	TeXClean

VERSION

	1.11

AUTHOR

	Daniel J. Barrett, barrett@cs.umass.edu

DESCRIPTION

	This is a little utility (CLI/Shell only) which makes it easy to
delete files generated by TeX or LaTeX, such as "dvi" and "aux" files.

	This is one of those really little but incredibly useful programs
that (I suspect) anybody working with TeX or LaTeX would enjoy.

	Source code in C is included.  It's very short and quite portable.
I've been using this program for over a year, so I believe it is quite
stable.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	This should run on all Amigas under AmigaDOS 1.3 and higher.

HOST NAME

	I have uploaded it to Aminet.  ftp to amiga.physik.unizh.ch
(130.60.80.80) to see a list of all Aminet sites.

DIRECTORY

	pub/aminet/text/tex

FILE NAMES

	TeXClean.lha

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	Public Domain.

                                                        Dan
