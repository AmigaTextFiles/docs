DESCRIPTION
 
    VerseWise is a Bible display/search/output program for the Amiga.
    It opens a resizeable window on the Workbench screen and allows
    one to quickly jump to any scripture, search for verses containing
    one to ten specific words, and/or output text to an ASCII file.
 
NEW FEATURES
 
    Several bugs associated with running VW on the A3000 and a larger
    screen have been fixed.
 
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
 
    There are two sets of data files, distributed separately, one of
    which is necessary to run VerseWise.  The New Testament data files
    may be run off of one floppy and 512k RAM, but the full Bible
    requires a hard drive and 1 meg RAM.
