The X-Specs archive at  csmil.umich.edu has been moved from
Zug.csmil.umich.edu ( 141.211.184.2) to csmil.umich.edu (141.211.184.10)
It contains several files related to the X-Specs stereoscope viewer
glasses for the Amiga. 
X-Specs allow for the pereception of full motion 3D scenes through
(and in front of!!) the Amigas monitor. They are AMAZINGLY COOL! This
is one of the most underrated gadgets on any computer.

The current contents of the archive are:

XDCTV/		 cdtv stuff....
applications/	object editors etc
disfunctional/	stuff I could not get to work
documents/	various information
games/		diversions
incoming/	put new stuff here
pictures/	some steroscopic images
programming/	porgramming libraries etc
utilities/	some useful binaries

I hope to add X-Specs demos, images, utility programs, hints, lists of
X-Specs supporting software,Arexx Scripts, and more.

PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR X-Specs STUFF!!!
Of cource, I would love for this archive to grow, and 

Submit stuff simpbly by ftping files into /pub/amiga/x-specs/incoming.
FTP STUFF FROM THIS DIRECTORY AT YOUR OWN RISK! BE AWARE OF VIRUSES!
After I check it out, i will move it to  /pub/amiga/x-specs/....
something else.
If you have problems, mail to chymes@csmil.umich.edu

I have no relationship to Hiatex or any other company for that matter.
