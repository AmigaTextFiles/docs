I am Kevin Davidson. I am a beta tester for Soft-Logik and I run the
company-sponsored Vendor support area on the Portal Communications
Service. The Portal Vendor area is documented in the lastest Soft-Logik
manuals (such as the one for typeSMITH). The material submitted herein
is an edited version of the official Soft-Logik Press Release as posted
on the Soft-Logik BBS.

OK

Whew.

Will do.

Can do.

Well, that is a huge list (too long?) Not much is happening with
HotLinks, but AREXX is new.

ANNOUNCING PAGESTREAM 3.0

The way you think about publishing has just changed again. We're proud to
announce PageStream 3.0. This is not just an upgrade, but a completely new
program.

PageStream 3: it will change the way you think about publishing.

First, we've redesigned the interface:

Before you could view more than one document at one time. Now you may
have unlimited views of the same document open at once--no more having
to page forward and backward between two areas being worked on at the same
time.

Add to this Edit Toolbox, unlimited Un-do levels and context-sensitive
hypertext help.

Next, the documents themselves are more sophisticated with Multiple
master pages and support for the range from simple documents to ones
divided in pages, sections and chapters--each with their own master
pages. PageStream continues to support page sizes up to 2330" x 2330".

A major enhancement is page spreads - objects that can span two pages. There's
also the ability to visually rearrange pages and to view lists of
graphic and text elements in a document.

Word Processing has not been left out.

We are adding support for decimal, left, right and centered tabs with
user defined leaders (e.g., Publishing ............. 5). Tabs can
not be set numerically and the number of tabs is unlimited.

The spell checker's been improved.

There will be new text import modules for WordPerfect 5.1 and MicroSoft
WORD. Import modules include automatic conversion of quites, commas and
dashes.

PageStream continues to support advanced typographic controls including
fongs up to 50,000 points in size. New features include converting
shapes to text columns, automatic Drop Caps, Small Caps and Bulleted
paragraphs.

PageStream now supports the AGA graphic modes including the display of
24-bit color images on the PageStream screen. 

New for version 3 is Automatic and user-definable trapping, chokes and
spreads. You can set trapping for each plate.


New drawing facilities add to the current shape, freehand and bezier
curve tools. You can now combine step and rotate object duplication, 
distribute objects within a space, nudge objects, and extend objects
across page spreads. Gradient Fills are now supported.

Printing features include tiling, thumbnails and crop/registration
plus new plate controls.

Save the best for last?

AREXX, AREXX, AREXX. PageStream can even record your keyboard
actions into ARexx macros.

Price and features subject to change before release.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Amiga computer, hard drive, 2MB of memory (512K chip), and AmigaDOS 1.3

If you are a registered owner of a Soft-Logik product, you will be

You can order now by Visa or MasterCard and you will not be billed until
shipment of your copy.
