 TITLE
 
     ztools
 
 VERSION
 
     1.0.0 - First public release.
 
 
 DESCRIPTION
 
     ZTools is an Amiga port of the IBM version of the "Infocom Toolkit",
     a neat collection of utilities and documents for manipulating
     (and investigating!) the data files that come with the text
     adventure games from Infocom, Inc. 
 
     Disassembling the file into the ZIL pseudo-assembly language format, 
     showing the vocabulary that the game knows, learning about hidden
     variables and debug modes, showing the different properties that the
     games objects have, verifying that the game data file is uncorrupt, 
     are just some of the things that can be done with these tools.
