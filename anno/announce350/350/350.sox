[Apologies for not making this available earlier.  I promised to do it
when the official release was posted to alt.sources, but I've been
virtually dead since my feed has been uppity.  I'm still not getting a
solid feed; I only know that the release is out because of telnet 119
playgrounds. -- dgc]

TITLE
	SOX - The Sound Exchange

VERSION
	Public release 6 (patchlevel 8); Amiga release 3.0

DESCRIPTION
	SOX is a tool for converting between sampled audio formats.
	It has been available for several years for Unix; MS-DOS and
	Amiga ports first appeared early in 1992.  The present
	release compiles fairly cleanly under Unix (SV or BSD), VMS,
	MS-DOS/Borland, and AmigaDOS/SAS.

	SOX understands most sampled audio formats in common use,
	including 8SVX, AIFF, VOC, WAV, Sun .au, NeXT .snd,
	Macintosh HCOM resources, IRCAM SoundFile, Turtle Beach
	.SMP, .SOU, Sndtool, Sounder, and all raw (unheadered)
	formats (8-,16-, or 32-bit, signed, unsigned, mu-law, or
	A-law).  SOX is able to convert from any recognized format
	to any other.

	In addition, SOX is capable of performing certain types of
	effects on sounds between the reading and writing phases;
	these include low- and band-pass filters, resample (rate
	change), echo, vibro, and channel conversion.

REQUIREMENTS
	A sampled sound file.

OPTIONAL
	68030 CPUs and 68881/2 Floating-Point processors are
	supported (Amiga version only) through the use of four
	separate program files.

CHANGES
	Since patchlevel 6 (Amiga 2.0):
	- Several bugs fixed;
	- 68030 versions available for AmigaDOS;
	- "auto" type handler to automatically identify input files;
	- "reverse" effect added.  (NOTE: I'm not sure whether this
	  effect ever made it into documentation, but it's there.
	  E.g., "sox foobar.voc raboof.iff reverse".)
	- Direct compilability of release sources under SAS/C 6.2.
	  For this reason, Amiga-specific source is no longer
	  distributed.  See enclosed documentation for source code
	  availability.
