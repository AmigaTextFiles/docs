It has come to my attention that someone has started circulating a copy of
SnoopDos 2.0. Since the most recent version of SnoopDos that I've released
is version 1.7, this new version is an imposter.

As of yet, I haven't had the chance to determine what this fake version
does, but since the executable doesn't match the source code included with
the distribution, there is a good chance that it does something nasty; it
may be a repeat of the incident last year, where a bogus SnoopDos 1.6 was
circulated that added a back door to the AmiExpress BBS package.

If you see any files claiming to be SnoopDos 2.0 on an FTP site or BBS,
please inform the Sysop that it is not an official release, and ask him
or her to delete it. Please also pass on this message to other networks,
to try and prevent this file from spreading too far.

Thanks to Floyd Vest and Mathias Korsback for alerting me to the fake
version. I can always be contacted by mail at ecarroll@maths.tcd.ie if
you want to check whether your current version of SnoopDos is a valid
release or not.
