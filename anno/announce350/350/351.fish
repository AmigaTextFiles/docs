I have been informed by Gregory Epley that Paramount has advised him to halt
all distribution of his game, NGTC (Next Generation Trivia Challenge).  This
affects disks 404, 405, 506, 507, and 538.  Replacement disks are now avail-
able that have the NGTC material removed.  People who have received these
disks from me can return their master disks for replacement at no charge.
