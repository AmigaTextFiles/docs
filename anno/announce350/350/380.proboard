DESCRIPTION

     The demonstration version of Pro-Board is fully functional except
     that it cannot save PCB data files.  Pro-Lib is fully functional.
     The plotting and printing utility, Pro-Plot, is not included.  This
     description is a brief review of the capabilities of the commercial
     version of Pro-Board.  Functions described in this file which require
     saving, plotting, or printing the PCB cannot be demonstrated with the
     demo version of Pro-Board.

     Pro-Board V3 provides the ability to design and route Printed Circuit
     Boards, using either manual, guided, or fully automatic placement and
     routing.

     Direct support for 16 layer PCBs, plus automatic Power and Ground
     layer generation.

     English and Metric coordinates supported.

     Easily add DIPs, SIPs, 2-Pin devices (such as standard, though-hole
     resistors and capacitors), and Library Parts (custom designed for
     unique physical footprints, such as PGA and PLCC ICs, transistors,
     and SMT components).

     Automatic placement of all Devices is allowed.  This operation can be
     applied to every component en masse or to groups of components
     separated according to your needs.

     Standard PCB resolution is 0.025" (25 mils) with 12 mil traces and 13
     mil separations.  Fine Line mode operates on a 20 mil grid with 8 mil
     trace widths and separations, allowing two traces to be routed
     between two standard Pads with a 0.1" separation.  Wide traces range
     from 12 to 400 mils.

     Powerful Maze Search algorithm is used to find the shortest path to
     connect two points.  If suitable, a trace will be drawn to another
     pin if already connected, or a trace segment will be drawn to an
     existing trace if that provides the best results.  Automatic routing
     on two layers uses the Channel Search algorithm to route horizontal
     traces on one layer and vertical traces on the other.

     Works with Pro-Net Net Lists to aid routing by highlighting the Pins
     to be connected in each Net.  You will not have to refer to the
     Solder layers only, both layers, or as standard through-hole
     components.

     Place pins under mouse or keyboard control with selectable
     orientation.  Standard resolutions are 25 and 20 mils.  High
     resolution definitions supported down to 1 mil (0.001").  Drawing
     tools allow lines, polygons, boxes, circles and text on the Label,
     Component, Solder, and Pad layers.  Draw Device outlines and
     installation aids, or electrical pathways.  Context sensitive on-line
     Help function.  Context sensitive hierarchical command structure
     consistent with Pro-Net and Pro-Board.

     Devices which can easily be defined with Pro-Lib include Pin Grid
     Array (PGA) and Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC) ICs, SMT resistors
     and capacitors, power transistors, ZIP memory chips, and goldfinger
     edge connectors.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Prolific products work under AmigaDOS V1.3, V2, and V3.

     Pro-Board now requires 1 Meg for small projects and, typically, 1.5
     Megs for medium to large PCBs.

     A hard disk is recommended.  Will work with 1 or 2 floppies.

     All products use integer math, so there is no loss of speed for
     systems which do not have a math coprocessor.

     LhA or equivalent is required to extract the archive.
     IconX must be in C: for Workbench installation.
