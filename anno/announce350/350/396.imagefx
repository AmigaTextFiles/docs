TITLE:  
        ImageFXDemo.DMS
 
        A demo of the commercial packages; ImageFX and CineMorph

DESCRIPTION:
 
        ImageFX is the new leader in image processing on the Amiga.
 
        This program handles everything from image file format
        conversions, controlling framegrabbers and scanners, 24 bit
        painting and retouching, special effects, color correction,
        compositing, rendering to any Amiga display and most all
        high color display cards, and 24 bit accurate printing.        
 
        The commercial package comes with dozens of loaders and 
        savers, hundreds of image processing effects and related
        processes, and support for nearly all high color display
        cards available for the Amiga.
 
        This demo version comes with a selected sampling of the 
        loaders, no savers, and can preview on any Amiga display 
        including the new AGA displays.  Image rendering is slightly
        "crippled" by putting the word "Demo" in a bar across ever
        rendered image.
