  Dan, here is my announcement for the Triceratops board, mailed from my
bix account as specified by jeh@raster.kodak.com  -Scott

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ** "Triceratops" multiport I/O Zorro cards for Amiga 2000, 3000 & 4000 **

Serial hardware:

* Two serial ports, each with separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFO
(first in, first out) buffers.  This hardware and device driver combination
is smart enough to _not_ interrupt the CPU for every byte sent or received.
This has two benefits:  first, since the CPU has more than a single character
time to respond it is much less likely to drop characters.  Second, since
less frequent interrupts are required, more of the CPU is available for other
programs to run.  Each FIFO has an adjustable trigger depth, where it will
interrupt the CPU after so many bytes are sent or received.  Each port also
has selectable start bit length, stop bit length, word length and parity.
Handshaking is selectable with both XON/XOFF and hardware (RTS/CTS) protocols
available.

* Baud rates individually programmable from DC to 691,200, including MIDI rate.

* Full nine-wire serial and handshake using DB-9 "AT" style connectors.

* Optional MIDI interface mounts internally, connects to second serial port.
(Or connect your own to the DB-9)

Parallel hardware:

* One bidirectional parallel port compatible with the Amiga internal port.

Support software:

* cereal.device -- supports up to 32 units of Triceratops serial channels.

* extprint.device -- output-only parallel port driver for up to 8 units.

* SerPrefs -- c: utility to set serial port characteristics.

* IOWedge -- c: utility to enable use of the Triceratops board with software
that does not support external I/O ports.  (Requires DOS 2.x/3.x)

* NewPortHandler -- l: port-handler that allows use of cereal.device and
extprint.device in mountlist entries.


  The Triceratops board's FIFO-based serial ports permit high-performance
transfers without the overhead associated with the internal port.  In addition,
printer output through the Triceratops parallel port frees the internal port
for use in parnet or digitizing.  The card itself is a double-sided, plated and
masked full-length board with one DB-9 male connector (first serial port) and
a DB-25 female connector (parallel port).  A ten pin connector on the card
is for the supplied 2nd DB-9 male connector which is attached to its own
backplane runner.

  Currently, no parallel-input device exists as all digitizing programs
currently bypass the parallel.device and go directly to the resource.  For
those interested in developing digitizing input drivers or a triceratops
ParNet-handler, full hardware-level programming details of the serial and
parallel ports is included in the documentation.

  Available in quantity beginning March 1st, 1993.  Price: $125.00 ppd

  This device has been tested in several machines over many months and is
a nice addition for those requiring more than the internal ports can provide.
