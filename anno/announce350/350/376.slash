DESCRIPTION

     Hack & Slash is a popular fantasy role-playing game that
     should run as a door under most Amiga BBS packages.
     Some of the activities one can take part in are:
       - fighting monsters and other players
       - gambling in the casino
       - jousting for gold and glory
       - rob another user, or the bank!
       - buy a ship and hunt sea monsters, go fishing, or
         do battle at sea with other players
       - join/create a gang to fight other gangs
       - kick back in the tavern and enjoy a beer while
         eavesdropping on conversations
       - explore the dungeon and try to escape alive with all the loot

       - Dialog (DLG) (stdio)
       - Xenolink (uses the Xenolink door protocol)
       - StarNet (using DosDriver)

       - TAG (uses TAG door protocol)
       - Falcon (stdio)
