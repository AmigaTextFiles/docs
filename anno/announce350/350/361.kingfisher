Subject: UPLOADED: KingFisher 1.2
Status: RO


  Available now via anonymous ftp is KingFisher 1.2,  with greatly enhanced
  search capabilities, highlighting of search keywords in descriptions, and
  some additional conformance to KS 2.0 guidelines.

  General overview of KingFisher:

  KingFisher is a freely distributable replacement  for Aquarium, providing
  a mechanism  to  search for software  in  Fred Fish's Library  of  Freely
  Distributable Software.  KingFisher  has been designed  for users of both
  floppy-only and harddisks systems operating under either Kickstart 1.3 or
  Kickstart 2.0.  Some features are available only under Kickstart 2.0.

  KingFisher v1.2 offers the following features:

  - Maintains a split database across multiple disk volumes,
  - Searches this database more than 3 times faster than Aquarium,
  + Multi-string searches with AND, OR, and NOT operators (boolean search
    expressions) including case selection and V37+ regular expressions,
  + Keywords from a search are highlighted in the description of the
    matching entries,
  + Workbench SETTINGS tooltype supported,
  - Provides a small and very fast program name search index,
  - Adds new fish directly from Contents files or Usenet postings, even
    from multiple concatenated postings or email contents files,
  - Fish can be deleted from the end of the database to undo errors,
  - Database is a line-oriented text file accessed through index which can
    be modified by hand and then reindexed,
  - Flexible print and export functions, including search-filtered output,
  - Select from multiple different search strings,
  - Limit searches to a portion of the database,
  - Follow version links to older or newer versions of software,
  - Maintain multiple different "bookmarks" into the database and switch
    between them with a single mouse click,
  - Supports proportional and scalable fonts for description text,
  - Now supports the 2.0 display database including Text Overscan.  Limited
    support for overscan, PAL, and interlace displays is available under
    Kickstart 1.3.
  - String gadgets are optionally kept active for keyboard comfort,
  - Full configuration saved between executions,
  - Iconifies to save Chip RAM (46K).

obtain version  1.0  (KingFisher.lha) which is  477691   bytes in size,  or
