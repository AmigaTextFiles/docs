                       The Proper Tools for the Job!
                  From Moonlighter Software Develpment, Inc.

Moonlighter is pleased to bring you Ami-Back Tools, a collection of
the best disk utilities available to keep your Amiga's floppy and hard
drives performing flawlessly.  Have you ever accidentally erased an
important file?  Have you noticed your drives slowing down after heavy
usage?  Have you noticed how hard drive problems occur at the most
inconvenient times?  Over 90% of all sick hard drives can be cured
with the right tools:  Ami-Back Tools!

 Ami-Back Tools can diagnose and treat small problems before they
become big disasters:  the GP, a sophisticated disk optimizer ensures
your data is stored as efficiently as possible, and the Disk Analyst
examines your disks for potential problems and repairs them when the
need arises.  911-Recovery recovers data from crashed disks, and the
Reviver recovers deleted files in place, while the Antiseptic clears
your disk of everything.  The Lab Test lets you check and compare
checksums for file corruption and virus protection.  All these
programs are tied together by the Administrator which allows you to
set up, schedule, and perform any or all of these tests with unmatched
ease and flexibility.

Ami-Back Tools represents over a year of development from concept to
completion.  The suggestions of hundreds of Amiga users were
considered and evaluated as the features of Ami-Back Tools went from
idea stage to software code.  High quality was always a priority
during the design of Ami-Back Tools.  Amiga users have been waiting
for a professional and reliable disk utilities package since the
Amiga's introduction, and Ami-Back Tools is our answer to these users'
wishes.  We are certain you will find this package unmatched by any
other utilities package on the market today.

Overview:

The "GP" (General Practioner) organizes the information on your
harddrive for maximum performance.  It offers several choices of file,
directory, or free space organization.  GP is fast and safe.
Optimizing your hard drive no longer needs to be a potentially
dangerous task, nor a slow tedious process..  GP is robust and allows
the user to abort it's operation at any time without loss of data.

The "Disk Analyst" finds and fixes problems with disk structure that
prevents normal disk operation - "Key Not Set", "Block 51224 Has a
Checksum Error" and other filing system level problems can be
corrected.  The Disk Analyst is aware of all filing systems from WB1.3
OFS to WB3.0 Directory-Cached and will allows you to undo changes made
to the file system.

The "Reviver" let you recovers deleted files in place, giving you
control of which files are to be un-deleted.  The Reviver will also
restore a "quick" formatted device to it's previous contents.

The "Lab Test" performs CRC (Cycle Redundancy Check) of all files and
allows storage of CRC database for later comparison.  It also allows
comparisons with other databases to check for corrupted file-data due
to viruses, etc.  The Lab test also displays or prints (to the PRT:
device or file) the disk tree structure.

"911-Recovery" mode allows you to recovers files from crashed
filesystem to floppy or other AmigaDOS devices (filesystems).
911-Recovery works like a selective backup without going through
AmigaDOS to recover lost files.

Antiseptic Function wipes all evidence of information from a disk.  It
will prevent the recovery of information from your hard drive-ideal
for security concerns.  It will either work in "Free-Space" mode, or
wipe the entire device.

The new "Ami-Sched II" works for both Ami-Back Tools and Ami-Back (not
included).  It allows to schedule Ami-Back Tools events (such as the
Analyst) to examine your file system and repair it un-attended.
Ami-Sched II supports any number of events over any time frame.
Ami-Sched II is quite small and system resource efficient, running in
the background.

"AmiBack Tools" supports all standard Amiga file systems including
AmigaDOS 3.0 directory caching file system.  It is very flexible in
it's "User" configuration in screen/window definitions - supporting
many screen modes.  The optional caching mode will cache read/write
operations for maximum speed.  Ami-Back Tools is has built security
checks so the user is never caught off-guard and executes a
destructive command inadvertantly.  There is even a log file kept to
keep track of what you do.  There is also an RDB (Rigid Disk Block)
"Read" and "Write" allowing to save them, and restore them as well if
need be.

System Requirments
- Any Amiga running WorkBench v1.3 or higher.
- 512k Memory

The List Price for AmiBack tools is $79.95 (US Funds).  There are
competitive upgrade offers available to owners of other products.
