                  ***** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE *****
 
         NEW ADPRO JOINS AMIGA'S MOST IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS
 
In an exclusive first, ADPro now reads and writes images in the NewTek
Video Toaster Framestore format with full broadcast color and
fidelity.  Taken together with a direct memory link to Deluxe Paint
4.6, ASDG's recent ADPro upgrade ties together several of the Amiga's
most important applications.
 
Madison WI, March 8, 1993 ---- ASDG Incorporated, the leading
innovator in color processing technology for the Commodore Amiga,
announce a major upgrade to their award winning product, Art
Department Professional.  The new release contains several exclusive
firsts which increase the level of integration of the Amiga's most
popular imaging tools.
 
ADPro 2.3 is the first third party product to offer complete support
of the Video Toaster Framestore file format.  The new release provides
a loader and saver which can read and write Framestores in full
broadcast color and fidelity.
 
ADPro's Framestore support does not require a Video Toaster, which
dramatically increases the processing options available to those using
Toaster images.  For example, Framestores can be directly manipulated
by all machines on a network including non-Toaster equipped machines.
Batch processing using any of ADPro's extensive manipulation and
conversion capabilities is now quick and easy.
 
Videographers now have a direct Framestore-to-D1 digital video
connection using ADPro's ABEKAS digital video driver.  This is today's
most effective means of moving video data to and from the Amiga and
has been used in such high profile productions as Quantum Leap,
Babylon 5 and The American Music Awards.
 
ADPro 2.3 also provides an exclusive direct memory link to the newest
version of Deluxe Paint from Electronic Arts, as well as OpalVision's
24 bit-plane paint program.
 
These links effectively fuse ADPro with the best painting programs
available today.  Said Perry Kivolowitz, President of ASDG, ``Our
customers didn't want yet another image processor with mediocre
painting capabilities.  They want great image processing and great
painting.  We've delivered exactly that.''
 
ADPro has direct access to DPaint's memory including its primary,
secondary, and animation buffers.  A similar capability is provided
for Centaur Development's OpalPaint.
 
Users of either paint system can directly load and save images in any
file format which ADPro supports.  The same is true for any of ADPro's
image processing capabilities.  For example, a Toaster Framestore can
be loaded into OpalPaint, touched up with both programs, and saved to
a film recorder.
 
Said Mr.  Kivolowitz, ``We call ADPro, Image Processing's Common
Ground.  That title is more true now than ever.  We've provided our
users a way of joining their best tools together, making them more
productive.''
 
ADPro 2.3 adds many other new capabilities as well.  To learn more
about the 2.3 upgrade or any of ASDG's other image processing tools,

or call her at (608) 273 6585.
