TITLE

    MPEG Player

VERSION

AUTHOR

    Amiga: Michael Balzer

DESCRIPTION

    This is the third release of the first public domain MPEG viewer
    for the Commodore Amiga.

    MPEG stands for Moving Pictures Experts Group and is also
    the name for a method of compressing video streams. The
    compression is lossy and CPU hungry, but quite efficient.
    MPEG movies are not really 24 bit, but YUV. As an example
    on the efficiency, take the iicm.mpg anim and convert it
    to a *256* color IFF anim - the 1.7 MB MPEG stream will
    result in a 6.3 MB IFF file. Now do the same conversion
    for 24 bit...

    I'm sad to say there is no PD MPEG _encoder_ available up to
    now, but maybe there will be. For further questions on MPEG
    please first read the FAQ I included into the bin archive.

    The player is capable of displaying standard MPEG animations
    either in a window on Workbench or on its own custom screen.
    It can save each frame of the anim to disk, so you can build
    an IFF format animation from an MPEG file. The MkAnim tool
    (by John Bickers) to assemble the frames is included.

    Changes against V1.22 (second release):

     * Release 1.23 (not released due to 2.01):
     *  - Dither mono & threshold now work (fast!)
     *  - New option: -saveiff framename_%d.iff (guess for what ;-)
     *    Saving currently forces screen mode. No support for 24 bit yet
     *  - Added new option: -amiga screen:mode/depth/width/height,
     *    reworked option dependancies
     *
     * Release 2.01 (Feb 12 1993):
     *  - Based upon the new 2.0 release of the mpeg player for UNIX
     *  - No need to enhance color allocation, as the new player
     *    allows to set the range values (ncolors = l_rng*cr_rng*cb_rng)
     *  - 24 Bit IFF save mode implemented

REQUIREMENTS

    AmigaOS 2.04 or later + at least 68020 and 68881.
    AmigaOS 3.0 recommended. 68040 recommended.

    Free memory of about 2 MB should be sufficient. It may even
    work with 1 MB, but I haven't tested that.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    This player needs Markus Wild's ixemul.library. As this lib still
    doesn't seem to exist on everyone's machines, I have included it
    with the distribution. For the complete GCC distribution contact
    your next FTP server.

    And... NO, THIS PLAYER DOESN'T NEED X-WINDOWS!

FTP LOCATIONS

    There are two archives, one containing the binaries (and other
    usefull stuff) and the other one containing the sources (split up
    into original UNIX part plus special Amiga changes & extensions).

    I included the necessary X11 header files (don't think, many
    Amiga programmers have them around).  The Makefile and code are
    for Markus Wild's port of the famous GNU GCC C compiler (thanks
    again, Markus!).  Don't forget to build an amiga.lib version 39.x
    for your GCC before trying to compile the code.
