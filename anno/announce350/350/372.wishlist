Introduction

       Have you ever thought of a feature which would make AmigaDOS
  a more productive or professional environment?  If so, you now have
  the opportunity to submit your suggestions to a forum dedicated to
  promoting the interests of members of the Amiga community.

What is the AmigaDOS Wish List?

       The AmigaDOS Wish List is a formal collection of features and
  enhancements which we Amiga users would like to see incorporated into
  AmigaDOS.  By sending suggestions to this list, we can try to take an
  active role in determining the evolution of the operating system.
  Entries may deal with all aspects of AmigaDOS such as appearance,
  functionality, Workbench applications, and documentation.

Guidelines for Submissions

       We encourage all members of the Amiga community to contribute
  to the AmigaDOS Wish List.  You may submit as many times as you like,
  provided that you adhere to the format described below.

      Feature: a brief description of an addition or enhancement
               to the operating system

  Inspiration: where applicable, the name of an application or
               alternative operating system in which the feature
               may currently be found

   Usefulness: a brief statement indicating why the proposed
               feature would be of benefit to Amiga users

  For example,

      Feature: real-time, device-level data compression
  Inspiration: XPK (Amiga), Stacker (MS-DOS)
   Usefulness: provide a standardized means to increase hard disk
               storage capacity

  Please make your entries as concise and clear as possible.
  All submissions are subject to editing and will remain completely
  confidential.

Distribution

       Depending on the volume of submissions, updates to the
  AmigaDOS Wish List will be uploaded to one of the Aminet FTP
  sites, where they will become freely distributable. In addition,
  the list will be periodically forwarded to an appropriate contact
  at Commodore.

Acknowledgements

       Thanks to all those who have expressed an interest in
  pursuing this list and helping to make an excellent operating
  system even better.
