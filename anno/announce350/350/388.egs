for the native Amiga graphics chip sets (standard, ECS, AA). It                 
is a full 24 bit/16 Million colours graphics standard for                       
creating user interfaces. It provides a uniform "look and feel"                 
on many graphic boards on the market.                                           
This release is a complete, full functional development package                 
except that it only runs on the Amiga native chip sets.                         
Included are the EGS libraries, preferences, demos, docs and                    
includes for C and assembler. It is herewith possible to                        
write programs for EGS.
