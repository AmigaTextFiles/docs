Dan,

I think I left it that I would send you another version of this
announcement. Here it is. Let me know if I need a version 4.
(if version 2 is already posted, just discard this one).

DESCRIPTION

   The Aglet Modula-2 V2.04 Interface consists of over one hundred modules
   providing the Benchmark (TM) Modula-2 programmer with a calling
   interface to all of the Amiga system resident library functions
   distributed with AmigaDOS v2.04, as well as definitions of all
   system record structures and flags.

        Note: This product has no connection with Avant-Garde software or
              Leon Frenkel, the author of the Benchmark product.

   These M2 interface DEFINITION MODULEs follow closely the C language
   "includes" interface of ".h" file distributed by CATS.

   The supplied modules replace the Amiga-specific modules delivered
   (for AmigaDOS v1.2) with the original Benchmark compiler. Compatibility
   is maintained with the rest of the Benchmark system, with the exception
   of the "Simplified Amiga Library" add-on.

   Source for all the DEFINITION and IMPLEMENTATION modules of the interface
   is also included.

   Also included is a program, DoIFace, which can be used to create a
   similar interface for Benchmark programs to additional Amiga resident
   libraries.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   v2.04 AmigaDOS
   Benchmark Modula-2 Compiler

PRICE

   The package is available from me for US$ 35.00. Shipping is included
   to destinations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. For other
   destinations, please add an additional US$ 3.00.

   Residents of Virginia must add an additional 4.5% state sales tax
   ($1.58).

   Please make your check or money order out to Thomas M. Breeden.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

   Each distribution is copyrighted and licensed for a single computer.
   Commodore copyrighted commentary material is distributed under an
   "Includes Distribution License" from CATS.

README

   A number of Test/Example programs are included, showing the usage of
   many of the new features of AmigaDOS 2.04, such as public screens,
   file notification, gadtools, asl, etc. (Otherwise, no specific
   documentation on using AmigaDOS v2.04 is included.)

   Two additional examples of interfacing to Amiga Resident Libraries
   are included: 1) the AmigaGuide library from Commodore 2) the ISAM
   library from RedShift Software.
