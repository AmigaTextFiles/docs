Disks 831-840 are now available.  Shipping to all those who have preordered
disks should be complete by 16-Mar-93.

Note that you can get a copy of the catalog (2 disks) of the complete library
contents by sending $3 for disks, postage, and mailer to:

	Fred Fish
	Catalog Disk Requests
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, Arizona  85284
	USA

Thanks to all who submitted new and interesting material.  If you submitted
something in the past and it has not yet appeared in the library, please
feel free to resubmit it, particularly if it was several months ago.  I
sometimes hesitate to include material submitted more than about six
months ago because of some vague feeling that as soon as I include version
1.01 submitted many months ago, I'll see version 5.23 posted on usenet.

For those wishing to submit material for possible inclusion in the library,
here are a few simple guidelines that will make my job of organizing the
material MUCH easier and GREATLY increase your chances of having the material
accepted for inclusion:

1.	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other sort of
	proprietary material included, since I then have to go examine
	each file to decide if it is distributable or not, and if not,
	what effect removing it might have.  Unless the material is
	particularly interesting, I frequently just toss such disks
	into the recycling bin.

2.	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to my disks.  I.E,
	place all files related to a particular submission under a single
	directory on the disk.  If there is more than one submission per
	disk, place each submission in its own directory.

3.	Try to write a simple entry for my "Contents" listing that
	summarizes your submission.  It should be about 3-10 lines, and
	include the current version number, the version and disk number
	of the most recent version (if any) that was last included in the
	library, whether or not source is included, and an "Author" list.

4.	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from its sub-
	directory and if necessary, supply a script runnable from workbench
	(via :c/xicon or c:iconx) that makes all necessary assigns, copies
	fonts and libraries, etc.

5.	Send your submission in a sturdy envelope with sufficient padding.

Thanks!!!

MandelSquare	Yet another program to generate images from the Mandelbrot
		set, different from most implementations in that it runs
		only under AmigaOS 2.x, requires an '020/'030/'040 CPU and a
		numerical coprocessor.	The calculation routines were
		written in '881 assembly language for maximum speed and
		precision.  Also included is a `movie mode' which allows
		generation of long camera zooms to spots in the Mandelbrot
		set.  The resulting animations can be saved in ANIM-opt-5
		format, allowing to replay them using `MandelSquare' or
		standard animation software.  Enhancements include support
		for the AGA chipset (now you can finally create images in
		256 colours!) and several bug fixes and improvements in the
		image and animation creation code.  This is version 1.6, an
		update to version 1.3 on disk 589.  Includes source in C and

		bench screen and it's multitasking friendly.  This game was
		made and tested under Workbench 2.0, so the colors may look a
		bit strange under WB1.3.  Version 2.0, binary only.
		Author:  Teemu Sipila and Marko Malmberg
