TITLE
         UUx 

VERSION
         1.0

AUTHOR
         Asher Feldman, asher@shell.portal.com  or  Wizard0@cup.portal.com

DESCRIPTION
         UUx is the ultimate uuencode/decode utility for the 
         Amiga.  Uuencoding is the process of converting a binary
         file into ASCII, so that it may be transmitted over a
         text, or "mail only" network such as the Usenet.  Many
         files are posted to the Usenet daily, but the must be
         uudecoded before you can use them.  UUx makes the task of 
         uuencoding and decoding simple, with its amiga style 
         command interface.  You can even LhA and uuencode multiple 
         files in a single step!  (And vice-versa)  (LhA is a popular 
         compression program/format that allows you to compress 
         and archive multiple files)  Also, UUx will decode 
         uuencoded files with multiple mail headers and other 
         garbage in them!  So you can download multiple part 
         archives off the Usenet, and decode them without 
         editing out all the headers!  

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
         LhA by Stefan Boberg is required to use the LhA specific
         functions.  UUx works under OS 1.3, 2.04, 2.1, and 3.0.  
         A special 68030 optimized version is included
         which is faster than the standard 68000 version.
