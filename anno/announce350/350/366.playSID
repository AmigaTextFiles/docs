DESCRIPTION

     This is a utility which emulates the SID and 6510 chip. The
     SID chip is the component in the C64 computer that handles sound.
     The 6510 chip is the CPU of the C64, that means the component
     that actually executes all programs. Because the Amiga does
     not have these chips and others, you can't run C64 programs
     directly on Amiga.

     Now this utility lets you play all those C64 programs that
     produce sound. As you probably know, the C64 has three sound
     channels (the amiga has four). But this utility also allows
     use of the fourth channel. This channel is the product of
     some special programming on the C64, it isn't really a channel.

     The purpose of this product is to make the best conversion
     of C64 sound on Amiga ever possible. If you think some sound
     isn't correctly converted please let us know.

     This utility is designed to work with true multitasking, under
     any system version and any amiga model. It can be run from both
     Workbench and CLI/Shell. It should work with any other program
     that don't use sound or timing. If this isn't the fact please
     let us know.

     Some time ago we released a similar product called "The 100 most
     remembered C64 game-tunes". This product is the version 2.1
     of that program. The tunes on that demonstration disk are now
     also available to this version. And up to date there are more
     than 400 tunes available. We and others are also working with more.
