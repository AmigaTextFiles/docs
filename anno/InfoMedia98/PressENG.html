   Dear Amigans,
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
   We are proud to present <B><A HREF="http://titan.glo.be/~waasland/infomedia98">InfoMedia '98</A></B>, one of the largest computer
shows of the Benelux! The 2nd edition will have place on <FONT COLOR=green><B>October 3rd (Saturday) and 4th (Sunday) 1998</B><FONT COLOR=black>
in <B>"het Bouwcentrum" in <FONT COLOR=green>Antwerp, Belgium</B><FONT COLOR=black> from 10.00h
to 18.00h. It's a general computer fair, but this year the fair will be
expanded with one or more extra halls, just for alternative systems. It's the
intention to fill at least one big hall with Amiga! The total surface of the
whole fair amounts to 6,000 square metres! The access price comes to 250 Bfr.
(14 Fl./5 £./13 DM) or 200 Bfr. (11 Fl./4 £./10 DM) for big groups.
<BR>   
<BR>
   You may expect companies, shops, organisations, user groups and many
important notables from the Amiga world; some of them will give one or more
<B><I>seminaries</I></B>. During those two days <B><I>live IRC conferences</I></B> will be held and we're
also planning to set up some <B><I>web cams</I></B>. People who would like to experiment
with the Internet can visit our <B><I>cyberzone</I></B> and the ideal place for a break is
of course our big <B><I>bar</I></B>! <B><I>ANNEX</I></B> will perform their latest dance acts and <B><I>AMIGA
International, Inc.</I></B> will have a big booth to offer you all the latest news!
The <B><I>UGN</I></B> stand will be available too for all kind of user group information.
