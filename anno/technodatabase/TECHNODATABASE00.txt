Hi there !

TECHNODATABASE OO is now available !
It's now a 100% Amiga interactive CDrom as it runs with SCALAMM400 or player.
(PAL needed).
A 400 megs bonus (hundreds of demos, gfx and sound utilities, mods, mp3, pictures,
anims, texts, web sites and so on...) is also offered.
A pure delight for technomaniacs and one of the only french interactive
amiga CDroms.
Price : $20 for Europe shipping included ($25  for other countries).
