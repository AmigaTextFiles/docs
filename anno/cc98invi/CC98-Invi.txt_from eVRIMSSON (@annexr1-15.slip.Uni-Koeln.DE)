Once  upon  a  time,  maybe three or four years ago, every scener knew that
there's  a party after visiting the WOC, nowadays known as the Computer '98
fair.

For  the  guests,  this  meeting  was  an occasion to drink some beer, meet
scenish  friends  and a place to feel comfortable.  After some bad tries to
organize  a  party,  and  lastly  nothing  happened  last year, we, Ghandy,
Merlin-M!,  Dire,  Exon and eVRIMSSON thought, that it`s time to change the
history.

We  are sorry that our meeting won't be open until the next day, but please
mail us if you're looking for a place to sleep...  We'll try our best!

So,  this  year  you'll  hopefully  have a reason again to come to Cologne!
Meet us, party with us, and be happy at the Cologne Conference 98!

How to get from the fair to the party by subway/metro (Straßenbahn)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- At the fair,  you have the possibility to catch many different trains  at
  different  metro  stations.  The easiest  way  is  to catch the line 1 to
  "Junkersdorf" and to get out at "Rudolfplatz".

- If you don't find the line number 1, you either can take number 14, 9, 3,
  and  2,  which  even  run  from  the  fair.  Take  one of those trains to
  "Neumarkt"  and  get  out  at  the  "Neumarkt"-Station.  From Neumarkt go
  upstairs  where  the  lines  1  and  2  run.  Take one of those trains to
  "Junkersdorf" and get out at "Rudolfplatz".

From  Rudolfplatz  to  the party place, it will take you about 4 minutes of
walk.  It's behind the big "Crown Plaza Hotel".  Once you reach Rudolfplatz
with  line 1 or 2, you have to walk straight ahead, the same way the line 1
and  2  use to go.  Cross the big intersection and then turn left the first
street.  Go straight up about 30 meters and you will see the party place on
the  corner  of  the  next intersection.  Look out for the blue gate.  Also
look for some party signs around the place.


how to get to the party from the fair by car
--------------------------------------------

Cross  the  bridge  called  "Deutzer  Brücke".   That's the way to Centrum.
After  crossing  the  bridge,  just stay on your way and go straight ahead.
After  a  while you'll see a big gate and Mc Donalds on your right.  Do the
drive  across  the  big  intersection  and  turn  left at the first street.
That's the place of the Crown Plaza Hotel.

You  can  use  the  big  parking  lot  of  the  hotel.   Press  the  button
"KURZPARKER"  and take your parking ticket.  The parking fee is 2,00 DM per
hour  before  7 pm (19:00 cet) and from 7 pm to 7 am (07:00 cet), it's only
1,50 DM per hour.  The parking lot is opened 24 hours.

We recommend you to park your car at that hotel parking.  It's the cheapest
around and anyway, it's quite difficult to find a free parking place around
the Centrum, especially on saturdays.

Outside  the  parking lot, ask for Händelstr.  It's 50 meters away from the
Hotel.  And almost everybody should know the Händelstr.  It's even possible
to see the party place from the main entrance of the Plaza Hotel.

The  entrance  fee  is  very  low  comparing to previous parties took place
during  the  WOC.   We are not that kind of people who gonna let others pay
for  our amusement.  We figured out the entrance fee and maked it as low as
possible  for  you,  that we just will be able to pay the rent of the party
place.

Entrance fee is 10,00 DM only.

- Admission free for girls! -
