NewInstaller
------------

NewInstaller is the ultimate multimedia addon for the old
Commodore Installer. With NewInstaller it`s now possible
to add graphics, sounds and other multimedia elements to
an installation. Even Online Registrations can be maintained
by NewInstaller. Other features are for example the possibility
to visit homepages, creating UnInstall scripts and much
more. Additionally it`s possible to make NewInstaller create
scripts for the Commodore Installer automatically.
NewInstaller only needs to know the path of the program
to be installed and it will generate the script according
to the program automatically. NewInstaller is a must-have
for all Amiga owners!
