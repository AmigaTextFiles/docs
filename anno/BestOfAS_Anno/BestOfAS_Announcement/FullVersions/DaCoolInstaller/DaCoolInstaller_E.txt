Da Cool Installer
-----------------

The well known Da Cool Installer is also available in a new,
many times reworked version on the CD-ROM. Da Cool Installer
allows the user to install all sort of games to his harddisk.
The advantage of Da Cool Installer is, that it uses a general
method of installing the games. So it`s possible to install
nearly every game without problems. Da Cool Installer supports
a trackdisk.device emulation, games with more than one disk,
Degrade2ECS support, installation of crunched DMS disks and
many more.
