CD32 Games Install Kit v3.1 NG
------------------------------

The CD32 Games Install Kit v3.1 Next Generation is the result
of a nearly complete rewrite of the famous CD32 Games Install
Kit, which installs CD32 games to harddisk and patches them
to run from there. Actually over 170 CD32 games are directly
supported. Many of them do even run on Amigas without the
AGA chipset. This version has alot of new features like for
example an integrated CD32 emulator, a complete new and much
more stable bootsystem (Install2001NG) and additionally there`s
now the possibility to install even non predefined CD32 games.
So it`s possible to install nearly every CD32 game to harddisk (!!).
