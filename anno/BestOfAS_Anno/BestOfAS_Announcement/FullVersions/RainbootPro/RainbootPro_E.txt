Rainboot Pro
------------

The ultimate multimedia boot, Rainboot, is also on the CD-ROM
in a much improved and extended Pro-version. Rainboot allows
the user to show complete boot shows during the bootup. Rainboot
supports nearly everything you can think of: Animations, sounds,
copper rainbows, password protection, brushes, different fonts,
modules, fades, CyberGraphX and Picasso96 support, progressbars,
retrieving and displaying information about the used Amiga
system, graphical effects, scrolling of pictures and much much
more. In the Pro-version it`s now possible to use more than
one animation, add user-controls to the configurations and much
more. So it`s now also possible to create real multimedia
applications with Rainboot. Rainboot is a unique program, which
has neither been beaten in features and effectivity on Amiga nor
on PC.
