	No problem.  I noticed that you've been rather busy recently.
Looks like everybody sent you announcements at the same time.


	This is a resubmission of this announcement.  It has been
altered based on Dan Zerkle's recommendations.

	My name is Bruce Dawson, and I am the founder, president and
chief and only programmer of Cygnus Software.  Sorry about not
attaching this information before - I incorrectly assumed that my name
was appearing on outgoing mail.

	Removing lines from a press release is like pulling teeth, but
I tried to shrink it down a bit.  Hope this one is acceptable.  I have
read through the guidelines - you e-mailed them to me a month or two
ago.

	Thanks

.Bruce Dawson.

DESCRIPTION:

     Mand2000D is the demo version of Mand2000, a fractal exploration
program.  Fractals are strangely beautiful mathematical objects which
have started appearing everywhere from book covers to rock videos.
The Mandelbrot set is probably the most popular of these fractals.
Its unique beauty and infinite complexity, derived from a simple
mathematical formula, have drawn thousands of people to explore the
Mandelbrot set on their computers.  Do note however, that no
mathematical ability is required to explore and appreciate fractals
with Mand2000.

     Mand2000 draws pictures of the Mandelbrot set and other fractals
on your Amiga and allows you to explore them by zooming in towards
interesting areas.  In Mand2000 we have attempted to combine speed,
power and simplicity with a few unique features, all designed to make
it easy for you to discover uncharted regions of the Mandelbrot set,
Julia set and other fractals.

     Mand2000D is a full version of Mand2000, except that saving and
printing have been crippled.

     What makes Mand2000 different?

     Point and click animated zooming is the most intuitive way of
exploring the Mandelbrot and Julia sets that we could think of.  It's
as easy as using a zoom lens on a camera.

     Until now the idea of driving through the Mandelbrot set would
have been absurd - now it's a reality.  Plug in your joystick to
scroll and zoom your way around the most complex object ever seen.

     Mand2000's multi-pass drawing means that even slower Amigas can
take a test drive.  It lets you see an approximation of the final picture
in just a fraction of a second.  Even for pictures that will take several
minutes to complete, you can get a good idea of what your picture will
look like almost immediately.  This allows you to decide quickly
whether to keep zooming, or wait for the completed picture.

     Mand2000 has a multi-window, multi-requester design.  You can
adjust parameters and see the changes in real time as Mand2000
continues calculating while you use the requesters.  Leave as many
requesters and fractal windows open as you want.

     Mand2000 lets you calculate fractal zoom movies quickly, by
calculating key frames and letting Mand2000's TweenPlayer create the
intermediate frames at playback.

     Just a few of the other features include:  full AGA support,
Picasso II compatibility, literally dozens of different assembly
language math routines for accuracies ranging from 16 bits to 1000+
bits, on-line help, printing, multi-level undo, built in locations to
start you searching, full featured ARexx support, several ARexx
scripts supplied, graphical displaying of your location, etc.

     These are just some of the more significant and innovative
features in Mand2000.  There are dozens more.

NEW FEATURES:

     Since version 1.001 we have added:

     An AppIcon, some new ARexx commands and scripts, and optional
disabling of joystick zooming, for compatibility with dongles, etc.

BUG FIXES:

     Fixed all known bugs.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:

     Requires version2.04 of the OS.
     Three fractal equations are always available.  Four more
fractal equations are available with a 68881, 68882 or 68040.
