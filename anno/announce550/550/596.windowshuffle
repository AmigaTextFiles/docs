TITLE

     WindowShuffle

VERSION

     1.08

AUTHOR

     Andreas M. Kirchwitz (only version 1.08),
     based on WindowShuffle 1.07 by Stefan Sticht
     E-Mail: amk@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     This is a slightly enhanced version of Stefan Sticht's
     great commodity "WindowShuffle" (in german: Fensterln).
     With user-definable key-shortcuts you can browse through
     windows on the actual screen.  It's possible to exclude
     certain windows from being activated.
     
     Includes german version "Fensterln".

NEW FEATURES

     New in WindowShuffle 1.08:

     The new option "SETMOUSE=YES|NO" (default: NO)
     tells WindowShuffle to set the mouse pointer to
     the upper left corner of activated windows
     (when you browse through the windows).

     So you can use WindowShuffle together with tools
     like AutoPoint, SunMouse, SMaus (etc) which
     activate the window under the mouse pointer.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher).
