Subject: SysLog removed from AmiNet
Organization: * Private Amiga Site Bonn - Member of Individual Network e.V. *
Status: RO

Hi Dan. Here's my announcement concerning SysLog:

---8<----------------------------------------------------------------------
     A few days ago, I announced my enhanced version of SysLog in this
newsgroup. Since I found the plain sources on the AmiNet CD, without any
author, manual or copyright notice included, I assumed it would be
public domain.

     However, right after the announcement, I receiced e-mail from Olaf
Seibert, stating that he is the original author of this package and is
still holding the copyright. He told me, that I'd be welcome to modify
his program as will if I a) include his name and copyright into the
package and b) distribute it only with the complete source code.

     Because the previously uploaded archive didn't fulfill these
requirements, it has been removed from the AmiNet.

        Sorry for the unconvenience...Peter
