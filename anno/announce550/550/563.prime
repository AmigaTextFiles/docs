Fixed.

Zapped.  (I didn't like that line anyway. :)

Prime Mover is not hard drive installable.  I'd rather not announce this
fact, since I will probably get tons of flames from people who wouldn't
even buy the game if it were hard drive installable.
On-floppy copy protection IS my pet peeve, as it is to all of us at the
US office.  However, the UK office has not listened to our many requests
to make all new games hard drive installable.  After L2, we were led to
believe that all of our games would be hard drive installable, and thought
that Walker was going to be last floppy-based game.  This wasn't the case.
However, Hired Guns IS hard drive installable (and VERY system friendly).
I'll be posting that announcement tomorrow. (hopefully).

All replies should go to psygtech@psygnosis.com.  I'll be glad to take the 
email.  Hmmm... I should probably work up some kind of announcement that
Psygnosis is connected to the internet soon.
Hopefully, I won't get too swamped.

DESCRIPTION
 
     Prime Mover is a motorcycle racing game.  The game's playability
     sets it apart from all others.  Prime Mover has been painstakingly
     developed to provide a unique computer racing experience.

     Developers at Psygnosis have dedicated considerable research time
     into isolating the factors that make racing games so playable - 
     factors such as fluid graphics, cornering, and reducing 'stumbling'
     (the amount of time spent floundering on off-track grassy sections).

     o Race in 12 different countries
     o 3.7 Megabytes of graphics

     o Any Amiga model with at least 1MB RAM (512K CHIP or greater)

PRICE & DISTRIBUTABILITY

     $49.99 US Suggested Retail Price
     The full game is available from Amiga dealers worldwide.
