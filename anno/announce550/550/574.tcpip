TITLE
	AmiTCP/IP - TCP/IP protocol stack for Amiga

VERSION
	Release 2.1

NEW FEATURES
    * Inet-handler:
        - With Inet-Handler you can use AmigaDOS IO to access TCP protocol
    * finger: 
	- New application, prints information about local and remote users
    * fingerd:
	- Calls now finger when asked for local users. (This feature requires
	  Apipe-handler by Per Bojsen, Apipe-handler can be found e.g. on Fish
	  disk 783)
    * ls:
	- New application, an imitation of Unix directory lister.  Supports
	  multiuser filesystems. Included as an example of user and group
	  database usage
    * Napsaterm:
	- Default window title is now the name of the remote host
	- A public screen can be used with -S switch (thanks trossi!)
    * SynClock:
	- A simple script which synchronize clock in Amiga with
	  specified host in network
    * AmiTCP:
	- A timestamp is added to the log messages
	- Faster checksum calculation implemented in assembler
    * netlib: 
	- User and group database handling routines are added to the
	  net.lib. Release includes example databases for `ls' and `finger'
	  utilities, which use these databases
	- A real gettimeofday() using locale is also added

DESCRIPTION
	AmiTCP/IP is the first publicly available TCP/IP protocol stack for
	the SANA-II interface. AmiTCP/IP provides an application level socket
	interface to the Internet protocols as an Amiga shared library.

	The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, consists of
	user level protocols TCP and UDP which use IP as the network level
	protocol.  There is a wide variety of different network applications
	and services using TCP/IP protocols. The BSD compatible socket
	interface to Internet protocols makes it possible to port existing
	applications with minor modifications.

	AmiTCP/IP connects to the network via SANA-II compatible device
	drivers. SANA-II is a hardware and protocol independent network
	adapter interface specification published by Commodore. Several
	network adapter manufactures have made available SANA-II device
	drivers for their hardware. Currently there are SANA-II drivers
	available at least for Ethernet, Arcnet and serial line interfaces.
	So you can connect to Internet with Ethernet LAN, or via modem line
	with Serial line IP (SLIP) optionally with compressed headers (CSLIP).

	A typical application is to use (C)SLIP to connect to the Internet and
	have multiple connections simultaneously. You can read your e-mail and
	news, transfer files and have multiple terminal sessions at the same
	time over one modem line.

FEATURES	
	1. Standard SANA-II network device driver interface.
	2. BSD-compatible socket interface as a Amiga shared library.
	3. ARexx port for configuration and statistics.
	4. Over 200 pages of documentation including:
		- Installation and configuration
		- ARexx port commands
		- Programmer's manual based on the BSD IPC manual. This
		  is a fairly complete tutorial for developing powerful
		  client/server applications
		- Internal description of the implementation
		- Utility and API function reference guide in AutoDoc form.
	5. Basic applications with source included.
	6. Based on the BSD Net/2 release.
	7. Full source code included.

	While all Internet services and applications (telnet, ftp, news,
	mail) are possible with AmiTCP/IP, many applications are still under
	development by us and others. Current release of the AmiTCP/IP
	contains following applications:

	* Telnet - standard program to log on other systems **
	* Ftp - standard program to transfer files between systems **
	* Finger - prints information about local and remote users
	* ls - Directory lister with user and group information
	* Napsaterm - a VT100 terminal emulator using remote login protocol
	* NcFTP - an alternative interface to FTP protocol %%
	* NetFS - a Amiga specific network filesystem  ##
	* TCP - networking support for GNU Emacs. With TCP you can use any
	  elisp-based networking applications (Gnus, Gopher, Irchat etc.)
	* FingerD - a Finger daemon which prints user information or a banner
	  file
	* QWriter - an application to test and benchmark network

	Following network utilities are also available:

	* arp - tool to handle ARP hardware address translation tables
	* ifconfig - tool to control network interface parameters
	* inetd - Internet super server, which starts other services when
	  needed and provides some simple services by itself
	* letnet - a simple filter for connecting to TCP based services.
	  Suitable for scripts and testing
	* netstat - a ARexx script to get statistical information from
	  networking
	* ping - utility to test network connectivity 
	* route - tool to display and manipulate routing tables
	* online/offline - utilities to control SANA-II device drivers

	**) Telnet and FTP are ported by Mark Tomlinson and Goeff McCaughan
	%%) NcFTP is ported by Carsten Heyl 
	##) NetFS is authored by Timo Rossi

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
	AmiTCP/IP can be run from floppy and with one megabyte of memory,
	but as usual, a hard disk and more memory makes your life easier.

	Amiga OS release 2.04 or newer is required.

	SANA-II device driver is needed for your network adapter. A test
	device driver, agnet.device, is included with sources. Also the
	freely distributable Commodore A2060 (Arcnet), A2065 (Ethernet),
	SLIP and CSLIP drivers are included. The rhslip.device and
	rhcslip.device are derived from Commodore drivers but contain bug
	fixes made by Olaf Seibert.

	LHA or lx utility is required to unarchive distribution archives.

	Most of the source files has been compiled with GNU C 2.3 and SAS C
	6.3. Some utilities and libraries are compiled only with SAS C 6.3.
	However, only the executable files compiled with SAS C are tested.
	Also, the DICE C support is untested.

 	AmiTCP/IP software has been uploaded to the Aminet. It should be
	shortly available at the following Aminet hosts:
