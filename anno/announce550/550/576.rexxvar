  DESCRIPTION
  
       RexxVar is a simple but powerful way of exchanging data between ARexx
       variables and any program that uses input and output files.  The
       output  from a command or program (including a meaningful error code)
       can be placed in either one ARexx variable or in a stem array, while
       the input to a command or program can be read from either an ARexx
       variable or stem array.
  
       For example, to sort the values in a stem array called "lines."
       (whose indices ranges from 1 to n, and n is in "lines.0"),  one would
       type:
  
       Address REXXVAR 'Sort from REXXVAR:lines. to REXXVAR:sorted_lines.'
  
       The "sorted_lines." stem array would be created with an increasing
       integer index, starting at 1.  The total number of "sorted_lines."
       values is placed in "sorted_lines.0".  One can also sort words in a
       variable in a similar fashion.
  
       Substrings in a variable as well as stem array values can be
       delimited by any character (or none) on input or output.
  
       Support is also included for arbitrary (i.e., not necessarily numeric
       or increasing in order) stem index values.  For example:
  
            indices = 'TED BILL'
            fullname.BILL = 'William'
            fullname.TED = 'Theodore'
            fullname.BOB = 'Robert'
            Address REXXVAR "Type from REXXVAR:fullname./nl/indices"
  
       will output only the values relating to the desired indices:
  
            Theodore
            William
  
       In combination with AmigaDOS commands and programs, this facility can
       provide  a familiar and quick-coding means of importing and exporting
       file data (COPY command), passing data among AREXX programs (COPY
       command with PIPE:), listing of stem variable values (TYPE command),
       creation of stem arrays from variable values and vice versa (COPY
       command), extraction of environment variable values (GETENV command),
       editing of a variable's or stem array's values (your favorite
       editor), and more.
