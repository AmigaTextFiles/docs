TITLE

        PriMan, a Task Priority Manager

VERSION

DESCRIPTION

        PriMan is an easy-to-use, configurable, Style Guide-compliant utility
        to monitor the tasks running on your Amiga, and perform some actions
        on them, in a similar manner to TaskX (amongst others).

        Major new features since v1.0 include:

        - Commodities interface.  Now you can leave PriMan running in the
          background and pop it up with a hotkey!

        - Iconify option, for when you forget that hotkey...

        - Now closes windows of tasks you kill.

        - Now accepts arguments from the Shell.

        - Disables interrupts for far less time when building the task list.
