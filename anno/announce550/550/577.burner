Hello Dan,

Below is a submission for c.s.a.announce. It's about a new accelerator for the
A4000. My connection with the company is that the owner is a friend and I am 
currently developing a CD32 application for them. I hope it's up to spec. Please
let me knwo if it isn't. It's based on a press release and I have done my best
to remove most of the PR blurb and just leave the facts. :-)

DESCRIPTION

The Afterburner is a 50Mhz 4000/030 accelerator. Giving two times the speed
of the A4000/030 and adding a high speed local bus RAM interface. It has a 
60ns 'burstable' Ram interface performance that's intended to be superior to
the A4000/040. The Afterburner clocks its 68030 processor as well as optional
coprocessor at 50Mhz. The 'burstable' memory interface and optional local bus
ram should more than double the performance from the original rams utilizing
60 ns rams. It's 32 bit local bus interface should be three times faster than
the original onboard ram and can be expanded to 525MB using highspeed (60ns)
32 bit SIMM's. A Kickstart image may be mapped in this 32bit RAM The CPU, a
ceramic 68030 has a fully usable MMU and the (optional) co-processor can be
of the PLCC, or the cheaper PGA type. Sockets for both types are present on
the board.  

Software included is user-friendly auto-installing configuration software,
a benchmark program as well as testing software. Warranty on this board is
2 years.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

An A4000 Amiga computer. A version for the A3000(T) is also being developed
And should be available shortly.

PRICE

The Afterburner should be on display at the coming WoC in Cologne, Germany.
It's tentatively priced at US$ 599 for the entry model.

OTHER

A high resolution JPEG image of the product will be uploaded to AmiNet. Look
for a file called ABurner.LHA.
