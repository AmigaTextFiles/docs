	Glade Diviney (divineg@prism.cs.orst.edu)

DESCRIPTION

	`findit' is a utility that will help you locate files that
	match certain specifications. These specifications include:

	o Date searching (before/after/on a date, files changed or
	  created in the last X days)

	o Name searching (full AmigaDOS pattern matching supported)

	o Size searching (matches, greater than, less than)

	Any combinations of devices, volumes, or assigns can be
	searched.

REQUIREMENTS

	You must have MUI installed. It is available on Aminet as
	pub/aminet/dev/gui/mui13.lha archive. (See below for more
	Aminet information)

	Of course, installing MUI precludes that you are running
	AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.

PRICE

	Absotively, posulutely, and unequivicably FREE.

AVAILABILITY

	Available on Aminet as pub/aminet/util/wb/findit11.lha.

SPECIAL NOTE

	This archive contains a .info file. The .info file does
	not specify a large enough stack for drives with deeply
	nested subdirectories. Be sure to increase this value before
	running `findit' from the Workbench.
