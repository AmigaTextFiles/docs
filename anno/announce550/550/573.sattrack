DESCRIPTION

       A satellite tracking program.  Allows for selection of a database
       that can contain up to 1000 satellites.  Tracks satellites on a
       graphics display of the world.  All graphics are IFF compatible
       allowing for loading of display to standard painting program.
       SatTrack allows for input of satellite data using either standard
       data format or by simple user input.  Satellite database files 
       are included, also information for obtaining database updates from
       public domain and government locations.   All operations use 
       standard windows and menus.  SatTrack has a simulation mode that 
       allows for predictions in the future.  Operates on Workbench 1.3 
       and 2.0.  This is version 3.0. SatTrack is keyware, see the 
       registration file for more information.  
       SatTrack is fully operational until the expiration time is reached.

NEW FEATURES
	
       New for SatTrack 3.0
       Besides several modifications and enforcer hit corrections,
       SatTrack has added a FIND command as well as an OVERHEAD view
       display which allows for easier viewing.

       Overhead view is a map of the sky from your location.   It is
       representative of where the satellite will travel within your
       view.   The display represents a circle.  The center of the
       circle is "up".  The outside circumference of the circle is
       your "horizon".  Another circle 1/2 the size of the other circle
       with the same center is the 45degree azimuth from your location.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS


       Hard drive is optional.  
       Math Co-processor is supported but not required.
