TITLE
     EGSShow - GIF and JPEG viewer for the EGS window system

AUTHOR
     Dietmar Heidrich   s_heidri@ira.uka.de

     This software uses JPEG code from The Independant JPEG Group
     Version 4 and the GIF decoder written by Steven A.  Bennett.

DESCRIPTION
     EGSShow is a viewing program for GIF and JPEG files on the EGS
     window system.  This program is able to read the JPEG format as
     well as the GIF formats GIF87a, GIF89a and all future GIF files
     compatible with both of the above.  The format of the file is
     detected automatically.
     
     EGSShow needs a lot of memory for bigger pictures ( > 640 x 480)
     and EGS version 6 or higher.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
     Enhanced Graphics System Version 6 or higher.

     EGS, the Enhanced Graphics System, is a high-performance 24 bit
     true colour window system for the Commodore Amiga computers.  It's
     the first system that brings 24 bit drawin capabilities to the
     Amiga.  A demo version of EGS for the native Amiga chipset is
     available on AmiNet.  EGS is available for a lot of graphics
     boards, among them EGS Spectrum, Piccolo and EGS 110.
