TITLE

     Cookie

VERSION

     2.0

AUTHOR

     Amiga version by Andreas M. Kirchwitz,
     original Unix version by Karl Lehenbauer
     E-Mail: amk@zikzak.in-berlin.de

DESCRIPTION

     This is a very fast fortune cookie program.
     It prints a nice quote/saying/joke from your cookie database.

     The cookie database is a plain text file, entries are separated
     by "\n%%\n".  So you can easily add your own cookies with a
     simple text editor.  Once (after installation or changing your
     database) you have to generate a hash-table (a small file with
     lots of numbers) which helps Cookie to get an amazing fast
     access to entries in even very large databases.

     Includes C-source and 2 MB fortune cookies.
     Contact me if you want more ;-)
