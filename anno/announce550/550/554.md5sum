I thought I'd better leave this out, because it's different on every
system. wuarchive is /pub/systems/..., uni-kl is /pub/amiga/aminet,
etc... However, I'll add the path for uni-kl.

Yes, your're right. I'll add this.

I have a whole chapter about this problem in the manual and this is
indeed not very easy to describe, so I thought I'd better leave it out
than to describe it too short.

TITLE

     MD5SUM

VERSION

     Version 1

AUTHOR

     Original version by Branko Lankester and Colin Plumb--Amiga port
     and enhancements by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>.

DESCRIPTION

         MD5SUM is a small utility that allows you to build checksums
     over text- or binary files, using the "MD5 Message Digest
     Algorithm". These checksums can be stored in a file and can be
     validated later, using MD5SUM.

     For example, the checksums of the MD5SUM sources look like this:

          107788ec46ef6ab9dbb190215f5b6f1a  source/getopt.c
          ca1ada43f73cff4466adde1e88a8cf60  source/md5.c
          4a6dafa2f6282430e65d4728a1303a53  source/md5sum.c

         So, what is this useful for? Say, you're releasing a software
     package including sources to the public and want to make shure,
     nobody modifies the program (for example: add backdoors) and
     redistributes the modified version. (Do not laugh, this already
     happened with BBS packages or common utilities. Once, even a virus
     was added to a utility!) You could include the digest-file with a
     checksum of every single file in release archive and everybody
     could easily check the validity of the files.
