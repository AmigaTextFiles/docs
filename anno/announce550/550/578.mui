TITLE

     MUI - MagicUserInterface

RELEASE

     1.4

AUTHOR

     Stefan Stuntz  (stuntz@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

SHORT

     A system to create and maintain GUIs.

DESCRIPTION

     MUI is an object oriented system to create and maintain
     graphical user interfaces. From a programmers point of view,
     using MUI saves a lot of time and makes life much easier.
     Thinking about complicated terms like window resizing or
     font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

     On the other hand, users of MUI based applications have the
     ability to customize nearly every pixel of a programs
     interface according to their personal taste.

     This distribution is interesting for both, users and
     programmers. Please have a look at the supplied demo
     programs and at the documentation to see what MUI has to
     offer.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     MUI requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
     For developers, MUI comes with C, Oberon, Modula, Amiga-E
     and Assembler interfaces.

NEW FEATURES

     *** major changes since version 1.3 ***

     Rearranged preferences program. Instead of many different
     windows, page groups are used and should make things
     a lot easier.

     Implemented palette gadget for public screens.

     Implemented background pattern for screens (V39 and above).

     Improved text rendering speed about 20% (maybe even more if
     you have some data cache).

     Made cycle popups blazingly fast and more configurable.

     Implemented virtual (scrolling) groups.

     New color oriented classes: Colorfield, Coloradjust, Palette.
