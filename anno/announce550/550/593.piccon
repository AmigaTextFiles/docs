DESCRIPTION

	PicCon is a "programmer's pictureconverter". That is, it
	is not in the usual 'packed format -> packed format' style,
	but it is a program that convert packed pictures to RAW
	format, ready for inclusion in programs you are writing.
	Parts of pictures might also be cut out and saved.

	Features:
	* uses datatypes.library (with the appropriate datatypes
	 installed, you can load JPEGs, GIFs, or any other format)
	* handles AGA pictures
	* palettesaving in many formats (ECS/OCS, AGA, ECS/OCS/AGA
	 copperlists, ++)
	* RAW saving in numerous formats (bitplane, interleaved,
	 chunky, sprites (including AGA sprites) ++)
	* choice of saving as binary or source (both assembly and C)
	* screenmoderequester
	* correct handling of HAM6, HAM8, EHB and dual playfields
	* some nice timesaving features, like autocrop, flipping ++

	Note: the 1.02 demoversion contains a bug that makes 5 
	Enforcer-hits, these are not dangerous. This is fixed
	in the registrated version (which is free for any Mungwall-
	or Enforcer-hits whatsoever).
