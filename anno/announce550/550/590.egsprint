TITLE
     EGSPrint - Graphic dumping program for EGS and native Amiga

AUTHOR
     Dietmar Heidrich   s_heidri@ira.uka.de

DESCRIPTION
     This program prints the contents of the frontmost screen, no
     matter what depth it has or if it's a true EGS screen or a
     screen of an EGS workbench emulation.  This even works if
     there's no EGS at all or if the screen has a colour resolution
     of 24 bits (but then, only 12 bits are printed as the printer
	device supports no more than that).
     
     EGSPrint needs a lot of memory, especially for EGS screens.
     EGSPrint needs EGS version 6 or higher.  Verify that you have
     the file "EGS:egsclasses/PlaneMap12.class".  Printing occurs on
	the standard Workbench printer.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
     Enhanced Graphics System Version 6 or higher. "PlaneMap12.class".

     EGS, the Enhanced Graphics System, is a high-performance 24 bit
     true colour window system for the Commodore Amiga computers.
     It's the first system that brings 24 bit drawin capabilities to
     the Amiga.  A demo version of EGS for the native Amiga chipset
     is available on AmiNet.  EGS is available for a lot of graphics
     boards, among them EGS Spectrum, Piccolo and EGS 110.
