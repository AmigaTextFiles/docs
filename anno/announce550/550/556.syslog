Hi Dan!

Finally, SysLog made it to the aminet, so here's the announcement:

TITLE

     SysLog -- Amiga system log daemon

VERSION

     Version 1.7

AUTHOR

         The original author is unknown. However, Amiga specific stuff,
     enhancements and docs by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>.

DESCRIPTION

         SysLog is a set of subroutines designed to help you to debug
     your programs. Several concepts for debugging output exist (one of
     them is the debug.lib, released by Commodore) and all of them have
     a few advantages and disadvantages.

         I used a lot of them including self-written routines, but
     nothing was really satisfying at all. Then I found the SysLog
     package on the AmiNet which was appearently quite old and
     undocumented. However, I think this concept is the best and that's
     why I decided to take the project over.

         SysLog consists of two parts: A link library, containing the
     routines your programm should call, and a daemon, handling the
     debugging output. If your program jumps into the log-routine, an
     exec message is sent to the daemon's port and control is handed
     back to the program immediatly. The daemon will receive the message
     and will print it out to the standard output it has been started
     from or to one or more logfiles. Thanks to this concept, the
     to-be-debugged program has not to perform the logging itself.

         The big advantage of SysLog is, that all programs compiled with
     the debugging information use one logfile/output for their messages
     in cronologic order. So you can exactly determine what happened in
     what order.
