TITLE:
	FastCache

VERSION:
	1.1

AUTHOR:
	Philip D'Ath
	fido: Philip D'Ath at 3:774/605 (contact me here if you can)
	internet: pid@sol.cs.waikato.ac.nz (until approximately Dec. 93)

DESCRIPTION:
	FastCache is a fully associative cache for speeding up devices
	like hard drives.  Some of its features include:

	* Fully associate cache (one of the best algorithms)
	* LRU cache replacement policy (one of the best)
	* Can handle multiple drives
	* Can handle removable media
	* All cache settings are determined at run time
	* Optional write retention
	* Does not require large continuous chunks of memory
	* Uses a hashing system to locate date (one of the best)
	* Performs both forward and reverse prefetching
	* Will utilize the blitter to move data, if possible

NEW FEATURES:
	* Much faster.
	* GUI based statistical monitor.
	* Found a bug where if two or more copies of FastCache V1.0 were
	  running, and one was quit then the other(s) could crash.
	* Found a bug in the write back monitor process.  This bug causes
	  the cache to be flushed far more frequently than it was supposed
	  to be (wasting time).
	* Added an ARexx port to control FastCache, and to allow
	  statistical information to be obtained about the caches
	  performance.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
	KickStart V2 or better is required, and at least 512Kb of
	free RAM, preferably 1Mb.  A device to cache (like a hard drive 
	or a floppy drive).

HOST NAME:
	wuarchive.wustl.edu

DIRECTORY:
	/pub/aminet/disk/cache

FILE NAME:
	fcache11.lha

PRICE:
	A fee of $US20, $A20 or $NZ20 (whichever is most convenient)
	is requested after a three month trial period.

DISTRIBUTABILITY:
	FastCache is distributed under the concept of shareware.
