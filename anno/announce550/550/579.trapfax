Hello Moderator,

Here is an announcement for comp.sys.amiga.announce. If there is anything wrong  
with it, please say so; I took my time reading through the instructions, so I  
hope everything is allright.

As for myself, I am one of the authors of the package, and I have cleared with  
VillageTronic that I am going to post the announcement here.
