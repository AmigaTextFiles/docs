DESCRIPTION


            AORM is an AmigaGuide based online help system for Amiga
        computers and Video Toaster Workstations. Using a hypertext
        point and click interface, users have access to over 1,200,000
        bytes of information, contained in over 830 AmigaGuide pages.
                Using built in virtual memory, modules may be loaded
        in as needed, often occupying only 150k of memory. Modules
        may be updated as new features are added. Free maintenance
        updates are provided to registered users.

                Modules include:

                Answers to commonly asked questions (over 500).

                Hardware specifications on Amiga models (20 total).

                Explanation and usage of AmigaDOS commands (over 80)
                and usage of ARexx commands (over 20).

                List of features that makes the Amiga stand out
                from other platforms, and explanations of their
                capabilities.

                List of people, places, and things created on the
                Amiga computer.

                List of publications that carry Amiga related topics,
                including magazines and newspapers (over 30).

                Index of frequently used charts and tables, such as
                the Hayes Command Set and S Registers, list of most
                Amiga screenmodes, frequently used abbreviations such
                as RTG, XPK, DIG, etc, list of GURU Meditation Errors,
                AmigaDOS qualifiers and pattern matching, and more.

                Glossary of computer and Amiga related terms (over 500).

                A freely distributable demo version is available by
                request, and a public domain predecessor is also still
                available, known as AmigaFAQ v0.84 (by David Tiberio).
