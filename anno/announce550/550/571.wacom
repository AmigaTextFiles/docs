DESCRIPTION

     With this program you can use wireless tablets manufactured by Wacom
     together with the Amiga.

     The tablet is connected to the serial port of your Amiga (Multi-IO
     boards are also supported.) The driver supports tablets of the SD and
     the new UD-Series.

     Both the pressuresensitive and the not pressure sensitive mode are
     supported. (When in pressure mode the tablet transmitts the pressure
     which is applied to the tablet by the pen to the driver instead of
     button presses.)

     The driver enables you to control the Amiga mousepointer with your
     tablet. Appropriate buttons on the tablet's input devices are mapped
     to the normal mousebuttons. Therefore the driver can be used with
     almost any program.

     Also a softwareinterface is implemented which enables you to map
     unused buttons in own applications and/or to use the pressure and
     coordinates in own applications. Some sample source in C is
     included to demonstrate the usage of the interface.

     Driversettings are made using a comfortable Graphics Users Interface
     (GUI). Also a german catalogfile is supplied which you can use with
     at least Workbench 2.1.

     German and english documentation included.
