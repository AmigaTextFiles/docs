DESCRIPTION

     The ability to support your favorite transfer protocol was
     made possible through the use of external protocols (XPR).
     These XPR's are amiga shared libraries and although (through
     the XPR 2.0 specs) they allow you to set and change the
     settings for them, you cannot easily save them for a reboot.
     You are forced to setup or modify an environment variable
     each time you desire different settings.

     Enter XPRSet.  XPRSet is a utility designed to let you
     easily set, change and *SAVE* or *USE* the settings of
     XPR's via a GUI.  Currently, XPRSet only supports XPRZModem
     but other protocol support can be easily added if there is
     a demand for it.
