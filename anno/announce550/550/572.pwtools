Hi Dan,

Sheeze what a Dolt!!!!!!! I was in such a hurry I just realized I never made
the change I told you I made. Sorry about the screw up. Here is the corrected 
posting...

BTW, I also added a bit to the distribution letting people know I am looking
for companies to handle distribution of the product. Hope that doesn't violate
any taboos.

Thanks again.
Ronn Black

The publisher is New Horizons and you are likely correct. In actuallity the
product was named PWTools but I changed it in the release notices so that people
would understand that it was companion to ProWrite.  As you have requested I 
have changed the name back to PWTools.
