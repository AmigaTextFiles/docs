Hi Dan,

I tried to incorporate your suggestions as good as possible.
Don't know about the short NN description - writing an introductory
article would require some more space. Therefore I included some
references. Hope that's ok.

Regards, Michael

DESCRIPTION

        SynWorks is a fully integrated environment for design,
        training and test of neural networks. Currently, it supports
        11 different network types, the networks' sizes are only
        limited by the amount of memory available.
        SynWorks provides instruments to watch and track (to disk)
        all important network parameters, all kinds of errors and
        of course, all input and output values provided to or by
        the network. 
        All network parameters can be edited, and, starting from
        standard networks, custom networks can be created by 
        adding links and neurons, modifying all functions (learn,
        transfer, error, evaluation). Input/output behaviour can
        easily be specified in terms of ranges, sources, and
        targets. Network display modes include structural,
        error-related, change-related, weight-related and
        memory related displays. All displays provide point-
        and click interfaces to the displayed parameters and
        are available simultaneously (watch chipmem !). 
        All networks can be printed in four different
        modes, giving a textual, structural and two different 
        descriptions on the network's weight map.
        SynWorks also provides a context-sensitive on-line help 
        system that includes descriptions of all actions and 
        important components, linked together via cross-references
        and easily accessible via buttons and hot-keys.
        Also, SynWorks features a full AREXX-interface that allows
        to define macros for internal use as well as using a network
        as part of a larger system, execute demonstrations etc..

	The full version of SynWorks includes five disks with 
	both a 68000 and a 68020/881+ version of SynWorks, several
        examples, linkable libraries for easy use of networks in
        other applications (supporting the Amiga and Sun
	workstations), a tool for data visualization and
 	a set of printed manuals, including a short introduction
	to neural networks.


INTENDED AUDIENCE
	
	With SynWorks, people generally interested in neural networks
	are provided with an easy-to-handle, integrated environment
	that allows them to experiment with neural networks on their
	own data. The visualization possibilities of SynWorks make
	access to the network easy and intuitive. The network's
	behaviour can be watched and tracked, which in combination
	with the included examples results in a good insight of
	how the actual neural network is working.

	On the other hand, people working on neural network projects
	and application programmers will find SynWorks powerful
	enough for most of their needs. Especially in the signal
	processing field, neural networks are quite attractive.
	With SynWorks, programmers can create a signal processing
	or pattern recognition unit on the base of a neural network,
	and use this network in their application by simple
	function calls. 


WHAT ARE NEURAL NETWORKS ?

	A neural network is a processing device, either an algorithm,
	or actual hardware, whose design was motivated by the design 
	and functioning of the building blocks of the human brain,
	such as neurons and connections (axons, dendrits).
	It is realized as a network of many simple processing units
	that are regularly interconnected. The connections carry
	a numerical information, they are "weighted".
	What makes neural networks very attractive is their ability
	to "learn" from examples. Most neural networks have some 
	sort of "learning law" which describes how the weights of 
	connections are to be adjusted on the basis of presented 
	patterns.
	Probably the most popular neural networks are the feedforward
	networks, with the backpropagation technique/generalized
	delta rule being the learning law.


WHAT CAN NEURAL NETWORKS DO ?

	In principle, NNs can compute any computable function, 
	i.e. they can do everything a normal digital computer 
	can do. 
	Especially can anything that can be represented as a 
	mapping between	vector spaces be approximated to 
	arbitrary precision by feedforward NNs (which is the 
	most often used type).
	In practice, NNs are especially useful for mapping 	
	problems which are tolerant of a high error rate, 
	have lots of example data available, but to which 
	hard and fast rules can not easily be applied.
