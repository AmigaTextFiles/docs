     Edouard-Montpetit College and NAID
                                          

     CollУge Edouard-Montpetit is the biggest CEGEP (roughly a US College 
     equivalent) in the province of Quebec. The school offers a 3 year
     computer science program for students from high school who intend
     to start earning some dough after (or even *during*) CEGEP instead of 
     heading off to University. CEM's involvement with NAID gives a chance
     to it's computer science students to come show what they are made of,
     and in the process, maybe attract some new students from high schools
     around Quebec to this well-known establishment.
     
     The organizers thank everybody in the school staff involved with this
     event.


                                                    
     DemoNews - The demo scene's weekly newsletter 
                                          

     DemoNews is a weekly publication for the demo scene. It is produced 
     at the Internet FTP site ftp.eng.ufl.edu (HORNET).  This newsletter 
     focuses on many aspects of demos and demo making. Everyone is welcomed 
     to contribute articles, rumors, and advertisements.

     
     You can subscribe to this newsletter by mailing 
     
     listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za 
     
     and putting "subscribe demuan-list your_real_name" in your message. 
     The listserver is what sends out this newsletter every SUNDAY morning. 
     kimba@it.com.au is the keeper of the listserver. If you have any 
     questions about subscribing to DemoNews, write to him.

     
     You may be wondering how you can get previous issues of DemoNews.  
     Well fear not!  There are two different ways to do so:

  1: FTP to hornet.eng.ufl.edu and go to /pub/msdos/demos/news/OLD_NEWS and
     start downloading anything you see.

  2: Now you can request back issues of DemoNews via e-mail. Start a letter
     to listserver@oliver.sun.ac.za (any subject line) and in the body of the
     letter include "GET DEMUAN-LIST <INDEX>" where INDEX refers to the
     index number of the issue.

     For example:  GET DEMUAN-LIST 37

     This would retrieve DemoNews #74 (part 1 of 2).

     
     Any questions regarding HORNET and/or DemoNews can be sent to:
     
     Christopher G. Mann (Snowman) r3gcm@dax.cc.uakron.edu

     The organizers would like to thank Christopher G. Mann (aka Snowman)
     for letting us use his newsletter over and over again as a means of 
     publicity for this event.

     Competition Rules
                            

     Demo Compo
               
     The Demo's runtime size must not exceed 3 megs. Time limit is 
     20 minutes. All demos will be run on the same machine (Contestants 
     will have some time to test their productions before the compo). 


     Intro Compo
                
     The intro's runtime size must not exceed 100k. Time limit is 
     5 minutes. All intros will be run on the same machine (Contestants 
     will have some time to test their productions before the compo.). 


     Music Compo
                
     All the songs will be played by default with Inertia Player (IPlay).
     If you have a file format IPlay cannot play or you don't want to
     use IPlay, be sure to have your own player (All songs must be 
     tracked, no midi files will be accepted). There will not be a seperate 
     compo for multi-channel and 4 channel songs. (A song is a song).
     Song length cannot exceed 5 minutes. Limit one song per person.
     

     Graphics Compo
                   
     All graphics must be "hand drawn" (so to speak). No ray-traced,
     ripped or scanned images. Maximum resolution is 640x480x256. The 
     latest version of CSHOW will be used to display the pics. When
     submitting a pic, an earlier version of that pic and a non-signed
     version must also be handed in. Limit one pic per person.


                                  
     Competition Computer
                            

     The demo scene has evolved tremendously in the last 2-3 years, it's
     standards changing constantly. From the 386 with PC Speaker in '90,'91
     to a 486DX 33 with a SoundBlaster Pro (ASM'92), until just recently 
     Advanced Gravis introduced it's UltraSound (ASM'93), and the next
     year the computer standard was set to a 486DX/2 66 (ASM'94). 
     
     We are now in 1995, and the upccoming demo-scene reunion is NAID. To
     continue the PC tradition of setting a higher, better standard, we
     (the organizers) would like to suggest the 486DX/2 80 as computer, 
     which in our opinions, is the way to go for upgraders, since the 
     DX/2 80 and DX/2 66 chips only have about a 20$ difference, and are 
     basically the same except for, of course, the clock speed :) .
     
     The computer used for the compos will be:

      д  486DX2/80 with 8 Megs of RAM
     д   A 32bit Local Bus VGA card 
     дд  Gravis UltraSound sound card w/ 1 meg
     дд  or Sound Blaster Pro2 
     дд  or Audiotrix pro
         


                                  
     Distribution          
                            
 
     Everything will be distributed on-site and off, unless the 
     respective authors request otherwise.

     Frequently Asked Questions
                            
                                    

To start this off, a little description of the town of Montreal, and 
Longueuil (where the party is at). It isn't exactly a FAQ, but I've had some 
mail that made me believe that some people don't know where Canada is, let 
alone the city of Montreal. Canada is not a state, it's that huge mass of 
land that's north of the USA. Montreal is an island city in the province 
(roughly the equivalent of a state) of Quebec, surrounded by the St-lawrence 
river, and a few urban towns (including Longueuil), with a total population 
of around 3 million +. The State just south of the province of Quebec is 
Vermont. The average temperature in the winter in Montreal is -15C (5F) 
although this winter has been pretty warm to date (-10C average). In the 
spring (eg.easter), it's hot enough outside to start biking, say about 
10degrees C to 15C (50F - 60F). (The girls start wearing mini-shorts as soon 
as the snow has all melted, right before easter, what a coincidence!..).
The first language is french, although most people speak english too nowadays 
(look at me). 
Of course, I can go on and on but..

On with the real questions..


Q - How can I get road maps to get to the party be car?
A - When you buy your tickets, we send you a map along with the tickets if        
    you request it.(see next question).

Q - How do I buy tickets? reserve my space on the site &/or sleeping room?
A - This is the address you should write to for tickets. 
     
          NAID / APRAXIA
          College Edouard-Montpetit
          945, chemin de Chambly
          Longueuil (Quebec), CANADA
          J4H 3M6
    
    Include in your enveloppe: 
    - a check for 5$ (per person) if you are staying one day only.
    - a check for 7$ (per person) if you are staying both days.
    - add one dollar if you want maps (shipping&handling)
    - a letter with the names of the people coming, the number of tickets,         
    if you would like to reserve sleeping quarters, a table on the site,etc.
  
    Check payable to: NAID/APRAXIA - College Edouard-Montpetit
                                     -------------------------

    Money is in canadian funds (7$ CDN equals about 5-6$ US). All donations              
    accepted. Keep in mind that this is a non-profit organization, and all        
    donations will be put to good use to make the party better for everyone.

Q - What can you tell me about the sleeping quarters?
A - People will be staying in classrooms. A group can request to have their       
    own room (specify in letter for tickets). A room can accomodate 20 people     
    comfortably. Each classroom can be locked using a key which is available      
    following a 20$ deposit. The key is given to the "leader" of a group. One     
    key per classroom.
    Electricity is available in every room, and bathrooms aren't far away.

Q - Can my group and I have a table on the site?
A - -ALL- groups will have a place on the site. Don't forget to request it in     
    the letter sent for tickets. If possible, mention the number of computers     
    you are bringing along, or that you need (though there is no guarantee        
    you will get a computer if you don't bring your own). Reserving space in      
    advance helps alot, so don't hesitate to send for tickets today.

Q - Will there be any trouble finding a parking space near the party-place?
A - The party being in a school (and a big one at that), lots of parking 
    space is available (about 2000cars).Oh, and it's free too :) .

Q - Will there be food available on the site?
A - There will also be lots of coffee, Tim Horton's donuts and other little        
    goodies on sale onsite.
    Right outside the school, there is a Pizza Hut, a Suisse Chalet, a hotdog     
    joint, a Harvey's, a Subway and a Tim Horton's. Other known restaurants 
    are also available not too far away (a few minutes of city bus), along 
    with arcades, bars, etc.

Q - Which groups are going to be at the party and will compete?
A - I am not a PR for all the groups out there, so please stop asking this
    question. Lots of groups have shown interest in the various compos, but
    it's too early to know for sure who is comming or not, who will
    be competing in what, so my final words on this subject are:
    BE THERE AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.
    Thank you :)

Q - I am not going to NAID, but I want to enter a compo anyways, how can I?
A - Basic rule number one, to collect a prize you gotta be there.
    Being nice guys =), we've decided to be a bit flexible: regarding the
    demo and intro compo: you can enter it, it will be shown on the big
    screen, but no prize will be awarded (eg. no voting will be done on it).
    Regarding the music and graphics compo: if a person who is absent, but
    his/her GROUP is present on the site, a song/pic can be submitted with
    the GROUP's name on behalf of mr./missus X . Limit one song/pic per
    GROUP, and one song per person. Which means (Yes, I'll draw a picture
    for you) :

    Let's take for example the group ELiTE, with these members:
    T00 Cool, Radboy, and Gino.
    T00 Cool can enter a song and/or a pic in the respective compos
    Radboy can do the same
    Gino too.
    Afterwards, t00 cool, radboy and gino all enter either compo as "ELITE"
    and run away with the first prize in all compos..
            
Q - Frankly, why does the first NAID invitation intro suck ?
A - We are also disapointed about the intro. First off, it was supposed to
    be finished months ago, and yes, the coding isn't incredible.

    When NAID started in August, we were all demo *lovers*, and not some kind     
    of world-famous demo group organzing a demo party  (oh, which reminds me      
    of the question:
    Q - Why doesn't the "NAID / The Apraxia factor" team have a group name?
    A - It's because we havn't DONE anything yet. ;> ). 
    ...
    The people whose names are mentioned in the info-file were "picked up"
    along the way from our computer science courses. We were lucky to have
    at least one person with a little bit of demo coding knowledge.
    Yes, we could have had the intro done by a group with more experience,
    and yes, some groups offered there help at the time (thanx to NV and 
    Abstract for wanting to help), but we had our little "team" who wanted
    to help too. I personally didn't know any of these people, but the
    other main organizer Khan had discovered that Boggart was really a good
    coder (and mind you, he isn't so bad). So we gave him a chance to do
    something for us. Every bit of code in the intro is his, the best part
    being the flame effect in the NAID font. Unfortunately though, that 
    little effect seems to eat up all of the cpu's speed, thus making the
    rest slooooow. The 10k S3M player is also his, but a little unfixed
    bug in it didn't like the tune I had made for the intro, so at the last
    minute we had to take one of our buddy's existing "ready-in-5minutes"
    tunes, which explains the somewhat "crappy" music (Although you gotta 
    admit that phone ringing is pretty funny :) ).

    At any rate, what is done is done, and from now 'till easter, another
    intro will probably be released... this time not done by us <g>.
    And please remember that although the intro doesn't help NAID's image, 
    there is basically ONE thing that'll make this demoparty good or not: 
    the ORGANIZING.
    So 99.999999% (as an intel pentium would put it..) of our efforts is put 
    into it. (1/ to make sure we'll have lots of fun and 2/ to avoid hidden 
    "NAID SUCKS" messages in future demos :> ).
    
Q - Is there a hotel nearby and how much does it cost?    
A - For some strange reason, some people don't like the idea of sleeping on
    the ground in a classroom :> , so here's info on nearby hotels:

    The closest hotel is a Holiday Inn, which is about 5-10 minutes walk away
    from the school. The cost is 75$+ tax (canadian) for a 2 person room, 
    one night.

Q - Can I buy my ticket at the door?
A - Yes, but there are no guarantees. If you come from hawaii and the place
    is full, you'll just have to wait for people to leave.
    Take my advice and buy your tickets in advance.

 3/ If you are arriving on Friday, and/or leaving on Monday (because of your
    plane, train or bus).
 4/ The appropriate compo application forms filled (or what is fillable,
    eg. we don't *need* to know the title for your song or pic, what we
    do need to know is if you are really entering that compo).

    IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY ENTRIES IN A COMPO, a selection
    of these entries will be made to decide which ones will be shown on 
    the big screen. 
    (Please HURRY UP! and send your forms in, before this becomes a 
    problem.)

    This, however, doesn't change the DEADLINE date & time of the compos,
    it's just that the organizers *need* to know how many demos/songs/etc.
    they will be handling with.


    ..stay faithful kids! Send for your tickets today!
    Remember: Be there and die or be nowhere and cry.
