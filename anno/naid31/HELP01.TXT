               NAID - THE LAST DITCH HELP FILE - March 31rst, 1995



  Well, you've done your best to follow the directions, but to no avail.
What to do? Stuck in a strange country <Well, Canada can be strange 
sometimes, let's admit it.> with no friends around. What's a demofreak to 
do? Don't worry, here it is, the ultimate solution : The last ditch help
file. We recommend you print it and keep it close at all times. If you
ever get lost, it'll probably be handy.

  If you get lost in Montreal, the easiest solution is always the taxi.
They'll know the way, you can atleast count on that. Just tell them to 
bring you to 

  COLLEGE EDOUARD-MONTPETIT

  You might also want to call us for indications/info/help at the
following number : 

  (514) 679-2630
  
  And ask for people who can inform you about the NAID Demoparty. The
people who answer the phone will have been warned and you'll be put in
contact with people of our team.
  
  Well, a reminder. The province of Quebec is mainly populated by 
people who speak french. While most of us quebecers can call 
ourselves bilingual, some of us are not. So, if you ever find yourself 
in a situation in wich you need to explain to somebody that you are lost, 
and that he does'nt seem to understand a single word you are saying, 
here's the drill. First, tell them the following things <in english> :

  1.- You are from out of town. 
  <Yes, you can tell them you are a tourist. It's okay :>
  2.- You do not understand a word of french.
  3.- You'd like to find a phone. <Yes, to call the number above>
  4.- You want to get to College Edouard-Montpetit wich is located on
      the South-Shore. Ideally you want to get there via the metro 
      station called METRO LONGUEUIL.


  If all this fails, it just might be that the person does not 
understand a single word of english <duh :>. Do not fear, here is the
solution to your problem. 


  BONJOUR. JE SUIS UN VISITEUR DANS CETTE MERVEILLEUSE VILLE ET JE
  SUIS PROBABLEMENT PERDU. POURRIEZ-VOUS M'INDIQUER VERS UN TELEPHONE
  PUBLIC OU VERS LA STATION DE METRO LA PLUS PROCHE? 
  MA DESTINATION EST LE COLLEGE EDOUARD-MONTPETIT, QUI SE TROUVE
  AU 945 CHEMIN CHAMBLY A LONGUEUIL. MERCI!!!


  Yes, that's french for : "Hi. I'm a visitor in this marvelous town 
and I am probably lost. Could you show me the way to a public telephone or 
towards the closest metro station? My destination is College 
Edouard-Montpetit, wich can be found at 945 chambly road in Longueuil. 
Thank you!!!"

  So, unless you hit people who can't read, you can show them this
tidbit of french up there and they should help you get on your way.

  Remember people, if you ever get lost, all you have to do is contact
us at the folowing number : (514) 679-2630, and ask for Naid organizers
to help you get under way. If there is any sort of problem at that point,
you can also try to contact us at (514) 442-3923. 

  So, print this file and keep it with you at all times, and happy 
demo-party!
