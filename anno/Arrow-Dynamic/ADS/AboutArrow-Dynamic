 About Arrow-Dynamic Software
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You may know us better as Arrow Pd. Under this name we have been in
the Pd market for some time (and still are) and we've built up a name as
an efficient, honest, company who look after our customers. We provide
a prompt, courteous service. Our philosophy is to provide a service that
we would like to receive.

   Shareware is very important to the Amiga, particularly at the
moment. We've always done our best to promote shareware demos and
encourage people to register, because we really believe in the shareware
concept as being the best way to reward Amiga programmers. However,
no matter what we all like to believe, for most shareware authors
the proceeds are not sufficient to keep them programming. Obviously
as Arrow Pd we have come into contact with a lot of shareware authors
and the main thing we tend to hear is that very few people register.
You'll also see this sentiment in a lot of shareware docs.

   One of the reasons for shareware not reaching its full potential is
that authors can't afford to spend out on monthly advertising
campaigns or time hawking it around the Amiga press. Another reason is
that while most Amiga users are honest and have good intentions they
just "don't get around to" sending off the often modest amount
requested for registration.

   So, we believe the nearest viable alternative is Licenceware. The
reason being that it provides the distributor with enough to pay for
promotion and magazine advertising and other costs and also assures
the authors their just rewards for their hard work. The obvious
advantage over shareware is that the program is paid for in full, by
the customer, up front.

   We genuinely care about the Amiga (we do not own, or work with, any
other computer) and the direction it is going, and this is why we are
moving into the licenceware market, to try to inject some life into our
beloved machine.

   To this end we have worked out the highest possible proportion that
we can pay back to the authors, who really deserve all the recognition
and rewards.

   What with us doing all the hard work of promoting and selling, you
are left to do the job which you like best....programming!


Hadji and Jules.
