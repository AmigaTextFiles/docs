 Guidelines For Licenceware Submissions
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   First of all, we would like to say something about our policy on
evaluating submissions. We will reply to you within one week (or seven
days....whichever is sooner!) but mostly much quicker than this.
(Postal strikes and Bank holidays not withstanding). We guarantee to
give you a reply. If we do not accept your program, we will return your
disk/s and not keep any copies.


The conditions for submitting software for evaluation are;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) The program must be 100% your own work. The copyright of your
   program will remain with you, which means that if you rip off someone
   else's work, then you will be responsible for the consequences. This
   means legal action against you.

  
2) When submitting work, please inform us whether the program has been
   released in any form before, e.g. PD or shareware. This includes any
   previous versions of the program.


3) If your program is accepted we will want exclusive rights to
   distribute it, including any updates, revisions or later versions.

 
4) Please send your completed Submissions form, which includes the
   following information, with your program:

   a: A description of the program 
   b: Programming language
   c: For games, please supply cheats/passwords/codes or a complete
      solution, so we can fully test them.
   d: For games, state how many levels etc.
   e: Which machines you have tested it on


5) Make sure that there is FULL documentation on disk. This must be in
   either ASCII or AmigaGuide. If the documentation is within the program
   please tell us. 


6) We prefer all programs to be in standard AmigaDos format.


7) If accepted, we will require a small file (supplied) to be inserted
   inside your main executable, for the purpose of copy protection.


8) We are not interested in distributing anything which will require an
   '18' certificate. Likewise, we will not accept anything which we
   consider offensive.

  
9) Please supply a stamp with your submission for your reply. 



What happens next
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               
   If we accept your program we will send you a contract. If you accept
the conditions of the contract, this will need to be signed and returned.

   Once we receive your signed contract, the program will be included
in the next 'Arrow-Dynamic' Catalogue. We will also send it to all the
major Amiga magazines for review. Additionally, it will probably be
included in our magazine adverts, although this may take eight weeks or
more. We will take care of all promotion and advertising for you.

   To move away from traditional Licenceware schemes, we have developed
a different scheme for our pricing policy, to allow more flexibility
for the smaller programs. This is how it works;

   We will advise you on the price we will be charging. For example, we
envisage most one disk programs to sell for £3.99 and two disk
programs to sell for £4.99. However, a smaller program, such as a very
good utility which only takes up a percentage of the disk, might sell
better for £2.99.


   Your program will be sold for;

    £2.99/£3.99 if it is on 1 disk

    £4.99 if it is on 2 disks

    £5.99 if it is on 3 disks


   Your royalty per copy sold will be 40%, i.e.;

    1 disk at £2.99......your royalty will be £1.20
    1 disk at £3.99......your royalty will be £1.60
    2 disks at £4.99.....your royalty will be £2.00
    3 disks at £5.99.....your royalty will be £2.40

Remember this is 40% of the RETAIL price of the disk, not 40% of the
profit....and WE pay for the branded disks, the packaging, the labels,
the advertising and running costs out of our share.

   Obviously we cannot guarantee that your program will sell, but
provide us with a good program and we will do all we can to make it a
success.

Thank you for reading this and hope to hear from you soon.

Hadji and Jules.
