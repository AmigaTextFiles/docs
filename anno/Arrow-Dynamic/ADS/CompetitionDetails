Arrow-Dynamic Software Competition

To celebrate the launch of our new Licenceware scheme, we are running a
competition for all you programmers out there. What we would like you to
do is write a program that will appeal to Amiga users. This can be a game,
utility, application....in fact, anything you like. It doesn't matter 
whether it's on one disk or ten as long as it's good! For full details,
please look at the 'Guidelines for Submissions' section on our Cat Disk.

Now to the bit you've all been waiting for........We are offering the
following Amiga games as prizes for the best three submissions. In
addition, the winner will have their program released as an
'Arrow-Dynamic Software' title.
 
The prizes are:

First Prize: 'Alien Breed 3DII - The Killing Grounds'
(or equivalent Amiga game of your choice), 20 Maxell blank disks, a CCG
starter deck of your choice from our cat disk, and your program will
be released as 'The Arrow-Dynamic Software Competition Winner!'.

Second Prize: A choice of either 'Impossible Mission 2025' (A1200 version)
or 'FIFA International Soccer' (WB2+), plus one Arcadia CCG story and
character pack, and a mouse mat.

Third Prize: 'Jurassic Park' (A1200 version) and a mouse mat.


Good luck!
