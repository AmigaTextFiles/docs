OpalVision Enhancement Modules:

A complete range of enhancement modules will be available soon. Add framegrabbing and genlocking, de-interlacing, Digital Video Effects (DVE'S) and input switching capabilities.  OpalVision's modular design circumvents the usual problems with incompatibility and loss of signal integrity associated with the external components available from third parties and the "Rat's Nest" required to connect them. The expansion modules connect directly to the OpalVision Mother Board without tying up Amiga slots. Adding all of the modules create a complete 24-bit Amiga desktop video system.



OpalVision Frame Grabber + Genlock Module:

·A true 24-bit frame grabber, genlock, composite decoder (color splitter), composite encoder, 256-level linear keyer with alpha channel output and live video effects processor.
·Broadcast-quality S-Video (S-VHS or HI-8) or composite input and output.
No external splitter required.  Uses the Sony broadcast camera chipset for quality in excess of broadcast standards. 
·Instantly freeze and save multiple video frames or a sequence of frames as 24-bit images.  No still frame or signal preparation required for image grabbing.  
·High-quality integration of 24-bit OpalVision and Amiga images with video.  Define a 256-level transparency overlay (alpha channel) for OpalVision or Amiga images so live video can be displayed through transparent and semi-transparent portions of the image. 
·All features are software controlled for fading, source switching, keying, etc.
·Uses external video or internal Amiga sync.
·Installs directly on the OpalVision Mother Board.  No external wiring or power supply required.


OpalVision Production Switcher

OpalPaint

An unequalled painting and image manipulation program.  Fast. Real-time. Full 24-bit. OpalPaint gives you complete control over Opalvision's 16.8 million color palette. Includes a full-range of drawing tools and image-processing modes.


Tools

· Includes all standard painting tools: Sketch (Dotted & Freehand); Line; Filled/Unfilled Outline; Arc; Filled/Unfilled Ellipses/Circles/Rectangles; Text; Brush Cut.
· "Rip and Replace" repeats last drawing action after moving one pixel in any direction.  Very useful for precise placement of brushes and objects.
· Definable level of anti-aliasing in any mode and with any tool
· Definable level of global transparency for all operations, or set transparency levels of individual RGB or HSV components.
· Texture mapping with 32-bit brushes, using any Drawing Tool, Drawing Mode and Transparency Gradient. 
· Transparency overlays "painted" using Alpha Work Mode can be attached to cutout for 32-bit brush. 
· Magnify tool with complete zoom in/out control


 Modes

· 18 built-in Drawing Modes, including Paint, Tint, Colorize, Brilliance (Brightness), Contrast, Gamma, Additive, Subtractive, Mosaic, Smear, Smooth, Shade, Sharpen, Negative, and many others. Most modes have independently adjustable parameters via an on-screen slider. For example, you can adjust the Smear amount from 1% to 100%.  All Drawing Modes are used in conjunction with the drawing tools; apply effects to either limited areas or the entire image.
· Additional Drawing Modes on disk for unlimited image processing power and expandability. Includes such Drawing Modes as Add Noise & Convert to Grey. 
· True 24-bit multiple gradients, with adjustable radial, linear, horizontal, vertical, border, and point gradient fill choices; gradient colors can be either RGB or HSV color spreads
· Transparency gradients. Define multiple levels of transparency for a fill, similar to color gradients. Can be used alone or in combination with color gradients


Resolutions / File Formats

· Loads IFF (any resolution, including HAM), IFF-24, JPEG, OV_FAST. Saves IFF-24, JPEG and OV_FAST.
· Define unlimited spare pages.  Spare pages can be any resolution and page size.
· Rubthrough from any one spare page to the same or another spare page.
· Supports all resolutions of the OpalVision card.
· Page size in any resolution is definable up to the limits of available memory, or hard-drive space if the virtual memory option is utilized up to 32,768 x 32,768 pixels.  Large images can be scaled for viewing on standard screen.
· Two different stencil types:  Keep-out stencils (like artist's friskets) which can be drawn with the painting tools over any area of the image.  Color stencils can include or exclude ranges of color.
· With one mouse click switch between three different Work Modes that all use the same Drawing Tools: Paint mode, for normal painting and image processing; Stencil Mode for drawing keep-out stencils, and Alpha mode to paint with grey scales representing transparency.  This transparency mask is used with 32-bit cutout brushes and is supported by the OpalVision Genlock and FrameGrabber for semi-transparent live video overlays.
· OpalVision Frame Grabber/Genlock can grab images or cutout brushes directly into spare pages and the work area.
· Combine Drawing Tools, Drawing Modes, texture mapping, transparency and effects for incredible image manipulation power.


 Palette Control

· Supports several methods of real-time 24-bit color selection.  Choose colors from RGB & HSV sliders, use the 16.8 million "color picker", choose from a list of named colors, or use OpalPaint's color mixing area to create your own.
· A working palette of 260 selected colors is available at all times.  Load and Save custom color palettes.  This palette can be changed at any time without changing colors already in the image.  Colors in gradients, smoothing, etc. are not limited to colors in the working palette.
· Includes pre-defined palettes, such as Pastels, Metals, Ocean, Skintones, Camouflage, Fluros, etc.   Each has its own pre-mixed mixing area for easy color selection.
