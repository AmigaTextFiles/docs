                     CONTENTS OF THE EMC PHASE 1 CD



FONTS       ALL the fonts on this CD have IFF preview screens, so you simply
            have to double click on the preview screen (or access it from a
            directory utility like Directory Opus) to "see" the font!
            This basically means that you DO NOT have to install a particular
            font into an application just to see what it looks like.


The Phase 1 CD contains the following fonts...

Type1       Adobe Type 1 fonts from EMC volumes 4, 5, 6, 7 & 16.

CG          Compugraphic Scalable fonts from EMC volumes 8, 9, 10, 23 & 24.

PDraw       Professional Draw fonts from EMC volumes 18, 19 & 20.

Clipfonts   52 Full colour High resolution Clipfonts.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CLIPART     ALL clipart on this CD is FULLY sorted. This means that for
            example all the pieces of different "Animals" clipart are not
            simply thrown into a directory called "Animals". In the clipart
            contents listing you will notice that there is a number (enclosed
            in brackets), this tells you the number of sub directories inside
            the main directory.

            Furthermore, EVERY sub directory also contains an IFF thumbnail
            index screen. So if for example you wanted some "Frog" clipart,
            you would go into the "Animals" directory, then into the
            "Reptiles" directory, where you would be presented with
            directories for Toads, Snakes, Crocodiles etc, and obviously
            Frogs. Inside the "Frogs" directory you would find all the "Frog"
            clipart and an Thumbnail Index screen that shows you all the
            "Frog" clipart in that directory!


The Phase 1 CD contains clipart on the following subjects...

IFF         Animals(114), Fantasy(27), Music(12), People(73), Religion(12)

IFF COL     Birds, Cars, Cats, Dinosaurs, Dogs, Fish, Horses, LionKing,
            Music, Planes & Reptiles.

EPS         Animals, Buildings, Computers, Food, Logos, Office, People,
            Transport, USA & World.
            (This directory also includes high resolution IFF conversions of
            all the EPS format clipart)

              EMC's Phase 1 CD... What the Magazines said



Amiga Computing -------------------------------------------------------------

    "The Phase 1 CD is a joy to use"

    "This is an excellent CD. Not only is it full to the brim with quality
     fonts and clipart but it is superbly organised."

    "At the end of the day this CD is virtually impossible to find fault
     with, if you need clipart, fonts or images you need this CD."

Overall Rating 9/10  Issue 93, December '95, p37



Amiga User International ----------------------------------------------------

    "This is a DTP and DTV disc, or Desktop Publishing and Desktop Video to
     the un-initiated. EMC, famous for their font collections on floppy disk,
     have added this CD to their range that should be considered "essential
     for your CD-ROM library"

Rating 94%  December '95, p36



Amiga Shopper ---------------------------------------------------------------

    "Phase 1 is a professionally compiled CD."

    "This CD is ideal for DTP/DTV users."

    "This is a very useful CD."

    "We've seen others like it before, but few have been as well polished and
     presented!"

Rated 90% and received the Amiga Shopper "Star Buy" award... Xmas '95, p48



Amiga Format ----------------------------------------------------------------

     "This is a dream CD for DTP fans."

     "This is a damned fine CD and a must for DTP/DTV enthusiasts"

Rated 90% and received the Amiga Format "GOLD" award Issue 79, Xmas '95, p106



DTP expert Larry Hickmott's EM magazine -------------------------------------

    "My personal opinion is that the CD is well worth the asking price and
     considering the alternative shovelware CDs available...it's a real
     bargain!"

    "If you are remotely interested in either Desktop Publishing of Desktop
     Video, this CD should be thought of as an invaluable addition to your
     CD-Rom collection"

    "If you only ever buy one Amiga fonts and clipart CD, E.M.C's Phase 1 is
     the one to go for!"

    "Quite simply, this is one of the best CDs you can get when it comes to
     fonts and clipart!"

EM magazine don't rate products 

EM's review also stated that they have never reviewed a CD before, basically
because they have never found a CD worth reviewing!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carl Gamble and the guys from Optonica Ltd.       Rated the Phase 1 CD at 93%

    "The ONLY criticism that we could come up with was that the images do
     not have 24 bit versions included."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

G.W. Thompson from Tyne & Wear                  Rated the Phase 1 CD at 92.5%


    "The organisation and layout of directories, along with the illustrated
     index for each font or illustration could not be bettered, and serves
     as an example for other companies to follow."

    "As for any suggestions for future releases, all I can say is more of
     the same please!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

S. Fredericks from Essex                         Rated the Phase 1 CD at 100%


    "Great CD, can't wait to receive the others. It's guys like you that
     make owning an Amiga worthwhile!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Craig Stevens from Sterlingshire                Rated the Phase 1 CD at 97.5%


    "I have a great number of Amiga CDs and to be truthful your Phase 1 CD
     is easily the best! I sincerely hope that the other CD producers and
     developers out there will sit up, take notice and hopefully start
     producing CDs that can match the quality that Phase 1 has achieved.
     Well done EMC! Keep up the good work! The only reason that I have not
     given the Phase 1 CD full marks is  because mine arrived with a broken
     case!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paul Andrews from Lancashire                    Rated the Phase 1 CD at 92.5%


    "Phase 1 is absolutely superb, please put my name down for Phase2, 3,
     4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... I have been a customer of yours for quite a while
     now and your software has consistently been of excellent quality.
     The Phase 1 CD is literally the "icing on the cake"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alan Myers from Bedfordshire                      Rated the Phase 1 CD at 95%


    "After spending much time delving into the inner workings and contents
     of EMC Phase1 I have come to the conclusion that you have produced an
     excellent CD, one which I honestly cannot fault. The reason that I
     haven't given EMC Phase 1 full marks is because I am leaving a little
     room to manoeuvre when judging/ grading EMC's Phase 2's registration
     card."

Amiga Computing -------------------------------------------------------------

    "Our collection of CDs has grown immensely over the past few months
     and the best so far has been Phase 2 by E.M.Computergraphic!"

    "The CD's Index system is excellently implemented, making it nice and
     easy to use, and with a thumbnails file you can, again, view all the
     pictures from a directory in a second."

    "Phase 2 is one of the best complete packages I have seen for a long
     time"

    "It's the most user-friendly and efficient image/font package on the
     market!"

    "There's no rubbish here, it's all quality stuff!"

Rating 94% December '95, p36



Larry Hickmott - CU Amiga/Amiga Shopper's DTP expert ------------------------

    "Phase 2 is another excellent CD from EMC that proves to be an
     excellent companion to their Phase 1 CD. EMC have a long standing and
     solid reputation for supplying high quality products and their Phase 2
     CD only goes to reinforce the reasons why they have gained this
     reputation and goes to prove that they can consistently create hig
     quality products."

    "Phase 2 doesn't exhibit any of the quality loss normally inherent with
     follow up disks."

    "This CD is definitely recommended if you have even a passing interest in
     desktop publishing or desktop video. If you already have the Phase 1 CD
     you shouldn't miss this one, if you don't have EMC Phase 1, I would
     wholeheartedly recommend that you add the Phase 1 and 2 CDs to your
     collection. For those of you that read the conclusion of a review before
     the actual content"

    "...add Phase 2 to your CD Rom collection now and roll on Phase 3...

    "Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on releasing Phase 2
     BEFORE your proposed launch day. We don't see many examples of
     this nowadays."

    "Secondly, I really thought that the quality of your Phase 1 CD  was
     truly excellent and to be honest I really didn't think that the
     quality of Phase 2 would compare. All too often a company releases a
     product that is excellent only to follow with a product that is poor
     quality. Well done EMC!"

CLIPART     ALL clipart on this CD is FULLY sorted. This means that for

            the main directory.

            Furthermore, EVERY sub directory also contains an IFF thumbnail
            index screen. So if for example you wanted some "Snooker"
            clipart, you would go into the "Sports" directory, then into the
            "Snooker" directory, where you will obviously find all the
            "Snooker" clipart and an Thumbnail Index screen that shows you

      whole range of quality backdrops that can be used for either video
      or multimedia work."


     "The CD is easy to navigate, not least because of the time that has
      been taken producing the thumbnail indexes for each and every
      directory, including the fonts, so you can browse through before
      deciding what you want to use."

                     CONTENTS OF THE EMC PHASE 4 CD

                     ---- Desktop Video Dreams ----




EMC Phase4 is a dedicated Desktop Video CD, aimed directly at Amiga users who
use their Amigas for any type of video, presentation or graphics work.

EMC Phase4 is a totally unique and professional CD Rom containing a high
proportion of copyrighted and exclusive "never seen before" material.




The EMC Phase4 CD contains...

1.  Since bitmap fonts are faster to load, access and use in most video
    applications (Scala themselves supply bitmaps!) we are including a large
    number of bitmap fonts, with IFF previews in 20 sizes between 18 point
    and 168 point.

2.  Fountain/Intellifont ready Compugraphic scalable fonts with IFF previews
    and automatic install scripts. No more messing about trying to install
    fonts, just click on an icon and the Compugraphic fonts will be installed
    into your system  ready for use!

3.  Music modules. We have used ScalaMM for years to produce corporate
    presentations for companies like the YMCA and Powersport International.
    As a direct result of this, and to satisfy our own needs, we spent many
     hours finding the best modules out of the hundreds of bad ones. For the
    first time, you will have access to music modules that you can be
    confident in using in your presentations.

4.  Sound samples. phase 4 contains hundreds of high quality sound samples
    that have been fully sorted into categories and are ideal for use as
    "spot effects".

5.  Well over 300 megabytes of "never seen before" professionally designed
    backgrounds covering subjects such as Weddings and Technology. These
    absolutely stunning backgrounds will add the professional touch to any
    video presentation and will be supplied in 800x600 24bit jpeg along with
    IFF 256 colour conversions in PAL 768x576 and NTSC 768x480 formats.

6.  Textured backgrounds, such as Marbles, Stones and Fabrics, again in full
    video overscan, that will also be supplied in 800x600 24bit jpeg,
    PAL 768x576 and NTSC 768x480 256 colour IFF formats.

7.  A selection of useful Image backgrounds, again in full video overscan,
    that can be used for a wide variety of presentation work. Again all
    supplied in 800x600 24bit jpeg, PAL 768x576 and NTSC 768x480 256 colour
    IFF formats.

8.  Program Demos. A custom created 38mb demo of the new Imagevision from
    ImageLab Technologies, a 20mb Demo of Optonica's Multimedia Experience
    and a DeluxePaint 5 demo from Electronic Arts. 

9.  Countdown timer animations, testcards, multimedia buttons, on screen
    timers, over 20 video utilities and a whole host of other stuff!

@NODE Index "EMC Index CD Details"
@TOC EMC_CDs


                  E.M.Computergraphic's Index CD

                   Release Date: 20th May 1996




 @{" Magazine Reviews  " LINK IxMag}  What the magazines said about Index.

 @{" Customer Feedback " LINK IxCus}  What our customers said about index.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


                  EMC's INDEX CD... What is it?



The scenario...

You've got loads of clipart and Image CDs that are probably badly organised! 



The problem...

You have access to hundreds of megabytes of clipart and images but, the only
way of finding out what you've got on your CDs is to load each individual
image into an application before you can see it!

You may also need convert each image before you can even load it into your
application! 



The solution...

E.M.Computergraphic's INDEX CD. This CD contains IFF thumnail index screens
(just like EMC's Phase 1, 2 & 3 CDs) of the graphic data contained on over 30
of the most popular (not necessarily the best) CDs currently available.



CDs covered...

Pro (hahaha) Fonts & Clipart, Graphic & Adult Sensations, World of Clipart,
ProPics, Pandora, RHS Color Kollection, Aminet 3-7, Multimedia Toolkit1,
Clipart Heaven, Fresh Arte, Mother of all Clipart, PCX Potpourri, Publique
Art, SoMuchScreenware, SciFi & Fantasy, Gifs Galore, Clipart Goliath,
Clipart Warehouse, GifGalaxy and Almathera's CDPD3, Demo, Demo2, 10 on10 &
DTV CDs.



Usage...

If you are looking for a particular graphic, just load INDEX into your CD
drive and quickly scan through the thumbnail index screens via either WB or
a directory utility. Once you have located the graphic you require, remove
INDEX, and load the relevant CD into you CD drive (provided of course that
you actually have the CD the graphic is on!)... What could be simpler?

This CD offers you organisation and rapid access to the graphic data on your
CDs.

Even if you don't have all of these CDs, you can use EMC's INDEX to "see" the
contents of a  particular CD before you part with your money and buy it!



             ******* DUE FOR RELEASE ON 20TH MAY 1996 ******

     "Makes life a great deal easier and all at a very reasonable price"

     "It's a damn shame that we need Cds like this in the first place."

      their products should be as accessible as possible."

Rated 80% Issue 87, August '96, p61



CU Amiga -------------------------------------------------------------------

     "Ploughing through a CD of pictures with no index can be so much hassle
      that the offending disc is often banished to the bottom drawer and
      never used. In these cases EMC Index will breathe new life into those
      old CDs. You'll probably find plenty of gems that you never knew were
      there!"

     "If you have more than a couple of the CDs featured on this disc then
      it's certainly worth the cash!" 

     "It's a great idea that works very well!"

     "As with all EMC's discs for the Amiga artist in desktop publishing,
      video and graphics, this is another that I can recommend for adding to
