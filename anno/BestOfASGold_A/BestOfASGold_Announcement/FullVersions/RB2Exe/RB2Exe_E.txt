RB2Exe
------

Additionally, RB2Exe is also contained in a full version
on this CD-ROM. With RB2Exe one can turn Rainboot configs
into stand-alone Amiga executables. So you can create
own demos or Multimedia programs with Rainboot and release
then for example on Aminet then. All external data are
linked to one program then, so that it runs and works fully
stand-alone.
