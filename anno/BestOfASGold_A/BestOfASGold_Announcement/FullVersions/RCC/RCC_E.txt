Rainboot Config Creator (RCC)
-----------------------------

In order that everyone is able to create his own Rainboot
configurations in an easy way, the Rainboot Configuration
Creator, called RCC, is also contained in a full version
on the CD-ROM. This program makes it possible with the
help of a graphical user interface to offer a very easy
way of creating own Rainboot configurations. The RCC
supports the most Rainboot functions and allows also
reediting of already created Rainboot configurations.
Additionally it has a wide Online help, which can be
accessed directly from the interface of RCC. For every
Rainboot user the RCC is a must-have!
