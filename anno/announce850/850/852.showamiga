TITLE     

     ShowAmiga

VERSION   

     1.1

AUTHOR

SHORT     

     An Information System about Amiga by C= Germany

TYPE      

     demo/euro

DESCRIPTION

     The ShowAmiga Information System was uploaded to AmiNet
     demo/euro.  The executable program is ShowF+A2.run (Basic,
     compiled with AC/Basic).  The source text is ShowF+A2.  All files
     should be kept together in one subdirectory.

     This archive contains my "Amiga Propaganda Texts" ("What you
     always wanted to know about the Amiga") in both German and
     English, plus a demonstration and viewing program for them.  The
     program is rather (not fully) secure against false inputs, so you
     could give it a try and let it run in a shop unattended.  This
     implies that it's multitasking hostile by intention.  It's easy
     to create another language version of this all.  It's also easy
     to strip off the control lines from these texts and thus regain
     pure ASCII texts.  And being pure ASCII, it's also easy to update
     the contents of these files always current with new
     products/situations.

     The program runs on practically every Amiga known, on PAL and
     NTSC, I only did not test with 3rd party graphics cards (Topaz 8
     and 9 hardcoded).

HOST NAME  

     Any AmiNet host such as ftp.wustl.edu

DIRECTORY  

     demo/euro

FILE NAME  

     ShowAmiga.lha (79393 Bytes)

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	   Free, and I invite everyone to spread this as far as possible!
