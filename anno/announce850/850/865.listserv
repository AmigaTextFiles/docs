TITLE

     Peti's Amiga ListSERV

VERSION

     Version 3.0

AUTHOR

     Written by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>.

DESCRIPTION

         ListSERV is a software package to handle and maintain mailing
     lists, based on the well-known UNIX LISTSERV tool. With this
     daemon, users can easily subscribe or unsubscribe mailing lists,
     requests the frequently asked questions (FAQ) or index all mailing
     lists available on the machine.

         The archive contains all programs required to set a mailing
     list up plus a brief description in AmigaGuide and TexInfo style.
     Full source and RCS files are provided, too.

FEATURES

     - ListSERV's important parts are written in ARexx and thus can be
       modified to fit your special requirements.

     - ListSERV may add a signature to any article posted to the list.
       Each mailing list may have its own signature, so you can state
       vital information there.

     - ListSERV automatically sets the "Reply-To:" entry in the mail
       header to the list's address. Therefore, replies to articles
       delivered via the list will be sent back to the list again. Users
       can simply reply.

     - ListSERV supports totally secret and encrypted mailing lists,
       using the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) package. You can set up
       confidential mailing lists that can be used for development of
       commercial soft-/hardware.

     - ListSERV supports FAQs.

     - ListSERV allows you to archive all traffic of a mailing list.

     - and more...
