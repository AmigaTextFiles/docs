TITLE

     Fractint

VERSION

     2.1

COMPANY

     Stone Soup Group is responsible for the pc version of this program.

AUTHOR

    Terje Pedersen (terjepe@stud.cs.uit.no) is doing the amiga port of
    fractint.

DESCRIPTION

     Fractint is a fractal generation program which has been rather
     popular on the PC's for a long time. Now all amiga owners may
     enjoy it too! The Rolls Royce of fractal programs! It has an
     amazing number of different fractal types and even more fractals
     can be generated by a huge amount of script files. It can generate
     3d images as well as 2d images. Mapping fractals on spheres and
     generating images for viewing with 3d glasses is also possible.
     In addition to an amazing number of other things!

NEW FEATURES

V2.2:
  Added sound.

  The stereo 3d option was missing from '3d view options'.

V2.1:
  Some options was missing from several requesters.  fixed.  The
  interface generation is improved somewhat.  Now the input boxes is
  all of the same size!

  Now using reqtools screenmode requester.

  The cycle colors buttons is replaced by Load and Save palette.

  Amigaguide now pops up if you press the Help buttons or press
  help-key when the fractint screen is active.

  Some fractals runs 30-40% faster!

  I removed the FASTMEM flag so it will work on a computer with no
  fastmem.
  
  When color cycling (shift,alt,ctrl)-F1-F10 was supposed to give
  some nice color ranges.  Now it does!  (at least on AGA..)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
          
     Any amiga with WB2.04.
