TITLE

     Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

VERSION

     Version 2.3a patchlevel 3

AUTHOR

     Original version written by Colin Plumb and various contributors
     Amiga port and enhancements by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>

DESCRIPTION

        Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is
     a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS,
     Unix, VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people to
     exchange files or messages with privacy, authentication, and
     convenience. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a
     message can read it. Authentication means that messages that
     appear to be from a particular person can only have originated
     from that person. Convenience means that privacy and
     authentication are provided without the hassles of managing keys
     associated with conventional cryptographic software. No secure
     channels are needed to exchange keys between users, which makes
     PGP much easier to use. This is because PGP is based on a powerful
     new technology called "public key" cryptography. And PGP performs
     the public-key functions faster than most other software
     implementations. PGP is public key cryptography for the masses.

        Please take note that the archive contains a readme file, with
     checksums for ALL files in the distribution and is signed with my
     key! Please be careful, if this file is missing or rigged!


CHANGES

     This version includes many changes compared to the original 2.3a
     release:

     - modified PGP to recognize local (SET vs. SETENV) shell
       variables, too. (Only available under OS 2.04 or later!)

     - the executable is now pure and may be made resident

     - converted the documentation to AmigaGuide-format.

     - added an Installer script (Thanks to Jacob Ellis!!)

     - Whenever PGP needs user input, it will check whether the current
       standard input is interactive. This will avoid infinite loops
       and crashes when started with "PGP -f <test". If the standard
       input is not interactive, PGP will pop up an requester asking
       for the string.

     - PGP is able to read its commandline from a file! (Note: The
       Amiga version is the _only_ PGP version that has this
       capability. :->)

     - I modified PGP to display the last 32 bit of the internal key
       ID, like PGP 2.6 does. This reduces the chance of ID-collision.

     - PGP 2.3a.3 can read and write encrypted texts or signatures in
       PGP 2.6's packet format.

LEGALITY

        This version of PGP is perfectly legal anywhere besides the
     United States of America and Canada. US citizens will have to wait
     until the Amiga version of PGP 2.6 is finished. An announcement
     will be made here, too.
