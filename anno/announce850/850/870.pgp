TITLE

     Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

VERSION

     Version 2.3a patchlevel 4

AUTHOR

     Original version written by Colin Plumb and various contributors
     Amiga port and enhancements by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>

DESCRIPTION

        Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is
     a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS,
     Unix, VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people to
     exchange files or messages with privacy, authentication, and
     convenience. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a
     message can read it. Authentication means that messages that
     appear to be from a particular person can only have originated
     from that person. Convenience means that privacy and
     authentication are provided without the hassles of managing keys
     associated with conventional cryptographic software. No secure
     channels are needed to exchange keys between users, which makes
     PGP much easier to use. This is because PGP is based on a powerful
     new technology called "public key" cryptography. And PGP performs
     the public-key functions faster than most other software
     implementations. PGP is public key cryptography for the masses.

        Please take note that the archive contains a readme file, with
     checksums for ALL files in the distribution and is signed with my
     key! Please be careful, if this file is missing or rigged!

CHANGES SINCE 2.3a.3

     - added Assembler routines for basic maths, resulting in a major
       speedup (up to 100% on 68020 or higher processors)

     - compiled a special version for 68020 or higher processors
