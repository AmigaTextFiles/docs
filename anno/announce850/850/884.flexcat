TITLE

     FlexCat - The flexible catalog generator

VERSION

     1.3; see CHANGES below

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

     Since OS 2.1 the Amiga offers a way to make programs run in
     different language, the locale.library. The most important
     part of the locale.library are the so-called catalogs which
     contain the strings of one language. (Usually found in
     Locale:Catalogs/<your-language>/<program-name>.catalog.)
::
     Commodore offers a program called CatComp, which creates
     these catalogs and some C-source, which makes using them
     much simpler. FlexCat is a CatComp-replacement. The
     difference between FlexCat and CatComp (as well as some
     other replacements, KitCat for example) is, that FlexCat is
     flexible in the generated source: Any programming language,
     any individual needs should be satisfied. However, FlexCat is
     not more difficult to use.

     This sounds like a contradiction. FlexCat's solution is to
     use template files, the so called "source descriptions". Ready
     to use examples for Assembler, C, C++, E, Oberon and Modula-2
     are distributed, additionally an example for supporting catalogs
     on Workbench 2.0. Any other examples are welcome.

CHANGES 

     V1.1: Bug fixes

     V1.2: Bug fix in the E source generator

     V1.3: Bug fixes again (at least one severe)
	   Improved the speed of the GetString function
	   Added C++ and Modula-2 source descriptions
	   Added Spanish docs
	   Added spanish and schwaebisch catalogs
