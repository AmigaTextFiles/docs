Status: RO

TITLE

    CycleToMenu - turns cycle gadgets into popup menus


VERSION

    2.1  (6.6.94)


AUTHOR

    Federico Giannici <MC4080@mclink.it>


DESCRIPTION

    CycleToMenu is a commodity that turns the standard cycle gadgets
    into popup menus or "expanding" gadgets. This way, selecting the
    desired option is easier and faster.

    The look and behaviour of the popup menus are highly configurable
    by a font&resolution-sensitive configuration window.

    CycleToMenu works under AmigaOS 2.0 but takes advantage of some
    features of AmigaOS 3.x.

    The archive contains the documentation and localization files in
    five languages: English, Italian, German, Dutch and French.


NEW FEATURES

    - Using an overlay for the configuration window and other rarely
      used functions. Even if the program is slightly longer, normally
      it uses 11Kb of memory less than the previous version!
    - Added the "Centre on current item:" option. It also allows to
      obtain a more MUI-like look.
    - Fixed a bug in the GT_PostFilterIMsg() function's patch. It
      solves also a problem with the "Overscan" gadget of the
      screenmode-requester of the reqtools.library.
    - Added the French language support.
    - Added an optional MagicWB-style icon.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    AmigaOS 2.0.
    AmigaOS 2.1 is required for the localization.


HOST NAME

    Available via anonymous FTP from Aminet,
    for example ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2).


DIRECTORY

    /pub/aminet/util/cdity


FILENAME

    CycleToMenu-21.lha  (53593 bytes)


PRICE

    Free.

    intact and only a nominal fee is charged for its distribution.
