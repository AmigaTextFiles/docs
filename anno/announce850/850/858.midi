DESCRIPTION

    Master Midi v2.0a is a tool for controlling your midi-setup.

    At this moment it supports the following instruments:
        General Midi
        Korg 05R/W
        Korg 03R/W
        Yamaha PSS-680
    And by writing your own voice-module, every other instrument.

    You can voices on channels, change the controllers, mix the
    various channels and edit the effects of the Korg instruments.
    It also supplies a patch-bay, mute and solo, and an overview 
    of which voices are set on the various channels.

    It coorperates well with Midi Play by Janne Syvdniemi: you can
    see the program changes, control changes, volumes and levels of
    the played song. You can change -realtime- the controls, voices
    and volumes of the song.
