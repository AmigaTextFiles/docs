DESCRIPTION

   JukeBox is a program to play compact digital audio discs by emulating
   a graphical user interface similar to common CD players. It provides a
   command line oriented, fully programmable ARexx user interface as well.
   It will work on CD-ROM players plugged to a scsi-hostadapter or CDTV.

   JukeBox will open its windows on the workbench (or any other public
   screen) and do its best to allow a font sensitive layout. The main
   goal during development was to create a very comprehensive, self-
   explanatory utility.

   Features:

      Full Intuition interface
      ARexx port
      Fully programmable
      Keyboard shortcuts
      Supports any release of AmigaOS
      French, dutch, italian and german localization
      with Workbench 2.04/2.1/3.0
      Any screenmode or depth supported
      Windows on workbench or any public screen
      Tested with Enforcer and MungWall
