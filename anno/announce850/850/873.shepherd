DESCRIPTION

          The shepherd is a gods-game (a bit like populous and powermonger)
          where the player has to move animals around to gain territory and
          food.  There are 50 species of animals and they all behave in a
          different way.  (they live, eat, walk around and actually chase
          eachother)
          
          The game contains lots of graphics and sound- effects.  It is OS
          friendly, multi-tasking and HD installable.
          
          The Shepherd is a shareware game.  A registration fee of $30 will
          be asked from regular players.
