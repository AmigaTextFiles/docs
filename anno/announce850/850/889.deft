TITLE

	Deft II - utility to replace icon default tools

VERSION

	1.0

AUTHOR

	Lionel Vintenat.

	E-mail address: vintenat@irit.fr

DESCRIPTION

	Deft II is a new version (completely re-programmed as I haven't
	the original sources) of an old (but great :)) tool named Deft
	( (C) 1992, Gary Smith ).

	Briefly, Deft II is an utility to modify the default tools of
	your icons : you give to it a set of paths, a set of old/new
	default tool couples, and Deft II will recursively scan all
	these paths to change the default tools of your project icons
	according to your preferences.

FEATURES

	* a MUI GUI with all the consequent convenience for the user
	(keyboard shortcuts, appwindows, etc)
	* multi-paths handling for scanning
	* multi-default tools for replacing
	* wildcard using for the default tools to replace
	* preferences saving
	* ARexx port support
	* online help
    
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	* OS release 2.04 or newer
	* MUI v2.1 properly installed

HOST NAME

	Software will be uploaded July the 25th to the Aminet Site :

	wuarchive.wustl.edu

	and will be readily available on other Aminet sites.

DIRECTORY

	/pub/aminet/util/wb

FILE NAME

	DeftII.lha

PRICE

	Deft II is distributed under the "GiftWare" concept, in other
	words, send me what you want if you use this program !

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	Freely distributable as long as the distribution conditions
	exposed in the documentation are applied.
