DESCRIPTION

	VStation is a linear (read: VCR) edit control system

	VCRs and camcorders, as well as RS-422 high end equipment.
	The control hardware is connected to the computer via RS-232.
	Developer information is included with the package if you
	wish to adapt the system to work with other platforms.
	The hardware is capable of controlling three VTRs at a time,
	but you may connect fewer if desired. The AREXX port provides
	over 100 functions and access to all relevant internal
	variables for easy integration into the Amiga environment.
	NTSC/PAL/SECAM are supported. SMPTE timecode reader option is
	available.

	EDL autoassembly, convienient tapelog<->editpoint features,
	event-specific ARexx command hooks, support for Toaster
	effects, framestores, and CGs. And many other new features.
