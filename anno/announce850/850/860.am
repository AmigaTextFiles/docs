Status: RO

TITLE

	AM - Account Manager for muFS

VERSION

	1.0  (first public release)

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

	Are you running muFS, the Multi User File System for the Commodore
Amiga?  Then you surely have thought of a program providing an easy way to
maintain the users and groups in your system.

	Of course such a program should have a graphical user interface
which allows doing all necessary operations by a few mouse klicks or key
strokes.  Additionally, it should be localized i.e. speaking to you in your
preferred language.

	Then `AM' is the program you want.  It was written to support the
system operator's work by supplying an easy-to-use user interface based on
MUI.

FEATURES

	* localized (currently English, German, Netherlands, Norwegian,
	  Portuguese, and Swedish catalogs)

	* needs and makes extensive use of MUI 2.0 (`muimaster.library'
	  version 7+)

	* supports the following operations on the muFS system files

		- create new users/groups

		- edit any characteristics of an existing user/group

		- delete users/groups

		- temporarily ban a user from the system

	* automatically creates new $HOME directories and installs default
	  files there by executing a user supplied script

	* checks $HOME directories (not functional yet)

	* searches muFS partitions for files with bad owner information and
	  changes them
