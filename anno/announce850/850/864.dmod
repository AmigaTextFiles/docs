DESCRIPTION

  D.A.S Module Player is a player specifically designed for high end users.
  Special attention has been given to efficient handling of modules
  in lists. Modules can be sorted and handled with such attributes as
  name(+revese), date(+reverse), style and author. For better
  handling modules can also be divided to two groups within every
  list and can also be played according to those groups.
  Adding modules to list is easy since DASMP can take care of modules 
  already eisting in list and modules newer than current list.

  Modules can be extracted from virtually any external archives such
  as LHA and ZIP. XPK and PowerPacker packed modules can also be used.

  Since DASMP requires MUI, the Graphical User Interfce of the player
  is totally under user control. 
  User control over other features of DASMP can be squeezed to three words:
  6 configuration pages. Module specific configurations include things
  like module duration, author, style and date.

  Inoverall DASMP is very complex system giving user a possibility to
  use features he needs and forget the rest.

  What DASMP is not: 
  DASMP is not small and is not ment to be a replacement for those cute 
  little players floating around nets. DASMP is ot ment to be used on
  non accelerated a500 or a2000.

NEW FEATURES

  S3M modules supported. This EPL is fixed A LOT since last release
  and now works. ScreamTracker III modules support 16 digital channels.
  D.A.S.MP can play these modules in multitasing. Quality is selectable
  by user, the higher quality the higher CPU usage.

  FT modules. FastTracker 6 and 8 channel modules. Quality selectable.

  Full FAST ram player for ProTracker modules. Only 128 kb CHIP needed.

  Main program has severalenhancements including RE-DESIGNED MAIN
  WINDOW.
