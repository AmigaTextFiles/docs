TITLE

  StarWoids

VERSION

  1.0 - 3 level demo.

AUTHORS

  Coding:     Martin Kift       (M.H.Kift@swansea.ac.uk)
  Graphics:   Rowan Crawford    (dljar1@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au)
  Sound:      Rob Wells         (rewel1@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au)

DISCRIPTION

  StarWoids is a ShareWare shoot-em-up game.

  The game design is based on Thrust (C64) and Oids (AtariST) but
  also contains ideas from many other games such as Asteroids and
  X-pilot. Each level presents a different challenge - some are
  puzzel based, while others might be pure shoot-em-up or even timed.

  The demo version here contains three large, and quite hard, levels.
  There is a decent reward if you manage to complete the 3 levels.

FEATURES

  o Raytraced intro animation.
  o Full StarWars theme music.
  o Joystick and/or keyboard control.
  o Keyboard configuation saveable to disk.
  o Can be played from floppy or hard drive.
  o Colourful use of dual playfield mode.
  o TOOLTYPE support for turning off music and/or animation.
  o Installer support.
  o Fantastic playability.
  o Fully system friendly.
  o Blood! :)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  StarWoids requires PAL, and at least 1 meg of memory. With only
  0.5 meg of chip memory, you will need to disable the music using
  the TOOLTYPES. StarWoids should run on any Amiga.
