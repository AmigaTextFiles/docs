DESCRIPTION

  D.A.S Module Player is a player specifically designed for high end users.
  Special attention has been given to efficient handling of modules
  in lists. Modules can be sorted and handled with such attributes as
  name(+reverse), date(+reverse), style and author. For better
  handling modules can also be divided to two groups within every
  list and can also be played according to those groups.
  Adding modules to list is easy since DASMP can take care of modules 
  already existing in list and modules newer than current list.
    
  Modules can be extracted from virtually any external archives such
  as LHA and ZIP. XPK and PowerPacker packed modules can also be used.
    
  Since DASMP requires MUI, the Graphical User Interface of the player
  is totally under user control. 
  User control over other features of DASMP can be squeezed to three words:
  6 configuration pages. Module specific configurations include things
  like module duration, author, style and date, volume, preload and
  fade speed.
    
  In overall DASMP is very complex system giving user a possibility to
  use features he needs and forget the rest.

  What DASMP is not: 
  DASMP is not small and is not ment to be a replacement for those cute 
  little players floating around nets. DASMP is not ment to be used on
  non accelerated a500 or a2000.

NEW FEATURES (Since 3.1)

  14-bit Stereo Mixing routines for MTM/S3M/FT players. Lots of
  enhanced features. Added SCANDIR option. Better dasFAST player with
  Surround and Mono playing options for normal PT modules.
  
  Works with MUI 2.1. Previous versions will not work with MUI 2.1.
  Enhanced and more intelligent installer script.
