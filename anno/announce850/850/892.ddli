TITLE

    The Duniho and Duniho Life Pattern Indicator

VERSION

    3.40

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

    The DDLI is a personality indicator measures for four different
    sets of preferences that result in a total of sixteen different
    psychological types.  These four sets of preferences are

        How we orient our lives:

            Extraversion vs. Introversion

        How we prefer to gather information:

            Sensing vs. iNtuition

        How we prefer to make decisions:

            Thinking vs. Feeling

        Which sort of lifestyle we prefer:

            Judging vs. Perceiving

    These 16 types correspond to the psychological types that Carl
    Jung described in _Psychological Types_.  They also corresond to
    the 16 Myers-Briggs types measured by the Myers-Briggs Type
    Indicator.

    The DDLI asks you a series of multiple choice questions and
    calculates its results from your answers.  It asks you to rank
    each of your answers on a scale from 1 to 7. It also asks you
    questions on other sets of preferences that are supposed to match
    various combinations of the above four sets. This is so it
    provides a check on itself, as it can be fallible.

    The DDLI comes with extensive support material.  Included are full
    length descriptions of each one of the 16 types, the "Personality
    Type Summary" by Jon Noring, and my own description of the Life
    Pattern personality model.

NEW FEATURES

    Using the data I have collected from people, I have changed (and
    hopefully improved) the questions.  I think the DDLI will be
    somewhat more reliable now.

    When you quit the DDLI with option 6, it will give you the
    opportunity to save your answers before you quit.

    Added to the text that the DDLI displays.

    The DDLI now writes extra text to the raw scores file, and it can
    read raw scores files with extra text at the beginning.

    The DDLI now has you indicate your type by selecting a number
    instead of by writing it in.

    The raw scores file takes up fewer lines, so that it is easier to
    send across the Fidonet.
