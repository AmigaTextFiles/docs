DESCRIPTION

	Allows people to play Stratego, a popular board game, over a
	serial connection.  Gameplay can take place over a null modem
	connection, Modem, or while logged onto a remote host using
	Internet Relay Chat, talk, or write.  The program is unique in
	that it uses a robust packet sending algorithm which transmits
 	and receives packets using standard printable characters, and
 	filters out screen escape codes.  During game play, messages
 	may be sent, and optionally played through the SPEAK: device. 
	Be sure to skim the documentation before trying the program.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	May be distributed freely.  I would be honored to have this
	placed on a Fish Disk.  The program may not be sold to make
	a profit.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Runs on any OS.  Uses the SPEAK: device, but this is not a
	requirement.
 
DIRECTORY

 	Found on aminet sites in the directory:
 	pub/aminet/game/2play
 
FILENAME

	SerStratego.lha		48856 bytes long.

PRICE
