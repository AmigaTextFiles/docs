DESCRIPTION

     With this program you can use wireless tablets manufactured by Wacom
     with the Amiga.

     The tablet is connected to the serial port of your Amiga (Multi-IO
     boards are also supported.) The driver is suitable for tablets of the
     SD and the UD series. Both the pressure sensitive and the non-pressure
     sensitive mode are supported.

     The driver enables you to control the Amiga mouse pointer with your
     tablet. Appropriate buttons on the tablet's input devices are mapped
     to the normal mousebuttons. Therefore the driver can be used with
     (almost) any program.

     Also, a software interface is implemented which enables you to map
     unused buttons in your own applications and/or to use the pressure
     and coordinates in your own applications. Some sample source in C is
     included to demonstrate the usage of the interface.

     Under AmigaOS 3.0 or better the tabletdata is also directly used by
     Intuition and passed to every window where an application can use it.
     A small program with source in C is included to show how an application
     can get the data from intuition using the Commodore tabletinterface.

     Driver settings are made using an intuitive graphics user interface
     (GUI). Also a German catalog file is supplied which you can use with
     at least Workbench 2.1.

     German and english documentation included.


NEW FEATURES

     * Implementation of the AmigaOS 3.0 tablethandling.
       Every Intiutionwindow can now receive pressure data directly
       from Intuition making your application independent from the
       used tablet driver. This is only used when AmigaOS 3.0 or better
       is available in the system. On pre-3.0 systems the AmigaOS 2.0
       tabletinterface is used.

     * Adapted to the actual Wacom IV specification from april 1994.

     * simplified serial communication in order to improve compatibility
       to MultiIO boards which are not having the full commandset implemen-
       ted.

     * minor optimizations in the whole program.

     * exampleprogram with source included to show usage of the
       AmigaOS 3.0 tablethandling.

     * new compiled with SAS/C V6.51.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     * At least Kickstart and Workbench 2.04.
       On 2.1 or 3.x you can use german localization.

     * Wacom tablet of the SD or UD series.
