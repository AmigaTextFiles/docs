TITLE

     avmNfax (Advanced Voice Mail and Fax)

VERSION

     1.33

COMPANY

     SoftWorx

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

     Use your ZyXEL, LineLink, Dolphin, or Rockwell based voice modem
     (Supras are *not yet* supported) for voicemail or as a simple
     answering machine with fax capabilities.

     This version includes EFax, which handles Class 1 and Class 2
     modems.  This fax capability can be used even if you don't have a
     voice-capable modem (e.g.  Supra LC).  Of course, if you do have
     a voice capable modem, then you get faxing and voicemail
     capabilities.
     
     If you already own GPFax or TrapFax, you can still use those
     programs in lieu of EFax.

NEW FEATURES

     There are too many new features to list here.  The most prominent
     one is the inclusion of EFax with the archive.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     o  Hard disk,
     o  a voice capable modem (ZyXEL with 5.02 ROMs or greater),
        a LineLink 144e, an MTD Dolphin, or a Rockwell based
        voice modem (such as the Zoom 14.4v)
     o  or, if you don't have a voice capable modem but have a
        Class 1 or Class 2 fax modem (i.e. Supra LC,
        Supra 14.4), you can still use the fax capabilities.
     o  2.04 AmigaDOS or greater,
     o  MUI 1.4 or greater,
