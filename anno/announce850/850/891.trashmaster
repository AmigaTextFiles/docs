TITLE

	Trashmaster17.lha

VERSION

	1.7

AUTHOR

	Aric R Caley.

	Email: dances@qedbbs.com

DESCRIPTION

	Workbench 2.x AppIcon to "drag-and-drop" delete files.
	Deletes any files and/or directories (and the files in them)
	who's icon(s) are dropped into the Trashmaster AppIcon.  Files
	can be deleted interactively, with confirmation on each file
	(delete, all, abort, and skip).  Disks will be formatted.

	Unlike other similar programs (the ones I have seen, anyway),
	Trashmaster keeps Workbench "in sync".  "Fake" icons generated
	dynamically by Workbench (via the "Show >> All Files" menu
	option) will be removed from the display.  Any open directory
	windows are closed when that directory is deleted.

NEW FEATURES

	Localized strings.  Swedish, Polish, German, Dutch and
	Norwegian and Italian catalogs.  Documentation in English;
	other languages forthcoming (probably in a separate archive).

	In certain instances, icon flickering has been eliminated or
	reduced.

	Options can be specified from the command line in addition to
	the Tooltypes.

	It's a commodity now (no big deal though).  Under 3.0 you can
	pop up the Workbench info requester to change the Tooltypes.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Requires 2.04 and above of Workbench.  V2.1 required for
	localization.

HOST NAME

	wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4)

	(and all aminet mirrors)

DIRECTORY

	aminet/os20/wb

FILE NAMES

	Trashmaster17.lha
	Trashmaster17.readme

PRICE

	Shareware ($10), or other physical or monetary donations.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	Freely distributable but Copyright (c) 1994 by Aric R Caley.
	Donations welcome, however.
