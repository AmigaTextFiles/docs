TITLE: 
     
     DOZER

VERSION: 

     This is the 10 level demo version, now available by FTP.

COMPANY: 

     FastRam Design,
     24 Montague Road, Cambridge, CB4 1BX, England.

AUTHOR: 

     Design and graphics by Dominic Camus,
     Code by John Reynolds.
     This announcement posted by David Ingram
     ( dmi1000@phx.cam.ac.uk ) of FastRam Design.

DESCRIPTION: 

     Dozer is an original puzzle game for the Amiga, in which you
     drive a bulldozer around a huge castle.  The object of the game
     is to catch the monster which is loose inside the castle, by
     re-arranging the castle interior to guide it into a trap.

     The game is designed primarily to be as playable as possible, and
     has a very wide spread of levels from fast and easy to very
     puzzling indeed.  The Dozer Demo also features various control
     methods, easy hard-disk installation, graphical level selector,
     passwords, an automatic map and a turbo mode.  There are 10
     levels in the demo, and the last few in particular should keep
     you busy for quite a while.
     
     The complete version of the game can be ordered from FastRam
     Design, and includes over 100 levels and many more features.

REQUIREMENTS: 

     Any PAL Amiga with at least 1 Mb of RAM.

HOST NAME: 

     Any Aminet site, for example -

     UK     ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk
     Sweden ftp.luth.se      130.240.16.3
     USA    ftp.wustl.edu    128.252.135.4

DIRECTORY: 

     /pub/aminet/game/think

FILE NAMES:

     Dozer.lha    ( 159702 bytes )
     Dozer.readme (   7755 bytes )

DISTRIBUTABILITY: 

     This version of Dozer is free.  You may distribute it wherever
     you like, provided you include all the files in an unmodified
     form.  Help us to spread our game by uploading it to other
     networks or public domain disk collections !

PRICE: 

     A charge of 5 Pounds in the UK or 8 Pounds elsewhere is made for
     the full version of the game.  Ordering information is included
     with the demo version, and we encourage you to try the demo and
     find out what Dozer is all about for yourself.

OTHER: 

     This game was originally created over a period of two years by
     the developers, FastRam Design, for a commercial release.  The
     demo version which appeared on the coverdisk of Amiga Format
     magazine recently in the UK is the same as this demo.  Sadly,
     however, due to a lack of demand for puzzle games ( even good
     ones ), Dozer was never published.  As a result, FastRam have
     agreed to make the demo available on Aminet and to provide the
     upgrade offer mentioned above, by which you can order the
     complete game.
