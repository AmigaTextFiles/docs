TITLE

     EyeCandy01 

VERSION

     This is version 01.  Renamed from SpiroDraw06 and added two new
     design generator functions, "YarnBall" and "CircleStar".

COMPANY

     No company, just an AMINET upload by "yours truly".

AUTHOR

     EyeCandy01 was written by me, Chuck Kenney.  My particulars
     (address, etc.) are included in the user document in the archive.

DESCRIPTION

     EyeCandy01 generates various "eye candy" designs.  Currently these
     are:  "SpiroDraw", "YarnBall" and "CircleStar".  Future releases
     of EyeCandy will likely have more designs programmed in.  "SpiroDraw"
     simulates the Wheels-and-Rings-and-Pens spirograph drawing toy.
     "YarnBall" ... well generates designs that look like balls of yarn.
     "CricleStar" generates designs that look like 3D checkerboard stars.
     "EyeCandy" Allows the user to specify differentvalues for many of
     the parameters which dictate the sizes and shapes of the designs -
     "Drawing Wheels, Drawing Rings", number of"YarnBall" spokes, etc.
     The use of a computer to generate the SpiroDraw designs actually
     enhances some of the capabilities!  "EyeCandy01" is all mouse-driven
     (MENUs, GADGETs, etc.).  It is a fun _and_ addictive program!

     EyeCandy01.lha also contains a very nice little freely distributable
     "screen-to-IFF" saver utility by Preben Nielsen (thanks, Preben) so
     that "EyeCandy" designs can be imported into "paint" programs.

     "EyeCandy" is shareware but does not nag the user in any way (except
     if the user selects the "About" MENU item) and all features are fully
     functional.

NEW FEATURES

     "EyeCandy01" is the follow-on to "SpiroDraw06".  It was renamed to
     better reflect its new additional design-generation capabilities.
     So far, these new designs include "YarnBall" and "CircleStar".
     Other minor enhancements (compared to SpiroDraw06) were implemented
     in the "SpiroDraw" and the user interface functions in general.  

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     There are no special requirements that I know of.
     EyeCandy01 has been tested on an Amiga 2000HD (OS 2.1)
     and an Amiga 1000 (OS 1.3).

HOST NAME

     EyeCandy01.lha has just been uploaded to the AMINET site,
     ftp.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20) and should soon be available on
     all other AMINET sites.

DIRECTORY

     EyeCandy01.lha and EyeCandy01.readme reside in the
     "aminet/gfx/misc" directory. 

FILE NAMES

     EyeCandy01.lha is 66,597 bytes long.

PRICE

     The asking shareware price is the amount sent to me by my first
     shareware contributor.  This requested shareware fee is $5.00 (US).  

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is freely distributable as long as the documentation
     accompanies the program but is a copyrighted (1994) shareware
     program by me, Chuck Kenney.

OTHER

     EyeCandy01, and other programs in progress are coming out of my
     basement as a result of the availability of a truly wonderful
     "BASIC-but-much-more!" compiler, "ACE" by David Benn.  I would
     like to sincerely thank Mr. Benn for renewing my enthusiasm in
     programming and for making it possible for me to make my programs
     available to more than just my friends and immediately family!
