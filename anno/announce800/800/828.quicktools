DESCRIPTION

     QuickTools  is the tool package for the harddisk owner
     who is tired of writing long pathnames when changing
     directories and who doesn't have the time to search
     for files manually. QuickTools consists mainly of four
     small utilities and a library where the search
     routines are. All search routines support standard
     AmigaDOS wildcards.

     Qcd:
     With this you can change directory by only writing
     enough of the directory name to identify it. The
     directory can be anywhere on the harddisk. If more 
     than one directory maches the search word a requester
     will pop up and you can select the directory you want
     to change to.

     If  you  want  to  change  to  a  directory  with  the

     It's several ways to do it: You can write: 
     'Qcd Harddisk0:Work/SAS/SelfMade/QuickCD' (the hard way)
     Or just: 'Qcd qui'   (the fast way)

     QFind:
     Search for files, scans through the database in just a 
     few seconds.

     QPop:
     A commodity for file and directory searching.

     QMan:
     A documentation finding utility which uses the database 
     to locate the documentation file for a specified program.
     The file found can be shown with a configurable viewer. 
     These programs are a must for any serious hard-disk user!!
