TITLE

	FindETag - Integrate TurboText and GNU ETags

VERSION

	1.03

AUTHOR

	Daniel J. Barrett

DESCRIPTION

	This ARexx script interfaces TurboText with GNU ETags, allowing you
to locate function definitions in your C programs automatically.  If you
know what "ctags" is on UNIX, "etags" is basically the same thing.  If you
have never used either of these programs, NOW IS THE TIME!  Any C programmer
will *LOVE* these programs.  Trust me.  Here is an example.

	Imagine that you are working on a large program with many files.
In your code, you have the line:

		x = MyFunction(a, b, c);

Suppose you want to see the definition of MyFunction().  What do you do?
Well, you try to remember which file has MyFunction, load it into the
editor, search for "MyFunction", and eventually you find it.

	LoadETag makes this 1000 times easier!  With LoadETag, just place
your cursor on the word "MyFunction" in the function call above, and
press one key.  BOOM!  The file containing MyFunction is automatically
loaded, and the cursor is positioned right on the function definition.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	TurboText 1.03 or higher.
	GNU ETags (available on all Fred Fish "FreshFish" CD-ROM's)
	ARexx.
