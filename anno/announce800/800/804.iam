              Intangible Assets Manufacturing Continues
                    Strong Support of Amiga Users

Drexel Hill, PA (4 May, 1994)  Intangible Assets Manufacturing, a
software development and consulting company in the Amiga marketplace,
announces that Commodore Electronics Ltd.'s voluntary liquidation in
no way affects IAM's commitment to the Amiga.

IAM's president, Dale L. Larson, stated, "The Amiga is important.
Commodore is irrelevant."

Larson elaborated, "Even if Commodore disappears and no one else picks up
production of the Amiga, there is a large existing base of machines which
will remain valuable for many years.  We intend to help current Amiga
users to get the most from those systems. Further, we believe that
licensing agreements or other arrangements will likely allow production
of new machines by someone."

IAM's currently available products include Amiga Envoy -- an Amiga
peer-to-peer networking package.  IAM expects to make an announcement of
a new Amiga book soon, and has other major projects in the works for the
coming year.
