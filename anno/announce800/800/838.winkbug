TITLE

     WinkBug

DESCRIPTION

   "Debugging Code was Never Easier"

   WinkBug(tm) consists of a small 2-line by 16-character LCD display that
   can help you to debug programs more rapidly and to be more productive.
   It comes installed in a 3-position parallel port switchbox for added
   convenience.  All 25 positions are switched.

   As you may be aware, certain types of programs do not lend themselves
   very well to the use of a debugger.  The program may be automatically
   loaded by the operating system, and not give you any way to "attach"
   the debugger.  Even if this is not a concern, the debugging software
   itself may change the environment enough so that the program no longer
   behaves in quite the same way as when the debugger isn't present.

   WinkBug will solve these problems by virtue of being almost
   "invisible" to both the OS and the program being tested.  Your program
   may write debugging messages to the WinkBug display by means of
   software contained in the wink.library.  There is even a built-in
   beeper that responds to the ASCII BEL character.  The display speed is
   fast enough for all but the most time critical code:  40us/char.  The
   code in wink.library is very tight as well.

   WinkBug will be useful in debugging device drivers, libraries,
   handlers, interrupt service routines, and many more difficult pieces
   of code.  Utilities are provided so that you may redirect Software
   Alerts to WinkBug or watch task-switching in real time (only 7%
   overhead).  Enforcer support is also provided.

   Although there are debugging applications where a full ANSI terminal
   is indispensable, you will find that for many uses, WinkBug will
   function just as well, with the additional benefits of taking up
   almost no space and drawing a negligible 10mw of power.

   Even if a full ANSI terminal is available where you normally work, you
   will find WinkBug indispensable for debugging code in the field.  It
   is even possible to build hooks for WinkBug display routines into
   your code, along with special access codes.  You could then send the
   WinkBug hardware to a customer a continent away for remote debugging.
   Imagine the possibilities!
