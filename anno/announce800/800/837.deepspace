TITLE

         DeepSpace

VERSION

         V1.2

AUTHOR

         Todd & Darrell Neumiller
         (Darrell Neumiller - neumille@hpspkla.spk.hp.com)

DESCRIPTION

      DeepSpace is a Shell/CLI multi-player, multi-node BBS, space roll 
      playing game.  Real time fighting, chat and etc.  You can have up to
      20 players playing the game at the same time.  Only 10 players are
      allowed to play a game in the unregisted version, and up to 100 
      users after DeepSpace has been registered.  If your BBS can't run
      a Shell/CLI door, we have a Paragon door version too.  You can also
      play DeepSpace locally from a SHELL while other players are playing
      the game at the same time.

FEATURES

      - Documentation is in Amigaguide format.
      - Easy to use installation program.
      - On-line Editor for players, aliens and planets.
      - Up to 50 definable names for Alien races can be used in a game.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

      We haven't finished everything we originally set out to accomplish 
      with DeepSpace.  Here is a few of our version 2 enhancement ideas.

      - If you go through the BlackHole when it's un-stable (and make it 
        through) you will see the planet 'Praxis'.  The players will be
        able beam to/from the planet.  Hostile Mutants, Aliens and on-line 
        players could be on the planet.  Different objects could be obtained
        there, Weapons, Crystals, and Better Scanners? ect..  An example 
        that's being considered: A weapon that can be left at the DeepSpace
        port, which could be programmed, via DNA scan, to detonate when a 
        certain Explorer arrives at the port.
      - Gambling at the DeepSpace port.  Possibly against other on-line
        players as well.
      - The Shap Shifter could be anywhere!  Could be selling illegal
        items from planet Praxis?  Could end up in jail with no way out,
        or will there be a way out?
