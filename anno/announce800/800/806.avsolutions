We've been an Amiga-only reseller for some years now.  That may change
within the next year, particularly if some of our larger products must move
to the PC (Personal Animation Recorder, SCALA?, Toaster???).

I doubt we will remain Amiga-only, but I certainly plan to continue to
support the Amiga.  I've been doing a good business in used hardware over
the last 6 months, and I expect that to continue.

My name is Barry Kryshka, and I am one of the two owners of this business.
