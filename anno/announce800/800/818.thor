    Main programming:
      Petter Nilsen    -  petter@pnilsen.adsp.sub.org
      Eivind Nordseth  -  eivindno@idt.unit.no

DESCRIPTION

    THOR is an advanced offline reader system developed for
    saving online time while connected to BBS systems, for
    building and maintaining a database of the messages from
    the boards, for supporting a wide range of terminal
    programs and BBS systems (and simple implementation of
    new systems) and for the simple pleasure of creating
    possibly the best offline-reader yet to be seen on the Amiga.

    Some of the main features:
    o Support for multiple offline formats, including QWK,
      HIPPO, ABBS and MBBS.  
    o Flexible message database system with true history,
      message marking, searching and threading.
    o User name database with a fast look-up table of names.
    o Powerful internal full screen editor with macro, ARexx  
      and PGP support.
    o Extensive ARexx support with several included scripts.
    o Support for ISO, IBM, NO7, SF7 and DE7 international
      character sets.
    o Supports new 3.0 features (newlook menus, memory pools,
      interleaved screens, 24 bit palette,....)
    o Copyback and write-through file buffering system.
    o Powerful purging system with Global settings for days
      and/or number of messages to keep. Each conference can
      also have separate settings.
    o Everything can be controlled from the keyboard.
    o All events (orders) can be edited freely after having been
      entered.
    o LogReader, a powerful logfile analyzer program for NComm,
      Term and UUCP logs is included. LogReader is made by
      Torge Hjorth of Nocturnal Holiday Software.

    already installed. THOR12.lha is available in the

    Some of the changes from release 1.06 - 1.21::
