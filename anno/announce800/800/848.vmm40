AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

     VMM40 is a virtual memory manager for any Amiga with
     a 68040 processor. Up to 128 MB of virtual memory is 
     available to all processes just like physical memory.
     Paging can be done either to a dedicated partition or
     to a file. The paging buffer can be specified as a
     fixed amount or dynamically allocated.

NEW FEATURES

     Advanced section for per-task settings of memory allocation.
     Preferences now changeable during runtime.
     Exit is now possible even if there's still virtual memory allocated.
     Statistics window is now "zoomable".
     Fixed problems with DMA harddisk controllers.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     VMM40 needs at least OS2.0 and a real 68040 (no LC or EC)
     to work. At least 2 MB of RAM and a harddisk are recommended 
     although not definitely needed.
