DESCRIPTION

     Yak stands for "Yet Another Kommodity" (never was any good at
     spelling), and is a mouse/window manipulation program along the
     same lines as DMouse, KCommodity and lets you activating screens 
     and windows, inserting localized date. It offers more than the 
     AutoPoint Commodore standard commodity and it's only 30 Kb long!


FEATURES

     A lot! Among them : AutoActivation of windows, extensible hotkey 
     system (like FKey's) with a lot of different actions
     
NEW FEATURES

     This is an update to Yak 1.57, it fixes 5 bugs and introduce some
     new features :

     * Now when alt key is pressed, Yak doesn't blank the mouse 
       so that accessing menus via keyboard is easier.
     * Now compilable with both SAS C 6.51 and with DICE !
     * Black border for screens (available only in 3.0+).
     * New layout of the GUI.
     * Palette title localized.
     * Screen patterns now use screens default titles instead of 
       current screen title. It makes easier writing patterns for 
       screens such as workbench or BrowserII ones.
     * New hotkey to set default public screen.
     * New way to automatically define a hotkey by hitting it.
     * Now Yak can open only one palette per screen.
