Subject: Contents of disks 976-1000
Status: R

Here is a list of the contents of disks 976-1000.  Future disks in the
library will be organized by someone else.  More details should be
forthcoming in the next few weeks.

-Fred

==========================  Contents of Disk 976  ==========================

CLIExchange	A 592 byte CLI replacement for the standard CBM Exchange
		utility.  The only difference is that Exchange has a graph-
		ical user interface while CLIExchange has been designed to
		be called from CLI so it can be used within scripts, menus,
		docks or hotkeys.  You need at least 2.04 system release.
		C source included.
		Author:  Gakl Marziou

DieserZug	A nicely done WorkBench "Worms" type game, where the object
		is to gobble up pieces making yourself longer and longer,
		while avoiding running into the walls or your "tail".
		Features 3 different speeds, high score list, pause and
		help keys.  Version 1.2a, binary only.
		Author:  Juha Vehvildinen

ITF		Amiga port of ITF4.01.  ITF stands for "Infocom Task Force".
		There have been several ports of Infocom interpreters to the
		Amiga, but none of this program.  The interpreter supports
		v1, v2, v3 (Zork1 to Stationfall), v4 (Trinity, Bureaucracy,
		etc.) and v5 (Sherlock, Beyond Zork etc.) games.  This is
		more than any other freely distributable interpreter.  With
		this interpreter you can play ALL the games in the LTOI2
		package for the IBM PC, by copying the datafiles with Cross-
		DOS or similar, then just running this interpreter.  Re-
		quires OS 2.0+.  Binary only.
		Author:  InfoTaskForce, amiga port by David Kinder

PCal		Creates a very nice looking postscript calendar.  By
		default, PCal simply prints an empty calendar.  Its
		real power is in its ability to place ``events'' in
		appropriate days on the calendar, thus allowing the
		user to create personalized calendars.  This is achieved
		through the use of a "calendar.dat" file that has
		extraordinary flexibility.
		Author:  Patrick Wood, Joe Brownlee, Andy Fyfe, et al.

==========================  Contents of Disk 976  ==========================

Replex		REPLace EXecutable.  This handy patch substitutes program
		names that are about to be executed, e.g. if an icon
		default tool specifies ":c/MuchMore" and you prefer to use 
		"c:TextRead", you can have it defined as such.  You won't
		have to change the icon.  This version also has a "catch"
		option to automatically ask for a substitute if a tool
		wasn't found.  Replex has a font sensitive intuition inter-
		face, a snapshot option and an unlimited number of defini-
		tions, but requires AmigaDOS v2.04 or later.  This is
		version 2.0, an update to version 1.0 on disk number 791.
		Binary only, shareware.
		Author:  ASWare, by Ekke Verheul

UChess		A powerful version of the program GnuChess version 4 for the
		Amiga.  Plays a very strong game of chess.  Code has been
		rewritten and data structures reorganized for optimal effi-
		ciency on 32 bit 68020 and better Amiga systems.  Fully
		multitasking, automatically detects and supports 640X480X256
		color AGA mode machines, and does not at any time BUSY wait.
		Requires a 68020/030/040 based Amiga computer system with
		AmigaOS 2.04 or later and 4 Meg of ram minimum.  Special "L"
		version optimized for 68040 and requires 10 Meg of ram mini-
		mum.  Supports a variety of standard features such as load,
		save, edit board, autoplay, swap sides, force move, undo,
		time limits, hints, show thinking, and a supervisor mode
		that will allow two humans to play with the computer acting
		as a "supervisor".  Version 2.78, includes source.  This
		version supports third party graphics cards.  This is part
		1 of a 2 part distribution.  Part 1 contains the executables
		and documentation, part 2 contains the source and can be
		found on disk 977.
		Author:  FSF, Amiga Port by Roger Uzun

==========================  Contents of Disk 977  ==========================

Forth		An update to the MVP-Forth directory on AmigaLibDisk #9.
		Provided is an improved, faster screen editor which uses
		the keyboard cursor keys, backspace and delete keys and
		function keys which allow fast moving thru the screens,
		pasting from PAD and the printing of screen, triad or PAD
		to the printer port prt:.  F1 is the OOPs key.  Control
		Keys give fast editing.  The control keys and Function
		keys can be reprogrammed by the user if desired.  Runs on
		Amiga 1000 and 3000.  Probably on Amiga 500 and 2000
		(Untested).
		Author:  Fantasia Systems, Inc.  Updated by John Bos

KingCON		A console-handler that optionally replaces the standard
		'CON:' and 'RAW:' devices.  It is 100% compatible, but adds
		some VERY useful features, such as: Filename-completion
		(TAB-expansion); A review-buffer; Intuition menus; Jump 
		scroll (FAAST output!).  Cursor-positioning using the mouse;
		MC68020-optimized version; And more... Version 1.1,
		requires OS2.x, binary only. 
		Author:  David Larsson

LibraryGuide	An AmigaGuide file that lists about 210 different PD,
		Shareware and Commercial "libraries" often found in the
		LIBS: directory and a simple description of their purpose,
		version info, where to get them, etc.  May help you
		determine whether or not you actually "need" some of these
		spaceconsuming things.  Version 1.1, an update to version
		1.0 on disk number 942.
		Author:  Dan Elgaard

UChess		A powerful version of the program GnuChess version 4 for the
		Amiga.  Plays a very strong game of chess.  Code has been
		rewritten and data structures reorganized for optimal effi-
		ciency on 32 bit 68020 and better Amiga systems.  Fully
		multitasking, automatically detects and supports 640X480X256

==========================  Contents of Disk 978  ==========================

MakeCat		Makes creating locale catalog files easy.  It makes catalog
		files from ASCII files that contain the strings and ID
		numbers that should be included in the catalog.  Reverse
		operation is also possible with UnMakeCat, so that existing
		catalogs can easily be translated or changed.  Includes
		example of how to use locale.library to read catalogs.
		Version 38.02, requires AmigaDOS2.1 or later.  Binary only,
		freeware.
		Author:  Camiel Rouweler

Man		A simple MAN command, known from UNIX systems.  The advan-
		tage is, that it recognizes .guide files to be AmigaGuide)
		documents.  MAN then uses a different viewer in order to
		display the AmigaGuide document.  Furthermore MAN recog-
		nizes TeX-DVI files as well, using a different viewer to
		display them.  You may configure MAN using environment
		variables.  Version 1.11a, public domain, includes source.
		Author:  Kai Iske

MiserPrint	A print utility that puts up to 8 normal pages of text on
		one sheet of paper.  You are able to save paper and time.

		Gothic) of the HP-Deskjet printers.  Version 1.11, an update
		to version 1.0 on disk number 928.  Requires Kickstart 2.04
		or higher, binary only, giftware.
		Author:  Heinz-Guenter Boettger

MouseClock	A hardware/software project of a low cost, very small
		external battery backed up clock calendar for all Amigas

		mouse port #2.  Version 1.22, shareware, includes source.
		Author:  Adriano De Minicis

NewEdit		A commodity, that patches all string gadgets of the system
		(better:  it installs a global edithook for the string gad-
		gets).  Beside some new edit functions, NewEdit supports
		copy and paste of text between the clipboard and string gad-
		gets.  Version 1.8, includes source.
		Author:  Uwe Roehm, based on work by Oliver Wagner

RachelValley	A 256 colour and 16 colour IFF picture of "Rachel Raccoon"
		resting after a hike.  These pictures are suitable as Work-
		bench backdrops with the right software.
		Author:  Les Dietz

==========================  Contents of Disk 979  ==========================

KeysPlease	Displays a nice rendition of the Amiga keyboard and allows
		you to either click on a key-gadget or press a key to find
		that key's rawcode or ascii value.  Codes are displayed in
		both decimal and hexidecimal.  Version 1.3, binary only.
		Author:  Brian Koetting

MouseAideDEMO	A DEMO version of a "Mouse" utility which has all the stan-
		dard functions:  Acceleration with threshold, window and
		screen cycling by mouse and keyboard, mouse and screen
		blanking, mouse and Auto-Activation, user "hot key" command,
		Keyboard "String" macros, etc.  But also has many functions
		other "Mouse" programs do NOT, such as: Shell-Cycling, Key
		Clicking, Mouse Port switching KeyClosing, Multi-Icon-
		Select with Mouse, Middle Mouse Button Windowing, EZ-Date
		generation, Workbench to the front function, Ez-Dragging
		and Sizing, Key zipping, Freezing Mouse and Keyboard of all

		intuition interface (that functions in 1.3) and the ability
		to function correctly in all the new screen modes!  Written
		in assembly for efficiency in size and CPU usage.  Version
		v9.81a, an update to version v9.69a on disk 892.  Binary
		only.
		Author:  Thomas J. Czarnecki

QMouse		An unusually small and feature-packed "mouse utility".  Was
		inspired by, but not derived from, the original QMouse by
		Lyman Epp.  Features include automatic window activation
		(like WindX), top-line blanking for A3000/A2320 users,
		system friendly mouse blanking, mouse acceleration and/or
		threshold, "Pop-CLI", click-to-front/back, "SunMouse",
		"NoClick", "WildStar", Northgate key remapping, and more.
		Requires Kickstart 2.0, but is not a commodity.  Only 3K.
		Version 2.90, an update to version 2.30 on disk 802.
		Public domain, assembly source included.
		Author:  Dan Babcock

SnoopLibs	A clever tool for developers and others with a more-than-
		usual interest in the functioning of tasks, to patch and
		monitor any library-function-call from a certain task.  The
		output-formats can be changed and the results can be printed
		to a window, a file or printer.  Only for Kickstart v37(+).
		Includes six ".sl" files (library data) and a tool (fd2sl +
		source) to add more.  Comes with an AmigaGuide manual.  This
		is version 0.9, first public release.
		Author:  ASWare, by Ekke Verheul & Dirk Reisig

StartWindow	Configurable WorkBench "launch-program" type utility.  Opens
		a zipwindow that when activated, presents the user with a
		listwindow of pre-configured commands.  Ideal for those
		commands used infrequently enough that you don't want a
		dock-icon cluttering up your WorkBench for.   Includes
		source for both English and German versions.
		Author:  Heinz Reinert

SuperDuper	An exciting, high-speed disk copier and formatter.  Typical
		timings are 99s for a disk-to-disk verified copy, or 38s for
		a four disk non-verified format.  Also available are buffer-
		ing in RAM, on a hard disk image file or on any sector-
		based Amiga device, like RAD:, VDO:, FMS:, etc.  Real-time
		compression using the Xpk standard allows to copy in one
		pass most disks on 1M Amigas, especially in conjunction
		with a special utility which "hides" external drives to the
		system (but not to SuperDuper).  Bells and whistles include
		high density floppy support, voice, automatic date incre-
		ment, a list of the disks copied, and automatic start of
		operations based on disk insertion/ejection sensing.  Works
		on any Amiga under 2.0 and beyond.  The changes from version
		3.0 are mainly bug fixes and some new features, namely
		optional simple refresh windows, the new NoStartup switch,
		automatic source disk reads, and better window management.
		Version 3.1, an update to version 3.0 on disk number 903.
		Binary only, freeware.
		Author:  Sebastiano Vigna

==========================  Contents of Disk 980  ==========================

APipe		The `APipe-Handler' allows you to add the `APIPE:' DOS
		device to your system.  This device acts as a pipe between
		two programs, but in a different manner than the standard
		`PIPE:' device does.  This handler interprets the text
		after the `APIPE:' prefix as a command line to execute,
		and the process/command which opens the file indicated by
		the mention of `APIPE:' can now read the standard output
		or write the standard input of the program indicated by
		the command line depending on whether the `APIPE:' file
		was opened for reading or writing, respectively.   Thus,
		the opening an `APIPE:' file is analogous to the UNIX
		`popen()' call, but it is more widely available to the
		user.  Complete source is included and can be used as an
		example of a handler.  Version 37.5, an update to version
		37.4 on disk number 783.
		Author:  Per Bojsen

HWGRCS		A 3 part distribution of an RCS 5.6.0.1 port to the Amiga,
		currently at patch level 8.  Part 1 contains the binaries
		and documentation in AmigaGuide and "man" format, part 2
		contains the source code to RCS, and part 3 contains the
		source code and binaries for patch and diffutils.  The
		Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of
		text files.  RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
		identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
		text that is revised frequently, for example: programs, doc-
		umentation, graphics, papers, form letters, etc.  Included
		are RCS 5.6, GNU diffutils 2.6 and an LP utility to support
		paged diff outputs.  Part 1 on disk 980, part 2 is on disk
		981, and part 3 is on disk 982.
		Author:  Walter Tichy, Paul Eggert, Heinz Wrobel

==========================  Contents of Disk 981  ==========================

BootUte		A utility to enable more older software work on the Amiga
		1200 and 4000 series, It is also useful for users with
		accelerators.  Requires kickstart 2 or above.  Binary only.
		Author:  Paul Toyne

CloudsAGA	This program creates random clouds which you might use in
		your paint program, as a texture in a ray tracing program
		or as a background for your workbench.  Uses all AGA res-
		olutions.  Now requires Workbench 2.0 or higher.  This is
		version 1.05, a complete rewrite in OBERON-2.  Removed more
		Enforcer hits.  Public domain, includes source in OBERON-2.
		Author:  Daniel Amor

ConPaste	ConPaste is a 2.0 commodity that allows you to paste clipped
		text into anything.  Paste into string gadgets.  Paste into
		any text application.  In this new version, ConPaste drops
		its priority by 1 when pasting text to allow sufficient
		processor time for the receiving task or window to process
		the text.  When you press a user-defined key or key combina-
		tion, ConPaste will take any FTXT found in clipboard unit 0,
		convert the text back into input events, and send the input
		events into the input stream.  The output will go to the
		active window or string gadget.  This is version 37.25, an
		update to the version distributed with ClipWindow by Jim
		Harvey, on disk 935.
		Author:  Carolyn Scheppner

HuntWindows	Starting with 2.0 you can make screens bigger than the
		visual size of your monitor.  On a double-size workbench,
		catching windows like requesters etc. can be quite annoying
		at times.  This little utility hangs itself on the VBI
		(Vertical Blank Interrupt) to find out which window is
		being activated and moves the screen to show the window in
		full view.  Version 3.3, an update to version 1.4 on disk
		number 774.  Includes source in assembler.
		Author:  Jvrg Bublath

HWGRCS		A 3 part distribution of an RCS 5.6.0.1 port to the Amiga,

==========================  Contents of Disk 982  ==========================

Bin2Hunk	Convert any binary file to an AmigaDOS hunk (or object file)
		that can be linked with your linker into your program.  This
		is most useful when you wish some form of data to be a part
		of your executable.  This data can be sound samples, images,
		text, or whatever.  Sports a ReadArgs() CLI interface, as
		well as a GadTools Intuition interface.  Memory type options
		include ANY, CHIP, and FAST.  Allows naming of your hunks.
		An optional data item containing the size of your data can
		also be specified.  Version 2.2, binary only.

		Author:  Walter Tichy, Paul Eggert, Heinz Wrobel

JoyRide		A commodity that provides an intuition front-end for joy-
		stick events.  This has some nice advantages for both users
		and programmers.  Basic features are a simple joystick
		interface, application shareable joystick events, and joy-
		stick events now pass through the input.device stream.
		Version 1.0, includes source to example test program.
		Author:  Brian Koetting

==========================  Contents of Disk 983  ==========================

CapsLockExt	A Commodity that extends the effect of the CapsLock
		key to every key on the keyboard, and allows the Shift
		key to temporarily cancel the CapsLock key.  This causes
		CapsLock to act like a SHIFT-lock key on a typewriter.
		Requires OS 2.04 or higher.  Version 1.0, includes source
		in assembly.
		Author:  Douglas Nelson

FastJPEG	FastJPEG is a fast JPEG picture viewer.  Besides being fast,
		it has many other advantages.  An important goal was to not
		trade quality for speed.  In fact, FastJPEG is both fast
		and has an excellent quality.  Most other JPEG viewers
		either produce ugly pictures, or need ages to perform the
		conversion to HAM mode.  Version 1.10, binary only.
		Author:  Christoph Feck

Harridan	A "Reminder" type program for your startup-sequence.  Each
		time you boot, Harridan will check your event list, if an
		event is 'due', Harridan opens a window to remind you.  If
		nothing is 'due', you're not bothered.  Designed under
		Amiga DOS 2.04 and takes advantage of all its easy to use
		features.  Version 1.0, binary only.
		Author:  Andy Maxey

TitleClock	A little commodity (about 4k) that throws up a clock in the
		top right corner of a screen's titlebar.  It may be set up
		to display itself on one or more screens without running
		multiple copies of the program.  It may also be set to
		follow your default public screen and also to always dis-
		play on the frontmost screen.  Version 3.3, an update to
		version 2.7 on disk number 949.  Freeware, includes source.
		Author:  Anders Hammarquist

Viewtek		A feature packed  Picture/Animation Viewer.  Shows most
		ILBM's (including 24-bit ILBM's), most Compuserve GIF for-
		mat images, most JFIF format JPEG images and most ANIM Op-5
		format animations, with support for different palettes for
		each frame.  Supports SHAM, CTBL, and PCHG images, full
		support of ECS/AGA display modes (ie. show 256 color GIF's
		directly, show 800x600 HAM animations, etc.).  Supports
		viewing contents of clipboard.  Iconifies to a Workbench
		AppIcon.  Includes versions for DCTV, EGS, IV-24, Retina,
		Firecracker, OpalVision, and Picasso.  Requires AmigaDOS
		2.04 or later.  Version 2.1, an update to version 1.05 on
		disk 903, binary only.
		Author:  Thomas Krehbiel

Yass		Yet Another Screen Selector, a commodity with several nice
		features such as: Completely controllable via keyboard (of
		course you can use your mouse, if you really want to); Shows
		Screens and Windows (option); Shows PublicScreenname or
		ScreenTitle (option); Ability to change the default Public
		screen; Opens window even on non-public screens (option).
		Font-sensitive; Resizeable window.  Version 2.0, an update
		to version 1.1 on disk number 946.  Binary only.
		Author:  Albert Schweizer

==========================  Contents of Disk 984  ==========================

AGIndex		Creates an index for AmigaGuide documents.  Indicies are
		sorted alphabetically and can be accessed (in AmigaGuide)
		by pressing the 'Index' button.  Index entries can be
		extracted from the source document using two different
		selecting methods: by reference or by declaration.
		Version 1.04, OS2.0 and higher, binary only, freeware
		Author:  Camiel Rouweler

ForceIcon	A utility mainly for users of CD-ROM drives.  Since one can
		not snapshot the position of a volume's icon, nor replace
		it by a user-defined one, this utility was written.  Force-
		Icon allows you to set the position of a disk's icon and/or
		replace it by a different image/icon which doesn't have to
		be a disk.info file.  All types of ".info" files may be
		selected.  GiftWare, Version 1.4, includes source.
		Author:  Kai Iske

IconToClip	A link between the Workbench and the Shell.  It adds an item
		to the Tools menu that, when selected, puts the name of any
		highlighted icon into the Clipboard, from which it can be
		pasted to the Shell or any other program that uses the Amiga
		Clipboard.  Has an option for writing the full pathname.
		Can handle multiple icon selections, writing the names in
		row or column format.  Can also be used as an AppWindow.
		Requires 2.04 or higher.  Version 1.0, includes source in
		assembly.
		Author:  Douglas Nelson

Imploder	The Imploder allows you to reduce the size of executable
		files while having them retain their full functionality.
		There are other "crunchers" or "packers" available for the
		Amiga, but none are as mindful of the complexities of your
		Amiga system as the Imploder.  In addition to this, its
		algorithms are more efficient, both in terms of speed, and
		size reduction.  Version 4.0, binary only.
		Author:  Albert-Jan Brouwer, Peter Struijk, Erwin Zwart,
			 Paul van der Valk

TWA		A commodity that remembers the last active window on any
		screen.  If screens are shuffled, the window is automatic-
		ally re-activated when that screen is brought to front.
		Version 1.4, an update to version 1.2 on disk number 874.
		This version fixes a problem which made it impossible to
		autoscroll on a screen which is partially in the back-
		ground.  Binary only.
		Author:  Matthias Scheler

WindowDaemon	Gives extended control to intuition windows and screens
		through HotKeys and Arexx.  Features:  Commodities Support;
		HotKey and Arexx support to manipulate the currently active
		window and screen.  Standard window controls are avalable
		such as Zip, Close, Size, ToFront, ToBack, NextScreen, etc.
		Able to close the parent window of a drawer when opened on
		"Workbench" if CONTROL is held down.  (Only available under
		kickstart V39 or higher); Specialized options to forcefully
		close windows and screens, and also to remove tasks that own
		the active window.  Version 1.6, binary only.
		Author:  David Swasbrook

==========================  Contents of Disk 985  ==========================

AGAiff		An IFF-to-RAW converter which can load all ILBM graphics
		supported by the AGA chipset.  It is also able to save 24
		Bit colors and sprites wider than 16 pixels.  Some features
		make this program quite attractive:  Coded as a Commodity;
		Coded completely in fast Assembler; Font-sensitive User
		Interface; <MANY> different save formats; Powerful ARexx-
		ort, supporting all stuff from the GUI; Runs even from
		small Assembler Workdisks if you don't need ARexx, Hotkey
		and all Displaymodes; ... and more !  Manual in AmigaGuide
		format.  Version 1.0, first release.  Requires OS 3.0 or
		later.
		Author:  Michael Krause

ILBMKiller	An IFF/AGA ILBM file viewer.  Has optional delete facility
		that allows you to sift though large collections of pic-
		tures, keeping only the ones you want.  Version 1.0, in-
		cludes source in Blitz Basic.
