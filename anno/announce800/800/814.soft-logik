Soft-Logik Publishing sells desktop publishing and graphic applications
for Amiga computers. Our current product lineup includes PageStream 2.2,
a full-featured desktop publishing program; Art Expression 1.0, a
drawing program; and, TypeSmith 2.0, a font editing and conversion
program.

Soft-Logik plans to release PageStream 3.0 in the near future.
Commodore's bankruptcy will not have an effect on our Amiga development.
We will continue to develop PageStream, and while we hope in the future
that it will be available for other platforms, we are too busy with our
Amiga products to consider that now. Remember that just because Commodore
is out of business does not mean that your Amiga will stop working. We
hope to release more Amiga products in the future.
