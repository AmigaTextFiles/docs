[ Press release substantially edited for this group. -Dan ]

May 1, 1994 - Cary, NC -  Obvious Implementations Coporation announces
DICE 3.0, by famous Amiga Gurus Matt Dillon (freeware author), Andy
Finkel (Amiga OS), John Toebes (Software Distillery) and Bryce Nesbitt
(Amiga OS & Enforcer).  This programming system is intended for use by
programmers at all levels of expertise.

        The DICE compiler is part of an integrated "system" of programming
tools designed to ease and speed creating programs for the Amiga.  For
beginners, DICE offers an intuitive visual approach to creating programs --
and numerous examples.  For programmers at all levels, DICE integrates
seamlessly with text editors, offering tools and information at the touch
of a button.

        The new DICE focuses on _productivity_.   The DICE system focuses
on getting code from keyboard to execution as quickly as possible.  It
gives programmers a quick development cycle and fast compile time
so they can try new things quickly.  It brings all help online to
save programmers from flipping through the manual.

DICE 3.0 includes:

        o Complete 450 page manual, including a section on avoiding
          the most common programming pitfalls.

        o Full, fast, online help available in under a second.

        o A complete visual compile environment (fully configurable 
	  to provide a visual environment for any program).

        o All the updates, fixes and enhancements you'd expect to the
          original.

	o ANSI compatibility.

	o Romable code generation tools.

	o Source code management tools.

        o An easy to use full source level debugger -- with the most asked-
	  for features

        o A compression system for use on floppy disk systems.

	o Two powerful Arexx-aware programmer's editors

        o Full source code for the libraries and dozens of examples.

	o AmigaOS 1.3, 2.0, and 3.0 libraries and include files.

	o ANSI, Unix(TM) compatibility, and Amiga link libraries.

        o A package of "bonus" tools to help find bugs in your code.

        o Error messages in German, French, or English.

The new DICE is fast, inexpensive, easy, fun and works on any Amiga, including
floppy disk systems.

DICE is only $150.  SAS/C owners pay $95.  Students pay $85.  Owners
of the registered version pay $75, and students who own the registered
version pay just $65.  Add $5 for international shipping.
