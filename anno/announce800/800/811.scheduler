DESCRIPTION

        Scheduler is a database, and appointment reminder utility 
    for the Amiga running OS2.04 and above. It allows you to keep
    track of all your friends, relatives, and business associates.
    It contains name, address, company name, 4 phone numbers, and
    a notes area. It works with most modems, so you can dial their
    home, work, or any number you wish. It supports CallerID so
    when someone is calling you it will search the database and
    show you who is calling! *The registered version contains a 
    call-logging feature that logs all calls coming in (with 
    CallerID) and out (dialing with Scheduler). It also lets you 
    setup several groups of entries, so you can categorize
    your database. Have your friends in a group named 'Friends' and
    family in 'Family'.
        The Calendar half of Scheduler makes it a very powerful reminder
    utility. It shows you a graphic look at your month's schedule by
    showing you how much of your month, even day is being spent! You
    can set alarms for any occasion.
