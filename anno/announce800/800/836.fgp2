DESCRIPTION

    At the start of this Formula One season Autosport magazine
    started running a Fantasy Grand Prix competition.  FGP2 is a
    program which allows you to avoid working out how many places
    your driver gained on his grid position and shows how many points
    Rubens Barrichello scored by coming in third.  FGP2 has a simple
    command line interface and takes most of its input in the form of
    human-readable ascii files which can be created on any text
    editor.  FGP2 comes complete with enough data files to get you up
    to date (currently the Monaco Grand Prix), full instructions and
    rules.  As of this release FGP2 2.02 can cope with up to 50
    fantasy teams and contains details for all the drivers who have
    driven in this season.

Sir-- a couple of brief points. Firstly, you're not a qualified
service engineer, and consequently, sawing me in two will invalidate my
guarantee. Secondly, I wouldn't trust you to open a sardine can that
was already open.
