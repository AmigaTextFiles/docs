The voluntary liquidation of Commodore International has raised
many questions regarding the future viability of the Amiga 
platform and the commitment of third party developers towards 
this platform.
 
We at Spectronics International U.S.A., Inc. would like to
state that we are still committed very strongly towards the
Amiga and will continue to support it for as long as it remains 
economically possible.

With an installed base of roughly 5,000,000 machines, the Amiga
market is still very much alive and will remain so for a number 
of years to come.

We are currently representing various  products on the North
American market and will continue to actively pursue new products 
for distribution in the coming years.
