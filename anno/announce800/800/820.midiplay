DESCRIPTION

  MidiPlay is a program for playing format 0 and 1 MIDI files. The way
  MIDI files are played can be changed using command line options, a
  configuration file or tool types in the program icon. Every file can
  have its own tool types which override starting configuration.

  The most useful options include: transposing, channel muting,
  tempo setting and external/internal synchronization. Different MIDI
  events can also be printed. All major features can be controlled via
  GUI and MIDI files can be loaded using a file requester. The playlist
  feature allows you to play MIDI files from a pre-defined list.

  It is also possible to play GM standard MIDI files with a non-GM
  synth using mapping feature. Every program change message can be
  mapped to any other PC message. Note on/off messages on the drum
  channel can also be mapped to any other note on/off message.

  For more advanced users there are options like merge and melody.
  Merge option connects MIDI IN and MIDI OUT and using this feature
  you can combine your playing with playing of MidiPlay. Melody channel
  is useful for those who want to sing along with music with the
  possibility to mute/unmute melody.

NEW FEATURES

  Major change since 2.0 is that the player part runs now as a
  separate task. Printing events and holding right mouse button down
  while playing won't disturb playing any more.

  One nasty bug which caused MidiPlay to crash when trying to print
  data event on some machines has been removed.

  Playlist idea has been slightly changed. Now all loaded files are
  added to the playlist. It is also possible to load many files at the
  same time. With the minibuffer feature you can make a selection from a
  long playlist and let MidiPlay play those files in the given order.

  New options since 2.00 include:
  o SOFT (only note on/off messages are ignored on muted channels)
  o NOMAPCHANNELS (no mapping on defined channels)
  o SKIP (eventless parts longer than defined with SKIP are skipped)
  o NODRUMPC (program change messages are ignored on the drum channel)
  o COUNT (MIDI file length in measures and duration are counted)

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  If you want to play MIDI files and really hear them, your Amiga
  should be connected to a synth via MIDI interface. No special memory
  requirements. Fast RAM is recommended for smoother playing.

  MidiPlay should work on any Amiga with OS 2.04 or greater. MidiPlay
  requires the following disk resident libraries (both included):
  midi.library and reqtools.library

  SPEAK and NOMON options require Upd and Arexx. Upd v1.30 can be found
  on Aminet (directory util/rexx).

  A guide reader (like AmigaGuide) is needed to read the documentation
  and a lha archiver to unarchive the program package.

HOST NAME

  MidiPlay can be found on Aminet, e.g. via anonymous FTP server
  like ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) or ftp.luth.se (130.240.18.2).
