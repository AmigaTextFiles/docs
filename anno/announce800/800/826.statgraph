DESCRIPTION
   Simple Stat Graph is an entry level statistical and graphical data
   analysis tool for the Commodore Amiga.  SSG uses an Intuition-based
   Graphical User Interface (GUI) and spreadsheet-like editor for all
   data analysis tasks.  A large range of two-dimensional graphs and
   commonly used statistics are supported.  Three-dimensional-like depth
   can also be added to most graph types for a more impressive
   appearance.  Numerous mathematical and sorting operators are provided
   so the user can massage raw data into the desired format.  SSG
   multitasks, is not copy protected, utilizes CBM's AmigaGuide on-line
   hypertext help file system, and comes with a 200 page manual.  Simple
   Stat Graph is useful for any Amiga user who needs to analyze or
   display data.
