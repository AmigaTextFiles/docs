DESCRIPTION

DFA is the ultimate address utility for every AMIGA computer that runs
at least Workbench 2.0. Native languages are supported as soon as one
has installed Workbench 2.1 and above; Workbench 3.0 will be
supported, if is available. DFA is not like any other address tool. It
is an ideal combination of a lot of features and an easy to use
program. Inspite of this combination it tries to use even less RAM
than former versions of DFA.

Registered  users  will  get  a  keyfile  that  enables  saving of the
DFA-Preferences, which is disabled in the public release.

DFA  should  be  installed  using  the  provided  install  script. The
installer program ((c) Commodore) is included!

FEATURES

- Arexx port that understand more than 30 commands
- Arexx scripts can be bound to function keys
- Support of up to three email addresses
- Can dial the stored telephone numbers
- Prints your addresses in several different formats
- All windows  are  fully  font sensitive
- Locale support (german and english)
- Supports OS3.x if available
- Context sensitive online help
- AMIGAGUIDE and TEX documentation; both english and german

NEW FEATURES

- Extended client server mechanism.
- Address grouping
- Complete rewrite of the DFA Arexx port
- Toolbox
- Address listview can be configured
- Added a configurable panel listview
- c/O and state field added
- Support of "external" files
- Search function improved
- The dial function was rewritten from scratch.
- The  load and the save routine were sped up a lot.
- Optimized memory usage (Memory pools etc.)
- Simple network support
- Seperate preferences program
- 8-color MagicWB icons by Martin 'XEN' Huttenloher.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

DFA needs at least Kickstart/Workbench 2.04 to run.

It takes advantage of the new features included in version 2.1
(Locale  support)  and  uses even some features coming with OS
3.0 if available.

DFA is made to run on all all systems, starting with the A500+
and ending up with the A4000(T).

More than 512KB of RAM and a harddisk is recommended.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

DFA is NOT PD. It is shareware. The author keeps the copyright over
the whole package.

The public version of DFA (without the keyfile!) is freely
(re)distributable, but noone is allowed to sell the program for more
money than to cover just the costs of copying.

In any case noone may charge more than Fred Fish claims for one of his
"Library Disks"!
