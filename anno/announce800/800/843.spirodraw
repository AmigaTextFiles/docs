Subject: SpiroDraw05 spirograph simulator
Status: RO

TITLE

     SpiroDraw05 - Spirograph(tm?) simulator of the spiral-drawing toy.
                   Simple, fun and addictive!

VERSION

     This is version 05.  Fixes a minor bug affecting level of detail
     in drawing spiro-designs.  Also added checking for WB 1.3 OS and
     informing the user that arp.library is required to load/save if
     being run on a WB 1.3 system and not present in the LIBS: directory.

COMPANY

     No company, just an AMINET upload by "yours truly".

AUTHOR

     SpiroDraw05 was written by me, Chuck Kenney.  My particulars
     (address, etc.) are included in the user document in the archive.

DESCRIPTION

     SpiroDraw05 simulates the Wheels-and-Rings-and-Pens spirograph
     drawing toy.  Allows the user to specify different sizes for
     the "Drawing Wheels, Drawing Rings", etc.  The use of a computer
     to generate the SpiroDraw designs actually enhances some of the
     capabilities!  SpiroDraw05 is mouse-driven (MENUs, GADGETs, etc.)
     and provides an easy way to create one's own 'eye-candy'.  It is
     fun _and_ addictive!  SpiroDraw05.lha also contains a very nice
     freely distributable "screen-to-IFF" saver utility written by
     Preben Nielsen (thanks, Preben) so that SpiroDraw designs can be
     imported into "paint" programs.  SpiroDraw05 is shareware but does
     not nag the user in any way and all features are fully functional.

NEW FEATURES

     Now tests if it is running on WB 1.3 and if so, informs the user
     that arp.library is required to perform "Load" and "Save" if it
     is not already present in the LIBS: directory.  Also corrected
     a minor bug relating to the user-specified detail of the SpiroDraw
     design to be created.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     There are no special requirements that I know of.
     SpiroDraw05 has been tested on an A2000HD (OS 2.1)
     and an A1000 (OS 1.3).

HOST NAME

     SpiroDraw05.lha has just been uploaded to the AMINET site,
     ftp.etsu.edu (192.43.199.20) and should soon be available on
     all other AMINET sites.

DIRECTORY

     SpiroDraw05.lha and SpiroDraw05.readme resides in the
     "aminet/gfx/misc" directory. 

FILE NAMES

     SpiroDraw05.lha is 57,975 bytes long.

PRICE

     The asking shareware price is the amount sent to me by my first
     sharware contributor (Thanks go to Bill from Glendale, AZ!).
     This requested shareware fee is $5.00 (US).  

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is freely distributable but is a copyrighted (1994)
     shareware program by me, Chuck Kenney.

OTHER

     SpiroDraw05, and other programs in progress are coming out of my
     basement as a result of the availability of a truly wonderful
     "BASIC-but-much-more!" compiler, "ACE" by David Benn.  I would
     like to sincerely thank Mr. Benn for renewing my enthusiasm in
     programming and for making it possible for me to make my programs
     available to more than just my friends and immediately family!
