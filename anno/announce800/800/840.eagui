DESCRIPTION

     The Environment Adaptive Graphic User Interface (EAGUI) is a system
     which allows you to build interfaces that, as the name suggests, adapt
     to the environment they're run in. It uses normal GadTools and BOOPSI
     gadgets, and does not modify them in any way. This allows programmers to
     implement EAGUI in existing applications easily.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     EAGUI needs at least Release 2 of the AmigaOS, and is Release 3 aware.
