TITLE

     InfraRexx
     (and InfraJoy hardware design)

VERSION

     1.0

RELEASE DATE

     11-May-94

AUTHORS

     Leon Woestenberg (leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)
     Jeroen Steenblik (jeroens@stack.urc.tue.nl)

DESCRIPTION

     The InfraRexx software along with the InfraJoy hardware serve as an
     ARexx-to-infrared interface, that adds the function of an infrared
     remote controller to your Amiga, and more.

     With this software and hardware you can:

       o Control external audio/video devices via ARexx commands.
       o Control Amiga programs via a common remote control unit.
       o Learn and edit new remote control infrared commands.

     For example you can control a moduleplayer via your compact
     disc player remote control unit. Or, control your video tape
     recorder via a graphic user interface.

     The main features are:

       o Seperate editor (with learner) and ARexx host commodity.
       o Multitasking-friendly infrared sampling monitor, with very
         low system overhead during monitoring, can also be disabled.
       o Font-sensitive, style-compliant graphic user interface.
       o Localization for Workbench 2.1+ users, and newlook menus for
         Kickstart 3.0+ users.
       o Lowcost hardware for joystickport, with optional throughput.
       o Uses the Amiga Installer Utility to install onto (hard)disk.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

       InfraRexx needs at least AmigaOS version 2.0, and the commodity
       needs ARexx Master to be running in order to be useful. The
       software is useless without the small InfraJoy hardware add-on,
       off which the design and full building instructions are included.
       The hardware can also be ordered by one of the authors.
