DESCRIPTION

    PackIt is a CLI only program to replace the crunch and decrunch commands
    that came with PowerPacker (Copyright Nico Francois).

    PackIt features:
        1) Single command for crunching and decrunching
        2) PackIt will automatically crunch or decrunch a data file depending
           on whether it is allready crunched or not.
        3) Password can be specified as a shell option, or you can use a
           string requester.
        4) PackIt will not crunch executables, unless told to do so.
           Note: PackIt will only crunch the executables as a data file
                 you will not be able to run them.
        5) PackIt will automaticly replace the source file unless a 
	   destination is given.
        6) PackIt can take a dir as a destination, in that case it will 
	   crunch/decrunch the file into that dir.
        7) Allows wildcard [de]crunching with dir recursion.
        8) Automatic adding and removing of .pp suffixes from data files.
        9) Info files will not be crunched unless you want them to.
 *new* 10) Default option can now be stored in and environment variable.
 *new* 11) '030 compiled version included

NEW FEATURES

Since v37.111

v1.14
  - Specifying the option PassWord in ENV:PackIt did not work (fixed)
  - Removed some redundencies from the code, saving a few bytes.
  - Added some more error checking.

v1.13    (v37.113)
  - Small internal change in error handling
  - Default options can now be stored in ENV:PackIt  See Defaults above.

v1.12    (v37.112)
  - Uses PrintFault() to report errors.
  - Switched to RCS version numbering.  Now the version is reported without
    the 37 prefix.  For example v37.112 is now v1.12, as so forth.
  - Removed much unneeded code.
  - Cursor is now hidden while PackIt is working
  - PackIt will now not crunch info files, unless you specify the option
    Icon (Suggested by Peter Sand)
