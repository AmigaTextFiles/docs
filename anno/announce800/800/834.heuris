	HEURIS Logic Continues Amiga Development and Support.

	HEURIS Logic, one of the premier MPEG encoding service providers
in the U.S., will continue to provide MPEG encoding, support, and
consulting for CD32 and Amiga developers.

	HEURIS intends to proceed with their own commercial Amiga
development projects, including CD32 games, for the Amiga and
Amiga CD32, as well as providing continued support and development
of custom Amiga applications for special needs, such as interactive
kiosk displays.

	HEURIS has been a registered Amiga and CD32 developer for some
time, and wishes to assure their customers and friends that they will
continue to receive the comprehensive project support and consulting
to which they have become accustomed.

	Additionally, HEURIS welcomes inquiries from other developers
regarding collaboration and cooperative support for this ideal
interactive video platform.

	Thanks to all other businesses declaring their Amiga support, and
especially to the Amiga engineers and systems programmers who have
given us this sane, inexpensive multimedia environment.  We join you
all in the hope that this machine will continue to play an important
role in the future of computing.
