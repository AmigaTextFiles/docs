DESCRIPTION

      Shelly is a small tool to generate 3D-objects of various 
      seashells (Ammonites, Slug-houses etc.) for:
      POV2.0, Real3DV2, TDDDlib (there are converters from TDDD to 
      Imagine,DXF,Rayshade,Vort,MFF,PS etc.pp), RAW.

      Source (compiles with no problems on SUN,HP,IBM(RS6000)) included!

NEW FEATURES

       new in V1.4:
      
       - fixed a bug in the NODULE calculation-mode (Shelly could end up
         in an infinite loop for some parameters)

       - fixed a bug that caused "Float-Exceptions" (when calculating
         shells without nodules) on DEC-Alpha-Architecture (and others?)
       
       - added "RENDER"-feature (Shelly calls POV itself to render a 
         preview)
       
       - added "Scale"-feature (the shell may be scaled now)
       
       - Shelly now supports 3 different nodule-types in one shell
           
       - Shelly now produces outputfiles with the right versionnumber ;)
