This web site features support for the
recently released game, Young Defender,
which is available from Aminet in the
directory game/shoot. Young Defender is
a vertically scrolling shoot'em up which
is loosely based on the game SWIV (though
it is not as good as SWIV). Young Defender
was developed using Blitz Basic 2 and will
run only on AGA equipped Amiga computers.

This is my first attempt at web site design
so please regard these pages as under
construction.
