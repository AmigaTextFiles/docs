DESCRIPTION

     KeyBang is intended to provide a constructive means for young
     children to interact with your computer.  KeyBang is 
     entertaining so it encourages children toward the computer.
     It also provides a secure barrier between children and
     computer data so parents can feel comfortable with this
     encouragement.

     KeyBang traps all mouse and keyboard input to your Amiga
     and responds with polygons, images and sounds.  The images
     and sounds are IFF ILBM and 8SVX files which you can create
     with most Amiga image and sound editors.  A large set of
     images and sounds are supplied with KeyBang.  KeyBang also
     reads special Multimedia files which allow its behavior to
     be programmed.  You can learn to program KeyBang yourself
     or use modules provided by KeyBang Software.

     Under AmigaDOS 2.0 and greater, KeyBang can be installed as 
     a screen blanker to activate itself if you leave your Amiga
     unattended.  It can also be made to run in any available
     screen mode.

NEW FEATURES

     Version 1 of KeyBang was released as shareware just over a 
     year ago.  It lacked the ability to display IFF ILBM images
     and to be installed as a screen blanker.  It also wasn't
     programmable with the special multimedia files.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     KeyBang is compatible with AmigaDOS 1.3 and higher.  Under
     1.3 it runs on PAL and NTSC machines.  Under AmigaDOS
     versions 2 and greater KeyBang can use any screenmode 
     available on your system.  It can be installed on a hard
     disk (Which will make loading images and sounds much 
     faster)

GETTING KeyBang VERSION 1

     KeyBang version 1 was uploaded to grind.isca.uiowa.edu
     The file name is /amiga/misc/KeyBang1.0.lzh

     KeyBang version 2 is currently only available from
     Walnut Creek CDROM.

PRICE

     $19.95 (US) including shipping.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     KeyBang version 2 is commercial.

OTHER

     Shareware donors for KeyBang version 1 will receive a free
     copy of KeyBang version 2.  As a consequence, shareware 
     donations for KeyBang version 1 will no longer be accepted.
     Thank you to those of you who supported this project in its
     infancy.
