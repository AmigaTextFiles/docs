Status: RO

TITLE

         MultiTool II

VERSION

         V1.5

AUTHOR

         Boris Jakubaschk
         (Boris@alice.tynet.sub.org)

DESCRIPTION

         MTool provides all standard features of a directory utility:
         You can use it to copy, move and delete files, analyze a file
         type and perform an action on it (i.e. show pictures or ani-
         mations, play mods, edit texts...).

         It offers a new feature that I have never seen before in a
         dir utility: MTool handles LHA-archives like ordinary direc-
         tories. You can doubleclick the name of a LHA-archive and its
         contents will be displayed in the filelist. Files can be
         deleted or copied to and from the archive.

         The layout of MTool resembles the good old DiskMaster (V1.4).

         MTool has been developed using the look and feel of OS2.04
         and WB2.1. It works with WB2.0 (not localized, no screen mode
         requester); KS1.3 is not supported any more. It can run on an
         own screen or on the Workbench (resizable, position and size
         can be configured).

         Docs and catalogs are included in English, German and Spanish.

NEW FEATURES

         - Text and binary viewer (written by Andreas Baum)
         - Commodity support (Hide and show via hotkey)
         - Configurable device list
         - Configurable file type recognition

DISTRIBUTABILITY

         MTool is shareware. It is freely distributable, as long as
         you distribute all files! Feel free to include it in public
         domain collections (i.e. fishdisks).

REQUIREMENTS

         Workbench 2.04 or higher

         To use the archive support of MTool, you need any version of
         the LHA archiver (not included)

         To view pictures or animations, to play mods etc you need
         programs that can be included in the configuration of MTool. 
         (i.e. VT, Player...)

         To install MTool with its installation script, you need the
         commodore installer (not included)
