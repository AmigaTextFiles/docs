DESCRIPTION

     QuickTools  is the tool package for the harddisk owner
     who is tired of writing long pathnames when changing
     directories and who doesn't have the time to search
     for files manually. QuickTools consists mainly of
     three small utilities and a library where the search
     routines are. All search routines support standard
     AmigaDOS wildcards.

     Qcd:
     With this you can change directory by only writing
     enough of the directory name to identify it. The
     directory can be anywhere on the harddisk. If more 
     than one directory maches the search word a requester
     will pop up and you can select the directory you want
     to change to.

     If you want to change to a directory with the
     following path: 'Harddisk0:Work/SAS/SelfMade/QuickCD'

     You can write: 
     'Qcd Harddisk0:Work/SAS/SelfMade/QuickCD' (the hard way)
     Or just: 'Qcd qui'   (the Qcd way)

     QFind:
     Search for files, scans through the database in just a 
     few seconds.
 
     QPop:
     A commodity for file and directory searching.

     These programs are a must for any serious harddisk user!!
                                    
     Why use QuickTools instead of other similar utilities:
     - All search routines support wildcards and are in a 
       seperate library. 
     - Qcd (<2K) and QFind (1K) is quite small and can be 
       made resident.
     - The database is quite compact, (37K to store 4500 
       filenames with directory information).
     - Qcd is almost as fast as the normal CD since the 
       directory database is kept resident in memory.
     - QPop can pop up with a hotkey and the search result 
       can be copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted
       to the input stream by program supporting this.
     - All GUI's can be controlled by the keyboard. No need to
       move your hand to the mouse.

     QuickCD   program.  QuickCD  is  now  a  part  of  the
