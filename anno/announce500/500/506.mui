TITLE

     MUI - MagicUserInterface

RELEASE

     1.0

AUTHOR

     Stefan Stuntz  (stuntz@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

SHORT

     A system to create and maintain GUIs.

DESCRIPTION

    MUI  is  an  object oriented system to create and maintain
    graphical  user  interfaces.  From  a programmers point of
    view,  using  MUI  saves a lot of time and makes life much
    easier.  Thinking  about  complicated  terms  like  window
    resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

    On  the  other  hand, users of MUI based applications have
    the  ability to customize nearly every pixel of a programs
    interface according to their personal taste.

    This  distribution  is  interesting  for  both,  users and
    programmers.  Please  have  a  look  at  the supplied demo
    programs  and  at the documentation to see what MUI has to
    offer.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    MUI requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or greater.
    For developers, MUI comes with a C and an Oberon interface.
