TITLE

	(Source and Executable release.)

VERSION

	v1.1

COMPANY

	Private developer.

DESCRIPTION

	The Home Accountant allows one to keep track of any type of
	account one may use in the home.  This includes checking,
	savings, mutual funds, and more.  Along with it's record keeping
	features, one may use it to budget any revenue/expenses which
	flow through an account.  One may also group accounts into 
	what is called a transaction base to compute net worth and 
	obtain batch printings.

	This release supports a new editing screen look and some other
	minor improvements.  I've gone as far as I will with this, so
	I will no longer be making releases of this package.  Future
	improvements may come through other AMOS programmers who choose
	to modify and redistribute the source I have included.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	The Home Accountant was developed on an Amiga 500 (ECS) with
	1 meg RAM.  It requires the mathtrans.library included with
	AmigaDOS. 

	The Home Accountant does not currently work with AGA machines
	without some sort of CPU downgrade (ala Degrader, etc.)  To
	fix this bug, I have simply included the source for any future
	ambitious person who wants to modify the source, recompile it,
	etc.  

HOST NAME

	Aminet (e.g. ftp.wustl.edu)

DIRECTORY

	/pub/aminet/biz/misc

FILE NAMES

	HomeAccountant.lha
	HomeAccountant.readme

PRICE

	The Home Accountant is FreeWare.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	The Home Accountant may be distributed on any BBS or network.  
	There is to be no charge for the program except for media charges
	which may not exceed $1.00 (American).

	I hereby give permission to any second party to modify the
	source and redistribute it for non-profit purposes.  Also
        this new distribution must include the original text files
	included in this distribution.  Mention must be made of me, 
	the original author, by the second party when releasing this
	modified version.  I hope this works to the benefit of all 
	who use this package.
