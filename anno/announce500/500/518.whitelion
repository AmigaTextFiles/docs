I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience. I took another announcement as an 
example, because I wanted to avoid extra work for you, and must have missed it
somehow, nevertheless. Must be a lot of work to moderate...

> Oh, yeah, one more thing:   It's "effort," not "afford."

Yes, of course. Must have mixed them up somehow. Will not happen again...

Thank you for all your work!

Yours, Martin
