I haven't heard anything back from my last email offering to fix the
posting, so I assume you either took care of it yourself or posted as
is.  In case you were waiting on me, here is a copy of the fixed posting.

There is one minor change other than the formatting.  I added a little
more verbage about credit card orders and FAX orders, based on some
questions I got about the copy that I posted to a cdrom mailing list
I'm on.

Thanks.

OVERVIEW
--------

I have further details on the CDROM distribution.  Things are still very
much in the preliminary planning phase, but as details become available
I'll continue to post updates.  The quick summary of the situation is that
I am going ahead with CDROM distribution and plan to produce several types
of CDROMs.

There will be a monthly CDROM containing several categories of material,
including new material received since the previous month's CDROM, a
continuously updated set of widely used "base tools" such as archivers,
editors, compilers, text processors, etc, and possibly a few toys like the
most popular PD games, and some random selection of older material on a
space available basis.

There will be a quarterly CDROM containing the archived form of all the
previous new material from the monthly CDROM's to date, plus as much of the
floppy distribution as will fit.

When the floppy distribution reaches 1000 disks, there will be a CDROM with
the contents of the entire floppy library (assuming it can be made to fit
of course) and the library will migrate to CDROM distribution only
(expected to happen in early 1994).

Here is a quick summary of the topics that I'll cover in more depth later
in this message (not in any particular order):

    o   I now can be reached directly via FAX!  :-)

    o	Why I'm going to do CDROM distributions and what it means for
	the floppy distribution.

    o	How the CDROMs will be organized and how material will be
	selected.

    o	How often CDROMs will be issued and what the cost will be.

    o	The initial production runs will be of limited quantities.

    o	Legal issues; redistributability, copyright, etc.

    o	Submission guidelines for authors.

    o	Library facelift wanted (calling all graphics authors).

There is a *lot* of info in this message.  I decided to do it this way,
rather than break it up into lots of small little messages, each dealing
with a single topic.  Feel free to upload this message to other electronic
services (BBS's, Genie, BIX, etc) where it might be of interest.


WHY CDROM DISTRIBUTIONS
-----------------------

More Cost Effective

It is simply far more cost effective, both for me and for the library
subscribers, to distribute the library on CDROMs than on floppy disks.  The
current cost of a subscription averages about $40/month for less than 12Mb
of new material per month.  A CDROM distribution, depending upon quantity,
is expected to be $20/month or less for 50-150Mb of new material per month
(assuming there actually is that much available).

Multiple Distribution Formats

With the floppy distributions, the name of the game is sometimes to see
just how much material can be crammed onto a single floppy.  There is
almost always a tradeoff between the convenience of having the material in
unarchived format and the desire to get as much material as possible into a
new release, or to make something fit on a single floppy.  A fair amount of
time actually goes into juggling things around until a set of 10 floppies
achieves the desired density of 95-100% full.

With a CDROM distribution, we get the best of both worlds.  With a vastly
larger amount of room to play with, the new material can be distributed
directly in two forms, a ready-to-run form (unarchived) and a BBS-ready
form (archived) on the same media.  This is how the monthly CDROM will be
organized.  The quarterly archival CDROM's will contain only the BBS-ready
form.


COORDINATION WITH FLOPPY DISTRIBUTION
-------------------------------------

Timing of Floppy Releases

For the past several years, I've released floppy disks in batches of 10,
with a new batch being released about every 2 to 6 weeks.  Beginning with
the first monthly CDROM release, floppy releases will occur when the CDROM
is committed to production, and will not be any set number of disks.

It is expected that when a new CDROM is released each month, that there
will be 15-25 floppy disks that are released at the same time, the contents
of which will make up some fraction of the new material that is included on
each CDROM.  Note that not all the new material will be contained on the
floppy disks; the only way to get all the new material is via the CDROM.
There will be a supported way of recreating individual copies of the floppy
disk distribution from the contents of the CDROM.

I expect to release one more batch, 901-910 before the first CDROM is
completed.  This batch should be released in the last week of August.  I'm
currently projecting the first CDROM master to be completed by the last
week of September and committed to production in early October.

Migration to CDROM Only Distributions

Once the library reaches disk 1000, there will be no more floppy releases
and the library will move to CDROM only.  Part of the reason for this is to
allow people time to acquire CDROM drives and part of the reason is that it
would be a shame to get this close to disk 1000 and not reach it.  :-)

After the release of disk 1000, there will be a CDROM containing the entire
library, possibly in the archived BBS-ready form.  The exact details will
be determined during production of the CDROM, taking into account
experiences and feedback from users of the monthly CDROMs.


ORGANIZATION OF THE CDROMs
--------------------------

The Monthly CDROM

The monthly CDROM is designed to meet the needs of users who want copies of
new releases of material as soon a practical with a CDROM distribution.
Depending upon when the material was received in the CDROM production
cycle, and the time to go from CDROM master to production CDROMs, there
should be an average latency of about 3 weeks.

However since it is unlikely that there will be enough new material each
month to fill a CDROM (or enough time to organize it if it was available),
I might as well include some other material on the CDROM and make effective
use of the available space.  Although subject to change, it's anticipated
that the monthly CDROM will be organized into several different sections:

    o	A overview section containing information about the library,
	this particular CDROM, hot breaking news, etc.

    o	A section containing material that is newly released with
	this CDROM, in ready-to-run (unarchived) form.

    o	A section containing material that is newly released with
	this CDROM, in BBS-ready (archived) form.

    o	A section containing installed versions of popular tools that
	are anticipated to be released in updated form on each CDROM.
	By leaving the CDROM mounted, you can potentially free up
	several hundred megabytes of hard disk space to use for other
	purposes.  Of course the tools can still be copied from the
	CDROM to a hard drive if you prefer the faster access speed of
	the hard drive or don't wish to leave the CDROM mounted all
	the time.  If this section gets too large, it may be split off
	onto a separate tools CDROM.

    o	A "filler" section.  Whatever space remains after putting
	everything else on the CDROM will be filled with selected
	material from a previous CDROM or from the floppy based
	library distributions.  This may or may not include all the
	new material from the previous CDROM, depending upon space
	available.  The intention is that if possible, users will be
	able to order every other monthly CDROM (at least in the
	beginning) and because of the overlap, not miss any of the
	new material.
	

The Quarterly CDROM

This CDROM is intended to meet the needs of users who don't want the
monthly CDROM, and prefer to get their doses of new material in larger
chunks over longer intervals.  It also provides a way for BBS operators to
have the maximal amount of recently released new material online using a
single CDROM.  All of the material on the quarterly CDROM will be in the
BBS-ready format.

The quarterly archival CDROM will contain all the new material from each of
the previous monthly CDROMs, back as far as the CDROMs go or until the
quarterly CDROM is out of space.  For the first several quarterly CDROMs
there will probably not be enough older CDROM material to fill it up, so
material will be included from the floppy distribution, starting with the
latest disk and working backwards until the CDROM is full.

The Floppy Archival CDROM

Once the floppy distribution reaches 1000 disks, there will be a CDROM with
the entire contents of the floppy library, in the BBS-ready format.


LIMITED PRODUCTION RUNS OF FIRST CDROMs 
----------------------------------------

The first couple of monthly CDROMs will probably have limited production
runs; basically the number of preorders plus some small percentage to cover
post production demand (20% maybe?) and another small percentage to cover
returns, promotional copies, etc (10% maybe?).  Thus if there are preorders
for 300 disks, I'll probably order an extra 100 or so.  The reason for this
is to reduce the risk of significantly overestimating the actual demand and
having to heat my house with unused CDROMs, using the fireplace.  :-)


ORDERING INFORMATION
--------------------

I've decided on the following price schedule, until it becomes more clear
exactly what the actual demand for CDROMs will be.  Depending upon the
actual demand after the first two or three monthly CDROMs, the price may be
adjusted either up or down.

    o	$15 per CDROM, plus shipping and handling, for any four or
	more CDROMs preordered by Sept 1st.  Consider this a special
	discount for helping to defray startup costs and for helping
	to determine potential actual demand early in the process.

    o	$20 per CDROM, plus shipping and handling, for any CDROM
	preordered before the CDROM master is committed to production,
	which is expected to be late September or early October for
	the first CDROM and approximately monthly thereafter.

    o	$30 per CDROM, plus shipping and handling, for any CDROM
	ordered after the master is committed to production.
	Availability cannot be guaranteed, and is on a "first come
	first served" basis.

    o	Shipping and handling is $3 per CDROM for domestic USA first
	class mail shipments and $5 per CDROM for overseas airmail
	shipments.  Special arrangements such as federal express are
	available for a $10 special handling fee, plus actual shipping
	charges.

You can order CDROMs using the same address as for the floppy distribution:

	Fred Fish
	1835 East Belmont Drive
	Tempe, AZ  85284
	USA

	FAX: (602) 491-0048  (FAX only, no phone orders via voice)

Payment can be made via:

    o	cash  (suggest registered mail)

    o	check, money order, international bank draft (payable in U.S.
	dollars)

    o	credit card (VISA or MasterCard; minimum order $100).

Be sure to state in your order which CDROMs you want and include the
appropriate shipping and handling as indicated above.  As with the floppy
distributions, funds not immediately used will go into an escrow account
(fully refundable at any time), to be charged against as CDROMs are
shipped.

If you already have an account for the floppy distribution, you can
transfer to the CDROM account, and automatically switch over to the CDROM
distribution, by simply notifying me that this is what you'd like to do.

Currently I can only accept MasterCard or VISA orders if they are $100 or
more.  I'm trying to work out an arrangement that would let me handle
smaller amounts.  I'll post a followup message if this becomes reality, but
it probably won't happen until early September.  Please include a statement
with your order that you agree to have the charge made to your card before
delivery of the CDROMs, subject to full refund on demand of any unused
portion.

If you FAX in a order, please sign it somewhere.  Since I prefer to have a
hardcopy on file somewhere of all orders received, I'm not accepting
email'd orders, with payment via credit card, at this time.


HYPERMEDIA CONCEPTS CDROM V1.7
------------------------------

The next Hypermedia Concepts "Fred Fish Collection on CD ROM" disk, version
1.7, should be available by mid September.  By special arrangement with
Hypermedia Concepts, this update will be available from me under the same
conditions as the other CDROM disks, and can be one of the four or more
disks preordered by Sept 1st to get the special $15 + S&H rate.


FAVORITE and MOST USED PROGRAMS
-------------------------------

One section of the monthly CDROM will be devoted to containing programs
that are likely to be useful to a large segment of Amiga users, with a
slight bias towards developers.  They will be in a ready to run form;
I.E. you will not have to copy them off of the CDROM onto your hard drive
(though of course you can if you want).  In fact, getting them off of the
hard drive to free up space is part of the motivation for including them in
a ready to run form.

I'm soliciting input from the user community for tools that you'd most like
to see available on the CDROM.  Some of the more obvious ones that come to
mind are GNU Emacs, GNU C / C++, TeX, etc.  If you submit the name of
something you'd like to see put on the CDROM, try to tell me where you
think the latest version is available from (ftp site name plus directory
path is fine).


REDISTRIBUTION and COMPILATION COPYRIGHT
----------------------------------------

Free Redistribution Will Continue

The library will continue to contain only freely redistributable software.
That is, if a user wishes to take something off of the CDROM and distribute
it directly to other users, or make it available for electronic access, no
permission is needed from me to do so.

Compilation Copyright

I struggled quite a while with this issue.  I've always explicitly
disclaimed a compilation copyright on the floppy distribution, mostly to
make it simple for users to redistribute complete floppies, or the
collection as a whole.  It would not have been feasible to have a single
source for the floppy based distribution and have the library achieve the
popularity that it has today.

However, CDROMs change the entire picture.  It is anticipated that there
will eventually be almost an order of magnitude more time and effort put
into acquiring and organizing the material on each month's CDROM, than what
goes into the current floppy distribution.  This is mostly because it is
anticipated that there will eventually be an order of magnitude more
material to organize.

So instead of 50 hours or so of work spread out over several weeks to
organize the material on 10 floppy disks, it may take several people,
working the equivalent of a full time job, several weeks to produce each
CDROM.  As with the floppy distribution, a significant percentage of the
cost of each CDROM will go towards compensating various people for this
labor.  There will also be significantly higher fixed monthly costs
associated with maintaining or contracting for the necessary equipment and
software to produce CDROMs.

In short, CDROMs may bring a slightly more commercial flavor to the library
(at least at the point of origin) than what has been traditional in the
past for the floppy based distribution.  However I will still strive to
keep costs down and produce a CDROM that is an excellent value for the
price.  I hope the user community will understand the need for this
change.

For these reasons, I have decided that the CDROM will have a compilation
copyright, but the only restriction will be that it cannot be "cloned" and
redistributed on CDROM or similarly priced optical media without prior
permission, nor can it be used as the basis for generating a substantially
similar CDROM distribution.

There will of course be no restrictions on mounting the CDROM and making
its contents widely available for electronic distribution, copying the
entire contents of the CDROM to non-optical media such as hard drives or
tape, or copying any of the contents to media of much smaller capacity like
floppy disks.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES FOR AUTHORS
---------------------------------

If you have written a program that you would like to see appear in the
library, I encourage you to submit it to me on floppy disk or 1/4"
cartridge tape (for large submissions), along with a letter indicating you
would like to see it included in the library.  If you have internet access
you can notify me that it is available on a particular site via ftp, and I
will attempt to retrieve it from there.  However I'd still like to have a
physical letter on file indicating that you give permission for it to be
included in the library, and in particular, have no objections to it being
included on CDROM distributions.  In the future, no material which
restricts distribution on CDROM will be accepted into either the floppy or
CDROM based library.

You can increase the chances of your submission being accepted by following
a few simple guidelines:

   o	Don't submit bootable disks or disks with any other
	proprietary material included, since I then have to go
	examine each file to decide if it is distributable or
	not, and if not, what effect removing it might have.

   o	Organize the distribution in a manner similar to the
	library disk organization.  I.E., place all files related
	to a particular program under a single directory on the
	disk.  If there is more than one program per disk, place
	each one in its own directory.

   o	Try to write a simple entry for the "Contents" listing
	that summarizes your submission.  It should be about 3-10
	lines, and include the current version number, the version
	and disk number of the most recent version (if any) that
	was last included in the library, whether or not source is
	included, and an "Author" list.

   o	Ensure that your submission will run correctly from its
	subdirectory and that it does not depend upon the name of
	the disk or whether the disk is writable (for CDROMs).
	If necessary, supply a script runnable from workbench
	(via c:IconX) that makes all necessary assigns, copies
	fonts and libraries, etc.


SHAREWARE
---------

The prefered method for shareware to be included in the library is for it
to be submitted directly by the author.  However, shareware acquired from
other sources (such as third party submissions or electronic services such
as via ftp) will be considered if it appears that the author wishes it to
be widely distributed and there are no specific prohibitions against
inclusion in libraries such as this one.  The intent is not to exclude
shareware received from other sources, but simply to ensure that the author
has no objections to its inclusion.


CD32 and CDTV COMPATIBILITY
---------------------------

Nothing has been decided yet about this issue, since I don't know anything
about it yet, other than you have to pay a royalty of about $3 per CDROM to
Commodore to include the necessary software/files on the CDROM.  I don't
know exactly what this buys you, or if it is important to a large
percentage of the potential subscriber base.  More info later as things
become clearer.


INFORMATION OVERLOAD
--------------------

Some people have expressed concern that a monthly CDROM, containing as much
as 100Mb or more of new material, is too much too often.  I'm expecting
that the advantages of having all the new material on one media, having
better methods of indexing the material, and having the material in ready
to use form, will alleviate the problem of information overload.

One goal is to have the material organized so that someone can get a pretty
good idea of what they are interested in, and what they are not, within the
first 30 minutes or so of playing with the CDROM.


GIVING THE LIBRARY A FACELIFT
-----------------------------

One of the things I'd like to do with the CDROM distribution is come up
with a better look and feel for the library.  I.E. prettier icons for the
standard files, directories, etc, and using the standard system tools where
appropriate.  If you have artistic ability and would like to participate in
this, please contact me for further details.


GROUP CDROM DRIVE PURCHASE
--------------------------

A significant number of people that responded to my questionaire posted on
usenet indicated that they did not currently have a CDROM drive but would
consider purchasing one to use the CDROM distributions.

Over the next few weeks I'll investigate the possibility of organizing a
group buy for CDROM drives to get the best possible price on a new, high
quality, drive.  Preliminary investigation reveals that we can probably get
about 200 Toshiba 3101 drives for around $250/drive, 150 Toshiba 3301
drives for around $350/drive, and an unlimited quantity of the new Toshiba
3401 drives for around $450/drive.  A software driver, if you don't already
have one, will probably run about $40.

More information will be supplied as it becomes available.  If you are
interested in this option, be sure and let me know.


That's it for now folks.
