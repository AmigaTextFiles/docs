Status: R


                    NEW MIRROR OF AMINET IN CALIFORNIA

Walnut Creek CDROM, makers of the Aminet CDROM, have installed a mirror of
the Aminet archive on their ftp site wcarchive.cdrom.com.  This mirror 
contains the entire Aminet archive and is updated every four hours so it
will never be stale.  Uploads made to our mirror will automatically be 
included in the main Aminet archive and all the other mirrors.  Please
ftp to wcarchive.cdrom.com and have a look.

If you have any comments about the mirror please address them to 
stark@wcarchive.cdrom.com.  Also, since part of our goal is to make
the production of the Aminet CDROM more efficient thereby improving
its quality, we intend at some point to begin running the mirror with
CDROM-like names.  This means that the names would be slightly different
in some cases from the names at the other Aminet sites.  Please also
write to stark@wcarchive.cdrom.com if you have comments about this plan.

Note: Dan Zerkle has made the good suggestion that we set up parallel 
      directory structures, one with the aminet names and the other
      with the CDROM names.  How's that for a solution?
