TITLE

   AudioScope Spectrum analyzer

VERSION

   Version 2.01

AUTHOR

   Richard Horne (RHorne@cup.portal.com).  Comments or questions welcome.

DESCRIPTION

   AudioScope is a real-time audio spectrum analyzer for the Amiga.
   AudioScope uses a 512 point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to process
   audio data received through your audio digitizer to produce a high
   resolution display of audio signal amplitude vs frequency.  AudioScope
   can be used to evaluate the frequency content of sounds of all kinds.

NEW FEATURES

   AudioScope 2.01 is an update to the original version on Fish Disk #543.
   New features include support for many additional audio digitizers,
   better multitasking performance, compatibility with AmigaDOS 3.0
   monitors and display modes, and AmigaGuide documentation.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   AudioScope 2.01 requires AmigaDOS 2.0 or higher and an accelerated
   Amiga because of the high computational load.  A 68020 or better
   microprocessor is mandatory.  An audio digitizer is also required.
   Perfect Sound 3, Sound Magic, Sound Master, DSS 8, and many generic
   digitizers are supported.

HOST NAME

   AudioScope is available via FTP at all Aminet sites, such as
   ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

DIRECTORY/FILE NAME

   AudioScope is located at systems/amiga/aminet/util/misc as
   AudioScope.lha

DISTRIBUTABILITY

   AudioScope is free public domain software.
