MemoPlug for the Amiga

By: HarmonySoft, ISRAEL. Fax: +972-3-315-967
 
Should we sell protected software? a question that you probably have asked
yourself more then once. One approach says that people don't like to buy
protected software and other says that you should protect your investment
and use protection.
 
We at HarmonySoft, have developed a protection scheme for the Amiga that
can give you full protection for your investment with the minimum
inconvenient for the costumer:
1. Since we are using hardware protection, it can be used with any copy of
   your software even the one installed on hard drive.
2. The protection plug is pass-through and transparent to the printer
   connected.
 
When should you use protection for your product?
1. When you sell it world wide
2. When you have invested a lot of money during development process.
3. When you sell an high priced product
4. When you sell a unique product.
5. When you sell a popular product.
 
What protection schemes are available for the Amiga?
Only those made by HarmonySoft: MemoPlug for the Amiga, Amiga DeadLock III.
 
The new MemoPlug for the Amiga is designed to protect Amiga software
products from being illegally  copied. The plug connects to the Amiga
parallel port leading to the printer. The plug is totally transparent,
both to the end user and to the printer. The software that is included
(object code) will totally avoid any operation of the program when the
plug is disconnected. Also are included some samples showing how to use
the MemoPlug routine.
The MemoPlug includes serial numbering, Demo mode and a secret code for
each software house that uses it.
MemoPlug for the Amiga can be used on any Amiga with any operation system.
The object code is very small (about 3K) and can be used with any
development system.
 
Prices:
$26 per plug / min. 100 plugs per order + $200 registration fee.
We accept all major credit cards.
