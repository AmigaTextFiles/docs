TITLE

     ReOrg

RELEASE

     3.1

AUTHOR

     Holger Kruse (kruse@cs.ucf.edu)

SHORT

     Disk optimizer with DC-FFS support

DESCRIPTION

     ReOrg can be used to optimize (defragment) volumes in any floppy
     disk-like device, like trackdisk.device, ramdrive.device,
     hddisk.device and most third-party harddisks. This usually results
     in faster directories and can also result in faster file access,
     shorter boot times etc.
     
     In addition to optimizing a disk, ReOrg can also convert the
     filesystem of a disk during the optimization, e.g. from OFS to
     DC-FFS.
     
     Compared to most other disk optimizers ReOrg is quite fast and has
     many options to customize the optimization to your specific needs.
     
SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     ReOrg requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher and
     Workbench 2.04 or higher

NEW FEATURES

     Major new features since V2.33:

     - support for directory-caching (DCFS: DOS\4, DOS\5).
     - support for blocksizes <> 512 bytes.
     - implemented filesystem conversion during optimization.
     - all windows and requesters are font-sensitive.
     - added option "Keep Locks" that allows you to continue your
       work after optimizing the boot partition without having to
       reboot the system.
     - improved directory optimization algorithm used under Kick2.0.
       Side effect: icons appear faster on Workbench.
     - localization (even when running under Workbench 2.04).
     - online help function using AmigaGuide.
     - numerous bug fixes and enhancements.
