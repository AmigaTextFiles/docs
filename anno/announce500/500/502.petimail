Doesn't matter. Here's the third attempt:  (I  can  feel  how  quality
improves every time I rewrite it! :->)

    Some months ago I released PetiMail, a small tool designed for data
transfers between two Amigas. A special aspect was the usage in computer
networks like FIDO or Usenet and the replacement of the IMHO outdated
program uucico. PetiMail was released as shareware.

    However, due to the underwhelming number of registrations, the PetiMail
project will be discontinued. Therefore, I can't accept any further
registration and the distribution-status will change from shareware to
freeware, meaning you can use PetiMail without any restrictions or fees.
Already registered users will get their money refunded.

    If you're interested in testing this piece of software, take a look at
the telecommunication directory of any AmiNet FTP server, where the archive
has been uploaded.

        bye, Peter
