DESCRIPTION

	AmiTCP/IP is the first publicly available TCP/IP protocol stack
	for the SANA-II interface. AmiTCP/IP provides an application level
	socket interface to the Internet protocol suite as an Amiga shared
	library.

	The Internet protocols, commonly known as TCP/IP, consist of user
	level protocols TCP and UDP and IP as the network level protocol.
	There is a wide variety of different network applications and
	services using TCP/IP protocols. The BSD compatible socket
	interface to Internet protocols makes it possible to port existing
	applications with minor modifications.

	AmiTCP/IP connects to the network via SANA-II compatible device
	drivers. SANA-II is a hardware and protocol independent network
	adapter interface specification published by Commodore. Several
	network adapter manufactures have made available SANA-II device
	drivers for their hardware. Currently there are SANA-II drivers
	available at least for Ethernet, Arcnet and serial line
	interfaces. You can connect to Internet with Ethernet LAN, or via
	modem line with Serial line IP (SLIP) optionally with compressed
	headers (CSLIP).

	A typical application is to use (C)SLIP to connect univeristy and
	have multitasking connection:  you can read mails and news,
	transfer files and use IRC at the same time over one modem line.

FEATURES	

	1. Standard SANA-II network device driver interface.
	2. BSD-compatible socket interface as a Amiga shared library.
	3. ARexx port for configuration and statistics.
	4. Over 200 pages of documentation including:
		- Installation and configuration
		- ARexx port commands
		- Programmer's manual based on the BSD IPC manual. This
		  is a fairly complete tutorial for developing powerful
		  client/server applications
		- Internal description of the implementation
		- Utility and API function reference guide in AutoDoc form.
	5. Basic applications with source included.
	6. Based on the BSD Net/2 release.
	7. Full source code included.

	While all Internet services and applications (telnet, ftp, news,
	mail) can be accessed with AmiTCP/IP, many applications are still
	under development by us and others. Current release of the AmiTCP/IP
	contains following applications:

	* Telnet - standard program to log on other systems **
	* Ftp - standard program to transfer files between systems **
	* Napsaterm - a VT100 terminal emulator using remote login
	  protocol
	* TCP - networking support for GNU Emacs. With TCP you can use any
	  elisp-based networking applications (gnus, gopher, irchat etc.)
	* LetNet - a simple filter for connecting to TCP based
	  services. Suitable for scripts and testing
	* inetd - Internet super server, which starts other services
	  when needed and provides some simple services by itself
	* FingerD - a Finger daemon which prints user information or
	  a banner file 
	* QWriter - an application to test and benchmark network

	Following network utilities are also available:

	* arp - tool to handle ARP hardware address translation tables
	* ifconfig - tool to control network interface parameters
	* netstat - a ARexx script to get statistical information 
	  from networking
	* ping - utility to test network connectivity 
	* route - tool to display and manipulate routing tables
	* online/offline - utilities to control SANA-II device drivers

	** = ported by Mark Tomlinson <mark@garden.equinox.gen.nz>
	     and Goeff McCaughan <geoff@equinox.gen.nz>

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	AmiTCP/IP can be run from floppy and with one megabyte of memory,
	but as usual, hard disk and more memory makes your life easier.

	Amiga OS release 2.04 or newer is required.

	SANA-II device driver is needed for your network adapter. A test
	device driver, agnet.device, is included with sources. Also the
	freely distributable Commodore A2060 (Arcnet), A2065 (Ethernet),
	SLIP and CSLIP drivers are included. SLIP and CSLIP drivers
	contains bug fixes made by Olaf Seibert.

	LHA utility is required to unarchive distribution archives.

	Most of the source files has been compiled with GNU C 2.3 and SAS C
	6.3. Some utilities and libraries are compiled only with SAS C 6.3.
	However, only the executable files compiled with SAS C are tested.
	Also, the DICE C support is untested.

AVAILABILITY 

 	AmiTCP/IP software has been uploaded to the Aminet. It should be
	shortly available at the following Aminet hosts:

	Switzerland  litamiga.epfl.ch      (128.178.151.32)

	The latest version of AmiTCP/IP is located in kampi.hut.fi.  This
	archive is not meant for massive downloading. Major new versions
	will be announced and distributed to other archives, too.

DIRECTORY

	In Aminet: pub/aminet/comm/net

	kampi.hut.fi: AmiTCP

FILE NAMES

	AmiTCP-bin-20.lha	AmiTCP/IP binaries
	AmiTCP-psA-20.lha	Documentation for AmiTCP (PostScript, A4)
	AmiTCP-dvA-20.lha	Documentation for AmiTCP (DVI, A4)

	AmiTCP-txt-20.lha	Documentation for AmiTCP (plain text)
	AmiTCP-src-20.lha	Source for AmiTCP/IP

  	If you just want to use AmiTCP/IP you need only archive
	AmiTCP-bin-20.lha containing also the basic documentation.

	The separate documentation files consists of the full System manual
	in different formats. It is available in text, PostScript and DVI
	formats. PostScript and DVI documents are formatted for A4 and
	"Letter" page sizes, PostScript fonts have 300 dpi resolution.
	Normally you need only one version suitable to your printer. Full
	documentation includes Programmer's Manual and Implementation Notes.

  	To develop your own applications or AmiTCP/IP you need
	AmiTCP-src-20.lha, too.

	Archive name contains the release number, for instance archive
	AmiTCP-bin-20.lha contains release 2.0.

PRICE AND DISTRIBUTION

	AmiTCP/IP is distributed for free under GNU General Public License
	Version 2.

PLEASE NOTE

	The second release of AmiTCP contains some improvements and bug
	fixes over first release. It is incompatible with previous version
	in binary level. Some old applications and new library _DO_NOT_
	work together. If you have an application compiled with previous
	version of AmiTCP/IP, it _MUST_ be recompiled. We hope that this is
	the only downward incompatible release.

	Documentation is still not reformatted for (La)TeXinfo or
	AmigaGuide.
