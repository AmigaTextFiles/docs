DESCRIPTION

   JukeBox is a program to play compact digital audio discs by emulating
   a graphical user interface similar to common CD players. It provides a
   command line oriented, fully programmable ARexx user interface as well.
   It will work on CD-ROM players plugged to a scsi-hostadapter or CDTV.

   JukeBox will open its windows on the workbench (or any other public
   screen) and do its best to allow a font sensitive layout. The main
   goal during development was to create a very comprehensive, self-
   explanatory utility.

   Features:

      - Full Intuition interface
      - ARexx port
      - Fully programmable
      - Keyboard shortcuts
      - Supports any release of AmigaOS
      - French and german localization under Workbench 2.1/3.0
      - Any screenmode or depth supported
      - Windows on workbench or any public screen
      - Tested with Enforcer and MungWall
      
      - Common CD player functionality
      - Catalogization, label and title recognition of your own discs.
      - Shuttle-wheel for pickup positioning
      - Play/Pause, Fast Forward/Backward, Shuffle Play, Repeat Mode
      - Skip Track Forward/Backward, A-B cuts
 
REQUIREMENTS
 
   AmigaOS 1.2, 1.3, 2.04, 3.0 or later. The use of release 2.x
   or 3.x system software is strongly recommended. arp.library
   recommended for use with any OS release former to 2.04. This

   'ANSI' player module might support other drives as well
   if they conform to the ANSI SCSI-2 specs.
