  DESCRIPTION                                                               
  
       TorqueWare for the Amiga is a programming tool that allows your      
       program to:                                                          
  
           *  run faster by using multiple processors,                      
  
           *  share data among multiple processors/processes,               
  
           *  access data by partial content, and                           
  
           *  be source-code portable to other TorqueWare-supported         
              computers.                                                    
  
       TorqueWare can be thought of as  a compiler extension that allows    
       you to distribute computation and data within one or among more than 
       one processors, as in a network of computers or (in the future)      
       multiprocessor boards.  By itself it does not, say, accelerate       
       rendering or create software agents for you, but it provides the     
       means by which rendering can be accelerated (tests show an almost    
       linear speedup with raytracing code) and software agents can be      
       developed and coordinated.  Like a compiler, there is no good        
       demonstration of its capabilities, since its utility depends on the  
       creativity of the programmer. There are, however, two good books     
       that provide some insight on how to program in parallel and possible 
       uses of this programming model ('Mirror Worlds' by Gelernter).         
  
       This programming tool is a simple but powerful way to build          
       distributed programs, and is based on the Linda(R) programming       
       model.  It provides the means to coordinate multiple processes and   
       access a global data space from one or more processors.  A run-time  
       system and six C function calls allow adding data to and             
       removing/reading  data from that global data space, and executing    
       functions either remotely or locally. To change from running         
       locally, where one develops and tests on one processor with          
       multitasked processes, to running in a distributed fashion is simple 
       and involves no recompilation or linking (unless you are running on  
       a non-Amiga system).                                                 
  
       TorqueWare for the Amiga interoperates with other TorqueWare         
       products available from Torque Systems, Inc.  Their products run on  
       Apple Macintosh computers, Silicon Graphics workstations, and other  
       computers, and are accessible using just the Base Development System 
       and Ethernet hardware.                                               
  
       The Base Development System consists of the C preprocessor,          
       standalone  local link libraries, local and network support tools,   
       example programs,  a graphical user interface (to setup and start    
       execution), and online documentation (including a tutorial).   The   
       local tools allow development of parallelized applications using     
       multitasking on one computer; therefore,  nearly all applications    
       will run slower than their equivalent sequential  versions.          
  
       Creating a networked application for an all-Amiga (or mixed) network 
       involves purchasing the networking add-on product for each           
       additional CPU and  setting some switches -- no coding change is     
       generally required. The networked application will run faster than   
       the local if there is a good deal more computation than              
       communication.  Some applications are simply more feasible to model  
       and maintain in a distributed fashion rather than in a sequential    
       one; speed may not be the only reason to distribute your application 
       across a network.

       Applicable tax and shipping/handling are not included in the list    
       prices.                                                              
  
  DISTRIBUTABILITY                                                          
  
       Only items marked as being freely-redistributable are.  All others   
       are NOT distributable.                                               
  
       Any object code or executable code that is linked with TorqueWare    
       link libraries must be licensed by AugmenTek for distribution. There 
       are no restrictions on distributing source code that contains        
       TorqueWare calls, or resulting object code that is not linked with   
       TorqueWare link libraries.                                           
  
       This means that executable public domain, freeware/giftware,         
       shareware,  and demos (and possibly other forms of public software)  
       that include executable TorqueWare calls to link libraries,          
       managers, network listeners and servicers are not permitted.
