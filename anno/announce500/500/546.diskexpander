Hallo Dan,

the following announcement was transferred for the first time one week
ago. Because I did not receive any mail from you and because I have not
seen the release of this announce, I guess you never got it.

Please give me a short replay, if you receive this announcement or if 
other problems arise.

Thank you very much and best wishes

Announcement of DiskExpander 2.1
--------------------------------

TITLE

        DiskExpander

VERSION

        version 2.1

AUTHOR

        Jaroslav Mechacek & others

DESCRIPTION

        DiskExpander is a brandnew tool which may DOUBLE the capacity of
        your hard disk and your floppy disk(s). If you actually plan to
        buy a larger hard disk read the following lines very careful.
        DiskExpander could be the perfect solution for you to save a lot
        of money.

        DiskExpander is a powerful program which multiplies your
        "virtual" disk space. It does so by compressing each file during
        writing (in real time). If you access the file later for
        reading, the file gets decompressed at once.

        Once having DiskExpander installed (takes about 5 minutes) you
        will soon forget that there is an online-compressor working in
        the background. You will be able to continue your work without
        notifying any changes to your used environment. Unless you want
        to change the configuration of DiskExpander you will never again
        have to restart it manually.

        Everytime you boot your system DiskExpander will be started
        automatically either by a command in your startup-sequence or by
        a DiskExpander project-icon located in your WBStartup-drawer.

        DiskExpander uses the famous XPK standard (by Urban Dominik
        Mueller & others) and gives you the freedom to choose your best
        suitable compressor, e.g. (just two of many included XPK
        compressing libraries):

        Method  Packing  Unpacking   Packing  Unpacking   Compression
                Memory   Memory      Speed    Speed       Ratio
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        FAST      92 KB       0 KB  426 KB/s   1048 KB/s        32.7%
        NUKE     192 KB       0 KB   35 KB/s    613 KB/s        45.2%

        (statistics from the standard XPK Benchmark System
         [A3000/25 with SCRAM, AmigaVision being packed])

        You can use every XPK compressor library. DiskExpander doesn't
        even need to have the XPKMaster.library (for reasons of memory
        consumption). All actions of DiskExpander are fully transparent.
        You will notice only a very slight delay during file operations.
        You don't have to worry about your files. If files are already
        better packed (e.g. lha-packed files) DiskExpander won't pack
        these once more.

        The compressor libraries are "state of the art", using reliable
        algorithms, and are enhanced regularly. Remember: If there's a
        new, better XPK compressor (most of them are placed in the
        public domain) you can use it instead of the old one. You don't
        have to rearrange your files. DiskExpander can deal with
        multiple compressors at once.

        There are also some tools in the DiskExpander package. Namely:

        * DEStatistics which gives you the proof how good your files
          have been packed and which compression libraries have been
          used.

        * DevicePacker which helps you to pack or unpack entire
          directories, partitions or even entire hard disks/floppy
          disks. It can be also useful to convert files which have
          been packed with an obselete compression library and pack
          them with a more sophisticated compression library.

        All programs do have a graphical user interface but can get
        also started using command lines.

        For the easy installation process Installer (by Commodore) is
        used. Even unexperienced users will have no problems to install
        DiskExpander. If you do not own a hard disk yet, there is a
        special installer-script which packs a complete Workbench-
        Disk and afterwards automatically installs DiskExpander and all
        related tools on this disk.

        DiskExpander is a carefully tested program. There have been
        hundreds of testers worldwide.
