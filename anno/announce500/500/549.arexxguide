DESCRIPTION

   ARexxGuide is a complete ARexx reference with tutorials and
   examples. It is done in Commodore's AmigaGuide hypertext
   format, giving Amiga users one of the most extensive on-line
   help facilities available for REXX on any platform.

   A tutorial guides the new user line-by-line through the code
   of an ARexx program. Hypertext links in the explanations take
   the user back to complete descriptions of language elements
   and concepts.

   The major reference sections are:

   Basic Elements
      An explanation of important terms and concepts of the
      language, including tokens, expressions, and clauses. This
      section includes an extensive description of compound
      variables.

   Instructions
      Syntax and explanation, with examples, of keywords and
      instructions. This section includes a comprehensive
      explanation of the PARSE instruction.

   Functions
      Syntax and explanation, with examples, of all built-in
      functions and of the functions in rexxsupport.library.
      This section includes notes on file I/O functions.

   Operators
      Tables and explanations of operator tokens. Includes an
      interactive demonstration of comparison operators.

   Commands
      Syntax and explanations of the command utilities for
      ARexx, including RX and WaitForPort.

   The guide includes an index and comprehensive contents listing.
