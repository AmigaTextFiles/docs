Hi Mark,

I'd like to announce PatchAmi in comp.sys.amiga.announce, but I can't
remember the directory it was uploaded to. :-) Could you please fill
this in and mail the announcement to zerkle@cs.ucdavis.edu (Dan
Zerkle) and a Cc: for me??

        Thanks in advance!!

TITLE

     GNU Patch

VERSION

     Version 2.1

AUTHOR

     Amiga port by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>


DESCRIPTION

     Patch will take a patch file containing any of the four forms of
     difference listing produced by the diff program and apply those
     differences to an original file, producing a patched version.

     This is a port of GNU Patch 2.1 for the Amiga and has been
     compiled with SAS/C 6.3, so no ixemul.library is necessary.

     The manual is included in NRoff-format and plain ASCII, also as the
     diffs to the original version.
