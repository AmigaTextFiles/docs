TITLE

     Zodiac's Point

VERSION

     Release 3.2 Version 37.73 (3.9.93)

AUTHOR

     Ralph Seichter             Z-Netz: R.SEICHTER@DARKNESS.ZER

DESCRIPTION

     Zodiac's Point is designed for the Z-Netz, a computer network
     which already covers Germany and many locations in Switzerland
     and is spreading further in the European Community. The base
     for this network is the Z3.8 mail exchange format.

     As it is a Z-Netz "point" software package, Zodiac's Point 3.2
     handles message transfer, import/export of data and all sorts of
     message processing you'll need. The GUI follows the Commodore
     style guides very closely, so even beginners will be able to use
     Zodiac's Point without problems with mouse and/or keyboard.

     An online help system is included and the program is completely
     localized. English catalog and documents are included, the built-
     in language is German.

     Compared to "TheAnswer II", another widely used point program,
     Zodiac's Point is significantly faster in operation and causes
     a far less hard disk fragmentation.

NEW FEATURES

     This is the first release available for FTP, so I won't give a
     detailed list. Every user of previous versions should upgrade
     because most of the features requested by registered users have
     been implemented since the last release.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Zodiac's Point will run with any Amiga. AmigaOS 2.04 is required,
     localization naturally requires AmigaOS 2.1 or better.

HOST NAME

     Any Aminet host, i.e. ftp.uni-kl.de (131.246.9.95).

DIRECTORY

     /pub/aminet/comm/misc

FILE NAMES

     ZPoint32.lha

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     This program is shareware. Minimum fee is 10,- DM (US $8), but you
     are free to give whatever you believe Zodiac's Point is worth.

OTHER

     Note that ZCONNECT(tm) is not yet supported as this standard is
     still under discussion.
