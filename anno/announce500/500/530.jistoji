I took a look at comp.sys.amiga.announce, and saw that everybody adheres to
the capital-letter and indent stuff, so here is an update of an announcement I
sent a little while ago (also left out price and distribution information last
time.  Sorry).

TITLE

	JIStoJi 

VERSION

	1.3 (first general release)

DESCRIPTION

	JIStoJi reads (displays) Japanese text electronically encoded in 
	Old/New JIS, EUC JIS, or Shift JIS formats.  It also prints 
	hardcopy in 16X16-dot characters (24X24-dots if the user has the 
	public domain fonts).

	It runs under Kickstart 1.3 or 2.0.  It can be run from a floppy, 
	and has no great memory requirements (unless reading a huge text).
 
	The archive contains the program, the fonts, documentation, and 
	short sample texts in each format.
