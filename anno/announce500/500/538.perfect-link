Hi!

I'm presenting you this announce of a new BBS software I wrote.

Could you post this in comp.sys.amiga.announce if this announce applies to
the usual "rules"?

My english is not very good, and I hope I didn't do too many mistakes!
Sorry if I did!...


Thanks!        - Regards, Alan.

DESCRIPTION

	A new "polymorph" ANSI BBS software for the Amiga.

FEATURES

	The main feature of this BBS software is that it is 100% online
	configurable. The sysop may create its own structure of menus,
	choosing himself the keys to press, which makes each BBS unique and
	"polymorph" like. There is no need to compile menus. Everything is
	built-in, available even on terminal nodes, and very easy to use.

	One "novice" person can mount a new BBS "from scratch" in less
	than 1 hour.

	The menus are created in a tree-like structure, letting the
	SYSOP choose the keys and link them to one of the 28 functions
	available. Each key has its own access level for reading and
	writing.

	Other nice features are:

	Multi-users, multi-nodes, 100% editable online, 10 sets of texts
	for multi-language support, 95% of the system texts editable,
	4 sets of access levels, supports SigOps, Icons for each user,
	two text editors: in-line and full screen, over 160 special codes
	for text files, supports AREXX with many features, supports XPR
	libraries for file transfers, supports high speed transfers,
	ability to send E-Mail without logging-on, ability to receive
	news without logging-on, editable icon for each user, ability to
	chat from the WorkBench, ability to edit the access level & time
	left of the user, log-off the user, all this by clicking on the
	user's icon, and add some files for transfer by putting the icon
	of the file into the user's icon, plus most of the features BBS
	usually have.

	French version only. English version pending.
	Printed French user manual.

	Demo version without handling the serial device also available.

	Workbench 2.04 or higher
