DESCRIPTION

        Although there are many routines to compress data files and
        executables, until now there hasn't been anything specifically
        designed to compress audio IFF 8SVX files.  Standard compression
        routines for the Amiga typically only get in the neighborhood of
        a 20-30% improvement in file size.

        AudComp was designed to improve on this situation.  Incorporating
        a lossy algorithm, it can often compress audio files up to 10 to 20
        times smaller than the originals.  The user can specify a quality
        level to allow compression of high quality/low compression to
        low quality/high compression or anywhere in between.  Usually even
        the high quality compressions are at least twice as small as
        Fibonacci-Delta encoded files.

        This is a freely distributable demo version of the software.  It
        is only capable of decompressing files previously compressed with
        AudComp.  To allow you to assess the capabilities of the software,
        a few sample files, compressed at varying quality levels, are
        included.

        Two versions of the executable are included - one for stock 68000
        based Amigas, and one for 68020+ CPUs with a numeric co-processor.
