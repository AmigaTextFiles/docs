DESCRIPTION

     Citadel is a full featured BBS program(this sounds like a Jane
     Russell Bra commercial!).
     Some of the features are:

     -- Full networking support
        o Citadel Network(others supported with gateway programs)
     -- Door Support:  STDIO doors built-in.
     -- Domain Mail Support
     -- File upload/download support
        o Selective downloading of parts of archives!
     -- Rooms(Message Bases are called rooms) Features:
        o Semi Private Mail(no mail is really private...)
        o Public    - all users can see them
        o Hidden    - all users can see them once they access them
                      by name they seem Public.  That way you can
                      create a room and invite those you want in it.
        o Private   - only users invited can access these types of rooms.
        o Anonymous - User names do not appear on these types of rooms
                      so a user can say what they want without anyone
                      knowing who said it! Great for door games.
        o Networked - Share rooms with other Citadels(and even other
                      network types like FidoNet).
        o Read Only - Rooms that your users can read but not post in.
        o Directory - Rooms that have files to upload/download.
     -- Citadel is designed to not display ANSII or menus to the user.  They
        are available with a simple "?".  Citadel is designed to make the
        access to messages(reading, writing, downloading) quick and easy.
     -- Users can download all messages(globally in all rooms or single
        rooms) using any protocol available.  Messages can also be upload
        so that a User can read message offline composing relies then, and
        not have a long connect time.  Currently, QWK formats are not
        supported.

NEW FEATURES

     -- This is a major bug fix release.  Users should update to this version
        since previous version will not be supported.  Updating to this
        version from 3.40 and later version is simply deleting a file
        (ctdltabl.sys) and runing the configuration utility CONFG with no
        options.  Users of previous versions will have to start from
        scratch.
     -- See the file update.23 for a full list of improvements.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Citadel will run on a 512K A500 with 2 floppies, however, a 2 MB
     system with a 20 Mb hard drive is a practical minimum.  Citadel
     runs on all Amigas models and all versions of the OS since 1.3.

Where:  Aminet mirrored sites(such as wuarchive.wustl.edu, merlin.etsu.edu)
        in the directory /pub/aminet/comm/bbs.
