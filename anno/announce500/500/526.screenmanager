DESCRIPTION

         ScreenManager opens public screens supporting nearly all
         features of the AmigaOS. It can show the properties of
         screens and displaymodes, too.


FEATURES

         ScreenManager opens public screens supporting all basics like
         size, colors, pens and displaymode. Additionally it features

          - Automagic closing of a screen when the last visitor
            disappears

          - Closegadget attached to a screen

          - Interleaved bitmaps with OS 3.0

          - support of Parent/Child screens

          - Hotkeys via cx.lib to move screens to front or make
            them default

         Additionally ScreenManager can list all available screenmodes
         and can show all available information about these modes from the
         display database.

         This applies also to the new displaymodes of third party
         graphics boards.


NEW FEATURES

         This is an update to ScreenManager 1.13c.
         ScreenManager now supports the OS 3.0 features interleaved
         bitmaps, parent/child screens and various other flags.
