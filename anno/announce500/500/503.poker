DESCRIPTION

	This is a game of 5-card draw poker.  The unique thing about this
	package is that it allows you to construct your own computer players.
	Just think - haven't you said to yourself while playing a strategy
	game against a computer opponent: "This is too easy to beat.  I could
	write a better one myself!"  Here's your chance.

	Of course, if you just want to play against other humans or the robots
	provided, you can do that too.	Currently the only user interface
	supplied uses Amiga Curses.

	Poker can also be installed as a door on some BBS systems.  Has been
	run under DLG, should work on others.

	The robot construction library supplied is for SAS/C 6.3, but if you
	have another compiler we can work together to produce a library which
	will work for you.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Should work on almost any system, although extensive testing has not
	been performed.  It has been tested on A500, A2000, A4000, running
	WB 1.3, 2.1, 3.0, with 68000, 68030, 68040 processors.	The Curses
	interface has failed occasionally on a 1.3 system.  There has never
	been a problem under the newer operating systems.

	To construct your own robots, a C compiler is required.
