TITLE
         UUxT 

VERSION
         2.1

AUTHOR
         Asher Feldman, asher@shell.portal.com  or  Wizard0@cup.portal.com

DESCRIPTION
         UUxT is the ultimate uuencode/decode utility for the Amiga.  
         Uuencoding is the process of converting a binary file into ASCII, 
         so that it may be transmitted over a text, or "mail only" network 
         such as the Usenet.  Many files are posted to the Usenet daily, 
         but the must be uudecoded before you can use them.  UUxT 
         makes the task of uuencoding and decoding simple, with its 
         amiga style command interface.  UUxT now has an Intuition front
         end (UUxT-GUI) making all UU tasks simpler for beginers.
         You can even LhA and uuencode multiple files in a single step.  
         (And vice-versa)  (LhA is a popular compression program/format 
         that allows you to compress and archive multiple files)  Also, UUxT 
         will decode uuencoded files with multiple mail headers and other 
         garbage in them.  So you can download multiple part 
         archives off the Usenet, and decode them without 
         editing out all the headers.  UUxT also allows you to decode
         multi-part archives without joining all the parts together
         first.

NEW FEATURES

         - Added UUxT-GUI, a point and click workbench front end for
           UUxT, making UU tasks even easier. (See UUxT-GUI.DOC for 
           more information.)                                       
                                                           
         - Added Wildcard support.                                  
                                                           
         - Only known enforcer hit removed.                         
                                                           
         - Fixed decoding of split files bug.                       
                                                           
         - Fixed encode bug when not connected to a console.

         - More reliable decoding.
