DESCRIPTION: This is a Digital Logic Circuit Simulator.
             You can define your own circuit using digital
             logic gates(AND/NAND/etc...or create your own)
             Afterwards you can apply inputs to the circuit
             and the program will plot the logic values at
             the nodes you specified to plot.
