TITLE:         PKludge
VERSION:       1.0
AUTHOR:        Steve Koren

DESCRIPTION:   PKludge is a mode promotion commodity for AmigaDos 3.0.
               It allows any mode to be promoted to any other mode, mode
               promotion keyed from the screen name or title, and
               resizing and moving screens during mode promotion.  It is
               useful to 1) promote all screens to a single scan rate to
               avoid re-syncing on multisync monitors during screen
               flipping, 2) use 800x600 or higher resolutions with some
               applications which don't know how to open those screens
               but can otherwise handle bigger screen sizes, 3) use
               PAL:Productivity 640x400 mode instead of DblNTSC:High Res
               Lace mode, since the productivity mode tends to be more
               visible on some Amiga 4000's.  See the docs for more
               details.
