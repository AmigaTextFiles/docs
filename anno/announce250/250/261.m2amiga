M2Amiga is a programming system for the language Modula-2 for the Amiga.
It includes a compiler which supports the full line of 680xx processors
and has an integrated assembler, a linker which allows linking with
object files produced by other compilers/assembler if they are using
the Amiga link file format, a post-mortem source-level debugger which
allows very easy inspection of even complex datastructures and a simple
editor. An extension package is available, which inludes a special
linker allowing to make devices and libraries, a profiler and the
sources to some the modules included with M2Amiga.

The compiler of version 4.1 was extended to support constants of record-
and array types. And the interface modules of 4.1 were extended to support
the new WB2.1.

M2Amiga runs on all Amigas with WB1.3 or newer. It is suggested, that
you have a harddisk and at least 1MB of RAM. The demo version is not so
demanding, so you could use it on smaller systems.

M2Amiga is written by AMSoft, i.e.

	Rene Degen
	Bernd Preusing (b_preusing@bpamsoft.sh.sub.org)
	Claudio Nieder (claudio@amsoft.net.ch)
	Markus Schaub
	Joerg Straube

and produced and distributed by 

	A+L AG
	Daderiz 61		(the a has two dots. In TeX: D\"aderiz)
	CH-2540 Grenchen/SO
	Switzerland

	Phone: +41 65 520 311
	Fax:   +41 65 520 379


The basic package is sold in Switzerland for sFr. 450.-, the extension
package costs sFR. 200.-. Please contact A+L AG if you are living outside
of Switzerland.

For those, who want know in advance what they will buy, or which don't want
to buy anything, but have to write some smaller Modula-2 program (e.g.
for some school work), a freely distributable demo version was produced.
The compiler contains some restrictions, the debugger is missing and only 
a subset of the modules is included.

This demo version can be downloaded from ftp.eunet.ch [146.228.10.15]. It
is found in software/amiga/M2AmigaDemoV41.lha. The readme file contained
in the archive is available separately as M2AmigaDemoV41.liesmich, in the
same directory.
