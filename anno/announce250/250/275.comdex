              COMMODORE FEATURES NEW AMIGA SYSTEMS AND     
         MULTIMEDIA APPLICATION SOLUTIONS AT COMDEX/FALL '92

(Las Vegas, NV --- November 16, 1992) --- Commodore Business
Machines, Inc. will feature and demonstrate its revolutionary new line of
Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) based systems, the A4000
and the A1200 at Comdex/Fall '92 in the Multimedia Showcase, Bally's
Casino Resort, Booth #B320, from November 16-20. Commodore's
presentation at Comdex will focus on professional application solutions
using the Amiga and CDTV based systems in the business presentation,
training, point-of information systems and video markets.
     Also included in Commodore's booth will be seven third party
developers who will demonstrate a broad range of Amiga applications for
targeted business and professional markets. A special added attraction will
be video simulations and Amiga video seminars presented by the producers
of "Nick Arcade," a popular TV game show on the Nickelodeon Cable
Channel.
     Commodore introduced the Amiga in 1985 as the industry's first
multimedia microcomputer system that fully integrates graphics, video,
audio and animation in an elegant and affordable way. Today, Commodore
continues to be at the forefront with its newest members, the Amiga 4000
and the Amiga 1200.
     The Amiga 4000 is a powerful, fast system that features a Motorola
68040 processor in combination with Commodore's AGA chip set. This
winning combination enables users to display graphics in selectable
resolutions from 320x200 to 1200x800 in up to 256,000 simultaneous colors
from a palette of 16.8 million.
     An A4000 base configuration features a 120MB hard drive, 6MB of
memory, a dual speed high-density floppy drive and CrossDOS which
enables users to read and write MS-DOS formatted floppy and hard
drives. The new hardware features are driven by AmigaDOS 3.0., the
newest version of Commodore's multitasking operating system. AmigaDOS
3.0 maintains backwards compatibility with existing Amiga software.
     The newest member of the Amiga family, the Amiga 1200, is the
entry level member of the AGA group. The A1200 represents a major step
forward in the entry to midrange level in the computing industry. In
performance capabilities the A1200, like the A4000, can display 256,000
simultaneous colors from a palette of 16.8 million colors. The A1200 is an
ideal entry level computer for the home. Its compact, low-profile design
and high performance also make it an ideal portable presentation, kiosk
or point-of-sale system.

AMIGA SOLUTION APPLICATIONS
     Innovative, resourceful and intelligent applications, all utilizing
Amiga's multimedia technology, are Commodore's focus at Comdex this
year. The applications, including the software involved, will be discussed
and demonstrated in Commodore's booth. Each application answers specific
needs for professionals in the training, point-of-information systems,
business presentations or video markets.

     The following is a list of the application developers who will present
their newest technology for Amiga systems at Comdex.
"NICK ARCADE"
"Nick Arcade," the popular Nickelodeon game show, has successfully
turned the video game phenomenon into a home television experience.
This exciting and original game show, the brainchild of Karim Miteff and
James Bethea, Bethea/Miteff (BMP) Productions, is largely dependent on
Amiga's exceptional multimedia graphic technology. In fact, ten Amigas
are used for each show's production.   
In Commodore's booth, representatives from "Nick Arcade" will
demonstrate and deliver seminars on mainstream video applications, as
seen on the wildly successful "Nick Arcade" and Slimetime Sweepstakes
for the Nickelodeon Cable Network. Using Amiga and laser discs, Bethea
and Miteff will present techniques that have successfully eliminated the
need for multiple operators. Now, they use a single operator with just
one command.

GREAT VALLEY PRODUCTS 
Great Valley Products (GVP) will present G-Lock, a versatile genlock
system for all Amigas and Phone Pak VFX, a sophisticated fax and voice
mail system.

CENTAUR DEVELOPMENT - OpalVision
OpalVision, created by Centaur Development, has helped to thrust the
Amiga into the forefront as the most powerful video and graphics
computer in the industry. OpalVision is a board that links powerful video
painting software with cutting-edge high quality hardware resulting in
tremendous graphic and video capabilities. OpalVision's modular design
allows the user to select only the features needed while providing
expandability for the future. A representative from Centaur Development
will be present to explain OpalVision's spectacular features, as well as
show a variety of applications that are included with the main board.

CREOTEC CORPORATION - VidDISC CDTV Authoring System
CREOTEC Corporation will feature its VidDISC Authoring System for
CDTV. The VidDISC Authoring System allows multimedia developers to
produce complex interactive multimedia presentations for CD-ROM discs
and CDTV by assembling scripts which link video, audio and text within
the interactive VidDISC environment.
     VidDISC's major advantages are that it allows users to see and hear
the edits while applications are being created; offers a point and click
interface for easy assembling and editing of complex A/V scripts; provides
access to motion video, as well as still-frame video animation, image
dissolve, and color cycling; and allows entry and editing of multiple
language audio and text for any VidDISC application. Additionally,
CREOTEC will feature six application demos using VidDISC for
Commodore's CDTV.

DIGITAL MICRONICS, INC.
Digital Micronics, Inc. will show two new professional products in the
CBM booth, Vivid 24 and Digital EditMaster. Vivid 24 is DMI's 24 bit
color, super high resolution graphics rendering engine for the Commodore
Amiga providing graphics rendering and display power rivaling that of a
Silicon Graphics workstation. Digital EditMaster is DMI's full motion
JPEG, a non-linear editing system for the Amiga. It also is a real time,
broadcast quality, digital video compression and editing system which
turns an Amiga into a professional video editing studio.

ST. CLAIR INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS
St. Clair designs, develops and produces interactive multimedia solutions
for a broad range of corporate and public sector clients. St. Clair will
feature six to eight interactive multimedia applications developed on the
Amiga. The principal ones are used by the Canadian Broadcast Center,
K-Mart Coupon Center and $EATS ticketing system, as well as a number
of customer service applications.

SCALA Inc. 
SCALA Inc. will feature and demonstrate its presentation software
including Multimedia 200 and InfoChannel products. The SCALA
Multimedia 200 software allows users to create spectacular multimedia
presentations that can include animations, sound and special effects for a
number of professional business, government and educational applications. 
     SCALA's InfoChannel is also a presentation software package that is
specifically designed for people who need to provide information.
InfoChannel is used for point-of-purchase advertising, employee
information systems and cable TV ad channels. Current InfoChannel users
include General Motors, ADP, Phillips, Nissan Motors, Volvo, General
Electric and many others.
     Revolutionary new Amiga systems coupled with dynamic and
innovative software solution applications will be Commodore's thrust at
Comdex Fall'92 this year. Commodore invites all Comdex attendees to its
seminars and demonstrations.
