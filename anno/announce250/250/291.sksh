TITLE:        SKsh
VERSION:      2.1
AUTHOR:       Steve Koren
 
DESCRIPTION:  (SKsh is a Unix ksh-like shell which runs under AmigaDos.
              it provides a Unix like environment but supports many
              AmigaDos features such as resident commands, ARexx, etc.
              Scripts can be written to run under either ksh or SKsh,
              and many of the useful Unix commands such as xargs, grep,
              find, etc. are provided.  For quite a while it was the
              only AmigaDos shell which provided an environment similar
              to Unix, but now there are two other unrelated projects to
              port the actual Unix ksh to AmigaDos).
 
              Version 2.1 supports the following new features:
 
                * True pipes between internal and external commands, and
                  even shell functions or aliases.
                * Background shell control structures without needing to
                  invoke another SKsh.
                * Several new commands and utilities.
                * Cross filesystem moves of files and directories.
                * Enforcer cleanliness.
                * AmigaDos 3.0 compatibility.
                * Bug fixes.
                * More...
 
REQUIREMENTS: Version 2.1 of SKsh requires AmigaDos 2.04 or later and a
              hard disk.  There is about 1.2 Mb of stuff to install, much
              of which is optional.

PRICE:        US$0.00
