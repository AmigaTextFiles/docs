Subject: Aquarium replacement now available:  KingFisher
Status: R


  KingFisher is a freely distributable replacement for Aquarium, providing
  a mechanism to search for software in Fred Fish's Library of Freely
  Distributable Software.  KingFisher has been designed for users of both
  floppy-only and harddisks systems operating under either Kickstart 1.3
  or Kickstart 2.0.

  KingFisher offers the following features:

  - Maintains a split database across multiple disk volumes,
  - Searches this database more than 3 times faster than Aquarium,
  - Adds new fish directly from Contents files or Usenet postings,
    even from multiple concatenated postings or email contents files,
  - Fish can be deleted from the end of the database to undo errors,
  - Database is a line-oriented text file accessed through index
    which can be modified by hand and then reindexed,
  - Flexible print and export functions, including search-filtered
    output,
  - Select from multiple different search strings,
  - Limit searches to a portion of the database,
  - Follow version links to older or newer versions of software,
  - Maintain multiple different "bookmarks" into the database and
    switch between them with a single mouse click,
  - Supports proportional and scalable fonts for description text,
  - String gadgets are optionally kept active for keyboard comfort,
  - Full configuration saved between executions,
  - Iconifies to save Chip RAM (46K).

KingFisher comes supplied with a complete AmigaLibDisk database (Fish
Disks 1-770) and is available on the following public ftp sites as
'KingFisher.lha' (477691 bytes):
