TITLE

DESCRIPTION
 
     AXsh's main purpose is to let other users have access to your
     Amiga and still be sure that nothing inappropriate can happen.
     AXsh ensures this by restricting access to directories that
     are allowed and only accepting commands and arguments that
     are defined legal.
 
     AXsh supports multiple lines, multiple users logged in
     simultaneosly and several user levels. User actions can be
     saved to a log file and each user has his/her own home directory,
     but the used disk space can be/is restricted.
 
     AXsh can be used as a bulletin board system with or without
     UUCP. It has its own mail, news and file transfer programs.
     However, AXsh is not restricted to remote access, it can be
     very well used as a local shell.
 
     The shell itself has command line editing, history, aliases,
     variables and scripts. It also has filename and commandname
     completion assigned to the TAB key. The shell uses Unix-like
     paths, which are converted to AmigaDOS paths before executing
     commands.
 
     Many useful programs are included in the packet.
 
     AXsh systems can be connected together to form a network, so
     that mail and news can be exchanged. You can also use UUCP
     instead of the native AXsh net system.
 
 
NEW FEATURES
 
     News and mail systems are now more configurable and mostly
     compatible with UUCP.
 
     AXsh has now eight user levels and four system operator levels.
 
     More internal commands.
 
     Support for function keys, window resize and close gadgets.
 
     When run under ks2.0, arp.library is no longer needed. You
     can also use 2.0-residents and shell-internal commands.
 
     The four main programs (AXsh, Rn, mail/ami and FFE) use
     locale.library. Finnish, French and Danish are included.
     (English is the default.)
 
     Possibility to use also speeds that aren't available in serial
     preferences.
 
     Many enhancements.
