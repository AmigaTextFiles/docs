                 THE PUZZLE FACTORY ANNOUNCES

                          ORIGINS

The Puzzle Factory, Inc. has released Origins, a dedicated data base for
keeping track of genealogical information.  It will support databases of
over 6 million individuals.  The user interface is designed to be both
easy to use and very powerful.  Origins will correctly handle multiple
marriages, step-children, unmarried parents, and other difficult
situations that some programs refuse to allow.  Lists Persons, Marriages,
Parent/Child Index, Ahnentafel (direct ancestors), and Soundex (grouping
surnames by similar pronunciation).  Generates reports on Persons, Family
Group sheets, Pedigree Charts, Descendants Charts, and Tiny-Tafel
(a summary of your surnames).

Features include:  Automatically call your ARexx-compatible editor to
create Source and Note files.  These files may also be written and
displayed in hypertext format.

* Search on any combination of fields or by Soundex codes.

* Context-sensitive hypertext help is built in.

* Support for IFF files.  Pictures of individuals, marriages,
  baptisms, and family groups may be displayed instantly.

* Import and export data between Origins and other
  genealogical programs using the standard GEDCOM file format.

* Generate Tiny-Tafel listings for use with the Tafel Matching
  System.

* Many useful ARexx functions are included.
      
A single floppy data disk will hold approximately 2000 person and
500 marriage records.  Origins is not LDS compatible.

Origins requires V1.3 or later of the Amiga OS, at least 1 megabyte
of ram, and hard disk or 2 floppy drives minimum configuration.
Suggested retail price: US$85

                           DEMO

There is a freely distributable demo version of Origins available, which
has a limit on the number of records, has some printing functions
disabled, and does not include the GEDCOM utilities.  The demo can be
found on BIX and CIS, and the demo file Origins.lzh (and Origins.readme)
are available for anonymous ftp at wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) in
the directory /systems/amiga/demos/commercial.

parts of Origins).
