Subject: Commodore Releases A570 in U.S.
Status: R


                    CD-ROM and CDTV NOW AVAILABLE IN U.S.
                      FOR AMIGA 500 OWNERS AT LOW PRICE

(West Chester, PA --- October 28, 1992) Amiga (R) 500 owners can now
substantially extend the capabilities of their computers by adding the new
A570 CD-ROM drive to their machines for the outstanding promotional
MSRP of $399.00 (U.S.) till the end of December 1992.

     The major benefits of the A570 are noteworthy and include over 600
megabytes of CD storage, compatibility with an extensive library of
CDTV interactive multimedia software titles, additional RAM, and
expandability options.

     By adding the A570 drive to the Amiga 500 computer, users can now
upgrade their machines to take advantage of CDTV, the newest trend in
home education and entertainment. The uses of the diverse titles available
in the CDTV software library are virtually endless; exciting games,
innovative reference volumes and numerous education programs for all age
groups. And all software programs take advantage of CD-Audio, with
video, color graphics and interactivity.

     Additionally, the A570 offers Amiga 500 owners the ability to expand
their computer storage capabilities with up to 2 megabytes of additional
memory. Plus the A570 features an expansion port that could be used to
add devices like SCSI interfaces or hard drives. The A570 can also play
regular CDs and includes a volume control and headphone jack.

     To ensure that the A570 will work compatibly with the user's Amiga
500, Commodore recommends that A570 buyers  have their A500 computer
checked and upgraded at their local Authorized Service Center. In the
event that there is no local Authorized Service Center, customers will be
able to contact Commodore Express(R) to make arrangements for
compatibility testing and upgrading if required.

     To speed compatibility assurance, A500 owners should check to see
that their A500 has 1 Megabyte of CHIP RAM installed and that the A500
has not been modified in a way that voids the original Commodore
Warranty.

     Commodore Business Machines, Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is
the subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company
manufactures and markets a complete line of Amiga computers and
peripherals for the business, consumer, education and government markets.
