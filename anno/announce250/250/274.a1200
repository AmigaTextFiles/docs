Commodore Introduces New Low Cost Amiga 1200 at COMDEX Show

(Las Vegas, NV --- November 16, 1992) --- Commodore Business
Machines, Inc. today introduced the Amiga 1200, the company's newest
32-bit Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) based machine. The Amiga
1200 is priced as an entry level computer for the home and for specific
business applications. The system utilizes the AGA custom co-processor
chip set, which was recently introduced in the Amiga 4000 multimedia
development system. AGA allows users to display and animate graphics in
multiple, selectable resolutions using up to 256,000 simultaneous colors
from a palette of 16.8 million. 

The A1200 includes AmigaDOS Release 3, the newest version of
Commodore's multitasking operating system. AmigaDOS Release 3 not only
takes advantage of the AGA features, it maintains backwards compatibility
with existing Amiga software. Also included in the new operating system
is CrossDOS, a utility program that allows fast, easy transfer of MS-DOS
formatted files between the Amiga and MS-DOS-based computers. 
"The high performance Amiga 1200 featuring AGA, CrossDOS, PCMCIA
expandability, an entry level price point and compact design is a great
choice as a home computer," commented James Dionne, president and
general manager of Commodore Business Machines, Inc. "These powerful
features also make it an ideal portable presentation or training delivery
system for the professional user. The A1200 is another step forward for
Commodore as we continue to pursue a greater share of the home and
professional multimedia markets." 

The high speed, 32-bit Amiga 1200 comes standard with one 3.5 inch
floppy drive, 2MB of chip RAM and an internal IDE interface. The A1200
has RGB digital and analog, color composite and RF modulated video
outputs in multiple resolutions including NTSC and VGA. The unit also
features full support for PCMCIA Standard 2.0 memory and I/O cards,
with expansion capabilities up to 6MB. SCSI adapters and FAX/Modem
cards that connect to the CPU through the PCMCIA slot are expected to
be available in the near future. The system's internal 150-pin local bus
edge connector provides for high speed 32-bit RAM expansion,
co-processor expansion and the addition of CPU accelerators. 

The base configuration Amiga 1200 is expected to be available through
Commodore Authorized Resellers in early December at the Manufacturer's
Suggested Retail Price of $699.00. 

Commodore Business Machines, Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is the
U.S. subsidiary of Commodore International Limited. The company
manufactures and markets a complete line of Amiga computers and
peripherals for the business, consumer, education and government
markets.
