TITLE:         PubChange
VERSION:       1.0
AUTHOR:        Steve Koren

DESCRIPTION:   PubChange is a commodity for AmigaDos 2.04.  It isn't a
               public screen manager, but it is useful when used in
               conjunction with one.  It is designed to make public
               screens easier to use.  Whenever a new screen is brought to
               the front, this screen is examined.  If it is a public
               screen, it is made into the default automatically without
               having to explicitly do it from within a public screen
               manager.  If not, it is left alone.  Thus, the current
               default public screen is always the one which you have most
               recently brought to the front, and applications which use
               the default public screen will appear there.  PubChange can
               also bring the previous (instead of next) screen to the
               front, or bring the workbench screen to the front.  In all
               cases, they are made into the default public screen if
               possible.

REQUIREMENTS:  AmigaDos 2.04 or later
