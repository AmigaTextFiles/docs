Hi Dan !

I just uploaded the new demonstration version of SynWorks (1st Kick 1.3
compatible version on Fish 510) to a few sites. Please find the
announcement for c.s.a.announce below. If you have any questions, just
contact me.

Best regards, Michael

TITLE
	SynWorks - A design, training, test, and visualization environment for
                   neural networks. 
        
VERSION
	2.0, Oct. 26th, 1992

DESCRIPTION
        SynWorks is a fully integrated environment for design,
        training and test of neural networks. Currently, it supports
        11 different network types, the networks' sizes are only
        limited by the amount of memory available.
        SynWorks provides instruments to watch and track (to disk)
        all important network parameters, all kinds of errors and
        of course, all input and output values provided to or by
        the network. 
        All network parameters can be edited, and, starting from
        standard networks, custom networks can be created by 
        adding links and neurons, modifying all functions (learn,
        transfer, error, evaluation). Input/output behaviour can
        easily be specified in terms of ranges, sources, and
        targets. Network display modes include structural,
        error-related, change-related, weight-related and
        memory related displays. All displays provide point-
        and click interfaces to the displayed parameters and
        are available simultaneously (watch chipmem !). 
        All networks can be printed in four different
        modes, giving a textual, structural and two different 
        descriptions on the network's weight map.
        SynWorks also provides a context-sensitive on-line help 
        system that includes descriptions of all actions and 
        important components, linked together via cross-references
        and easily accessible via buttons and hot-keys.
        Also, SynWorks features a full AREXX-interface that allows
        to define macros for internal use as well as using a network
        as part of a larger system, execute demonstrations etc..

        The full version of SynWorks includes the following:
 
         4 disks, containing

         - SynWorks 2.0 neural network design and development tool,
           plain 68000 version as well as 68020/68881++ version.

         - Example networks for tutorial

         - SynCode.lib, library to be linked to C programs to
           allow easy use of networks in user C programs (networks
           appear as subroutines)

         - SynCode programming examples, comprising Car control,
           character recognition, decision table execution, ECG
           evaluation.

         - SynTools 1.1, last version of a data display and 
           processing tool (not supporting Kickstart 2.0x
           special features YET), upgradable to SynTools 2.0 (coming
           soon) and very useful for display and annotation of
           training data, also for evaluation of results.

         Printed manuals:

         - SynWorks reference manual, including SynCode reference 
           and tutorial on both SynWorks and SynCode

         - Introduction to neural network theory

         - SynTools reference manual (Version 1.1)

FEATURES 
   	12 different standard network models
	 5 different possibilities to display network (simultaneously)
	 4 different possibilities to print network (standard WB printer,
	   colour printing supported)
	24 different instruments to watch and track the network's 
	   behaviour
	53 AREXX commands give full external control over SynWorks.

	On-line context sensitive help system, supports keyword tracking.

        Supports all resolutions higher than or equal to 640 x 400 with
        at least two bitplanes (incl. A 2024, Productivity, AGA).

	GUI according to User Interface Style Guide.

 	Version for 68020/68881 and up available.

    C programming interface available.


REQUIREMENTS
        Amiga 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 1.5 MByte RAM,
        Kickstart 2.04 and up.
        Harddisk recommended, FPU (special program version) highly
        recommended, Display enhancer/FF/AGA recommended.

THANX
        Thanks to H*wlett P*ckard for providing a nice
        environment to write my master's thesis, also for
        producing D*sk- and L*serJets to print nice manuals.
        Thanks to Georg Hessmann for PasTeX (though I had to
        adapt makeindex myself :-))
