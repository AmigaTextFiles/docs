TITLE

   PMRead (Poor-Man's Reader)

VERSION

   Version 0.99 - SHAREWARE

AUTHOR

   Paul T. Miller and Christopher B. Fury

DESCRIPTION

   This is an offline reader system for Internet news. It was designed for
   people (myself including) who don't have SLIP and can't get a UUCP feed.
   The inbound modem pool I use is only 2400 baud, and reading news at that
   speed is horrendously slow, especially with one of the plethora of news
   readers available.

   The system consists of the reader, PMRead, some AREXX scripts, a UNIX
   script, and a short UNIX program. All of this interacts with Term via
   AREXX to handle transfer of your news and mail with a standard modem
   and UNIX account. This all occurs at a predetermined time automatically.
   This sounds like a lof of complicated crap but it's not really that bad.

   The reader allows reading and posting of news and mail, including replies,
   followups, and forwards. A whole slew of options are supported including:

   Aliases with multiple-addresses
   Mailing-list management for incoming mail from mailing lists
   Viewing of folders and saving of news/mail messages to folders
   Killfile by From, Subject, or globally
   Message quoting
   Automatic signature
   Automatic ageing
   Interactive alias, mailing list, and configuration editors
   Full GUI multiple-window environment
   Mouse and keyboard controlled
   Iconify with AppIcon and new mail indicator
   AREXX and UNIX scripts can be modified for your particular news system
      or terminal program

   The basic Shareware release supports news-reading only. All the
   configuration editors work, but nothing else is supported. You can view
   folders and save news messages to folders, but that's about it.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   AmigaDOS 2.04 or greater
   At least 2 megabytes of RAM
   Enough hard-disk space for your news
   Term v2.3 or greater (or equivalent)
   Access to a UNIX account with Internet news/mail access

   Some knowledge of AREXX might be useful
