TITLE

AMOs News and Entertainment Resource (AmoNER) Disk Magazine

VERSION

This announcement is for issue number 5.

COMPANY

AmoNER is put together by me (Michael Cox) and Gal-on Broner.  We are just
2 crazy individulas who want to be famous!  Some of the programs on the disk
are put together by groups or individuals with company sounding names.  On this
disk, PrOjEcT:NOISE has contributed along with Barbarian Minds.
Our email addresses are:
aj639@cleveland.freenet.edu (Michael Cox)
ba178@cleveland.freenet.edu (Gal-on Broner)

AUTHORS

Again, read above to see who put the disk together.  However, the following
people have actually written programs for this issue:
Michael Cox, Gal-on Broner, Eric Askilsrud

DESCRIPTION

This disk magazine is written entirely in AMOS (except for a few utilities
used in the startup-sequence to setup the environment).  However, the disk is
bootable and you do not need AMOS to enjoy.  On this issue, and as on the
previous issues and future issues, the disk contains games, a tutorial,
and a couple of useful utilities.  One utility is a MED module player which
also goes along with one tutorial and the other is a program that will attempt
to pick winners of American Football (NFL) games.  One of the games also
has a tutorial from the author explaining how the program works.

NEW FEATURES

New to this issue is the user interface.  Gal-on has made it look more
professional and added a neat 'arcade' feature.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

We are not aware of any special requirements.  However, the disk does attempt
to boot into PAL mode so if you do not have the correct AGNUS chip,
instructions are given as to how to remove this feature.
We also recommend 1Mb of RAM.  We are unable to test it under KS2.xx, but
we feel it should work.
You will need DMS to decompress the disk.  DMS is available on all the major
anonymous FTP sites.
