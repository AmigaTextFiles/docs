Subject: FTP announcement, OmniPlay v1.23
Status: R

Thanks, Dan.  You're doing a great job.  Here's my announcement for
the latest version of OmniPlay, which was actually just *requested* in
c.s.a.audio.

Short: Multi-Format Sampled Sound Player, v1.23

TITLE
	OmniPlay - A multi-format sound player for AmigaDOS

VERSION
	1.23, 19 Nov 1992

DESCRIPTION
	OmniPlay plays samples sounds from a variety of sound file
	formats, including IFF-8svx, aiff, WAV, VOC, .au, .snd,
	and 8-bit raw (signed, unsigned, u-law).  In addition,
	PowerPacked sounds can be played if you have v34+ of
	powerpacker.library installed.

	OmniPlay determines the type of sound it's dealing with
	automagically,  so the minimum command is "oplay somesound".
	This works on *any* file, although raw files might sound
	better if you specify a rate.

	Options control rate, volume, output audio channel, wait-time
	between sounds, process priority, printing of sound properties
	(such as IFF NAME, AUTH, etc.), and more.  Options are
	sequenced, not pre-scanned, so two files can have different
	option sets.  One option even writes the audio data played
	into an IFF-8SVX file, so technically oplay is a converter as
	well as a player.

REQUIREMENTS
	A sampled sound file.  If you wish to PowerPack sounds, you
	should have powerpacker.library (not included) in your libs:
	directory.

CHANGES
	(since v1.22)
	- Bug fix in raw type-guesser.  Sometimes froze with
	  div-by-zero error.
	- Fixed priority handling; now returns CLI to original
	  priority.
	- '--' option syntax is now more sensible, and no longer
	  causes oplay to stop reading soundfiles.
	- '-o' option works better.  Instead of allocating half-size
	  buffers, it now allocates one full-size buffer.
	- Version info added to default output.
	- Recompiled with #pragmas instead of amiga.lib stub routines.
	  This makes the program smaller, and probably slightly
	  faster.
