Subject: Berkeley Unix filesystem release for AmigaDOS
Status: R

Berkeley Fast Filesystem (c) for AmigaDOS.

Available now for anonymous ftp is a Berkeley-compliant filesystem
for AmigaDOS.  This will allow you to read Unix-formatted (especially Sun)
floppies on your Amiga under AmigaDOS.  The program has just come out of
beta and this is the first official distribution.  Thank-you, Jan Carlson
of Commodore for testing and lending suggestions during beta.

This is version 1.1 of BFFS  (Read-Only)      Distribution is 10-11-92

BFFSFilesystem allows you to mount (and use) Unix filesystems directly
under AmigaDOS.  Utility is similar to CrossDOS (c) from Consultron and
the CD-ROM filesystems for the Amiga.

Currently, this is a one-way tool.  You MAY NOT write to Unix disks
from AmigaDOS.  The package has not been crippled in any way; the
write routines are just not finished yet.

Included in the distribution are a few other disk utilities that may
be useful, including fsck under AmigaDOS, Sun disk partitioning, and
raw device <-> file conversion.

It may be ftp'ed directly via the internet as.
