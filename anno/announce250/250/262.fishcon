Dan;

These first few lines are specifically to you.  I cannot seem to get to
you using your e-mail address.  I get either 'undelivered after n days'
or 'user unknown' every way I try.

I have been wanting to tell you that I appreciated your passing on the
info on how to subscribe to the umaine server.  I have been using it now
for a few weeks and it seems to be ok.  The only problem I have is that
it is set up in RNews format and I have nothing here to handle it, so 
it becomes a namual scan exercise.  Still, much better than no input at 
all.

That is all the personal chatter, Regards, Jerry.

FishXref-750, FishCon-700 and FishCon-750 have been uploaded to Mike Schwager.
They are lharced files in keeping with past practice from the AB20 archive.
They will be automatically uploaded nightly to amiga/fishdoc and 
amiga/fishcon respectively.

File names are fishxref-750.lzh, fishcon-700.lzh and fishcon-750.lzh (No Caps!)

The full UX1 address is UX1.CSO.UIUC.EDU (128.174.5.59). 

FishXref is an alphabetical cross-reference (index?) of all of the
entries in the Fred Fish Freely Distributable Library.  It is formatted, 
paginated, and page keyed to the FishCon files.  The three digit suffix 
indicates the highest disk number in the listing.

FishCon is the paginated contents files from the Fred Fish Library.  The
pagination keys to the references in the FishXref file.  The three
digit suffix tells the starting contents file for that set of 50 disks.
(e.g. FishXref-300 contains 300 - 349.)   

The FishCon and FishXref files are plain vanilla ASCII text.  They may 
be viewed or manipulated by any program/utility that works with standard
ASCII text files.

I have made a 2 part distribution of the FishXref to those NON-FTP
capable people who are in my distribution list.

If you are supposed to be in that list and have not seen your copy
please drop me a line and we will get it cleared up.

********************************************************************
NOTICE!! - Cancellation of certain subscribers!!  I am getting some
failed mail notes from a number of subscriber addresses.  They are 
posted below.  If you are among this list please contact me so we
can clean this up.  If I have not heard from you by the next 
distribution I will have to remove your name from the subscription.

If you DO NOT have FTP access to UX1 and you want to be added to 
the FishXref distribution list please drop me a line and I will add
you to the list.  If you have FTP access please >>>DO NOT<<< request 
the distribution!!  The files have grown to over 100K, and I want to
keep the net traffic at a minimum with that volume of data.

Regards, Jerry Whitman - keeper of the FishXref and FishCon.
