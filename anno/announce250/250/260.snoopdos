Subject: Warning: Bogus SnoopDos V1.6 spotted!

It has come to my attention that a version of SnoopDos V1.6 has appeared
on some bulletin boards. This is a bogus version which apparently contains
code to add a backdoor to certain BBS systems. I have no idea whether it
has any other nasty side effects.

Things are further complicated by the fact that I have given a copy of
a real SnoopDos V1.6 to some people (which contains some very minor bug
fixes to V1.5).

An easy way to tell them apart is with Workbench 2.0's VERSION command.
The bogus copy has no version string, while the good copy reports:
SnoopDos V1.6 (19 August 1992).

The bogus copy of SnoopDos is 11312 bytes in size while the good copy
is 10808 bytes. In addition, the documentation with the bogus version
is badly formatted and has some grammatical errors.

So, if you see a copy of SnoopDos 1.6 on a BBS or FTP site anywhere,
please inform the Sysop and ask him to delete it.

Thanks,
Eddy
