Hi Dan:
 
Finally!  Here is the last seven press releases in the requested
format.  I'd appreciate it if you could post them to c.s.a.announce.
 
Although two of the press releases (Scala Distribution and MorphPlus
ship date) are somewhat out of date, the rest are still okay to post
as they are fairly general.
 
Thanks for the help.  I'll have a couple of new press releases
in the next few weeks.
 
Sincerely,
Jeffrey R. Almasol

ASDG ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR ADPRO DEVELOPER STATUS.  BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND.
 
ASDG, makers of the number one selling Amiga image processing product,
is accepting applications for ADPro developer status.  Using a
comprehensive and proprietary DevKit, developers can tap into a high
profile clientele with opportunities to work with the market leader.
 
Madison WI, June 17, 1992 --- ASDG Incorporated, makers of Art
Department Professional (the number one selling image processing
product for the Commodore Amiga), announce that they are accepting
applications from those individuals and companies wishing to become
ADPro developers.
 
The company has prepared a comprehensive developer kit consisting of
"Autodoc" style documentation and a library which hides much of the
complexity of writing ADPro modules.  Using this kit, a proficient
Amiga programmer can create loader, saver, and operator modules which
will operate correctly with ADPro version 2.
 
If a prospective developer's application is approved, the license to
use the ADPro DevKit will cost $200 and obligates the developer to
meet certain quality benchmarks.  "If a third party module causes a
problem on an end-user's machine, ASDG's name is on the bottom line."
said company president Perry Kivolowitz.  He continued, "We require a
contractual obligation to certain quality standards so that ADPro
owners are assured of getting third party products of the same high
standards that they expect from ASDG."
 
The developer kit does not dictate what structure a business
relationship between ASDG and its developers may assume.  Some
developers may choose to market their products themselves, while
others may opt for a closer relationship, perhaps through a licensing
of their products or an outright purchase by ASDG.
 
Company president Kivolowitz said, "We've looked at the unsuccessful
attempts other companies have made to foster a third party
after-market.  We feel our developer program will succeed because of
the side of our installed base, the quality of our developer
materials, our willingness to take a direct hand in promoting some
third party products to our installed base, and our quality commitment
contract."
 
To request an ADPro developer application, or to learn more about
ADPro and ASDG's other color imaging solutions, contact Gina Cerniglia
at ASDG Incorporated, 925 Stewart Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call
(608) 273-6585.

ASDG PUTS HIGH QUALITY COLOR AND GRAY SCALE PRINTING IN REACH OF ALL
AMIGA OWNERS
 
ASDG announces the availability of TruePrint/24, a new stand-alone
utility which outputs 24 bit-plane color or 8 bit-plane gray scale
images on Preferences supported printers.  TruePrint/24 can output
prints of any size from single pages to outdoor signs.  You can even
print graphics on non-graphics printers (such as daisy wheels).
 
Madison WI, August 6, 1992 --- ASDG Incorporated, makers of the award
winning Art Department Professional, announce the availability of
TruePrint/24 (TP/24), a stand-alone printing utility which puts high
quality 8 and 24 bit-plane printing within reach of all Amiga owners.
 
TP/24, listing at $89, can produce stunning prints with 16 million
colors (24 bit-planes) on most Preferences supported color printers
without the need for custom drivers.  TP/24 can also print 256 shades
(8 bit-planes) of gray on black and white devices such as laser
printers.  Prior to TP/24's release, the Amiga's operating system was
limited to printing 4096 colors or 16 shades of gray.
 
Especially exciting is TP/24's ability to output prints of any size,
even as large as outdoor signs.  And, TP/24 can print directly from
disk rather than requiring the image fit entirely in memory.
 
TP/24 provides 11 dithering and halftoning techniques, including
traditional as well as artistic methods.  One method even allows the
printing of images with 32 shades of gray on character only devices
such as daisy wheel printers.
 
TP/24 is fully compatible with Kickstart versions 1.3 and 2.X.  Art
Department Professional is not required to use TP/24.
 
To learn more about TruePrint/24, ADPro or ASDG's other color imaging
solutions, contact Gina Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated, 925 Stewart
Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call (608) 273-6585.

ASDG LINKS ADPRO TO ABEKAS DIGITAL DISK RECORDERS FOR IMAGE TRANSFER
OR SINGLE FRAME RECORDING
 
Art Department Professional owners can now read and write video
streams using the same file format and hardware medium used on the
Abekas A60, A65 and A66 Digital Disk Recorders.  This capability
dramatically increases the appeal and usefulness of the Commodore
Amiga to video professionals.
 
Madison WI, August 20, 1992 --- ASDG Incorporated, the leading
supplier of innovative color imaging solutions for the Commodore
Amiga, announce the development of Art Department Professional support
for the industry standard digital video scheme used by Abekas Digital
Disk Recorders.
 
Using this support, digital video images stored on 8mm cartridge tapes
can be directly exchanged between the Amiga and Abekas A60, A65 and
A66 systems.  As a result, it is now more likely that professional
videographers will use Amigas for high-end video work.
 
Additionally, videographers who do not own an Abekas system but do own
an Amiga, can create digital video streams (essentially treating the
8mm tape drive as a single frame recorder) which can be used by an
Abekas equipped post-production facility.
 
Previous to ASDG's development, transferring video streams to and from
high-end digital video systems was extremely time consuming, if not
impossible, due to the sheer bulk of the data.
 
These limitations are eliminated by ASDG's ADPro loader and saver for
the Abekas format since these modules can directly control the same
type of tape drive (from Exabyte) and interpret the same file format
used to store the Abekas images in the first place.  Full overscan
broadcast frames can be read or written in as little as 11 seconds on
a stock A3000.
 
By using ADPro's extensive format conversion and batch processing
capabilities, multi-minute video streams can be transferred between
any format and an Abekas tape automatically.
 
ADPro support for the Abekas carries a list price of $200 and requires
a Commodore SCSI disk controller and an Exabyte tape drive to
function.
 
For information as to how to acquire ADPro's Abekas support or where
to purchase Exabyte tape drives, contact Gina Cerniglia at ASDG
Incorporated, 925 Stewart Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call (608)
273-6585.

ASDG SETS SHIP DATE FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART AMIGA(R) VISUAL EFFECTS
PACKAGE.  WINDOWS(R) VERSION ANNOUNCED.
 
ASDG has set an October 1st ship date for MorphPlus(tm), a
state-of-the-art visual effects package for the Commodore Amiga.
MorphPlus, already in use in Hollywood for such features as Babylon 5,
provides cinematic quality full motion morphing and other visual
effects.  ASDG also announced a forthcoming Microsoft Windows version,
called CineMorph(tm).
 
Madison WI, August 26, 1992 ----- ASDG Incorporated, the leading
supplier of innovative color imaging solutions for cinema and video,
announce an October 1st ship date for its state-of-the-art visual
effects package, MorphPlus and has announced plans for CineMorph, a
morphing-only system for Microsoft Windows.
 
MorphPlus produces cinematic and broadcast quality full motion
morphs in record time using a proprietary image warping technology and
a user interface which has been called ``strikingly different'' and
``unique and very impressive.''
 
MorphPlus has already earned a place in major Hollywood productions.
Mark Swain, animator for Foundation Imaging, the creators of the
special effects for Babylon 5 said, ``It's scarily realistic.
MorphPlus produces the most realistic shapeshifting special effects I
have ever seen on a desktop.''
 
MorphPlus allows for establishing relationships between source and
destination images with unheard-of precision.  Animators are free to
add as many relationships as they wish without incurring a significant
performance penalty as the number of relationships grows large
(something common to all other morphing systems).
 
Other state-of-the-art features abound in MorphPlus, such as the
ability to subdivide an image into logical parts (called groups),
assign separate acceleration and deceleration curves per group, depth
arrange groups, and even the ability to set a transparency curve on a
group by group basis.
 
MorphPlus's morphing system is so precise and flexible, that it can
be used to edit fine details of an image, or to create mattes and
cut-outs.
 
As for performance, on a non-accelerated A3000, MorphPlus can
produce a complex full broadcast sized morph in the same time as
Pacific Data Images's morphing system (the one used for the Michael
Jackson ``Black or White'' video) running on an ultra-high performance
Silicon Graphics workstation.*
 
Incredibly, morphing is but one of the special effects provided by
MorphPlus.  Other capabilities allow high quality DVE tumbles and
fly-bys, mapping images onto rotating spheres, mapping an image onto
the surface of a pond into which any number of pebbles can be thrown,
and others.  All of these operations are presented in easy-to-use
WYSIWYG user interfaces.
 
MorphPlus is compatible with ASDG's award winning image processing
program, Art Department Professional, although ADPro is not required.
MorphPlus can also be used with ASDG's recently announced support for
the Abekas A60, A65, and A66 Digital Disk Recorders to move broadcast
quality video between platforms.
 
MorphPlus carries a list price of $295 and requires Kickstart 2.0 or
later.
 
On a related note, ASDG has announced the development of a
morphing-only version of MorphPlus, called CineMorph, for the
Microsoft Windows environment.  CineMorph requires Windows 3.1 or
later and an Intel 386 processor or better.
 
For information about MorphPlus, CineMorph, or ASDG's other color
imaging solutions, contact Gina Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated, 925
Stewart Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call (608) 273 - 6585.

ASDG ANNOUNCES ``RETROACTIVE UPGRADE'' OF ALL ADPRO FAMILY PRODUCTS IN
SUPPORT OF THE AMIGA. 4000
 
Timed to coincide with Commodore's announcement of the Amiga 4000,
ASDG announces that all of its ADPro family of image processing
products already support the new Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA)
including the new video modes and color resolution.  These
capabilities, which have been present in the shipping versions for
almost a year, automatically appear when running on AGA equipped
machines.
 
Madison WI, September 17, 1992 ----- ASDG Incorporated, the leading
supplier of innovative color imaging solutions for cinema and video,
announce an unusual upgrade for its Art Department Professional
(ADPro) family of products.
 
What makes this upgrade unusual is that all owners of ADPro Version 2
already have it.
 
In support of the development of the Advanced Graphics Architecture
(AGA), incorporated in the new Amiga 4000, ASDG added AGA support to
ADPro and FRED almost one year ago.  This support has been in the
shipping version of ADPro since that time but this fact could not be
revealed until Commodore's public release of the A4000 specifications.
 
Those who attended the recent World of Commodore-Amiga show in
Pasadena, got a chance to use ADPro on real Amiga 4000s.  Commodore
included ADPro in its demonstration suite to show off the dramatic
enhancements in the new Amiga's graphical power.  ADPro fully supports
the new display and color resolutions including Super Hi-Res and eight
bit HAM.
 
ASDG's animation and batch processor FRED, is also AGA compatible.  On
AGA equipped machines it will show its preview images in 256 colors
instead of 16.  This provides for full motion video preview with
excellent color fidelity.
 
ASDG is certain that it speaks for all ADPro owners when it expresses
its best wishes to Commodore Business Machines on the introduction of
the A4000.  The excellence of the technical support which Amiga
developers have received in anticipation of the AGA is entirely
responsible for ASDG's ability to provide this ``retroactive
upgrade.''
 
For more information about ASDG's color imaging solutions, contact
Gina Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated, 925 Stewart Street, Madison, WI
53713 or call (608) 273 - 6585.

     ASDG MAKES AMIGA USER GROUPS AN OFFER THEY SHOULDN'T REFUSE
 
As part of ASDG's continuing commitment to the Amiga community, Amiga
user groups can receive free promotional materials directly from the
company.  To receive the materials (which includes video tapes,
literature, buttons and other items pertaining to ASDG's award winning
Art Department Professional and its new MorphPlus video effects
package), officers of registered Amiga user groups simply have to
request them from ASDG.
 
Madison WI, October 29, 1992 ----- ASDG Incorporated, the leading
supplier of innovative color imaging solutions for cinema and video,
announce that they will provide promotional kits free of charge to
registered Amiga user groups.
 
The kits include literature, video tapes, buttons and other materials
pertaining to ASDG's award winning Art Department Professional as well
as the new breakthrough product, MorphPlus.
 
To receive the promotional kit, officers of registered (with their
country's Commodore sales company) Amiga user groups need only contact
ASDG's sales manager, Ms.  Gina Cerniglia.  Once a user group has
established a relationship with ASDG, it will continue to receive new
literature, videos and other materials as they become available from
the company.
 
ASDG's intent is to help user groups share in the leading edge
excitement which ASDG's products, especially MorphPlus, are
generating.
 
The company's commitment to supporting Amiga user groups actually
predates the company.  Company president, Mr.  Perry Kivolowitz,
co-founded the second Amiga user group in the United States.  Said Mr.
Kivolowitz, "Having been a user group president, I know how
passionately user group members want to be on the leading edge of
Amiga developments.  I also know how hard it is to get good quality
materials for user group consumption."
 
For more information about ASDG's color imaging solutions or to
request a user group kit, contact Gina Cerniglia at ASDG Incorporated,
925 Stewart Street, Madison, WI 53713 or call (608) 273-6585.
