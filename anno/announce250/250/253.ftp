We had serious connection problems - the result was that our network was
unusable for more than one week. It was also impossible for me to send
you mail from other computers from here.

Yes, this will be done without problem I hope.

BTW your file is currently .tar.Z, I will turn it into LHA as soon as
possible.

Thanks you to announce for the following:
