TYPESMITH - The Professional Amiga Outline Font Editor

(Toronto) Until now, all professional outline fonts for the Amiga were
created on other brands of computers. TypeSmith will change this.
Soft-Logik is pleased to give you this preview of TypeSmith, the first
professional Amiga outline font editor.

TypeSmith can create and edit PostScript, Compugraphic and Soft-Logik
outline fonts. These three formats are the primary font systems used on
Amiga computers.

TypeSmith has powerful drawing tools to allow you to create new fonts. You
can also import characters and symbols from structured drawing programs
such as Art Expression. With these powerful features, you can create custom
fonts and include your logo in your favorite fonts.

You can also use TypeSmith to convert fonts between formats. TypeSmith
allows you to open PostScript Type 1, Compugraphic Intellifont and
Soft-Logik DMF Outline fonts. You can then save the fonts in any of these
formats, or export the font in PostScript Type 3 format.

Bitmap pictures and Amiga bitmap fonts may be loaded as templates so that
you can trace over them. This is an easy way to create the fonts you need.
You can also import a bitmap picture published from any other HotLinks
compatible application.

TypeSmith has many other features professionals and hobbyists will both
find useful. Its AutoMetric feature will automatically create character
widths, and you can import kerning pairs from one font into another. You
can make proportional fonts into monospaced fonts, or just make the numbers
monospaced so that they align in columns.

If you are already familiar with Soft-Logik's PageStream and Art
Expression, TypeSmith will make you will feel right at home. TypeSmith uses
a Workbench 2 and 3 style interface so that you can use it right away. And
not only is TypeSmith HotLinks compatible, but it also supports ARexx.

Not only can TypeSmith create fonts for use with Art Expression and
PageStream, it can create fonts for use with Professional Page,
Professional Draw and Workbench 2 and 3! Now you can use your favorite
fonts with all your programs.

TypeSmith brings professional font editing capabilities to the Amiga.
TypeSmith will be available in January 1993 at a suggested retail price of
$199.95 US.
