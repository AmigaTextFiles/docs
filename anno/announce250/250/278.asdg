ASDG ADDS SUPPORT FOR NEW EPSON COLOR SCANNERS TO ITS ART DEPARTMENT
PROFESSIONAL. FAMILY
 
With its announcement of support for two new color scanners from
EPSON, ASDG Incorporated maintains its leadership role in bringing new
color technology to the Commodore Amiga.  Building upon its best
selling support for the ES-300C, ASDG's new driver takes full
advantage of the greater speed, resolution, and options offered by the
new ES-600C and ES-800C scanners.  The suggested price of ASDG's EPSON
scanner driver remains unchanged at $200.
 
Madison WI, November 16, 1992 ----- ASDG Incorporated, the leading
innovator in color imaging technology for the Commodore Amiga,
announce full Art Department Professional. support for two new color
scanners from EPSON, the ES-600C and ES-800C.
 
EPSON's ES-300C, coupled with an ADPro driver, has been the best
selling color flatbed scanning combination available for the Amiga.
In revising its driver to fully support the new ES-600C and ES-800C,
ASDG brings its customers all of the advantages these new devices
offer including greater speed, higher resolution, and additional
options, such as an automatic document feeder and the ability to scan
transparencies up to 5 inches square in size.
 
ASDG president, Mr.  Perry Kivolowitz said, ``Our support for the
ES-300C has been the most successful scanner product on the Commodore
Amiga.  While the greater speed and resolution of the ES-600C and
ES-800C will benefit everyone, the really key innovation is the
availability of an affordable transparency scanning solution.  We're
expecting great things from these new EPSONs.''
 
The revised driver retains its compatability with the older ES-300C.
Preserved also is the driver's WYSIWYG operation and ease-of-use.  The
driver is compatible with version 2.1.5 of ASDG's award winning Art
Department Professional as well as ASDG's recently introduced visual
effects package, MorphPlus(TM).
