This will not come as a surprise to many of you, as the "Bay Area"
distribution apparently includes every bay on the planet.

Comp.sys.amiga.announce is now available as a mailing list!
The test period is over, and everything seems to work.
The usual Usenet service will continue well, of course.

The information on comp.sys.amiga.announce does not appear only on
Usenet.  It also gets distributed on bulletin boards.  Some user
groups publish it in their newsletters.  At least one
person in Santa Barbara collects information from all the
comp.sys.amiga.* groups and publishes an electronic digest.  
There is at least one list server that distributes several collections
of groups through e-mail.  As stated in the disclaimer, anyone who wants
to use the information may do so however he (or she!) wishes.  It
seems that the Fred Fish listings were the most popular item for
re-use, although my show reports went over well, too (there are more
coming...).

Now, however, if you do not have direct access to Usenet, you can get
the good stuff (announcements) anyway, through the mailing list.  They
will simply show up in your electronic mail.  This is normal Internet mail.
You can receive it on BBS's with UUCP, FidoNet, Compu$erve, BIX, Bitnet,
and probably lots of other ways.  If you have an Amiga with two floppies
and a modem, you can even get it at home via uunet.uu.net.

The mailing list is managed by Carlos Amezaga
(overlord@megalith.miami.fl.us).  He has set up a Usenet->mail gateway
on his Amiga 500 from scratch (he had a little help with the
programming).  He has promised to distribute the software via
alt.sys.amiga.uucp.patches.

Many thanks to Carlos for his efforts in getting everything set up.  
He has put in a lot of work on this and will be providing a valuable
service.

If you wish to sign up for the list, please send a note to
announce-request@cs.ucdavis.edu.  Use this address for all
mail about the list.  In other words, if you want to subscribe,
unsubscribe, complain, or suggest, send a note to
announce-request@cs.ucdavis.edu.  Both Carlos and I will read the
mail.

If you wish to post an announcement to comp.sys.amiga.announce, please
e-mail it to announce@cs.ucdavis.edu.  This has not changed.

Anyone who can come up with a better way of getting all three addresses
and the two instructions into a three-line signature earns my undying
gratitude and ten free brownie points.
