Subject: CyberCron v1.5 now available
Status: RO

CyberCron v1.5 is now available.  It is on amiga.physik.unizh.ch as
/amiga/os20/cli/CyberCron15.lha, has been uploaded to BIX in
amiga.user/listings as CybrCron15.lha and is also available from my machine
via BMS as BMS:Pub/CyberCron/CyberCron15.lha.

What is CyberCron?  It is a cron (stangely enough :->) that was written
specifically for any Amiga running Workbench 2.04+.  Having ARexx available
will increase its usefulness, but is not required.

For those that don't know what a cron is: it is a program which allows you to
specify certain commands to be executed at specific times without user
intervention.

CyberCron is no ordinary Amiga cron, however.  It supports, amoung other
things:

    1)  Uses the dos.library System() call to start jobs, providing greater
        flexibility in launching the job.  This allows for things like stack
        size, priority and shell to be specified on a per event basis.

    2)  Can directly launch ARexx commands and scripts without the need of
        the RX activator.

    3)  Output can be redirected to a file or __sent as mail to a user__
        (provided the system has a sendmail command).

    4)  Job queues similar to the UNIX cron allows for the UNIX commands
        'at' and 'batch' to be simulated via ARexx scripts (provided).
        Queues can also be used to insure sequencing of events, etc.

    5)  ARexx port supporting 22 commands.

    6)  Uses file notification to determine automatically when the crontab
        file has been modified and should be re-read.

    7)  Sensitive to small shifts backwards in time (such as might be caused
        by doing a SetClock LOAD once a day via cron) are noticed and
        accounted for.

    8)  Localization support under Workbench 2.1.

    9)  ...several more options exist too

Changes from v1.3 to v1.5 include the addition of several ARexx commands,
localization support when running under Workbench 2.1, better Workbench
support, various code tweaks, an enhanced at.rexx macro, a doc file
re-written in AmigaGuide format and one or two other miscellaneous things.

Check it out, you won't be sorry! :-)
