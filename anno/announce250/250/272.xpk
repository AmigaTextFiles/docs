Hi

here comes the XPK 2.5 announcement. As a side-note: Whenever someone
announces an upload to an AmiNet site (see below), you may want to
add the list of other sites to spare the net. Also, there's an identical
path on all mirrors now: pub/aminet/. So if someone announces a file
os20/wb/ToolManager.lha, the complete path is 
/pub/aminet/os20/wb/ToolManager.lha on all sites.

Now for XPK:

DESCRIPTION
 
  XPK is an interfacing standard between application programs and packer 
  libraries. Every XPK application program can pack data with any XPK
  packer.
  There are some applications bundled with this archive: 2 (de)compressing 
  filesystems, a packing app-icon, command line packers, a LoadSeg() patch, 
  an adapted image displayer, a movie player, a text viewer and many more. 
  All these can thus handle compressed data.
  Five packers are included in this package, plus two very safe encryptors
  and various demo or special purpose XPK libraries.
