DESCRIPTION


     This is basicly a mathematical tool for viewing 3D  functions.
     Both polar and rectangular function displaying is supported. I mean
     the functions of the type
          z=f(x,y)      (rectangular)

          beta=f(x,y)
          teta=g(x,y)      (polar)
          radius=h(x,y)
     can be viewed.

     * There are various drawing modes such as BLEND and CHEQUERED which
     enables user to have fine pictures.
     * Different screen modes can be selected within the program.
     * The maximum grid resolution can be set from cli which gives user
     a control over the memory requirement.( 512k owners will like this)
     * The program limit to the grid resolution is 180x180 (enough ehh!)
     * The program is very fast
