:Thanks for the announcement.  Before I put it up, I need to know
:how you are associated with the company/product.  Just stick
:the information into the post and send it in again.

Well, I'm one of the founding members of our little development group,
and the one running a UUCP site, so I get to follow in Jim "Emplant"
Drew's footsteps.  If you need a more formal job title for a posting,
you can probably stick "programmer/analyst" in there somewhere (though I
remember I signed something that said 'C software guy' :-).

:Do you really want to put a specific release date on that post?
:That's a rather risky proposition in high-tech development.

It's actually a pretty simple piece of hardware, and we should have the
first batch together in a couple of weeks or so.

Anyway, a little reformatting to match what usually seems to show up in
c.s.a.announce...
