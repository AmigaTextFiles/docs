ANNOUNCING:

 LYAPUNOVIA V1.0

-Displaying the Juiciest Object in Mathematics.


AUTHOR:

Jesper Juul


DESCRIPTION:

Lyapunovia is  a mindboggingly  colorful program that makes pictures from a
simple mathematical formula. (And it's NOT Mandelbrot!)

Lyapunovia pictures vary from colorful candy to mean  metal (or something),
offering  you  everything  you  ever  wanted  in  visual  representation of
abstract nothings...

Lyapunovia has been thoroughly tested on Amiga 500/1000/2000/3000
with WB 1.2/1.3/2.0/2.1.

Special registered  versions with precision-extension, optimized for bigger
CPUs, and support of WB 2.0/2.1  and WB  3.0 displaymodes  (all 256 colors)
are avaliable. (24 bit file output planned.)


DISTRIBUTION:

The unregistered version of Lyapunovia is fully working and Freely
Redistributable, as long as the original release is kept intact.


REQUIREMENTS:

An Amiga.


THIS RELEASE:

This release includes:

-The Lyapunovia program and documentation.
-Nico Francois' ReqTools.library.
-A set of palette files.
-A set of Lyapunovia coordinate files.


PRICE:

A shareware fee of US$ 15, DM 25 or DKR 80 is requested.
