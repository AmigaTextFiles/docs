Subject: Warning to users of Asimware "FishMarket" CDROM
Status: RO


	As some of you may know, Fish Disk 622 was replaced by 622B
because the disk originally contained a "trojan horse."  (A program
that is intentionally destructive.)  This was the program
"Challenger."  Fish Disk 622B does not have the Challenger program.
This information comes directly from e-mail I received from Fred Fish.

	The CDROM disk "FishMarket" version 1.0 by Asimware
Innovations, sold with the AsimCDFS CDROM filesystem, unfortunately
has the old version of Fish Disk 622 on it.  Thus, it contains the
Challenger program which (reportedly) is a trojan horse.  I have
verified myself that Challenger is on FishMarket 1.0, since I own the
disc.  (However, I have not checked that it is a trojan horse, since I
don't want to risk running it!  But Fred Fish's information above
makes me believe it.)

	If you have this CDROM, do not execute the Challenger program
in the directory FishMarket:Fishies/601-625/Disk_622.  (Of course, you
can't delete it, since it's on a CDROM!)  I have already reported the
problem to Asimware.

	I received the information about FishMarket from Chris of
Hypermedia Concepts.  Hypermedia also sells Fred Fish CDROM discs for
the Amiga, and their product (version 1.5) does not have Challenger on
it.

	(Note: On reading this, you might think that Hypermedia is
trying to bad-mouth a competitor.  However, I do NOT believe this is
the case.  Hypermedia and Asimware do not consider themselves to be
competitors, according to both Chris at Hypermedia and Paul Reeves at
Asimware.  This is because FishMarket is sold ONLY as a "bonus" for
buying AsimCDFS and has never been updated, but Hypermedia's discs are
sold alone and updated 3 times per year.  They are providing different
services.)

	I am not related in any way with Asimware nor Hypermedia
except as a customer.

                                                        Dan
