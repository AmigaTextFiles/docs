TITLE

   PMRead (Poor-Man's Reader) Sample News File

AUTHOR

   Paul T. Miller

DESCRIPTION

   This is a sample news-file and database for the PMRead system announced
   earlier. I realized people might like to see what the reader can do before
   spending time getting it set up for their UNIX system.

   This example is small, containing only four random articles from three
   groups, but it should be sufficient.


   A NOTE FOR UUCP USERS: There WILL be an update which will work with UUCP.
      First this will be a replacement GetNews AREXX script. PMRead Version 2.0
      will use a different news storage format identical to UUCP, so can use the
      same environment as UUCP.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

   PMRead version 0.99 Shareware demo release
