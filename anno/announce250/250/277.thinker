David Talmage has taken the time to package the Hacker Jargon
document as a Thinker document.  Access to this document requires
the Demo (Read-Only) version of Thinker which I have released 
to many BBS's and have even sent to Fred Fish.  I have reviewed
the information below and request that it be posted in
"comp.sys.amiga.announce".  I am the sole proprietor of 
Poor Person Software.  Thanks!!


TITLE
	Thinker Demo

VERSION
	2.1.4

COMPANY
	Poor Person Software
	3721 Starr King Circle
	Palo Alto, CA 94306

	(415) 493-7234

DESCRIPTION
	From the Thinker manual: "Thinker is a Hierarchical Text processor
	with HyperText.  A Thinker document is made up of a collection of
	paragraphs and images (referred to as "statements" or "branches"
	in this manual) arranged hierarchically and containing textual
	links to each other.  All textual statements in a Thinker document
	can have a number of labels and can be referenced by a string
	(a link) that "names one of the labels."

	In other words, you can use Thinker to display words and pictures.
	Thinker allows you to organize your ideas in a non-linear way, 
	to navigate from one point to another, and to find your way back to
	where you started.

	Thinker can talk to other programs via AREXX.

NEW FEATURES
	CD-ROM support.

	This version of Thinker supports "External Links", connections to
	"flat" files.  This is useful for displaying text that 	must be 
	formatted "just so" and for accessing read-only files like CD-ROM 
	dictionaries.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
	You don't need a hard disk, but it helps.  Floppy-only users are 
	advised to get a copy of ASDG's FACC II floppy accelerator.

	Thinker uses a lot of memory.  

	AREXX.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	The demo version is freely distributable.

OTHER
	If you'd like to see a big document all marked up for Thinker,
	download jarg2910.lha.  It's in the same directory as think214.lzh 
	on both amiga.physik.unizh.ch and guvax.georgetown.edu.

	Jarg2910.lha contains the famous hacker "Jargon File" plus
	some tools for converting the plain text Jargon File into
	a Thinker document.

	Jarg2910.lha requires a hard disk.

	There is said to be a Mac version of Thinker.  Contact Poor Person
	Software for details.
