Subject: NEW RELEASE:  KingFisher v1.1
Status: RO

  Available via anonymous ftp is version 1.1 of KingFisher, now offering:

    1. the much-requested program name index (faster than Aquarium's.)
    2. capability to adjust to overscan, PAL, and interlace resolutions.


  General overview of KingFisher:

  KingFisher is a freely distributable replacement for Aquarium, providing
  a mechanism to search for software in Fred Fish's Library of Freely
  Distributable Software.  KingFisher has been designed for users of both
  floppy-only and harddisks systems operating under either Kickstart 1.3
  or Kickstart 2.0.

  KingFisher v1.1 offers the following features:

  - Maintains a split database across multiple disk volumes,
  - Searches this database more than 3 times faster than Aquarium,
  + Provides a small and very fast program name search index,
  - Adds new fish directly from Contents files or Usenet postings,
    even from multiple concatenated postings or email contents files,
  - Fish can be deleted from the end of the database to undo errors,
  - Database is a line-oriented text file accessed through index
    which can be modified by hand and then reindexed,
  - Flexible print and export functions, including search-filtered
    output,
  - Select from multiple different search strings,
  - Limit searches to a portion of the database,
  - Follow version links to older or newer versions of software,
  - Maintain multiple different "bookmarks" into the database and
    switch between them with a single mouse click,
  - Supports proportional and scalable fonts for description text,
  + Adjusts to overscan, PAL, and interlace displays,
  - String gadgets are optionally kept active for keyboard comfort,
  - Full configuration saved between executions,
  - Iconifies to save Chip RAM (46K).

This update to the original version 1.0 does not include a database.
To obtain the database and complete program documentation, too, you
must obtain a file named KingFisher.lha which is 477691 bytes in size.
KingFisher11.lha is 66508 bytes in size.

KingFisher.lha and now KingFisher11.lha can be found at the following
ftp sites:

wuarchive.wustl.edu	128.252.135.4	   /systems/amiga/incoming/fish
grind.isca.uiowa.edu	128.255.19.233	   /amiga/Read.These         (*)
ux1.cso.uiuc.edu	128.174.5.59	   /pub/amiga/KingFisher     (*)

(*) May take a little time for KingFisher11.lha to show up there.
