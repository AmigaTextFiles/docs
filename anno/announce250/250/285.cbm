Commodore Business Machines, Inc. was recently surprised that the
magazine NEW MEDIA 1993 Multimedia Tool Guide (November issue date)
omitted covering any information on Amiga product. 

Perhaps NEW MEDIA is not aware just how many Multimedia users own
and respect Amiga product for their diverse uses?  And . . . perhaps it
would be beneficial for NEW MEDIA to have our users tell them about
Amiga and its Multimedia capabilities.
