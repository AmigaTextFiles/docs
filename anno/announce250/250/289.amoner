TITLE

AMOs News and Entertainment Resource (AmoNER) Disk Magazine

VERSION

This announcement is for issue number 6.

COMPANY

AmoNER is put together by me (Michael Cox) and Gal-on Broner.  We are two
AMOS Users who want to help other AMOS users learn more about AMOS.  We also
hope non-AMOS users will catch the fever and want to learn more.  We accept
all contributions and will put them on the disk as long as they aren't full of
racism, sexism, etc.  We want this to be something for everyone.
Some of the programs on the disk are put together by groups or individuals with
company sounding names.

Our email addresses are:
aj639@cleveland.freenet.edu (Michael Cox)
ba178@cleveland.freenet.edu (Gal-on Broner)

AUTHORS

Again, read above to see who put the disk together.  However, other people have
written programs for this issue.

DESCRIPTION

This disk magazine is written entirely in AMOS (except for a few utilities
used in the startup-sequence to setup the environment).  However, the disk is
bootable and you do not need AMOS to enjoy.  Look for games, utilities, reviews,
and programming tutorials.

NEW FEATURES

Nothing new, except for the new programs.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

We are not aware of any special requirements.  However, the disk does attempt
to boot into PAL mode so if you do not have the correct AGNUS chip,
instructions are given as to how to remove this feature.
We also recommend 1Mb of RAM.  We are unable to test it under KS2.xx, but
we feel it should work.
You will need DMS to decompress the disk.  DMS is available on all the major
anonymous FTP sites.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

Again, please read above.  You may distribute AmoNER disks any place you like.
Local bulletin boards, user group meetings, CIX, CompuServe, Portal, etc.  The
more places it is available, the more famous AMOS will become!  Help spread the
word of AMOS and AMOS Professional!

OTHER

Version 1.34 of AMOS (by Europress Software) was used to create this issue.
All types of comments and submissions are accepted and we try to make sure all
