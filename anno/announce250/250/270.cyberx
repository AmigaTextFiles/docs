TITLE

	CyberX10

VERSION

	1.1	(first public release)

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

CyberX10 allows one to control the BSR X-10 CP290 computer interface from
their computer.  This allows one to turn lights and/or appliances off at
various times.

The X-10 line of control devices can be obtained from a number of places.  I
purchased mine from Radio Shack (where it is know as Plug'n Power instead of
X-10).  The CP290 costs about $80 US, while receiver units are generally
around $12-$15 US each.

CyberX10 has two modes of operation:

	1)  one can issue commands in direct mode so that the unit will
	    respond immediately.

	2)  one can create a human readable ascii event file using
	    a text editor and download this to the CP290's memory.
	    this programs the CP290 to act on its own and the device need
	    not remain hooked up to the computer's serial port.

Both modes are invoked from the command line (tooltypes that match the
command line options are recognized for those who wish to use Workbench icons
instead of the CLI).  No GUI interface is present, although it wouldn't be
difficult to create a program that provided one and shelled out to CyberX10
to actually talk to the CP290.

CyberX10 lets you dim, turn on or turn off any unit in direct mode, set the
CP290's clock to that of the Amiga's system clock, set the CP290's base house
code, download events to the CP290's memory as well as upload them to the
Amiga.

The documentation for CyberX10 comes in the form of an AmigaGuide document.
