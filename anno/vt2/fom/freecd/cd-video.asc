Amiga freeCD: VideoTracker 2.0


With VideoTracker 2.0 you can make a videoclip around a ProTracker or
OctaMED module.
You can also let images react to your CD-player, or other
audio-input, with use of extra hardware.
You can use pictures, brushes, animations, animation-brushes,
palettes, colorcycle, routines (like Plasma, Rotate/Magnify), texts,
objects, vectorobjects, amigafonts, karafonts, landscapes, colorsets.
When the video is finished, you can save the module and video data
as a "Vidule".
A vidule is a crunchable executable file which plays the module
and the video.
You can make a small intro or a big house-demo.
You also can use VideoTracker with a GenLock and, for example, make
professional movie-titles with colorfonts.

When the module plays a sample, VideoTracker shows an "effect" on
screen.
This effect can be a picture, brush, anim, routine, etcetra. or a
combination of these.
You can edit for each of the 128 song-positions the 31 samples and
use up to 256 effects in a video.
All the explained effects are used in the example-videos.

VideoTracker works on PAL and NTSC Amigas.

The programm was originally released in 1994 as sharware (50 US-Dollar),
it is still copyrighted by Peter can Campen, but you can copy it for free.
Because of the age of the programm, it may run unstable on newer High-End-Amigas.

freeCD means that everybody is allowed to copy this cd and also to give it away.

The cd is available for 2,50 Euro:
