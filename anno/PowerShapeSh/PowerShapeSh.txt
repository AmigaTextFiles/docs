This is a Survey for Shapeshifter.

It was told, that Christian Bauer does not want any longer to do anything for
Shapeshifter. Maybe we can convince him, that there is MUCH INTEREST for
Shapeshifter still, especially for a PowerPC Version of Shapeshifter, using the
PowerUP Boards of Phase 5.

Please fill in this survey and send the results to 

Shapie@Birdland.es.bawue.de

It is short, but needed.


[ ] I will buy me a PowerUP Board.
[ ] I will buy p-OS when it is available.
[ ] I have not registrated Shapeshifter up to now, but would do so with the
    PowerPC version.
[ ] I already have registered Shapeshifter and would pay up to $30
    extra for the PowerPC version, even as i already payed for the
    680x0 version.
[ ] I have registered Shapeshifter and think a PowerPC Version had to come
    for free.
