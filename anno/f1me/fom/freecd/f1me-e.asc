FORMULA 1 MANAGER ENHANCED

...is an Amiga freeware cd-rom, which means that it is not only including
freeware-software, but also that the whole cd is free to copy and spread it
around. It is including the Formula 1 Manager,  a very good simulation for
1-3 players, original pilots, teams, sponsors and tracks, changing
weather-conditions, buying and selling of drivers and mechanics, development
of chassis and engines, ...

Beside that the cd is including a guide about 50 years Formula 1, a
database-programm, Workbench-backgrounds, a ray tracing-object, pictures,
photos, mpg-videos and an audiotrack.

The cd can ordered from me for 5 DM, 2,5 Euro or 2,5 US-Dollar (plus costs for
stamps and sending) for each one. Thanks to the low price it is ideal for
spontanous buying and an interesting new publication helping to wait for new
Amiga products. The cd-rom is completly free, so it is also allowed to copy it
by the retailer.

If you still have questions, I am glad to answer them,

with friendly greetings,
