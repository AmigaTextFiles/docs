DESCRIPTION

    Strux is a graphical editor for flowcharts.
    Flowcharts are an aid for designing programs with clear
    and easy structures. With Strux, you can create and edit
    them with your Amiga. The flowcharts can directly be used
    for implementation and documentation.

    Features:

    * design using "normal" flowcharts, Nassi-Shneiderman flowcharts
      or Pseudocode (you can switch between the representations at
      any time)

    * flowcharts can be saved as source code in any programming
      language. You can define the output format according to your
      personal style and requirements via a "translation table".

    * existing sourcecode in Pascal or C can be converted into a
      flowchart. (this is perfect for understanding programs written
      by other people and will also help you with debugging your
      own programs)

    * unlimited number of subroutine levels

    * it is possible to print flowcharts and to save them as common
      IFF images.

    * fonts are customizable 

    * context sensitive online help is included

    * all settings are made via menus and windows

    * complete keyboard control is possible to allow lucid work

    * very easy hard disk installation

    * detailed printed manual with many examples and tutorial

    * demo version available 


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Kickstart/Workbench 2.0 or higher is required.
