DESCRIPTION

        CLIExchange is a CLI replacement for the standard OS2.0+ utility
        called Exchange which is used to manage commodities.  The only
        difference is that Exchange has a graphical user interface while
        CLIExchange has been designed to be called from scripts,
        ToolManager menus or docks, hotkeys, BrowserII or whatever you
        want.  CLIExchange code is ten times smaller than Exchange,
        measuring only 592 bytes.

        All features of Exchange available.

        OS release 2.04 or newer is required.
