TITLE

     Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

VERSION

     Version 2.3a patchlevel 2

AUTHOR

     Amiga port and enhancements by Peter Simons <simons@peti.GUN.de>

DESCRIPTION

             Pretty Good(tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good
     Software, is a high security cryptographic software application for
     MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS, Amiga and other computers. PGP allows people
     to exchange files or messages with privacy, authentication, and
     convenience. Privacy means that only those intended to receive a
     message can read it. Authentication means that messages that appear
     to be from a particular person can only have originated from that
     person. Convenience means that privacy and authentication are
     provided without the hassles of managing keys associated with
     conventional cryptographic software. No secure channels are needed
     to exchange keys between users, which makes PGP much easier to use.
     This is because PGP is based on a powerful new technology called
     "public key" cryptography. And PGP performs the public-key
     functions faster than most other software implementations. PGP is
     public key cryptography for the masses.

             Please take note that the archive contains a readme file,
     with checksums for ALL files in the distribution and is signed with
     my key! Please be careful, if this file is missing or rigged!


CHANGES
             This version is re-compiled with SAS/C 6.50. A few minor
     bugs have been fixed. Additionally, the manual is now availabe in
     TexInfo style and can easily be converted into AmigaGuide,
     postscript, dvi or whatever format. AmigaGuide versions are
     included.

             Also for the first time, the alt.security.pgp frequently
     asked questions (FAQ) are included in the archive.
