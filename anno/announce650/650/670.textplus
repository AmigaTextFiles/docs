DESCRIPTION

    TeXt Plus Professional is a TeX frontend word processor. TeX is a
    professional freeware typesetting programm. The greatest problem of
    TeX for the average user was - up to now - TeX's complexity and the
    resulting difficulty to fast and efficiently create documents. This is
    where TPP starts to work.

    Now you just have to load a form sheet, which has to be modified at
    the respective places only. After this the file is compiled to a TeX-
    file by TPP, which then itself is processed by the TeX compiler. After
    both compilations either the previewer or the printer driver can be
    invoked.

    TPP cooperates with PasTeX, the freeware Amiga implementation of TeX
    written by Georg Hessmann, and with AmigaTeX ((c) Radical Eye
    Software). Among TPP's features are tables, staggered lists,
    mailmerge, footnotes, inclusion of graphics, an ARexx-port (122
    commands) and full OS2.xx/3.xx compatibility. You can make use of all
    functions of TeX, even if they are not supported directly, e. g. there
    is no editor for mathematical formulae, yet.

    TPP combines its user friendliness with the typesetting power of TeX
    in order to open the world of TeX to a totally new group of users.

    TPP is not only a TeX frontend. You can also use it as a normal editor
    and print files via the printer.device.

NEW FEATURES

    - AmigaTeX is from now on supported.
    - user definable menus, keymap, and macros
    - completely localized (available languages: english, deutsch)
    - clipboard support
    - AppWindow, AppIcon
    - 11 new ARexx commands (total number of commands now: 122)

HARD- AND SOFTWARE-REQUIREMENTS

    - Amiga OS 2.04
    - at least. 2 MB RAM
    - at least.1,5 MB hard disk space
      (10MB when working with TeX)
    - PasTeX V1.3 or AmigaTeX

NOTE TO REGISTERED USERS

    I decided not to inform all registered users about the release of this
    version. Instead of this all users already registered for 4.xx can get
    a free update by sending me their PGP public key via e-mail. They will
    get an encrypted TPP-keyfile in return, which prevents the nerve-
    racking requester form popping up.
