  DESCRIPTION
  
       MultiVol(TM) splits and joins files. The split files can be placed
       on diskettes, hard disks (including removable), or RAM -- or any
       combination of them. Splitting and joining are transparent to a
       program, so almost all programs that use files can split a file on
       output or join split file parts on input, without "knowing" that
       splitting or joining is occurring.
  
       Using MultiVol, you can:
  
       *  put a large file on diskettes or removable hard drives
  
          Other Amiga owners or service shops can join the file parts
          WITHOUT MultiVol.
  
       *  reuse ARexx(TM) procedures
  
          MultiVol will join your procedures to the main program in a way
          that looks like one complete file to ARexx.
  
       *  download a file too big to fit on one diskette to multiple
          diskettes
  
       *  spread a file across the remaining disk space on multiple disks

       *  control splitting by remaining disk space, percentage of
          available disk space, exact byte amounts, or percentage of
          original file size (if known)
  
       *  discard parts of the file
  
          Joining will create a file of only the retained parts.
  
  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
  
       *  AmigaDOS/Kickstart(TM) 2.04 or higher
