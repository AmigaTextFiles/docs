DESCRIPTION

     Colonial Conquest is a space strategy game for one or
     two persons. The aim of each player is to colonialize a
     maximum of the 26 earth-like planets that are shown on
     the universe map. Every planet has its own surface map
     composed of oceans, forests, mountains, deserts etc.
     where different machines (power-plants, irrigation
     robots, space port etc.) have to be built to guarantee
     a rapid growth and a high production of the colony.
     People can direct the machines or work as scientists
     which will make the technology level rise and allow new
     inventions (battlestars, planet scanners, energy
     cannons etc.).
     Five different types of space ships will compose each
     player's army and conquer planets for him.
     The game is easy to handle as it has an intuitive,
     mouse-based interface. It also has decent graphics with
     some rendered HAM images.
