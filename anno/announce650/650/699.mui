TITLE

     MUI - MagicUserInterface

RELEASE

     2.0

AUTHOR

     Stefan Stuntz  (stuntz@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

SHORT

     A system to create and maintain GUIs.

DESCRIPTION

     MUI is an object oriented system to create and maintain
     graphical user interfaces. From a programmers point of view,
     using MUI saves a lot of time and makes life much easier.
     Thinking about complicated terms like window resizing or
     font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

     On the other hand, users of MUI based applications have the
     ability to customize nearly every pixel of a programs
     interface according to their personal taste.

     This distribution is interesting for both, users and
     programmers. Please have a look at the supplied demo
     programs and at the documentation to see what MUI has to
     offer.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     MUI requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.
     For developers, MUI comes with C, Oberon, Modula, Amiga-E
     and Assembler interfaces.

NEW FEATURES

     MUI 2.0 offers a new library layout which results in
     a resonable speed increase. New frame and background
     designs make GUIs look a lot better. Lots of new
     classes and attributes are available for programmers,
     in addition to documentation on writing custom classes.
