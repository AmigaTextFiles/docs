DESCRIPTION

     MUIProCalc is a MUI-based calculator much like Jimmy Yang`s
     Calc 3.0. It still lacks the plotter, but it offers a quite
     flexible history facility for inserting previously entered
     expressions. Different output formats offered and plenty of
     functions the user may choose from. Furthermore the look
     of the calculator may be customized. ARexx Port for ease of
     calculating from within an editor. Some functions are able to
     return TeX compatible output. Results or inputs may be copied
     to the Clipboard.

     MUIProCalc comes with a fancy GUI you may configure to your needs.
     Function gadgets may be flipped through using pages so that they
     don`t eat up too much of space. MUIProCalc supports an input/output
     history you may configure so that you may re-insert previously entered
     expressions/results. History entries may be copied to a userdefiniable
     clipboard unit. It features various display/output bases such as decimal,
     hexadecimal, octal, and binary and of course calculation sizes ranging
     from 8 Bit to 32 Bit width. Angles may be displayed as radiants or
     degrees. MUIProCalc offers an ARexx port you may use to calc expressions
     externally. These commands are able to return TeX compatible output
     such as "1\cdot 10^{-5}". It comes with two example scripts for use
     with CED Pro.

NEW FEATURES

     - ARexx Port added so that you may calculate expressions from
       within an editor. Some ARexx functions may return TeX compatible
       output which may be directly used within a mathematical TeX
       environment

     - Calculation problems fixed

     - You may copy history lines to the Clipboard now

     - Some more shortcuts
