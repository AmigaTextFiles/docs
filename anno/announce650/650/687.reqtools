SHORT

     ReqTools 2.2a - the requester toolkit library

DESCRIPTION

     reqtools.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.
     The purpose of ReqTools is to make it a lot quicker and easier
     to build standard requesters into your programs.  ReqTools is
     designed with Commodore's style guidelines in mind, all
     requesters have the look-and-feel of AmigaDOS Release 2.

     ReqTools features the following requesters:  a query requester,
     a string requester, a number requester, a file requester, a
     font requester, a palette requester, a volume requester and a
     screenmode requester.

     Also included are RTPatch (1.3) and RexxReqTools (1.2e):

     RTPatch is a small program that will re-route functions from
     most popular requester libraries to ReqTools.  Libraries
     currently supported are Arp, Req and Asl.  RTPatch will also
     patch some functions in Intuition to give you improved system
     requesters.

     RexxReqTools gives ARexx users easy access to a large family of
     requesters.  All requesters are easy to use; they require one
     or no arguments.  But the requesters also have a lot of power
     through several optional arguments and through tagstrings.
     RexxReqTools itself doesn't implement any of these requesters,
     it is a link between ARexx and ReqTools.

NEW FEATURES

     o Bug fix: on Kickstart 3.0 (V39) the palette requester's
       slider values were sometimes incorrectly displayed (palette
       requester will now only use GTJ_RIGHT on V40 or higher).

     o Bug fix: if no locale.library was found (Workbench 2.04)
       the file and font requesters would display a 'D' instead of
       the file/font size.

     o Bug fix: rtSpread() now handles the case where the total
       size of all objects is larger than the total available size
       correctly (objects will overlap in this case of course).

     o Quirk fix: file requester will no longer overlap the button
       gadgets when they get too wide for the screen (german locale
       and lores screen for example).  It will scale the buttons in
       size to make them fit.

     o Screenmode requester will no longer fail silently if the
       current mode is invalid.  It now simply picks the first mode
       id from the current list of modes.

     o Changed display mode filtering code slightly to fix the
       problem with Picasso II monitor 2.14 (or higher) modes not
       showing up in the screenmode requester.
