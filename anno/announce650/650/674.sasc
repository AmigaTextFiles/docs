DESCRIPTION

     This patch fixes many problems found in the 6.50 release of the SAS/C
     Development System with C++ for the Amiga.

     All owners of SAS/C 6.50 should download and apply this patch at
     their earliest convenience.

NEW FEATURES

     Only one new feature added.  There is a new predefined symbol,
     __AMIGADATE__ which will supply the current date in the format
     required for the Amiga VERSION strings.  More details in the package.

     Several bugs were fixed, including Enforcer hits in the compiler and
     CPR, CXERRs cleaned up, unsigned comparisons are now done correctly,
     bitfields are now back to the way they were in 6.3 (almost - see
     README in archive for details), the SCSETUP utility no longer crashes
     when run from Workbench, etc., etc.
