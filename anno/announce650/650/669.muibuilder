DESCRIPTION

     MUI-Builder is an application builder for MUI programs.  It will
     allow beginners and other programmers to build their Graphic User
     Interface very easily.

     It generates C or E code for MUI.

     With the many options of MUI-Builder, you will be able to
     generate precisely the part of the source code you really want,
     and not only the whole interface.  This will permit you to easily
     maintain your code whithout losing your previously modified
     program, each time you change your interface.  Moreover you will
     be able to design the inline hypertext guide from MUI-Builder by
     attaching a help text to each GUI-Object of your interface.  The
     builder will be able to create the AmigaGuide documentation
     automatically.
