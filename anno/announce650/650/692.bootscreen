TITLE

     BootScreen - replace that boring black screen during startup!

VERSION

     BootScreen 2.00/BootScreen Preferences 2.00

AUTHOR

     Joseph Luk <jluk@ctp.org>     (GEnie)J.LUK
     
DESCRIPTION

     BootScreen allows you to display a picture of your choice during
     your startup, replacing the black screen that usually greets you
     until the Workbench comes up.  In addition to the aesthetic
     benefits, it's also useful to have the picture there: with it, you
     can tell when you're booting from your hard disk and that the boot
     procedure is going correctly.
     
     
NEW FEATURES

     Version 2.00 has been completely rewritten from scratch.  Some of
     the new features are:
     
      * Overscan support
      * Automatic screen centering
      * ECS/OCS support (still fully supports AGA)
      * PAL support
      * Synchronous loading -- no more wasted seek time!
      * Extremely user-friendly Preferences editor for configuration
      * Installer scripts for Install, Remove (UnInstall), and Upgrade
        actions.  No more bothering with editing your startup-sequence!
      * Operation completely controllable via GUI.  
      * Better optimized code.
      

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     * Workbench release 2.04 or greater.  Fully supports AGA/3.x.
     * Hard disk recommended.
