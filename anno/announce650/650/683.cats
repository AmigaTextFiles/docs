		     The Amiga Programming Manuals
                     =============================

Non-registered developers must purchase their Amiga RKM and AmigaDOS
manuals through bookstores or from the publishers.  Dept C does not sell
these manuals.  These manuals cover Release 2.0.  To program newer
2.1 or 3.x features, use the 2.0 programming methods shown in these
manuals plus the new functions and flags covered in the tutorials,
autodocs, and examples on the 3.1 Amiga Developer Update disks.

		Workbench, Includes, and AmigaCD Licenses

Developers who wish to distribute files/commands from Workbench
or the C/Asm Include files on their commercial product MUST have
a license to do so.  Distribution of the items in PD, shareware, or
freely redistributable form is not allowed.  Licenses may be requested
through your local Amiga support organization, or through
CATS - Licenses, 1200 Wilson Drive, West Chester, PA., 19380.

Licenses are available for Workbench 1.3, Workbench 2.0, Workbench 2.1,
Workbench 3.0, Includes 1.3, Includes 2.0, Includes 3.0, and Includes 3.1.
In addition, an amendment is available for 1.3 Workbench license-holders
to distribute 2.04 (37.x) iffparse.library.

If you are developing a CD product for any Amiga CD platform, you
must have an AmigaCD license.  AmigaCD licensees receive tools for
creating bootable AmigaCD products, and may access our closed AmigaCD
conferences on our developer networks.  An AmigaCD license may be
requested through CATS Licenses (address below).

To request license forms, be sure to specify which license(s) and
amendments(s) you require and include your full SURFACE MAIL address
including country.  Licensing generally costs $100/year for Workbench,
$25/year for Includes/Libs.

Developer archives for the original Installer and original Amigaguide
are available on the nets and on BIX in amiga.dev/listings.  These archives
include a print/sign/send free license for distribution of these products.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

		    Official Developer Conferences

Our primary goal is to support developers who are registered in our Amiga
developer programs.  However, some support for non-registered develepers
may also be found in the open Amiga developer conferences on the
same networks where our closed support areas are located.

BIX: amiga.dev (open); amiga.cert and amiga.com (open only to registered
	Certified and Commercial developers); amiga.cd32 (open only to
	AmigaCD licensees).  Registered developers and AmigaCD licensees
	will find instructions for requesting access to closed BIX
	conferences in the amiga.dev/instructions topic.

UUCP: comp.sys.amiga.* (open); adsp.* (open only to registered Certified
	and Commercial developers in Europe via their support program);
	adsp.cd32.* (open only to AmigaCD licensees).

CIX (UK): amiga.* (open); adsp.* (open only to registered Certified
	and Commercial developers); nv.beta (open only to AmigaCD
	licensees)

Additional independent Amiga user and developer areas may also be found
on most popular commercial BBS systems including Genie and Compuserve.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

		     Amiga Example Code and Tools
		     ============================

1. 3.1 Amiga Developer Update (see Materials list).  Contains example
   code for new 2.1 (V38) and V39 (3.0) features.

2. 2.0 Native Developer Update (see Materials list).  Contains the
   all of the 2.0 Devcon code examples and 2.0 AmigaMail code
   examples.

   A new V39 version of the NewIFF code which supports AA is available
   to registered developers in our closed BIX, ADSP, and CIX conferences.
   This code requires iffparse.library (note - the 2.04 iffparse.library is
   1.3 compatible).

4. Fish Disks 741 and 742 contain 4 archives of 2.0 RKM Companion Code
   (all of the 2.0 Rom Kernel Manual code examples).  Fish Disk 344
   contains the previous 1.3 "RKMCompanion" code.

5. Debugging Tools - 3.1 Native Developer Update (see Materials list).
   Some updated tools (usually latest Enforcer and Mungwall) are also
   submitted to Fred Fish as released.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	        Reporting Bugs and Requesting Enhancements

Bug reports and enhancement requests may be submitted electronically
in "Report" format only.  The Amiga "Report" program for generating
bug reports and enhancement requests is provided on the 3.1 Amiga
Developer Update disks, and is also on Fish Disk 920.

Mail bug reports in Report format to: bugs@commodore.com
Mail enhancement requests in Report format to: suggestions@commodore.com

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Registered Amiga Developer Programs

Developers who have or are developing commercial products for the
Amiga should participate in one of our registered developer programs.
The programs vary country by country, but generally provide hardware
discounts on development systems, access to pre-release developer
materials, and the ability to access closed electronic conferences.

There are different programs at varying cost and level of support.  

Developers in the US and Canada may request a developer program application
by mailing to the following address and requesting a developer application,
and including their own name and full SURFACE MAIL address.  Developers in
other countries should contact their local Commodore branch for information
on developer programs.
