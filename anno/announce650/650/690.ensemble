DESCRIPTION

        Ensemble Verbes is a program to help students practise
        and master French verbs in the most common tenses of the
        language.  It is designed to support classroom work, not

        * Over 75 verbs, including -er, -ir, -re, reflexive and
          irregular conjugations

        * Seven tenses: present, compound past, imperfect,
          future, conditional, subjunctive past and present
          participle

        * Full online, context-sensitive help via AmigaGuide tm

        * Close adherence to Amiga User Interface Style Guide

        * Sound support

        * Support for international keyboards

        * Locale support

        Registered users can also obtain The French Student's
        Dictionary & Guide, a 150-page book featuring:

        * French/English and English/French sections

        * Most commonly used vocabulary, in context

        * Many easy-to-understand examples to help in
          selection of vocabulary

        * Many idiomatic expressions

        * Regular and irregular verb charts

        * Reference grammar guide

        * Over 5500 entries
