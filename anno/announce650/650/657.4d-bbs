SUPPORT

	Support is available via several electronic means.  These include
	newsgroups such as Comp.sys.amiga.datacomm, and fidonet echos.
     Alternatlely internet and fidonet e-mail maybe used, or any 4D-BBS
     support BBS (see above for number).  Lastly, voice techincal 
     support IS available, but we can sometimes be difficult to get a
     hold of.  Email is much faster and easier.
	

DESCRIPTION

    4D-BBS is a very powerful BBS which centers on ease of use without
    sacraficing power.  It is COMPLETLY customizable, including menus,
    actualy menu commands, all text files, and all string the BBS
    display.  It IS possible to support multiple language, but we only
    supply a strings file in English.

    Network support is built into 4D-BBS with the goal to NOT import
    messages, but to rather read native message formats.  This includes
    FTN *.msg format for Fidonet and RFC-812 message format for Usenet.
    Tosser and Mailer software for Fidonet is NOT included with 4D-BBS,
    but it is compatible with most of the PD and shareware fidonet
    software avaialble.  UUCP support is achieved with the freedly
    available AmigaUUCP package.
    
    File transfers include XPR Protocol support, file marking with
    the ability to upload and download multiple files (as long as the
    protocol supports it).  File may be searched by section or in the
    entire file list, and multiple, different file lists are supported.
    CD-ROM support is also included, and usually very easy to add
    sections from a CD-ROM, as it can read the text description files
    normally included with CD-ROM (like the 00_Index.TXT files on the
    Aminet CD-ROM).

    Multi line on a single computer and multiple computers (using a
    file system network such as Envoy) is supported. 4D-BBS is very
    system friendly, and the Sysop can work on the system, change
    options, etc, without disturbing the on-line user.  All editors
    run from the CLI and can be ran from remote for complete remote
    access of the BBS, and the computer the BBS is ran on.
    
    Door support includes Paragon, ARexx, and FIFO.  4D-BBS has a
    very comprehensive ARexx port which allows scripts to be written
    to accomplish complex functions which are not directly available
    from a menu command.
    
    The hooks for incoming fax support is included, but you will need
    a third party fax program for 4D-BBS to spawn (like GPFax).
    Command accounts are also supported, which allows such things as
    UUCICO spawning for incoming UUCP calls, and other dos spawns
    which should not actually "log onto" the BBS.  4D is also
    spawnable from another program which has control of the serial
    port (such as TrapDoor).

    (The Demo version of the BBS only allows for 5 file and message
    sections, and 30 minuted on-line.  Other than that, its works
    just like the registered version, no requestors or annoying
    flashing demo lights!).
