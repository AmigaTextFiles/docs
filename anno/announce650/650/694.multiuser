TITLE

     MultiUser

RELEASE

     1.6

AUTHOR

     Geert Uytterhoeven

SHORT

     A protection system for several users

DESCRIPTION

       MultiUser allows you to create a *IX-like environment where
     several users live together in harmony, unable to delete each
     others files, unable to read those private love-letters of other
     users ...  And this even if several users are working on the
     machine at the same time (on a terminal hooked up to the serial
     port) ...
     People without a valid login ID and password won't be able to
     access files you have made private with MultiUser.  If you make
     all files private (not readable for others), the only useful
     thing they could do, is boot from a floppy ...

NEW FEATURES

     - Improved non-binding assigns (e.g.  HOME:  points always to
       your home directory, even if several users are using the same
       computer at the same time).

     - Some external utilities added.

     - Source of the library added.

     - Some other improvements...

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - AmigaOS Release 2.04 (V37+) or higher.

     - A Rigid Disk Block compatible hard drive/controller.

     - reqtools.library V38+ ((c) Nico Francois).
