COMPANY

	none


AUTHOR

	Henning Schmiedehausen (barnard@forge.franken.de)


DESCRIPTION

     MailMarker is a Multi-Mailfolder Watcher.  It shows you, whether
     your mailbox on your system contains no mail, old mail or if new
     mail arrived.  It can watch one or more (up to 32) different
     mailboxes.  Each mailbox is represented by an AppIcon on your
     Workbench.  Images for no, old and new mail are free selectable.


REQUIREMENTS

	Any Amiga, running AmigaOS 2.04 or beyond.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     You should have some kind of electronic mail system installed,
     which delivers mail into a file on a local filesystem.  Every UUCP
     or IP Mailsystem should be fine.  (Dillon UUCP, wUUCP, AmigaUUCP+
     etc.).  Else this program is pretty useless...  :-)
