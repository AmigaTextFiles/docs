DESCRIPTION

    HWGRCS is a port of RCS 5.6[.0.1] done with SAS/C 6.3.

    The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
    of  files.   RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
    identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
    text that is revised frequently, for example programs, docu-
    mentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

    For upgraders from the old RCS 4.x on Fish 281/282:

        - HWGRCS supports the RCS_link feature
        - No problems with non-ASCII characters

    Special features:

        - File pattern expansion in all RCS commands
        - Support for .a,.asm,.i,.fd,.guide,.ps extensions.
        - GNU DIFF 2.6, GNU patch 2.1 and a N*rton like LP utility.
        - I try to _support_ HWGRCS.


NEW FEATURES

    New since patch level 5:

    - "-d" and "-M" should now (finally) be truly fixed.
    - HWGRCS now uses the POSIX compliant "-x/,v".
    - LP overhauled.

    ENHANCEMENTS:

    - locale.libray is now supported for TZ handling.
    - Limited Un*x filename support on the command line possible.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    V37, >1MB suggested, HD required.


HOST NAME

    Any Aminet site, e.g. ftp.uni-paderborn.de   (131.234.2.32) for users
    in germany.


DIRECTORY

    /pub/aminet/dev/misc

FILE NAMES

    HWGRCSp6f.lha
    HWGRCSsrcp6f.lha

PRICE

    I don't declare it shareware as it is GNU SW, but donations/gifts for
    my support are quite welcome! Donations in physical form preferred.
    Support ~ Gifts, especially for commercial users.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

    RCS is distributable under the Gnu Public License.

    For my support of HWGRCS I won't bill you, but I ask for donations (Hear
    me, commercial users? :-).

OTHER

    No bug reports for >~3 months. Did I finally catch them all? Report
    them for patch 7!
