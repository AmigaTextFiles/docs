DESCRIPTION

     Textra is the User-Friendly text editor for the Amiga.
     It contains a fully-Intuitionized GUI as well as an
     ARexx interface with 70+ commands.  The package
     interfaces with the asl file and font requesters,
     supports multiple windows with cut, copy and paste
     to the clipboard.  Also supported are Undo and Drag-select
     with left mouse button, background printing and ARexx
     script execution, user-settable preferences which can
     be saved.  The editor displays fast text and
     continuous-movement vertical and horizontal scroll bars.

     The package contains full, detailed documentation,
     40+ Arexx scripts (including an interactive tutorial)
     and a hard disk installer program.

     Scripts are provided to integrate Textra with
     JForth Professional 3.x, SAS/C, HSPascal and Paul Kienitz's
     Q-Blue Offline Mail Reader program.

NEW FEATURES

   o  Textra now includes a full-featured interface to the popular 
      SAS/C development environment, developed and generously
      contributed by one of SAS Institute's own!
   o  The new MARKS facility allows you to assign any selected 
      text to a logical name of up to 31 chars long.  Any number 
      of assignments can be made.
   o  Users may now opt to use the ASL File requester in place of 
      the native Textra file requester.  Default is the Asl requester.
   o  Under 2.0 or later, the CUT, COPY and PASTE functions now 
      operate with the standard clipboard device (unit 0).
   o  This is the first version to be low-memory-failure-proof! 
      ANY MEMORY REQUEST FAILURE WILL FLASH THE SCREEN 3 TIMES in 
      1 second, then wait until the memory comes available.
   o  Textra now supports just about any mail reader known to
      Amiga-Man!  Textra 1.15 sports both a command-line option
      as well as an ARexx command which tell Textra to
      "hold" the calling program until the specified window
      is closed.
   o  Program now takes note if a file is MSDOS format or Amiga 
      format and will preserve the format when saved.
   o  Added the ability to write-protect a window so that it 
      cannot be accidentally altered while open.
   o  Before you SAVE a file over an existing disk file, Textra 
      now performs some checks that nothing else has messed with 
      the file on disk while the editor has held a copy in ram.
   o  Under 2.0 and later, Textra will display the 2.x-style 
      'busy pointer'.
   o  14 new ARexx commands, 12 new scripts
   o  Bugs fixed
