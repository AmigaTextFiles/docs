TITLE

     PowerSnap

RELEASE

     2.2

SHORT

     Snap and paste anywhere using the mouse.

DESCRIPTION

       PowerSnap is a utility that allows you to use the mouse to
     mark characters anywhere on the screen and paste them somewhere
     else, like in the CLI or in a string gadget.

       PowerSnap will check what font is used in the window you snap
     from and will look for the position of the characters
     automatically.  It recognizes all non proportional fonts of up
     to 24 pixels wide and of any height so this should cover most
     fonts used.  Snapping and pasting text is done using the mouse,
     making PowerSnap fast and easy to use.
     
NEW FEATURES

     o PowerSnap has been fully localized and has been made
       completely font-sensitive.

     o New 'Save Settings' menu item.  Allows you to save the current
       settings to PowerSnap's icon.

     o Made PowerSnap more RTG friendly.  Snapping should now work
       under the Workbench emulation of the Piccolo and EGS Spectrum
       graphic cards (not tested).

     o Some programs use an extra pixel of spacing between their text
       lines.  PowerSnap will try to sniff this out and will try to
       adjust itself to this.

     o When asked to quit PowerSnap will now check the return code
       from SetFunction() when removing its Intuition patches, rather
       than directly peeking into the library's jump table.  Should
       work perfectly with SetMan now.

     o Improved speed of text pasting.

     o New command line switch and tooltype: CLIPUNIT.

     o Due to very popular demand I added crawling ants to PowerSnap.

     o PowerSnap now uses iffparse.library for the clipboard I/O.

     o Removed all (but one) Intuition patches and implemented a new
       anti-deadlock mechanism.  Snapping will be aborted when a
       deadlock occurs (for example a program opening a window while
       you are snapping).

     o Some bugs fixed.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS Release 2.04 (V37+) or higher.
