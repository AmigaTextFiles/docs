DESCRIPTION

    `Phonebill' is, simply said, a logfile analyser. What it basically
    does is scan the logfile(s) generated by a terminal program or a
    mailer, extract all information about calls you have made by using 
    your modem, and store this in its own (short) format. Features:

    * Requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

    * Supports new 3.0 features (new look menus, ...).

    * Nice gadtools compliant GUI.

    * User-definable callrates, supporting  rate exceptions for certain
     days and dates. Handles fees and time-units with up to 4 decimals
     (e.g.  $1.2344 dollars per 30.5678 seconds) for extra accuracy.

    * Supports logfiles generated by:
        * AmigaUUCP Timelog
        * JrComm
        * MagiCall
        * MicroDot
        * MultiFax professional
        * NComm
        * TrapDoor
        * TrapFax
        * Term (Term action-log and Term call-log)
        * Terminus

    * Automatical logfile truncating.

    * Generates miscellaneous reports: statistics, total costs, etc.

    * Context-sensitive online help.

NEW FEATURES

    * New callrate feature: least costs.

    * The statistics have been improved and new statistics have been
      added (hourly activity).

    * Bugfix: the calls in the binary logfile weren't always sorted
      chronologically.

    * Added MicroDot support.

    * Added TrapFax support.

    * Due to the use of the quotes when running the textviewer you
      couldn't specify any commandline arguments (e.g. "WatchIt -i").
      This has been fixed.
