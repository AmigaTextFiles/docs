DESCRIPTION

	FastLife is an Amiga implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

	In 1970 John Horton Conway invented the game of Life.  Conway's goal
	was to create a board "game" with simple rules that would exhibit
	complex behavior.

	The desire to combine the speed of Tom Rokicki's blitter Life
	routines with an Intuition interface, and access to many of the
	classic Life patterns, led to the development of FastLife.

	Features:

	   Full Intuition interface
           Uses Tomas Rokicki's ultra-fast Life v6.2 routines
           Random field creation
           Torus option
	   Any screen width and height (dependent on memory and mode)
	   Screen mode and screen size requester
	   Speed control
	   Run for a specified number of generations
	   Run to a specified generation
	   Runs from Workbench and CLI
