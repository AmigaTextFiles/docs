DESCRIPTION

    PackIt is a CLI only program to replace the crunch and decrunch commands
    that came with PowerPacker (Copyright Nico Francois).

    PackIt features:
        1) Single command for crunching and decrunching
        2) PackIt will automatically crunch or decrunch a data file depending
           on whether it is allready crunched or not.
        3) Password can be specified as a shell option, or you can use a
           string requester.
        4) PackIt will not crunch executables, unless told to do so.
           Note: PackIt will only crunch the executables as a data file
                 you will not be able to run them.
        5) PackIt will automaticly replace the source file unless a 
	   destination is given.
        6) PackIt can take a dir as a destination, in that case it will 
	   crunch/decrunch the files into that dir.
        7) Allows wildcard [de]crunching with dir recursion.
