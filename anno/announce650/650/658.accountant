DESCRIPTION

	The Home Accountant allows one to keep track of any type of
	account one may use in the home.  This includes checking,
	savings, mutual funds, and more.  Along with it's record keeping
	features, one may use it to budget any revenue/expenses which
	flow through an account.  One may also group accounts into 
	what is called a transaction base to compute net worth and 
	obtain batch printings.

	This release is compiled with Amos Pro 2.0, which fixes a
	number of bugs the last binary release inherited from Amos 
	Creator.  (Now works with screen blankers! :)

	This release also includes the source so anyone who has an old
	copy of THA can ditch it entirely without fuss.
