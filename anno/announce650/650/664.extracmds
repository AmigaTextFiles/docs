TITLE

    ExtraCmds

VERSION

    Public Release 2.1

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

    ExtraCmds is a collection of AmigaDOS Shell commands.

    This release contains the following commands:

        o Common    reports lines common to two files.
        o Compare   compares two files.
        o Concat    concatenates and prints files.
        o Copyright prints embedded copyright messages.
        o Count     counts chars, words, and lines.
        o DirTree   prints directory trees.
        o Find      is a very powerful Swiss Army Knife style
                    file finder with an ARexx interface. It is
                    similar to Unix find.
        o Head      prints the first few lines of files.
        o Lower     runs a command at another priority.
        o Prepare   extracts words from text files.
        o Split     cuts a file to pieces.
        o SplitName splits file names into their components.
        o Tee       is a pipe fitting.
        o TestBits  is for testing file protection bits
                    in scripts.
        o TimeCom   times a command.
        o Unique    removes copies of identical lines.
        o Usage     shows the space used by directories.

    The text processing commands are able to read from their
    standard input, and/or write to their standard output, making
    it possible to use them as filters in a shell that supports
    pipes.

    The package is available in two forms: A full distribution
    that includes the full source and documentation, and a small,
    binary, one, that contains only the seventeen executables and
    the formatted manual pages.
