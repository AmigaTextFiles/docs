DESCRIPTION

    HWGRCS is a port of GNU RCS 5.6.0.1 done with SAS/C 6.51.

    The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
    of  files.   RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
    identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for
    text that is revised frequently, for example programs, docu-
    mentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

    For upgraders from the old RCS 4.x on Fish 281/282:

        - HWGRCS supports the RCS_link feature
        - No problems with non-ASCII characters

    Special features:

        - File pattern and response file expansion in all RCS commands.
        - Support for .a,.asm,.i,.fd,.guide,.ps extensions.
        - GNU DIFF 2.6, GNU patch 2.1 and a N*rton like LP utility.
        - AmigaGuide. docs.
        - I try to _support_ HWGRCS.


NEW FEATURES

    New since patch level 6:

    - response file expansion.
    - Full AmigaGuide. docs.

    Bugs fixed since level 6:

    - diff3 does handle args for diff correctly now.
    - Working filename extensions should be handled correctly now.
    - $Source$ keyword should no longer mess up the path.
    - HWGRCS should work well with AS225 now.
    - rcsfreeze is a lot smarter about repository files.
    - rcsclean works without arguments now.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    V37, >1MB suggested, HD required.


HOST NAME

    Any Aminet site, e.g. ftp.uni-paderborn.de   (131.234.2.32) for users
    in germany. Please use the site that is closest to you.


DIRECTORY

    /pub/aminet/dev/misc

FILE NAMES

    HWGRCSp7f.lha       Binaries and full AmigaGuide. docs
    HWGRCSsrcp7f.lha    The sources
    HWGRCSmanp7f.lha    The ASCII unix man pages for RCS

PRICE

    I don't declare it shareware as it is GNU SW, but donations/gifts for
    my support are quite welcome! Donations in physical form preferred.
    Support ~ Gifts, especially for commercial users.


DISTRIBUTABILITY

    RCS is distributable under the Gnu Public License.

    For my support of HWGRCS I won't bill you, but I ask for donations (Hear
    me, commercial users? :-).
