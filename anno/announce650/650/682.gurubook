PRODUCT

    The Amiga Guru Book

AUTHOR

    Ralph Babel

DESCRIPTION

    (These are excerpts from the two reviews posted to
    comp.sys.amiga.reviews in December.)

   "The Amiga Guru Book is probably the ultimate programming
    reference for the Amiga.  It details the inner workings
    of the commercial C compilers, the OS, and places
    special emphasis on DOS and related topics.  Lots of
    usable source code provides a practical, hands-on
    approach."

   "It offers fundamental knowledge of the Amiga system and
    covers such areas as: guidelines for proper multitasking
    programming, ANSI C, Aztec C and SAS/C, debugging
    techniques, AmigaDOS, the file systems, the format of
    load and object modules, process creation, CLI and user
    shells, handlers and packets (more than complete list of
    packets), and many other areas.  There are many useful
    bits and pieces about the OS that you'd have a hard time
    finding anywhere else."
