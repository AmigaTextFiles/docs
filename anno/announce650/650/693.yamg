TITLE

     Y.A.M.G.   (Yet Another Mandlebrot Generator)

VERSION

     Version 2.05 (first official internet release)

AUTHOR

     Steven Goodwin (S.Goodwin1@lut.ac.uk)

SHORT

     A feature packed mandelbrot generator written in AMOS.

DESCRIPTION

     This mandelbrot generator draws fractal images (pretty pictures) using
     mathematical formulae of complex numbers. It performs an iterative
     calculation on an X-Y complex plane, and plots a colour depending on
     the iterations taken to exceed a set limit. Although often difficult to
     compute, YAMG removes the difficultly by providing a good WB 2 style
     interface with lots of buttons to press :) It also contains stacks of 
     editting/zoom features and a 'workscreen'.

FEATURES

     o Works in lo-res (2/4/8/16/32 cols), hi-res (2/4/8/16 cols) and EHB modes

     o Full overscan up to 1023 x 1023 (memory permitting) in all modes
     
     o 8 internal memories for use while working on zooms

     o WB2 style interface 

     o Powerful editting/zoom facilities

     o Palette rotator and editor

     o Workscreen for complete fractal control

     o 7 fractal types (inc Mandel/Julia/Z3/Internal)

     o 20+ demos

     o Built-in help pages

     o Full load and save in IFF and packed picture bank (.abk) form.


REQUIREMENTS

     o An Amiga. Any that runs compiled AMOS programs will do

     o Better CPU for better rendering times (obviously)
