DESCRIPTION

        The Twilight Development System (TDS) provides an integrated 
        programming environment for writing and compiling source files 
        like Turbo Pascal or Borland C++. The main program of the 
        package is a powerful text editor called Twilight Editor (Ted) 
        which includes an integrated project manager. This project 
        manager simplifies and speeds up the development of programs 
        composed of different source files (modules). With TDS it's 
        possible to compile and link these modules into an executable 
        file with a single command and if the compiler finds some 
        errors, they will be reported directly by the editor. TDS 
        doesn't provide its own compiler, but can use any compiler or 
        assembler callable from Shell. It can interface directly with 
        many common compilers like DICE C, SAS C (former Lattice C), 
        Aztec C, DevPac, A68k, PCQ, HCC, GNU-C, Amiga-E, Oberon and 
        even programs like TeX, CatComp and MakeInfo. If the compiler 
        is not supported, it's possible to write a little interface 
        program to convert the error messages in a format readable by 
        the editor. The compile process will be executed concurrently 
        using another program called Twilight Make (TMake), so the 
        user can continue to edit the source files while the compiler 
        is working.

        The Twilight Editor (Ted) has many functions to support the 
        creating and editing of source files. The number of files 
        which can be open at the same time is limited only by the 
        amount of free memory and so is the length of a single text 
        file and line. For every file Ted remembers every change done 
        and allows an unlimited Undo and Redo. It also handles 
        horizzontal and vertical blocks (Cut, Copy, Paste). The user 
        can set and jump to bookmarks and search and replace strings 
        in the file. There is also a reference command to quickly get 
        information about autodocs functions and structure 
        definitions. Other features are complete customization of the 
        keyboard bindings, automatic saving, user selectable screen 
        mode and font type, ARexx port.
