TITLE

	"BLAZE ON, 1993":  a collection of Amiga-related humor


VERSION

	3.14159...


COMPANY

	BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED


AUTHOR

	Daniel Barrett


DESCRIPTION

	Despite popular demand, here is a set of humorous articles that I
posted in the comp.sys.amiga newsgroups during 1993.  The set includes such
forgettable classics as:

	o	The "Let's BLAZE A Great Deal" game show!
	o	"The Case of the Detonating Disk Heads" murder mystery!
	o	Strip poker, the BLAZEMONGER way!
	o	Commodore's new nuclear waste disposal program!
	o	The wild and wacky BLAZE-FEST '93 in California!
	o	The TRUE story behind the "insider conference" on GEnie!
	o	OrgASM, the ultimate assembly language system!
	o	A tour of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED and its unusual employees!
	o	Several April Fools jokes from comp.sys.amiga.reviews!
	o	BLAZE-24, the ultimate graphics board!
	o	10 Amiga programming tips for the real world (never posted;
		published in the proceedings of an Italian Amiga conference)!

... and many more!

	If you really enjoy inflicting pain on yourself (or others), two
earlier sets of articles are also available; see "FILE NAMES", below.


NEW FEATURES

	Now contains 65% more cholesterol and a free copy of "Bunny Blaster
Wars!"


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	Consciousness.

	Works under all versions of Kickstart.

	A warped sense of humor is recommended but not required.


HOST NAME

	All Aminet ftp sites.

	Also available on the famous ftp site etarip.uoy.ffo.kcuf, when its
network connection is functioning.


DIRECTORY

	/pub/aminet/text/docs


FILE NAMES

	DanBarrettHumor3.lzh

	Two older collections of articles are found in the files
DanBarrettHumor.lzh and DanBarrettHumor2.lzh.  It is recommended that you
read the earlier articles first, since some of the later jokes build on
earlier ones.


PRICE

	Free!  (Contributions are accepted, of course. :-))

articles may be freely distributed as long as they are distributed in their
