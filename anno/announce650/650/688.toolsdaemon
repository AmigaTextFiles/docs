TITLE

     ToolsDaemon

RELEASE

     2.1a

AUTHOR

     Nico Francois

SHORT

     Add menus and submenus to WB menu strip.

DESCRIPTION

     ToolsDaemon allows you to run programs simply by selecting a menu
     item from the menu strip of Workbench 2.0 or higher.  Shell and
     Workbench programs are supported, including arguments and tool types
     for both of these.  The menu items can be arranged in several menus,
     with sub-items and keyboard shortcuts.

     ToolsPrefs is designed as a preferences editor for the ToolsDaemon
     menus.  It features a font-sensitive localized GadTools front-end
     and supports the 2.0 AppWindow feature.  This means it allows you to
     drag programs into its window and they will be automatically added
     to the menu items list.

     ToolsDaemon is the background program that will launch the tools you
     select from the menu strip.  It is meant to be dragged into the
     WbStartup drawer so it will automatically be launched on startup.

NEW FEATURES

     o Really fixed the deadlock problem I fixed in ToolsDaemon 2.1 :-)
       If you managed to select *the* *first* menu item a split second
       after activating a Workbench window ToolsDaemon would still hang.
       The same problem occured on machines running TWA and when picking
       the first item just after quitting Directory Opus.

     o ToolsPrefs will now set its current directory to PROGDIR:.

     o ToolsPrefs  window  is now simple refresh and uses the Kickstart
       3.0 or higher zoom-in-place feature.

     o Dropping a "fake" icon (Show All Files) in the ToolsPrefs window
       will now automatically enter the program as a CLI command.

     o There was a problem with ToolsDaemon on Workbench 2.0.
       ToolsDaemon would abort silently if it was the first Commodity
       that was run (probably due to a bug in commodities.library V37;
       V38 and higher worked fine).  This is fixed now.

     o Updated icons to Workbench 3 look :-) 

     o Some new catalogs included.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaOS Release 2.04 (V37+) or higher.
