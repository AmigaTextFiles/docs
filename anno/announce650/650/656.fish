--------
OVERVIEW
--------

This document provides general information about my CD-ROM series,
including CD-ROMs that are in production and ones that are planned for the
future.  It includes all necessary details for ordering CD-ROMs and a
sample order form at the end.

There are two CD-ROM series that are intended to meet significantly
different needs, and a one-time CD-ROM production that will contain the
entire contents of my floppy disk distribution once I reach disk 1000.

------------------------
WHY CD-ROM DISTRIBUTIONS
------------------------

== More Cost Effective ==

It is simply far more cost effective, both for me and for the library
subscribers, to distribute the library on CD-ROMs than on floppy disks.
The current cost of a subscription to the floppy distribution averages
about $40 per month for less than 12Mb of new material per month.

A CD-ROM distribution is expected to average about $20 per month for
50-150Mb of new material per month, assuming there actually is that much
available.  I.E. I expect to be able to supply almost an order of magnitude
more new material at about half the average cost of a floppy subscription
during the same period.

== Multiple Distribution Formats ==

With the floppy distributions, the name of the game is sometimes to see
just how much material can be crammed onto a single floppy.  There is
almost always a tradeoff between the convenience of having the material in
unarchived format and the desire to get as much material as possible into a
new release, or to make something fit on a single floppy.  A significant
amount of time actually goes into juggling things around until a set of 10
floppies achieves the desired density of 95-100% full.

With a CD-ROM distribution, we get the best of both worlds.  Given a vastly
larger amount of space, the new material can be distributed directly in two
forms: an unarchived (ready-to-run) form, and an archived (BBS-ready) form,
on the same media.  This is how the Freshfish CD-ROM is organized.

The archival CD-ROMs that are scheduled for release after each third
Freshfish CD-ROM will eventually contain only the BBS-ready form of new
material from as many previous Freshfish CD-ROMs as will fit on a single
CD-ROM.

-------------------------------------
COORDINATION WITH FLOPPY DISTRIBUTION
-------------------------------------

== Timing of Floppy Releases ==

For the past several years, I've released floppy disks in batches of 10,
with a new batch being released about every 2 to 6 weeks.  Beginning with
the first Freshfish CD-ROM, the release of floppy disks has been tied to
the release of the CD-ROM master to production.

It is expected that when each new Freshfish CD-ROM is released there will
be 15-25 floppy disks that are released at the same time, the contents of
which will make up some fraction of the new material that is included on
the Freshfish CD-ROM.  Note that not all the new material will be contained
on the floppy disks; the only way to get all the new material is via the
CD-ROM.

== Migration to CD-ROM Only Distributions ==

Once the library reaches disk 1000, there will be no more floppy releases
and the library will move to CD-ROM only.  Part of the reason for delaying
the move to CD-ROM and running both distributions in parallel is to allow
people time to acquire CD-ROM drives, and part of the reason is that it
would be a shame to get this close to disk 1000 and not reach it.

After the release of disk 1000, there will be a CD-ROM (or set of CD-ROMs)
containing the contents of the entire floppy library (see below).

---------------------------
ORGANIZATION OF THE CD-ROMs
---------------------------

== The Freshfish CD-ROM ==

The Freshfish CD-ROM is designed to meet the needs of users who want copies
of new releases of material as soon as practical with a CD-ROM
distribution.  Depending upon when the material was received in the CD-ROM
production cycle, and the time to go from CD-ROM master to production
CD-ROMs, there should be an average latency of about three to six weeks
between receiving new material and its availability on a Freshfish CD-ROM.

As of 5-Jan-94 two Freshfish CD-ROMs have been produced, the Oct-93 and the
Dec-93 CD-ROMs.  Limited quantities of the Oct-93 CD-ROM are still
available.  The Dec-93 CD-ROM is just now going into production, and work
is starting on the Feb-94 CD-ROM.

Since there is not enough new material of sufficient quality released every
couple of months to fill a CD-ROM (or enough time to organize it if it was
available), I include some other material on the Freshfish CD-ROM to make
effective use of the available space.  Each Freshfish CD-ROM is organized
into several different sections:

    o	A overview section containing information about the library,
	this particular CD-ROM, hot breaking news, etc.

    o	A section containing material that is newly released with
	this CD-ROM, in ready-to-run (unarchived) form.

    o	A section containing material that is newly released with
	this CD-ROM, in BBS-ready (archived) form.

    o	A section containing installed versions of popular tools that
	are anticipated to be released in updated form on each CD-ROM.
	By leaving the CD-ROM mounted, you can potentially free up
	several hundred megabytes of hard disk space to use for other
	purposes.  Of course the tools can still be copied from the
	CD-ROM to a hard drive if you prefer the faster access speed of
	the hard drive or don't wish to leave the CD-ROM mounted all
	the time.  If this section gets too large, it may be split off
	onto a separate tools CD-ROM.

    o	A "filler" section.  Whatever space remains after putting
	everything else on the CD-ROM will be filled with selected
	material from a previous CD-ROM or from the floppy based
	library distributions.  This may or may not include all the
	new material from the previous CD-ROM, depending upon space
	available.  The intention is that users will be able to
	order every other Freshfish CD-ROM (at least in the beginning)
	and because of the overlap, not miss any new material.


== The Archival CD-ROM ==

This CD-ROM is intended to meet the needs of users who prefer to get their
doses of new material in larger chunks over longer intervals.  It also
provides a way for BBS operators to have the maximal amount of recently
released new material online using a single CD-ROM.  Eventually all of the
material on the Archival CD-ROMs will be in the BBS-ready format.

The current plans are for an Archival CD-ROM to be produced after every
third Freshfish CD-ROM, containing all the new material from each of the
previous Freshfish CD-ROMs, up to the limit of available previous Freshfish
CD-ROMs or reaching the maximum capacity of a CD-ROM, whichever comes
first.  For the first several Archival CD-ROMs there will probably not be
enough older CD-ROM material to fill it up, so material will probably be
included from the floppy distribution, starting with the latest disk and
working backwards until the CD-ROM is full.

The first Archival CD-ROM should be available shortly after the release of
the February Freshfish CD-ROM, which would put its release date in early
March.  It will contain all the new material from the Oct-93, Dec-93, and
Feb-94 Freshfish CD-ROMs.  The remaining space will be filled with archives
of the floppy distribution, as described above.

I need to come up with a more descriptive name for this CD-ROM series,
hopefully one that is as cute and appropriate as the "Freshfish" name for
the CD-ROMs which bring you the "freshest available Fish".  I've already
ruled out "RipeFish", "CannedFish", etc, so please don't suggest those.

== The 1000 Floppy CD-ROM ==

Once the floppy distribution reaches 1000 disks, I will produce a CD-ROM
(or CD-ROM set) containing the entire contents of the floppy library.  I am
currently at disk 950 in the floppy distribution.  Between now and the
release of the February Freshfish CD-ROM, I am going to attempt to organize
another 25 floppy disks to be released concurrent with the February
Freshfish CD-ROM, and then do the final 25 disks to be released concurrent
with the April Freshfish CD-ROM, about the middle of April.  The 1000 disk
CD-ROM should be available before the end of April.

Many people have asked for details about how the 1000 disk archive CD-ROM
will be organized.  My current thinking on this is to do two different
versions, one that consists of a single CD-ROM with everything in archived
(BBS-ready) form, and the other that consists of a two CD-ROM set with
everything in unarchived (ready-to-run) form.  Each of them will be the
same price ($19.95), and people that order (or have preordered) the CD-ROM
will be asked to select which version they want.

The BBS-ready version will contain archives on a per-floppy-directory
basis.  That is, each of the main directories on a floppy will be put in a
separate archive, and the "overhead files" such as the contents of the :c
directory and the usual "readme" files, will be put in yet another archive.
To reconstruct a disk all that will be necessary is to format the floppy,
and then unarchive each of the archives in the root directory of that
floppy.  A CRC list will be provided for each disk, for validation that the
reconstruction was successful.  A tool will be provided that handles all
the details of this process, and makes reconstruction of floppies as simple
and painless as possible.

--------------------
ORDERING INFORMATION
--------------------

== Per CD-ROM Price ==

Currently all CD-ROMs are priced at $19.95 plus shipping and handling,
when ordered directly from me.  The suggested retail price for copies
purchased through dealers and other distributers is $29.95.

You can preorder as many disks as you would like.  Should it become
necessary to adjust the prices at a future date, customers with existing
accounts at the time of a rate change will always receive the lowest
available rate, either the rate in affect at the time of the order or the
rate at the time of shipment, whichever is lower.  So order now at $19.95
and always get the best rate.

== Shipping and Handling Charges ==

Shipping and handling is $3 per package of up to 4 CD-ROMs for first class
mail shipments within the USA, or airmail shipments to Canada or Mexico.
For all other destinations, shipping and handling is $5 per package of up
to 4 CD-ROMs and is done via small packet airmail.  Special arrangements
such as Federal Express are available for a $25 special handling fee per
shipment, plus actual shipping charges.

For orders of multiple copies of CD-ROMs, such that more than one CD-ROM
would be shipped in a single package (ordering 6 copies of each Freshfish
CD-ROM for example), use $3 or $5 per set, or partial set, of 4 CD-ROMs as
follows:

	Total CD-ROMs		USA, Canada
	in package		or Mexico	Other
	-------------		-----------	------
	1-4			$3		$5
	5-8			$6		$10
	9-12			$9		$15
	13-16			$12		$20
	etc...
	
== Address For Ordering ==

You can order CD-ROMs using the same address as for the floppy distribution.
Note that my address has changed recently.  The new address is:

	Amiga Library Services
	610 N. Alma School Road, Suite 18
	Chandler, AZ  85224-3687
	USA

Orders can be FAX'd to:

	(602) 917-0917  (FAX only, no phone orders via voice)

Payment can be made via:

    o	cash  (suggest registered mail)

    o	check, money order, international bank draft (payable in U.S.
	dollars)

    o	credit card (VISA or MasterCard).

Be sure to state in your order which CD-ROMs you want and include the
appropriate shipping and handling as indicated above.  As with the floppy
distributions, funds not immediately used will go into an escrow account
(fully refundable at any time), to be charged against as CD-ROMs are
shipped.

If you already have an account for the floppy distribution, you can
transfer to the CD-ROM account, and automatically switch over to the CD-ROM
distribution, by simply notifying me that this is what you'd like to do.

== Credit Card Orders ==

If you order with a credit card, please include a statement with your order
that you agree to have the charge made to your card before delivery of the
CD-ROMs, subject to full refund on demand of any unused portion.  If you
FAX in an order to be paid via credit card, please sign it somewhere.

----------------------------------------
REDISTRIBUTION and COMPILATION COPYRIGHT
----------------------------------------

== Free Redistribution Will Continue ==

The main focus of the library will be to continue to supply freely
redistributable software.  That is, if a user wishes to take something off
of the CD-ROM and distribute it directly to other users, or make it
available for electronic access, no permission is needed from me to do so.
There may however be a small number of files on the CD-ROM which are not
distributable, if they are licensed from third parties to make the CD-ROM
more usable.  For example, this might include all the necessary files from
Commodore to make the CD-ROM usable in a CDTV or CD32, or it might include
all the Amiga header files to make gcc more usable.  There will be a list
of all files on each CD-ROM that fall into this category.  People wishing
to redistribute material from a CD-ROM will be responsible for sanitizing
these files out of their redistribution.

== Compilation Copyright ==

I struggled quite a while with this issue.  I've always explicitly
disclaimed a compilation copyright on the floppy distribution, mostly to
make it simple for users to redistribute complete floppies, or the
collection as a whole.  It would not have been feasible to have a single
source for the floppy based distribution and have the library achieve the
popularity that it has today.

However, CD-ROMs change the entire picture.  It is anticipated that there
will eventually be almost an order of magnitude more time and effort put
into acquiring and organizing the material on each month's CD-ROM, than what
goes into the current floppy distribution.  This is mostly because it is
anticipated that there will eventually be an order of magnitude more
material to organize.

So instead of 50 hours or so of work spread out over several weeks to
organize the material on 10 floppy disks, it takes several people, working
the equivalent of a full time job, several weeks to produce each CD-ROM.
As with the floppy distribution, a significant percentage of the cost of
each CD-ROM goes towards compensating various people for this labor.  There
are also significantly higher fixed monthly costs associated with
maintaining or contracting for the necessary equipment and software to
produce CD-ROMs.

In short, CD-ROMs bring a slightly more commercial flavor to the library
(at least at the point of origin) than what has been traditional in the
past for the floppy based distribution.  However I will always strive to
keep costs down and produce a CD-ROM that is an excellent value for the
price.  I hope the user community will understand the need for this
change.

For these reasons, I have decided that all CD-ROMs will have a compilation
copyright, but the only restriction will be that they cannot be "cloned"
and the material redistributed on CD-ROM or similarly priced optical media
without prior permission, nor can they be used as the basis for generating
a substantially similar CD-ROM distribution.

There are of course no restrictions on mounting the CD-ROM and making
its contents widely available for electronic distribution, copying the
entire contents of the CD-ROM to non-optical media such as hard drives or
tape, or copying any of the contents to media of much smaller capacity like
floppy disks.

---------------------------
CD32 and CDTV COMPATIBILITY
---------------------------

All the necessary files are included on the CD-ROM to allow them to boot
on a CDTV or CD32.  Each CD-ROM is also set up to start parnet running when
it is booted on a CDTV or CD32.  This allows uses with appropriate software
and cabling to use a CDTV as a slow external CD-ROM drive.
