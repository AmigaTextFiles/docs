Centaur Announces Pricing and Availability of OpalVision Products
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Centaur Development announced today pricing and availability of the 
enhancement modules for its modular OpalVision 24-bit graphics and Video
system. 

The OpalVision Main Board, available since last August, has earned a 
reputation as the best of the 24-bit Amiga boards.  It is a true 24-bit
display device and framebuffer with 16.7 million colors available for every
pixel. The bundled software includes the award-winning OpalPaint, widely 
acknowledged in the press as the very best of Amiga painting programs. 

The three new enhancement modules add a wide array of previously 
unannounced additional features to the system:

----------------- The OpalVision Video Processor ------------------------

The OpalVision Video Processor (Formerly known as the Frame Grabber/Genlock)
plugs directly into the Main Board. It is a real-time, 24-bit framegrabber,
a professional quality genlock with chroma and luma keying and includes the
OpalVision Roaster Chip for unlimited transitions, color processing and 
Digital Video Effects.  It includes controlling software for all functions
and a 24-bit, 35ns character generator.

------------------ The OpalVision Video Suite ---------------------------

The OpalVision Video Suite (Formerly known as the Production Switcher) is
a complete audio and video mixing, switching and transcoding device. It is
a 19-inch, rack-mountable external unit with 9 video and 10 audio inputs. 
Video inputs and outputs are available simultaneously in RGB or Y/R-Y/B-Y, 
composite and S-Video.  Its linear transparency key provides transparency 
control between 2 Video sources on a pixel-by-pixel basis.  The audio mixer
is fully software sequenced with smooth fades and full 5-band stereo 
frequency equalization.

------------------ The OpalVision Scan-Rate Converter  ------------------

The OpalVision Scan-Rate Convertor also plugs directly into the Main Board.  
It converts PAL and NTSC signals to 31kHz for non-interlaced, flicker-free 
display of Amiga and OpalVision graphics and live video. It operates with any
multi-sync/multi-scan monitor.  Additionally, the Scan-Rate Convertor 
includes a full, infinite window Time Base Corrector which operates in RGB 
for excellent quality.


All three of the additional modules will be available this Spring and will 
have a Suggested Retail Price of $995.00 each.  OpalVision automatically 
self-configures for both PAL and NTSC video modes and works with the 
Amiga 2000, 3000 and 4000 models.
