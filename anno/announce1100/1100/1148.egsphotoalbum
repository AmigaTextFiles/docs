DESCRIPTION

     A picture management (including PhotoCD) and presentation
     software for the EGS graphical environment.

     This software enables all EGS users (e.g. users of the
     typical EGS graphic boards as Piccolo, Piccolo-SD64,
     EGS-Spectrum, EGS-110, ...) to maintain and present
     large collections of pictures in full 24Bit quality on
     their graphic boards. EGSPhotoAlbum supports more than
     20 picture file formats internally and additionally
     suports picture DataTypes and even animation DataTypes
     when used under OS3.0/3.1.

     Internally supported formats:

     1) IFF-ILBM (1 to 24Bit incl. HAM6/HAM8)
     2) JPeg (color and greyscale)
     3) PPM/PGM/PBM (P1&P4 b&w, P5 grey, P6 color)
     4) QRT (also known as dump format by PD raytracers as POV-Ray)
     5) Targa
     6) PCX
     7) BMP (uncompressed)
     8) TIF (packbit-compr./uncompr.)
     9) EGS7.x window icons
     10) DEEP
     11) YUV
     12) VLAB raw
     13) RGB
     14) HHsYUVSq sequence format
     15) IFF-PBM (DPII)
     16) ACBM
     17) FBM
     18) Sun raster (uncompressed)
     19) MacPaint (b&w compressed 1Bit format; datafork only)
     20) HHsXRL formats
     21) PhotoCD (Base format 768x512 or 512x768 (portrait))

     The additional DataType support extends this list by many
     formats; DataTypes can e.g. be found on Aminet in util/DType.

     Small (thumbnail) representations of all pictures in a directory
     or directory tree are shown very fast. You can then select pictures
     for viewing in multiple full size windows including fast scrolling
     and zooming functions. You can also present selected pictures in
     a Slideshow presentation mode including transition effects.
     Pictures can also be directly transfered to ImageFX, ImageFX-EGS,
     PicoPainter, ArtEffect, XiPaint or to the Clipboard. Saving is
     possible in several 24Bit formats including JPeg, IFF24 and more.

     For faster access you can also save downscaled representations
     of the images. You can view and change the file comment of pictures
     directly and also delete pictures in a comfortable way.
