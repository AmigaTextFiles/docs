Stylus announces the Stylus Pro-Pak


Ft. Collins, CO. - Stylus, Inc. announces the Stylus Pro-Pak;  a
professional software bundle for graphic artists.  The Stylus
Pro-Pak includes ProVector 3, a major update of our
structured-drawing program; StylusTracer(tm), for autotracing,
image-processing, and touch-up; PSImport(tm), for PostScript
importing and editing; and RexxRequest(tm), an ARexx command
host for designing Intuition(tm) requesters for ARexx macros.

NEW FEATURES IN PROVECTOR 3:
    * Advanced Graphic Architecture(tm) support
    * A complete "interface-lift"
    * New gradient fill options
    * New object effects, including perspective, blending,
       skewing, mirroring, warping, etc.
    * Object masks (clipping paths)
    * Additional file formats supported include HP-GL, and Adobe
       Illustrator
    * Improved text support, including resident and downloaded
      PostScript Type 1 support, text blocks, text effects,
      imbedded formatting commands
    * Anti-aliased, 24-bit ILBM output
    * PostScript Color Separations w/ Trapping, UCR, etc.
    * Math Coprocessor support
    * Support for Amiga OS 2.1 & 3.0 features, including ARexx;
       context-sensitive, on-line help via AmigaGuide(tm);
       public screen support; standard Amiga file and screen
       mode requesters

LONG-STANDING FEATURES
    * Multiple Undos
    * True Layers
    * Structured and bitmapped pattern fills
    * Magnetism
    * ARexx
    * Multiple Projects
    * Page sizes up to 15x15 miles
    * RELIABILITY

PSIMPORT(tm), the utility that gives ProVector the ability to
load and edit PostScript files, has been updated to complement
the new features of ProVector.  Support has been added for the
following PostScript(R) features:

    * Text objects
    * Gradient fills
    * Clipping paths (masks)

STYLUSTRACER includes a full suite of image-processing and
touch-up tools to prepare bitmaps for tracing.  IFF-ILBM and
TIFF bitmaps may be traced.  Traced drawings may be saved in
either IFF-DR2D, or Adobe Illustrator(tm) file formats.  Tracing
options include object tracing, center-line tracing, sub-polygon
(objects with holes) tracing, and thin-line tracing. 
StylusTracer utilizes ARexx for macros and interprocess
communication, as well as AmigaGuide for on-line help.

Finally, REXXREQUEST is an ARexx command host utility which
gives ARexx macros access to the Amiga gadtools.library, for
building 2.X style requesters.  Included macros provide examples
of RexxRequest's use, as well as useful functions in their own
right.

The Stylus Pro-Pak is available NOW at a suggested list of
$299.95 (US).  For a limited time, the Stylus Pro-Pack will be
available directly from Stylus, Inc. at an introductory price
of $199.95.  Registered ProVector 2.1 users who have also

which allows owners of earlier versions of ProVector, Art
Expressions, Professional Draw, DesignWorks, or Aegis Draw, to
upgrade for $149.95.  These special offers will only be
available through July 31, 1995.
