Hi Dan,

There are still problems with the your mail server, methinks...

I will try again, but I will mail directly to you, just in case!

DESCRIPTION
   Icons in isometric style a la NewIcons. A set of IFF pictures that can be 
   used to create icons in the style of the "NewIcons" package. Various 
   elements from the pictures can be combined to create an icon to suit your 
   personal preferences. Examples (in IFF format) of all common icons are 
   provided.(SYS: icons) All icons are a standard size and format, to give 
   their final appearance on the Workbench a neat and organized look. No more 
   cluttered screens and windows and no more massive, gaudy icons. The icons 
   images can be picked up from the IFF pictures as IFF brushes, and then 
   imported into your favorite icon editor, and the icons created from there.
   
   A few screen grabs have been included to show off the "isoicons".

   What makes this package different?
   
   This is the only package, that I know of, that allows the you to construct 
   your own icons from the "clip art" provided. Also ALL the images are in IFF
   picture format and can be edited and created using the power of a paint 
   program like DPaint or Brilliance. (This way you won't have to put up with 
   using icon editors like the terrible IconEd program from Workbench 2.0+. 
   :-() 

   The imagery only uses the first 4 colors on a 16-color picture, so
   more colors can be used in the icons. That is better than working with
   a 8- or 16-color icon from somewhere else and then losing most of the 
   visual detail when reducing the palette to suite your Workbench. :-(

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
   Any Amiga from an A1000 to an A4000!
   A paint program capable of reading and saving standard Amiga IFF pictures.
   AmigaDOS 1.2 to 3.1 compatible. (Palettes may differ between OS versions)
   Tons of huge, lousy, gaudy icons, and a messy Workbench. :-)
   NTSC or PAL compatible. (The images are PAL 640 X 512 16-colour format)
   Archive created with LHA 1.38.
