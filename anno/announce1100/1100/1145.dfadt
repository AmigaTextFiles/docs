REVISE DAN

Hi Dan,

Thank you for revising my announcement! Keep on doing such a
great job on all these announcements coming up every week!

[...]

> Also, you might want to talk a little bit more about DFA.  Saying that
> it generates database files is enough, of course, but you might want
> to enlighten people a bit more.

I adopted the filename to the URL format (hope it's correct
now!) and rewrote the description part of the announcement.

Yours.

TITLE

     DFADT

VERSION

     V39.1

AUTHOR

     Dirk Federlein

     UUCP:   dirkf@alcmy.franken.de (prefered!)

     Fido:   2:244/6302.12


DESCRIPTION

     The DFA datatype can be used to view DFA created
     database files using tools like Multiview. Additionally,
     it is possible to print customized address lists using
     this datatype and Multiview (for example)

     The display format can be customized, i.e. you can tell
     the datatype which fields of the address database you
     want to get displayed.

     This datatype can read all DFA address database formats
     from version 1.0 to version 2.25 of DFA!

         DFA is the definite address database tool. It 
         supplies a very nice GUI, a powerful Arexx port, a 
         flexible client server mechanism and much more. It 
         is simply the ideal mean to manage several or many 
         addresses for the beginner as well as for the 
         professional Amiga user.


     This is version 39.1. Freeware, C-source included.

     installed.
