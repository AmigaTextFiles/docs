TITLE

	p2latex - produce LaTeX files from Pascal source for pretty
                  printing.

VERSION

	Version 1.0, Patchlevel 0.

AUTHOR

	Torsten Poulin Nielsen (torsten@diku.dk)


DESCRIPTION

	p2latex generates files suitable for processing by LaTeX from
	ISO Pascal source. It can create both stand-alone LaTeX files
	for pretty-printing a Pascal program as well as files for
	inclusion in other LaTeX documents. The user is given great
	control over the final appearence of the Pascal program. There
	are options for setting different fonts for keywords, text
	within strings, identifiers, comments, etc. The placement of
	comments are controlled by a host of other options. If used
	without any options, it defaults to predefined values that
	produce very pleasant listings.

	Full source in C and Flex is included in the distribution.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

	None, but LaTeX would definitely be an advantage :-)

HOST NAME

	Aminet. Several sites are available, e.g,
	ftp.luth.se 130.240.18.2

	(p2latex is also available from comp.sources.misc archives. The
	only thing missing from that distribution is the Amiga
	executable.)


DIRECTORY

	Aminet: /pub/aminet/dev/misc 

FILE NAME

	p2latex.lha (63257 bytes)

DISTRIBUTABILITY

	Distributed under version 2 (or newer) of the Gnu General
	Public License.
