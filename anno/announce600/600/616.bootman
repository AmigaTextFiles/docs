SHORT

     Allows multiple startup-sequences with selection at boot-up.

DESCRIPTION

     A boot manager program that allows you to select a startup-
     sequence at boot time using the mouse or keyboard. Also
     allows password protection and a timer to load a default
     startup if none is selected. Includes a preference editor
     for easy modification and startup.

     BootMan is useful for users who wish to have different machine
     configurations, such as a shell-only startup, a ray-trace startup,
     a BBS startup, a full blown startup with cache software, and a
     memory conserving startup.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     BootMan requires an Amiga running KickStart 2.0 or higher.

FEATURES

     - display startup-sequences by file names or text description

     - default startup-sequence with optional user setable timer

     - no messy scripts - GUI driven
