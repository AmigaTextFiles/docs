DESCRIPTION

     Dave's Space Empire (DSE) is a "door" game to play online most any
     Amiga bulletin board systems (BBS's).  The game is a multi-player
     game where participants compete to build the largest "space
     empire".  The game involves military strategy, cooperation with
     other players, and you mustn't forget to keep the people in your
     own empire happy.  By purchasing and/or conquering various types
     of planets, players gain population, the resources of the
     particular planet, and points.  When a player reaches 100,000
     points, they become "Space Lord".  They do not automatically win
     however, they must retain their Space Lord status for one week
     (seven days).

     Dave's Space Empire is a "DOS" door game to make it compatible
     with as many BBS packages as possible.  It may also be run from a
     CLI window.  It supports ANSI colors and IBM graphics, each of
     which can be turned on/off by each individual user.  Also, all
     menus are ASCII text files so that they can be altered by any text
     editor.  Every message displayed by the game is in one large text
     file so that SysOps can customize the game and colors of the text
     as much as possible.


NEW FEATURES

     The game was originally a CNet game and has been re-written as a
     "DOS" door so that more BBS's can use the game.

     The text code system was implemented.

     Many separate text files were created to add to the flexibility of
     the program.  Anything that appears in text in the game can be
     changed!  This means the game could even be re-written for another
     language without having to touch the source code.

     Text files can be powerpacked.

     Message system has been re-done.  There is now both private and
     public messaging available in the "InterGalactic Radio Network".

     Players can attach cargo transfers to their private messages.  These
     can be for sending items (money, cruisers, soldiers, etc) to someone
     for free or for bartering (requesting a certain amount of money,
     cruisers, soldiers, etc.).

     Many bugs have been fixed and the file format has been made more
     efficient.

     Graphical configuration program.

     Documentation in AmigaGuide format, which includes documentation for
     setting up the game in general terms and also in specifics for the
     following BBS programs:

                      * CNet AMIGA
                      * DLG-Pro
                      * Excelsior!
                      * StarNet
                      * TransAmiga

     Please realize that if your BBS program is not listed here, it
     does not mean that the game will not run.  It simply means I do
     not have SPECIFIC documentation for that BBS.  DSE will run if
     your BBS can run doors that use stdin/stdout.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     DSE requires at least AmigaDOS 1.3.  Nothing else is required if
     you are just running the game from a shell, but if you run it from
     a BBS, then you will probably want at least 1MB of RAM and a
     hard-drive.  Different BBS programs have different requirements.
