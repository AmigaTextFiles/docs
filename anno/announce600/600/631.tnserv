DESCRIPTION

     Tnserv is a telnet daemon for AmiTCP version 2. It allows
     remote connections to your computer and allows remote shells, 
     multi-user BBSes, remote text editing, and much more.

FEATURES

     - Provides telnet daemon support for AmiTCP version 2
     - Supports arbitrary number of simultaneous connections to 
       a single login.
     - Supports both pseudo-CON: and pseudo-serial.device connections,
       allowing virtually any existing program which works either
       in a Shell/CLI or over the serial port to be accessible
       over the network.
     - Compatible with MultiUser
     - Converts network end of line sequencess to Amiga type 
       end of line sequences.
     - Supports telnet LINEMODE option which allows line editing
       to be done on the client, therefore providing increased 
       performance, and decreased network bandwidth usage.
     - Provides password protection

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

     Tnserv requires AmiTCP version 2 installed and running,
     and AmigaDOS 2.0 or better. It will generally  use less than
     100k of memory, although it may use much more if there
     are many remote connections.
