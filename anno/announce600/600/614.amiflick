DESCRIPTION
    FLI files are animation files popular on IBM's.  They are typically
    320x200 in 256 colors.  FLC's are FLI's in higher resolutions (640x480
    is the most common.  AmiFlick plays FLI and FLC animations on all Amigas.
    It fully supports AGA and can also write frames as IFF pictures.

NEW FEATURES
    A few bugs have been fixed, such as double buffering under 3.0.  The
    animation file can now be specified without the '.FLI' or '.FLC'
    extension.  Under 3.0, BestModeID() is used to pick the display mode.
    (Note that the hires HAM option is gone as it will now automatically
    be used).  The display mode can also be selected by name or by ID.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    None. (Runs under all OS versions since 1.2.)

    AmiNet (ftp.wustl.edu is one AmiNet site)

    /pub/aminet/gfx/show/

FILE NAMES
    AmiFlick_v1.10.lha   (Binary and doc)
