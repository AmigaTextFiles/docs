DESCRIPTION

     ToolType is an utility mainly for users who hate editing icon
     tooltypes using workbench.  ToolType will allow you to edit
     all of an icon's tooltypes at once rather that using the single
     line editor that workbench gives you.  ToolType extracts the
     tooltypes from the icon and lets you use your favorite text
     editor to edit them; it then will save all the changes back
     when you are done editing. ToolType has an added feature of
     sorting the tooltypes alphabetically if you want it to.  It
     can be started from WB, CLI, or set up as an appicon.  It can
     be setup to use what ever text editor you wish.

NEW FEATURES

    - Temp file will now be unlocked when ToolType is run more than once.
    - Fixed memory problem when using the appicon, Tooltype will now 
      free the memory occupied by the tooltypes when you are done editing. 
      Solves problem of ToolType adding extra tooltypes at the end 
      when subsequent icon had fewer ones than the previous.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - Only OS 2.x and up
     - A text editor
