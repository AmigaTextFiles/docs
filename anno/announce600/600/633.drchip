DESCRIPTION

    The DrChip C utilities include four programs: a C beautifier,
    a function lister, a hdrtags/ctags generator, and a C program
    prototype <-> K&R-style converter.


    CCB

    Dr. Chip's C Beautifier program.  Places source code in Dr.
    Chip's preferred indentation style. ccb's indentation methods can
    be customized via options, even to the cb style (of U*IX fame).
    This program is useful for standardizing the indentation style of
    C programs, and helps make code more readable.  Furthermore,
    since ccb does its indentation based rigidly upon the number of
    open curly braces, it can be used to help the programmer find
    where a curly brace is missing.


    FLIST

    flist generates lists of functions from either C or C++ files.
    The lists may selected to be:

        comment block style
        extern style function declarations
        prototypes
        restricted to globally accessable functions
        restricted to locally accessable functions (ie.
         static)
        tags style

    Flist's tags mode is compatable with hdrtag (see below), and can
    merge hdrtags with tags.  See HDRTAG for more on tags.


    HDRTAG

    Hdrtags will process header files so one can "tag" to structure
    or class names, typedef'ed labels, #define labels, global
    variables, and enumerated types.  Entire hierarchies of header
    files can be tagged (ie. "include:" and all its subdirectories's
    header files)!  Use flist for merging hdrtags and tags files.
    Handles both C and C++ header (and source) files.  What's a tag?
    Smart editors (such as Vim and Manx's Z) support a "tags" file
    which associates words (such as function names) with a file and
    line to jump to.  The user can then issue "goto label" commands,
    avoiding the "what header file did that come from?" problem!


    TOPROTO

    The toproto program converts C source code to and from old K&R
    style to the new ANSI prototype-using style.  Concurrently, it
    converts to and from the old <varargs.h> style to <stdarg.h>
    style.


NEW FEATURES

    Several bugs were fixed, and better C++ handling was installed
    into flist and hdrtag.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

    Compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following options:
    CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8. Thus, a floating point coprocessor may be
    required, although the code doesn't do much, if any, floating
    point.  The DrChip tools will work with any C compiler, although
    hdrtags' usefulness is limited to those editors which support
    tags (such as ViM, available on AmiNet, and Z, Manx's vi editor
    look-alike).
