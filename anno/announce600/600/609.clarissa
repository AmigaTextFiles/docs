DESCRIPTION

Faster than any other anim-player, thanks to especially developed
algorithms which are definable for different configurations.  Clarissa
automatically optimizes anims so that they can be played back at the
highest possible speeds.  The SSA animation format eliminates most of the
problems normally encountered when playing back 2D and 3D animations (slow
play back, jerky movement, etc...)

FEATURES 

     * 30% Higher playback rate as opposed to other
       anim-players
     * Integrated virtual memory feature (which works even
       without an MMU) allows playback and editing of large 
       animations.
     * Cut and Paste function, with graphic display of
       animations, allows easy editing
     * Dynamic anim-clipboard functions allow for inserting or
       deleting of frames or ranges of frames, creating pauses
       within an animation and many more professional 
       manipulations
     * 20% speed increase when loading or saving anims
     * Lace compensation calculates the animation in half the
       vertical resolution and plays back in full resolution,
       giving a 50% increase in speed when creating
       animations.
     * Stand alone anim-player included. This player is a CLI
       command, usable from within every multimedia package.
