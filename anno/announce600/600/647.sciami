DESCRIPTION

Scientific Amigan is a new publication devoted to addressing the needs
of research, development, and design with the Amiga.  This newsletter
format monthly provides the technical focus that general Amiga
publications lack.  Readers benefit from techniques and software
developed across a wide range of disciplines, instead of occasional
articles that can't get to the desired level of detail.  The
Scientific Amigan disk library provides a wide range of tools and data
for the scientist and engineer; any two disks from the library are
provided with the annual subscription to the newsletter.  Reprint
material is also available as a susbscriber service.

Charter subscribers get a special $10 off of the annual rate,
perpetually applied to their subscription renewals.  However, this
special offer is only extended to subscriptions recieved through the 
end of January, 1994.

For more information, please email or write Scientific Amigan at 
the above address.  Sample issues will be available soon after the
premier January/February 1994 issue.


PRICE

Charter Subscription $29 per year (available until Feb. 1994)
Regular Subscription $39 per year
