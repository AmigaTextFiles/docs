DESCRIPTION

   Filelogger is a program which lets you log files from floppies to a 
   database file. A few features :

   - Log all/selected files from a floppy to the database.
   - Give your own file type and remarks to each file.
     (Over 30 file types can also be automatically recognized).
   - Do a search (with wild cards) on Disk Name/File Name/File
     Types/Remarks.
   - Optionally do a multilevel sort on the above fields when
     searching.
   - Print reports of the sorted/searched list of files.
   - WB 2.0 like interface even on WB 1.3 Amigas, with tape deck
     style 3D buttons.
   - All logged files are held in the memory (and can later be
     saved).  Even with 512K memory you can have about 200 disks
     in the log.

   This is a demo version with a few features disabled.  For full
   details as to how to register yourself, see below for more
   information.

NEW FEATURES

   New for version 1.31 :

   - You can now have your own default file types codes which you
     can specify in a preferences file.                                      
   - Even more file types are recognised, bringing the total to 30
     types.
   - A file requester has been added.                                    
   - You can stop the sort/search and read from the disk by
     pressing the right mouse button.                                                 
   - The file comment of every file on disk will now be read into
     the remarks field of the log.                                           
   - Now recognizes a NTSC machine and accordingly adjusts itself.
   - Has a new menu option to disable the irritating screen flash
     on display of messages.
   - Has a new menu option to change to colours of the screen to
     that of the workbench.
