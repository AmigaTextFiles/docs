DESCRIPTION

   QuickNet is a proprietry AmigaDOS-based networking system, using both
   hardware and software, that has been heavily optimised for speed.  In
   brief, it has the following major features:

   * IEEE 802.3 standard compatible.

   * Thick Ethernet, Thin Ethernet (Co-axial) and Twisted Pair compatible.

   * Versions include Zorro II (released), Zorro III, A500 expansion bus,
     A1200 trapdoor, CD32 trapdoor.

   * High speed 32 bit transfers with ZorroIII, A1200, and CD32 versions.
   
   * Peer-to-peer sharing of hard/floppy disks ram drives, CD-ROM drives, 
     tape drives, and other filing devices.

   * Printer sharing and spooling.
   
   * Fully Autobooting! Can be used with completely diskless computers.
     Supports individual Preferences and user-startup files.
   
   * Fully WB 1.3/2.x/3.x compatible.

   * Supports record locking.
   
   * Supports ARexx message passing, for inter-computer communication,
     synchronised multimedia productions, comprehensive multi-computer
     applications and much more!!

   * VERY FAST transfers and directories.
   
   * Can remotely mount any standard AmigaDOS file device, including
     volumes mounted via other networks.  This allows you to bridge
     between QuickNet and Envoy volumes, or Novell/AppleTalk/etc, giving
     completely transparent access to volumes over a variety of
     platforms.
     
   * Comprehensive, easy to use software and manual.
   
   * Robust design (can break the network cable, add a workstation,
     reconnect, and continue, with minimal disruption to the net).

   * Automount on login of selected devices.

   * Machine independance - you can sit down at any machine, login with
     your user name and password, and get your own preferences,
     user-startup, default printer and mounted devices.
     
   * "Plug-n-Play" installation - plug a card into a machine, connect it
     to an existing QuickNet network, and instantly get full access to
     the network.  Installer script for new nets.

   * SANA-II device driver available Jan '94 (switch selectable between
     SANA-II and QuickNet).
