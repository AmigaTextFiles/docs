DESCRIPTION

Adorage is a 2D animation package, offering a range of video-effects from
simple fade-in and fade-out to more complex effects such as page-flips and
explosions.  Selection and implementation of these F/X is icon-driven and
very easy.  Adorage partially supports the SSA (super smooth animation)
standard which allows the playback of animations up to 60 fields per
second, and is AGA compatible.  Adorage scene transitions are very fast due
to algorithms developed for this purpose.

FEATURES 

     * 3D effect groups (spirals, cubes, comet,...)
     * user definable parameters for most effects, creating a
       virtually unlimited number of parameters	 
     * Icon driven user interface is very user-friendly, even for
       beginners
     * Supports AGA and automatically configurs for the
       processor type present
     * Most effects (even 3D effects) don't require
       pre-rendering
     * Very fast, even on slower Amigas
     * Great number of effects


RECOMMENDED 

Workbench V2.X+, Kickstart V2.04+, 3MB RAM, Hard disk
