DESCRIPTION

     ForceIcon is an utility mainly for users of CDRom drives.
     Since one can not snapshot the position of a volume`s icon,
     nor replace it by a user-defined one, I wrote this utility.
     ForceIcon allows you to set the position of a disk`s icon
     and/or replace it by a different image/icon which doesn`t
     have to be a disk.info file. All types of ".info" files may
     be selected.

NEW FEATURES

     - ForceIcon will adopt the orig. window position and size now.
     - Icons weren`t positioned as set with the Position window.
     - The X/Y coordinates may be set manually, now.
     - ListView gadgets weren`t adjusted for OS 2.x. - Should check
       for OS 2.x sometime ;)

     ... and some minor enhancements and bugfixes
