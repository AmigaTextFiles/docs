DESCRIPTION

     These programs make owners of Progressive Peripherals Zeus 68040
     card a lot happier than they are without them. The PPI supplied
     SCSI driver has the annoying feature that it uses a CPU polling loop
     for waiting the SCSI DMA transfers to complete. The supplied patch
     programs make the SCSI driver to use Signal()/Wait() mechanism to
     wait for the completion. This allows other tasks to use the CPU
     while a task is doing a SCSI transfer. 

     The patches also fix a nasty problem which is related to the
     copyback cache of 68040 processor. The PPI driver pays no
     attention to this problem which can cause disk reads to be
     corrupted. So even if you don't want better performance consider
     using the patches.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     Zeus 68040 accelerator card with ROM version 2.98 is required to

     required.
