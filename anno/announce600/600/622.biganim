AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION

     BigAnim is an animation player, capable of "direct from disk"
     playback, with user selectable buffer size and playback speed.
     BigAnim can display IFF ANIM animations of types 5 and 7, and
     makes use of the new graphics.library double-buffering routines
     when run on an Amiga with Kickstart 3.0 or later.

NEW FEATURES

     These are the changes since version 3.3:

     o Buffer utilization statistics added

     o Playback speed can be changed during playback, by pressing
       one of the digit keys

     o Several bug fixes and minor improvements

REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 2.04 or higher. BigAnim will take advantage of Kickstart 3.0
     and 68020+ processors if found.
