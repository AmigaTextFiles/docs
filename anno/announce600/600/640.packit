DESCRIPTION

    PackIt is a CLI only program to replace the crunch and decrunch
    commands that came with PowerPacker (Copyright Nico Francois).

    PackIt features:
        1) Single command for crunching and decrunching
        2) PackIt will automatically crunch or decrunch a data file
           depending on whether it is allready crunched or not.
        3) Password can be specified as a shell option, or you can use a
           string requester.
        4) PackIt will not crunch executables, unless told to do so.
           Note: PackIt will only crunch the executables as a data file
                 you will not be able to run them, unless you are using
                 PPLoadSeg (Copyright Nico Francois)
        5) PackIt will automaticly replace the sorce file unless a 
           destination is given.

           crunch/decrunch the file into that dir.
