TITLE

     Universal Message System (UMS), Public Release

VERSION

     Version 10.8

AUTHOR

     Private developers

DESCRIPTION

     The  Universal  Message  System  (short  "UMS")  is a system for
     managing   all  kinds  of  messages  ('e-mail'  and  'news')  as
     universally and efficiently as possible.

     It  uses  its own, network-independent format, thus allowing the
     user,  the  'newsreader'-  and  tool-programs  to read and treat
     messages from different networks in a unified way.

     Special  programs  called  'importers' and 'exporters' deal with
     the  specific  formats  of  all  these networks. In this release
     importers/exporters  are  supplied  for  UUCP,  FidoNet, Mausnet
     (German) and Z-Net (German) as well as for a proprietary format.

     UMS supports multiple users and manages individual access-rights
     for each user.

     UMS  provides  a  common interface ("ums.library") for access to
     the  message-base,  which  is  used by all programs dealing with
     UMS.

     Developer-material for using UMS in Amiga-Oberon, ARexx, C and
     Modula-II is included in this package.

  Also included:

      - all binaries and tools needed for the central data-base

      - two 'newsreaders' for reading and writing news and mail.
     One very nice and intuitive one (needs MUI), and one "not-so-
     intuitive" one that works on every Amiga- or VT100-console.

      - importers and exporters for UUCP, FidoNet, Mausnet and Z-Netz.

      - everything needed for using UUCP or Z-Netz with UMS.
     The   other   importers/exporters  still  need  some  additional
     transport-oriented  tools  (e.g.  "TrapDoor"  (c) by  Maximilian
     Hantsch  and  Martin  Laubach  or "VLT" (c) by W.G.J. Langeveld,
     SLAC).

      - many  tools  that are useful and/or instructive in how to use
     UMS and write other tools.

      - an  Installer  ((c) Commodore-Amiga, Inc.) script to  install
     UMS  with  any  of  the above networks in a simple setup (i.e. a
     "point"- or "leaf"-node).

NEW FEATURES

      - improved Installer script
      -	several tools have been updated

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     AmigaDOS >=V2.0, >=3 MB RAM, >=2 MB hd

     MUI (Magic User Interface, (c) by Stefan Stuntz) recommended
     (but not needed)

     A modem (:-)
