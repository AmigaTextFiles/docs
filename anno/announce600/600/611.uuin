Status: RO


TITLE

  uuIn and uuOut

VERSION

  v1.01

AUTHOR

  Nicolas Dade / nicolas-dade@uiuc.edu	 (me)

DESCRIPTION

     Both uuIn and uuOut are very rapid uuencode/decoders.  They beat
anything currently available on aminet by a good margin, especially on
decoding.

     The usual set of features are supported, along with automatic file
splitting for the encoder and automatic non-data lines stripping for the
decoder (things like e-mail or net-news headers, personal comments, etc).

Both programs are pure so that they may be made resident.

     A uuencoding utility is used to prepare binary files for transmission
over text-only channels like e-mail and net-news.  Each triplet of bytes is
replaced by four ASCII characters, producing a file that looks like a lot
of uppercase and punctuation garbage.  A uudecoder can then decode this
ASCII into the original binary file.  Check out the *.binary.* newsgroups
for examples of uuencoded files.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Workbench 2.04 or higher is all that is required.

HOST NAME

  Any aminet site. For example, ftp.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4).

DIRECTORY

  /pub/aminet/util/arc/
