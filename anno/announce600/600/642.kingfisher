TITLE
     KingFisher

VERSION
     1.40

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION
     KingFisher is a special-purpose database for Fred Fish's library of
     freely distributable software.  KingFisher operates on a custom
     screen under AmigaDOS 1.3 or later (including 3.1) and splits the
     user- editable database over multiple (floppy) disk volumes.  Major
     features include flexible search expressions and a powerful text
     parser for the easiest database updates of any package like it.  An
     ARexx port allows KingFisher to service the users of BBSs.  Some
     features are available only when operating under Kickstart 2.04 or
     later.

NEW FEATURES
     This is a maintenance upgrade over versions 1.30 and 1.37.  Several
     reported problems have been fixed with regard to searches through
     ARexx (SEARCH RANGE and SEARCH MODE TITLE both were broken.) Some
     minor improvements to the user interface and the "AddFish" parser
     have also been made.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
     As much as 350K free RAM is required and at least one floppy drive.
     A harddisk is highly recommended, especially for running KingFisher
     for users of a BBS.

HOST NAME
     Any Aminet site (such as wuarchive.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4])

DIRECTORY
     /pub/aminet/fish/docs
