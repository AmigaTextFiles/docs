AUTHOR

     Mark R. Rinfret

DESCRIPTION

     MRBackup Professional is a full-featured hard disk backup program
     supporting Fast Disk, SCSI Tape and AmigaDOS backup modes.  Other
     features include:

     - Intuition "3-D" user interface

     - data compression/decompression

     - file selection filters and interactive file selection

     - rich ARexx command set providing access to virtually all MRBackup
       features and supporting automated backups and restores

     - built-in file management utilities

     - supports multiple savesets on a single tape as well as savesets
       that span multiple tapes

     - MRTape-Handler included, can be used with other software
     
     - integrated AmigaGuide (tm) online help, accessible via the
       Help key

     - easy installation via Commodore's Installer program (included)

     - non-proprietary backup format (info available to registered
       users)

     - available on MRsoftware support BBS as 
       AXSh:Downloads/MRsoftware/MRBK115.lha
       and on BIX, in the AMIGA area as MRBK115.lha
       (may also be available on AmiNet and other Amiga BBS's,
        but the author cannot provide precise info on this)

NEW FEATURES

     - enhanced floppy disk management (diskchange tracking),
       reduced user prompting

     - greatly improved floppy disk performance

     - major improvements in program robustness and ability
       to recover data from damaged savesets.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

     - any Amiga running AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher.

     - will run in 512K, 1MB recommended

     - hard drive not _specifically_ required, but a good idea :-)
  
PRICE

     MRBackup Professional is now shareware (again). The registration
     fee is $25.00 and entitles the user to one free upgrade and a
     laser-printed user manual.

DISTRIBUTABILITY

     MRBackup Professional is a shareware program, copyrighted by
     MRsoftware, 1990-1993. The MRBackup Professional full-disk
     archive is freely distributable, as long as its contents are
     not altered. No fee may be charged for the distribution of
     MRBackup Professional, other than customary media and duplication
     fees.

OTHER

     MRBackup Professional has a wealth of features which are not
     easily summed up in such a brief format. A three page laser-printed
     product brochure, giving a more in-depth overview, will be mailed
     upon request.

     BBS Instructions
     ----------------
     MRsoftware maintains a support BBS for MRBackup Professional and other
     programs developed by MRsoftware. The BBS phone number is
     401-841-5844 and supports 1200, 2400, 9600 and 14,400 baud connections.

     The BBS is based on the AXsh BBS software and is "piggy-backed" on the
     Amiga UUCP package. Because of this, you must respond to two Login:
     prompts. At the first, enter `bbs'. This activates the BBS. At the
     second Login: prompt, enter either `new' or your existing BBS login
     name. The BBS presents a user interface which is very similar to Unix.
     To browse the downloads directory, use the `ffe' (file front end) 
     command.
