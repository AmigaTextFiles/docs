PRODUCT

Amiga Envoy

DESCRIPTION

     Amiga Envoy is the standard Amiga peer-to-peer networking software
developed by Commodore's Amiga Networking Group.  Its performance,
user-interface and API are consistent with the philosophy of the Amiga
Operating System.  Amiga Envoy provides a simple messaging interface for
the easy development of reliable network applications.  Included
applications enable connected Amiga computers to share hard disks, CD-ROMs,
and printers transparently.  Third-party applications can provide
functionality such as electronic mail, remote computer access, multi-user
databases and multi-player games.

     To make Amiga Envoy available to end-users immediately, Intangible
Assets Manufacturing has licensed Amiga Envoy from Commodore.  IAM has
produced a manual written by Dale Larson, one of Amiga Envoy's original
designers.  The manual eases you through the set up and use of a simple
network.  Additional documentation will be available (at an additional
charge).  It will explain how to internetwork with Amiga Envoy, how to
develop software for it and how to use its security features.

     Intangible Assets Manufacturing supports the copies of Amiga Envoy it
distributes.  Support is provided through electronic and physical mail and
by answering questions in such public forums as UseNet's
comp.sys.amiga.datacomm, on CompuServe, and on Bix.
