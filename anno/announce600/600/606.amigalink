DESCRIPTION

AmigaLink is a network, based on the Peer-To-Peer principle.  The complete
network hardware is offered in a small adaptor for the external floppy
drive port.  The networking software allows connections between up to 20
Amigas, with full exchange of data and sharing of devices.  Each printer
hooked up to the network is accessible by all machines.  Machines can be
added or removed even while the network is running.  AmigaLink is
compatible with all Amigas (A500 through A4000 and CDTV), and a special
adaptor for CD32 is in preparation.  The data transfer rate is 450,000 bits
per second, the maximum length for the cabling is 300 feet (divided over a
maximum of 20 machines).  AmigaLink uses RG58 coaxial cable and BNC
connectors.
