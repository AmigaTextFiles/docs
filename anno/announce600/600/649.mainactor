DESCRIPTION

  MainActor is a modular animation package.

  It allows you to create,edit,time and play animations of the provided
  animation formats.

  You can convert any format into any other, allowing you to
  convert for example a range of pictures into an animation format
  of your choice, or resave the frames of an animation to an
  picture format, or simply to convert different picture formats.

  * Only available to registered users of MainActor and legal owners of the

  New features of Version 1.2

  - MainActor/MainView now have a center option which allows highly
    accurate centration of your images or animations.

  - New BorderBlank option.

  - MainActor has a new window called Project Information Window.  The
    new functions included in the window are:

       * An information window which will give you detailed
         descriptions of your current animation or picture list.

       * You can now view the size and time profiles of your projects
         as a graphical representation.

       * You can compare the decompression times of your projects
         through new timer functions.

  - New GIF/FLI/FLC/DL loader modules and FLI/FLC saver modules.

  - Chunky pixel modules (GIF/FLI/FLC) will fly if loaded through
    universal modules which support graphic cards (like
    Universal_PicassoII etc.). You can of course also view them on
    your native chipset as normal.

  - Introduction of a new (light) registration package. It does not
    have the handbook or the disk based updates but is cheaper.

  - You can now use the save/append functions again, even if you have
    not registered MainActor. You will have to deal with requesters
    though.

  General Features:
  
  -Intelligent caching/tracking, MainActor can cache your animations and
   picture lists, if you have not enough memory it will directly access
   your data from any device. This makes it for example possible to
   create/edit/play a 400MB animation on your 2MB Amiga.

  -If you run OS 3.0 or higher, you will get an extra speed bonus on
   animations through the use of the new graphics routines.
   For OS2.0/2.1 users there are specific routines in the modules, which
   will give them the best playback speed possible on their system
   (and my knowledge :)).

  -Under OS 3.0 you will get the extra features of showing pictures or
   playing animations in a scrollable, resizable window on your MainActor
   or Workbench screen. The colors will be properly adjusted to your screen
   attributes.

  -MainActor has an arexx port, nearly all functions can be accessed through
   it. You can for example scale or dither whole animations through
   the use of an image processor, scripts are included.
