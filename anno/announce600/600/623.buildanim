TITLE

     BuildAnim

VERSION

     2.0 (30-Nov-93)

AUTHOR

     Christer Sundin, d8sunch@dtek.chalmers.se

DESCRIPTION

     BuildAnim is an animation utility, and it can do three different
     operations: 1) It can build an animation out of individual ILBM
     pictures, 2) it can split an animation, and save the frames as
     ILBM pictures, or 3) it can convert an animation from one ANIM
     compression type to another.

     Several compression types are supported: 2, 3, 5, 7 and 'J', but
     BuildAnim can only create type 5 and 7 animations.

NEW FEATURES

     These are some of the changes since version 1.5:

     o Completely rewritten using C. The compression and decompression
       routines are kept in assembler, though.

     o BuildAnim can now also split and convert animations.

     o Reading and writing is buffered, to maximize throughput.

     o BuildAnim can read ANIM types 2, 3, 5, 7, and 'J', and write
       ANIM types 5 and 7.

     o Options can be saved in an envrinoment variable.

REQUIREMENTS

     Kickstart 2.04 or higher.
