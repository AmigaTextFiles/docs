DESCRIPTION

        Yak stands for "Yet Another Kommodity" (never was any good at
        spelling), and is a mouse/window manipulation program along the
        same lines as DMouse, KCommodity and lets you activate screens 
        and windows, inserting localized date. It offers more than the 
        AutoPoint Commodore standard commodity and it's only 30 Kb long!


FEATURES

        A lot! Among them : AutoActivation of windows, extensible hotkey 
        system (like FKey's) with a lot of different actions
        

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

        OS release 2.04 or greater is required; Yak has been tested with
        OS releases through 3.0.
        Distribution is archived with lha so program to un-archive them
        is needed.

        - a dutch catalog and installation script (thanks Patrick van Beem)
        - a german documentation (thanks Ingolf Koch)
        - an italian documentation (thanks Alex Galassi)
        - Bug fixed in finding which window is under mouse when several 
          screens are visible at the same time on display. 
        - New behavior of ClickToFront, it now behaves as ClickToBack 
          regarding screens if "Cycle Screens" toggle is selected.
        - AutoPoint Delay is now configurable from 0 to 5 by step of 10 ms.
