DESCRIPTION

	FED-CASE()) for the Amiga is a software tool that can assist 
	the design of software. 

	FED-CASE()) consists of a graphical environment 
	to design flows the  flowchart editor and a source code 
	generator that generates direct compilable C source code.

	The generated code can be used to be compiled for any other 
	C-compiler on any computer system.

	The FED-CASE()) code generator generates C-source code according 
	to the C source code definition. This is including the 
	declaration and prototyping part of the source code.
	The code generator will automatically do the type casting.
	An auto-comment function will take care of commenting the C source
	code with all kind of helpfull information. The source code
	generator will take care of the includes and put all the required
	includes into the source code.

	It is possible to generate source code for a C compiler 
	on an UNIX operating system or a PC operating system.

	The demo version is available on:
