 Here are some screenshots from a new Kick 1.3 emu: WIN DOS.

 There are so many emulators, but this time, it`s in a window!! That
 brings up a very cool effect and the best of it:

 HD is supported at WB1.3. This is a little ROM Hack, but it works
 fine at this time! But I don`t know if I shall write all harddisks
 and other routines.

 If there`s enough interest, that I shall finish this project, please
 send me a postcard! (I`m collecting them)

 Please send them to:

 OK, let`s see what to do...
