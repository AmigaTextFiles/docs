@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}
                                        

                   @{b} SAdENESS PD & N.F.A. presents:@{ub}

                  @{b}---  AGA Experience Volume 1. ---@{ub}

On the market today there seems to be a CD covering virtually every subject.
Before starting this CD,we decided that we wanted to create a CD that got the
very best out of the 'new' (around 3 years old!) AGA machines. On this CD you
will find hundreds of games, slideshows, utiities and demos which take full
advantage of the superior AGA chipset found in the A1200/4000 (at the time of
writing), if you have one of these machines you have come to the right place.

We decided from the start that we wanted to have as much of the contents as
possible ready to run straight from the CD. Some CDs have everything 
compressed which is in my opinion is really defeating the object of CD. Why
shouldn't you be able to use as much as possible straight from the CD? Due
to this, we have also stayed away from confusing menu systems, and have
opted for the approach most people should be happy with - a MagicWorkbench
front-end with virtually everything accessible through a standard
double-click with the mouse button. With most things ready to run, this CD 
holds slightly less than some other CDs, but I think for most people having
well over 700 meg (decompressed) is enough! 

We have worked very hard for many months on @{b}The AGA Experience@{ub}, and have done
our very best to ensure it is of the very highest quality.

@node SystemRequirements "System Requirements"

@{b}SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS@{ub}

Most of the programs on @{b}The AGA Experience@{ub} compilation were designed for
use on an Amiga computer which is running a minimum of Workbench 3.0 or
higher. A lot of the programs on this CD also require the AGA chipset, 
which at the time of writing includes A1200s and A4000s. Some of the 
programs on this CD will also run on the CD32 but may require hardware
that is not available on the stock CD32 console.

@{b}Minimum Requirements@{ub}

WB 2.04+
2 meg RAM.
CDROM drive (duh - really???)
Amiga (double duh!)
68000 processor.
ECS Chipset.

@{b}Recommended Requirements@{ub}

WB 3.0+
2 meg RAM (or more).
Double Speed CDROM drive (or faster).
Amiga 1200 (or higher).
68020 processor (or higher).
AGA Chipset (or Graphics card).


To fully utilize the programs on the disc, using the CD32 system, you
may need to add the optional keyboard, mouse, floppy drive, and RGB
monitor.  Some of the files in this collection may be stored in compressed
formats and need to be decompressed to a floppy or hard disk to run. Due to
the fact that this CD is NOT BOOTABLE, if you wish to use it on a standard
CD32, you will have to use some sort of file transfer program in conjunction
with a bootable CD. If you are not sure about this, we would be pleased
to advise.

@node "Exclusive NFA Productions" "Exclusive NFA Productions"

@{b}Exclusive NFA Productions@{ub}

On this CD, there are 14 Exclusive Titles. 

3 Slideshows which include Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and a BodyShop/Big 
Girls special. 

8 Card Sets which include Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, BodyShop I,II & III,
Babes Galore, Scenic and Wings & Wheels.

These Exclusive programs are ready to run this CD, and may NOT be re-sold by
any other PD library.

3 Disk Magazines, which are: Out Of Space issue 1, 2 & 3.

These programs are official NFA productions, and were written specifically
for the 'AGA Experience volume one'.

@node "AGA Utilities" "AGA Utilities"

@{b}AGA Utilities@{ub}

On this CD there are over 100 meg of the best Amiga utilities. Most of them
require a minimum of WB3, but some others require WB2.04+ There are two
drawers - Ready_To_Run and DMS Utilities. The DMS files need to be copied 
to a floppy drive,and this can be done by simply double-clicking on the icon.
You must then put a disk in drive DF0: and the disk will be copied to it 
(make sure the disk has nothing you want on it because the contents will 
be lost). There is an index in the drawer that lists the contents, and
there are separate directorys containing the files in order to keep the
clutter down. 

During the production of this CD, as newer versions of programs became
available, we replaced the older versions. This helps to ensure that the 
programs are all up-to-date.

@endnode

@node "AGA Demos" "AGA Demos"

@{b}AGA Demos@{ub}

On this CD there are over 150 meg of the best demos specifically for the AGA
Amiga, ie, 1200/4000.  From our selection, we've picked the best demos to 
date since the A1200 was released.  

@{b}DMS Files@{ub}
Over 130 meg of demos are DMS files, to access these, double click on the 
icon you require, a prompt will then instruct you to insert a blank disk into 
drive DF0: Once you've done that,simply press return and the disk you require 
will unpack onto your disk ready to boot.  

@{b}Ready To Run@{ub}
We've selected the best demos we could find for you to use directly from the
CD.  To run these demos, simply double click on the icon and the demo will
then run.  Some demos will NOT allow you to exit back to Workbench,so at this
point you will have to reset your machine.  We've tried our best to ensure
all ready to run demos run efficiently.  

@endnode

@node "AGA Slideshows" "AGA Slideshows"

@{b}AGA Slideshows@{ub}

On this disk we have selected over 150 meg of slideshows.  

To unpack a slideshow, simply double-click on the icon. Multidisk slideshows
are in their own directory so you need to unpack all the disks for the 
required slideshow to run.

Before you unpack, them read the description and make sure the slideshow 
is suitable for you or your child.  We've tried our best to ensure you there 
is no porn on this CD, but there are naked women!  There is no hard material 
but if you would prefer your child not to look at these slideshows,we suggest 
you stop him/her from unpacking them. 

@endnode

@node "AGA Games" "AGA Games"

@{b}AGA Games@{ub}

We have selected over 120 meg of AGA games for this CD.

@{b}DMS Files@{ub}
There are over 80 meg of games in DMS format.  These DMS's must be unpacked
for you to be able to run them.  To unpack them simply double click on the
icon you require and insert a blank disk into drive df0: the game will then
be unpacked onto the disk ready to boot from floppy.

Note: some games will require a hard drive to run them, so obviously they
will not boot.

@{b}Ready To Run Games@{ub}
We have selected 40 meg of the best games for you run straight from the CD.
To run these games just simply click into the requested drawer and double
click onto the games main icon.

Note: During testing some of the titles did not run on our accelerated 
Amiga 4000/040, but we are confident they should run on an Amiga 1200
but obviously we cannot be certain of this.  Please let us know if you find
any programs which do not run on your Amiga.

@endnode

@node "AGA Pictures" "AGA Pictures"
 
@{b}AGA Pictures@{ub}

On this CD we have selected over 14 meg of the best pictures available and 
ready for you to view at your pleasure.

To view a picture simply double-click on the icon you require.  The picture
will then automatically be viewed.

If you are running this CD on an A1200, please allow time for the JPEGS to 
load, they are very slow at loading on a 1200, but please be patient.

If you are running the 'NEWICONS' package, you will see small 'thumbnail'
versions of the pictures so you can see what they are like through Workbench.
This works best if your WB is in 64 colours.

@endnode


@node "AGA Texts" "AGA Texts"

@{b}AGA Texts@{ub}

On this CD there are various text files and other useful souces of 
information. There is, for example, a detailed Amiga 4000 guide which tells 
you everything you will (probably) ever need to know about the machine, 
and also a few details about the A1200. There are details on connecting 
a CD32 to an Amiga, some useful Internet information and some reviews of
popular upgrades. All of these files in this directory are ready-to-run
straight from the CD.

@endnode

@node "AGA Programmers" "AGA Programmers"

@{b}AGA Programmers@{ub}

On this CD you will find some AGA Programs and source code that coders will
hopefully find useful. There is no index for this directory, as all the
directory names are pretty self-explanatory. Also, I don't really know
anything about programming, so any description I attach would be poor at
best and probably just plain wrong!!

@endnode

@node "Music Modules" "Music Modules"

@{b}Music Modules@{ub}

We have selected over 7 meg of the best music modules we could find. On other
CD's you tend to get a lot of mods repeated, on this CD we have tried to get
them from original sources.  

To run a music module, you simply have todouble click on the icon you require.

If the selected module will not play, this means you have'nt got enough 
memory to play it.  The mods on this CD are quite large, so if you haven't 
got much memory, you will probably find that a lot of them will not play.

@endnode


@node "Disk Mags" "Disk Mags"

@{b}Disk Mags@{ub}

On this cd are over 20 megs of the best Amiga disk mags. These include the
complete 1995 collection (to date) of the Amiga Report online magazine, which 
we specially licenced this CD. There is also the brilliant Aliens multimedia
AGA magazine, and many others. In the DMS drawer are most of the AGA diskmags
available including the great 'Word' by NFA, and the great new 'Out of Space' 
Diskmags also from NFA.

@{b}Magic Workbench@{ub}

Too many times in the past have we been very dissapointed by the look of
a new CD. This is why for @{b}The AGA Experience@{ub} we have decided to
use the very popluar "MagicWB" colour scheme and icons. This has made our
CD an absolute joy to use, and  real treat for the eyes. MagicWB was
created by @{i}Martin Huttenloher.@{ui} In order to fully utilise this
new Workbench look for those not already using it, we have supplied
everything you need to change over. We have also supplied the full 
MagicWB1.2p package, and also a demo version of the great new MagicWB2.0.

Once again, I @{b}HIGHLY@{ub} recommend you register MagicWB in order to
receive V2 as this will make your Amiga much more professional looking,
and you will be able to hold your head high in the company of Mac/PC owners!
