@title "MP 1.03"

1) Where to get:
 - Aminet   58KB   aminet/gfx/show/mp103.lha

2) What it can play:

   MPEG type: MPEG-1 Video Stream
   Dither types:

     ordered       use simple ordered dithering
     ordered2      a faster ordered dither. This is the default.
     mbordered     ordered dithering at the macroblock level.
     fs4           Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 4 error values propagated
     fs2           Floyd-Steinberg dithering with 2 error values propagated
     fs2fast       a faster fs2
     hybrid        Hybrid dithering, a combination of ordered dithering for
                      luminance and fs2 dithering for chrominance. Errors are
                      not propagated properly.
     hybrid2       Hybrid dithering with error propagation among pixels.
     2x2           A dithering technique using a 2x2 pixel area for each
                      pixel. The image displayed is 4 times larger than the
                      original image encoded. Random error terms are added to
                      each pixel to break up contours and gradients.
     gray          Grayscale dithering. The image is dithered into 16
                      grayscales. Chrominance information is thrown away.
     gray8         Grayscale dithering with 256 grayscales (AGA only).
     color         'True' color display with 4 bits luminance and 2*2 bits
                      for chrominance.
     ham6          'True' color display using HAM approximation. For each
                      pixel either red, green or blue are set correctly and
                      the other color components are the same as the pixel to
                      the left. As the name implies this uses the 6bit HAM mode
                      and is limited to 4096 possible colors.
     none          no dithering is done, no image is displayed. Used to time
                      the decoding process.
     mono          Floyd-Steinberg dithering in black and white.
     threshold     Simple thresholding in black and white.
     ham8          'True' color display using HAM approximation. In HAM8
                      mode you have a 18bit color palette for a maximum of 256k
                      colors produced by mp. This mode produces finer gradients
                      than ham6 but it is significantly slower.

  GFX cards modes:

     opal15         and
     opal24         generate a 15bit or 24bit display on the OpalVision.
                       Playback speed is somewhat slower than for the native
                       Amiga graphic. This requires the opal.library to be
                       present in the LIBS: directory.
     village24      generates a 24bit display on the PicassoII board. This
                       requires the PicassoII software to be installed
                       properly. You don't need to redirect the Workbench to
                       the PicassoII board nor use the ChangeScreen commodity
                       as the player directly talks to the PicassoII driver
                       software. The player will open a display as large as
                       necessary which will be 320x240 for most MPEG files if
                       you have the latest Picasso software. I talked to the
                       VillageTronic people to support a 352x288 mode as well
                       which is the standard resolution for full screen MPEGs
                       (in PAL).
                       The player cannot be retargeted by the Picasso's
                       Intuition driver, so the standard dither modes will
                       get the native Amiga display.
     retina24       generates a 24bit display on the Retina board. This
                       requires the Retina software to be installed properly.
                       The player was tested with version 1.3 of the Retina
                       software. The player uses the standard screen dimensions
                       for the 24bit display. You can change the resolution
                       with the Retina software, you will probably prefer the
                       lowest resolution to get the largest image size on the
                       screen.
     egs24          generates a 'true color' display on any hardware
                       supported by the EGS libraries. Dithering and rendering
                       is done by EGS while the player just supplies the 24bit
                       raw data. If you have an EGS supported 24bit board this
                       means you will see full 24bit. In any case the _default_
                       EGS screen is used, you can choose the dimensions and
                       depth with the EGS preferences tools.

3) Future:

 I don't know if there are going to be any new versions
 (Michael is a bit lazy ;))

4) On what machines it works:

 - 68020 or higher CPU. Some thoughts went into that decision since it rules out
   many people in viewing MPEGs but IMHO a 68000 is way too slow to decode MPEG
   at a useful rate. Even an 68030/25MHz is quite slow, at least with this
   program.

 - about 2MB memory. The program uses table lookups for some functions,
   especially the HAM rendering code and the hybrid dithering need a large
   table. Other display and dithering options can live with less memory.

 - AmigaOS 2.0 or higher. Well, everyone should have updated to AmigaOS2.0.
   Compatibility to AmigaOS1.3 would have added more special cases. I also
   believe that people who can afford an accelerated Amiga have no problems
   with that requirement and it made some functions a bit easier.

@node Amipeg
@title "aMiPEG 0.7"

1) Where to get:
 - Aminet  150KB   aminet/gfx/show/aMiPEG_0.7.lha

   The official aMiPEG WWW page is:
   http://wfmh.man.szczecin.pl/amipeg
   where you can always download the newest version.

   There is also a NEWSGROUP aMiPEG, you can subscribe by:
   write on:
   amipeg-request@wfmh.man.szczecin.pl
   and as EMail body write:
   subscribe your-EMail

2) What it can play:

   MPEG type: MPEG-1 Video Stream
   DITHER types:
          The possible values are:
                color           - lores HAM8 screen
                hiresham        - hires HAM8 screen (better but slower)
                ham6            - for OCS users
                cybergfx        - 15/16/24-bit CyberGraphX display
                cybergfxgray    - gray display on 15/16/24-bit screen
                gray            - gray display on 8-bit screen
                none            - no display at all

3) Future:

 TODO    (sorted by priority)

        * 96 pixels or 80 pixels wide animations look awful.
          New scaling modes are not ready yet.
        * MPEG audio is on its way. The demo codec from DEC is running,
          Tobias Bading's maplay is ported to Amiga and rewritten for integer
          arithmetic ...
        * MPEG-2 (but it may happened in completly new player)

4) On what machines it works:

  AGA chipset is recommended, OS 2.04 or up required. With version 0.3,
  rendering to a HAM6 screen is supported. From version 0.5 CyberGraphX is
  supported. Versions optimized for 68020 and 68040 are provided.

  Implied with the usage of MPEG is some speedy processor as well. 68020
  will do, but don't expect too much. "DebbieHarry.mpeg", which I use for
  testing purposes, is played with 1.0 fps on my chipmem-only A1200 (PAL
  screen), compared with 6.5 fps on the A4000/040 (Euro72 screen) and
  3.1 fps on an A2000 with 28Mhz 2630 (PAL screen). On the A4000/040 with
  CyberVision64 and CyberGraphX 2.15 it managed 7.1 fps on 24-bit screen
  in color and 11.0 fps on the same screen in gray. 

  For recompilation, SAS/C and Devpac assembler is required. Other compilers
  and/or assemblers may work with some fiddling.

@node XingPlay
@title "XingPlay 1.0final"

1) Where to get:
 - Aminet   22KB   aminet/gfx/show/XingPlay.lha

 Probably also on
     http://www.ifi.uio.no/~carla/triumph/
 Or send EMail to author

2) What it can play:

   MPEG type: MPEG-1 Video Stream
   Output types:
    CyberGraphics 32 bit mode (provided your card has one!)
    CyberGraphics 16 bit mode
    CyberGraphics  8 bit mode in grey
    AGA HAM8 mode   (AGA default)
    AGA Grey8 mode
    ECS Grey4 mode  (ECS default)

  To select pixel mode:

     1x1 pixel mode
     This gives you 160x120 with 1x1 pixels centered on the screen.

     1x1 pixel mode, black dither
     160x120 scaled to full screen, but only every other pixel on
     every other row is set.

     2x2 pixel mode               (default)
     160x120 scaled to full screen with 2x2 pixels.

3) Future:

 It's FINAL version so there won't be NEW versions (hope not).
 Under this text are some futures/bugs of XingPlay

What's hot...
-------------

   * the fastest Xing-Mpeg player available for the Amiga!

   * supports Cybergraphics with custom made render routines
     for all 16 and 32 bit modes

   * very fast 2x2 AGA HAM8 mode

   * extremely fast GREY modes!

   * even works on ECS based machines in 16 color grey mode!

   * double buffering in all modes!

   * loads entire Mpeg at once


...and what's not
-----------------

   * crashes badly for no reason at all :-)

   * somewhat system friendly, but not too much

   * probably trashes the sprite pointer on non-cgfx systems

   * Cybergfx modes are more reliable than the AGA/ECS modes

   * unsupported, I won't provide any upgrades

4) On what machines it works:

- An amiga :-)
- A 68020 processor or better
- OS 3.0+ is nice, but it has been reported to work on 2.0 systems

2) What it can play:

   MPEG type: MPEG-1 Video Stream
   Dither types:
      Ordered, Color

3) Future:

 Following will be implemented in one of the later versions:
  - Fix some inconsistensies
  - More time to rework this and other public projects
  - To write a "real" #?.guide file (and clean up the docs...)
  - A STARTFRAME/K/N and STOPFRAME/K/N to load, decode and play only a
    part of the video.
  - Support for mpegsystem.datatype. I decided to rebuild
    mpegsystem.datatype from scratch. Instead of using an inbuild video
    and audio decoder, mpegsystem.datatype will be a subclass of
    mpegvideo.datatype and use the mpegaudio.datatype for the audio
    decoding.

4) On what machines it works:

  - You need at least Kick/WB 3.0.
  - "datatypes/animation.datatype", >= V39.
    "animation.datatype 40.7 (28.09.93)" requires itself some
    libraries/boopsi
  - "realtime.library", >= V39            - for timing
  - "gadgets/tapedeck.gadget" (any version) - for the controls

  - Much memory (at least 2MB (I think... (test report recommned))
    (or the "vmm.library" V3.0 from Martin Apel's VMM package.

  - The IEEE versions (#?ieee directories) requires the
    "mathieeedoubbas.library" (V38 or higher) library in your LIBS:
    (or something equal) directory.

@title "Speed results for MPEG players"

 All tests have been made on 040/40Mhz. MPEG animations were in RAM
 (XingPlay always reload anim. first) and can be found on Aminet.
 The bigges problem was XingPlay because in my collection of MPEG
 I found only ONE working with it ! I'll try to find FULL SCREEN
 (like warp-s1.mpg) MPEG that works OK on aMiPEG and XingPlay,
 but for now I had to use this:

1) warp-s1.mpg        pix/mpg 1.3M
                         size 352 x 288 pixels
                  compression 1:55.5
                       frames 240

2) bigbend.mpg       pix/anim 352K
                         size 160 x 120 pixels
                  compression 1:30.9
                       frames 193
