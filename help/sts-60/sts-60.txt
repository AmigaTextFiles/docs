STS-60 Shuttle Amateur Radio EXperiment (SAREX)

     Students in the U.S. and Russia will have a chance to
speak via amateur radio with astronauts aboard the Space
Shuttle Discovery during STS-60.  Ground-based amateur radio
operators ("hams") will be able to contact the Shuttle through
automated computer-to-computer amateur (packet) radio link.
There also will be voice contacts with the general ham
community as time permits.

     Shuttle commander Charles Bolden (license pending) and
mission specialists Ronald Sega (license pending) and Sergei K.

rikalev (call sign U5MIR) will talk with students in 5 schools
in the U.S. and Russia using "ham radio."

     Students in the following schools will have the
opportunity to talk directly with orbiting astronauts for
approximately 4 to 8 minutes:

    *  Boise Senior High School, Boise, Idaho (WA7QKD)
    *  Chariton High School, Chariton, Iowa  (KB0IWE)
    *  James Bean School, Sidney, Maine (N1IFP)
    *  Mars Area Middle School, Mars, Penn (N3HKN)
    *  House of Science and Technology for Youth,
       Central Moscow,  Russia (UA3CR)

     The radio contacts are part of the SAREX (Shuttle Amateur
Radio EXperiment) project, a joint effort by NASA, the American
Radio Relay League (ARRL), and the Radio Amateur Satellite
Corporation (AMSAT)

     The project, which has flown on 11 previous Shuttle
missions, is designed to encourage public participation in the
space program and support the conduct of educational
initiatives through a program to demonstrate the effectiveness
of communications between the Shuttle and low-cost ground
stations using amateur radio voice and digital techniques.

     Information about orbital elements, contact times,
frequencies and crew operating schedules will be available
during the mission from NASA, ARRL (Steve Mansfield, 203/666-
1541) and AMSAT (Frank Bauer, 301/ 286-8496).  AMSAT will
provide information bulletins for interested parties on
INTERNET and amateur packet radio.

     The ham radio club at the Johnson Space Center, (W5RRR),
will be operating on amateur short wave frequencies, and the
ARRL station (W1AW) will include SAREX information in its
regular voice and teletype bulletins.

     There will be a SAREX information desk during the mission
in the Johnson Space Center newsroom.  Mission information will
be available on the computer bulletin board (BBS).  To reach
the bulletin board, use JSC BBS (8 N 1 1200 baud): dial 713-
483-2500, then type 62511.

     The amateur radio station at the Goddard Space Flight
Center, (WA3NAN), will operate around the clock during the
mission, providing  SAREX information and retransmitting live
Shuttle air-to-ground audio.



STS-60 SAREX Frequencies

     Routine SAREX transmissions from the Space Shuttle may be
monitored on a worldwide downlink frequency of 145.55 MHz.

     The voice uplink frequencies are (except Europe):
          144.91 MHz
          144.93
          144.95
          144.97
          144.99

      The voice uplink frequencies for Europe only are:
          144.70
          144.75
          144.80

Note:   The astronauts will not favor any one of the above
frequencies.  Therefore, the ability to talk with an astronaut
depends on selecting one of the above frequencies chosen by the
astronaut.

        The worldwide amateur packet frequencies are:

Packet downlink        145.55 MHz
Packet uplink          144.49 MHz

     The Goddard Space Flight Center amateur radio club planned
HF operating frequencies:
             .860 MHz      7.185 MHz
              4.295        21.395
                           28.650

HOW CAN I USE MY SHORTWAVE RADIO FOR NEWS AND INFORMATION ABOUT SAREX
AND TO EAVESDROP ON THE ASTRONAUTS?

[Ed. Note: This information is provided by the American Radio Relay League's
           Educational Activities Department]

During a shuttle mission carrying the SAREX payload, news and Astronaut
re- transmissions are carried on these Amateur Radio stations:

Goddard Amateur Radio Club (Greenbelt, MD) Amateur Radio station WA3NAN,
news and re-transmissions on high frequency (HF) bands at 3.86, 7.185,
14.295, 21.395, and 28.65 MHz and on VHF at 147.45 MHz.

Johnson Space Center Amateur Radio Club (Houston, TX), Amateur Radio
station W5RRR, news bulletins on HF bands at 3.850, 7.227, 14.280, 21.350, and
28.400 MHz and VHF at 146.64 MHz.

ARRL (Newington, CT) Amateur Radio station W1AW, news bulletins (9:45
PM, 12:45 AM EST) on HF bands at 3.99, 7.29, 14.29, 18.16, 21.39, 28.59 
and VHF at 147.555 MHz.

These stations, and several VHF and UHF repeater groups, will re-transmit the
signals on most amateur bands so that you and the students can hear the
communications.  You will hear NASA Mission Commentary, frequent bulletins to
advise listeners of astronaut-planned transmissions, and amateur two-way voice
and amateur television transmissions with the shuttles.  Using a simple
hand-held transceiver, you can open the world of science to hundreds of
youngsters. Students themselves can take part in the shuttle flight via
a packet message, and some will even be able to talk directly to the
astronauts in orbit.

Listen also to the ARRL Bulletins on W1AW (see the ARRL's monthly journal,
"QST", for Morse code and voice bulletins) on a daily basis; and to the AMSAT
International Satellite Nets on Tuesdays, 3.840 MHz, 0130Z to 0300Z, and on
Sundays, 14.282 MHz, 1800Z to 2100Z, +/- QRM.




SAREX PAYLOAD DESCRIPTION AND MISSION OVERVIEW

[Ed. Note: This information is provided by the American Radio Relay
League's
           Educational Activities Department]

This section contains a general payload description and a mission overview.

Payload Description

Configuration A - SAREX configuration A (see description of apparatus, below)
consists of a suite of amateur radio equipment, much of which was flown
previously on STS-51 F and STS-9. Configuration A is comprised of a low power
handheld Frequency Modulation (FM) transceiver, a spare battery set, an
Interface (I/F) module, an SAREX headset assembly, an equipment assembly
cabinet, a Television (TV) camera and monitor, a Payload General Support
Computer (PGSC) and an antenna capable of being mounted in one of the Orbiter's
flight deck windows. The equipment assembly houses power supplies, a Slow Scan
Television (SSTV) converter, and a packet radio Terminal Node Controller (TNC).

SAREX configuration A is capable of communicating with amateur radio stations
within Line Of Sight (LOS) of the Orbiter in any one of three modes, e.g.,
voice, SSTV or data. In the latter two modes, the equipment can be operated
either attended or unattended. In the attended method of operation, the
operator manually provides the equipment with TV pictures (using the TV camera)
or computer data (using the PGSC keyboard) and observes the TV picture on the
monitor or printed text via the PGSC screen. In the unattended method of
operation, the operator turns the equipment on and attends to other duties
occasionally observing the SAREX equipment operation.

The function of each of the SAREX configuration A equipment suite is
summarized
as follows:

      a. Handheld transceiver - Receives and transmits FM voice, SSTV or packet
radio signals in the two meter (144 to 146 MHz) Amateur Band.

      b. I/F module - Serves to provide a means of interconnecting the SAREX
equipment with the standard crew microphone/headset or the SAREX headset
assembly and standard crew personal tape recorder.  The I/F module also
interconnects the handheld transceiver with the equipment assembly
cabinet.

      c. Equipment assembly cabinet - Houses the SSTV converter, packet radio
TNC, power supplies and switches, displays and connectors.

         1.  SSTV converter - Takes normal TV from the camera or Shuttle TV
distribution system and makes still pictures which can be transmitted in a
voice bandwidth radio circuit and takes still TV frames transmitted up on a
voice bandwidth radio circuit and converts them for viewing on a standard TV
monitor.

         2.  Packet  TNC - Interconnects a computer with a radio transceiver so
that data to and from the computer is transmitted to and received from other
stations in bursts of characters using a special Amateur Radio developed
protocol.  This protocol includes error correction and station addressing
features.

      d. TV camera - Allows scenes in the Orbiter as well as external scenes
available through the various windows to be televised and sent to the SSTV
converter.

      e. TV monitor - Allows viewing of TV pictures from the SSTV converter.

      f. Antenna - Permits the radio signals to and from the handheld
transceiver to be transmitted and received through one of the Orbiter's windows
while limiting the leakage of radio frequency (RF) energy into the cabin.

      g. PGSC - Serves as a data terminal for the packet radio portion of the
experiment.



Configuration B - SAREX configuration B consists only of the handheld
transceiver, I/F module, spare battery set, SAREX headset assembly, personal
tape recorder, and the window antenna. It is capable only of exchanging voice
communications with amateur stations within LOS of the Orbiter.  Configuration B
can be operated only in the attended mode.

Configuration C - SAREX configuration C consists of the handheld transceiver,
I/F module, PGSC, spare battery set, window antenna, packet module, SAREX
headset assembly, personal recorder, and the required cable assemblies.  The
packet module contains a power supply and packet TNC. The power supply provides
power for the TNC and the handheld transceiver. The TNC interconnects with a
radio transceiver so that data to and from the computer is transmitted to and
received from other amateur radio stations. Configuration C is capable of
operating in either the voice or data mode in communications with amateur
stations within LOS of the Orbiter. This configuration can be operated in the
attended mode for voice communication and either the attended or automatic mode
for data communications.

Configuration D - SAREX configuration D is the same as configuration A except
that a Fast Scan Television (FSTV) module is added to the antenna assembly. The
FSTV module contains a receiving RF preamplifier and a video decoder that
provides NTSC video for SAREX. This configuration communicates with amateur
stations within LOS of the Orbiter in one of four modes, e.g., voice, SSTV,
data, or FSTV. The voice mode is operated in the attended mode while SSTV,
data, or FSTV can be operated in either the attended or unattended mode.

Configuration E - SAREX configuration E is virtually identical to configuration
D, except that instead of using the VCR/Monitor normally provided, the Shuttle
provided Video Interface Unit (VIU) is used in place.  In this configuration,
video from the FSTV or SSTV is viewed on color monitor in the orbiter.  This
modification results in a 50% reduction in SAREX payload weight.


Mission Overview

Integrated Ground Operations.- After the payload is initially prepared, it is
transported to the Orbiter integration facility. The payload is installed in
the Orbiter at the launch pad.

Flight Operations.- Operation in-flight will be limited to usage during
off-duty hours by crew members who have Amateur Radio licenses.

Postlanding.- After landing, the payload is removed from the Orbiter and
returned to the customer at JSC.
MISSION OPERATIONS:-

The mission operations section includes a definition of requirements and
constraints.


Payload Control Parameters

The payload control weight and payload control dimensions define the maximum
weight and dimensions of the payload for NSTS (National Space Transportation
System) mission planning purposes. A  payload may not exceed its control weight
or control dimensions without NSTS approval.

The payload control weights are as follows:

   Configuration A   60 lb (27.21 kg)
   Configuration B   35 lb (15.90 kg)
   Configuration C   45 lb (20.41 kg)
   Configuration D   70 lb (31.75 kg)
   Configuration E   35 lb (15.90 kg) - approx.

All configuration A and D payload equipment, except the window antenna, will be
stowed in one and one half middeck locker volumes. The window antenna will be
stowed in the Orbiter window shade bag.  All configuration B and C payload
equipment, except the window antenna, will be stowed in one half locker volume.
The window antenna will be stowed in the Orbiter window shade bag.

For configurations A, C, and D a PGSC can be used to provide the middeck SPOC
(Shuttle Payload Operations Contractor) function which would eliminate the
requirement to carry a second SPOC. In this configuration SAREX would be
operated on a non-interference basis with SPOC requirements.


Operational Requirements and Constraints

The following payload operational requirements and constraints will be used in
the flight planning and implementation of the STS/payload mission.  Requirements
that impose flight design and/or crew activity constraints will be implemented
to the extent practical within primary payload objectives or mission objectives
as determined by the NSTS.


Launch Readiness - Prelaunch Constraints:

The payload will be in final lift-off configuration when installed in the
Orbiter. At this time, the payload will be capable of sustaining this
configuration indefinitely without access or NSTS support.


Launch Commit Criteria:  The payload will not constrain launch.

On-orbit.- All SAREX operations will be conducted in the 2 meter (144 to 146
MHz) band utilizing FM.

Operating times for the SAREX payload will be such as to not interfere with any
other planned mission activities. The payload operating times will be logged
via the standard crew personal tape recorder or the PGSC, as appropriate. The
customer will identify the desired ground locations expected to be used for
SAREX payload operations prior to the flight.


SPACE SHUTTLE ABORT MODES

     Space Shuttle launch abort philosophy aims toward safe and
intact recovery of the flight crew, Orbiter and its payload.
Abort modes include:

        * Abort-To-Orbit (ATO) -- Partial loss of main engine
thrust late enough to permit reaching a minimal 105-nautical
mile orbit with orbital maneuvering system engines.

        * Abort-Once-Around (AOA) -- Earlier main engine shutdown
with the capability to allow one orbit around before landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

        * TransAtlantic Abort Landing (TAL) -- Loss of one or
more main engines midway through powered flight would force a
landing at either Zaragoza, Spain; Ben Guerir, Morocco; or
Moron, Spain.

        * Return-To-Launch-Site (RTLS) -- Early shutdown of one
or more engines, and without enough energy to reach Zaragoza,
would result in a pitch around and thrust back toward KSC until
within gliding distance of the Shuttle Landing Facility.
 
     STS-60 contingency landing sites are the Kennedy Space
Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Zaragoza, Ben Guerir, or Moron.
