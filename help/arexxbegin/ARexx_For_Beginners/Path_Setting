If clicking on the INDEX icon gave you this message:-

   "Neither MULTIVIEW nor AMIGAGUIDE have been found in your
    system's path."

Then this could mean one of the following:-

- You do not have either MULTIVIEW or AMIGAGUIDE.

  If this is the case, you CANNOT use ARexx for Beginners!!

- You DO have MULTIVIEW or AMIGAGUIDE but they are stored
  in a directory that has not been included in the path.

  In this case, you should take the action detailed below.

If you have Workbench 1.3 or earlier, then you will not
have had MULTIVIEW or AMIGAGUIDE supplied with your system.

With WB2.0 and later, it is normal for AMIGAGUIDE or MULTIVIEW
to be stored in the UTILITIES directory of the disk from
which you boot. This is called "Sys:Utilities".

(Note - "Sys:" is the name that is automatically given to the
disk from which you boot up.)

It is STRONGLY recommended that you copy it to the Sys:Utilities
drawer if it is not already there.

You should then check your "Startup-Sequence" file for a line
that looks something like this:-

  PATH Ram: C: Sys:Utilities ...... (more dir names) ADD

If it does NOT have the directory:-

  Sys:Utilities

in this line then you should add it. Make sure that you
leave a space between each of the directory names and don't
delete any names already there!

If, for some obscure reason, you want to leave
MULTIVIEW or AMIGAGUIDE in another directory, then add that
directory's name to the PATH command. For example, if
it is in the directory:-

  Sys:Xyz

then you should amend the PATH command line to read:-

  PATH Ram: C: Sys:Utilities Sys:Xyz .... (more dir names) ADD

(Make sure you don't chop out any of the directory names!!

NOW RETRY DOUBLE CLICKING ON THE INDEX ICON
