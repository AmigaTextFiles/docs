There are 4 types of operators used in ARexx. These types, and the
articles in which they are discussed, are as follows:-
@{JCENTER}
@{" ARITHMETIC    - Article 09 " LINK "ARB:Articles_01-10/09.Arithmetic_Operators/MAIN"}
@{" COMPARISON    - Article 11 " LINK "ARB:Articles_11-20/11.Comparison_Operators/MAIN"}
@{" LOGICAL       - Article 13 " LINK "ARB:Articles_11-20/13.Logical_Operators/MAIN"}
@{" CONCATENATION - Article 15 " LINK "ARB:Articles_11-20/15.Strings_More/Concatenation"}
@{JLEFT}
Following is a list of all these operators together with their priority
numbers.

@{"Priorities" LINK "ARB:Articles_01-10/09.Arithmetic_Operators/Priorities"} determine which operator will be acted upon first if there is
more than one operator in an expression. If there are two or more operators
with the same priority then they will be evaluated left to right.

Note that concatenation operators do not have priorities.

     Logical         8      ~       NOT - negates what follows

     Arithmetic      8      +       Positive Prefix
     Arithmetic      8      -       Negative Prefix
     Arithmetic      7      **      Exponentiation

     Arithmetic      6      /       Division
     Arithmetic      6      %       Integer Division
     Arithmetic      6      //      Remainder
     Arithmetic      5      +       Addition
     Arithmetic      5      -       Subtraction

     Comparison      3      =       Equality
     Comparison      3      ~=      Inequality
