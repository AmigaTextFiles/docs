APPENDIX A - THE TABLE OF ERRORS

BY FRANK BUNTON@{UB}@{UU}

@{" COPYRIGHT © FRANK P. BUNTON 1995-1998 " LINK "ARB:Misc/Read_Me_First!!/Copyright"}
@{JLEFT}

The @{B}Error Texts@{UB} shown below for each error number are those that I have
found to be given by @{"ERRORTEXT(Number)" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_41-50/46.Error_Tracing-1/Main"999} with my version of ARexx (v1.15).
At times they vary from the text shown in my two (different) ARexx manuals.

Under each error number heading I have shown:-

- The @{"Error Severity Number" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_41-50/46.Error_Tracing-1/Severity"}.

- The @{"Point Of Error Detection" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_41-50/46.Error_Tracing-1/Point"} for each error number.

- Whether the error can be trapped by @{"SIGNAL ON SYNTAX" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_31-40/33.Signalling/Syntax"}

- Note that there is only one error (@{"Error 2 - Execution Halted" LINK "2"}) that can
  be trapped by @{"SIGNAL ON HALT" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_31-40/33.Signalling/Halt"},

Error 1 Program Not Found@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

@{B}Severity@{UB} - 5

@{B}Detection at Stage 1@{UB} - External Interface Before Program Execution

@{B}Trapping By SIGNAL ON SYNTAX@{UB} - No

@{B}Comments@{UB}:-

- "Program Name" used may not exist, or it could be misspelled, or the
  @{"path" LINK "ARB:Misc/Glossary/Path"} to the program was wrongly given.

- "Program Name" used may have been for a file that was not recognised as
  an ARexx program because it did not start with a @{"comment" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_01-10/02.Program_Elements/Comments"} surrounded
  by /* and */

- Note that, if a non ARexx program @{B}does@{UB} start with a comment,
  then there may not be any error message at all! ARexx will try to
  interpret every line as either an ARexx instruction or a command line
  to be sent to an external host. If there is no external host then a
  command line is ignored. However, it is also possible that you may get
  an error such as @{"Error 5 - Unmatched quote" LINK "5"} or @{"Error 8 - Unrecognised token" LINK "8"}.

Error 3 Insufficient Memory@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
@{B}Severity@{UB} - 20

@{B}Detection at Stage 3@{UB} - During Program Execution

@{B}Trapping By SIGNAL ON SYNTAX@{UB} - Not usually

@{B}Comments@{UB}:-

- Not enough memory for an operation such as parsing, execution, etc.

- Use of a string or symbol value greater than about 63995 characters
  (see @{"Error 9" LINK "9"}).

- Not enough free memory when requesting allocation with @{"GETSPACE()" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_41-50/41.Memory_Handling/GETSPACE()"} or
  @{"ALLOCMEM()" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_41-50/41.Memory_Handling/ALLOCMEM()"}.

- This error need not result from lack of the Amiga's system memory.
  It can occur when the ARexx program runs out of the memory that has been
  allocated as its @{"internal pool" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_41-50/41.Memory_Handling/General"} of memory.

- If there is insufficient Amiga system memory to run the ARexx program
  then AmigaDOS will give its own error message regarding lack of memory.

Error 4@{UU}

This number does not give any text with ERRORTEXT()@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
This is shown in the manuals as "Invalid Character" meaning a
@{"non standard ASCII" LINK "ARB:Appendices/App-C_ASCII_CODES/NonStandard"} character was found that was not within quotes.

Use of ERRORTEXT(4) in my version of ARexx gives a null string and
non-ASCII characters give @{"Error 8" LINK "8"}.

@{B}Comments@{UB}:-

- An opening quote (" or ') has been found without a matching closing
  quote. All @{"quotes" LINK "ARB:Misc/Glossary/Strings"15} must be matched in pairs and types of quotes (" and ')
  must not be mixed in the same quotation.

Error 7@{UU}

This number does not give any text with ERRORTEXT()@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
This is shown in the manuals as "Clause Too Long" meaning that the clause
was longer than the space in the internal buffer.

Use of ERRORTEXT(7) in my version of ARexx gives a null string and this
fault gives @{"Error 3" LINK "3"}.

@{B}Detection at Stage 2@{UB} - During Initial Scan

@{B}Trapping By SIGNAL ON SYNTAX@{UB} - No

The manuals show this as "Invalid Token" but it now includes what was once
called @{"Error 4 - Invalid Character" LINK "4"} and has been given the description
"Unrecognised Token"

@{B}Comments@{UB}:-

- @{"Non-ASCII codes" LINK "ARB:Appendices/App-C_ASCII_Codes/NonStandard"} have been found that are not in quotes.
  Non-ASCII codes, (128 and higher) are generally considered to be outside
  the range of @{"standard ASCII" LINK "ARB:Appendices/App-C_ASCII_Codes/Main"14} codes, i.e. the printable characters (32-127)
  and non-printable codes (0-31).
  Use @{"hexadecimal string" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_11-20/15.Strings_More/HexDec"} definition as in 'AB'x for Non-ASCII codes.

- A token has been found that does not fit any known category.

- A clause is found that cannot be classified.

@{B}Trapping By SIGNAL ON SYNTAX@{UB} - Yes

Error number 9 is described by the manuals as "Symbol Or String too long"
but ERRORTEXT(9) gives "Symbol or String >65535 characters".

However, if I use a string of length greater than about 63995 characters I
get @{"Error 3 - Insufficient memory" LINK "3".

  y = 4+5
  x = (3* y/7)

@{B}Severity@{UB} - 10

@{B}Detection at Stage 3@{UB} - During Program Execution

@{B}Trapping By SIGNAL ON SYNTAX@{UB} - Yes

@{B}Comments@{UB}:-

- This error number results from the use of invalid expressions such as a
  string when a numeric is expected or vice versa or an expression holding
  a numeric value outside an allowable range. This is most likely to
  occur when a symbol has been given a value elsewhere then the symbol is
  used in place of "Expression" after an instruction.

- It can be caused by things such as:-

  - A number outside allowable numeric value for @{"NUMERIC" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_31-40/31.Numbers_More/Numeric"} instruction.

  - The use of a non numeric value for a symbol in a @{"DO" LINK "ARB:ARTICLES_01-10/10.Do-End_Loops-1/Do"} instruction, e.g.:-

    Count = 'Test'
    DO x = 1 TO Count
