Please note, that not every point may be applicable for your setup. But I collected problems from the net and own experiences. If you play on high risc and loose, than that's not my problem. You've been warned! If you read about probelems with the ZIP and one of your components, you better try to borrow a drive first and test it before spending money on it!

IOMEGAs ZIP-Drive - some sort of floppy disk that can store 100MB of data - certainly was the most surprising hardware of 1995. The shortage of the drive and the difficulties in getting one of these devices proofed it.

Especially the low price made the choice for the ZIP a lot easier, since convetional, harddisk-technology based removeables are not that cheap. (Okay, Syquest almost immediatly hit back with the EZ135...)

The ZIP drive comes with drivers for Macintosh, DOS/Windows and Windows95, but as we know it, the Amiga does not need any drivers for harddisks and floppies. So you can connected it simply to the SCSI bus and there you go.

But since thre are lots of other questions regarding the ZIP and the Amiga I decided to publish this FAQ. It is not intended to replace the ZIP FAQ and it only deaös with items regarding the Amiga.

Look out for my other FAQs on the Aminet:

	@{" Amiga and CD-ROM drives FAQ " link CDROMFAQ.guide/main}

And now, have fun...

@{u}@{b}What's the ZIP drive:@{uu}@{ub}

The @{" ZIP drive " link ZIP.iff/main} is a new revolutionairy storage device from IOMEGA. It stores 100MB (95MB formatted) on a single disk. (25MB [24MB formatted] are announced by not available at this time ) This disk is about the same size a normal 3.5" floppy disk and twice as hight. The technologiy used for the disk is floppy disk based rather than the Bernoulli line of removeables or the harddisk-based SyQuest technology. (Though specifications say, that the read/write-head does not touch the surface like on floppy disks)

The @{b}external@{ub} drive comes in a dark blue plastic housing with a nice Mac-like design. It has a see-through insert on the top so one can see the label of the inserted disk, On the right there are two LEDs: Power and InUse and a button to eject the disk, just like a cd-rom or normal floppy disks on the Mac. On tha back are two D-Sub 25 SCSI-I connectors, one for ZIP <-> computer and one for other <-> ZIP cables. In the SCSI version of the drive are two switches located between those connectors, one for the termination (if the ZIP is the last device within the SCSI chan) and one for the ID seletion between ID% and ID6). A tiny, little hole serves as emergency eject like found on CD-ROM drives. The device can lay flatt or stand on its side, so it will fit nicely to your computer.

The external power-supply will give a current of 5V/1A (at least in germany I found a 2Amps version, but since I saw a lot of 1Amps power supplies, I guess the ZIP does not need the extra power) and comes in several local variations, adapted to the local power net. While the geraman power supply is very light and small, for US residents it is better to get hold of an intl. power supply bacsue its lighter and smaller. A backdraw is the missing power On/Off switch, but the drive can remain on without any hesitations. To reset it, if needed, just pull the power supply, or you may connect all of you equipment to a switschable power cord.

The @{b}internal@{ub} drive, called SCSI insider, also comes in the dark blue housing - okay this is not very suitable for white or black PC-towers - for a 5.25" drive bay. It has a standard 50pin SCSI connector and a normal 3.5" power connector.

The external drive is made totally from plastik and therefore is not heavy. The external is designed for easy transport and will survive minor drops without breaking.

For the external device interface you can choose between a SCSI-2 interface or a parallel interface, the internal only comes as SCSI. The SCSI version works on all computers that has a SCSI adapter. A 50cm D-Sub25 to D-Sub 25 premium cable is included, other devices can be daisy chained to the second D-Sub25 SCSI port.

The external parallel version is designed for PC only. It will work with normal and enhanced ports, but on normal ports you will have a significatly performance loss (<375KB/s with enhanced ports against >900KB/s with the SCSI interface). The parallel version will not fit to the amiga parallel port due to hardware restrictions.

@{u}@{b}Parallel interface:@{uu}@{ub}

Let me simply put it this way: @{b}@{u}There is no posibility to connect the parallel version of the ZIP drive to an Amiga.@{ub}@{uu}

The PC parallel port has another layout as the Amiga parallel port and both ports are only compatible if they work as printer ports.

Used for bi-directional I/O, the amiga is missing one programmable line (though he has lots of others :-). All attempts to programm a  software driver or build some hardware adaptor failed. Not only for the zip drive but for a lot of other nice PC parallel port hardware.

@{u}SCSI@{uu}
The SCSI version of the ZIP drive implements a standard SCSI-2 interface that conforms to ISO=0, ECMA=0, ANSI=2 and does not support synchronous transfers (though it tolerates them) nor reseltion (make sure this feature is switched of at your controller!).

Problems may(!) occur on some controllers that do not support LUNs (the Fastlane Z3 does not!) correcly. (I have really no idea why the ZIP needs a LUN, sorry). So check LUN support before you buy the drive.

You may connect the drive to every Amiga SCSI controller with an external D-Sub 25 (SCSI-1 or Apple-style) connector. For a SCSI-2 style HD D-Sub 50 you need an adaptor or special cable.

The drive has a build in terminator that can be used if the drive is the last one on the chain. SCSI IDs range only from 5 to 6, also selectable via a backside switch. If ID 5 or ID 6 is already used, you must change the other device to free the ID. This is because the drive is primarily targeted for the Macintosh and they have rarely devices on these IDs.

Problems may(!) occur on some controllers that do not support LUNs (the Fastlane Z3 does not!) correcly. (I have really no idea why the ZIP needs a LUN, sorry). So check LUN support before you buy the drive.

The drive tollerates synchronous transfers, but reselection must be disabled.

Working (i.e. no mayor problems reported) controllers are:

@{u}@{b}A3000: A3091@{ub}@{uu}

@{b}·@{ub} I recommend to replace the originally old Western Digital WD 00-04 PROTO controller with the newer, fixed one 00-08.

@{b}·@{ub} Also you should check if pin 25 of the external SCSI connector has +5V, otherwise you suffer from the wrong-way diode. This part was put in the wrong way and  so can not terminate the SCSI chain correctly.

@{b}·@{ub} I savere cases you should @{b}not@{ub} terminate the drive! I experienced lots of SCSI bus lockups when my drive was terminated, switching of the termination (by accident) solved this problem.

@{b}·@{ub} On A3000 with V36 bootroms the well known problem of the delayed boot exists also for the ZIP drive. Simply put a disk in the drive, and the A3000 will boot up quickly.

@{b}·@{ub} If there was no disk in the drive during startup, the drive is also unknown to the DOS. Use SCSIMounter or similar to mount it for the first time. Afterwards you should have no trouble with diskchanges.

@endnode


@node scsiprep "Preping and formating"
@toc toc
@{u}@{b}Preping and formatting the disk@{uu}@{ub}
@{b}·@{ub} If you have connected the drive, inserted a disk (may be preformatted for IBM or Macintosh, doesn't matter) and powered up your amiga, you should see the device in your HD-Prep program like@{i}HDToolsBox@{ui}. (It's assumed your're using this one, if not your actual readouts may differ) The device is currently unknown to you Amiga filing system, it's not in the file drive specifications. So you should read out the @{" drive specifications " link ds}. Now your Amiga knows about the new drive.

@{b}·@{ub} You may then format the inserted disk with a simple format command. Several people reported, that low-level formatting gains some speed out of the disks, but I can not found any proof of it, accept in the Diskspeed 4.2-results. So if you like to low level format your disks, stay within the@{i}HDToolsBox@{ui}, select @{b}Low Level Format@{ub} and accept the destruction of all your data. Than wait for approx. 10 Minutes.

@{b}·@{ub} Newer ZIP-drives come with a Zip-Tools disk that is write protected. In this case you can use the low-level format to get rid of this protection. Another way is to use the ZIP-Tools for the Amiga or try to use them on a PC or Macintosh.

@{b}·@{ub} The AmigaOS has several problems dealing with removeables. (They may be fixed by the driver, but don't count on that!) If you have no disk inserted during startup, the drive simply is not there. You must than mount it using SCSIMounter or similar tools. Also it has difficulties dealing with different partitioned removeable media. If the next disk is partitioned different from the first, this could lead you into trouble. The least worst case is, that you have some ghost-icons and entries for the now removed partitions. The worst case is, that the OS keeps the partitioninformation and destroyes your current disk. The problem may(!) be solved, if you choose to write a real RDB to the ZIP-Disk, but it is a known probelme of several controllers not to work with RDBs written by other controllers. You may find yourself dealing with unreadable disks at your friends computer.

@{b}·@{ub} @{b}That's why I recommend, that you @{" partition your zip disks " link pertzip} all the same: one big partition.@{ub} I find the following most convinient: I format my disk al the same as one big partition of ~95MB. With a tool i read out a sample @{" ZIP mountlist " link zipmount} that i put than in @{i}DEVS:DOSDrivers/@{ui}. This garanties, that the drive is known to the system under all conditions even if no disk is inserted upon startup (which of course took unnaturaly long on an A3000 with V36 bootroms, of course)

@{b}·@{ub} Formatting new disks is done easy: If you like a low level format, do so within @{i}HDToolsBox@{ui} or your special program for this action. Then start the @{i}System/Format@{ui} program, if you do not see an icon on the workbench for your ZIP disk (if you low level formatted the disk, you should see one, otherwise if you simply inserted a Macintosh or IBM preformatted disk, you should not). The Format program shows you a list of all acceptible devices, there will be an entry for the ZIP disk also. Select it, choose your options and go for it. Formatting will take about 5-10 minutes. Though your device is ever named @{i}ZIP0@{ui} - or whatever you choose for a name within @{i}HDToolsBox@{ui} - you may rename the logical device name to whatever you like it to.

@{b}·@{ub} If your are using a SCSI uitility, that can read out the data from the drive - like @{" ProbeSCSI " link zipprobe} does you may be surprised about the high number of bad/remapped blocks. First of all, remember the disk is floppy disk technology based and you do have often bad blocks on floppies too. This is a normal behavior. Secondd, take a closer look and you will see, that a lot of the marked block constist of pure humbug values either 0 or in the millions were no physical block exists. So @{b}real@{ub} bad block counts from 20-40 are a normal value, don't get nervous.

@{u}@{b}Working with disks@{uu}@{ub} is easy:
After you have mounted and formatted your drives they simply work like big floppies. Via SCSI software control you can @{b}Write-protect,  Read/Write protect, Unprotect, Unprotect till the next ejection@{ub} and  of course @{b}Eject@{ub} the disk.

The supplied ZIP Tools for the other platforms will do that for you. On the Amiga there is one @{" software packages " link toolsamiga} that can perform this tasks: the ZIP Tools from Oregon Research. (Also included by HISOFT with their ZIP-drive/Squirrel SCSI package for the A1200)

@{u}@{b}Speed comparisons:@{uu}@{ub}

Determing the speed of a device is not so easy. A lot of people swear of DiskSpeed 4.2, but I thing DiskSpeed only tell you how it could be, not how it really is. Or do you know how large the buffers are your applications are using for disk-IO? And it stands in the contrary to the fact that more filesystem buffers (the buffers set in HDToolsbox) improve the speed of a device dramatically. I like more results that give you raw disk IO as found in SCSISpeed or SysInfo or comparisons for real file copy like Eckhard Ludwig did.

All modern disk storage systems are using some kind of ZoneBitRecording ZBR that stores more sectros on the piuter areas of the disk and less sectros on the inner areas. Reading more sectors in a single rotations means higher data throughput, reading less means lower throughput. That's what measured for the fastest/slowest zone. On dreives with only one Head the speed layout of these zone has it's lowest points not on the borders, but in the center of the graphic representation.

First I tested the ZIP with SysInfo (if you like it or not!): 932kb/s for the reformatted ZIP disk, 950KB/s for the low-level formatted ZIP disk.

The DiskSpeed tests were done on my A3000/25 using DiskSpeed 4.2 and SCSISpeed 4.2. I had two original "IBM compatibel" preformatted disks. The first was only reformatted, the second low-level formatted using HDToolsBox.

The results are rather surprising, as the device gained 300KB/s in read with a 256KB buffer, but dropped otherwise. The overall "feeling" of the device and the different ZIP disks did not change at all.

@{u}@{b}ZIP Tools for the Amiga:@{uu}@{ub}

IOMEGA does not provide any Amiga ZIP Tools to control the ZIP features such as: Write-protect, Read-/Write-protect, Unprotect, Unprotect until eject, Eject. But even if you have none of the below mentioned ZIP Tools packages, you can (re)format a protected disk - but you loose all data on it, of course.

Oregon Research produces some kind of ZIP tools package for the Amiga. HiSoft includes the Oregon Research ZIP Tools in a ZIP package that consist of a Squirrel PCMCIA A1200 SCSI-Controller, a SCSI ZIP drive and the ZIP Tools.

The OR Amiga ZIP tools come in two variants: a CLI program and a commodity. Both programs let you set all software controlled ZIP features.

Oliver Hitz (oliver.hitz@unifr.ch) has uploaded a smal CLI only version of the ZIP Tools for amiga to the aminet/disk/misc directory. It is not fency, but provides you with the basic functions and it's for free.

The Amiga is capable of emulating a range of other computers including their operating systems.

All 8Bit emulations like all old Commodore Co,mputers, Atari 8Bit, Oric etc. do not support SCSI and therefore ZIP drives are not accessible.

For Unix (Amix, NETBSD, Linux68k), Atari TOS and PC-Task there are currently no solutions for a connection of the ZIP drive. However the Amiga is capable of reading @{" IBM compatible " link zippc} i.e. FAT formatted ZIP disks.

This mountlist is for a single partition on a ZIP disk and reflects the format of the pre-formatted "IBM compatible" disks. Note that the device-name must end with "C" or "D" for CrossDOS to recognice it correctly.

On the Aminet there is a program called MountDOS.lha that is able to scan and mount a DOS formatted disk, even the ZIP-disks.

If you are not running one of the three Macintosh emulations @{" Shapeshifter " link zipss}, @{" Emplant " link zipemp} or @{" AMax " link zipamax} you can read Macintosh formattet disks with the help of the CrossMAC¹ or the AmiCDFS filesystem. Similar to the use of CrossDOS for DOS formatted disks you must setup a Mountlist for a special Macintosh ZIP device:

MACZIP0:
	Device		= <scsi.device>
	Unit		= <6>
	FileSystem	= L:CrossMacFileSystem²
	Flags		= 0
	Surfaces	= 1
	BlocksPerTrack	= 1
	SectorsPerBlock = 1
	SectorSize	= 512
	Mask		= 0x7ffffffe
	MaxTransfer	= 0x100000
	Reserved	= 0
	Interleave	= 0
	LowCyl		= 0
	HighCyl 	= 196607
	Buffers 	= 5
	BufMemType	= 0
	StackSize	= 2000
	Priority	= 10
	GlobVec 	= -1
	DosType 	= 0x4d414300

This mountlist is for a single partition on a ZIP disk and reflects the format of the pre-formatted "Macintosh compatible" disks.

¹CrossMAC is not part of the AmigaOS and must be purchased from your local dealer.
²Replace with L:AmiCDFS if oyu do not use CrossMac. AmiCDFS is on Aminet and supports Macintosh HDs, Floppies and ZIPs since version 2.10

@node zipss "ShapeShifter"

@prev zipmac
@{u}@{b}ShapeShifter:@{uu}@{ub}

ShapeShifter fully supports the ZIP drive starting with version 3.3. In earlier versions you can see two ZIP disk icons on the finders desktop. Also you may have to activate "Direct Transfers" (with all the backdraws this may have) to eneable the ZIP as a removeable. Otherwise it may be a fixed harddisk and is not changeable.

The ZIP Install disk for the initial start comes on a Macintosh 800K DD disk. This disk is not readable by the Amiga.

A workaround for this problem is to mount the ZIP Tools disk via @{" CrossMAC " link zipmac} on the Amiga and copy the needed files - at least the IOMEGA driver Init - to your Macintosh device disk. Another way is to mount the ZIP Tools disk with CrossDOS and the use the Macintosh-Partitionfile as a filedisk.

All tools on the ZIP Tools disk work flawlessly under MacOS and the Shapeshifter. But I experienced several problems with the DiskDup program for dublicating ZIP disks. Disk changes were not correctly notified. The original IOMEGA driver for the ZIP also should have several problems with thrid-party harddiskdrivers like @{i}d2 Driver@{ui} or @{i}ProDriveStep@{ui}

@node zipemp "Emplant"

@{u}@{b}Emplant:@{uu}@{ub}

Sorry, but I do not have any information if the Emplant fully supports the ZIP and the ZIP tools. Since Emplant has no problems with SyQuest removeable media it is to assume it will support the ZIP.

Sorry, i do not have any information if the rather old AMax emulator will supports the ZIP.
