What is the IFAQ?<P>A. Irritating questions are those that are asked over and over. Theycan be answered a thousand times, and the next day somebody will ask again.While asking questions is a time-proven way to gather information, manylong-time Usenet users get sick of answering the same old thing. So here'sthis FAQ. Odds are pretty good that you'll get this instead of a custom-written answer; don't take this personally. In fact, the next time yousee somebody ask that question, you can do the same thing. (Please realizethat in many cases, I have intentionally left out some detail to avoidclouding the issues.)<BR> <P>Q. I feel so guilty. What can I do to atone for having asked some ofthese irritating questions myself?<P>A. When someone else asks, help answer them. Eventually the cripplingguilt will fade. Probably.<BR> <P>Q. You seem to write a lot of these FAQ things. Why?<P>A. Because so often a question is asked, and never gets answered, orworse, gets a wrong answer. That really bugs me. It's a big waste of time;for instance, look at how much time has been wasted in discussions of MaxTransfer,and even now it's still widely misunderstood.<P>It would be nice if I could do this type of technical writing and getpaid for it. Everyone is welcome to contact me regarding that type of thing.<H4><HR WIDTH="100%"></H4><H4>Contents</H4><UL><LI><A HREF="#ReallyIrritating">Really Irritating Questions</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Aminet">Aminet</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Emulation">Emulation</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#DisksAndStorage">Disks And Storage</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Memory">Memory</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Expansion">Expansion</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Monitors">Monitors</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Networking">Networking</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</A></LI><LI><A HREF="#OtherFaqs">Other FAQs That Answer Irritating Questions</A></LI></UL><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="ReallyIrritating"></A><I>Really</I> Irritating Questions</H4>Q. Could my MaxTransfer rate be too high? What should it be?<P>A. My initial reaction to questions about MaxTransfer is usually a shoutof "Bite me! Arrrrrggggh!" This usually frightens off everyone except thereally serious. MaxTransfer has almost nothing to do with transfer rates.It sets the Maximum Transfer <I>SIZE</I>, and is needed to deal with manyIDE drives that are built assuming that they'll be used only in rock-stupidPC hardware. If a transfer larger than this size (usually 128K) is requested,the drive will garble some data. Setting MaxTransfer to 0x1FE00 for eachpartition will force large transfers to be broken into 128K sections, avoidingthe IDE bug. Very old drives might need a setting of 0xFE00. MaxTransferis almost never an issue with SCSI drives, and you can usually set it toarbitrarily large values (HDToolBox defaults to 0x7FFFFFFF). For more detailson MaxTransfer, see the <A HREF="../A1200HardFAQ.txt">A1200 Hardware FAQ</A>.<BR> <P>Q. What should I do to people who keep associating MaxTransfer withspeed?<P>A. Make up bizarre explanations. See if you can get them to try everyvalue from 0 to 256K in increments of four bytes. Or you can just havethem try DiskSpeed with various values, but that's not nearly as much fun.<BR> <P>Q. Will PC parallel-port devices work on the Amiga?<P>A. No. Except for printers, PC parallel-port devices like tape drives,Ethernet adapters, digitizers, and storage devices (the parallel versionof the Zip or EZ drive) are built for the quirks of the PC parallel port,and won't work on the Amiga. There are two problems: some of the lineson the Amiga parallel port are not software-controllable, and most of themanufacturers of PC parallel-port devices will not reveal details of howto program these devices. This is no great loss, since an adapter and softwarewould probably cost about the same as a low-end SCSI interface, and wouldoperate at only 30-50K per second.<P>If you want to share a Zip or EZ drive between an Amiga and a PC, getthe SCSI version of the drive and an inexpensive SCSI adapter for the PC(like the Zip "Zoom" or the Adaptec 1505, both about US$50).<BR> <P>Q. Jumper J213 on the A4000 motherboard looks like I can get 8M of ChipRAM. Does it work?<P>A. Yes, it does, but don't tell anybody. If it really worked, do youthink everybody would still be using 2M of Chip? I'm always tempted totell people to try it and report back if their machine blew up. No, itdoesn't work, it was there for future chipsets that never materialized.<BR> <P>Q. I have a Connor hard disk, and...<P>A. There is no such thing. There is a brand whose name is spelled "Conner;"perhaps that's what you mean.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Aminet"></A>Aminet</H4>Q. What is Aminet?<P>A. Aminet is a huge collection of Amiga software; in fact, it's thelargest collection of computer software for any type of computer. Anyonewith an Internet connection can use it, or it can be inexpensively obtainedon CD-ROM from <A HREF="http://www.ninemoons.com/">Cronus</A>.<BR> <P>Q. How do I use Aminet over the Internet?<P>A. Step 1: Find your closest Aminet mirror. Look in the list at <A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/change.html">http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/change.html</A>.<P>Step 2: Access this mirror site with a web browser or FTP software.<BR> <P>Q. How do I find files on Aminet?<P>A. Download the INDEX file or INDEX.Z (the compressed version--use util/pack/gzip124x2.lhaor the Unix compress program to decompress it). This is a complete listingof all the files, along with short descriptions.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Emulation"></A>Emulation</H4>Q. Is there an Amiga emulator that runs on PCs or Macs?<P>A. Yes. See <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/swmillar/whatuae.htm">http://members.aol.com/swmillar/whatuae.htm</A>.<BR> <P>Q. What about that other one, you know, the one that shows the Kickstarthand and then locks up?<P>A. It's a fake. It doesn't work and never has. <A HREF="MagicBeans.html"><IMG SRC="bean.gif" ALT="Bean" HSPACE=10 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=46 ALIGN=TEXTTOP></A><BR> <P>Q. Can the Amiga emulate PCs or Macs?<P>A. Yes, and a host of other machines. See the misc/emu directory ofAminet and the Usenet newsgroup <A HREF="news:comp.sys.amiga.emulations">comp.sys.amiga.emulations</A>for more information on the numerous commercial, shareware, and publicdomain emulator packages.<BR> <BR><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="DisksAndStorage"></A>Disks And Storage</H4>Q. Can PCs or Macs read and write Amiga floppy disks?<P>A. Short answer: Not for free. Get over it.<P>Longer answer: While the Amiga does use PC-type floppy drives, it usesthe custom Amiga chips to control them, and writes entire tracks at a time<I>with no sector gaps</I>. This is beyond the capability of the standardPC floppy controller. There is a special floppy controller that makes thispossible; see: <A HREF="http://www.rat.de/apd/catweasl.htm">http://www.rat.de/apd/catweasl.htm</A>.<BR> <P>Q. Can Amigas read and write MS-DOS floppy and hard disks?<P>A. Yes, no problem. Later versions of the Amiga operating system camewith CrossDOS, which does just that. There are also some utilities of thistype on Aminet. (Slight catch: many Amigas have only double-density floppydrives; on these machines, you can only use 720K MS-DOS disks.)<BR> <P>Q. Can Amigas read and write Macintosh floppy and hard disks?<P>A. Yes, within hardware limits: most Amigas have only double-densityfloppy drives, and they are incompatible with the older multi-speed Apple800K drives, as is pretty much everything else. Desktop A4000s came withhigh-density drives, which can read and write Mac high-density disks. Seemisc/emu/CrossMAC_Demo.lha on Aminet.<BR> <P>Q. Will high-density diskettes work when formatted to double-density?<P>A. Not reliably. It'll often seem to work, then fail at the worst possiblemoment.<BR> <P>Q. My Amiga has a double-density 880K floppy. If I replace it with aregular high-density PC floppy drive, will I be able to use high-densitydisks?<P>A. No. Amiga high-density floppy drives are modified versions of thoseused in the PCs. See hard/hacks on Aminet for experimental projects onmodifying standard drives.<BR> <P>Q. Is there a way to attach and use unmodified high-density PC floppydrives with the Amiga?<P>A. Yes: <A HREF="http://www.rat.de/apd/catweasl.htm">http://www.rat.de/apd/catweasl.htm</A>.<BR> <P>Q. Do the Iomega Zip and Jaz drives and Syquest EZ and SyJet driveswork on the Amiga?<P>A. The SCSI and IDE versions, yes. There are both commercial and PDutilities for using the custom features of the Zip, and you may need touse a PC or Mac running the Jaz tools to disable the verify option of thatdrive. Otherwise, treat these just like hard disks.<BR> <P>Q. Can I read MS-DOS-formatted Zip, Jaz, and EZ disks on the Amiga?<P>A. Yes. See the Aminet files disk/misc/ZIPMount_12.lha and disk/misc/MountDos100.lha.<BR> <P>Q. Can I use 3.5-inch hard drives in the A1200?<P>A. Yes, although you might have to slightly modify the internal shieldand heavily modify the IDE cable. And you might very well need to replacethe power supply to cope with the drive's higher power needs. And set theMaxTransfer value to 0x1FE00 for all partitions. And realize that a 3.5-inchdrive usually generates more heat than the 2.5-inch drives, so that mightcause operating problems. And larger drives draw more power, which theA1200 might have a hard time supplying through the standard power connector;a direct power cable from the power supply to the drive is often needed.Other than that, it's pretty simple.<BR> <P>Q. Will EIDE drives work in the A1200 or A4000?<P>A. Yes. Plug it in, set MaxTransfer to 0x1FE00 for all partitions, andgo. See the <A HREF="../A1200HardFAQ.txt">A1200 Hardware FAQ</A> for informationon slow spin-up and disabling reset of these drives.<BR> <P>Q. Will EIDE (ATAPI) CD-ROM drives work in the A1200 or A4000?<P>A. Yes, with the proper software and maybe a cable. Point your browserto <A HREF="http://www.asimware.com/">Asimware</A> or search for "atapi"in the disk/cdrom directory of Aminet.<BR> <P>Q. How big can a partition be? How about a whole drive?<BR>A. Safe limits: 2G per partition (or 4G, but there's a catch), 4G perdrive. FFS can use partitions up to 4G in size, but some utilities willshow partition sizes larger than 2G as negative values. If you're lucky,that's the only problem you'll have. If you must, there are some otheroptions:<P>Beta FFS filesystem from Amiga International: <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/files/index.html">http://www.amiga.de/files/index.html</A>.<BR>giga.device: (device driver) disk/misc/giga171.lha on Aminet.<BR>Guru-ROM: (replacement ROM for GVP and A2091 controllers) Support fordrives larger than 4G. Available from <A HREF="http://www.ninemoons.com/">Cronus</A>.<BR> <P>Q. Will low-level formatting ruin my hard drive?<P>A. Maybe, but probably not. On a few old IDE drives, it might. Mostrecent IDE drives simply ignore the low-level format command and pretendthey did it. For SCSI, you should generally not need to low-level formatthe drive (and some SCSI drives ignore the command, too). If you must doa low-level format, make sure there are no power interruptions and thatyou give it adequate time to finish. A full low-level format can take quitea while, half an hour or more for large or slow drives.<BR> <P>Q. I interrupted a low-level format on a hard drive before it completed.Now the drive won't work. What happened?<P>A. Most SCSI drives will go into a "stupid" mode if a low-level formatis interrupted. In this mode, the drive knows there isn't a complete format,and refuses to do anything *except* a low-level format. The cure is todo a full low-level format and let it complete. Some people find that theonly way to do this is with a PC SCSI system. IDE drives generally don'thave this problem, since most now ignore the low-level format command.<BR> <P>Q. My friend and I have the same hard disk, but our parameters (blocksper track and number of heads and such) are wildly different. Both machineswork, though. Why?<P>A. SCSI and IDE drives both work by block number. The computer requestsa read or write to a certain block number, and the drive handles the rest.As long as the settings (heads*blockspertrack*cylinders) don't go overthe total number of blocks available, it'll work. The heads, blockspertrack,and cylinders parameters are really mostly vestigial (like your appendix),and may someday be replaced with a "total blocks" value (unlike your appendix).<BR> <P>Q. How do I use a tape drive from the Amiga?<P>A. There's commercial and shareware software (look in the Aminet biz/demodirectory). Then there's BTNtape, a PD tape device handler (on Aminet,disk/bakup/BTNtape30.lha). With this and most of the Amiga variants ofthe Unix "tar" program (in the util/arc directory of Aminet), you can readand write tapes that are interchangeable with other systems.<P>Tar for MS-DOS: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mcs.com:/mcsnet.users/les/dos-gnutar/">ftp://ftp.mcs.com:/mcsnet.users/les/dos-gnutar/</A><BR>Tar for Mac: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.amug.org/pub/amug/bbs-in-a-box/files/util/s/suntar-2.1.sit.hqx">ftp://ftp.amug.org/pub/amug/bbs-in-a-box/files/util/s/suntar-2.1.sit.hqx</A><BR> <P>Q. Will a tape drive made to connect to a PC's floppy or IDE cableswork on the Amiga?<P>A. No, unless there's a special driver via the Catweasel controller.See: <A HREF="http://www.rat.de/apd/catweasl.htm">http://www.rat.de/apd/catweasl.htm</A>.<BR> <P>Q. Why does the A2091 SCSI controller run so slowly in the A3000 orA4000?<P>A. Because the A2091 can't DMA to 32-bit RAM. The Guru ROM for the A2091can help; also see the A4000 Hardware Guide section on the A2091 for moredetails on the problem (a pointer to the Guide is at the end of this document),or various programs in the disk/misc and hard/drivr directories of Aminet.<BR> <P>Q. Does the A3000's SCSI interface support "Fast SCSI"?<P>A. [by Ralph Babel] No, but upgrading it to do so is *extremely* simple:First, replace the standard WD33C93A SCSI chip by a WD33C93*B*. Be sureto provide the appropriate input clock on pin 7 (DIP) as described in section3.1.16 of the WD33C93B data sheet. Finally, rewrite Commodore's scsi.devicedriver to select the proper clock divisor (see section 3.1.3); take thenew input clock into account when dealing with incoming and outgoing SDTRmessages, and set the WD's FSS bit accordingly. The driver should replacethe one in ROM.<A HREF="MagicBeans.html"><IMG SRC="bean.gif" ALT="Bean" HSPACE=10 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=46 ALIGN=TEXTTOP></A><BR> <P>Q. Hey! There's a "scsi.device" loaded on my A4000, but I thought Ionly had IDE drives. Do I have a SCSI interface, too?<P>A. No. The desktop A4000 only has an IDE interface built in, but, ina stunningly confusing move, the software driver for it is called "scsi.device".Clever, huh? (The A4000T does have a SCSI interface built in, but the softwarenames are still screwed up.)<BR> <P>Q. What SCSI controllers are available for the A4000?<P>A. The A4091 and Fastlane are both Zorro-3 Fast SCSI-2 controllers,but can be difficult to find. Fast SCSI-2 controllers are available foraccelerators, either built-in (Warp Engine) or optional (Cyberstorm). Ifthe slower performance of plain SCSI-2 is acceptable, most Zorro-2 boardswork in the A4000, although some are quite slow; of the Zorro-2 boards,the most popular are the Oktagon and DKB Rapidfire.<BR> <P>Q. After installing a removable media device (CD-ROM, Zip drive, orsuch), the Amiga's hard disk light flashes every few seconds. What's happening?<P>A. The system is polling the removable media device so it can detectwhen a disk has been changed. This is normal.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Memory"></A>Memory</H4>Q. Is there an adapter to use SIMMs for the motherboard memory in an A3000?<P>A. Yes. See http://users.informatik.fh-hamburg.de/~plewka_j for one,or email 75507.317@compuserve.com for another.<BR> <P>Q. Does the Amiga use special SIMMs? Can they use SIMMs with parity?<P>A. Amigas that use standard 72-pin SIMMS (not all of them do) will workwith either 32-bit (without parity) or 36-bit (with parity).<BR> <P>Q. Can I use an 8M SIMM on the motherboard of an A4000?<P>A. Yes, usually:<UL><LI>Some A4000s (possibly older revisions) may only recognize 4M of an 8M SIMM.</LI><LI>The low-profile sockets used in the desktop A4000 are not made to takedouble-sided SIMMs, and most 8M SIMMs are double-sided. They'll still makecontact, but some other means of holding them in place must be found.</LI><LI>The motherboard Fast RAM limit is still 16M, so at most you can only usetwo 8M SIMMs, and they must be in sockets 1 and 3.</LI></UL>Q. Can I use a 16M SIMM on the motherboard of an A4000?<P>A. Possibly. It may depend on the revision of the motherboard.<BR> <P>Q. Can EDO SIMMs be used in an Amiga?<P>A. In some of them, yes. It depends on the particular model:<P>All DKB boards (reported by DKB)<BR>The A4000 motherboard<BR>The Warp Engine<BR>Blizzard 1230 and 1260<P>Still, try before you buy for any RAM expansions. Unless the RAM expansionhas specific provisions to take advantage of EDO SIMMs, they won't runany faster than normal SIMMs.<BR> <BR><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Expansion"></A>Expansion</H4>Q. My A2000/A3000/A4000 has PC ISA slots. Can I use PC cards in there?<P>A. Only if you have some sort of bridge board. This can be either aPC hardware emulator, or a special purpose board made just to allow theuse of PC cards. See <A HREF="http://www.infinet.com/~erd/GG2">http://www.infinet.com/~erd/GG2</A>for one possibility.<BR> <P>Q. Can the 8-bit ISA slots in an A2000 be extended to 16-bit AT-styleby simply soldering in the extra connector?<P>A. Yes.<BR> <P>Q. If I add a math coprocessor (FPU), will my machine run faster?<P>A. Only on floating-point math, and the operating system and most productivitysoftware doesn't use much (or any) floating-point math. The major use forFPUs is for ray-tracing graphics software.<BR> <P>Q. The A3640 processor board can be used in an A3000, right? How?<P>A. See <A HREF="http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/user/orknorr/a3640.html">http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/user/orknorr/a3640.html</A>.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Monitors"></A>Monitors</H4>Q. Will a CGA monitor work on an Amiga?<P>A. Yes...barely. It'll only display 16 colors, and probably only inNTSC. There are those of us who say that even a color composite monitoris better. Check the local pawn shops.<BR> <P>Q. Will an EGA monitor work on an Amiga?<P>A. If it does CGA mode and you can come up with the appropriate interfacecircuitry, it'll work as CGA. See the previous question for comments onusing CGA.<BR> <P>Q. Will the 1084 monitor work on a PC?<P>A. Only if you have a genuine CGA board in the PC (not a VGA board emulatingCGA), and are willing to build an appropriate adapter cable. It'll be mostlyuseless with modern PC software.<BR> <P>Q. Can I use a VGA monitor on the Amiga?<P>A. A multisync-type VGA monitor that syncs from 15 KHz and up will workwith all Amigas, but most recent monitors don't sync that low (standardNTSC VGA is 31.5 KHz). The A3000 has a built-in deinterlacer port thatwill work will all standard VGA monitors, and equivalent boards can beadded to the A500, A2000, and A4000.<P>Other options:<P>ECS and AGA machines (the A3000 and later A500s and A2000s) can alsodisplay doubled modes. These modes range in frequency from about 23 KHzup to about 29 KHz. The VGAOnly "monitor driver" will force these screenmodes to operate at even higher frequencies so that they can be used onsome pickier monitors. It's not really a driver; its only purpose is toraise the frequencies of the other drivers.<BR> <P>Q. What kind of cable do I need to connect a VGA or multisync monitorto the Amiga DB23 video connector?<P>A. The good old silver DB23-to-HDD15 adapter that came with the A4000is available from many mail-order or local dealers, or see the Aminet filehard/hack/ami2vga.lha, or see the <A HREF="../a4000hard/connvga.html">ConnectingVGA Monitors</A> section of the <A HREF="../a4000hard/main.html">A4000Hardware Guide</A>.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Networking"></A>Networking</H4>Q. Can I network my Amiga with my PC over a serial cable?<P>A. Yes. See comm/misc/PC2Am308.lha on Aminet, and other files in thesame directory.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="Miscellaneous"></A>Miscellaneous</H4>Q. My somewhat older Amiga doesn't have AmigaOS 3.1. It seems kind of expensive--isit worth it?<P>A. Yes. Get it.<BR> <P>Q. Does a PC mouse work on the Amiga? Can I use an Amiga mouse on aPC?<P>A. Not directly, because the two are electrically different. See thehard/hack section of Aminet for ways to modify some PC mice for use onthe Amiga; also see hard/drivr/SerMouse221.lha which will let you use aPC serial mouse on the Amiga. Some commercial hardware adapters have beenproduced, too. Finally, if you need a new Amiga mouse, consider that theold A1000 mice will work with later Amigas, although you might need anextension cable or adapter due to the right-angle connector on the A1000mouse cable.<BR> <P>Q. Does a PC keyboard work on an Amiga?<P>A. Not directly, but adapters are available to connect them. See:<P>     <A HREF="http://www.nationalamiga.com/i-insert104.html">http://www.nationalamiga.com/i-insert104.html</A><BR>     <A HREF="http://www.paxtron.com">http://www.paxtron.com</A><BR> <P>Q. I've heard of a software emulator called SoftAGA that provides AGAcompatibility for machines without the AGA chipset. Does it work?<P>A. It's a fake, a joke. You can't upgrade your hardware by changingsoftware, any more than you can grow taller just by concentrating on it.<A HREF="MagicBeans.html"><IMG SRC="bean.gif" ALT="Bean" HSPACE=10 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=46 ALIGN=TEXTTOP></A><BR> <P>Q. Will an external modem for a PC or Mac work with the Amiga?<P>A. Yes, with the appropriate cable. Be aware that some pins on the Amigaserial port supply power, and should not be hooked up. On the other hand,most modems don't connect anything to these pins, so it's usually not aproblem. The safest way to connect an external modem is to use a 9-wireserial cable (only pins 1-8 and 20 connected).<BR> <P>Q. My clock battery has fuzzy white crud on it, but it still keeps thetime. Does it need to be replaced?<P>A. Yes. Your battery is leaking, and the acid can eat into the motherboard.To do it right, you take out the motherboard and desolder the battery.It may be possible to clip off the battery leads from the top, withouttaking out the motherboard. For a replacement, you can use a standard PC-type3.6v nicad, a cordless phone nicad, or one of the high-capacity capacitors(1.0F) now being used for this kind of thing.<BR> <P>Q. The instructions for my new modem say that it can communicate withthe computer at 57600 bps or even faster, but the Prefs/Serial programonly goes up to 31250. How can I set this?<P>A. Terminal programs ignore the Prefs/Serial settings. Each terminalprogram has its own setting, perhaps under a Settings or Preferences menuor the equivalent. Set the speed there, and don't worry about the Prefs/Serialprogram (it is very rarely used, and usually only by those with serialprinters). The Amiga's serial hardware is not particularly fast, and youmight have data corruption problems operating the serial port at high speeds;there are replacement serial.device programs on Aminet in the comm/miscdirectory which attempt to compensate for this.<P><HR WIDTH="100%"><H4><A NAME="OtherFaqs"></A>Other FAQs That Help Answer Irritating Questions</H4><A HREF="../A1200HardFAQ.txt">A1200 Hardware FAQ</A><BR><A HREF="../a4000hardware/main.html">A4000 Hardware Guide</A><BR><A HREF="http://eksl-www.cs.umass.edu/~atkin/amiga/books.faq.html">AmigaBooks FAQ</A><BR>Amiga FAQ: docs/misc/AmigaFAQ.lha on Aminet.<BR>CDROM FAQ: docs/help/CDROM35.lha on Aminet.<BR><A HREF="http://faq.amiga.org/anetfaq/main.html">Networking FAQ</A><BR><A HREF="/SCSI/SCSIExamples.html">SCSI Examples</A><BR>Zip Drive FAQ: docs/help/AmigaZipFAQ12.lha on Aminet.</BODY></HTML>
