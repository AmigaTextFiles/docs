window or a window and all its icons so that next time the window is opened the 
icons appear in their new position.

1.2.7 Show 

  Includes two sub-menus: Only icons or All files. Displays all files which have 
icons and hides the remaining files or displays all files and hidden files are 
given default icon pictures.

@NODE IconMenu "Icon Menu"

@{u}1.3 Icon Menu@{uu}


1.3.1 Open (O)

     This is used on a selected icon. Instead of double clicking on
an icon to show contents of a disk or drawer or run a program you
can select an icon with the pointer and Select Open to display or
run it.

1.3.2 Copy (C)

     This open allows you to duplicate files and disks. To copy a file 
select the icon and then select Copy. Another icon will appear
saying Copy_of_file or whatever, you can then move that file elsewhere
or Rename it.

1.3.3 Rename (R)

     This option allows you to change the name of a disk, a drawer or
a file. Select the disk, drawer or file icon to rename, select rename,
and then type in the new name in the given requester.

1.3.4 Information (I)

     This option displays details of a given disk, drawer or file.
Workbench has 5 types of workbench icons: Disk, Drawer, Trashcan,
Project and Tool. A Trashcan is a special drawer for use with the
'Empty Trash' feature to delete files. A Project is a data file and
a Tool is a Program. Info will display the type, size, stack size,
default file, comment and protection flags of a file.

1.3.5 Snapshot (S)

   This savees the position of one or more icons to its new position.

1.3.6 Unsnapshot (U)

   This removes the position information of an icon and allows Workbench
to position the icon itself.

1.3.6 Leave out (L)

   Allows an icon to be placed on the desktop and may be snapshot into place.
Allows faster access to a program or drawer than via other disks and drawers.

1.3.6 Put Away (P)

   Returns left out icons back into their original location on disk.

1.3.7 Delete

     This is a delete function, to delete a file you would normally
drag and drop the file into the Trashcan drawer to empty later.
This option allows you to delete a file straight away. A requester
may appear to confirm deletion.

1.3.8 Format Disk

     This option formats a disk for use by the Amiga. It splits
the disk into the right number of tracks/sectors and creates an
empty root directory. It can also automatically create a Trashcan
drawer. To use, select the disk to format and select Initialise.

1.3.9 Empty Trash

     This option deletes all the files in a selected Trashcan drawer
of a disk. This feature is useful because you may want to delete a
file but you could change your mind and decide to keep it, all you
have to do is to drag the file out of the Trashcan back to its
original drawer or disk.

@NODE ToolMenu "Tool Menu"

@{u}1.4 Tools Menu@{uu}


1.4.1 Reset WB

  Resets Workbench, redraws the screen and re-reads mounted disks.

1.4.2 User items

You can also add your own favourite items to this menu via third party
programs such as <b>ToolManager, ToolsDaemon</b> and so on.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Mouse "The Mouse"

@{u}2. The Mouse@{uu}

     On the Amiga mouse there are two buttons. The Left Mouse Button
(LMB) and the Right Mouse Button (RMB). 

2.1 Using the Right Mouse Button

     To use the menus, press down the RMB and move the pointer to the
title bar at the top of the screen. Move the pointer over one of the
menu names and some menu items will appear. Now, still with the RMB
pressed, move the pointer down to the selected menu item and release
the RMB to select that item.

2.2 Using the Left Mouse Button

     This button is mainly used to select and move icons around and
click on gadgets (or buttons).

2.2.1 Clicking

    To select an icon move the pointer over the desired icon and then
click the LMB once. The icon will change to a reverse or an alternative
image to indicate it has been selected.

     When using gadgets such as those on windows (there are four gadgets
on a window: Close, Window-to-Front, Window-to-Back and Resize) move
the pointer over the desired gadget and click once to use that gadget.
The gadget will change briefly and also change the window.

2.2.2 Double-Clicking

     This is sometimes a tricky technique to use and requires a steady
hand. This method is used  to open disks, drawers and files or run
programs. To do this, move the pointer over the desired icon and in
quick succession (without moving the pointer) click on the LMB twice.
This should open the icon.

2.2.3 Dragging

    This technique allows you to move objects such as icons around the
screen or resizing windows. Select an icon with a single click, now keep
the LMB down and move the pointer, the icon will now be dragged with the
pointer. If you let go of the pointer the icon will be dropped into its 
new position. 

2.2.4 Multiple selection

    You can select more than one icon at a time. To do this, click on
the first icon, press the SHIFT key down (either one) and then click
on the second, third, fourth icons etc to select multiple icons
     You can also select a whole group of icons by pressing the LMB
at the top left of the icons and while keeping the LMB down moving the
power towards the bottom right. A expanding box will apear and the icons
in it will be selected.

@NODE TROUBLE "Trouble Shooting"

@{U}9. Trouble Shooting WB2@{uu}


9.1. I have Workbench 1.3, should I upgrade to Workbench 2 or Workbench 3.1?

 You should always upgrade to the latest version of Workbench as you have
better application support with the latest Workbench and it is now more difficult
to get hold of older Workbenchs. Workbench 2 was released in <b>1991</b>, while 
Workbench 3.1 was released in 1994. Also, in both cases a new Kickstart ROM 
needs to be installed.
 Workbench 3.5 and 3.9 require a higher specified Amiga, so standard 68000 based
machines are not supported.

9.2. Can I dual boot between 1.3 and 2.0 Workbenches?

Yes, it is possible. You can use a ROM switcher to switch between 1.
3 and 2.04 ROMs. If using a Hard disk and sharing the same boot partition, it 
must be:

a) Formatted using 1.3 version of FFS as the 2.0 version of FFS will not work
under Workbench 1.3.
b) The system files must be kept seperate. For example, one of the Workbenchs
must be in a sub-directory and Assigned during the startup sequence to use
the alternative workbench.
c) The startup-sequence must be able to determine which ROM version is in use
to execute and load the correct Workbench. See Aminet for useful boot utilities.

9.3. Why do some old Workbench 1.3 programs do not work on Workbench 2.0 Amigas?

When the Amiga came out, programmers who used to work on the old 8-bit computers
such as the ZX Spectrum and C64 were used to using old tricks to get the best
performance out of the computers and used undocumented features to gain 
them. 

The specification of the old machines never changed so programs will work on all 
computers. The Amiga is an expandable machine so you can add memory, change 
the processor, update the ROM and so on. The programmers made assumptions on the 
Amiga, so expected all machines to have 512K chip ram, 1.2 or 1.3 ROM, a 68000 
and OCS chip set. For the A500+ this changed to 1M chip ram, 2.04 RAM, a 68000 
and ECS chipset.

 The assumptions they made were now wrong and programs no longer worked as things 
had moved or increased. Some programs, didn't like having Fast RAM, the new 
Kickstart, the new ECS chipset or extra peripherals and crashed when loaded. 
A list of compatibility problems are listed in Appendix D and E of the @{b}RKRM 
Libraries@{ub} manual.

9.4. I have an A600 but I cannot access my hard disk, why?

The version of Kickstart you have may not include the correct @{b}scsi.device@{ub} 
to allow you to setup hard disks. Select <b>About</b> from the Workbench menu or 
Type @{b}version@{ub} in a shell to see what version of Kickstart you have. 
If it does not end with a @{B}5@{ub} or a @{b}0@{ub} then you need to change your 
Kickstart ROM.

9.5. Which version of Workbench has CrossDos?

CrossDos has been licenced from Consultron and it is a limited version for use
with floppy disks so you cannot format hard disks from it (although it is possible
to read pre-formatted PC disks). Workbench 2.1 came with Crossdos which includes
the Crossdos commodity to convert files on the fly and the PC0 and PC1 DosDriver
files. 

9.6. I have WB 2.04, do I need a new Kickstart for Workbench 2.1?

No, Workbench 2.1 is a disk or software upgrade only, so you can still use your
existing 2.04 or 2.05 (v37) kickstart. Note: Early A3000 Amigas came with 
Kickstart 2.00 (v36) and will require a new Kickstart to v37.  

9.7. Can I use the Internet with Workbench 2?

Yes, you can use TCP, Email, FTP, News and other Internet programs with the 
exception of Web Browsers most Internet software will run on Workbench 2 or 
higher. 
Most Web browsers require Workbench 3 or better although you can use @{b}Lynx@{ub}
which will allow you to view HTML in text only.

9.8 I cannot seem to use Compugraphic Fonts?

You need to copy the larger diskfont.library from the Fonts disk to your Libs:
directory to use CG fonts.

To display the information required by a command type a '?' after it.
     Note, after each arguement there is a slash and a character.
This specifies the kind of argument required such as an option
or a name or a value.

/A   - Argument must be supplied
/F   - Must be final or last arguement
/K   - Keyword must be entered with a parameter
/M   - Multiple arguements may be supplied

@NODE ERRMSG "Error Messages"

@{u}4.2 Error messages@{uu}


     If you enter a command and comes back with an error message, typing
WHY will display more information about it. Use the FAULT command to
display the error message that applies to a error code.

Typical error messages are:

Code Description                        Solution

103  Insufficient free store            Free up some memory by quiting other

There are another set of error messages called 'Software Failures' which is displayed
when the computer crashes. 
It consists of two numbers. the first is the error id and second the address of the task:

ssggeeee aaaaaaaa

ss = Subsystem Id, gg = general error, eeeee = specific error

The most common ones are CPU traps:

00000002  Bus Error (memory doesn't exist)
00000003  Address error (usually odd address access)
00000004  Illegal instruction 
00000005  Divide by zero
00000006  CHK instruction (Check register against boundaries)
00000007  TRAPV instruction (Trap on overflow)
00000008  Privilege violation
00000009  Trace (debugging)
0000000A  Op Code 1010 (unimplemented instruction)
0000000B  Op Code 1111 (unimplemented instruction)

Exec:

81000005  Corrupted memory list
81000009  Memory freed twice

There are programs available that can prevent some failures from occuring such as MCP and
so on which will allow you to continue or kill the process.

     and they are usually used in conjunction which a slash to
     seperate the names
     e.g. DIR DF0:Devs/Printers
     
     An assign is a special shortcut name to a volume or a drawer
     and is created using the ASSIGN command.

@NODE Probs "Common Problems"

@{u}5. Common Problems@{uu}
 
 
5.1 How do I retreive a file I accidently deleted? 
 
     You need to use a Disk Recovery program such as QB Tools, 
FixDisk or Disksalv to scan and recover the file. You cannot 
retrieve a file that has been deleted and the disk written to 
later on as it will most likely been overwritten! 
 
5.2 How can I view hidden file from Workbench? 
 
  Use the Show, All Files option in the Window menu. Workbench applies 
standard icons for Tools, Projects and Drawers where it can. There are 
Default Icon programs which try and allocate appropiate icons to files 
depending on their type. 
 
5.3 How can I create a bootable disk? 
 
     The simplest method is to Duplicate your Workbench disk, delete 
the Utilities and the System files (if not required), copy the  
program to the disk and then edit the s:startup-sequence to run 
your program. This method also guarentees that all the necessary 
files are also on the disk. 
     The minimum required to make a disk bootable is to use the Install 
command to save a bootblock to the disk. Create a directory called S 
and create a startup-sequence file with the name of the program and 
save that in the S directory and copy your program to the disk. 
To use install with one disk drive, type INSTALL ? then swap disks 
and type DF0: and press RETURN. 
 
5.4 How can I speed up disk access when using the shell? 
 
     The shell is a very powerful feature but can be limiting and 
annoying when working from floppy. You can make common commands 
run from memory by using the Resident command which allows the Amiga 
to use commands from memory instead of loading them from disk. 
For example, Resident C:Dir pure will make the DIR command resident. 
You can make this a permanent feature by modying the S:Shell-Startup 
file and insert these resident commands. 
     Also, it is a good idea to do all work on the RAM: disk if you 
have plenty of memory instead of saving to/from disk. 
 
5.5 Why do some icons, when double-clicked, don't load up? 
 
     There are two reasons for this. First, if a program is deleted 
but its .info file is left behind then the program or file may seen 
to still exist. To rectify this, the program should be re-copied back. 
     Second, a lot of Project icons have A Default Tool set. This  
default tool loads up the program and the data file. There are many 
tools, particularly text and graphics viewers. If you try to run 
a file with a Default Tool that you don't have then the following 
message will appear: 'Unable to open the tool &lt;file&gt;' 
If this happens, select the icon and choose Info from the Workbench 
menu and change the Default tool to the one you do have. For example, 
if its a text file, change it to 'More' (Workbench's Text Viewer). 
 
5.6 Can I make ENV: point to ENVARC: rather than RAM:ENV? 
 
  You could but that would be an unwise move. As ENVARC contains preferences 
Saved from a Prefs program and are permanent while those in ENV are temporary. 
If you USE a new prefs settings, this would be temporary until the next time 
its changed back or a reboot, if ENV pointed to ENVARC, all preference changes 
will be saved and made permanent. You should always have ENV in a different location 
even if it means making a new directory for it. 
   A third party program called HappyENV does sometimes help in this situation. 
 
5.7 I cannot get PC0 Crossdos icons to appear? 
 
  The PC0 and PC1 DOSDrivers are used to mount PC disks. When you insert a PC disk, 
the Amiga will try to read its format first then the PC format and try to mount 
a disk. If the PC0 icons are located in Devs/DosDrivers they should be auto-mounted 
on startup. If icons do not appear try adding the ACTIVATE=1 tooltype to each icon. 
NB: CrossDos is only available from Workbench 2.1 or better.
