05.26.31 #       * Dave_C isn't a gamer, sorry.
05.26.35 #       <m0lder> I can't get it to work..
05.26.37 #       <Dave_C> what's it doing?
05.26.41 #       <Dave_C> or not doing?
05.26.46 #       <m0lder> don't start...
05.26.50 #       <Dave_C> ugh.
05.26.57 #       <Dave_C> that's no fun.
05.27.07 #       <m0lder> I get the saeness logo at the start, but it never fades out and loads the game
05.27.23 #       <m0lder> sadeness even..
05.27.28 #       <Dave_C> tried clicking, or hitting return?
05.27.40 #       <m0lder> *doh* ofc I tried
05.27.49 #       <Dave_C> well..
05.27.52 #       <Dave_C> hehehehe
05.28.00 #       <Dave_C> you never know
05.28.04 #       <m0lder> =o)
05.28.06 #       <Dave_C> I've seen silly things
05.28.16 #       <m0lder> I'm not that silly
05.28.31 #       <Dave_C> I didn't think you were, but that's usually the first thing...
05.28.39 #       <m0lder> and the keyfile is protected against copying ?
05.28.56 #       <m0lder> because I can't copy it to my HD
05.29.06 #       <Dave_C> I hate whne ppl 'play' with the filesystem...
05.29.23 #       <Dave_C> hmmmm
05.29.31 #       <Dave_C> can you 'read' it?
05.29.48 #       <m0lder> umm...I didn't try...it's kinda big though
05.30.08 #       <Dave_C> if it's unreadable, that could be why it's sticking.
05.30.16 #       <Dave_C> trying to read the key and can't,
05.30.28 #       <m0lder> ok..it's 50Mb..I'll try
05.30.37 #       * Dave_C is not that up on the new copy protection tricks.
05.30.45 #       <Dave_C> the KEY is 50 megs?
05.30.51 #       <m0lder> yeah
05.30.57 #       <Dave_C> that sucks
05.31.06 #       <m0lder> sorta like protection against wide copying over the net I guess
05.31.18 #       <Dave_C> probably a dummy file.
05.31.59 #       <Dave_C> We (on the #CNet channel) have been known to 'play' 3G wav files when there are leeches around.
05.32.09 #       <Dave_C> they're only dummy files, but they get the msg across

05.33.58 #       <Dave_C> DW does that to me infrequently, usually when I have somewthing else causing corrupt seglists
05.34.00 #       <m0lder> I kinda like it...
05.34.18 #       <m0lder> if you ignore the bugs
05.34.26 #       <Dave_C> Oh it's pretty and all, but it's like Windows... WAY too big for what it is.
05.35.21 #       <m0lder> It was already installed on my machine when I bought it )second handed( and I didn't want to bother instaling everything again )since most programs was registered versions =o) (
05.35.35 #       <Dave_C> that's understandable...
05.36.18 #       <m0lder> And it's nice for my useage of my machine...mainly Internet...and some games..
05.36.24 #       <Dave_C> I wish I could be of more help with the game problem.
05.36.46 #       <m0lder> well...I guess I'll look at the numerous updates for the game..
05.36.53 #       <Dave_C> There should be some more folks joining in soon...
05.37.02 #       <m0lder> yeah ? who ?

05.38.33 #       <Dave_C> re Bastard
05.38.42 #       <Bastard> Hi Dave_C
05.38.45 #       <Bastard> Hello TB Darxide_TA Dave_C HMetal m0lder Byte
05.38.53 #       <m0lder> earlier, i used high buffers on sound and graphics, then I didn't even see the logo..
05.39.05 #       <m0lder> hi Bastard 
05.39.07 #       <m0lder> =o)
05.39.11 #       <Dave_C> how much free ram do youhave?
05.39.35 #       <m0lder> well..i got PicassoIV with 4 MB gfx, and 2+48 extra ram
05.39.45 #       <Dave_C> that should be plenty
05.39.46 #       <m0lder> right now about 40 MB free
05.40.32 #       <Dave_C> unless something is changing things in chip ram or jumping on the ROM image
05.40.52 #       <m0lder> i'm using 3.1 relokick though
05.41.06 #       <Dave_C> that 50M keyfile is what gets me.
05.41.18 #       <TB> mo: Do you run the newest setpatch?
05.41.26 #       <TB> Dave: Its a good idea.
05.41.53 #       <m0lder> i guess the keyfile isn't protected, but i can't copy it either...maybe a bug on the CD ?
05.42.04 #       <Dave_C> oh, I'm all for protection, but 50M? whew!
05.42.16 #       <TB> Good idea.
05.42.25 #       <m0lder> I'm using Setpatch v40.16
05.42.45 #       <TB> Thats old.  The new setpatch may help.
05.42.48 #       <Dave_C> molder: the CD could be bad... I've gotten my share of those.
05.42.50 #       <m0lder> the AGA version works ok though
05.42.59 #       <m0lder> not the RTG..=o/
05.43.00 #       <Dave_C> hmmmm
05.43.17 #       <m0lder> that's what bothering me
05.43.23 #       <TB> You do realise the have had nothing but problems with getting it to work on Picassos, so dont worry to much its your system.  Mail them and hassle them
05.43.53 #       <Dave_C> here's the latest setpatch for you too.
05.43.59 #       <m0lder> well...why release the game when they coun't guarantee compability ? =o/
05.44.16 #       <TB> Because they are using Basic to code the game... so, you can only do so much.
05.44.21 #       <m0lder> I even mailed Paul himself about PicassoIV problems
05.44.48 #       <m0lder> os Picasso96 I mean...the GFX system...should I switch to CyberGFX then 
05.44.53 #       <Dave_C> BASIC? Ack.. I haven't used that in 11 years or more
05.45.32 #       <Dave_C> I doubt I remember half of the syntax.. ;^)
05.45.41 #       <TB> mo: Only if you need to.
05.45.56 #       <m0lder> Is CyberGFX rated better than Picasso)& ?
05.45.57 #       * Dave_C uses CGFX
05.46.11 #       <TB> They each have advtages.
05.46.18 #       <Dave_C> <nod>
05.46.37 #       <m0lder> *sigh* I wish they could agree on one system...
05.46.55 #       <Dave_C> CGFX and ModePro from aminet work great for me here, but I can't say about games...
05.47.03 #       <TB> The ICOA wanted a common system, dont know what happened there
05.47.19 #       <Dave_C> molder: that's part of what AI is doing... setting a STANDARD API.
05.47.27 #       <m0lder> =o)
05.47.46 #       <TB> OpenGL + Extra stuff from AI is the new gfx standard
05.47.51 #       <m0lder> well....but in themeantime...I can't play Foundation....)I love Strategy games(
05.47.53 #       <Dave_C> now if they can get hardheaded programmers to pay attention when they release it...
05.48.27 #       <m0lder> I hope Napalm is released soon though...It's going to be great..
05.48.35 #       <Dave_C> and there are WAY too many hardheaded game programmers out there.
05.48.50 #       <m0lder> does any of you code in C++ ?

05.56.35 #       <m0lder> I'm planning to update my homepage, and wondered if I could put a lot of pictures of scanned posters on the net without any agreement with the author ?
05.56.51 #       <Dave_C> that's kinda iffy
05.57.00 #       <m0lder> I got them on the net though...and FTP servers

05.57.19 #       <Dave_C> they can still be protected by copyright
05.57.31 #       <Dave_C> contact the sites and ask...
05.57.33 #       <m0lder> but I do get a warning to remove them if they find out, and don't sue me at once ?
05.58.06 #       <Dave_C> depends on the company and if they've had a lot of ppl doing it.
05.58.16 #       <m0lder> what If I credit the autor of the pictures then ?
05.58.17 #       <Dave_C> they get pissed off and want to make someone an example.

14.24.49 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: But not since it has become official?
14.24.56 #       <m0lder> Agima: Do you know if any update will make it work on my Picasso96 system ?
14.25.00 #       <Arvid> Agima: looking
14.25.07 #       <Dave_C> only been 4 days...

14.29.53 #       <Seed> Agima: there's a problem with the HTML in your page.. you can't use "<body bgcolor=ffffff text=000000>"
14.30.09 #       <Dave_C> any comments on me posting the help channel logs to aminet weekly?

14.31.16 #       <Ogge> <body bgcolor=ffffff text=000000> should be <body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
14.31.33 #       <Seed> eeek.. yes, I meant to add that
14.31.33 #       <Ogge> or <body bgcolor=black text=white>

14.37.59 #       <Dave_C> for AMD
14.38.02 #       <Dave_C> K7's
14.38.10 #       <Gaz> i didnt read that
14.38.24 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: I'll volunteer :)
14.38.27 #       <Gaz> motorola have their own chips tho
14.38.32 #       <Dave_C> Yoshi: Me too
14.38.54 #       <Dave_C> and NONE are targetted at the desktop market anymore.
14.39.02 #       <Yoshi2> Gaz: http://www.ann.lu/ :)
14.39.05 #       <Dave_C> great for embedded apps
14.39.07 #       <Gaz> well mac/amiga are desktops ;)

14.39.59 #       <Dave_C> Mac is going x86 too...
14.40.00 #       <Trolan2> Dave_C: so they're manufacturing the K7.  no diff from TI being the ones to make UltraSPARCs
14.40.46 #       <Trolan2> Dave_C: makes sense too as AMD licensed the copper technology.. let someone who has the facilities to do it, do it
14.41.13 #       <Dave_C> I just don't see a PPC future.
14.41.15 #       <Seed> Silicon Graphics goes that way too
14.41.21 #       <Dave_C> not for AMiGA
14.42.40 #       <Cosworth> who can help me on an amiga problem ?
14.42.59 #       <Trolan2> Dave_C: and where'd you see this Apple x86 thing?
14.43.10 #       <Rocambole> Cosworth: just ask :))
14.43.10 #       <Seed> Cosworth: I can try
14.43.29 #       <Gaz> well ill stick with ppc until the super amiga arrives, then ill see if its any good
14.43.32 #       <Cosworth> hmm i cant load in my pc disks and run a game any idea ?
14.43.40 #       <Dave_C> Tro: news.com I think
14.43.59 #       <Seed> Cosworth: PC disks?
14.44.22 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: I see you added some banners to your site :)
14.44.25 #       <Dave_C> Cos: running PC software on an AMIGA will let out all the magic blue smoke...
14.44.29 #       <Cosworth> yeah i have a game on disk and want to see waht its like running on my amiga
14.44.37 #       <Cosworth> but drive light just goes off?
14.44.37 #       <Gaz> hahah
14.44.44 #       <Gaz> he's kidding
14.44.47 #       <Cosworth> do i need a upgraded d/d ?
14.45.23 #       <Arvid> <--leaves
14.45.25 Quit    Arvid (:Exciting? ME?)
14.45.30 Quit    Agima (:PC Emulator has booted. Now resetting for no apparent reason.....)
14.45.40 #       * Cryto is outa here for now..  Lightning.
14.45.47 #       <Dave_C> Cos: Is it a PC game?

14.46.12 #       <m0lder> lol
14.46.18 #       <Cosworth> yeah
14.46.21 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: To run PC games on an Amiga you need an emulator, like PCTask, and these things are quite slow
14.46.21 #       * Rocambole is signing *OFF*
14.46.23 #       <Dave_C> hahahaha
14.46.23 Part    Cryto
14.46.36 #       <Rocambole> bye
14.46.38 #       <Seed> Cosworth: I'm too tired to understand, sorry :)
14.46.42 #       <Dave_C> l8r roc
14.46.42 #       <Gaz> Cosworth: bye the amiga equivalent
14.46.42 Quit    Rocambole (:Client exiting (hmmm.....what's happening?))
14.46.48 #       <Cosworth> hmm will the amiga play them the same speed as my p2 400 ?
14.46.52 #       <Gaz> Cosworth: buy the amiga equivalent
14.47.14 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: Short answer: NO
14.47.31 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: I got bored a few weeks ago. I ran Fellow under PC-Task on my 040 :)
14.47.47 #       <Dave_C> depends on your amiga.
14.47.47 #       <Gaz> Cosworth: mine will ;)
14.47.47 #       <Cosworth> i have a ppc
14.47.47 #       <Dave_C> what model
14.47.48 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: It took about 50 minutes to get to James Pond's starting screen
14.48.04 #       <Yoshi2> Seed: I'm already bored by Shapeshifter on this 040/40 :)
14.48.05 #       <Dave_C> what processor
14.48.05 #       <Dave_C> what clock rate
14.48.17 #       <Dave_C> PC software will only run on AMiGA OS using an emulator
14.48.20 #       <Cosworth> 604e 200mhz a4000
14.48.28 #       <Dave_C> kinda like how AMIGA software runs on a PC.
14.48.37 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: There's no PC emulator currently, that makes use of the PPC
14.48.38 #       <Merko> I have a PPC too. And no PC :)
14.49.01 #       <Trolan2> Dave_C: only thing I see is "IBM copper chip due for Macs"
14.49.06 #       <StG^sNTx> PCx PPC is on it's way
14.49.14 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: you need to move to Z3 graphics :)
14.49.14 #       <Merko> Cosworth: Don't use an Amiga to emulate a PC.. especially if you already have a PC.
14.49.16 #       <Gaz> mac emuls do dont they
14.49.26 #       <Dave_C> Tro: It's been a month or so.
14.49.38 #       <Cosworth> is my 604e 200mhz a4000 faster than a p2 400 ?
14.49.52 #       <Yoshi2> Gaz: Not yet.  Fusion PPC is said to be on it's way, but some people don't really trust Jim Drews
14.50.04 #       <Gaz> right
14.50.04 #       <Cosworth> oh, i forgot 
14.50.10 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: Depends what you want to do and what OS you're running :)
14.50.18 #       <Dave_C> depends on the application and IF it addresses the PPC
14.50.26 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Yeah.. that would actually work, not for newer games though but it would be nice for people who need to use some PC proggies or games that don't need a top notch PC.
14.50.38 #       <Gaz> Cosworth: maybe
14.50.38 #       <Gaz> raw power the 604e 200 is probably p2 400 standard, not sure
14.51.13 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: I trust Jim Drew to screw up every time :) I've been on the Fusion mailing list since the beginning and he doesn't disappoinnt me often :)
14.51.17 #       <Cosworth> is there a clasylardy on here ? or classylady i for got her nick. she said she wants to cyber me last night but my girlfriend was here and i can only cyber on Tuesdays as she works nights :)
14.51.21 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: so no chance of playing carmageddon then?
14.51.28 #       <Merko> Gaz: Probably not quite.. though maybe, I have a feeling compilers are better optimised for Intel.
14.51.35 #       <StG^sNTx> Cosworth: classylady is on from time to time, yes
14.51.39 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: I don't know what that is. 8)
14.51.41 #       <AAlley> Yeah, she hangs here.
14.51.43 #       * Dave_C is gearing up for the Next Generation, not hanging on the the patchwork leftovers from C=/EsCom
14.51.51 #       <Gaz> Merko: yeah, i imagine that bigger mhz ppc boawrd will be released too
14.52.08 #       <StG^sNTx> Shpaeshifter is going ppc too btw
14.52.14 #       <Gaz> Cosworth: dont talk about that in main ;>
14.52.18 #       <Seed> classylady? here? :)
14.52.27 >>>     'seen' used by Yoshi2 (ckemp@ppp22.vo.lu) [snoop prevented]

14.52.46 #       <Yoshi2> classylady (RukhS@*.ephrata.desupernet.net) left the channel 10 hours and 24 minutes ago
14.52.52 #       <AAlley> When I want to cyber some chick, I don't do it in public.
14.52.53 #       <Seed> ShapeShifter will get PPC just after Fusion does ;)
14.52.53 #       <Dave_C> Cos: If you want/need cyber'ing, /join #subnation
14.53.04 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: I doubt that
14.53.04 #       <Dave_C> hehehehe
14.53.21 #       <Cosworth> AAlley she does it all the time ? thought it was normal ?
14.53.24 #       * Merko has just gotten himself a very nice Amiga to play with for the coming 2-4 years, before something better may or may not come along. 68k wouldn't do until then.
14.53.30 #       <AAlley> Unless, of course she thinks it's kinky:(
14.53.32 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: u doubt carmageddon or shapeshifter ppc?
14.53.41 #       <Cosworth> aint this the channel she meets ppl ?
14.53.48 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: what's carmageddon?
14.53.49 #       <Gaz> heh
14.53.59 #       <AAlley> Carmagedden: Explain please...
14.54.09 #       <Dave_C> yes, but this isn't a cybersex channel
14.54.13 #       <Cosworth> i got a pic of me on the photocopier hehe
14.54.15 #       <Dave_C> AA: Armaggedon in a Car?
14.54.19 #       <AAlley> I have a URL for Carmageddon
14.54.19 #       <Gaz> Cosworth: what sort of nick is Cosworth anyway, you like all those gadgets in the cars eh? 
14.54.21 #       <AAlley> heheh
14.54.23 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: a 3d driving game where you get points for crashing and killing
14.54.27 #       <Cosworth> Dave_C how do i get her ?
14.54.29 #       <Cosworth> any idea ?
14.54.29 #       <Seed> I have Fusion.. I'm pretty happy with it.. it's just that Jim Drew's a weird guy.. he won't admit his mistakes.. it took us ages before he admitted a bug in version 2.0
14.54.29 #       <Trolan2> Dave_C: that was July21st.  nothing else close to it
14.54.45 #       <AAlley> Carmageddon resource site: www.g3pb.com
14.54.51 #       <Gaz> i hate coders who make buggy software ;-p

15.09.20 #       <Gaz> compuserv is 100% pc tho Dave_C ?
15.09.22 #       <Cosworth> Seed yeah i know :)
15.09.26 #       <Yoshi2> Gaz: Read ANN :)
15.09.36 #       <Dave_C> Gaz: That's why she's bringing 'em here
15.09.38 #       <Gaz> i cant be bothered ;)
15.09.45 #       <Dave_C> I'll paste it
15.09.50 #       <Gaz> k
15.10.08 #       <Dave_C> From Fleecy, today:
15.10.08 #       <Dave_C> Amiga OS5 will consist of a brand new kernal with a brand new
15.10.08 #       <Dave_C> set of APIs, which will be written in C++, with a subset of mirrored
15.10.08 #       <Dave_C> Java classes. Whilst the new OS will follow many of the design
15.10.08 #       <Dave_C> philosophies and principals of the classic AmigaOS, the API set will
15.10.09 #       <Dave_C> include both new and industry standard APIs, such as OpenGL.
15.10.09 #       * AAlley would be happy to host a conference on how to use MUInt and DosReqTools
15.10.11 #       <Dave_C> The kind of new features we want to add to the operating system,
15.10.13 #       <Dave_C> cannot
15.10.15 #       <Dave_C> be supported within the frame work of the existing APIs. For instance,
15.10.17 #       <Dave_C> resolution independent graphics and a unified printing model will
15.10.20 #       <Dave_C> require such major rework of the classic API's that we decided that a
15.10.21 #       <Dave_C> rewrite
15.10.22 Part    TroySwoosh
15.10.23 #       <Dave_C> was a better approach. The same can be said for the kernel, user
15.10.25 #       <Dave_C> interface
15.10.25 #       <Seed> Don't read ANN. I hear it's a worldwide conspiracy to drive people nuts :)
15.10.27 #       <Dave_C> etc.
15.10.29 #       <Dave_C> Therefore, the answer is no - the classic AmigaOS API set will not
15.10.31 #       <Dave_C> appear in OS5. That is not to say that a third pary can't take the
15.10.33 #       <Dave_C> existing classic API set and implement them  on top of the new API
15.10.35 #       <Dave_C> set, if they so desire.
15.10.37 #       <Dave_C> As for the "structure" of the OS (devices, libs etc), that process
15.10.39 #       <Dave_C> is ongoing at the moment and more information will be revealed when
15.10.43 #       <Dave_C> it has been completed
15.10.50 #       <Cosworth> how do you get ops here ppl ?
15.10.57 #       <Dave_C> beg me
15.10.59 #       <Cosworth> im only joking about the amiga :)
15.11.09 #       <Seed> Is flooding allowed here?? Yeeha! :)
15.11.12 #       <Cosworth> i do know more that that hehe
15.11.13 #       <Dave_C> ops are something that is earned
15.11.26 #       <Cosworth> than that
15.11.48 #       <Gaz> Dave_C: sounds interesting, but AmigaOS5 and super amiga's are too far in the future for my liking, why not get ppc wb3.1 ;-)
15.11.52 #>>     "faq begops" by Dave_C (davecook@host227.internettport.net)
15.12.08 #       <Cosworth> is classy op ? can i ask her ? as i get on really well with her
15.12.15 #       <Rafling> Gotta go..
15.12.15 Quit    Rafling (:Leaving)
15.12.16 #       <StG^sNTx> Dave_C: what does it take to get it? (OP's?) U've seen roc op me pronto each day:)
15.12.39 #       <Dave_C> because as has been said OVER and OVER, Motorola nad PPC are not on the same path of revolutionary computing that AMIGA is
15.12.40 #       * Gaz is afraid that the next amiga's will be too much like pc's.. and they will not keep the good things about amiga's
15.12.48 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: Why would you want to be OP, anyway?
15.12.55 #       <Seed> StG^sNTx: you only need an IQ higher than 70.. that's the only requirement :)
15.13.05 #       <Gaz> Dave_C: yeah i know, but for the meanwhile ppc will do nicely
15.13.07 #       <Merko> Dave_C: So what?
15.13.08 #       <Cosworth> to help ppls probs on amigas
15.13.16 #       <Cosworth> and chat have a laugh
15.13.20 #       <HMetal> Gaz: AI would be stpid to do that.. To many avid Amiga people are behind them pushing it all along.
15.13.27 #       <Merko> Dave_C: 68k is not enough.. something else will take 2-3 years..
15.13.29 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: You can do that without being op :)
15.13.30 #       <StG^sNTx> Seed: I'm nowhere close then:) I did manage to open a door on my own last week though
15.13.39 #       <Cosworth> i really have a 1200 040 25mhz
15.13.42 #       <Gaz> well AI havent been very kind to amiga developers have they
15.13.57 #       <Gaz> i can vouch for Cosworth, he's normally a very nice guy! ;-)
15.14.02 #       <Cosworth> Yoshi2 ? hmm thats a psx nick ehh :)
15.14.02 #       <HMetal> Gaz: They haven't cut my arms off yet.. :)
15.14.09 #       <Yoshi2> Cosworth: Nope
15.14.10 #       <Gaz> hahah
15.14.12 #       <Cosworth> Fanx Gaz
15.14.19 #       <Gaz> HMetal: well they've cut off my coding fingers ;)
15.14.25 #       <Seed> StG^sNTx: I opened the window. Still excited over it :)
15.14.27 #       <Gaz> metaphorically speaking of course
15.14.28 #       <HMetal> Gaz: And they really haven't done anything with/to developers.. There is no real official developer forum yet..
15.14.44 #       <Yoshi2> HMetal: ICOA?
15.14.52 #       <HMetal> Gaz: How have they cut off your coding fingers??
15.15.02 #       <Seed> Zelda2 could be a nice nick :)
15.15.20 #       <Cosworth> Yoshi2 ? hmm Yoshi`s Island cant think of that game now ? it from a snes ?
15.15.24 #       <HMetal> Yoshi: ICOA is the final result but I've seen very little in the way of what CATS used to offer..
15.15.31 #       <HMetal> ..that's what <<I>> am waiting for..
15.15.40 #       <Gaz> well it depends if the 'developer machine' will run on the amiga side, or not. i mean if theit amiga on a pci card works as a normal amiga they should be able to develop the stuff the same as they would on a normal amiga.. and if thats the case, why not use one
15.15.41 #       <Trolan2> HM: <nod>
15.15.59 #       <Trolan2> the dev tools for the MMC are available only on x86 last I heard
15.15.59 #       <Yoshi2> HMetal: Don't know, all I have is the complete RKRM's :)
15.16.02 #       <Trolan2> that's why
15.16.10 #       <Gaz> right
15.16.15 #       * StG^sNTx wonders what a window is
15.16.19 #       <Gaz> which means existing amiga developers are knackered
15.16.29 #       <Gaz> unless they buy a pc and a amiga pci card..
15.16.29 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: It's those things on your computer
15.16.31 #       <Seed> StG^sNTx: I think it's made of glass :)
15.16.34 #       <Gaz> which is helping pc more than amiga
15.16.39 #       <Cosworth> sorry about the cyber thing ppl, only classy said to meet her here
15.16.59 #       <StG^sNTx> Dave_C: is there any way for me to find out how many times or how long i've been on here totally?
15.17.12 #       <Seed> Cosworth: forget her.. I'm sure she has other things on her mind :)
15.17.25 #       <Trolan2> Gaz: just for the interim machine.  works for me.. I was going to make a system for gaming with friends anyways.. I just made it a bit beefier than I had to.  =)
15.17.26 #       <Cosworth> Seed hmm like ?
15.17.53 #       <HMetal> Gaz: knackered???  Why?  You either develop for the machines that are currently out there, you develop for the new Amigas (when the time comes) or you do both.  How are you being knackered?
15.17.55 #       <StG^sNTx> Seed: that's the shiny things my mum and dad drinks out of that I accidentally broke last week, right?
15.17.59 #       <Seed> Cosworth: anything, really. shopping, going to sleep ;)
15.18.01 #       <Gaz> Trolan2: well i think its a bit backwards to buy a pc to develop for my amiga ;-)

15.18.14 #       <Gaz> HMetal: because i have to buy a pc to do it
15.18.23 #       <Merko> Bah.. The OS won't be useful for developers for several years either, unless you can afford to develop for a machine with no users at all of course, and don't mind having an unfinished OS. So, the answer is to code portable code.. and then you can just as well code for PPC too.
15.18.26 #       <HMetal> Gaz: That's an interim solution also..  If you don't want to use a bridge system, wait until '99. :)

17.58.06 #       <TA> what's up?
17.59.07 #       <TA> did you see what Christian Kemp published on comp.sys.amiga.misc and the TA lsit?
17.59.28 #       <TA> list even?
18.00.02 #       <Dave_C> yup
18.00.29 #       <Dave_C> a clarification of the kernel decisions.
18.01.16 #       <TA> someone broke NDA on the ICOA list.
18.01.23 #       <Dave_C> made perfect sense to me.
18.01.56 #       <Dave_C> ??
18.02.00 #       <TA> yes, but that puts fleecy in a jam and you can bet the info will only get tightter now.
18.02.34 #       <TA> and Cristian is going to put it on ANN as well.
18.02.51 #       <TA> I would have thought he knew better?
18.03.21 #       <Dave_C> what I saw was just a clarification of what has been said before.
18.03.42 #       <Dave_C> that a new kernel would be needed for OS5, based on C++ w/ JAVA 
18.03.52 #       <Dave_C> Havemose said that in IRC
18.04.31 #       <TA> I sent it to fleecy and haven't heard back yet. So I don't know if he is upset or not, but it is that it is a quote from the NDA ICOA list that upsets me.
18.05.19 #       <Dave_C> the post just explained common sense of re-writing 'exec' instead of patching up the existing one.
18.05.35 #       <TA> right, but it is where it came from that bothers me.
18.06.11 #       <TA> fleecy knows he can come here or the newsgroups himself if he wanted that donw. That is why I am upset.
18.06.19 #       <TA> done.
18.06.25 #       <Dave_C> understood.
18.06.46 #       <Dave_C> I was gonna cross post, but moved 'em out of outbound:
18.07.06 #       <TA> won't matter now I guess. It's already done.
18.07.32 #       <TA> Christian can deal with fleecy if he is mad about it.

18.13.58 #       <Harlock> what does it mean?
18.14.39 #       <Dave_C> to me, it means, "don't hold your breath..."
18.14.40 #       <TA> Unless 3rd parties do something with PPC now there may not be much.
18.15.10 #       <Harlock> how can i make warpos softw. run?
18.15.10 #       <TA> If you are a programmer, you can use H&P's stuff to roll your own program's.
18.15.55 #       <Harlock> and if i'm not?
18.16.43 #       <TA> Harlock: If you aren't then you need to start bugging P5 for some software and stuff and hope they follow thru.

20.15.32 #       <Smouse> AAlley would U recomend a Gateway Laptop since they have the Built in DVD player heheh
20.15.37 #       <TA> I wonder if Rocamble sent the press release to AI and amiga.de?
20.16.04 #       <TA> They were waiting on it too.
20.16.18 #       <TA> did he mention Dave_C ?
20.16.34 #       <Dave_C> uh... 
20.16.36 #       <AAlley> Smouse: I have no direct knowledge of Gateway HW.
20.16.37 #       <Smouse> WOW I cant believe that AAlley dont have Ops here for all that he has done for the Amiga in the past and what he is going to do in the future
20.16.44 #       <Smouse> ah ok hehe
20.17.15 #       <AAlley> I never beg ops. It's Gary's channel.
20.17.42 #       <Smouse> ok then I beg ops for me pal AALLEY
20.17.46 #       <AAlley> TA: Does Losty every show up here?
20.18.00 #       <Dave_C> If he would register his nick w/ Nickserv, we could think more about it
20.18.08 #       <TA> I just don't want more ops than peeps ... First it is the team who started the channel then we will work from there.
20.18.38 #       <TA> AAlley: I haven't seen lost man here yet. But he will come as soon as I catch him on #amiga.  :)
20.18.41 #       <Dave_C> Roc has added some good folks, but I'll keep it down.

20.19.05 #       <Dave_C> /msg nickserv help
20.19.40 #       <TA> some people get scared when they see a channel full of ops. That's why I sometimes unop myself even.
20.20.01 #       <AAlley> beyondnet.net??? what's the URL?
20.20.18 #       <Smouse> "http://www.BeyondIrc.Net"
20.20.23 #       <AAlley> Ah!
20.20.41 #       <Dave_C> ppl who are reg'ed w/ nickserv and chanserv (controlled by Gary and I) can BE op'ed, but auto-ops will be restricted to special folks, and the help team itself
20.20.45 #       <Smouse> I just reged me Nick that is how I know :)
20.22.06 #       <TA> AAlley: Matter of fcat I haven't seen Losty anywhere in about a week or more? Is he sick or something?
