05.40.29 #       <ChrisP> That's neat that you could tell.  How can you?
05.40.39 #       <Dave_C> the guy that's sending me the java telnet client hasn't sent the actual applet yet
05.40.52 #       <Dave_C> Miami logged it to the console.
05.42.02 #       <Dave_C> once that applewt is installed, java compat. browsers will be able to login to the BBS
05.42.36 #       <Dave_C> I just redid the page a day or 2 ago, and the BBS pages are in a different directory now, and some may be missing.
05.42.56 #       <ChrisP> java huh... I guess I'll have to boot my PC to do that...

05.43.20 #       <Dave_C> all but one clickthru on the main page are AMiGA specific, of course.
05.43.54 #       <DNA> re all
05.43.57 #       <Dave_C> for now, telnet login requires only a good ANSI capable client
05.44.46 #       <ChrisP> ok.  that's good.  I haven't used telnet in ages but now I have a reason.
05.45.13 #       <Dave_C> term w/ telser.device works fine

05.47.20 #       <boOZleBaM> hi dna
05.47.20 #       <Dave_C> nope
05.47.41 #       <Dave_C> like I said, that's the first time I've seen AWS log anything to the console.
05.47.42 #       <DNA> I did the same as you a few minutes ago :)
05.48.02 #       <boOZleBaM> oic
05.48.10 #       * Dave_C doesn't feel like he'll be much help right now...
05.48.16 #       <Dave_C> too little sleep and NO coffee.
05.48.26 #       <boOZleBaM> ahh
05.48.33 #       <boOZleBaM> get some Josta :)
05.48.44 #       * Dave_C works in a band, and didn't get home til 4:30

05.49.57 #       <boOZleBaM> no no sleep is the enemy ;)
05.50.20 #       <Dave_C> sleep is my friend, just doesn't visit me often enough
05.50.29 #       <Dave_C> chronic insomnia sucks hard
05.52.06 #       <Dave_C> Chris: outside the bbs links, how'd the page look?
05.52.22 #       <boOZleBaM> i'm gone later
05.52.29 Part    boOZleBaM
05.52.44 #       <Dave_C> frames size correctly? all links show in the index bar?
05.53.12 #       <DNA> great!
05.53.49 #       <Dave_C> oh, and believe it or not, we had a guy from SAS in here yesterday!
05.54.00 #>>     'seen' used by Dave_C (davecook@host239.internettport.net) [snoop prevented]
05.54.01 #       <TB> SAS?
05.54.06 #       <DNA> oops, sorry, but I'm happy -- I've just got an answer from Ted wallingford 
05.54.13 #       <TB> I see him everyday :)
05.54.19 #       <ChrisP> Dave:  Let me have a better look.  One sec.
05.54.30 #       <TB> I see ted everyday to.  Well, on IRC
05.54.37 #       <Dave_C> SAS Institute - former developers of SAS/C
05.55.10 #       <Dave_C> we asked... no hope on a new or even RE-release
05.55.12 #       <DNA> TB: well, but this concerns the fact I have emailed Bill McEwen (I'm writing an article for our local diskmag)
05.55.43 #       <TB> DNA: Ask away... 
05.55.52 #       <Dave_C> BUt Steve had some good pointers for ppl using SAS/C
05.56.00 #       <DNA> Tb: sorry?
05.56.04 #       <ChrisP> It would be great to have SAS back again.
05.56.16 #       <TB> dna: What ya asking abot bill, or of bill?
05.56.28 #       <Dave_C> but alas, the compiler market is a low paying one.
05.57.00 #       <Dave_C> They're doing just dandy w/ their DBM stuff and aren't negotiable on the compiler at all
05.57.07 #       <ChrisP> Dave:  The site looks good.  Everything is where it should be.  :)
05.57.11 #       <DNA> TB: hmm. I have emailed Bill directly, but there was some bound error, so Ted answered on behalf of Bill
05.57.31 #       <TB> dna: Ahhh ok.  What were ya asking bout?
05.57.35 #       <DNA> TB: but now he has forwarded it directly to Bill...
05.58.23 #       <DNA> TB: well, about AMiga, Inc. , something on MMC, something on not invting Haynie to that chip presentation
05.58.59 #       <TB> AI has some ulta strict security on the Mitchy, so even Dave Haynie would be a breach.
05.59.01 #       <DNA> TB; soory, it's a long story, and I havta go now... I have a deadline on Monday and I have to email Dave again...
05.59.14 #       <Dave_C> DNA: I believe Dave asked the right questions, and has gotten the info enough to not talk about it in the manner he did before.
05.59.24 #       <DNA> TB: well, Petro dont like PIOS, that's the reason probably
05.59.43 #       <TB> Petro hasnt got anything to do with Amiga Inc in anyway at all.
06.00.21 #       <Dave_C> Petro is lucky if he knows what he's marketting half the time.
06.00.25 #       <DNA> Dave_C: I dont think so....  I have asked dave -- if he knew something, he would tell he cant speak about 
06.00.52 #       <TB> Dave is now competition, so why give them the advantage?
06.00.56 #       <DNA> Dave: thats true. Byt maybe a god will bless him...
06.00.58 #       <DNA> huh, havti gom really :(
06.01.01 #       <Dave_C> not NDA stuff, but figured it out from the snippets that have been out there.
06.01.03 Quit    DNA (:Link too hot ...)
06.01.55 #       * Dave_C just noticed a sudden shift in Dave's conversations about MMC
06.02.21 #       <Dave_C> He stopped postiong doubting articles and in effect stopped talking about it at all.
06.03.19 #       <Dave_C> I'm hoping Fleccy stops by, and doesn't get flooded off w/ everyone asking him NDA questions
06.03.44 #       <TB> hehehehe :)
06.03.59 #       <TB> I havent had a good talk to Fleecy in almost a year now.

11.57.44 #       <MacEm> Cheers rocam. I was just talking to some Turkey called "Dr.Spooky" who was talking nonsense about device units. He said that the Unit in a mountlist does not relate to the SCSI ID. IE. setting the unit to 4 in a mountlist wont mean it checks ID 4 on the specific SCSI device ??

12.56.46 #       <Braindrop> It's important to keep your fan healthy. My PC Cyrix died after it's fan failed. Started getting strange random errors, then divide by zero errors. I swapped out the memory, the HD, the CD-ROM, and about to switch the Power Supply when I saw the fan wasn't working. It was hot enough to fry an egg.

12.57.47 #       <alanwall> Seed:yea I hear it can get hot there and I only have 2 slots full at present/rest when I get it running better-then add the toccatta/multi-face/2065

12.58.15 #       <Seed> NiteFlite: I use Fusion.. not with an Oktagon. I can tell you where to find the FAQ about these things
12.58.18 #       <Yoshi2> ExiE: The channel started about two hours ago
12.58.23 #       <Alfresco> Yoshi2: Thanks.  Erm, anyone here switching on their Amigas less and less these days?  In preference to other platforms, that is.
12.58.26 #       <Seed> womble: I need a fan in my brain :)
12.58.40 #       <ExiE> i need the official time ? :)) for news :)
12.58.51 #       <Yoshi2> Alfresco: No.  I'm using Amigas exclusively, and don't miss much ATM.
12.58.51 #       <Seed> alanwall: where in California?
12.58.57 #       <Yoshi2> ExiE: 18:00 GMT
12.59.26 #       <ExiE> GMT is ?
12.59.29 #       <Alfresco> ExiE: Check www.ann.lu.  It states that this channel opened on 31/7/98...don't know 'bout time though
12.59.46 #       <DrJekyl> ExiE GMT is BST-1 ;)
12.59.52 #       <NiteFlite> Well, Fusion can "detect" my zip drive connected to my Amiga via the Oktagon scsi card, sigh.
13.00.03 #       <alanwall> Seed:hour north of San Fran and 1 hour south of Carl Sassenrath
13.00.06 #       <NiteFlite> I hear AlfaData stuff are hacks though.
13.00.12 #       <Yoshi2> ExiE: GMT = CET-2 ATM

13.00.35 #       <Yoshi2> ExiE: No, 20:00 CET
13.00.50 #       <Amigaman> alanwall: sounds like good wine country..

13.01.08 #       <Seed> alanwall: I didn't know Carl has a city named after him :) but he deserves it, I guess :)
13.01.42 #       <ExiE> Yoshi2: are u sure ? u was there in this time ?
13.01.53 #       <alanwall> Amigaman:and beer 2, the beer that AI got for the party at AmiWest was so bad there was some left 2 days later
13.02.03 #       <Alfresco> could I get a rough idea about Amiga stability?  My '030 A1200 just crashes too much :(  ie. How many times an hour/day do you re-boot.  Anyone got a truly stable setup?
13.02.11 #       <[X_MaN]> right FIRSSTLY LET ME POINT OUT!
13.02.17 #       <Yoshi2> ExiE: I'm here snce 21:00 CET, but I know that it officially started at 20:00
13.02.20 #       <[X_MaN]> Whoever lamer says the UGN doesnt know
13.02.35 #       <[X_MaN]> I reqquested assistance from what was to become the UGN 10 months ago...
13.02.39 #       <Yoshi2> Alfresco: My A3000 is much more stable than my A1200 ever was
13.02.41 #       <[X_MaN]> SO ...
13.02.55 #       <Amigaman> alanwall: Maybe the beer was from Idaho... :-)
13.02.56 #       <Ogge> alfresco, i have a '030 1200 too and the only crashes i have is with unstable programs.. otherwise it's stable
13.03.36 #       <Alfresco> Yoshi2: Do u recommend A1200 > A3000 (plus expansions) as an interim upgrade path.  Or should I go 4000
13.03.39 #       <[X_MaN]> and MR fabian Jimenex GO READ UR EMAIL and u will see a mail from me requesting permisssion to use Ur pages FAQ`s!
13.03.41 #       <ExiE> Is there somebody who can confirm start of this channel at 20:00 CET ? :)
13.03.42 #       <Seed> My A1200 never crashes.. it sits in the box that the scanner came in :)
13.03.45 #       <Yoshi2> Alfresco: On the A1200, I rarely stayed online for >30min, on the A3000 I often switch it on in the morning and switch it off in the evening
13.03.50 #       <Arvid> Alfresco: I seem to reboot this A3000 about once every six days
13.04.04 #       <Rocambole> ExiE: I can ;)
13.04.05 #       <[X_MaN]> Niteflite About 6 months ago this was
13.04.06 #       <alanwall> Amigaman:no it was valley beer,I come from the town that had the first brew pub since prohibition in Cal
13.04.11 #       <Yoshi2> Alfresco: I'm entirely satisfied with the A3000.  040/PicassoII
13.04.27 #       <alanwall> 3000 RULE!
13.04.48 #       <Alfresco> Do you think my crasing probs are due to a very early GVP ROM on the acclerator...something like Jawsv1.0 on my A1230+ card???

13.05.27 #       <Seed> Hi Christian
13.05.32 #       <Braindrop> Alfresco: My 3000 I kept on 24/7 and had to reboot, maybe once a week
13.05.33 #       <Dozer> Seed: hello there
13.05.36 #       <Yoshi2> Alfresco: I had some problems with my DKB...  the first firmware wouldn't allow warmboots and the second would make the Amiga crash quite often
13.05.41 #       <Ogge> alfresco, tried with another 1230+ card?
13.06.06 #       <Alfresco> I've had Amiga's for 8 years...but never a 3000.  was surprised to hear that the 3000 has some sort of DSP chip, or am I wrong?
13.06.24 #       <Seed> Alfresco: it doesn't have one
13.06.29 #       <Yoshi2> Alfresco: No, the A3000+ was supposed to have one, but there were only a few prototypes
13.06.37 #       <alanwall> X-ManN:found out why my Amiga sent down on Saturday at AmiWest-the cleaning staff unplugged while Casey was running the web cam rexx script
13.06.41 #       <Dozer> Alfresco: The A3000+ had one.. but was only produced in an amount of 7-8 machines
13.07.22 #       <Dozer> The specs on the A3000+ were kinda cool by the way... ;)

13.13.00 #       <Womble> New Amiga companies will have a lot of trouble getting funding
13.13.03 #       <Rocambole> Alfresco: some programs don't fre memory in a proper way, that causes many crashes when corrupted freememory list is detected
13.13.13 #       <Arvid> Yoshi: but are they independently wealthy?

13.15.53 #       <Rocambole> Womble: the flushing allways frees some memory and it prevents crashes on my miggy. Can't explain why though
13.16.39 #       <Alfresco> Rocambole: Have tried numerous utilities that manage mem lists...with sme success.  But even with minimal startup files, some process will sooner or later bring the machine down.  Are Amiga progs inherently unstable?  By this I mean will the same set of conditions always result in a crash (and exactly the same type of crash).  Take Magic Menu for eg.  Sometimes I can use it for hours.  but every now and then it'll freeze up the machine...Empirica
13.16.49 #       <alanwall> Roc:what do u think about memory protection on the new Amiga?
13.17.32 #       <Alfresco> ...exactly the set of conditions that must exist for MMenu to do this.  This is just one eg.  Many progs.  behave in a similar way on my A1200.  Just never know when it's going to go...
13.17.32 #       <Rocambole> alanwall: I say it is a must

13.18.51 #       <Rocambole> Alfresco: well, I agree with you that you never know when it's happening. Sometimes I get a flash of grey screen when I have to reboot, sometimes a blue screen
13.19.27 #       <Womble> Rocambole: The screen will flash with the colour of the last pixel displayed before Lisa got reset, I think.

14.55.41 #       <Cryto> Arvid: All jumpers on both A3k's are set the same, other than the ones for the 040 board in this machine..  So I am thinking its gotta be something else..  Specially since I swapped all chips, and it still didnt work.  And the 1950 does get a signal from that port..

14.57.31 #       <Cryto> Arvid: That the VDE adjuster you are talking about?  Or those 2 screw things on the MB a ways back in it near Agnus?
14.57.46 #       <Arvid> Cryto: ah yes the VDE clock signal
14.57.52 #       <Cryto> Arvid: I think that one makes it 31 KHz only.  I cant remember.
14.58.06 #       <Arvid> CRyto: oh ... I think you must be right
14.58.51 #       <Cryto> Well, find out exactly what those 2 screw things do.  The one near the toggle is the VDE adjuster.  I think something is outputting a slightly higher signal, that the 1084's/1080's just cant touch, but the 1950 can.
14.59.18 #       <Arvid> yeah .. VC198 and VC479 I think it is
14.59.45 #       <Cryto> Cant remember that the #was, but..  What exactly do those two do?

15.38.57 #       <Harv_> horgan came to me and asked me for an imagefx 3.0 review. which I gave him.
15.39.05 #       <StG^sNTx> and?
15.39.10 #       <[X_MaN]> Harv_:Well the lot of them have their blunders, I have not been reading the magazine sinc e I was shoddily treated by them about two years ago
15.39.12 #       <Harv_> well, let me finish, will ya?
15.39.26 #       <Harv_> I turned in the review, as per his spec, with screenshots..
15.39.44 #       <StG^sNTx> please go on:)
15.39.46 #       <Harv_> two days later he says "I'll have to rewrite a bunch of it and your screenshots are crap I"ll have to redo alll of them"
15.39.54 #       <Harv_> so he re-writes 50% of my review
15.40.03 #       <Harv_> and then he says "of course I'll still pay you at a reduced rate."
15.40.05 #       <Harv_> well,
15.40.15 #       <Harv_> in 12 years of professional writing, NO editor had ever told me that.
15.40.26 #       <Harv_> I told him, no, you'll pay me what we originally agreed to.
15.40.39 #       <Harv_> he said okay, I'll pay the original price but you'll never write for CU again.
15.40.39 #       <StG^sNTx> did he pay?

15.41.01 #       <Harv_> so my article appears (in the june issue), two of my big screenshots ARE there, and half of it is not what I wrote.
15.41.31 #       <Harv_> so I figure he was looking to squirm out of the original $$ agreement.
15.41.32 #       <StG^sNTx> I'm in the middle of a discussion with them now, and haven't heard from them since I mailed my last arguments, and that's atleast 2 weeks ago
15.41.49 #       <Harv_> and just looking for any excuse in order to pay me less.
15.41.56 #       <phoe> amiga magazines are poor value these days.. £5.99 for about 40 pages and a lousy CD...
15.42.15 #       <Harv_> and if he pulls that shit with me, he must bepulling it with others.
15.42.55 #       <Harv_> so the hell with him and his magazine.
15.43.25 Part    zikke
15.43.28 #       <Harv_> and I'll have to see if he publishes anything about me and the ICOA election.
15.43.31 #       <StG^sNTx> which screenshots are yours? I'm looking at the review right now
15.43.41 #       <Harv_> the one with the girl/eye/bridge is mine.
15.44.00 #       <Harv_> and l.a. city hall inside the big kinda "flower" thing is mine.
15.44.07 #       <Rocambole> Harv_: your name is there at the end of the article
15.44.20 #       <Harv_> rocambole yes it is. in 2 point microscopic type. 
15.44.49 #       <phoe> Harv_: can you sue him for changing the content of the article without permission ?
15.45.00 #       <Harv_> it was Horgan who put in all those references to "mighty photoshop."

15.45.11 #       <Harv_> phoe - not hardly.
15.45.17 #       <portnoy> Just saw on the news that IBM was fined for selling computers to the USSR nuclear weapons industry. I was kind of wondering what killed it.
15.45.22 #       <Harv_> stg - yes the same screenshots he told me were trash, he used them anyway.
15.45.57 #       <Harv_> phoe - editors edit. that's their job. but my original article, which I showed to a number of friends, who agreed, did not NEED any editing. 
15.46.04 #       <StG^sNTx> hehe
15.46.07 #       <phoe> portnoy: hehehehehe seen the thing about Microsoft and Caldera - MS have been forced to hand over the Windows source

15.50.30 #       <Harv_> all I know is he gave me the bum's rush and I'll tell this story to anyone who wants to hear it.
15.50.54 #       <Harv_> judging from Horgan's picture in the magazine, I'd say I was writing Amiga articles while he was still crapping in his diapers.
15.51.00 #       <phoe> I did the same after I had problems with a computer shop in the UK... they've had several mails telling them their service stinks :-)
15.51.36 #       <phoe> I posted their replies (with spelling mistakes) on the same page too ;-)
15.51.37 #       <StG^sNTx> A q: what would happen if cu dissapeared? I can't get format where I live anymore, so Cu is the only mag in the shelves with the word amiga on the cover.
15.51.49 #       <Harv_> why can't you get format?
15.51.57 #       <Harv_> both of them print about the same number of copies.
15.52.06 #       <phoe> Harv_: there's only the 2 magazines in the UK now (I think)
15.52.13 #       <StG^sNTx> newsstand stopped importing it I guess
15.52.18 #       <Harv_> phoe - and 2 in the usa - amazing and informer. 
15.52.26 #       <Harv_> and informer isn't on any newsstands at all.
15.52.39 #       <StG^sNTx> any of u read amiga survivor?
15.52.40 #       <phoe> Harv_: and one of the largest chains of 'zine distributers won't touch ANYTHING amiga now
15.52.46 #       <phoe> not yet
15.53.04 #       <Harv_> phoe well that's something that AInc with their Gateway muscle behind them should do something about, isn't it.
15.53.11 #       <StG^sNTx> just wondering if it's worth checking out
15.53.15 #       <phoe> StG^sNTx: I think they could do with having issue one on the webpage in it's entirety...
15.53.33 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: I got both of them here (Narvesen)
15.53.38 #       <phoe> StG^sNTx: no-one's likely to pay if they can't check it out first...
15.54.08 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: I've been to narvesen around here several times the last months and all I c is CU
15.54.14 #       <phoe> Harv_: I think the platform as we know if now is on it's last gasps of life...
15.54.31 #       <Harv_> phoe - i was just at amiwest. their first show. 700 people showed up and packed the place. 
15.54.34 #       <phoe> Harv_: the new platform might re-invent the Amiga (with luck), but we need action soon
15.54.47 #       <phoe> Harv_: only 700 ????
15.54.53 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: and I'
15.54.58 #       <Harv_> 700 ain't bad for the first show put on by two user groups.
15.55.05 #       <phoe> Harv_: tbh, only 700 visitors is pathetic :-/
15.55.12 #       <Harv_> perhaps, perhaps not. 
15.55.25 #       <Rocambole> and I'm subscribing on The Amiga Informer too
15.55.27 #       <Harv_> they had only printed 500 tickets and ran out the first day and had to print more.

15.56.56 #       <phoe> Harv_: we need appreciable numbers of people willing to invest in new hardware to keep the platform alive

15.57.21 #       <Harv_> phoe if you had been there you wouldn't have called it a failure. yes it was a small show - only 15 tables. 
15.57.21 #       <Agima> [X_MaN]: Not really, hoping I can give someone else help :)
15.57.40 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:than you for your effort, it is greatly appreciated
15.57.55 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:you own the new Amiga site right?
15.58.02 #       <Agima> [X_MaN]: No problem, just one friendly Amiga user hoping to help some others :)
15.58.06 #       <Agima> New Amiga site?

15.58.18 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:the new news site
15.58.24 #       <phoe> Harv_: i'm not saying it was a failure, but it's too small scale to risk betting $$$ on a new platform !!!!
15.58.43 #       <Agima> I run Amiga Universe at http://www.amigauni.u-net.com and http://www.amigauniverse.ml.org, if they count :)

16.04.51 #       <StG^sNTx> ello gott
16.04.53 #       <Gott> Hi all
16.04.54 #       <Agima> He bought my Blizzard '030/50 from me, but ever since he installed it in his A1200 (which he bought a week after it's release), it keeps crashing, unless he uses the Early Startup Menu to disable CPU caches
16.05.14 #       <Agima> And even then IBrowse is as unstable as you can possibly get.
16.05.32 #       <phoe> Agima: I think there's some variations in A1200 motherboards
16.05.33 #       <CyberWolf> OK AMIGAns I 've to go! Sleep! It's 1 am here in Luxembourg! Nit all
16.05.52 #       <Rocambole> CyberWolf: welcome back soon :)
16.06.00 #       <CyberWolf> Will do so!
16.06.00 #       <phoe> I had a similar problem with one accel, but not with others, and a GVP G-Lock won't work on mine without crashing the system
16.06.01 #       <[X_MaN]> StG^sNTx:pass what test from me?
16.06.04 #       <Rocambole> CyberWolf: and have a good night
16.06.08 #       <Agima> After a suggestion that the motherboard was a problem, I swapped my Escom m/b for his Commodore m/b. My Blizz. '060 works on his old m/b, but the '030 still won't
16.06.24 Quit    CyberWolf (:Client exiting)
16.06.46 #       <phoe> Agima: was it a Magnum '030 ?
16.06.58 #       <Agima> When he bought his hard drive here and stuck it on my brothers Magnum '040, it worked. Took it back home, and it didn't work
16.07.08 #       <StG^sNTx> [X_MaN]: we were equal in number of sentences typed in the channel, so i said it to get one ahead of u:)
16.07.16 #       <Agima> Phoe : Blizzard '030 (his), Magnum '040 (brother's), Blizzard '060 (mine)
16.07.38 #       <Agima> AFAICS, his hard drive seems to be a problem. Works on my brother's '040 but not his '030 (unless CPU caches are turned off)
16.07.50 #       <phoe> I had a Magnum - load of crap - the company selling them tried to blame the memory, until I told them THEY supplied it
16.08.12 #       <[X_MaN]> StG^sNTx:lol u think so huh?  Ur just lucky Im working as I talk crap all the time;)
16.08.18 #       <Agima> I'm running his motherboard inside my brother's 1200, he has MY motherboard and I have my brother's motherboard. But that's another story :)
16.08.44 #       <phoe> Agima: nothing like keeping it in the family !!!
16.08.50 #       <Agima> Phoe :)
16.08.52 #       <StG^sNTx> Agima: strange prob.
16.09.08 #       <Agima> It's because my Microvitec monitor didn't work in Super72 on the Escom motherboard. So we swapped. :)
16.09.14 #       <StG^sNTx> I have both 1200 and blizz 030/50 and i've had my probs but not like this..
16.09.16 #       <Arvid> Agima: so you are saying the problem stays with the Blizzard 030 no matter what
16.09.17 #       <phoe> .. so it's the Blizzard '030 that doesn't work ? the rest are fine ?
16.09.22 #       <Rocambole> Agima: I'm using a Quantum FireBall and have no probs
16.09.56 #       <phoe> Fujitsu 1.7Gb this end...
16.10.02 #       <Agima> Arvid : It seems to be something to do with the hard drive my friend uses. I must have forgotten to mention that when we put the '030 back into my brother's machine, it worked flawlessty with his(my brother's)  hard drive
16.10.23 #       <phoe> Agima: spooky... what make HD is it ?
16.10.28 #       <Rocambole> Agima: hmmm....must be the HD then
16.10.29 #       <Arvid> Agima: oh ... even more complicated ....
16.10.49 Quit    LeeROY (:Client exiting)
16.10.53 #       <Agima> Phoe : I couldn't tell you, but it's 630Mb and he's had that since he got his A1200 (a week after UK launch)
16.10.59 #       <phoe> Agima: could it just be that you just didn't have the problems in the time you tested the other HD ?
16.11.12 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:sound slike u have an illegal patch in ur system
16.11.20 #       <phoe> Agima: hmm... it's quite old then...
16.11.23 #       <StG^sNTx> Agima: does it happen EVERY time or just now and then??
16.11.23 #       <phoe> I wonder...
16.11.25 #       <Agima> Phoe : Thing is, if he doesn't disable the CPU caches, it is 100% guaranteed to crash
16.11.47 #       <Agima> StG^sNTx: Nope, not occasional, EVERY time. If he doesn't disable CPU caches it doesn't even get past SetPatch
16.11.50 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:a patch that doesnt like the CPU
16.11.52 #       <Harv_> bbl
16.11.55 Quit    Harv_ (:I'm not as think as you stoned I am. )
16.12.19 #       <Agima> [X_MaN]: He refuses to run any "patches", "kludges", or "hacks". Except MUI, which he HAS to run.....
16.12.25 #       <StG^sNTx> Agima: he isn't running blizz kick or something?
16.12.40 #       <phoe> anyone know if the HD cache can cause problems like that ? ie. if it's faulty, and not handling the data it gets from the CPU when it's in full flow ?
16.13.07 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:I doubt that to be true, most people say that, after runnign new libraries for things, new datatypes, and having stuff in User startup they have forgotten
16.13.19 #       <phoe> I had a 20Mb HD that wouldn't work properly when it was FFS formatted, but fine OFS formatted
16.14.03 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:the other thing it could be is a virus, one that crashes on higher CPU systems, there are MANY that do this
16.14.03 #       <phoe> if it's fine with other accel's tho... hmm...
16.14.04 #       <Agima> [X_MaN]: Possibly. I'd have to check
16.14.16 #       <Agima> [X_MaN]: AFAIK, he always virus checks
16.14.39 #       <[X_MaN]> Agima:using the wrong ones 90% of the time, WHo here uses TRSI virus workshop?
16.14.42 #       <phoe> Agima: join the virus help team denmark for the latest updates tho !
16.14.46 #       <Dave_C> err..
16.14.47 #       <Dave_C> I'm back
16.14.56 #       <phoe> [X_MaN]: how old is that now ????
16.14.57 #       <Dave_C> Agima: one question...
16.15.05 #       <Agima> Dave_C: Shoot :)
16.15.11 #       <phoe> BANG !
16.15.13 #       <Dave_C> the hd interface in question.... IDE or SCSI?
16.15.14 #       <StG^sNTx> Bang!;)
16.15.23 #       <Agima> Dave_C : Internal A1200 IDE
16.15.34 #       <Dave_C> hmmm
16.15.35 #       <phoe> this is turning into a GANG BANG !!!
16.15.38 #       <Agima> (Except it's an IDE cable that used to hold a CD ROM drive as well)
16.15.50 #       <Dave_C> and the interface on the o3o card you're hooking it to?
16.16.00 #       <Arvid> Agima: it is a 3.5 inch IDE?
16.16.27 #       <Agima> Arvid : 3.5, yes
16.16.56 #       <Arvid> <-- guesses a power problem with the load from the 030 card and the IDE loading the 5-volt line
16.17.13 #       <Agima> Arvid : A power problem? He has a Goliath
16.17.22 #       * Agima must remember these details next time.....
16.17.34 #       <[X_MaN]> phoe:Virus workshop is probably the most updated, it is far superior to anything in englush, only Vrus T knows more virii, but that is only German:(
16.17.36 #       <Arvid> Agima but inside the A1200 .. does he have a separate power line to the IDE drive?
16.17.48 #       <phoe> all my HD's (internal and external) run from a PC PSU, not the amiga PSU (that supplies just the motherboard)
16.18.10 #       <Agima> Arvid : One cable to the floppy drive and the other to the hard drive from the motherboard?
16.18.26 #       <phoe> [X_MaN]: what about VC and VZ ?

16.18.56 #       <phoe> [X_MaN]: I recently got a trojan added to them...
16.19.00 #       <Arvid> Agima: I think there should be a separate power line .. both 5 and 12 volts from the external power supply to the IDE drive .. I suspect voltage drop in the wiring inside the A1200
16.19.05 #       <phoe> took them 3 days !
16.19.23 #       <[X_MaN]> Phoe:Virus workshop probably already knew it
16.19.30 #       <Dave_C> phoe: got that update/patch/brainfile handy?
16.19.49 #       <[X_MaN]> Phoe:also VW can also do heuristic so it will catch a virus anyway
16.19.56 #       <Agima> Arvid : My brother has the same setup, except with a bigger capacity Seagate 1.2Gb HD, and a 4x CD-ROM on the wire
16.20.15 #       <phoe> Dave_C: nope :-( don't think so... lemme check
16.20.24 #       <Arvid> Agima: but what is the voltage measured at the drive power connector?
16.20.42 #       <Agima> Arvid : To be honest, I haven't got a clue :)
16.21.00 #       <phoe> Dave_C: unless you run Maxs BBS you'd be safe anyway
16.21.16 #       <phoe> it was designed to run as a door, and it overwrites your RDB
16.21.31 #       <Arvid> Agima: I think you should check it .. if the voltage at the drive is lower than 4.8 volts, that is always a problem
16.21.36 #       <Dave_C> there was someone talking about a CNet specific trojan type and I was wondering about it.
16.21.39 #       <phoe> it calls a patched powerpacker library called Maxpacker.library
16.21.51 #       <[X_MaN]> Dave:run heursistic from VrusW before u run a prog, ull now if it is a virus, I have tried it lots of times with new virri 
16.22.10 #       <Agima> Arvid : But if it was a power problem, why would disabling CPU caches at Early Startup prevent the crashes that he'd get with them switched on?

16.22.35 #       <Dave_C> I just hate scanning every file on my system hunting for things that have wedged themselves in already.
16.22.45 #       <Arvid> Agima: well ... that is one of those questions ... maybe the drive draws less current with the caches off
16.23.01 #       <Agima> It's certainly possible, I'll talk to him about it.
16.23.14 #       <phoe> Dave_C: I can send you the virus'd lib itself if you want it ?
16.23.20 #       <Agima> But if you ask me, he wants to get himself a new hard drive. :)
16.23.47 #       <Dave_C> HMetal may want it... he'd the CNet author.
16.23.53 #       <Arvid> Agima: a really new drive will draw much less current and would be a really good thing

16.27.02 #       <Womble> Arvid: You cannot clock them that high.
16.27.09 #       <Agima> Arvid : Where did you hear that?
16.27.17 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:the millitary probably uses Crays, not x86
16.27.18 #       <Womble> Arvid: They may well have parallel systems though.
16.27.40 #       <Arvid> Womble: just what I heard .. from a tech guy at a nearby military base .. he says the systems are all liquid cooled with good old Freon

16.28.50 #       <phoe> most chip's still use quite a large die for their chips.. there's a 0.9 micron (I think it was...) chip burning method developed on the cheap, that no-one is using yet
16.29.19 #       <phoe> they reckoned it would take another 8-10 years to get where they just got it to...

17.38.32 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: I've seen something about a chip looking like the MMC.
17.38.32 #       <Arvid> <-- thought MMC referred to Main Man Charlie and his computer discount warehouse
17.38.42 #       <Womble> Make your own MMC out of sticky-backed plastic and washing-up liquid bottles

17.39.20 #       <Womble> Never mind
17.39.26 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:yes
17.39.41 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Not 10-15!!!!!!
17.39.52 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: I've only heard and read about one.
17.39.56 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:maybe even more actually
17.39.59 #       <Womble> Do 'merkins have washing-up liquid or do they just sling everything into a turbo dishwasher?
17.40.07 #       <Womble> I'm sure I've never seen 'merkins wash up
17.40.37 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: The thing BitBrothers is doing look nice to me.

17.41.56 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: www.bitboys.fi
17.41.59 #       <Womble> I mean, clearly they had picked something, but now it isn't clear that the deal is still on.
17.41.59 #       <RobSDA> Re!
17.42.01 #       <[X_MaN]> Womble:that iis called unsettling the sand, lets not do that;)
17.42.03 #       <Womble> Hi RobSDA 
17.42.32 #       <[X_MaN]> Womble:Squid speculates that the negotiations Inc is involved with are regarding the quickpac saga and not the MMc
17.42.44 #       <Womble> [X_MaN]: Why waste their time with that shit?
17.42.53 #       <[X_MaN]> 1Womle:squid speculates with sources unrevealed;)
17.43.04 #       <Womble> [X_MaN]: They should let Amiga Int deal with that
17.43.20 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Their chip is called Glaze3D.
17.43.24 #       <[X_MaN]> Womble:business, if newtek go belly up on the flyer, its one more battle to lose, also the play box is based on quikpac, and the play thing is a new market
17.43.42 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:that is a gfx subsystem, the MMC is a CPU system...
17.43.51 #       <Womble> [X_MaN]: Err.. but Play has nothing to do with Amiga
17.43.57 #       <RobSDA> Any word on wether or not the BoXeR is still due for an August (this month) release?  And if so, if they have managed to get the AA+ chipset that Access Innovations has been working on into that release of the motherboard, or will it come on a future release?  Thanks.
17.44.04 #       <Womble> [X_MaN]: And I thought NewTek was raking it in from Lightwave these days?
17.44.08 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Hmmm It look like a chip to me.
17.44.23 #       <[X_MaN]> Womble:ugh wrong company, I dont mean pla as in ex DC and newtekkers, I mean that interactie tv thingie
17.44.27 #       <Womble> AA+ is for the next revision, I believe. The delay seems to be due to a problem sourcing chips
17.44.35 #       <Womble> [X_MaN]: Playable TV?
17.44.39 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Are you sure, the MMC is a CPU?
17.44.41 #       <[X_MaN]> Womble:thats the one
17.44.51 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:yes no doubt whatsoever
17.45.06 #       <Womble> So of course the Quikpak business does need to be dealt with
17.45.08 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Ok, where do you get that info?
17.45.15 #       <Womble> How much money is in dispute, anyway? Anyone know?
17.45.19 #       <RobSDA> Womble:  There is also the MagicBox company that utilizes that Quikpak A4000 in their 'Pro' system, and shortage of A4000's will hurt them, too.  Must be a lot of smaller companies that use the Amiga technology that will be hurt adversly if the legal problem isn't settled.
17.45.29 #       <Womble> RobSDA: Never heard of them.
17.46.02 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:From a number of sources, one being Amiga inc
17.46.11 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Ok.
17.46.48 #       <Womble> It's not official and they won't say but enough hints have been dropped.
17.46.53 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:The MMC system is a CPU with multimedia functioning such as the Strongarm and Mpact chips
17.47.08 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
17.47.12 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: Ok, never heard of them.
17.47.29 #       <Geomol> [X_MaN]: I hope the future is bright for the Amiga.
17.47.55 #       <[X_MaN]> Womble:exactly, somethings dont have to be spelt aloud to be in black and white, but last I heard Bill Mewen referred to a MMR not MMC
17.48.24 #       <[X_MaN]> Geomol:Bright is too soon, brighter than it could have hoped for is where we are now
17.49.45 #       <[X_MaN]> WOmble is the man to speak to on brightness, never seen such a pessimist;)

17.50.40 #       <RobSDA> Will the BoXeR motherboard be a suitable replacement for the Quikpak systems if that doesn't get settled?  I am still not sure how Amiga Video Slot compatible the BoXeR is for Toaster/Flyer, et al. uses.

18.05.35 #       <Kinners> TA: Thanks for clearing that up (about exec being the kernel)
18.05.37 #       <ChrisP> Even if exec isn't the kernal if it is based on it (ie. near real-time OS) I'll be happy.
18.05.41 #       <[X_MaN]> TA:for 4 or 5?
18.05.58 #       <[X_MaN]> TA:Will an Execlaike be used?
18.06.26 #       <Arvid> alanwall: I dunno for sure.  I think he wants to be at work before 7AM Pacific Time .. maybe earlier.  By that time altavista is getting 700 or so hits per second
18.06.31 #       <TA> What happened at Amiwest was that Bill M said AI knows that Exec is great and that the new kernal must be exec like.
18.07.09 #       <[X_MaN]> TA:oh, thats what had been said from the start since WOA, my god these rumours confuse things
18.07.28 #       <alanwall> TA:did not Carl say something about exec and rebol in 5
18.07.42 #       <RobSDA> TA:  Not going to be the bridge/OS4 kernal, or not going to be the Final/OS5 kernal?
18.08.47 #       <TA> alanwall: Yes, but again he was talking, at least to me, about exec-like that Havemose is working on.

18.11.28 #       <RobSDA> TA:  Okay.  That was the last I had heard that made sense.  Thanks for the confirmation.  The main thing that I hope they don't lose in our OS (besides the quick and stream-lined aspects) is the feeling that 'anything goes'.  Just so flexible between shell/GUI and ability to modify and add-on, etc.  My 2c.
18.12.09 #       <TA> That is what Bill was saying Havemose is working to keep.
18.12.32 #       <TA> what is 16 UTC?
18.13.03 #       <Kinners> Isn't UTC another name for GMT?
18.13.03 #       <Arvid> TA: that is about the time I'll be at a friend's house trying to get a new HD working on his A3000

18.17.03 #       <Arvid> alanwall: depends on the language.  
18.17.09 #       <TA> There was 14 guys betting $10 US a month on powerball.
18.17.10 #       <DrJekyl> Q. why choose a channel name that the server strips a character out of on connect (*) ?
18.17.12 #       <Womble> alanwall: UTC is the standard name, though I think IBM may call it UCT

18.18.39 #       <TA> It was just 250 plus million. Goes up as more people bet and each week without a winner.
18.19.03 #       <TA> It's like a 5 state lotto.
18.19.19 #       <Womble> I thought it was rather more than that. But what is the stake?
18.19.19 #       <Arvid> TA: ... I think 26 states
18.19.48 #       <Womble> I mean, how much is each ticket?
18.19.50 #       <TA> DrJekyl: If you get a chance, let the amirc author know about the bug. If enough iof us let him know, maybe he will fix it?
18.20.11 #       <TA> Womble: I think they are like a buck a number or something.
18.20.19 #       <TA> 6 numbers

18.20.24 #       <DrJekyl> Womble: BTW, this is a server fault. " It don't choose a different nick if one is being used ! "

18.22.08 #       <Agima> TA : Beta version I think. Failing that, the NetConnect 2 version
18.22.19 #       <Womble> DrJekyl: I don't what would cause that. Maybe the server is using the wrong error code?
18.22.52 #       <Womble> DrJekyl: It would be a bug for AmIRC to watch for only one type of error though

18.29.17 #       <TA> Trez: The exec kernel is NOT going to be used for OS4-5. Bill M merely said that what Exec is they want to keep an exec-like kernel going for the amigaNG

18.45.22 #       <TA> DrJekyl: The CNet beta testers set up the channel for Team AMIGA. We invited the JMS to come and join us. They developed the idea of a help channel.

19.51.17 #       <Womble> Destroy your PC? Why?
19.51.55 #       <Kinners> Because it is the most annoying thing I have ever used
19.52.32 #       <Kinners> Of course, I would probably lose my job, so it isn't such a great idea :)
19.53.29 #       <HammerD> what is your job?
19.54.21 #       <Kinners> Programming.  It is probably the luckiest thing that has ever happened to me (getting that job), because I'm not all that great a programmer :)
19.54.33 #       <Womble> Kinners: What, are you at work now?
19.55.52 #       <Kinners> Womble: No, I work from home.  It's just a small job, but I have an illness, so I wouldn't be able to do many other jobs
19.56.00 #       <Womble> I see
19.56.29 #       <Womble> I'm looking for a job at the moment, and suspect I will have to be using Windoze NiceTry in that
19.56.37 #       <Womble> :-(
19.56.40 #       <HammerD> why are you on a PC?
19.56.44 #       <HammerD> womble you are in the uK?
19.56.51 #       <Womble> I'm in the UK
19.57.01 #       <Womble> Why is who on a PC?
19.57.01 #       <Kinners> I'm struggling with Visual Basic, which has it's pros and cons.  Though the last few days I have been doing a fair ammount of arexx, and I really like think it is a neat language
19.57.34 #       <HammerD> kinners
19.58.05 #       <Kinners> HammerD: Because the company I work for uses Scala, and sometime it won't be possible to buy new Amigas (we actually buy second hand 1200's sometimes), and Scala IC500 is very old
19.59.09 #       <HammerD> ok
20.02.55 #       <Kinners> Womble: Just thought of a question.  In C, if you have 'STRPTR text = "INFO: bla bla bla";' is this valid? - 'if ( *(ULONG *) text == 'INFO') ...'
20.09.54 #       <Womble> Not really
20.10.25 #       <Womble> It's certainly not portable
20.11.26 #       <Womble> It may well work on a certain compiler on a certain architecture, but that's all that can be said. I think the ANSI C standard probably says that the behaviour of that code is 'undefined'.
20.11.35 #       <Kinners> hmm ok, thanks
20.12.03 #       <Womble> It's a pain to make loads of strncmp calls for stuff like this, but it's really the only way.
20.12.27 #       <Womble> Some compilers (e.g. GNU C) can in-line such calls for you as an optimisation, so it's not bad.
20.13.45 #       <Kinners> Yes, I use vbcc.  I don't know how well it compares with GNU C, but it can inline stuff

21.32.58 #       <Seed> Hi
21.33.04 #       <TA> hey Seed 
21.33.07 #       <Commando_> ta: oh, then you are in for a suprise ;-)
21.33.20 #       <Seed> Hello TA
21.33.28 #       <TA> good, I like surprises.
21.35.47 #       <TA> checked again, no mail from Bill. Now my feelings are hurt.  :)
21.36.00 #       <Seed> Bill? :)
21.36.01 #       <Commando_> ta: he was supposed to send it to you...
21.36.11 #       <Commando_> ta: oh, and can i officially join team amiga?  
21.36.11 #       <TA> Commando_: You just missed Alan Crandall BTW.
21.36.29 #       <Commando_> ta: damn!  i wanted to say hi.
21.36.46 #       <TA> Commando_: You already have. And thanks for helping at Amiwest.
21.36.48 #       <Commando_> ta: is his computer working yet?
21.37.05 #       <Commando_> ta: ok, cool... well, i am going to get you some BIG PR ... 
21.37.21 #       <TA> Commando_: He said he was piecing it back together ... :) I feel sorry for him after that clown waiter unplugged him while it was running.
21.37.52 #       <TA> Commando_: You aren't gonna blow up that damn hotel are you?  :)
21.38.03 #       <Commando_> TA: no .. not planing yet..
21.38.14 #       <Commando_> TA: uhmm... UGN is the next event.
21.38.35 #       <Commando_> TA: NOT UGN.
21.38.37 #       <TA> hahaha, those guys/gals had that Deer in the headlight look the whole time all us Amigan's were there.
21.38.38 #       <Commando_> TA: MAE ;-)
21.38.55 #       <Commando_> TA: we will propose to work with UGN... 
21.39.04 #       <TA> Commando_: Yeppers, Mae. I am trying to get enough cash together to get there.
21.39.31 #       <TA> Commando_: That is supposed to be the plan after our conference at Amiwest.
21.39.47 #       <Commando_> ta: cool... because you will like it there... we propose a UGN + TA joint effort to do something very special ... something which we should keep secret .... 
21.40.21 #       <TA> Commando_: Kidnap Bill Gates and make him watch the Amiga do what he couldn't do?
21.41.10 #       <Commando_> ta: hahah.. no .. aww fuck .. if bill bosari hasn't gotten off his fucking ass and mailed you, i think i'll just priv msg the damn thing... and act suprised when he mails you

21.41.48 #       <Seed> Hi AmigaNUKE
21.41.53 #       <AmigaNUKE> Hi Seed.
21.41.54 #       <TA> hey Nuke
21.42.16 #       <AmigaNUKE> This is interesting.  Amazing what you can find by reading newsletters.  :)
21.44.53 #       <TA> what did ya find Nuke?
21.45.27 #       <AmigaNUKE> This... this network... the Official Team AMIGA IRC site.
21.45.30 #       <AmigaNUKE> :)
21.45.45 #       <TA> ahhh ... yes, it was really busy earlier.
21.45.45 #       <Seed> AmigaNUKE :)
21.46.05 #       <Seed> TA: how many came?
21.46.22 #       <TA> about 20 earlier I think.
21.46.33 #       <TA> 15-20 anyways.
21.46.34 #       <Seed> TA: I was here when the channel was 1 hour old :) there were 20 or so. Did it get bigger after?
21.46.47 #       <TA> not while I was here.
21.47.01 #       <TA> But that is good for a new deal springing up.

21.47.19 #       <AmigaNUKE> Hi TA.  :)
21.47.34 #       <TA> heh!
21.48.32 #       <TA> and meet Womble from the JMS and TB from the UGN too.
21.50.42 #       <AmigaNUKE> So... anyone have their Amigas set up as a web server?  (http daemon)
21.51.10 #       <Womble> I don't see the point
21.51.14 Quit    TB (:Ping timeout for TB[p5-max6.chc.ihug.co.nz])
21.51.22 #       <Womble> Run servers on a server OS...
21.52.09 #       <Womble> AmigaOS is great for personal stuff, but as a server it just doesn't cut it
21.52.40 #       <Commando_> oh yes, an amiga makes a great internet server..
21.52.51 #       <AmigaNUKE> What I'm talking about is the httpd stuff for AmTCP or MiamiTCP.
21.52.54 #       <Commando_> i've written most of my server software in ARexx though..
21.52.54 #       <Womble> That said, I suppose it may be useful for testing if it's what you've got
21.53.03 #       <Commando_> ARexxWebServer, etc.
21.53.19 #       <Commando_> ReXXMaiL -- hotmail server for the amiga
21.53.21 #       <AmigaNUKE> Ah.  The only one I saw on AmiNet was GAWD.lha.
21.53.27 #       <Commando_> RexxProxy -- ARexx proxy
21.53.35 #       <Womble> There's Apache for AmigaOS
21.53.36 #       <Commando_> AWS is a good web server too
21.53.44 #       <AmigaNUKE> What's Apache?
21.53.53 #       <Commando_> ARexxWebServer is only a few kilobytes though .. 
21.54.07 #       <Womble> Apache is the most popular web server on the Internet, and quite flexible
21.54.12 #       * AmigaNUKE nods.  That's about the size of the GAWD server.
21.54.33 #       <Seed> AmigaNUKE: try Apache. It's harder to set up, but the best
21.54.36 #       <Womble> It's meant for Unix but it's been ported to NT and AmigaOs
21.54.46 #       <Womble> It'll be slower than the simpler ones though
21.54.52 #       <Womble> (probably)
21.55.04 #       <Commando_> amiganuke: imho, amigas do a very nice job as internet servers..
21.55.14 #       <Commando_> amiganuke: not to mention the great security... 
21.55.19 #       <Womble> Commando_: For what sort of volume
21.55.25 #       <Commando_> amiganuke: just be careful with a 28.8 connection..
21.55.28 #       <Seed> Security is an issue, yes
21.55.37 #       <Commando_> womble: any volume really, just don't do it on a 28.8 for god's sake
21.55.38 #       <AmigaNUKE> My ftp server is pretty neat.  Impressed some of the local PeeCee users.
21.56.02 #       <Womble> Commando_: No, really, what sort of web or mail load can you handle on an Amiga?
21.56.13 #       <Seed> AmigaNUKE: what do you use for FTP?
21.56.30 #       <Commando_> womble: not really?!  what makes the amiga any different?  its freebsd code for god's sake
21.56.31 #       <AmigaNUKE> Let me find out the right name...
21.56.51 #       <AmigaNUKE> wu-ftpd
21.56.53 #       <Commando_> womble: it can handle the load approprate for your CPU and connection speed
21.57.11 #       <AmigaNUKE> I've been having an interesting time trying to configure it though.
21.57.15 #       <Commando_> i run ftp, telnet, smtp, httpd, rexxmail, rexxproxy, rexxinternetdevice, rexxmessageboard, popd, several muds, etc.
21.57.20 #       <Womble> Commando_: Well, it doesn't schedule disk access or cache data blocks, for one thing
21.57.37 #       <Commando_> womble: you can write your software accordingly... 
21.57.57 #       <Womble> Commando_: But you said your were using BSD code. Make your mind up.
21.58.03 #       <Commando_> womble: i, personally, have written ALL of my internet software, with the acception of TelnetD and ftpd
21.58.03 #       <Womble> s/your/you/
21.58.22 #       <Commando_> womble: dumbass, miami and AmiTCP ARE FreeBSD code!!
21.58.34 #       <Womble> Commando_: No, they are not.
21.58.42 #       <Seed> Miami?? :)
21.59.02 #       <Commando_> womble: YES THEY ARE. 
21.59.04 #       <Womble> Commando_: They are based on 4.2BSD and 4.4BSD resp. Not FreeBSD. And don't call me dumbass.
21.59.11 #       <AmigaNUKE> Eeek.  I did't mean to start an argument.
21.59.29 #       <Commando_> womble: BSD/FreeBSD ... pretty much the same.... they all have very similar tcp/ip cores.
21.59.33 #       <AmigaNUKE> Deep breaths, everyone.  ;)
21.59.40 #       <Seed> :)
21.59.51 #       <Womble> And... *relax*.
22.00.11 #       * AmigaNUKE chuckles.
22.00.15 #       <Commando_> womble: and maybe you should actually attempt heavy server operations and proper software before you start degrading the amiga's networking abillities.. 
22.00.16 #       <Womble> Commando_: Oh, and swap the 4.2 and 4.4.
22.00.27 #       <Commando_> womble: they all have pretty much the same core.
22.01.12 #       <Womble> Commando_: Uh-huh. Well, the Amiga's scheduling is not really what you want for a multi-user system, which is what a networked server effectively is.
22.02.18 #       <Commando_> womble: if you use proper software, you can handle that scheduling via binding the socket.... handle/cache all disk access or do whatever..
22.02.57 #       <Commando_> womble: of course, you are goignn to have to write your own software.. 
22.03.06 #       <Commando_> womble: i have yet to see true networked server software
22.03.11 #       <Womble> Commando_: It also lacks multi-user privilege stuff, so any server bug becomes a serious security risk.
22.03.31 #       <Commando_> womble: i avoid bugs to begin with .... ;-)  
22.03.44 #       <Womble> Commando_: Right, you have to write your own stuff from scratch, and reinvent the wheel to do stuff that the OS probably ought to do. So it's not a good server OS.
22.03.46 #       <Commando_> womble: oh, speaking of which, doesn't multiuser file system solve any of those problems?
22.03.48 #       <AmigaNUKE> I've seen lots of "Multi-user" stuff, but I haven't bothered with it yet.
22.04.05 #       <Commando_> womble: writing a httpd server is reinventing the wheel?! 
22.04.07 #       <Womble> Commando_: Not really.
22.04.36 #       <Womble> Commando_: I mean, implementing disk caching stuff in each of your own programs
22.04.50 #       <Commando_> womble: as long as you don't put holes into software, the amiga makes an excelent server, with the exception of giving someone DIRECT shell access.
22.04.57 #       <Womble> Commando_: And of course you can never do as well as a system-wide disk cache that makes use of otherwise free memory
22.05.01 #       <Commando_> womble: Disk caching isn't that hard.. 
22.05.18 #       <Commando_> womble: and there are programs which do that at the AmigaDOS level
22.05.44 #       <Womble> Commando_: Right, so you have to apply a load of patches to the OS.
22.05.58 #       <Womble> Commando_: You're still saying it's just fine as a server OS?
22.06.04 #       <Commando_> womble: one simple disk caching "patch" ... 
22.06.15 #       <Commando_> womble: i used it for my BBS, and had a massive performance increase.
22.06.18 #       <Commando_> womble: yes, i am still saying.
22.06.22 #       <TA> Is NT really that much better?
22.06.22 #       <Womble> Commando_: And multi-user, and maybe Executive to sort out the scheduler....
22.06.53 #       <Womble> Since NT runs on much faster hardware, in reality I think it probably is.
22.07.05 #       <Commando_> womble: yes, it does... 
22.07.17 #       <Commando_> womble: intel is quite fast (^)
22.07.29 #       <Womble> I would prefer to use Linux or maybe FreeBSD for an Internet server though.
22.07.33 #       <TA> but still has security issues.
22.07.46 #       <Commando_> womble: however, it makes a good internet server still.. of course, i am NOT talking about runninng a T3 into it, nor it being ann ISP
22.07.52 #       <Womble> Right, security and NT don't really go together
22.08.19 #       <Commando_> womble: i have been very  happy with my system performance ... 
22.08.28 #       <Womble> Commando_: Well, it'll do, if it's what you've got.
22.08.51 #       <Commando_> womble: i don't have 10 million hits a day..
22.09.04 #       <Womble> Commando_: I'd be interested to see what sort of real throughput you could get. perhaps you could test it under AmigaOS and then udner Linux/m68k for comparison?
22.09.21 #       <Commando_> womble: with similar processing speeds, sure.
22.09.42 #       <Commando_> womble: oh, m68k i see
22.09.49 #       <Commando_> womble: well, that would really be a fun test.. 
22.09.54 #       <Commando_> i gotta go take a shower, brb.
22.10.00 #       <Womble> Seeya
22.10.10 #       <Womble> Phew, it's 6am here
22.10.16 #       <Womble> Still haven't finished reading news
22.10.30 #       <TA> yeah, midnite here at least.
22.10.51 #       <Commando_> its 10pm here
22.10.58 #       <TA> Womble: Planning a visit to the states?
22.11.19 #       <TA> damn, my wolf puppy is gnawing on my foot.
22.12.01 #       <TA> let me get a shoe on before she maims me ... :)
22.12.03 #       <AmigaNUKE> Hehehe... better feed him TA.  :)
22.12.11 #       <AmigaNUKE> er, she.
22.12.16 #       <AmigaNUKE> her... 
22.12.24 #       * AmigaNUKE laughs.
22.12.32 #       <TA> back.
22.12.59 #       <TA> I got this hard rubber thuing that is guaranteed that no dog can bite into it. She has teeth marks all over it.
22.13.35 #       <TA> Shaped like a cone. She bit the nipple end off the first nite, one bite it was gone.
22.14.07 #       <Seed> You have the wrong animal :)
22.14.10 #       <Womble> TA: A visit to the US, when I have some money from a job
22.14.39 #       <TA> Seed: But she is very loving. More so than a dog (have two of those as well).
22.15.02 #       <Womble> TA: Had my second interview at a place in London today. There are now three companies I'm expecting answers from early next week.
22.15.08 #       <Womble> TA: That is, offers or rejections.
22.15.14 #       <TA> Womble: Well, I hope ya get a good one so you can visit Texas.
22.15.32 #       <Seed> TA: Dogs are the best :)
22.15.35 #       <TA> Womble: Good show! and Good Luck!
22.16.16 #       <TA> Seed: Always had dogs. Got a chance to get this half wolf, half german shepherd and she is really beuatiful.
22.17.12 #       <Seed> TA: can't argue with that :)
22.17.34 #       <TA> But, she likes to sleep on MY pillow. We usually have a fight over who gets the bed.
22.17.57 #       <Seed> Ta: ohh.. this is beginning to sound sad ;)
22.18.44 #       <TA> Seed: No, I usually win but she is still a pup too.  :)
22.19.25 #       <Seed> Well, you can't argue with her. That's her advantage :)
22.19.54 #       <TA> So far she hasn't really bitten me, but she did put 4 fang marks in the wifes leg right at the knee.
22.20.46 #       <AmigaNUKE> Oh.  I heard of something called "Dashboard."  Anyone know what that does exactly?
22.20.46 #       <TA> she was nipping at the wife's feet as she was walking across the room. The wife acted like she was going to kick at her to chase her off and CHOMOP!
22.21.28 #       <TA> AmigaNUKE: That is part of Executive that basically tells you what it is monitoring. You can set iyt to monitor all sports of things inside Executive.
22.21.53 #       * AmigaNUKE nods.
22.21.56 #       <AmigaNUKE> Okie.
22.21.59 #       <TA> the typing tutor will be here shortly.
22.22.06 #       <TA> :)
22.22.10 #       <AmigaNUKE> Hehehe.
22.22.28 #       <TA> I type better when the wolf isn't eating my feet off.
22.23.01 #       <Seed> Let her type.. we'll see what she has to say about the Amiga
22.23.45 #       <TA> heh! If she can't gnaw on it she isn't interested. And she better NOT gnaw on my amiga!  :)
22.24.10 #       <Seed> I have a few spare Amigas. but no animals here :)
22.24.38 #       <TA> she had gnawed away on a keyboard under my computer desk so I gave it to Cryto here in the channel about a month ago.
22.24.48 #       <TA> Seed: Send her one to eat ... :)
22.24.57 #       <TA> maybe she'll leave my feet alone.
22.25.44 #       <TA> let me tend to her. I'll try to be back a little later ...
22.25.53 #       <Seed> see ya
