05.07.16 #       <Rocambole> hello
05.10.58 #       <Wolfman> I'm just testing.. :)   I'm feeding in all servers into AmIRC :)

05.16.44 #       <Wolfman> Rocambole: Are you the boss here?
05.17.17 #       <Rocambole> nope, I'm just the organiser of the help team
05.17.55 #       <Wolfman> ok..  What is this channel about?  Helping beginners only or anything at all?
05.18.23 #       <Rocambole> it's for all kind of help
05.19.11 #       <Wolfman> ok that's nice to hear :)   hmm  I can't think of anything to ask now ;)   I'll have to come back to ya for that...
05.19.18 #       <Rocambole> beginners help, software help, hardware help,developers help
05.19.48 #       <Wolfman> ahh..   hmm  Do you know anything about Micronik 1500 Z3?
05.20.20 #       <Rocambole> no, not more than I've read 
05.21.37 #       <Wolfman> ok..  I've had big trouble with it and the CyberStorm060 mk3 :(  I had to send the whole thing back for repair/check..  They didn't know what the fault was, was strange they alsp said :(
05.21.55 #       <Wolfman> alsp=also
05.22.45 #       <Rocambole> I have the RBM Towerhawk, in which I put my A1200, and it works very well
05.23.23 #       <Rocambole> it's a DIY tower
05.23.44 #       <Rocambole> DIY=Do it yourself
05.24.17 #       <Wolfman> Yes I know about that one..  I bought mine because of the ZorroIII & A4000 compatible bus :)
05.24.35 #       <Rocambole> what kind of trouble did you have with the micronic?
05.25.16 #       <Rocambole> well, there are very few ZIII card avaiable
05.26.25 #       <Wolfman> The bus speed to the IDE and AGA was VEEEERY slow..  And it locked the whole computer almost instantly at every boot :(
05.26.58 #       <Wolfman> Graphic cards :)   but the A4000 bus was the real cause for my purchase
05.29.16 #       <Rocambole> hmmm.....could be a conflict with CyberStorm, have you asked P5?
05.31.04 #       <Wolfman> nope...  They said they'd handle that contact from now..   Micronik's busboard has an jumper for the mk3 card so it should not be a problem..   The guy I talked to thought it might be faulty SIMMs..
05.32.19 #       <Rocambole> ok
05.33.47 #       <Wolfman> If there was something wrong which they couldn't find out they will send me a whole new tower :)))
05.34.12 #       <Rocambole> aaahhhh....that is great service :)
05.35.27 #       <Wolfman> Yes it sure is...   But then again I paid ALOT of money for it to...   The 030 A1200 I'm running now sucks real badly..  030's are sooo slow!
05.37.06 #       <Rocambole> well, not the fastest in the world :)
05.38.49 #       <Wolfman> hehe  That's so true..    060's are quite fast though, on AmigaOS anyway!
05.39.25 #       <Wolfman> A 100MHz 060 would kick some PC ass :)
05.41.37 #       <Rocambole> :)  I'm using a 166 MHz pc at work, but I think my miggy is just as fast
05.41.52 #       <Rocambole> due to win95
05.42.10 #       <Wolfman> I know a guy that uses a 75MHz crystal on his CS060mk2 card..   He said that only P-II beat his speed :)
05.43.03 #       <Rocambole> :)
05.44.19 #       <Wolfman> And that's CPU speed.. Not real life speed :)  Where Windows sucks the life out of the computer ;)     My brother has an P-II 300 and I must admit that Windows behaves really well on that setup..
05.45.57 #       <Rocambole> I like the Amiga way much better than the win95
05.46.17 #       <Rocambole> (m$)
05.47.18 #       <Wolfman> Me too :)   That's why I paid 1200-1300£ for my new computer :)
05.47.54 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
05.48.06 #       <Wolfman> that's about 1800-1900 US$ I think :)

09.30.26 #       <WarNPeace> Nope

09.36.53 #       <WarNPeace> I reported the bug to owagner, but got no reply
09.36.55 #       <Ogge> there is?
09.36.57 #       <WarNPeace> it's a buffer overflow
09.37.10 #       <Ogge> hmm.. didn't know that.. 
09.37.15 #       <WarNPeace> AmIRC isn't the only one that dies from it
09.37.23 #       <Ogge> sounds dangerous.. 
09.37.26 #       <WarNPeace> Older Versions of BitchX  die too
09.37.32 #       <WarNPeace> and CNetIRC as well
09.37.33 #       <Rocambole> I was lossing contact with network a lot of times last night

09.37.46 #       <WarNPeace> If you get hit with this, you will know it...
09.37.54 #       <WarNPeace> They will flood you in channel

09.39.04 #       <Ogge> hmmm.. sounds like i have to fix myself a protection against that type of flood..
09.39.05 #       <WarNPeace> I spend more time patching systems than actually IRC'n :)

09.39.25 #       <WarNPeace> Kuang11 works...
09.39.36 #       <WarNPeace> It will stop it if you have it set to liek a threshold of 3
09.39.45 #       <Rocambole> I have

09.40.02 #       <WarNPeace> but those using stock AmIRC 2.0 are in danger
09.40.18 #       <WarNPeace> even the Amiga compile of Dancer is vulnerable
09.40.41 #       <WarNPeace> I am going to have to look into that and see if I can fix it.....
09.40.54 #       <WarNPeace> At least we have the source to Dancer and can fix problems like that.
09.41.02 #       <Rocambole> could kuang11 protect it?
09.41.38 #       <WarNPeace> no arexx interface on Dancer...   no flood threshold either...  What needs to be done is just the buffer extended
09.41.52 #       <WarNPeace> the AmIRC input buffer is like 223 characters.
09.42.02 #       <WarNPeace> while mIRC can output 300 on one line
09.42.10 #       <Rocambole> oh
09.42.20 #       <WarNPeace> AmIRC would wrap to the next line
09.42.25 #       <WarNPeace> and b00m
09.46.10 #       <Ogge> hmm.. where did i put my notes on redfox.. can't continue program before i finds em :(

11.30.29 #       <Comrade> why was this network choosen ?
11.30.35 #       <X_Work> AA:Sorry but can u name some tasks?
11.30.48 #       <AAlley> X: You sould see this:) 196MB of 8ns sdram helps.
11.31.17 #       <AAlley> It displays pictures MUCH faster. I use a 4MB BMP for a backdrop.
11.31.45 #       <X_Work> AA:Ive seen it run on SGI thanks, and it DIDNT match my old A 500 at some things let alone touch my A4000
11.31.54 #       <AAlley> It unarcs at the same speed. Slightl;y slower to arc files.
11.32.02 #       <[Gemini]> ohh... sombody at the door... brb
11.32.06 #       <Comrade> because I'm likely to be consistantly ignored ? :)
11.32.07 #       <AAlley> You need to get the latest version.

11.32.25 #       <X_Work> AAlley:WOW if you are right I WILL GET IT NOW:)
11.32.37 #       <AAlley> Sounds like you were using v0.6.9

11.32.55 #       <Comrade> :D
11.32.56 #       <Ogge> AA, what version is available now?
11.33.00 #       <AAlley> Vast spped improvements since then, and sound plays at full speed.
11.33.02 #       <X_Work> Comrade:because this network is fast, its free, its controlled, and it doesnt break when u put more than 500 peopl eon it;)
11.33.13 #       <AAlley> v0.7.5b
11.33.14 #       <Comrade> good
11.33.23 #       <Classylady> hehehe
11.33.30 #       <X_Work> AA:no I stopped at .7 revision 2 b or something, the one that destroyed the win registry
11.33.34 #       <Ogge> ok.. then it have changed since i tried 0.6.9

11.35.16 #       <AAlley> ANd make sure you uncheck 24 bit addressing.
11.35.28 #       <X_Work> AAlley:wow Im glad we spoke, of course I dont use a hardfile, then it has to emulate more shit
11.35.40 #       <X_Work> Aalley:well Id rather not run in A500 mode;)

11.36.23 #       <AAlley> However: the latest version of SS (3.9) has better handlking of hardfiles. SS now runs faster in UAE than on my 1200, and on a 15 bit screen.

11.42.27 #       <Dave_C> bbl
11.42.48 #       <AAlley> Yoshi: Those were the first commercial, home use drives. The first Borroughs drives were less than 1MB. I saw them in the 60's
11.43.01 Quit    YM0US (:Client exiting)
11.43.03 #       <Arvid> Yoshi: in 1964, when I was learning Fortran II on an IBM 1620, the techs installed a removeable disk pack on the 1620 .. 2.5 megabytes per pack and the pack was 14-inche diamter and six inches high
11.43.41 #       <Yoshi2> AAlley, Arvid: That was way before I was born, so all I know is what I read in mags. :)
11.43.46 #       <Arvid> heh
11.44.29 #       <AAlley> The Booroughs drive I referred to was non removeable, single platter, 10 tracks, with ten fixed heads. Big as a dishwasher.
11.44.52 #       <Arvid> Yoshi: and I know a fellow who, to this day, does not believe data is properly backed up unless it is backed up to 8-inch floppies
11.45.06 #       <AAlley> Pity the fool
11.45.46 #       <Arvid> AAlley: I used to be around a Burroughs 4700 with a single 10-meg HD.. a 24-inch single platter, open to the air.
11.45.47 #       <Rocambole> AAlley: the first hard disk I worked with was a phoenix with 1 removeable and 3 fixed disks, with a total of 84 MB
11.45.48 #       * Ogge prefers to use a 4mm DAT for his backups.. 
11.46.29 #       <AAlley> I used to work on those drives:) We used them in Univac mainframes.
11.46.31 #       * [Gemini] havent got any other means of backup the disk, ther4 i never take backups
11.46.33 #       <Rocambole> AAlley: must have been 16" in dia :)
11.46.44 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: Like the old story of people putting more trust in 1.44 MB formatted drives than 1.76 MB formatted Amiga ones, "because the PC drive has more remaining free space to put the data should some parts of the disk be defective"
11.47.25 #       <Arvid> Yoshi: and the people have so much more free space in their brains when they use clone computers
11.47.29 #       <AAlley> Control Data made those 84MB removeable packs.
11.48.00 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
11.48.17 #       <Rocambole> AAlley: it was used with a Wang computer
11.48.36 #       <AAlley> The fgixed platter provided tracking reference for the heads.
11.48.52 #       <Rocambole> AAlley: yes
11.48.52 #       <AAlley> CD sold them to nearly everyone:)
11.49.18 #       <AAlley> Man, that brings back the memories: 10-15 service calls in a day:)
11.49.18 #       <Rocambole> AAlley: quite heavy monster :))
11.49.37 #       <AAlley> Yes, I remember manhandling the drives.
11.49.39 #       <Arvid> AAlley: on one machine?
11.49.53 #       <Rocambole> AAlley: yes
11.49.55 #       <AAlley> Arvid: explain
11.50.05 #       <Arvid> AAlley: on one machine? I mean 10-15 calls/day ... that is job security
11.50.30 #       <AAlley> No. 1015 calls to different customers, in the LA area.
11.50.36 #       <Arvid> oh

21.32.54 #       <Dave_C> I met him online when he was like 14
21.33.18 #       <Dave_C> He was running The United Federation of Planets BBS
21.33.19 #       <TA> He has some homebrewed electrical stuff that he plugged up to Alanwall's computer. It scared us all to see this bundle of wires and stuff hanging out ... :)
21.33.41 #       <Dave_C> yeah, and then someone unplugged the computer and killed the HD
21.34.06 #       <TA> Alan had this real worried look in his face every time Casey would say "ok, stand back, I'm gonna try something ..."
21.34.08 #       <Dave_C> Alan mentioned that the other day
21.34.16 #       <TA> :)
21.34.21 #       <Dave_C> oh... check out http://www.jms.org/
21.34.28 #       <TA> I think he was doing it to scare alan. It was hilarious.
21.34.47 #       <TA> yeah, I forwarded yoru note to rlv and Gio about their web site?
21.35.23 #       <TA> Casey can listen and type at the same time ... about 80 wpm. I was dearly impressed with his skills.
21.35.30 #       <Dave_C> I hope it was just a screwup on a re-driect link or something
21.35.53 #       <TA> It may have been hacked.

21.41.31 #       <TA> Mario said that Fabian was upset about us starting a help channel and not giving the UGN a chance to do it.
21.42.11 #       <TA> He thought, apparently, that the UGN was better suited to do it than us?
21.42.25 #       <Dave_C> Do they think they have a monopoly on our ideas?
21.42.43 #       <TA> He hasn't said a word to me like that so I don't know what actually was said?
