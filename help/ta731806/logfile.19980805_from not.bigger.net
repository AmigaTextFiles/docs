11.02.36 #       <Dave_C> I'm not paying much attention to it...
11.02.43 #       <lostman> dave_C: I want to see Napalm, that looks to be cool game.
11.02.51 #       <Merko> lostman: Quake probably.
11.02.51 #       <Dave_C> I just see mail-task gating it to the subboard.
11.03.46 #       <Merko> lostman: Since Quake is far too slow to be playable on 68k, a PPC port would be 'a rather good idea' to put it mildly.. well.. at least there are illegal versions which work well. ;D
11.04.26 #       <lostman> maybe thats the reason
11.04.33 #       <Dave_C> <nod>
11.04.50 #       <Merko> lostman: Yeah, right.. I only bought their game, so now I'm killing them by playing it too?
11.05.44 #       <Dave_C> he means the pirated stuff that makes developers not want to do anything else for a market that would rather pirate than buy
11.05.56 #       <Merko> (well actually I'm not playing it, but at least I COULD)
11.06.34 #       <Merko> Dave_C: I bought it, because of the promised PPC version. When I ordered it, the PPC version was a promise, it would eventually come in the box.
11.08.32 #       <Dave_C> As a commercial software betatester, Ihave to appreciate the developers viewpoint...
11.09.32 #       <Dave_C> if betas are pirated and hacked, it spoils their chances of paying their programmers, or even sometimes seeing the product to market.
11.10.05 #       <X_Busy> the quake guys are NOT ones to speak about piracy...
11.10.21 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Sure. I'm not for picacy in general..
11.10.33 #       * X_Busy will state that to click boom ON the record if they pretend to be ho.lier than thou...
11.10.34 #       <Dave_C> We have even withheld updates to the Demo due to a leak.

11.12.03 #       <Merko> X_Busy: No, it was Max.
11.12.21 #       <X_Busy> Merko:Istn Zer)`s real name Max?
11.12.56 #       <Merko> X_Busy: No idea.. he is known under that nick in the scene also anyway.. and he has that nick on IRC..
11.14.50 #       <Merko> Anyway.. I once sent some programming tips to clickboom about quake, and they resent it to the anonymous coder, who sent it back to them, who sent it to me.. quite ridiculous! ;)
11.15.52 #       <X_Busy> Merko:Anonymous my ass!
11.16.08 #       <Merko> X_Busy: Well, they won't tell/admit who he is.
11.16.14 #       <X_Busy> Dave hangs out on Amiga_Wares he might know who it is?
11.16.26 #       <X_Busy> Merko:Yeah well he is DEFINATELY DC!
11.17.15 #       <X_Busy> Merko:they are using illegal code, ported without permission...  It is irrelevant that they were later granted permission
11.17.41 #       <Merko> X_Busy: resourcing the code shows that it has the same horrible mapping loops, that no 2 people would create the same way.. sooo.. ;D
11.17.53 #       <X_Busy> You can`t be anti pitacy and then use software pirates to make ur program...
11.17.54 Quit    Arvid (:Exciting? ME?)
11.18.06 #       <Merko> X_Busy: Sure, they have proven you can.
11.18.20 #       <X_Busy> Merko:hehe well said;)
11.19.15 #       <X_Busy> Merko:whats funny is they pretend that noone knows the truth about the quake sources
11.19.18 #       <Merko> But.. I'm not going to play holier than holy and refuse playing a game that I already bought, only because I'm using an exe derived from illegal code, and which hasn't (yet?) been approved by them..
11.19.53 #       <X_Busy> Merko:Yes but your not making money from it;)  So I dont see anything really wrong;)
11.20.03 #       <X_Busy> Especially as u paid for it;)
11.20.50 #       <Merko> X_Busy: I'm not making any money, and I'm not stealing any money from them either.. actually my view about piracy is that piracy doesn't kill, buying software helps!

11.21.33 #       * Dave_C looks up
11.21.53 #       * Dave_C watches for a flying white clapboard house
11.22.21 #       <Merko> But.. it seems to be a common belief still that people buy software because they can't find pirated versions.. yeah, right!
11.23.36 #       <Dave_C> I know ppl who would only pirate software no longer available commercially in any form.
11.23.49 #       <Dave_C> but that's still wrong.

11.24.51 #       <X_Busy> DAve:its common bullshit spread by monopolies, this is off the record but PIRACY HELPS systems:(
11.25.16 #       <Dave_C> X: at times, you are right, like how piracy started Microsoft.
11.25.34 #       <X_Busy> Dave:if it wasnt for Piracy, M$ wouldnt be in the dominant position it is now, how do you really think they got so many users using their shitty MS windows program?
11.26.06 #       <Merko> Dave_C: I had pirate versions already of most programs I own.. and now that I have a bit more money than when I was a kid, I don't use a lot of pirated software. But I can't say using pirated software makes me feel bad in any way..
11.26.07 #       <X_Busy> Dave:yes my friend exactly, AT TIMES;)  its not a general rule that piracy helps, it can kill in many cases
11.26.11 #       <Dave_C> If piracy hadn't spread Bill Gates original Atlair BASIC interpretter, no one would know who the little dweeb is.
11.27.04 #       <Dave_C> Altair I mean
11.27.11 #       <X_Busy> Dave:David pleasance or Kelly Sumner came over to cyprus with pirated software!

11.27.32 #       <Dave_C> his BASIC was thrown out on the early internet, and a star was born
11.27.35 #       <X_Busy> Who was at CBM when Zool was out?

11.30.03 #       <Merko> Well, piracy can kill bad programs or games imho, but I doubt it can kill a good program.. unless the author makes some really stupid move.
11.36.01 #       <Dave_C> But it can also help shore up security holes in a protection scheme too!

11.38.28 #       <Rocambole> Hello all
11.38.36 #       <Dave_C> Depends on the type of protection.
11.39.17 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Of course. But every form of protection is a hassle for the legitimate user, but once they are cracked.. the illegal version will be 'better'.
11.39.43 #       <Dave_C> only financially for the pirater
11.39.50 #       <Dave_C> not for the developer.
11.40.05 #       <Rocambole> :)
11.40.08 #       <Merko> Dave_C: No. For the user, regardless of whether he paid or not.
11.40.09 #       <Dave_C> The demo I have for XDCC has a 7day keyfile...
11.40.35 #       <Dave_C> but otherwise is a fully funtional version of CNet/4.59
11.40.51 #       <Dave_C> buy the real key and you're good to go...

11.41.23 #       <Dave_C> He accepts cross-grades, and offeres discounts
11.41.47 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Demos are great.. I think they help a lot to make people buy software, unless they are senselessly restricted.. like some progs that have all the interesting functions disabled.. doh!
11.41.49 #       <Dave_C> He's even done payment deals in extreme cases.
11.42.10 #       <Dave_C> CNet4Demo is a fully functional CNet BBS!
11.42.19 #       <Dave_C> the key will time out after 7 days
11.42.44 #       <Merko> Dave_C: And after that you'll have to change the system clock? ;D
11.42.54 #       <Dave_C> If you don't know whether you like running a BBS within a week, you shouldn't be running one.
11.43.17 #       <Dave_C> Or go thru all the installation stuff again and again
11.43.21 #       <Merko> Hmm. I think I'll have to register AmFTP soon.. it's something like my 178th day of 30 or something... quite a serious bug in that one. ;D

11.43.54 #       <Dave_C> but try getting international financial institutions to AGREE on something...
11.43.58 #       <Dave_C> hehehe
11.44.03 #       <Merko> Rocambole: Yes.. it would definately help! It's a LOT easier, of course not everyone have a card and internet access, but for us who do it is a big help.
11.44.09 #       <Dave_C> you'd have a better chance of reforming DC
11.44.25 #       <Rocambole> Dave_C: :))  I have used First Virtual some, but not many uses it
11.45.48 #       * Dave_C tends to prefer COD.
11.45.59 #       <Rocambole> the reason that many don't pay shareware fees is the trouble to send mony by snailmail (go to bank for exchange etc)
11.46.11 #       <Dave_C> if a company won't ship COD, odd are they don't HAVE the product and are just drop-shippers

12.15.44 #       <Ogge> sack, should be any problem.. just set one of the HD's to master and the other to slave
12.15.47 #       <AAlley> Hey Arc
12.16.36 #       <Sackbut> i didn't think so Ogge, but that certainly will negate the use the ultra wide scsi on the ppc board, huh?
12.17.19 #       <aRCLiGHT> Hay AAlley
12.18.39 #       <Ogge> sack, negate? don't know that word.. but using two _IDE drives have nothing to do with the SCSI.. if i'm right u should be able to use 2-4 IDE and up to 7 scsi units on the amiga
12.19.26 #       <Dave_C> Cry: The person needing MacPPP/SS help was kernel
12.19.28 #       <Cryto> Ogge: Need to get an IDE controller tho..
12.19.46 #       <HMetal> Ogge: Try putting a CD burner on the primary IDE channel along with a fast HD..  Guaranteed you'll have many coasters as a result.
12.19.56 #       <Merko> 7? Can't you use 15 with UWscsi? (Hey, I don't know..) Plus more if you have several scsi or IDE interfaces of course. :)
12.19.56 #       <Ogge> cryto, thats true.. but u can run two ide units straight of the ide port in both A4000 and A1200
12.20.03 #       <Cryto> Dave_C: Ok..  Only thing is, I havent used MacPPP much.  Had it working a LONG time ago, so I will have to get freePPP and try that..
12.20.19 #       <Ogge> Hmetal, true.. u have to put the CD burner on the secondary as slave ;)
12.20.30 #       <HMetal> Ogge: Nope..
12.20.31 #       <Dave_C> err.. it was FreePPP he was having trouble with...
12.20.32 #       <Dave_C> my bad
12.20.46 #       <HMetal> I have my HDs on primary as master & slave and the CD-R on secondary as master..
12.20.48 #       <Sackbut> ok, I meant if I choose that route I won'tget the benefit ofthe performance boost that the ultra wide scsi interface would offer.  :-( 
12.21.26 #       <Ogge> Hmetal, same here.. but i have a ZIP drive as a slave on the secondary also

13.28.27 #       <Womble> That's exactly my point. That information should not have been news. It was completely pointless to leak it.
13.28.50 #       <Womble> s/port/re-implement/

13.29.16 #       <Womble> X_MaN: That's why I'm saying, it's done damage, and for no good reason.
13.29.24 #       <X_MaN>  I
13.29.25 #       <X_MaN> was hoping to release the information about the Programming Model
13.29.25 #       <X_MaN> working group to the ICOA, but was nervous because of the things we have
13.29.25 #       <X_MaN> discovered/"invented" being leaked out into the world at large. Now I am
13.29.25 #       <X_MaN> even more nervous
13.29.46 #       <X_MaN> That is from Matt Seargent who is working on the Java/Programming model Working group

13.30.36 #       <Dave_C> When I saw it, I thought it was kinda funny as it was the same thing Dr. Havemose talked about on IRC from Toronto

13.32.53 #       <Merko> Are you talking about the same 'leak' (=repost) that I've seen?
13.32.57 #       <X_MaN> yes
13.33.00 #       <Dave_C> yup
13.33.03 #       <X_MaN> Merko:exactly
13.33.10 #       <Dave_C> it was noting new to me
13.33.15 #       <Dave_C> nothing
13.33.29 #       <X_MaN> Dave:I doubt it was news to anyone
13.33.39 #       <Womble> The problem, as I see it, is that it was a verbatim copy of what Fleecy wrote on a closed list.
13.33.41 #       <Merko> Well, what is the bloody problem? Who would that harm, and how?
13.33.43 #       <Dave_C> It's the principle involved
13.34.10 #       <Merko> Womble: Closed list=ICOA list?
13.34.26 #       <Womble> Merko: Yes
13.34.30 #       <Dave_C> it's in the bylaws
13.34.41 #       <Dave_C> internal icoa communications
13.35.14 #       <Dave_C> as it was put, a 'gentleman's' NDA
13.35.26 #       <Dave_C> nothing signed, but a mutual agreement
13.35.50 #       <X_MaN> Merko:fleecy has SPECIFICALLY ASKED never to post those things, this is a DIRECT compromise of this request it is putting HIM in the shits
13.36.36 #       <Dave_C> irregardless of the content....
13.36.51 #       <Dave_C> which is why I didn't cross post it to fido...
13.36.55 #       <Merko> X_MaN: Ok.. well, then as I see it the problem isn't the leak, but that this means that someone broke the rules, and now everyone have to be more careful?
13.37.20 #       <Dave_C> I waited and when Gary joined in a hissy, I deleted it.
13.37.27 #       <Dave_C> Merko: Exactly
13.37.48 #       <Merko> X_MaN: Somehow, I don't see that as a big problem.. it was rather inevitable, maybe even a good thing that it was something harmless..
13.38.02 #       <X_MaN> Dave:I havent seen Gary step on toes yet, just fleecy, I stepped in personally asap to try and limit damage before it hurt the entire ICOA members
13.38.35 #       <Dave_C> I'm registered w/ ICOA, but not on the list...
13.38.39 #       <Dave_C> I don't need to be yet.
13.39.01 #       <X_MaN> Dave:thre are 5 lists, it takes a while to be added

13.40.06 #       <X_MaN> Merko:U realise how much information is now going to be withheld?  Matt Seargents Programmign model is no longer to be published!
13.40.11 #       <HMetal> Whoa.. What did I miss?
13.40.24 #       * HMetal = ZenMetal and Dave is an affiliate member..
13.40.39 #       <Merko> X_MaN: Why not?
13.41.38 #       <Merko> X_MaN: Has he planned to patent it, or what?!
13.42.56 #       <X_MaN> Merko:no as people are publishing work that is NOT for general viewing
13.43.46 #       <Merko> X_MaN: Right.. I don't understand what his motives are though.
13.44.45 #       <Merko> I mean.. the ICOA list is AFAIK big enough so that you can't expect things posted there to be really secret..
13.45.00 #       <X_MaN> Merko:whyever not?
13.45.10 #       <X_MaN> MerkoLthe ICOA lists are ONLY ICOA members!
13.45.20 #       <Merko> X_MaN: Yes. How many
13.45.21 #       <X_MaN> if they cannot hold their mouthes shut then they may as well get lost
13.45.24 #       <Merko> ?
13.46.03 #       <HMetal> I have much info, being an ICOA member, but have never leaked anything..  It's stupid to do so..  You're just hurting your own platform-to-be
13.46.24 #       <HMetal> ..no matter how insignificant the information.
13.46.32 #       <Petah> HMetal: So how do you apply for membership then?
13.46.53 #       <HMetal> Petah: Visit the Web page...  apply for membership, wait for approval.
13.47.04 #       <HMetal> anyone have the URL handy?

13.47.22 #       <Merko> HMetal: I agree, but that's not the point.. I don't see how someone could expect a list as big as the ICOA list (well, I don't know the size of it of course but I guess over 50 people at least, right?).
13.47.32 #       <Petah> HMetal: Hm. Is membership free?
13.47.51 #       <Merko> HMetal: .. to be a safe place to post information that must remain secret to.
13.48.14 #       <HMetal> Petah: Membership to the basic list is free..   Focus groups, I believe, are included with a membership fee.
13.49.04 #       <HMetal> Merko: I would rather practice voluntary silence than be forced to sign an NDA..  So, on that basic premise, I watch my "Ps and Qs"
13.49.26 #       <Petah> HMetal: Okay. So this "basic list" you mentioned, what kinds of topics does it cover? "Top secret stuff" or "public" information?

13.49.51 #       <HMetal> Petah: My company, of course, has a commercial membership. So, I really can't say what a basic membership covers.

13.50.05 #       <Merko> HMetal: I don't doubt that.. I think it's the right thing to do, but I'm just saying that in a big enough group there *will* be leaks for different reasons.
13.50.05 #       <HMetal> Petah: Visit the Web page and all will be answered..
13.50.33 #       <HMetal> Merko: Then it's up to the ICOA to enforce rules and exclude those who "leak"

13.52.25 #       <Merko> Some people will leak because big companies pay them to.. we will never know of that. Others will leak because they feel the public should know. Sometimes I think that could be justified, maybe not in this group though. Others will leak because they think something is wrong, and they want to get opinion... etc..
13.52.36 #       <m0lder> hiya all..
13.53.09 #       <HMetal> Merko: In any case, how can you trust a "leak" ?  If it isn't from the horses mouth, so-to-speak, how do you even know it is real/legit/true?
13.53.13 #       <StG^sNTx> m0lder:)

13.53.25 #       <Merko> HMetal: You can't of course.
13.54.09 #       <HMetal> Merko: So, why bother even looking for leaks until an official word is released?
13.54.25 #       <Merko> HMetal: Because I'm curious?
13.55.03 #       <HMetal> I don't get it..  It's nice to have insideer info but why spill it at the expense of possibly 1) pissing someone off and 2) causing a big stink just for the hell of it.. ?
13.55.10 #       <Merko> HMetal: Anyway.. that wasn't the point. I never said I do.. though in fact I 'm interested in any info. Usually it's rather easy to see if it's true or not.
13.55.19 #       <HMetal> You know what they say about curiosity..
13.55.33 #       <HMetal> maybe they should extend the "cat" to the "platform" ? ;)
13.55.59 #       <Dave_C> curiousity killed the icoa
13.56.22 #       <Dave_C> let's just hope not
13.56.27 #       <HMetal> ICOA, I doubt, will be going anywhere soon..  It's too "established" and too large.
13.56.27 #       <Merko> Dave_C: How? The person who leaked already knew..
13.56.52 #       <Dave_C> hell.. I'm not on the list, and I knew that stuff...
13.56.57 #       <HMetal> Unless AI decides to create another CATS and hire people..  which wouldn't bother me at all..
13.57.02 #       <Dave_C> Havemose told it on IRC from Toronto.
13.57.13 #       <Dave_C> The content isn't what ppl are freaking over...
13.57.22 #       <Dave_C> the fact that someone leaked it... period
13.58.04 #       <Womble> If AI actually hired people *at all* that would make me a bit more confident.
13.58.12 #       <Womble> OTOH maybe they have done, but aren't telling us.
13.58.13 #       <Merko> Yeah. I don't see why people are surprised, though.
13.58.21 #       <HMetal> But...  as far as ICOA goes, it's the best we have CURRENTLY for legit info and a future developer support..  So I'm behind them 100%.
13.59.10 #       <Dave_C> remember that they've said over and over that they can't talk about software partners
13.59.17 #       <Merko> Hell, I'm not an ICOA member so I don't know anything at all about what they are up to.. I guess most people don't even know that they exist! Maybe it's more "Secrecy killed.."..
14.00.28 #       <HMetal> Secrecy is required in many walks of life..  Especially when you're dealing with issues of implementation which can be 1) stolen and 2) copyrighted or patented right out from under your feet.
14.01.10 #       <HMetal> ..unless you'd like those precious future advertising and R&D dollars spent paying licensing fees..
14.01.33 #       <Merko> HMetal: Yeah.. of course some things have to be secret, but I think only two levels of secrecy are rational: 1) super secret things, that only people you are 100% sure of get to know. 2) non-secret things, that anyone can know.
14.01.38 #       * Dave_C has to go to rehearsal
14.02.03 #       <HMetal> non-secret things have been released, both through the ICOA and T*A.
14.02.42 #       <Merko> Yeah. There are some working groups, and maybe they are actually working. Well I know at least some are, but not oficially.
14.02.55 #       <HMetal> maybe other "small" secrets are secret at the other end of the table... Maybe AI doesn't mind but the other party would..  You have to think of both sides of the deal, not just the AI side.
14.03.37 #       <HMetal> We can't be pirates forever..  metaphorically speaking..
14.03.37 #       <Merko> HMetal: Then that party should only tell it to people he knew for sure could be trusted..

15.44.39 #       <Womble> Oh NO!
15.44.54 #       <HMetal> Y2K is a simple problem but most people STILL haven't dealt with it.  Though, I have already taken care of that problem in CNet Amiga. :)
15.45.09 #       <Cryto> Thats OK..  God Said on Dec. 31 1999, the earth is gonna explode, so the Y2k problem is trivial....

15.48.10 #       <Cryto> Hehehe
15.49.29 #       <Womble> Well, Bishop Usher figured out some time that the world would last 6000 years, starting in 4004 BC.
15.49.40 #       <Womble> He also worked out the day and time it started.
15.49.58 #       <Womble> Hence, 6000 years later, I went to a Y6K party. That was last year. The world didn't end.
15.50.09 #       <Womble> As you might have noticed.
15.50.41 #       <Womble> 4004 comes from that adding-up-ages-of-people-in-the-bible stuff
15.50.48 #       <Cryto> Womble: The world ended when C= went bankrupt.  We are just waiting to see if AI can save it... :)
15.51.16 #       <Arvid> <-- remains intrigued by those who think that 2000 years from the birth of Jesus is a magical year.  Since that was 1997, I guess the magic is gone.
15.51.53 #       <Cryto> Arvid: You sure about that?  Since we have had so many calendar changes, its hard to pinpoint.. :)
15.52.26 #       <Womble> Arvid: Thought it was 1993, but there you go.
15.52.29 #       <Arvid> Cryto: not that many .. just a few days at a time, especially in the 18th century.  And we know the man Jesus was born in the year 4 BC
15.53.00 #       <Cryto> Wonder how they kept time back then.  I mean, did they really count DOWN the years or something?  or what...
15.53.26 #       <Cryto> "Oh no!  Its year 0!  We are all gonna die!  The earth is gonna end!"
15.53.28 #       <Cryto> :)
15.54.05 #       <Arvid> Cryto: nah .. we know the history of the 'Middle East' and we know who was King in the region . and we know that Jesus was born while he reigned and we know that the King died in 3 BC
15.54.46 #       <Arvid> unless the King has been showing up in Quik Shops in Israel lately.. I have not checked for sure, but I'm told he does still wear the same hairdo
15.55.19 #       <Arvid> although I have heard from others that the King appears in Vegas now and then
15.55.34 #       <Cryto> Hmm..  Bible was just a history book with a plot attempt, that was found some time later...  Maybe if I take a book, leave it somewhere in the desert, 1000 years from now, it may be found and spread as the gospel...

16.06.09 #       <Womble> 1st Jan 2000, that is
16.06.38 #       <Dave_C> older bios's will likely have division by zero errors in intialization
16.06.47 #       <Agima> Womble : Any PC with a non-2000 compliant BIOS, and any embedded applications (eg VCR's, TV's), that don't have Y2K compliant systems
16.06.57 #       <Cryto> Dave_C: Heh, there goes my ibm.. :)
16.07.04 #       <Womble> No, the PCs don't matter. I've already written a software fix for that.
16.07.11 #       <Arvid> <-- reads about one electric power generating plant .. they tried setting the master clock to a few minutes before the dreaded time, and when the clock rolled over, so did all the turbines .. dead quiet
16.07.18 #       <Womble> Besides, wtf would they do division? That sounds like crap to me.
16.07.23 #       <Agima> There is a possibilty of planes and other nasty things happening
16.07.27 #       <Womble> The problem is with rolling over incorrectly.
16.07.49 #       <HMetal> Womble: division on the year?  For leap year checks..
16.08.02 #       <HMetal> 0/4 = undefined.
16.08.03 #       <Womble> HMetal: So you divide *by* the year? No, you don't.
16.08.10 #       <Womble> HMetal: Yes, it is defined. Basic maths.
16.08.12 #       <HMetal> True.
16.08.15 #       <HMetal> I have is backwards.
16.08.18 #       <HMetal> doh
16.08.27 #       <HMetal> I'll go back to coding now.. :)
16.08.44 #       <HMetal> That's what I get for digging myself out before I think.
16.08.46 #       <Dave_C> it's every 4 years exept every 100 years, then skipp every 400 years?
16.09.01 #       <HMetal> Dave: Yep.
16.09.04 #       <Trolan> <nod>
16.09.07 #       <Womble> Yes, soemthing like that, but the BIOS can ignore that completely.
16.09.19 #       <Womble> Sorry, I mean it can ignore everything except the 4-year rule.
16.09.23 #       <HMetal> Yep. BIOS doesn't need to check that..
16.09.31 #       <Arvid> 2000 does have 366 days
16.09.36 #       <Trolan> next skipped leap year is 2100.
16.09.40 #       <Womble> The next exception will be 2100, which is out of range.
16.09.55 #       <Arvid> <-- hopes to be dead and gone by 2100
16.09.58 #       <Womble> The problem is with BIOSes that only handle the range 1980-1999 (mainly)
16.10.21 #       <Womble> I wrote a software fix that gives you some years more if you use DOS.

16.11.22 #       <Womble> DOS deals with dates from 1980 to 2107 correctly.
16.11.27 #       <Arvid> <-- does worry a bit about hospitals and such with IV pumps which will shut off at the dreaded time
16.11.35 #       <Womble> Not in some really old version, possibly
16.11.41 #       <HMetal> Hmmm..  I never even checked..  I assume Award BIOS has been fixed by now, afa Y2K goes?
16.11.56 #       <Womble> Arvid: I think it extremely unlikely that IV pumps would need to know the real time.
16.12.30 #       <Womble> HMetal: I imagine so. Besides, who cares? You don't even need to use the BIOS to set the time if your OS can hit the RTC directly.
16.12.56 #       <Arvid> womble: sure they do... many now talk to the central computer in the hospital by radio link ... and they can change the flow rate at programmed times
16.13.15 #       <HMetal> What's funny (looking at my motherboard manual) is that the BIOS date setting shows "YYYY" and the help/prompt text says "YY".. :)
16.13.18 #       <Womble> Arvid: Uh... shit.
16.13.44 #       <Womble> HMetal: The manual, or the actual setup firmware?
16.13.51 #       <Dave_C> Arvid: Something like that would have to have failsafes
16.13.55 #       <Womble> HMetal: setup program, that is

16.14.08 #       <HMetal> firmware
16.14.09 #       <Dave_C> it would fall back to manual settings.
16.14.39 #       <Arvid> Dave_C: having been on the receiving end .. recently .. in a hospital .. I am one who is not at all sure that such failsafes exist.
16.14.42 #       <Trolan> heh

18.47.33 #       <Miracle> Hiya mechanic
18.47.50 #       <Mechanic> How you doing, Miracle.
18.47.57 #       <Mechanic> ??
18.47.59 #       <Miracle> im cool yourself?
18.48.00 #       <DeepThought> I have a list of errors/tasks from the gurus i saw when trying to boot w/hd +cd-rom
18.48.29 #       <Womble> DeepThought: I can't think of anything else. What were the error numbers though?
18.48.31 #       <Mechanic> Doing well. Sorry to hear about the stuff with Gener and Classylady. :((
18.48.37 #       <Womble> DeepThought: Task addresses are useless.
18.49.17 #       <Mechanic> Pretty much.
18.49.17 #       <DeepThought> 8000 0003 / 801f 03ff / 801f 037f / 8000 000e / 8000 0004
18.49.59 #       <DeepThought> seems like errors are pretty useless too ;-)
18.50.04 #       <Womble> Hmm, those 801f ones are odd.
18.50.24 #       <Womble> The others are ordinary CPU errors.
18.50.52 #       <DeepThought> the 03ff one is the one i saw most
18.51.49 #       <Womble> Are you sure you got that? That's meaningless.
18.52.02 #       <Womble> Perhaps there's a serious bus error that screwed up the error number.
18.52.21 #       <DeepThought> that and the 0003 one...  got em so much they all look the same
18.52.54 #       <Kinners> Womble: Could it be an error number of the hardware?
18.53.18 #       <Womble> Kinners: Well, the OS will never generate those; only a custom driver would.
18.53.38 #       <Womble> Kinners: Or possibly accelerator firmware.
18.53.48 #       <Womble> DeepThought: Just how far does the computer get before failing?
18.53.49 #       <Kinners> Womble: yeah, that's what I meant :)
18.54.26 #       <DeepThought> nowhere.  if i have both hd and cd, it shows me the little disk animation on purple
18.54.39 #       <DeepThought> then i try a soft reboot and it gurus
18.54.51 #       <Womble> Oh, that's *really* weird.
18.55.00 #       <Cryto> DeepThought: Make sure the CD is set to slave.  That may help, dunno.
18.55.10 #       <DeepThought> with the mbx1200 i could soft reboot and then i was off and running
18.55.29 #       <Womble> Ah, so the first problem is just that the HD is slow to set the ready signal.
18.55.46 #       <DeepThought> yeah, figured that one...
18.55.48 #       <Womble> Then it gurus... how long after you reboot? Instantly, or after a few seconds?
18.55.54 #       <Womble> Do you get a few colour changes first?
18.56.13 #       <DeepThought> few seconds, no color changes, stays grey and then shows guru
18.56.42 #       <DeepThought> sounds like it tries to access the hd, cd powers, and then guru
18.57.40 #       <DeepThought> cd is slave, hd is master
18.57.49 #       <Womble> I have to think it's that motherboard problem, but a buffered interface *might* fix it.
18.58.13 #       <DeepThought> could it be the slow hd messing things up?
18.58.19 #       <Womble> I don't pretend to understand hardware very well.

18.58.41 #       <Womble> No, I think it is a problem with the electrical load on the bus, and voltages going out of range.
18.59.01 #       <DeepThought> any hw people I could resource?
18.59.03 #       <Miracle> wowo tahts getting deep
18.59.10 #       <Womble> So a 1 signal can become a 0 or vice versa...

21.57.53 #       <Dave_C> nope
21.58.03 #       <Dave_C> I've heard about Play's thing...
21.58.13 #       <Dave_C> but I've heard too many mixed reviews
21.58.24 #       <Seed> me too
21.58.51 #       <Commish> hmmm.... kinda limited

21.59.20 #       <Dave_C> and it looks gorgeous.
21.59.24 #       <Dave_C> seen it hands on
21.59.32 #       <Dave_C> I was shocked at how good it looked
21.59.42 #       <Commish> I have (presently) 2 9 gb 99.5% hq5 seagates.  1 hour
22.00.16 #       <Dave_C> yeah.. I can get a Flyer for $8500 w/ 2 - 9's for vid, and a 4G for audio
22.00.36 #       <Dave_C> get a used tbc for about $500
22.01.01 #       <Commish> I've seen the mixed reviews on the play unit also.   Just a few more $ and you can actually do this also...
22.01.56 #       <Commish> hmmm.... good price tag
22.02.10 #       <Dave_C> the casablanca does have 3 stereo audio tracks
22.02.14 #       <Commish> s-vid?
22.02.45 #       <Dave_C> casablanca has s inputs and has composite inputs on the back
22.02.50 Quit    HMetal (:Ping timeout for HMetal[wnd1-42.netrover.com])
22.03.02 #       <Dave_C> the 1st box was s-v only
22.03.37 #       <Commish> newtek beware...   lightwave has been lingering long enough!
22.03.56 #       <Commish> or... too long
22.04.16 #       <Dave_C> they gotta get an api to make it for the new box
22.04.32 #       <Commish> newtek?
22.04.44 #       <Dave_C> <nod>
22.05.04 #       <Commish> It sounds like the stock hardware will blow away the flyer
22.05.19 #       <Dave_C> or make the flyer too easy
22.05.38 #       <Commish> sigh...

22.06.57 #       <Commish> I get carried away...
22.07.52 #       <Commish> which is a _good_ place to keep it...    You heard the latest on gates and doj?   grin
22.08.29 #       <Dave_C> A LOT of info has been released, but so widely spaced (and sometime between the lines) that some folks just can't see it
22.08.52 #       <Dave_C> I'm not following Billy and the Beaters
22.09.24 #       <Commish> Only those who have a clue...... see the picture thru the hue...
22.09.30 #       <Dave_C> I just hope they keep him in court until Nov 1999
22.09.40 #       <Commish> hehhe
22.09.58 #       <Dave_C> I'm not on the ICOA lists yet, but I knew all the stuff that was leaked....
22.10.11 #       <Commish> or at least set him back that fsar or further
22.10.14 #       <Dave_C> and heard most of it from Dr. Havemose himself
22.10.43 #       <Commish> ohhhh.... you da man???!!!
22.11.04 #       <Dave_C> He talked about it on IRC from Toronto
22.11.21 #       <Dave_C> Jus too many people crying 'PPC PPC PPC

22.11.52 #       <Commish> sigh..... ppc good.... mmc...???
22.12.12 #       <Dave_C> ppc good for people who don't want to advance beyond 3.x
22.12.58 #       <Commish> (in caveman talk)   ppc make me fast effect....
22.15.05 #       <Dave_C> This old 2K has seen 12 or more years of good service...
22.15.13 #       <Dave_C> hosted a couple of Toasters
22.15.26 #       <Dave_C> run big and small BBS
22.15.50 #       <Dave_C> and will probably continue to be of use (until I run out of replacement parts)
22.16.17 #       <Commish> put it this way... at work, everybody knows I'm an Amiga man (thus my pee sea is "AMIGO"..  I keep telling them...
22.16.18 #       <Dave_C> I got another 2K and 3 500's to cannibalize
22.16.40 #       <Commish> Don't worry.... you tooo, will some day be an amiga owner....
22.18.38 #       <Commish> Actually... I am presently using me ol A2K 040.  (the flyer dims my lights when I turn it on)
22.18.42 #       <Dave_C> I plan on showing off the dev machine I'm building when OS/4 is stabilized.
22.19.35 #       <Dave_C> got a 6x86 233 motherboard for 189 bucks
22.19.47 #       <Commish> Are you going to buy a 4.0 sys?
22.20.13 #       <Dave_C> building it
22.20.31 #       <Commish> (rock and hard place) I swore I would never own a wintel sys.
22.20.45 #       <Dave_C> oh it won't habve M$ anything on it
22.21.14 #       <Dave_C> unitl OS/4 it'll have slackware or redhat w/ X windows
22.22.04 #       <Commish> yeah, but w is only 1 of the 6 letters.   Segmented mem, shitty inst set, accumulater i/o   (shudder)
22.22.46 #       <Dave_C> I've run SCO w/ X before.. it's quite nice...

22.27.51 #       <Commish> sco is pretty good.  lotsa updates.... but still unix
22.29.22 #       <Commish> sigh...  If I have to buy an intel platform, it will be a 4.0 sys
22.29.29 #       <Dave_C> unix ain't as bad as a lot of folks make it out to be...
22.29.53 #       <Dave_C> it has a steep learning curve, but it works for most of the internet
22.29.58 #       <Dave_C> ;^)
