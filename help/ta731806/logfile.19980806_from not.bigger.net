12.42.23 #       <Merko> Ogge: Hehe.. well.. maybe. They have some colour printers too, but I'd have to ask for permission to use them. :)
12.43.21 #       <Ogge> :))
12.43.39 #       <Merko> Ogge: They aren't really meant for sticker printing though, but for.. well, any kind of label that has for example numbers, dates etc, that changes a lot..
12.44.24 #       <Ogge> ah ok.. 
12.44.54 #       <Merko> Actually what I'm going to print is a new label for my A4k saying not "Commodore 4000/030" but "Amiga 4000/060/604e". :)

13.11.35 #       <Ogge> hi amios
13.11.40 #       <AmiOS> Hello
13.11.58 #       <Dozer> Hi.. anyone here with Amiga 3000 or 4000? I'm having some problems with my keyboard... I get the "flashing caps" all the time.. can it be fixed?
13.13.07 #       <Ogge> dozer, when u boot or all the time while using the amiga?
13.13.15 #       <Merko> Dozer: Hmm, I'm pretty new with my A4k.. haven't had such a problem ever..
13.13.37 #       <Dozer> Ogge: 5 out of 10 times I boot... I can't use the keyboard when this happens... 1 flash/sec... 
13.13.54 #       <Ogge> dozer, sounds like some problems with ur amiga.. 
13.14.09 #       <Ogge> 1 flash per second means something.. but i can't remember what.. 
13.14.16 #       <Dozer> Ogge: no.. it's a common problem with A3-4000 keyboards..
13.15.04 #       <Ogge> r u sure.. flashing caps can be found on all amigas when u have a hardware problem.. 
13.16.32 #       <Dozer> Ogge: I'm pretty sure, yes... I've had some keyboards.. ;) 
13.16.35 #       <Merko> Dozer: Does it keep on blinking forever, or blink a certain number of times?
13.17.22 #       <Dozer> Merko: forever... I have to power down, wait, and power up... it can take from 10-20 minutes before it works...
13.17.58 #       <Merko> Dozer: Alright.. the error messages just blink a certain number of times. Maybe the keyboard crashes and restarts the blinking though..
13.18.05 #       <Ogge> sounds like a hardware problem.. not a glitch with the keyboard.. have u tried searching on the web for help?
13.18.07 #       <Merko> (yes, the keyboard CAN crash!)
13.18.43 #       <Dozer> Merko: I believe it's something like the "keyboard watchdog timer" that's failing.. I was just courious if I could fix it myself... 
13.18.48 #       <Merko> Does anyone here have a cv3d, and managed to run ISIS with overlay in any sensible screenmode?

15.18.51 #       <Womble> Arvid: But *how*, is what I wonder?!
15.19.36 #       <Arvid> Womble: just before he came here for a visit in March .. he got some hard drives in to insall ... 36 cases of 9-gigabyte drives ... he said that increased the online capacity by 9 percent

16.18.42 #       <Maxicon> (eg:  Like Emacs_Pro in the S: drawer, etc...)
16.19.27 #       <Womble> What does that do?
16.19.46 #       <Maxicon> Womble: Lets you change some settings for MicroEmacs so it's a bit more usable as a text editor.
16.19.56 #       <Womble> Maxion: I've seen that information. It's not a normal DOS attack, but a trojan horse.
16.20.06 #       <Maxicon> EG:  If you make the file Emacs_Pro in S: and have it contain:  SET MODE WRAP
16.20.06 #       <Maxicon> SET WRAP 78
16.20.17 #       <Maxicon> Then it will use word wrap and have it start at margin 78.
16.20.26 #       <Womble> Maxicon: Oh, right, it's the startup file, like ~/.emacs with real emacs
16.20.39 #       <Maxicon> Makes it a heck of a lot more useful as a text editor, esp. for using an OLR.
16.23.24 #       <Womble> I've found that joe in emacs emulation mode is a hell of a lot more usable.
16.23.54 #       <Maxicon> What do you guys use for OLR's?  I was using AmyBW, but it chokes on CNet QWK packets for some reason.

16.29.28 #       <defacto> have you used a microvitec 1764 monitor?
16.29.34 #       <Maxicon> Not I.
16.29.46 #       <Womble> No
16.30.13 #       <defacto> cause  I'm considering purchasing one, but I've noticed that the horiz hz only does 1280x1200 @ 60hz thats bad isnt it?
16.30.34 #       <Womble> 60 Hz isn't so bad at that resolution. How much is it?
16.30.48 #       <defacto> and 1152x??? @ 60hz also 800x600@ 60hz?????
16.31.01 #       <Womble> I assume the main reason for choosing that over an ordinary 17" monitor is that it does 15 kHz modes

16.44.24 #       <Kernal> Womble: Well it's suppose to use 4 PPC Processors and a 68000 for compatibility with existing os31, or a possible port of 3.1
16.44.32 #       <Womble> Kernal: Vapour.
16.44.57 #       <Kernal> Womble: Ya your probably right... but it sounds cool.... you have to admit!
16.44.59 #       <Womble> Kernal: The PreBOX, if it ever emerges, will probably run Linux with some Amiga emulation based on UAE.
16.45.24 #       <Kernal> Womble: That's not what Phase5's web page would indicate!
16.45.35 #       <defacto> Womble: Do you know whether the bridge machine will have a monitor bundled with it?
16.45.41 #       <Womble> Kernal: Not really. I'm far more interested in PIOS's modular system, which will be available with up to 4 PPC 750s at launch, with proper cache coherency support etc etc and plenty of slots and ports.

16.45.59 #       <Womble> defacto: There isn't a 'bridge' machine, just a bridge card. Use whatever PC you want with it.
16.46.23 #       <defacto> Hey Yoshi!, sorry to hear about ANN, that was a good service you was provisdiing
16.46.27 #       <Womble> defacto: Gateway should be able to sell you the bridge card as an option with their PCs, though.
16.46.28 #       <Kernal> Yoshi2:Well, Well, I guess you decided to keep the ANN up after all eh? 
16.46.43 #       <Womble> Eh, what's going on?
16.46.46 #       <Yoshi2> Hi!
16.47.30 #       <Yoshi2> I'll put up a statement tomorrow.  I'll have to see how things will evolve...
16.47.47 #       <Kernal> Womble: It appears that ANN was shut down temporarily due to NDA info leak!
16.48.02 #       <Womble> Well, I see no reason for it really.
16.48.06 #       <defacto> BTW: How comes this channel is not on Amiganet, everyone on amiganet was complaining b4 I came here
16.48.29 #       <defacto> Yoshi: The NDA leak was about the OS thing wasnt it?
16.48.30 #       <Womble> Christian, as a journalist you are not at all bound to follow agreements that other people have or haven't made...
16.48.49 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: For me there was a reason.  But then again, there are also many reasons to keep it going...
16.49.07 #       <Kernal> Womble: He want's to be good and honest.... I like that!
16.49.10 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: Agreed.  But nevertheless, one can do harm; and that's what I don't want
16.49.11 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: I say, carry on.
16.49.23 #       <defacto> Yoshi: I agree with you that some stuff should be kept a secret for the time being
16.49.52 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: I'll do that, but I'll follow Squid's advice and investigate into getting ANN partly "member only"...
16.49.58 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: So you have to make judgements about that... but your intention is to act in the interest of the wider Amiga community, right?
16.50.02 #       <defacto> Yoshi: Yeah please carry on, Sometimes you are the only source of news nowadays
16.50.16 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: ... where some people will be able to read news before the general public sees it...
16.50.25 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: Which people?
16.50.41 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: ... and will be able to control whether the general public will see some news at all...
16.50.48 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: I'll have to see which people
16.50.57 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: I don't know that that's a good idea.
16.51.11 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: Perhaps I'll talk with the ICOA, perhaps it will just be a few people I know
16.51.13 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: It may reduce your credibility as a news source.
16.51.19 #       <defacto> Yoshi: do m$ read your page, as they do squids?
16.51.44 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: I think you should feel free to publish leaked information if you believe it's in the Amiga public's interest.
16.51.46 #       <Yoshi2> defacto: Don't know.  I don't analyse my server logs that much :)
16.52.28 #       <defacto> Yoshi: I think some should be quiet just in case M$ do read your page
16.52.31 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: Don't know if it reduces credibility.
16.52.37 #       <Kernal> Yoshi2: I think that if Amiga Inc. doesn't want something leaked, then they probably have a good reason for it!
16.53.04 #       <defacto> yoshi: Like Stuff about MMC should be kept quiet bcause of M$
16.53.22 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: Question is, do you want to be the 'official' news source, or an independent one?
16.53.39 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: My idea is to provide people a kind of "beta version" of each update and give them some time (24 hours) to provide feedback.  If I don't see any complaints, I'll post, if I see complaints I won't post
16.53.45 #       <Womble> defacto: That's crap, frankly. M$ will not fear Amiga Inc unless and until they show product.
16.53.48 #       <defacto> Womble: If he is offical then he cant report rumours
16.53.55 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: Since I rely on Usenet, I can never be official
16.54.18 #       <Kernal> Womble: Agree, and then they'll just buy Amiga out!
16.54.20 #       <Womble> Yoshi2: So be independent, and don't let other people tell you what not to post.
16.54.41 #       <defacto> do you think there is any truth in Hembach having M$ connections?
16.54.41 #       <Womble> Kernal: Amiga Inc is owned by Gateway.
16.54.43 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: That's a point
16.54.49 #       <Womble> defacto: Doubt it.
16.55.07 #       <Kernal> Womble: So.....
16.55.12 #       <Yoshi2> defacto: Don't think so.  I think he has very direct and intense connections with his pocket (that's where all his $$ go)
16.55.12 #       <Womble> defacto: He's just trying to make as much as he can out of this bankruptcy job, I expect.
16.55.21 #       <defacto> do you think there is any truth in Hembach being a greedy bastard? :)
16.55.41 #       <Womble> Probably
16.55.42 #       <defacto> Yoshi: heheheh

16.58.27 #       <Yoshi2> defacto: There is one yes, although I didn't publically announce it yet

17.20.32 #       <Kernal> Dave_C: I don't think is so unreasonable... at the St.Louis show I saw Joe Torre with the actual AAA chip set still on the printed disk.
17.23.22 #       <Dave_C> AAA is still behind...
17.24.01 #       <Dave_C> the future can't be 5 year old stagnated technology
17.24.02 #       <Womble> AAA should have been out in 1992 in the A1200.
17.24.08 #       <Womble> That would have been pretty good.
17.24.18 #       <Dave_C> <nod< but not for now.
17.24.38 #       <Womble> But C= was saddled with old factories and poor management
17.25.37 #       <Kernal> What do you think the possibility is of finding an A1000 in the box still shrink wrapped?
17.27.19 #       <Dave_C> I dunno about that condition, but heart got one last week for $30
17.28.12 #       <Kernal> I'd like to find one with the box, manuals, and everything in good shape!
17.31.54 #       <Dave_C> yes that would be quite kewl

19.14.54 #       <Kernel> Don't be so humble!
19.16.23 #       <Kernel> If a guy wants to learn Assembler programming, would it be wise to start on an 8bit machine?
19.16.54 #       <Womble> It might be, but then it might teach you bad habits.
19.17.05 #       <Womble> 8-bitters don't tend to have much of an OS
19.17.52 #       <Womble> Personally, I think 68000 asm is quite fun; others have told me that ARM asm is nice too.
19.18.07 #       <Kernel> I'm in the middle of learning C/C++, should I learn Assembly along with it?
19.18.17 #       <Womble> You might find it useful.
19.18.45 #       <Womble> It may help you to understand better how the machine works and what your C code is doing at a lower level.
19.19.09 #       <Kernel> Know of any good books?
19.19.49 #       <Womble> I don't. I learnt by reading other people's code and looking at what my compiler generated (which was crap, but at least understandable)
19.20.16 #       <Womble> I'm not sure I can recommend that way, but looking at what your compiler generates is very instructive.
19.21.46 #       <Kernel> I'm currently trying to convert an old AC/Basic Othello game I wrote years ago into C. Being able to optimise in assembler would be good I guess!
19.22.26 #       * TA wishes someone would do monopoly for the cybergfx card ...
19.22.43 #       <Womble> I suspect that it's not really worth optimising it in assembler, but it really depends how smart the game is meant to be.
19.23.07 #       <Womble> A lot of people miss the really important bit of optimisation, which is choosing a good algorithm in the first place.
19.23.18 #       <TA> Womble: How hard is it to convert something like a game to play on a cybergfx screen rather than a wb screen?
19.23.28 #       <Womble> Writing optimised asm code for a poor algorithm will give much worse results than C code for a good algorithm

19.24.31 #       <Womble> TA: I don't know, since I haven't done that sort of graphics programming. A few graphics.library functions aren't implemented correctly by the CGX patch...
19.25.20 #       <Womble> TA: Those obviously have to be avoided. As does any code that depends on certain special copper capabilities or hits the blitter directly.
19.25.59 #       <Womble> TA: Also, I'm assuming that the game uses the OS in the first place, rather than bashing hardware for all its graphics displays. If it doesn't use the OS to start with, the conversion would be much more difficult.

20.45.33 #       <Cryto> Arvid: 28.8 modem?  Not too bad.. :)
20.45.37 #       <Arvid> Cryto: that is mostly what I use it for .. when I carry my elderly 386 notebook around with me
20.46.06 #       <Arvid> Cryto: and maybe I could get a chip change or something to v.34+ ... maybe .. maybe not
20.46.35 #       <Cryto> Prolly not worth it.  They will charge you about $60-90 for it I bet, if its even possible.. :)
20.46.43 #       <Arvid> Cryto: quite true.
20.47.21 #       <Arvid> Cryto: and with more ISPs moving to v.90 connections .. the max connect speed to a v.90 from a nonv.90 modem is 31200 bps
20.48.14 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Yeah, there's 1 ISP here that I get that..  They dont have V.90, but my USR is flashed to it..  When they get V.90, I hope to see it go up..  (Then I may decide to switch to them. :)
20.48.22 #       <Womble> Arvid: How odd!
20.48.26 #       <gener> wich reminds me i have to get firmware for this modem
20.48.55 #       <Womble> Oh yes, where can one get a firmware file for a generic K56Flex modem?
20.49.13 #       <Womble> For the V90 upgrade.
20.49.22 #       <Arvid> Cryto: that is why I now have the USR Sportster .. my old ISP was bought out by another one, and the new  one uses USR modems .. actually x2 .. and I regularly connect at 48000 bps
20.49.25 #       <gener> hehe try from modem makers web site
20.49.28 #       <Cryto> Womble: Dunno.  Prolly nowhere. :)
20.50.11 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Cool.  The ISP I am with, aint gonna update their lines down here I bet..  So, I may switch to the other ISP.  They are cheaper, and better connect rates....
20.50.53 #       * gener feels lucky i have a great isp
20.51.43 #       <Arvid> I know one guy in Texas .. using an A3000/060 who gets ISDN (64K) for $14.95  per month
20.51.55 #       <Cryto> On the one I am with, I get consistant 26400 connects, with some 28.8 connects sometimes..

20.52.18 #       <TA> hey guys ... came back for a few.
20.52.21 #       <Arvid> Cryto really cheap .. it costs $99 per month here
20.52.25 #       <Womble> re Gary
20.52.36 #       <TA> re gener
20.52.39 #       <gener> hiya TA
20.52.42 #       <TA> good to see you here.
20.52.46 #       <Cryto> No idea what it would cost here...  I wouldnt mind an ISDN tho..  Or even a normal modem full time connect.. :)
20.53.18 #       <TA> Cryto: Did you ever get that keyboard to work?
20.54.08 #       <Cryto> TA: I told you I did. :)  I am using it right now. :)
20.54.12 #       <Arvid> Cryto: one thing .. the USR/3Com Sportster is the first modem ever (for me) which worked perfectly on the A3000 right out of the box without changing any parameters
20.54.22 #       <TA> wow! how did ya get all the keys working?
20.54.55 #       <TA> Arvid: Same experience here with Sportsters on my A3000.
20.54.57 #       <Cryto> TA: Cleaned the hell out of them. :)  The caps lock key was missing a spring, but a friend I know sent me a replacement..  I then just cleaned all the keys and the contacts...
20.55.09 #       <Cryto> Arvid: My 14.4 Supra worked fine out of the box...
20.55.49 #       <TA> anyone using a cable modem? like with cable tv company provided web access?
20.55.50 #       <gener> my external 28.8 worked great out off box no matter what i plug it into
20.55.57 #       <Cryto> My internal 2400 Supra worked out of the box too.. :)
20.55.57 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I had a Supra 2400 years ago on my BBS (for about six months) .. that one required some tuning
20.56.44 #       <Cryto> (I liked that internal too..  Got rid of all the cables & puwer wires...  Wish I had a 56k internal.. :)
20.57.08 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I still like seeing the little flashing lights
20.57.11 #       <TA> and has anyone doen the v.90 patch to their 3com modem?
20.57.13 #       <TA> done
20.57.24 #       <Arvid> TA: mine came with v.90
20.57.26 #       <Cryto> Arvid: There was a program included that replaced them. :)
20.57.39 #       <Arvid> Cryto: yeah 
20.57.45 #       <TA> Cryto: They were on screen led's right?
20.57.57 #       <Cryto> TA:  On the USR?  (Cant remember if they are 3com now or not)  For the sportsters, there is a V.90 flasher (IBM/Mac) on their web page.
20.58.14 #       <Cryto> TA: Yeah.  Little program that went on the WB.  Was pretty neat. :)
20.58.23 #       <TA> Cryto: Yeah, I haven't taken mine to work to flash it yet.
20.58.29 #       <Cryto> (I never really used it much tho..  I got used to no lights. :)
20.58.48 #       <Cryto> TA:  I hooked mine to the IBM.  COuldnt get the mac version to work.  Kept locking the machine up.
20.59.12 #       <Arvid> <-- could have put an internal 56K in the A3000, but the lights are so exciting to look at ..........
20.59.20 #       <Womble> My Rockwell modem came with information on how to do firmware upgrades using a terminal program
20.59.22 #       <TA> I was waiting until they did the final final patch ... :)
20.59.43 #       <Womble> I daresay I could write a program to do it automatically from the Amiga, based on that information
20.59.48 #       <Cryto> Arvid: How could you have done that?  Dont think there are any Amiga internal 56k modems.. :)
20.59.58 #       <Womble> Unfortunately I have yet to find a generic Rockwell V90 firmware file
21.00.15 #       <TA> Womble: Thousands of 3com modem users would certainly appreciate that.
21.00.23 #       <Womble> No, I just found one for internals, actually, but I stil have to find one for externals
21.00.23 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I am using a GoldenGate II bridgecard .. and an ISA 16550 buffered UART to talk to the modem at 115200
21.00.30 #       <Cryto> Womble: Well, if you actually had the update code, there IS a way to do it using XModem..  I dont recall offhand tho.  Prolly put it into testmode, or local loopback, or something, then upload via xmodem.
21.00.50 #       <Womble> TA: But 3Coms are different from Rockwells
21.01.03 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Ah.  Too bad you can only get 1 device that way on the A3k. :(  A3k has too few ibm slots.
21.01.15 #       <TA> Womble: I bet you could also do one for them if you can do rockwell's.
21.01.32 #       <Arvid> Cryto: the card has two serial ports and one parallel port .. but I'm only using the one serial port
21.01.48 #       <TA> 3 com told me they didn't have enough interest to release an amiga only patch ... :(
21.01.51 #       <Womble> Cryto: It's ASCII upload on Rockwells
21.02.01 #       <Cryto> Arvid: The GG2 does?  Cool..
21.02.07 #       <TA> Womble: Ahhh that makes a diff.
21.02.18 #       <Arvid> Cryto: no the ISA card I'm using has all that stuff.
21.02.30 #       <Cryto> Womble: Well, my info was from a long time ago, and I never needed it, as I have an ibm too.. :)
21.02.40 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Ah, ok..
21.02.58 #       <Arvid> <--wants a combo high speed serial and Ethernet card in ISA format .. but those things cost serious money
21.03.09 #       <Womble> Cryto: My modem is connecteed to the PC, but I don't have Windows anyway
21.03.27 #       <Womble> Arvid: Why do you need both together? Running out of slots?
21.03.30 #       <Cryto> I would try to get a ethernet card if I had 2 GG2's..  I have a A2232 7 port board that is fixed to 56k/bi-dir, and a GVP I/O board on the other machine...
21.03.38 #       <Arvid> Womble: exactly
21.03.46 #       <Cryto> Womble: Hmm..  Run win31 just so you can flash it. :)
21.03.47 #       <TA> How would I flash mine thru a network? Can I just download the wizard and then let the computer work directly to the modem if I plug it in or does it have to go online?
21.04.25 #       <Cryto> TA:  It has to call out and get the flash code I believe..
21.04.29 #       <Cryto> Mine dialed out..

21.04.36 #       <Cryto> Hi NiteFlite 
21.04.41 #       <TA> NiteFlite: mornin'
21.04.43 #       <NiteFlite> Hello all.
21.04.57 #       <NiteFlite> TA: Just about, 11:59 PM.  : )
21.05.06 #       <gener> hiya niteflite
21.05.11 #       <Arvid> <-- did the 33.6 (v.34+) on my Cardinal modem.  That was a program to download first, and then run on the 386 under windows
21.05.12 #       <Womble> TA: No idea
21.05.15 #       <TA> hehe, I usually have no idea, It is either nite or day to me.
21.05.22 #       <Womble> Cryto: Perhaps that was just a test.
21.05.27 #       <Womble> Hi nte
21.05.31 #       <Womble> Hi NiteFlite 
21.05.46 #       <NiteFlite> Heya Womble.
21.05.57 #       <Cryto> Womble: A 2-5 minute test? :)  Nah, it was downloading something..  All the lights were flashing..
21.06.24 #       <Womble> Cryto: Really... interesting.
21.06.38 #       <TA> At one time USR was going to let people download a wizard that would patch the modem. I guess 3com changed our minds for us.  :(
21.06.54 #       <TA> Makes it tough on peeps on a network with no dialout lines.
21.08.02 #       <TA> Guess it's time to 'patch into' the old company phone system again ... :)
21.08.19 #       <Cryto> TA: Well, for the sportsters, there IS a wizard on there...  Not sure about the other versions tho..  I got mine from them..
21.08.37 #       <NiteFlite> I wonder if I buy an Opalvision will I use it, or will it sit in the corner.  
21.08.53 #       <TA> all our phones are digital multi-line, but the lines all terminate right behind a closet wall.  :)
21.08.55 #       <Cryto> NiteFlite: What are you planning on using it for?
21.09.21 #       <NiteFlite> Cryto: That's just it.... dunno.  I guess if I could find a Roaster chip I would be in business.
21.09.30 #       <TA> NiteFlite: Asha uses one for painting, but also switches that with her gfx card now when she isn't painting I think.
21.09.36 #       <Cryto> NiteFlite: Dunno if roasters ever came out.  I never followed it much...
21.10.01 #       <NiteFlite> Cryto:  A few prototypes did make it out.  Very rare indeed.
21.10.38 #       <Arvid> NIteFlite : as rare as A3000+ machines?
21.10.41 #       <Cryto> NiteFlite: Well, I doubt you will find one then.. :)
21.10.47 #       <NiteFlite> Has anyone tried to go to Eric Schwartz's web page recently?  I get a DNS failure.
21.11.15 #       <NiteFlite> Arvid:  I came this close to seeing one when I went to Dave Haynie's house for a PIOS interview.
21.11.32 #       <Arvid> NiteFlite: I hear that he has two
21.11.48 #       <Cryto> I would love to have a fully working A3000+ MB to drop into my A3k case.  That would rule. :)
21.11.52 #       <Womble> Skal Loret got one, I thought
21.12.07 #       <Arvid> Womble: yes he does
21.12.07 #       <TA> didn't skal get one of Dave's?
21.12.14 #       <NiteFlite> Problem is that on the 3000+, the built in scan doubler is disabled and the DSP dont work.
21.12.15 #       <Womble> Yes, that's what I thought
21.12.17 #       <Cryto> Skal got one?  Damn!  Where does Skal live?!?!?! :)
21.12.20 #       <Arvid> skal told me that he has one and Dave H has two
21.12.21 #       <TA> speaking of skal, anyone heard from that rascal?
21.12.23 #       <Womble> Oh
21.12.35 #       <Womble> So what exactly is the point of the 3000+?
21.12.45 #       <NiteFlite> Womble: I guess a 3000 with AGA.
21.12.49 #       <Cryto> NiteFlite: So what?  I have a Gfx board..  Only use the 31 KHz port for the boot menu.
21.12.50 #       <Arvid> Womble: it is cool
21.12.56 #       <Womble> NiteFlite: Oh, I didn't realise it had AGA
21.13.18 #       <TA> NiteFlite: But aga is slower than a gfx card.
21.13.41 #       <Arvid> <-- saw a Picasso IV at a friend's house last Saturday .. wow
21.13.49 #       <Cryto> TA: Yeah, but still, can run AGA only games.  Besides, it would rule to have one. :)
21.14.06 #       <NiteFlite> TA:  True, it's a collectors item at this point, like the CDTV+
21.14.14 #       <Cryto> Arvid: A friend of mine has one.. :)  I have a CV64/3D.  Would have saved for a PIV, but I got the CV for $115 shipped. :)
21.14.32 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I have an ECS A3000
21.14.36 #       * TA thinks cryto is bragging again ... :)
21.14.53 #       <Cryto> Arvid:  I have 2 of them, well, 1 has a GFx board and the 040.. :)
21.15.02 #       <Cryto> TA: Every chance I get.. :)
21.15.13 #       <TA> Cryto: Just before you found that one, I paid like $200 for mine.  :(
21.15.17 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I do have an 040 .. and sockets for 32 meg more ram
21.15.32 #       <Cryto> TA: BTW, get the schematics photocopied yet?? :)  I wanna see WHY this A3k's 23 port aint working right. :(
21.15.37 #       <NiteFlite> Anyone getting that CVPPC?
21.15.38 #       <TA> I need an A3000 accelerator badly, but not a ppc card.
21.15.45 #       <Cryto> TA: Not too bad, they are listed as $250, so..
21.16.06 #       <Cryto> I wouldnt mind a PPC card..  Just so I can do MP3's at full speed/quality. :)
21.16.25 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Thought you had a A3640?  How did you get the ram expansion on it?
21.16.27 #       <TA> will try to ship them out to you on Sat. email me your address again ... gpeake@wt.net
21.16.37 #       <Cryto> TA: Ok, cool.
21.16.59 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I do have a 3640  and a very elderly PP&S Zorro III ram board
21.17.28 #       <TA> Arvid: Is that 3640 slower than expected?
21.17.43 #       <TA> I was gonna get one and was advised against it for heat and slowness?
21.17.44 #       <Arvid> TA: not by any test I have found .. 
21.18.09 #       <TA> would I have to do the int2 line thing as well?
21.18.19 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Cool..  I have a PP&S 040 accelerator.  Its the one thats JUST the 040 board.  No ram/SCSI..  GOt it for free...  The thing is flakey.. :(
21.18.31 #       <Arvid> TA not on an A3640 .. that is needed if you have a SCSI adapter on the cpu board
21.18.47 #       <NiteFlite> TA: To put a 3640 in a 3000, it should be Rev 3.1, if its a 3.0, then you got to int2 it.
21.18.52 #       <Womble> TA: The 3640 has really slow memory access speed, that's the problem
21.18.53 #       <TA> Arvid: I may just do that then. Hal Greenlee has a couple for sale now.
21.19.36 #       <TA> Womble: What does that mean in terms of performance to a user? Makes me think it will slow my 3000 down?
21.19.39 #       <Cryto> TA: The 3640 is slow to ram.  They dont do burst.  Its a good card, just get a Rev 3.1 or 3.2 board..  You WILL need a heatsink, and you should cut a hole in the Drive tray, to put a fan there on top.  I used a powersupply fan there to blow air onto it.  The Int2 thing is for cards that have SCSI options on them.
21.19.47 #       <Arvid> Cryto: the PP&S ram works perfectly.  The software with it to test it always says it is broken, but it is not broken.  I found a ram test program on aminet which tests it just fine.
21.20.34 #       <Cryto> Arvid: How much ram can that hold?  I NEED more ram BAD....  And I have no way to add more, unless I find a board like that.
21.20.43 #       <Arvid> TA: on this A3000, sysinfo thinks it is a wee bit faster than a stock A4000
21.20.47 #       <Womble> TA: That means it won't be fast as it ought, basically.
21.20.50 #       <NiteFlite> Good night all.
21.20.55 Quit    NiteFlite (:Sleep time.)
21.20.55 #       <Cryto> TA:  System speed aint gonna slow down, just ram access.  It will be a bit slower, but you wont notice it much.
21.20.57 #       <TA> nite nite
21.21.15 #       <Womble> TA: It will still be faster virtually all of the time.
21.21.18 #       <Arvid> Cryto: it can hold up to 64 meg ..  it uses 30-pin simms .. 1 meg or 4 meg .. all four meg if you want the 64 meg
21.21.34 #       <Cryto> Arvid: KNow where I can get one cheap? :)
21.21.48 #       <Womble> TA: How much can you get a 3640 for, and how much would an alternative (PP&S?) be?
21.21.48 #       <Arvid> Cryto: there is a guy .. just a moment ...
21.22.30 #       <Cryto> Arvid: And do those things REQUIRE the Buster-11?  I have the older one. :(
21.22.35 #       <TA> Womble: I think Hal is selling them for $125 US. The 3640. I haven't found a PP&s, just the dang P5 cards that are out of sight.
21.22.41 #       <Arvid> Cryto: John Brackin is his name .. in Iowa .. I got mine from his post in csa.marketplace
21.23.04 #       <Cryto> Hmm..  He has more left?
21.23.16 #       <Cryto> I dont read usenet much..  Not alot of time for it. :(
21.23.23 #       <Womble> TA: And those will be used, presumably..
21.23.27 #       <Cryto> Maybe I should set up CNet again to start importing it. :)
21.23.30 #       <gener> be back in a few
21.23.32 #       <TA> Womble: yes, used.
21.23.35 Quit    gener (:I'm using «(Rukh Script)» v1.06 E-mail zuckuss@theriver.com to get a copy!)
21.23.54 #       <Arvid> Cryto: he gets and sells stuff pretty quickly ... I don't think he keeps stuff more than a week or so before it is out the door
21.24.20 #       <Womble> TA: *sigh*
21.24.43 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Ah..  Hmm, well, I really need to get a way to get more 32 bit ram for the other A3k...  18 MB aint enough..  Cant use the system, and run the Mac at the same time... :(
21.25.03 #       <TA> Womble: P5 thinks there scsi-ram cards are made of gold. Over $500 US.
21.25.05 #       <Arvid> Cryto: and the DKB boards show up for sale at times too
21.25.22 #       <TA> Arvid: Did dkb have an a3000 board too?
21.25.25 #       <Arvid> Cryto: but the fastest would still be a cpu board with ram on it
21.25.33 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Cool.  How much do those usually go for?  Wouldnt mind a 3128.. :)
21.25.42 #       <Arvid> TA: yes .. the 3128 I think it is .. it will hold 128meg
21.25.42 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Yeah.  I aint looking for max speed, just 32 bit ram. :)
21.26.14 #       <TA> hehehe, I may email dean and see if he has one stashed somewhere ... :)
21.26.17 #       <Arvid> I paid $150 (including shipping) for the 32-meg PP&S to John Brackin
21.26.26 #       <Cryto> $150?  OUch!
21.26.35 #       <Cryto> That is a bit steep..  Any ram on it?
21.26.42 #       <Arvid> Cryto: much less than a 3128
21.26.53 #       <Arvid> Cryto it came with 32 meg on board 
21.26.57 Quit    Jamesc (:Farewell Folks! Catch you on the Bitstream!)
21.27.05 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Well thats not too bad then I suppose.. :)
21.27.16 #       <Arvid> Cryto: it pleased me
21.27.18 #       <Cryto> A little better atleast..
21.27.55 #       <TA> well, off to bed again. The dogs are finally in and going to bed for the nite ... :)
21.28.06 #       <TA> see ya in the funny papers ... :)
21.28.14 Quit    TA (:http://web.nt.net/~gpeake/)
21.28.15 #       <Arvid> Cryto: I see the 3128s for close to $200 in csa.marketplace with no ram
21.28.57 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Ouch..  Wish the ram boards werent so high..  They are more expensive than Gfx cards it seems.. :(
21.29.21 #       <Arvid> Cryto: quite true. 
21.30.06 #       <Arvid> the guy in Texas I know with the $15 ISDN ran his A3000 for a while with  274 meg of ram
21.30.24 #       <Cryto> Wow..  Accel board and DKB3128?
21.30.43 #       <Arvid> Cryto: exactly 128 meg on each plus the motherboard ram
21.30.44 #       <Cryto> WOnder if you can have 2 3128 boards in at once, both maxed.
21.30.53 #       <Arvid> Cryto: yes you can
21.30.57 #       <Cryto> Cool
21.31.18 #       <Arvid> Cryto: he is also the only person I now with a true 66mhz 68060

21.31.52 #       <Seed> Hi Womble
21.32.00 #       <Womble> Cryto, Arvid: But the Zorro 3 bus isn't as fast as the memory bus
21.32.25 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Really?  I heard some of those were out..  Also heard some ppl say that you can take some of the newer 50 MHz 060's and clock em to 90..  I wouldnt do that myself tho.. :)
21.32.42 #       <Womble> Cryto, Arvid: So that memory may be a little slower than you expect.
21.33.01 #       <Cryto> Womble:  I aint worried about that.  My 040 board makes my 030 A3k slower than this 030 Ark.. :)  I just want more RAM, as long as its 32 bit. :)
21.33.41 #       <Arvid> Cryto: he knows people at Motorola in Austin (where he lives) like Skip... whatshisname .. and he got an 060 marked for 66 mhz
21.33.42 #       <Cryto> Womble: Cant be much slower than the ram access I have now. :)
21.33.42 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Cool. :)
21.34.30 #       <Arvid> Womble: Zorro III can have .. if I remember correctly .. up to seven wait cycles .. so no doubt it is a bunch slower than motherboard ram
21.36.27 #       <Arvid> The only program I've found which I can force to use the Zorro III ram is Art Department .. and it runs fine
21.37.07 #       <Cryto> Womble: What is the MAX speed of the Zorro-III bus?  (Sustaned)
21.37.17 #       <Womble> Cryto: I don't know
21.38.58 #       <Womble> Cryto: There might be info at http://www.thule.no/haynie/
21.39.15 #       <Arvid> <-- does a search for "Zorro III bus speed" on altavista and gets exactly one hit
21.39.42 #       <Cryto> heh
21.40.09 #       <Cryto> Womble: Ok..  I just wanna check something..  Wondering if a 100Mb/s ethernet card would be possible on Zorro-III
21.41.10 #       <Cryto> 040 A3k just somtaniously crashed... :(
21.41.18 #       <Cryto> spontaniously that is.

21.41.44 #       <Arvid> Cryto: is that 100 megabits or bytes / second?
21.41.52 #       <Womble> Cryto: Maximum transfer rate on that should be 12 MB/s, which is well within Z3 capabilities.
21.42.06 #       <Womble> Arvid: 100 megabits
21.42.15 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Mega BITS.
21.42.37 #       <Arvid> Womble: then you must be right ... Cause Zorro III should do 24 megabytes /sec
21.43.07 #       <Womble> Arvid: Is it really that slow? Hmm.
21.43.14 #       <Cryto> Womble: Ok, cool.  Someone once said it wasnt possible..  Just wanted to know for sure...  My dream, to win the powerball lotto, get an OC-12 connection, and have all my Amigas on a 100 MB connect to the net. :)
21.43.28 #       <Arvid> Womble: I don't know for sure, I read it somewhere months ago .. can't find it now
21.44.06 #       <Womble> Arvid: Well, Z2 is only 3.5 MB/s, so it's not too bad...
21.44.22 #       <Womble> Arvid: It sort of pales besides PCI's 132 MB/s though
21.45.26 #       <Arvid> Womble: I 'spoze that is true.  But you can have a bunch of cards on a Zorro III bus, and I think PCI limited to three or so
21.46.08 #       <Womble> Arvid: 4 slots on PCI, but you can always have multiple PCI buses (as in the PIOS ONE which has 5 PCI slots on two buses)
21.46.38 #       <Womble> Arvid: Sorry, I mean 4 slots is typical.
21.46.46 #       <Arvid> Womble: ah .. but I'll not ever even see a PIOS ONE in my lifetime
21.47.30 #       <Womble> Arvid: I think you can have 10 'loads' on a PCI bus; each card, slot, and motherboard device counts for one load. With two motherboard devices (CPU bridge and one other chip) you get 4 usable slots.
21.48.00 #       <Seed> you'll run out of IRQs first :)
21.48.20 #       <Womble> Seed: No, PCI devices can share them, just like Zorro cards
21.48.27 #       <Arvid> that sounds reasonable ... and all the Pentium motherboards I've actually touched just had three

21.50.30 #       <Arvid> about the same vintage as my 386 notebook
21.50.42 #       <Womble> Cryto: Ew, Win95 in less than 16 MB RAM. Not fun. Well, it's not much fun in any amount of RAM...
21.52.34 #       <Cryto> Womble: Heh.  Well, it DOES work..  Cant use a mod/mp3 player tho.  Crashes with memory parity errors, even tho all the ram is parity..
21.53.00 #       <Cryto> But, it works for what *I* use it for.......

21.53.10 #       <Seed> Womble: So are you getting any calls from girls?
21.53.20 #       <Womble> Cryto: I take it you don't know what parity means?
21.53.30 #       <Womble> Seed: Should I be?
21.53.51 #       <Cryto> Womble: I figured it was for the ram, cause it did NOT always do that...
21.53.52 #       <Seed> Womble: you will when they see the AF photo :)
21.54.04 #       <Womble> Seed: You reckon?
21.54.37 #       <Womble> Seed: Do girls read AF?
21.54.52 #       <Cryto> Womble: I used to be able to play Mods on it way back when, when I had about 8 MB of ram on it, and win31..  Now, it plays about 1 seconds worth, then dies.
21.54.59 #       <Seed> I think they don't read it :)
21.55.29 #       <Womble> Cryto: Parity bits for memory are extra bits added on to each byte (so you have 9 bits instead of 8) which are set so that there's always an even number of 1 bits out of those 9
21.55.36 #       <Arvid> <-- made a list a few days ago of female Amiga owners ... I've actually met about a dozen, and know some others from IRC
21.55.58 #       <Cryto> Womble: Well, all the simms are parity simms. :)  Either 3 or 9 chips.
21.56.12 #       <Cryto> Arvid: Really?  Got that list handy?? :)
21.56.13 #       <Womble> Cryto: When the memory controller reads memory back, it checks that there's still an even number of bits set. If there isn't, then one of the bits must have changed due to cosmic rays or whatever.
21.56.27 #       <Arvid> Cryto:: not here .. but I'll get it to you tomorrow ...
21.56.29 #       <Womble> Cryto: In that case it generates a parity error.
21.56.33 #       <Cryto> Womble: win95 muct have done it.. :)
21.56.40 #       <Cryto> must even.
21.56.45 #       <Cryto> I'll sue bill gates.. :)
21.56.50 #       <Womble> Cryto: Chances are, that error messages was bogus though, and the error was something completely different.
21.57.05 #       <Womble> Cryto: Parity checking is done at the hardware level, nothing to do with the OS.
21.57.09 #       <Seed> gotta go. see you all
21.57.25 #       <Womble> Bye Seed
21.57.27 #       <Cryto> Womble: Well, I dunno what it could be..  It either locks the system totally, or gives me the blue screen of death, saying memory parity error.
21.57.50 #       <Womble> Cryto: Oh, well maybe it is bad memory then, but I have no idea why it should suddenly happen when you run a particular program.
21.57.59 #       <Womble> Cryto: Perhaps it stresses the hardware in an odd way.
21.58.07 Part    Seed
21.58.11 #       <Cryto> Womble: Yeah, I know.  Windows sounds will play fine tho.  Its really wierd..
21.58.37 #       <Cryto> Womble: Maybe...  I should shoot it...  Course if I had the $$$ for a new pentium machine, I would definately shoot it. :)
21.59.18 #       <Womble> Cryto: Look at some of those MediaGX machines.. they are cheap, very cheap, but decent performers.
22.00.49 #       <Arvid> btw, I read just yesterday how to say the word for     eight    in Burmese
22.00.53 #       <Cryto> Womble: My problem is $$$ in general.. :)  Plus, I may be able to get a tower A3k, so I am saving for that. :)
22.02.19 #       <Arvid> no one seems to bite on that one .. so .. If a Burmese person and comes into the channel and says he is using a  .... shit .. computer ... it probably means he is using an eight - bit machine
22.03.15 #       <Cryto> Shit = 8 in burmese?  Hmm...  So they wonder why we call people eight-heads then??? :)

23.04.24 #       <Cryto> Thrax: Yep.  Pentium HS, and a power supply fan on top on the drive platform.  The 040 stats VERY cool. :)
23.05.01 #       <Womble> 040? cool? TMBSNMOTW "cool" OWIWNPA
23.05.07 #       <Thrax> <Cryto> hmmmm        no ram sockets or scsi device?

23.06.11 #       <Cryto> Thrax: Nope, nada.  No ram/SCSI.
23.06.34 #       <Thrax> kinda like the 3640 then....

23.14.56 #       <Womble> What are U202 and U203 meant to be?
23.15.05 #       <Thrax> i got some fresh salsa.....

23.16.44 #       <Dave_C> Gate Array Logic
23.16.52 #       <Womble> Cryto: For DMA from Zorro 2/3 to chip memory?
23.17.01 #       <Cryto> Womble: CHip memory
23.17.23 #       <Cryto> They get hot, and then you get bad Gfx and crashes on programs..  Least according to the info I seen.. :)
23.17.26 #       <Womble> Cryto: Yeah but DMA initiated where?
23.17.58 #       <Cryto> Womble: No idea.. :)
23.18.21 #       <Cryto> Womble:  Just the info I got, said thats one of the problems..  Those 2 over heat, and then things get trashed.
23.18.48 #       <Womble> Cryto: You see, when people talk about the DMA by the custom chips, that's actually bull... the chip memory is private to the chips, really.
23.19.00 #       <Womble> Cryto: Agnus is the memory controller for chip memory...
23.19.24 #       * Thrax planning on adding some micro fans to his a3000 MB
23.19.55 #       <Dave_C> Thrax: here's a texture that I spoke to heart about earlier...
23.20.00 #       <Womble> Cryto: It's just that the custom chip architecture is sufficiently weird that it's easier to think of what Agnus does as DMA
23.20.02 #       <Dave_C> seamless crushed silk
23.20.13 #       <Thrax> ohhhh     cool
23.20.16 #       <Cryto> Womble: Well, those 2 DO get reall hot.  And I suppose it can mess up the data when doing DMA..  I dunno.  Right now, its worth trying to fix..  When it gets hot, I have to turn the machine off..
23.20.23 #       <Thrax> gimmi gimmi
23.20.52 #       <Dave_C> it's the fabric texture behind my clickthrus
23.21.06 #       <Thrax> <Cryto>  where on the 3000 mb is that?
23.21.10 #       <Dave_C> think Asha would like the hue?
23.21.14 #       <Cryto> Dave_C: Send it here too, I'll send it to the other machine when I get it back together..
23.21.20 #       <Womble> Cryto: But there are two DMA-related chips?
23.21.35 #       <Cryto> Thrax: Right next to the chip ram.  u202 u203
23.21.48 #       <Cryto> Womble: According to the info I got on the net.  I dont know myself..

23.31.27 #       <Womble> Well, what can you run on it? Will there be any significant programs for PPC Amigas?
23.31.40 #       <Dave_C> Tornado3d is the only thing I've seen besides rc5
23.31.53 #       <heart> will there be Light...  Wave?
23.31.54 #       <Warfox> Hmmm.. the question i think is who will support Amiga...
23.31.56 #       <Womble> Having a graphics card for an A1200 would be nice, but it seems like an awfully expensive way to do it
23.32.08 #       <Dave_C> heart: NewTek and AI have been talking.
23.32.23 #       <Warfox> Baahh Ai.. 
23.32.31 #       <Womble> NewTek will support AmigaNG if AI can make it work
23.32.34 #       <Warfox> I don't believe too much in AI.
23.32.44 #       <heart> i meant with the PPC
23.32.45 #       <Dave_C> it was stated that 7 or 10 major elctronics manufacturers have contacted AI for licensing the OS
23.32.55 #       <Womble> Dave_C: No.
23.32.59 #       <Warfox> I've heard too much words in this year and nothing concrete
23.33.19 #       <Womble> Dave_C: The last four words of that are speculation.
23.33.34 #       <Warfox> The only concrete thing was the PPC board from P5..
23.33.36 #       <heart> what i heard at AmiWest convinced me to hold on    nolt that there was any chance of me doing otherwise
23.33.42 #       <Womble> Warfox: AI is going to have a good try at this. P5 will take you nowhere.
23.33.48 #       <Dave_C> well, there isn't much else to license at the moment either.
23.33.54 #       <heart> brb
23.33.55 #       <Dave_C> ;^)
23.34.25 #       <Womble> Warfox: P5 hasn't got the money to do anything much.
23.34.52 #       <Dave_C> and from what I've heard, they're running out of programmers rapidly
23.34.58 #       <Dave_C> P5 that is.
23.35.02 #       <Cryto> Wish P5 would come out wiht a SD that would work on the A3k. :(
23.35.53 #       <Womble> Warfox: PowerUP was basically doomed once ESCOM went into bankruptcy.
23.36.40 #       <Warfox> Maybe P5 is failing with PPC processor but i think new (Strongarm? Alpha? what?) processor will bring to nowhere...
23.37.10 #       <Womble> I have no idea about that.
23.37.12 #       <Warfox> It seem that IBM is pushing hard on PPC technologi...
23.37.32 #       <Womble> I did think that the PPC is the right way to go.
23.37.52 #       <Dave_C> well, everyone (ibm, motorola, etc, etc) are all talking about NEW hi performance multimedia chips next year, so it's not too far out to suspect that AI has something.
23.37.57 #       <Womble> For the desktop, it probably still is
23.38.12 #       <heart> Dave_C      yup
23.38.29 #       <Womble> I hope AI will do the right thing and make a portable OS that will run on PPC too
23.38.32 #       <Warfox> Where i work, we recently buyed an H50 server.. and i may say that PPC outperform P2 processor..
23.38.45 #       <Womble> However, it's just possible they've got a trick up their sleeve that we don't know about
23.38.45 #       <Warfox> Womble.. i hope so..
23.39.02 #       <Dave_C> A trick or 3, I hope
23.39.08 #       <Womble> Warfox: PPC750 is round about twice as fast as a P2 at the same clock speed.
23.39.29 #       * Cryto is gonna try to re-assemble the other A3k.
23.39.42 #       * Dave_C is going to bed... it'll be a long day tomorrow.
23.39.48 #       <Warfox> My questions is.. Why a large company that have a new superfast processor will give it to a completly new architecture? 
23.40.01 #       <Warfox> Dave_c.. where're you from?
23.40.02 #       <Dave_C> g'night all
23.40.05 #       <Dave_C> US
23.40.15 #       <Warfox> uh....goodnight...
23.40.17 #       <Womble> Warfox: Because they needed a new architecture to get it as fast and cheap as they needed??
23.40.20 #       <Womble> Night, Dave
23.40.21 #       <Dave_C> Originally from Atlanta, stuck in Redneck Central Alabama
23.40.35 #       <Cryto> Heat sink on the 040 aint even warm.. :)
23.40.40 #       <Womble> Warfox: I don't know, that's the obvious explanation for coming up with a new architecture
23.40.55 #       <Womble> Warfox: On the other hand, it could be we're bein led up the garden path on this one
23.42.14 #       <Warfox> Womble.. maybe.. but i think create a machine based on Linux instead of a near to oblivion OS will be a better choice... Linux is the only OS gaining space.. while all the other are loosing position amongst Winzoz..
23.42.52 #       <Warfox> Dave_c.. harg.. what time is it? Now here is 8.30 a.m...
23.42.58 #       <Cryto> L8r Dave_C 
23.43.06 #       <Womble> Warfox: That's not practical for consumer devices.
23.43.29 #       <Warfox> Womble... right.. i've not think on it...
23.43.33 #       <Womble> Warfox: Do you expect consumer electronics companies to print the GNU GPL in their manuals, along with information about how to obtain Linux source from them?
23.43.48 #       <heart> g'nite DC
23.44.12 #       <Womble> Warfox: Plus, Unix is not really all that brilliant. I happen to like Linux, but it's not the right answer for the market Amiga is targetting
23.44.55 #       <Warfox> Womble.. maybe but Unix is more robust and performant that any Wins solution...
23.44.56 #       <Womble> Warfox: I wouldn't be too surprised to see Linux used on the developer machine though
23.45.12 #       <Womble> Warfox: When did I mention Windows (spit!)
23.45.28 #       <Womble> Warfox: When did *anyone* mention Windows??
23.45.58 #       <Warfox> we've very few choice.. Linux..Be.. Winzozz... (the developer machine should have any of this..)
23.46.08 #       <Warfox> (ps... sorry for the bad english)
23.46.12 #       <Womble> Warfox: It won't be Windows.
23.46.16 #       <heart> i'm outta hee   bye ya'll   have fun!
23.46.22 #       <Womble> Warfox: At least, that's what I was told at WoA.
23.46.25 #       <Womble> Bye heart 
23.46.30 #       <Warfox> Bye heart.
23.46.34 #       <Womble> Warfox: I do listen to the right sources, btw.
23.46.56 #       <Warfox> Womble...where are you from?
23.46.57 Part    heart
23.47.01 #       <Womble> Warfox: UK
23.47.14 #       <Warfox> precisesly?
23.47.16 #       <Womble> There seem to be two choices to make:
23.47.20 #       <Womble> Oxford, England
23.47.39 #       <Womble> 1. What kernel to use on the developer machine initially.
23.47.44 #       <Warfox> I love England... By the way...
23.47.50 #       <Womble> 2. What kernel to use in OS5.
23.47.51 #       <Warfox> yep.
23.48.05 #       <Womble> Now (1) is not announced yet, and I'm guessing Linux may be used.
23.48.33 #       <Womble> (2) is supposed to be specific to AmigaOS, and based on the same sort of guiding prcinciples as original Amiga exec.
23.49.02 #       <Womble> There's a lot of confusion about this, but to me it looks very clear.
23.49.43 #       <Womble> I don't know how practical this plan to change the kernel from underneath at a later stage is, though.
23.49.49 #       <Warfox> Womble.... i hope OS 5.0 will be based on exec ideas.
23.52.11 #       <Warfox> turn back on initial question.. i need a graphics card for my A1200.. what i can do? Zorro Busboard and a Picasso?
23.52.40 #       <Womble> I don't know... it's terribly expensive, whichever way you try
23.52.47 #       <Womble> brb
23.52.51 #       <Warfox> yep..
23.53.26 #       <Warfox> I was thinking on a 1 Zorro slot board and a used Cybervison.. but it's hard to find one.. especially here in italy..
23.53.30 #       <Cryto> Trying to upgrade a 1200 aint easy, nor cheap...
23.54.02 #       <Cryto> Warfox: For a CV64 you need to have a Zorro III slot, as its a Z3 board only.  CV64/3D will work on Z2.
23.54.04 #       <Womble> b
23.54.48 #       <Womble> And shifting data from main memory over Z2 is even slower than AGA
23.54.56 #       <Warfox> Tnx Cryto..
23.55.04 #       <Warfox> Womble? Are you sure?
23.55.22 #       <Womble> Yes, Z2 is 3.5 MB/s while AGA is 7 MB/s
23.55.30 #       <Womble> AGA has a 32-bit bus, remember
23.55.52 #       <Warfox> Womble.. i know it very well..
23.56.09 #       <Warfox> do you remember Rally Championship from Flair?
23.56.15 #       <Womble> Of course that is reduced by the video refresh
23.56.38 #       <Cryto> Womble:  You know if the CV64/3D will do Zorro-III DMA?  Cause I have the older buster on my A3k...  JHust wonder if I will get a speedup?
23.56.38 #       <Womble> Whereas Z2 is not since that's on a separate bus
23.57.11 #       <Womble> Cryto: What would it do DMA for? I don't think it can blit from main memory.
23.57.49 #       <Womble> AFAIK graphics cards don't use DMA at all
23.57.57 #       <Cryto> Womble: DUnno.   I was just wondering if it would..  I aint too technical like that. :)
23.59.07 #       <Warfox> Womble.. what do you do il life? Do you work? Study? or what?
