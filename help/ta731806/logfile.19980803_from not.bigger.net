06.57.35 #       <Dave_C> same here
06.58.05 #       <Dave_C> since I had studied FORTH before, REBOL was easy
06.58.06 #       <dna> dave: also REBOL RRM's translator. Now I'm waiting for some Beta info. 
06.58.28 #       <dna> Dave: yeah? great! another one :) You know FORTH?
06.58.35 #       <Dave_C> especially without the revese ordered syntax
06.58.39 #       <Dave_C> I used to
06.58.54 #       <Dave_C> on my old 64
06.58.57 #       <dna> Dave: but this lead to more and  more questions ;)
06.59.03 #       <dna> Dave: C=64?
06.59.06 #       <Dave_C> I had the FORTH64 cartidge

06.59.49 #       <Dave_C> I had 3 of them and 2 - 128's
07.00.01 #       <Dave_C> now I have 2 A2000's and 3 A500's
07.00.48 #       <Dave_C> hmmm.. since you are on VMS, do you have a JAVA capable browser handy?
07.01.03 #       <dna> Dave: btw. Is that FORTH you know that FORTH used as language for Open Formware in CHRP HAL definition?
07.01.03 #       <dna> Formware = firmware
07.01.25 #       <dna> Dave: lucky man
07.01.52 #       <Dave_C> FORTH is still widely used for embedded app stuff
07.02.10 #       <Dave_C> due to its polymorphic extensibility
07.02.32 #       <Dave_C> PostScript is bassed on FORTH
07.02.47 #       <dna> Dave: hmm, I have not access to my emails, has it been something new from REBOL hq concerning REBOL beta?  I suppose you'r interested in REBOL beta testing
07.02.52 Quit    dalton3 (:I'm going out... Visit mine: http://www.arrakis.es/~balance)
07.03.15 #       <Dave_C> Carl sent out a notice that the beta team was being assembled
07.03.36 #       <Dave_C> I responded... but that's the only thing I've seen from hq or rebot
07.04.14 #       <dna> Dave: well, all I know about FORTH is probably that I have already told. I'm emailing with Hazy quite often, and he told me once we were discussing CHRP definition (and talking about PIOS one design)
07.04.50 #       <Dave_C> I do know that Asha's (from the FIDONET echo) hubby George got a JOB at REBOL.

07.14.32 #       <dna> Sometimes I feel like I'm 40
07.14.49 #       <Dave_C> lateral thinking is responsible for 80% of the world's greatest discoveries
07.14.49 #       <dna> define lateral, but it sound familiar
07.15.04 #       <Dave_C> across the accepted norm
07.15.12 #       <Dave_C> sideways
07.15.14 #       <dna> yeah, I thought so.
07.15.38 #       <Dave_C> I gotta run...
07.15.39 #       <dna> understood.
07.15.41 #       <Dave_C> bbl

09.10.17 #       <Bastard> oki, it worked
09.10.31 #       * Dave_C is watching the bpot 'spy function'
09.10.47 #       <Bastard> so have you had an Amiga a long time?
09.10.55 #       <Dave_C> since '86
09.11.20 #       <Bastard> I bought some of the latest A4000 before C= went belly up..
09.11.31 #       <Dave_C> see my page at http://gmebbs.cnetbbs.net/
09.11.37 #       <Bastard> I had before that seen the A500 and discarded it..
09.12.01 #       <Dave_C> A500 is great for midi keyboard systems
09.12.11 #       <Dave_C> that's what I used my 500's for
09.12.25 #       <Dave_C> I am on an A2000/o4o 
09.12.30 #       <Dave_C> w/ CV64-3D
09.12.31 #       <Bastard> I wanted and PC so I could code games for my C64 on it, But then I saw an Mac, and I discarded the PC and i wanted the Mac instead
09.12.47 #       <Bastard> oki
09.13.08 #       * Dave_C just ordered a 233mhz 6x86 motherboard to build a DEV_BOX froom
09.13.24 #       <Dave_C> I refuse to run M$ on it tho.
09.13.30 #       <Bastard> But when I saw the fast changing between the screen on a friends A4000, It was no doubt I gotta have a A4000, and so it became
09.13.35 #       <Bastard> a dev_box?
09.13.52 #       <Dave_C> the development system for AMiGA OS/5
09.13.53 #       <Bastard> Who makes the 6x86? IBM or Cyrix 
09.14.13 #       <Dave_C> I think it's an AMD processor
09.14.20 #       <Bastard> no... 
09.14.38 #       <Bastard> AMD calls them K5, K6 etc
09.14.45 #       * Dave_C is not really up on x86
09.14.48 #       <Dave_C> it's a K6
09.14.57 #       <Dave_C> but it's still a 6x86
09.15.11 #       <Dave_C> www.saveware.com
09.15.18 #       <Dave_C> $169 USD
09.15.24 #       <Dave_C> WITH processor
09.16.14 #       <Bastard> oki, im thinking on getting a PC with a 350Mhz AMD K6-3Dnow for games..-.
09.16.28 #       <Dave_C> I'll probably run RedHat Linux 68k until AMiGA OS/4 and the Inside/Out card are released
09.16.29 #       <Bastard> And let my Amiga do all the serious work
09.17.13 #       <Dave_C> put an Inside/Out and AMiGA OS/4 on that puppy and help out the development team
09.17.15 #       <Bastard> how owns these server?
09.17.39 #       <Dave_C> BeyondIRC net admin is DeSaDe.
09.17.51 #       <Bastard> How much will the inside/out cost then?

10.01.37 #       <Dave_C> depends on the die size and the technology used to gut the traces
10.01.41 #       <TranceTip> dna: it contained only some thousand gates... I don't think they have FPGAs now with 100000 or even 1000000 gates.

10.10.45 #       <Dave_C> PPC is going downhill
10.10.57 #       <Dave_C> maybe 2 years if that much
10.10.59 #       <TranceTip> gener: even if you did... there won't be any OS for it and software is scarce and rather expensive

11.15.36 #       <heart> i complain about it being $1.50 a gal. here    we spend a lot of time just driving around the hills and 4 wheeling so the cost of gas is aggravating 
11.15.40 #       <[Gemini]> we r the most expensive land in all of europe
11.15.43 #       <Dave_C> HAHAHAHA!
11.15.45 #       <AAlley> I use it to add up columns of money figures. I don't trust my brain.

11.16.24 #       <[Gemini]> we pay aprox 1.3 US$ r liter!!!!
11.16.48 #       <AAlley> Well, the Brits have those tiny little cars.
11.16.49 #       <[Gemini]> actualy its closer to 1.5
11.16.49 #       <Ogge> gem, and that would be in NOK?
11.17.05 #       <[Gemini]> depends on what gas u get
11.17.13 #       <phoe> and the cheapest Ford Escort (no air con, 1.3L engine) is about $17000
11.17.15 #       <AAlley> Norway pumps it's own oil.
11.17.22 #       <[Gemini]> but i were just in sweeden, and ur aprox 1 kr cheaper then here in norway
11.17.29 #       <Ogge> ok.. 
11.17.39 #       <heart> they use the mountains as an excuse for chanrging more for everything up here...   the fact that you have to cross one range or another seems to be a good reason to get overcharged!
11.18.06 #       <phoe> heart: HAHAHHA you think *YOU* get overcharged !!!
11.18.13 #       <heart> heheh
11.18.23 #       <[Gemini]> well, atleast ur goverment dossent take 75% of the prize of the petrol
11.18.28 #       <phoe> we have to pay a licence fee if we own a TV or video !!!!
11.18.41 #       <phoe> it's about $140 a year....
11.18.45 #       <[Gemini]> phoe: same here in norway, even though i dont pay it :-)

11.18.50 #       <AAlley> Gas in LA is $.90. 100 miles south, we pay $1.40. Go figure.
11.18.52 #       <heart> but what about all that NorthSea oil that my dad helped find back in the 70's?   ya'll's petrol prices should be low!
11.19.11 #       <phoe> Ogge: i'm in the UK too m8

11.19.27 #       <AAlley> Norways economy is based on oil. Without it, they would be screwed. 
11.19.37 #       <[Gemini]> heart: yeah, kinda strange that one of the richest countires in the world got one of the highest gas prises
11.19.47 #       <Ogge> gem, well they caught me once.. got some huge fines...
11.19.52 #       <phoe> the UK economy is based on screwing the population

11.22.38 #       <Ogge> AA, some lame excuse like "just bought the TV".. and the TV is 14 years old ;)
11.22.44 #       <heart> a roommate in Aberdeen got caught for that once
11.22.44 #       <AAlley> I can't believe Norway still kills whale for the oil...
11.22.56 #       <phoe> heart: yeah.. that's all bullsh!t tho - they just get a list of addresses and figure who hasn't paid

12.27.29 #       <[Gemini]> Rocambole: the EDO is the same prize
12.27.30 #       <Rocambole> how are you Cryto ?
12.28.15 #       <Cryto> Rocambole: Doing OK.  Still seeing how bad this machine is gonna overheat..
12.28.21 #       <Rocambole> [Gemini]: I have to buy one, that was cheap :)
12.28.36 #       <[Gemini]> Rocambole: why not get a 64MB SIMM?
12.28.37 #       <Rocambole> it's $66

12.29.53 #       <Dave_C> you have a PPS
12.30.11 #       <Dave_C> I saw the thing about how it would overheat in A3Kd
12.30.17 #       <Dave_C> and thought of you.
12.31.04 #       <Cryto> Yeah..  Whats overheating possibly, are the u202 and u203 chips.  They help with DMA to-from Chipram.  I swapped em from the other A3k, seems to be doing a little better, but still overheated them earlier a little.

12.37.39 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: whats the prize of a 32MB 72pin 60ns SIMM in sweeden now?
12.37.49 #       <Ogge> gem, w8 i'll check.. 
12.37.51 #       <AAlley> I just bought a 128MB 8ns SDRAM chip for $160USD. Dirt cheap.
12.37.53 #       <Rocambole> Cryto: I have blizzard 1230IV+SCSI board
12.38.00 #       <Merko> [Gemini]: 230-700 SEK. =D
12.38.14 #       <Cryto> Rocambole: Cool.  I only have the MB ram for the A3k. :(
12.38.15 #       * [Gemini] also wishes he could use SIMMs, but this darn GVP card only accepts GVP ram :-(
12.38.40 #       <Rocambole> Cryto: the SCSI board can take a 128 MB simm
12.39.24 #       <Jamesc> Is that problem common with all GVP Boards?
12.39.39 #       <Cryto> Rocambole: On your blizzard?  Cool.  Wish I could add that much to mine. :(  Sniff. Maybe I can find a dirt cheap (but working) DKB 3128 board... :) 
12.39.39 #       <[Gemini]> Jamesc: think so
12.39.47 #       <Ogge> woops.. it's the sdram thats cheap..  SIMMs are still expensive ;)
12.39.55 #       <Jamesc> Wow...
12.40.14 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: i just checked the prize here in norway, 32MB is 495 nok
12.40.22 #       <Jamesc> I hate to ask this.. But what's general opinion on the Apollo boards?
12.40.30 #       <Ogge> roc, the 1230 itself can take 128MB too and on the SCSI adapter u can add another 128MB .. a total of 256 is possible
12.40.31 #       <Rocambole> nok 495=$66
12.40.33 #       <Cryto> Jamesc: I heard they were a pain in the butt..
12.40.34 #       <AAlley> I love mine. Never failed
12.40.42 #       <[Gemini]> Cryto: never tryed one
12.40.47 #       <Cryto> Hard to get in/out..  But thats just 4th hand, so... :)
12.40.50 #       <Ogge> gem, 32MB is 425SEK
12.41.07 #       <beyas> is scsi port available for gfx cards? transfer rates are too high(higher tham zorro2s)
12.41.09 #       <Merko> Ogge: SDRAM and SIMMS are the same price, almost at least.
12.41.10 #       <AAlley> After installing it years ago, I have never removed it.
12.41.11 #       <Merko> Ogge: Only if you buy from somewhere expensive!
12.41.17 #       <Ogge> wrong.. 410 SEK for non EDO and EDO costs 315 ;)
12.41.19 #       <Jamesc> That's why I asked Cryto :)
12.41.24 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: okey, but i only checked one place, im sure u can get them cheaper then what i saied :-)
12.41.52 #       <Merko> Ogge: Check http://www.algonet.se/~jannep/ci/prices.htm

13.11.03 #       <Dave_C> well... the fact that Motorola is going to start making AMD K7's is another sure sign of the decline of PPC
13.11.06 #       <Cryto> I regged mine, and run 2.0.  The pirates didnt pay, and they have atleast 2.04.  That says something....

13.11.56 #       <Cryto> And, I hope 1.22 fixes IBrowses problem wiht the "Ask Once" for accepting cookies.  That dont work.

13.13.27 #       * Yoshi2 also hopes that Vapor will find some time to update their software
13.13.33 #       <Trolan> and so Motorola would manufacture K7.. big deal.  TI handles the manufacture of the UltraSPARC. Sign of better production facilities. 
13.13.59 #       <Merko> Dave_C: What MMC link??
13.14.03 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: What link?

14.12.17 #       <Dave_C> a digital port. Now you can play your music CD's in true digital sound with the Sound Pro. I think it has digital input also for true digital recording.  My newphew is in a band and does some recording in digital so he was happy to hear about that.
14.12.22 #       <Dave_C> We did a analog recording for him and it lost a lot of the high hats and
14.12.23 #       <Dave_C> had to be filtered.  They also revanped the board and added on more clock doubling choices so you can do the AMD K6 300 CPU's or Cyirx 300, so it is upgradeable.

14.38.03 #       <AAlley> Dave
14.38.15 #       <Merko> Well.. looks like they will bring some kind of platform.. what kind of machines that will actually come is unclear at best. :/
14.38.16 #       <AAlley> That's what Fleecy uses.
14.38.23 #       <Dave_C> but we can't answer NDA protected questions anymore than Fleecy or Joe can
14.38.36 #       <NoMaaM> and what about this november box ? is it really going to be here in november and is the os new ? (wb4)
14.38.56 #       * Dave_C is building a host box for it now.
14.39.13 #       <AAlley> I, for one am proud to be NDA-free.
14.39.19 #       <portnoy> And is there going to be Java for existing Amigas any time soon?
14.39.21 #       <Dave_C> It's not specified as an ENDUSER machine.
14.39.25 #       <NoMaaM> so, it looks like the picture on the A.Inc page ?
14.39.28 #       <Dave_C> it's a development system
14.39.32 #       <NoMaaM> i know
14.39.43 #       <NoMaaM> but, I would still like to buy it
14.39.48 #       <Merko> NoMaaM: Forget the pic on the AInc page.. its just a bad photoshop job.
14.39.49 #       <Dave_C> that picture is clearly labled 'Artists Rendition/Conception'
14.39.51 #       <AAlley> The picture is not accurate. The OS has not been written
14.40.03 #       <NoMaaM> not been written ?
14.40.11 #       <AAlley> Nope
14.40.11 #       <NoMaaM> nothing has been dome yet ?

14.40.46 #       <NoMaaM> i was talking about wb4 ... ot isn't it wb ?
14.40.48 #       <Dave_C> Work is being done, but everything takes time.
14.41.08 #       <Dave_C> OS/4 is to be a bridge
14.41.23 #       <NoMaaM> i know
14.41.24 #       <Dave_C> The actual core kernel has not been announced.
14.41.36 #       <Dave_C> But that doesn't mean it isn't in the works.
14.41.58 #       <NoMaaM> will it be able to irc or internet ?
14.42.04 #       <Dave_C> I know, they said it will be Exec, but remember, they own the name and can call ANYTHING they want to 'Exec'.
14.42.13 #       <NoMaaM> so yes, will it run on pc software then ?
14.42.14 #       <Dave_C> Of course.
14.42.24 #       <Dave_C> You will be able to dual boot
14.42.38 #       <NoMaaM> kewl

14.44.40 #       <Dave_C> you can ask, but if we don't know or can't tell, there's not mch we can do
14.44.48 #       <AAlley> NoMaam: Wait until this fall. Nothing will be leaked until then

17.20.57 #       <SimD> hi steve
17.21.05 #       <SteveK> hi
17.21.55 #       <Dave_C> HMetal (Ray Akey) was on a bit ago, but pinged out
17.22.50 #       <Dave_C> He's busy converting all the CNet BBS code from SAS/C to C++
17.23.23 #       <SteveK> why?
17.23.55 #       <Dave_C> prepping for the next generation AMiGA (whenever it materializes)
17.24.21 #       <SteveK> I don't think you gain anything from converting from C to C++, except experience, I guess
17.24.22 #       <Dave_C> Havemose is hot for C++ and Java
17.25.15 #       <Dave_C> and from what I've gathered, the ng development system is C++ based.
17.25.24 #       <SimD> dave: does seem it
17.25.30 #       <SteveK> Having an OS interface C++ is bad IMO - it pretty much locks you into one compiler
17.25.47 #       <SteveK> since it's very hard for 2 C++ compilers to be compatible
17.26.05 #       <Dave_C> I agree, but I'm not running the AI show...
17.26.14 #       <SimD> steve: it's not as bad if they provide the source of the classes to the compiler developers
17.26.51 #       <SteveK> I guess not
17.27.01 #       <SimD> and i'd *hope* they'd do that
17.27.15 #       * Dave_C agrees
17.27.50 #       <Dave_C> SimD: My intercept mail processor didn't gate my 1st amigauniverse post to the subboard.

19.48.02 #       <Cacique> Hey all 
19.48.16 #       <Cacique> OK I have a help question
19.48.46 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
19.49.07 #       <Cacique> Under Dopus 4.11 I am getting a GURU 80000004 when I go to use the Dopus Config, but...
19.49.40 #       <Cacique> It only occurs certain times and, of course, I cannot determine when those times are
19.50.22 #       <Cacique> At one point everything is working fine and then I can't get the Config prog to work
19.51.31 #       <Cacique> I have tried using the config from a shell as well as using it only (clicking on it's icon) with and without Dopus running... same result
19.55.11 #       <Bobal> I don't know what the 0004 is, but the 8000 means it's a dead-end error.....fatal.
19.55.39 #       <Bobal> like $8007 is a dos library error.
19.56.19 #       <Cacique> Bobal: ya I got that info from The Guru info program
19.56.34 #       <Bobal> But II don't know what the 0004 is.
19.56.56 #       <Cacique> I thought I had the problem solved with the latest SetPatch but obviously not
19.57.19 #       <Bobal> The set patch from Amiga, Int?
19.57.28 #       <Cacique> ya
19.58.12 #       <Bobal> Simon....can you help?
19.59.06 #       <SimD> well, 80000004 means it's a CPU error which can't be recovered from, you using a gfx card?
19.59.22 #       <Cacique> Spectrum w/Cybergfx
20.00.04 #       <SimD> I seem to remember someone saying that dopus 4.x config program doesn't like gfx card screens, could be worth a try
20.00.06 #       <Cacique> When I upgraded from v3 to v3 is when I first realised the problem but like I sadi above I thought the SetPatch had solved the problem
20.00.25 #       <Cacique> uh should be v2 --> v3
20.00.42 #       * SimD may try cgfx with his spectrum soon, it may get it working :)
20.00.43 #       <Bobal> Gotta run...l8r
