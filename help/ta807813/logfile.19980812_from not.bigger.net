04.23.27 #       <Arvid> Dave_C: ah .. is there a JForth for clone computers?
04.24.05 #       <Dave_C> I dunno... JFOrth is 32 bit while most older FORTH's are 16 bit only
04.24.34 #       <Dave_C> it also can handle asm modules in either RPN or M68K inline
04.24.38 #       <Arvid> <-- admits to doing most recent programs to run on my clone notebook computers
04.25.20 #       <Dave_C> It will use older forth83 standards and has docs on how to make olderstuff compile to exe
04.25.35 #       <Dave_C> I'm impressed
04.26.42 #       <Arvid> <-- remembers that that is what the American sailors said to the British sailors early in the 19th century
04.28.22 #       <Dave_C> Small but distinct differences may be noted between the dictionary and CLONEd versions of programs, primarily due to optimizations that CLONE performs.   
04.28.46 #       <Dave_C> from the docs
04.29.20 #       <Dave_C> me is on Chapter 7
04.30.15 #       <Dave_C> CLONE is the thing that recompiles the JForth dictionary to a standalone EXE

07.14.35 #       <Gozlingo> btw, I have lots of lag due to sending lots o' mail.. bear with me.
07.15.18 #       <[Gemini]> well..... i dont think i can help u... dont know the 1.st thing about IP filters
07.15.45 #       <Gozlingo> Are you the only person on here?? Or are them above you real :)??
07.15.57 #       <Gozlingo> or are they here
07.16.11 #>>     "is a bot" by [Gemini] (kimts@ti18a22-0071.dialup.online.no)
07.16.19 #       * Dave_C is real
07.16.21 #       <[Gemini]> and im sure u knw what ChanServ is
07.16.32 #       <Gozlingo> doh!
07.16.35 #       <[Gemini]> Dave_C: perhaps u can help him then :-)
07.16.49 #       <Gozlingo> Perhaps??
07.17.26 #       <Gozlingo> Gemini: Well you need the right filters in miami to stop nukes, that's why I want to make sure I get it right..
07.17.54 #       <Dave_C> You wanna make sure you don't get the DCHack, I take it
07.18.28 #       <Gozlingo> No, my problem is with the */*/* 127.0.0.1 line..
07.18.39 #       <Gozlingo> THe line that allows you acces to all your own ports..
07.18.55 #       <Gozlingo> If I do a portscan on myself, I should get access to every port should i not?
07.19.05 #       <Dave_C> I would suppose so
07.19.18 #       <Gozlingo> I get rejected on all of them..
07.19.34 #       * Dave_C scans Goz
07.19.55 #       * Gozlingo couldn't get more lag.. Anyone else want a go :)
07.20.19 #       <Gozlingo> as you can see, all rejected which is good :)
07.20.48 #       <Gozlingo> way.. nearly finished my mail..
07.21.18 #       <Dave_C> yup
07.21.23 #       <Dave_C> no ports found
07.21.36 #       <Gozlingo> but I should have all my own ports surely..
07.21.40 #       <Gozlingo> when I do it..
07.21.52 #       <Gozlingo> or is it different?
07.22.03 #       <Dave_C> the DCHack is the only one I filter as I have a telnet bbs and ftp and web page, etc
07.22.57 #       <Gozlingo> erm.. if you have a webpage with your ISP and block one of your ports, does that mean they can't see your webpage?!?!
07.23.15 #       <Gozlingo> or when people access your webpage, is it from your HD?
07.23.37 #       <Dave_C> I'd say protocol: *  Sevice: *  127.*.*.1 ACCESS: Y
07.23.50 #       <Dave_C> it's from my HD
07.23.52 #       <Dave_C> yes
07.24.02 #       <Gozlingo> oh right... Just checking I thought it must be..
07.24.23 #       <Gozlingo> so what would people have to put for a URL? 
07.24.46 #       <Gozlingo> your host name?
07.25.34 #       <[Gemini]> well... i gota run now
07.25.39 #       <[Gemini]> cya all
07.25.44 #       <Gozlingo> ok.. bye..
07.25.50 #       <[Gemini]> bye, bye
07.25.51 Quit    [Gemini] (:Hmmm..... what does this button do??????)

12.22.18 #       <[X_MaN]> about how the polic didnt take the rape cases seriously

12.28.31 #       <[X_MaN]> Im not sure that is fair
12.28.41 #       <[X_MaN]> Rue is not the most polite of chaps
12.28.52 #       <[X_MaN]> but he hasnt appeared in the same league as cooksey
12.29.00 #       <Rocambole> :)
12.29.27 #       <[X_MaN]> MAD RAPIST CHILD MOLSESTER PC LOVER is not in Rues vocabulary, oh and I forgot neo nazi...
12.29.48 #       <[X_MaN]> Cooksey doesnt even speak in coherent sentences;)

12.30.24 #       <[X_MaN]> Cooksey would have taken Gary on he is so stupid
12.30.40 #       <[X_MaN]> in fact cooksey would have issued deaththreats against Gary and his family
12.30.53 #       <Rocambole> he would have yes

12.32.08 #       <[X_MaN]> I know Mathias Ortmann exists, nu he is usually just a heavy cynic not a lamer
12.33.01 #       <Rocambole> well, it's nothing cynic about cooksey

13.51.38 #       <Ogge> fr, so i skated home and turned on the computer again.. (was traveling on my inlines as usual)
13.52.18 #       <kernel> What does everyone here think of REBOL?
13.53.59 #       <StG^sNTx> kernel: I don't know enough about it to have an opinion
13.54.13 #       <FrMan> kernel: REBOL ?? what's that
13.54.16 #       * Ogge agrees with Stg^sNTx
13.55.10 #       * StG^sNTx laughs:) This is supposed to be where the people with brains hang out, the people that can help others with problems:)
13.55.12 #       <kernel> FrMan: Check out www.rebol.com   - new language by Carl Sassenrath
13.55.55 #       <Ogge> well stg, we can't have everything in our minds.. 
13.56.29 #       <StG^sNTx> Ogge: well.. I feel i should know something
13.56.31 #       <FrMan> kernel:  I'm on Java actually I just get JForth today and you ask me to go on another new language REBOL
13.56.52 #       * FrMan wondres ahow he would learn all those languages at once ;))
13.56.55 #       <StG^sNTx> kernel: what language is it closest to?
13.57.05 #       <kernel> Well... this is apparently not just a language... it's a whole new concept apparently!
13.57.36 #       <kernel> I thought maybe someone here could tell me where it would be used!
13.58.03 #       <Ogge> there where ome rumours about using rebol instead of arexx in the next amigaos
13.58.49 #       <kernel> I'm sure it must be quite good, if Carl is doing it!
13.58.57 #       <Ogge> true
13.59.04 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
13.59.22 #       <FrMan> hu ... replacing Arexx ... hope it would be compatible because of all things wrote in Arexx
13.59.44 #       <StG^sNTx> Is there any demo or anything avail for a poor soul?
13.59.50 #       <Ogge> fr, don't think so.. have to rewrite everything ;)
14.01.15 #       <FrMan> Ogge Impossible ....
14.01.47 #       <Ogge> fr, well i don't think that much of the old software will work on the NG amiga.. 
14.03.25 #       <kernel> StG: It's suppose to be released in September!
14.05.26 #       <FrMan> Ogge do you know something interesting on new Amiga harware architecture ?
14.05.35 #       <StG^sNTx> kernel: ok.. just read "summer" on the page:)
14.05.59 #       <Ogge> fr, nope.. i haven't got any info on the hardware.. 
14.07.07 #       <FrMan> Ogge so how do you know if there wil be a compatibilty or not for today's software ?
14.07.16 #       <StG^sNTx> Ogge: be carefull with what u say now;)
14.08.48 #       <Ogge> fr, i think there will be compatibility but i said that not much of the old software will work anyway. I have that experience from my work at Ericsson and the software in their products..

14.26.26 #       <heart> well there is a UK company called EyeTech that repairs the m/boards  but trying to find someone stateside   or some very detailed instructions as to how to fix

14.27.21 #       <FrMan> heart:  :)
14.29.02 #       <heart> well as far as i am concerned they are irresponsible for selling m/boards and accelerators when they have had many complaints and the problem is known and documented   all they have to do is notify ppl purchasing the accelerators that there is a major problem with some m/boards    
14.29.08 #       <heart> <sigh>  heart just frustrated

15.59.07 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
15.59.42 #       <Seed> So, does anyone need help? :)
16.00.09 #       <Blitmanic> maybe
16.00.21 #       <Seed> Blitmanic: What is it?
16.00.51 #       <Blitmanic> What do I do when my workbench partision is full?
16.01.15 #       <Seed> Can you move files to another partition?
16.01.27 #       <Blitmanic> I`ve been thinking about installing MUI , how much room doesn`t it need?
16.02.08 #       <Trolan> my MUI install takes 2.6MB total, and that's including several 3rd party modules too
16.02.10 #       <Seed> it depends on the number of MUI libraries you'll use with it. and whether you want special icons and patterns
16.02.41 #       <Blitmanic> Maybe I been thinking about moving my Libs: drawer and make a change in the assigns does this sound a bad idea?
16.02.45 #       <Seed> Mine takes 2090 KB
16.03.27 #       <Seed> I wouldn't move Libs:  Maybe you should try to erase stuff you don't need in C: and S: first
16.04.14 #       <Blitmanic> Yeah but how much of MUI needs to be in workbench: ?  Can I install most of it to a different place?
16.04.17 #       <Trolan> or clean out anything stale in storage
16.04.37 #       <Trolan> none of MUI needs to be in your sys: partitiono aside from a few additional lines in user-startup
16.04.43 #       <Seed> Blit: MUI does not have to be in SYS:
16.04.54 #       <Seed> Blit: It can be on another partition
16.05.26 #       <Blitmanic> oh , what about Libs for MUI etc?
16.06.12 #       <Trolan> those end up going in MUI:Libs
16.06.13 #       <Blitmanic> How can I find out which libs I do not need in Libs:
16.06.38 #       <Seed> Blit: keep those.. you will probably need all of those
16.06.58 #       <Seed> Try compresing files you don't really need
16.07.16 #       <Seed> Programs like PowerPack or the XPK package could help you
16.09.52 #       <Blitmanic> No I might not need all my libs, because when I first got my hd I thought it was so big I copied as many libs to it what I could find
16.10.30 #       <Blitmanic> I was stupid back then
16.10.43 #       <Seed> How big is the main partition?
16.13.00 #       <Blitmanic> 380mb total ,  Workbench = 9.5mb (I think) , Work = the rest and is only 55% full
16.13.21 #       <Seed> ouch
16.13.39 #       <Seed> try to back up everything and re-partition
16.15.10 #       <Blitmanic> :/
16.15.15 #       <Blitmanic> no thanks
16.15.40 #       <Seed> Do you want to keep it as it is? :)
16.16.39 #       <Jamesc> Time to mess with Linux again.. See you later.
16.16.55 #       <Seed> Bye Jamesc
16.16.58 #       <Blitmanic> stuff from aminet , blitz and C++ source etc. It would be REAL difficult to sort out what I want and don`t want , and then a lot of Floppies
