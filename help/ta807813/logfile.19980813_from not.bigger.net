10.50.47 #       <Ogge> what?
10.50.49 #       <[X_MaN]> Shit mag, but it doesnt deserve to close:(
10.51.08 #       <Sterri> Dave_C: give the post a few more minutes
10.51.26 #       <[X_MaN]> then again maybe it does deserve to close, but is still should not have to:(
10.51.48 #       <Sterri> [X_MaN]: that leaves with ONE major UK Amiga mazagine. :(
10.52.29 #       <[X_MaN]> Sterri:Well the news it carries is little to of no use to a proper net based user, but it services those who are not on the net:(
10.52.53 #       <Gozlingo> :(((
10.53.07 #       <Gozlingo> What precisely made it close.. money?
10.53.20 #       <[X_MaN]> Money is not such an issue I guess
10.53.49 #       <[X_MaN]> I think it has more to do with the fact its readership fell so heavily, and it stopped being supported by major shops
10.54.04 #       <Gozlingo> oh well.. maybe there will be another one.
10.54.06 #       <[X_MaN]> It was no longer sold here for 6 months now
10.54.15 #       <Gozlingo> I doubt it tho..
10.54.16 #       <Sterri> I missent the teamamiga mail
10.54.24 #       <Gozlingo> X_Man: where is here?
10.54.38 #       <[X_MaN]> With the Amiga in the state it is, A new magazine is dead in the water
10.54.44 #       * [X_MaN] is from Cyprus
10.55.00 #       <Gozlingo> Hmm... Bet it's nice and hot in cyprus..
10.55.27 #       <Gozlingo> are we sure this is for definate?
10.55.58 #       <Gozlingo> What about the companies like power and blittersoft?
10.56.17 #       <Gozlingo> They'll have less place to advertise, esp. to those not on the net.
10.56.18 #       <Sterri> Gozlingo: the email UID matches Tony's UID
10.56.40 #       <Gozlingo> Oh.. maybe.. oh no, it isn't april..
10.56.46 #       <Ogge> where can i read about the close of CU?
10.56.59 #       <Gozlingo> Sterri: Could you forward that message to me?
10.57.33 #       <[X_MaN]> Its on the CU mailing list
10.57.41 #       <Sterri> Gozlingo: it's on the TAML now
10.57.55 #       <Gozlingo> I'm not tho.. I think I'm waiting to be approved..
10.58.02 #       <[X_MaN]> Gozlingo:Amiga companies have had ZERO place to advertise recntly 
10.58.05 #       <[X_MaN]> or just about zero
10.58.06 #       <Ogge> there's nothing on their homepage about it.

11.09.43 #       <Sterri> [X_MaN]: wrong, the ABC figures showed that the CU sells more than AF recently.

11.10.35 #       <Sterri> [X_MaN]: has been since May
11.11.10 #       <[X_MaN]> Sterri:wow they finally had higher numbers;)
11.11.20 #       <[X_MaN]> And then they closed...
11.11.36 #       <Gozlingo> this is quite devastating..
11.11.38 #       <Dave_C> X: makes a lot of sense....
11.11.41 #       <Dave_C> NOT

11.12.26 #       <[X_MaN]> Sorrry to hear that Gem
11.12.35 #       <Sterri> you got to have something that reflects the news in the Amiga community in the topic.
11.12.55 #       <Ogge> gem, bummer.. what modem r u using now?
11.12.56 #       <[Gemini]> yeah... all my 33.2 modem do when i turn it on is make a high realy irritating noise
11.13.08 #       * Gozlingo has had trouble with lightning that blew his answering machine sky high.. Still, my 14.4k is intact :)
11.13.10 #       <[X_MaN]> Sterri:Im sorry to say but CU aMiga has not reflected Amiga news for almost three years...
11.13.30 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: my old 28.8
11.13.48 #       * Dave_C doesn't worry about the mags - they're 2-3 months behind anyway...
11.14.23 #       <[X_MaN]> Dave:yeps, I got into a discussion with Korn about that, he claimed to be more advanced than net news...
11.14.38 #       <Dave_C> pbbbbffftttt!
11.15.12 #       <Dave_C> only ONE way that a mag can out do us, and that's w/ inside info, and well, we have the inside folks.
11.15.18 #       * [X_MaN] is hoping people really will miss CU, but Im guessing that the majority stopped reading CU a while back
11.15.52 #       * Gozlingo didn't
11.15.59 #       <Sterri> no mag, no support, no feedback to non netted users.
11.16.15 #       <Gozlingo> It encourages people to get on the net..

12.25.27 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Yep :)
12.25.32 #       <Ogge> thats it.. 
12.25.52 #       <Ogge> i'm junking this a1200 when the inside out board comes.. and use my pc setup for everything.. 
12.25.53 #       <Merko> I usually have >2000000 bytes of free chipmem.. dunno what snatched it this time..
12.26.16 #       * Ogge is jealous

12.27.39 #       <Ogge> hmm.. anyone got a cheap zorro board for a1200 and a gfx card to sell to me??
12.27.53 #       <Ogge> or even a cheap a3000 with gfx card will do.. 
12.27.53 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: I can't do 1024x768 with this monitor (14")...
12.27.56 #       <Merko> Hmm.. 4 was too much, now they don't fit in the VRAM anymore. :(
12.28.04 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Buy an A3000, like I did :)
12.28.33 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: I can do 1600x1200, but the cv3d doesn't do it very well.. tried running ADoomPPC in it though. 8) 
12.28.41 #       <Ogge> don't know where i should put the a3000 though.. my desk is full of computers and monitors..

12.29.10 #       <Ogge> yep.. 
12.29.16 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Actually, it's more convenient, as you can move away the keyboard - my A1200 would crash if I moved it...
12.29.43 #       <Ogge> yoshi, using an old pc keyboard for my homemade a1200t :)

12.30.01 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: :)

12.31.30 #       * Yoshi2 won't buy a CVPPC - I look at the price of PowerUp and estimate that it is *way* to high for what's offered...
12.32.30 #       <Ogge> yoshi, have u seen my homemade a1200T ?
12.32.43 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Too high.. well that depends on what you want..
12.33.14 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: No L2 cache, only few software...
12.33.18 #       * Ogge thinks he will w8 for the inside out board instead of buying an A3000 with gfx card.. 
12.33.34 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Depends on your PC, I guess...
12.33.42 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: I must say I haven't missed the L2 cache a lot so far. ;D
12.33.57 #       <Ogge> yoshi, only a 166MMX with 64MB SDRAM at the moment.. but it will change.. 
12.34.31 #       <Merko> Ogge: I wouldn't hold my breath for that card.. but that's me of course.
12.34.32 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: It affects performance quite a lot, I'm told
12.35.00 #       <Ogge> merko, well i think it will be ok.. and hopefully it will be released soon.. 
12.35.10 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Perhaps.. it's LOTS faster than any other Amiga card anyway, I think that discussion about the L2 cache is insanely theoretical..
12.35.31 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: The memory is lots faster I mean.
12.35.35 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: Don't know...
12.35.42 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: Faster than a 3640, sure :)

13.02.06 #       <[X_MaN]> how r u?
13.02.15 #       <Seed> Hi
13.03.01 #       <[X_MaN]> brb
13.03.19 #       <Ogge> hey seed
13.03.31 #       <Seed> Hi Ogge
13.03.58 #       <[X_MaN]> Ogge:P2 233 is not that much faster than a P200 u know
13.04.15 #       <Seed> X_Man: I'm fine :)
13.04.20 #       <[X_MaN]> Oge:not enough imo to make the damn UAE go so much faster at least
13.04.20 #       <Ogge> x, true
13.04.36 #       <[X_MaN]> what is it at maximum 3 times faster?
13.04.53 #       <[X_MaN]> I doubt it even goes 3 times, more like 75%
13.04.58 #       <Ogge> the p2 233??
13.05.09 #       <[X_MaN]> yes
13.05.19 #       <Ogge> it depends on the bus speeds.. 
13.05.32 #       <Ogge> i bet the p200 uses a faster bus speed.. 
13.05.35 #       <[X_MaN]> so how much faster?
13.05.47 #       <[X_MaN]> ever seen a speed comparison?
13.05.59 #       <Ogge> think i have seen one at tom's hardware guide.. 
13.06.04 #       <[X_MaN]> I mean how much faster can a new processor really be than its predecessor
13.06.25 #       <[X_MaN]> it is not 10-15 times, which is what is needed to make it faster than my 4000 as I have been told

13.17.37 #       <[X_MaN]> Ogge:how many buffers does the partition have in the first place?
13.17.39 #       <Ogge> which will be as soon as the last 20 modules are downloaded.. 
13.17.54 #       <Ogge> x, only 20.. but i'll give it 1000 more.. 
13.18.10 #       <[X_MaN]> Ogge:giving it too many detracts from speed too
13.18.30 #       <Ogge> x, true.. but i think i read something about "500-2000 is ok"

14.23.42 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: ok:)
14.23.51 #       <Cryto> Petah: There is a stong Amiga following here too... :)
14.23.54 #       * Dave_C is still trying to figure out WTF Hembach is doing with his fingers still in the pie...
14.24.06 #       <Dave_C> I thought he handled the sale to Gateway and he was thru.
14.24.12 #       <Petah> Cryto: Heh.
14.24.46 #       <Dave_C> Now he's putting an injunction against QP forcing them to stop production
14.24.52 #       <Jamesc> You betcha Petah.. I reckon they should all come over here :) ... After all, how many servers are there on Amiganet?
14.25.01 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Hembach may still be trying to make money out of this...
14.25.08 #       <Cryto> Jamesc: Hehe :)
14.25.21 #       <Jamesc> And is there an Australian Server?
14.25.24 #       <Dave_C> If his legal involvement is dont, where are his grounds?
14.25.33 #       <Cryto> Dave_C: He's prolly related to medhi ali or Irving...
14.25.44 #       <Dave_C> JamesC: If you run beyondircd and apply to become a server....
14.26.06 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: What article is it? I can't find it
14.26.19 #       <Yoshi2> Seed: What article?
14.26.23 #       <Dave_C> Now if Gateway hadn't issued them a license, I could see it
14.26.42 #       <Dave_C> and they HAD a license that was supposed to stand THRU the litigation
14.27.35 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: The one he can't access
14.27.43 #       <Dave_C> If Hembach was supposed to be saving the AMIGA, he's sure doing a 180 by trying to close the main manufacturer
14.28.15 #       <Dave_C> especially after his involvement (legally) is over
14.28.20 #       <Jamesc> Well plug into irc.ggcs.net.au Dave :) .... But then, you aren't Australian, so there's probably no point :)
14.28.38 #       <Yoshi2> Seed: 980813a.txt?
14.29.24 #       <Dave_C> Jamesc: Are you linked to beyond or just stand alone?
14.29.54 #       <Jamesc> Hopefully today we'll be linked!!! :) Depends on the remaining vote...

14.34.04 #       <Dave_C> Yoshi: Do you have a reliable US mirror?
14.34.47 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: The main site is located in the US.  And then there's the mirror at Amiga.org - but you asked for a reliable one :)
14.39.02 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Why do you want to know?
14.39.32 #       <Dave_C> it's in the US>
14.39.33 #       <Dave_C> ?>
14.39.49 #       <Dave_C> I don't consider amiga.org reliable
14.40.04 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: The main site?  Yes.  All my homepages are located at Dreamhost.com, who are in the US.
14.40.15 #       <Dave_C> I was gonna see if we could work up an auto updating mirror
14.40.36 #       <Dave_C> I always hit ann.lu

14.40.50 #       <Dave_C> <nod>
14.41.11 #       <Seed> Dave_C: can you check my mirror and tell me how speedy it is, please?  www.seed.co.il/ANN/
14.41.15 #       <Dave_C> I can use CNet's IMP to intercept the mail, and route the index.html to the appropriate directory
14.41.23 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Only few people visit the mirrors.  Paul and Meni are doing a great job though.
14.41.42 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: There are also the articles that need to be copied
14.41.57 #       <Trolan> or use a mirroring script
14.42.33 #       <Yoshi2> Trolan: I never used a mirroring script, so I don't even know how these really work. :)
14.43.23 #       <Dave_C> I don't keep local news

14.56.52 #       <Dave_C> and from what I hear, he was surprised at how fast he was nailed.
14.56.56 #       <Petah> Yosh: If I have a piece of news I'd like to show up on ANN, do I have to post it to some appropriate newsgroup with in the c.s.a.#? hierarchy -more-
14.56.58 #       <Yoshi2> Hi Ogge 
14.57.03 #       * Ogge curses his HD.. 
14.57.11 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes
14.57.14 #       <Petah> Yosh: Or can I post the article in question  directly to you?
14.57.28 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: No, you need to post it.  This requirement is new.
14.57.40 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah. So I post the article to USENET and simply hope that you divert your interest to it?
14.57.47 #       <Dave_C> ANN will only echo the newsgroups...
14.57.51 #       <Petah> Yosh: Or can I point it out to you?
14.57.52 #       <Dave_C> no direct posts anymore
14.58.00 #       <Petah> Ok
14.58.08 #       <Petah> Hey, Seinfeld is on Letterman right now
14.58.21 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes.  The risk of being accused for news leaks is lower :-/
14.59.04 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: You can send the article viy mail or DCC; but I will only mention it as soon as I get it via the newsgroups.
14.59.09 #       <Ogge> cryto, r u here? i found out that the formating stops after about 5% in SS.. must be a bad partition.. think i've to choose another partition.. 
14.59.31 #       <Petah> Yosh: Okay. So I post an article, wait some hours for it to show up on newsservers around the planet and then send  you an e-mail asking if you publish it on ANN?
14.59.37 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah, I see.
14.59.49 #       <Dave_C> Ogge: Someone's trying to nuke Cryto and he's attending it
14.59.52 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: He was "nailed" as he agreed to have his name mentioned to take away some pressure to me
14.59.56 #       <Petah> Yosh: Okay, that's reasonable.
14.59.57 #       <Ogge> dave, ok.. 
15.00.04 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: ... from me, not to me
15.00.16 #       <Cryto> Dave_C: Actually I am FTP'ing from a site that is HARD for me to get on..  So I am PISSED...
15.00.25 #       <Dave_C> Yoshi: He forgot the Darx logs the channel and Gary and Fleecy both have access to the logs
15.00.41 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes, exactly.  You can also send the mail now.  The important thing is that I get it on Usenet before putting it on ANN.
15.01.05 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, there isn't any mail to send right now. :)
15.01.12 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Everybody's got access to the logs
15.01.15 #       <Petah> Yosh: There will be, however.
15.01.28 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Aminet
15.01.32 #       <Ogge> cryto, there are alot of such ftp servers all over the world.. always full or down..

15.01.38 #       <Dave_C> Yoshi: Yup.
15.01.44 #       <Dave_C> after I up them

15.02.06 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: I'm almost sure that he didn't do the leak on purpose
15.02.39 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: OK.  Although the numbering scheme will get confusing in a few months...
15.03.00 #       <Dave_C> I know, but it was from the ICOA closed list... I checked the ICOA page and it stated that it is NDA.
15.03.08 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: We'll see things like ta10011007.lha...
15.03.28 #       <Dave_C> the actual content was previously discussed, but it was simply that a complete doc from the list was passed out
15.03.42 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Yes, but how did he get on that list?  Gary Peake said you need to be developer to get there...
15.03.53 #       <Ogge> 7318 must be july the 31:st 1998.. but what the heck does 06 mean??
15.04.04 #       <Dave_C> ending date

15.04.22 #       <Ogge> ah.. 
15.04.36 #       <Trolan> make it 07310806 then.  :P
15.04.51 #       <Dave_C> Yoshi: Beats me... 
15.04.53 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: IMHO, it would have been more logical to just have a starting date OR ending date, and put it in YYMMDD format.
15.04.59 #       <Dave_C> I saw his name listed in the membership
15.05.24 #       <Dave_C> I may change that...

15.09.46 #       <Yoshi2> Dave_C: Blame the programs, not the people.  Microdot-II is handling stupid users just fine :)
15.09.47 #       <Ogge> sheeze.. 
15.09.55 #       <Ogge> isn't there better things to whine about.. 
15.10.14 #       <Dave_C> hey, it was Dr. Peter K who was whining the loudest
15.10.23 #       <Dave_C> and Joanne D too
15.10.47 #       <Petah> Yosh: Hm... it looks like http://www.ann.lu shows up as garbage when using the "alynx" browser. You may want to investigate this closer.
15.11.02 #       <Dave_C> Petah: Let me check that here
15.11.04 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: It's because of the many nested tables, probably.
15.11.47 #       <Petah> Yoshi2: Could be. This is the output of the seriously outdated ALynx:
15.11.48 #       <Petah> [TABLE] (Not yet implemented. Please ignore any garbage, below.)
15.12.26 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yep, so it's tables.  The only solution would be to make a separate version without any tables...
15.12.27 #       <Petah> And that's about it. Oh well, I'll just start IBrowse (another old HTML dinosaur)
15.12.59 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, a set of CGI scripts could easily build different versions of ANN.
15.13.13 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes, but I don't have CGI access ATM
15.13.21 #       <Petah> Yosh: Bummer. :(
15.13.27 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Besides, I never did anything using CGI/Perl/...
15.14.15 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah. Well, it's not that hard. Not that I've used it but... :)
15.14.37 Quit    Ogge (:Beam me up....)
15.14.38 #       <Petah> Yosh: If you know C, you know CGI. At least that's my interpretation of the CGI hype.
15.14.49 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I could do many things with CGI, but I'm not sure if the time invested would pay...
15.14.54 #       <Trolan> if you know C and are good with your stringhandling routines.  =)
15.14.58 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I know a bit of C
15.15.16 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I'm already using a combination of hsc macros and C programs to create ANN
15.16.19 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah. Well, you can use virtually any language for CGI access - at least any language that supports environment variables.
15.16.43 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I'd probably use Perl
15.17.09 #       <Petah> Yosh: AFAIK, a webserver sets a standard set of environment variables and then it's up to the developer to interpret this data in an appropriate way.
15.17.35 #       <Petah> Yosh: This in theory, of course.
15.17.50 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: The interesting thing would be to replace the standard index.html with an index.cgi that can be customised...
15.18.20 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: ie. index.cgi?look=lynx would create a version without tables
15.19.15 #       <Petah> Yoshi: Exactly. This technique allows you to e.g. monitor what clients the users are running, client IP-addresses...
15.19.49 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I do have server logs, so I know IP addresses, but they're not that interesting (at least not for me)
15.20.04 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: If I want client monitoring, I just check the WebTracker stats
15.20.29 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: http://www.fxweb.holowww.com/v2-fullstat.cgi?userid=A41159&password=Y1997
15.20.43 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, that's one way of doing it. I just pointed out one way of using CGI.
15.21.03 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: OK
15.21.30 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: But the interesting thing about CGI is that you can do interactive webpages, ie. pages that adopt to the user's needs.
15.21.55 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, as I've said before, ANN is truely outstanding! This with or without tables. :)
15.22.11 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I'm glad you like it. :)
15.22.34 #       <Petah> Yosh: Yeah, that's neat - customizable news.
15.23.12 #       <Petah> Yosh: Have you seen the MS Internet Explorer 4 "desktop components" feature?
15.23.25 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Nope.
15.23.49 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I only have MSIE3 through Shapeshifter
15.24.13 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah. Well, this "desktop" approach allows you to put up small windows on your desktop. In Workbench terms...
15.24.56 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I don't really like that concept though...
15.25.08 #       <Petah> Yosh: I'd say these windows would be "backdrop" windows on your Workbench. Every "component" has a timer telling the web browser system when to look for updates.
15.26.02 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, once you get the hang of it you'll probably like it. It's real neat to have a small desktop component (e.g. The CNN News Window) on your computer that updates itself.
15.26.02 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I guess this is mainly used by newstickers and advertisements?
15.26.13 #       <Petah> Yosh: Exactly.
15.26.20 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: But you have to be online all the time for that feature...
15.26.27 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well...
15.26.57 #       <Petah> Yosh: I don't think so. However, I havn't paid much attention to that matter as we have T1 connections here.
15.27.04 #       <Petah> Yosh: AmiTCP around the clock. :)
15.27.05 #       <Yoshi2> :)
15.27.53 Quit    HMetal (:Ping timeout for HMetal[wnd1-93.netrover.com])
15.27.54 #       <Petah> Yosh: I believe the webbrowser can deal with the updates all by itself, though. If you are still using a modem, you can request regular updates.
15.27.55 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I'm accessing the net via an 28k8 modem.  A leased line (don't know what speed) costs as much per year as a small car costs to buy...
15.28.25 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I prefer to hunt for the news on my own :)
15.28.51 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Most news are only updated once every day anyway...
15.28.56 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ouch. Well, don't you guys have... hm, like small apartments for students with permanent Internet connections?
15.29.18 #       <Petah> Yosh: Or apartments in general with Internet connections?
15.29.23 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: There are no universities in Luxembourg :)
15.29.28 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Nope.
15.29.31 #       <Petah> No universitets at all??
15.29.55 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Luxembourg is small, we all go to Germany, France, Belgium... to study
15.30.07 #       <Petah> Yosh: So there are no people in Luxembourg with university degrees then? Just garbage men and waitresses? :)
15.30.47 #       <Petah> Yosh: Heh. I get the idea. :) Well, in Sweden just about every new apartment that is built features some Internet jack in the wall.
15.30.50 #       <Yoshi2> Lots of people have degrees, but from foreign universities.
15.31.13 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Most nordic countries are more advanced as far as technology is concerned...
15.31.27 #       <Petah> I hear ya loud and clear. The European Union ERASMUS exchange student program comes in handy here.
15.32.09 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I think I was in Copenhagen through that programme two or three years ago...
15.32.38 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, I guess that's just a priority issue, really. Speaking of high tech, I just got a new cell phone - an Ericsson GA628. Swedish quality. :)
15.32.50 #       <Petah> Yosh: Really? What did you study?
15.33.02 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Nothing yet.  Highschool.
15.33.21 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah. I didn't know ERASMUS covered "pre university studies"?
15.33.23 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I'm a very lazy person, so didn't progress as fast as I could :)
15.33.41 #       <Petah> Yosh: Heh. Well, there's something I find familiar.
15.34.02 #       <Petah> You: Du snakker dansk?
15.34.13 #       <Petah> Yosh, that is
15.34.13 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Oops, I think it wasn't called Erasmus, but "Comenius"...
15.34.18 #       <Petah> Ah.
15.34.29 #       <Petah> Yosh: Yeah, I know.

15.36.30 #       <Petah> Yosh: The problem is the Danish pronounciation. They uh, "swallow" all of their words and you have this fragmented stream of words pouring outta their mouths. Impossible to understand anything.
15.36.30 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: It's 00:36 over here

15.38.28 #       <Yoshi2> hi TA 
15.38.30 #       <StG^sNTx> Petah: easier to understand swedish when listening, but think it's easier to read danish:)
15.38.37 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: I also speak english and german
15.38.38 #       <Petah> "Luxembourgish"? Heh, it sounds like something elves or dwarves would speak. Donald Duck language. :)
15.38.39 #       <TA> hey yoshi2
15.38.55 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: so you're more multilangual than I am :)
15.39.19 #       <Petah> StG: Ah. Well, written Danish and Norweigan look just about the same to any Swede.
15.39.19 #       <StG^sNTx> I would like to emphasize on "english" in the last sentence, as you probarbly didn't know:)
15.39.32 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: No way...  :))  Luxembourgish is a fine language, it's just that only ±350.000 people speak it...
15.39.35 #       <StG^sNTx> Petah: there u go:)
15.40.12 #       <Petah> Yosh: So this language of yours... is what, like a French dialect? Some German-Dutch combo deal?
15.41.05 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: It's not a dialect.  It's a mixture of German, French, but also contains many words that are "original"
15.41.06 #       <Petah> StG: Hey, do you how to say "can you carry my suitcase" in Danish?
15.41.25 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: You'd offend many Luxembourgers if you said "is it a Dutch dialect" :)
15.41.34 #       <Petah> Yosh: Ah. Sounds like a pretty good base if you wanna learn additional euro lingos.
15.41.59 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yep.  We learn German from age 6, French from age 7, English from age 13.
15.42.12 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, if there are only 350 000 of you guys I think I'd have a good chance in a fight. :)
15.42.29 #       <StG^sNTx> Petah: hehe:) english in main, isn't it? Kan du ta hold om min "koffert"?
15.42.56 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Actually 410.000, but not all speak Luxembourgish.  We have over 30% that don't have Luxembourgish nationality.
15.43.02 #       <Petah> Yosh: English from age 13?? Man, that's late! In Sweden you begin yer English studies in the 3rd or 4th grade... and many consider that to be late (including myself)
15.43.23 #       <StG^sNTx> Petah: I know how to make myself understood by a danish person. That might not be the same as to know every work of the language
15.43.26 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: We already learn German and French earlier...  
15.43.31 #       <Petah> st: Well, actually, it goes something like "Kan du runke min task". You know what that means in Swedish?
15.43.48 #       <Petah> Yosh: I hear ya.
15.44.05 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Besides, our direct neighbors are Germany, Belgium and France, so these languages are more important...
15.44.22 #       <StG^sNTx> Petah: hehe:) Ville inte passera sensuren;)
15.44.27 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: English is often only required for work
15.44.33 #       <Petah> Yosh: Now, that depends on where on the planet you are and to whom you're talking, right? :)
15.44.41 #       <Petah> StG: haha :)
15.44.41 #       <TA> heh! We start learing English at birth ... :)
15.44.59 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I was talking about Luxembourg :)
15.45.09 #       <Petah> TA: Yeah, and then you don't learn any other languages. Guess who's the big sucker here? :)
15.45.31 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: We've got lots of international banks here, so English is very useful there...
15.45.35 #       <Petah> Yosh: Heh. Well, it's not like Luxembourg holds every chair in the European Parlament, huh? :)
15.45.50 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Not really.  But let's not talk about politics :)
15.45.55 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: I just remebered another language I know; AmosPro:)
15.45.55 #       <TA> Petah: We are here, of course. Same with our foreign policy of selling arms and giving away money. We should build schools and hospitals and give books and medicine ONLT.
15.46.04 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: Hehe.  I know HTML :)
15.46.10 #       <Petah> Yosh: English is useful everywhere, hence my opinion that every kid in Europe should start learning English from the 1st grade.
15.46.35 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: so do I:)
15.46.44 #       <Petah> Yosh: No politics? Awright. :)
15.46.51 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: You don't have much contact with English people in Luxembourg until you're over 20, or so.  As such, it is sufficient if you start learning it at 13...
15.47.20 #       <TA> The US has made many mistakes over the years ...
15.47.41 #       <TA> We should acknowledge that and straighten up our act now.
15.47.51 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: If you travel to France, Germany, Italy, you'll often meed people who don't understand a single word of English.  Often old people, but also a lot of younger ones.
15.47.57 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, the world is getting smaller. The European Union is getting tighter every day and Internet is becoming a more important part for communication for every day.
15.48.03 #       <Yoshi2> TA: Every country makes lots of mistakes
15.48.39 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Sure.  Internet = English, until all Chinese can get computers.  Then, English will be a minority.
15.48.41 #       <TA> Yoshi2: We grew up being told we could buy peace with money and arms. We should have bought peace with schools and books.
15.48.53 #       <Petah> Yosh: I know about the French, they are... uh, "special" (to say the least). But still, I figure just about every young continental European speaks English, right?
15.49.10 #       <StG^sNTx> I'm outta here. "CU"? 2morrow:)
15.49.13 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Most do, yes.
15.49.43 #       <Yoshi2> TA: The US are/were at the top, and it's easy to look down on other countries...
15.49.48 #       <StG^sNTx> Bye!
15.49.49 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, I don't think China will threaten the English language in any way even if every chinese had a MMC sticked to his forehead. :)
15.49.50 Quit    StG^sNTx (:| I'll be back! Visit http://home.sol.no/~stgenius/ Always updated with amiga news and usefull info!)
15.49.51 #       <Yoshi2> bye StG^sNTx 
15.51.04 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: On one of my pages, I got 26000 visitors from Europe and also 26000 from Asia.  It shows that these countries are becoming an important market to consider
15.52.24 #       <Petah> Yosh: Of course. Still, I find it extremly hard to believe there is anything that could compromise English as the dominating Internet language, no matter how many computers the chinese get.
15.52.54 #       <Petah> Yosh: In fact, I'd say that's just about impossible.
15.52.58 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: China is a huge market.  Even with only 10% owning an Internet box, that would make way over 100 million Chinese users
15.53.13 #       <Petah> Yosh: Sure, but there are a lot of factors to consider here.
15.53.43 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Sure, but it's a fact that there's a huge market for non-English content.
15.53.50 #       <Petah> Yosh: First, you have the Chinese censorship. The government has to control what passes out of China, and what goes in.
15.54.34 #       <Petah> Yosh: Then you have to consider what interest people from outside China has in Chinese homepages, mailinglists... whatever.
15.54.55 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Agreed.  But the Internet cannot be censored, and I don't think the Chinese can manage to keep people from using it
15.55.17 #       <Petah> Yosh: Vice versa, you need to know what interest people from China has in foreign Internet services of any kinds.
15.56.07 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes, but these 100 million Chinese will have their own demand, and that demand is almost as strong as the demand of the (English-speaking) Internet at the moment.
15.56.19 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, even if we belay (sp?) from the censorship issue, there are IMO too many differences that stand between China and the western civilazation (Europe, North America, Australia...) -more-
15.56.58 #       <Petah> Yosh: for any actuall blending to take place.
15.57.01 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes.  But if there are interesting pages in Chinese, all Chinese will look at these pages and neglect English pages.
15.57.03 #       <Petah> actual
15.57.14 #       <Petah> Yosh: Well, that's my point.
15.57.38 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: Yes, but then major services will start doing Chinese pages, since it's a new and huge market...
15.57.39 #       <Petah> Yosh: The Chinese will probably target a different market than "Western" services.
15.57.57 #       <Petah> Yosh: Exactly. However, these are two different markets.
15.58.00 #       <Yoshi2> Petah: I don't know.  We're talking way too much politics again :))
15.58.18 #       * Yoshi2 is too tired to argue :))
15.58.42 #       <Petah> Yosh: I'd say that you'll have the "Western scene" and other scenes, such as the Chinese.
15.58.46 #       <Petah> Yosh: Heh.
15.59.23 #       <TA> my isp is a group of Chinese guys, They do a really good job here too.
15.59.27 #       <Petah> Yosh: Alright, I'll give you a break. Still, I don't believe any of us will need to learn Chinese in order to read ANN in 10 years. :)

20.16.56 #       <Arvid> Too late tonight to try everything .. but it somes with tcp/ip so I'll try it on the Internet tomorrow
20.17.45 #       <Arvid> The CD rom with software which comes with it assumes Windows of course .. but I'll be talking to it from the A3000
20.17.54 #       <Arvid> but it comes with tcp/ip
20.17.58 #       <Cryto> Thats cool
20.18.16 #       <Arvid> slick little box
20.18.43 #       <Cryto> What all does it do?
20.18.52 #       <Arvid> 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches X 0.85 inch thick
20.19.27 #       <Arvid> I dunno. Just got it this afternoon.  My kid got a new Palm Pilot III and gave me his old one 
20.20.01 #       <Arvid> Lots of software available for download ... three different web browsers and even an IRC client
20.20.17 #       <Cryto> Wow..
20.20.46 #       <Cryto> Wonder how much they cost..  Theyt have a built in port to plug in a 10b2 or 10bt connector?
20.21.02 #       <Arvid> it has a memo pad and calculator and such stuff
20.21.15 #       <Arvid> The one I have comes with a cradle and an RS232 cable
20.21.31 #       <Arvid> The newer one has an IR interface, too
20.21.59 #       <Cryto> Cool.  SOunds interesting.  Specially if it has an irc client in it.. :)
20.22.07 #       <Arvid> I've seen this Professional for $214 plus shipping, I dunno if that includes the RS232
20.22.29 #       <Arvid> The IRC client is available for download but I have not grabbed it yet.
20.22.36 #       <Arvid> Still learning how to do all this stuff
20.23.16 #       <Arvid> Learning how to get it to recognize my writing
20.23.43 #       <Cryto> Cool..  Good way to stay on the net I guess.. :)
20.23.43 #       <Arvid> Got the Amiga software from aminet today though
20.23.50 #       <Cryto> Kewl!
20.24.47 #       <Arvid> It will be interesting .. now trying to get a terminal program onto the PalmPilot from the Amiga ... maybe
20.25.16 #       <Arvid> I read that 3Com USR sold two million of these things .. I wonder if Motorola makes the CPUs
20.26.31 #       <Cryto> Maybe.  Possibly not..
20.27.06 #       <Arvid> Yeah .. my A500 .. ten years old this month .. came with a non-Motorola CPU, originally
20.27.26 #       <Cryto> One I had was the same way..
20.27.48 #       <Arvid> But the A500 has a Motorola 68010 in it now
20.28.29 #       <Cryto> Dont that mess up the clock?
20.28.43 #       <Arvid> Not at all .. works perfectly
20.28.48 #       <Cryto> Got a friend that has fast clock problems..  May have a bad CIA tho..
20.29.20 #       <Arvid> Very likely.  I read that some clock chips in clone computers have a y2k problem
20.30.07 #       <Cryto> Yeah..  Hope my A3k's dont.. :)
20.31.29 #       <Arvid> I read that the Amiga OS is OK until the year 2037 .. and I don't expect to last that long myself
20.31.50 #       <Arvid> And most flavors of Unix crap out in 2037 too
20.33.18 #       <Cryto> Heh
20.33.27 #       <Cryto> Well, I wouldnt mind being around... :)
20.35.12 #       <Arvid> heh
20.35.21 #       <Arvid> I would be .. lemme count
20.35.25 #       <Arvid> 94 years old
20.35.50 #       <Cryto> I would be 60 somehting.. :)
20.36.52 #       <Arvid> ah
20.40.40 #       <Arvid> OK!!!! I got the Amiga to read the internal list of files from the Palm Pilot
20.41.00 #       <Cryto> Kewl!
20.42.19 #       <Arvid> On the Palm Pilot screen it says          AMIGA made it possible
20.42.40 #       <Cryto> Hahaha, cool!
20.44.07 #       * Cryto is off for now..  Gnite. :)

20.54.39 #       <Arvid> <-- has the Palm Pilot and the Amiga talking to each other .. slick
20.54.40 #       <TA> heh!
20.55.45 #       <Arvid> The Amiga displayed the directory of files in the Palm Pilot and on the PP screen, it said       --AMIGA made it possible--
20.55.56 #       <TA> hahaha, too cool
20.56.48 #       <Arvid> The Palm Pilot being a 16 Mhz 68000 cpu machine
20.57.56 #       <TA> pretty neat Arvid 
20.59.16 #       <Arvid> It is the closest thing to a really tiny Amiga
20.59.34 #       <TA> Harv loves his.
20.59.58 #       <Arvid> ah gotta talk to him about it then
21.00.54 #       <Arvid> tomorrow I shall try the tcp/ip and get the IRC client  that should be a hoot
21.02.03 #       <TA> Harv thinks the palm pilot is the next best thing to Maccy D's.
21.02.41 #       <Arvid> I am not a fan of that particular place
21.03.51 #       <TA> Harv only eats out i hear from him ... :)
21.05.18 #       <Arvid> heh .. I wish I could do that
21.05.59 #       <TA> He told me once that his stove may have never been used.
21.06.53 #       <Arvid> heh again  i know mine has
21.07.14 #       <TA> yeah, I cook daily.
21.07.40 #       <Arvid> Not that I am a good cook .. but I can prepare Minute Rice .. sometimes
21.08.01 #       <TA> Cajun here. Even if I don't know how to cook it, I do.  :)
21.08.15 #       <Arvid> ummm
21.09.01 #       <Arvid> My kid, who lives somewhere out there in the area where Harv Laser lives, is a consumer of  Asian Restaurant food
21.09.06 #       <Arvid> mostly in Palo Alto
21.09.16 #       <TA> If it's dead, cook it. If it's not dead, kill it and cook it. If you can't kill it, eat it raw. Old Cajun saying.
21.09.39 #       <Arvid> uh umm
21.10.30 #       <TA> well, gotta fly.
