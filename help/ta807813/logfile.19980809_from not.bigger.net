00.13.55 #       <Jamesc> Are there any second hand A4000s on the market over in the US?
00.15.57 #       <Cryto> Yeah, on Usenet I believe.  I dont keep an eye out for em, Still kinda expensive.  I got for A3k's myself.
00.16.42 #       <Jamesc> True... Just interested if they've dropped at all...
00.17.34 #       <Cryto> About $400-500 or so..  Not really payed attention.
00.21.53 #       <Jamesc> Is that for A3K or A4K??
00.22.14 #       <Cryto> A4k
00.22.29 #       <Jamesc> Gee... That's cheap compared with here...
00.22.35 #       <Cryto> A3k's are about $350 or so.  Altho I am (Possibly) gonna sell one to a friend for $250
00.22.44 #       <Jamesc> Still, $A3,500 with a PPC card I guess
00.23.21 #       <Cryto> Well, a PPC card is about $1200 here...
00.23.27 #       <Cryto> (All in USD of course. :)
00.24.51 #       <Jamesc> How about A4K-Ts? They fetch more?
00.26.08 #       <Cryto> Yep. :)
00.26.14 #       <Cryto> Altho price, I dunno.

11.27.36 #       <[Gemini]> hey phoe 
11.27.46 #       <TA> isn't scsi.device also on rom too?
11.28.15 #       <TA> if so, you wouldn't actually need it on disk.
11.28.18 #       <Rocambole> TA: it must be, because when i use sysinfo it's there
11.28.40 #       <TA> and you wouldn't be here without it being somewhere?  :)
11.28.54 #       <Rocambole> TA: so was the 1230scsi.device too
11.29.15 #       <TA> 1230scsi.device in rom?
11.29.17 #       <Rocambole> TA: that's the blizzard thing
11.29.36 #       <TA> ahhh, you may not need scsi.device then.
11.29.36 #       <Rocambole> TA: that's what made me wonder
11.30.03 #       <TA> maybe 1230scsi.device overwrote the original?
11.30.05 #       <Rocambole> ta well, everything is working well :)
11.30.32 #       <TA> That's what counts.
11.30.34 #       <Rocambole> TA: but it's not in my devs drawer either, and that's puzzels me

Fleecy and he talked and the matter is now closed as far as fleecy is concerned. The post itself was not all that inportant, it was the idea that is was leaked from the mailing list that made it important. If 
11.40.24 #       <TA> a simple post can be leaked, that scares developers into not saying anything at all.

11.43.53 #       <phoe> Rocambole: it's more stable than IB on a vanilla A1200
11.44.15 #       <Rocambole> phoe: ok, I don't have a vanilla :)
11.44.25 #       <TA> Rocambole: I use V here on my a3000 with no problems, but I also keep close tabs on the cache and don't let it get out of hand.

11.46.49 #       <phoe> Rocambole: shouldn't it fall back to 1.0 if it can't do 1.1 ?

12.09.18 #       <[Gemini]> phoe: faster
12.09.53 #       <[Gemini]> wassent it 2 to 10 times faster then anything on the market 2 day
12.09.57 #       <phoe> [Gemini]: by how much tho...
12.10.17 #       <phoe> .. what about MIPS - they're pretty damn fast by all accounts...
12.10.26 #       <Womble> Expensive too
12.10.53 #       <Yoshi2> Processor speed is not (that) important.  It's the OS that counts.
12.11.03 #       <Womble> Sure it's important
12.11.12 #       <[Gemini]> wassent the price on the new miggys gonna b around $700?
12.11.21 #       <[Gemini]> or was it £700????
12.11.32 #       <phoe> Yoshi2: processor speed IS important - number crunching is what makes these flash new games happen, not the OS
12.12.01 #       <Womble> But all processors around at the moment are fast enough to run most applications you'd want to run if they're efficiently coded

12.13.06 #       <Merko> phoe: That's because the A1200 is so oooold..
12.13.08 #       <Womble> phoe: Well, 020 and 030 are obsolete...
12.13.36 #       <phoe> Merko: yeah, but you know how things go... it USED to be faaaast, but now it's lame
12.13.53 #       <Merko> phoe: But todays processors are 'enough' for most things except 3d rendering and video work..
12.13.55 #       <Yoshi2> phoe: Yes, but an efficient OS runs better on an 020, than a highly unefficiant one does on an 060
12.13.55 #       <phoe> we need something that can crunch numbers with the best of 'em to keep up with the future s/ware

12.16.01 #       <Yoshi2> phoe: If I buy the AmigaII, it won't be because of the speed, but (most likely) because of the OS concept

12.27.57 #       <Womble> 7000, I thought
12.28.06 #       <Merko> TA: Eh.. a couple of months after they were out there were 1500 anyway.
12.28.11 #       <[Gemini]> TA: iheard 5000

12.28.45 #       <TA> I thought so too, but 'laire' said on #amiga that the reason Frank left was lack of PPC card sales. Then he said only a thousand or so so far. There are about 7000 out at vendors I think.
12.28.46 #       <Rocambole> FrMan: long time no see

12.35.15 #       <Merko> Has anyone here networked an Amiga and a win95 PC?
12.35.33 #       <Arvid> and hi TA
12.35.38 #       <FrMan> Merko sorry I only networked an Amiga and a Linux PC
12.36.09 #       <FrMan> Merko but what is the prob anyway ?
12.36.11 #       <Merko> FrMan: I wish the person who bought my network card had wanted to do that instead.. I have no idea how to do it..
12.36.23 #       <Merko> FrMan: Well, what program would you use on the PC?
12.36.35 #       <Womble> If you use Ethernet it's easy
12.36.57 #       <Womble> Just run smbd on the Amiga for file sharing
12.37.03 #       <Merko> I do.. and he does too. ;D
12.37.15 #       <Merko> smbd? Alright.. and what on the PC
12.37.17 #       <Womble> Maybe nmbd too and you can make the Amiga into an NT SErver ;-)
12.37.27 #       <Womble> On the PC, you just need TCP/IP installed
12.37.39 #       <Womble> And "Microsoft Networking" but that's in there by default
12.37.40 #       <Merko> Womble: Which is?
12.37.54 #       <Merko> Womble: Ah.. so you just run this "smbd" thing then?
12.38.05 #       <Womble> Network protocol. If it has Internet dial-up networking installed then TCP/IP is already on there.
12.38.18 #       <Womble> So you get samba for the Amiga and configure smbd to share files
12.38.29 #       <Merko> Womble: Hey, I know THAT.. I just don't know what he does on the PC to make it work..
12.38.34 #       <Womble> You have to run smbclient on the Amiga (an FTP-alike program) to get files from the PC though
12.38.37 #       <Rocambole> TA: application sent
12.38.37 #       <TA> Womble: Did you find any accurate numbers on the PPC cards sold?
12.38.49 #       <Womble> TA: Nothing stated on a newsgroup yet
12.38.55 #>>     "find samba" by Womble (~womble@max195.public.ox.ac.uk)
12.39.23 #       <Womble> Aha, that's useful isn't it?
12.39.25 #       <TA> when laire said that on #amiga I was shocked.
12.39.42 #       <Womble> TA: What exactly did he say?
12.39.53 #       <TA> He also said he probably would not be continuing support for the datatypes stuff for cybergfx.
12.40.16 #       <Womble> Merko: To share files with the Amiga you say "I want to let others share my files" or something like that, and set up some shares.
12.40.36 #       <Merko> Womble: Yes.. and on the PC, I do nothing at all?
12.40.41 #       <Womble> Merko: The first option is in the Networks control panel, under "Microsoft Networking", I think
12.40.50 #       <TA> Laire said that Frank had left P5 because they had not sold enough PPC cards to support him and his family. I said that really can't be, and he said well a little over a thousand cards doesn't feed anyone here.
12.40.53 #       <Womble> Merko: You set up shares in Windows Explorer
12.41.35 #       <Womble> That number sounds implausible to me, but I don't expect them to sell more than a few thousand
12.41.38 #       <Merko> Womble: Alright.. 
12.41.55 #       <Womble> Merko: File sharing is inherently insecure though
12.42.07 #       <TA> I was shocked.
12.42.30 #       <Merko> Womble: Well.. I think he just wants to move files from his or a friends PC to his Amiga, so that's ok.
12.42.34 #       <Womble> Merko: Make sure you're up to date with Windows serivce packs
12.42.54 #       <Merko> Womble: Hey.. *I* am not using Windows. ;D

12.50.07 #       <Womble> You can easily afford for the price of those things...
12.50.17 #       <TA> The PPC card?
12.50.20 #       <Womble> And if you get Linux instead of Windows, you save even more!
12.50.24 #       <Womble> ;-)
12.50.41 #       <Womble> Then you can use the PC for a development platform, should you wish
12.50.43 #       <Merko> Womble: If you can get a PC without paying for win, that is.
12.51.08 #       <Womble> Merko: Easy, buy the bits and assemble them yourself. Higher quality, higher reliability, no MS tax.
12.51.22 #       <Arvid> Womble: how true
12.51.23 #       <TA> Youi can't here in the US. M$ has a contract with all the vendors.

14.47.14 #       <RMAIS96> In France, cable modem is for connection with numeric TV server but ADSL i don't know.

14.47.54 #       <RMAIS96> hi gio
14.48.06 #       <bbartlet> Gio, I saw a blurb on Wired Technology news about a program for the Amiga.  3D Modeling, supposed to handle all the accelerators and PPC>

14.49.03 #       <bbartlet> Also, they seem to be on the bandwagon for the new machine.
14.49.04 #       <Dave_C> bbart: That's Tornado3D.
14.49.10 #       <bbartlet> Right.

14.51.00 #       <Dave_C> He's in France and wondering about cable modem..
14.51.05 #       <Dave_C> no ADSL over there yet
14.51.12 #       <Azar> RMAIS96: What do you need to know about it?
14.51.46 Join    lmb [0] (lmb@ap0198.wxs.nl)
14.51.48 #       <bbartlet> bbl, out of smokes.
14.51.54 #       <RMAIS96> Is ADSL exist in France and what is it ?
14.52.23 #       <Womble> My other channel is much more interesting... people are making up obscene limericks about each other
14.53.03 #       <RMAIS96> What ADSL is connected to?
14.53.05 #       <Azar> RMAIS: ADSL is a technology that uses existing copper wire (like you telephone wire) to deliver 2.5MBit/sec downstream and 1.0MBit/sec upstream data
14.53.21 #       <Womble> Yeah, what he said ;-)
14.53.44 #       <Womble> The bandwidth depends on how close you are to the telephone exchange though
14.53.45 #       <Azar> RMA: Basically it's much like a modem only your wire goes straight from your house to the providers building
14.53.53 #       <Azar> Womble: Yes
14.54.25 #       <Azar> RMA: The modem has a 10baseT output, so you will need an ether card to hook it up.
14.54.46 #       <RMAIS96> So ADSL is connected to the phone?
14.55.23 #       <Womble> Not quite.
14.55.25 #       <Azar> RMA: What they refer to as "unconditioned private line"
14.55.46 #       <Azar> RMA: Basically, they remove the dial tone and run the wire straight from point A to B. 
14.55.56 #       <Womble> It can use the existing telephone lines, but not with a regular telephone connection.
14.56.01 #       <Womble> Hmm.
14.56.10 Quit    bbartlet (:Ping timeout for bbartlet[pool007-max2.ds10-ca-us.dialup.earthlink.net])
14.56.14 #       <Womble> I'll let Azar explain, he knows it better.
14.56.18 #       <lmb> Could it be used with cable?
14.56.24 #       <RMAIS96> Ok thank you
14.56.30 #       <Azar> RMA: www.adsl.com offers a great explaination of ADSL.
14.56.41 #       <Womble> I had a feeling they came up with 'CDSL' which is similar but on cable-TV-type cables
14.56.50 #       <Azar> Imb: ADSL & Cable modems are different technologies, but both deliver fast internet connectivity.
14.57.07 #       <Azar> Womble: I'm not familar with CDSL, but it's prolly the same idea.
14.57.16 #       <lmb> As far as I know cable could produce 10Mbit, correct?
14.57.56 #       <RMAIS96> Ok it's late, goodnight all.
14.58.09 #       <Azar> Imb: Not quite 10mbit/sec, closer to 5-7mbit/sec on an unloaded, yes.  If there are other subscribers on the cable modem loop, you have to share.
14.58.18 #       <Azar> Nite rma
14.58.28 Part    gio
14.58.45 #       <Azar> err 5-7 on an unloaded loop.
14.58.45 Quit    RMAIS96 (:Demo timeout)
14.59.04 #       <lmb> So if my cable company delivers to a 1000 members it would be slowed down a 1000 times?
14.59.40 #       <Azar> imb: Well, it's not a simple calculation as that.  Are you at all familar with a coax (10Base2) network?
15.00.07 #       <lmb> Sorry, no. I don't know anything about networks.
15.00.26 #       <Womble> It's dynamically shared
15.00.46 #       <Womble> Obviously when you are connected you don't actually use the modem 100% of the time
15.00.55 #       <Azar> imb: A coax network is like a daisy chained cable.  Since all machines share the same common cable, only 1 client can talk on that cable at any given time.  
15.01.06 #       <Womble> So the bandwidth isn't divided into 1000 unless all 1000 people are trying to use the cable
15.01.22 #       <Womble> (which doesn't happen)
15.01.38 #       <Womble> Anyway, I don't think they put that many people on a single cable
15.01.43 #       <lmb> Womble: so let say, a 1000 users are playing Quake. What happens then?
15.01.47 #       <Azar> imb: therefore, if you startup a download, the other clients will have to wait until that cable isn't being used - like that brief moment in time between the sending of data and the remote computers response to say it got it.
15.01.50 #       <Womble> Well, they won't.
15.02.05 #       <Womble> Azar: No, they won't.
15.02.34 #       <Womble> Azar: It's switched like Ethernet, divided into packets of about 1500 bytes (plus Ethernet frame)
15.02.59 #       <Azar> Womble: Well, technically yes, the MTU and frame comes into play.
15.03.32 #       <Trolan> it's a bus setup.  one person sending a packet at a time, not too bad with normal traffic and 20-30 people on a single segment.
15.03.37 #       <Azar> Womble: But the point is it's a shared arrangement, so the more traffic on it, the less bandwidth.
15.03.51 #       <Womble> Yeah...whatever
15.04.06 #       <lmb> And with bandwith you mean less cps download?
15.04.20 #       <Azar> The only problem is they tend to over subscribe segments.
15.04.38 #       <Azar> brb
15.06.43 #       <lmb> Thnx, and goodnight, the clock struck 0 8-))
