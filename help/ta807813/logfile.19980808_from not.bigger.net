09.42.41 #       <TA> One is a proggy that sits in background and allows us to get mail from multiple servers/nets like Outlook does. It just sits there checking mail every so many seconds for ya. That way I can get mail from work and home at both places now.
09.42.59 #       <Dave_C> Gary: I cheat too
09.43.02 #       <TA> when new mail arrives it can screen flash or notify you.
09.43.20 #       <TA> without having the amiga client open.
09.43.28 #       <Dave_C> but all I do is put a .forward file in my userdir at the ISP and the mail all comes straight to the house
09.43.51 #       <Dave_C> all my email addy's have .forwards
09.44.00 #       <TA> well, I can't get mail from work and home at home without quitting one and logging into the other.
09.44.14 #       <Dave_C> sure you can..
09.44.22 #       <Dave_C> run multiple instances of AmiPop
09.44.44 #       <TA> and get a notify like outlook does thru one client?
09.44.47 #       <Dave_C> all kinds of ways to do mail
09.45.01 #       <Dave_C> you can do notification stuff, yes
09.45.21 #       <Dave_C> but it's not as elegant
09.45.28 #       <TA> yeah, but simple is better. Caldi's will let you add as many servers/addresses as you want to one client, less ram used.
09.45.52 #       <Dave_C> Of course I'm running CNet's SMTPD too
09.45.58 #       <TA> ahhh.
09.46.20 #       <Dave_C> You really need to set that up and play with it some.
09.46.39 #       <TA> Those of us using Thor or Yam with several addresses on several servers don't have that luxury.  :)

09.51.42 #       <Dave_C> it's a bit convoluted, but it works
09.51.47 #       <Dave_C> re gener
09.51.55 #       <gener> hiya dave_c
09.52.07 #       <gener> hiya TA
09.52.28 #       <TA> I see a need to set up a server once I register the domain name?
09.52.41 #       <TA> seems we could use that for all kinds of things.
09.53.10 #       <gener> so what are we chatting about
09.53.11 #       <Dave_C> actually, the domain would reside on Scott's server
09.53.36 #       <Dave_C> the web page could live there too
09.53.56 #       <Dave_C> then use CNAME to redirect like bbs.teamamiga.org to the BBS machine
09.54.09 #       <TA> right, but if I set my computer up as a server, maybe thru my isp, then I could have a teamamiga.net or something? There are all kinds of interesting things that can be done. 
09.55.05 #       <Dave_C> .net is available too
09.55.18 #       <TA> and there is something BIG that we need to be available for in the near future.
09.55.34 #       <Dave_C> all 3 are available
09.55.56 #       <TA> The reason I planted the seed about using this as the amiga help channel will become apparent in a couple of months.
09.56.39 #       <TA> I wonder how I could register the domain name, and somehow hook into bigger.net as another ircnet server?
09.57.00 #       <Dave_C> on teh amiga?
09.57.16 #       <TA> yeah ... it can be done. Casey has the setup to do so.

12.03.15 #       <heart> we mounted a fan on the outside of the trapdoor with an opening over processor    the chips are cool now

12.03.46 #       <Comrade> it's not being overclocked ?
12.03.56 #       <heart> hi Rocambole
12.04.05 #       <Comrade> Wait..is this a 1200 ?
12.04.06 #       <Rocambole> hello heart 
12.04.49 #       <heart> no...  came with 50     we tried clocking it down with a 33 crystal from another card   but that of course didn't work
12.04.58 #       <heart> Apollo 1230/50
12.05.26 #       <Comrade> aha
12.05.37 #       <Comrade> I had the same problem as you
12.05.40 #       <heart> usually it is a lockup rather than a hard crash
12.05.44 #       <heart> and....?   =)
12.05.46 #       <Comrade> yeah
12.05.48 #       <Comrade> well
12.05.58 #       <heart> the card was cheap but i would still like to get it to work  
12.06.04 #       <Comrade> In the end it had to be repaired, a chip was replaced
12.06.30 #       <Comrade> something to do with timing....but there was a batch of 1200s with the same problem
12.06.43 #       <heart> by manufacturer?     it looks as if the FPU was added later (sloppy solder)
12.06.51 #       <Comrade> it has to be fixed in order to use any accelerator
12.07.01 #       <Comrade> by a repairer
12.07.08 #       <Comrade> I think mine was wizard
12.07.13 #       <heart> ohhhh   on 1200 not card?     this is also a new motherboard   less than a year
12.07.20 #       * heart lost with hardware!
12.07.38 #       <Comrade> hm, well if it's not a commodore motherboard it should be ok

12.09.16 #       <Comrade> I'll prob. have to make it into a badge or something :)
12.10.29 #       <heart> well what amazes me about this card is how badly it is designed...  all the chips face downward towards the trapdoor and the door will not close over the card...     plus the unbelievable overheating    chips were almost too hot to touch befpre we added fan
12.10.43 #       <Comrade> yeah same with me
12.11.04 #       <Comrade> I'll be glad to get a pc ;D

13.23.52 #       <Rocambole> hello beyas 
13.23.54 #       <beyas> hi there
13.30.54 #       <beyas> anyone knows the mail resulted an ANN offline?
13.31.13 #       <Dave_C> it was up yesterday, afaik
13.31.14 #       <Merko> Yeah..
13.31.21 #       <StG^sNTx> beyas: yes, but it's back up now
13.31.23 #       <Merko> No.. 2 days ago?
13.31.35 #       <StG^sNTx> there's a messy there now explaining
13.31.45 #       <Rocambole> beyas: ANN was online again yesterday
13.32.13 #       <beyas> what was the content of that mail Kemp mentions as colsing reason?
13.32.21 #       <beyas> closing
13.32.32 #       <Rocambole> beyas: it's under NDA
13.32.50 #       <Rocambole> beyas: can't tell you the content
13.33.04 #       <beyas> what is NDA abr. for?
13.33.34 #       <Rocambole> No Disclosure Agreement
13.34.23 #       <beyas> but someone had read it, no one here read this under NDA containing mail?
13.34.56 #       <Rocambole> beyas: was disclosed by mistake
13.35.12 #       <Dave_C> actually, the info content was previously discussed in IRC, but the document itself was under NDA, irregardless of the content
13.36.20 #       <Dave_C> Havemose discussed all of it on IRC from Toronto.
13.37.05 #       <Merko> I didn't see him saying anything that specific on the kernel though.
13.37.19 #       <Dave_C> The problem was that a complete document from the ICOA maling list (which is under 'gentleman's NDA') was posted to the newsgroups and distributed w/o expressed consent of the poster and ICOA
13.37.50 #       <Dave_C> Merko: He did... you just have to sift thru the drek everyone else was hollering about
13.39.44 #       <beyas> do you know the subject of that material disclosed by mistake? is it secret? or subject itselp is disclosing sth by mistake? :)
13.39.51 #       <Merko> dave:Hmm.. well I might have missed it. Tho I thought I'd read everything he wrote. 8)
13.41.36 #       <Dave_C> He mentioned language
13.41.43 #       <Dave_C> he mentioned extensions
13.41.47 #       <Dave_C> he mentioned stack
13.42.11 #       <Dave_C> mentioned datatypes for industry standard formats
13.42.54 #       <Dave_C> It's just that the post was clear and straight-forward
13.43.44 #       <Dave_C> As I read it, I was saying, 'old news.... old news.... old news....'...
13.44.20 #       <Dave_C> A lot of info is out there.. you just have to sift thru it.
13.45.07 #       <Dave_C> I think ppl should focus more on OS/4 first...
13.45.36 #       <Dave_C> without 4, we won't get a 5
13.45.46 #       <Rocambole> beyas: we can't tell you the contense of it, sorry. You ahve got some of the tidbits
13.46.44 #       <Rocambole> ahve=have
13.46.48 #       <Dave_C> beyas: and it was about OS/5... not 4
13.47.12 #       <beyas> rocambole: okee, ic, i am now in 9th floor, window is next to me, i am afraid i cant reach to the pool when i jump :(
13.47.17 #       <Dave_C> 4 to me is the priority.

14.08.34 #       <Rocambole> no
14.09.03 #       <StG^sNTx> Yoshi2: I've connected 2 amigas using the serial port, but not with sernet
14.09.33 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: What program then?
14.09.38 #       <Yoshi2> StG^sNTx: Terminal?

14.13.36 #       <Suz> Yoshi2: I connect to the internet with the 4000, launch my connection scripts, Pronet starts up Mail: from the portable and all my mail ends up on Suzanne. Then I can take her off where-ever and read my mail offline. Bloody brilliant :)
14.13.38 #       <Yoshi2> Suz: That would be excellent.  Except I don't know where to connect the printers then :-/

14.20.46 #       <Suz> alanwall: There is no battery for the mouseport or any other port. There is a fuse tho'. Maybe that's what he wants.
14.21.07 #       <alanwall> Suz:yea the fuse!
14.21.43 #       <Suz> alanwall: I thought that might be it. It's a tiny little thing. The exact location I can't remember without looking through god knows how many documents.

20.55.05 #       <Cryto> heart:  Check tbe other chips around it for heat..  On mine, some of the chip ram DMA choips get hot, and programs crash, or graphics get screwed up..
20.55.08 #       <heart> haha  you even knew who i meant!!!
20.55.31 #       <TA> I haven't gotten to chat with him in awhile. I wish he would come around here once in awhile.
20.55.54 #       <heart> Cryto   know any sites with Amiga schematics   looked for some yesterday for my 1200 with no luck
20.56.37 #       <TA> www.nationalamiga.com used to have some and so did www.sharbor.com don't know if they still do.
20.56.43 #       <heart> i invited him around  but he is doing a lot of video work and driving around his new vette!   Still running ACME bbs tho i guess

20.57.36 #       <heart> thanks Cryto
20.57.57 #       * heart loading IBrowse    w/ finger's crossed...
20.58.00 #       <TA> heart: Lostman said he hoped he didn't offend? I told him you would have said if he did. Seems he thinks he may have said something stupid in channel?
20.58.34 #       <heart> lostman???  no way   he is one of the sweetest guy in IRC!!!  =)
20.58.36 #       <Activelow> I'm told it's because of my rev of my CPU board, it locks with my A4091 card...a Z-III SCSI-2 card..
20.58.58 #       <Cryto> Activelow: SOunds like maybe a 3.0 CPU card..  Mod it to 3.2.
20.59.06 #       <Cryto> (How, I aint sure exactly)
20.59.12 #       <TA> lostman said he had no idea you were a Lady (and a cute one at that!).  :) I clued him in.  :)
20.59.13 #       <heart> and you are right... i would have nicely said something   (nice the 1st time!)
20.59.45 #       <heart> haha   i told him that we met at AmiWest but didnt think to mention that i was female!   ooops
20.59.54 #       <TA> hehehe

21.01.19 #       * Cryto has a pic of himself..
21.01.26 #       <TA> Activelow: If you do the mod to 3.2 that will help tremendously.
21.01.31 #       <Cryto> Activelow: Hmm..  I dunno.  Look on www.nationalamiga.com
21.01.51 #       <Activelow> TA: what's involved in the mod?
21.02.29 #       <TA> Activelow: I think cutting a trace, but i am not sure. I found it on national amiga though. I was going to get a 3640 card for my 3000.
21.02.51 #       <Activelow> TA: I'll go there and check it out......

21.09.19 #       <Cryto> HI alanwall 
21.09.25 #       <TA> welcoem Mr Crandall!
21.09.26 #       <alanwall> hi all!
21.10.08 #       <TA> Cryto: having been one before (CNet counts). and we need ALL the cnet testers signed up. It is important for a coming project.
21.10.34 #       <alanwall> ok a fast ?I can not use voyager and this happened once before after I got off irc.Is this common?
21.10.49 #       <TA> it doesn't cost you anything, but any program you help test will give you the proggy free after development.
21.10.59 #       <Cryto> TA: Ok.  What all should I tell him in EMail?  Tell him you said I should send an Email?
21.11.09 #       <Cryto> (And actually I am a CNet Alpha tester... :)
21.11.16 #       <TA> alanwall: I almost always web surf after being here?
21.11.42 #       <TA> Cryto: Yes, just tell him I sent you so he can log you into the database and give him your qualification.
21.12.01 #       <alanwall> TA:no idea why this is happening but did once before
21.12.22 #       <TA> alanwall: Miami may be getting something screwy with your isp?
21.12.34 #       <Cryto> TA: Ok
21.12.52 #       <TA> Once in awhile, if my isp has a problem with reverse dns, Miami funks out on me.
21.13.28 #       <TA> Seems miami does a lookup for a reverse dns and if that fails, you may get online but some services don't work right.
21.13.29 #       <alanwall> TA:miami is working fine for mail and irc 
21.14.49 #       <TA> mail almost always works even when the reverse dns is screwed. But other services sometimes don't. It may not be that though. Have you tried replacing Voyager totally? and have you checked the MUI libs to make sure all of them are being found?
21.15.06 #       <Cryto> TA:  This is for IBrowse, or for several products?
21.15.34 #       <TA> Cryto: If I tell you I will have to kill you.  :) But you should sign up.
21.15.48 #       <TA> It is NOT for ibrowse.
21.16.09 #       <alanwall> TA:about the club site thing I'm working on-when it's done the seal group would like to put on your page-think it might be more suited for UGN.Thoughts?
21.16.09 #       <TA> Take my word it is a good thing to do.
21.16.31 #       <Cryto> TA: Ok.  So just request to be a beta then...  Ok..
21.17.10 #       <TA> alanwall: It doesn't matter to me. I  tried to get the seals to join and work with UGN and they don't seem inclined that way. So I let them join TA instead?  :)
21.17.29 #       <TA> Cryto: Yes, you won't be sorry. I promise.
21.18.15 #       <TA> alanwall: There leader has had a problem with someone in UGN? Don't know any more than that so I told him we would accept them if he just couldn't work with UGN.
21.18.24 #       <Cryto> TA: Ok. :)
21.19.40 #       <TA> alanwall: If you have a splatter brush in your paint program you could do a color for team amiga by just splatter painting the world I guess?  :)
21.19.53 #       <alanwall> TA:just think that you hold more favor with people than UGN!Don't know why anybody would not
21.21.17 #       <TA> alanwall: I think it has to do with the fact that the seals contacted me about doing the world map thing. I referred them to UGN. UGN told them 'we are already doing that so pass that back to TA'. They did and I said, ok then.

22.34.35 #       <Cryto> King^Dragon: Do the HD's show in the boot menu?  So, you have to pull them out, then put them back in??
22.35.26 #       <heart> >Thrax>   what slot is the VLab card in?    VLab is picky about which slot it gets
22.35.36 #       <King^Dragon> well, no nothing happenings, but I can hear the HD's fire up.  I first had a red screen when this first started...
22.36.04 #       <King^Dragon> well, I just changed the slot for VLab tonight
22.36.12 #       <Cryto> King^Dragon: You may have part of my problem, overheating..
22.36.12 #       <TA> King^Dragon: Red screen is rom probs I think?
22.36.35 #       <TA> King^Dragon: What slot is the VLab in when this happens?
22.36.46 #       <King^Dragon> also, it later turned to a green scren that samr day...
22.36.59 #       <heart> KD  >thrax sez> i know that \in the 2000 it had to be closest to the cpu and in the 3000 (not tower) one of the top 2 slots
22.37.08 #       <King^Dragon> lets see, it was in the 3rd slot
22.37.21 #       <King^Dragon> now it's in the 2nd slot
22.37.26 #       <TA> King^Dragon: Put VLab in the second slot and Opal in the first.
22.37.29 #       <heart> red=ROM error
22.37.37 #       <King^Dragon> right next to my OV card
22.37.46 #       <heart> Opal into video slot
22.37.48 #       <TA> King^Dragon: yes.
22.38.05 #       <King^Dragon> oh great, but it works after I reinstall the cards?
22.38.17 #       <King^Dragon> right heart 
22.38.20 #       <TA> Video slot should be first=Opal, then VLab=2nd.
22.38.28 #       <Cryto> King^Dragon: It may be because its cooled down a bit.. :)
22.38.37 #       <King^Dragon> that's what I got it as now
22.39.09 #       <heart> TA  Thrax nods
22.39.18 #       <TA> King^Dragon: In my 3000, I had to buy a fan card (plastic and powers from the drive power sockets) and that is in one of my slots now. I get icicles inside the 3000 now.
22.39.22 #       <King^Dragon> could be, I do have my tower case cover off which might make it not as cool
22.39.52 #       <TA> King^Dragon: My 3000 always overheats with the case open too.
22.39.56 #       <Cryto> TA: I need to get one of those...
22.40.12 #       <King^Dragon> it doesn't suck the cool air though it as well as I think it could...
22.40.16 #       <TruKr> KD: if you run woth cover off you should have fan blowing in it to cool it
22.40.18 #       <TA> Cryto: I paid $19.95 for mine. Dual fan, blows right on teh cards and slot.
22.40.46 #       <King^Dragon> right TA I was thinking that today, hehe
