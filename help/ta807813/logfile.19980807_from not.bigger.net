00.00.25 #       <Womble> Warfox: I finished my first degree two months ago and have been looking for a job.
00.00.31 #       <Womble> Warfox: I got an offer yesterday :-)
00.01.10 #       <Womble> Warfox: So, I should be moving to Cambridge to work as a Software Engineer.
00.01.30 #       <Cryto> Wonder if tachy glue is flamable.... :)
00.01.50 #       <Cryto> Thinking of glueing a heatsink/fan onto those 2 chips to see if it helps. :)
00.02.21 #       <Womble> I'm told there is such a thing as 'thermal adhesive' that should be used to attach heatsinks
00.02.31 #       <Womble> It's a thermal conductor, unlike most glues
00.02.40 #       <Womble> good thermal conductor, that is
00.03.11 #       <Womble> I used to have a problem with Alice getting very hot
00.03.29 #       <Cryto> Well, I would remove the little C= sticker with the C= part # on it tho. :(  But, I just want the HS to stay put, it seems to keep it cool enough wiht just the thing on it.
00.03.38 #       <Warfox> Anyone tried to Overclock a a pentium processor?
00.03.41 #       <Womble> It made 35 ns modes start to break up
00.04.07 #       <Womble> It's about time I logged off
00.04.12 #       <Cryto> Womble: What 35 ns modes?  Gfx modes??
00.04.19 #       <Warfox> Cya Womble...
00.04.21 #       <Womble> Cryto: Yes, like Productivity
00.04.28 #       <Womble> Bye all
00.04.31 Quit    Womble (:Goodbye all)
00.04.49 #       <Warfox> It's time that i start to work too..

10.28.04 #       <Dave_C> longtimer tho
10.28.11 #       <phoe> ahh oh well.. just a weird prob i'm trying to solve for a maxs door !
10.28.13 #       <Dave_C> started w/ 2.19
10.28.25 #       <Dave_C> in C or rexx?
10.28.31 #       <phoe> worse - Amos !!!
10.28.39 #       <Dave_C> AMOS... YUCK..
10.28.57 #       <Dave_C> present version o f CNet is 4.59
10.29.07 #       <Dave_C> Sis I send you the demo?
10.29.09 #       <Dave_C> DID
10.29.10 #       <phoe> it's to do with the way the door port handles strings (or more specifically, assigns)
10.29.32 #       <Dave_C> Ray has the headers and such for MAX's...
10.29.34 #       <phoe> Dave_C: nope.. it's only a 1 week demo, so i'm not too keen on the aggro of setting it up
10.29.44 #       <Dave_C> He could probably help some there, but....
10.29.46 #       <phoe> i've got most stuff myself..
10.30.00 #       <phoe> i'm using a temporary assign for a CD door
10.30.19 #       <Dave_C> Yeah, but that key can be replaced w/ a reg'ed license and you're up and going
10.30.28 #       <phoe> and it seems to be handled 'wrong' - possibly by the door extension for amos
10.30.40 #       <phoe> Dave_C: I don't like the 'feel' of cnet tho :-(
10.30.48 #       <Dave_C> ok.
10.30.52 #       <phoe> Dave_C: how much is it now ?
10.30.57 #       <Dave_C> It';s different, I admit.
10.31.10 #       <Dave_C> http://www.cnetbbs.net/
10.31.13 #       <phoe> I like the simple menu control of maxs
10.31.22 #       <phoe> can't www atm, v low mem !
10.31.33 #       <phoe> 190k free :-}
10.31.37 #       <Dave_C> Cnet allows for a LOT of configurability now.
10.31.58 #       <Dave_C> I have mine setup w/ a numbered menu (gopher style)
10.32.06 #       <phoe> if it can't handle hotkeys, and let you change the file handling keys I won't bother
10.32.15 #       <Dave_C> and for CD's, it has it's own ANSI dirutil subboard type..
10.32.22 #       <Dave_C> very nice for CD's 
10.32.50 #       <phoe> I tried to use my m8's vers of cnet - it was a NIGHTMARE to use the file areas... it'd have to be vastly improved
10.32.57 #       <Dave_C> You can use rexx to make it hotkeyable, but you lose a lot of CNet's command line stuff
10.33.13 #       <phoe> I vehemently hate the command line style interface tho...
10.33.20 #       <Dave_C> How about an ANSI door like CDAxe...
10.33.22 #       <Dave_C> heheheh
10.33.29 #       <phoe> it's too hard for newbies to understand
10.33.34 #       <phoe> CDAxe ?
10.33.46 #       <Dave_C> use the cursor keys to navigate the dirs and select files for exam/dl/etc
10.34.01 #       <phoe> hmm... does it handle diz's ?
10.34.01 #       <Dave_C> CDAxe was an early CDROM door for CNet 3
10.34.14 #       <Dave_C> CNet now handles diz files correctly
10.34.28 #       <phoe> .. using cdaxe tho ?
10.34.39 #       <Dave_C> and the old FIDO ZGate problem is fixed.
10.34.50 #       <Dave_C> CDAxe is now built in
10.34.57 #       <phoe> I don't use fido anyway... too much traffic / crap
10.35.19 #       <Dave_C> the 'commander' subboard type, is kin to the old CNet/3 direct access sub.
10.35.47 #       <Dave_C> It allows direct dos type access to a directory and all its children using a cursor controled ANSI interface
10.35.50 #       <phoe> I just hated the lack of intuition of the subboard file access
10.36.32 #       <phoe> ie. i've got 17 file areas, all accessible withing 3 single keypresses from the main menu
10.36.43 Join    Wolfgang [0] (~hautzen@guest-tester.austin.apc.slb.com)

10.37.29 #       <Wolfgang> what is the discussion?
10.37.37 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: bbs s/ware atm
10.37.40 #       <phoe> cnet / maxsbbs
10.37.47 #       <Dave_C> you still have to hit enter here between commands, but you hit 3 for files, then select the platform area by number, then select the sub under that that you want.
10.38.08 #       <Dave_C> Wolf is a CNet guy too!
10.38.13 #       <phoe> Dave_C: its the number and sub-number that makes life far too complicated
10.38.28 #       <phoe> Dave_C: I won't hold it against him ;-)
10.38.41 #       <Wolfgang> well, gee.... thanks
10.38.45 #       <phoe> hehehe
10.38.51 #       <Dave_C> Good part about CNet/4 is its internal Internet access utils
10.39.23 #       <phoe> I don't want sub-boards etc, I want basic file areas to go into, no sub-sections at all...
10.39.32 #       <Dave_C> internal telnetd, smtp/smtpd, nntp/nntpget, telnet, irc, ftp, etc
10.39.44 #       <Dave_C> phoe: you can do that.
10.39.46 #       <phoe> Dave_C: are you in the US ???
10.40.01 #       <phoe> Dave_C: i'd have to, i'd never understand it otherwise :-}
10.40.02 #       <Dave_C> it'll be a bit less organized, but you can do it
10.40.10 #       <Dave_C> phoe:yup
10.40.12 #       <Wolfgang> phoe, well, you CAN do that by not creating any sub-dirs, but that'll make for a really HUGE library listing, assuming you got lots of them
10.40.39 #       <phoe> Dave_C: we don't get free calls in the UK, so 'net BBS's are NOT an option
10.40.56 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: i've got maybe 400 files per area atm (some may have more)
10.41.13 #       <phoe> we pay about 2.5c per minute for the phone :-/
10.41.33 #       <phoe> (that's on top of a higher monthly rental charge than you)
10.42.06 #       <Wolfgang> gosh!  UK really likes to stiff the customers, huh?
10.42.08 #       <phoe> we don't have cable modems...
10.42.11 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
10.42.24 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: gasoline is just under $5 per gallon
10.42.59 #       <phoe> the CHEAPEST Ford Escort you can buy (1.3L engine, no air con) is about $17000
10.43.09 #       <phoe> yup.. we get STIFFED
10.43.59 #       <Wolfgang> well, seeing as how the UK is the highest car per capita in Europe, that's understandable.
10.44.17 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: how do you work out that it's understandable ???
10.44.57 #       <phoe> we have our own oil fields, but the gov. tax us to hell
10.45.29 #       <Wolfgang> from what I've heard, the UK is trying to cut the number of vehicles on the road as parking spaces and road congestion is getting tight
10.45.38 #       <phoe> .. and cars shouldn't cost any more than the rest of europe
10.46.07 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: yeah, maybe it IS getting busy, no worse I imagine than, say, Manhattan
10.46.23 #       <phoe> or any other major city you can name
10.46.55 #       <phoe> they're looking at charging us about $16 PER DAY for travelling into a city now..
10.46.58 #       <Wolfgang> I just spent 2 months in Tokyo, Japan, and it is the same there.  Too many cars for not enough roads and parking spaces
10.47.08 #       <phoe> that's on top of the rest of the taxes
10.47.39 #       <Wolfgang> well, from the report I read, it is to encourage y'all into taking the non-existing buses and other public transportation
10.47.51 #       <phoe> - thee gov. 'privatised' all public transport, so it's very expensive
10.48.08 #       <phoe> and the public transport infrastructure doesn't exist
10.48.39 #       <phoe> companies won't run bus routes that won't make money, so people NEED a car to move about
10.48.57 #       <Wolfgang> well.... the Govt has to pay all those Royalty  people their high wages
10.49.19 #       <phoe> it costs about $2 for a 2 mile bus ride
10.49.36 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: i'd shoot them all anyawy
10.50.10 #       <phoe> the cheapest fare is about $1.40 anyway, for going one stop (about 200 metres)
10.50.51 #       <phoe> .. if you need to get 2 buses to get to work, and another 2 to get home, it gets DAMN EXPENSIVE
10.51.00 #       <Wolfgang> hmmm... sounds like the Brits need a Tax revolt.
10.51.08 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: you said it...
10.51.19 #       <phoe> I bet you think we've got a bill of rights too...
10.51.22 #       <phoe> HAHAHHHA
10.51.27 #       <phoe> we wish
10.51.33 #       <Wolfgang> the magna carter isn't?
10.51.40 #       <phoe> no freedom of information act
10.51.54 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: hahahah who are you kidding... nope... means shit...
10.52.24 #       <Wolfgang> I guess having a King and Queen can be a Royal Pain
10.52.48 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: you don't know too much about the royals then.. they have NO POWER AT ALL
10.53.04 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: the gov. took all power from them in about 1700ad
10.53.19 #       <phoe> (my history's crap tho)
10.53.28 #       <Wolfgang> I am aware they are just figure heads and the Prime Minister and the House of Lords do most of the politicking there
10.54.43 #       <phoe> the house of lords are mainly people who haven't been voted in, have any experience, but their ancestors were given the title hundreds of years ago - all their offspring get in now for no reason whatsoever
10.55.22 #       <phoe> Q) what age can you have (legal) sex in the US ?
10.55.54 #       <phoe> in the UK it's 16 for 'normal' people, but 18 for gays (it WAS 21 until recently)
10.56.46 #       <phoe> btw whaddya all think about the bombings ???? (the embassies)
10.56.55 #       <Merko> phoe: What about the lesbians? ;D
10.57.03 #       <phoe> Merko: 18 (again, was 21)
10.57.37 #       <Wolfgang> well in the US, 11 year old girls are gettiing pregnant, but it's 16 only if the "partner" is less then 3 years older then the girl.  18 is considered legal
10.58.11 #       <Merko> phoe: Alright.. at least some kind of equality then. ;D
10.58.25 #       <Merko> In sweden it's 16, any way you like it. ;)
10.58.47 #       <Wolfgang> As for Gay "coupling", there isn't any laws I am aware of, as long as it isn't "older" men going after young boys (like the family priest going after the choir boys)
10.58.56 #       <phoe> re: bombings.. quick thought on them... HOW THE HELL DID YOU THINK WE FELT BEING BOMBED BY IRISH BASTARDS !!!!  :-}   most of the money for the Irish terrorists came from the US...
10.59.01 #       <Merko> Wolfgang: What about a 16 year old male and a 20 year old female then?
10.59.44 #       <Merko> Jeez.. I missed those bombings.. <turning on radio>..
10.59.49 #       <phoe> I got married in Niagara Falls (Ont) but in Quebec you can get married at TWELVE !!!!
11.00.00 #       <phoe> (lucky gits ;-) )
11.00.09 #       <Wolfgang> Merko: as long as the female isn't the kid's school teacher (the blue noses here frown on that), otherwise, it's considered: "Boys will be boys" thing
11.00.35 #       <Merko> Wolfgang: Huh.. strange.
11.00.49 #       <phoe> who was it in sweden... we don't get ANY porn on the TV here... it's illegal to show a film where a man has a hard-on
11.01.16 #       <Wolfgang> phoe: as for the bombings, well, I would never donate anything to a bunch of criminals, even if they do consider themselves terrorists, 
11.01.17 #       <phoe> no shots of the action are allowed...
11.01.22 #       <Merko> phoe: Well.. serious channels don't show porn here.
11.01.57 #       <phoe> Wolfgang: it's just strange the way the attitude changes when it happens to yanks instead ;-)
11.02.04 #       <Merko> phoe: Nudity may appear even in childrens TV though.
11.02.16 #       <phoe> Merko: ooooh no, no chance of that here !
11.02.32 #       <Wolfgang> when I was in Japan, the hotel I stayed in had an adult channel, but the genitals were 'blurred", tho tits were sometimes shown on regular tv

11.04.05 #       <Merko> phoe: Exacty. I think that's what they are doing actually..
11.04.22 #       <Merko> phoe: Well.. do you know if it's really meant to be a childrens programme?
11.04.24 #       <Wolfgang> phoe:  If all terrorists were lined up along a wall and shot, I would volenteer to be one of the ones to pull the trigger.
11.04.35 #       <Merko> Wolfgang: But then you would be shot!

11.05.50 #       <Merko> Wolfgang: If you kill them in cold blood, even though they aren't threatening you, that makes YOU a terrorist imho.

12.24.05 #       <Womble> That's not likely, really
12.24.16 #       <Womble> I'd like to see PPC support, but with AmigaOS 5, not H&P's thing
12.24.55 #       <Womble> What H&P has done is to come up with an easy way to use the PPC as a coprocessor for the 68K, but with OS 3.1 still generally in charge
12.25.02 #       <HMetal> H&P is still trying to get in with their buggy approaches? ;)
12.25.05 #       <beyas> h&p gonna develope w/o-68k only ppc amigas with licencees
12.25.24 #       <Merko> Where did this rumour appear?
12.25.47 #       <Womble> Well, it is possible. That might make particularly fast and quite cheap OS 3.1 machines
12.25.59 #       <Womble> That's not viable in the long term though, as OS 3.1 is outdated
12.27.26 #       <beyas> merko: a ppc beta tester give these infos.
12.27.37 Quit    TheTd (:bye bye, maybe sometime soon I'il talk to you again)
12.27.38 #       <beyas> he is testing 68k emulator
12.27.47 #       <Merko> beyas: Sounds like another Steffen Häuser rumour..
12.27.56 #       <beyas> merko:yep
12.28.51 #       <Womble> I can believe there's a 68K emulator there; question is, can you make the OS work in the emulator at a decent rate?
12.29.33 #       <Merko> The OS is fast enough on 020 imho, so I guess: Yes.
12.30.56 #       <Womble> No it's not.
12.30.59 #       <Merko> Problem is.. can you do it on an emulator developed not by emulation experts basing their work of years and years of research, lots of time and huge investments, but instead by a bunch of amateurs? Hmm.
12.31.25 #       <Womble> If it's fast enough on a 68020, why aren't you running it on a 68020?
12.31.25 #       <beyas> womble: h&p says G3 can run 68k faster than 060.. possible
12.31.32 #       <Womble> They have to make it faster than 060, yes.
12.31.45 #       <Merko> Womble: Because I use other things than just the OS!
12.32.03 #       <Womble> Well, all your other software is running on top of the OS, using the OS services.
12.32.13 #       <Merko> Womble: Sure. What's your point?
12.32.15 #       <Womble> So, OS emulation speed is critical.

12.32.36 #       <Rocambole> hello WarNPeace 
12.32.45 #       <Merko> Womble: Take a look at for example executive's Top program..
12.32.45 #       <WarNPeace> Hiya all ;)
12.33.18 #       <Womble> Assume there's no hardware bashing in the user programs - then you need pure 68K emulation for user programs and 68K+motherboard-devices emulation *or* patching for the OS
12.33.20 #       <Womble> Hi WarNPeace 
12.33.21 #       <Merko> Womble: Of course, it doesn't show the time spent in OS libraries.. but anyway.
12.34.16 #       <Womble> Merko: There's no way to tell. What I'm trying to say is that to run the OS you need to handle instructions that hit chips other than the 68K, so pure 68K emulation (which can be very fast) isn't enough for that
12.34.47 #       <Womble> Merko: If you do it in a very general way, you end up with UAE, which still isn't fast enough to do what they need to do.
12.35.10 #       * Womble wonders why he can't ping another machine on the Ethernet
12.35.18 #       <Merko> Womble: Well, who says they won't have for example some timers? AGA isn't needed if you can sacrifice the old games..
12.35.31 #       <HMetal> Womble: routed or straight TCP/IP?
12.36.07 #       <Womble> HMetal: Ordinary ICMP ping from here to upstairs.
12.36.32 #       <Womble> HMetal: Maybe it was a bad idea to build the driver as a module.
12.36.45 #       <Womble> HMetal: Or maybe, I just knocked the wire...
12.37.25 #       <Merko> Womble: Apart from timers, I don't know if my Amiga actually uses much of the "custom chips"...
12.38.13 #       <Womble> Merko: Interrupt controller and DMA controller; mouse
12.38.31 #       <Womble> Merko: Well, most of this stuff can be replaced by new drivers, or patched in the ROM image.
12.38.40 #       <Womble> Merko: That's if they have a licence to do that.

12.39.05 Quit    beyas (:Leaving)
12.39.07 #       <Merko> Womble: Yeah.. you could put those things in hardware even.. wouldn't be expensive I'd think.
12.39.45 #       <Womble> b
12.40.08 #       <Womble> Merko: No, the emulator mustn't allow emulated programs to see the real hardware!
12.40.20 #       <Womble> Right, it was the cable being out of place.
12.40.24 #       <Merko> Womble: Why?
12.40.40 #       <Womble> Or rather, one of my crap connectors not making good contact ;-)
12.41.08 #       <Womble> Merko: Well, it just makes everything more difficult and expensive.

12.43.13 Part    Gadget
12.43.25 #       <Merko> Womble: I mean.. a machine having every chip except the 68k, which is emulated on PPC, would work. Right?
12.43.59 #       <Womble> Merko: But that would have to be custom-made.
12.44.22 #       <Womble> Merko: It would be far better if they could just use an existing PPC board.
12.44.23 #       <Merko> Womble: Of course that wouldn't make sense.. but you could remove AGA, paula, the I/O.. and end up with some simple (I think!) timers and stuff..
12.44.51 #       <Womble> Merko: Still a waste of money
12.45.23 #       <Merko> Womble: Only if you can get the same functionality cheaper.
12.45.58 #       <Womble> Merko: You can, by picking an existing motherboard instead of wasting time and money developing your own inferior one like Phase 5 does.
12.46.02 #       <Merko> Womble: Are you suggesting that it would run on some existing Mac or something?
12.46.14 #       <Womble> Merko: Not that they have got around to making their own motherboard yet...
12.46.37 #       <Womble> Merko: Probably not Mac, no. There are other PPC board makers. PIOS will have one soon that could potentially be used.
12.46.59 #       <Merko> Bah. Pios are the vapor champions #1..
12.47.02 #       <Womble> Merko: Apple wants you to run MacOS on all their hardware
12.47.19 #       <Womble> Merko: Nah, that's Phase 5 ;-)
12.47.39 #       <Merko> Womble: Phase5? I have lots of Phase5 hardware.
12.47.54 #       <Womble> Merko: Well, PIOS has been selling hardware for some time too.
12.47.58 #       <Merko> But people prefer to bash Phase5 and praise nonexistan Pios hardware.
12.48.21 #       <Womble> Merko: In fact, PIOS already does sell motherboards with PPC 750s, but they are meant for use in Macs.
12.48.21 #       <Merko> Womble: Umm, those Macs they didn't even make themselves?
12.48.44 #       <Womble> Merko: Well, they sure beat inferior Phase 5 hardware with buggy software support ;-)
12.49.02 #       <Merko> Womble: My P5 software works.. never had a problem with it.
12.49.22 #       <Womble> Merko: Well, obviously you never used CGX, their latest SCSI card, or PowerUP
12.49.29 #       <Merko> The Pios software support is nonexistant, so it doesn't beat anything.
12.49.44 #       <Merko> Womble: Only cgx and PuP. Soon scsi.
12.50.13 #       <Womble> Merko: PIOS leaves that to people that know about software... unlike Phase 5 which has Ralph "why do my PPC executables look strange?" Schmidt
12.50.50 #       <Womble> Merko: Have you heard the story about how Ralph Schmidt only realised just before PowerUP release that the PPC development tools made ELF executables?
12.50.57 #       <Womble> Merko: Load of incompetent fools, IMHO.
12.51.01 #       <Merko> Womble: Well, like I said, PiOS don't even have a product yet! So no matter how bad Phase5 may be, they are still infinitely better.
12.51.23 #       <Womble> Merko: PIOS does have a product, called the Met@box, which they'll be showing off at CeBIT Home in August, actually.
12.51.25 #       <Merko> Womble: Stupid rumour.
12.51.40 #       <Womble> Merko: No rumour, he said this on the GG mailing list if I remember correctly.
12.51.49 #       <Merko> Womble: Yeah.. right besides the A\Box?
12.52.11 #       <Womble> Merko: No, the Met@box has been ready for a while.
12.52.54 #       <Womble> Merko: It's a set-top box based on the Cyrix MediaGX processor, Linux and some Java stuff. I don't know what network it's meant to work with.
12.53.05 #       <Merko> Womble: Wow. Developed by Pios?
12.53.15 Part    HMetal
12.53.19 #       <Womble> Merko: Some parts of it are.
12.53.25 #       <Merko> Womble: LOL!
12.53.30 #       <Womble> Merko: And the PIOS One is just about ready now.
12.53.49 #       <Merko> Womble: Yeah, and has been for well over a year..
12.54.00 #       <Womble> Merko: I think I should be able to get it in about a month's time, but not sure.
12.54.12 #       <Womble> Merko: I am exasperated by all the delays though
12.54.25 #       <Merko> Actually I have nothing against Pios.. but they have to show something before I even want to compare them with anything else.
12.54.48 #       <Merko> Womble: Yeah.. maybe they found out things Phase5 learned long ago? ;D
12.54.49 #       <Womble> Well, yes, we do need to see real products

14.10.34 #       <Ogge> hey yoshi.. 
14.11.02 #       <Womble> Hi Yoshi
14.11.17 #       <Rocambole> wurzel: well it's 3 HDs actually
14.11.35 #       <Womble> I got a new 4 GB drive for my A1200 because the old 540 MB one was dying
14.11.50 #       <Womble> Then I have 3.5 GB in the PC, and an old 85 MB one hanging around that still works
14.12.07 #       <Womble> So, about 8 GB total capacity. All IDE crap though.
14.12.25 #       * Rocambole has 2 SCSI drives
14.12.29 #       * Yoshi2 has 2.1 GB SCSI, split up in three drives
14.12.31 #       <wurzel> Rocambole: Cheat ;)
14.12.32 #       <Ogge> ide is ok.. all my units in my pc are ide.. 
14.12.45 #       <Yoshi2> ... any a 250 MB 2.5" HD in the A1200 :)
14.12.49 #       <Ogge> even my cd recorder are ide.. 
14.13.08 #       <Rocambole> wurzel: 1x1.28GB+1x2.1GB SCSI and 1x2.1GB IDE
14.13.20 #       * Womble plans to get some SCSI kit when he has a little mor money.. hopefully a SCSI CD rewriter for a start
14.13.34 #       <Rocambole> Yoshi2: I have a 250MB 2.5" drive spare :)
14.13.37 #       * Yoshi2 also intends to buy a CDRW
14.13.50 #       <wurzel> I have an A500 with 540 + old 80 mb spare
14.14.02 #       <Yoshi2> Rocambole: I have an entire A1200 spare, as I don't have a monitor for it...
14.14.11 #       <Arvid> <-- has an A500 with a 40 meg SCSI ... only
14.14.17 #       <Ogge> yoshi, well w8 for the DVD burner to hit the market.. 
14.14.18 #       <Rocambole> my A500 have a A590 20 MB :))))

14.15.27 #       <Womble> That's crappier than IDE or SCSI, for sure
14.15.29 #       <Ogge> CDRW isn't worth the money.. 
14.15.31 #       * Worzel has a 4.3 gig, 1 gig, and 420 meg IDE HDs
14.15.47 #       <Womble> I've seen SCSI CDRW for £229
14.15.50 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: A CDRW burner will also burn normal CD's
14.15.53 #       <wurzel> Ah, but my A500 has an '030 and 9mb RAM :)
14.16.10 #       <Womble> That's *with* tax.
14.16.13 #       <Arvid> <-- my A500 has a 68010 and 5 meg ram
14.16.22 #       <Ogge> still isn't worth the money.. as the CDRW media only takes 500MB and the normal CDR takes 650MB

14.18.05 #       <Ogge> womble, not sure.. read it in an article today.. have to investigate some more.. 
14.18.14 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Whenever you want to change data more than 10 times :)

14.18.34 #       <Arvid> Ogge: maybe infinitely more .. I found some Sony CDR disks ... $20 for ten with a $20 rebate
14.18.36 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: But I agree, if you only do backups once a month, a CD recorder is enough
14.19.05 #       <Yoshi2> Noname CDR's are selling for under 1$
14.19.10 #       <Ogge> yoshi, true.. 
14.19.12 #       <Womble> Now what about tape drives?
14.19.22 #       <Womble> Aren't they likely to be better for backups?
14.19.46 #       <Womble> I got my Zip drive partly for backups, but Zips are too damned small for that really :-(
14.19.52 #       <Yoshi2> Womble: They hold too much data. :)  I wouldn't know what to do with 2, 4, 8 GB backup space :)
14.19.54 #       <Arvid> Womble tape is better for me .. 'cause I have a tape drive already
14.20.11 #       <Ogge> womble, it's great as backup.. IF u want to backup more than 650MB.. i normaly use tape drives at work.. and that backup is on 4-8GB each day..
14.20.29 #       <Womble> With a tape drive you wouldn't have to worry about working out which things needed to be backed up - you could just do the lot
14.20.34 #       <Womble> And tape drives are quite cheap...

15.13.07 #       <Worzel> Gustli: hi
15.14.22 #       <Gustli> you use irq mate?
15.14.52 #       <Worzel> Gustli: ICQ? yes
15.15.10 #       <Gustli> thanks - icq - a bit tired tonight -- is it worth the bother?
15.15.17 #       <Worzel> Gustli: need a PC to use irq <shiver>
15.15.35 #       <Gustli> no - stirq is the amiga version
15.15.53 #       <Worzel> Gustli: yeah, its useful if friends are also on it, you can message them even when they aren't online, 
15.15.55 #       <Gustli> and my a2k is down and i am on a stupid pc now :o(
15.16.33 #       <Gustli> aha - i just always use notify - but i suppose this program will pick them up anywhere then?
15.16.35 #       <Worzel> Gustli: it was a joke, irq is how PCs connect to external devices i think, yes i use stricq
15.16.59 #       <Gustli> aha - i am, unfortunately, only a button pusher
15.17.05 #       <Worzel> Gustli: as long as they are running it yes, so you don't need to be on the same irc server
15.17.21 #       <Gustli> well, that would be nice
15.17.53 #       <Worzel> Gustli: its like amtalk, only without the problems of dynamic servers and finding people
15.18.07 #       <Gustli> my amiga will be repaired on sunday and i think i will probably get the program - free/shareware or commercial?
15.18.39 #       <Gustli> i never used amtalk - some pc people have been raving about the "cb" like quality of the pc program
15.18.41 #       <Worzel> Gustli: free/shareware
15.19.28 #       <Gustli> cool - i have been offline a while - i need to update my ibrowse and amirc and pick up the icq program :o)
15.19.48 #       <Gustli> and lets not forget yam while i am at it

15.55.11 #       <Dave_C> I don't have it all linked to the web site yet, but gimme time.
15.55.54 #       <Agima> What do I need to fit a 12x SCSI CD-ROM to my Blizzard '060 SCSI Kit? It's currently on a Squirrel if that helps. What wire do I need?
15.56.37 #       <Dave_C> what's the connectors on the CD? 25, 50pin?
15.56.51 #       <Agima> Dave_C : 50 pin from the Squirrel
15.57.01 #       <Dave_C> what's the connectors on the SCSI port? 25, 50pin?
15.57.20 #       <Agima> 50 pin (I think :)
15.57.51 #       <Blitmanic> Your web site is on your Amiga?
15.57.56 #       <Agima> Confirmed. 50.
15.58.05 #       <Dave_C> that's pretty big connector if it's the centronics type
15.58.08 #       <Blitmanic> So you have a full time connection?
15.58.31 #       <Dave_C> it's dynamic, but I have a DNS host pointing CNAME at a dyndns.com address

15.59.25 Quit    Merko (:Mynd you, m00se bytes Kan be pretty nasti ...)
15.59.31 #       <Blitmanic> hmm .  I don`t understand
15.59.37 #       <Agima> On the SCSI Kit, it's 25 pin, and on the back on the CD ROM, it's 50 pin (Which is where the Squirrel goes)
16.00.20 #       <Dave_C> ok... go to the Mac store and get a 25 to 50 SCSI cable.

16.27.33 #       <TA> I am a bit odd myself.
