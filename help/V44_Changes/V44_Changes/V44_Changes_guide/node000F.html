The ASL Library
***************

   The <b>asl.library</b> has been improved in V44 to address a number of
localization, efficiency and GUI layout issues as well as fixing bugs.
For developers, there are also some new API extensions.

New Functions
=============

<b>VOID ActivateAslRequest(APTR requester)</b>
     Activate a modal requester from a different task context.

<b>VOID AbortAslRequest(APTR requester)</b>
     Attempt to tell the modal ASL requester provided to shut down and
     perform as if the user had clicked on the requester's window close
     gadget.

New Tags
========

<b>ASLFR_InitialShowVolumes (BOOL)</b>
     When opening the file requester, read the list of active volumes,
     do not read the contents of the specified drawer.

<b>ASLFR_SetSortBy (ULONG)</b>
<b>ASLFR_GetSortBy (ULONG *)</b>
     Criteria for sorting the file list. This must be one of:

        * <b>ASLFRSORTBY_Name</b> - sort by name (default)

        * <b>ASLFRSORTBY_Date</b> - sort by date

        * <b>ASLFRSORTBY_Size</b> - sort by size

     If <b>ASLFR_GetSortBy</b> is passed to AslRequest(), the file requester
     will store its current sort criteria in the ULONG pointed to by
     the tag before leaving.

<b>ASLFR_SetSortDrawers (ULONG)</b>
<b>ASLFR_GetSortDrawers (ULONG *)</b>
     Determines where drawers are placed in the sorted list; this must
     be one of:

        * <b>ASLFRSORTDRAWERS_First</b> - drawers appear before all other
          files (default)

        * <b>ASLFRSORTDRAWERS_Mix</b> - drawers are sorted along with the the
          other files

        * <b>ASLFRSORTDRAWERS_Last</b> - drawers appear after all other files

     If <b>ASLFR_GetSortDrawers</b> is passed to AslRequest(), the file
     requester will store its current sort drawer list placement in the
     ULONG pointed to by this tag.

<b>ASLFR_SetSortOrder (ULONG)</b>
<b>ASLFR_GetSortOrder (ULONG *)</b>
     Selects the order in which the list is sorted; this must be one of:

        * <b>ASLFRSORTORDER_Ascend</b> - smallest/oldest files first,
          largest/newest files last (default)

        * <b>ASLFRSORTORDER_Descend</b> - largest/newest files first,
          smallest/oldest files last

     If <b>ASLFR_GetSortOrder</b> is passed to AslRequest(), the file
     requester will store its current sort order in the ULONG pointed
     to by this tag.

<b>ASLFR_PopToFront (BOOL)</b>
<b>ASLFO_PopToFront (BOOL)</b>
<b>ASLSM_PopToFront (BOOL)</b>
     When set to TRUE, this tells ASL to bring the screen to the front
     the requester has opened on. (Default is TRUE).
