The SetPatch command
********************

   The <b>SetPatch</b> program has been extended in V44 to perform some
additional functions required by OS 3.5.

   - Remove ROM based libraries from Exec's library list before they
     have been opened by applications, so that a disk-based replacement
     can be subsequently loaded by ramlib. SetPatch defaults to remove
     <b>icon.library</b> and <b>workbench.library</b> automatically. This can be
     overridden with the <b>DISABLEROMMODULES</b> command line parameter.
     This feature obsoletes the <b>RemLibrary</b> command which was used in
     earlier OS 3.5 beta releases.

   - Load resident modules from <b>Devs:Amiga ROM Update</b> and add them to
     Exec's residents list(1). The updated versions will then be
     initialized by Exec at bootstrap time. <b>SetPatch</b> uses this feature
     to replace the ROM versions of the <b>scsi.device</b> and the
     <b>FastFileSystem</b> with the updated V44 versions. <b>SetPatch</b> determines
     which modules need to be replaced automatically, but this can also
     be overridden by the command line parameters.

   The V44 <b>SetPatch</b> command is designed to work with any Kickstart since
V37, altrough it has been tested extensively only on V40. <b>NOTE WELL:</b>
The replacement modules included in <b>Amiga ROM Update</b> are to be used on
Kickstart V40 <b>ONLY</b> so they won't work with earlier Kickstart versions.

   The <b>CheckSetPatch.c</b> code fragment included in the NDK may help some
software developers to internally turn off workarounds for OS bugs
conditionally.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This feature obsoletes the <b>LoadV43Module</b> command which was
distributed with earlier V43 <b>scsi.device</b> and <b>FastFileSystem</b> updates.
