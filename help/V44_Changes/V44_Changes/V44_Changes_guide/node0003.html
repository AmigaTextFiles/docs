Launching Workbench applications
================================

   The new OpenWorkbenchObject() can be used to execute a program as if
the user had double-clicked on its icon. This is expecially useful for
commodities that put up toolbars or menus to start other applications.

   Before V44, a similar functionality was made available by third-party
tools such as the <b>wbstart.library</b> and the <b>WBStart-Handler</b>.

   While third-party Workbench launchers are still supported in V44,
applications should be updated as soon as possible to use
OpenWorkbenchObject() when they detect a <b>workbench.library</b> whose
version is greater or equal to V44.

   Future versions of the Workbench may extend the WBStartup structure
to add new functionality. Then, the hack of sending faked WBStartup
messages to process's pr_MsgPort <b>WILL STOP WORKING</b>.

   OpenWorkbenchObject() can also open drawers. This feature can be
useful in some Workbench enhancer commodities.
