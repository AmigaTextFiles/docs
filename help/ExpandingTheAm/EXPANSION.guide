                         by @{" Peter J. Hutchison " link AUTH}

 The  Amiga  1200  may be a small computer but as developers and users have
 found  out,  it  has  a surprising scope for expansion through the various
 ports it has at its disposal.

@ENDNODE
@NODE POWER "Power Socket"

 The  Amiga 1200 comes with a meagre and underpowered 23W PSU (Power Supply
 Unit).  If  you  are  expanding  the  A1200  with lots of peripherals that
 require  power  of  the  1200  itself such as Hard Disks, Accelerators and
 floppy drives then it is advisable to replace it with a higher wattage PSU
 otherwise you may experience unexplainable crashes.

 Suppliers:

 200W PSU                               Eyetech Group Ltd.
 Heavy Duty 200W PSU                    Power Computing Ltd.

 Expect to pay 50 pounds or more.

@ENDNODE
@NODE PARALLEL "Parallel Port"

 The  Amiga  uses  a  Centronics  compatible  parallel interface. The Amiga
 parallel port is NOT the same as PC parallel ports so Parallel tape drives
 and so on will NOT work.
    Third party parallel cards can supply faster parallel and serial ports
 and some come with support for ECP or EPP enhanced ports like the PC.
 e.g. IOBlix, Hyperport, etc

 @{u}Printers@{uu}

 The  Amiga  can  work  with  any  serial or parallel printer on the market
 except  MS  Windows GDI printers which are PC specific and Apple Appletalk
 printers. The types available are:

      Daisy Wheel         Very old text old printers
      Dot Matrix          Cheap and slow printers. Text & Graphics.
                          Some modern ones are upgradable to colour.
      Inkjet/Bubblejet    Faster and more colourful printers esp.
                          suitable for graphics output.
      Laser               Very fast and expensive printers. Usually
                          only B&W. Some are capable of Postscript
                          for DTP work.

 Good software to use is either Print Studio II, TurboPrint or Enprint.

 @{u}Clocks@{uu}

 The  Amiga  does  not  come with a battery backed up clock as standard and
 must  be  setup  after  every  cold  start. Clocks are usually provided on
 memory  and  accelerator  boards  but  if you cannot afford those, special
 clock cartridges are available to plug in to save the date and time.

 Suppliers: Siren Software.

 @{u}Scanners@{uu}

 You  can fit various hand driven or flat bed scanners through the parallel
 port. Although this is cheaper than SCSI it is a lot slower.

 Suppliers:

 PowerScan B&W or Colour         Power Computing
 Epson GT Flatbed Scanner        Power Computing
 Epson GT Flatbed Scanners       First Computer Centre
 QuickCam Camera                 Eyetech Group
 Epson GT/Artec Scanners         Gasteiners

 Software  is  usually  provided  with the Handy Scanners. ImageFX has
 drivers  for  the  Epson  scanners  and there is ScanQuix from Eyetech for
 Flatbed scanners esp. SCSI scanners. There is also the BetaScan series
 of drivers from Aminet.

 @{u}Peer-to-Peer Networks@{uu}

 It  is  possible  to  network two Amigas together using a cable and access
 each  others  files and devices using a peer-to-peer network. The parallel
 ports provide a very fast communication line.

 The most common and freely available Peer networks are ProNet or ParNet. A
 commercial  version  is  available  called Liana which includes cables and
 SANA-II compatible software from Blittersoft.

@ENDNODE
@NODE SERIAL "Serial"

 The  Serial  port  is  the simplest port on the Amiga requiring less wires
 than  parallel  and  conforms to RS-232. Unlike most PCs, the Amiga uses a
 full 25 pin socket instead of a 9-pin socket.

 @{u}Modems@{uu}

 Any  external  Modem will work on the Amiga esp. those that use the Haynes
 command  set (those that start with @{b}AT@{ub}). The Amiga will work
 with upto v90 and the new 56k baud modems although a faster serial
 card will work better with 56k modems.

 The  serial  port  is  capable  of upto 32kb Baud (via Serial preferences)
 although   it   is  possible  is  exceed  this  by  replacing  the  Serial
 Preferencess  program  from  Aminet  with  the Extended version increasing
 speed to 64800 baud.

 @{u}Peer-to-Peer Network@{uu}

 The  serial port is ideal for peer to peer networks in particular the CD32
 which  has  a  simple  serial  port also used as a keyboard port. A simple
 null-modem cable is required.

    i.e.      Port      Port
               2 --//--> 3    Ports 2 & 3 are receive/send wires
               3 --//--> 2
               7 ------> 7    Port 7 is a control wire

 Software  to  use  is  either a Terminal program such as Term, Termite, or
 NComm or more specialised like SerNet or TwinExpress.

 @{u}MIDI@{uu}

 The  Amiga  does  not include MIDI as standard like the Atari ST but it is
 possible  to add a MIDI adapter via the serial port. MIDI allows many MIDI
 compatible musical instruments such as synthesizers, keyboards, drums etc.
 to be attached the Amiga.

 @{U}Faster Serial Ports@{uu}

  New expansions are out which provided even faster throughput for serial
 devices such as v90 Modems and ISDN. They can achieve upto 450Kb!

 Silver Surfer                        Analogic Computers
 Twister Mk2                          Power Computing

@ENDNODE
@NODE JOY "Joystick/Mouse"

 The  two  game ports on the Amiga are not serial ports but special digital
 ports  to  receive  direction  and  fire  button  signals  from a Mouse or
 Joystick input device.

 Any Atari or Commodore compatible Joystick, Joypad (a good one is the @{b}CD32
 Competition  Pro@{ub})  or  tracker  will  work.  Specialised  devices  such as
 steering wheels and foot pads will also work.

 Other  input  devices  are available such as Light Guns, Light Pens and so
 forth  are  available  (the type of connector is dependant on the device).
 There  are  some Analogue joysticks available but they are not the same as
 PC ones.

 The  Amiga  mouse is usually a two-button device although three button and
 optical  mice  may be used. PC mice need to be modified before they can be
 used on the Amiga.

 If you wish to use two joysticks and a mouse, you can by a Roboshift which
 automatically  detects  which  device  to  use connected to the same port.
 Ideal for two-players game players!

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Video"

 The  video capabilities is much more flexible than other computers and has
 built-in  video modes running at 15kHz Horizontal Scan Rate (PCs only work
 at 31.5kHz or higher).

 @{u}Monitors@{uu}

 The  Amiga  is  designed  as  a home computer and the A1200 has a built in
 modulator for use with TV sets. It is also possible to use a cheap monitor
 such   as  Commodore  1084  series  or  the  Philips  CM8833  models.  The
 disadvantage  with these monitors, is that they do not work well at higher
 resolutions and in laced modes, flickery screens are a result.

 The  Amiga  is  capable  to  use  VGA/SVGA  Monitors  as  on  the  PC  but
 unfortunately  cannot  cope  with  low-res screen modes which are normally
 used by games. So a cheaper monitor or TV screen is required in this case.
 A  special adapter can be purchased to convert the smaller VGA plug to the
 Amiga's 23 pin socket.

   Also you can buy ScanDoublers and FlickerFixers to allow native 
 screen modes to be displayed on VGA monitors.

 Alternately,  the  Amiga  can use multi-sync Monitors which will cope with
 low  and  high  resolutions can be used without flicker. These monitors do
 tend to be expensive but they are recommended by Amiga Technologies!

 @{u}Graphics Cards@{uu}

 The  Amiga's  custom chipset uses an Interleaved BitMap modes for graphics
 output.  This is ideal for low colour screens but tend to run out of steam
 on  high-colour 256 or more modes. PCs use Chunky graphics which is faster
 for  lots  of  colours. To get these modes requires a graphics card. These
 are  common  for Zorro-based Amigas but for the A1200, the BlizzardVision 
 and the Blizzard PPC card can give high resoltion graphics and 3D 
 acceleration!

            BlizzardVision Cards     Eyetech Group, Power Computing

 @{u}GenLocks@{uu}

 The  Amiga  is  well known as an excellent video mixer machine. To combine
 video  and  computer  graphics requires a GenLock. There are many Genlocks
 around as well as other video equipment such as ChromaKey and so forth for
 placing graphics on blue backgrounds and so on.

 Suppliers:  Genlock         Analogic Computers


@ENDNODE
@NODE AUDIO "Audio"

@{u}Speakers@{uu}

 The Amiga supplies four channel stereo sound through two ports at the back
 of  the  Amiga. These can be directed through a monitor, TV, hi-fi or even
 better through dedicated speakers.

 Suppliers: ZyFi 2 or Pro              First Computer Centre
            Multi Media 100-300w       GoldenImage (UK) Ltd.

@{u}Sound Cards@{uu}

  It is possible to improve on the old 8bit 4 channel Paula chip in all 
Amigas and install the latest 16 bit CD quality sounds cards via the 
Zorro slots, PCMCIA and other places.

 Cards include the Aura, Concercito, Delfina Lite, Prelude, Defina Plus,
Tocatta, WaveTools and Sunrize.

 AHI driver system allows different cards to use the same software.

@ENDNODE
@NODE FLOPPY "Floppy drive"

 As  well  as  the  internal DF0: drive, the Amiga can have upto 3 external
 drives  (DF1-DF3). The Amiga normally uses Double Density drive (880k) but
 can used specially made High Density drive (1.76Mb).

 The  Amiga  differs  from PC made drives in a number of ways: Paula custom
 chip  controls  the  floppy  drives and uses non-standard 11 sectors/track
 format (PCs use 9 sectors/track and is the reason why it is impossible for
 them  to  read  Amiga  disks), uses a disk-detection system when disks are
 inserted/removed and a non-standard interface. Paula cannot cope with high
 density  drives  at full speed and moved be slowed down to read/write high
 density disks. This explains why Amiga HD drives are much more expensive.

 To combat the lack of HD support, new floppy drive controllers are available
 to provide access to High Density floppy drives including those used on PC
 systems such as the Catweasel and Kylwalda.

 Suppliers: Analogic Computers, Marpet Developments, EyeTech, First
            Computer Centre, Power Computing and many more!

@ENDNODE
@NODE IDE "IDE Port"

 Unlike  its predecessor, the A1200 and A600 came with an internal IDE port
 to  use  an IDE 2.5" Hard Drive. Due to lack of space beneath the keyboard
 it  can  be difficult to fit cheaper 3.5" drives although newer ultra-slim
 units  can  be  fitter  with no modification! IDE drives are driven by the
 @{b}scsi.device@{ub} as it made it compatible with SCSI devices which were the norm
 in  older  Amigas.  IDE  and  EIDE  drives can be fitted to the Amiga, the
 current @{b}partition@{ub} limit is 2Gb!!

 Normally,  IDE is designed to use 2 items although with ATAPI or IDEFIX it
 is possible to increase this to 4 devices using a special IDE Buffer interface.
 Besides  Hard  disks,  the IDE port can also handle the cheaper IDE CD-ROM
 drives  that  are  available. 

 The IDE port also allows you to fit a SCSI adaptor, called the Data Flyer+
 which  is  a  simple  board that fits inside the A1200 and provides a SCSI
 connection  as  well  as  allowing  you  to  fit  IDE  hard  disks  on the
 pass-through port!

   Another new device is the PowerFlyer or EasyFlyer which provides high speed
 IDE performance like those on the PC and Mac with PIO 3 and 4 modes which
 can be fitted to most Amiga models.

@ENDNODE
@NODE PCMCIA "PCMCIA Smart card port"

 With  the  A600 and the A1200, the A500 expansion port was replaced with a
 PCMCIA  port. This allows you to attach PCMCIA peripherals that conform to
 PCMCIA type 2 specifications.

 Originally,  only memory cards were the only thing available to run on the
 A1200, they can be set up as fast RAM or disks using the PrepCard Tool.

 The  PCMCIA  can  be expanded to use hard disks such as the SuperStor hard
 disks  with  PCMCIA  interface, OverDrive CD-ROMs such as the Archos Zappo
 and the Q-Drive.

 The  best  use  is  to  attach a Squirrel SCSI (Classic or Surf) interface
 which allows you to attach upto seven SCSI peripherals such as hard disks,
 CD-ROMs, Tape Drives, Scanners and so on!

 If  you  require Ethernet adapters then the PCMCIA card from Hydra Systems
 or NE2000 compatible cards are the only ones currently compatible with the
 Amiga.

 PCMCIA drivers are very hard to come by on the Amiga so don't buy Ethernet
 cards, modem cards etc. unless it comes supplied with a driver. Some drivers
 are available on Aminet e.g. pcmcom and cnet device.

 Suppliers:    Classic/Surf SCSI Squirrel - Analogic
               CD-ROMs, Hard drives - Various
               Ethernet Cards - Hydra Systems

@ENDNODE
@NODE CPU "CPU Slot"

 Trapdoor  slot  underneath the A1200 allows you to improve the performance
 of the system many fold by installing a memory card or accelerator.

 Memory  cards  are  cheaper  and  allow  you to add fast 32-bit ram to the
 system,  options include a clock and possibly a FPU (Floating Point Unit).
 Adding  fast ram will double the speed of the CPU by not restricting it to
 Chip  RAM  which is shared by the custom chips. The A1200 with a 68020 can
 have  a  maximum  of 8MB of fast RAM. Having more than 4Mb can disable the
 PCMCIA port at it shares some of the fast ram memory addresses.

 An  accelerator  board  allows  you  to  replace  the standard 14Mhz 68020
 processor  with a much faster version. You can have a cheap 28MHz 68020 or
 a  fast  25/33  or 50MHz 68030 or even a 50MHz 68060 the fastest available
 processor available. It is not recommended to use a 68040 processor due to
 overheating  problems (a fan may help). These processors will allow you to
 add  more  memory  upto  256Mb  in  some cases and provide a FPU and a MMU
 (Memory Management Unit) to access virtual RAM etc.

 On the A1200 it is now possible to connect a Zorro daughter board to provide
 Zorro slots to allow Zorro cards to be fitted to the A1200 such as the Zorro
 IV board. A tower is required.

@NODE INTERNAL "Internal Expansion"

 Just  to  further  the  Amiga's  expansion capabilities there are internal
 expansions  available  to  expand  the  Amiga further by utilitising ports
 inside  the  Amiga  that were supposed to be used for future expansion but
 forgotten about.

 @{u}PortPlus (Jnr)@{uu}

 This  device  attaches to the clock connector near the floppy drive in the
 Amiga 1200 and supplies two fast serial ports and a parallel port. The Jnr
 version  just  supplies  one  fast  serial  port.  Ideal  for  high  speed
 communications either using a modem or a network.

@ENDNODE
@NODE AUTH "The Author"

 I  hope  this  brief  list of possible expansions options will allow A1200
 users to expand their Amiga to the limit. I am sorry, if I haven't covered
 every  possible  avenue  in this document but scanning the Amiga magazines
 will  help you to shop for the item you want. It may be cheaper to shop at
 non-Amiga  retailers  or  mail order firms for generic peripherals such as
 RAM, Hard Disks, CD-ROMs, Scanners etc.
