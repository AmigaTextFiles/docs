How to make an updated bootable UAE CD.
by Lorence Lombardo,  (C) Copyright 2009

The reason why you would want to update your existing UAE CD is
that the original kernel may not support your current or future
hardware. 

You might also wish to build an emergency boot CD, Games CD,
Demo CD and various other applications.



The CD imaging software which I use is mkisofs, which has been
included in this archive. See the archive "mkisofs-2.0-bin.lha"
on the aminet for the complete package. 

This has been tested with "ixemul.library 48.0" version from the
aminet on WinUAE.


Now these are the steps I took to make my bootable CD:-

1. Create an empty directory on your NTFS partition "am_cd".

2. From your AF6 CD copy the directories boot, Emulation, KNOPPIX and
   the file "Disk.info" to your "am_cd" directory.

3. Once all of the selected CD contents is copied, I suggest you add the
   "am_cd" directory as a hard drive having the label "amcd" and then
   do a soft reset so that your `Disk.info' icon is updated on that
   new partition.   
    
4. Now execute the `makeISO' script which I have provided in this
   archive via its icon and follow the script. Hopefully you would
   have built a successful CD-ROM ISO image. Now all you have to do is
   burn the image to CD.


Additional notes:-

1. It is recommended that you use a re-writable CD if possible.

2. Edit "boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg" and "Emulation/UAE/.uaerc" to your
   liking.

3. In the root of the "Emulation" directory only the "UAE" and "shared"
   directories are required.

4. In "Emulation/shared/dir/System" is the WorkBench system which you
   can add to or change to your liking. Additonal Amiga programs are
   kept in "Emulation/shared/dir/Work".
 


The End...
CYA...!!!!  :)
