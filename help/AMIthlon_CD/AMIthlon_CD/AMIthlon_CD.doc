How to make an updated bootable AMIthlon CD.

The reason why you would want to update your existing Amithlon CD is
that the original kernel may not support your current or future
hardware.

The following is only my suggested way of doing it.
You will need the following software items:-
1. A new kernel for AMIthlon. You can download the file newkernel.lha
   from the aminet.
2. Some CD imaging software. I used mkisofs, which has been included
   in this archive. See the archive mkisofs-2.0-bin.lha on the aminet
   for the complete package.

Now these are the steps I took to update my CD.

1. Copy the contents of your Amithlon CD preferably to an empty
   partition on your hard drive. For the purpose of this explanation
   we will use SDH2: for the empty partition name. Once all of the CD
   contents is copied, I suggest you do a soft reset so that your
   `Disk.info' icon is updated on that partition.   

2. Extract the archive newkernel.lha and place your new kernel,
   `new_emubox.gz' in the `isolinux' directory on the SDH2:
   partition.

3. With your favorite text editor edit the files isolinux.cfg, small,
   and amithlon from the `isolinux' directory, which is on SDH2:. 
   Replace the word `emubox.gz' with `new_emubox.gz'. You will also 
   need to add 200 to the "leavepages=xxxx" parameter. Since this
   kernel is a little bit bigger than the old one. Alternatively you
   can just simply replace those files with the edited ones I have
   provided for you in the `isolinux' directory of this archive.

4. Copy any extra files you wish to include on your CD to SDH2:.

5. Now execute the `makeISO' script which I have provided in this
   archive via its icon and follow the script. Hopefully you would
   have built a successful CD-ROM ISO image. Now all you have to do is
   burn the image to CD.

The End...
CYA...!!!!  :)
