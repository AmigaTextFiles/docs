  I always wanted my 'Jade' or 'AME' editors to   have white background and black
foreground, but they cant   offer such features and   yet Workbench itself treats
background   as a single color where other stuff like gadgets use it  as well...,
so changing from the  default gray to  white would  be disasterical  to the eyes.
This is very  annoying, because whenever I want  to write something  with my fav.
text  editor I face that sad greyness that   fills the   screen and makes me stop
doing what   I just started...   Fortunately, there is a   way to   have   highly
contrased   colours while preserving gray for   where it is   desired  it to  be!
Obviously  this "trick"   will not work for a "Workbench Screen" directly, but we
can deal with that through the use of public screens,  where each public   screen
is   a "room" which   has its   own colors! AmigaOS is a super hero to me at this
point because it did not only   save its ass   from being   boring and   ugly and
replaced   by so famous  'Kate' editor   on Linux, but also helped me to see that
great   potential  it has,  once again ;-) ! Of course its not that the OS is the
only thing to mention,   its also a   matter of software,   and for  that im very
thankful to Raymond  Penners who wrote 'ScreenWizard'.  In fact I use this proggy
since late 90's, but  I have realised only now,  that there are color  assignment
options who allow  to change  the default color  scheme, even though I knew of it
all the time, lol.

ScreenWizard can be downloaded here:

   http://aminet.net/util/cdity/scrwiz11.lha

Here   is a short walk-through on how to configure this thing quickly for general
test   purposes. Then I will show how to apply "contrastity". After unpacking the
archive, run  the daemon: 'ScreenWizardCX' and then run 'ScreenWizard'  so we can
add   new screen.   Picture below depicts quite   clearly what you should do,  so
I will skip on   commenting detail by detail. As a tip, set at least 8 colors  in
the screenmode requester!

              <pre>
Next   step is to customise the palette.  It is not mandatory, but will allow new
public screens   to have the very same last 4 colors, which   will make them look
nicer if  you have  customised Workbench   color palette. To apply colors in 0-63
ranges into 0-255   range you will have to multiply  the values by 4! Proggy used
to display Workbench palette is 'FullPalette' preferences.

              </center>
              <pre>
Then preset   the pens(set the color assignment)   like on the  picture below. Of
course you can do that your   way, but for the sake   of guidance try to set them
like on the picture.
              </pre>

              <img border="0" src="_sw_pens.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              </center>
              <pre>
And   as a last step, do the background.  Black will be just fine, then press the
'Save' button in the main window.
              </pre>
              <center>
              <img border="0" src="_sw_back.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              </center>
              <pre>
Now,   lets test if what  we did has actually   any effect. If  you dont use that
handy   script('clispawn') then   type:  'newcli CON://///SCREENMYMAGICSCREEN' in
'Execute Command' of the Workbench.
              </pre>
              <center>
              <img border="0" src="_sw_execute.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              </center>
              <pre>
After   this, new Shell window should open on our freshly customised pub. screen.
              </pre>
              <center>
              <img border="0" src="_sw_screen.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              </center>
              <pre>
Lets now do  the trick, so the background  of the window can be white and the sad
colour will be  still assisting us,   but wont  dominate. Firstly we have to swap
these crucial palette entries.
              </pre>
              <center>
              <img border="0" src="_sw_palswap.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              </center>
              <pre>
Then   we have to reassign pens,   so what was white must be white, what was grey
must be grey, but overall scheme will differ!
              </pre>
              <img border="0" src="_sw_penswap.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              <pre>
And now the final effect.   The 'Jade' in action   with non-depressive background
and eye friendly grey here and there.
              </pre>
              <center>
              <img border="0" src="_sw_jade.png" hspace="5" vspace="5">
              </center>
              <pre>
Nice huh?  Yep, I like it too! Tomorrow I will  surely go pink, to see everything
in pink ;-) as a form of therapy to cure the "gray disease"!
