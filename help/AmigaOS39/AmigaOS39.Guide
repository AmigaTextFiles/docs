@Node Reaction "Reaction"

@{u}Reaction@{uu}

  When the Amiga was first released to the public with Workbench 1.x, part of 
the operating system included the @{b}Intuition@{ub} library which provided the GUI 
(Graphical User Inferface) for Workbench and the applications. This was very 
simple API with facilities for Screens, Windows, Gadgets and on on.

  Intuition based problems had a problem and that was its very flat appearence 
and produced lengthly code to write interfaces for programs. So, Workbench 2.x 
included a new library called the @{b}GadTools@{ub} library which provided better 3D 
looking interfaces and simplified some of the coding. Utilities such as 
GadToolsBox made it easier to design the interface visually and automatically 
produce code. Workbench 3.x made some minor improvements to it later.

  When Commodore when bankrupt, Workbench was left in limbo for some time. 
Third party  programmers became weary of Gadtools and developed their own GUI 
APIs. These include MUI (Magic User Interface), BGUI, Triton, ClassAct and 
others to overcome the limitations of Intuition and Gadtools.

  Workbench did have a feature called @{b}BOOPSI@{ub} (Basic Object Orientated 
Programming System for Inutuition) which allows Intuition to be customisable 
and expandable, it allows some objects to inherit the behaivour of other objects 
and they are interchangable and provide and consistant interface.

  BOOPSI was underdeveloped in Workbench, @{b}ClassAct@{ub} provided extra classes of 
objects and allowed new features to be added to Applications. MUI took over 
as the dominant interface though which is similar to BOOPSI but didn't use 
it like ClassAct.

  With 3.5, the new Reaction libirary was developed from BOOPSI and ClassAct 
and provided a new fresh interface for Workbench and its programs, such as 
the Preference programs to use from now on.

  New objects such as Classes, Gadgets and Images can be programmed and created 
and shared between programs and are stored in SYS:Classes. 

  There is a Reaction preferences program which can customise they way Reaction 
programs are displayed. You can change the Font, Backdrop pattern, labels, the 
refresh method, Styling and Color if you wish from one program.

@Endnode
@Node Prefs "Preferences"

@{u}Preferences@{uu}

  Workbench 1.x can with only one central @{b}Preferences@{ub} program to change 
the  way Workbench behaves such as Screen Mode, Pointer, Printer, Serial Port 
and so on.

  Workbench 2.x and 3.x changed this to multiple programs. One program for each
feature Workbench provided e.g. ScreenMode, Printer, Font, Time etc.

  Workbench 3.9 now provides some new Workbench preference programs and most 
have been rewritten with the new Reaction interface:

   Workbench is the standard user interface for AmigaOS and is loaded via the 
@{b}LoadWB@{ub} command from the startup-sequence. Two new keywords have been added: 
SKIPWBSTARTUP (skips loading programs in WBStartup drawer) and SIMPLEGELS 
(type of Sprite/Bob/Objects).

   Workbench now has an Arexx interface via the WORKBENCH port. See the Arexx

@Endnode
@Node CDFS "CacheCDFS"

@{u}CacheCDFS@{uu}

   Workbench 3.1 introduced the CDFileSystem which is widely used for CD32 Amiga 
system and early CD drives for Amiga systems. The system allowed CD32 (CDTV) 
to boot from CD but not on other Amiga systems as the CDFS was disk based rather 
than Kickstart based. Other limitations included only able to read ISO 9660 based 
CD ROMs using short rather than long filenames used by RockRidge, Joliet and HFS.

   Since Workbench 1.3 other CD ROM file systems have been written such as 
AmiCDFS, AsimCDFS and CacheCDFS to replace the old 3.1 CD filesystem. CacheCDFS 
has been chosen to replace them as standard in the AmigaOS.

  CacheCDFS requires the CacheCDFS filesystem in L, a device driver in Devs: 
for ATAPI or SCSI based CD ROMs attached to the amiga and the CD0 DosDriver in 
Devs:DosDrivers suitably modified to load the filesystem for your CD ROM.
e.g.
      DEVICE=atapi.device
      UNIT=0

  As well as reading Data CDs, you can also play Music or audio CDs using the 
PlayCD program provided with CacheCDFS. This requires audio leads from the CDROM 
drive to some suitable speakers.

   Also, CacheCDFS has its own @{"Preferences" link Prefs} program.

@Endnode

@Node Inet "Internet"

@{u}Internet@{uu}

  Workbench upto 3.1 did not provide any provision for Peer-to-Peer, Dial-up 
Networks or even Local Area Networks. Commodore did develop SANA2 for its 
networks but was not widely used. Since the early 1990s, the Internet and the 
web has grown enormously and AmigaOS was left behind until third party 
companies wrote programs to support it such as:

TCP/IP: AmiTCP, Miami, Genesis
Browsers: Aweb, Voyager, IBrowse
Email: YAM, Thor, Microdot
FTP: AmFTP, AmiFTP
News: NewsRog, FFNews

  AmigaOS 3.5 has now included support for the Internet with some widely used 
programs:

@{b}Genesis@{ub}

  This program provides PPP and TCP/IP connection for access to the Internet 
via Dial-up Network through the public telephone system. All, you have to do 
is register with an Internet Provider who will provide a username, password, 
telephone and other details to allow you to connect up.

  Genesis replaces Miami from AmigaOS 3.5 and is a full TCP/IP and PPP
program for connection to the Internet.

@{b}AmigaMail@{ub}

  This program provides Electronic Mail access via POP3 accounts over the 
internet and can send mail via SMTP to mail servers very easily and quickly. 
All you need to do is specify your name, email account, SMTP and POP mail 
servers from your ISP via the Settings, Configure menu.

@{b}Aweb@{ub}

  AWeb II is the Web Browser which is a Special Edition version of the full 
commercial edition which supports standard HTML, Javascript, Secure pages via 
Miami SSL, cookies, autosearch via favourite search engines, Arexx, Netscape 
spoofing, edit source, cache browser, graphical printouts, and other features. 
The AWeb II SE does not support Multiple Windows or Hotlists. Update to full 
version is available from http://www.amitrix.com/.

@Node FFS64 "FastFileSystem"

@{u}Fast File System@{uu}

  Workbench 1.x used primarily OFS (OldFileSystem) and 1.3 introduced the 
FastFileSystem which gave better performance with the introduction of Hard 
Disks. Workbench 3.0 added extra features including International character 
support and Directory Caching.

  Over the years, hard disk sizes have grown enormously from the first 20Mb 
drive like the the A590 supplied by Commodore to 20Gb drives now. Unfortunately, 
the FFS is limited to addressing to the first 4Gb (2^32) and unable to read 
data beyond that without restarting from 0 and overwriting the start of the 
disk where the RDB (RigidDiskBlock) is stored.

  To overcome this problem, the @{b}New Style Device (NSD)@{ub} solution was 
developed which allow much larger hard disks by using the new FFS v45 and 
NSD patch (see @{"Setpatch" link ROM}) to allow AmigaOS to see the whole of 
the hard disk. Devices to be patched are in a Devs:NSDPatch.cfg configuration 
file.

  Further information about NSD can be found on the Amiga Developer CD in
DevInfo and DeviceDevelopment drawers.

@Node ROM "ROM Patches"

@{u}ROM Patches @{uu}

  Workbench 3.5 is a software only update and requires the Kickstart 3.1 ROM 
to be installed. Since various libraries, devices and other resources have 
are on ROM, they can only be patched in software during the boot up sequence. 
This is achiveved via the @{b}SETPATCH@{ub} command.

  The current SetPatch v44.16 command has the following options:

  QUIET                - Do not display any messages
  NOCACHE              - Turn off instruction and data caches on processor.
  REVERSE              - Stores patches in reverse order. Useful for CDTV developers.
  NOAGA                - Disables the AGA chipset
  NONSD                - Disables the New Style Device patches for Hard disks etc.
  PATCHCONFIGFILE=PCF  - Specify a different patch file
  PATCHCONFIGLINE=PCL  - Specify a new patch line here
  PATCHINFO or PI      - Display patches installed incl. devices
  FORCEUPDATE          - Force update
  KILLUPDATE           - Kill or remove update
  NOROMUPDATE          - Do not update ROM with patches
  DISABLEROMMODULES    - Disable ROM modules for a device
  SKIPROMUPDATES device- Skip ROM updates for a device
  SKIPROMMODULES device- As above
  WAITVALIDATE         - Wait for any validation of partition (if any) before booting


  The ROM updates are stored in a file called @{b}Devs:Amiga ROM Update@{ub}, 
  if not required it can be moved to SYS:Storage.

  If ROM updates are patched and the Amiga does not boot up and stays at a 
  black screen then you should edit the s/startup-sequenced and change the 
  Setpatch line to:

  e.g. Setpatch Quiet SkipRomUpdates scsi.device

  As well as the ROM updates, it makes the following patches as well:

  BOOL CheckIO() workaround
  Enable Advanced Graphics Modes (AGA)
  AmigaOS Copyright  (changed to Amiga Intl)
  ramlib signal usage
  stack size check for CON: RAW: RAM: PAR: PRT: SER: devices
  graphics/WritePixelLine8() patched
  graphics/WriteChunkyPixel() patched
  Memory Pools added

@Node PRINT "Printer Drivers"
  
@{u}Printer Drivers@{uu}

  Since Workbench 3.1, printer technology has moved on from the old impact Dot 
Matrix and Daisy Wheel printers to Inkjet and Laser Printers and the dpi range 
has increased dramatically so the old drivers did not do the new printers much 
justice. Also, the range of colours was limited to upto 4096 colours while new 
printers can do photo quality in millions of colours.

  Alternative printer drivers have appeared since WB 3.1 including IrSee's 
TurboPrint, Wolf Faust's CanonStudio and Print Studio, and various third party
Workbench drivers have been released on Aminet.

  The printer.device in Workbench has been improved with support for more
colours and faster as well for 68020 or above processors and has supplied some
more drivers especially the Hewlett Packard range. Drivers for Epson Stylus
and Canon BJC printers have yet to appear.

  New Drivers supplied include:

  HP Deskjet, Deskjet+, 310-340, 400-420C, 500-560C
  HP Deskjet  600-697C, 810C-895C, 970C

  HP Laserjet, Laserjet+, II, IIP, III, 4, 5, 6
  HP Laserjet  500, 1100, 2000, 2100, 3100, 4000
  HP Laserjet  5000, 8000

@Endnode
@Node PPC "PowerPC Support"

@{u}PowerPC Support@{uu}

  Most Amigas use the Motorola 680x0 processor for the operating system and 
application software. In the early 1990s, Motorola stopped development of the
680x0 processors after the 68060 was produced and moved onto the PowerPC 
RISC processor which was incompatible with the older processors.

  Phase 5 developed the BlizzardPPC and CybervisionPPC accelerator boards for
the A1200 and A4000 Amigas which had a at least a 68040 or 060 and a PPC 603 or
604 processor as a co-processor.

  Unfortunately, existing Amiga software will not run on the PPC processor cards
to take advantage of the faster processor. Therefore the PowerUP library was
developed to allow programmers to re-write software to use the new PPC processor.
Due to the dual nature of the cards, existing AmigaOS API calls will still only
run on the 68K and PPC code with run only on the PPC card. This can hit performance
due to Context Switching between processors. 

  Haage & Partner developed there own PowerPC support software called WarpOS which
wasn't as closely tied to the hardware as the PowerUp software. This software
works like PowerUp and even includes a PowerUp Emulation library. WarpOS is now
considered to be the standard for PowerPC programs on the Amiga. It is not an
OS as such like MorphOS which replaces AmigaOS but will allow PPC programs to
run on 68k/PPC based Amigas.

  There are a growing number of PPC programs available to use including the latest
3D games which will require a graphics card to run such as the Virge, Permedia
and now the Voodoo cards to run them. Some PPC demos are included on the AmigaOS
disk to try out.

@Node Icon "Colour Icons"

  There are currently four different icon systems available on the Amiga:
the old 4 colour icon system on Workbench, Magic Workbench which gives 3D style
8 colour icons, a NewIcon system for colourful 3D icons and the Workbench 3.5
@{b}Colour Icon@{ub} system which replaces them all. 

  Workbench now supports icon files (.info) with more colours to make them much
more attractive than before as early icons were limited to the available colour
palette sets (8 colours) before they become mis-coloured. The new @{b}IconEdit@{ub} now
supports 256 colours and has more tools available to create new icons with
out resorting to a paint package and convert them to icons.

  Workbench icons can now use Glow Icons with will 'glow' when selected and this
feature is also available in IconEdit.

@Endnode

@Node UTILS "Third Party Utilities"

@{u}Third Party Utilities@{uu}

  A number of third party contributions have been included on the AmigaOS 3.5 
CD which are now widely used by Amiga users. Details are listed below.

@{b}Graphics Card Drivers@{ub}

  AmigaOS only supports its own chipset via the graphics.library and does not
natively support graphics cards. Commodore did set up the EGS system but now 
has been superceeded by the @{b}Cybergraphics@{ub} and @{b}Picasso96@{ub}
compatible drivers.

  For 3D graphics such as cards as Virge, Permedia and Voodoo cards, Haage & 
Partner have written @{b}Warp3D@{ub} to allow 3D graphics on the Amiga.

@{b}Icon Convertion@{ub}

  There are currently four different icon systems available on the Amiga:
the old 4 colour icon system on Workbench, Magic Workbench which gives 3D style
8 colour icons, a NewIcon system for colourful 3D icons and the Workbench 3.5
Colour Icon system which replaces them all. 

  To convert between the different icon styles there are some conversion 
programs to convert between the different icon systems.

@{b}Locale catalogs@{ub}

  To make Workbench usable world wide, a number of localised catalogs for
Workbench for specific countries and languages are now available.

@{b}Other tools@{ub}

  There are a number of other tools, commodities, scripts and icons available
to use with AmigaOS 3.5. Just check out the documentation to see what they do.

@Endnode
@Node Media "Multimedia"

@{u}Multimedia@{uu}

@{b}Action@{ub}

  This utility provides facility to play AVI and MOV (Quicktime) movies.
The CD provides some film clips in the Videos drawer to try out.

@{b}CDPlay@{ub}

  This program allows you to play Audio tracks from CD discs.

@{b}Amplifier@{ub}

  This program will play popular MP3 audio files. A drawer of Audio
tracks are also provided on the CD in the Audio directory.

@Endnode
@Node Features "Additional Features"

@{b}BenchTrash@{ub}

 This program provides features like the Macintosh Trash. It provides
a global trash will option to delete or move files and eject media.

@{b}IOTools@{ub}

  This program provides tools for IOmega Zip drives including formatting,
parking, protection, eject and drive information.

@{b}UnArc@{ub}

  This provides a simple unarchiving program for LHA, LZX, ZIP, DMS etc to

cascading menus to launch your favourite programs. It found in the 
WBStartup drawer.

@{b}DefIcons@{ub}

  This program provides more meaningful default icons for iconless files
viewed on Workbench.

@{b}ViNCEd CLI@{ub}

  This is a CON: (console) replacement for the Shell. It features: preferences,
user definable macros and buttons, terminal emulation, full screen editing,
TAB expansion, clipboard support, localisation, iconification, and many more.

@{b}Font Cache@{ub}

  This program can cache fonts into memory so makes accessing fonts so much
faster than before.

@{b}RAWBInfo@{ub}

  This is a replacement for the standard Workbench icon Information box. It
provides: Drag and drop, tooltype changes, saving the icon, remap colors, 
remove frames, remove old images, default tool, drawer size and so on.

@{b}LoadMonDrvs@{ub}

  The command replaces several lines in the Startup-sequence with one command
to load the Monitor drivers from devs:.

@{b}WBCtrl@{ub}

  This program allows you to change some undocumented features of Workbench 
such as Fast memory for icons, enable/disable volume gauges, enable/disable
the title bar, lock pens and so on.
