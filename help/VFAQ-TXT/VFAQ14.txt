1.0   About the Voyager FAQ

   This section describes the FAQ itself -- what it is, where you can
get it, who wrote it, and where to find it.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

1.1   What is the Voyager FAQ?

   A  FAQ  is  a  list of "Frequently Asked Questions" and typically, their
answers.   This  FAQ is dedicated to the Voyager Browser for the Amiga line
of  computers,  written  by  Oliver  Wagner  of  Vapor,  Inc.  Voyager is a
shareware product.

   The  FAQ  was  created  because  the authors noticed a growing number of
questions in the Voyager Mailing List dealt with the same subjects over and
over  again.   To reduce this, and to provide users who are not part of the
mailing list with some answers, the FAQ was created.

   Most  of  the  information  in  this  FAQ comes either directly from the
experience of the authors or from postings in the mailing list.

   For more information on the Voyager mailing list, see Section 5.0.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

1.2   Who is responsible for the FAQ?

   The FAQ is written and maintained by Ben C.  Steeves.

   Original  mailing-list traffic archives, which provide the basis of much
of the information in this FAQ, were provided by Alan Crandall.

   Unless  otherwise  stated, all questions and answers were written by Ben
C.  Steeves.  In cases where this is _not_ true (ie, the question or answer
was  donated to the FAQ) the original contributor's name is presented.  Any
information  not  directly  from  Ben's  experience  has  the  contributing
author's name in square brackets at the end of the paragraph.  [Like This]

   Ben  is  responsible  for  editing  contributions to the FAQ to increase
their  readability  and  clarity.   Any errors introduced at this point are
probably  his.   Ben attempts to verify any answer that appears in the FAQ.
In  cases  where  he  is  not  100%  sure of the answer, a suitable note is
presented.

   Currently,  the  FAQ  is  available in ASCII text, Amigaguide, HTML, and
printed format.  If you have any suggestions for other forms the FAQ should
be available in, contact Ben.

   There is a German translation of the FAQ handled by Andreas Mas Marques.
You can find out how to contact Andreas in Section 1.3.  If you find errors
in the German version, contact Andreas first.

   IF  YOU SEE AN ERROR IN THE FAQ, CONTACT BEN IMMEDIATELY!!!  See Section
1.3 for information on contacting Ben.

1.4   How do I get the FAQ?

   The FAQ currently exists in four forms: ASCII text, Amigaguide, HTML, and
printed.  You can get them from:

   ASCII English text available from:

      http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/bcs/VFAQ-txt.lha
      Aminet: docs/help/VFAQ-txt.lha

   ASCII German text available from:

      Aminet: docs/hyper/VFAQG-AG.lha

   English HTML files:

      http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/bcs/VFAQ-HTML.lha
      Aminet: docs/hyper/VFAQ-HTML.lha 

   German HTML files:

      http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/bcs/VFAQG-HTML.lha
      Aminet: docs/hyper/VFAQG-HTML.lha 

   HTML (Either English or German) available at:

      http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/bcs/VFAQ/


   Printed format:

   The  printed  version of the FAQ is not just a straight dump of the text
version.   It  contains formatting and fontted text, and is generally nicer
to look at than this version.

   To  receive  a  single  copy  of  the  Voyager FAQ, send $1CDN (or local
equivalent)   and  a  Self-Addressed  Stamped  Envelope  (postage  must  be
sufficient  for  a standard letter from Canada to your country) to Benjamin
C.   Steeves  (snail-mail  address  available in Sec 1.3).  In one to three
weeks  you  will  receive  a laser-printed version of the current FAQ.  The
dollar  is  to  cover my printing costs.  Please specify whether or not you
want the English or German version of the FAQ.

   If  you wish to receive a monthly mailing of the FAQ, send $15CDN to Ben
C.   Steeves.   This  will  entitle  you  to  12 mailings of the FAQ (it is
updated  each  month).   If the FAQ does not change for one month, you will
not  receive  a  duplicate  of  last month's, but you will still receive 12
mailings  (ie  if  you  subscribe in January 1998 and there is no change in
July 1998 (ie the June and July mailing are the same) then you will receive
an  "extra"  copy next February 1999).  Again, the $15 is to cover printing
and mailing costs.

   In  either  case,  if you want the FAQ sent in an 8.5x11 envelope (so it
won't  be  folded),  indicate  this, and, if you're ordering a single copy,
include the envelope.  Unless you indicate otherwise, the FAQ will be sent
in a standard #10 business envelope, folded.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

1.5   What is the latest version of the FAQ?

   This is Volume 1, Issue 5 of the FAQ, released on October 31, 1997.

   This  is  version  1.4.   See  the  Version  History  at the end of this
section.

   In  months  where there are no changes to the FAQ, the issue number will
increase even if the version number doesn't.

   The  Voyager FAQ is edited monthly and released on the last day of every
month.   It  may take up to a week for the new version to propagate through
the web.  ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE MOST RECENT VERSON!

   The FAQ was first released on June 30, 1997.

   The most recent version of the FAQ will always be available at:

                   http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/bcs/VFAQ/

how to get in touch with Ben).

++=======================================================================++

2.0   The Voyager Program

   This  is  the main section of the FAQ, discussing questions that have to
do  with  the  Voyager  program  and  it's  interactions  with your Amiga's
hardware and software.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.1   What is the current version of Voyager?

   The  current release version of Voyager is 2.88.  

   A beta version of 2.91 is available to registered users.

   There are two executables in the current build of Voyager, one for 
MC68000 machines and one for MC68030 machines with an FPU.

   DO NOT TRY TO USE THE MC68030/FPU VERSION ON A MACHINE WITHOUT AN FPU!

   It will result in a crash.

   The 68030/FPU version is suitable to for use on MC68040/MC68060 machines.
Oliver Wagner (the programmer of Voyager) has promised a 040/060 compile
in the next release.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.2   Why does Voyager crash all the time?

   This  is  a general question with a general answer.  Some people have no
problems  with Voyager crashing, while others can't seem to use it for more
than a few minutes at a time.

   Most  often,  the  problem  with intermitent crashing is caused by other
programs  present  in  your  system.   Try removing older patches from your
system  first, as these are usually more poorly written than newer patches.
Programs  that effect your user interface (ie, programs that change the way
your  Amiga's  GUI  performs  or  looks) are the most common culprits.  Try
removing patches one at a time until Voyager stops crashing so often.

   If there is patch software you _must_ run, make sure you have the most 
recent versions.  Always make sure you're running the most recent version
of SetPatch (available from ftp://www.amiga.de/).  

   Some  people  have reported success by replacing their patching software
with  MCP -- a program that performs a bunch of different patches in a safe
way.   It's  available  from  Aminet.   Other people have reported that the
mouse blanking patch in MCP crashed Voyager's Image Decoding Process [Jason
Eyre, Voyager Mailing List].

   Also  make  sure  you  have sufficient memory to run Voyager.  Check the
size  of  your  memory  cache,  and  turn  off  image  caching.   Voyager's
low-memory  handling  routines  are  slightly  buggy  and may cause crashes
[Oliver Wagner, Voyager Mailing List].

   Another  possible  route  for people with low memory is to try a virtual
memory program such as VMM.  See Section 2.2.1.

        -----------------------------------------------------------        

2.2.1 How do I use VM with Voyager?

   VM, or Virtual Memory, is very common on PCs and Macs, but not so much
on Amigas.  Voyager would benefit greatly by virtual memory, however. 

There  are  several  virtual  memory management programs you can obtain for
your  Amiga, but VMM (available on Aminet) is a very popular one.  Although
it's  a lot slower than actual RAM, you will have the benefit of being able
to  use  Voyager  for  much  longer periods of time.  Even large JPEG files
decode  without  crashing.  If you don't trust Virtual Memory programs, you
can  set  most  of  them  up  so  only Voyager and Voyager's Image Decoding
Process will use Virtual Memory.  [answer submitted by Sebastiano Vigna]

   Sebastiano has this to say on the subject of configuring VMM:

   "If  you  want  to configure VMM in order to force it on Voyager, you'll
probably  use  the  "AddTask" option and select "V" and "V's Image Dec...".
However,  for  unknown  reason VMM just retains the first few characters of
the name of the second process.  In order to avoid this, as soon as you add
the  entry  to  the  task  list, you must select it and press return in the
relative  string  gadget.   This  way (or typing manually the name) it will
work.  I don't know, however, if this is a problem of my machine only."

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.3   Why does Voyager eat all my CHIP RAM?

   On  a machine without a graphics card, Voyager must display all graphics
from  CHIP  RAM.   This  is  the  way  the  Amiga archetecture is designed.
However,  the  current  version  of  Voyager  does  not behave correctly in
low-memory  situations.  To avoid having you machine crash when you run out
of CHIP RAM, ensure you have the memory cache disabled.  Also, quitting and
restarting Voyager to free up CHIP RAM might not be a bad idea.

   Voyager  runs best with as much CHIP RAM as possible.  If you're running
an AGA machine, you may benefit by running Voyager on your Workbench screen
(thus  minimizing  the amount of CHIP RAM taken up by extra screens).  On a
machine  with a graphics card, you should load all graphics into the card's
on-board memory.  Most, if not all cards do this by default anyway.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.4   Why does Voyager use MUI?  I *hate* MUI!

   MUI  (Magic User Interface) is a program & API designed by Stefan Stuntz
that  allows  users  to  configure  nearly  every  apsect of the GUI of MUI
programs.   For  devlopers,  however,  MUI  allows much more freedom in the
design  of  GUI's.  Not only does it increase the efficiency with which the
programmer  can  build  a  GUI, it provides a great deal of object-oriented
tools for GUI maintenance.

   Without  MUI,  Voyager would not exist.  If it *did* exist in some form,
the  executable would be many times larger, would require much more memory,
and be far less efficient.  [Oliver Wagner, Voyager Mailing List].

   The  benefit  of  MUI is that it is uses a series of *shared* libraries.
Thus,  if  one  program  in  your  system has opened the MUI libraries, all
programs  that  use them will use the SAME COPY of the library, thus saving
memory.   Otherwise, your mailer, your browser, your newsgroup reader, your
telnet  client, etc., would each have to have their own user-interface code
and would take much more memory and hard-drive space.

   Among its other benefits, MUI is a way of consolidating the memory/space
usage of a variety of programs.  Not only does it make life easier on users
by  providing  the  ability to customize every aspect of their programs, it
makes life *MUCH* easier for programmers.

   Oliver Wagner, the programmer of Voyager, has stated on several occasions
that Voyager WOULD NOT EXIST without MUI.  So, the real question is:  do you
like Voyager more than you hate MUI?

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.5   Can I change the Voyager buttons?

   The  buttons  (Back,  Forward,  Reload,  Print,  etc...)  are built into
Voyager.   You  can't  change them.  There are GIF images of the buttons in
the  VOYAGER:voyager_home/ directory, but these only effect the images that
are displayed in the HTML documentation, not the program itself.

   Many people have asked for them to be made configurable, so Oliver may
be working on it.  

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.6  Can I change the Voyager transfer animation?

   Yes.   The  transfer animation is in a file called "TransferAnim" in the
Voyager  main  directory.   You  can put any graphic you like in here.  The
format  of  the  transfer animation is quite simple:  it is a series of IFF
brushes  strung  together,  one  after  another, in a line.  The width of a
single  image  is  stored  in a tooltype (WIDTH=) of the .info file for the
transfer animation.  Set WIDTH= to the proper value for your brushes.

   Whether  or not the transfer animation is shown is selected by an option
in  the  General Settings panel.  A checkbox selector marked "Hide Transfer
Anim Icon?" should be UNCHECKED if you want to see the transfer animation.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.7   How do I configure Voyager to send mail?

   For Voyager to send mail, you need to do two things:

   1)  Make sure the Mail/News Settings Panel is properly filled out.  Make
absolutely sure that your SMTP server is correct.  You can check this value
with your Internet Service Provider.

   2)  Make  sure  you  have  the  correct version of textview or textinput
installed.   For  more information on these MUI custom classes, see Section
2.19 .

   There are buttons in the Mail/News Settings Panel marked "Mail app:" and
"News  app:".   These  are  ghosted because Oliver has not implemented them
yet.  They are options for a future version of Voyager.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.8   How do I configure Voyager to read news?

   Reading news is supported by Voyager, however a few people have reported
that Voyager crashes while trying to read news.  There is no known cure for
these crashes (at least, no one has told me of any).

   Configuring  Voyager  to  read news, however, is simple:  make sure that
the Mail/News Settings Panel in Voyager is set correctly.  Ensure that your
e-mail address and NNTP server are correct.

   In  the  current version of Voyager, the "Mail app" and "News app" boxes
are  ghosted.   These are features that will be present in a future version
of Voyager.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.9   What does the "Find" button do?

   Unlike most browsers, the "Find" button runs a Voyager-plugin that sends
your search query to four different WWW search engines.  The responses from
these  search  engines  then  pops  up  in a quarter of the Voyager window,
separated  by  frames.   To  view  the  frame  full  size,  use  the  right
mouse-button menu "View Frame Full Window".

   Currently there is no document search option in Voyager.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.10  What is the "Plugin" directory for?

   The "Plugin" directory is meant to hold specially designed programs that
extend   Voyager's   functions.    In   the  current  release  of  Voyager,
Search.VPlug is bundled with Voyager.

   The  plugin  "Voyager_SSLeay.vlib"  is  responsible  for  providing  SSL
support in Voyager.  More information on SSL can be found in Section 4.0.

        -----------------------------------------------------------

2.10.1   Where can I get more plugins?

   Currently,  there  are  no other plugins for Voyager, other than the SSL
and Search ones.

   Most people use the plugin directory to store small applications used to
view certain MIME types, such as MPEG video, and WAV audio.

   This sort of plugin can be found at http://hem.passagen.se/dreamman/

   On  this  site you will find pointers to the necessary files, as well as
the proper settings to get them working with Voyager.

        -----------------------------------------------------------

2.10.2   Can I write my own plugins?

   There is a mailing list for people interested in writting plugins for
Voyager, as well as a description of the plugin API, available on the
Vapor home page, http://www.vapor.com.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.11  Voyager invalidates my hard drive!  Why?

   If  a  crash  occurs  while  Voyager  is  writing to the disk-cache, the
partition  may  be  corrupted,  causing an invalidation.  Besides examining
questions 2.2 and 2.3 to alieviate the crashing problems, there are certain
precautions you can take to avoid invalidations:

1)  Redirect  Voyager's  cache to RAM:  or a recoverable drive such as RAD:
or  SD0:.   This  way, if the machine crashes, you will not lose the cache.
You *will* lose the cache if the machine is switched off or you store it in
RAM,  of  course.  RAD and SD0 are names of RAM disks that don't get purged
when  the machine is warm-booted.  

2)  Put  the  cache  on  a  small  partition.  Putting the cache on a small
partition, say 10MB or so, will ensure that any invalidations are corrected
swiftly.   AmigaOS  appears  to  validate small partitions MUCH faster than
large ones.  This small-partition approach has the added advantage that you
can format the parition and lose very little.

3)  Disable the cache altogether.  

   Some people don't mind losing the cache, so how "persistant" you want it
is  the  issue.   If you want a very persistant cache, write it to the hard
drive.   If  you  want a somewhat persistant cache that will last until the
machine  is  shut  off,  write  it to RAD or SD0.  If you don't care if the
cache remains from one session to the next, put it in RAM or turn it off.

   Some  people  have installed AFS -- an alternative file system for Amiga
hard  drives.   This file system does not invalidate the hard drive when it
crashes,  but  has  been  known to cause other problems.  A demo version is
available on Aminet.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.12  How do I start another instance of Voyager if one crashes?

   Create an empty file in your S:  directory called 'V-DEBUG' (without the
quotes).   This  will  allow  you to start Voyager more than once.  Keep in
mind  that  the  original  condition  that caused the first crash may still
exist, and if so, the second instance may also crash.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.13  I have a floppy based system and I want to run Voyager.  Can I?

   Sure!   If  you  can  squeeze  the  necessary  files onto a single disk.
Disable  all  caching  (or point it to memory, if you have lots), and don't
expect  to be able to download much at all.  A minimal MUI install is still
necessary, however, so make sure this is available.

   Really,  if  you're  going  to  be  surfing  the  web,  a  hard drive is
practically a necessity.  These days everyone should have one anyway.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.14  Does Voyager use datatypes?

   The  only  place  where  Voyager  uses  datatypes  is  for  the transfer
animation.   Datatypes  have  not been used for page graphics in the recent
versions.   JPEG,  PNG,  GIF  are all supported internally.  If you wish to
support  other  graphic  formats,  you  will  have  to  set  the MIME types
accordingly.  See question 2.10.1 for more information about MIME.

   If  you're  having trouble viewing the transfer animation, first look at
question  2.6,  and  check  to  make  sure  you  have  the proper datatypes
installed to view it.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.15  Voyager doesn't print right for me.  Why?

   Printing in Voyager is somewhat primitive, compared to the print quality
one  would get on a workstation or Windows PC.  The reason for this is that
PC's  have  OS  routines to handle printing at the very high-resolutions of
printers.   The  Amiga  does  not.   Voyager  prints  the  pages  at screen
resolution,  rather  than printer resolution, and this causes a degredation
in the quality of printed text.

   Voyager  also  cannot print from any screen depth higher than 8 bit (256
color).  This is a limitation of the printer.device.

   Voyager  also  has  a  problem  printing  pages that are longer than one
8.5x11  inch  piece of paper on sheet-fed printers (ie, laser or bubble jet
printers).   Voyager  will  print  the  first sheet and then stop.  This is
because  Voyager  sends  the  web-page  as a large bitmap, and many printer
drivers do not support continuous page graphic dumps.

   Some  people  have  reported  success when using Epson emulation mode on
their  printers  to  send formfeeds at the end of each page.  It seems that
Voyager's printing problems have to do with formfeeds not being sent.

   Canon  BJ  printer  users may have a solution:  using the latest drivers
from  Canon  Europe,  it  may  be possible to get entire web-pages to print
while in Epson 48-pin emulation mode.  In the native BJC modes, the drivers
will not formfeed correctly.  [The Duke of Prunes <kcsmart@swbell.net>].

   If  you  can somehow set your printer to add a formfeed automatically at
the  end  of  every  printed  page,  this  *may* solve some of your Voyager
printing problems.

        -----------------------------------------------------------        

2.15.1  Voyager's printouts look bad.  Why?

   That can depend on a lot of things, the most obvious of which is a bad
printer.  If that's not the case, then the major reason is probably the fact
that the Amiga doesn't have a real printing engine.  It relies on the program
doing the printing to render the output properly for the printer.  

   The  problem  with  this  is  that screen resolution is roughly equal to
75dpi  (dots per inch) while most printers are 300dpi or even 600dpi.  This
means  that  text will probably not look very good, as it is being rendered
at screen resolution.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.16  Can I export files from the cache, keeping the directory structure?
      [Question by Boris Bijelic]

   Not with the current release of the cache browser.  

   When  you  save files using the cache browser, you do so by clicking the
"Copy"  or  "Copy  All"  button on the "action" pane of the cache browser's
window.   This  then opens a requester asking where you want the files.  If
you  use  the  "Copy"  button on multiple files, it asks for a location for
each  file.  At this point you could manually create the required directory
structure.   The  "Copy  all"  button  copys all selected files to a single
directory you chose.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.17  Why do I get black boxes where graphics are supposed to appear?

   This has been attributed over and over again to older versions of 
Cybergraphx and/or old versions of the picture.datatype.  Update both
to the current versions at http://www.vgr.com.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.18  Why does Voyager take so long to start up/shut down?

   If  Voyager  takes  a  long  time to start up on your machine, check the
fonts  you  are using.  You can find this information in the Fonts panel of
the Settings Window.  If any of the fonts are CompuGraphic, they will add
a considerable amount of time to the length of Voyager's startup.  

   CompuGraphic  fonts  (such  as CGTimes, CGTriumvirate, and LetterGothic)
have  to be calculated every time they are used, and these calculations can
take a long time if you have a slower Amiga (it's not even very snappy on a
50MHz  '060).   The  solution is to either switch to bitmap fonts or create
bitmaps  of  the  sizes  of CG fonts Voyager uses.  Fountain or Intellifont
(one  of which you will find in the "System" drawer on your Workbench disk:
Fountain  for  OS2 and Intellifont for OS3) can generate bitmap versions of
CompuGraphic  fonts.  Once you've done this, you will notice a considerable
speed increase when Voyager starts up.

   Shutdown  is,  however, a different matter.  When Voyager shuts down, it
performs  an update of the cache file "URL-History.x" -- this file contains
history  information  about  every  URL  you  have visited.  In the General
settings  panel  of  the  Settings  Window there is a field which is marked
"Followed  links expire after xx days", where xx is a string gadget you can
change.  If you leave your cache on disk, this file can grow quite large if
the  expiry  length  is  long  (the default is a month and in that time the
URL-history  file  can  grow to several megabytes).  If this file grows too
large, it can take a long time to update when Voyager quits.

   Also,  if  you  keep  your cache on a small partition, writes can take a
long time when the parition is nearly full.  It's a good idea to format the
cache partition periodically.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.19  What are textview.mcc and textinput.mcc?

   They  are  both  MUI  custom  classes used to open up windows and string
gadgets in Voyager.

   Older  versions  of  Voyager  (pre-2.88)  used  Textview.mcc,  by E.  F.
Pritchard.   Due  to some confusion over versions of textview.mcc (and some
known   bugs),   Oliver   Wagner   wrote   TextInput.mcc,   which  replaces
Textview.mcc.  

   To  use  Voyager, you must have the proper MUI custom class installed in
your  LIBS:MUI/  directory.   If  you've installed a new version of Voyager
(after  2.88),  you  can remove Textview.mcc UNLESS you have other programs
which rely on it.

   This  is  a  general warning:  DO NOT DELETE ANYTHING FROM THE LIBS:MUI/
DIRECTORY!  If you want to get rid of something, **MOVE** it elsewhere.  If
your  system  behaves  as  expected  with  the MUI custom class gone, it is
reasonable  to  assume nothing you are running requires that class anymore.
But you should only do this if you *KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING*.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.20  I wrote a bug report to Olli and he never wrote back!

   Oliver  Wagner  is  a very busy man.  On top of Voyager, AmIRC, and many
other Amiga projects he's involved with, he also has a real job.  According
to  Olli, he prints out all of the bug reports he receives from e-mail, the
newsgroup, and BugTrack.  He then goes through them one by one.  Most often
the  bug is a "known", or a "fixed", which means he either knows of the bug
but  hasn't  fixed  it  yet, or its fixed in his working code.  Either way,
telling him for the millionth time isn't helping...  it's just slowing down
the development of Voyager.

   Once  you've  made  a  bug report, consider it looked after, even if you
don't  receive  a  response.   If  Olli  responded  personally to every bug
report, he'd never get anything done!

   When  you  do  submit  a  bug  report,  ensure  that you include all the
relevant information -- your computer's configuration, software and patches
you  run, the state of Voyager at the time, and Enforcer output if you can.
Anything you can tell him is potentially useful.

               ***  DO  NOT  POST  LENGTHY  BUG  REPORT  ***
               ***   DATA  (IE, ENFORCER HITS) TO THE    ***
               ***             NEWSGROUP!!!              ***

   Some  people  pay  for  every  minute  they're on-line, and no one likes
getting  a 47K e-mail they don't need or want (and remember, not everyone's
cruising at 56Kbps).

++=======================================================================++

3.0   Voyager and the Web

   This  section  covers  questions  that have to do with how Voyager deals
with certain aspects of the World Wide Web.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.1   Does Voyager support frames?

   Yes,   it   does.   Voyager  supports  standard  frames  tags,  such  as
<FRAMESET>,  <NOFRAME>,  <FRAME  SRC=>,  and  the  <TARGET>  directive.  It
currently does not support the SCROLLING boolean value.  In other words, if
you  have  a frame that is set to SCROLLING=NO, you will still be able move
it.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.2   Does Voyager support Java-Script?

   No.  Java-Script is not supported by Voyager in its current version.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.2.1 If it doesn't support J-S, what's this jslib thing?

   The jslib.library was a stub library that Oliver Wagner used in older
versions   of  Voyager.   From  Voyager  2.88,  the  browser  just  ignores
javascript  code.  This has some unpredictable effects, but mostly you will
look at javascript pages without even realizing there is javascript there.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.3   Does Voyager support Java?

   Not  yet.  Oliver Wagner and Haage & Partner GmbH are reportedly working
on  bringing  Java  to  the Amiga (and Voyager) some time during the summer
months of 1997.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.4   Does Voyager support anonymous browsing?

   Voyager  has an option in its Security Settings panel that can be turned
on  to  inhibit Voyager from sending the Referer:  HTTP header.  This means
that  if  the  server relies on the Referer:  tag to identify you, then you
are effectively browsing anonymously when this is inhibited (turned ON).

   The problem is that a lot of servers are more devious than simply trying
to  use  the Referer:  header.  If you *really* need anonymous browsing, an
anonymizing  proxy  (such  as  www.anonymizer.com)  can  be more effective.
Proxies are set in the Net Settings panel.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.5   Does Voyager support SSL?

   Yes.  Voyager supports SSL through two different methods:  either 
MiamiSSL, or through Voyager_SSLeay.vlib.  If you don't use Miami, the
Voyager_SSLeay.vlib will provide the SSL support for you.

   For more information on SSL, see section 4.0.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.6   Can I make servers think Voyager is some other browser?

   If  you  are trying to access a site that checks to see what browser you
are running, and it is denying you because it doesn't like Voyager, you can
make  the  server  think  you  are  running  a different, more "mainstream"
browser.

   As  of version 2.91, there is a menu option that allows you to "Spoof as
Mozilla"  under  Settings.   It's a check-mark option that can be turned on
and off during browsing.

   If you're using V2.88 or earlier, there is still a way to make it spoof,
but it's more permanent and more difficult to do:

   To  do  this,  you  must  have  a  little experience using a hex-editing
program, such as AZap.

   The  procedure  is  this:   open  the  V  executable in your hex-editor.
Search  for  the  string  "User-Agent".  It occurs twice in the executable.
The  field  of  this  string  is "AmigaVoyager/2.88 (AmigaOS 3.x)".  If you
change  this  string  to  read  something  else, then Voyager will send the
changed  string  when  asked  to  identify  itself.   You must replace both
instances of the "AmigaVoyager/2.88 (AmigaOS 3.x)" string in order for this
spoof to work.

   To make servers think you are a popular browser, you might try :

                     "Mozilla/3.01 (Voyager Spoofing)"

   Remember to back up your V executable before you try this.  Don't try it
unless you're comfortable using a hex editor!

        -----------------------------------------------------------        

3.6.1 What is "spoofing", anyway?

   "Spoofing"  is  a  web-browser  term  which means tricking a server into
thinking  your  client  (web  browser)  is  not  what it is, but is in fact
some other client.

   Confused?   Don't  be.   Essentially  what it means is this:  if you use
Voyager  on  a  site  that  checks to see what browser you are using and it
won't  let  you  in because you're not using Netscape or Internet Explorer,
you  can  fool  the  server  into  thinking  you *ARE* Netscape or Internet
Explorer  by  "spoofing"  it.  The site will then treat you just like those
omnipresent browsers.  

   A  word  of  warning  though:   if the site is testing to see if you are
using  Netscape  or  Internet  Explorer,  it  may be because that site uses
non-standard  HTML  (or  Java or Java-Script) that Voyager doesn't support.
If that's the case, you might not enjoy your stay on the site anyway.

   I'll repeat that:  SPOOFING DOES NOT TURN VOYAGER INTO NETSCAPE.  It just
makes Voyager "look" like Netscape to the server machine.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.7   When will Voyager support (insert HTML tag here)?

   Voyager is largely the product of one man:  Oliver Wagner.  Oliver has a
"real"  job  that  doesn't  include  writing  Voyager or the other internet
programs he writes for the Amiga.

   As  such,  Oliver  works on Voyager when he can, but he's not a machine!
If  Voyager  doesn't support something you want, feel free to mention it in
the Voyager Mailing List, but, if Oliver doesn't write a personal response,
or  it  doesn't show up in a new version a week later, relax!  Rest assured
that  Oliver  hears  and  sees all, and will get to your suggestion when he
can, and if he can.

   Currently, Voyager supports most (if not all) of HTML 3.2.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.8   What's VRML?  Does Voyager do it?

   "VRML  stands  for  Virtual  Reality  Markup Language and is (like HTML)
another  standard  for  publishing.   In  case  of  VRML  it's  a series of
guidelines  on  how  to make Webpages with an Virtual Reality interface..."
[Ewald Borger]

   A  VRML  plugin is in design for IBrowse, but the programmer has made no
comment on whether or not it will work in Voyager when it is finished.

++=======================================================================++

4.0   Voyager and the Secure Socket Layer

   This  section  describes  how  Voyager  manages SSL -- The Secure Socket
Layer that allows you to conduct encrypted transactions over the web.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

4.1   What is SSL, anyway?

   SSL  stands  for  Secure Socket Layer.  It was invented at Netscape as a
means  of encrypting data that is to be sent over HTTP (hyper text transfer
protocol)  connections.   Whenever  you  visit  a  site  whose URL (Uniform
Resource  Locator) begins with https:// (rather than the usual http://) you
are dealing with a potentially secure site.

   Ideally, SSL is transparent to the user.  When you access a secure site,
your  browser  and the server should negotiate a suitable encryption method
and then your surfing should continue uninterupted.

   Unlike  Netscape  and  Microsoft  Internet  Explorer, there is no visual
change  in Voyager's GUI when you are accessing a secure site (eg, Netscape
borders  the view window in blue a displays a small icon of an unbroken key
when  you  are surfing a secure site).  If in doubt, check the URL box.  If
it begins https://, then chances are you are surfing securely.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

4.2   How does Voyager handle SSL?

   Voyager   implements   SSL   through   the  use  of  SSLeay  (pronounced
S-S-L-e-a-y).    SSLeay  implements  SSLv2.   As  of  this  edition,  SSLv3
implementation is available only in SSLeay-0.8.0.

   Current  versions of SSLeay implement DES, RSA, RC4, IDEA, and Blowfish.
The  version used in Voyager is SSLeay 0.6.6, which supports RC4, IDEA, and
DES.

   Because  of  US  patent  laws,  there  is a very strong possibility that
SSLeay  cannot  legally  be  used  inside  the United States or Canada.  To
access  secure  sites while you and your computer are within the borders of
these  nations,  you  must  use the MiamiSSL library, which is supported by
Miami2.1  and  above.   You  can  get  the  latest  MiamiSSL  release  from
http://www.nordicglobal.com/.

   Once again, IT IS MOST LIKELY ILLEGAL TO USE SSLEAY WITHIN CANADA OR THE
UNITED STATES.

   This is taken from the SSLeay FAQ:

                                   --- 
In short:

-> outside the USA there should be no problems

->  inside the USA RSA hold patents over the RSA algorithms, however if you
use  RSAREF  (which SSLeay can link to) then non-commercial use is probably
okay.  RSAREF can also be licensed for commercial use from Consensus.

->IDEA  may  be a problem inside Europe and RC4 inside the USA; both can be
removed  with  a  simple  compile-time option or you can simply licence the
IDEA algorithm.
                                   --- 

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

4.3   How about exporting encryption algorithms?

   This  is a somewhat grey area.  Until recently, it was illegal to export
strong  encryption  from  the  United States and Canada.  Over the last few
weeks,  the  US  government  has begun to change their policies on this, by
allowing  Netscape  and  Microsoft to export web-browsers containing strong
encryption code.

   What  this  means  for  Voyager  users  is somewhat up in the air at the
moment.

   What  is  not in dispute is that some encryption algorthims are patented
by  RSA  Laboratories,  Inc.   The  code  to  these  algorithms *cannot* be
exported, but international "versions" of these algorithms do exist that do
not  use  the RSA code.  SSLeay, the library that the international version
of Voyager uses, is such a "version".

++=======================================================================++

5.0   Further Information

   In  this  section you will find pointers to other sources of information
about Amiga Voyager.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5.1   Where can I get documentation for Voyager?

   Voyager's documentation is available in HTML format from the Vapor web
site.  Point your browser at ftp://146.189.18.33/pub/voyager/ and download
the file vng_docs_v3.(lha|lzx).  

   This documentation covers all versions of Voyager below 3.0, which is
yet to be released.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5.2   Is there a Mailing List?

   Yes.   The  Voyager mailing list is extremely active, and a great source
of  information  about  Voyager.   To  subscribe  to  it, send a message to
voyager-request@vapor.com with the word "ADD" in the mail message BODY.

   The  mailing-list  server  will  respond with a welcome message and some
instructions.    SAVE   THESE   INSTRUCTIONS!!!   They  will  prevent  your
embarrassment  later  on,  if  you want to delete yourself from the mailing
list.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5.3   Is there a newsgroup?

   No,   there  is  currently  no  Voyager  newsgroup.   Some  people  were
petitioning for one in the early weeks of June, 1997, but nothing ever came
of  it.   The  general consensus seems to be that the mailing list (see Sec
5.2) is sufficent.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5.4   Is there an official Voyager website?

   Yes.  Point your browser at http://www.vapor.com/ for support of Voyager
and other Vapor products.
