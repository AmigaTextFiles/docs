@node Introduction

	For as long as I have been using my Amiga, there has been little 
or no information, except for some kind folks on the IRC channel #amiga, 
on setting up SLIP, trouble shooting your setup and using it to its 
fullest with your Amiga.  Although, admitedly, I am no Internet/SLIP/PPP 
guru, I had to learn from the school of hard knocks to get my SLIP setup 
running.  I had to do it with almost no outside help.  

	In the following article I will review several programs relating 
to SLIP usage and try to clear up some points that seem to give beginners 
the most trouble.  And remember this;  If I Can Set It Up, Anyone Can.

	If you use this file and find it useful, please send me an 
@{" e-mail " link author} with any suggestions on improvement.  Any suggestions may be 
included in any future updates.

@node Terms

First some terms I may use frequently in this document;

FTP - File Transfer Protocol
	- Use this program to get files off of your favorite remote 
	  server.

Gopher
	- While getting rather antiquated because of the WWW browsers, 
	  the Gopher style interface is still useful sometimes.  
	  Especially when connecting to older style interfaces of some 
	  servers.

Internet Provider 
	- The person(s) or corporation or entity which provides you with 
	  your internet access.  Usually used in reference to the 
	  computers which provide you the means to use internet.

IP Address -
	- This is the numerical address which every server has.  You will
	  almost always use a name when connecting to other servers, 
	  i.e. FTP.WUSTL.EDU  But, you could also connect there by 
	  using its equivalent IP Address of 128.225.135.4 

IRC - Internet Relay Chat
	- This is a place where you can have a realtime chat with 
	  literally hundreds of users around the globe.  There are 
	  literally hundreds of channels available.  My favorite 
	  is @{" #amiga " link AUTHOR}  

NNTP - Net News Transfer Protocol (Thanks to Sam Wise & Sander de Bruijn)
	- This is the transfer protocol used for Usenet News

Pop Mail - Post Office Protocol Mail (Thanks to Sander de Bruijn)
	- If set up, your computer will periodically check your Pop Mail
          address for new e-mail, and will inform you if there is any.  Pop
	  mail is also used with servers which don't have SMTP Daemons.

SLIP - Serial Line Internet Protocol
	- This is the interface used to communicate between your computer 
	  and the remote internet provider.

SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (Thanks to Sam Wise & Sander de Bruijn)
	- This is the transfer protocol used for most E-Mail transfers.

Usenet News
	- Usenet is a place where you can read up on what is going on with
	  your favorite pastimes.  Depending on how kind your provider is,
	  you can have hundreds, possibly thousands, of available subjects.
	  Usenet is networked world wide.
 
WWW - World Wide Web
	- Just another way to 'surf the net'.  WWW Browsers use graphical
	  point and click interfaces.  Sound and graphics files can be 
	  accessed by WWW browsers.
@endnode

@node Requirements

	One of the questions I here most on #amiga and Usenet is "What do I
need for hardware to set up SLIP on my Amiga?"  Well, the answer is that
you can set up SLIP and its related programs (IRC, Usenet News Browser,
Mail Client, WWW Browser, FTP Clent, etc) on any Amiga with a modem.  Most
(if not all) SLIP providers require at least a 14,400 baud modem. I would 
recommend at least 1 meg of chip ram and 2 megs of fast ram.  KickStart and
Workbench 3.1 would be desireable, but not necessary.  My system includes;

	Amiga 500 (Stock)
	GVP Impact Series II with 52 meg Hard Drive
	1 Meg Chip RAM
	4 Megs Fast RAM
	1084 Monitor
	USR 14,400 Sportster
	KickStart 2.04/Workbench 2.1

	Although my system lacks the speed I wish it had, it is usable.
Screen redraws can be a little slow when the CPU is being hogged by the
modem.  I have been using SLIP on this system for just over a year now.
With no problems (exept a poorly written program or two)
@endnode
@node Setup

	Now the real fun begins!  Since the only SLIP protocol stack I have
experience with is AmiTCP, I will discuss the setup procedure of that
program.  Others may be similar.  The below setup for AmiTCP is a minimum
to just get AmiTCP working.  You may change settings as you become more
advanced.

	First you need to obtain several bits of information from your
Internet provider.  Get the following info from them;

	1. Destination IP Address (The IP Address your computer will
	   			   connect to when you start your SLIP 
				   access.)
	
	2. Default Gateway (Often the same as the Destination IP address)
	
	3. Netmask Address
	
	4. Name Servers (Where your computer goes to look up addresses)
	
	5. Domain Name (Usually the stuff after your name in your e-mail
		        address.  My address is jason.d.neus@uwrf.edu, so 
		        my domain name is UWRF.EDU)
	
	6. Is the account Dynamic?  (By that I mean, does the IP address of
                                     your call in account change depending 
				     on which line you call in on.  If yes,
				     then your account is dynamic)

	7. Does the provider have compression on the SLIP interface?

	8. What is the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) size?

	Next, go ahead and uncompress AmiTCP to the hard drive partition
you want it on.  This will make installation a little faster, as copies
will not have to be made.  Once this is done you may want to read the file
'HowToInstall', although this file may just confuse a first timer.  
	After this, go ahead and select 'Install AmiTCP-4.0' from the
AmiTCP-4.0 directory.  I will go through what you will be asked to answer
one at a time.

	1. Select Directory - Select the directory where you want AmiTCP to
			      be installed (easy enough).

	2. Update Sana-II Device Drivers - These are the drivers necessary
					   to use the SLIP interface.  
					   Select 'YES'. They will be 
					   copied to your DEVS: drawer.

	3. Install Napsa fonts - If you plan on telnetting into a shell
				 account, it is probably a good idea to 
				 install these fonts (although not
				 necessary).  You can then use the 
				 NapsaTerm to telnet into shell accounts.

	4. Default User Name - Just enter in any user name you would like
			       to give yourself, it can be anything.

	5. Login Name - To make this easier, just enter in the same name
	   		you used for the User Name.

	6. UID (User ID) - This is just the ID number you want to assign to
	 		   this user, go ahead and select the default of 
			   100.

	7. Group ID - This is a number to assign to a group of users.
		      Again, just select the default of 100.

	8. Real Name - Go ahead and enter your real name.  This is used for
		       an ENV: setting for some programs.

	9. Home Directory - Select AmiTCP:/bin as your home directory to
			    help save problems.

	10. Command Interpreter - Go ahead and select the default 
				  'shell'.

	11. Enter Password - Enter the password you wish to use to login 
			     to AmiTCP.

	12. Dynamic Connection - If your connection is Dynamic, select
				 'YES'.

	13. Domain Name - As discussed above, enter your domain name.

	14. Interface Type - If you are a beginner (I'm sure you are,
			     otherwise you wouldn't be reading this file) 
			     Select the 'SLIP/CSLIP' option. (CSLIP is 
			     the SLIP interface with compression). You can
			     play with PPP and stuff later.

	15. Default IP Address - If your connection is not dynamic, enter
				 you account IP Address here.  If your 
				 connection is dynamic, enter one of the 
				 available IP addresses here.  That way 
				 AmiTCP has something to fall back on if
				 neccessary.

	16. Destination IP Address - Enter this from the info from your
				     provider.

	17. Netmask - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	18. Select Device - Go ahead and select 'serial.device' or an
                            equivalent.

	19. Select Unit Number - Unless you have a multi-serial port card,
				 select '0' for the device number.

	20. Select Baud Rate - Type in the highest baud rate your modem
			       will support.  For my 14,400 I have 19200 
			       typed in for this option.

	21. MTU Size - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	22. Select Handshaking Type - CTS/RTS is the best choice.

	23. Default Gateway - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	24. Name Servers - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	25. Domain Names To Search - Just enter you domain name here.

	26. Make changes to User-Startup - Select 'YES'.

	27. Start INETD at start-up - Select 'YES'.  INET is needed by 
				      some programs, so just have it 
				      started at startup.

	THATS IT!  You should now have a functional SLIP interface.  ARexx
is required to be running, so make sure that RexxMast is in your
startup-sequence or WBStratup drawer.  It will also be necessary to mount
PIPE: if it is not already.  Reboot your computer to allow the changes to 
take effect.  

	Later on, you can reconfigure options by double clicking on the
AmiTCP Install icon.
@endnode
@node Starting

	Call up your SLIP provider with a terminal program.  Once 
connected you will now need to quit your terminal program.  It may be 
necessary to activate DTR override on your modem to prevent it from 
hanging up when you quit your terminal program.  You can do this either 
with the command 'at@d0' or use a dip switch (ala USRobotics).  

	You will now need to start a new shell.  If your account is not
dynamic, enter 'startnet'.  If your account is dynamic, then enter
'startnet ipaddress', i.e. 'startnet 139.225.4.85'.  

	The first thing you will see after entering your password is the
demo version waiting screen.  After the OK button is available, go ahead 
and click on it.  If this is your first time running AmiTCP, you should 
read the copyright info in the window.

	Once done loading in (this should only take around 20-30 seconds)
you are now at a shell prompt, just like when you call into a shell
account.  To test to see if it is working correctly type in the following;

	ncftp ftp.netnet.net  (or any other local ftp site)

	If everything is working right, you should see the modem SD/RD
lights flicker a couple times and you should soon see the friendly greeting
of the NETNET internet site flashing by.  If it does not work the first 
time, try it two or three times.  You may simply be getting legitimate
time-outs.  

	If its not working, uh-oh.  Go back to the installation and make
sure everything is set correctly.

	If everything looks OK, then you can do a little exploring if you
like.  To end your connection with the provider, you will need to type
'stopnet' from the shell.  This will not disconnect your modem, so that
way, you can restart your connection if you needed to do something.  For 
now, though, disconnect the line from the modem to hang it up.  To hang up
the modem with a program, get @{" SlipScripts " link useful} up and running.

@endnode
@node E-Mail

	Ok, one of the first things you'll want to do is setup and E-Mail
client on your computer, right?  OK then.  For the very first E-Mail
program I would suggest using a program called AirMail.  Once you get that
up and running you can upgrade to a program like Pine.


	@{" Before Setting Up E-Mail" link before}
	@{" Setting Up AirMail " link airmail}
	@{" Setting Up Pine " link pine}
@endnode
@node Before

	Before setting up E-Mail or Usenet you will need to set up a UUCP
hierarchy.  This is very simple.  Make the following directories somewhere
on your hard drive;

	UUCP
	UULib
	UUNews
	UUSpool

	Once you make these directories, add assigns to your 
AmiTCP4.0:bin/Startnet file for each of the new directories. 
	
	i.e. Assign UUCP: dh1:AmiTCP4.0/UUCP 

	Also, make a 'mail' directory somewhere for use by E-Mail programs.  
It is not necessary to assign the mail directory.

	Finally, you also need to get the address of your SMTP (mail) 
server, and possibly your POP3 (Pop Mail) server.
@endnode
@node AirMail

	Simply uncompress AirMail and copy it to wherever you want it to
reside.  Double click on its icon and load it up.  Once there simply go to
the 'Settings' menu and do the three 'setup' options.  Thats it.  Click on
'Check Mail' to see if you have any.  Try and send yourself a test letter to
make sure its set up right. 
@endnode
@node Pine

	The Amiga version of Pine is a port of Unix Pine.  Many people 
may already have experience with this program, and I have found it much 
easier to set up than programs like Elm, which use external programs to 
send and receive mail.
	Actually, the installation of Pine isn't very hard thanks to the
inclusion of an installation program.  When downloading Pine, you must
download 3 separate files from aminet;

	@{"Pine391a_Base.lha" link where}
	@{"PineBaseUpd.lha" link where}
	@{"Pine391a_***.lha" link where} (Depending On CPU Type)

	Uncompress all the above files and double click on the install
icon.  Follow the installation process.
	Once installed, load Pine and type in your user name and password.
Then select S (setup) from the main menu.  Once there select C (config).
You will now be asked for several settings.  The only ones you _need_ are
the SMTP server and the INBOX path (see Pine docs for options on the inbox
setting) but fill in as many as you can.  There you are.  You will have to
quit and then restart for the new settings to take effect. Try sending 
yourself some test mail to make sure it's set up right.  

	You will need @{" IXemul.library " link where} to use Pine.

	I have been having trouble with Pine crashing with my stock
A500.  After going through at least two versions of the IXemul.library, I
have come to suspect Pine as the cause of these crashes.  However, I have 
found that having a stack of 40000 helps keep crashes to a minimum.
@endnode
@node Gui-FTP

	I use a program called GUI-FTP for most of my FTP transfers.
AmiTCP comes with ncFTP, but I just prefer the point and click of GUI-FTP.
This is another easy to install program.  Simply copy the libraries to your
libs directory, the fonts to your fonts directory, and the main program to
where ever you want it to reside.  Set the environmental variable 'host'
(see the GUI-FTP.guide on this) and you're ready to go.  Simply run it and
connect to your favorite FTP host.
@endnode
@node WWW

	I have two WWW Browsers on my computer.  ALynx and AMosaic.  Both
are good programs, the only difference being that ALynx is unable to display
graphics within itself, while AMosaic can (Workbench 3.1 is required for
inline graphics).

	@{" Setting Up ALynx " link alynx}
	@{" Setting Up AMosaic " link amosaic}

NOTE: As of the time I typed this, there are at least 2 more WWW browsers
on the verge of release;
	
	AMosaic 2.0
	IBrowse

@endnode
@node ALynx

	ALynx is a port of Unix Lynx, a text only WWW browser.  ALynx is a
very good, smooth, compact program.

	Before setting up ALynx, you will need to download @{"AMosaic" link
where} and 
get the MailCap file from it.  The mailcap file contains information 
on external graphic viewers and external sound sample players.

	Uncompress the ALynx.lha file and copy ALynx and Lynx.cfg to your
AmiTCP:/bin directory.  Use your favorite text editor to edit the lynx.cfg
file to the settings you desire.  You will also need to edit the MailCap
file to your desired settings.  See the AMosaic docs for information on
editing the mailcap file.

	To explore around the web, select 'g' for go.  Then enter the
address of your favorite web page.  You can then use the cursor keys to 
follow links.  ALynx is very straightforward and easy to use.  Even an 
absolute beginner should get it down in no time.
@endnode
@node AMosaic

	AMosaic is a decent program, but plagued by some problems.  It has
a habit of crashing at times.  After I went from 2 megs of fast ram to 4
megs of fast ram, the crashes have decreased, but are still there.  You
will also need Workbench 3.1 to get inline graphics with AMosaic.  The one
advantage of AMosaic over ALynx is that it has the point and click
interface of the more popular WWW browsers.	

	To use AMosaic you will need to get @{" MUI.library " link where}.
You must first install MUI.  Use the included installation program.  It
won't work if you only copy the library to your libs.

	AMosaic comes with a good installation guide, so I will not go
indepth about it's installation.

	If you have any questions here, just @{" e-mail " link author} me.
@endnode
@node grn

To read usenet News, I use a good GUI program called GRn.  

	@{" Installing GRn " link installgrn}
	@{" Using GRn " link usegrn}
@endnode
@node installgrn
To install GRn, follow theses steps;

	1. Obtain the correct NNTP address from your provider.

	2. Go ahead and uncompress the grn-2.1a.lha file.  Copy the files
	   GRn.amitcp and GRn.info to your AmiTCP:bin directory.

	3. Rename GRn.amitcp to GRn

	4. Copy the fonts into your FONTS: directory.

	5. Make sure the text editor ED is in your 'C' directory.  GRN 
	   uses ED to allow you to edit posts for replies.

	6. You can now run GRn.  If you will be running it from shell, you
           must have a stack of about 20000.  To run it from shell, type 
	   the following;

		grn nntp nntpserver [nntp servername]

	GRn should bootup and connect to your remote server.  It should 
	boot up rather quickly since you have no news configuration file 
	yet, and therefore, no news will be retrieved.

	To run GRn from workbench, you will need to alter some tool types
	in the icon.  Select the GRn icon, and select 'Info' from the 
	'Icons' menu.
		
		a) Add the tool type 'NNTPSERVER=[nntp servername]'

		b) Change '*NNTP' to 'NNTP'

		c) All the other tool types with a '*' in front of them are
		   not neccessary for this installation.

		d) Save the new settings and start GRn.


@endnode
@node usegrn

	Using GRn is very easy.  To subscribe and retrieve news;  

	1. The first thing you need to do is select the 'Subscribe' 
	   button from the main screen.  GRn will now retrieve a news 
	   group list from your server.

	2. Once this is done, a list of all available news groups will
	   appear on your screen.  You can go through the list with the
	   slidebar on the right side of the screen.  

	3. When you see a news group you want to subscribe to, simply 
	   double click on it.  GRn will ask you if you really want to 
	   add that group to your list, select yes or no, depending on 
	   how you feel.  Some amiga news groups are;

		comp.sys.amiga.*****

	   You can go through and select as many groups as you want, but I
	   would recommend you subscribe to only 2 or 3 groups at one time.
	   This is because when GRn retrieves news for the first time, 
	   there may be many postings (up to around 1500).  This takes 
	   some time to retrieve.  So, unless you have a few hours to 
	   kill, subscribe to only a few groups at a time.

	4. Select the close gadget on the news groups screen.

	5. You will now be at the main screen again.  Select 'Save/Update
	   GRnRC' to save your news groups list.   

	6. Select 'Rescan News' to retrieve news from your news groups.  
	   This may take some time.

	7. Once this is done, you can double click on any of the news 
	   groups to read its articles.  But, unless you want to read 
	   every message retrieved, you may want to single click each 
	   group, and then select 'Catch Up' to reset the group as 
	   completely read.  Do this with each news group.  Repeat all 
	   these steps until you are satisfied with your selections.

To read news;

	1. Every time you start GRn, all new news posts will be retrieved.

	2. Double click on the news group you want to read.

	3. You will now be in the news reading screen.  The messages and
	   topics are listed at the top of the screen.  Several buttons 
	   are on the top half of the screen.  These buttons are very 
	   self descriptive.  The next part is the information from the 
	   message header.  The next part of the screen is the message 
	   box.  You can scroll through the topics at the top of the 
	   screen, and single click on the message to view it at the 
	   bottom of the screen.  The buttons at the bottom of the 
	   screen are also mostly self descriptive.  Use 'Save' to save 
	   that message to one of your drives.  Use 'Followup' to reply 
	   on Usenet to a post.  'Reply' will attempt to send mail to 
	   that message's author. 

	4. Unless you read every single message, select 'Catch Up' when
	   you are done reading that group.  That will reset the 
	   newsgroup you are currently on.  That way, it will only 
	   retrieve new posts next time. 

	5. Go on and finish reading all your groups.
@endnode
@node irc
 
	For IRC access, I use a good program called GrapeVine.  This 
program has an easy to use GUI.

@node gvsetup

To install Grapevine follow these steps;

	1. Go ahead and uncompress the grapevine.lha file.  Copy the
files GV and GV.info to your AmiTCP:bin directory.  

	2. Uncompress the 'socket_lib12.lha' file.  Copy 'LoadLib' to your
AmiTCP:bin directory.  Copy Socket.library to your LIBS: directory.

	3. Uncompress the 'DCC-Send-1.12.lha' file.  Make a directory
called 'DCC' in your AmiTCP:bin directory.  Copy all the DCC.#? files to
your AmiTCP:bin/DCC directory.

	4. Add the following lines to your Startnet file;

 		LoadLib dh0:libs/socket.library
		SetENV SOCKETCONFIG "UID=100 GID=100 USER=[username] DOMAIN=[domain name] UMASK=002"

	5. Start or re-start your SLIP connection to allow the changes in
your startnet file to take effect.  Start Grapevine using either the icon 
or by typing GV from the shell.  You will need to give Grapevine a stack of
at least 20000 if you are starting it from the shell.

	6.  Once started, you will connect to the University of Colorado
IRC server (I believe that is the default server).  
	
	7.  The default server is usually very busy.  So, locate your 
closest public IRC provider by typing '/links' (NOTE: ALL IRC commands are 
preceded by the forward slash)  You will get a list of servers which
scrolls by quickly.  If the list is too long, you can use the slidebar on 
the right to scroll back through the output.

	8.  Once you locate the nearest server, go to the 'Settings' menu.
Select the 'Network' option.  Enter that servers address into the 
'Default Server' option.  You can usually enter 6665, 6666, or 6667 as the
'Server Port' number. 
 
	9. You can go through the 'Settings' menu and set the rest of the
options as you wish.

	10.  You can get a list of available channels by typing '/list',
but I'm warning you, this list will be very long.  To join a channel, type
'/join [channel name]'.  Or if you want to talk about our favorite 
computer, just type '/join #amiga'.

	11.  You can get a complete list of commands from the
'Grapevine.guide' file, if you can get it to work.  I had to view it as a
normal text file.

@node trade
	Trading files with other users on IRC is very easy.  For this task 
you use the DCC programs which you should have installed somewhere on your 
hard drive.  When Grapevine is running, you will need to set the path to
your DCC files under the 'Settings/Paths' menu.  Once this is done, you can
exchange files with anyone currently on IRC, no matter what channel they
are on.

	To Send Files;

		From the command prompt type '/dcc send [nickname] path'

	So, lets say I want to send John the file dh2:ud's/stuff.lha.  I
would type '/dcc send John dh2:ud's/stuff.lha'.  If you don't provide a
path, a file requester will come up for you to select a file.


	To Receive Files;

		With Grapevine, reception of files is automatic.  A small
requester will pop up and ask if you want to accept a DCC from [nickname].
If you click OK, the file will be downloaded to your computer.  You may
want to set the 'Default Work Dir' from the 'Settings/Paths' menu, if you
have not already done so.  This will ensure the file goes where you want
it.

@node mama
	On the #amiga channel, there is a program which is sometimes
online, this is referred to as a BOT.  The BOT on #amiga is called MAMA.
MAMA is handy for many things.  You can use MAMA to look up files on
Aminet, to upload files to Aminet, and to get files from Aminet.  Whenever
you want to use MAMA, you need to message her, i.e. '/msg mama [command]'.
To see what MAMA has to offer, simply type '/msg mama help'.  If mama is 
online, she will send you a small list of options.  If mama isn't currently
online, you will get back a message like "«ERROR» no such nick/channel 
mama".

	Say I wanted to look up a file on Aminet with the word 'SLIP' in
the title or description.  I would type '/msg mama find SLIP'.  Hopefully,
mama would come back with several files that fit that keyword search.

	You can find out more about mama at;

@node useful

	Here I will discuss other programs which are not necessary, but 
should come in useful while using AmiTCP and related programs. 

	SLIP Scripts - This archive contains several ARexx scripts.  They
can be configured to call, stop, and hang up on your SLIP account, right 
from your shell.  Rexserdev.library (RXSerial.lha) is required for these 
scripts.

	8n1 - This is a serial.device replacement.  It eliminates some of
the system overhead inherent in the Commodore Serial.Device.
