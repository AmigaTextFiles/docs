@NODE CHOOSE "Choosing a hard disk"

 @{u}Choosing a hard disk@{uu}

 The  type and size of hard disk are the main requirements when selecting a
 hard disk for your Amiga.

 @{u}Types of interface@{uu}

 IDE  -  Intelligent Device Electronics. A simple interface designed mainly
 to  add hard disks (upto 2) to a computer. Modern interfaces, using Atapi,
 can  make  it  possible  to  add upto 4 devices including CDROMS. IDE also
 refers to ATA and EIDE which are also compatible.

 SCSI  - Small Computer System Interface. A faster and more powerful system
 then IDE which allows upto 7 devices added to the computer through a daisy
 chain. 

 USB - Universal Serial Bus. If you have a PCI USB card you can add external
 hard disks to this interface

 Other sub-types:

 UDMA - Ultra Direct Memory Access. Speeds up transfers to 33MB/sec. Amiga
      does not directly support this but such drives 'should' work  on
      older interfaces but work at slower speeds.

 ATA 2/ATA 2 FAST - Fast IDE interfaces normally appear on newer computers such
      as PCs. Now supported by the IDE replacement, the 'Power Flyer' from
      Power Computing.

 You  may come across other types but they are incompatible with the Amiga.
 eg. MFM, ESDI, FireWire.

 @{u}Size of hard disks@{uu}

 The  physical  size  of  a hard disk can vary from 1½" to 5¼" in size. The
 most  usual  sizes  are  2½"  and  3½"  sizes. The height of the hard disk
 depends  on  the  number of platters (surfaces) the disk has: full height,
 half height, slim etc.

 @{u}Capacity of hard disks@{uu}

 The  capacity of hard disks has doubled approx. every two years and it is
 now  possible to  get 70Gb hard disks! It is very difficult these days to
 find  small capacity hard disks. 

 If you own upto Workbench 3.1 without FFS updates, then you can use upto 
 4Gb (spit into 2x 2Gb partitions) Hard Disks.

 If you own Workbench 3.5, and/or PFS2 or 3 or SFS then you can use much
 larger Hard drives of 4Gb or more.
 
 Please note that the size can be either quoted as formatted or unformatted
 and may be rounded to nearest 100Mb.
 
 @{u}Interfaces available in Amigas@{uu}

       A500 - None
       A600 - IDE (2.5")
      A1200 - IDE (2.5")
      A1000 - None
      A2000 - None
      A1500 - None
      A3000 - SCSI (3.5")
     A3000T - SCSI (3.5")
      A4000 - IDE (3.5")
     A4000T - SCSI (3.5")
       CD32 - None
       
 The above are the recommended types and sizes to use in your Amiga.

 @{u}IDE/SCSI Controllers@{uu}

 If  you  have  a Zorro based Amiga, it is possible to purchase IDE or SCSI
 adaptors  and  add  a hard disk that way. Some accelerators cards now have
 built in SCSI interfaces:

     Commodore A2091 SCSI For A1500,A2000
     Oktagon 2008S SCSI for Zorro Amigas
     Warp Engine accelerator with SCSI-2
     Squirrel SCSI For A600 and A1200
     Blizzard accelerators have a SCSI option
     Appollo accelerators have a SCSI option
     CyberStorm accelerators have a SCSI option (SCSI-2/3)
     Viper 520CD has a IDE interface for A500
     A570 Hard disk for A500
     GVP HC-8 SCSI

     Buddha IDE Controller for any Amigas
     Alfa Quattro IDE interface for A4000

 For A500 owners, the hard disk is usually supplied with an interface to be
 attached to the expansion port on the left side (on the A1000 it is on the
 right side).

 The  A600  and  A1200  has a PCMCIA port and hard disks can be added via a
 SCSI  interface  such  as the Squirrel or Dataflyer or a special Overdrive
 hard disk. Accelerator cards also have the option to add SCSI interfaces.

 @{u}Attaching more than one hard disk@{uu}

 If you want to add a second hard disk then you must note the following:

 For IDE systems the hard disks must be able to switch to master/slave mode
 through a jumper on the back of the hard disk. If the disk does not have
 such a jumper then you cannot attach a second disk. 2.5 Drives do not 
 normally have master/slave jumpers but most 3.5 drives do.
  For SCSI systems, all you need to do is set the SCSI ID number to an
 unused value (0-6) and add it to the scsi chain and check termination.

@ENDNODE
@NODE INSTALL "Installing a hard disk"

 This  entirely  depends  on  where  the hard disk is going to be put. Most
 external  HDs  are very easily attached and require just common sense (See
 instructions  supplied  with  HD for details). Internal HDs are a bit more
 complex:

 @{u}A600/A1200 (Internal)@{uu}

 Unscrew  the two halfs of the Amiga. Remove the top half. The keyboard may
 need  dettaching  via  the  ribbon  mear the back on the Amiga. Insert the
 short IDE ribbon cable in the interface located in the small cradle in the
 metal  shield  on  the  left  side  of  the  Amiga.  Make  sure  the cable
 orientation  is  correct as it also supplies power to the HD! Attached the
 IDE  Hard  disk to the other end of the cable and place it on the supplied
 hole in the sheilding. Now reassemble the Amiga.

 For 3.5" Hard Disks, you need to get power from another source, such as the
 floppy drive, you can get a power splitter from any good electronics supplier
 and a 3.5" to 2.5" IDE cable as well.

 @{u}A4000 (Internal)@{uu}

 Unscrew the lid of the Amiga. The hard drive will need a cradle and an IDE
 ribbon  cable (if not already supplied). Unscrew the cradle from the Amiga
 and screw the HD into the cradle.

 The  cable  should  be  attached  to the multi-pin connector on the mother
 board and the cable to the back of the hard disk. Check that Pin 1 matches
 the  1 on the HD. The A4000 comes with extra power cables (four wires with
 a white coloured plug at the end) from the PSU, attach this to the back of
 the HD. Screw the cradle into the Amiga case at the back of the Amiga next
 to the PSU. Reassemble the Amiga.

 If  you  are  adding  a  second IDE HD then set the Master/Slave switch to
 Slave  for the 2nd hard disk (these usually appear on 3.5" disks, not 2.5"
 disks).

 You  will  need  a  2-way split IDE cable for both HDs as you cannot chain
 them like SCSI disks.

 For  SCSI, ensure that the new HD has its own unique SCSI id and insert it
 into  the  SCSI chain, also change the termination if necessary or you may
 find that some SCSI items may not be recognised.

 Usually,  instructions  are  supplied by the retailer or if you are unsure
 how  to  install  a hard disk or if your Amiga is still under warranty get
 the dealer to fit it for you!

@NODE PARTN "Partitioning a hard disk"

 Partitioning a hard disk

 The  standard  partitioning software is called HDToolbox and it is usually
 supplied  on  the  Install  disk  with  Workbench.  Sometimes  third party
 software is supplied such as HDInst, GVPPrep, RDPrep and so on.

 Boot from the 3.1 Install disk and use the program in @{b}HDSetup@{ub} to create 
 a standard two partition  set up on your hard disk.

 For Workbench 2, use the PrepHD or InstallHD programs on the 2.0Install disk.

 Otherwise, you can do it manually with HDToolbox:
 
 1. Locate and run HDToolbox. See HDTools 

 2. The program will search through available SCSI slots and then display a
 menu  screen.  (NB:  IDE  drives on A1200/A600 are listed as SCSI, even if
 they are not, this is normal).
 
 If a HD is not found, exit HDToolbox and select the icon for HDToolbox and 
 select Information (or Info) and change the tooltype SCSI_DEVICE_NAME=scsi.device 
 to the  correct @{"device name" link DEVICES}. Re-run HDToolbox.

 3. At the top of the screen a list of drives is shown at the top. If it is
 not  recognised  then 'Unknown' would be listed. If it is unknown, then do
 the following steps:

 a) Click on the item and select 'Change Drive Type'.

 b) Click on 'Define New...'

 c) Click on 'Read Configuration' to read the drive's settings.

 d) Click on OK until the main menu appears.

 4. Now select 'Partition Drive'.

 a) A new screen with a graphical representation of the partition(s) on the
 hard  disk  appears.  Sometimes  a hard disk may be set up with one or two
 partitions.

 b) You  can  resize  partitions using the  blue triangle to the appropiate
    size.

 c) You can delete unwanted partitions by  selecting the partition with the
    mouse and select 'Delete Partition'.

 d) If  there  is  space,  then selecting 'New Partition' will create a new
    partition for you by clicking in the free space.  Use DHx for partition
    names where x is 0,1,2 etc..

 e) To  make  a partition bootable,  click on the appropiate partition e.g.
    DH0  and click on Advanced Options and tick the 'Bootable' option. Make
    sure no other partitions have this ticked.

 f) Click on Change and more options will appear,  click in the MaxTransfer
    box and change the default value (0xfffff) to a low value eg 0x1fe00.
    This will  prevent corruption  when  copying large files onto the  hard
    disk. Click on OK.

 g) If you have made a mistake,  you can always, click on 'Cancel' and exit
    HDToolbox.

 h) Once changes have been made to your satisfaction,  click on OK and then
    on the main screen select Save Changes to Drive.

 i) Exit  HDToolbox  and  reboot your Amiga.  This will force the system to
    read the new settings on bootup.

 5. Boot off a copy of the Workbench disk or the Install disk (preferred).

 6. You  can  now format the new  partitions using the Format option on the
    Workbench Icon menu. If the disk icons fail to appear you will need
    a new version of FFS.

@ENDNODE
@NODE FILESYS "Changing or Upgrading the File System"

 Most  people  use  the filing system provided on the ROM (ie resident File
 system,  also  known  as  DOS1).  For most users the FastFileSystem is the
 default.

 It is possible to choose an alternative file system for your hard disk. If
 changing to a different file system than you must backup first, or you may
 loose  all  your  data. 

   Other filing systems include AFS (Advanced File System), PFS (Professional
 File System) and SFS (Smart File System).

 To upgade to a new file system, complete the Following steps:

  1. Copy the new file system to the L: directory.
  2. Start up HDToolbox and enter Partition Drive screen.
  3. Select the partition you wish to update.
  4. Click on Advanced Options and then on 'Add/Update...' button.
  5. Click on 'Add New File System ...' and a dialog box will appear.
     (you can use Update if updating an existing file system).
  6. Enter path and name of the new file system e.g. 'L:FastFileSystem'.
  7. It will display the DosType (in hex) & the version, revision numbers.
  8. Click on OK until the main menu appears.
  9. To commit the changes click on 'Save Changes to Drive'.
 10. Exit and reboot to use the new file system. If necessary, format the
     new partition ready to be used.

@ENDNODE
@NODE WORKBCH "Installing Workbench on your Hard disk"

 1.  Make sure you have a formatted partition on your hard disk (See 
     {"Partitioning" link PARTN} for preparing your HD).
     If  you  have  an  Install  disk then run the language version of the
     installation script in the @{b}Install@{b} drawer e.g. English for English
     speaking users.

 2.  If you have Workbench floppy disks and do not have the install disk then 
     follow these instructions:

  a)  Boot off a Workbench disk and double click on the Shell icon to open a
      Shell window.

  b)  Insert the Workbench disk and type:

      COPY WORKBENCH3.0:#? DH0: All Clone Quiet

  NB:  If  you have a different version of Workbench, change the name of the
  disk  used  to  the one inserted (type INFO to see whats mounted). DH0: is
  the bootable partition.

  c) Insert the Extras disk and type:

     COPY EXTRAS3.0:#? DH0: All Clone Quiet

  d) Insert the Fonts disk and type:

     MAKEDIR DH0:Fonts
     COPY Fonts:#? DH0:Fonts All Clone Quiet

  e) Insert the Locale disk and type:

     MAKEDIR DH0:Locale
     COPY Locale:#? DH0:Locale All Clone Quiet

  f) The Storage disk contains extra drivers and may be installed later. Not
     all the files are required but copy the files via Workbench if they are
     needed.

 3. If you have Workbench on CD, then boot off your current Workbench disk
    and insert the CD (make sure CD ROM drivers are loaded).
    
  a) Open the OS-Version3.9 folder on the AmigaOS3.9 CD icon
 
  b) Run the OS3.9Installation icon
 
  c) Select 'Create an Emergency disk' option and get a floppy disk ready to
     make a bootable emergency disk. For some SCSI controllers, some extra
     programs may need to be copied.
    
  d) Then select an Update Installation if you already have AmigaOS3.5 or
     a Full Installation if you have an older AmigaOS or no AmigaOS 
     installed.

  e) The other options can be installed afterwards you you so wish.
 
 4. Remove  any  disks  and reboot the Amiga.  It should now boot using the
    files stored on the Hard Disk.

 5. Run each of the Preferences programs to configure the keyboard,  mouse,
    screen and  printer as  you  see fit.  Some files may need to copied to
    DEVS drawer first for Printer,  Keyboard  and  Monitor drivers from the
    Storage disk.

@ENDNODE
@NODE SOFTWARE "Installing software on your Hard disk"

 1. Most application software can be installed in three ways:

 a) Using  an Installer script.  If no Installer program is found, copy the
    program from the Install  disk  to the C directory. If possible use the
    latest version. Its on AmigaOS CD or from Aminet.

 b) Using an AmigaDOS shell script.

 c) Copying  the  Drawers  or  files  via  Workbench (or a File Manager) by
    dragging the files from one disk to another location on your Hard Disk.

 2. Using  method (c) is  sometimes hit  and miss and some programs require
    extra libraries and drivers to be installed seperately.

 a) All files ending with .library should be copied to the LIBS drawer.

    NB:  It is now common for some programs to have their own libs drawer
         e.g. MUI. Also, never replace a library with an older version.

 b) All files ending with .device should be copied to the DEVS drawer.
    Printers, keyboard maps, monitors, Datatypes are also stored in
    Devs and in Classes as well.

 c) All  files ending with .font with  their drawer should be copied to the
    FONTS drawer. Compugraphic fonts are installed here, run
    @{i}Intellifont@{ui} to install the new font. Run @{i}FixFonts@{ui}
    if adding or removing bitmap fonts.

 d) Handlers are stored in the L: directory.

 e) Scripts, config files and so on can be stored in S: (or ENV:)

 f) Check the program's manual to see what should be installed where.

 g) If the program asks for you to insert a volume you should note down the
    name of the  volume  and  then  add an ASSIGN to make a fake volume (or
    logical volume) which  points to the directory on your HD. These can be
    added to your s:user-startup or Assign Manager program if you use one.

        e.g. The game Xtreme Racing requires an volume called XTR

                       ASSIGN XTR: Dh1:Games/XTR

 3. Check  the  program runs by double-clicking on the icon,  it should run
    okay  or give a requester  asking  for  a particular library, device or
    whatever.

 4. If  the program has its own preferences menu or prefs program, run that
    so that it's set up correctly. Check the manual to see what preferences
    to set to.

 5. If  you  are  unable  to run a program,  check its requirements. It may
    require a particular version of  WBench,  a particular processor (maybe
    an FPU or MMU unit), amount of memory or disk space. Check requirements
    in the program's manual.

 6. If you are still unable to run a program,  find a copy of SnoopDos, run
    it and then try running the program. The log from Snoopdos can tell you
    which files it fails to open and what versions are required.

    NB: Some open failures are ok to ignore but to decide whether it's
        important or not is dependant on your experience.

 7. Not  all  software  is installable on hard disks.  Disks that appear as
    DF0:NDOS or DF0:????  cannot be  installed unless there is an installer
    program.  A lot of old games can be installed using patches to copy the
    disk to the hard disk and run it. Check aminet in game/patch.

@ENDNODE
@NODE LOOK "Looking after your hard disk"

 It  is  important  that  you  look  after the hard disk so that it is well
 organised  and  does  not  fill  up  too quickly. I read somewhere, that a
 certain  person  was  having problems with his computer and could not save
 data until somebody pointed out that his hard disk was full!

 The following tips should be noted:

 1. Allows  backup  your  hard disk.  The cheapest method is to backup your
    hard  disk  onto  floppy  disk. It would be wise to invest in some good
    backup software and external backup device e.g. Tape drives, Zip drives
    etc.

    You  do  not  always  have to do a full backup but an incremental every
    day, week or 2 weeks is advisable. It depends on how important the data
    is up to you.

 2. Optimise the hard disk using a defragmentation utility.  This speeds up
    the use of the hard disk as files can become fragmented over time. This
    only requires doing at the most once a month.

 3. Delete  programs that you are no longer using . Archive data onto other
    media  if  it  no longer being used, you can always copy it back if you
    want it.

 4. Get some disk repair tools such as DiskSalv or Quarterback Tools.
    This  will  enable  you  to  repair any errors that may appear when the
    Filing  System  is damaged by errant programs. They will also allow you
    to Undelete files you accidently removed.

 5. To  save disk space,  it is advisable to install some sort or real-time
    dearchiving utilities such as PowerPacker, or XPK utilities which allow
    you  to compress files to save space and then unarchive them on-the-fly
    when you want to read/view them.

 6. Make a note on paper the type,  size and details of the partitions (see
    Advanced options). If the hard disk is accidently erased then it may be
    possible to setup the hard disk as normal.

    The RDB-Salv utility could be a life saver!

@NODE PROBS "Problems that may occur"

 As  with  any  hardware  or software, there may be problems that may occur
 when setting up or using a hard disk.

 1. Programs won't load or run and data is corrupted.

 This  is  mostly likely due to the MaxTransfer settings being too high for
 the  Amiga  to  cope when copying files onto the hard disk. Load HDToolbox
 and  goto  Partition  Drive, click on Advanced and then on Change. Set the
 MaxTransfer value from 0xfffff to 0x1fe00 and OK and Save Changes.

 Reboot  and  the  new  settings  will  be used. You will need to reinstall
 programs that don't load.

 2. The Amiga reboots and the disk light is constantly on.

 Best  thing to do is boot with both mouse buttons held down and wait until
 the  hard  drive light goes out. When the hard disk filing system (FFS) is
 damaged  the  AmigaOS  automatically  runs  a  Validation  routine  on the
 partition  affected. Do NOT reboot if this happens, wait until it finishes
 before  running  anything.  Use  a  utility  called  WaitValidate  in your
 startup-sequence  to  cause  the  bootup  to  pause while validation is in
 progress.

 3. Read/write errors are occuring on the hard disk.

 This  is  more  serious as this a hardware fault on the hard disk surface.
 These are known as Bad Blocks and can be mapped out from the Filing System
 by  Using  the Verify Data option in HDToolbox or use Quarterback Tools in
 Repair mode to check the hard disk surface for these Bad Blocks.

 If  you know where the errors occur on the hard disk you can also manually
 map  them  out  using  the  'Modify  Bad  Block List' screen and enter the
 Cylinder, Head, Bytes from Index and Sector.

 4. Checksum errors, corrupted or undeletable files or directories.

 These occur when the filing system is corrupted and the validation routine
 has  not fixed them. You need to run a Repair of the filing System using a
 program  such  as  DiskSalv  or Quarterback Tools. As shareware version of
 DiskSalv 2 is available on Aminet (disk/salv) or other PD sources. These
 tools will only work on partitions below the 4GB limit, it is not possible
 to repair larger partitions with FFS with these tools.

 If  errors  like  these  re-occur then only a reformat (high or low level)
 should cure it.

 5. HDToolbox does not recognise my Hard disk.

   First, check that the hard disk isn`t a slow spin up drive. Do a warm
 restart (Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga) and see if the HD is then recognised. If the HD
 is still not recognised, try cutting Line 1 of the IDE cable.

   If this occurs, the hard disk is either incompatible or has become 
 irretreivably damaged. I hope you have a backup of it! If important data
 is on this hard disk then some companies can retrieve it for you - for a
 price! Try rebuilding the hard disk from scratch.

   If you own an A600, some models have an older version of ROM whose scsi.device
 does not recognise IDE drives. You will need to install a newer version of the
 ROM to use IDE hard drives. The Kickstart chip version must end with a 5 or 0
 for hard disks to be used.

   Make sure that the drive you do install is IDE and not SCSI, you can sometimes
 tell by either the label on the disk. SCSI drives tend to use 50 pin interfaces
 while IDE uses 40/44 pin interfaces.

   HDToolbox defaults to scsi.device, other hard disk controllers will use their
 own device drivers e.g. 2nd.scsi.device, squirrelscsi.device etc. They will be
 either in Devs: or in ROM. Check manual or check memory via Snoopdos or other
 utility. Change the Tooltype SCSI_DEVICE_NAME=scsi.device to the correct 
 @{"device name" link DEVICES}.

   If using AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 add the ASKDEVICE=TRUE tooltype to scan for hard disks
 on third party hard disk controllers.

 6. The partitions have disappeared!

 Unless  you  have a copy of the hard disk and partition information, it is
 next  to  impossible  to retrieve information again. Viruses also may be a
 cause of losing RDB information! It is possible to recreate the partitions
 if the RDB is saved either on paper or on disk from RDB-Salv program.

 Use "Advanced Options" in HDToolbox to manually enter the partition data.

   Partitions can also disappear if you are using an old Filing System on a 
 Hard disk bigger than 4Gb as the current limit is 4Gb for FFS v40. You need
 to upgrade to FF v45, PFS3 or other filing system with updated device driver.

 7. Hard disk does not boot from cold or even a warm boot.

 This  sometimes occur on particular models of hard disks. If the hard disk
 does not boot from cold, press Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga again to boot up. The hard
 disk sometimes takes too long to spin up before the exec tries to read the
 hard  disk's  RDB.  If the hard disk does not boot from cold or warm boots
 then  check  the Bootable option for DH0 in HDToolbox, cut line one of the
 cable to fix it or update Kickstart to 3.1 which has a built in feature to
 wait longer for slower hard disks.

 8. I  cannot  partition  my  hard  disk properly (-ve sizes,  unaccessable
    partitions)

 The  Fast  File System (v40) currently has a 2Gb limitation on the size of
 the  partition  you can have on the Amiga. Also, you cannot use hard disks
 larger  than  4.2Gb as it cannot address the larger values, in such a case
 use many smaller disks (SCSI is best here) instead.

 Older  FFS  may have lower size limitations, these occur if you try to add
 partitions  above the limit and don't appear on the Workbench or cannot be
 formatted. To solve this get a new version of FFS or upgrade Kickstart and
 Workbench.

   If using the standard FFS in ROM do not use any disk space above the 4Gb
 limit as data can wrap around to the start of the disk and overwrite the RDB
 thus losing all your partition info!

 9. How can I use large hard disks?

 If  you  intend  to use large hard disks/partitions, then you can download
 the latest updates from Aminet:

     dev/misc   trackdisk64   - Trackdisk with 64 bit extensions
     disk/misc  FFSTD64       - FFS with Track disk 64 bit extensions
     disk/misc  Format64      - Format disks >4GB
     
The following files are also available from Aminet:

     dev/misc   trackdisk64   - Trackdisk with 64 bit extensions
     disk/misc  FFSTD64       - FFS with Track disk 64 bit extensions
     disk/misc  Format64      - Format disks &gt;4GB
     
  AmigaOS 3.5/3.9 has updated FastFileSystem and patches the scsi.device to allow
 bigger hard disks. Please note that the scsi.device needs the ROM update
 to work with the ide_scsi.device patches to allow 8Gb or more hard disks.
 The NSD patch to v40 scsi.device will only allow upto 8Gb Hard Disks.
  
  You can also purchase third party filing system such as PFS3 and SFS which 
 supports large hard disks.

 10. Can I use long filenames in Workbench?
 
 AmigaOS dos.library supports filenames upto 102 (incl. .info extension) characters long.
 The FFS (incl. AmigaOS 3.5/9) can only support upto 30 characters (incl .info).
 To use longer filenames, you need to install a third party file system such as SFS
 (95 characters) or PFS3 (102 characters).

@NODE LARGE "Using Large Hard Disks"

  From Workbench 1.3, the FastFileSystem was introduced to store files on hard
disks. The first Hard Disk for the Amiga was the A590 with a 20MB hard disk.
Later as the technology improved, disk sized doubled every year, and now in 2001,
hard disks are on average 10GB or more in size.

  AmigaOS is a 32 bit system, which means that it can store large numbers from
0 to 2^32 (or approx. 4,000,000,000) so it can safely address hard disks upto
4GB but over that, it will not work. This applies to all Amigas will AmigaOS from
1.3 to 3.1

  Due to the large size of disks, these days, AmigaOS 3.5 introduced New Style
Device (NSD) and 64 bit file systems to address larger hard disks. Also, new
versions of the partitioning software HDToolbox, a new Format program and 
patches to the OS have been introduced.

 Note, if using another partitioning program eg SCSIConfig, then stick to using 
that instead of HDToolbox as they use different methods to read hard disk setup 
and you may lose partitions and data!

  Amiga Inc. developed the NSDPatch which allow WB 3.1 users to use large hard disks
this has been incorporated into the @{i}SetPatch@{ui} command which must be run
when Workbench loads. Definitions for each hard disk controller are included in
the NSDPatch.cfg file to use the new NSD features.

  For Amiga OS to boot the boot partition must be within the first 4GB or if using
a direct SCSI file system (PFS3 for instance), within the first 8GB.

  When using the internal IDE  device on the Amiga A600/A1200/A4000 there is a
built in limitation of 8GB. For larger hard disks above the 8GB limit then you
must install the full @{i}ROM Updates@{ui} via Setpatch or use IDE-Fix to use it
otherwise you cannot address the whole disk.

  Further information about Disk and File operations are on the AmigaOS 3.9 CD
in @{i}Manuals/FAQ@{i} directory and at @{i}http://www.gregdonner.org/os39faq/os39faq.html
