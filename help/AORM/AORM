    - Introduction -

        Many of you may be wondering what the Amiga ORM is and why it has
    been created. A FAQ is a list of Frequently Asked Questions, compiled
    and provided on a regular basis to people interested in the subject of
    the FAQ. In this case, we are attempting to provide as much thorough
    information as possible for both beginners and expert Amiga users as
    well as for non-Amiga users. In fact many Amiga users request this file
    in order to provide it to students, teachers, local dealers, or friends
    in an attempt to promote the Amiga.

        This file is provided as is, and any typos or factual mistakes are
    in no way intended or purposeful. We do not gaurantee the full accuracy
    of every item in this document as many items have been known to exist
    in numerous circumstances which may cause incompatibilities. We have
    however checked through the file and verified as much data as possible.
    All of the information is considered common knowledge.

@node faq.Workbench.6.01 "Workbench Questions 0.170"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.01 What happens if an icon is dragged out of its window?

            If an icon is dragged to the Workbench, it is temporarily
        placed on the Workbench backdrop. It will remain here until
        you reboot or reload the Workbench. If you would like for the
        file to remain on the Workbench, use the Snapshot command
        from the icon menu.
            If the icon is dragged to another window, and the window is
        another directory, the file will be moved to that directory
        if the directory is on the same partition. If the directory
        is on a different partition, the file will be duplicated to
        the new directory.
            If the icon is dragged into a window belonging to an
        application, the application may act upon that icon or file.
        For example, dragging an icon onto the IconEditor allows the
        icon to be edited.

@node faq.Workbench.6.02 "Workbench Questions 0.170"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.02 What are Tool Types?

            Tool Types allow you to pass parameters to a program when
        it is launched from the Workbench. This can be done by
        selecting the icon and selecting the Info option from the
        Workbench menu.

@endnode
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


@node faq.Workbench.6.03 "Workbench Questions 0.170"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.03 How do I unselect an icon or group of icons?

            If you have selected one icon, clicking anywhere on the
        screen will deselect that icon. If you have selected many
        icons, clicking anywere on the screen will deselect all the
        icons. Clicking on one icon of many selected icons will
        cause only that icon to be selected.
            If have selected numerous icons, you may deselect any
        single icon by following this procedure:

            1. Find the icon from the group you wish to deselect.

            2. Hold down the left mouse button over that icon, being
            careful not to double click.

            3. Click the right mouse button to deselect that icon.

            To select a group of icons, you may either hold down a
        SHIFT key and single click each icon, or you may click on the
        Workbench screen and draw a rubber banding box around the icons
        you want.

@node faq.Workbench.6.04 "Workbench Questions 0.260"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.04 Why does my icon no longer work after altering its image?

            When altering the icon, it is possible that you
        destroyed or changed the type of icon you were making.
        You may change the icon type using an icon editor, such
        as IconEdit.


            DISK        For disk devices such as a floppy disk,
                    a hard disk partition, RAM:, and RAD:.

            DRAWER      For directories.

            TOOL        For programs, applications, executables, and
                    AmigaDOS commands.

            PROJECT     For files that are created by applications,
                    such as pictures, animations, preferences, and
                    archives.

            GARBAGE     For the Trash Can disposable directories.

@node faq.Workbench.6.05 "Workbench Questions 0.260"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.05 How do I design my own icons?

            You may use the IconEdit program included with your
        system software. You may also use numerous public domain
        programs. Another method is to design the icon using an
        IFF compatible painting program and then import it into
        your icon editor using any IFF brush loading routines it
        may have.

@endnode
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


@node faq.Workbench.6.06 "Workbench Questions 0.260"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.06 How many colors can an icon have?

            An icon may use up to 16 colors. However, only the first
        few bitplanes will be displayed if your screenmode is set to
        less than 16 colors. AGA machines may use 16 colors, but only
        the first 8 colors are preserved exclusively for the icons.
        Loading an image on an AGA Workbench may alter the palette
        of the second set of 8 colors when using 16 color icons.

@endnode
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


@node faq.Workbench.6.07 "Workbench Questions 0.260"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.07 What is an animating icon?

            An animating icon has more than two images. With most
        icons, clicking on it will either reverse the image colors,
        draw a depressed bevel box, or draw an alternate image. An
        animating icon may have more than one image displayed in
        sequence whenever it is pressed once. Some icon editors
        support this feature, however IconEdit, which comes with
        the Workbench, does not.

@endnode
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


@node faq.Workbench.6.08 "Workbench Questions 0.263"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.08 How do I alphabetize my icons?

            Working with one window at a time, use the Select Contents
        option of the Workbench in the Windows menu or by using some
        other method. Then use the UnSnapshot option from the Icons
        menu. Last of all, use the Update option from the Windows menu
        and your files will be alphabetized. They may however, depending
        on the arrangement of the icons, form an irregular pattern on
        the screen. The CleanUp menu item will do its best to arrange
        them better, although some may no longer be alphabetized.

@endnode
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+


@node faq.Workbench.6.09 "Workbench Questions 0.266"
@toc faq.Workbench

    6.09 Why does my disk icon not change after I edit the image?

            Editing the image for a disk icon may require using the
        AmigaDOS Command @{" DiskChange " link diskchange} in order
        to properly update the icon. Rebooting should also help to
        update the image if it fails to update properly.

    - ChangeTaskPri PRI=PRIORITY/A/N PROCESS/K/N


            Any truly multitasking OS uses task priorities to determine
        how much CPU time the program will use. The higher the priority,
        the more time it will have. The range of values is -128 to 127,
        and the default process is 0. All tasks inherit the priority
        from the Shell it was launched from. It is suggested that all
        normal tasks maintain a priority less than 10. Priorities, from
        the user's standpoint, should be used such that CPU intensive
        programs use lower priorities than less CPU intensive programs.
        Raising a taks priority will not greatly affect CPU performance
        unless other CPU intensive processes are running. Use the Status
        command to list all processes executed from the current Shell.


            CUSTOM          -1  Used for CPU intensive processes when
                                the user requires access to other

            DISK DEVICES    10  Disk access requires more CPU time. If
                                given a lower priority, disk access times
                                suffers greatly.

            INPUT DEVICES   20  Input requires a high priority to ensure
                                the user will always have control over
                                the system.

@node diskcopy "DiskCopy 0.265"
@toc commands

    - DiskCopy FROM/A TO/A NAME/A NOVERIFY/S MULTI/S


            The DiskCopy command will duplicate a disk to a new disk,
        preserving all contents, only if the two disks have similar
        file structure capabilities. A floppy disk cannot be copied
        to a hard disk partition with this command, or from DH0: to
        RAM:, however RAD: can be designed to mimic other devices
        such as DF0:.


            FROM        the name of a source or destination device

            TO          a keyword inserted between the source and
                        the destination names

            NOVERIFY    overrides the Verify routines, making the
                        disk copy process much faster but unable
                        to check for erros in the transfer

            MULTI       allows one disk to have multiple destination
                        disks without reinserting the source disk for
                        every new destination disk

            NAME        overrides the name of the source disk and
                        provides a new name for the destination disk


            To copy individual files, use the AmigaDOS @{" Copy " link copy} command.

        copy all good files to a good disk that you wish to keep.
        Then, use DiskDoctor to try and recover the other files.
        Sometimes it may take more than one attempt to recover files.

            This command is used to display text in the CLI or Shell.
        It is similar to the PRINT statement in BASIC. All the following
        parameters are optional.

            NOLINE specifies that the cursor will not advance to the
                   next line after displaying the text.

            FIRST is the position in the string where the text will
                  begin printing.

            LEN is the number of characters that will be displayed.

            This is used in a script file to denote the beginning of
        a conditional block. When the script reaches this command, it
        will make a decision on whether to perform the block, to
        perform an alternate block, or to skip the block.


            NOT         uses the negative value defined by the

        to the NewCLI command and they may be interchanged.
            It is possible to have various AmigaShells that you may
        customize. The Shell icon is a Project icon. This allows you
        to set the default tool to SYS:Sytem/CLI, which is the default
        Shell tool. Various Shell Project icons can point to this tool.
        In the S: directory, you will have a file called Shell-Startup.
        This is addresses as default by a shell. However, you may use
        the FROM=s:shell-startup.1 tooltype, or a similar variation,
        to access a script file to be executed upon booting the shell.

    - IBM Frequently Asked Questions -


       10. Of course IBM's multitask.

        9. Wait a second. Let me escape to DOS.

        7. WindowsNT 3.1 version 1.0.

        8. The Pentium is out. Or is it the P5? Maybe the 586... well, my
           motherboard is P5 upgradable. You just remove it and pop in
           a new motherboard.

        7. It's 66 MHz. But only when it talks to itself. When it talks
           to the rest of the computer it is 33 MHz. Yeah, like the 33 MHz
           68040, only we call ours 66 MHz.

        6. 170 megabyte hard drive (w/Stacker).

        5. The IBM is for more serious games, like role playing adventures.
           None of that fast, blitzing high quality parallax scrolling,
           hardware sprites, double buffered animation, multi-processed
           audio, or fun stuff.

        4. Does anyone have a used mouse controller? I can't plug my mouse
           and printer in at the same time.

        3. Sure it only has a 640k limit. But all you have to do to add more
           memory to your operating system is buy this memory manager...

        2. NOTE: This RAM expansion board is not compatible with XYZ
           compatible graphics boards unless you change jumper J-152 and
           use the third card slot from the left. Also not compatible with
           ABC brand mouse controllers, FGH brand communications software,
           and JKL standard hard disk controllers unless you change
           jumper J-158 and use the first card slot on the right.

        1. Well, I happen to like 5.25" floppy drives!


                Microsoft says, "Buy Windows 3.1."

                "Buy OS/2."

                "Gotcha. I didn't say Microsoft Says."

    - Macintosh Frequently Asked Questions -


       10. How do I get balloon help for Balloon Help?

        9. The Macintosh Video Toaster? It sure looks a heck of a lot
           like an Amiga 2000.

        8. The Macintosh excels in productivity software.

        7. Best Seller This Week: Screenblanker Modules!

        6. When I open a new window does it lose the information from the
           old window?

        5. Sure it has multitasking. Just don't try to do more than one
           thing at the same time.

        4. Small, monochrome, low resolution monitors are awesome!

        3. The LC III; a price performance break through and all new
           technology. Introducing color to low cost computers!

        2. Introducing a whole new line of Apple computers! No, not just
           the same old thing in a new box! Would we do that?

        1. Maybe Marc will buy a Centris. God I hope so.
