DIRECT Commands (Commands NOT preceded by other characters)

A/      Re-execute Last Command
nnn     Escape Code per setting in register S2 (Default is ANSI character 43,
        the "+" symbol) (This command must be preceded and followed by a
        minimum period of no transmission set is register S12.)
<CR>    (A carriage return) - Terminate connection attempt in progress during
        the dialing or protocol neg. process.

DIALING Commands (Commands that follow ATD)

                  when DTR goes from LOW to HIGH.
         &Q3 *   Synchronous Mode 3 Dial number manually on a telephone, and
                  then bring DTR high to let the modems connect.
     * CAUTION!  Be VERY careful when issuing these commands!  Once you enter
                  &Q(1-3) and save it to memory, there are only three known
                  ways to return to Asynchronous Mode:
                 1. Issue AT &Q(0,5-9) &W from a Synchronous Terminal to restore
                    the modem to Asynchronous Mode.
                 2. Connect modem to an Asynchronous Terminal with the DTR
                    signal (line 20) disabled (a "break-out" box works very
                    nicely for this) and issue the configuration you want or
                    AT &Q(0,5-9) &W to return the modem to Asynchronous Mode.
                 3. Send the modem in to our repair department.

*R      Request Remote Configuration Mode (during MNP mode connection ONLY)
         If successful, a REMOTE PASSWORD prompt is display, and you should
         issue the 6 to 12 charactor password currently set.  If the password
         is accepted, a !AT prompt will be displayed and a limitted set of

          Result code syntax is as follows:

           TIME=HHMM (where HH is hour 00-23 & MM is minute 00-59)
         "Single Page Mode"
           NMBR= number code or statement*
               * The NUMBER CODE is normally either the subscriber's area code,
                 local exchange, and subscriber loop number, OR a code unique to
                 that individual subscriber. STATEMENTs are used for calls from
                 non Caller ID Areas and subscribers requesting no display.
           NAME= listed subscriber name <this is an option not always supported>
         "Multiple Page Mode"
           MESG= formatted number string * **
               * Here is an example string: 030A35303339363732343030
                 The string uses this code: CCLL#0#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9
                 CC (03) is the code meaning this is "Multiple Page" Caller ID
                 LL is the hexadecimal length of the data in the string.
                    (in this case 0A hex - 10 decimal)
                 #n's are the ASCII digits dialed (in hexadecimal)
                    A neat trick to convert these to decimal is to note that
                    the first digit is always a number "3" and the second digit
                    is the decimal number dialed, so the formatted string:
                    030A35303339363732343030 converts directly to 5039672400
              ** At the time of this printing, conversion of "Multiple Page"
                    Caller ID string coversion is not supported in the modem,
                    so the data is displayed in the raw hexadecimal format.
         #CID=2 Enable Raw (ASCII printable HEX number) Mode
         #CID=? Returns Caller ID Modes supported.

SCn=n   BUSY Detect Watermark Controls
         Each register "pair" holds the value for each setting.  To set a value,
         divide the setting by 256.  The integer goes in the second register,
         while the remained goes in the first.  (A setting of 516 would convert
         to 2 Remainder 4, and could be set by sending ATSC0=4SC1=2 to the
         modem.)  Settings are in 1/100ths of a second.
        Default values:
         Minimum BUSY ON Time
          SC0=30
          SC1=0
         Maximum BUSY ON Time
          SC2=75
          SC3=0
         Minimum BUSY OFF Time
          SC4=30
          SC5=0
         Maximum BUSY OFF Time
          SC6=75
          SC7=0
         (Defaults support FCC Spec. BUSY signal.  Setting SC0=25 & SC4=25
          allows FAST BUSY to also be detected as BUSY.)
SC8=n   Set number of valid BUSY Pulses before reporting BUSY (4 is default)

        ON----> @ 150mA  Modem Port is open and modem is activity in use.
        Sleep-> @  55mA  Modem Port is open, but modem is not processing any
                         commands and is not OFF-HOOK.
        OFF--->     0mA  Modem Port is closed.


***    WARNING   ***

The following commands are accepted by some models, but are ONLY for internal
use at Supra.  (Supra's staff cannot assist you in regard to these commands,
and under no case should you attempt use or adjust these settings.):

        ATS91=x
        ATS92=x
        ATS99=x
        AT!(x)

These commands are quite powerful and can cause unpredictable or total lack
of operation.  (In many cases, service at Supra would be required to restore
normal operation.)
