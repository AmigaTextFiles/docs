LineLink-Promodem144e Frequently Asked Questions Version 1.4.9
==============================================================
Version 1.5: December 13, 1994.

  This document gives information on the following Data/Fax/Voice
  modems:

* Prometheus Promodem 144e (roughly spring 1994 or later only)

* LineLink144e 14.4K  (Sold by MacWarehouse only)

* PowerUser 14,400 Data/Fax/Voice Modem.(Sold by MacWarehouse)

* VividLink 144e (Sold by MacMall).

* Performantz series modems (Sold by Mac Zone: Recent only)


  Prices range from $89 to $169  (November 1994). When comparing the
  same firmware/ROM revision, these modems are identical in terms of
  hardware (according to multiple sources at Prometheus). Warranty,
  versions of software included and technical support will vary
  widely! Looks like they are **NOT** selling the modem under the
  "Linelink" label as of mid November 1994.


  This FAQ also does not cover the other Prometheus modems, only the
  144e model. It MAY or may NOT apply to some degree on the internal
  versions of the modem sold as the Prometheus Promodem 144i (theres
  a Mac powerbook model and a PC model). The Magnum modems are
  **NOT** made by Prometheus and are **NOT** covered by this FAQ
  even though they are $99 modems sold by MacWarehouse!  Though this
  FAQ does cover a lot of generic things about 14.4K modems so it
  may be of some limited use to other modem users.


What's a LineLink144e Modem?
----------------------------
  The LineLink144e/Promodem/PowerUser/VividLink/Performantz etc is a
  modem with v42bis (compression), v42(error correction), v32bis
  (operates at a true 14,400 bps), has Class 2 Fax and Voice mail
  support in hardware. In other words pretty much everything you
  could want in a 14.4K modem, **EXCEPT** Caller ID,  silent answer,
  Class 1 or Class 2.0 fax support.

  To avoid using Linelink/Promodem/PowerUser/VividLink/Performantz
  to refer to the modem. I will always refer to the modem later as a
  Linelink or LineLink144e since these were the first Prometheus
  made modem to use the chipset (I think!).  As the Linelink becomes
  less popular I may change this to the Promodem144e in later FAQ's.

  Most CURRENT Linelinks combined with the CURRENT MaxFax software
  allows you to send and receive fax documents and do voice mail.
  One telephone line can be used for both features. Specifically it
  recognizes incoming Faxes via the Fax CNG tones. This is a major
  improvement over previous versions of the modem (Firmware
  revisions 1.0, 1.3). **Note** As I am writing this **NO ONE** who
  is NOT associated with Prometheus has reported that this feature
  actually works reliably. I would greatly appreciate email telling
  me if it actually does.

  More details can be found in "Specifications" and "Ordering"
  section

Legal Crap
==========

     **SHARE THIS INFORMATION FREELY AND IN GOOD FAITH**
     **DO NOT DISTRIBUTE MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THIS FAQ**
       **DO NOT REMOVE THIS NOTICE OR THE TEXT ABOVE**

  This FAQ is purely a volunteer effort. Although every effort has
  been made to insure that answers are as complete and accurate as
  possible, **NO GUARANTEE IS IMPLIED OR INTENDED**. The editor and
  indirectly the contributors have developed this FAQ as a service
  to the online community.

  You may upload or download this file anywhere including BBS's,
  ftp, gopher, WWW sites etc. to your heart's content. It may be
  placed on CD-ROM's including the info-mac CD-ROM. However do
  **NOT** upload to major internet sites ( macgifts, info-mac
  ,umich). I do that myself. If you wish to upload to AOL  or
  CompuServe please contact me first so they don't get three dozen
  copies!

  Exceptions to the above: Sections of this FAQ not exceeding 7000
  characters in TOTAL length may be reprinted, modified or used for
  any purpose. Anything larger requires prior approval (which is
  likely to be given). Also do not upload DRAFT versions of the FAQ,
  they are likely to contain more errors than normal versions!

  Please send your corrections and comments to the editor, Loudon
  Campbell, at loudon@uts.cc.utexas.edu. The FAQ does not improve
  otherwise!



About the FAQ itself
====================
  After reading this FAQ read the Linelink mailing list for help and
  check the ftp/gopher archive site mentioned later. For newest
  versions of the FAQ always check the ftp/gopher archive site
  first. If you have a world wide web client you can also check via
  my personal page at

http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~loudon/main.html

Still to do
-----------
  Cleanup MaxFax voice mail section and add more comments. Same with
  Communicate Lite, Mark/Space Zmodem Tool and comm toolbox. Some
  ftp site listings still need to be checked and changed to more
  consistent URL's.

Versions and History
--------------------
Version 1.5: December 13, 1994.

  The LineLink was first sold in beginning of Aug/Sept 93.

  First FAQ for the LineLink was done in early September 93 by Jorn
  Barger (jorn@genesis.MCS.COM). John E. Bossom
  (jebossom@cognos.COM) then added to it. I had started my own FAQ
  for personal use and incorporated a lot from their FAQ (and a lot
  of other posts) in mid October 1993. These guys said they were
  dropping it, so I took it up.  Yes, they had a few things correct
  that I didn't include and found out the hard way!

  Previous Versions:
      ( 1.5     Dec. 13 1994) Fixed a few minor things.
      ( 1.4.9   Dec. 12 1994) Major reformatting- line length 68.

      ( 1.4.5    Sept 9 1994) Public Draft on ftp gopher site
      ( 1.4.1    May 10 1994) Version sent to AOL.
      ( 1.4    March 30 1994) Version on info-mac and ftp sites.
      ( 1.3.3  March 21 1994) Private Distribution Only
      ( 1.3.2  March 10 1994) Corrupt version posted to info-mac!
      ( 1.3.1  March  9 1994) First version posted to macgifts.

       Sept 1993 First version by John Bossom and Jorn Barger



* Changes Since 1.4.5
  Much better and more correct section on Communicate Lite.
  Apologies to Brian Hall and the Mark/Space people. Interslip and
  many other program sections updated. Updated ftp site info.

* Changes Since 1.4.1:
  Too many for detailed list, highlights are: Info on new version of
  ROM/firmware. New version of MaxFax. Communicate Lite is now
  bundled with modem. Upgrade to Prometheus Promodem available (New
  Roms and MaxFax). Gopher and ftp server for Linelink. Comments on
  ValueFax Fax shareware software.



Internet and this FAQ
---------------------
  This FAQ is biased to internet users. This is mainly in terms of
  giving locations of programs on the internet for download and
  email addresses. As of October 1994 AOL has started beta testing
  their ftp software and other major services are moving in that
  direction. Mail servers on the internet can automagically send
  some of these files via email even without that capability. See
  near end of this FAQ for details. Note that AOL and compuserve can
  search for files by name in **THEIR** databases and are likely to
  have the files I am mentioning here under similiar names.

  To get most of the free/demo/shareware programs listed in this FAQ
  you can ftp from various computer sites. You can also send email
  to a listserver to obtain these files. By the time you read this ,
  these files may well be updated or moved but they probably will be
  in a similiar location. Lists of mirror sites of the info-mac and
  umich archives are in the ftp section. A mini primer on ftp and
  related topics is at the end of this FAQ.



Format of the FAQ
-----------------
  For best results in viewing this file use a small monospaced font
  (9 or 10 point Courier or Monaco are good choices). View it with
  any word processor or editor capable of reading a plain ASCII text
  file this large.


  Better yet use an setext format reader. "setext" format, stands
  for Structure Enhanced Text format. Which is just an ordinary text
  file that follows simple formating rules so that programs will be
  able to view this file in outline format. As well as the use of
  **bold** , _underlined_ and ~italic~ text. Using a setext reader
  will let you find what you are looking for in a few seconds (I
  hope!) instead of scrolling through 50+ pages. For more
  information about setext format send email with the single word
  "setext" (no quotes) in the Subject: line to
  <fileserver@tidbits.com> A file should be returned shortly via
  email.



  The macintosh "setext" viewer is EasyView.  Its available at
  info-mac mirrors or on umich mirrors as

info-mac/text/easy-view-250.hqx
umich/util/text/easyview2.50.sit.hqx

  an extension that allows you to directly access URL's via anarchie
  or MacWeb from within Easyview (or BBedit) is

info-mac/text/bbedit-get-url-11.hqx
umich/util/text/bbeditgeturl.cpt.hqx

  The setext reader for Microsoft MS Windows 3.x is at

ftp://ftp.halcyon.com//disk2/tidbits/misc/EASYVIEW.uue


  The unix setext reader is at

info-mac/help/cutil/setext-viewer-05-unix.uu

  or

<ftp://ftp.halcyon.com//disk2/tidbits/tisk/util/
setext-viewer-03-unix.uu>

  You can also find these programs on the "LineLink" ftp/gopher site

ftp://spinfree.cm.utexas.edu/

  Or the world wide web page at

About the LineLink FAQ editor
-----------------------------
  Please inform me of any information you find that is incorrect.
  Also contributions of information are greatly appreciated
  especially settings for programs not listed (including IBM
  software and Amigas) are especially appreciated.

  I am not a modem guru, just a reasonably happy LineLink owner. I
  have no special relation with MacWarehouse or Prometheus, beyond
  bugging their tech support and getting answers from some of their
  employees. I am largely just compiling information from usenet
  news groups, email and personal experience.

  I purchased my Linelink in September or October of 1993. Hence I
  have orginal version 1.0 of the ROMS/Firmware. Information on
  other ROMS/Firmware is all second hand.

  Most of the information for using the LineLink as a data modem on
  the Macintosh below was **VERIFIED** by myself (i.e. there may
  have been someone else who deserves the real credit).  This
  includes the more popular terminal emulation programs such as
  zterm, ClarisWorks, Communicate Lite, Macknowledge, etc as well as
  the internet tools Macslip, InterSlip and MacPPP. I will try to
  help on problems with applications such as these.

  I have used and own a copy of MaxFax 3.3.1L, beta tested ValueFax,
  and own (temporarily!) a copy of FaxSTF 2.2.3. However, I am only
  a light user of Fax. I almost NEVER send a Fax and only receive
  Faxes on occasion.  Hence for both Fax and voice I am largely
  relying on second or third hand information for real life
  experiences.

Why this FAQ is geared to Macintosh users.
------------------------------------------
  I will happily include init strings and the like for IBM programs
  or Amigas.  **BUT I NEED PEOPLE TO SEND THEM TO ME**  I now have
  one volunteer for the Amiga section so things MAY improve for
  Amiga owners in the next major version of this FAQ.

Reasons:

* Current LineLinks sold for the Mac market have an internal jumper
  between DTR and RTS. You should buy the LineLink from
  MicroWarehouse not MacWarehouse for either an IBM, Amiga, or UNIX
  box.

* I don't want to get into UART chips, interrupts, port addresses,
  BIOS versions, config.sys, win.ini etc. Yes, I own a 386 I pieced
  together from junk parts as well as a quadra 605.  I don't use
  PC's for modem or Fax though OS/2 Warp looks interesting!

* Expensive UNIX boxes justify expensive V34 28.8K modems.

* The FAQ is getting too big and too much work as it is!




Specifications
==============

  The various CURRENT modems have the same feature set which is as
  follows

* FULL Error correction and data compression (v.42/v.42bis/MNP-5) In
  theory speeds can get up to an effective rate of 57,600 bps. But
  please don't expect any real data go this fast.

* Has all the old standards (V.21/V.22/V.23, Bell 103). As well as
  modern V.32 (9600) and V.32 bis (14400). It works from 75 bps all
  the way up to full 14,400 bps.

* Truly useless manual and documentation. Manual is 28 pages. This
  is the worst feature of buying this modem. S-Registers, Fax and
  Voice commands for this particular modem are detailed in documents
  found on the Prometheus BBS.  This info is also on the Linelink
  gopher ftp site.


* HARDWARE capable to 14.4K faxes Uses Class 2 Fax which is better
  than Class 1 and as of late 1994 the most common Fax standard for
  modems. (Class 2.0 is current). If you own Fax Software it will
  probably work with correct init strings. Works with FaxStf 2.2.3,
  ValueFax, QuickLink II, FaxPro 1.5 and MaxFax 3.3.1  and above.
  FaxStf 2.6.x and 3.0.x however, have problems with receiving
  Faxes. No cure in sight as of Nov 4 1994!

* FIRMWARE as of this moment the current firmware version is 1.4g.
  Versions previous to this do NOT have Fax CNG tone recognition! Be
  sure to ask when you purchase if its the most current Firmware!


* Macintosh Communication Software CURRENTLY supplied is Communicate
  Lite by Mark/Space Softworks. This is a very competent Comm
  Toolbox based program. There is detailed info in the seperate
  section on Communicate Lite found later in the FAQ.


* Owners of OLDER modems were stuck with MacKnowledge software,
  which is **NOT** associated with Communicate Lite's authors. THAT
  software was old, didn't support modern standards like the comm
  toolbox or zmodem, had poor online manual and didn't work in 32bit
  mode. Mark/Space is now doing a competitive upgrade to Communicate
  Lite for MacKnowledge owners at $29.95  (includes a full featured
  Zmodem tool). Competitive upgrades to other commercial software
  are Sitcomm ($45) and Microphone Pro 2.0 ($79). Also consider the
  shareware alternatives Zterm ($30 or $40) and Telefinder Pro ($15)
  which are quite good also but are not Comm Toolbox based.


* Fax/Voice software  Most CURRENT modems being sold INCLUDE MaxFax
  software. In the past the software was an extra price purchase
  most of the time! In the past and currently there were two
  versions of MaxFax. One is Fax only and one is Fax and Voice. When
  purchasing a NEW modem be careful that you get the Fax and Voice
  version if thats what you want! And make sure its version 3.5.1 or
  later!  MaxFax is good Fax/Voice software. It has multiple
  mailboxes, fax mailing lists, good user interface (for most part).

* With the current MaxFax and current modems, you can receive both
  Fax and voice calls on one phone line correctly! (I.e. the modem
  detects the difference!). Voice quality is also improved over the
  older modems. Reports as of Nov 5, 1994 indicate these features do
  not work as reliably as Prometheus claims however.

* Uses Seirra chip set

* Uses a digital signal processor and permanent ROMS/firmware (no
  flash ROM, you have trade in your old modem for upgrades which
  cost significant amounts of money).

* Includes power supply .  Its a 120 volt transformer. Output Rated
  at 9 Volts AC at 1 amp, 15 watts. International users please note
  you will need to purchase a 240 volt AC to 9 volt AC adapter.

* Dimensions: Cheap, clean white plastic, rectangular 1.75"x7"x8"
  Size of hard cover novel. Has cheap "feel" a little bigger than it
  should be but looks OK.

* The modem has a cheap built-in speaker that sounds horrible.

* Has fewer LEDs (lights) than most modems do. The lights it has are
  AA (Auto Answer), CD (Carrier Detect), OH (off hook), MR (modem
  ready) and IO (Instead of separate Receive Data and Send Data
  lights).  Some people find this a big deal, most could care less.

* The relay also chatters _extremely_ noisily on pulse dialing.

* LineLinks use slide on/off switch (in theory prone to wear).

* Includes a Mac to modem hardware handshaking cable.**HOWEVER**, if
  you bought a modem before Jan 1994 or are planning on using your
  modem on a PC or your cable on another modem read the subsection
  later on the cable!

* Comes with AppleTalk Remote Access scripts that seem to work with
  ARA 1.0. Unknown success rate with ARA 2.0.  Current MaxFax
  supports (but does not include) Lineshare software. So with
  MaxFax, Lineshare and ARA you can use one phone line to do just
  about everything.

* Technical Support is provided by MacWarehouse for the Linelink and
  PowerUser modems via a 800 number.  Prometheus handles tech
  support for their modem directly. Since Prometheus tech support
  does NOT have an 800 number use email if at all possible! Saves
  time on hold!


* Warranty varies with model.  The Linelink from MacWarehouse has a
  120 day warranty from Macwarehouse. The PowerUser has 1 year
  warranty. The Prometheus Promodem has a 5 year warranty. Don't
  know about other modems.

  The following are **non-features** of the Linelink. The firmware
  and chipset supports these features but a relay is not included in
  the modem itself to implement these.

* You can't use the telephone hooked up to your modem to record your
  outgoing announcement. If you don't have a Mac with a sound input
  (or can't borrow someones), you must call your mac from another
  phone to record outgoing messages.

* Almost Supports Caller ID (You can use it for some purposes
  though)







Modem Ordering Information
==========================

  **WARNING**  It is conceivable some of these companies have old
  stock they are trying to sell. They all appear to include MaxFax.
  What versions of MaxFax or ROMS are being sold by which companies
  is unknown and is currently changing.  **BE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT
  YOURSELF!** Especially whether the voice mail version of MaxFax is
  included or the Fax version. For addresses, phone numbers etc see
  company address section.


  Editors two cents: At current prices buy the Prometheus Promodem
  14.4. Its now cheaper, has 5 year warranty and the better "name"!


* From catalog 25cd MacZone (November 1994) sells

  Performantz Upgradeable 14.4 Data Modem $99.98 Part #96571 with
  "Free Fax Upgrade"

  14.4 Performantz S/R Data Modem,  $129.98 Part #99322 Includes
  Compuserve and eWorld starter kits.

* MacZone also sells the Prometheus 144e with MaxFax three different
  ways.

  Prometheus 14.4 S/R External Fax Modem. Includes MaxFax for $79.98
  part #93360 but catch is you have to buy the Prodigy Memebership
  Kit part #93359 for $19.98. Five year warranty.

  Prometheus 14.4 S/R  Fax Modem w/America Online Membership for the
  Mac. $99.98 Part #93371. Five year warranty.

  Prometheus Promodem 144e (Definitely includes MaxFax 3.5.x voice
  version, almost surely current ROM) Part # 00062, $129.98. Five
  year warranty.


* MacWarehouse  (Catalog 36 November 1994) sells:

  PowerUser 14,400 Data/Fax/Voice Modem.  $169 Part # MOD 0181   1
  year warranty.

  Prometheus Promodem 144e Voice Modem with MaxFax $119.95 Part #
  MOD 0064

  Prometheus Promodem 144e (No voice) $89.95  Part # DMD 1352



* MacMall sells:

  VividLink 14.4K Fax Modem $99 Part #65304 Includes MaxFax but
  unknown version, firmware and warranty.

  Prometheus 14.4 ProModem with Voice  $129.99   Part # 65173 Five
  year warranty. Current MaxFax and ROMS apparently


* Also, Prometheus Promodem 144e for the Mac is $89.47 part
  #31-10362 from Computer City (Its a national chain owned by
  Tandy/Radio Shack) .  They sold out locally by the time I got
  around to checking on details.

Technical Support
=================
  See previous section titled "Company Addresses, Phone Numbers and
  email" for addresses phone numbers etc.

  Technical support questions on Communicate Lite are handled by
  Mark/Space Softworks. Macknowledge questions are handled by
  Prometheus. Questions on the modem itself go to Prometheus if you
  bought a Prometheus Promodem. If you bought another "House brand"
  modem contact the company you bought it from.

  The technical support number of MacWarehouse is 1-800-925-6227.
  MacWarehouse can be reached at: 70007.1616@compuserve.com. I am
  sorry to say this but Macwarehouse has disseminated more
  misinformation than valuable information. They are courteous and
  they do try so they may be able to help.


Online groups
-------------
  In general ask questions on AOL, Compuserve, the LineLink mailing
  list. I believe there is a forum/area for Prometheus on AOL.

The following internet Usenet newsgroups would be helpful also
  comp.dcom.modems
  comp.dcom.fax

For Mac users also look at
  comp.sys.mac.comm
  comp.sys.mac.hardware


For Amiga owners also look at
  comp.sys.amiga.comm




Documents and Manuals
---------------------
  If you got Macknowledge Software instead of Communicate Lite the
  "Manual" was on disk and outdated. If they had bothered to update
  the manual to be specific for the Linelink modem they could have
  saved a lot of grief for early buyers.

  The MaxFax software manual is quite good. It answers most
  questions about MaxFax. However, it may take you a while to find
  the answer to your question, for that reason I suggest actually
  reading the manual cover to cover a couple days after you get
  MaxFax.

  The Communicate Lite Manual is very good. It explains things very
  well and is highly organized. (Would be nice if it covered the
  Apple supplied Comm Toolbox tools, but those are Apple tools after
  all) If you are using System 7.01, you will be quite pleased with
  the Balloon Help. I would say the Balloon Help is almost more
  complete than the manual!

  If you decide to buy the Mark/Space Zmodem Tool the manual and the
  Balloon Help is at least as good as Communicate Lite's.


  However the MODEM manual is next to useless. It does not cover any
  command in detail. Does not cover S registers, Fax or Voice
  commands AT ALL!

  The Prometheus BBS is at 1-503-691-5199. Documents on the
  Sregisters, Fax and Voice commands are something like
  144E_SREG.TXT, CLASS2.TXT,and VOICE231.TXT.(or VO231.TXT) . Its
  been a while since I called you may need to look around.


  The voice and fax documents really are not of general use. The are
  useful only if you are writing Fax or Voice mail software from
  scratch, or perhaps trying to do Resedit hacks to existing
  software.

  The S register document is (almost) essential. I only found two
  outright errors. Part of description of S12 seems wrong and
  default value on S1 appears to be typo i.e. its 0 not 43.


  Shishin "Squish" Yamada wrote his own " Linelink Manual". Its
  available on info-mac archive. Version 1.0 of his manual states
  the Linelink has Silent Answer which to the best of my knowledge
  is NOT true. Its available at info-mac, umich as

      linelink-144e-commands-10.txt

  Its also the document V001N081.TX on the mailing list archive
  server. Version 1.1 should be available soon.



  If you want DETAILED info on AT commands in a more readable
  format. Get the "The Hayes command set" including S-registers. Its
  written by Hayes for THEIR modems. It can be found at following
  sites.

  ftp://rigel.acs.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/modem/trm20.zip
  ftp://ftp.uu.net:/systems/ibmpc/msdos/simtel20/modem/trm20.zip
  ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu:/systems/ibmpc/msdos/modem/trm20.zip
  ftp://ccsun.unicamp.br:/pub3/simtel20/modem/trm20.zip
  ftp://plaza.aarnet.edu.au:/micros/pc/oak/modem/trm20.zip

  You will need to unzip the file either on a PC or Mac. Again this
  document (unziped, sit and reformated versions) can be found on
  the Linelink ftp/gopher site.


  Another good place to look at files outlining commands for both
  data and FAX is the site

ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/pub/supra/

  Keep in mind this is a Prometheus manufactured modem. Their
  implementation is not Hayes' or Supra's. Use the Prometheus
  documents to determine what is implemented and the other documents
  for further detailed explanation. Note the LineLink does not
  strictly adhere to the Hayes command set (Minor differences). &R0
  and &R1 are particular examples as well at TIES behavior.

  With the above documents you should be nearly fully informed on
  the data Fax and voice features of your modem. In fact for most
  people you will have too much information.




Gopher Server FTP archive
=========================

  I have set up a gopher and ftp site. **IF** you have access to the
  internet you can get files stored on this site via either gopher
  or anonymous ftp (or indirectly throught the world wide web). The
  URLs are

ftp://spinfree.cm.utexas.edu/
gopher://spinfree.cm.utexas.edu/

  The site IP address is

              128.83.163.58

  This site is NOT sponsored or supported by Prometheus in any
  fashion. It contains no commercial software. It contains only
  INFORMATION on the Linelink, including

* The most current "official" Linelink FAQ  and older versions.

* Linelink modem documentation (S registers , Fax, Voice)

* The Linelink mailing list digest articles. Stan Hall kindly
  provided me with all the back issues!

* A few important or critical files for Macintosh users.

* Setup files, modem and ARA scripts etc.

* Misc documents. Possibly patches in the future.

* Gopher menus have links to important ftp and gopher sites on the
  internet of particular interest to communication on the Macintosh
  and major archive sites for Mac, PC and Next. Use gopher to this
  site if you have any choice, its easier, faster and more
  automatic!
  To use gopher on a unix box you would just type

gopher spinfree.cm.utexas.edu

  and follow the menus / lists from there.


  If you don't have gopher, to use ftp on a unix box just type

ftp spinfree.cm.utexas.edu

  Then when it prompts you for a user name type anonymous and when
  asked for your password type in your mail address. The site is
  tricky to use ftp on if you are trying to get IBM PC binaries but
  is easy for Mac users or Unix users getting files for their Macs.

  A short primer on ftp can be found near the END of this document.

  At present you can log in at anytime. However please avoid its use
  between 11AM and 5PM Central Standard Time. Its a lowly Macintosh
  SE/30 being used for other tasks. So it may be overwhelmed or
  crash at any time etc. So please be courteous and expect the
  unexpected.

  Email me at loudon@uts.cc.utexas.edu for problems with the server
  or the content of the files on the server. Such as if you have
  more current files than I do!


LineLink Mailing List
=====================

  "This list is for discussion of the LineLink 144e modem sold by
  MacWarehouse and manufactured by Prometheus.  All discussions
  concerning this modem are welcome especially those about using it
  on platforms other than a Macintosh."


  This is the best place to ask questions and get/give current info
  on the LineLink modem. It doesn't get much traffic now though. If
  you need info on using the Linelink with a PC, Amiga, NeXT
  computer or whatever try here first!


  The mailing list and list server for the LineLink was established
  by Stan Hall, whose email address is  <kilgore@pylon.pillar.com>.

  If you wish to send a message to all of the list members, mail
  your message to:

      LineLink@pylon.pillar.com

  However, before you do that your really should join the list!

  If you would like to join the mailing list (highly suggested) send
  an email message to listserv@pylon.pillar.com with the following
  in the body , **NOT** in the subject line

       JOIN LINELINK
       QUIT

  Within a day or so you will be added to the mailing list.


  To unjoin the list just substitute UNJOIN above for JOIN in the
  example.


  The old digests and the Linelink FAQ are archived on the
  listserver also.  In the past I have not kept good track of what
  is on the mail server. I often assumed certain files were archived
  there that were not. That was my fault not Stan Hall's.


  The address for the archive server is:
      archive-server@pylon.pillar.com


  The commands used for the archive server(s) are:

HELP
  Returns command summary.

REPLYTO
  Responses from the server will be sent to this address instead of
  the address in the "From: " line.

INDEX
  Will send a listing of files available from this server.

GET <filespec> [uue[ncode] | xxe[ncode]]
  Sends the specified file <filespec>.  UU or XXencoding can be
  specified.

QUIT
  Causes anything after this command to be ignored.




  To get a list of all files on the server send an email message to
         archive-server@pylon.pillar.com

  the email should have in its body, NOT the subject line, the
  following two commands:

      INDEX
      QUIT

  Within a day or so you will get an email message back with the
  file listing.

**Example:**
  Lets assume the Linelink FAQ is listed as
  /public/LineLink/LineLink.faq

  To get that file send an email message to
  archive-server@pylon.pillar.com the email should have in its body,
  the following two commands:
       GET /public/LineLink/LineLink.faq
       QUIT

  **DON'T** put the commands in the subject line. Within a day or so
  you will get an email message back with the file.



Firmware/ROM revisions (And their BUGS)
=======================================

  At this writing current chipset is ABC, and current ROMS are 1.4g.
  I don't know how to determine the chipset.

  To determine which ROMS/firmware you have first get into command
  mode.

  Then type command ATI3I4I6

  Version 1.0 of the ROMs give result

Copyright (c) 1993 SSC, V1.0  - 08/27/93
SERIAL * V32BIS * V42BIS * VOICE 2.2 * TIES * CID * V23 * SRFAX *
DSP Version: V1.20
MCP Version: V1.3  - 07/07/93, Copyright (c) 1993 SSC

  The "Copyright (c) 1993 SSC, V1.0  - 08/27/93" above gives the
  ROM/Firmware revision as  1.0.


  Version 1.3 of the ROMs give results

Copyright (c) 1994 SSC, V1.3B.2     - 01/19/94
SERIAL * V32BIS * V42BIS * VOICE 2.2 * TIES * CID * SRFAX *
DSP Version: V1.30
MCP Version: V1.3  - 07/07/93, Copyright (c) 1993 SSC


  Version 1.4g of the ROMS give results (to ATI3I4 ?)

Copyright (c) 1994 Prometheus, V1.4G LL4.1 - 06/24/94
SERIAL * INT-HYB * V32BIS * V42BIS * VOICE 2.3 * TIES * V23 *
CLASS2 FAX *
DSP Version: V1.20

  I need the I6 command results yet on the 1.4g ROMS! Any one care
  to supply it?


  Version 1.3 of the ROMS have real problems connecting at high
  speed to various other brands of modems. (Telebits for instance).
  See seperate section on this problem. Similiar problems MAY exist
  on other versions of the ROM but no where near as severe as 1.3
  ROM modems!



  Voice features on version 1.0 and 1.3 ROMS are essentially
  identical. They are limited as follows when used with ANY version
  of voice/fax MaxFax used in voice mode.

* The CALLER must punch 77# to enable Fax during the outgoing
  message. The modem DOES NOT recognize Fax CNG tones.

* No volume control. (Actually I think you can get around this
  limitation)

* Fair to Poor voice quality. (Understandable but not good)

  Version 1.4g of the ROM/Firmware combined with MaxFax 3.5.1 ,
  **ACCORDING** to Prometheus eliminates the data, fax and voice
  bugs and nonfeatures listed above.  Check the user comments
  section on MaxFax 3.5.1 however. The reports I have from users so
  far indicates there are still problems with voice and Fax CNG tone
  recognition.

  In any case the new software and the OLD ROMS do NOT give you
  these features! Whether new bugs are present only time will tell.


  All versions of the modems do NOT include a second relay that
  would

* Allow full use of Caller ID.

* Allow recording off the phone connected to the Linelink.

* Perhaps allow silent answer.  (Voice mail makes this Redundant!)


Upgrades: Hardware and Software
===============================

Upgrades from Prometheus
------------------------
  Facts are either from Prometheus sales 800 number or other
  Prometheus employees.

  If you purchased a Prometheus modem AFTER May 15, 1994 the upgrade
  to MaxFax 3.5.x is FREE.  If you purchased a modem BEFORE May 15,
  1994 there are two upgrade paths:

        MaxFax 3.5.x with Fax & Voice is $24.95 + $5 shipping.

        MaxFax 3.5.x with Fax only is $19.95 + $5 shipping.

  Users of older modems (Linelinks or Promodems or any of the other
  Prometheus manufactered modems) can upgrade to the ProModem 144e
  for $99 + shipping. This modem has the newer firmware (1.4g or
  later) You DO have to trade in your old modem. You DO get the new
  3.5.1 MaxFax software and Communicate Lite. The offer ends
  December 1994. I don't know for sure about a manuals and warranty
  (they sent the wrong info via US mail).

  For more info on these upgrades, call 1-800-477-3473.


  In combination with the latest 1.4g firmware in the MODEM this
  gives better quality and faster voice recordings, volume control,
  Fax/Voice discrimination (Thats THE BIG NEW FEATURE) and a lot of
  bells and whistles (like multiple mailboxes per caller,etc).  Its
  also has better support for AV's, PowerMac's , System 7.5 etc.

  (See however the user comments later on some problems)

  They now use DPCM sound compression rather than CVSD, which
  improves the voice recording quality and makes the codec times
  much faster. Translation: Its quicker and better at voice
  recording.

  It adds support for Lineshare (which for instance allows ARA and
  FAX to be received on one phone line) but does NOT include
  Lineshare software itself which would require a seperate purchase.
  (A demo version of Lineshare is available that allows a limited
  number of connections)

  Bad news is the MaxFax 3.5.1 software upgrade does NOT add the Fax
  / Voice discrimination or better voice quality to the 1.0 or 1.3
  firmware versions of the modem. You need a firmware (aka ROM)
  revision to the lastest 1.4g firmware for these. Since they are
  part of the board you have to do the $99 modem swap!  You can use
  the new software on the old firmware Linelinks, though and get the
  other improved features.

Communicate-Lite Upgrade
------------------------
  For owners of Linelinks/Promodems etc. Mark/Space Softworks has an
  upgrade to the full featured ZMODEM tool for $19.95 plus shipping.
  (There was a coupon in the box).  For owners of Macknowledge you
  can upgrade to Communicate Lite and the ZMODEM Tool for $29.95
  plus shipping.  Call 1-800-799-1718 to purchase.  For company info
  and location of the demos of this software see corresponding
  sections.


The editors two cents on upgrades
---------------------------------
  For recent and FUTURE purchasers of modems this is very good news.
  Prometheus have (in theory!) addressed most users major beefs with
  the modem! Though it looks like there are some teething pains on
  the new versions of MaxFax.

  For owners of Linelinks that NEVER purchased MaxFax or similiar
  software, I think you would be foolish not to get the software
  upgrade. Its as cheap as the shareware program ValueFax and better
  Fax software, PLUS you get Communicate Lite which is a BIG
  improvement over Macknowledge.

  For owners of Linelinks that did have MaxFax previously its a
  tough call. Weigh in the fact that the PowerMacs, AVs, ARA and
  System 7.5 are better supported with the new software. If you
  don't fit that profile it doesn't sound like its worth upgrading
  (i.e. if its not broke don't fix it). I don't know anyone who
  bought the software only upgrade yet, so I may be completely
  wrong!

  For owners of Linelinks that never purchased a better
  communication program than Macknowledge you should definitely
  consider getting Communicate Lite with the Zmodem tool.


  Given that Prometheus is charging $99 + shipping for a hardware
  upgrade on the modem and I now see the Prometheus Promodem is
  being sold locally for $89.47 (Nov 12, 1994) it would be stupid
  for anyone to do the hardware upgrade. Note: The price on new
  14.4K modems has fallen about $45 the past three months so
  Prometheus does NOT deserve flames on this policy since it was
  initiated then not NOW.

  If you have the old ROMS (1.0 or 1.3) you may be somewhat upset
  about the hardware upgrade. We KNEW the ROMS were probably NOT
  upgradeable since the Linelink came out!

  On the other hand, I think people who bought a Linelink and MaxFax
  with Voice when it was advertised by MacWarehouse as discrimating
  the Fax CNG tone from voice mail probably have a very legitimate
  gripe with either MacWarehouse or Prometheus! However, they only
  did that in one or two catalogs,for about a month or so and
  usually included a paper in the box noting the problem.  So only a
  very small percentage of owners fit that bill.


Undocumented Modem Features
===========================
  Some S registers seem to have larger ranges than indicated in the
  documentation.

ATW2
----
  Command ATW2 works. The corresponding register (S95) that Hayes
  uses is not present however. ATW2 just reports the carrier speed
  instead of the serial port (DTE) speed in the CONNECT message
  reported by the modem. Personally, I find ATW1 much nicer.


Caller ID (the feature that is sort of there)
---------------------------------------------
  Please note this is not a bug its a non-feature. Many people
  report the modem doesn't crash as Chris Baker says in some
  situations so its occasionally usable. A relay is not included as
  a cost cutting measure (reasonable since so few people have Caller
  ID at present and modems are at cutthroat prices now). I think the
  missing relay MIGHT also have been used for other features such as
  recording outgoing messages from the local phone.

  From Chris Baker (a co-author of MaxFax):

  The LineLink firmware DOES support caller id detection.  The modem
  will display the caller id it receives from the phone co.  The
  only problem is the modem will then crash and require a powercycle
  to get it back because the LineLink doesn't have the necessary
  relay switch onboard.

  To try the caller ID yourself do the following:'AT#VS4' after the
  OK set your DTE to DCE (port) speed to 19.2k and enter 'AT#CC1' to
  indicate formatted caller id output.



Modem Bugs and Misfeatures
==========================

  People have reported that the LineLink is about 15% slower than
  other modems in side by side comparisons.  At present I discount
  this claim, it appears to be about dead even with the majority of
  other 14.4K modems.

  Some of the S registers are NOT saved to non-volative memory that
  you might ASSUME should be saved. Most notably register S7 is not
  saved to non-volatile memory. (Thanks to Neil Schulman for
  pointing this out). This is NOT a bug, what is saved or not saved
  is largely up to the manufacturer.

  CNG FAX tones are only recognized for modems with version 1.4g
  ROMS or later.

  One person bought 4 LineLinks, after about 8 Hours of being on
  unattended they had to be reset manually. This seems to be generic
  problem with LineLink in that only power on and power off seems to
  solve strange problems.  (It seems particularly prone in Fax and
  voice modes). I have personally managed to get the Linelink in
  these types of states  but mostly when trying out undocumented or
  poorly documented commands voice commands.

My Modem only doesn't connect at XXXX baud. Whats Wrong?
--------------------------------------------------------
  If the modem never connects to ANY modem at any speed check the
  obvious (i.e. cables are plugged in to correct places, phone cord
  is good etc). If you set your modem at 9600 bps and get a 9600 bps
  connection but can't work above that speed I suspect you do NOT
  have hardware flow control working correctly. See cable , hardware
  handshaking and software setup section and not this section. If
  the modem works with at least one other high speed modem at all
  speeds but not all high speed modems you call continue reading
  here.

  95% of the time the factory defaults work perfectly. 9 out of 10
  times of the remaining 5% its you screwing up the software. But
  sometimes all hell breaks loose. The techniques that follow apply
  to all versions of the ROMS but are most useful on the 1.3 ROM
  modems.

  Version 1.3 of the ROMS have real problems connecting at high
  speed to various other brands of modems (Telebits, Zooms, Supra,
  Microcom, Avtek).  See the ROM/firmware section for details on how
  to determine which ROM you have.

    **  No real cure yet exists! We have bandaids only!  **

  Typically you get a connection at 4800 bits per second instead of
  14400. Sometimes its no connection at all. Sometimes its works on
  dialing in but not out and sometimes its the reverse.

  People in Australia and New Zealand are particularly prone to this
  problem, or maybe those "down under" are just more vocal!


  If you get a connection at all then try this technique that people
  have used successfully in many situations:


  Aftering connection you can try getting into command mode by
  escaping (i.e. typing + + + and then AT <return> ) Then type ATO1.
  (That is a letter "O" not the number zero!) This tries to retrain
  equilization in the connection. It often produces a better
  connection! (i.e. 14400). This technique seems to help with ZOOMS
  and a few other brands on occasion.

  If instead you try ATO3 instead of ATO1 above this forces the
  modems to renegotiate their speeds, protocols and compression.
  This technique gets a 14400 connection with Avtek modems which
  normally only get 4800 bps. It disconnects Telebits however!

  The above is easy and often effective "bandaid". You do have to
  get a connection though!


  These results strongly indicates there is a problem in either
  v32bis or v42bis negotiation!



  By trial and error Doug Bonar (bonar@lagrange.rutgers.edu) tried
  several settings I suggested based on other peoples previous
  attempts. He used a Linelink with 1.3 ROMS to call into a bank of
  Telebit Worldblazers modems.

  The Telebits have been one of the more troublesome cases. So the
  hope is that the experience here carries over elsewhere.

* The EXACT best initialization string he came up with is :

AT &F0 &F3 W1 L1 T N3 S37=9 S46=138 S48=0


* His comments are:

  " I get a 9600 baud, LAP-M, V.42BIS connection with the local
  Telebits Worldblazers.  Unfortunately, it seems to be somewhat
  unstable.  My modem ready light sometimes turns off and then
  carrier is lost.  I presume that something (line noise maybe)
  forced the modems to go into a recallabration of features, and
  that that bombs.  Basically, while the modem seems workable at
  9600 buad over the lines with Telebits modems, it is still not
  reliable."


* Explanation of elements in the string (for purposes of further
  experimentation):

&F0 &F3 - starts with factory defaults doing both &F0 and &F3
           MIGHT be overboard but who knows!
W1     - So modem reports what type of connection we get!
L1     - Just a low speaker volume control, I prefer loud myself
T      - Use touch tone dialing. (Personal preference)
N3     - This forces the modem to use the speed specified by
         register S38 when originating a call.
         I suspect N5 (the default) may not work since it allows
         fallbacks (i.e. the 4800 people usually get).
         I suspect that N0  (thats "N" and the number 0) might
         help This forces the speed to be specified by register
         S37 for both the originating and answering cases. This
         might be needed for when a Telebit calls a Linelink. It
         may also help when the Telebit asks to renegotiate the
         connection.
           Lets see if this helps the carrier drop problems.
           (I don't know!)
S48=0  - disables v42, v42bis feature negotiation.
S46=138- forces v42bis compression. s46=138 is the default so
         this is redundant. (Doug tried S46=136, i.e. no v42bis
         compression and it didn't help or hurt, so the
         compression itself looks like its not the problem but
         perhaps only the feature negotiation)
S37=9  - forces a maximum 9600bps connection.
         Trying S37=11 (i.e. a 14000K connection) DID NOT WORK!
         However if the above string works for you go ahead and
         try S37=11 at least once. It may work differently with
         N0 command even. (S37=10 is PROBABLY an illegal value).

  In THEORY I think the string that might be better is

AT &F &C1 W1 N0 S7=60 S10=30 S37=9 S48=0

  that SHOULD give a 9600 (v32), LAPM (v42), v42bis connection. If
  that works try:

AT &F &C1 W1 N0 S7=60 S10=30 S37=11 S48=0

  that SHOULD give a 14400 (v32bis), LAPM (v42), v42bis connection.
  Also you can add any personal preferences to the string like L2.

  Now for the rational on those choices. I already explained why N0
  should be tried. S7=60 gives more time to get initial connection /
  carrier. S10=30 gives more tolerence for longer periods of bad
  carrier. &C1   just lets the light on the modem tell you when
  carrier is lost.



  We need feedback on these settings!!  Tell me how they work or
  don't!


  The following are a typical crossection of cases, I am including
  these to see if anyone else brighter than I am can see some
  patterns or has some good ideas!


* Case 1: Mike Markzon  MARKZON%HWS.bitnet@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
  The problem I have is that when I try to connect to BBS's that use
  Zoom brand 14.4 modems I am only able to connect at 4800. I have
  tried to force the connection using the init string AT &Q5 S37=11
  N0. No connection takes place when I use this.

* Case 2: courtn@cs.uregina.ca
  When I connect to US Robotics, I don't seem to have much of a
  problem. I always seem to get a solid 14.4 connection, with no
  retraining or anything. With Zoom's, I connect at
  4800/ARQ/LAPM/V42BIS, and I stay at 4800, no retraining happens.
  (It is a solid 4800 connection though. I get no errors and don't
  lose carrier or anything like that). I've know some other
  LineLinker's have this problem too, but on the flipside of the
  coin, many LineLinker's connect with Supra's and other modems
  flawlessly, and absolutely love their LineLink's. In fact, there's
  was a thread on the Supra Fido echo about this very problem. One
  sysop (who has a Supra) had two callers (who had LineLinks) that
  had problems connecting (same problem's I have), but he also had 4
  other users with LineLinks that had no problems connecting. And
  they were all using the same init string and had the same config!
  Anyway, I've found a kind of half-assed solution to the problem.
  If, after I connect, I go to command mode (with the 3 plusses),
  then do a ATO1  (which tells the modem to return to data mode and
  initiate equalizer retrain equalizer sequence), I seem to get a
  solid 14.4 connection after that.

* Case 3: I.Orchard@irl.cri.nz (Ian Orchard)
  After a series of disasters with Linelink 144e modems, I'm
  wondering if I should bail out. I'm on to my 4th sample and it
  still won't raise it's carrier speed higher than 4800 baud when
  communicating with First Class or ARA. Comms with Zterm sometimes
  manage higher speeds but it's spasmotic. A small test file that
  other 144 modems (even other LineLinks) transfer in 15secs or
  thereabouts, takes me 45sec. I have tried different Macs,
  different software, different locations. No luck. (Sample #1 did
  have a different problem)

* Case 4: Similiar unknown modem. awaji@gokumi.j.kisarazu.ac.jp
  (AWAJI Yoshimasa)

* Case 5: Chris Riker  CHRSRIKER@AOL.COM
  AOL tech support says that the LineLinks are having problems in
  some cities. They suggested I call D.C. where they know there are
  no Microcom modems. The connection was all I hoped it would be
  (except the long distance charges!). I belive the AOL people in
  that my LineLink is having trouble connecting with SprintNet's
  Microcom modems. Is there anybody else whose had problems wit
  Microcom modems? How did you get around it (strings please....)? I
  had a Microcom QX v.32 once and it did not like at all dealing
  with the v.42 query tone from any modem. I eventually got rid of
  it, cause it would just stop negotiating if v.42 even asked it if
  it had it. Wonderful   piece of work that...

  Using my LineLink 144e, I have called and connected to the Telebit
  T3000 on the Sun workstation at work. For security reasons, we
  have set the T3000 to callback the appropriate person after their
  password is entered. Thus, after being queried for my password and
  typing in the appropriate response, the T3000 hangs up and then
  tries to call me. I have tried both automatic and manual methods
  to answer the incoming call using both Zterm 0.9 and Microphone
  Pro and it seems that a link is never established with the T3000.
  I have tried linking up at 2400, 9600 and 14400 and haven't been
  able to make a link even though I have no problem establishing
  links on outgoing calls. My partner at work also purchased a
  LineLink 144e and has the same problem (outgoing calls connect,
  incoming calls don't). We haven't tried linking up our modems to
  each other yet but that will be tried. [By the way, I don't see
  this problem with my SupraFAXModem.]

* Case 8: murchison@psu.edu (Penn state)
  Here at Penn State, we are experiencing problems between the
  LineLink  and out Telebit T3000 modems.  For reasons yet
  determined we cannot  establish LAPM and/or V.42bis connections,
  and the LineLink falls back  to MNP(1-4, 5).  We do not want MNP
  to be used with the PPP dialup  service and users should enter the
  following command to ensure that MNP  does not get enabled:
  AT&F3\N5%C0  We are currently looking into a solution so that

  of LAPM/V.42bis connections  with the Telebit T3000's.

Power Supply/ FCC license
-------------------------
  The LineLink itself is in a plastic case so is more prone to RF
  noise than a modem in a metal case. The modem itself only has a
  FCC Class A license as opposed to a Class B rating. (Apparently
  this means commercial rather than residential use. )

  Keeping the modem away from other devices is a reasonable
  precaution though so far I personally have had no trouble in that
  area.

  The included power supply "brick" is a 120 volt AC input to 9 Volt
  AC, 1 amp, 15 watts output transformer.  Its UL listed , however
  one person reported that his power supply burned up (literally!).

  One person in Norway used a 9 volt DC, 300 milliAmp transformer.
  The modem responded to commands but the MR and CD light went out
  when the modem went off hook. Some people think the power supply
  is too weak, given that the modem works at all this grossly
  underpowered, this is probably just a wild conjecture at this
  moment.  No one has reported substituting a higher amperage power
  supply.



  Interference and RF noise could easily occur with any transformer
  so the idea that placing the transformer far away from other noise
  sources might help is again reasonable.

  People have cited following problems

* Modem stops working when nearby appliance turns on/off.

* Modem MR light goes off and stays off , or just flickers.

* AM station are being played over modem speaker.

* LineLink causes interference with television.

  The above examples represent real hardware problems. Specifically
  overloaded wall outlets with power spikes and RF noise. Plugging
  your LineLink into good noise/surge suppresser might help but
  garbage in garbage out still applys.  On my Linelink it has a 2200
  microfarad capacitor on the circuit board which was much larger
  than I expected which is good!

  If the MR light goes off for short periods of time (i.e. a few
  seconds say every few minutes) don't worry too much. Otherwise
  start thinking about where you might be getting noise and do
  something about it.


NOISE ON PHONE LINES
--------------------
  People have reported that :

* Modem works with v42bis connections but not MNP

* Modem won't work over phone lines with appletalk on other phone
  line pair.

* Rewiring phone cable fixes problems.

* Long distance calls unreliable.

  Usually these symptoms are accompanied with the MR light going on
  and off.

  Some of the problems may be associated with the 1.3 version of the
  ROMS.


  The majority of "noise" problems seem to be poor software setup.
  Some "noise" problems seem to be incompatible modems on other end.
  Some seem to be real problems with the modems. The Linelink seems
  to be similiar to other modems near its price in handling noise.
  It may be slightly below average.



  Keep in mind there is a lot of noise and very limited bandwidth on
  many existing telephone lines. Note that ISDN will help in the
  future making present modems obsolete. Some telephone companies
  are now digitally compressing (lossy) so they can cram more calls
  into the available bandwidth while claiming better sound quality.
  This essentially translates into more (effective) noise from the
  modems point of view.

  The LineLink is MUCH better than a conventional 2400 bps modem or
  even a 9600 bps modem without V.42 error correction in its ability
  to handle noise on the phone line. All high speed modems are
  sensitive to noise, its only a matter of degree.

  On my modem I have successfully transferred data even when I pick
  up the portable phone and keep it off the hook. It retrains (MR
  light goes off and modems renegotiates, MR light comes back on).
  It then transfers at a slower rate. If I talk into the phone too
  long it will disconnect. This is exactly what it should do. I have
  even used it during lightning storms (Yeah I know I shouldn't do
  that!).


  Bottom line is if you are using average or better phone lines and
  don't expect miracles you should be quite happy.

  Noisy lines MAY give trouble. Avoid this modem if you do much long
  distance, unless you plan on buying , trying it and returning it
  if you are not satisfied. (Most people ARE satisfied)



Cables and Hardware Handshaking
-------------------------------
  Your modem "talks" to your modem at the serial port "DTE" speed
  typically 19200, 38400 or 57600bps set in your terminal program.
  Your modem then "talks" over the phone line to the remote modem at
  the "DCE" speed (typically 14400bps but compression can
  effectively increase the useful speed) and finally the remote
  modem can talk to the remote computer at a possible different
  "DTE" speed.

  Handshaking is a method for the modem to tell the computer to stop
  sending data to it or the other way around. Its needed because at
  the modems and computers are transfering data at different speeds.
  Note its not NEEDED at 9600bps and below though it sure helps.

  Imagine, a road ending at a river with a ferry crossing.  If the
  traffic on the road is light and slow so the ferry always makes it
  across in time for the next car you don't need a gate, or a stop
  sign or stop light for traffic!  If its heavy or fast traffic or
  if the ferry operators go out for lunch you better have one, or
  the cars will end up in the river!

  Software control has the computer and modem sends the DC1 and DC3
  characters and is called XON/XOFF flow control. Software control
  is less reliable than hardware flow control and also those two
  characters can't be used for other purposes.

  The analogy above would be stop lights and a gate at the ferry
  crossing are hardware flow control and stop signs are software
  flow control. Both serve the same purpose but stop lights and a
  gate are clearly better than stop signs in both speed and safety.

  Modern software allows you to use hardware flow control and there
  is little reason to use software flow control if you have an
  option. Unfortunately you may NOT have an option with some
  software. In any case hardware flow control uses two pins on the
  modem, CTS and RTS.


  The CTS pin on the modem is used to output a signal to the
  computer to indicate if the modem is ready or not to receive data.
  Since the modem is normally MUCH slower than the computer serial
  port at sending data this flow control is almost ESSENTIAL at
  speeds above 9600. This type of hardware flow control is called
  CTS hardware flow control.

  The computer outputs a signal that is received on the modem's RTS
  pin. This is used to indicate if the computer is ready to send or
  receive data. This type of hardware flow control is called RTS
  hardware flow control. Its not quite so critical as the CTS
  hardware flow control since computers are much faster than modems.
  However the computer may be busy doing something else and not have
  time available to get the data before it overruns the buffers.

  For data connections always use CTS and RTS flow control if
  available. However for Fax the situation is a bit trickier. The
  following information is from several sources:

> During fax mode, the DTE-DCE port speed is 19200 bps.
> The DCE provides a speed buffer of 1024 bytes and provides
> DC1/DC3 (XON/XOFF) or RTS/CTS method of controlling the data
> into the buffer.  This flow control is controlled by AT&K3 or
> AT&K4 command. This method of data low control is available only
> for DTE to DCE direction of data. There is no provision for data
> flow control from  DCE to DTE.

  In english, DTE to DCE data means Mac to Modem data. This means
  the modem can signal the Mac to stop (via CTS or XON/XOFF). RTS
  isn't being used for flow control contrary to what the term
  "RTS/CTS method" might indicate. So for faxes in fax mode the RTS
  pin is not functional. This factoid will be important as we
  discuss hardware hangup later on the Macintosh.


  The modem also has a pin called DTR that can be set to hangup the
  modem (via command &D2) when its activated or go into command mode
  or other neat stuff.


  On a PC, Amiga, or Unix box you connect the RTS pin on the
  computer to the RTS pin on the modem, the CTS pin on the computer
  to the CTS pin on the modem, DTR to DTR etc etc.  Thats just a
  standard RS232 serial cable. Usually just called a  PC modem
  cable. PC users should just use factory defaults and add &D2&C1 in
  their init strings and set hardware handshaking, hardware hangup,
  hardware carrier detect, etc all ON in their programs.  But keep
  reading anyways if you use a Mac or bought a Linelink sold for use
  in the Macintosh market.


  On the Mac things are a bit of a mess (PC users don't gloat yet,
  at least we don't have to replace UART chips!) In 1984, Steve Jobs
  chose to use a subset of the RS422 standard when the Mac was first
  introduced and a nonstandard 9 pin connector (DB9). Macs since the
  MacPlus use a still weirder 8 pin mini-din connector (or a
  backwards compatable 8 +1  mini-din connector on AV's , PowerPCs
  and newer Quadras).  The names of the handshaking pins on a Mac
  are now called HSKout and HSKin (Handshake in and out). HSKout
  stands for handshaking out,  HSKin stands for handshaking in. In
  full hardware handshaking HSKout is used for RTS flow control and
  HSKin is used for CTS flow control.


  On the original Mac 128, 512K, and 512KE only have the HSKout
  (CTS) pin for handshaking. Later with the advent of the MacPlus
  the RTS pin was added.  Early documentation from Apple (i.e. the
  MacPlus) called the HSKout pin on the MACINTOSH side the DTR pin.
  The reason for that was that old 1200 and 2400bps modem cables
  used that pin to connect to the DTR pin on the modem side for
  hanging up the phone. RTS handshaking wasn't used at all at that
  time since the fastest speed you would ever likely use at the time
  was 9600bps.   That same HSKout pin is NOW being used for RTS flow
  control on a modern modem. So some old (and not so old!) software
  will refer to RTS handshaking as DTR handshaking!  Yes its
  confusing, which is probably why apple changed the names to HSKout
  and HSKin.

  A correctly wired Hardware Handshaking Cable for a Macintosh is as
  follows.(Apple Recommended)  Zterm manual and the Apple Modem Tool
  have nicer pictures.

  The above cable has no real disadvantages **IRREGARDLESS** of what
  modem you are using. It has many advantages which is why Apple has
  recommended this cable for years.



  Modem 20(DTR) pin ON the modem is used to hang-up the modem and/or
  go into command mode.  Pin 20 MUST obviously be hooked up to have
  hardware hang-up of the modem work. At any given time IF the modem
  is setup correctly and you have a cable like above or equivalent,
  you can use either RTS flow control or hardware hangup but not
  both.


  Software hangup works just fine 99% of the time so hardware hangup
  is VERY optional. RTS flow control is much more important in most
  situations so use it!


  Hard and fast rules on the Macintosh for data calls.

* You can always use &D0 in the init string (the default) and
  software hangups.

* If you use either &D1,&D2,&D3 then you must use &K0 (no flow
  control) or &K4 (software flow control) or corresponding /Q
  commands when using data calls.

* If you use &K3 (the default) then you MUST use &D0 (the default).

  Generally the simplest way to work is to set the modem to always
  ignore DTR (AT&D0 which is the default anyways) for data calls and
  always use CTS and RTS flow control. And always use software
  hang-up to hang up the phone. (See section "Escaping, Software
  Hangup and TIES" ) If you do this then fact pin 20 is hooked up is
  immaterial (and why it is labeled optional above).


  For faxing, since RTS is ignored the rules change slightly. &D2 is
  quite safe in fax mode until you return to data mode.  Also
  because the DTE (serial port) speeds are 19200 or less for fax
  Xon/Xoff flow control isn't so bad. Some fax software also doesn't
  do hardware flow control.


  So far the above applies to ANY high speed modem on the Mac. The
  problem is the serial ports on the Mac, not the modem.



  Now here is where it gets interesting in terms of the LineLink.
  There is a big mix up of cables, modems and misinformation.

  For unknown reasons Prometheus generally sends out modems sold for
  the Macintosh market with pins 4 and 20 jumpered and a cable with
  only pin 4 or pin 20 connected. Thats equivalent to the apple
  recommended cable for purposes of using it on a Mac but bad news
  if you want to use your Mac modem on a PC or use the Prometheus
  supplied cable with another modem even a Linelink sold for the PC
  market.



  There are at least 3 correct but different Mac to Modem cables
  that were shipped with the LineLink.  At least 2 wrong styles
  also. Two "correct" cables require an internal jumper to be in the
  modem.  I suspect that modems that shipped after roughly DEC 15
  1993 will have the jumper. The jumper is reported to be blue but I
  strongly recommend you look carefully before messing with your
  modem, they may not all be BLUE! Instead use an ohmmeter to
  determine what the jumper does. If you don't know how you
  shouldn't be doing the modification!


  The first cable I received was wired exactly as above except the
  Mac GPi pin was not connected to modem (DCD) pin. This is only a
  very minor inconvenience except when the modem is used unattended.

  The second cable I received did not have the modem DTR pin hooked
  up. This second type of cable seems most common of those people
  who actually checked the wiring (though this may be biased
  sample). This is an OK cable if hardware hang-up is NOT used (i.e.
  default &D0). Its fine on most LineLinks that have internal jumper
  installed (see later). Do NOT use this cable on other modems if
  you want to use hardware hangup!

  The third type of cable that has been reported to me is one where
  the modem RTS pin isn't hooked up but DTR is. This type of cable
  is real bad news!!! Yes it works fine on LineLinks with internal
  jumpers but it won't on LineLinks without the jumper or almost any
  other modem. Do NOT use this cable on other high speed modems!




  Thats the actual observations. The following info is summary of
  info received from Milt Sagen at Prometheus.

  In my case my modem has "LineLink 14.4" on the label on the bottom
  of modem case. It should not have the jumper. Its factory default
  is &R0 not &R1 as the manual states.

From the manual
  &R0  PC Mode. DTR and RTS signals function normally.
  &R1  Mac Mode. When the modem is configured for bi-directional
  RTS/CTS flow control (&K3 or \Q3) the DTR signal is recognized as
  RTS by the modem. DTR and RTS signals function normally with all
  other &K or \Q settings.

  **ACTUALLY** &R0 and &R1 are equivalent , i.e. they both do
  nothing (Milt Sagen from Prometheus). Official word from
  Prometheus (Mark Smith) is "At this point, the &R command is not
  an implemented command.  It is one of those things that they
  planned to put in and so the documentation refers to the command -
  but the modem does not actually respond to this command in the
  manner described."


  Bottom line is that if you have a modem with label LineLink 14.4
  (Mac) on bottom any of the above cables should work since you
  should have the jumper internally. If you want to use the LineLink
  with a PC , then buy the PC version from MicroWarehouse and buy a
  cable built to Apple specs for your mac. (Your PC software
  definitely won't like the jumper ). If you have one of the
  earliest LineLinks then check your cable.

  Now to provide a speculative (but educated) guess as to the
  problems. The CBL-06 cable may have mac pin 1 to mac pin 20 (DTR)
  but rest like Apple recommends. Any one care to confirm? ASSUME
  CBL-06 cables were ordered with the intent that &R would be
  implemented and default set at &R1 (as per manual). ASSUME the
  cables were wired with Mac (HSKout)  ->  20(DTR). Which would have
  worked if &R1 were implemented. Now the cables and the modems went
  out without &R1 implemented some other cables (CBL-10 etc) were
  sent out with this first batch of modems. People who received
  CBL-06 cables couldn't use Hardware handshaking since RTS wasn't
  hooked up. (Ouch!!). ASSUME Prometheus has a ton of CBL-06 cables
  in the warehouse, they start manufacturing LineLinks with the
  internal jumper connected i.e. "LineLink 14.4 (MAC)" these
  LineLinks work as they should with CBL-06 (or CBL-10 or ZOOM).
  All's great except for the old stock with "LineLink 14.4" which
  gets mixed up.

End speculation , back to facts.



  If the modem works and connects with another modem with init
  string AT&F&Q0, NO handshaking and terminal program set at 9600
  bps at speeds up to an including 9600 bps, then the modem is
  probably OK. Also do the self tests mentioned elsewhere.

  If at 19200 bps and AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60  as the init string if it
  doesn't connect and stay connected using hardware handshaking then
  suspect a bad cable and a good modem

  Prometheus was good about trying to get this straightened out, it
  was a real mess the first two months   It actually dragged out far
  longer than it should have however.  To be fair most modem
  manufacturers seem to get this wrong at least periodically and
  most sales droids in apple dealers are clueless and will sell you
  any cable that looks the same. Its a common , common problem!

Escaping, Software Hangup and TIES
----------------------------------

  Escaping is the process of making the modem going into command
  mode to accept modem commands when the modem is actually in data
  mode (i.e. transferring files etc).

  In order not to accidentally trigger some nasty behavior in
  Linelinks and other TIES modems,  I am going to write three pluses
  +++ as + + +, i.e. with spaces.  This is only so the file can be
  easily uploaded, don't include spaces when typing.

  Using the notation in the manual:

  <CR> represents the carriage return (or enter) key.
         (ASCII code 13, Control M)
  <GT> represents a guard time which is a delay before and after the
  escape sequence. The guard time is stored in register S12 in 50th
  of a second.  Hayes standard has 1 Second (S12=50). LineLink has
  S12=40 by default. You can reset S12 to 50 if you like.  Note that
  the S-register info on S12 given in the document on the Prometheus
  BBS contradicts the manual on the behavior of the second guard
  time.


  The Hayes standard escape sequence "<GT>+ + +<GT>" lets you return
  to command mode without breaking your connection with a remote
  modem. So to escape you wait a second or two, type three pluses
  then wait a second or two. You will then see an OK (unless you
  were already in command mode to start!)

  The Linelink also uses a second method of escaping called **Time
  Independent Escape Sequence** (TIES) that consists of
           + + +AT<CR>
  typed at any speed with anything before or after it.

  It would be **IMPOSSIBLE** to upload this file with a Linelink if
  the TIES string in it because it would make the modem go in
  command mode! In other words if you are trying to transfer a file
  that "happens" to have this sequence of 6 ASCII characters it will
  stop in mid transfer. The program you are using is then likely to
  hang (because it still thinks the modem is in data mode).  This is
  dangerous behavior. There is no warning and if it happens on a
  file it happens each and every time. To be fair the half life is
  gigabytes of random ASCII data before you would expect to trigger
  the behavior. But real data is not random! None of this behavior
  is really that important in practice. Just be aware of the remote
  danger. Ignoring Hayes propaganda test files and documents on
  modems you are unlikely to trigger the behavior accidentally with
  real data. Avoid getting in the habit of using this second method
  of escaping since its also nonstandard.

  Rumor has it that TIES was created to avoid paying Hayes a royalty
  (3% of modem price according to a Hayes employee) on the patent it
  holds. For more details, look at the July 1993 issue of Byte ,
  page 184. "Escape sequences ..."


  Two nice things about TIES are that the escape sequence gets you
  the OK response message even if you start out in command mode,
  also the sequence is quick so that you don't have to wait very
  long.


  Do the following sequence for normal software Hangup
   1) Wait a second or two
   2) type + + +
   3) wait a second or two
   4) Type ATH then the return key.

  The notation that is used in the manual for this is
      <GT>+ + +<GT>ATH<CR>

  The Linelink is the only modem I have heard of that uses both the
  TIES and Hayes escape methods. It seems it produces some quirks!
  My experiments with the LineLink using Zterm produce the
  following. With S12=200 (the default value of 50 is too fast for
  me to type and be sure I am doing it right!), I got the following
  behavior

+ + +AT<CR>  escapes largely independent of where and when EXCEPT

+ + + +AT<CR>  doesn't escape.

+<GT>+ + +<GT>  doesn't escape either!


  The Linelink then has truly weird behavior when doing combinations
  involving four pluses in a row. That means the Linelinks will
  escape when other modems would not escape (TIES) and will NOT
  escape in other situations that other modems would (four pluses in
  a row).


Setting up your linelink for the first time!
============================================

  Obviously plug every thing in like the manual shows. The phone
  line from your wall goes in the LINE phone socket not the PHONE
  socket. (Easy to do when you aren't looking at the back!) Turn on
  the power etc.

  Load any communication program. If needed install your
  communication program(s) including any needed resources.

  When you first get your modem, do the following commands. Redo
  these commands if your modem "Misbehaves" for no apparent reason.

  If you are using a Commtoolbox based program (Like Communicate
  Lite or ClarisWorks or Sitcomm). Select the Serial Tool and NOT
  the Apple Modem Tool for these commands. Open a connection. (Which
  is now letting you "talk" directly to the modem I hope!) Other
  communication programs not based on the Commtoolbox will normally
  "talk" directly to the modem.

 AT&F0
 AT&F3
 AT&W0
 AT&W1
 AT&Y0

  The command ATZ resets the modem.  It resets data settings based
  on non-volatile memory settings. It does NOT reset all Fax and
  voice settings but it does reset some.  Furthermore it does NOT
  necessarily restore data factory defaults unless you do the above
  procedure.  The commands &F , &F0 and &F3 resets the active
  profile to factory defaults. Prometheus says they are identical
  but it pays to be paranoid at least once. AT&W0 and AT&W1 save the
  active profile to the two permanent storage locations
  (non-volatile memory) so next time you power on your modem (or use
  command ATZ) you will be at factory settings automatically. AT&Y0
  selects the first non-volatile memory settings as the default on
  next power up.

  **DO THE ABOVE OR YOU MAY REGRET IT!!** You have been warned!!




  The command AT&V will display the present settings. For reference
  on my modem at 57600 bps  (which was purchased in Sept. 93) at&v
  gives the following  for the ACTIVE PROFILE ( slightly reformatted
  to fit)

ACTIVE PROFILE: B1 E1 L2 M1 N1 P Q0 V1 W0 X4 Y0 &C0 &D0 &G0 &J0 &K3
&L0 &P0 &Q5 &R0 &S0 &T4 &U0 &X0 &Y0 \C0 \G0 \Q3 \T000 \V1 \X0 %A000
%D2 %E1 S00:000 S02:043 S03:013 S04:010 S05:008 S06:002 S07:040
S08:002 S09:006 S10:014 S11:075 S12:040 S14:AAH S16:00H S18:000
S21:00H S22:76H S23:11H S25:005 S26:001 S27:49H S36:007 S37:000
S38:020 S46:138 S48:007 S49:010 S50:200 S63:000 S82:128


  There are some differences between shipping modems, you can
  compare it with the manual defaults, &R0 is commonly different as
  well as \V1.  Don't worry if you have &R1 instead. If \V0 is your
  default then anywhere you see &F in this FAQ use &F\V1. I will NOT
  include it since the vast majority of modems are set at \V1.

  You ~can~ subsitute &F plus your personal preferences for the
  default settings above. Specifically to reset with ~my~ personal
  preferences try the following


 ATZ
 AT&F\V1&C1W1L3
 AT&F0\V1&C1W1L3
 AT&F3\V1&C1W1L3
 AT&W0
 AT&W1
 AT&Y0

  where the reasons why I chose the string &C1W1L3 is explained
  elsewhere in the FAQ. S7=60 would be included also but isn't saved
  to nonvolatile memory on the Linelink.


Testing Your LineLink
---------------------
  How to test your modem . Most of Procedure is from tech support
  First this is a very incomplete test. If it fails send the cable
  AND modem back. If it passes you still may have a bad cable or
  more rarely a bad modem . First follow procedure in section
  "Setting up your linelink for the first time"

  Use provided Mac to modem cable. Turn power on Modem , Mac etc.
  You need not plug in phone line to do test. Start up terminal
  program.

  If you are using a Commtoolbox based program (Like Communicate
  Lite or ClarisWorks or Sitcomm). Select the Serial Tool and NOT
  the Apple Modem Tool. Open a connection. (Which is now letting you
  "talk" directly to the modem I hope!) Other communication programs
  not based on the Commtoolbox will normally "talk" directly to the
  modem.

  Set your terminal software to 9600 bps (or lower). 14400 bps won't
  work at all. 19200 will work on some of this but not all.  Don't
  enable hardware or software flow control in your software. {Should
  work with flow control but if your cable is miswired it will
  complicate the test of the modem }

The test procedure is shown below.

  I added some comments and put prompts "You>" and "Modem>" in.
  Don't type "You>" and "Modem>" or the comments.  + + + should be
  typed without spaces and a short delay before and after it. Type
  in carriage returns on input.
    You> Means you type the stuff that follows.
  Modem> Means the modem responds with this line.
  !      Means this is a comment I added to clarify what is going
  on.

  Excluding prompts and comments this is exactly what happened on
  mine (at 9600 bps)

  You>ATZ             !resets modem as if it was turned off
Modem>OK
  You>AT&F3           !loads factory default settings
Modem>OK
  You>AT&F            !loads factory default settings
Modem>OK
  You>AT&Q0           !This puts it in asynchrous mode.
Modem>OK
  You>AT S18=0        !Should be redundant
Modem>OK
  You>AT&T8           !Self test. Modem flashes MR light.
  You>+ + + AT&T      !escape + + + (No spaces) Turn self test off.
Modem>000             !000 means zero errors were detected.
Modem>OK
You  >AT&T1           !Another test where it echos what you type
Modem>CONNECT 9600
You  >This is stuff I typed in. + + +
                      ! Should echo everything you type until you
                      ! escape with + + + (No spaces)
Modem>OK
 You >AT&T            !Turn self test off.
Modem>OK
  You>AT&F            ! Just putting it back to factory defaults
Modem>OK

Typical Session
---------------

  The following is Hayes BBS's phone number which is obviously a
  good place to call to test your modem.  Please do try local phone
  numbers first and read some of Hayes advertising out of courtesy.

   Hayes BBS (800-874-2937).



  I used zterm, with hardware flow control on. Hardware hangup OFF.
  bps rate set to 57600 (try 19200 or 38400 on a slow mac). Here is
  EXACTLY as it appears on the Hayes BBS as I dialed in.

AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60

OK

ATDT 18008742937

CARRIER 14400

PROTOCOL: LAP-M

COMPRESSION: V.42BIS

CONNECT 57600

  Note we have a LAP-M error correction and V.42BIS compression .
  The carrier is 14400 which means we have v32bis. The connection
  between my Mac and modem is 57600 (which is what I set it to).  If
  you get different responses above it is very likely that the modem
  on the other end doesn't support one of the above standards, or is
  not set up correctly.


  Know what you are dialing into.  If you get a 9600 bps connection
  on a modem that someone claims to be 14.4K , maybe the modem on
  the other end doesn't use V32bis but an older proprietary format.
  Flow control problems at EITHER end often allow connections at
  lower speeds and unreliable connections at high speeds. As 28.8K
  modems become more common though who knows!






Basic Data Communication Software Setup on the Macintosh
========================================================

Intoduction and Background
--------------------------

  First read section about setting up your LineLink for the first
  time. In both the manual and this FAQ. Then precede.   Be **sure**
  to start from factory defaults. You did read the above section
  "Setting Up your LineLink for the first time" right? Also remember
  some programs mess with your nonvolatile modem settings so it pays
  to be paranoid.


  Any mac can handle 19200 bps comfortably (EVEN the 128, 512,
  512KE). Even a MacPlus can comfortably handle 57600 bps if using
  finder, no appletalk on, disk cache below 128K etc.  So start with
  19200 bps and move up if everything works.



* In programs there is generally a dialog box that lets you input a
  string that is sent to initialize the modem. Call this the init
  string.  You may have to type the string manually. Generally the
  string that works and gives you what you want is

AT&F

  a better string is

AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60

  &F  MUST be FIRST in the string after the AT.  (ESSENTIAL)
  W1  Gives more detailed info on the connection especially error
      control and compression.  May confuse very old and stupid
      programs that just look for CARRIER instead of NO CARRIER.
      but not very likely.  (VERY VERY useful)
  L3  Turns up the volume to highest level. (L2 is default, Very
      Optional)
  &C1 Makes the carrier detect light on modem do exactly that.
      More and more programs can also detect carrier (on the GPi
      pin) Hence its used (or needed) in some modern programs.
      For older programs its ignored.  In any case its helpful and
    can't hurt NO reason not to use it, I ALWAYS do

S7=60 means modem has 60 seconds when calling out to get
      a valid carrier before hanging up.  The default is 40
      seconds. My LineLink connects in about 17 seconds after the
      other modem answers the call so 40 seconds is usually
      enough. 60 seconds eliminates many problems and adds no new
      ones. (ESSENTIAL for some people). For international FAX
      calls S7=120 is suggested.
      Linelink documents indicate 60 is maximum, 90 seems to work
      but be conservative and try 60 before trying 90.


* Often the program needs a "Modem Reset" string. I generally use
  the same string as above possibly with H at the end to hangup.
  You can use ATZ (or ATZ1, ATZ2) but it **may** introduces problems
  in Fax or Voice. Some Fax and Voice settings are reset by ATZ and
  a few are NOT. You can end up in very unstable situation.



* If the program needs a "Hangup string" just use ATH.


  Also be aware some programs DON'T want the AT in the string (i.e.
  they put the AT in by default). Look at an example in the software
  manual.


* You want hardware handshaking enabled for both input and output.
  CTS handshaking is output hardware handshaking. RTS is input
  hardware handshaking. A few programs call this DTR handshaking
  (UGH).  If the program just has a setting called hardware flow
  control its about a 50/50 chance whether its CTS only or both CTS
  and RTS handshaking. The point is that ALL available hardware flow
  control should always be used IF available.

  One exception is on the Mac 128K, 512K and 512KE there is no
  HSKout pin so you can't use RTS handshaking on those models.
  (Actually you can still set it but since the pin isn't there so it
  has no effect). People have reported running at 57600bps with a
  512KE even with this handicap.

* Don't use SOFTWARE handshaking (also known as XON/XOFF flow
  control) unless Hardware Handshaking is NOT available.  Add &K4 to
  init string of the offending program and use XON/XOFF flow control
  in software, in zmodem protocol use the "escape control
  characters" option. Now pray because you will need help for this
  to work reliably.

* Don't use both software (Xon/XOFF) and hardware handshaking !!!

* Don't use hardware hangup to hang up the phone for data calls  use
  software hangup. (Might be called DTR hangup or such) Yes, DTR is
  used for two different things which is why there is such a mess on
  the Mac. (Apple also renamed the pinouts a couple of times!) A lot
  of people/software include &D1, &D2, &D3 etc in init string these
  are all some form of hardware hangup using the DTR pin. The mac
  output pin is being used for the RTS pin so its not available when
  doing high speed transfers! (&D2 is OK in the Fax software itself
  but don't use it in your high speed data programs!).




  Generally if there is an option for hardware hangup the software
  already knows how to hangup with software so just turn off
  hardware hangup and don't go messing with the &D commands, leave
  it at the default of &D0! To manually use software hangup see
  section "Escaping, Software Hangup and TIES"





If you get garbage on your screen after the other modem answers
---------------------------------------------------------------

  Double check to see if hardware handshaking is being used.

  Double check the parity etc. used in terminal emulator /comm
  program.

  Most computer systems use 8 data bits , 1 stop bit and no parity.

  IBM mainframes commonly used 7 data bits  and even parity.

  Check to see if your terminal type is correct.

  Generally Unix systems will use either VT52,  VT100, textronix
  etc. If you are calling an IBM-PC or most bulletin board systems
  generally either TTY or ANSI or ANSI graphics will be the
  appropriate terminal type.


  The voice mode does this also so try turning the modem off and
  disabling the voice software and see if that fixes your problems.






More exotic data settings
-------------------------
  Some people prefer to use W2 instead of W1. This could confuse
  some dumb programs.  Programs that autobaud generally look at the
  connect speed as the DTE (Mac) speed which is the only relevant
  info for the serial port connection to work. W2 returns CONNECT
  14400 even if the DTE speed is 57600. W1 gives the most
  information. W0 gives the least confusing information from the Mac
  programs point of view,i.e. minimal information. W2 gives less
  information than W1 and a different interpretation of CONNECT. If
  W2 works in your software then go ahead and use it if you like it.
  Largely a personal taste issue.


  If you want to disable v42bis data compression while still using
  error correction add S46=136 to the string.  Using v42bis
  compression will NOT significantly slow down data transfers even
  when sending pre-compressed data. Only MNP compression has that
  problem.  Disabling compression is not recommended except in
  unusual situations. Since ARA uses MNP IN SOFTWARE its usually
  recommended that v42bis be disabled in that case. (That almost
  always done in the ARA script file so don't look for it in any
  dialog boxes!).

  Disabling v42 (error correction) is almost always a bad idea in my
  opinion.




  If your phone line is an old leased PBX system or some other weird
  system you may need to add S63=x where x=0 to 15 and represents
  how much to decrease the carrier output. The default is 0 and
  should be increased by 3's.  Very unlikely to be needed. This may
  be needed in countries other than the USA also.


  If you are in the United Kingdom or HongKong add  &P1 to the
  string. Have no idea what other countries this applies to!

  You could save these settings using AT&W0. For instance
AT&P1&FW1L3&C1 S46=136 S7=60
AT&W0
AT&Y0
  Would save personal settings appropriate for someone in the United
  Kingdom who dislikes compression. Note S7=60 still needs to be in
  any future init strings since S7 register is **NOT** saved in
  non-volatile memory on the LineLink.


  If you have a very noisy phone line you can add S10=30 to your
  init string. This allows up to  (30-6)/10 = 2.4 seconds of really
  bad noise before losing your connection. The default is 0.8
  seconds. Increase only if you must and only by as small amount as
  you can get away with!


  Check section "My Modem only doesn't connect at XXXX baud" on
  problems with version 1.3 ROMS and for examples of more detailed
  control of speed, error control and compression features.




Macintosh System Software
-------------------------

  Remember all software has bugs, until proven innocent!

  Inits/Extensions/cdevs can cause problems and slow the system
  down. Mouse , appletalk have higher priority than serial port.
  Hence activity there can cause trouble in downloading/uploading.
  So if possible turn off appletalk and all inits as well as
  networking software.

  If you are using system 6.x , use Finder instead of Multifinder.
  If you are using system 7.0 , try 7.0.1 with system tuner 1.1.1


  If you are using system 7.1

* Use a small disk cache less than or equal to 128K.  (Set it in
  memory control panel). There is a known bug in Apple's disk cache.
  Not fixed in hardware update 3.0.  This effects network software
  also.  They claim its fixed in System 7.5.

* Avoid virtual memory if possible.

* Use hardware update 3.0. which includes fixes for the serial port
  on some models.


  Generally , faster macs respond faster and have fewer problems.
  However, I have used a MacPlus by using system 6.05 under finder.
  The MacPlus is only 25% slower than a quadra 605 for downloads and
  uploads under favorable conditions.

  Are there any system 7.5 tricks??




How do I set up Macintosh Program "XXX" for the LineLink?
=========================================================

MacKnowledge
------------


  ** Warning!!!! MacKnowledge is not 32bit clean Warning!!!! **

* If you are using system 7 or later go to the memory control panel
  and turn off 32bit addressing!

* Install software as per instructions in manual. Start your Mac
  with extensions off (i.e. shift key held down if system 7.xx).

  Lots of people have been using the string that MacKnowledge auto
  configures for use in Macknowledge and other programs. **Come on
  people** look at the copyright (~1989!~) on the splash screen.

  Settings are under the "Phone" menu i.e selection "Modem Control
  and Configuration"

  On my modem after auto configuring MacKnowledge suggests
  ATL2M1X4Q0V0W1E1S0=0H0

  AT&FV0W1H0 would have done exactly the same thing and been much
  safer. V0 gives numeric responses which is what MacKnowledge
  REQUIRES which is unusual for modern software but common years
  ago.

  H0 hangs up, which isn't a bad idea to put in an init string but
  not a good idea if you switch between telecom programs on the same
  call. MacKnowledge suggests \N3\V1\Q3 for turning on error
  correction. N3 turns on MNP error correction but not V42 or LAPM.
  So real bad !!!

The right way to do it.

* First select Hardware Handshaking.

* Init string AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60 Nothing for either error string.

* If you want to be fancy
 \N6 for error control string
 \N0 for non error control string.

Actually why would you not want error control ?

Works fine even at 57600 bps.

  Not much good without zmodem protocol or commtoolbox features but
  it works fine as a terminal emulator and for xmodem transfers. Use
  this program to download other better communication programs such
  as zterm, TelefinderPro or Communicate Lite demo. Check out the
  Communicate Lite section especially. As of this writing Mark/Space
  was considering an agressively priced competitive upgrade to
  Communicate Lite for MacKnowledge owners.(Call for details).
  Competitive upgrades to other commercial software are Sitcomm
  ($45) and Microphone Pro 2.0 ($79). Also consider the shareware
  alternatives Zterm ($30 or $40) and Telefinder Pro ($15) which are
  quite good also but are not Comm Toolbox based.



ZTERM 0.9 or 1.0 beta
---------------------
  The zterm program and the zterm FAQ may be found on info-mac or
  umich archive mirrors as

/infomac/Communication/term/zterm-10b3.cpt
/infomac/Communication/info/zterm-faq-16.txt
/umich /mac/util/comm/zterm1.0b3.cpt.hqx


  as well as probably a zillion other places such as

<ftp://ftp.utexas.edu/pub/mac/comm/zterm-10b3.hqx>


  Zterm is a shareware terminal program that supports Xmodem,
  Ymodem, Zmodem file transfers. Automatic MacBinary format
  recognition. Very easy to use , highly reliable, good  (not
  excellent)terminal emulation. If you are going to use this read
  the manual and follow directions. Its a very good manual. Also get
  the zterm FAQ written by Leslie Jones. Between these two sources
  it covers most problems that can occur.



  For those of you who don't read manuals.
  Under the "Settings" menu select submenu "Connection" and do the
  following.
  TURN ON   Flow control: Hardware Handshaking
  TURN OFF  Flow control:  XON/XOFF flow
  Set bps to 57600 or 38400 (For a slow mac use 19200).

  Again under "Settings" menu select submenu "Modem Preferences"
  Set dial timeout to 60
  Turn OFF hardware hangup (DTR)

  So far everything was in the manual!


  For those who have hanging-up problems check what the "seconds to
  redial" box in the dialog which appears when dialing is done
  through the Dial menu, and if it is saying one or two seconds,
  then set it higher to say 5. BTW, you can still see the
  negotiation messages in Zterm if you manually dial using the ATDT
  command in the terminal window instead of using the dialout dialog
  box. Otherwise you won't see them.

  For initialization string.
          AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60^M
          AT&F^M  does work fine also but doesn't give you as much
          information.
  (the ^M is the way that zterm handles the return key)





  For deintialization string just use nothing. If you use MaxFax and
  want to experiment try AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60+FAA=1;+FCR 1 ^M If you use
  other Fax software or Apple Remote Access (ARA) and want to
  experiment try to duplicate its  FULL init string it wants.


  Fastest speed I have personally seen for compressable text files
  is
> 3000 bytes per second on MacPlus (2.5 Megs, System 6.05, Finder)
> 3400 bytes per second on a MacIIsi (5 Megs, System 7.01 tuned)
> 3800 bytes per second on Quadra 605 (6 Megs, System 7.1)

  For a compressed file the range is from 1200 bytes per second on
  the MacPlus to 1690 bytes per second on the Quadra.

  For binhexed compress files its rather disappointing i.e. the same
  as compressed files (it should be (8/6) times better i.e. 33%
  faster).

  The zterm faq and zterm manual cover most problems so read them.
  (Notice a pattern yet?)

  However one problem isn't covered and is common. If you are having
  trouble uploading to a unix system note the following.

NOTES from rz man page:

>  The Unix "ulimit" parameter must be set high enough to
>  permit large file transfers.
>  The TTY input buffering on some systems may not allow long
>  blocks or streaming input at high speed.  You should
>  suspect this problem when you can't send data to the Unix
>  system at high speeds using ZMODEM when YMODEM with 128
>  byte block works properly.  If the system's tty line
>  handling is really broken, the serial port or the entire
>  system may not survive the onslaught of long bursts of high
>  speed data.

  To fix the problem on the Unix end , buy the system administrator
  a dinner. In the mean time you can get it working but with VERY
  slow uploads. If you have this problem try Ymodem 128 byte
  protocal. If that works then go to the zmodem settings in zterm
  and set the window size to 128.  If that works then try 256, if
  that works then try 512 etc.





TelefinderUser TelefinderPro
----------------------------
  Telefinder-User is a FREE client to Telefinder Bulletin Board's.

  Telefinder-Pro is $15 shareware that is a client also and a fairly
  full featured terminal program.

  Both files may be found at

info-mac/comm/bbs/tele-finder-pro-222-to-223-updt.hqx
info-mac/comm/bbs/tele-finder-pro-222.hqx
info-mac/comm/bbs/tele-finder-tcp-host-demo.hqx
info-mac/comm/bbs/tele-finder-tcp-user.hqx
info-mac/comm/bbs/tele-finder-user-322.hqx


  Both programs have two default setting for the Linelink. Use the
  hardware handshaking setting i.e. " LineLink 144e-HH".  You access
  this in the Modem Port dialog (double click on the Modem Port
  icon). The settings are essentially &F.  You can customize it if
  you choose to &F&C1W1L3 or whatever.  The user interface is VERY
  professional, however it uses the same interface as the Mac's
  Finder. It MIGHT violate a lot of user interface rules. You will
  probably love it or hate it but probably nothing in between.


  While TelefinderPro ~appears~ to be much more sophisticated than
  zterm 0.9 or Communicate Lite its really not.   For instance,
  zmodem window size cannot be adjusted in Telefinder Pro, its also
  not comm toolbox based. Nevertheless TelefinderPro 2.2.2 would be
  an excellent choice for a terminal program, well worth the $15.





Microphone II version 4.0.3
---------------------------

  (Demo version is what I tried)

  Microphone is a full featured commercial telecommunication
  program.

  Go to Settings menu and select communications. Select Hardware
  Handshaking on. You can use Hayes V-Series/Ultra for the driver or
  just use init string AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60




MacKermit 0.99
--------------

  If you don't know what kermit is then you don't need this program.
  You can find it on info-mac archives or its mirrors. In directory
  info-mac/comm

  Set bps to 19200, or 38400 or 57600 Hardware flow control. ENABLE:
  DTR input flow control. ENABLE: CTS output flow control. Disable:
  Drop DTR on quit. Disable: Xon/Xoff flow control.

  You can type the init string

AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60

  in the terminal window or create a macro to make it easier.


Terminal 2.2
------------

  This program is only listed here since the "C" source code is
  available. It also lets you directly inspect the CTS value and
  toggle the DTR/RTS pin.  (Lets you partially check that your cable
  is correct).


  Terminal 2.2 is a free terminal program that supports Xmodem,
  Ymodem, Zmodem QuickB file transfer. Automatic MacBinary format
  recognition. Scripts written in a subset of C.   You even get C
  source code for the program!

  Where to get it?  You can find it on info-mac archives or its
  mirrors. In directory info-mac/comm

  Bad news is the terminal emulation is a plain TTY.  I.e it doesn't
  do ANSI BBS or VT102 or even VT52. However it is better than
  Macknowledge for file transfers since it supports Zmodem.

  I have used the program for Zmodem downloads and uploads and it
  works fine but is a little flaky in general. Its also hung on me
  more than a few times. Good enough for occasional use, not a
  program for every day use however.


  Again use  AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60 or plain AT&F.  You will type it
  manually each time or open the macro.m file with teachtext or any
  text editor and change the modem reset string ATZ to
  AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60.  You will still have to select it from the macro
  menu unless you write a script (I am not going to teach you C).

  Go to Options menu select Communications.  In the dialog box
  select the setting CTS & DTR. Try 19200 bps to start. You can try
  57600 bps but slower speeds may be needed to make this particular
  program work at all.


Prodigy
-------
  I tried version 2.1 of the software. First, set your chooser to
  your printer. Turn off the 68040 cache (if so equiped). Go through
  the idiotic installation.

  There is no modem specific info to modify (other than selecting
  9600 baud if the local phone number(s) support it).

  This is a joke right? Have fun runing a poor imitation of a
  "Windows 3.0" interface on your Mac. No desk accesories, control
  panel, standard dialog boxes etc.

America Online
--------------

  My experience was with version 2.1 of the Mac software as of May
  94.


  First the AOL Tech Support BBS is 1-800-827-5808

  You can download the current AOL software at 14.4K bps. (Free call
  and much faster than 2400 bps)

  There is an ftp site with the AOL software, the AOL FTP software
  and the complete set of modem drivers. The addresses are

ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_mac/Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_mac/READ_ME_for_Mac_AOL_2.5.1.txt

The windows software is
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_win/icn-aol-logo.gif
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_win/icn-text.gif
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_win/icn-write.gif
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_win/readme.txt
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_win/readme.wri
ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_win/waol15.exe




  Follow installation instructions. Remember the Help menu (in the
  apple menu). Read the instructions there about modem settings.
  Create a modem setting as below.


  The "official AOL" linelink driver uses:

  Attention: AT
  Initialization: Leave it Blank
  Configuration:Q0E0V1X4 Reset:Z
  Enable Hardware Handshaking: &F&C1
  Disable Hardware Handshaking: &F&C1%C0&K0\N3
  Future Use String #1: Leave it Blank
  Future Use String #2: Leave it Blank


  These settings do work but they are not quite optimal. Quoting the
  Help file:

  The Initialization String is needed only if you must initialize
  your modem into the Hayes Command Mode.  Usually, this box is left
  empty.

  The Configuration String is used to optimize your modem settings
  for connection to America Online.

  The Reset String restores your modem to the settings it was using
  before signing on to America Online. For reset I highly recommend
  you use &FW2L3&C1S7=60 instead of Z. You can also use
  &FW2L3&C1S7=60 for your "Configuration:" string. The "Z" can
  easily interfere with Fax/Voice mail.



  If you have problems be sure to check you are calling a 9600 bps
  access number. Also as of April/May 94 they just don't have the
  network capacity to handle the load. So for your first attempts
  try calling on weekday in the morning or very late at night. If
  you get in occasionally with no problems , it is the network not
  the modem. Also the AOL software likes to think the serial ports
  are locked. So to avoid that reboot with no extensions on, start
  AOL and have fun. If you still are having trouble try disabling
  Error control i.e. add  \N0 to Configuration string and forcing
  the modem to initiate at 9600 bps.

  Communicate Lite is now bundled with Linelinks and Prometheus
  manufactured modems. Unlike the previous communication software
  (Macknowledge) this is actually solid and modern.

  See "Comm toolbox based applications" section for setup.

  Macintosh Communication Software CURRENTLY supplied is Communicate
  Lite by Mark/Space Softworks. This is a very competent Comm
  Toolbox based program. It includes a current copy of the Apple
  Modem Tool, Serial Tool, the VT102 terminal tool, XModem file
  transfer Tool, and appropriate Apple Modem settings for the
  Linelink. Prometheus chose not to license the zmodem tool but
  there is a publicly available demo of the tool (fully functional
  except you can't upload). A discount coupon is included on the
  full zmodem tool when purchased directly from Mark/Space. ($19.95
  plus shipping) The program is functional and the user interface is
  uncluttered, which is the way a term program should be in my
  opinion.  The manual is a real printed one. 64 pages long. Has an
  index, table of contents, background info, tutorial and full
  reference. (Actually the Balloon Help in the program is quite
  sufficient!).  Demo versions of Communicate Lite and other
  Mark/Space products can be obtained via the BBS. The most recent
  versions of support files and the demos can always be obtained via
  ftp at

ftp.netcom.com in directory pub/mspace

  at present the relevant demo versions of the files are
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/communicate-lite-demo-102.hqx
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/zmodem-tool-demo-102.hqx

  The updaters are
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/communicate-lite-101-update.hqx
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/zmodem-tool-101-update.hqx

  **Note:** Versions 1.01 and 1.02 are identical except for the
  about box and other places with the company address and phone
  numbers. So don't worry about updating to 1.02 from 1.01.

  You will also need the apple modem tool definitions if updating
from a previous version.
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/amt-modem-definitions.hqx

  and while you are there pick up
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/linelink-to-AOL-110.hqx
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/pagenow-demo-091.hqx
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/mspace/tge-tcp-tool-200.hqx

  PageNow is a program for using your modem to call a text pager.

  The demos can also be found on AOL (keyword "MCM"), AppleLink
  (Third Party Demos folder),  CompuServe ("go maccom", download
  area 4) and GEnie and BIX (somewhere) as well as on the Mark/Space
  support BBS at 1-408-293-7290.

  or you can ftp on info-mac archives or its mirrors as

info-mac/comm/term/communicate-lite-102-demo.hqx

  The demo of the zmodem tool is

info-mac/comm/CommToolbox/zmodem-tool-102-demo.hqx

  and on umich as

umich/util/comm/commtoolbox/markspacezmodemdemo1.02.sit.hqx
umich/util/comm/commtoolbox/modemdefinitions.sit.hqx

  Mark/Space is also planning to have a Telnet tool and PC-ANSI tool
  out later this year.

  The amount of scripting available in Communicate Lite is simple
  but adequate for simple logons. If you want more then get the
  Calypso Modem Tool which is free and use that (in theory at least)
  with Communicate Lite.


SITcom
------

  SITcom does sidegrades so SITcom can be had for $45 by "upgrading"
  from MacKnowledge.

  Sitcomm , FaxPro and Connectix utilities WERE bundled for $79.95
  at Macwarehouse (Catalog 34, Part # BND 0401 or 0402)

  My understanding is that SITcom is Comm toolbox based. I don't
  have the software personally. For setup then see "Comm toolbox
  based applications" section.



Termy
-----

  See "Comm toolbox based applications" section for setup.

  The major feature of this software is its free and CommToolbox
  based , also version 3.2 has many file conversions built in.


  You can get the most recent version from the Authors site as

ftp://nigel.msen.com//pub/vendor/ice/Termy-3.2.hqx

  Old version is on info-mac as

 info-mac/comm/termy-23.hqx




Claris Works 2.0 and 2.1
------------------------

  See "Comm toolbox based applications" section for setup.

  This a commercial "Works" package thats commonly bundled with
  Macs.


Comm toolbox based applications
-------------------------------
  First a program that just supports "ports" registered by the
  CommToolbox is NOT a CommToolbox application. (For instance Zterm
  is not CommToolbox).

  If a program uses the CommToolbox it can use any CommToolbox Tool.
  You can choose the tools you need and not install the tools you
  don't use. Programs don't need to be updated to use New tools.
  There are some unusual tools available (i.e. TCP, AppleTalk, ISDN
  etc). Many are free, unfortunately a few things are not free and
  some things don't even exist.

  The Apple tools are "free" and usually included with other
  software. If they aren't you can get it directly from Apple. The
  directory is

<ftp://ftp.support.apple.com/pub/Apple SW Updates/Macintosh/
Networking & Communications/Communication Toolbox Tools/>

  All the common tools (i.e. VT102, Xmodem, Serial Tool, TTY, Text)
  are in whats called the Basic Communications Setup. Whose current
  file name is  BCS (1.1.1).hqx   The Apple Modem Tool is usually
  needed and is file  Apple Modem Tool (1.5.3).hqx  There are other
  Apple supplied tools in that directory also.

  The demo of the Mark/Space Z-Modem  tool is at

info-mac/comm/CommToolbox/zmodem-tool-102-demo.hqx

  For other tools (i.e. YMODEM , TCP, etc) check out directorys

<ftp://ftp.tidbits.com/pub/tidbits/tisk/CommToolbox/
umich/util/comm/commtoolbox/>


  The Calypso Modem Tool adds CCL scripting to CommToolbox programs.
  (So if you can do extensive login scripting). The CCL modem tool
  does the same thing for the dialin scripts.

  The modem settings of CommToolbox based programs are based on the
  modem tool settings ONLY.  I will assume you are using the Apple
  Modem Tool. The way of accessing the modem tool might vary with
  program but will be the same after you have the tool selected.

  Getting into command mode: The apple modem tool does not normally
  allow you to enter AT commands. So select the serial tool to do
  that.  Select the speed , and open a connection. (In the menu for
  ClarisWorks, NOT the icon). You will need to do that to completely
  reset your modem to factory defaults but not much else.

  The instructions for setting up are almost identical for
  ClarisWorks 2.0 and Communcicate Lite. Other CommToolbox programs
  are also similiar.

  For Claris Works 2.0  after starting the program in communications
  mode go to the Settings Menu and select Connection. You now get a
  dialog box. Select the Apple Modem Tool under Method. You are now
  in the Apple Modem Tool.

  The Linelink setting is already available in the Apple Modem Tool
  distributed by the Communicate Lite people (Mark/Space) and
  Prometheus. If you don't have that then do the following.

  Under the pop up menu for "modems" select custom or modify menu.
  If you use modify menu, then name your new modem LineLink 144e or
  your favorite nickname.

  Check the box for "Modem Auto-Buffers Connect Speeds". If there is
  a box for "Hardware Error Correction" check the box for it. Use
  initialization string AT&FW1L3&C1S7=60 ( or AT&F or whatever you
  REALLY think is better). Put nothing in for the "RING RESPONSE"
  string.

  Save your settings.  Thats all folks!


Hermes and MacKennel BBS
------------------------
  From billk@Kuentos.Guam.NET (Bill Kochman)
MacKennel:

Initialize:  ATS0=0Q0V0E0M0S2=1X4&C1W2&D0
Hang Up:     ATH0
Busy Out:    ATH1

  These are the strings which are included in the Line Link 144e
  driver included with Hermes II 3.1.1 which I'm now using.  The
  modem is set to its factory defaults as Lloyd suggests when using
  this driver:

BBS Initialize:          ATS0=0Q0V0E0M0S2=1X1&C1W2
Terminal Initialize:     ATQ0V1E1S2=43M1S11=50W1
Hardware Handshake On:   &K3&D0
Hardware Handshake Off:  &K4&D2
Answer Modem:            ATA
Lock Speed:              &Q5
Variable Speed:          &Q0
Reset:                   AT&F

  As far as the other Hermes pref settings, I have hardware
  handshake &allow crashmail both checked as well as DCD pin 7/chip.
  Min. baud rate is set to 2400 and max to 57600.


ARA - Apple Remote Access
-------------------------
  The linelink includes ARA scripts on the Macknowlege disk as well
  as the MaxFax disks. These apparently are OK but not great for ARA
  1.0. ARA 2.0  MAY be a problem. Checkout the demo version of
  Lineshare for newer scripts (not from Prometheus). Also there are
  some generic dial scripts you can get from ftp.tidbits.com. The
  documentation that comes with interslip covers a subset of the ARA
  scripts. Also check out the documentation on Calypso Modem Tool.
  You can use resedit to change the type of the ARA script file to
  TEXT. Edit it with a word processor, then change the TYPE back to
  what it was.  Generally, ARA works fine for most people or they
  just keep trying scripts for different modems until one works. One
  day real soon I may try to make a good one! (Sure you are!)



Internet programs and the Linelink (Macintosh)
==============================================

  The internet revolves around the TCP protocol. The TCP stack for
  the Mac is called MacTCP. To connect to the internet you need a
  slip or ppp account on a computer somewhere and a slip or ppp
  program on your mac and MacTCP.


MACTCP
------

  First like it or not you need MacTCP from Apple or a competing
  product. MacTCP is included with System 7.5 so you may already
  have it. The rest can be found for instance at info-mac archives.
  Directory to look in is info-mac/comm/MacTCP/



  MacTCP itself you will have to get legally. Once upon a time
  Eudora included MacTCP 1.x.x , though you weren't suppose to use
  it except with Eudora. If you don't have MacTCP and no site
  license at your location this is the cheapest way to get MacTCP
  2.0.x legitimately is to buy

   The Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh, by Adam C. Engst.
   Published by Hayden Books. ISBN# 1-56830-064-6. $29.95 U.S.A.

  The most current versions of the software included with that book
  (excluding MacTCP) can be found at

ftp://ftp.tidbits.com
<192.135.191.2>

http://www.tidbits.com/tidbits/

  you can also find many of these items at info-mac or umich
  archives or plugging a local site ftp.utexas.edu

  This book covers a lot of internet stuff. It includes a disk with
  MacTCP (2.02 at last printing)  , Fetch, Interslip, Telnet, etc
  etc. You can get just about everything you need from the book and
  disk. Its also reported to be very good introductory book. I have
  glanced at it in book stores and its pretty good (Adam can write,
  read tidbits!). You can get the book for less than $20 (such as
  Sam's clubs, MacWarehouse). Updaters from 2.0.2 to 2.0.4 are
  available online. Updaters to MacTCP 2.0.6 from 2.0.4 are also
  available.

info-mac/comm/MacTCP/mactcp-20x-to-204-updt.hqx
/info-mac/comm/tcp/mactcp-204-to-206-updt.hqx

<ftp://ftp.tidbits.com/pub/tidbits/tisk/tcp/
mactcp-204-to-206-updt.hqx>
<ftp://ftp.tidbits.com/pub/tidbits/tisk/tcp/
mactcp-20x-to-204-updt.hqx>



  The second edition is now available also and includes more of
  everything especially on slip and ppp. If you are clueless spend
  the $20 on the book. It will probably save you hours of
  frustration.

  In any case versions of MacTCP before 2.0.4 had what was known as
  the MacTCP timeout bug. If you are stuck using MacTCP 1.1.1 then
  use the following patch

 /info-mac/comm/mac-tcp-retrasmit-patch.hqx

  This is a little application that will alter the MacTCP driver to
  incorporate Peter Lewis' patch. You will need a virgin copy of
  MacTCP, version 1.1.1 for this process.



InterSlip
---------
  I have tried Interslip 1.0 , 1.0.1 and  beta version 1.0.2d2.

Use

* Hardware handshaking

* Speed of 57600 or 38400.

* An init string of AT&F&C1W1L3S7=60.

* For the dialing script use the built in Hayes Compatable Setting.

  For the gateway script and other settings read the Interslip
  documentation and ask your slip provider how to setup MacTCP and
  the gateway script accordingly. There are several other gateway
  and dialing scripts available at the above ftp site as well as the
  tidbits ftp site directory

ftp://ftp.tidbits.com/pub/tidbits/tisk/MacTCP/

The file names all start with "scr"

  The Hayes Compatable dialscript doesn't hangup the phone. If you
  must have that feature then consider the dialscript

scr-freds-zen-interslip-script.txt
scr-minimal-dialing-script.txt

  in the above directories. I also wrote one myself called
  RobustDialScript in directory

ftp://spinfree.cm.utexas.edu/MacSpecificFiles/InterSlipScripts/

  Interslip is very good but it has serious problems on its scripts.
  I found many bugs relating to the dialscript I made.  ARA files
  won't work as dial scripts in general contrary to the Interslip
  documentation because of those bugs. There seem to be similiar
  problems in the gateway scripting but not as severe. At least
  Interslip has scripting unlike MacPPP.

  In any case if it doesn't hook up to the server , it may require
  changing the provided login script.

MacSlip
-------

  MacSlip is commercial, made by a guy here at the University of
  Texas.

  I have used MacSlip 1.01, 2.0, 2.0.2, 2.0.4   note that 2.0.2 has
  some bad bugs so upgrade to 2.0.4 from other 2.0.x versions.

info-mac/comm/MacTCP/mac-slip-202-to-204-updt.hqx
info-mac/comm/MacTCP/mac-slip-203-to-204-updt.hqx

  I used hardware handshaking and AT&F&C1W1 as init string. You can
  also use the modem setup "Generic V32bis/V42bis". I had next to
  nothing to change in the gateway script. (I.e at most the same
  changes needed in Interslip).


  MacSlip has better scripting and MUCH, MUCH better script
  debugging than Interslip. Its also more configurable and faster.
  Ignoring price then MacSlip wins on all other counts.

MacPPP
------
  MacPPP is available on info-mac.

info-mac/comm/MacTCP/mac-ppp-201.hqx

  or

ftp://merit.edu/pub/ppp/macppp2.0.1.hqx


  Version  2.0 had a bug causing it to not send the modem init
  string if the "AT" was included in the modem init string.


  Settings I am personally using are

* Port Speed: 57600

* Flow control: CTS & RTS (DTR)

* Modem Init: AT&FW1L3&C1S7=90

* Modem Connect Timeout: 90 seconds

  Set Idle timeout to maximum amount of time you want your modem to
  be connected to your server without sending or receiving data. (15
  minutes is a good choice in my opinion).

  To have MacPPP detect the line drop, change the "Echo Interval" in
  ConfigPPP from "Off" to some number of seconds (20 is what works
  well for me).

  And all LCP and IPCP options set to default values.

  Use the terminal window for figuring out how to login. **THEN** do
  the Connect Script.



InterPPP and PacerPPP
---------------------

  Caveat: I know nothing personally about these products.

  InterPPP is a commercial product. For sales information and a demo
  check the same ftp site as InterSlip.

  PacerPPP is bundled with Pacer's PacerTerm 3.0. (Different
  company)

* InterPPP and PacerPPP support both SLIP and PPP

* InterPPP and PacerPPP support both IP and AppleTalk over PPP

* InterPPP and PacerPPP support (require) CCL scripts to describe
  the modem configuration (as does AppleLink and ARA). The scripts
  SHOULD be modified to use compression and error correction. I
  suspect dialing scripts made for InterSlip will work. So see that
  section.




Speed Comparisons
-----------------
  On a MacIIsi with MacSlip 1.0.1 or Interslip 1.0.1: File transfer
  rates of binhexed and compressed files are around 1200cps. For
  text files I think I saw a maximum of 2000cps.

  On a Quadra 605 with MacSlip 2.0.4 and MacTCP 2.04: File transfer
  rates of binhexed and compressed files are around 1400cps typical
  to just under 1600cps. For text files about 3400cps. This was with
  1500 byte compressed header packets.

  On a MacPlus (Finder, System 6.0.5, 2.5Meg)  MacSlip 2.0.4 and
  MacTCP 2.04. Essentially the same results as the MacIIsi with the
  older software.

  Keep in mind SLIP uses small packets (1500 bytes or less). Hence
  v42bis compression is not as useful as it normally is. I would
  disable v42bis compression on a MacPlus, Classic, SE via setting
  S46=136 in the init string and set the Mac's speed at 19200bps.
  This gives a more even and slower speed for the slower Mac to
  respond to. On faster machines I would stick with above settings.
  This may be Voodoo.




TIA (The Internet Adapter)
--------------------------
  SOFTAWARE CO. (Los Angeles, CA) 310-314-1466 (9-5 M-F, PST)

  TIA is a new Internet access utility that lets you use popular
  TCP/IP software such as Mosaic, Cello, and Eudora with a standard
  UNIX shell account. In essence it converts a shell account into a
  "pseudo-SLIP" account.

  TIA's web page is

http://marketplace.com/0/tia/tiahome.html

  You can get an email message containing TIA's own FAQ from

tia-FAQ-single@marketplace.com

  This is too difficult a subject for a short answer here. Luckily,
  Bill Arnett <billa@netcom.com> is compiling a FAQ for Macintosh
  users of TIA. He has a world wide web page you can ftp from

ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/billa/billa.html





FAX (and nothing but the FAX)
=============================

Macintosh Fax Software Comments
-------------------------------

  MaxFax is currently bundled with most modems being sold now. Since
  the Linelink is made by Prometheus previous buyers of Linelinks
  can upgrade to

  MaxFax 3.5.x ($19.95 Fax or $24.95 Fax/Voice Mail plus  $5
  shipping)

  Details in upgrade section.

  If you need Voice mail, MaxFax is the **ONLY** choice at present.


There are two big players in general purpose Macintosh Fax software:

FaxSTF 3.0 and Delrina Fax Pro 1.5


STF Technologies:
    FaxSTF 3.0 (Mail order Price is $30 to $40)
    AutoPak is about $55 more (which adds automatically printing
   incoming faxes rotations and optical character recognition)



Delrina:   Fax PRO 1.5 for the Macintosh ($55.95 at Mac'sPlace)
           $41 educational, about $26 in bundles.


  If you need character recognition then Delrina Fax Pro is a pretty
  clear choice. I don't think it supports ARA linesharing though.


The only Macintosh Fax shareware software is

  ValueFax:   The shareware fee for ValueFax is $20 for individuals
  and $25 for businesses. (Plus site licenses)

  Since its shareware you can try it at no risk and see how you like
  it. (There is a limit of about 30 Faxes without registering)



  On average these products seem to be pretty comparable in basic
  and not too basic Fax abilities. They do differ in advanced
  features.


MaxFax, ValueFax, and Delrina Fax Pro all work with the Linelink.


  FaxSTF had a horrible upgrade policy from FaxSTF 2.2.3.
  Specifically, the retail price was $59, the upgrade price was $39
  +$6 shipping. They got enough flack from owners to put out a free
  upgrade from 2.2.3 to 2.6.1.  HOWEVER NEITHER FaxSTF 2.6.1 or 3.0
  work with the Linelink. Old versions (i.e. 2.2.3) of FaxSTF work
  fine but are no longer available new.  ValueFax is better in my
  opinion than FaxSTF 2.2.3 so again forget FaxSTF unless you
  already have it. (See email in FaxSTF 3.0 section)


  There is a review of FaxSTF 3.0, and FaxPro 1.5 in MacWeek Feb 21,
  1994.  Highlights of the review are FaxSTF 3.0 had better
  interface and nicer output. FaxSTF 3.0 can "hand off" data calls
  to ARA or programs that support the comm toolbox. Note that a lot
  of programs don't use the comm toolbox. Delrina's FaxPro 1.5 had
  Optical Character Recognition which is only included with the Pro
  version of FaxSTF 3.0. Delrina's tech support was excellent,
  FaxSTF's was way below average.




Call Discrimination a.k.a. Adaptive Answer
------------------------------------------

  AT+FAA=1 enables calldiscrimination (otherwise called Adaptive
  Answer).


  Interestingly AT+FAA by itself returns codes consistent with the
  values listed for the the voice/fax/data discrimination.

  In any case the Fax software does this command for you. So forget
  it.


LineShare
---------

  Old email message: LineLink DOES support "adaptive answering" and
  thus it works fine with LineShare (for fax/data combinations, for
  example, fax/ARA) - at least it is what we were told by users.
  We'll have a look at LineLink next week - if it really works we'll
  include LineLink scripts into the standard lineShare package, as
  well as support for MaxFax in voice/fax mode, i.e. you'll be able
  to use the modem to process incoming voice, fax and ARA calls, as
  you can do now with the original Prometheus modems.

 Stalker Software, Inc  butenko@crl.com (Vladimir A. Butenko)

  Note: The demo version of Lineshare has specific settings for the
  Linelink now. MaxFax 3.5.x now has direct support for Lineshare
  but does not include it. You can get a demo version of LineShare
  from info-mac.


  FaxSTF 3.0 has Lineshare support (and includes it??) but doesn't
  work on the Linelink. So again MaxFax is better choice. Unknown
  about Delrina FaxPro.



FAX bugs and misfeatures
------------------------
  Number 1 problem is MaxFax won't automatically answer Fax calls
  when in voice mail mode. (No problem if in Fax Receive/Answer
  mode). This is partially fixed with the new firmware/ROM 1.4.g
  (MAYBE!)


  Number 2 problem (i.e. sending faxes don't quite complete
  negotiations) Easy fix is to add S7=60 (or S7=90) to init string.
  (Which is why its been recommended throughout this FAQ)

  Number 3 problem it appears at moment is that ATZ resets the modem
  including some Fax and voice settings.  This isn't really a modem
  problem but how software sharing a single piece of hardware
  interact.  Some programs send ATZ without your knowledge
  (including the ARA script). There is no single fix, i.e. you have
  to get all your init strings to be compatable which may be
  impossible. (Note this is not LineLink specific problem) Best
  temporary fix is to reboot or pull up the MaxFax Status DA when
  finished using a hostile telecommunication program so Faxes can be
  received.


  MaxFax and FaxSTF both suggest &D2 (I.e. use DTR to hangup) in the
  init string.



  Generally you can set things up to work nicely for either data or
  Fax or Voice Mail but not for more than one at a time.
  Deinitializing strings MAY help but only a few programs have them.

ValueFax
--------

  To install follow instructions of package. Choose Class 2 for type
  of modem. (No other settings during installation!)

Reviewer: Loudon Campbell
First a Disclaimer: I beta tested ValueFax.

  The beta version was fairly bug free and handled port conflicts
  with data programs much better than FaxSTF 2.x but not as well as
  MaxFax 2.x. I have yet to try the release version however. (Some
  rainy day)

  The release version has been used by others with Linelinks. No
  major complaints so far ( complaints on speed , lack of features).

  I found ValueFax to have a very clean user interface , much better
  than FaxSTF 2.x. The user interface feels a bit like Eudora and
  has seperate windows for incoming, outgoing and pending faxes. It
  has good print output at least on a DeskWriter. Simple
  installation (perhaps too simple!). After use I didn't like is as
  much as MaxFax. But this may be personal preference.    It has a
  few neat user interface features here and there though! It handles
  basic Fax operations ,including "mailing" lists and address books,
  but not stuff like OCR, voice mail or line switching with ARA. In
  feature set it does NOT compete with FaxSTF 3.0.x, MaxFax 3.x.x or
  Delrina FaxPro.  It does win over FaxSTF 2.x.x ,in my opinion.

  ValueFax will overwrite FaxSTF's files without warning. However
  FaxSTF installer will do the same thing to ValueFax's files. (They
  use the same names for some parts of the packages)


  I think the Mac community has been waiting for a shareware Fax
  software package for quite a while.  It is well worth trying since
  it is SHAREWARE.


Support is available via email to valuefax@netcom.com


  Latest versions of this product can be found at ftp.netcom.com in
  the pub/valuefax directory. Also archived as
 /info-mac/app/value-fax.hqx

  Its been reported that ValueFax changes nonvolatile modem memory.
  I have not confirmed that report. In any case it does take
  aggressive control over the modem when in use which some people
  don't like and some people do.

  Note that the upgrade to MaxFax 3.5.x for Linelink owners and
  Prometheus owners can be had for $19.95+ $5 shipping (Fax only).
  The fax/voice version is $5 more. The shareware fee for ValueFax
  is $20 for individuals and $25 for businesses. So for honest users
  in the short run you are not saving anything by using ValueFax
  over MaxFax.






PowerFax (System 7.5)
---------------------
  System 7.5 on CD-ROM (but not floppies?) includes Fax software
  (PowerFax) based on FaxSTF. I suspect the Linelink won't work
  since FaxSTF 3.0 doesn't work with the Linelink but I have no
  reports one way or another.

  However From: Jack W. Howarth, Ph.D. (NOT a Linelink user) If you
  are waiting on QuickDraw GX compatible fax software, you can just
  install PowerTalk and PowerFax off the System 7.5 CDROM. A bit
  overkill for just faxing but, hey, its free.  However PowerFax
  seems to be smarter about not letting programs lock up with
  accessing a serial port already in use (this is particularly true
  of MicroPhone II 4.0.2.) without using the Linemanager.


FaxSTF 3.0 Setup
----------------
  FaxSTF 3.0 once upon at time had a specific setting for a
  LineLink. It appears to have been removed recently. (Sept 94).

  However it does not receive Faxes for most people. It receives
  them but as garbage!

OK here's a chance to be on the cutting (oops bleeding) edge!

Updaters for fax-stf 3.x are

 /infomac/app/fax-stf-30-to-301b-updt.bin
 /infomac/app/fax-stf-new-modem-profiles.sit


FAXstf 2.6.1 Setup
------------------

  OK here's a another chance to be on the bleeding (oops cutting)
  EDGE! I have had the same problems as those reported in FaxSTF
  3.0. It sends but doesn't receive properly. See the FaxSTF 3.0
  section.

  There is a upgrade patch to version 2.6.1 from 2.2.3 that is free.
  It is on info-mac at

  /infomac/app/fax-stf-261-init-patch.txt
  /infomac/app/fax-stf-2x-to-226-updt.sit (Yes the file is
  misnamed!)



  If you get a copy that is not a disk image (which requires
  diskcopy or mungeimage) You will need to create  an installer disk
  named FaxSTF[tm] Installer and drag the contents of the folder to
  that disk (7 items).





FAXstf 2.2.3 Setup
------------------

The initialization string used on FAXstf 2.2.3 most commonly is
  AT\Q1&D2V1E
  NOTE: The "\Q1" part in the modem init string sets the modem to
  bidirectional XON/XOFF , that SEEMS to be required on this piece
  of software. But remember that it STINKS for data connections so
  be sure all other data software resets the modem appropriately.

Many people add &F at BEGINING of FaxSTF init string.

  WARNING WARNING WARNING- The &D2 part of init string has been
  associated with problems i.e. hangups and not receiving FAX's. You
  may not want to use it (i.e leave as factory default of &D0). It
  works either way so its your choice.

  Note that FaxSTF 2.x really takes over your modem for receiving
  Faxes. Expect problems, be sure your ordinary communications
  programs reset the modem to correct settings when you use those
  programs (i.e  &D0 is reset, hardware handshaking ON, etc!).


  Directions are from David Hartman Fax Settings for FaxSTF: (also
  Jack Z. Sun and others)


1. Make sure you have version 2.2.3 of the FaxSTF software.

2. Install the software from scratch. That means reboot with
  extensions off (i.e. shift key down for system 7.x). Note: you may
  want to move any phonebooks or coverpages you have previously
  created out of the FaxSpoolfolder before you install since the
  install will trash them.

3. In the installation, you'll be presented with a dialog window
  which will allow you to select either the modem model or driver
  type. Click on the "Driver Type" radio button and then select
  "Class 2 for Sierra based modems" (i.e. "PN2388 for Sierra based
  modems").

4. The next dialog is the standard install dialog.  Click on the
Install button to install all of the software AND the driver.

5. You'll have to reboot your computer after the install.  Make sure
  that your modem is turned on before the reboot or the modem won't
  be found and initialized.

6. Go to the Chooser and select the FaxPrint driver. Click on the
  SetUp button.

7. In the SetUp dialog, click on the Fax Modem icon. You'll see a
  number of settings, but the most important ones to look for are
  the send and recieve bps rates.  These should be set at 9600bps or
  if available AND IT WORKS 14400bps .

8. Click on the Fax Software icon.  Make sure that the "ON" radio
  button is highlited.  If it's not, go back to Step 2.  I don't
  know why, but in MY experience with this software, if the software
  isn't turned on AFTER the install then something didn't go right
  and you'll have to re-install :

9. Click on the Modem Init icon and make sure that the modem init
  string says "AT\Q1&D2V1E" (no quotes in actual string). NOTE: The
  "\Q1" part in the modem init string sets the modem to
  bidirectional XON/XOFF , thats needed for this software but
  remember that it STINKS for data connections so be sure all other
  data software resets the modem appropriately.


10. That's it!  You're ready to rock and fax!


  Comment from STF tech support: IF you are getting blank pages
  under 2.2.3, you were probably recieving at 14.4, try putting it
  down to 9600.


MacCommCentre 1.0.1
-------------------

Comments from : Timothy David Chipman <tchipman@is.dal.ca>


  I currently use a purchased copy of faxSTF 2.2.3, so some
  comparisons are made to that as my standard. A friend of mine
  recently bought a modem with this software included, but he
  dosen't use it, so I thought the least I could do was see how it
  worked with the linelink (mine is rev.1.3 old roms)

* Installed package takes up about a meg of disk space. Installed
  onto HD using defaults, auto modem detect sucessfully determined
  that my LineLink was a Type II and installed the apropriate
  driver. <Nice!>
* Sucessfully recieved a 2 page fax from a microsoft fax-back
  server. Only complaint - it was slow: it took approximately 5
  minutes to recieve the fax, and when I checked my FaxSTF results,
  it took less than 2 minutes. Humm... speed *appeared* to be 9600
  baud, I *think* (the info was not displayed at recieve, nor
  recorded clearly anywhere, such as the log file..)
* Claims to support 14,400 baud S/R but from my previous point, I
  suspect that this isn't the case with the LL144e.
* I didn't have anyone around to experiment with sendfax,although I
  am certain that if it recieved a 2pgfax no prob, then send is a
  piece of cake.
* Claims to have voice discrimination, but it has screeched in my
  ear while talking to people if the modem was left turned on... so
  this feature appears not to work..
* I had some "funny" stuff happen to my system while MCC was
  installed. MCC attempts to add a "Fax" item to the bottom of all
  apps' file menu, but this appeared mainly to append junk to the
  menus. Not impressive.

  Overall: Since I own a copy of STF that works fine at 9600, I will
  continue to use that. MCC offers me no benefits. Possibly newer
  rom linelinks would getthe benefits of faster (14,400) faxing, and
  call discrimination, which Stf 2.2.3 does not support with my
  current setup, however this is not certain.





QuickLink II - FAX software
---------------------------
  The following is courtesy of Darryl Harvey  Email:
  djh@shell.portal.com

  The setup for the LineLink 144e and QuickLink II Fax was simple.

  The software came with a Practical Peripherals PM14400FMXT modem.
  The software was installed with this modem and I just plugged the
  LineLink in it's place and it all worked 100% (Send & receive -
  High & Low res)

Actual setup string is: AT&FE1L1V1X4&C1&D0S0=0S7=60

  There appears to be some times when the modem locks up, but a
  power reset fixes it up..  I have not traced it down yet, but I am
  not to worried about it as it only happens when I want to send...
  I am not convinced it is the software causing it anyway.

  For $99, you can't expect everything working 100%.Would I
  recommend it? If it was all you could afford, and willing to put
  up with the occasional compulsary power reset.  YES.

  BTW:  I am not too crazy about Fax software anyway, they all seem
  to do things to your modem ports that other software doesn't like.
  I just test them out and then remove it from my disk..  If you
  could run fax software without the required "background" program,
  it would be better (ie: send only, no need to monitor port for
  incoming receive)

  Note that after this posting by Darryl , he bought MaxFax with
  voice and has contributed elsewhere in the LineLink FAQ.



WinFAx Lite (For IBM PC)
------------------------
Source: Chuck Browning
  The init strings for the IBM (generic class 2 fax) is:
  AT&F&C1&D2S7=90


MaxFax 3.3.x SETUP
------------------

  Read the manual cover to cover after installation and trying it.
  It answers most questions.

  First if you are upgrading to the voice version of MaxFax from the
  Fax version of MaxFax throw away all your preference files ,
  MaxFax init etc into trash. In other words do a clean reinstall.


  MaxFax is very easy to install. Just boot without extensions.
  Double click on the installer. Follow directions. (You will be
  asked to send your registration via Fax) Next start up the MaxFax
  application If you are using the Fax only version of MaxFax (i.e.
  MaxFax 3.3.1s) Select Class 2 in the modem setup in the
  application.  The init string will default to &D2. I highly
  recommend at present to NOT use &D2 but either S7=60 or possibly
  &FW1L3&C1S7=60 (for consistency)


  If you are using  Fax only version of MaxFax (i.e. MaxFax 3.3.1L)
  Select Fax (or Voice or whatever your preference) The init string
  is blank by default. I highly recommend at present to use either
  S7=60 or possibly &FW1L3&C1S7=60

  You can also try S7=90 in either string or S7=120 for
  international calls for either version.

  The motivation is based on trying to be as consistent as possible
  and the following email.



The following are (almost) quotes of Milt Sagen (a MaxFax author):



When does MaxFax send the init string?

>When it initializes the modem for receiving and just before
>sending a fax.

  What happens when MaxFax answers the phone? Does MaxFax also send
  the init string for instance when a call comes in and the serial
  port is free?

> No, not if the RING is detected - if it detects garbage because
> the modem was switched off then on and thus the dce-dte speeds
> don't match, it will send an initialization string. Otherwise,
> It just answers and looks for an +FCON.

On reboot?

> No.  If MaxFax is set to Send/Receive it will send an
> initialization string during the first accRun (whichever
> application - typically the finder -which calls SystemTask)


What is the init string you send?

> I don't rely on any settings of the modem. If I absolutely need

  My own experiments indicate it does so when you open the DA and
  click on the popup menu containing send , send/recieve etc.

> Yes that will cause it do so although the version which supports
> voice won't cause this to happen.

> Note that we didn't actually change MaxFax in anyway to work with
> the LineLink as a fax and data modem."



Fifth question: Is &D2 really NEEDED in MaxFax init string?

>I haven't seen anything to suggest that it is.



End quotes from Milt Sagen.

  At the moment I have found that some programs do ATZ which resets
  the modem including Fax/Voice. This includes the ARA script
  included with the LineLink. On the Fax only version of MaxFax
  opening the DA resets the Fax to correct values. Seems to do the
  same on the voice if you change types.  In other words get in the
  habit of pulling up the MaxFax Status DA after quiting the program
  and reselecting the Fax Receive/Send or Voice S/R .




Slick program with lots of bells and whistles **Nice** job guys.


MaxFax 3.3.x Software REAL BUGS
-------------------------------
The following are documented bugs (i.e. verified by someone at
 Prometheus).

  Bug1: (Bug hit many people!) Upgrading from MaxFax 3.3.1S  to
  MaxFax 3.3.1L should be done from a clean install (ie. delete old
  application and most importantly the preference files). Otherwise
  you will get various bugs.

  Bug 2: (Bug found by Darryl Harvey and others, fixed I think in
  3.3.1L) There was a bug in one (or more) versions of MaxFax where
  if you enter more than 18 characters for the Fax name the program
  or MaxFax init hangs. So if you keep the fax name short, all is
  OK.  Darryl also believes Bug 4 below is a manifestation of the
  same bug. So try keeping the Fax name to less than 18 characters.

  Bug3: (Bug hit Loudon Campbell) "We did find a problem with
  viewing faxes on 68LC040's which includes the 605.  What would
  typically happen is a person would view a fax and then close and
  sometime later elbombo. We fixed it on the version of MaxFax which
  supports voice on the LineLink (i.e. MaxFax 3.3.1L version or
  later.).  The funny thing is the bomb only occurs on machines with
  LC040 such as the Performa 475 and the Quadra 605."

  Bug 4: Victor E Aldridge III reports the following info from
  Prometheus: Some systems running System 7.1 seem to crash during
  Startup for no explainable reason. Even removing all extensions
  and non-System cdevs (excepting the MaxFax INIT) will not stop
  this from occuring. This occurs in versions of MaxFax earlier than
  3.2.4, and was fixed in 3.2.4, though the developers have no idea
  what was fixed. This 'fix' was 'unfixed' in the upgrade to 3.3.1,
  which mostly included coding to increase the abilities of the
  program for Powerbook users. As I said, the developers at
  Prometheus do not know what is causing the problem, and no pattern
  has been discerned among the affected systems. The only
  alternative for those affected is to downgrade to 3.2.4. The
  Prometheus tech (I actually got through) I was talking to shipped
  it out 'blue label' at no charge to me, and the computer now boots
  fine with all my original extensions installed. Also see Bug 2.


  Bug 5: Roger B. Marks reports "a fax received while File Sharing
  is on leads to a hung system".   (I have no confimation of this
  one!)








MaxFax and Voice Mail
=====================

  This is most actively changing area so there are no quick fixes.
  If you are thinking of trying to modify MaxFax using resedit to
  increase volume , use call discrimination etc you will positively
  need the voice mail documentation.


User Comments, 1.4g ROMS and MaxFax 2.5.x
-----------------------------------------

  3.5.1 was first version of MaxFax that supported all Linelinks,
  3.5.0 was specific to 1.4g ROMS.  I am unsure but 3.5.2 or later
  is probably current November 1994??


  Prometheus SAYS the modem will now really discrimate between Fax
  and Voice via the CNG Fax tone. The program has more mailboxes and
  control over those mailboxes, better coversheet editing, and new
  bells and whistles.

  The following are responses I have had. Whether they are typical I
  don't know!


  Christoper Thomas was disappointed in the MaxFax software due to
  conflicts with America Online and various setup problems. He did
  say the modem more or less performed as advertised ignoring these
  problems. He switched to a Hayes Accura but has the following
  comment:
> The voice quality was about the level of a telephone which makes
> sense. I was recording in medium.  I had to turn the volume up
> quite a bit though, the input volume that is.


  Comments by Ty Bower <bower@louie.udel.edu> who has MaxFax 3.5.0
  and the 1.4g ROMS.

* Fax machine is unable to recognize CNG tones from more than 5
  different namebrands of fax machines (HP, Toshiba, Cannon, Sharp,
  etc) if in the dual Voice/Fax mode. In the fax only mode it
  receives and transmits perfectly.

* If I'm working on my Quadra and the phone rings, the software
  disables the keyboard even if the answering machine hasn't kicked
  in. For example, I pick upthe phone on the second ring. The
  software is set to answer after 4 rings, but that doesn't matter.
  The keyboard disables, the phone answering icon pops up,and
  sometimes regaining control is acheived only by rebooting.

* Their are known bugs in the volume and quality of the incoming and
  outgoingmessages. Prometheus says they're working on it.

* The tech support people at Prometheus (Toni and Clinton) are
  great, except getting through to them is a major problem. As I
  said, they had me send back my unit for a thorough checkout. I
  believe the problems stem from the unique Quadra 660AV interface I
  still like the GUI and believe once they fix these and other bugs
  it'll be a great unit.



User Comments and Pointers 1.0 or 1.3 ROMS and MaxFax 2.3.1L
------------------------------------------------------------

Comments in this section are circa Febuary 1994.

  The following info is a summary of info and comments from Darryl
  Harvey (djh@shell.portal.com) Marshall Levin
  (mlevin@nyx10.cs.du.edu) and Rich (rglewis@mit.edu)

(Darryl 's comments)

  Well it all works fine...  No problems at all..  The modem is a
  little deaf and that can result in early hang ups of the voice
  mail, but if you speak loud and clear, the message is loud and
  clear.  It does have limitations (ie: can't return to the main
  mailbox if you have previously selected a mailbox or section..)

The volume settings are not adjustable;

  It does take a long time to compress/decompress messages, I have
  only tried it in "best" mode, maybe select "good" would improve
  this?

Other things worth noting:

  Cannot record a greeting from a telephone connected to the modem,
  you must have a sound imput device on your Mac, use a remote
  phone, or import a sound file from another source. Could be a
  hassle for some Mac users that do not have a microphone on their
  Mac.

  The modem does not automatically detect an incomming fax when in
  voice mode.  The caller must manually enter 77# on the keypad to
  enable a fax receive mailbox. (This is the preset function, it
  could be changed, but still has to be manually entered)

  This is the _ONLY_ way to make the LineLink answer in Fax mode if
  Voice Mail is enabled and MaxFax is running.  So from your Fax
  machine, turn up the volume level, listen to the start of the
  message and then enter 77#, the LineLink WILL enable fax receive
  and your Fax should notice this and start sending.

  : Along the same line, how would one make a send a fax from one :
  LineLink to another LineLink (with the receiver running in the
  voice : mode)?  How would you send the 77# once the receiver
  answers?

  Same as from a normal fax machine..  Put a suffix in the dial
  string. Make it pause, then dial 77#.  May not work 100% but it
  could work.. All you would have to do is pause long enough for the
  remote LineLink to pick up the phone and start it's message.

  A few more things about the modem and voice software that may be
  useful to know:

  You must have the Max Fax software running on your mac or else the
  modem will only answer in fax mode (if set to Voice/SR fax).  It
  does not function in the background.  It will happily sit in the
  background until a voice message comes in, then it will come to
  the foreground and take control of your mac.

  To determine if you have the correct software for voice, an easy
  way to find out is to look at the modem configuration section.
  The Fax only software allows you to choose the modem type..  The
  Voice option software has this hard set to LineLink and you cannot
  change it (it is greyed out).




(Now Rich's comments)

*  The message plays back at a barely audible level. The settings
  for changing this are "grayed-out" and are unavailable.

* The sound quality on the recorded message is poor.I got AIFF
  Recorder off the net and recorded a crystal clear AIFF message,
  which I then attempted to import it.  The message was played back
  at half speed in MaxFax (although with good sound quality).  The
  MaxFax manual reports that a program called Sound Editor can be
  used with MaxFax,but I can't locate this program (any ideas?).

  4.The time that a caller has to leave message is about 7 seconds.
  I started by choosing the unlimited option for message length,
  which allowed a 1-2 second message.  Then I chose the 3 minute
  message length from the settings file, which allowed a 7-10 second
  message.

  I called MacWarehouse and they gave me the init string (I had no
  init string before) AT&F&D2S7=120, which does not work.  I think I
  know why. MaxFax appends this init string to its own, and I'm
  resetting the factory settings in this string.  In any event, this
  string causes the modem to go on and off line indefinitely.  So I
  tried &D2S7=120 as the init string, which, as yet, I haven't had
  time to observe the results (except for problem 4, which it did
  not cure).

(Now Marshall's comments)

  Basically, I am quite satisfied with the product.  It is well
  worth $99 + $39. It is certainly NOT professional quality, but I'm
  not trying to run a business here (and I certainly wouldn't
  recommend doing so with the LineLink).  I use the voicemail
  feature infrequently, the fax features on a fairly regular basis,
  and the data features almost constantly.

  If I didn't have the patience or know-how to mess with the
  configuration, or I were planning on using the system
  professionally (where I had to rely on it for my livelihood) I'd
  most certainly spend an extra $100-$150 and get a better system.
  But for the mostly-data, casual user who wants the features for
  occasional non-demanding personal use and doesn't mind fiddling
  with the configuration until it works right, this modem and
  software really is a steal ($140 for 14.4 fax/voice/data modem).




Fax recognition during voice mail (1.0 or 1.3 ROMS)
---------------------------------------------------
Quotes from Chris Baker (a coauthor of MaxFax)

  What doesn't work with a LineLink modem is being able to detect
  Fax CNG tones while the outgoing message is being played.  The DSP
  firmware in the LineLink doesn't support it.

  Regarding DTMF and CNG detection: I can't tell you exactly what is
  going on in the DSP but it comes down to not having enough tone
  detectors to do both DTMF which requires 8 tone detectors (4 row
  and 4 column).  To detect CNG, the DSP would need another tone
  detector for the 1100 khz CNG tone.  My understanding is that
  either there is not another tone detector available in the DSP or
  there in not enough horsepower to both do voice sound
  decompression (CVSD 4 to 1) and do 9 tone detectors at the same
  time.

  We are working very hard with Sierra to get them to improve this
  situation as not having CNG detection durring outbound voice is a
  detriment to the product.


  Concerning the problem with the modem not falling back to data
  mode if you speak or make noise into the phone, I am not sure why
  that seems to happen but we have reported it to the firmware
  engineers at Sierra and they are lookin into it.  AT the moment it
  looks like a firmware bug and will have to be fixed with a
  firmware change.


Amiga Software
==============

This section will hopefully improve in a few months!

AVM'n'Fax
---------

This is voice mail and Fax for the Amiga.

  From courtn@cs.uregina.ca I use AVM'n'Fax myself (which comes with
  the fax software efax).  During the installation, it set the
  proper fax init string for my LineLink.  Here it is:
  V1X4&K3&C1&D2&R0S0=0

General Amiga
-------------

Use of &D2 is fine on an Amiga.

As a rule of thumb keep speeds at 38400 or below.

  If you are getting a lot of overflows, try to reduce the number of
  colors on your term program to 4 or 2.  If you don't have a AGA
  Amiga, more than  4-8 colors can lock out the chip memory just
  enough to mess up your transfers.


  VLTjr is reported to be the fastest Amiga term program, an
  improvement over Term.




FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  Gopher, Internet
==============================================

FTP via America Online
----------------------


America Online offers Usenet, Gopher/WAIS and now FTP.
They CLAIM  WWW and telnet coming later this year.

You can ftp the AOL software itself from ftp.aol.com

  AOL has FTP available in open beta testing and it works.  To
  access this latest AOL Internet Tool use Keyword FTP. Read the
  documentation and the introduction to the internet (please!!!).
  AOL plans on setting up their own private mirrors of info-mac and
  umich so be sure to use mirror sites of favorite ftp sites and not
  the originals.




URL 's (Uniform Resource Locator)
---------------------------------

  The World Wide Web (WWW) uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to
  specify the location of files on other servers. Its also a handy
  shorthand. Some newsreaders and setext readers let you click on a
  URL and hit a key or pull down a menu to connect to that resource!

  A URL includes the type of resource being accessed (e.g., gopher,
  WAIS), the address of the server, and the location of the file.
  The syntax is:

scheme://host.domain/path/filename

  where scheme is one of

http    means the file is on a World Wide Web server
gopher  means the file is on a Gopher server
ftp     means the file is on a ftp server
WAIS    means the file is on a WAIS server
news    a Usenet newsgroup
telnet  a connection to a Telnet-based service

  If filename is ommited it means a directory.


  **Examples**

gopher://spinfree.cm.utexas.edu/

  means use gopher to connect to the internet site
  spinfree.cm.utexas.edu at the gopher root directory.

ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_mac/Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin

  means use ftp to connect to internet site ftp.aol.com the file
  named Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin is then in directory
  aol_mac

  Site names and URLs are often placed in brackets <>. This is done
  by convention if the URL is longer than a line of text. The site
  address is also commonly placed in brackets.






For folks new to ftp
--------------------

  If your mac is hooked up via SLIP or PPP or ethernet to the
  internet then just use Fetch, X-ferit, Gopher ,Anarchie , Telnet,
  NetScape, Mosaic, MacWeb or who knows what on your Macintosh,
  Windows or OS2 machine.  Of course you may need to get these
  programs to your computer so the following may still be useful
  once in your life.

  The following assumes you are connected to a unix machine
  connected to the internet.

  Generally after logging into your unix machine you simply type ftp
  "the sitename" which gets you a prompt something like ftp>

  When ftp prompts you for a username and password, send "anonymous"
  as the username, and your email address as the password, for me it
  would be loudon@uts.cc.utexas.edu.  Use your real email address as
  a matter of courtesy. Help usually lists available ftp commands.
  Most common are cd (change directory), ls (list directory), get
  (get the file from the ftp site to your local unix box) and quit.

Imagine I give you an URL of
 ftp://ftp.aol.com/aol_mac/Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin

To get that file here is a typical sample UNIX ftp session:

ftp ftp.aol.com
Connected to ftp.aol.com.
220 ftp FTP server
 (Version wu-2.4(3) Wed Jun 29 08:27:45 EDT 1994) ready.
Name (ftp.aol.com:loudon): anonymous
331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
Password:
230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> cd aol_mac
250 CWD command successful.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file list.
Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin
READ_ME_for_Mac_AOL_2.5.1.txt
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> get Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for
Install_America_Online_v2.5.1.bin (1428224 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
1428224 bytes received in 17 seconds (80 Kbytes/s)
ftp> ascii
200 Type set to A.
ftp> get READ_ME_for_Mac_AOL_2.5.1.txt
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for
 READ_ME_for_Mac_AOL_2.5.1.txt (981 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
1017 bytes received in 0.16 seconds (6.2 Kbytes/s)
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.

  The above site defaults to binary mode, most sites start in ascii
  mode so thats somewhat unusual. On the above site the macintosh
  files are stored as Macbinary (.bin in the file name is the tip
  off) so the file was transfered via binary (the default on that
  site). I had to change to ascii mode (by typing ascii) **BEFORE**
  I got the plain text file (.txt in the file name is the tip off).
  If the file had ended in .hqx or .uue or .doc I would have assumed
  I needed ascii mode for those files also. If it had ended in .sit,
  .zip, .cpt, .exe, .sea, .z, .Z,  I would have assumed I needed
  binary mode, you change mode by typing binary before transfering
  the file with get. If the file ended up corrupted when I got it I
  would have tried the other transfer method a second time.


Now suppose I gave you a URL of

 gopher://spinfree.cm.utexas.edu/

then on a unix box just type

 gopher spinfree.cm.utexas.edu

  then follow the menus  down to the file you want. Gopher
  understands file types so you don't have to worry on that count.
  (can't get much easier than that without a mouse!).

Now suppose I gave you a URL of

 http://www.apple.com/

then on a unix box just type

 lynx www.apple.com
or if you have a fancy Xwindows graphics display perhaps
 Mosaic www.apple.com

then follow the menus down to the file you want.


  Hopefully the files are now on your unix box. You then download
  using xmodem, zmodem ,kermit or whatever (using either ascii or
  binary mode depending on above). sz, xmodem ,kermit are usually
  the unix program names.

  On a Mac get the current version of Stuffit Expander (preferably
  with DropStuff Enhancer) and just drag the file onto it and
  generally it knows what to do with it.  If you are a unix user
  grab mcvert from info-mac and use it on your unix box to save
  download time. Etc.





FTP SITES
---------

  The two biggest archives of Macintosh software on the internet are
  info-mac, whose site name is
  ftp://sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac
and umich, whose site name is
  ftp://mac.archive.umich.edu/mac/

  Many mirrors (i.e. copies) of these sites exist and you should use
  a mirror site close to you instead of the original site. The
  original sites are overloaded with requests for files so its
  pointless to even try.

In this faq and other mac documents if you see

 infomac/whatever

it means ftp to one of the info-mac mirror archives

Info-Mac Mail Server(s)
-----------------------
ricevm1.rice.edu (IP number 128.42.30.2)      (mailserver only)

  Most Info-Mac files are available from LISTSERV@RICEVM1.RICE.EDU,
  the same LISTSERV that handles the Info-Mac Digest.  You can
  retrive Info-Mac files by sending an email message with a body
  containing:

$MACarch  GET    filename.filetype

to "Get an Info-Mac file". Other commandes include:

$MACarch  Help

to "Get help about $MACARCH" and

$MACarch  INDex

to "Get a list of Info-Mac files"


  You can get the above information and more by sending a message
  with the command

HELP

  in the body of the message - on a line by itself to
  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.RICE.EDU.

E-mail on Internet, CompuServe and America Online
=================================================

  To send e-mail FROM CompuServe TO an Internet address, all you
  have to do is use the address:

INTERNET: recipient address@domain

  That is, just put INTERNET: in front of the Internet address. So
  my internet address on Compuserve would be INTERNET:
  loudon@uts.cc.utexas.edu

  To send e-mail FROM Internet TO CompuServe, just use the
  CompuServe ID number, with the comma changed to a period, followed
  by  @compuserve.com.  For instance,

12345.6789@compuserve.com

To send email to an AOL address from the internet its recipient@aol

  To send email from AOL to internet the information is. send to
  'user@domain'

So to send email to me from AOL send to loudon@uts.cc.utexas.edu

@ENDNODE
