This document uses a mono-spaced font (Monaco) that contains tabs that
are 8-spaces wide (looks nice on our unix box). You may have trouble
viewing this document if your font and tabs are not of a similar size.

This document is a list of modem commands for the Prometheus-made "LineLink
144e" modem. It is a v.32 data/fax/voice modem sold for $99(US) through
MacWarehouse (tel:1-800-255-6227) that has attracted a lot of attention
lately. Please see related files such as the "lineline-144e-faq" for more
general information about the modem and its use, if you don't already own
one. The FAQ provide helpful information, while this document is inteneded
only for owner reference purposes (not very handy without the modem).

This document is compiled from several sources. The information contained
herein is assumed to be correct, but it is used at your own risk. The sources
include the LineLink manual, Hayes modem command sets, Supra modem command
sets, Global Village modem command sets, and Fax Class 1/2 documents. Aside
from indirectly quoting manuals from modems I have purchased, I found some
information through Internet, and in general found the Prometheus BBS to
be lacking (for LineLink Mac users).

The LineLink modem comes with a "near-useless" 28 page manual. The manual
has very little technical info about its command set. This manual lacks
information about commands such as "%An" registers S16, S18, S21, and S22.
As far as I have been able to gather, the complete modem command set is:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command Mode:
=============
The LineLink modem must be in command mode before commands are typed. The
modem enters the command mode when it is turned on or reset, when it loses
a connection or when it is in the data mode and the escape sequence is
generated.

Data Mode:
==========
The LineLink modem is in the data mode after it makes a connection with
a remote modem and sends appropriate the CONNECT response. Everything it
receives from the DTE is considered data that it sends over the telephone
line to the remote modem.

The following comments apply to the modem commands that follow:
  
  - Commands can be entered in a string, with or without spaces. The "delete"
    or "backspace" key will be ignored by the modem.
  
  - A command line can contain one command or a series of commands, but
    cannot exceed 40 characters in length.
  
  - Commands that accept numeric arguments, when not specified, will default
    to 0. Numeric values are denoted by the variables "n" or "r"
  
  - The AT (attention) command preceds all commands (except A/).
  
  - Your command line must end with a <CR> (except when using A/).
  
  - The escape sequence "<GT>+++<GT>" lets you return to command mode without
    breaking your connection with a remote modem. <GT> represents a guard
    time which is a delay before and after the escape sequence.
  
  - Factory default settings are denoted with an asterisk, and are stored
    in non-volatile memory.

Direct Commands         Description
=============================================================================
AT                      Attention command prefix (precedes all except A/)
A/                      Repeat last command.
<GT>+++<GT>             Escape Code sequence. The guard time <GT> must be set
                        using register S12. This sequence is thus preceded and
                        followed by a minimum time period of no transmission.
<CR>                    Carriage Return. Terminate current connection attempt
                        during the dialing or protocol negotiation process.

                will not pass XON/XOFF to the remote modem.
          \X1 = Modem will act on XON\XOFF received from the local DTE, but
                will also pass XON/XOFF to the remote modem. This allows the
                local DTE to XON/XOFF the remote DTE through the established
                modem link.

%An     UNKNOWN COMMAND??? (0 <= n <= 255). Not listed in manual.
%Cn     MNP5 Data Compression.
          %C0 = MNP5 Disabled.

%En     Auto-Retrain.
         %E0 = Disable auto-retrain.
        *%E1 = Enable auto-retrain at 2400 bps when line quality is poor.


S Registers     Decription
=============================================================================
S0      Number of Rings to Auto Answer (0-255. Default is 0 = disabled).
S1      Count incoming rings (0-255). Resets after 8 secs after last ring.
S2      Escape Code character (0-255 Default is 43 "+"). Values greater
          than 127 disable the feature, preventing a return to command mode,
          unless a hang-up or DTR transition takes place.
S3      Carriage Return Character <CR>. (0-127. Default is ascii 13). Used
          to signal the end of the command line string in command mode.
S4      Line Feed Character <LF>. (0-127. Default is ascii 10). Used when
          the modem sends Result Codes. Cannot be totally disabled.
S5      Backspace Character <BS>. (0-32, 127-255. Default is ascii 8).
S6      Wait for Dialtone (2-255. Default is 2 seconds). When the modem
          executes a dial command. This tells how long to wait after going
          off-hook before beginning to dial.If the modem doesn't receive a
          dialtone before S6 elaspes, then will get a "NO DIALTONE" response.
S7      Wait time for carrier. (1-120. Default is 40 seconds). This tells
          the modem how many seconds to wait for a remote modem's carrier
          signal before hanging up and returning a "NO CARRIER" response.
S8      Pause time for comma. (0-255. Default is 2 seconds). The amount of
          time to pause each time the modem encounters a comma in the dial
          command line. This is useful when dialing through a PBX or to stop
          call-waiting (ATDT *70,555-1212).
S9      Carrier Detect response time. (1-255. Default is 6 tenths seconds).
          This is how long the remote modem's carrier (in 1/10 seconds) must
          be present, so it cannot be mistaken for a busy signal, ring, or
          voice. Increasing the time reduces the chances the modem will
          mistake line noise for a carrier signal.
S10     Carrier Loss Time. (1-255. Default is 14 tenths seconds). This is
          the time (in 1/10 seconds) between the loss of a remote modem's
          carrier signal and the LineLink disconnecting. The value can be
          increased to ignore carrier dropouts on a noisy line, or they
          can be reduced to make the modem automatically hang up and allow
          call-waiting calls to ring through. To ignore the Data Carrier
          Detect and have the LineLink act as if the remote modem's carrier
          is always present, set this value to 255. Setting this to a value
          less than the value in register S9, causes the modem to disconnect
          when it detects a momentary carrier loss, because register S10
          expires before the carrier respone time expires.
S11     Touch-Tone (DTMF) Dialing Speed. (50-255. Default is 75 ms). This
          is the speed of dialing (in milliseconds) during which the DTMF
          tones are held for each digit (it does not affect pulse dialing,
          which is fixed at 10 pulses per second).
S12     Guard Time Value. (0-255 in 1/50 seconds. Default 40/50 seconds).
          This sets the guard time <GT> delay required before and after the
          escape code sequence (usually "<GT>+++<GT>") before returning to
          the Command mode.
S14     Bit-mapped register (default value is 170) that provides the
          following functions (equivalent commands shown in parentheses):
          Bit 0,2: Disaply Result Codes.

S25     DTR Delay. When command &M1 is in effect, this specifies the number
          of seconds (default = 5) that the modem waits after a connection 
          has been made before examining the DTR signal. This delay allows 
          an asynchronous terminal to be detached from the modem and a
          synchronous terminal connection made while remaining in the Data
          Mode. After this delay S25 reverts to hundredths of seconds.
S26     RTS/CTS Delay. This is the number of 1/100 seconds (default is 1)
          that specifies the time delay between RTS and the CTS response.
S27     Bit-mapped register for Test Functions (default value is $49H).

S30     Automatic Timeout (in tens of seconds). This specifies the number of
          seconds the modem waits with no activity, before disconnecting (in
          10 second increments). Default is 0, which disables it.
S36     Negotiation Fallback. When the initial attempt to connect in error-
          control mode fails, this specifies what occurs next (default = 7).
                0 = Hang up
                1 = Attempt a direct asynchronous connection               
                                    (&Q0)
                2 = UNKNOWN???
                3 = Attempt an asynchronous connection using automatic     
                                            speed buffering (&q6).
                4 = Attempt a CCITT V.42 Alternative Protocol connection
(MNP 2-4); if 
                     (MNP 2-4); if negotiation fails, hang up.
                5 = Attempt a CCITT V.42 Alternative Protocol connection 
                     (MNP 2-4); if fails, attempt a direct async connection.
                6 = UNKNOWN???
                7 = Attempt a CCITT V.42 Alternative Protocol (MNP 2-4).
          Note: The selected fallback option can be initiated immediately
with S48.
          For example, a connection attempt using the MNP can be forced by
setting
          S48=128 and S36=5 or 7.
S37     Maximum DCE Line Speed S37 selects the speed (for all modes except
          CCITT V.24bis) at which the modem attempts to connect with a
          remote modem; the speed selected will be the highest DCE speed
          supported by both modems (see S93 for CCITT V.25bis modes).
                0  = Speed of last AT command issued
                1  = 75 bps
                2  = 110 bps
                3  = 300 bps
                5  = 1200 bps
                6  = 2400 bps
                7  = 4800 bps
                8  = 7200 bps
                9  = 9600 bps
                10 = 12000 bps
                11 = 14400 bps
S38     Delay Before Forced Hangup. This specifies the number of seconds the
          modem waits when in error-control mode (&Q5) before disconnecting
          (default is 20). This occurs after receiving the command to hang up
          or a DTR on-to-off transition. If set to 0, the modem does not wait
          for data in the buffers to clear (gives NO CARRIER response). If
          the register is set to a value between 0 and 254, the modem will
          wait the number of seconds, or until all data has been transferred,
          before hanging up. If set to 255, the modem will not hang up until
          all data is transferred.

S46     Compression Error Protocol Selection (values are only 136 or 138).
          Default is 138 (affects v.42/v.42bis mode).
                136 = Disable Compression.
                138 = Enable Compression.
S48     V.42 Feature Negotiation (values of only 0,7, or 128). This defines
          whether feature negotiation is to be performed by the modem. The
          feature negotiation process allows the modem to ascertain the
          remote system's capabilities. If these capabilities are already
          known and negotiation is not necessary, this can be skipped.
                0   = Disable Negotiation, proceed with LAPM.
                7   = Enable Negotiation (default).
                128 = Disable Negotiation, fallback per S36 setting.
S49     Minimum Buffer Size (in bytes). Default is 10 bytes. This specifies
          the minimum size of the buffer used in error-control or automatic
          speed buffering mode. Should be less than S50.
S50     Maximum Buffer Size (in bytes). Default is 200 bytes. This specifies
          the maximum size of the buffer used in error-control or automatic
          speed buffering mode. Should be greater than S49.
S63     Leased-Line carrier power level in dBm (0-15. Default is 0). This
          specifies a carrier level value that is not to be exceeded.
S82     Break Signaling Technique (values of only 3,7, and 128). This gives
          a method of break signal handling for CCITT V.42 communications: 
          in-sequence, expedited, and destructive. Break signals provide a
          way to get the attention of the remote host. The break type used
          depends on the application.
                3   = Expedited signaling used regardless of sequence in
                      transmitted and received data; current data integrity
                      is maintained.
                7   = Destructive signaling used regardless of sequence of
                      transmitted and received data; data in process at that
                      time is destroyed.
                128 = In-sequence signaling used as data is transmitted and
                      received; data integrity is maintained ahead of and
                      immediately after the break.
S86     Connection Failure Result Code (values of 0, or 4-15). This helps to
          determine the cause of a connection failure. When the modem issues
          a NO CARRIER result code, a value is written to this S-register.
          To read this register following the connection failure, issue an
          ATS86? <CR>. The modem will report one of the values below.
                0  = Normal hang up; no error occurred.
                4  = Physical carrier loss.
                5  = Feature negotiation failed to detect presence of another
                     error-control modem at the other end.
                6  = Other error-control modem did not respond to feature
                     negotiation message sent by this modem.
                7  = Other modem is sych-only; this modem is async-only.
                8  = Modems could not find a common framing technique.
                9  = Modems could not find a protocol in common.
                10 = Incorrect feature negotiation sent by other modem.
                11 = Sync information (data of flags) not received from
                     other modem. Modem waited 30 seconds before hanging up.
                12 = Normal disconnect initiated by other modem.
                13 = Other modem did not respond after many transmissions of
                     the same message. Modem made 10 attempts, then hung up.
                14 = Protocol violation occurred.
                15 = Compression failure.

          Note: Multiple occurences may contribute to a NO CARRIER message;
          Register S86 only records the first event that occurred.

=================
The LineLink firmware DOES support caller ID detection.  The modem will
display the caller id it receives from the phone co.  The only problem
is the modem will then crash and require a powercycle to get it back
because the LineLink lacks a relay switch on its board.

To try the caller ID yourself do the following: enter "AT#VS4" <CR> after
the OK. Set the port speed to 19.2k and enter "AT#CC1" <CR> to display
formatted caller id output.

FAX Commands:

The following fax commands assume the baud rate is set at 19.2k. These
commands have not yet been fully tested, but appear to comply to most
Class 1 and Class 2 fax-modems. Fax commands are like "AT" commands,
and must be preceded by the "AT" string (ie AT+FAA=1).

FAX commands of special interest are:
