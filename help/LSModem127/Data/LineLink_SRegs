S Register List
for LineLink 144e


S0	Auto-answer
	Range       Default

   0-255 rings   0      This register determines the 
                  number to rings the modem will 
                  count before automatically    
                  answering a call.  A value of 0 will 
                  prevent the modem from    
                  answering.  Values from 1 thru 
                  255 are the number of rings the 
                  modem will count before    
                  answering.  The default value is 0.

S1   Count Incoming Rings
   Range      Default

   0-255 rings   43      This register counts the number of 
                  incoming rings.  When the value in 
                  this register equals the value in 
                  Register S0, the modem answers.  
                  This register resets approximately 
                  8 seconds after the last ring.

S2   Escape Character
   Range      Default

   0-127 ASCII   43      Register S2 sets the ASCII value of 
                  the escape characters, used to 
                  switch the modem from Data 
                  Mode to Command Mode without 
                  losing the connection to the    
                  remote modem.  Values greater 
                  than 127 disable the escape 
                  feature, preventing a return to the 
                  Command Mode.  If the modem 
                  will be used to automatically 
                  answer incoming calls, either 
                  disable the escape characters of 
                  set them to a value other than 
                  that used by the originating 
                  modem.  To return to Command 
                  Mode with the escape characters 
                  disabled, the remote modem must 
                  hang up or an ON-to-OFF    
                  transition of the DTR interface 
                  signal must occur with the &D1, 
                  &D2, or &D3 command in effect.

S3   Carriage return character.
   Range       Default   

   0-127 ASCII   13      Register S3 sets the ASCII value of 
                  the carriage return (end-of-line) 
                  character.  This is the character 
                  used to end the command line 
                  (and have the modem execute the 
                  line) and also the character that 
                  appears after the modem sends a 
                  response.

S4   Line feed character.
   Range       Default

   0-127 ASCII   10      Register S4 sets the ASCII value of 
                  the line feed character.  The 
                  modem sends the  line feed    
                  character after a carriage return 
                  only when word responds are sent 
                  (v1command in effect).  If a line 
                  feed characters is not       
                  wanted,change the register value 
                  to a null character ( the line feed 
                  character cannot be totally    
                  disabled).








S5 Backspace character.
   Range      Default

   0-32, 127 ASCII   8      Register S5 sets the ASCII value of 
                  the backspace character.  This 
                  character is both the character 
                  created by pressing the Backspace 
                  key and the character echoed to 
                  move the cursor to the left.  To 
                  change the register value, assign 
                  an ASCII value between 0 and 32, 
                  or greater than 127.  Do not use 
                  values between 33 and 126 since 
                  they correspond to printable 
                  ASCII characters.

S6   Wait for dial tone.
   Range      Default

   2-255 seconds   2      When the modem executes a Dial 
                  command line with the X0, X1, or 
                  X3 response set in effect, Register 
                  S6 tells the modem how long to 
                  wait after going off hook before it 
                  dials the first digit in the Dial 
                  command line.  This feature is 
                  convenient when it takes linger 
                  than two seconds to obtain a dial 
                  tone.  If the modem does not 
                  detect a dial tone when the tome 
                  in Register S6 elapses, you will 
                  receive the NO DIALTONE (or 6) 
                  response.

S7   Wait time for carrier.
   Range       Default

   1-60 seconds   40      Register S7 tells the modem how 
                  many seconds to wait for a remote 
                  modem's carrier signal before 
                  hanging up.  the register value can 
                  be increased if the modem does 
                  not detect a carrier within the 
                  specified time.  If the modem 
                  detects a remote carrier signal 
                  within the specified time, it sends 
                  a CONNECT response and enters 
                  Data Mode.  If it does not detect a 
                  remote carrier signal within the 
                  specified time, it sends the NO 
                  CARRIER (or 3) response, hangs up 
                  and returns to the Command 
                  Mode.

S8   Pause time for comma.
   Range       Default

   0-255 seconds   2      Register S8 tells the modem how 
                  many seconds to pause for each 
                  comma (,) it encounters in a Dial 
                  command line.  The comma is used 
                  when dialing through a PBX or 
                  other special telephone service to 
                  wait for an outside telephone line.  
                  An alternative to changing this 
                  register value is to include more 
                  than one comma in your command 
                  line.

S9   Carrier Detect response time.
   Range       Default

   1-255      06      Register S9 tells the modem how 
   1/10 seconds         long the remote modem's carrier 
                  signal must be present so the 
                  modem does not mistake the 
                  signal for a busy signal, ring, or 
                  voice.  The factory setting requires 
                  the modem to listen to the carrier 
                  signal for at least 0.6       
                  seconds before recognizing it.  
                  Increasing the time in this register 
                  reduces the chances that the 
                  modem will mistake noise such as 
                  a busy signal or voice for a carrier 
                  signal.  For example, entering a 
                  value 15 means that the remote 
                  modem's carrier signal must be 
                  present for 1.5 seconds for the 
                  modem to recognize it.

S10    Carrier loss time.
   Range       Default

   1-255      14      Register S10 sets the time    
   1/10 seconds         between the loss of a remote 
                  modem's carrier signal and when 
                  the modem disconnects.  This 
                  allows the remote modem's carrier 
                  signal to momentarily disappear 
                  from the telephone line without 
                  the modem disconnecting.  the 
                  factory setting can be changed to a 
                  higher value when a noisy    
                  telephone line that might interfere 
                  with the remote modem's carrier 
                  signal.  To have the modem ignore 
                  the Data Carrier Detect status and 
                  act as if the remote modem' s 
                  carrier signal is always present, 
                  set the value to 255.  Assigning a 
                  value smaller than the value in 
                  Register S9 causes the modem to 
                  disconnect when it detects a 
                  momentary carrier less, because 
                  Register S10 expires before the 
                  carrier response time expires.


S-Register               Description
S11   Range      Default
   
   50-255 ms   75      Register S11 controls the speed of 
                  the Touch-Tone (DTMF) dialing.  
                  Increasing the register value to 
                  255 slows the dialing rate to 1.9 
                  digits per second.  Do not select a 
                  value less than 50 milliseconds.  
                  (Register S11 has no effect on 
                  pulse dialing, which is fixed at 10 
                  pulses per second.)

S12   Return to data mode timer.
   Range      Default

   0-255 1/50 seconds   40   Register S12 controls the time 
                  delay before typing the escape 
                  characters.  Register S12 controls 
                  the time before returning to data 
                  mode after receiving escape 
                  characters unless "AT" command 
                  is received.

   Range       Default

   Bit Mapped   007      Register S23 is a bit-mapped 
                  register and provides the    
                  following test functions    
                  (equivalent commands are shown 
                  in parentheses):

S25   DTR Delay.
   Range      Default

   0-255 seconds   5      If the &M1 command is in effect, 
                  Register S25 specifies the number 
                  of seconds that the modem waits 
                  after a connection has been made 
                  before examining the DTR lead.  
                  This delay allows a asynchronous 
                  terminal to be detached from the 
                  modem and a synchronous    
                  terminal connection while    
                  remaining in the Data Mode.  After 
                  this delay S25 reverts to    
                  hundredths of seconds.

S26   RTS/CTS Delay
   Range      Default

   0-255 hundreds   001   Sync Mode only.  Register S2                           
   of seconds            specifies the time in hundreds
                  of second increments, of the 
                  delay between RTS and the CTS 
                  response.   

S27   Test Function
   Bit mapped      49H   Register S27 is a bit-mapped

S30   Automatic Timeout.
   Range      Default   Register S30 specifies the number 
   0-255      0      of seconds the modem waits 
                  without activity, before    
                  disconnecting.  Timing is in 10 
                  second increments.










S36   Negotiation Faltback
   Range      Default

                  connect in error-control mode 
                  fails, S36 specifies what should 
                  occur next.

                     buffering.

Note: The selected fallback option can be initiated immediately with 
S48.  For example, a connection attempt using the MNP can be forced 
by setting S48=128 and S36=5 or 7.



S37   Maximum DCE Line Speed

                  S37 selects the speed (for all 
                  modes except CCITT V.24bis) at 
                  which the modem attempts to 
                  connect with a remote modem; the 
                  speed selected will be the highest 
                  DCE speed supported by both 
                  modems (see S93 for CCITT    
                  V.25bis modes).

S38    Delay Before Forced Hangup

   Range       Default

   0-255      20      S38 specifies the number of 
                  seconds the modem waits when in 
                  error-control mode (&Q5) before 
                  disconnecting after receiving the 
                  command to hang up or an on-to-
                  off transition of DTR.  The range 
                  for this register is 0-255 seconds; 
                  the default to 20 seconds.  If the 
                  register is set to 0, the modem 
                  does not wait for data in the 
                  buffers to clear (gives NO CARRIER 
                  response).  If the register is set to 
                  a value between 0 and 254, the 
                  modem will wait the number of 
                  seconds, or until all data has been 
                  transferred, before hanging up.  
                  (If data clears gives of response, if 
                  not gives NO CARRIER response).  
                  If the register is set to 255, the 
                  modem will not hang up until all 
                  data is transferred.

48   Feature Negotiation Action
   Range      Default

   0, 7, 128      7      Register S48 defines whether 
                  feature negotiation is to be    
                  performed by the modem.  The 
                  feature negotiation process allows 
                  the modem at ascertain the    
                  remote system's capabilities.  If 
                  these capabilities are already 
                  known and negotiation is not 
                  necessary, this feature can be 
                  bypassed.

                  0    Negotiation disabled.   
                     Modem assumes the remote 
                     modem is configured    
                     properly to make a    
                     connection, bypasses the 
                     detection and negotiation 
                     phases, and proceeds with 
                     the protocol selected by 
                     Register S46.

                     bypassing the detection and 
                     negotiation phases.

S49   Buffer Lower Limit
   Range      Default

   0-255      10      S49 specifies the minimum size of 
                  the buffer used in error-control or 
                  automatic speed buffering mode.  
                  The range is 1-255 bytes; the 
                  default setting is 10.

S50   Buffer Upper Limit
   Range      Default

   0-255      200      S50 specifies the maximum size of 
                  the buffer used in error-control of 
                  automatic speed buffering mode.  
                  The range is 2-255 bytes; the 
                  default setting is 200.

S63   Private Circuit Carrier Level
   Range       Default

   0-15         0      S63 specifies the carrier power 
                  level in dBm for leased line    
                  operation.  This register specifies a 
                  carrier level value that is not to be 
                  exceeded.  The range of this 
                  register is 0-15 (0 to - 15 dBm).  
                  The default setting is 0.

S82   Beak Signaling Technique
   Range      Default

   3, 7, 128      128      S82 selects a method of break 
                  signal handling for CCITT V.42 
                  communications: in sequence, 
                  expedited, and destructive.  Break 
                  signals provide a way to get the 
                  attention of the remote host.  The 
                  break type used depends on the 
                  application.

                  3   Expedited signaling used 
                     regardless of sequence in 
                     transmitted and received 
                     data; data integrity    
                     maintained.

                  7   Destructive signaling used 
                     regardless of sequence of 
                     transmitted and received 
                     data; data in process at time 
                     is destroyed.

                  128   In sequence signaling used 
                     as data is transmitted and 
                     received; data integrity 
                     maintained ahead of and 
                     after break.



S86   Connection Failure Cause Code
   Range      Default   

   0, 4-15      None      S86 helps determine the cause of 
                  a connection failure.  When the 
                  modem issues a NO CARRIER 
                  result code, a value is written to 
                  this S-register.  To read this 
                  register following the connection 
                  failure, issue ATS86? <CR>.  The 
                  modem will report one of the
