               * The NUMBER CODE is normally either the subscriber's area code,
                 local exchange, and subscriber loop number, OR a code unique to
                 that individual subscriber. STATEMENTs are used for calls from
                 non Caller ID Areas and subscribers requesting no display.

         "Multiple Page Mode"
           MESG= formatted number string * **
               * Here is an example string: 030A35303339363732343030
                 The string uses this code: CCLL#0#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9
                 CC (03) is the code meaning this is "Multiple Page" Caller ID
                 LL is the hexadecimal length of the data in the string.
                    (in this case 0A hex - 10 decimal)
                 #n's are the ASCII digits dialed (in hexadecimal)
                    A neat trick to convert these to decimal is to note that
                    the first digit is always a number "3" and the second digit
                    is the decimal number dialed, so the formatted string:
                    030A35303339363732343030 converts directly to 5039672400
              ** At the time of this printing, conversion of "Multiple Page"
                    Caller ID string coversion is not supported in the modem,
                    so the data is displayed in the raw hexadecimal format.
         #CID=2 Enable Raw (ASCII printable HEX number) Mode
         #CID=? Returns Caller ID Modes supported.
