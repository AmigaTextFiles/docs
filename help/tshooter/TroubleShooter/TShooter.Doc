direct or indirect use of this program.

Introduction
------------

I wrote this program to help people out of common problems - I hope it helps!

It works in the same way as Teletext - You type in the page number using the
keyboard, Troubleshooter finds it and displays it on the screen.

Using the '+' and '-' keys on the keyboard, you can advance or backtrack one
page.

Special Page Numbers



Hard drive Installation
-----------------------

How do I install Troubleshooter on my hard drive?

Easy!

Create a directory on your hard drive called 'Troubleshooter' or something
like that and insert this disk.

Double-click on the disk icon, and drag the "TShooter" icon over to the new
directory on your hard drive.



Special page numbers in the program
-----------------------------------

P100 - Main Index (the screen which is displayed at the start)

P175 - Test page (allows you to test printers, disk drive, sound and picture)

P199 - Quit (Quits)



Other Stuff ...
---------------

PLEASE do not alter the program, information in the program, or this file.


FREEWARE NOTICE
---------------

This was a Spidersoft Shareware program.  It is now being released as
FREEWARE (although it was never actually released the first time round
anyway).

The entire collection of Spidersoft Shareware can be found on Unsatisfactory
Software's FTP directory (ssoft area) at;
http://www.bigfoot.com/~unsatisfactory/

I wrote this program years ago, so some of the information is either wildly
out-of-date, or massively incomplete.  All the programs mentioned are NOT
included - you can get them (or equivalents) from Aminet.  Must probably
don't work properly under WB3, anyway.

If you have any comments (please don't write to tell me that some
information is incorrect or incomplete or just plain stupid - I know!), then
send them to me (Chris Young) at unsatisfactory@bigfoot.com - please don't
expect too much enthusiasm from me on the subject of Spidersoft programs...
