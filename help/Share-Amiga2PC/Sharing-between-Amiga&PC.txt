FAQ: Sharing files between Amigas and PCs
-----------------------------------------

Current and former Amiga users often ask about getting files between
Amigas and PCs; this FAQ should give you some ideas about how to do it
and answer most of the common questions.

This FAQ was written by Ben Hutchings <benjamin.hutchings@worc.ox.ac.uk>.

This is version 0.4 of the FAQ, dated 18 April 1998.  There are
probably many bugs and omissions; please report them to me as soon as
possible.  If you have any hints, comments, or experiences to share,
please send to me too.

I would particularly appreciate information about:

* transferring files with HyperTerminal (I've used it before
  successfully but forgot how after I deleted Windows!)
* transferring files with ProComm
* using the Netware client for Amiga
* sharing files on Zip/Syquest disks

1  Floppy disks
----------------


1.1  Obstacles to sharing
-------------------------

There are 3 problems with sharing floppy disks:

1.  Most Amigas have only a DD (double-density) floppy drive, and can't
    deal with the HD (high-density) floppy disks which are now standard
    for PCs.
2.  The Amiga disk drive controller is quite flexible within the
    limitations of (1); it can write up to 12 sectors on a track, and it
    doesn't require any gaps between them.  Unfortunately PC floppy disk
    controllers need gaps and markers to separate sectors.
3.  Most PCs use software from some tiny cowboy operation called
    Microsoft, which has an obscure file-system all of its own.  Amigas
    have a nice whizzy file-system with comments and lots of file
    attributes, which PCs don't know about.


1.2  The compromises
--------------------

To get round these obstacles, you have to make some compromises, and go
for the lowest common denominator in each area:

1.  Don't use HD disks.  Use only DD disks, and format them on the
    Amiga (see below for how to do this).  HD floppy drives cannot
    format DD disks reliably; you will usually get some errors when
    you try to read the data back on the Amiga.
2.  You have to use a 9-sector format with sector gaps on the disks.
3.  You have to make your Amiga use the same Microsoft file-system
    on the disks.


1.3  Amiga software
-------------------

Now to make the Amiga stoop to this level, you need some appropriate
driver software.  There are several such packages:

1.  MessyDOS.  A freeware product; said to be better than CrossDOS
    in many ways.  It works fine under release 1.3 and later.

2.  CrossDOS.  This is a fairly up-to-date commercial product.  A
    limited version of this is included with AmigaOS releases 2.1, 3.0
    and 3.1 - i.e. with all A1200s and A4000s, and with late A600s.
    The commercial version 7.0, for OS 2.0+ is available from
    Consultron <URL:http://www.cucug.org/consultron/>; they also sell
    version 5.0 which will run on OS 1.3.  Thanks to Tony Friery and
    Dale Frameli for this information.

3.  MultiDOS.  This is freeware, and can be found on Aminet as
    misc/emu/multidos1_12.lzh.  It's not as well documented as MSH,
    but it has the advantage of being more transparent - you can
    access both Amiga and MS-DOS disks as "DF0:" etc.  If you can't
    download this onto an Amiga or Amiga disk you may have some
    trouble.  See the section on serial transfer for some hints.

I won't give any instructions for MSH or MultiDOS - there are
instructions included with them.  I guess that most active Amiga users
are likely to have CrossDOS, and some limited documentation that came
with their computer.  Therefore I've written some fairly extensive
instructions for it.

1.3.1  CrossDOS
---------------

The Amiga has a very flexible way of dealing with device drivers and
filesystems, so you can add them easily at any time.  If the Amiga user
only wants to deal with PC floppies occasionally it's a waste of memory
to load the appropriate device driver every time the computer boots; if
he's using them very often then it's an annoyance to have to load it
manually before using any such disks.  You decide which way you want to
do things.

1.3.1.1  Installing CrossDOS drivers
------------------------------------

To make sure the appropriate drivers are loaded every time the computer
boots, you need to copy some files, which you can do by dragging icons
on the Workbench.

WARNING: If you have no hard disk and use floppies to boot your Amiga,
you should use *copies* of your Workbench disk and other system disks,
rather than the original.  *Never* modify your Workbench disk - store it
away somewhere safe.  This might seem obvious, but many people just
ignore the warning in their manuals, so if you are one of them please
take note and protect your valuable software!

OS 2.1, floppies:  Open the windows for your Workbench disk and for the
                   Extras disk.  On the Extras disk you will find a
                   "DOSDrivers" drawer.  Open that, and drag the icon
                   "PC0" from it to the WBStartup drawer on your
                   Workbench disk.  If you have only one floppy drive,
                   you will find it easier to drag to the Ram Disk,
                   change floppies, and then complete the operation.

OS 2.1, hard disk: Open the windows for your System partition and for
                   the Extras disk.  On the Extras disk you will find
                   a "DOSDrivers" drawer.  Open that, and drag the
                   icon "PC0" from it to the WBStartup drawer on your
                   System partition.

OS 3.x, floppies:  Open the windows for your Workbench disk, the Devs
                   drawer of your Workbench disk, the Storage disk,
                   and the DOSDrivers drawer of the Storage disk.
                   Drag the icon "PC0" from the DOSDrivers drawer on
                   Storage to the DOSDrivers drawer in Devs.

OS 3.x, hard disk: Open the windows for your System partition, the
                   Devs drawer, the Storage drawer, and the DOSDrivers
                   drawer inside the Storage drawer.  Drag the icon
                   "PC0" from the last drawer to the DOSDrivers drawer
                   inside Devs.

The drivers will not be loaded until you reboot; after this they will be
loaded every time you boot.

External drives
---------------

The above instructions only cover the internal floppy disk drive,
normally accessed as DF0.  If you want to install drivers for using an
external floppy disk drive (DF1) substitute "PC1" for "PC0" above.  For
further disk drives (DF2, DF3), make a copy of the PC0 or PC1 icon,
rename it appropriately, and change the UNIT tooltype in the icon
information to read UNIT=2 or UNIT=3 as appropriate.

Uninstallation
--------------

OS 3.x, hard disk:    Open the appropriate drawers, and drag the "PC0"
                      icon back to where it came from.

Other configurations: Delete the copy of the "PC0" icon from where
                      you put it.

1.3.1.2  Loading CrossDOS drivers manually
------------------------------------------

This depends on your system configuration.

OS 2.1:            Insert the Extras disk, open its icon, and open the
                   DOSDrivers drawer inside it.  Then double-click the
                   PC0 icon inside that.

OS 3.x, floppies:  Insert the Storage disk, open its icon, and open the
                   DOSDrivers drawer inside it.  Then double-click the
                   PC0 icon inside that.

OS 3.x, hard disk: Open the icon for your system partition, the
                   Storage drawer inside it, and the DOSDrivers drawer
                   inside that.  Then double-click the PC0 icon inside
                   that.

External drives
---------------

The above instructions only cover the internal floppy disk drive,
normally accessed as DF0.  If you want to load the drivers for an
external floppy disk drive (DF1) substitute "PC1" for "PC0" above.  For
further disk drives (DF2, DF3), make a copy of the PC0 or PC1 icon,
rename it appropriately, and change the UNIT tooltype in the icon's
information to read UNIT=2 or UNIT=3 as appropriate.

1.3.1.3  Using CrossDOS
-----------------------

Once the CrossDOS drivers are loaded, the Amiga deals with MS-DOS
disks just like native Amiga disks - with the difference that they
appear in the drive PCn: instead of DFn: (n=0,1,2,3).  One side-effect
of using two different drive names is that when you insert a disk you
will get a "bad disk" icon for whichever drive isn't appropriate to
it.  (This won't happen for PCn: if you don't actually install the
driver.)  You can get round this by using MultiFileSystem.  However,
this uses some slightly dubious software tricks, and it quickly
crashed my system, although I know it works fine for many people.

There is a program called "CrossDOS", which you can find in the
Commodities drawer of the Tools drawer of your Extras disk or boot
partition, which lets you change some aspects of CrossDOS behaviour.
These are useful for dealing with text files.  If you want to read a
plain text file created on a PC, you will normally want to select both
"Text Conversion" and "Character Translation".  For all other files,
you must be sure to turn these options off, otherwise the files will
be corrupted.  The CrossDOS program is a commodity, so you can pop its
window up with a hot key at any time once it's loaded.  See your
manual for information about commodities.



2  Serial and parallel transfer
-------------------------------

If the Amiga and PC are close together, or can temporarily be brought
together, it may be easier to wire them up using appropriate ports, and
transfer files that way.  The advantages of this are that you don't need
to worry about disk formats, you don't need to move things round, and
you usually get automatic error correction and other nice features.
You'll need a cable of some sort and appropriate software to do this.


2.1  Serial transfer
--------------------

This is very slow, unless you have enhanced ports on both the Amiga and
PC which can handle up to 115,200 bps, in which case it's just plain
slow.  However, you probably won't need to unplug anything else to do
this, so there's one advantage.

2.1.1  The hardware for serial transfer
---------------------------------------

First, you need to get a "null-modem cable".  This are readily
available in good computer shops, and cost about $10 or about twice as
much in local currency in Europe.  Before you go out and buy one,
check what kind of serial port you have free on the PC - it should be
either 9-pin or 25-pin.  The Amiga's built-in serial port is 25-pin;
some expansion cards provide 9-pin ports, but I'm sure you know that
if you've bought such a thing.  Be sure to get an appropriate cable!
I use a universal null-modem cable which has both 9- and 25-pin plugs
on both ends, which cost me £15 ($25); this lets me connect just
about any two standard-ish serial ports together.

2.1.2  The software for serial transfer
---------------------------------------

It's possible to do serial transfers using PC2Am (section 2.2.2), but
you can also use terminal programs if you prefer.

There's a simple terminal program in Windows 3, and one supplied with
most "integrated" packages like Microsoft Works, but these aren't very
good.  I've heard ProComm is one of the best under DOS.  The
HyperTerminal program that comes with Windows 95 is reasonably good.

Under Linux, I've found minicom to be adequate, but I think there are
better programs around.  Minicom is included in the RedHat 4.2 and 5.0
distributions of Linux.

On the Amiga, I use term.  However, term likes to have about 2M of
memory and needs OS 2.0.  A more lightweight comms program, which will
run under OS 1.2 and OS 1.3 as well, is NComm.  This still needs 1M of
RAM though, so if you have less than this you'll have to search for
something smaller still.  The smallest terminal programs I could find
on Aminet that would be useful for file transfer are amigaterm,
AmigaDisplay, AZComm and Vt100.

If you've not got any terminal software or PC floppy disk drivers, and
you can only download onto your PC, you've got a problem starting off
here.  For this reason, Tony Friery has written a set of BASIC
programs (for AmigaBasic and QBASIC) that you can easily type in and
then use to transfer a terminal program across.  (You'll need LhA for
DOS as well, of course.)

2.1.3  How to do serial transfers
---------------------------------

First, connect the two machines' serial ports using the cable.
According to the RS232 standard, it should be safe to do this while
the computers are on, but you might want to turn them off just to be
absolutely safe.  If your PC already has a mouse plugged in with a
9-pin plug, chances are that it's plugged into the "COM1" port, and the
port you'll be using is "COM2".  Otherwise you're probably going to be
using "COM1".

You need to set up both communications packages with identical
settings.

Bits:           8
Parity:         none
Stop bits:      1
Duplex:         full
Handshaking/
Flow Control:   hardware (also called "RTS/CTS")

(PC) port:      COM1 or COM2 as described above
(Amiga) device: serial.device, unless using an add-on serial port

Here's how to enter these settings in various programs.

HyperTerminal: When asked to select a connection to make, choose
	       to create a new connection.
minicom:       Press Ctrl-A, O, then select "Serial port setup".
               Most of the settings are under item E.
NComm:         Select settings on the Com menu.
term:          Select the menu item Settings > Serial.

You also need to set the connection rate.  This is measured in bits
per second (bps, sometimes wrongly called baud).  Start by setting
both sides to 14,400 bps, then type some stuff at either keyboard, and
make sure it comes out OK on the other computer's screen.  If you
can't get that far, refer to your documentation or a local comms
expert.  I don't want to have to help people debug their serial
connections, as I'm no expert on this.  If this all works OK, next try
transferring some files across.

On the computer sending files, set the transfer protocol to Zmodem.

minicom:       You have to set this every time you send a file.
NComm:         Select the menu item Transfer > Protocol > Zmodem.
term:          Select the menu item Settings > Transfer protocols,
               select the Default Protocol tab, set Type to "XPR
               library" and Name to "xprzmodem.library".

Then tell it to upload a file.

minicom:       Press Ctrl-A, then S, select zmodem, then enter the
	       filename.
NComm:         Press RightAmiga-U and select the file.
term:          Press RightAmiga-U and select the file.

The other computer should automatically start to receive the file.  If
this doesn't work, and you get messages about "CRC errors" which the
receiving end can't recover from, try a lower transfer rate (on both
computers).  If it went OK, try progressively raising the transfer
rate until you *do* get lots of errors, then use the highest rate
which was OK.  Also make sure that files can be transferred correctly
in both directions.

Once everything works, save the settings so you can use them every time
you want to transfer files.


2.2  Parallel transfers
-----------------------

Parallel transfers are quite a bit faster than serial transfers; in
fact, they're probably faster than using floppy disks.  However, there
isn't so much choice of software for doing parallel transfers.

2.2.1  Hardware for parallel transfers
--------------------------------------

You need a 25-pin parallel-to-parallel cable, commonly sold as a
"Laplink cable", after the popular program Laplink which does just what
we want to do here but only between PCs.  Availability is much the same
as for null modem cables (see section 2.1.1).

2.2.2  Software for parallel transfers
--------------------------------------

PC2Am lets you access a PC's drives as subdirectories of a new Amiga
drive called PC.  For instance, to read the PC's AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
run "more pc:c/autoexec.bat" on the Amiga.  You can use your favourite
Amiga directory utility, or the Shell, or the Workbench, to transfer
files either way.  This requires AmigaOS 2.0 or later and MS-DOS 6.x
or Windows 95 on the PC.

2.2.3  How to do parallel transfers
-----------------------------------

You should start by reading the PC2Am documentation!  However, there are
some potential problems with PC2Am that aren't mentioned there.

1.  Some Amiga programs (I've seen DOpus mentioned) may have problems
    copying large files through it.

2.  The TSR version is not as reliable as the ordinary version, and
    neither will work very well under Windows. If you must run PC2Am
    under Windows, keep the DOS window active and set its priority
    high (using the PIF Editor under Windows 3.x or the Properties
    menu item under Windows 95).

3.  Be sure to quit the Amiga side before the PC side.	If you quit the
    PC side first, the Amiga side may not be able to clean up properly.

Thanks to Thomas Tavoly for points 2 and 3.


3  Networking
-------------

There are a variety of networking solutions for the Amiga.  I've
included brief details of these, but for more information, you should
read the Amiga networking FAQ. You can find the two parts of this in
the newsgroup comp.sys.amiga.datacomm or on the web as
<URL:http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/amiga.networking
-faq.part1.html> and <URL:http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/
archive/amiga.networking-faq.part2.html> (and probably at many other
sites, but this is the closest to me!).

You need to have:

* Networking hardware (modem, null-modem, Ethernet or Arcnet)
* An appropriate device driver
* A network stack (TCP/IP or IPX/SPX)
* Some kind of file-sharing / file transfer applications
  (SMB, FTP, NFS or Netware)

You can't just pick and mix these - the following diagram should show
how these things fit together:

+-------+ +-------+ +-------+  +----------------------+  -------------

|     network    | |     network    | |     | | modem |
+----------------+ +----------------+ +-----+ +-------+  -------------



3.1  Hardware
-------------

You can do what most people do, and use a modem with a driver for
dialup access to the Internet or a private TCP/IP network (I guess).

You can also use a null modem cable to create a private network
between the two computers directly.

Finally, there are a number of Ethernet and Arcnet cards available,
and you should be able to fit one to most Amiga models.


3.2  Drivers
------------

Arcnet and Ethernet cards should come with appropriate drivers.
Serial interfaces should also have serial drivers, but on top of
those you'll need a PPP or SLIP driver to turn them into network
interfaces.  Each of the TCP/IP network stacks is supplied with
a PPP driver included, as far as I know.

Setting up PPP drivers
----------------------

First, you need to pick IP (Internet Protocol) addresses for the two
computers.  Unless you already have a LAN set up, in which case you've
probably gone through this already, I'd suggest using the addresses
192.168.1.1 on the PC and 192.168.1.2 on the Amiga (which is what I
use myself).  These are the addresses I've used in the examples below.

You'll also need to decide what data rate to use on the serial line.
For an unaccelerated A500, 600, 1200 or 2000, I'd suggest 19200 bps;
with a 68020 or 68030 you should be able to manage 38400 bps; a 68040
or 68060 can handle 57600 bps.  If you have a buffered serial port,
you should be able to use 115,200 bps.  Most PCs have buffered serial
ports and can handle this rate too.

Amiga, ppp.device
-----------------

This is shareware.  It was written by Holger Kruse and so is
effectively obsoleted by his later program Miami, which combines a
network stack and PPP drive for higher performance.

In the configuration file (normally ENVARC:SANA2/ppp0.config) put:

    7WIRE EOFMODE SERBAUD=57600 SERNAME=serial.device IPADDR=192.168.1.2

Adjust the transfer rate, device driver or IP address if you need to!

Amiga, AmiPPP
-------------

This is shareware.  I couldn't figure out how to use it properly, but
here's how to do the configuration:

Select New.

Select Config, and set the Phone Number and Modem Init to empty
strings.  Select IPCP Config and set the Local IP Address to
192.168.1.2.  Deselect the "Will" options for IP Address and IP
Addresses and select the "Want" options for them.  Select OK twice.

Select Serial, and change the Device and Baud rate if you need to.
Then close that window.

Amiga, Miami 3.0
----------------

Run MiamiInit.  Select a "nullmodem" connection, and turn off the
"Internet" and "DNS" options.  Then continue to the next stage.

Select the appropriate serial driver.

Select the PPP protocol and a static IP address.  Enter the IP address
192.168.1.2.  Then continue to the next stage.

Eeek!  MiamiInit crashes at this point on my machine.

Linux, ppp-2.3
--------------

Run a command something like this (all on one line) as root:

pppd /dev/ttyS0 57600 crtscts lock mru 296 mtu 296 passive
    192.168.1.1 -detach local netmask 255.255.255.0 &

Adjust the serial device (/dev/ttyS0), rate (57600) and IP address as
needed.

Windows 95
----------

You need to have Dial-Up Networking and TCP/IP installed.  You also
need to download a null modem INF file.


3.3  Network stacks
-------------------

Virtually all Amiga networking software is based on TCP/IP.  These are
the protocols used by the Internet; they can also be used on a local-
area network, even a network consisting of just two computers (the
Amiga and PC in question).

There are two "standard" TCP/IP protocol stacks for the Amiga, called
AS-225 and AmiTCP.  Some programs only work with one or the other, but
most work with both.

There is a Novell Netware client available for the Amiga, but it's not
cheap and isn't fully supported any more.  It's now distributed by
Interworks, and you can find details on their web pages at
<URL:http://www.iworks.com/iw/oxxi_t.html>.  I believe it's also
possible to make Netware servers run an NFS service over TCP/IP, so
you may also be able to share files with Netware servers that way.

AmiTCP is a commercial product.  You can download a demo from Aminet.
It is quite tough to set up, but is very powerful and flexible.

AS-225r1 is old, obsolete, and unsupported.

AS-225r2 was released only to developers by Commodore.

I-Net 225 is what AS-225 evolved into after its development was taken
over by Interworks; it is a commercial product.  It is included in the
"Amiga Surfer" pack.  See <URL:http://www.iworks.com/iw/inet225.html>
for details of the product and distributors.

Miami is shareware, and compatible with AmiTCP; you can download the
evaluation version from Aminet.

TermiteTCP is a commercial product published by Oregon Research.  It
is compatible with AmiTCP.  I don't know who it's distributed by,
except in the UK where I think HiSoft is the exclusive distributor.
See <URL:http://www.hisoft.co.uk/termitetcp/> for details.  It can
only make dialup connections.

MLink (or Multilink) is shareware.  It is compatible with both AmiTCP
and AS-225.  It connects to Multilink on a Unix machine (e.g. a PC
running Linux) via a serial link to make a TCP/IP connection between
the two.  It cannot use any other networking hardware.

Envoy is a TCP/IP stack, but it provides Amiga-specific servers rather
than socket-based things.  It is not useful for networking Amigas to
PCs, as far as I know.


3.4  Applications
-----------------

Samba
-----

Samba is a free software package which includes a client and servers
for Microsoft networking (as used by LanManager, Windows for
Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT).  It runs on top of any Amiga
TCP/IP stack, so you must have one installed on the Amiga and on the
PCs you want to connect to.

The Samba program "smbclient" lets you transfer files much like a
conventional command-line FTP client.  First, you must make sure that
the appropriate directory on the PC is shared and has appropriate
permissions associated with it.  Then, on the Amiga, enter the
command:

smbclient \\<remote-name>\<share-name>
	  -I <remote-address> -U <username> -W <workgroup>

where:

<remote-name> is the remote machine's machine name within Microsoft
	      networking (*not* the IP hostname)
<share-name> is the name under which the drive/directory is shared (c$
	     will usually be the machine's local drive C: and
	     <username>$ will usually be your home directory)
<remote-address> is the IP address or domain name of the remote
		 machine
<username> is the name of a user entitled to access this share
	   (normally, your personal username)
<workgroup> is the workgroup/domain that <username> belongs to

You will normally be asked for the user's password.  Then you get a
prompt, just like in ftp.  Enter "help" for a list of commands.

Samba also includes a server you can use to share directories/drives
on your Amiga with machines using Microsoft networking, but I've never
done this myself so you'll have to read up on this in the Samba
documents to find out how to do it.

FTP
---

There are two possible ways to use FTP for file transfer.

If you have both machines on the Internet, and an account somewhere
else that you can store files in using FTP, then you can use that as
temporary storage for the files.

Alternatively, you can set up an FTP server on one of the machines.
Most Linux distributions should have an FTP server (typically wu-ftpd)
included.  You can also get wu-ftpd for the Amiga.  It's free
software.

NFS
---

It should be possible to access files using Sun's NFS, as there is an
NFS client included with AmiTCP.  You'll need to have an NFS server
running on the PC, which is only practical if you have some flavour of
UNIX on the PC.  I've found this to be unreliable across the
null-modem connection I have.  I think NFS only works well over
high-speed networks like Ethernet.

Netware
-------

I would appreciate some details of how this works.



4  Hard disks
-------------

My experience has been with an Amiga hard disk in a PC running Linux,
temporarily installed while my Amiga was out of action due to hardware
failures.

Linux 2.x includes an Amiga file-system implementation and can read
Amiga RDBs to locate the partitions on an Amiga hard disk.  I think
most Linux distributions will include this as a module.  You can check
for it by running "modprobe affs" (as root).  If yours doesn't, you'll
need to compile it.  Set "Amiga FFS filesystem support" to compile as
a module (in the file-systems section of kernel config).  Then run
"make dep ; make modules ; make install".  You'll also need to
re-compile the kernel itself to get Amiga RDB support.

Once you've got this working, you should see a partition listing
beginning with RDSK when you boot with an Amiga hard drive connected.
Then you can mount Amiga partitions using the mount command with type
set to "affs".  Apparently it has a fsck (disk validation) program
built in, unlike other Linux file-systems.  I have had problems occur
when I lost power with an FFS file-system mounted.  If you want to be
completely safe, I suggest you mount FFS file-systems read-only.
