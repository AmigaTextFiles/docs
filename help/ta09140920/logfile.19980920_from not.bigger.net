06.03.30 #       <StG^sNTx> any news?
06.09.57 #       <Merko> Not that I've heard. I guess you've heard the rumours that FusionPPC is already in beta though.. :)
06.29.52 #       <Nixon^99> need l6a
06.31.29 #       <Agima> Anyone here any good with C?
06.33.16 #       <Jamesc> I'm kinda tied up right now... And I'm only fair :)
06.33.25 #       <Jamesc> Try Rattling the cage again a little later :)
06.36.59 #       <Blitmanic> I know a little C
06.38.00 #       <Agima> Enough to be able to convert a date to something decent? :)
06.38.47 #       <Nixon^99> need l6a 
06.39.27 #       <Blitmanic> hmm , not sure what you mean

06.40.16 #       <Agima> Blitmanic : Someone I know is having trouble with DateToStr - it keeps returning the number of seconds since 1/1/1978 AFAIK
06.40.30 #       <Agima> If you could mail me some source (peter@amigauni.u-net.com) I'll forward it to him
06.41.35 #       <Nixon^99> l6a x (****.l6a)
06.41.48 #       <Blitmanic> hmm, well I never done anything with Date functions before
06.41.59 #       <Agima> Oh well, s'OK
06.42.34 #       <Nixon^99> need i7 n0\/\/
06.42.40 #       <Blitmanic> but can he just convert the seconds into month day etc.?
06.43.13 #       <Agima> I guess not, he probably hasn't tried. He's not too hot with C

09.23.47 #       <TA> any of you using PPaint7.1?
09.23.48 #       <DrJekyl> :)
09.23.53 #       <DrJekyl> not mornin here ;)
09.24.04 #       <DrJekyl> TA: nope 7.0 only :(
09.24.08 #       <Rocambole> hello all
09.24.10 #       <DrJekyl> Rocambole 
09.24.34 #       <Rocambole> what's up today?
09.24.37 #       <TA> DrJekyl: Do you know how to crop an image? I have made a logo and I need the background transparent or the image cropped.
09.24.57 #       <TA> can't find either in the docs.
09.26.03 #       <TA> Building buttons, etc for ICOA-Net ...
09.27.30 #       <DrJekyl> re
09.27.35 #       <TA> was that fun?  :)
09.28.00 #       <DrJekyl> it sucked a little coz I coundn't getr back on :/
09.28.11 #       <TA> :)
09.28.38 #       <TA> DrJekyl: Do you know how to crop an image? I have made a logo and I need the background transparent or the image cropped.
09.29.04 #       <TA> I'm building buttons and such for the ICOA_Net pages.
09.29.45 #       <DrJekyl> tranparent is easy, make the first colour in the palette the "invisable" colour and save as a gif
09.30.02 #       <TA> How do I do that though?
09.30.21 #       <DrJekyl> TA: Hmm... wanna sent it over ? :)
09.30.27 #       <TA> I can't find it in the docs.
09.30.41 #       <TA> I actually need to learn how ... :(
09.31.24 #       <DrJekyl> ok, the first colour in the palette is the one to make "invisable". make sense so far ?
09.31.31 #       <Rocambole> hmmm....maybe that could be a topic for a conference ;)
09.31.59 #       <TA> yues, but I can't find the tool or pull down to do that.
09.32.21 #       <DrJekyl> so make color 0 = bright green or something that you will not mistake for a colour in the image
09.32.40 #       <TA> dang it.
09.33.38 #       <TA> Yes, I think I will see if Cloanto will have someone come online here for a conference. They have some good programs, worthy of our time.
09.33.45 #       <DrJekyl> grr.. :
09.34.13 #       <DrJekyl> TA: how much of that did you get ?
09.34.15 #       <Rocambole> TA: :)) would be great
09.34.26 #       <TA> DrJekyl: After I have color 0 something I can distinguish, how do I make color 0 invisible?
09.35.02 #       <DrJekyl> TA: pick the image up as a brush, with color 0 set for the BG color.
09.35.21 #       <Merko> Crop images in PPaint? I'll see.. 
09.35.26 #       <TA> It says something about savinhg as a brush, but the save brush is ghosted at that point?
09.35.49 #       <DrJekyl> <F6>   save brush IIRC
09.36.07 #       <Merko> TA: Well, is it a big picture?
09.36.40 #       <DrJekyl> but you need to select save as gif screen mode unselected and the other (I cant remember it atm) selected
09.36.49 #       <TA> here's what I have done, clicked the "A", pulled up a chisel font (Kara Font), have the image and BG on screen, now I want to save as a brush, except "save brush" is ghosted.
09.37.28 #       <TA> Merko: It is full screen if you count the BG which I do not want.
09.37.29 #       <DrJekyl> TA: can you save the whole image ?
09.37.44 #       <DrJekyl> TA: what color is the BG ?
09.37.53 #       <TA> DrJekyl: Yes, that is how it saves ONLY. BG is deep blue.
09.38.05 #       <TA> Font is a chrome font.
09.38.29 #       <DrJekyl> ok select that colour in the pallete with the right IIRC mouse button
09.38.38 #       <TA> ok
09.38.48 #       <DrJekyl> blue should now show as the selected BG
09.38.54 #       <TA> ok
09.39.04 #       <DrJekyl> click on the pickup brush icon
09.39.10 #       <Merko> TA: Well, cut it out and either save it as a brush or paste it in the top corner and change size of the picture without rescaling.
09.39.15 #       <TA> which one is that?
09.39.27 #       <DrJekyl> hang on I'll have to check :)
09.39.36 #       <Merko> It's a box.
09.39.49 #       <TA> Merko: I can't find the tool to cut the image. That is the second problem I have.
09.40.04 #       <TA> Merko: Click with right or left mouse?
09.40.10 #       <DrJekyl> TA: the one directly above the magnifying glass
09.40.18 #       <Merko> TA: Well, above the magnifying glass, besides the crown.
09.40.21 #       <DrJekyl> left
09.40.47 #       <DrJekyl> right will pick it up (dodgy if you mess the initial one up)
09.40.57 #       <DrJekyl> TA: got it ?
09.40.59 #       <Merko> TA: LMB to cut out a new brush. RMB to use an old brush.
09.41.15 #       <TA> DrJekyl: OK,  I tried clicking the box to crop and then what ? Put the curser on the screen cenetered on the image and enlarge the box to the size I want?
09.41.27 #       <DrJekyl> Merko: 7.1 differs slightly from 7.0 then
09.42.04 #       <DrJekyl> TA: no, drag it over the entire image you want
09.42.09 #       <DrJekyl> like making a box
09.42.40 #       <TA> ok, thanks guys. I wish there was a place in the docs that says what those little symbols mean ... :(
09.43.18 #       <TA> Maybe I just missed it, but OI think I have searched pretty good.
09.43.30 #       <Merko> TA: I guess you are supposed to find out by experimenting.. perhaps..
09.43.38 #       <TA> Their docs do go ionto great detail about the amiga though.
09.44.11 #       <TA> Merko: Been doing that for a week. Could have 2 gigs of saved crap by now if I had saved it all.
09.44.34 #       <TA> Can I put a box on screen and then work inside that box by starting with the box icon?
09.44.55 #       <TA> Say I want to build buttons all the same width?
09.45.55 #       <DrJekyl> TA: make one outline and paste it out a few times
09.46.01 #       <Merko> TA: Not really.. you'll have to draw a box and then cut it out, or you can change dimensions of the screen to whatever you like, but then you can only work on one button at a time.
09.46.42 #       <TA> ok, thanks a lot guys. No wonder they call this the help channel!!  :)
09.46.51 #       <DrJekyl> :)
09.47.08 #       * DrJekyl is also talking someone through C4D on Arcnet ;)
09.47.37 #       <TA> haha, that will be my next project as soon as the CU Amiga hits my doorstep from Software Hut.
09.47.41 #       <Rocambole> TA: nice to have a place to get help when needed :)
09.48.25 #       <TA> Yes, no one was here last nite so I asked on #amiga on amiganet.org and got ignored. All they wanted to do was get info about AI.
09.48.51 #       <Rocambole> TA: we are not ignoring anyone here :)
09.49.11 #       <Merko> Rocambole: Well, most of the time there's noone here to ignore in the first place. ;D
09.49.16 #       <TA> They talked and chatted, just ignored questions about PPaint.
09.50.13 #       <TA> We are scheduling a Corba conference, an all around OO language conference, an Amiga Inc conference just after MAE, and Fleecy will be logging in here from MAE to keep us updated.
09.50.41 #       <TA> Amiga Inc will make a couple of nice announces from MAE IF all goes well.
09.50.48 #       <DrJekyl> MAE ?
09.50.54 #       <Rocambole> TA: Great, but I guess we have to advertise it in due time :)
09.50.59 #       <TA> Fleecy will be here to make them to us personally.
09.51.21 #       <TA> October 2-4 I believe in Ohio.
09.52.05 #       <Rocambole> TA: would be great with news from AI
09.52.05 #       <Merko> What's Corba?
09.52.17 #       <TA> Rocamble: We will NOT be making the announce about Fleecy coming here. He is doing that on his own time and as our friend rather than as an AI employee. In other words, no scheduled event, just as he gets time.
09.53.00 #       <Rocambole> TA: ok, just for the inner circle then ;)
09.53.03 #       <TA> He is going to be our 'reporter from the WOA in Columbus' I guess you could say, but with limited time.
09.53.26 #       <Rocambole> hello brinto 
09.53.28 #       <TA> You can spread that he will be here off and on, we just don't know what facilities he can hog, etc.  :)
09.53.39 #       <Rocambole> TA: ok :)
09.53.51 #       <TA> AI should have a booth with a line, if so, we will see a lot of him.
09.54.00 #       <TA> If not, he will come on when he can.
09.54.21 #       <Rocambole> TA: I hope they manage to get online :)
09.54.46 #       <Rocambole> TA: there have been some incidents with bad or no connections at all
09.54.51 #       <TA> He will, even if for a short time.
09.56.48 #       <TA> Dave will probably have his script running as well, so we will get all the feed, plus whatever fleecy brings us.
09.57.04 #       <TA> And the UGN has a nice surprise this time around.
09.57.13 #       <Rocambole> TA: I'm looking forward to it :)
09.57.30 #       <TA> Casey Halverson is working with them on a project that will really show what the Amiga Classic can do vs the pc.
09.58.03 #       <TA> Casey is a genius with push-pull technology and web cam stuff.
09.59.29 #       <TA> Should be an interesting show this time. I suspect small in comparison, but that wil be made up for with some nice touches.
10.00.32 #       <TA> OH, I got my MUI key in email 24 hours after I registered. I wonder why I some people have such problems with them?
10.00.57 #       <Rocambole> TA: I didn't have any probs with it when I registered
10.01.29 #       <TA> I get like 2-3 people begging for my help getting keys every week. That was one reason I registered, just to see what happens.
10.01.52 #       <TA> Same with Vapor keys, but I got all the keys from them in about three days?
10.02.32 #       <Rocambole> TA: hmmm......maybe their email didn't arrive where it should
10.02.36 #       <TA> Miami happened whil e I was online. I thought i would get a key in email, but when I logged off that session, there it was.
10.02.57 #       <TA> I was impressed with Holger's system!!
10.03.28 #       <Rocambole> TA: yes, when I updated from key2 to key3 it was done online
10.03.31 #       <TA> I was told the US sites for Vapor and MUI had problems, but i didn't experience any at all?
10.04.25 #       <TA> Merko: Good thoughts on the TA mailing list, BTW. Great devils advocate stuff. We need that.
10.05.07 #       <TA> Hopefully you can help us come up with a workable plan to present to AI on the topic?
10.06.50 #       <TA> well, back to building web page templates. Thanks for the help Merko!!!
10.07.03 #       <TA> c you guys later.

12.19.50 #       <Rocambole> I had ver 2.0

12.20.21 #       <alanwall> Linus sold to Dave_C
12.21.08 #       <alanwall> Linus:did se somebody has a new serial card let me lok and c if I still have the info
12.23.23 #       <Linus> i've bought an MFC II cheap (2 parallel and 2 serial (small version)) and i'm having a bit of a problem with the serial side
12.23.23 #       <Linus> the parallel ports work fine though
12.24.03 #       <Rocambole> Linus: which driver are you using?
12.24.03 #       <Linus> i'm able to dial my isp but when i'm about to receive something it just stops
12.24.14 #       <alanwall> Dave_C:will u be around 2nite around 9pm your time?
12.24.15 #       <Linus> duart.device
12.24.45 #       <alanwall> Linus:bad file?
12.25.39 #       <Linus> it's created by a program MFC that i put into the expansion drawer
12.25.39 #       <Linus> binddrivers in the startup-sequence execute the program
12.25.43 #       <Linus> i'm btw having a horrible lag time of about ~40s
12.26.09 #       <Rocambole> Linus: which server are you connected to?
12.26.12 #       <Linus> nope. i think it's the prefs program for the duart.device that is the problem
12.27.17 #       <Linus> there's a zillion options and everytime duart.device is used it calls on those options instead of for example those set in Miami (i think)
12.27.39 #       <Linus> dlld.beyondirc.net

12.33.24 #       <alanwall> anybody here have a cd writer?
12.33.24 #       <Rocambole> not me
12.33.38 #       <alanwall> having a problem-been awhile and the first 2 are coasters :(
12.33.51 #       <Rocambole> hello StG^sNTx

12.35.10 #       <StG^sNTx> I was planning a short stop here 2night, but then a 6.7mb mail landed in my mailbox, and I have no idea what. It means I'm stuck here 4 a while:)

12.37.54 #       <Linus> thanks for the driver
12.37.54 #       <StG^sNTx> a bit slow cps roc, but as i said I'm grabbing mail
12.38.18 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: :))
12.38.32 #       <StG^sNTx> any news?
12.38.55 #       <Rocambole> well, yes and no
12.39.26 #       <StG^sNTx> hehe:) looking forward to you explaining that one:)
12.39.31 #       <Linus> can anyone confirm a rumour i heard about phase5 doing a ppc-version of Kickstart+Workbench
12.40.01 #       <Rocambole> <TA> We are scheduling a Corba conference, an all around OO language conference, an Amiga Inc conference just after MAE, and Fleecy will be logging in here from MAE to keep us updated. 
12.40.02 #       <Rocambole> <TA> Amiga Inc will make a couple of nice announces from MAE IF all goes well. 
12.40.14 #       <Merko> Linus: That doesn't sound very likely.
12.40.17 #       <StG^sNTx> Linus: I've heard the romour, but no confirmation. I'd like to know if they're still doing the prebox
12.40.28 #       <StG^sNTx> all info bout it gone from their hp
12.40.50 #       <Rocambole> hello hesido 
12.40.54 #       <Linus> well i hope they do it, it would be a terrific boost for the Amiga
12.41.00 #       <hesido> hullo roca, ppl
12.41.09 #       <hesido> linus : what ? :)
12.41.39 #       <hesido> <--- is enjoying his 3.2 gb quantum fireball.
12.41.48 #       <Linus> hesido:phase5 doing ppc-version of kickstart+workbench
12.42.00 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: and when is mae?
12.42.00 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: did you read what I copied?
12.42.13 #       <Linus> hesido:good choice, same as mine
12.42.14 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: :) 2-4 october
12.42.18 #       <hesido> linus: that'd be the near-perfect solution for ppc'ers
12.42.43 #       <hesido> linus: I bought it for 146$ inc vat
12.42.47 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: ok.. wonder if that's wat I ordered a ticket for to be in with a shot of winning an a4k and stuff:)
12.42.53 #       <hesido> breand new
12.42.55 #       <hesido> brand new
12.43.33 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: MAE is in Ohio
12.43.49 #       <Linus> hesido:i know, they're dirt cheap, thought of upgrading to a >6GB myself
12.43.53 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: I have no ntention of going there, but don't have to to win.
12.44.25 #       <StG^sNTx> and i'm supporting the amiga in a way 2 by doing it u know
12.44.31 #       <hesido> now that I have free space, I made a script for decoding mp3 using mpega, so that I won't have to hassle with command lines anymore :)
12.44.40 #       <StG^sNTx> was only 10$
12.44.56 #       <Rocambole> <TA> He is going to be our 'reporter from the WOA in Columbus' I guess you could say, but with limited time. 
12.44.57 #       <Rocambole> <Rocambole> hello brinto  
12.45.00 #       <Rocambole> <TA> You can spread that he will be here off and on, we just don't know what facilities he can hog, etc.  :) 
12.45.01 #       <hesido> linus: 3.2 is very sufficient for me! thinking I had a 420 mb conner previously :)
12.45.09 #       <Rocambole> He=fleecy
12.45.26 #       <Linus> hesido: decoding mp3? why don't play them? :)
12.46.09 #       <hesido> linus: having a 030 , you sometimes miss multitasking when listening to songs :)
12.46.12 #       <Linus> hesido:i had a 200 mb HD before my quantum, but now i need more space for my fusion macemu and mp3s
12.46.53 #       <hesido> linus: hmm, I am thinking of installing mac myself, but I heard it is no use w/o a gfx card
12.47.05 #       <Linus> hesido:i've got an 040 40 mhz, and my friends got an 233 mhz ppc and a 060 50 mhz processor
12.47.11 #       <Rocambole> <TA> AI should have a booth with a line, if so, we will see a lot of him. 
12.47.11 #       <Rocambole> <TA> If not, he will come on when he can. 
12.47.12 #       <Rocambole> <Rocambole> TA: I hope they manage to get online :) 
12.47.12 #       <Rocambole> <Rocambole> TA: there have been some incidents with bad or no connections at all 
12.47.12 #       <Rocambole> <TA> He will, even if for a short time. 
12.47.12 #       <Rocambole> <TA> Dave will probably have his script running as well, so we will get all the feed, plus whatever fleecy brings us. 
12.47.15 #       <Rocambole> <TA> And the UGN has a nice surprise this time around. 
12.47.16 #       <Rocambole> <Rocambole> TA: I'm looking forward to it :) 
12.47.19 #       <Rocambole> <TA> Casey Halverson is working with them on a project that will really show what the Amiga Classic can do vs the pc. 
12.47.22 #       <Rocambole> <TA> Casey is a genius with push-pull technology and web cam stuff. 
12.47.55 #       <Rocambole> <TA> Should be an interesting show this time. I suspect small in comparison, but that wil be made up for with some nice touches. 
12.48.27 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: this was the news ;)
12.48.29 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: if he's going to be on we need to tell the public. advertise! Only ann told of the latest time he was supposed to be on anywayz
12.48.50 #       <hesido> <-( currently decoding stairway to heaven to 22khz aiff with -2 priority)
12.48.55 #       <Rocambole> <TA> Rocamble: We will NOT be making the announce about Fleecy coming here. He is doing that on his own time and as our friend rather than as an AI employee. In other words, no scheduled event, just as he gets time. 
12.49.14 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: as you see NO advertising
12.49.21 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: so if this was the news, explian the yes/no answer you gave when i asked for it
12.49.22 #       <hesido> rocam: when did this dialoge took place?
12.49.42 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: other than this there is no news :))
12.49.47 #       <Linus> hesido:i can feel your pain ;)
12.49.54 #       <Rocambole> hesido: earlier tonight
12.51.32 #       <StG^sNTx> ok.. no adverting then, but I think we should make plans on how to advertise for sessions like the one about java and when fleecy pops inn to answer q's if u know what I mean
12.52.00 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: yes, and other sessions will be advertised
12.52.37 #       <Rocambole> StG^sNTx: but then again, we are staying below the radar ;)
12.53.05 #       <StG^sNTx> Rocambole: only in the right channels of coz:)
12.53.32 #       <Rocambole> :))
12.54.19 #       <StG^sNTx> but u agree that only using ann is bel0w the radar of some amigans aswell

13.47.36 #       <Seed> Hi
14.00.57 #       <DrJekyl> re
14.04.12 #       <DrJekyl> bbl
14.58.46 #       <Arvid> wow
15.19.04 #       <zen^^> 14,14 HIHO !
15.19.23 #       <zen^^> hmm
15.34.15 #       <Seed> Hi
15.40.16 #       <Arvid> Seed I found me a TOY
15.40.33 #       <Seed> Arvid: :)
15.40.39 #       <Seed> a Toy?
15.41.19 #       <Arvid> Seed at a computer flea market in Kansas City , I found an Amiga 4000T .. no floppy or hard drive, no fast ram, but otherwise complete  .. and I paid all of $40 for it
15.42.18 #       <Seed> Are you joking???
15.42.31 #       <Seed> I would give you $300 for it
15.42.50 #       <Seed> I must have another A4000 :( I've been looking for one that works well
15.43.22 #       <Arvid> heh .. I gotta get some drives in it and test it ... It might become my primary Amiga, eventually
15.43.46 #       <Seed> Grrrrr.. Do you detect jealousy? :)
15.43.57 #       <Arvid> That is why I told you
15.44.19 #       <Seed> thanks, man.. I really need this today
15.44.26 #       <Arvid> heh
15.44.44 #       <Arvid> It even has the Quickpak scsi-2 card installed
15.44.53 #       <Seed> shudup!
15.45.05 #       <Seed> I don't believe anyone would throw away such a thing
15.45.25 #       <Arvid> the people at the show are all PC jerks
15.45.38 #       <Seed> You are one lucky guy
15.46.07 #       <Arvid> I have not installed drives , yet.  Got to see if it works
15.46.22 #       <Seed> I have Zorro cards that I can't put at the same time on my lone A4000.. I need an extra one
15.46.37 #       <Seed> I hope there is no catch there :)
15.47.35 #       <Arvid> just now taking apart an old Phoenix external floppy to use as df0:
15.48.16 #       <Seed> Arvid: I'll have to ask you to keep your happiness to yourself
15.49.40 #       <Arvid> heh
15.50.31 #       <Arvid> I know a guy who has ordered that new Zorro II card from Germany so he can use his ISDN on his A3000 at full speed
15.50.47 #       <Seed> ISDN sucks
15.52.32 #       <Seed> and why Germany? A card like the GVP ioExtender is more than enough for the fastest ISDN hardware. You can get it from any American dealer
15.55.57 #       <Arvid> he has a IOExtender and it only goes to 115200 bps
15.56.22 #       <Arvid> he has to talk to the ISDN at 460000 or so BPS for it to work properly
15.56.40 #       <Seed> hehe.. it does up to 460800 easily
15.56.55 #       <Arvid> Seed hmm ok
15.57.04 #       <Seed> My ioExtender can do 460800
15.57.11 #       <Seed> Hi Dave_C
15.57.18 #       <Arvid> <-- prepares to brag to Dave_C
15.57.24 #       <Dave_C> re all
15.57.36 #       <Seed> Dave_C prepare to kick Arvid :)
15.57.41 #       <Arvid> heh
15.58.31 #       <Arvid> Dave_C I found an A4000T with scsi-2 but no drives, hard or floppy or fast ram in a computer flea market in Kansas City today .. I paid all of $40 for it
15.58.50 #       <Dave_C> $40!
15.59.04 #       <Seed> Dave_C: outrageous, isn't it?
15.59.27 #       <Dave_C> hehehe no doubt
15.59.34 #       <Seed> I wanted to kick him myself.. but I listened to the part of my brain that said no :)
15.59.45 #       <Seed> I need an extra A4000. that's the point :)
15.59.47 #       * Dave_C can get away with it...
15.59.59 #       <Dave_C> no ban enforced...
16.00.02 #       <Arvid> yup all of forty dollars
16.00.11 #       <Dave_C> hehehe
16.00.16 #       <Arvid> Dave_C all the people at the show are PC nerds
16.00.24 #       <Dave_C> Seed: How'd you get an IOX to do 400K?
16.01.21 #       <Dave_C> Arvid: Does it work?
16.01.22 #       <Seed> Dave_C: sure it can do over 230400, can't it?
16.01.50 #       <Dave_C> Seed: All the prefs stuff I've seen stopped @ 115.2K
16.02.02 #       <Seed> But Miami's don't :)
16.02.08 #       <Seed> and Term's
16.02.29 #       <Seed> and it doesn't matter, since you can always specify the baud rate manually
16.02.44 #       <Dave_C> alan's MF-III should be herer Tuesday or Wednesday, then I'll have bandwidth again.
16.03.07 #       <Seed> I hope to get a 56K modem that does 234000... than I'll be able to tell you for sure
16.03.59 #       <Seed> then
16.04.02 #       <Dave_C> Wen our cable company finally offers cable.net, I'll use my PC as a router, or proxy, or whatever...
16.04.47 #       <Seed> Dave_C: do you have an IOX?
16.04.51 #       <Dave_C> Arvid: does it work at all, or is it totally stipped?
16.05.20 #       <Seed> It probably has a 486SX inside.. just a A4000T case ;)
16.05.26 #       <Dave_C> Seed: I have one that got burned...
16.05.26 #       <Dave_C> HD slipped off a mount and brushed the back of the card.
16.05.40 #       <Seed> burnt.. lightning?
16.05.45 #       <Seed> ouch
16.06.47 #       <Dave_C> took out the xtal and the U8 GAL
16.06.47 #       <Dave_C> probably a few more components as well..
16.07.40 #       <Dave_C> haven't even wanted to meter it..
16.07.40 #       <Seed> The IOX comes with a special version of Parnet for it's serial port that allows it to be as fast as the built-in parallel port of the Amiga. so that 460800 figure isn't a joke
16.08.50 #       <Seed> "for its"... I'm getting tired
16.11.48 #       <Arvid> Dave_C no drives at all, no fast ram, but I am slowly fixing that
16.12.11 #       <Seed> Arvid: I can kick you as well, you know :)
16.12.18 #       <Arvid> heh
16.12.49 #       <Seed> 40$!!
16.13.25 #       <Seed> I can come up with 40$ using change.. just coins!
16.13.27 #       <Dave_C> Arvid: So it does boot up and all?
16.13.48 #       <Seed> Dave_C: wait.. I'm sure it has something important missing
16.14.03 #       <Arvid> AHA
16.14.04 #       <Dave_C> floppy, hd, ram, etc
16.14.27 #       <Arvid> The keyboard I got with the A4kt has the small connector .. but the A4KT socket is the one like on my A3000
16.14.29 #       * Dave_C has a couple of SCSI-II HD's
16.14.35 #       <Arvid> the standard 5-pin din
16.14.44 #       <Dave_C> got a 2G SeaCrap..er SeaGate Barracuda
16.14.52 #       <Arvid> fortunately, I have a spare keyboard for athe A3000
16.15.03 #       <Arvid> Dave_C I hope my son sends me one or two of those too
16.15.12 #       <Seed> Dave_C: the Barracuda is not crap
16.15.47 #       <Arvid> Dave_C alatavista is pulling 200 of the 2.1gig barracudas, and replacing them with 18-gig drives
16.16.13 #       <Arvid> altavista
16.16.26 #       <Dave_C> Hmmmm... sounds like a big surpluss auction.
16.16.32 #       <Seed> I have one.. wish they would give me theirs :)
16.16.42 #       <Arvid> Dave_C I hope to get one or two for ... uh .. free
16.16.53 #       <Seed> damn you two
16.17.00 #       <Arvid> heh
16.17.01 #       <Seed> ;)
16.17.34 #       <Dave_C> Seed: Wanna get real pissed? I paid $10 for my IOX
16.17.47 #       <Dave_C> paying $50 for the MF-II
16.17.47 #       <Dave_C> ooops
16.17.52 #       <Seed> Dave_C: but I didn't kill mine
16.17.57 #       <Dave_C> MF-III
16.18.32 #       <Dave_C> Seed: But I'm gonna send it to GVPm.. last I heard they were taking stuff back for refurb
16.19.04 #       <Seed> the shipment alone would cost more than my 2nd hand one cost :)
16.19.30 #       <Seed> I also found an Emplant board for dirt cheap. but I don't need it anymore
