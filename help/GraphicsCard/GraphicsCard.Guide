@NODE CGFX "CyberGraphics"

  CyberGraphics (CGFX)  is a Retargetable Graphics system to redirect 
graphic output to the Monitor bypassing the Amiga's built in graphics 
mode (OCS/ECS/AGA) using Shared Libraries and support software.

  CyberGraphics software is usually supplied with the Graphics Board or 
can be purchased seperately. The current version is now 4.

  CyberGraphics supports a wide range of old and new graphics boards 
which include:

BlizzardVision, CyberVision 64,64/3D and PPC, Picasso II, II+ and IV, 
Piccolo (SD64), Inferno, Domino, A2410, Retina BLT Z3, Altais and the 
Spectrum 28/24.

CGFX V3/4 consists of the following libraries:

@{u}Name@{uu}                 @{u}Purpose@{uu}

cgxsystem.library   Main library for cybergraphics functions.
                    (Replaces cybergraphics, cyberlayers and 
                    cyberintuition libraries from v2)
cgxbootpic.library  Boot Picture library for CGFX. which holds the 
                    boot picture.
cgxvideo.library    For video overlay and other video functions (CV3D)
cgxmpeg.library     Used for Isis' MPEG program.
cybergl.library     Used for CyberGL (a subset of OpenGL) 3D functions.
cyberncg.library    Lets you use v43 datatypes on NON-CGX systems.
gtlayout.library    Layout library for CGXMode and CVMode
vilintuisup.library Used to allow Picasso II programs to run under CGFX.

Also there are Monitor files for different cards to support various 
resolutions and screen depths and adds them to the monitor database 
for use by Workbench.

Further information about CyberGraphX, CyberGL and Graphics Boards 
(old and new) can be found at their web site at:

@NODE P96 "Picasso 96"

  Picasso96 (P96)  is a Retargetable Graphics system to redirect graphic
output to the Monitor bypassing the Amiga's built in graphics mode (OCS/
ECS/AGA) using Shared Libraries and support software.

  Picasso96 software is usually supplied with the Graphics Board or can 
be obtained from Aminet or the main Picasso 96 website.

  Picasso 96 supports a wide range of Graphics cards like CyberGraphX:

Cybervision 64 and 64/£D, Domino, Merlin, oMniBus, Picasso II, II+ and IV,
Piccolo, Piccolo SD64, Pixel 64, Retina BLT Z3, Spectrum and UAEGFX

the following features out of 26 possible functions:

a) Hi and True Colour support.
b) Open/Close P96 screens
c) Get Information on a P96 board
d) Picture-in-Picture (PIP) Support
e) Display ID support

in all Amigas).

  EGS does require a @{b}lot of memory@{ub} to run and has a few drivers 
for it and quite a number of application software and utilities support it. 
Check out Aminet for compatible programs.

  EGS supports the following boards: GVP 110, IV24, Piccolo (SD64), Rainbow 
2 and 3, Spectrum and Vision cards, A2410.

egsgadbox.library         EGS Gadtools library
egsgfx.library            EGS Graphics library
egsintui.library          EGS Intuition library
egslayers.library         EGS graphic layers library
egsrequest.library        EGS Requester library
egs_r3d.library

Plus EGB gadget libraries, monitor drivers, classes, preference, config 
files  and drivers for each individual board.

  There are plenty of tools to use with EGS with the system files supplied 
and  various Paint packages and picture or Anim viewers on Aminet.
  EGS is no longer developed and does not support the latest graphics 
boards,  that is now supported by CyberGraphx and Picasso96.

@NODE W3D "Warp3d Graphics Software"

  Warp3D is being developed by Haage and Partner to take advantage of the 
3D  features of the latest graphics cards such as the Cybervision 64/3D, 
CyberVisionPPC and Blizzard VisionPPC cards. Warp3D is not the same as OpenGL.

  Warp3D supports pixel, line drawing, triangles, textures, Hidden surface 
removal (ZBuffering), shape cutting (stencil), alpha blending (transparency), 
fogging and lighting.
 
  Warp3D provides an API to allow programmers to produce software such as games 
easily without accessing the hardware directly but by a common interface so
that it will work on any card on on any model of Amiga.

Warp3D v2 consists of the following:

@NODE OGL "OpenGL/Mesa Software"

 OpenGL (Open Graphics Language) is a 3D system developed by Silicon Graphics
to program 3D functions on 3D accerated graphics cards. It is very widely
adopted in industry including SGI, PC, Mac and game consoles. The new Amiga
will also adopt it as standard for its new graphics chipset.

  There are a few implementations of OpenGL on the Amiga: CyberGL, StormMesa
and AmigaMesaRTL. Two are available on Aminet and StormMesa is available 
from H&P.  MiniGL is available from Hyperion Software.

  OpenGL programs are usually developed using GLUT (GL Utility Toolkit) of
which there is a version with AmigaMesa. 

  For further information, check out Silicon Graphics web pages and H&P's
web pages and the program archives:
