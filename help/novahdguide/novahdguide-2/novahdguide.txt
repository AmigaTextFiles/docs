Something to say at start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having 160+ gig hard drive these days seems to be something very ordinary
on Linux, Mac or Windows boxes, it may even be considered as a small amount
of space since media take up a lot of it plus there are much larger drives
(750+ gig) available on the market already. I wanted to use my 160 gib hard
drive but i didnt want to make mistakes like i did with the previous drive,
my knowledge wasnt too good as well on certain topics, so i started to look
for some tips on the internet.

My research shown that im allowed to use only the very first 126 GiB of my
new harddisk, beacuse of the ATA registers limitation. I have seen many docs
on the internet explaining the problem of this barrier and how to overcome
it. The very known method is to increase the Block size and use 48bit LBA
(http://www.48bitlba.com/) which is widely used in the PC world. There were
some talkings around that Amiga also does support 48bit logic, but i was
however unsuccessful with that.

At this point i would like to warn you, 'scsi.device' version 43.43 that
comes with BoingBag-3.9.2 does detect large capacities( >=126 gig) properly
but there is no documentation available anywhere stating that it has some
improvements to the LBA handling, plus it contains a very serious bug, it
crashes or hangs upon two or more partitions going to be auto mounted...,
'scsi.device's in versions 43.30 or 43.35 seem to work fine.

Another remark is data safety, even if you succeed(by hacking) partitioning
160+ gig harddisk with the Block size of 512 Bytes then you must realize
that you can not expect miracle. When you reach and then cross the 28bit ATA
boundary = 0xFFFFFFF then the counter will wrap around and you will be at
the point of = 0x0000000 going up again, where performing any writes will
result in corrupting the begining of your disk where your boot partition
or some other partitions may sit!

In ATA you got 16 bits for number of Cylinders = 65536 max., 4 bits for
number of Heads = 16 max. and 8 bits for number of Blocks per Track = 255.
If you summarize them 16 + 4 + 8 you will receive 28 bits. Do the math
65536 * 16 * 255 it will give you a maximum of 267386880 possible sectors.
Assuming Block size is 512 Bytes we multiply 267386880 * 512 and achieve
136902082560 bytes or 127.5 Gigabytes of available space, but on the Amiga
this type of logic can be considered a hack, this is because 'scsi.device'
uses a value of 63 for Blocks per Track..., i will discuss this in RVM.

Generally you should stay with the 28bit ATA and not try to use some tricks
that may be incompatible from driver to driver. You can always use 4-way
adapter and connect more such drives, so no nasty surprises will occur.



Can i use old 'HdToolBox'?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sure, but there are limitations. It is safe to set 32768 cylinders per
partition and resize it with mouse, but it is not safe to do so beyond that.
As a final value you can use 65536 and do all the resizements with numbers
entered in the string gadgets only. You can always combine 'HdInstTools'.
To calculate 'Blocks per Cylinder' manually use this:

   Heads * Blocks per Track = Blocks per Cylinder

Also, dont look at the calculations made by old partitioning software they
will be mostly wrong.

Please note, your drive is in your hands, so be careful with the math, double
check everything, data integrity depends on that! You do not need to calculate
anything if you got 128+ gig big hard drive, just follow the guide. Lets start
from providing drive definition, click 'Read Configuration' and check the out,
we must verify the config. So if for example it came with,

             Cylinders: 39549
                 Heads: 16
      Blocks per Track: 63
   Blocks per Cylinder: 1008
           (Block size: 512)

Then you do the math of this type,

   Cylinders * Heads * Blocks per Track * Block size = Capacity [B]

to see if this reflects real capacity of your drive, ARexx is mostly at hand,
so we will be using it from now on as a calculator:

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say 39549*16*63*512"

which is 20411080704 Bytes or 19 GiB = true, this is my old Samsung drive.
If it will turn out that this not true then you have to improvise. If for
example it has detected(might happen with 'HdInstTools'),

             Cylinders: 712345
                 Heads: 1
      Blocks per Track: 399
           (Block size: 512)

then this is not a good idea to use such setup. If your drive capacity is
160 GiB then as you remember from the previous part of this article you are
allowed to use only the first 126 GiB with the Block size of 512 Bytes!
In this case you should enter these values,

             Cylinders: 262144
                 Heads: 16
      Blocks per Track: 63
   Blocks per Cylinder: 1008
           (Block size: 512)

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say 262144*16*63*512"

which is 135291469824 Bytes or 126 GiB and now you may finally go and set the
partitions. If it will turn out that the automatic configuration dumped too
small values then enter things like above and adjust the Cylinders only to
match the real hard drive size minus some small factor to be on the safe side,
to avoid unexpected errors that may appear if values exceed the real capacity.
Suppose your drive is 80.1 GiB big and there were some problems with detection,
so we assume it as 80100000000 bytes, now you should adjust the Cylinders to
give you lower than this value or simply,

   Capacity / Heads / B p T / Block size = Cylinders

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say trunc(80100000000/16/63/512)"

which is 155203 Cylinders according to OVM nomenclature.



Original Values Model = OVM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In old 'scsi.device' ranging from version 37(maybe even less) to 40 you are
allowed to use only the very first 7.8 GiB(theoretically) of your disk quota,
this limitation is a result of 24 bit logic. There can be 16384 Cylinders =
14 bits, 16 Heads = 4 bits and (64-1) Blocks per Track = 6 bits.
A combination of these values gives a number of 16515072(16384*16*63) sectors
for your disposal(in theory). If you pick a block size of 512 Bytes and then
multiply by the number of sectors you will receive 8455716864 Bytes = 7.8 GiB.
Some people may say "Great! But why doesnt this work???", and the answer is
"Because this requires 64 bit types, and your 'scsi.device' and 'FastFileSystem'
operate on 32 bit integers only, which means (4294967294-2) Bytes = 3.9 GiB".
To fully use that space you must patch 'scsi.device' with a program called
'NSDPatch' and use 64 bit file system, such as version 44+ of 'FastFileSystem'
or version 1 or 2 of 'SmartFileSystem'. You must also follow the rule below
when partitioning in order to keep your data in good shape:


2                                                                       16382
+------------------------------------+-+------------------------------------+
|                                    | |                                    |
|          V (nFFS ok here)          |S|      A (never use nFFS here)       |
|                                    | |                                    |
+------------------------------------+-+------------------------------------+

                3.9 GiB                               ~3.9 GiB


      V - VISIBLE area, virtually any 'scsi.device'.
      S - SEPARATOR area (a partition made of few cyls.).
      A - ADOPTED area, space available after patching.

   nFFS - native FFS, the one that comes with Kickstart
          or any other pre 43 or some other old/exotic fs.


Let me explain. V is where 'scsi.device' has access all the time, S is to 
prevent you from making partitions partly in the V area and partly in the A
area, this may cause probs, like it may turn out with some exotic file systems
that partition made right after the first 3.9 GiB is visible without 64 bit
patch applied first. Imagine writing to it at that time... burried alive, cuz
after you reach 4294967294 Bytes and try to cross it, then the integer will
simply wrap around and give 0 or any other value in its range where your
partition(s) in V area sit.

Assuming these are our base values for the drive,

             Cylinders: 16384
                 Heads: 16
      Blocks per Track: 63
   Blocks per Cylinder: 1008
           (Block size: 512)

we want to calculate how many Partition Cylinders for V area will be needed,
and according to this formula:

   Cylinders - (Capacity - 3.9 GiB) / Heads / B p T / Block size = PCyls

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say trunc(16384-(8455716864-4294967294)/16/63/512)"

8322 - 2 = 8320 (this is because partitions start at cylinder 2, see above)
PCyls will be needed. We will now check how many Bytes this is so we can
calculate how many PCyls for S, firstly i would like to suggest to calculate
how many Bytes in one cylinder.

   Heads * Blocks per Track * Block size = One cylinder [B]

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say 16*63*512"

And this is 516096 Bytes, so now the V area stuff,

  PCyls * One cylinder = V area size [B]

  > rx "numeric digits 14;say 8320*516096"

which is 4293918720 Bytes, nearly 3.9 GiB, good. Now lets focus on SEPARATOR,
lets subtract V area size from 3.9 GiB to see how many bytes to separate,

  3.9 GiB - V area size = S mask

  > rx "numeric digits 14;say 4294967294-4293918720"

and we need 1048574 Bytes to mask the rest of V area. You can clearly see that
3 cylinders will be just fine,

  > rx "numeric digits 14;say 3*516096"

which is 1548288 Bytes. At this point you should create a partition at cyl.
8322 with the size of 3 PCyls, call it SEPARATOR and exclude from being
auto mounted. This way we got V and A, ready to be partitioned.

If your 'scsi.device' or patch applied to your old 'scsi.device' is capable
of simulating LBA then you are able to use 126 GiB of your hard disk quota.
Things change a little bit, since we are able to use 28 bits(ATA limitation),
where we can set 262144 Cylinders = 18 bits, 16 Heads = 4 bits and 63 B p T =
6 bits. This gives a total of 264241152(262144*16*63) sectors we can use.
Assuming Block size of 512 Bytes this gives 135291469824 Bytes or 126 GiB
of total available space. What i suggest here is add second SEPARATOR for
maximum security.


2                                                                      262142

|                | |             | |                                        |
|   V (nFFS ok)  |S| A (no nFFS) |S|            L (no nFFS here)            |
|                | |             | |                                        |
+----------------+-+-------------+-+----------------------------------------+

      3.9 GiB         ~3.9 GiB                     118.2 GiB


      V - VISIBLE area, virtually any 'scsi.device'.
      S - SEPARATOR area (a partition made of few cyls.).
      A - ADOPTED area, space available after patching or
          using new 'scsi.device'.
      L - LBA area, space available with a device that
          supports TD64.

   nFFS - native FFS, the one that comes with Kickstart
          or any other pre 43 or some other old/exotic fs.


We dont have to calculate anything anymore, we will just insert another
SEPARATOR at cylinder 16384 preferably 3 PCyls long. From now on your L area
is finally a place for big partitions, almost no restrictions with true 64 bit
file systems!

At this point you are ready to go, your first 3.9 GiB is ready to be used
so you can install or xfer your previous system from old drive and continue
setting up TD64/NSD64 stuff (see last point and dont worry if it says your
drive does not support 64 bit commands, we dont need them in VISIBLE area!).



Reduced Values Model = RVM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this model we will try to be ATA compatible. This model is not recommended
for use with 8 Gigabyte drives, however 7.8 GiB limitation will be assumed.

We will use these values for our drive,

             Cylinders: 65536
                 Heads: 16
      Blocks per Track: 255
   Blocks per Cylinder: 4080
           (Block size: 512)

so we have a 127.5 GiB of total available space. The advantage of RVM is your
partitions will be having less cylinders = more Gigabytes, where this is very
desirable when using old partitioning proggy, such as 'Hdtoolbox'. Rules are
nearly the same as in previous point, except for numer of Cylinders, LBA area
size,


2                                                                       65534
+----------------+-+-------------+-+----------------------------------------+
|                | |             | |                                        |
|   V (nFFS ok)  |S| A (no nFFS) |S|            L (no nFFS here)            |
|                | |             | |                                        |
+----------------+-+-------------+-+----------------------------------------+

      3.9 GiB         ~3.9 GiB                     119.7 GiB


      V - VISIBLE area, virtually any 'scsi.device'.
      S - SEPARATOR area (a partition made of few cyls.).
      A - ADOPTED area, space available after patching or
          using new 'scsi.device'.
      L - LBA area, space available with a device that
          supports TD64.

   nFFS - native FFS, the one that comes with Kickstart
          or any other pre 43 or some other old/exotic fs.


and the method of calculation is slightly different. Firstly we take the
Capacity from the OVM which is 8455716864 Bytes and we are going to convert
it to a numer of Cylinders to put in RVM, this is as simple as,

   Capacity / Heads / B p T / Block size = PCyls 

   rx "numeric digits 14;say trunc(8455716864/16/255/512)"

and results with 4047 - 2 = 4045 PCyls(partitioning starts at cylinder 2!). 
So, now we add a partition called SEPARATOR at 4046 with 3 PCyls and exclude
it from being auto mounted. Worth to mention is that one cylinder in this
model is,

   Heads * Blocks per Track * Block size = One cylinder [B]

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say 16*255*512"

2088960 Bytes long! So in practise 2 PCyls should suffice for SEPARATOR stuff,
but as i was using 3 in OVM then we will stay this way. Now we are going to 
setup VISIBLE area,

   3.9 GiB / Heads / B p T / Block size = PCyls

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say trunc(4294967294/16/255/512)"

and this is 2056 - 2 = 2054 PCyls (partitioning is possible counting from
cylinder 2!), so we place a SEPARATOR at cylinder 2057 with 3 PCyls, and this
way we got V, A and L areas ready to be partitioned. You are allowed to use
the VISIBLE area right after setting there some file systems, so you can boot
your machine with some system and do the necessary changes to your startup
in order to use A and/or L areas.



What about the Block size?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Increasing block size wont actually help, it might work with 48bit ATA, but
as far as i know there is no such thing on the Amiga. Anyway here is how to
setup if im wrong and BoingBag's 'scsi.device' allows 128+ gigs to be used,
but note this is pure theory and i do not recommend to use this.

You have to calculate everything from scratch for a Block size of 1024 or
more Bytes. You have to take care of maximum Cylinders, set them before doing
anything further. For example you have 16.8 GiB hard drive and wish to use it
with NSD64 only, which should be possible. So you assume that 16.8 GiB is
16800000000 Bytes. Firstly you calculate how many Cylinders this is in total
for a Block size of 1024 Bytes(remeber im referring to OVM!),

   Capacity / Heads / B p T / Block size = Cylinders

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say trunc(16800000000/16/63/1024)"

and this is 16276 Cylinders, so now we make a drive definition like this,

             Cylinders: 16276
                 Heads: 16
      Blocks per Track: 63
   Blocks per Cylinder: 1008
           (Block size: 1024)

and do everthing as in OVM point, remembering to use a file system with the
Block size of 1024 Bytes and NOT enlarging the VISIBLE area!!!

Please note, the larger the Block size is the more space will be wasted! You
can read about that in old SFS documentation, there are benchmarks and such,
but yes it will boost the filesystem a lot! Reasonable Block size is something
like 1024 or 2048 Bytes and that is all for a file system of general purpose.
On the other hand if you got 1 TiB large hard disk then it should not be
bothering you. And oh, i almost forgot, larger Block sizes + huge partitions
= more memory needed, like for validating, checking, etc.



Partitioning suggestions(OVM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I would like to suggest you a partition of 2 GiB for your 'SYS:',

   > rx "numeric digits 14;say x2d('7fffffff')-1",

which should be 2147483646 bytes long if you plan to use 'FastFileSystem'.
Another thing is to leave unused space for further use. You may for example
create a partition to store your environment stuff instead of putting it
in 'RAM:'. I know this is slower than storing in 'Ram Disk', but if you
are low on memory then this is a great idea + this way risk of invalidated
boot partition is much lower. You may also like to use VMM - im not sure if
VMM can talk to the 'scsi.device' in the new way, so you better not create
a partition for it in A or L areas!

For anything else in the ADOPTED and LBA areas i dont see any other good
solution than 'SmartFileSystem' - SFS version 1 = SFS\0 = 0x53465300.

   - SFS            ( http://strohmayer.org/ )

After setting up your hard disk, make a safe copy of 'RDB',

   - HdInstTools    ( http://aminet.net/disk/misc/hdinst.lha )

You may also like to write manual mountlist entries(very good idea) and mount
them after the patches and/or new drives are loaded. For example, assuming
values previously defined as our drive base,

             Cylinders: 16384
                 Heads: 16
      Blocks per Track: 63
   Blocks per Cylinder: 1008
           (Block size: 512)

you have created a partition called 'HD1:' that starts at cylinder 8326 and
has 8057 PCyls. Your file system is SFS\0 and the disk is connected on Unit 0,
then your mounlist entry will be looking like this:

HD1:
FileSystem 	= L:SmartFileSystem
Device 		= scsi.device
Priority 	= 1
Unit 		= 0
Flags 		= 0
Surfaces 	= 16
BlockSize 	= 512
BlocksPerTrack 	= 63
Reserved 	= 2
Interleave 	= 0
LowCyl 		= 8327
HighCyl 	= 16383
StackSize 	= 4096
Buffers 	= 128
BufMemType 	= 0
GlobVec 	= -1
DosType 	= 0x53465300
MaxTransfer 	= 0x1FE00
Mask 		= 0xFFFFFFE
Activate 	= 1
#

You may specify other values for 'Buffers' and 'Mask' - i prefer 0xFFFFFFE
(256 MiB). Also note, if you plan to use mounlists instead of auto mounting
then you can unload file systems from RDB and load them in the startup
residently, except for your boot partition. 



Which 64 bit solution do i choose?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Known to me solutions are:

   - IDEfix           (28 bits ATA)
   - AmigaOS updates  (28 bits ATA)
   - FRAP             (28 bits ATA)

   - NSDPatch         (24 bits with old 'scsi.device')

If you are a lucky owner of 'IDEfix' then you need to know that this is much
more optimized 'scsi.device' than the one in 'AmigaOS updates'. But if you do
not have it at hand then the version of 'scsi.device' that comes with OS 3.5/
3.9 and BoingBags is also good(as long as you avoid 'scsi.device' version
43.43). Other things are 'FRAP' and 'NSDPatch', they are freely available and
you can get them both form Aminet. Downsides of these two solutions are like 
- in case of 'FRAP' - you have to have working mmu in order to use it. And 
when talking about 'NSDPatch' it will allow you to use only the very first
7.8 Gigabytes of your hard drive with the block size of 512 Bytes.

If you decide to use 'IDEfix' under OS 3.5/3.9 then dont forget to edit the
'NSDPatch.cfg' and comment out everything related to 'scsi.device' as it is
NSD64/TD64 compatible already!.

In case of 'FRAP' you do not need to patch it with 'NSDPatch', it is fully
NSD64/TD64 compliant, so exclude 'scsi.device' in 'NSDPatch.cfg'.


a) IDEfix
==========

This is very easy, files you need are as follows(crippled):

   - c:IDEfix
   - c:LoadIDE
   - libs:idefix.library

You have two choices, install the new 'scsi.device' as a module, or patch 
existing 'scsi.device' on the fly. In the first case place 'LoadIDE' after 
'Setpatch' like:

   > Setpatch
   > LoadIDE reset

You may take a look at its options to fully fit your configuration, and dont
worry it wont fall into reboot loop - reboots only once, when installing the
module.

Second way is somewhat undesired and unclean, but it works and you dont have
to reboot. You just place 'IDEfix' after the 'Setpatch'

   > Setpatch
   > IDEfix

And you are done. These are of course simple examples, in my startup i got a
place where i load all the modules so that i got only two reboots at cold
start.

You may find a demo on Aminet,

   - IDEfix97       ( http://aminet.net/disk/misc/IDEfix97.lha )

but i recommend version 119.16(IDE-fix), the less recommened is version
119.17(IDE-max) - people say it contains some tweaks.


b) AmigaOS updates
===================

First of all, extract your "AmigaOS Rom Update" using one of three available
on the net proggies:

   - RomSplit       ( http://www.doobreynet.co.uk/files/remus/RomSplit_096.lha )
   - romupdatesplit ( http://aminet.net/util/boot/BlizKick.lha )
   - rux            ( http://aminet.net/util/boot/RemAPollo.lha )

Rename your update to something like "AmigaOS Rom Update_off", copy the
extracted modules to 'devs:modules/' and pick the needed ones to be loaded 
with,

   - Loadresident   ( http://aminet.net/util/boot/RemAPollo.lha )

or any other such program(i like this one, cuz it is able to display the
modules and can be easily used in scripts) or your kickstart remapper. For
example, we want to load 'scsi.device' version 43.35 so we just:

   > Setpatch

Or using the kickstart remapper(refer to its docs on how to do that):

   > Setpatch
   > yourkickstartremapper devs:kickstarts/kickX.AY devs:modules/scsi.device_43.35

In case of 'Loadresident' if you decide to add more modules then remember
to add them always on top of existing ones without 'reboot' switch.


c) FRAP
========

With this patch you can attack 'scsi.device' in versions ranging from 37.64
(maybe even less) to perhaps 40.22, i was using it for a long time in the past
with my 20 gig drive and it was better than nothing. But it expects the rom to
be writable so you have to remap it and leave unprotected, where this tool does
this very good:

   > MuFastRom      ( http://aminet.net/util/libs/MMULib.lha )

But before you can do that you have to install and configure the 'MMULib'
package in your system. After that you just insert 'MuFastRom' after your
real kickstart remapper(or if you dont have any then right after 'Setpatch'):

   > Setpatch
   > yourkickstartremapper ...
   > mulocklib
   > MuFastRom on noprotect
   > FRAP
  
And without any additional reboots your system continues to boot with NSD64/
TD64 compliant 'scsi.device'. To see if 'FRAP' did its job redirect the output
to some file. You may hook up some script testing if it patched or not like
this one:

   > ...
   > SET frapmsg ram:frapmsg.temp
   > FRAP >$frapmsg
   > rx >NIL: "a=OPEN(b,'$frapmsg','R');c=READCH(b,65535);IF POS('LBA mode : ON',c)>0 THEN EXIT 0;EXIT 5"
   > IF WARN
   > echo "error, 'scsi.device' not patched!!!"
   > ENDIF
   > UNSETENV $frapmsg
   > UNSET frapmsg

or this one(simplier):

   > Setpatch
   > yourkickstartremapper ...
   > mulocklib
   > MuFastRom on noprotect
   > IF WARN
   > echo "error, 'scsi.device' not patched!!!" 
   > ELSE
   > FRAP
   > ENDIF

You may be asking of why to remap twice, and not just use the 'MuFastRom', and
that is a good question! The problem is with 'exec.library', 'MuFastRom' cant
relocate it "live". I know this is a waste of memory but there is probably no 
other way if you want speed and 'FRAP' unless your remapper is able to leave
the kickstart unprotected.

d) NSDPatch
============

This solution is good for use with 8 Gigabyte disks and old 'scsi.device'.
It can perhaps work on A600 as well. Download and install(dont install if you
are the owner of OS 3.5/3.9 as there is 'NSDPatch' integrated in 'Setpatch'):

   - NSDPatch       ( http://aminet.net/disk/misc/NSDPatch43_20.lha )

You then simply use the default config which should be activated after
the 'Setpatch':

   > Setpatch
   > NSDPatch

This will result in NSD64 compliant 'scsi.device' of virtually any version.
Small remark, you should not patch any residently loaded modules with this
program, only rom resources, so take a look at the 'NSDPatch.cfg' first to
see what is in there and what modules you usually load!



Final words
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can safely format everything in the V area, not worrying about the 64
bit commands absency. After making sure your NSD64/TD64 function ok, you may
start formatting your newly created partitions in the A and maybe L areas, but
do that only with automounted partitions, dont use mounlists at this point.
A program called:

   - Format64       ( http://aminet.net/disk/misc/Format64.lha )

will tell you at the begining if drive supports 64 bit commands and if so hit
Return, and go shopping or give yourself some food =D otherwise press Control-C
and Return to abort.

DONT FORMAT AND/OR QUICK FORMAT THE L AREA WHEN USING 'NSDPatch' WITH OLD 
'scsi.device', IT WILL TRASH NEIGHBOUR PARTITIONS AND CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO
COMMIT SUICIDE(CRASH)!!!

Generally dont do quick formats at all so you can track down more errors. Also,
avoid 'ffs' switch on SFS partitions.

You may want to add 'noverify' switch so the formatting process will be as
twice as fast(if the drive is new, then the risk of bad blocks is almost
none).

In case of SFS afected partitions and when everything went fine with 'format64',
use 'SFSFormat' to setup file system specific stuff.

If you see any errors in this article then please let me know, your suggestions
and contributions are very welcome!

Formatting 127.5 GiB took my Miggy(68040/33) 18 hours, good luck! =D



Thanks to all people who have developed software mentioned in this guide,
without your effort it would be impossible to use large hard drives on this
oldskoolish computer.
