                              ON DISK UTILITIES

On this disk are two P.D utilities called Filemaster and GrabIFF
to get to these we need to use Workbench.
If you have a hard drive you can boot up your system and then insert
the tutorial disk read below on what to do then.  
If you do not have a hard drive we will need to load you up a small 
Workbench for you. If you remember, when you boot this disk
you get asked a question 'See on disk utils y/n' to get here you would
of answered "n", well all you need to do is answer 'y' and a mini 
Workbench will be loaded for you.

Follow these steps to access the programs:

* Turn off your Amiga and make sure ABGTWB3_VOL1 is in the internal
  disk drive.
* Switch on your Amiga (This is called booting a disk)
* Answer 'y' to the see utils question.
* A Workbench will then load. 
* Double click on the disk icon called 'ABGTWB3_VOL1'
* A window will appear with some icons in it.
* Double click on the drawer icon called 'PD_UTILS'
* Now double click on any one of the four icons that appear
  in the new window that has been opened.
* Filemaster.Doc and GrabIFF.Doc are the instructions on how to use
  each program, just double click on the icon and a text displayer
  will load up the text and display it, press the Escape key when you 
  have finished reading a doc file.
* Double click on 'Filemaster' or 'GrabIFF' to run either program.

NOTE: You can double click on 'Menus.Guide' to load this guide.

                                     ----
In normal, everyday use, using the default @{" Workbench " link workbench} setting of 
showing @{ " icons " link icon} only is fine, it saves a lot of useless files 
being displayed and cluttering up the screen. Any file that does not have 
an .info file associated with it will not be displayed in this mode.
As an example I have copied three files to the @{" Ram Disk " link ram disk}, they are:

Clock
Clock.info
invaders

When I @{" Double click " link mouse} on the Ram Disk icon the Clock will be 
displayed on the screen because it has an icon associated 
with it, (the .info file) Where as Invaders will not be visible as it has
no .info file (icon). So, what happens if you wanted to run the Invaders 
program? (Assuming you already knew it was there of course) There are a few
courses of action you could take. You could start the Invaders program from
the @{" Shell " link shell}. You could start it using the @{" Execute Command " link xcom}
option from the Workbench menu.  Or, probably the easiest, you could select
SHOW and in the @{" sub-menu " link menu} select ALL FILES, this will display ALL the 
FILES in the current directory wether they have icons or not, you can then
double click on ANY file and try to run it.

Look at this @{" diagram " system " showpic show_all.iff"} of Show/All Files and this @{" diagram " system " showpic show_icons.iff"} 
of Show/Icons Only.

                                   --------
After using @{" Clean Up " link cleanup} you may want to make the new positions of 
the @{" icons " link icon}, and may be even the @{" window " link window}, permanent, if so, 
then selecting SNAPSHOT will do the trick.

Take a look at this @{" diagram " system " showpic sshot.iff"} and you will understand.

                                   CLEAN UP
                                   --------
This is an extremely handy option, use it regularly. Personally I would
of called it TIDY UP, but there you go! What it does is rearrange the 
@{" icons " link icon} of the currently selected @{" window " link window}, simple as that, 
but effective.
Take a look at this @{" diagram " system " showpic clean_up.iff"} and you will understand.

                               SELECT CONTENTS
                               ---------------
To select or @{" highlight " link mouse} an @{" icon " link icon} you need to @{" click " link mouse} on it once 
with the left mouse button. 

But say you wanted to select a lot of icons all at once for an operation? 
For example, let's say you had sixty files on a floppy disk and that you 
wanted to @{" delete " link delete} fifty of them. You could approach this in one of 
four ways: 

1) You could @{" format " link format} the entire disk, no good because you would lose
   the ten files you wanted to keep.
2) You could select each icon one at a time then select delete from the 
   icons menu, very time consuming indeed.
3) You could hold shift down and click on all fifty icons making them all
   selected and then select delete, still a big job.
4) Or you do the right thing and use SELECT CONTENTS, this would select
   all sixty icons, you could then de-select the ten files you wanted to 
   keep by clicking on them once with the left mouse button and then do a 
   delete from the icons menu to get rid of the fifty that would remain 
   selected.

As you may have gathered, SELECT CONTENTS highlights the whole contents of
the currently selected @{" window " link window}.

FURTHER INFORMATION
-------------------
If you want to @{" drag " link mouse} all of the selected files somewhere you will need 
to hold the shift key down first.

                                    ------
This is the baby brother of @{" Update All "link udall} found in the Workbench menu.
Where UPDATE differs from Update All is that it only updates the selected
@{" Window " link window} and so is faster.
If you make changes to the contents of a window through the @{" Shell " link shell}
or the @{" Execute Command " link xcom} menu item, you may not be able to see 
any changes you have made unless you close and re-open that window. 
Selecting UPDATE will UPDATE the contents of the Window without you having 
to close & re-open it. It's a matter of personal preference, personally I
find it faster to open and close the window myself.

Virtually the same as @{" Open Parent " link oparent} except this closes the
currently selected @{" window " link window}.  
It's a lot easier and quicker to just use each window's CLOSE gadget, 
located at the top left of any window, click on it once with the left mouse

                                 -----------
OPEN PARENT isn't an option you should worry about too much. Basically it 
allows you to step back through nested directories and @{" drawers " link drawers} if 
you get in a tangle. For example, you may have opened a drawer and inside 
that there is another drawer and inside that another drawer and inside 
that...etc.  Using OPEN PARENT you can step back a directory at a time.
Realistically it's a lot easier and quicker to just use each @{" windows " link window} 
@{" close " link close} gadget, located at the top left of any window.

* Presuming you have at least one drawer @{" open " link open}:
* Hold down the right mouse button,

                                  ----------
This is a very useful option, it allows you to easily create a new 
@{" drawer " link drawers} on any disk, complete with an @{" icon " link icon} and your choice of name.

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
* @{" Double click " link mouse} on the disk icon of the disk you wish to create 
  the new drawer on.
* If necessary, double click inside a previously made drawer, 
  if you want to create a sub drawer.
* Hold down the right mouse button,
* Move the mouse pointer to the @{" Window " link window} menu at the top of the screen.
* @{" Highlight " link highlight} NEW DRAWER and then release the right mouse button.
* In the requester that will now appear, type in a new name or leave the 
  default name in, which is called Unnamed1.
* Click on Ok or press return.
* The new drawer is now created, complete with icon.

@{"Click on me " system " showpic newdrawer.iff"} for diagram. 

FURTHER INFORMATION
-------------------
You can create as many drawers as you want, space permitting.

You can create drawers inside drawers, nested as much as you want.

You can use @{" Rename " link rename} to rename any drawer.

If you @{" delete " link delete} a drawer you will automatically delete all of its 
contents, including sub-drawers and their contents.

If you @{" drag " link mouse} a drawer to another part of the disk, or even
to another disk completely, all the drawers contents, including sub-drawers
and their contents will also be copied.

If you create more than one new drawer on a disk and are using the default
name of Unnamed1 then the Amiga automatically makes the next drawer name
Unnamed2, Unnamed3 etc.

Not much to explain here except that REDRAW ALL updates all open @{" windows " link window}

                                  ----------
UPDATE ALL is similar to @{" Update " link update}.

UPDATE ALL re-opens ALL currently opened @{" windows " link window} on the Workbench
screen, updating their appearance. So, if for example, you had been using
a program such as the @{" Shell " link shell}, that changed the contents
of a window Update All would reflect the new contents as @{" Workbench " link workbench}
only updates the window display when needed and quite often will not
reflect the true contents of some windows. Admittadly this is not an often
used function as the same can be achieved by closing and re-opening a
window by hand by @{" clicking " link mouse} on the top left gadget of any window.

                                 -----------
The Trashcan is just another way of @{" Deleting " link delete} files.
The bonus of using the @{" Trashcan " link using the trashcan} is that files are not 
deleted immediately, they are stored ready for deletion by you later. 

If you 'Empty Trash' then any files you have previously @{" dragged " link mouse} to the 
Trash Can for deletion will now be deleted proper, you will NOT be able
to retrieve any files after this operation.

This is a handy little option that allows you to leave an @{" icon " link icon} out 
on the @{" Workbench " link workbench} screen. 
This is useful if you have a program that you use a lot, it saves you from 
having to search out the icon as it's already there sitting on the 
Workbench screen just waiting to be @{" double clicked " link mouse} on.

Example:

Let's presume you use the @{" shell " link shell} a lot. Locate the shell icon and @{" drag " link mouse} 
it out of its drawer and onto the Workbench screen. Now select 
"Leave Out". Reboot your machine and load Workbench and you will find the

Leave Out Cannot be used with floppy disks or the Trashcan. 
You can actually use Leave Out on a floppy disk if the floppy boots up a
Workbench of course.

Admittadly this is of more use to hard drive users than floppy users.

If there is a "Comments" box you can add a note of any relevance, 
few people bother to do this though.

Default tool: This is mainly of use for project icons such as text files.
You can set the default tool for a text file to be your favourite text 
viewer for example and when you double click on the icon it will load your
text viewer and then load the text file in automatically, clever stuff 
what!

To make it a bit clearer here is an example:

letter.doc      < This is a text file

More            < An executable program that displays text files
                  kept in the C drawer.

DEFAULT TOOL:c/More

If you double clicked on Letter.doc More would run and display letter.doc.

If you ever come across the @{" Unable to open your tool " system " showpic dterror.iff"}
error message it is because the @{" path " link path} or tool is missing or wrong. 
Select the icon and then "Information" in the Icons menu and change the 
default tool to one you have on your system disk. Problem solved.

Allows you define different start up options for certain programs or files.
consult the documentation for any particular program to find out what, if
any tool types are available.

@node Copy
                                     COPY
                                     ----
The Workbench COPY is pretty bad really and most people who get to know
@{" Workbench " link workbench} use a nice friendly @{" P.D " link pd} copier, I recommend Super-Duper 
copier available from ANY P.D library in the universe for a few quid.

But, we are here to learn how to use the COPY function.

Making a copy of a disk
-----------------------
To make a copy (or backup if you like) of a disk, here is what you do:

If you only have one disk drive
-------------------------------
First of all make sure the disk you want to make a copy of is 
@{" write protected " link write}, just in case things go wrong or you 
accidentally get your source and destination disks mixed up.

Insert the disk that you want to make a copy of into your internal drive.
The internal drive is called DF0: the disk you want a copy of is called 
the source disk.

@{" Click " link mouse} on the source disks @{" icon " link icon} once to @{" highlight " link highlight} it. 
Select COPY from the Icons @{" menu " link menu}. @{"View diagram" system " showpic copy_dia.iff"}

You will now get a message telling you the operation will take five disk 
swaps, this is because you only have one drive, ALL Amiga owners most 
definitely need a second drive, so go get one now! It's like having a 
washing machine, you can manage without one but once you have it you can't 
believe how you survived without it.

Click on Continue, you will now get another message prompting you to 
insert the source disk, @{" View diagram " system " showpic copy1.iff"}
you have already done that so click on continue.
The copying will now start and will be represented by a graphical 
percentage bar meter.

After a short time You will be prompted to insert the destination disk.
The destination disk is the disk you want to copy onto, this should be a 
blank or an unwanted disk as EVERYTHING on it will be overwritten.

Make sure your destination disk is NOT write protected, take out the source
disk and insert the destination disk and click on continue.
 
Repeat this procedure until the operation is complete.

You will now have a perfect copy of your source disk.

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
  Copying a disk on a single drive
* Insert the source disk, write protected.
* Click once on its icon to highlight it.
* Hold down the right mouse button,
* Move the mouse pointer to the ICONS menu at the top of the screen.
* Highlight "Copy" and then release the right mouse button.
* Click on continue.
* Click on continue at the next requester as well
* When prompted remove the source disk and insert the destination disk, 
  which should NOT be write protected.
* Click on continue.


If you have a second drive
--------------------------
Things are a lot easier for owners of a second floppy drive, known as DF1:

First of all make sure the disk you want to make a copy of is write
protected, just in case things go wrong.

Insert the disk that you want to make a copy of into your internal drive.
The internal drive is called DF0: the disk you want a copy of is called the
source disk.

The destination disk is the disk you want to copy onto, this should be a 
blank or an unwanted disk as EVERYTHING on it will be overwritten.
Put this disk into your external drive, DF1:

Now, click on the source disks icon once and keeping the left mouse 
pressed down @{" drag " link mouse} it on to the destination disks icon.

A requester will now appear asking you to insert your source and 
destination disks, which you have already done, so click on continue. 
@{" View Diagram " system " showpic copy2.iff"}

The copying process will now start and no disk swapping is required, in 
fact because of the Amiga's great @{" multitasking " link multitasking} ability 
you can go off and do something else like typing a letter into your word 
processor while your disk is being copied.

When the copying has finished you will notice that the destination disk has
been automatically renamed to "Copy_of_" . If this is not desirable then 
use the @{" Rename " link Rename} option to rename the disk to that of your choice.

CAUTION: Remove the source disk first as the Amiga does not like holding 
two disks with exactly the same name, it gets all confused you know!

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
  Copying a disk using two drives
* Insert the source disk, write protected, into DF0:
* Insert the destination disk into DF1:
* Click once on the source disk icon and drag it over to the destination
  disks icon and release the mouse button (Drag and drop)
* Click on continue.


Copying files to and from disks
-------------------------------
The @{" Drag and Drop " link mouse} method described above can be employed to move 
single files from disk to disk or even to different parts of the same disk.

As an example let us say we have a disk with a drawer called pics which is
currently empty and a picture file called picture.Iff.  To copy Picture.Iff
into the drawer "pics" all we need to do is drag picture.Iff and drop it 
onto the "pics" drawer icon.  The result will be that Picture.Iff has been 
copied into the "Pics" drawer and  the original Picture.Iff will be 
deleted.

@node Format

                              FORMATTING A DISK
                              -----------------
To be able to copy your files such as text, programs and pictures to a
disk it first needs to be formatted. When you buy a new disk it is
unformatted so before it can be used on the Amiga you need to format it.
This section will tell you everything you need to know about formatting
floppy disks. 

First of all how do you know if a disk has already been formatted or not?
Insert the disk and if the disk @{" icon " link icon} comes up as  DF0:???? then you 
need to format the disk.

If the Icon came up as anything other than DF0:???? then there could be
data already on the disk.
Remember once you have formatted a disk all the contents of that disk are
erased forever, although there are "Salvaging" programs available.

Please take a look at this @{" diagram " system " showpic format.iff"}

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
* @{" Write enable " link write} the disk to be formatted (close the tab)
* Insert a disk to be formatted.
* @{" Click " link mouse} once on the icon of the disk you wish to format.
* Hold down the right mouse button,
* Move the mouse pointer to the ICONS @{" menu " link menu} at the top of the screen.
* @{" Highlight " link highlight} "Format Disk" and then release the right mouse button.
* Click on FORMAT
* A confirmation requester will then appear, click on "Format" again.
* You will now see a count down bar while your disk is being formatted.
* When the format has finished the disk will be initialized, this makes
  the disk bootable. 

You now know all that is needed to format a disk, read on if you want to
learn more.


FURTHER INFORMATION
-------------------
If the disk you are about to format has been formatted before, you can 
choose "Quick Format" from the "Format Disk" requester, this formats your 
disk in a couple of seconds. There is a slight drawback with quick format,
it does not check your disk for errors so stick to the normal format if
you want to play safe.  You cannot use "Quick Format" on a new unformatted
disk though.

You can change the name of the disk by clicking the mouse pointer inside 
the @{" window " link window} named "New Volume Name:" Use the backspace key
(located to the left of the DEL key and has a left pointing arrow on it)
to erase the text and type in a new name. You can call a disk virtually 
anything you want. 

Hint:
You can use the cursor keys (located below DEL and HELP keys) to scroll 
along the text and change parts of it.

You can choose not to have a @{" Trashcan " link using the trashcan} icon put on your 
disk by clicking the check box and making the tick disappear. A Traschcan 
allows you to @{" drag " link mouse} files to it for deleting.

Other options available are: 

"Fast File System", Using this will speed up disk access but the disk will
only work on Amiga's with Workbench 3 or more. So if you plan to distribute
your disk bare that in mind.
 
"International Mode" Corrects a few case-sensitivity problems, but means 
your disk will only work on Amiga's with Workbench 2 or above. 

"Directory caching" Is another option to enhance the speed of disk access,
namely making directories open faster. Again your disk will require
Workbench 3 or above.

As a general rule, format your disk with the following options, especially 
if you want to distribute your disk:


      PUT TRASHCAN   NO/YES (Doesn't matter either way, your choice)
  FAST FILE SYSTEM   NO
INTERNATIONAL MODE   NO
 DIRECTORY CACHING   NO

If you cancel a format during operation the disk will be unusable until you
fully re-format it.

There is in-fact another way to format a disk. If you open the SYS drawer
on your @{" Workbench " link workbench} disk you should see an icon called "Format" this does
exactly the same job using the same software as described above, the only
difference being that you do not need to select a disk icon you select the
disk to be formatted from a displayed list.
 
One final note, don't worry too much about naming your disk you can do that
at any time by using the @{" Rename " link rename} option, which can also 
be found in the Icons menu.

to @{" highlight " link highlight} it. 
Selecting RENAME from the ICONS @{" menu " link menu} at the top of the
Workbench screen allows you to change the name of ANY visible icon on the 
workbench screen. You can change the name of @{" drawers " link drawers}, files or a disk.
This is especially useful if you have copied a disk using @{" Copy " link copy}, as you 
can delete the words COPY_OF_ . See @{" Copy " link copy}

When choosing a name to use it is advisable not use spaces before, after 
or in the new name as this can lead to confusion.
You change the name of the icon by using the backspace key to erase the 
text. Type in your new name and then click on O.k. Click on CANCEL if you
change your mind at any time and the icon will remain unaltered. 

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
* Make sure the disk is not @{" write protected " link write}.
* Highlight the icon by clicking on it once with the left mouse button.
* Hold down the right mouse button,
* Move the mouse pointer to the ICONS menu at the top of the screen.
* Highlight "Rename" and then release the right mouse button.
* Use backspace to delete the old name.
* Type in your new name.
* Click on OK.
 
Take a look at this @{" DIAGRAM " system " showpic rename.iff"} and then this @{" DIAGRAM " system " showpic rename2.iff"}

You now know all that is needed to use RENAME, read on if you want to
learn more.

FURTHER INFORMATION
-------------------
You can select multiple icons to rename by first selecting an icon and then
holding down the shift key, keeping the shift key pressed down you can 
click away on many icons, they will now be all selected. Select rename from
the menu and each time you finish renaming an icon the next in line will 
appear for you.

Instead of deleting the old name with backspace a short-cut to do this is
the key combination of Amiga+x that is, hold down the right hand Amiga key
and then press X.

Instead of clicking on Ok you can press return if so desired, this is true
of most parts of the @{" Workbench " link workbench} environment.

This option is for simply resetting your @{" Workbench " link workbench} to its default

The tools menu isn't a complete waste of time though, there are programs
such as the brilliant @{" P.D " link pd} utility, Tools Deamon, that uses the Tools 
menu to add your own custom menu. This is especially useful to hard drive 
owners, who can set up a menu to have all their most often used/favourite 
programs in a fast and easy to use way. This saves you searching through 
stacks of @{" drawers " link drawers} and files trying to find that elusive program.

There are plenty of other programs that use the Tools menu trick .

Selecting Backdrop from the Workbench @{" menu " link menu} basically means
wether or not you will have a @{" window " link window} around your @{" Workbench " link workbench} screen.
Click on this @{" Button " system " showpic bdropoff.iff"} to see a pictorial diagram, then click the

                               ---------------
How do you run a program that does not have an @{" icon? " link icon}
The general answer to this question is to use the @{" Shell " link shell}, however there
is another way, using the EXECUTE COMMAND... item from the Workbench 
menu. Simply select Execute Command, type in the @{" path " link path} and the programs
name and @{" click " link mouse} on Ok. If all is well the program will run.

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH

* Hold down the right mouse button,
* Move the mouse pointer to the Workbench menu at the top of the screen.
* @{" Highlight " link mouse} "Execute Command..." and then release the right mouse

* Click on Ok.

Or for a more graphical explanation click @{" here " system " showpic execute1.iff"} and then @{" here " system " showpic execute2.iff"}.

@node path
                               WHAT IS A PATH?
                                -------------
A path, as far as the Amiga and most other computers are concerned, is 
a route leading to the location of a desired file.

Straight into some examples:

Let's say you have a blank disk and you have @{" named " link rename} the blank disk 
'MY_DISK'. Then you @{" copied " link copy} a file called 'FRED.TXT' onto it. 
The path for 'FRED.TXT' would be:

MY_DISK:FRED.TXT 

It doesn't matter what disk drive MY_DISK is in as you have called the disk
by name. You could also of called the path:

DF0:FRED.TXT 

In this case you are telling the Amiga that the file FRED.TXT is on the
disk in the internal drive. 
If you wanted to use the external drive (DF1:) you could use:

DF1:FRED.TXT

It's probably best to use the actual name of the disk if you can though.

Remember that after the disks name you MUST put a colon (:) this tells
the Amiga that you mean a device, which means a peripheral like a drive
or printer etc.

Now supposing 'FRED.TXT' was inside a drawer called 'LETTER' on 'MY_DISK'?

MY_DISK:LETTERS/FRED.TXT

would work perfectly. The '/' tells the Amiga to look in a drawer.

What about sub-directories then?

MY_DISK:TEXT_FILES/LETTERS/FRED.TXT

and so on.

Most decent programs on the Amiga let you select a programs path by giving
you a file requester (we will look at file requesters next volume), 
where all you have to do is locate the file and @{" click " link mouse} on
it. Alternatively, running most programs will simply mean double clicking 
on the programs @{" icon " link icon}, so don't worry too much about this
sort of thing if you are still learning.
@endnode
@node shell
                              WHAT IS THE SHELL?
                              ------------------
I would have to write a whole book to cover this subject properly and 
indeed there are books out there that cover the shell. For this tutorial 
though I will just give you a fleeting glimpse of how to use the shell. 
As this guide is primarily meant for absolute beginners I wouldn't want to 
go too far anyway, it would probably confuse rather than help most 
beginners.

So in a nut shell (pun, fully intended) the SHELL program can be found in 
the System drawer of your @{" Workbench " link workbench} disk. @{" Double click " link mouse} 
on the SHELL @{" icon " link icon} and a @{" window " link window} will open and a cursor 
will await your command. 
Here is a more graphical @{" explanation " system " showpic shell.iff"} of the shell.

When you have finished with the shell you can get rid of it by clicking the
top left hand gadget of the shell window or by typing in EndCli followed by
return.

The point of the shell is very similar to that of the @{" Execute Command " link xcom}
option from the Workbench menu, simply type the @{" path " link path} and name of the 
program you wish to run.

The SHELL comes in useful if you want some info on your machine/disks or 
files, for example, type in DIR and a listing of the current disks 
directory should be shown. Now try AVAIL to find out how much @{" memory " link memory}
you have available, and it goes on.

The commands we used above are actually tiny programs supplied on your 
Workbench disk in the C drawer.

There is a lot more to the shell than that of course, you can for instance 
run programs with 'arguments' which means telling the program to run in 
certain ways. I will take a deeper look at this subject in Vol 4 of this 
guide but for now we need to learn the basics.

@node highlight
                      HIGHLIGHTING AN ICON OR MENU ITEM

To highlight an @{" icon " link icon} is simplicity itself. 
just @{" click " link mouse} on the desired icon once with the left mouse
button. If you look at the icon it will now be inversed. 
I have also used the term 'highlight' when talking about selecting a 
@{" menu item " link menu}, when the menu item has inversed (turned black)
this means it is highlighted. 

Please take a look at this @{" Diagram " system " showpic highlight.iff"}

To the right of some items in @{" menus " link menu} are key short-cuts. 
Most of these short-cuts usually start with the A Amiga key symbol, 
this key is located on the direct right hand side of the space bar on your 
keyboard.  To use the short-cut you must press and hold down the Amiga key 
and then press the corresponding key next to it, for example the short-cut

Windows are areas that you can open/close/move and size. A window usually

Take a look at this @{" picture " system " showpic windows.iff"} now to get a better idea of what I am 
talking about.

When you @{" Open " link open} a disk @{" icon " link icon} or a drawer icon a window will open.

I will now explain the markings on the window diagram you should have just
looked at.

Close gadget: You @{" click " link mouse} on the close gadget to 
              completely close the window.

Zoom gadget : Click on this to toggle the size of the window to small or 
              large. Experiment.

Depth gadget: Changes the position of the window, if it is behind other
              windows it will be brought to the front and will become the 
              currently selected window. To send a window to the rear hold
              the Shift key down whilst clicking on the depth gadget.

Scroll bar  : Click and hold the mouse pointer over this bar and @{" drag " link mouse}
              it to see parts of the window not currently in view.

Scroll arrows: Have the same purpose as the scroll bar except you just 
               click on them periodically.

Sizing gadget: This allows you to adjust the size of a window. To use, 
               click on the sizing gadget and hold down the left mouse 
               button. Now move the mouse to a new position. Release the 
               mouse button when the window is of the desired size.

                     ABOUT WRITE PROTECTING A FLOPPY DISK
                     ------------------------------------
A floppy disk can be in two states, write protected and write enabled.

If the disk is write protected it cannot be formatted, files cannot be
deleted from it or saved to it and best of all @{" viri " link viri} cannot infect it!

If the disk is write enabled it can be formatted and written to.

When you purchase a new disk it is usually write enabled.
To write protect it locate the @{" write protect " system " showpic disk.iff"} tab 
and close it using your finger nail or a pointed implement such as a pen or 
small screwdriver.

@node viri
                            SOME FACTS ABOUT VIRI
                              ------------------
A virus is just a small program, written by a bored/nasty programmer 
and meant to cause us users a lot of hassle and sometimes money.
There are hundreds of different "strains" of viri on the Amiga.

Basically there are only two types of virus prevalent on the Amiga,
Link and Boot. I will cover Link viri in a later volume, but here I will 
tell you about Boot viri as they are the most common of the two.

Some viri can format your disk, some wipe the odd file, some just flash up
an insulting message, one even reverses your mouse controls!

So, how does a virus get into your system and onto your disks?

A little story:

Fred Bloggs gets a new Amiga and asks his friend Joe Brown if he has any 
@{" P.D " link pd} disks he can make a copy of, unknowingly Joe gives Fred an 
infected disk he had previously got off another friend. Anyway, Fred runs 
the disk and the virus loads in from the infected disk and copies itself 
into Freds Amigas @{" memory " link memory}. The virus copies itself into a special 
part of memory that only gets cleared when the Amiga is turn off by the 
power pack and not turned back on for at least 20 seconds. 
So a copy of the virus is sitting in memory, and the original virus is 
still on the disk. Fred finishes playing the game and decides to load 
another disk, he flicks off the power supply for a second or two inserts 
the new (clean) disk and turns the power back on. 
The virus has survived as the Amiga operating system didn't have long 
enough to clear all of its memory properly. Fred's game is loading, the 
virus is monitoring freds Amiga for any disk activity, the virus checks to
see if the disk is @{" write protected " link write} or not, it isn't, 
Great! says the virus and copies itself onto the new disk. After copying 
itself onto 20 different disks the virus activates itself proper and lets 
fred know of its presence, the virus prints a nasty message on the screen 
and wiped the disk in freds drive, the disk just happened to be an 
expensive application fred bought last week. This will happen when each 
copy of the virus has copied itself another 20 times. Can you see how 
within a few days all of Freds disks were infected? If Fred had taken a 
few simple precautions none of this would of happened.

* Always keep your floppy disks write protected at all times, only write 
  enable them when absolutely necessary.

* Use an up to date virus checker on any new disk you get before running
  the disk proper. Look at this @{" picture " system " showpic virus.iff"}.


WARNING:
If you virus check a commercial game be careful as most commercial games 
(and some P.D games and demos) use a custom loader on the bootblock which 
most virus checkers will detect as Non-standard, unless the virus checker
says the disk has a virus and gives you the name of the virus don't try 
and kill it. As a general rule, if a virus checker says the disk has a 
non standard boot block then 99.9% of the time it will be harmless or will
be a programmers boot loader, if it is a boot loader and you kill it the 
disk will be rendered useless. This only applies if you use an up to date
virus checker.

* When resetting the Amiga to use another program make sure you turn off 
  from the power pack and wait at least 20-30 seconds. The down side of 
  this is the Amiga's circuitry is at it's most vunerable to electrical 
  surges when switch on from the mains.

Beginners should NOT use the Amiga/Amiga/ctrl keys to do a warm reset.
UNLESS you WRITE PROTECT all of your disks.

If you think you have a virus on a disk and are not sure what to do, send
me the disk with a cover note and a SAE and I will check it out for you.
No SAE no reply.

**************************************************************************
Once again I cannot stress how important it is to keep your disks write
protected, if you do a virus will NEVER spread into your collection it will
stay on its original disk and sit in memory. W A I T I N G for you to make
a mistake like inserting an unprotected disk..

@node mouse

                             ALL ABOUT YOUR MOUSE
                             --------------------
The mouse is a great tool used by you to communicate with your Amiga.
The operation of a mouse is simplicity itself, though first time users of 
a mouse tend to find the concept hard to get used to. After a few hours 
of use though even a child can handle a mouse with ease.

For best results the mouse requires a flat surface to operate on. If you
don't own a mouse mat then buy one for around £2 upwards.

The standard Amiga mouse has two buttons the right hand button, commonly
referred to as the menu button and the left hand button known as the
selection button. Throughout this tutorial I will refer to these buttons
as left mouse button and right mouse button to save any confusion.

Things you can do with your mouse:
----------------------------------
Pointing: move the mouse and watch the mouse pointer on the screen.

Clicking: Press and release the left mouse button once.

Double-Clicking: Two quick clicks on the left mouse button.

Holding Down: Holding down a mouse button.

Dragging: Hold down the left mouse button and drag an icon/window or 
          screen to a new position and then releasing the button. 
          Also known as drag and drop.

The mouse will give you many years good service if you clean it once in a
while. If your mouse seems to be dragging, turn it upside down and unscrew
the holder. Inside is a ball, clean this with warm soapy water and dry it
thoroughly. Inside the mouse casing you will see some rollers that by now
have probably picked up a lot of dust and dirt. Get a small brush, like 
the ones you sometimes get with electric shavers and clean the rollers.
Your mouse will be as good as new.

FURTHER INFORMATION
-------------------
Just as a matter of interest or indeed if your mouse is broken, did you 
know that you can actually control the mouse pointer with the keyboard?
Hold down the left Amiga key and move the pointer with the cursor keys.
Hold down shift as well to move the pointer in bigger steps. The left and
right alt keys act as the mouse buttons. Also the left mouse button can
be emulated with the firebutton on a joystick in port one.

@node Icon
                               What is an Icon?
                               ----------------
An Icon represents a file on your Workbench screen. It is, in effect, a 
small picture. An Icon is a separate file in itself, but can be manipulated
using the @{" Information " link information} option from the Icons @{" menu " link menu}.

If you @{ "Delete " link delete} an Icon, @{" Workbench " link workbench} will automatically delete the file or 
program it represents.

If you @{" Open " link open} an Icon it will attempt to execute the file it represents.

You can manipulate the position of an Icon by @{" dragging " link mouse} it to a desired
position, and then using @{" Snapshot " link snapshot} to save its position.

Different types of Icons
------------------------
A disk icon represents a Disk (otherwise known as a Volume) and only 
appears on the actual Workbench @{" window " link window}.

A drawer icon represents a directory, which can hold programs/files or even
more @{" drawers " link drawers}, known a sub-drawers or sub-directories.

A tool icon represents an executable program, like the clock utility 
program.  A tool can be run by @{" double clicking " link mouse} on it.

A project icon represents a file created by a tool, such as a text file or 
a picture file.

@{" Click here to see some typical icons " system " showpic disk_icon.iff"}

The Trashcan icon simply represents the @{" Trashscan " link using the trashcan}.

There are also a set of built in icons called pseudo icons that the Amiga
uses to represent files that do not already have an icon associated with 
them. To see these pseudo icons you need to use the Show/All files from 
the Windows menu.
@{" Click here to see Pseudo icons " system " showpic psudeo_icons.iff"}.

@node Menu
                               ALL ABOUT MENUS
                               ---------------

Menus can usually be found a the top of the screen like on your 
@{" Workbench " link workbench}.  To access the items in a menu hold down the
right mouse button and move the mouse over the title bar. 
A list of items will appear. Move the mouse pointer down the list of 
items, notice how each item is @{" highlighted " link highlight} as your 
pointer moves over it. When you have highlighted your desired item release
the mouse button.

If an item in the menu is ghosted then this means that particular item is
not usable at the current time, for example, the Format item in the 
@{" Icons "link icon} menu is ghosted until you have @{" clicked " link mouse} on a disk 
icon to be formatted.

To the right of some items are key @{" short-cuts " link shortcut}. Most of these 
short-cuts usually start with the, A , Amiga key symbol. 
This key is located on the direct right hand side of the space bar on your
keyboard.  To use the short-cut you must press and hold down the Amiga key
and then press the corresponding key next to it. 
for example the short-cut to use the 'Open' item in the 'Icons' menu is 
Amiga O, so you press and hold the Amiga key and then press O.

If the name of an item is followed by three dots (...) this means a 
requester of some sort will follow if you select that item. 
For example, try the 'Information' item in the 'Icons' menu.

If you see a '>>' symbol this means that item has sub-items attached to it.
Select the 'Snapshot item' in the @{" Windows " link window} menu for an example.

A tick (or checkmark if you like) indicates that particular option is in
use. See 'Backdrop' in the 'Workbench menu'.

Don't forget a programs window must be selected before you can access the
menu bar. If the window isn't active just click anywhere inside it.

                              ------------------
You can use the Trashcan as a temporary store for files you want to delete.
Once stored in the Trashcan files are quite safe until you either turn off
your Amiga (or reset it) or if you use @{" Empty Trash " link empty trash}. 
'EMPTY TRASH' then @{" deletes " link delete} the contents of the 'TRASHCAN' forever.

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
To store a file ready for deletion into the Trashcan.
* @{" Click " link mouse} on the desired @{" icon " link icon} with the left mouse button.
* Keeping the mouse button pressed
* @{" Drag " link mouse} the icon over to the Trashcan and then release the mouse button.

Where using the Trashcan comes in useful is if you decide not to delete one
or more of the files already in the can.

QUICK GUIDE IN PLAIN ENGLISH
----------------------------
To retrieve a file from the Trashcan.
* @{" Double click " link mouse} on the Trashcan icon.
* Click on the desired icon with the left mouse button.
* Keeping the mouse button pressed
* Drag the icon over to your desired location and then release the mouse 
  button. The file is now safe.

Please look at this @{" diagram " system " showpic trash2.iff"}

You can select mutilple files by first selecting a file and then holding
down the SHIFT key and then selecting more files. Now drag them out.

                              ALL ABOUT DRAWERS
                              -----------------
Imagine a floppy disk with 100 pictures on it. Imagine that the pictures 
covered ten different subjects. Wouldn't It would be nice to be able to 
group the pictures into ten different categories and lump them all in one 
place for quicker reference? It certainly would!

This is where drawers come in real handy. You can create as many drawers as
you want on a disk and call them what you want. Going back to our disk of
pictures, we could create ten drawers and name each drawer to reflect its
contents , for example CAR_PICS, TRAIN_PICS, BOAT_PICS, PLANE_PICS, etc..
We could then @{" drag " link mouse} the ten pictures for a certain category
into their corresponding drawer.

You could, in theory, use the Amiga without ever HAVING to create a drawer,
but drawers are there for our convenience and they are VERY useful.
Virtually every disk you will ever come across will have drawers on it so 
you may as well get used to the idea and benefit from their use.

See @{" New Drawer " link newdrawer} on how create a drawer.

To open a drawer just @{" double click " link mouse} on it.

                         HOW TO OPERATE THIS PROGRAM
                         ---------------------------
This tutorial uses Commodore's AMIGAGUIDE document displayer. The reason
for using this software is that it allows interaction of words and 
pictures, amongst other things. 

*! USE THE UP & DOWN ARROW KEYS TO SCROLL UP AND DOWN THIS TEXT SCREEN !*

Along the top of the screen you will see a line of buttons as follows:

 CONTENTS   INDEX      HELP     RETRACE   BROWSE <  BROWSE >

If you click on the CONTENTS button with the left mouse button you will be
returned to the main menu screen, the place where this program started.
CONTENTS will be ghosted if you are already in the CONTENTS screen.

The INDEX button is not used in this tutorial.

HELP, well, you are reading this so you know what that does!

Clicking on RETRACE will literally RETRACE your steps through this guide.
For example, let's say you @{" clicked " link mouse} on the COPY button, 
read that then clicked on the FORMAT button, retrace would take you back 
to COPY and RETRACE again would take you back to the CONTENTS screen.
RETRACE is very useful because in most texts I have used buttons on key 
words that you can click on to get a full explanation of that term. When
you have finished reading the definition of that term just use RETRACE 
to go back to the exact place in the previous text that you came from.
Incidentally there is no RETRACE in this particular file as it's a 
separate database file from the main menu, that's why it has opened a new
@{" window " link window}. You can in fact click on the top left hand 
gadget of this window (The one next to the word help) to exit back to the
main menu.

DO NOT @{" click " link mouse} on the gadget in the top left hand corner
of the screen (The one next to ABGTWB3 VOL 1) as you will exit this 
program, if you do then you will have to turn your Amiga off and re-load.

BROWSE < ,Clicking on this will let you BROWSE through the pages of text
in this whole document one by one. BROWSE < takes you backward.

If you want to PRINT out any part of this tutorial you can select PRINT
from the pull down @{" Menu " link menu} at the top of the screen.
To do this first make sure your printer is on line and ready. Hold down 
the right mouse button and move the mouse pointer to the top left hand of
the screen. Move the mouse pointer to the word PRINT and then release the 
mouse button. This disk is set up for a standard epson printer, so should
work on most machines.

Don't forget that most texts are longer than the visible screen, keep an
eye on the blue meter bar on the right hand side of the screen, click on
the up and down arrows to scroll through the text. Alternatively you can
@{" drag " link mouse} the bar up and down with your mouse or even easier
use the arrow keys, it's up to you. 

If you click on a button that displays a picture, just click the right
mouse button to exit the picture and return back to the text.

Now click on the CONTENTS button at the top of the screen for the
main menu. Good luck..

                The Absolute Beginners Guide To Workbench 3.0 
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                 INTRODUCTION
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Steve Bye Feb 9th 1996

This disk has been updated/fixed/enhanced since the Amiga Format cover disk
release (Dec 95), see the "Important.Doc" on this disk.

To read 'Important.Doc' boot this disk (Insert disk in drive and then
switch on your Amiga) and press 'n' then return, when prompted.

This is the first volume of what I hope will be a long running series of
tutorials on using Workbench 3. This disk concentrates on the Workbench
menu's, though a lot more incidental information is also covered by way of
reference.

Why has it taken a whole disk just to cover the menus? You may ask!
Because I have looked at a lot of other Workbench tutorials and none of
them seemed to go into much depth and took a lot for granted, such as the
user knowing how to format a disk for example. In this series of tutorials
if an action such as format is mentioned it will be a "button" that you
can click on and this will take you to an in-depth explanation of the
term and why/how/when to use it.  You will also usually find an
accompanying diagram and a "IN PLAIN ENGLISH" guide, giving at least two
and more usually three different ways to understand and digest the subject.
I would like to point out here that most of the screen shots containing a 
picture of the menus in action are actually reconstructed by hand, 
I am not very artistic but they are as close as I could make them. 
I just could not find a screen grabber that could grab Workbenches menus.
Another point I should mention is that I have taken for granted that you
are using an Amiga WITHOUT a hard drive and have to load Workbench from
floppy disk. I have adopted this approach as being the most likely set up
for an Amiga beginner. If you do have a hard drive it doesn't matter 
anyway, just don't get confused if I say something like Load your 
Workbench floppy!


If you have any constructive criticisms/ideas for improvements, or want a
say in how future volumes will be written then please feel free to write
to me at the address below. I would also love to know if you have actually 
learnt anything from this guide! If not tell me what I am doing wrong.
Please include a stamp if you want a reply. I will also try to solve any 
problems you may have relating to the use of this program or a subject 
within it. Please remember though, no stamp, no reply. My address is:

                                HINTS AND TIPS
                                --------------

           Follow these few simple tips and you won't go far wrong

* ALWAYS keep your floppy disks @{" write protected " link write} this 
  very simple precaution can save you many hours/days/weeks of misery
  with @{" viri " link viri} and corrupted disks.

* NEVER eject a disk from the drive until ALL disk activity has completley
  stopped, not just the drive light, listen to the whirring as well.

* Never plug/unplug peripherals such as drives/printers/modems/cdroms 
  while your Amiga is switched on, the manual even tells you not to unplug
  your mouse while the machine is on, that's a bit over the top I think
  but they must know! After all they created the machine!!

* ALWAYS check any new program disks with a good recent Virus Checking
  program BEFORE running them.

* If you have a hard drive have a virus checker running in background
  so it constantly checks @{" memory " link memory} for viri and checks any disk inserted.

* Give your @{" mouse " link mouse} a clean as soon as it starts to
  drag a bit, this will stop frustration for you and prolong the life
  of your squeaky friend.

* Until you know exactly what you are doing you should NOT use the 
  Amiga/Amiga/ctrl keys to do a warm reset.  The main reason for this
  is that if your machine has a virus in memory a warm reset will NOT
  clear it out. Turn off your machine by the power pack and wait at 
  least 20 seconds.

* A second disk drive is ESSENTIAL unless you want to go insane.
  You can pick up a second hand one for about £35-£40, but they are rare
  as once you have one you will not want to part with it.

* A hard drive is desirable, especially if you are a power user, or want
  to program or use other creativity tools or if you use @{" Workbench " link workbench} a lot.
  If you do buy a hard drive get the biggest capacity you can afford, and
  I bet that won't be big enough.

* A printer would be highly beneficial to most people for obvious reasons.
  For a beginner a cheap old 9 pin dot matrix will suffice. From about
  £50 second hand or about £100 new. Well worth it.

@node multitasking
                            WHAT IS MULTITASKING?
                            --------------------
I am only going to skip over this subject lightly here as it will be 
fully covered in a future volume. Basically, multitasking is the ability
of a computer to run more than one program simultaneously. A very good
example can be seen by @{" double clicking " link mouse} on the utilities drawer on
your @{" workbench " link workbench} disk inside the drawer are two programs,
'Multiview' and 'Clock'. double click on the clock, and when that is 
running double click on the same clock @{" icon " link icon} again, you now 
have two clocks running, though to see them you will need to @{" drag " link mouse}
the top-most clock to one side to see the one beneath. 
You are now multitasking. You could keep on loading clocks, until you run 
out of @{" memory " link memory}. 

A drawback of multitasking is that each program takes its slice of 
processor time because in reality a computer can only perform one operation
at a time. The Amiga is simply switching from one clock to the next but it 
is doing it so fast it appears to be happening all at once.

So what USE is multitasking? You may ask, well, what about copying a disk
whilst typing and then printing a letter with a bit of Amiga music playing
in the background? 99% of PC users are stunned when they see the power of
the Amiga multitasking. Most PC's shudder to a halt when multitasking.

Multitasking isn't something many Amiga beginners tend to appreciate but 
as you slowly discover the many and great benefits it holds you will soon 
warm to it.

@node memory
                                 ABOUT MEMORY
                                 ------------
Memory is a term used to describe storage space inside a computer.
There are many different types of memory, but at this stage of the tutorial
I will just mention the two most important, RAM and ROM.

ROM stands for Read Only Memory, and this is fixed inside your computer. 
It can't be written to, it can only be read, as the name would suggest.
This part of your Amiga is only of direct interest to programmers and a
beginner needs to know nothing about ROM at this stage, suffice to say 
that a part of the Amiga's operating system resides there called Kickstart.
 
RAM stand for Random Access Memory, this is memory that we load programs
into. A standard Amiga A1200 has two megabytes of Chip Ram and no Fast ram. 

Chip Ram is memory accessible by the Amigas custom chips and the 
processor. It is also used to store graphics and sounds. 
It is also used by programs when no Fast memory is available.
Chip ram takes the Amiga longerto access than Fast Ram.

You can increase the amount of memory in your Amiga by fitting a RAM 
upgrade, this will be Fast ram. 

Fast Ram is memory that is only accessible by the main processor. 
This is where most programs are stored and tend to run a lot quicker than
from Chip Ram, hence the name.

For the absolute beginner this is all academic, you do not need to 
understand anything about memory at this stage.

The Ram disk is always available if you have loaded @{" Workbench " link workbench}. 
To see the Ram Disk icon @{" Click here " system " showpic ram_disk.iff"}.
Using the Ram Disk is like having an extra disk drive, except it's super 
fast. The Ram disk, as its name would suggest uses your Amiga's @{" memory " link memory} 
as if it was a disk, and its size is only limited by the amount of free 
memory you have available. Its main use is as a temporary storage place 
for files. If you look carefully you will find Workbench itself uses the 
Ram Disk to store odds and ends for its own purposes.

FURTHER INFORMATION
-------------------
When you turn off your computer the contents of the Ram Disk are lost 
FOREVER, so be careful.

The Ram Disk is always 100% full because it expands and contracts it size
as required, so because it says 100% full, don't think you can't @{" copy " link copy}
anything into it.

You cannot copy a whole disk to the Ram Disk by @{" dragging " link mouse} a disks 
icon over the Ram Disks icon, instead you must @{" open " link open} up the
Ram disk icon first and then drag the disk you want to copy into the Ram 
Disks @{" window " link window}.  A @{" drawer " link drawers} will be 
created automatically with the disks name and its contents will be neatly 
inside the new drawer.

There are many uses for the Ram Disk which I hope to cover at a later date.

                            What is Public Domain?
                            ---------------------
Public Domain (P.D from now on) is an incredible concept. A programmer 
spends weeks, months or even years writing a program and then GIVES it away
to all you fellow users! Sounds unbelievable I know, but it's true.
As you know Volume 1 of this tutorial is in fact P.D. I released this into
P.D as a form of free advertising and to gauge by feedback if it is worth
my while to continue with this series.

Now you may be thinking there must be a catch, well, you don't actually
get it for nothing if you go to a PD library, you have to pay a small
handling charge, normally between £1-£2 per disk, although there are 
libraries who charge anything up to £4 a disk. If you have paid more
than £2.50 for a PD disk then look elsewhere. Some new P.D libraries
looking for customers sell disks of P.D at less than 50p, as a rule these
libraries do not last long (so be careful) or eventually have to put their
prices up in line with the rest.
 
I recommend 17 Bit Software as the best all round library in the UK, 
they are not the cheapest at £1.50 a disk but the service is exceptional 
and you get your order fast, with a friendly service, end of plug.

Getting back to the subject at hand. When a program is released as PD it
means you can basically do what you want with it, give it away, copy it,
sell it even! Though the unwritten PD rule is that you should not make a 
profit from PD, only cover your costs. You would be forgiven in thinking 
that PD programs must be crap! Well a lot of it is but then again some of 
the best ever pieces of Amiga software are PD, check out some magazine 
cover disks for some good PD, you will be surprised at the quality of some
it, there are some real gems out there. Here is a list of some of my 
favourite PD programs that you could do worse than have in your collection:

Tools Daemon: (A @{" workbench " link workbench} menu system, best for hard drive users)

Filemaster  : (A brilliant directory utility, copy,delete,format etc.)

Edword      : (Best text editor, this tutorial was written with it!)

Super Duper : (Fastest/best disk copier, great)

Arestaure   : (Recovers deleted files, has saved my life loads of times.)

Guiarc      : Excellent de-archiver, easy to use.

Dos Trace   : Tracks what your Amiga is doing internally, indispensable.

Disk Masher : A great and easy to use disk archiver.

Secenery Gen: Unbelievable, scenery generator, like the £60 Vista program
              but FREE, and easier to use.

There are tons more, but you get the general idea! Admittedly most of the
above programs will be of little use to a complete beginner so don't worry
about what they are for now as I will be covering PD utilities in depth
in a future volume, by then you will understand why you will need them.

There are other forms of P.D such as:

Shareware
--------- 
This means that if you find the program useful you should send the
author a set fee. This usually means you will receive a newer version of
the program or an uncrippled version.

Licenceware
-----------
Licenceware is NOT P.D, in fact it is commercial software, fully 
copyrighted. The only difference to the normal £30 programs you see in 
Smith's is the packaging and the price. Most Licenceware sells from £3.99
upwards. It is illegal to sell/copy or give it away. Some Amiga magazines 
have not helped people to understand this by calling Licenceware, P.D.

                                  WORKBENCH
                                 -----------
Workbench is not your enemy, though at first it may seem to be, it's there
to help rather than hinder. Just try using Windows on a PC computer to see
what life without a DECENT Graphical User Interface (GUI) is like.

Workbench is basically a set of programs, some stored in @{" Rom, " link memory}
and most stored on disks (floppy or hard). The great part of this set up
is that to upgrade the system just mean getting a new floppy rather than a 
new chip. This also leads to a very flexible system that can be customized
to the users preference. Totally new programs can also be bolted on at 
will.

Workbench allows you to communicate with the inner workings of you Amiga
via mouse and keyboard, without Workbench, or a similar program, you
would need to be a programmer or use lots of separate programs that would
have to be run seperately to do simple things like copy files and format 
disks.

Personally I use a mixture of good @{" P.D " link pd} utilities and the Workbench 
together. Depending on your needs, you too will gradually find your own
suite of programs on and off the Workbench that suite you best. 

The whole point of these tutorials is to explain the workings of the 
Workbench, so it seems pointless to go rambling on here. 

Just take my word for it, Workbench is probably the friendliest and most
efficient GUI ever designed for a computer.
