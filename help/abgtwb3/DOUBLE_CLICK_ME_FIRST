Hello beginner,

If this disk wont run from your Workbench you may not have AmigaGuide
installed properly. It doesn't matter though because you are better off
booting from this disk because some pictures may come out corrupted if you 
run this disk from Workbench.

Follow these steps:
-------------------
* Turn off your Amiga

* Insert this disk into your internal drive

* Switch on your Amiga & the disk will load and run automatically.

* Carefully read the on-screen instructions.


If you have an Amiga A500 then you will not benefit from this tutorial at
all as it's aimed a Workbench 3 users.
There are tutorials for the A500 in the Public Domain, call a reputable 
P.D library like 17 Bit Software, 01924-366982 for help.

If you have WB2 most of the subjects covered will be Ok for you but there 
are differences!

              <<==HAVE YOU MADE A BACKUP COPY OF THIS DISK?==>>

If you haven't then do so now, if you do not know how to copy a disk then
load this disk as described above and read the COPY section, all will
be explained.
Good luck and let me know what you think of this guide, good and bad,
anything I have missed, improvements, what would would like to see covered in
future volumes etc...       

KEEP THIS DISK WRITE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES, If you don't know how to then
find out from the tutorial, where it is fully explained.

Good luck and let me know what you think of this guide.
