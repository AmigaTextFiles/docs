               CHANGES MADE TO THIS DISK SINCE ORIGINAL RELEASE
                           last update 16 Jan 1996




*Now hard drive installable:

                    INSTALLING ABGTWB3 VOL 1 TO HARD DRIVE

* Boot up your hard disk
* Insert ABGTWB3_VOL1 into DF0: (your internal drive)
* Double click on a hard drive partition to open it, i.e. "Work" or
  "WorkBench" or whatever you call your HD partitions.
* Click and hold left mouse button over the ABGTWB3_VOL1 disk icon
* Keeping the left mouse button held down drag the disk icon to the
  open hard drive window when in place release the left mouse button.
* The whole ABGTWB3_VOL1 disk will then be copied to your hard drive.
  it will be in its own drawer called "ABGTWB3_VOL1"


                                To Run from HD
* Open the hard drive partition that contains ABGTWB3_VOL1
* Double click on th e ABGTWB3_VOL1 drawer icon
* Double click on "INSTALL PPLIB" This makes sure you have the
  PowerPacker.Library on your Hard disk, you only need to do this once.
* Double click on "Menus.Guide"

* Do not change the name of any file, as it won't work properly.




                 Probs with earlier versions of this guide:

* Jon Dickinson reported he tried installing ABGTWB3 on his HD, it worked
  bar being able to view the diagrams, this was because it couldn't find the
  corect path for the pics.
  The other problem Jon had was when he decided to delete ABGTWB3 from his 
  HD and just use it from floppy, he found he couldn't delete "Menus.Guide" 
  all he got was a "File protected from deletion" error. 
  This was intentional on my part, I originally intended this guide to run 
  from floppy only and thought I was helping new users by protecting the 
  file from accidental deletion.
  After lots of moaning from users about ABGTWB3 not being HD installable I
  have relented, all new versions will be HD installable. 
  The protected file problem is caused by the protection flags set in the 
  file.

              Solution: How to unprotect the "Menus.Guide" file

* Boot your Hard drive
* When Workbench has loaded
* Move mouse to top of the Workbench screen
* Hold right mouse button down
* Keeping it held down move the pointer to the "Workbench" menu
* move the pointer to the "Execute Command..." item
* When it is selected release the mouse button.
* A requester will appear
* Click on the blank line and a tiny text cursor will appear
* Type the word "Protect" using the keyboard (without the quotes)
* Followed by a space & then the path of the menus.Guide file, 
  e.g. if you had dragged the disk to your "Work:" partition type in 

Protect Work:ABGTWB3/Menus.Guide

if you have it in your Workbench partition type in

Protect Workbench:ABGTWB3/Menus.Guide

* The last part of the line needs another space and then the  letters "rwed"
  this resets the protection bits to normal, examples:


Protect Work:ABGTWB3/Menus.Guide rwed

if you have it in your Workbench partition type in

Protect Workbench:ABGTWB3/Menus.Guide rwed

You are then free to delete the file if you want to.

To delete the file forever type in "Delete Work:ABGTWB3:/Menus.Guide" 
Change the "Work:" to suit.

------------------------------------------------------
In a nutshell:

1) Select "Execute Command..." from the "Workbench menu"

2) type in "Protect Work:ABGTWB3/Menus.Guide rwed"
   Change the path to suit.

3) Now type in Delete Work:ABGTWB3:/Menus.Guide" to delete the file.
   Change the path to suit.

Needless to say I won't be protecting files in the future! Thanks for
pointing that out. Obviously this new version isn't protected.
--------------------------------------------------------

Dave Barker found he couldn't print parts of the guide using the menu at the
top of the screen , this is now fixed, I forgot to assign Printers to the
Devs drawer.
Dave also couldn't find the PD utils on the disk, I admit to totally messing
up here. I barely mentioned how to access them at all. This is all now fixed
on this new version. 

When you boot this disk you will asked if you want to look at the utils
on the disk, if you answer "y" then a mini workbench is loaded, if you
answer "n" then the tutorial is loaded. It is all explained in detail in 
a new button called "About PD utils" at the bottom of the main menu.
--------------------------------------------------------

Mr Len Brown pointed out to me that I made little or no
mention that copying this disk using the Workbench Copy program will
leave a beginner pretty confused BECAUSE THE COPY WON'T WORK!

The reason the copy of this disk will not work is that Workbench puts
a "COPY_OF_" tag the disks name. When this disk is run files are look for on
a disk called "ABGTWB3_VOL1" and when it can only find
"COPY_OF_ABGTWB3_VOL1" it knocks out an error and refuses to run.

All you need to do is use a PD disk copier like SUPER DUPER COPIER which
negates this problem or alternatively use the "Rename" option to delete
the words "COPY_OF_" from the disk name, here we go again, step by step
time:

* See section on how to copy a disk

* After you have a copy of this disk, click once with the left mouse button
  on the disk icon to highlight it.

* Hold down the right mouse button and select "Rename" from the "Icons"menu
  found at the top of the Workbench screen.

* Use the cursor keys to move the cursor to the end of the "COPY_OF_"

* Now use the backspace key to delete these words.

* Be careful not to leave a space or it still won't work, do not add
  anything else.

* Click on OK and Bobs your uncle.

In case you are wondering the name of the disk is important to make it Hard
drive installable. You do come across some disks where the name does not
matter so don't get confused.

Thanks to Len for pointing that out.
