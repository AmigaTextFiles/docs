                       -------------------

ARexx - First Steps (ARFS) is a tutorial designed to help intending
and on-going users of ARexx. It concentrates on the basics, dealing
with about 130 topics, and including over 60 runnable examples. It is
arranged in a linear fashion for ease and clarity. Other sources of
help already exist, but they are generally packed with so much
material that they are daunting for beginners, and so full of links
that even the most hardened user of AmigaGuide documents can soon lose
his way and become bewildered.

While 'ARexx - First Steps' may be accessed using AmigaGuide, it was
designed for access via Gui4Cli and FastRead (both included).

  Gui4Cli is an interpretive programming language for the easy
  creation of GUIs. It provides Gadgets, Menus, Appitems etc, through
  an easy script-like language, allowing you to construct and visually
  edit in real time resizable font-sensitive GUIs and through them,
  control other programs by issuing CLI and ARexx commands.

The author of Gui4Cli has graciously consented to the inclusion of
Gui4Cli in the ARFS package.  We respond to his courtesy by affirming
that in our experience Gui4Cli is one of the best things that has ever
happened to the Amiga.

FastRead
--------
FastRead is a Gui4Cli application designed to ease access to
documentation.  It can be used, as in ARFS, to gain immediate access
to any patch of text, or as an online lookup tool linking gui buttons
to related text.  A complete FastRead archive is included in the
Gui4Cli distribution.

FastRead can be used to view existing AmigaGuide files, and from the
reader's point of view, a FastRead text presentation may bear a
superficial resemblance to AmigaGuide, but for authors of document-
ation it is much easier to use, and for designers of software it
provides a ready way of building detailed online documentation into a
gui-based program.
