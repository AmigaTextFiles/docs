                  GUI4CLI HELP SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

NOTE: The FastRead version included in the ARFS archive is not the
complete version, and has been slightly modified in order to work
independently of the Gui4Cli installation. The full FastRead version
is distributed with the Gui4Cli archive, which can be obtained from
Aminet in the dev/gui drawer.

INTRODUCTION
    FastRead.gc is a complete Gui4Cli help system, which can access
documentation either completely, in reader mode, or by fetching
selected patches of text for online help from within a Gui4Cli user's
own program.

    This gives the Gui4Cli user an easier and quicker way than
AmigaGuide to write documentation about his program, and the same
document can also be used for quick help from within the user's own
program, although FastRead.gc can also do these things with AmigaGuide
documents as well as its own, just as easily.

    FastRead.gc works in two modes. Firstly it is able to be used as a
document reader, and secondly as quick help from within a program,
fetching and displaying instructions on individual gadgets. It can do
this because it has a separate reader gui, ViewText.g, which displays
the text.  FastRead.gc handles the preprocessing of documents and
displays the index, so is not needed when only online help is
required.  ViewText.g handles this part.

REQUIREMENTS
    The Gui4Cli help system needs no special support libraries or
files, and only needs Gui4Cli installed on the system. The work is
done by two binary files, GetNodes and WriteNode, which are a part of
the Gui4Cli distribution.

THE GCHELP: ASSIGN
    For general convenience, the directory name GCHELP: is temporarily
assigned to whatever directory holds FastRead.gc or any of its
associated programs. The assignment is created by the FastRead.gc
suite of programs when any of them start up, and is removed again when
the programs end. The assign will have no effect on anything else you
do.

FASTREAD.GC
    This is the actual text reader. FastRead.gc opens two windows when
in Stand Alone mode, the main window with a lister, containing the
various topics and subtopics of the doc file, and the text window,
which displays the actual text of the topic or subtopic.

    On loading, FastRead.gc presents a file requester from which the
doc file to be read is chosen. After the file has been chosen, the
lister will display the topics and subtopics. A new document can be
loaded at any time via the 'Open' button.

    Clicking with the left mouse button on any topic or subtopic will
bring the text window to the front and display the text. A right mouse
button click brings the lister back to front, and clears the text
window, ready for another topic to be selected. To Quit FastRead.gc,
simply close either of the windows with their close gadget. 

    A simple lister search facility is included. This consists of a
string gadget at the top, with a button marked [»] next to it. This
can be useful for very large documents, or for AmigaGuides which
contain hundreds of nodes. By typing any character string into the
string gadget, the first index item which matches will move to the top
of the lister. The search is not case sensitive. For example, the
'Requirements' index item can be found in a long list by typing 'req,
REQ, or reQ' into the string gadget. Clicking on the button marked [»]
will move the next matching index item to the top of the lister.

    Pressing the HELP key whilst the FastRead.gc lister window is
active will load and display this text. Any document being read at the
time will be kept and not need to be reloaded.

    FastRead understands one icon tooltype - VTMACRO, which sets the
default AmigaDOS or ARexx script to run when the [Macro] button is
pressed in the ViewText window.

VIEWTEXT.G
    This is the text window part of FastRead.gc, but is a global file
which can be used by either FastRead.gc or the user's program, and is
used without FastRead.gc for online help. All calls concerning online
help are made from the users program. ViewText.g is initially loaded
from there, and displays the specific text patch requested. See the
section on HelpDemo.gc for more information.

    When the patch of text has been read, a click on the right mouse
button closes ViewText.g. The ViewText.g window has a button strip
along the top to the right, containing four buttons. These are
described as follows...

Macro - Opens a file requester and enables an AmigaDOS or ARexx script
        to be run. If the VTMACRO tooltype is set in FastRead's icon,
        this macro will run without opening the requester.

Prev - This goes to the previous subject in the FastRead.gc lister and
       displays it. When displaying online help, this button is
       ghosted.

Next - This goes to the next subject in the FastRead.gc lister and
       displays it. When displaying online help, this button is
       ghosted.

Grab - Saves the piece of text currently being displayed in the
       ViewText.g listview. A file requester will appear for the save
       path and filename. This function is also accessible by pressing
       CTRL-S.

Quit - This quits completely when used in stand alone mode, for
       reading complete documents. However, in online mode, the Quit
       button simply closes the Viewtext.g window. This function is
       also accessible by pressing CTRL-Q.
