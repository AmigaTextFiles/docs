05.13.39 #       <DNA> hello everyone
05.14.53 #       <DNA> hmm
05.14.55 #       <DNA> bye
09.54.26 #       <Dave_C> none of those sends worked!
09.54.26 #       <Dave_C> <sniff sniff>
09.54.26 #       <Dave_C> had to answer the phone
09.54.26 #       <Dave_C> (cndouble call)
09.56.57 #       <Dave_C> find siosbx
10.07.07 #       <StG^sNTx> ello Dave_C
10.08.09 #       <StG^sNTx> Is anything exciting happening here related to the MAE?
10.11.06 #       <StG^sNTx> bbl
11.00.08 #       <alfie> ola...darx not so rude :)...bbl
13.05.40 #       <ExiE> Merko!
13.05.43 #       <ExiE> Dave!
13.06.27 #       <Merko> ExiE :)
13.49.54 #       <hesido> hulo
13.50.13 #       <Gemini> Evening Merko , Jamesc and hesido 
13.50.31 #       <Merko> Gemini
13.50.45 #       <hesido> 'lo gemini
13.51.39 #       <Gemini> Merko: ur using ur ppc card 4 mp3s???
13.52.23 #       <hesido> <--- tryna find some pearl jam mp3... 
13.52.53 #       <Merko> Gemini: Not ATM, because mpega.library as well as amigaamp crashes when multitasking with other ppc apps.. every few hours or so.. :/
13.53.02 #       <Merko> Gemini: But usually I do.
13.53.05 #       <hesido> ppc is good at reatlrime mp3 decoding, as you might well know :)
13.54.20 #       <Gemini> Merko: do ur player use AHI?
13.54.25 #       <Gemini> hey koksa 
13.54.36 #       <alfie> ola Gem
13.54.40 #       <hesido> hey alfie :)
13.54.44 #       <Gemini> ahh.. its u alfie  :-)
13.54.48 #       <Merko> Gemini: Yes, but that's not the problem.
13.55.02 #       <Gemini> Merko: 4 me ahi seems 2 b the problem....
13.55.07 #       <hesido> merko, what is the problem, i might help indeed
13.55.11 #       <Merko> hesido: It sure is.. playing on the 060 sucks. Gotta fix this problem.
13.55.27 #       <Gemini> i have tryed 2 different ppc mp3 players..... and both have the same problem with ahi
13.55.54 #       <hesido> merko: lemme guess : ppc decodind don't work for you and you have to stick with 68k routines?
13.55.55 #       <Merko> hesido: Well, when I run mpega.library PPC version, or amigaamp.elf, the computer crashes instantly if I start ADoom or QuakePPC. Not with the 68k version of mpega.library.
13.56.13 #       <hesido> ok, I got ya
13.56.16 #       <Gemini> the thing is that its playing so darn low..... gota turn the sound almost up 2 max in order 2 get the same sound i would get with mpega
13.56.41 #       <Merko> If I run only mpega.library and rc5, it crashes maybe after half an hour.. or two hours.. but sooner or later it crashes.
13.56.58 #       <hesido> merko: do those problematic exe's also  use ahi??
13.57.01 #       <Merko> mpega.libraryPPC that is, mpega.library060 is completely stable.
13.57.16 #       <Merko> hesido: Yes, but so does mpega.library060 in exactly the same way.
13.57.43 #       <hesido> merko: could that be a 'heating problem with ram's??
13.57.49 #       <Merko> And dozens of other programs... which all work fine. AHI is not a problem here at least, it always worked perfectly.. except for old versions of the prefs prog which crashed.
13.57.50 #       <hesido> in the ppc mode?
13.58.28 #       <ExiE> Hi!
13.58.33 #       <Gemini> hey ExiE 
13.58.36 #       <Merko> hesido: I thought of that too... but it isn't. I've tried running ADoom+RC5 for days, it works fine. Quake works fine too, although it has crashed for other reasons too.. I guess it still had bugs then. ;D
13.59.04 #       <hesido> merko: you got snoopdos?
13.59.06 #       <Merko> Also I have a very nice fan on the 060.. and the PPC is already quite cool.
13.59.14 #       <Merko> hesido: Yes, there's no such problem.
13.59.26 #       <Gemini> i have never tryed running both a mp3 player that uses ppc, and another ppc utilety...
13.59.31 #       <hesido> well, gimme a sec..
13.59.43 #       <hesido> use snoopdos in the single step mode.
13.59.45 #       <ExiE> CZECH AMIGA NEWS
13.59.47 #       <Merko> Gemini: Try it.. ADoom or Quake crashes instantly here.
14.00.03 #       <hesido> you might also well track for rom calls, etc.
14.00.08 #       <Merko> hesido: Why? It finds all files.. there's no such problem. It works fine for hours..
14.00.12 #       <ExiE> exclusive screenshots form Quake like game called ENFORCE :)
14.00.19 #       <hesido> (but don't over track, as in single step it takes loong time)
14.00.31 #       <Gemini> Merko: but do u know the solution 2 my low volume problem?
14.00.47 #       <Merko> hesido: It doesn't help me.. like I said, it can run fine for hours, then crash for no reason at all. Or hang rather.
14.00.56 #       <Gemini> the volume is just fine with other things that uses ahi like quake and genetic
14.00.56 #       <Merko> Gemini: In AHI?
14.01.02 #       <hesido> merko: the point i am gonna make is, i once found an enforcer hitting library using single step..
14.01.25 #       <Merko> hesido: Ah.. I see.. but enforcer is not much use for a ppc replayer, is it? ;D
14.01.42 #       <Merko> hesido: I think it's some strange cache problem or something.. because it works well for hours..
14.01.44 #       <hesido> merko: i was talking bout immidiate crashes after executing adoom (or were they not immediate crashes??)
14.02.00 #       <Merko> hesido: Yes, when running ADoom AND mpega.libraryPPC.
14.02.07 #       <Gemini> Merko: yeah.... dont know if its ahi thats the problem... but it happens with both the mp3 players i have used that uses ahi
14.02.24 #       <Merko> Gemini: Hmm.. what if you use volume boost?
14.02.39 #       <Gemini> Merko: hang on
14.03.06 #       <Gemini> i cant change the boost... its ghosted
14.03.22 #       <hesido> merko: again a single step adventure of mine :) I found that genetic sp demo was freezing as it loaded file save ahi audio mode for no reason! then I had to delete filesave mode, which is a shame :/  now it loads the correct mode :)
14.03.30 #       <Gemini> wich means +0 DB
14.04.12 #       <Merko> Gemini: Right.. but what about setting it in Songplayer?
14.04.26 #       <hesido> song player also crashes here a lot, a lot. and a lot.
14.04.28 #       <Gemini> theres no boost settings there
14.04.36 #       <hesido> 1.3 , we're talking bout?
14.04.45 #       <Merko> Gemini: It's only available in some modes anyway.. but in Songplayer you have to set it internally. Yes it is, you'll have to activate it first though in prefs..
14.05.02 #       <Gemini> im using amigaAMP
14.05.35 #       <Merko> hesido: Well, I don't care if I can't play mp3 and play ADoom, but maybe it's the same problem as mpega.libraryPPC+RC5PPC, I don't know.
14.05.52 #       <hesido> merko: i suspect that too..
14.06.08 #       <Merko> Gemini: I don't remember how to do it there.. probably from AHIPrefs by selecting a mode that handles it..
14.06.16 #       <hesido> for songplayers :
14.07.00 #       <Gemini> i have tryed all the paula modes... and its ghosted on all of them
14.07.28 #       <Merko> Gemini: Hmm, I tried to.. indeed they are. Well, it is possible in Songplayer. But I don't see why it should be needed in the first place.. strange.
14.07.30 #       <hesido> I created karaokes for cranberries linger, will smith getting jiggy, sting mad about you, jamiraquai virtl. insanity, chilly peppers my friends..
14.07.36 #       <Merko> Gemini: Do you have a recent AHI version?
14.08.18 #       <Gemini> Merko: yes.. i DLed it a week ago frome the autors HP
14.08.28 #       <hesido> and songplayers can enjoy karaoke, yep..
14.09.04 #       <Merko> hesido: Yeah.. I hope the "todo"s get done on that area though. :))
14.09.21 #       <Merko> Gemini: Very strange. Is it quiet in all modes?
14.09.22 #       <Gemini> songplayer... its another mp3 player.. and it supports PPC?
14.09.38 #       <Merko> Gemini: Yes, it uses the ppc version of mpega.library
14.10.00 #       <Gemini> Merko: its not quiet.. but i have 2 turn the volume of my speakers almost up 2 max just 2 get an ordenery volume..
14.10.03 #       <hesido> merko: it could indeed be enhanced, but they shouldn't make it complex..
14.10.25 #       <Gemini> better get it then :-)
14.10.31 #       <Merko> darx find mpega.library
14.10.43 #       <Gemini> i already have the mpega.library
14.10.46 #       <Gemini> the ppc version
14.10.53 #       <Merko> Gemini: Ok. :)
14.11.16 #       <hesido> heh, you can get turkish catalog of 1.3 from my address :)
14.11.23 #       <Gemini> actualy i DLed and installed it yesterday :-)
14.11.45 #       <Gemini> i realy dont think i need turkish catalog :-)
14.11.53 #       <Gemini> turkish is greek 2 me :-)))
14.12.01 #       <Merko> lol =D
14.12.25 #       <Merko> Actually I have a turkish and a greek mp3, and I can tell which is which. ;D
14.12.34 #       <Gemini> lol
14.12.52 #       <hesido> well greek is a whole lot different language, afaik :)
14.12.52 #       <Merko> Of course noone told me that they are greek/turkish, so I might be wrong. ;D
14.12.55 #       <Gemini> but what do u use as maxfreq?
14.13.26 #       <Gemini> mine is set by default as 22050
14.14.00 #       <hesido> gemini: forget maxfreq's just divide freqs (in songplayer, of course)
14.14.18 #       <Merko> Gemini: I normally use 48000 or something.. but right now I've turned off the hack.. only works on cgx/p96 or with a VGA screenmode though.
14.14.39 #       <Merko> hesido: Nah, not with PPC.. then you can run in best quality. :)
14.15.03 #       <Gemini> jupp
14.15.16 #       <hesido> :) then divide with 1 ('bir' as in turkish.)
14.15.28 #       <Jamesc> bbl
14.15.49 #       <Merko> Nah.. then you'll get the dreaded "division by one" error.
14.16.07 #       <hesido> <--- has to predecode mp3's to listen to mp3's while doing something , or listening to songs in stereo mode. 
14.16.34 #       <Gemini> Merko: hmm.... back 2 ahi.... i have set all the units (music, unit0 etc) is there any need 4 this?
14.16.52 #       <hesido> merko: yoo get divide by zero error when dividing by 1?? I auspect your ppc card is faulty :)
14.17.43 #       <hesido> gemini: for amigaamp yes and unit 0 should be set, for the wonderful amplifier, you can set the unit in conf
14.17.55 #       <hesido> auspect = suspect
14.17.58 #       <hesido> :)
14.18.01 #       <Gemini> speaking of faulty ppc cards... im wondering if mine is.. i got a 32MB SIMM in it.. but it only comes up with 16 MB fast....
14.18.07 #       <Merko> hesido: Nonono.. "division by one".. almost as bad as division by zero. ;D
14.18.28 #       <hesido> merko: then it is  a real smart ppc card, you have :)
14.18.38 #       <StG^sNTx> ello folks:)
14.19.01 #       <hesido> gemini: that IS bad.
14.19.06 #       <Gemini> and when i tryed moving the SIMM 2 the other memory slot, the machine started, and i got the early startup screen.. but when i pressed boot/boot with no s-s the screen went black, the HDsaccessed a little, and the nnothing
14.19.09 #       <Gemini> hey StG^sNTx 
14.19.52 #       <Gemini> hesido: i spoke with the guy i got the card frome, but i had 2 check out a coupple of things, gonna call him back 2 morrow
14.20.23 #       <StG^sNTx> will anything MAE-related be happening at this #, or is there a special-# for that?
14.20.38 #       <Merko> Gemini: Hmm, it might be one of those 4-something refresh simms..
14.20.54 #       <Merko> Gemini: Do you have a CVPPC or a BPPC?
14.21.04 #       <Merko> CSPPC or BPPC I mean.
14.21.16 #       <Gemini> it Blizzard
14.21.35 #       <hesido> merko: if you got productivity modes you can divide by one, if not, you gotta stick with divide by two, without having to worry about khz's.
14.21.52 #       <Gemini> the guy i got the card and the simm frome saied he had ordered this simm 4 my ppc card..
14.22.12 #       <Merko> hesido: Yes, it probably won't sound better to divide with 1.5 or something anyway.
14.22.20 #       <StG^sNTx> brb
14.22.26 #       <hesido> and if you're using ahi, be sure to set the frequency the same as the output mp3's.
14.22.40 #       <Merko> Gemini: Well.. blizzards are quite picky about the simms..
14.23.01 #       <hesido> merko: I take that seriously, you are right.
14.23.05 #       <Gemini> Merko: not according 2 the manual :-)
14.23.17 #       <Gemini> let me check what it saies
14.23.59 #       <Merko> Gemini: Heh.. don't trust the manual too much.. it seems lots of blizzard owners have some kind of simm problems anyway. :(
14.24.09 #       <Gemini> it can use 32-bit type or 36 bit type
14.24.27 #       <Gemini> 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 MBs
14.24.38 #       <hesido> treble sounds sound better at 22khz then 28khz, with 16 bit 44khz sampled sounds.. believe me :)
14.24.48 #       <Merko> Yes.. but there are also some with a shorter refreshtime.. and several people have reported that only half of the memory shows up with these simms.
14.24.49 #       <Gemini> must b 70 Ns speed grade or faster
14.24.54 #       <Gemini> mine is 60ns
14.25.11 #       <Gemini> ahh... that does sound like my problem :-)
14.25.21 #       <Gemini> ill mention it 2 the guy when i talk 2 him :-)
14.25.40 #       <Merko> Btw, that might not be "refreshtime".. some kind of "time" however, and not the usual 60ns/70ns thing.. it's either 4 or 8 I think.. or maybe 2 vs 4.. sorry I don't quite remember.
14.26.58 #       <hesido> 60ns are so very widely used.. that should not be a problem.
14.27.08 #       <hesido> 70ns is slower ofcourse :)
14.27.33 #       <Merko> Gemini: Anyway.. see if you can swap it with some pc owner, it doesn't mean the simm is faulty, just that it's not friends with the blizzard.
14.27.48 #       <Gemini> hmm... ill mention it 2 him .... but he did say he ordered this simm in particular in order 2 avoid any problems, and it wouldent explain why it dossent work in the other simm-slot
14.28.32 #       <hesido> gemini: there might be a jumper for 60ns ram's, I have that in my blizzard 030/50 board..
14.28.40 #       <Gemini> all the ppl i know that lives around here that got pcs havent realy got a clue, and i doubt they will open their pcs :-)
14.28.55 #       <Merko> Gemini: That's true of course. Hmm, are you sure the manual says you can add them in either slot?
14.28.56 #       <Gemini> hesido: dident mention any jumpers in the manual
14.29.14 #       <Gemini> let my quote :-)
14.29.15 #       <Merko> There's no jumpers, it's software controlled.
14.29.51 #       <hesido> merko : cool
14.29.55 #       <Gemini> "ADVICE If you use only one SIMM, it can be installed in any of the two SIMM sockets"
14.30.02 #       <Merko> Hehe.. I got this feeling when I installed the CSPPC/CVPPC, "are ordinary people really supposed to do this?". =D
14.30.29 #       <Merko> Gemini: Quite clear then. :)
14.30.33 #       <Gemini> Merko: not 2 mention the fact that the softwarethat came with it suxxs... no installs
14.31.00 #       <hesido> I even was real afraid to fit my 030/50 below my miggy, some one else had to 'scratch' it into my miggy
14.31.10 #       <Merko> Gemini: I didn't have a problem with my installs.. but then, I had to update anyway of course since the version on the disks was old already..
14.31.40 #       <Merko> Gemini: But I was thinking more about the hardware installation, it's not very easy to fit that thing in an A400 desktop.
14.31.49 #       <Merko> A4000 even. =D
14.31.51 #       <Gemini> ahh... the only thing that came with a real install script was the disk.... the CD was a total mess :-(
14.32.13 #       <Merko> Gemini: Yeah.. but you weren't supposed to install off the CD anyway.
14.32.41 #       <hesido> you ppl got powerfull amiga's. i don't.
14.32.45 #       <Gemini> could have been better layed out on the cd.... 
14.32.51 #       <hesido> <--bursts into tears
14.33.07 #       <Gemini> why r alot of files in lha/lzx??? theres plent of room on the cd
14.33.35 #       <Merko> hesido: Bah.. power is overestimated.. I probably did more with my Amiga back when I had A1200/020. :(
14.33.53 #       <Merko> Of course I had much more time back then, too. But anyway.
14.34.13 #       <Gemini> ohh... and the software that came on the disk were only 4 installing scsi -tools... and my card dossent have scsi
14.34.50 #       <hesido> merko: well it is not me talkin bout realtime mp3decoding :( :)
14.36.24 #       <Gemini> Merko: but u mentioned that there were no jumpers, and it had 2 b done by software..... how is it done?
14.36.33 #       <Merko> hesido: No, but the problem with realtime mp3 decoding is that you'll just listen to music and don't do any useful stuff. 8/
14.36.35 #       <hesido> where's drjekyl??
14.37.05 #       <hesido> merko: I personally like to do things when listening to music.
14.37.33 #       <hesido> hmm, thanks. he should be on vacation or something.
14.38.01 #       <StG^sNTx> k
14.38.01 #       <StG^sNTx> brb
14.38.48 #       <Merko> hesido: Well, me too, but I have found out I do things in a less efficient way.. and anyway, radio or CD *is* better anyway. ;)
14.39.27 #       <hesido> merko: I guess you are right. but what I said, I have my karaoke :)
14.39.59 #       <Gemini> hey Zen^^

14.53.04 #       <StG^sNTx> :)
14.53.13 #       <hesido> scions of a forgotten world could have been one hell of a game :(
14.53.33 #       <StG^sNTx> but?
14.53.46 #       <hesido> but it is cancelled
14.54.01 #       <hesido> did you have the chance to play the early demo of it?
14.54.09 #       <hesido> it was cool. 
14.54.32 #       <Seed> I forgot to check the demo of Samba Football. anyone seen it?
14.54.40 #       <StG^sNTx> I'm having trouble keeping up with all of these cancellations... a recent one?
14.54.41 #       <hesido> not me
14.54.54 #       <StG^sNTx> Seed: not me
14.55.00 #       <hesido> this was 1-2 weeks ago
14.55.23 #       <StG^sNTx> hmm... who were releasing it?
14.57.38 #       <hesido> hmm, lemme think..                 the full name was almagica- scions of a forgotten world             couldn;t remember! (each space char is a second of thinking) :)
14.58.20 #       <StG^sNTx> it's a vulcan release if I don't remember all wrong..
14.58.29 #       <Merko> I 'know' the authors a little.
14.58.45 #       <hesido> I am searching hd for the files
14.58.59 #       <Merko> On IRC mostly, but I've met some of them a couple of times.
14.59.13 #       <Merko> It's quite dead, they just lost motivation a long time ago. :(
15.01.03 #       <hesido> I found an html , they had been searching for a programmer (and it was well after the early demo release.)
15.01.19 #       <hesido> "We, the creators of Almagica are looking for new programmers to join the project. "
15.01.22 #       <hesido> :(
15.01.39 #       <hesido> well i guess they are no longer looking for that
15.01.45 #       <Merko> Oh yes.. well.. if some very motivated programmers join the project, there may be a chance. Or someone could take it over..but..
15.01.55 #       <StG^sNTx> k.. I see now I knew it was cancelled.. Have a release schedule on my hp, and found scions ... with a tba rel-date, but then i founf almacica cancelled, so it's a double entry from me
15.02.12 #       <Merko> hesido: I don't know.. not actively at least. But who knows, if someone turns up..
15.02.50 #       <_ego> Wow, people!
15.03.11 #       <hesido> merko: not to forget, this announcment was made very long ago before the cancellation, maybe the cancellation isn't about programming. I recall sth like "amiga market not being active enuff" etc..
15.03.13 #       <StG^sNTx> ello _ego
15.03.17 #       <hesido> hello _ego,
15.03.44 #       <_ego> Hi :)
15.04.04 #       <Seed> hi ego
15.04.16 #       <Seed> I need to go. See you all later
15.04.26 #       <StG^sNTx> cu Seed
15.04.35 #       <Merko> hesido: Well, the problem was that the programmer lost interest, and then I guess the others lost interest too gradually as well.
15.04.44 #       <hesido> yez seed
15.04.48 #       <hesido> byez :)
15.05.01 #       <Merko> hesido: I don't think money was ever something they expected.. so it's not really the reason.
15.05.29 #       <hesido> merko: well, if you played the demo, I think you also noticed the potential in it to be a killer game.
15.05.43 #       <Merko> hesido: Yeah.
15.06.14 #       <Merko> hesido: There was a lot to be done though. And I hope Napalm will be as good as Scions would have been if it had been finished. :)
15.06.15 #       <_ego> What game is this?
15.06.48 #       <hesido> merko: we all hope :)
15.07.04 #       <hesido> ego, a realtime war strategy game like warcraft
15.07.20 #       <_ego> Ah, Scions. I was expecting that to be canceled
15.07.34 #       <hesido> (i couldn't check napalm, it needs 16 mb, i will buy that mem shortly!)
15.07.56 #       <Merko> _ego: Why?
15.08.26 #       <Merko> hesido: Well, the demo of Napalm was buggy, but once you got it to run it was interesting.. some things need to be fixed, but I guess they are working on it.
15.08.33 #       <_ego> Merko: Because it was one of the ones that Vulcan listed as uncertain some months back when they began to pull out of the Amiga games scene
15.08.57 #       <hesido> vulcan lately cancelled hard target too.
15.09.01 #       * _ego hasn't managed to get the Napalm demo to run yet
15.09.17 #       <Merko> _ego: Ah.. well, I've "known" it was going to be cancelled for half a year at least, but it's nothing to do with Vulcan really.
15.09.48 #       <hesido> I wonder what they are doing with dosens of unused cool source codes, unused cool gfx for those potentially cool unreleased games..
15.10.06 #       <Merko> I don't think it's Vulcan who are cancelling any of these games. It's just that they like to tell everyone when someone sends in a game that is 5% finished.. and of course most such projects WILL be cancelled. :(
15.10.11 #       <_ego> Merko: No, but when Vulcan initially announced they were pulling out they listed several games as uncertain.  Scions was one of them
15.10.46 #       <hesido> merko and ego are both correct, all affect eachother..
15.10.53 #       <_ego> Probably nothing with the source code
15.11.10 #       <Merko> _ego: Yes.. but you know, Vulcan don't really have anything to do with development of these titles.. they will just sell them when/if they are finished, and they are doing a bit of PR in the meanwhile.
15.11.16 #       <_ego> Graphics can be re-used though
15.11.50 #       <hesido> some c code could be reused, why not? like ai routines, level editors and stuff
15.12.13 #       <Merko> _ego: Sure, if someone gets them.. which I don't think happens, I mean, people don't want to send away their gfx, and others don't want to use other gfx, they want their own.
15.12.23 #       <_ego> Merko: True, but if Vulcan say it probably won't come out, I figure they know what they're talking about
15.12.43 #       <hesido> I hope they get lambda out. i'll rush to buy it if still plays fluently on 030/50 as it did in the demos.. even 3/4 fluent would be enough for me :)
15.12.58 #       <Merko> _ego: Of course.. that usually means they got a mail from the developers saying "There's no way in hell we're going to finish that game!" ;)
15.13.05 #       <StG^sNTx> lambda will come out
15.13.32 #       <hesido> stg: i think so, it is looking stronger everyday
15.13.45 #       <Merko> hesido: Currently it's slow, according to the author.. of course it's much much cooler also..
15.13.58 #       <_ego> Basically all the games done for the Amiga these days are done as a hobby. So you have to figure that most games will not be completed.  Its just too much work for very little return
15.14.06 #       <hesido> merko : time for me to turn of space clouds :)
15.14.11 #       <hesido> ..turn off..
15.14.22 #       <Merko> I hope Lambda will come out.. and I think it might well happen. The coder is very good.. and the other people involved are also very good. :)
15.14.39 #       <hesido> lambda is good :)
15.15.05 #       <Merko> Probably. :)
15.15.22 #       <_ego> A game like Lambda is going to be slow on anything less than an 060 even with lots of optimisation I think
15.16.00 #       <Merko> _ego: Lambda is going to be *very* optimised, perhaps more than any other game..
15.16.07 #       <hesido> ego: we were doing a top-down racing game. I was the gfx man. I lost contact with the programmer (whom I never saw, but still he was a friend) months ago :(
15.16.09 #       <StG^sNTx> it's a project aiming not to sell, but to prove it can be done on the miggy. Had a talk with one of the guys in the team not that long ago, and he said eactly that. Also said there's no chance of them converting to PC or anyhitng. 
15.16.29 #       <hesido> stg: hehe
15.16.45 #       <hesido> the next version of lambda will lwet us play a mission.
15.16.53 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Hmm, you talked to Illuvatar I guess?
15.17.01 #       <StG^sNTx> hesido: same here.. topdown, me doing gfx, but the coder dissapeared
15.17.05 #       <hesido> I also think that 040/25 would be sfficient to plat lambda well.
15.17.41 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: yes
15.17.44 #       <_ego> hesido: Yeah tht seems to happen a fair bit.  I believe the people doing Bloodline are having the same sort of problems
15.17.57 #       <hesido> stg: only if you were the programmer, I would almost think that he is you :)
15.18.10 #       <_ego> hesido: Not without turning most of the cool stuff off I think :)
15.18.29 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Okay. If you talked to the coder you wouldn't be so sure, every other day he wants to cancel the project and buy a PC, every other day he is coding like crazy. 8D
15.18.52 #       <hesido> ego: i'll let you know what happens with a 030/50 :)
15.19.07 #       <_ego> hesido: Its already FPU only isn't it?
15.19.13 #       <hesido> ego: or should I say, what doesn't happen with a 030/50 :)
15.19.17 #       <Merko> _ego: Yes it is.
15.19.18 #       <hesido> yupp
15.19.31 #       <hesido> my fpu is outside the chip :)
15.19.38 #       <hesido> it is slow :/
15.19.40 #       <StG^sNTx> hehe:) nope.. I did gfx in lw and he coded the stuff in blitz. I'm getting quite a few 3D-buildings now that look just as good close up (lightsources and stuff) as from top view. Plan to make awhole city just for fun
15.19.45 #       <Merko> It probably won't run well on 030+fpu. If it'll even run..
15.19.50 #       <_ego> Merko: Thats coders for you.  They always want to do more and a 68030 is very limiting for them these days
15.20.05 #       <_ego> Merko: Well really low res, no clouds or details perhaps
15.20.06 #       <Merko> _ego: I'm a coder too. ;D
15.20.22 #       <hesido> stg: maybe it is the same programmer :) deceiving gfxer's to do gfx for a vapor then leave the area :))
15.20.37 #       <_ego> Merko: I only program apps not games, so processor speed doesn't really bother me :)
15.20.55 #       <StG^sNTx> hesido: hehe:) this was a norwegian guy...
15.21.02 #       <hesido> merko: it will. the author himself has got a 030/50 blizzard :)
15.21.14 #       <Merko> _ego: Well, he is coding FPU usage into the whole engine to get better speed.. he had some real problems with accuracy when using integers only, and for best speed he decided it was necessary to design the whole engine around fpu usage.
15.21.14 #       <hesido> stg: argh, mine was from new zeeland :)
15.21.41 #       <StG^sNTx> hesido: that's it for your theory then:)
15.21.47 #       <Merko> hesido: Sure, but someone lent him an 060 board. :)
15.21.48 #       <hesido> lol
15.22.10 #       <Merko> Was any of them called Blitmanic or something?
15.22.13 #       <hesido> merko: yeah i know. :( :)
15.22.25 #       <_ego> Merko: Its a reasonable enough design decision. All the chips that would play that sort of game at a reasonable speed have the FPU built in anyway
15.22.39 #       <hesido> ego: you are right.
15.22.47 #       <_ego> Doesn't Blitmaniac come on here sometimes?
15.23.11 #       <hesido> gotta go ppl. see you all later (stg next time we meet we'll talk about gfx, k? :)
15.23.22 #       <_ego> See ya
15.23.41 #       <_ego> I would love to have an 040 or  060, but my budget doesn't really allow for it
15.23.51 #       <_ego> At the moment all my Amiga purchases are software
15.24.18 #       * StG^sNTx throws the answer "yes" after hesido
15.24.56 #       * _ego catches it and throws it back
15.25.08 #       <_ego> No littering in this channel thankyou. ;)
15.25.40 #       <StG^sNTx> :)
15.28.31 #       <StG^sNTx> silence...
15.29.23 #       <_ego> Damn, massive lag
15.29.33 #       <_ego> My ISP's backbone is badly clogged tonight
15.29.58 #       <StG^sNTx> k
15.30.09 #       <_ego> Time I was going.  See you around folks :)
15.30.28 #       <StG^sNTx> well.. think I'm outa here.. stay cool Merko:)
16.57.32 #       <alanwall> agima: hi
16.57.39 #       <Agima> 'lo alanwall
16.57.51 #       <alanwall> hows the university going?
16.58.05 #       <Agima> University? Universe? Well, it's cool. :)
16.58.15 #       <Agima> I finally got the list calmed down, dammit. :)
16.58.52 #       <alanwall> I call it a university cause its closer to that-learning u know :)
16.59.16 #       <alanwall> yeah it wa getting little usenettish
16.59.42 #       <Agima> I won't allow it to become a newsgroup via Majordomo. Heck no
17.00.19 #       <alanwall> we have the same problem on TA ml but Gary lets it runn it course
17.01.47 #       <alanwall> now that I have 2.1 how about trying to send a file to me again-hope it works this time-even a small text file will do Thanks!
17.01.48 #       <Agima> Yeah, but there's more people on TAML. We try to be a tad closer knit on AUML. Arguing helps none.
17.02.32 #       <alanwall> this is true and now that Petro is there don't want to scare him off
17.03.08 #       <Agima> Damn right we don't. :)
17.03.17 #       <Agima> Abort?
17.03.31 #       <alanwall> damn still not working :(
17.03.45 #       <Agima> What's wrong with it?
17.04.11 #       <alanwall> just sits there and says can not connect
17.04.43 #       <Agima> Bahhh. Is it an AmIRC bug or something wrong at your end (or maybe even here, I dunno :?
17.04.45 #       <alanwall> I can send just not receive
17.05.34 #       <alanwall> no with me had the same problem with 2.0 after I added a rexx script
17.05.50 #       <Agima> I'll have to go I'm afraid. I'll be back tomorrow, probably about the same time. :)
17.06.01 #       <alanwall> removed it upped to 2.1 but still there
17.54.28 #       <Suz> Thank christ! :)
23.12.31 #       <heart> hmmm  deop'ed  thats weird
23.14.01 #       <heart> bbl
