15.48.15 #       <rad> by all
15.48.16 #       <ninline> hiya rad
15.48.22 #       <ninline> bye rad  :)
15.48.40 #       <rad> wow , somebody is alive :-)
15.48.50 #       <ninline> well..sort of  :)
15.48.56 #       <ninline> what's up?
15.50.20 #       <ninline> rad?
15.50.24 #       <ninline> you alive :)
15.50.38 #       <Seed> hi rad
15.50.49 #       <ninline> rad wont talk to me  :(
15.51.29 #       <rad> i have just read about OS 3.5 , i hoped that it would be done on Cologne (sorry for my english - please correct me in order to learn it)
15.52.07 #       <rad> ninline: are u now :-) ?
15.52.18 #       <rad> hi seed
15.52.43 #       <Seed> rad: where in Poland are you?
15.53.15 #       <rad> seed:i 'm from Wroclaw 
15.53.26 #       <ninline> OS 3.5 is going to be a CD release  :)   Amiga INC. is wising up!
15.53.32 #       <Seed> Many Amigas there
15.54.18 #       <rad> seed: in Poland whether in Wroclaw?
15.54.40 #       <ninline> both
15.55.43 #       <Seed> Poland has many Amigans.. compared to the number here
15.55.56 #       <ninline> cool
15.56.16 #       <ninline> seed: where are you?
15.56.38 #       <rad> in Poland we have two polish mags. about Amiga : Amiga Compuer Studio (52 p. full color) and Amiga Magazyn (84p. , 10p.in color)
15.57.23 #       <rad> seed:here ? where i'm now (in cyberspace)?
15.57.45 #       <ninline> rad: You all are pretty lucky...we've got Amazing Amiga as the only color mag left here and Amiga Informer and both are smaller than those two.
15.58.44 #       <Seed> I'm in Israel
15.59.19 #       <ninline> seed: okay, cool.  You all have many amigas there?
16.00.05 #       <Seed> a few hundreds left.. maybe less
16.00.42 #       <ninline> hmmm....such a shame...Amiga INC better hurry up or they wont have enough user base left to resurrect.
16.01.03 #       <rad> and in Magazyn Amiga is included a CD every two month , in ACS every month
16.01.43 #       <ninline> rad: that's pretty good...I used to get disks with CU amiga but the US mags don't have cover disks.
16.02.12 #       <Seed> Amiga Format still has them. but it's expensive in the States
16.02.16 #       <ninline> have you all seen the new REBOL programming language?
16.02.43 #       <Seed> It's pretty interesting. hope enough use it creatively
16.03.04 #       <ninline> seed:the expense isn't the problem.  Amiga Format is almost impossible to find in the US.
16.03.23 #       <Seed> Yes, I'm aware of this
16.03.48 #       <Merko> I'm going to subscribe to Format now, but unfortunately their subscriptions page doesn't work with IBrowse. :(
16.03.58 #       <Seed> unless you subscribe and pay with your hard-earned cash. and a lot :)
16.04.14 #       <rad> yes , but when i see( P)ersonal (C)alculator mags. with CD and full colour and 200 p. i'm  going to be mad
16.04.57 #       <ninline> I guess I'll get a subscription to Amiga Format...It is a lot to pay but it's the biggest mag left.
16.05.13 #       <Seed> PC rags aren't worth the money they cost
16.05.37 #       <Seed> and anyway, which PC mag can claim to review all available software? :)
16.05.41 #       <rad> one of the best was Amiga User International 
16.05.46 #       <ninline> rad: PEECEE rags are mostly just press releases, advertisements and some lame articles.  Useless basically.
16.06.43 #       <ninline> I used to love reading CU AMiga....my bookstore only got 5 copies a month and if you weren't on the waiting list you wouldn't get one. 
16.07.03 #       <Seed> I still have some CUA issues
16.07.27 #       <ninline> I've got almost every CU amiga issue going back to early 95.
16.07.51 #       <rad> I also have about 50 issues of Amiga User Int.
16.07.54 #       <Merko> I've subscribed to CU since '92..
16.08.24 #       <Merko> The price here is about 50% when subscribing compared to buying single issues, so..
16.08.49 #       <Merko> And you usually get it a couple of weeks earlier too. :)
16.09.54 #       <Seed> I didn't receive the October Amiga Format issue. Time to send an angry Fax again, I'm afraid :)
16.10.00 #       <rad> ALL: what about yours Amiga configs , can you tell sth ?
16.11.19 #       <Merko> Seed: I only got it this friday.. so I guess it's in the mail. :)
16.11.34 #       <Seed> Merko: hmmm
16.11.39 #       <Merko> rad: sth?
16.11.39 #       <ninline> what is the URL for amiga format?
16.11.54 #       <Seed> Merko: Yes, it should have been here Sep 29
16.12.01 #       <Seed> they have a crappy page
16.12.02 #       <rad> merko: sth = something
16.12.05 #       <Seed> Nothing to see there
16.12.41 #       <ninline> seed: I just wanted to see what it is going to cost me to subscribe.
16.13.10 #       * rad is going to bed in several minutes
16.13.28 #       <Merko> rad: Wow.. I usually sleep for hours even. ;D
16.14.05 #       <Merko> ninline: Well, what browser are you running?
16.14.18 #       <ninline> amirc at the moment
16.14.26 #       <Seed> ninline: It will cost you as much as it cost me.. about 104 British Pounds
16.14.28 #       <Merko> ninline: Anyway, try www.futurepublishing.co.uk
16.15.00 #       <Merko> ninline: Ok, that's why I versioned you, but what browser?
16.15.00 #       <ninline> 104 pounds...hmmm...that's close to 200 dollars.  jeez!
16.15.10 #       <Seed> Yes, geez
16.15.16 #       <ninline> voyager and Aweb
16.15.39 #       <ninline> seed: I guess that's what I'm getting for christmas.  :)
16.15.44 #       <Merko> ninline: Good.. tell me if either of them works at the subscription page.
16.15.55 #       <ninline> merko...okay..hang on
16.16.34 #       <Seed> ohh.. looked at it now.. it's only 82.50 Pounds now
16.16.41 #       <Seed> for the CD version
16.17.10 #       <rad> bye bye merko , ninline , seed , and all ; visit me on #amisia ( poznan.irc.pl ) see you
16.17.14 #       <ninline> seed: that should ONLY run me about 160.  :)
16.17.23 #       <ninline> see you around rad
16.17.29 #       <Seed> bye rad
16.18.18 #       <Merko> eeh..
16.18.55 #       <Merko> Aaargh!
16.19.13 #       <ninline> hehe...that's about 140 to 150 us dollars.
16.19.40 #       <ninline> i was pretty close eh?
16.19.57 #       <Merko> ninline: Yup.. but I thought it would be about 1000 SEK. :/
16.20.25 #       <Seed> :)
16.20.56 #       <Merko> Fecking expensive pound nowadays.. why aren't all the best mags from, say, russia instead?-(
16.21.59 #       <Seed> Actually AF should cost you less
16.22.22 #       <Seed> West Europe is 67.61 :)
16.22.42 #       <Seed> See, I knock down the price for you.. :)
16.22.57 #       <ninline> no help for me?
16.22.59 #       <Merko> Seed: Ah.. but Israel is only part of west europe in the eurovision and in the footie tournaments?-)
16.23.29 #       <Seed> Merko: exactly :)
16.24.04 #       <Seed> Our politicians are good ;) they could probably accept us in South America as well ;)
16.24.26 #       <Merko> Heh..
16.24.58 #       <ninline> politician!  UGH what a nasty word!
16.25.36 #       <ninline> almost as bad as....lawyer!
16.25.54 #       <Merko> ninline: That's lame.. politicians are only as bad as you deserve..
16.26.44 #       <Merko> Lawyers are another matter. :)
16.27.02 #       <ninline> merko:  I can't believe I've done anything bad enough to deserve these guys.  :(
16.27.36 #       <ninline> merko: I believe I know how to fix the problem...only allow amiga owners to vote!  :)
16.28.05 #       <Merko> ninline: Well, of course not.. but there ARE better ones..
16.29.06 #       <ninline> btw...that amiga format site gives me an error 54, link broke when i try to subscribe....i suppose it's an SSL problem.
16.29.34 #       <ninline> merko: all the politicians I like are dead ones....
16.29.44 #       <Merko> IBrowse tells it is an SSL problem, and that you should mail them the address.. I did..
16.30.05 #       <Merko> ninline: Heh..
16.31.35 #       <ninline> what kind of amiga you all have?
16.32.21 #       <Merko> A4k
16.32.44 #       <Seed> I have 3 Amigas. But I'm not using the A500 and the A1200
16.33.07 #       <Merko> Sold my A1200T a couple of months ago, couldn't wait any longer to get a gfxboard. Plus I got a job over the summer so I could afford it, too. ;D
16.36.06 #       <ninline> I've got an A3000 and A500/A530...and a C128  :)
16.36.43 #       <Seed> going to bed.. night all
17.13.01 #       <algy> Hello
18.13.06 #       <Miracle> hi
