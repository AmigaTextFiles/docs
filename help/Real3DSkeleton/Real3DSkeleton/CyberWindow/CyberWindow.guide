@Node "Purpose" "Purpose of CyberWindow"

After the basic work on @{"CyberView" link "CyberView.guide/Main"} was finished Frank Mariak had the idea
for a window based image viewer which should demonstrate the possibility
to use Intuition screens with 15, 16 or 24 bit.

When the first quick hack was done it was great to see a true color picture
in 65536 colors inside an Intuition window. So I decided to continue the
development.

This program called "CyberWindow" is the result of this development.

@Node "Features" "Features of CyberWindow"

CyberWindow will run on any Amiga with OS 3.0 (or newer) and an installed
CyberGraphX system version 2.14 (or newer). The amount of free memory
which is required depends on the size of the images which shall be viewed.
CyberWindow can be used from @{"CLI" link "CLI"} and @{"Workbench" link "Workbench"}.

Supported file formats are:

- @{b}GIF@{ub}

- @{b}IFF ILBM@{ub}
  (1-8 bitplanes, EHB, HAM, HAM8, 24bit)

- @{b}JFIF@{ub}
  (based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group)

- @{b}DataTypes@{ub}
  (including full support of the V43 "picture.datatype")

- @{b}PBM+@{ub}
  (formats P1-P6)

- @{b}IFF PBM@{ub}
  (only 8 bitplanes, no masking data)

- @{b}PCX@{ub}
  (monochrom, EGA 1-4 bitplanes, VGA, 24bit)
@EndNode

@Node "Installation" "Installation of CyberWindow"

To install "CyberWindow" you only have to copy the binary to any directory
you like. If you want to view JFIF pictures you also have to install the
Tower JPEG Codec Class include in this distribution.

Users of my directory utility Filer (version 3.20 or newer) can add these
lines to their configuration file to use CyberWindow:
 CLASS "#?","FORM????ILBM","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","FORM????PBM ","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","??????JFIF","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","GIF8","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","P1","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","P2","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","P3","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","P4","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","P5","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?","P6","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
 CLASS "#?.PCX","","CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN %p"
And of course you have to use a display mode with a depth of at least
15 bits e.g. "CVision: 16Bit 1024 x  768".

CyberWindow can also be used as external viewer for Reinhard Haslbeck's
ImageDesk. Just set the external viewer for GIF, ILBM, JPEG, PNM and PCX
to "CyberWindow %s PUBSCREEN IMAGEDESK" and use a screen mode
with a depth of at least 15 bits.

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	CyberWindow FILES/M,PUBSCREEN/K,DELAY/K/N,SCALE/S,RESIZE/S,INFO/S,
	            CORRUPT/S,REQUESTER/S

@{b}ARGUMENTS@{ub}
	FILES:		filename(s) or AmigaDOS pattern(s) of the image(s)
			which shall be viewed

	PUBSCREEN:	public screen with a depth of at least 15 bit on
			which the progress indicator window and the
			graphics window will be opened

	DELAY:		automatically end viewing the current picture after
			the supplied number of seconds

	SCALE:		scale the picture instead of clipping it if the
			window is resized

	RESIZE:		automatically resize window to best size

	INFO:		view informations about the builtin loaders

	CORRUPT:	view even corrupt or incomplete pictures

	REQUESTER:	open a file requester even if one or more filenames
			where supplied as argument

@{b}EXAMPLES@{ub}
	Show informations about the builtin loaders:
	 CyberWindow INFO

	Load a single picture and show it on the default public screen:
	 CyberWindow Awakening.JPG

	Load "One.GIF" and "Two.PBM" a public screen called "MyScreen".
	 CyberWindow One.GIF Two.PBM PUBSCREEN MyScreen

	Load all pictures ending with ".ilbm", scale the pictures, resize
	the window and load next picture after 10 seconds:
	after 10 seconds:
	 CyberWindow #?.ILBM SCALE RESIZE DELAY 10

	Use a file requester to select pictures:

@Node "Workbench" "Using CyberWindow from Workbench"

There are three ways of using CyberWindow from the Workbench:

1.) @{b}As Default Tool@{ub}:
    Specify CyberWindow as the default tool of an image icon. Then double
    click on the image icon to view the picture.

2.) @{b}Multi Selection@{ub}:
    You can also use Workbench's multi selection feature to view pictures
    using CyberWindow. Click (single click) on an image icon or on the icon
    of a drawer with several image files, then press the shift key on your
    keyboard and continue to single click as many icons as you wish.
    When you're done double click on the CyberWindow program icon (while
    still holding the shift key).

3.) @{b}Using a File Requester@{ub}:
    If you simply double click on the CyberWindow programm icon a file
    requester will be opened and you can select one or more pictures which
    will be loaded.

If CyberWindow's display window is located on the Workbench it's an
application window so you can drop image or drawer icons on it.

You can configure CyberWindow by setting the tooltypes "PUBSCREEN", "DELAY",
"SCALE", "CORRUPT", "RESIZE" and "REQUESTER" in the @{b}program@{ub} icon. These
tooltypes have the same effect as the corresponding @{"CLI arguments" link "CLI"}.

	He gave me an example source for loading pictures with the
	"datatypes.library" and wrote the "jpeg.codec" used to load
	JFIF pictures.

	He helped me writing my (unpublished) GIF datatype on which
	CyberWindow's GIF loader is based. He also supplied me some PCX
	pictures for testing my PCX loader.
