                      @{b}HOW TO SEND US YOUR SUBMISSIONS
                      ===============================@{ub}

@{b}IMPORTANT! We can no longer accept your music modules as submissions for the
Amiga Format CD owing to copyright problems with sound samples from copyrighted
sources. Thanks for all your music submissions up till now, but please don't
send any more...@{ub}


We want you to send us your programs, animations, pictures, game tips and
cheats, hacks, hardware projects, basically anything you can think of that you
have done with your Amiga. It must be your own work - no passing off Chris
Achilleos' greatest masterpieces as your own, and we need a variety of things
from you in addition to your submission and we need them on your disk.

     @{b}1.@{ub} We need your name and address so that we know where to send your prize.
	You should also put your name and address on labels on your media.


     @{b}2.@{ub} We need two read me files accompanying your work; one for us and one
	to go on the CD itself (title them @{b}AF_ReadMe@{ub} and @{b}ReadMe@{ub}). These can be
	as in-depth as you want them to be, but should contain instructions for
	us on getting your work running if it is a complicated procedure,
	including things like necessary libraries and so on. The readme that
	will go on the CD will be the introduction of your work to the whole
	Amiga Format reading world so check your spelling and grammar and show
	people just what is so good about your work.


     @{b}3.@{ub} If your work requires files such as libraries which you cannot send
	us owing to copyright reasons make sure we know about them so that we
	can either arrange to put them on the CD, or warn our readers about
	them (you will probably do this in your CD read me).

     @{b}4.@{ub} Be aware that we won't be as interested in programs that need to
	boot or that require to be in a certain place on the CD, unless, of
	course, that place happens to be in your directory on the CD. Your
	directory will almost certainly have the path:
	@{b}"AFCDx:-ReaderStuff-/your_name/"@{ub} but then no-one will be able to run your
	program except from the CD, limiting its usefulness or appeal.

	If we do put something on the CD that needs to autoboot, it will almost
	certainly only be as a DMS that readers will have to extract to disk
	before they can use it.

	@{b}5.@{ub} Lastly, your submission @{b}must@{ub} include the following text within your
	AF_ReadMe file, otherwise your submission will @{b}not@{ub} go on the CD:

	@{fg highlight}In respect of all material which forms my reader contribution to Future
        Publishing's Amiga Format I hereby warrant that:-

	(1) the material is original and does not infringe any other material
            or rights;

	(2) the material does not contain any material which is defamatory,
            obscene or indecent and is exempt from classification under the Video
            Recordings Act 1984;

        (3) that there are no legal claims against the material
            provided;

	(4) that I have full power and authority to provide this material to
            Future Publishing.@{fg text}

        (There is a version of this text as a file in the -Look_here_1st!-
         drawer on the CD.)



You can send us your work on pretty much any sort of media whether it be floppy
disks (high or double density, but don't send us work on high density disks
unless you yourself have a high density drive. High density disks used in a
double density drive aren't as reliable as using double density disks), a
floppy disk back up using AmiBack, Quarterback or any of the shareware backup
tools, Zip disk, Jaz cartridge, SyQuest 44MB, 88MB or 105MB or EZ Drive, DAT
tape backup from any of the above-mentioned programs (the only thing we're not
very keen on is the Video Backup System that Power Computing sell in the UK,
we've had nothing but trouble with it), FTP upload to @{b}ftp2.futurenet.co.uk@{ub},
(you'll only be able to put your file in the incoming directory, you won't be
able to see it once you have finished uploading, but don't worry, it'll be
there. Make sure that you name your file with AF at the start so that we know
it's for us) basically anything apart from a listing on paper. We don't want
to have to type in your program too!


We will return any media more expensive than high density floppies via
registered post, so you won't have to worry about losing seventy quid's worth
of Jaz cartridge.
