                    AFCD SURVEY
                    ===========

In an effort to continually improve the quality of the
Amiga Format CD, we want to hear from you on what mix of
content you would like. Please either print this survey out
and tick the boxes that apply, or e-mail it to us at:
@{b}@{fg highlight}afcdsurvey@futurenet.co.uk@{fg text}@{ub} with the subject "@{b}@{fg highlight}AFCD Survey@{fg text}@{ub}".

PS. Please use an asterisk in the brackets for your choice
and add comments to the bottom of the file. Cheers!

1. Do you find it easy to find things on the CD?

   [ ] Yes, very
   [ ] It's OK
   [ ] Needs some work
   [ ] I can't find anything

2. Is there any particular shareware category we should
   concentrate more on?

   [ ] Games
   [ ] Graphics
   [ ] Music
   [ ] Programming
   [ ] Internet software
   [ ] Demos
   [ ] Utilities
   [ ] Your idea? _________________________________

3. Is CD³² support important to you?

   [ ] I should coco, I only have a CD³²
   [ ] It would be nice to autoboot on my A1200 to a menu
       of the games on the disc
   [ ] What's a CD³²?

4. If you have an internet connection, is our downloading
   internet utilities a waste of space for you?

   [ ] Yes, stop it immediately
   [ ] No, because I don't want to run my phone bill up
       enormously

5. Would you prefer NewIcons to MagicWB icons on the CD?

   [ ] Yes, definitely
   [ ] No, I prefer MWB infinitely
   [ ] I'm one of those awkward sods that wants both
   [ ] Just go back to standard 4 colour icons, please
   [ ] Who cares? Get a life, there are more important
       things to worry about than the icons on a CD!

6. Would you mind if there was a startup script on the CD
   that changed your font, screen and WBpattern settings
   (you would be able to change it back afterwards)?

   [ ] Aargh! Don't you dare!
   [ ] Oh go on then, I'm sure the mighty ones at Amiga
       Format know what they are doing
   [ ] Ho hum, if you must.
   [ ] Oooh please!





7. Do you want themed CDs? If so, what category would you
   like to see us fill the disc up with first?

   [ ] Games
   [ ] Graphics
   [ ] Music
   [ ] Programming
   [ ] Internet software
   [ ] Demos
   [ ] Utilities
   [ ] Your idea? _________________________________

8. Did you like the VIScorp audio track and would you like
   more taped interviews or music?

   [ ] Yes and yes
   [ ] Yes and no
   [ ] No and yes
   [ ] No and no

9. Because there is less stuff to put onto a CD these days
   would you rather:

   [ ] We only filled the CD with as much good stuff as we
       can find
   [ ] We filled the CD to the brim, but the quality might
       be a bit off
   [ ] We ran a CD every three months so that although the
       stuff on it might be old, the disc would be full
   [ ] Your idea?______________________________

10. Would you want to have stuff repeated on CDs, such as
    our Toulouse footage, software demos and so on? (and
    no, we won't be able to repeat coverdisks of yesteryear)

   [ ] Yes, if it filled the space up
   [ ] Yes, if it was still important
   [ ] No, I don't think so

11. Is there anything you'd really, really like to see on
    the CD?

12. Do you have any further suggestions for us?
