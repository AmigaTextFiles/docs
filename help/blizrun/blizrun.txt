                 MAKE BLIZKICK AND HD-GAMES INTERACT BETTER
                 ------------------------------------------


Perhaps you have encountered the problem with Blizkick and some hd installed
games? They won't run when it's active.

This textfile was made to guide you and other people with bad AmigaOS
knowledge to get them working smooth again! It's nothing special just a
guidance which I would have appreciated myself. Ok let's go ...

Just do the following step by step:

1.
Add the following lines FIRST in your s:startup-sequence (Just before
Blizkick! Make sure that you're not using the force option in Blizkick!)

--CUT--
if exists s:runthis
C:MakeDir RAM:T RAM:Clipboards
Assign >NIL: T: RAM:T
copy s:runthis t:
delete s:runthis >NIL:
wait 2
execute t:runthis
endif
--CUT--

2.
Create a textfile called "Blizrun" in C:! Add the following lines to the
file with your favourite editor!

--CUT--
.key program/a
echo "<program>" >s:runthis
wait 2
c:blizkick >NIL:
--CUT--

3.
Execute the following commandline at the shell prompt:

protect c:Blizrun es add


To run a game or whatever you wanna run then make sure that the following
points are fulfilled:

  * THE ARGUMENT FOR BLIZRUN MUST BE AN EXECUTABLE OR A DOS-SCRIPT FILE!
  * ALWAYS USE FULL PATH FOR THE EXECUTABLE/SCRIPT!

Example:

    BLIZRUN DH1:GAMES/GAME.EXE

Some hd installed games needs to be started inside their own directory. If
your game doesn't work then this may be the problem! Make a small script like
this:

--CUT--
cd YOUR_DIR
YOUR_EXECUTABLE
--CUT--

Turn on the 'S' flag with: PROTECT SMALL_SCRIPT S ADD
Then just use this small script as the argument: BLIZRUN SMALL_SCRIPT
