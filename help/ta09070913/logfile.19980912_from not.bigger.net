14.35.52 #       <wurzel> Rocambole: My mistake, STRICQ 0.560 (22.08.98)
14.35.57 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: not necessarily...
14.35.58 #       <Rocambole> Yoshi: np :)
14.36.00 #       <Worzel> Yoshi: want the new STricq notify rexx script?
14.36.24 #       <Yoshi> Worzel: What's that?
14.36.54 #       <Jamesc> Anyone seen someone with a name like "Neanderthal" come through?
14.36.59 #       <Worzel> Yoshi: later version of the rexx script thats in stricq 0.688 rexx dir, allows you to be offline, etc
14.37.43 #       <Yoshi> Worzel: Send it. :)  Thanks.
14.45.26 #       <wurzel> Does anyone know what the bad news is Jason Compton hinted at?
14.45.34 #       <Yoshi> wurzel: where?
14.45.46 #       <wurzel> I think it was TA ML
14.46.00 #       <wurzel> It could have been CU ML, Yoshi 
14.46.23 #       <Worzel> wurzel: was cu m/list
14.46.36 #       <wurzel> Worzel: Thanks, mate.
14.47.14 #       <Worzel> wurzel: and Andy Korn agreed there was some on way
14.47.51 #       <wurzel> Worzel: Yeah, but he wouldn't say what it was either :(
14.48.29 #       <Worzel> wurzel: except the one post by someone saying P5 were shutting shop :(
14.48.48 #       <Yoshi> Worzel: That wouldn't come as a surprise...
14.49.04 #       <wurzel> Worzel: Ah, I missed that one. That may well be it.
14.49.14 #       <Worzel> wurzel: hope it isn't
14.49.23 #       <Yoshi> Worzel: Like ExiE mentioned on his pages, Wolf got of the ICOA ML...

14.51.04 #       <wurzel> On the good side, I climbed 984 places in the RC5 challenge: now I'm 78159th !
14.51.18 #       <ExiE> i think nut many people will requre accelerators for mac with huge start of imac 
14.51.33 #       <ExiE> will better buy new model
14.51.55 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: many people put loads of money in their "old" Macs and won't leave it for a non-SCSI 15" model...
14.52.39 #       <Merko> I haven't heard much about IMac.. does it STILL have built-in monitor?!

14.54.20 #       <Rocambole> wb wurzel 
14.54.29 #       <Merko> Yoshi: That the main idea behind the IMac is to put a monitor glued onto it. ;D
14.54.47 #       <wurzel> Rocambole: Thanks, tried to join CU as well but pressed "connect"
14.55.16 #       <Merko> But.. IMac *only* comes with 15"??
14.55.20 #       <Yoshi> Merko: The main idea was to have an "easy to use" computer.  One that doesn't require 10 different plugs, is easily transportable, etc....
14.55.27 #       <Yoshi> Merko: Yep, only 15" (AFAIK)
14.55.30 #       <ExiE> now imac is only first model
14.55.51 #       <ExiE> but u can use seconf monitor :)
14.56.06 #       <Yoshi> if they were to do a 19" Imac, I wouldn't want to be the one to move it arround. :)
14.56.14 #       <Merko> Yoshi: Well, a monitor isn't hard to use.. ppl know how to connect a TV to their videos, they can also manage to connect a monitor to their computer imho. ;D
14.56.24 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: Yes, but I think the gfx card only has 2 MB (IIRC)...
14.57.17 #       <ExiE> nope
14.57.19 #       <Merko> 2MB?! You've gotta be joking.. I heard nice things about IMac!
14.57.23 #       <Yoshi> Merko: Of course, but it's easier to assemble, easier to transport, easier to fix ("got any problem?  bring *it* back to your dealer" :)
14.57.25 #       <ExiE> its 4GB 
14.57.35 #       <Yoshi> Merko: I have to verify the 2 MB
14.57.40 #       <ExiE> if i read well
14.57.44 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: I was talking about gfx card memory
14.58.06 #       <ExiE> me too :)
14.58.09 #       <ExiE> i will look
14.59.29 #       <Yoshi> Merko: I just verified in German mag "c't":  the Imac has 2 MB SGRAM gfx memory.
14.59.33 #       <ExiE> 2MB of SGRAM video memory; supports up to 6MB via SO-DIMM slot
14.59.46 #       <ExiE> directly from apple.com
14.59.54 #       <wurzel> Ah, gotta go, getting a small guru :( Must clear system ..
15.00.01 Quit    wurzel (:Bye all, gotta get some sleep ;-))
15.00.16 #       <ExiE> 6MB is usable :)))
15.00.38 #       <ExiE> http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html
15.00.48 #       <ExiE> i know i see it somewhere
15.00.57 #       <Yoshi> 2 MB is enough for the 15", but not enough for a 19" or better (believe me, I only have 2 MB :)
15.01.09 #       <Merko> 2MB would mean 780*590 max in 24(32)-bit.. what mac-person would want that?!
15.01.11 #       <ExiE> there are some tables with 2MB and 4MB and resolutions/.colors
15.01.34 #       <ExiE> 800 by 600 95 Hz 24-bit, millions of colors
15.01.42 #       <ExiE> 1,024 by 768 75 Hz 16-bit, thousands of colors
15.01.46 #       <ExiE> with 2MB
15.02.02 #       <Merko> 4mb isn't nearly enough for 17" imho, but maybe that's only on Amiga when you want several screens to swap between in a jiiffy. :)
15.02.22 #       <ExiE> Video - Built-in ATI RAGE IIc accelerated 2D and 3D graphics chip
15.02.42 #       <Yoshi> Merko: I gave up screens...  takes several seconds to switch.  Now I have everything running on a 1152x900 Workbench (only 256 colors though :(
15.04.12 #       <Merko> Yoshi: Ah.. I can't live without screens.. first when I got the gfxcard I was very frustrated, of course 1024*768 is better than 656*414 but not enough to fit all on one screen..
15.04.36 #       <Merko> But then I found the nodrag tooltype which makes screenswapping fast like on AGA. :)

15.07.04 #       <Yoshi> Merko: I only have a PII :(
15.07.17 #       <Merko> Yoshi: Ah.. not many then, I guess. ;D
15.07.32 #       <Yoshi> Merko: 68 Hz
15.07.43 #       <Yoshi> Actually, more than in 640x480 AGA :)
15.07.47 #       <Merko> Hmm.. not bad. I don't think the cv3d gives that many..
15.08.37 #       <Merko> Hmm, yes it does..
15.08.40 #       <Yoshi> Merko: CV3d = CV64?
15.08.55 #       <Merko> Yoshi: No.. cv64/3d.
15.09.19 #       <Yoshi> Merko: Still, a CV64 should be at least one generation "in front" of a PicassoII...
15.09.21 #       <Merko> Hmm, why am I not using it then.. gotta be because screenswitching is too slow then. 8)
15.09.54 #       <Merko> Yoshi: Yes, it does 1280x1024 in 67Hz.. probably possible to push that up a bit too. :)
15.10.18 #       <Merko> I even tried ADoomPPC in 1600x1200@50Hz. 8)
15.10.44 #       <Yoshi> Merko: I can only do 1280x1024 at 45 HZ (interlace), 1600x1200 at 36 Hz...
15.11.07 #       <Merko> My monitor doesn't support less than 50Hz..
15.11.30 #       <Merko> Anyway.. I managed to kill an imp with my fists in ADoom at that resolution, so I guess it was playable then?-)
15.11.39 #       <Yoshi> Merko: neither does mine.  I use 90Hz interlace and 72 HZ interlace.  Wrong wording above
15.11.56 #       <Yoshi> :)
15.12.31 #       <Merko> Yoshi: Ah.
15.12.58 #       <Merko> Anyway.. 50Hz looked awfully flickering at first.. can't imagine I used to run it like that until 10 months ago. ;D

18.23.57 #       <Jamesc> TA, How come the Team Amiga mailing list dropped me?! Should I just reattach?
18.24.05 #       <TA> Jamesc: No problem!
18.24.50 #       <TA> Jamesc: Yes, sometimes I get a couple of days where a mailserver dumps the messages back to me. I unsubscribe peeps figuring it's a server problem or they have changed accounts.
18.25.57 #       <Jamesc> Okay.. Thanks for the explanation :) So it was probably because I had a problem with my CNet for a couple of days there...

18.46.30 #       <TA> we should have ONE world time period.
18.46.38 #       <Revenant> yeah GMT
18.46.56 #       <TA> let it be the same exact time all over the world and just adjust sleep patterns or something.  :)
18.47.20 #       <Seed> TA: we all adjust sleeping patterns as it is :)
18.47.40 #       <whispa> could try by phases of the moon
18.47.45 #       <Revenant> do you have a sleeping pattern?
18.48.09 #       <TA> Revenant: Yes, when I am tired, I sleep.
18.48.37 #       <Revenant> TA: what a luxury
18.48.56 #       <Seed> TA: It's easy for you.. for some, it doesn't work so smoothly :)
18.49.04 #       <TA> well, actually my job and TA and the ICOA frequently interfere with my sleep patterns, but ...
18.51.16 #       <Seed> those who are really lucky have sex interfere with their sleeping patterns :)

18.52.59 #       <Seed> anyone using web trackers of any kind?
18.53.13 #       <TA> Seed: Too expensive.
18.53.23 #       <Seed> Expensive?
18.53.48 #       <TA> If you are talking about those things that track users, etc, yes they cost about $10 monthly.
18.53.56 #       <Seed> I meant those who come for free.. I have 2 but they don't give much info. I tried a third now, but the logo disappears :)
18.54.17 #       <Agima> Seed : Are you using WebTracker from FXWeb?
18.54.21 #       <Seed> TA: try HTTP://www.counterguide.com/  you'll be surprised to know how many of those are free :)
18.54.36 #       <Seed> Agima: FXWeb?
18.54.47 #       <Agima> Seed : www.fxweb.holowww.com/tracker/
18.54.57 #       <Agima> IF they still give out new counters.....
18.54.59 #       <Seed> let me check it
18.55.28 #       <Seed> Ohh. this is the one I registered 5 mins ago :)
18.55.35 #       <TA> My isp furnishes a counter. I have found too that some of those trackers actually suck down email addresses for spammers who pay them for lists.

19.37.25 #       <TruKr>   Well, I payed a guy for his shareware stuuf since he was leaving Amiga, the key was <see above> but I did not know, they said somthing about it, I regd, I retured, and DFDuck slamed me because my new key was from a brit site (the ONLY place to use a creadit car)
19.38.01 #       <TruKr> kickd/band
19.38.02 #       <BillM> Well, that's a bit rediculous.
19.38.04 #       <TA> TruKr: What diff does it make where you get a key from if it is legit?
19.38.28 #       <TruKr> I don't know, but DFDuck is an %^$$%#@
19.38.45 #       <TA> I order from all over the world using credit cards. Shame on he who bans me for ordering from somewhere they don't like.
19.39.23 #       <TruKr> He said two days was too soon, I must have made another pirate key, what an ass
19.39.27 #       <BillM> TA: I got rid of all my credit cards last spring.
19.39.37 #       <Seed> The guys on that channel are pretty rude. Don't take it personally
19.39.43 #       <TruKr> WEll, I was realy using debit card :)
19.39.57 #       <TA> BillM: Me too, but this is really a Visa Debit Card. That way I know it is gone the second I click submit.
19.40.22 #       <BillM> TA: How do those debit cards work?
19.40.29 #       <BillM> Fee wise, I mean.
19.40.36 #       <TA> And I actually buy from as many places as possible just to keep them in business.
19.40.43 #       <TruKr> Same as credit card only from you checking account
19.41.03 #       <TA> BillM: No fee, it is an instant debit to my checking acct. Like writing a check or doing an ATM 
19.41.12 #       <BillM> but how do they make their money off of you?
19.41.32 #       <TA> BillM: They don't. It is a way of getting my checking acct with thier bank.
19.41.33 #       <TruKr> I pay NO fee
19.41.43 #       <TA> It's like an ATM card.
19.42.04 #       <TA> But, Visa or Mastercard also accept it for instant withdrawels from your acct.
19.42.26 #       <TA> I think merchant's pay some fee (like 2%) when we use them.
19.42.39 #       <TA> But they also pay with a real Visa too, so no loss to them.
19.43.11 #       <BillM> Hmmm. I may have to look into that some day.
19.43.36 #       <TA> BillM: It's great as long as you remember that it come sout of your acct right away.
19.43.39 #       <TruKr> It's a good way to order things, and NOT be paying for life :)
19.44.14 #       <TA> And most banks will issue a debit card to anyone who has an acct without regard to credit status.
19.44.26 #       <BillM> I take it you should write the transaction into your check book right away, then?
19.44.34 #       <TruKr> YES!
19.44.47 #       <TA> BillM: Yes, cause that money is gone seconds after clicking submit in most cases.
19.45.26 #       <BillM> OK, well, I've just finished that other graphic, and it's called FireStorm. Anyone?
19.45.44 #       <TruKr> Can I see?
19.45.53 #       <TruKr> huh?huh?
19.45.53 #       <BillM> sure
19.46.04 #       <Revenant> BillM: yeah OK, and could you offer the other one too pls?

20.12.55 #       <Seed> Yes. PPaint is very much like it
20.13.01 #       <Seed> only FASTER :)
20.13.08 #       <TA> Seed: Typical CoonAss (Cajun- Louisiana French) color blind.
20.13.25 #       <Kinners> At least Windows is consistent when it crashes :)  Every time I use it, something crashes :(
20.13.28 #       <sdesros> Seed: In RTG modes maybe... :)
20.13.30 #       <Seed> Ya Cajun?
20.13.32 #       <Seed> :)
20.13.37 #       <TA> sdesros: I could never get DPaint to open a screen on my Cybergfx 64/3D.  :(
20.13.42 #       <TA> I have that too.
20.14.20 #       <Seed> sdesros: in AGA modes nothing comes close to Brilliance.. but I think PPaint is still faster than DPaint in 8-bit mode
20.14.21 #       <TA> Seed: Very much so, one side of the family is heavily La. French, the other is German Irish.
20.14.28 #       <TruKr> I can get DPaint to OPEN on a Picasso IV, but EA bangd the hardware on some things and it would crash
20.14.38 #       <Seed> Ta: do you speak French?
20.14.56 #       <sdesros> TA: Dpaint V?
20.15.04 #       <TA> Seed: I used to fluently. Have forgotten most of it over my 46 years. Though I know some when I hear it.
20.15.06 #       <Seed> TA: how is your gnawing animal doing, BTW? :)
20.15.38 #       <TA> sdesros: Yeah, I won that on AmigaZone and it sucked for me since I have no AGA.
20.16.07 #       <TA> Seed: The wolf puppy is getting bigger and bigger. Almost the sioze of a German Shepherd now.
20.16.26 #       <TruKr> TV Paint is nice on GFX cards
20.16.30 #       <sdesros> TA: There was a bug on my DPaintV.  I have to first open the software on the default screen mode...  Then I can change the screen mode to anything else.
20.16.39 #       <Seed> TVPaint is the king, period
20.17.01 #       <TA> sdesros: But, if I don't have aga, it just locks up that opening screen.
20.17.22 #       <Seed> TA: I think your A3000 is not a real Amiga :)
20.17.39 #       <TA> I even offered to trade version V for another version and got no takers.
20.17.41 #       <Seed> I'm almost certain DP5 worked on my A500
20.17.42 #       <TruKr> I have 3.6 here, but can not use it as the jerks did not put the serial number on the disk, and, and, and this stuped jerk LOST it :(
20.18.17 #       <sdesros> TA: mine defaults to CyberGraphics...  320x240x8 strange.
20.18.26 #       <sdesros> Seed: I never tried TVPaint...  What is it like?
20.18.27 #       <TruKr> DP5 WILL work, but, ECS??? akc!
20.18.50 #       <TA> TruKr: I am saving my cash for that developer box and an Inside-out card.
20.19.18 #       <TA> sdesros: Went looking for some Java books. $40 per book for a 4 book set from Sun!!
20.19.23 #       <TruKr> I would like ta have the InsideOut card :)
20.20.03 #       <Seed> sdesros: It's like a dream. the first Amiga program to do layers properly, and many tools that you can only get on expensive programs like Fractal Designer on the PC/Mac
20.20.17 #       <TA> Be prepared to get asked about some good Java books for those of us just getting into it.  :)
20.20.22 #       <sdesros> TA: You can find some okay books at those "Discount Computer Book Stores"...  You might not have the "latest" information but it's a good place for a general start.  Your best bet is to get the API, joing the Java Developer's Connections (it's free).
20.20.58 #       <sdesros> Seed: What's the going price for it now a days?  
20.21.00 #       <Seed> Fractal Painter.. oops :)

20.21.29 #       <Seed> sdesros: no going price. I doubt they still sell it. It's only for GFX cards, though
20.21.47 #       <TA> Seed: Wher can we get TV paint?
20.22.24 #       <sdesros> TA: I'll try and get some ISBN# from some of the books I've got at work.  (But books become out-of-date quite quickly with JAVA's rapid evolution)
20.22.28 #       <Seed> TA: I don't remember. I don't own it..  just toyed with it for a long time
20.22.36 #       <sdesros> Seed: WCi did have a copy of it.
20.22.44 #       <TA> Seed: Didn't that come on a CU or AF coverdisk at one time?
20.22.50 #       <Seed> sdesros: right. they had it
20.23.04 #       <TA> who is WCI?
20.23.11 #       <Seed> TA: A $300-$400 program? I doubt it
20.23.40 #       <sdesros> TA: WCi is "Wonder Computers International".  Their main retail location is about half an hour's bus ride from my house. :)
20.23.48 #       <Seed> It works like a dream on a Z3 card.. 32-bit mode at 1024x768 is so fast
20.23.58 #       <TruKr> I REALY don't think the full program would be on a cover disk
20.24.10 #       <Seed> sdesros: really? so can you check if they still sell it?
20.24.18 #       <TA> TruKr: I think I have a demo of it somewhere. I will search later.
20.24.30 #       <TA> Too many disks and cd's to do that now.
20.24.37 #       <Seed> they are working on the PC version.. they don't develop the Amiga version anymore
20.24.38 #       <sdesros> Seed: Yup.  Although I only remembered a single box.
20.24.53 #       <TruKr> I started woth TV-Paint Jr, came with my first GFX card, a Picasso II
20.25.07 #       <Seed> the Jr version was pretty cool as well
20.25.30 #       <TA> I may have to go visit Wonder on the net and see if they have it.

20.32.55 #       <TA> sdesros: He had it doing all kinds of beautiful things, then when he wanted to change his mind and erase something, just hit the right mouse button and went over whatever with the mouse and it went away.
20.33.06 #       <TruKr> Hmmm, maybe new colors needed?
20.33.27 #       <Ashke> colors look fine...just maybe set up for too many lines?
20.33.44 #       <Trucker> I am typing UNDER blue ansi bar, black background, green text
20.33.44 #       <sdesros> Ashke: Change your brightness and contrast on your monitor. :P
20.33.47 #       <Seed> TA: that was the best thing with the early versions of Photogenics..  the undo only works after you hit the "fix" button
20.34.10 #       <Trucker> Ashke, do an ET and set lines
20.35.01 #       <TA> Of course, Paul made it all look so easy, I was drooling for it. It should be out in a month or two now.
20.35.21 #       <TA> I asked why he couldn't release it then and he said it wasn't perfect yet ... :)
20.35.46 #       <Seed> He's busy drooling over it himself
20.35.47 #       <TA> His wife verified that he is somewhat of a perfectionist about his work.
20.36.04 #       <Seed> Isn't he too young to be married? :)
20.36.18 #       <sdesros> TA: The funny thing is that I get all of these image processing software, and I'm not the artist... :)
20.36.34 Quit    Ashke (:CNetIRC 3.5  (Amiga) exiting.)
20.36.46 #       <TA> Seed: He is about 19 I think, beautiful wife, very understanding person. She was like a fifth wheel with people all over Paul and she just grinned and beared with it.
20.37.24 #       * Seed ponders... why make this mistake when you are so young :)
20.37.25 Join    Ashke [0] (eldor@ftworth.tx.tnt1.181.fastlane.net)
20.37.27 #       <TA> Seed: Published and sold well his first work at like 11 or 12.
20.37.50 #       <Trucker> Ashke: now?
20.39.11 #       <TA> It was funny, she told me that Paul will lock himself up in the computer room and code without stop for days, just snacking every so often.
20.39.50 #       <TA> She said he was driven like he just had to get whatever is in his head into the computer at times.
20.39.53 #       <Seed> well, that's what I'm saying.. I would never do that to my wife :)
20.39.58 #       <Trucker> Sounds like Ray
20.40.12 #       <Seed> well, artists and programmers are like that :)
20.40.23 Quit    Ashke (:CNetIRC 3.5  (Amiga) exiting.)
20.40.32 #       <Trucker> OK But this is gooder :)
20.40.36 #       <TA> Seed: If you saw her, you wouldn't do that to her either. It would be hard to get my mind back onto programming with her around.  :)
20.40.38 #       <Trucker> l8r Ashke
20.41.24 #       <Seed> TA: That's why I don't program. I want to be able to spot those gorgeous creatures when they walk near me :)
20.41.25 #       <TA> They make an excellent couple. Paul is very shy and introverted. She was very outgoing and easy to talk to.
20.41.43 Join    Ashke [5] (dlund@ppp-151-164-40-195.rcsntx.swbell.net)
20.41.53 #       <TruKr> So, Trucker, how do YOU like CNet IRC 3.5?
20.42.04 #       <TA> And she beemed from ear to ear every time Paul got a compliment. 
20.42.05 #       <Seed> shy is good.. as long as it doesn't hurt his money-making
20.42.19 #       <TruKr> HEY, dose it anounce ME like that? huh, <pout>
20.42.23 #       <TA> Seed: She will see that it doesn't ... :)
20.42.23 #       <Seed> TA: is she British? Older than he is?
20.42.48 #       <TA> Seed: I think they are the same age. She sounded British or Irish but I didn't ask.
20.42.54 #       <Seed> TA: He had a big dispute over thhe old version.. I'm sure you are aware of this
20.43.03 #       <TA> Seed: Yes.
20.43.26 #       * Trucker thinks that CNet Amiga BBS ANYTHING rules :)
20.44.32 #       <sdesros> Anyway, I've got to run...  I'll see you all on Monday... :)
20.44.35 #       <TA> Paul talked a little about that. This one won't goout until HE thinks it is perfect.
20.44.43 #       <TA> see ya Stephan!
20.44.49 Quit    sdesros (:Client exiting)
20.45.29 #       <Seed> TA: I don't think I'll ever meet him.. tell him Photogenics Lite is cool.. if you see him again :)
20.45.42 #       <Ashke> *Trucker's right! :)
20.45.49 #       <TA> Seed: Part of that dispute surrounded the fact that Paul didn't have complete control over it either.
20.45.59 #       <Seed> TA: I know that
20.46.06 #       <TA> PhotoNG he does have complete control over.
20.46.28 #       <Seed> I don't think I'll be able to buy it
20.46.29 #       <TA> I doubt he will ever do it any other way again.
20.47.14 #       <Seed> Perfectionists do things their way. It's the only way for them to have complete control over it
20.47.58 #       <TA> Paul's wife had a smile that would melt chocolate at 100 yards ... :)
20.48.22 #       <Seed> Well, I guess it would melt things inside of me :)
20.48.48 #       <Seed> not sure which things exactly :)
20.49.04 #       <TA> While he was on irc, she was whispering in his ear about how to answer some of the things. I think they make a great pair. They were like one person.

20.52.43 #       <TA> Seed: 26 years and climbing here.
20.53.00 #       <Seed> TA: I'm happy for you
20.53.25 #       <TA> Seed: Don't be ... :)
20.53.32 #       <Seed> I'm being polite
20.53.34 #       <TA> It was an accident that we even get along.
20.53.56 #       <Seed> Well, those accidents get you on the right track sometimes :)
20.54.07 #       <TA> She is completely computer illiterate, hates the things. Thinks we are all idiots for spending so much time on them.
20.54.29 #       <Seed> find a way to make her hate it less :)
20.54.39 #       <TA> She talks on the phone just as much as I play on the computer though.  :)
20.54.51 #       <Seed> worked for me..  not with a partner to life, but with friends.. and family
20.55.03 #       <TA> Seed: Well, Holger helped with that some. She can now do Voyager and IRC.
20.55.25 #       <Seed> I hardly play.. although I did break my SpellTris highscore yesterday :)
20.55.32 #       <TruKr> TA: My wife has her own computer, a PC thingy for playing games
20.55.50 #       <TA> She double clicks the Miami icon and it auto dials in and brings up Voyager for her. If she wants irc, (seldom) she can do that.
20.55.54 #       <Seed> Give a PC to a wife.. you are cruel :)
20.56.19 #       <Seed> TA: so she doesn't hate it THAT much after all :)
20.56.48 #       <TA> Seed: She ONLY gets on it for Beanie Baby's and when I am at an amiga show so she can irc in and chat with me.
20.57.03 #       <TruKr> SHE picked it, so she could play Kings Quest, DN3D ect
20.57.50 #       <Seed> I can't go to Amiga shows. And no wife here :)
20.58.06 #       <Seed> Not many Amiga users here, as a matter of fact :)
20.58.35 #       <TruKr> We have TWO Amiga BBSs here :)
20.59.05 #       <TruKr> and BOTH the SysOps are on the chanel now :)
20.59.15 #       <Seed> you are lucky
20.59.48 #       <TA> Fredy: Did you get the channel note about the Java conf Monday?
21.00.09 #       <Fredy> Yep
21.00.17 #       <TA> OK, just making sure it works.
