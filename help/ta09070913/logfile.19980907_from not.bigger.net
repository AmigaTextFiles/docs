13.37.56 #       <Jodel> ExiE: Connection refused, although you can ping it
13.38.49 #       <Jodel> FrMan: It's hanging after booting the kernel and finding the autoconfig devices(hangs after recognising the PowerUp board)
13.39.53 #       <Jodel> FrMan: I'll have to do some more investigation on LinuxAPUS :-)
13.39.58 #       <FrMan> Jodel well do you manage module for power up board or is it in Kernel ??
13.41.47 #       <Jodel> FrMan: It's a bit tricky as it uses some kind of ppc_boot/bootstrap, the kernel identifies the devices in already PowerPC only mode (68k is on HALT by that time)
13.42.28 #       <FrMan> Jodel well you then compile the Kernel for having this behaviour ?
13.46.54 #       <Jodel> FrMan: I'd compile the kernel if it would make sense, but I have a "working" kernel here (from jesper) the only thing is that it seems to need some tricky action on the Amiga Startup and that's why I was searching for someone who maybe has a nice trick :-)
13.48.47 #       <FrMan> Jodel you have a working kernel but maybe not for you config :) the Kernel is loaded and uncompressed at very early startup :)

13.57.39 #       <Jodel> Isn't it toy compared to anything? Except maybe MacOS... I even think my AmigaOS ahead of it as I definately have more control over the machine here.

14.41.19 #       <ExiE> grrr
14.41.20 #       <FrMan> Yoshi you installed it on ShapeShifter ?
14.41.22 #       <ExiE> i hate them
14.41.37 #       <ExiE> now i know that only few people read the newspage
14.41.57 #       <FrMan> Blitmanic well I've heard there's a military class7 engin in the game but I can't remember where at the moment
14.42.02 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: promote it.  success doesn't come over night.
14.42.23 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: When I began, I also only had <100 visitors per day
14.42.26 #       <Blitmanic> really sounds great
14.42.47 #       <ExiE> promote ? where ? :)
14.42.48 #       <Blitmanic> whats the best you`ve found?
14.43.21 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: take a look at the image, it just the progression of the number of visitors
14.43.31 #       <Yoshi> just=shows
14.43.33 #       <m0lder> what should I get...explorer or netscape ?
14.43.35 #       <Yoshi> :)
14.43.49 #       <ExiE> what image ? :)
14.44.03 #       <Yoshi> m0lder: Netscape.  It's available in v4 whereas MSIE only exists in v3
14.44.18 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: The image I wanted to DCC you and which you (your software) ignored
14.45.01 #       <Yoshi> It just said: -ExiE- - You are now being ignored - 
14.45.08 #       <ExiE> sorry for that :) i only hate when everybody version me when i say i remove key for amirc 
14.45.20 #       <ExiE> i say it so its true
14.45.33 #       <ExiE> its removed
14.45.41 #       <ExiE> please try it again :)
14.45.58 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: OK :)
14.46.27 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: The graph is over the entire period of ANN's existance (dec-96 'til now) and shows the number of visitors per week.
14.47.16 #       <m0lder> the .bin file...do I just copy it over to the mac drive and shrinkwrap it, or is it self extracting ?
14.47.22 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: as you can see, I began at 600 per week, then was below 1000 for some months and gradually became more visited
14.47.23 #       <ExiE> but what we are doing bad ? band news ? daily updates ? its so often ? or what :)
14.48.04 #       <Merko> ExiE: Why do you think you're doing bad?
14.48.04 #       <Yoshi> m0lder: Copy it over to the mac drive (mac-handler) and decompress it.  Don't know how.  Try executing, if that doesn't work, try an unarchiver.
14.48.04 #       <ExiE> :)
14.48.18 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: good things take some time :)
14.48.29 #       <m0lder> Yoshi: Ok....just downloading first...it's over 7 Mb
14.48.34 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: the number of visitors do not determine the quality of a site
14.48.52 #       <Merko> ExiE: Ah.. well, it takes some time for word to get out. :)
14.48.57 #       <ExiE> we promote our page with pekr on cucug and newsgroups an mailing list (was holidays so we should repeat it again)
14.48.59 #       <Yoshi> m0lder: The version I have (basic install) is 5 MB
14.49.39 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: I found exclusive news to be a good thing to boost visitor numbers
14.49.42 #       <Merko> ExiE: You'll have to be a bit patient.. personally I think your page is the best at the moment. :)
14.49.51 #       <m0lder> Yoshi: I'm getting complete 68k Netcape Communicator 4.06
14.50.05 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: another thing is to have unique news that isn't available on other places (difficult, I know)
14.50.14 #       <ExiE> yoshi: but do great page for only few people especially when it takes quite enough  time a day :(
14.50.20 #       <Blitmanic> what the   url?
14.50.36 #       <Yoshi> m0lder: OK.  I just wanted Navigator, not the mail/news clients since YAM/Microdot are better for that :)
14.51.22 #       <Merko> Blitmanic: http://www.realdreams.cz/amiga/
14.51.34 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: Things will gradually improve, I think.  But you'll never make a fortune out of it.
14.51.39 #       <Blitmanic> thx
14.51.43 #       <ExiE> yoshi: i am not sure but i think we have enough news as first and unique (talks witg Gary, Dave etc) and we are bringing news about software/hardware/ pages/newsgroups/mailinglists
14.52.03 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: If you want to make money on the net, there are other, more promising subjects than the Amiga :)
14.52.14 #       <ExiE> i want make money :)
14.52.22 #       <ExiE> grr i wont
14.52.23 #       <ExiE> :)
14.52.45 #       <ExiE> if i wanted make money i leave a amiga years before :)))
14.52.54 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: Try to get mentioned on AWD some more times.  Email Kevin Hisel whenever you have exclusive (and worthwile) news, so he can mention the news and your site
14.53.06 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: do the same for amiga.org
14.53.22 #       <ExiE> do what ?
14.53.53 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: mail Wayne Hunt if you have exclusive news
14.54.03 #       <ExiE> aha :)
14.54.33 #       <ExiE> its question how long is news eclusive ..we cant get more then 24hours  :)
14.54.34 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: AWD and Amiga.org are used as portals by a lot of Amigans, therefore it's important to be mentioned there
14.54.52 #       <m0lder> and hqx are what type of file ?
14.55.03 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: Mail them as soon as your update is online and only if no other site is online
14.55.19 #       <Yoshi> m0lder: AFAIK it's the mac's equivalent of something like lha or lzx

15.06.50 #       <Yoshi> and what's worse, almost the entire newsgroup has gone to anti-tim mode and for every of his posts, you see 10 flames...
15.07.12 #       <[X_MaN]> Yoshi:so we can read your summaries and you can read te flames;)
15.07.28 #       <Merko> Yoshi: I guess it couldn't put up with what it was displaying all the time. ;D
15.07.47 #       <Yoshi> [X_MaN]: exactly.  except that people now spend all their time flaming, instead of spreading and discussing news. :(
15.07.48 #       <Merko> What is 2W?
15.08.06 #       <Yoshi> Merko: I suppose so. :))
15.08.22 #       <Yoshi> 2W = Second Wind ML?
15.08.23 #       <Merko> Yoshi: Well.. if they had any news they would spread that instead, but of course it thins things out. ;D
15.08.34 #       <Merko> What is second wind?
15.08.40 #       <amigaman> :-) yes
15.08.53 #       <Yoshi> Merko: Agreed, but I'd rather have no news at all than flames :)

15.51.57 #       <Dave_C> and the recurrent versioning could be considered harassment.

15.52.17 #       <DrJekyl> Dave_C: that is why a PC / mac user will not get a version request on each join
15.52.33 #       <Yoshi> I never got a version request. :)

16.14.37 #       <[X_MaN]> Drj:perhaps because noone has regulated it yet?  And also because it is a VERSIOn request

16.19.35 #       <Dave_C> I was just mentioning our discussion w/ Ray
16.19.37 #       <HMetal> Only ones I see would give a hang are pirates.. :)

16.20.19 #       <[X_MaN]> Drj:that is a part of the Piracy wg, an initiative calld Pirates Anonymous
16.20.25 #       <HMetal> VERSION is a valid IRC command..

16.21.00 #       <HMetal> Dave: If there is no version reply, their script should see that as non-pirate..
16.21.04 #       <Dave_C> and can be an invasion of privacy
16.21.17 #       <HMetal> Privacy?
16.21.20 #       <HMetal> It's a public command..
16.21.33 #       <Dave_C> but it's not a forced one.
16.21.34 #       <[X_MaN]> Hmetal, Version is, not the reg bit

16.23.00 #       <HMetal> I see no harm there..  How they protect their software is their issue.  If I were a pirate, I'd find other software to pirate instead..
16.23.33 #       <HMetal> As for Dave's comment about no version reply..  Well, I CAN see a problem there if they are labelling no version reply as PIRATE.
16.23.34 #       <Dave_C> bbiaf.. got a hot date!

16.24.54 #       <DrJekyl> HMetal: I didn't label, I just mentioned that if someone hacks the code of AmIRC to not give a version reply then it is possibe thay are covering something up
16.24.59 #       <HMetal> I use a PC for IRC..  big deal. :)  I still develop Amiga software first and foremost.
16.25.34 #       <[X_MaN]> Hmetal:big deal to you and I, to others it is a real big deal:)
16.25.39 #       <HMetal> DrJ: Probably.. but I wouldn't make that an assumption to base their being a pirate on. :)
16.25.57 #       <HMetal> X: they should be happy we develop for Amiga computers..
16.26.15 #       <[X_MaN]> HMetal:hehe your not far wrong my friend;)
16.26.18 #       <HMetal> I use this PC for IRC because there are other things I do in the background (a certain music habit I have) ..
16.26.20 #       <DrJekyl> HMetal: well as you saw, you didn't have an AmIRC version reply, but noone assumed anything
16.26.37 #       <HMetal> I have an mIRC version reply. :)
16.26.41 #       <HMetal> for now..
16.26.49 #       <HMetal> I had an AmIRC version reply last night..
16.26.58 #       <[X_MaN]> HMetal:ugh Mirc is terrible:(  Dont u like Virc?
16.27.08 #       <HMetal> That's the fun of having 4 system on a LAN.. you get to choose another one if the one you want to use is busy. :)
16.27.13 #       <DrJekyl> HMetal: and your username and hostmask have been saved so you'll not get versioned again this month ;)
16.27.25 #       <HMetal> I used to use vIRC but mIRC has better scripts available..
16.27.41 #       <bernie> anyone here have v40 of serial.device?
16.27.46 #       <HMetal> DrJ: cool
16.27.53 #       <[X_MaN]> HMetal:now correct me if Im wrong as I dont use scripts, espcially PC ones, but can`t virc use Mirc scripts?
16.28.17 #       <HMetal> X: Not that I'm aware of..  SOME, yes, but not the majority..
16.28.19 #       <[X_MaN]> Hmetal:Script.ini one of the scripts u use;)
16.28.38 #       <[X_MaN]> Hmetal:hmm I assumed from the installer that it can use all?
