09.03.56 #       <Alakhai> Hi there!
09.04.00 #       <Dave_C> Hi Martin!
09.04.27 #       <Alakhai> How are you?
09.04.45 #       <Dave_C> <sigh> better after 3 hours of catching up on T*A_ml
09.06.02 #       <Alakhai> OK.
09.06.21 #       <Dave_C> Hope I didn't offend anyone in my piracy speech
09.06.29 #       <Alakhai> Do you by any chance know anything about ShapeShifter and the PrepareEmul script?
09.07.03 #       <Alakhai> Are you with or against piracy? :)
09.07.18 #       <Dave_C> Well.. I'm Team*AMiGA, and ICOA
09.07.27 #       <Alakhai> This server is lagging quite a bit...
09.07.31 #       <Alakhai> Oh, I see... :)
09.07.49 #       <Alakhai> I didn't catch that. Where do you live, then?
09.08.02 #       <Dave_C> Alabama USA.. Redneck Central
09.08.36 #       <Dave_C> I'm also a member of the ICOA Betatesters Workgroup.
09.09.03 #       <Dave_C> So I'm very anti-piracy
09.09.21 #       <Alakhai> OK. I'm from Sweden, and except for this evaluation of AmIRC, most of my softwares are fully legal. I'm anti-piracy too.
09.10.03 #       <Dave_C> Good to see another Swede w/ good morals!
09.10.13 #       <Alakhai> Thanks!
09.10.22 #       <Dave_C> The Euro scene seems to be predominated by pirates
09.10.32 #       <Alakhai> The same to you...
09.11.01 #       <Alakhai> Yes, in fact I don't know from where everyone get their copies...
09.11.03 #       <Dave_C> I can feel for the shipping and cost predicaments, but that is still no excuse for piracy
09.11.39 #       <Alakhai> I agree.
09.11.50 #       <Alakhai> Brb...
09.12.13 #       <Dave_C> I have participated in some piracy (in younger days), mostly for evaluation purposes.
09.12.17 #       <Dave_C> I don't deny that
09.12.29 #       <Dave_C> BUt if I find an app useful to me., I buy it
09.13.04 #       <Dave_C> I'm as guilty as any other amigan using shapeshifter w/ pirate roms, but once I tried it, I deleted it

09.13.50 #       <[Gemini]> now i havent been here in a coupple of days... anything new?
09.13.57 #       <Dave_C> I hope I didn't piss John Block off either.
09.14.29 #       <Alakhai> I'm back...
09.14.37 #       <Alakhai> Hi Gemini.
09.14.41 #       <Dave_C> I know that when we have US based IRC confs, it can be quite uncomfortable for the Euro market, but remember, we've had to get up early too (probably more often)
09.15.14 #       <[Gemini]> have there been a conference?
09.15.25 #       <Dave_C> At WoA I had to get up @ 5AM after working til 3AM
09.15.49 #       <Dave_C> One coming up the 14th
09.16.08 #       <Dave_C> Stephane D. and Fleecy Moss discussing JAVA and its impact on the AMiGA_NG
09.16.21 #       <Alakhai> Dave: Actually, I've piracy ROM:s to, but I will buy a set om ROM:s when I buy Fusion within the next month or so. Just got so excited that I had to test Mac emulation with ShapeShifter.

09.18.29 #       <Alakhai> Dave: That's a shame... :( Ist there any 68K portable (Notebook) Mac?
09.19.31 #       <Alakhai> I must say this channel is nicer than the few channels we have in Sweden! :)
09.20.46 #       <Merko> Alakhai: Not as many people though. ;D
09.21.03 #       <Alakhai> No, but that's OK with me...
09.21.11 #       <Dave_C> That was one of my problems w/ Mac emulation.. 
09.21.19 #       <Dave_C> you have to pirate the ROMS to do it.
09.21.28 #       <Alakhai> Anyone here got an internal Zip-drive in the Amiga?
09.21.36 #       <Merko> Alakhai: Well, if you're alone with darx and chanserv, it's not a lot of fun here. ;D
09.21.46 #       <[Gemini]> Alakhai: nope... sorry, dont hav a zip drive
09.22.01 #       <Alakhai> Dave: Is there any hardware with Mac ROM:s on it? A-max or Emplant?
09.22.04 #       <Dave_C> I have a zip, but it's external scsi and developed a bad spindle
09.22.23 #       <Dave_C> Al: Nope.. that was the main holdback on those.
09.22.31 #       <Dave_C> Apple refused to license them
09.22.59 #       <Alakhai> I cannot format disks with my Zip anymore, though It's not used very often... :(
09.22.59 #       <Dave_C> you have to have a Mac, grab the rom image and then only use the image when the Mac is NOT working
09.23.18 #       <Dave_C> My zip won't recognize ANY disks inserted
09.24.02 #       * [Gemini] will b a little buissy now... gonna try reinstalling I-B
09.24.07 #       <Alakhai> The drive may read pre-formatted disks (both PC and Mac), but as soon as I try formatting into Amiga format, the drive "klicks" for about 5 minutes, followed by "Cannot format track 0"... :(
09.24.14 Nick    [Gemini] is now known as Gem_Working (kimts@ti18a21-0061.dialup.online.no)
09.25.07 #       <Alakhai> Dave: I'm planning on buying a portable 68K Mac, and since I won't use them both at the same time it should be fully legal to use the ROM:s in the A4000.
09.25.21 #       <Dave_C> That'll work
09.25.49 #       <Alakhai> Merko: I agree... :) Nice talking to the real folks, though... :)

09.27.33 #       <Merko> Humhum.. there are rumours FusionPPC won't need the ROMs, somehow..
09.27.55 #       <Dave_C> Merko: How are you gonna emulate a mac w/o the roms?
09.28.21 #       <Dave_C> That'd be like emulating an AMIGA on PC w/ a romfile
09.28.41 #       <Dave_C> (and I still can't get UAE to work)
09.28.50 #       <Dave_C> even WITH a good ROMFILE
09.29.42 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Well, from what I've heard the ROM isn't really used with MacOS8..
09.29.42 #       <Dave_C> well.. 
09.30.02 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Only a little maybe, but that might be possible to work around. I don't know..
09.30.09 #       <Alakhai> Merko: I think you will still be needing the ROM:s, even with FusionPPC... That's life, I guess... :(
09.30.27 #       <Dave_C> I have to go update my CNet installation
09.30.33 #       <Merko> Alakhai: Well.. it's just something I heard. I don't know.
09.30.42 #       <Dave_C> v4.64
09.30.47 #       <Gem_Working> is it 100% sure that fusionPPC will come???
09.30.53 #       <Alakhai> Merko: AS far as I know, v. 8 does require ROM:s, but Rapshody don't...
09.30.59 #       <Gem_Working> i just ordered myself a PPC card 2 day :-)
09.31.11 #       <Dave_C> Gem: Sorry to hear that.

12.01.56 #       <FrMan> well I've an intranet with 3 computers here and have to prepare all power supply , phone lines and net cables before making the transfert
12.03.56 #       <[Gemini]> oh... no morethen 3 computers :-).... i only got one (well, actualy i got an old 500, but its tucked away in a closet)
12.04.22 #       <FrMan> well an Amiga 500, a linux Pentium and a Linux 486
12.04.29 #       <FrMan> Amiga 1200 I mean
12.04.45 #       <FrMan> and soon buy an Alpha I hope
12.05.22 #       <[Gemini]> wow.... will, im quity pleased with my A1200.....
12.05.39 #       <[Gemini]> wich next week will b housing a 200MHz ppc card :-)
12.06.10 #       <[Gemini]> i just ordered it 2 day
12.06.19 #       <Merko> And I'll get my CVPPC finally.. :)
12.06.37 #       <FrMan> [Gemini] well i'm please with my 1200 too but I w8 for a complete new Amiga Platform I don't want to explode my Amiga in a tower I think it'll looks like a PeeCee id I do that
12.07.17 #       <FrMan> if I do that even
12.07.30 #       <[Gemini]> well.... my tower is just a rebuilt pc tower... but i dont care what it looks like, the point is that it is an AMIGA
12.07.46 #       <[Gemini]> im even using a lmae win95 keyboard
12.08.00 #       <[Gemini]> Merko: what card have u ordered?
12.08.21 #       <Merko> [Gemini]: CyberVisionPPC.. there is only the 8mb version I think.
12.08.46 #       <[Gemini]> Merko: yeah... but what cpus?
12.09.00 #       <Merko> [Gemini]: I already have 604e/233+060
12.09.38 #       <[Gemini]> wow, im setteling 4 a 040/25 + 603e/200
12.10.04 #       <[Gemini]> and thenall i have 2 do is sit back and w8 4 the b-vision :-)
12.10.13 #       <Merko> Yeah. :)
12.11.19 #       <[Gemini]> seems like the cheapest way 2 get a gfx card 4 an A1200
12.11.40 #       <[Gemini]> hacking zorro onto the A1200 is not cheap
12.12.03 #       <Merko> No.. or reliable.. and it's not very fast..

12.13.36 #       <[Gemini]> hey beyas 
12.15.19 #       <[Gemini]> i have alredy bought quake, but even with a 040 i wont have the juice 2 make it run at a decent speed
12.16.21 #       <Merko> [Gemini]: It seems they won't.. I also bought the original, and I'm not ashamed for using another executable with it.

12.18.05 #       <[Gemini]> i guess that if CB wont make a port il do the same myself :-)
12.18.39 #       <Merko> I preordered it because they said I'd get a PPC version.. I think it's unplayable on the 060 too, I didn't buy it for the 060 version.
12.19.21 #       <Merko> And now.. I got a PPC version. No 16bit-support, and changing screenmodes is a pain, but otherwise it seems to work quite well.
12.19.23 #       <FrMan> bye all :)
12.19.42 Part    FrMan
12.19.55 #       <[Gemini]> ahh... i actualy preorder it myself, and 4 many of the same reasons, i had already planed 2 get a ppc card, and since i only got a 030 now, u can understand that i diddent order it 2 play it on that cpu :-)
12.21.18 #       <Merko> [Gemini]: Yes.. I don't understand how they can be saying "there's no PPC market", well maybe there's only about 10000 cards out there, but ALL of those were sold during the last year, all are in use by active owners, and all the owners want some software for it!
12.22.05 #       <[Gemini]> is there as many as 10.00....??? thats not half bad actualy
12.22.20 #       <[Gemini]> ops.. 10.000 :-)
12.22.32 #       <Merko> I don't know for sure, but there were like 7000 units I think a few months ago.. and my impression is that they sell better now.
12.22.51 #       <[Gemini]> i have heard so many numbers ranging frome 2.000 up to 14.000 (i think)
12.23.41 #       <[Gemini]> Merko: when i ordered my ppc card i got the impression that the shop i ordered it frome had sold quite a few of them
12.24.08 #       <Merko> [Gemini]: Where did you order it from? DK?
12.24.26 #       <[Gemini]> nope, Amico
12.24.43 #       <Merko> Ah.. never heard of them. :)
12.25.18 #       <[Gemini]> well... afaik thers 3 shops here in norway selling Amiga stuff, DK, Sezam and amico
12.25.56 #       <[Gemini]> i got good experience with amico, and the guy usualy gives me good prizes (he remembers me eacg time i call) :-)

14.19.45 #       <Yoshi> ExiE: I don't think so.  They existed before Clickboom even did the 68k version.
14.20.10 #       <ExiE> they should sad PPC version is in progress (no matter how long) but people wait :)

15.15.03 #       <Arvid> DrJekly: and it is strange that Seed and I suffered the same error condition
15.15.39 #       <Merko> Arvid: Anyway.. if they start up on PAL for some stupid reason, just use NewMode or similar to promote them the first time, and then change..
15.16.29 #       <Seed> Arvid: I haven't heard about problems from others. Maybe it's a personal thing against us :)
15.16.33 Quit    Seed (:Excess Flood)
15.17.32 #       <Arvid> Merko: about PAL .. I suppose that is true.  But in the case of (for example) Scala from a CU Amiga cover disk, the program runs but the PAL is not appropriate for NTSC video.
15.18.09 #       <Merko> Arvid: Eh.. doesn't SCALA support NTSC?!
15.19.07 #       <Arvid> Merko: I have not found a way to force it to NTSC
15.20.04 #       <Merko> Arvid: That's really strange.. I mean, not a lot of work exactly from their part to make it work..

16.47.09 #       <Arvid> <-- will gripe about the Netconnect2 install to anyone who will listen
16.47.20 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:whats up with it?
16.47.23 #       <[X_MaN]> that good?
16.47.41 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: I have seen noone with this problem yet 
16.48.06 #       <Arvid> X_man: .. the first gripe ... when I ran the installer, it exited when it could not install reqtools.library on my A3000.
16.48.24 #       <Arvid> And certainly it could not.  I have reqtools.library set for read only.
16.48.46 #       <Arvid> And the netconnect2 install tried to install an older version over my newer version.
16.48.53 #       <Arvid> That was the FIRST problem.
16.49.01 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:lol thats a good program if I ever saw one;)
16.49.25 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:people like that should go program for the pc where they are deserving of such tactics:(
16.49.46 #       <Arvid> X_man I agree 
16.50.16 #       <DrJekyl> <-- off to bed
16.50.20 #       <DrJekyl> nite all
16.50.24 Quit    DrJekyl (:Oh my God! They killed Dors account ! You *NICE* people :)))
16.50.42 #       <Arvid> After renaming my reqtools.library and rebooting, the install finally worked. But netconnect2 could not find the IP address of my ISPs DNS.  Miami can find it with no problem.
16.50.43 #       <[X_MaN]> arvid:then?
16.51.04 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:so why not enter is manually?
16.51.30 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:NC is an Amitcp program right?
16.51.41 #       <Arvid> X_man so then I found the address and started the program again to try to find the place to add the IP address.  But netconnect2 keeps telling me I have a sana2 device installed, and exiting without actually completing the connection
16.51.52 #       <[X_MaN]> Amitcp creates a ENV variable for DNS
16.52.22 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:NC sounds like Amitcp remade in a finer UI that still doesnt work
16.52.25 #       <Arvid> X_man I have had amitcp 4.0 demo working for years.  But this netconnect2 thing really raised my blood pressure
16.52.51 #       <[X_MaN]> does it still have the 50,0000 config files and things?
16.52.53 #       <Arvid> X_man that seems to be correct, it errors out here
