14.24.35 #       <Worzel> Yoshi: he's probably still there, wondering where everyone is :)
14.24.58 #       <Yoshi> It's kinda depressing to see how few people there are in the channels...  even in this "official" one.
14.26.08 #       <Worzel> Yoshi: yeah, try Netconnect where I'm an Op. 6 months ago we'd regularly have 20+ people on at this time of night, there are 3 of us there at mo, and thats good!

14.49.42 #       <[Gemini]> i ordered a 32 MB SIMM with the card..... and l8er ill probably get an aditional 32MBs more
14.49.53 #       <[Gemini]> then the card wont take anymore

14.50.33 #       <Arvid> hi Seed
14.50.41 #       <[Gemini]> but i guess 64MBs fast should b more then what i need (even though u cant get enough RAM)
14.51.19 #       <Arvid> Gemini: the only acceptable amount is 64 giga-terabytes
14.52.38 #       <Seed> [Gemini]: I had 128 of them.. and the Mac emulation wasn't happy :)
14.55.13 #       <Yoshi> Seed: did it need more or didn't it like the large amount?

14.56.02 #       <Seed> Yoshi: for scanning A4 pages you need at least 84 megs :) And PhotoShop needs its own memory as well :)
14.56.02 #       <[X_MaN]> hey DrJekyl

14.56.31 #       <Yoshi> Seed: I only have 32 MB...  and can only go up to 64... :(
14.56.33 #       <[X_MaN]> Seed:photoshop allocates its own swap file for scanning and shit...
14.56.57 #       <[X_MaN]> Seed:if you have enough hd, you can scan anything on a pc in theory
14.57.17 #       <Seed> [X_MaN]: I know that
14.57.39 #       * Yoshi has a scanner since a few days but still needs to register the scanner software... (ScanTek)
14.57.52 #       <Seed> [X_MaN]: but I use a Fusion hardfile on RAM: So Photoshit can't really write to any HD if I don't want it to :)
14.57.57 #       <[X_MaN]> yoshi:what scanner works on AMiga?
14.58.19 #       <Yoshi> [X_MaN]: I have a Microtek ScanMaker 630.  Works nicely. :)
14.58.23 #       <[X_MaN]> Seed:oh on pc;)  Well using fusion you should fill up your hd in no time at all;)
14.59.30 #       <[X_MaN]> so what are u all up to?
14.59.36 #       <[X_MaN]> anything worth noting?
14.59.44 #       <[X_MaN]> anyone seen the articles on Sir Clive S?
14.59.59 #       <Seed> [X_MaN]: I know how PS works on the PC.. pretty annoying.  but at least you can scan any page size even with 32 megs of RAM
15.00.38 #       <[X_MaN]> seed:only in theory, photoshop allocates itself a 500mb swap file and wont delete it so you have room to save;)

15.03.40 #       <Yoshi> [X_MaN]: I merely said that I didn't like the idea of being online all the time to read the articles.
15.04.40 #       <[X_MaN]> Yoshi:oh thats a good point, but only really for the few countries where the net is expensive, I see nothing wrong with online reading for myself, but then net time is dirt cheap for me

15.11.07 #       <[X_MaN]> Stephane:lol relaxing,  I am also waiting on some arrivals so:(
15.11.12 #       <Arvid> Pondus: .. well, it took me until someone in this channel mentioned that I have to set the installer to 'expert' before I could even install the software .. that was the first problem
15.11.13 #       <[X_MaN]> hello James
15.11.46 #       <Pondus> Arvid: Ok. I always use expert something. Anything else is mostly a mess..
15.11.53 #       <[X_MaN]> Arvid:to be honest 99% of Amiga software should be installed in expert mode, the others are only there for a joke in the current version of insaller imo
15.12.05 #       <Arvid> Pondus: installer would gripe and exit when it discovered that it could not overwrite newer files on this A3000 with older files from the CU Amiga CDROM
15.12.10 #       <Pondus> Xman: Agree
15.12.18 #       <Arvid> X_man I am beginning to discover that
15.12.26 #       <Cryto> I use intermediate, just so I dont have to say where every stinking part of the program will end up.. :)
15.13.05 #       <Arvid> <-- and then I discovered that the CU Amiga CD tried to overwrite one library and about 16 mui files with older versions
15.13.24 #       <Pondus> arvid: not good
15.13.41 #       <Arvid> <-- and Neil B did not my allusion to a Windows 98 install and its similar problems
15.13.49 #       <Cryto> Arvid: The installer script didnt check for version #'s, and ask you if you wanted to over write them??
15.13.58 #       <Pondus> Arvid: Therefore always expert modee
15.14.23 #       <Arvid> Cryto: only in expert mode .. in intermediate, it just griped and exited, because I had the library set to read only
15.14.26 #       <Blitmanic> well I think it depends who wrote the installer script , some expert modes check everything which isn`t needed ( well I don`t thnk so )
15.14.41 #       <[X_MaN]> lol it does go over the limit
15.14.46 #       <[X_MaN]> MUI is one bitch in expert mode
15.15.11 #       <Jamesc> You can remove the "in expert mode" there X Man :) 
15.15.39 #       <[X_MaN]> James:nah I always used MUI on a 04+ with a grafix card so it is always fast thanks;)
15.15.47 #       <Arvid> Pondus: and then after the install, I kept getting a wierd error message about having a sans2 device working .. but the problem there seemed to be my older (and working) installation of amitcp/ip 4. demo
15.16.31 #       <Arvid> Pondus: so I removed all assigns which affected the older amitcp/ip installation
15.16.57 #       <Pondus> arvid: is it now working?
15.17.15 #       <Arvid> Pondus: and now it just won't get through the Genesis Wizard.  It just exits.
15.17.22 #       <Pondus> I haven't installed the demo version as I bought it as fast as Chris had the original available
15.17.49 #       <Pondus> arvid: hmm
15.18.00 #       <[X_MaN]> why would anoyone upgrade from Amitcp 4?
15.18.05 #       <[X_MaN]> what is new in genesis?
15.18.11 #       <[X_MaN]> 4.0 worked fine
15.18.22 #       <[X_MaN]> 4.3 introduced one hell of a lot of problems
15.18.23 #       <Arvid> Pondus: so I have stopped for the moment, actually I have Miami 3.0d (paid for) and amitcp/ip 4.0 demo working fine on both my Amigas
15.18.26 #       <Pondus> It has this Miami setupu thing with support for multiple setups
15.18.48 #       <Pondus> I have Nectcoonect to And Miami. Both paid for
15.18.52 #       <[X_MaN]> pondus:so did 4.0 if you used slipcall as a sllip/ppp dialer
15.18.54 #       <Pondus> I have Nectconnect 2 to And Miami. Both paid for
15.18.58 #       <Pondus> I have Nectconnect 2 And Miami. Both paid for
15.19.00 #       <Arvid> Pondus: and I posted on csa.networking .. Neil B. did not my language.
15.19.35 #       <Arvid> <-- used the word   pffffffffflt  in the first post
15.20.39 #       <[X_MaN]> pondus:not sure why you would buy both?
15.21.21 #       <Arvid> Pondus: actually, I think the Genesis Wizard errors out at the part where it supposedly is getting parameters from the ISP
15.22.46 #       <Pondus> X-man: I bought Miami 9 months ago.
15.22.54 #       <Pondus> I then upgraded Miami
15.23.05 #       <Arvid> <-- bought Miami when it was version 1.0
15.23.14 #       <Pondus> And when Netconnect 2 was out, I upgraded from vers 1 to 2
15.23.32 #       <Pondus> I bought it mostly beacuse of Amirc,AMFTP and so on
15.24.04 #       <Pondus> Today, I have both easy available.

15.31.14 #       <Arvid> Pondus hmmm
15.31.16 #       <Blitmanic> sounded interesting , but they didn`t say how much it cost
15.31.53 #       <Pondus> It costed me the upgrade of i think £29.90
15.32.41 #       <Pondus> The price is £54.95 on CD
15.32.53 #       <Pondus> sorry, The price is £59.95 on CD
15.33.31 #       <Pondus> Cheaper than to buy each program individual

17.26.39 #       <BillM> a hah! NDA! ;)
17.27.42 #       <BillM> I'm currently reading a treatise on Public Key encription by Dave Haynie. It sure is cool to be on the Team Amiga Mailing List with that guy. :)
17.28.25 #       * [X_MaN] isnt too sure that is the way to go
17.28.34 #       <[X_MaN]> encryption has serious fallacies
17.28.52 #       <BillM> Oh, he's just explaining how it works.
17.30.03 #       <[X_MaN]> I know
17.30.37 #       <[X_MaN]> the thing is, when u have encryption systems, a CPU wont run encrypted code, the moment it is decrypted it can be ripped, and bye bye protection scheme...
17.31.30 #       <BillM> Unless the decryption could be kept on board the CPU, in other words done on the fly.
17.32.26 #       <[X_MaN]> on the fly is still decrypted
17.33.09 #       <[X_MaN]> and doing it line by line would make it intolerably slow
17.33.20 #       <BillM> But, if it's inside the CPU, wouldn't that make it that much harder to get at?
17.33.39 #       <BillM> Since it's only decrypted while it's in the CPU, not in memory.
17.34.05 #       <[X_MaN]> how is it stored in the cpu?
17.34.16 #       <[X_MaN]> that is line by line Bill
17.34.42 #       <[X_MaN]> it would run slower than a specturm
17.35.12 #       <BillM> yeah, you're probably right.
17.35.55 Ctcp    Ping from BillM!wmaddock@dialin-81.icon-stl.net

17.37.00 #       <Arvid> Sounds like you are talking about a V-Chip
17.37.21 #       <[X_MaN]> Bill:it will make casual piracy harder, but seeing as the profesiional crackers destroy the need for casual pirates to remove codes etc... it is a bloody hard task
17.38.12 #       <BillM> They're "discussing" piracy and possible cures on the Team Amiga Mailing List. I think Gary's almost sorry he brought it up.
17.38.29 #       <[X_MaN]> hes not
17.38.47 #       <[X_MaN]> Gary`s post got me some valuable material

17.38.58 #       * [X_MaN] is the ICOA piracy Manager
17.39.08 #       <DrJekyl> BillM: the longer it runns the more people will think of it as a real issue
17.39.10 #       <BillM> AHHH
17.39.51 #       <BillM> It's been degenerating into an argument over whether or not Piracy is actually bad, though.
17.40.22 #       <BillM> That wastes time from figuring out how to stop it.
17.41.14 #       <[X_MaN]> Bill:that is irrelevant, there have been some excellent posts, Dr Kittel pointed me to an encryption chip, and Stephane D pointed out a nice system, others spoke of developer support,and developers spoke of their feelings
17.41.40 #       <[X_MaN]> Bill:like all media you mut learn to sift through the junk
17.42.05 #       <BillM> I like Dave's idea of a low power transponder that you could carry around with you.
17.42.38 #       <[X_MaN]> That I will NEVER permit as long as I am manager
17.42.53 #       <[X_MaN]> this is NOT a movie!

17.43.47 #       <[X_MaN]> It is ESPIONAGE stuff
17.44.05 #       <[X_MaN]> why on earth do we need to implement willingly anything of that nature?
17.44.08 #       <BillM> Never thought of it that way.....
17.44.15 #       <[X_MaN]> we want to enable people to STOP piracy
