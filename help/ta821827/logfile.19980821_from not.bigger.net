06.52.27 #       <HAMLET> IRC maniac
06.53.12 #       <_DNA_> yeah, when I see demos from those countries I think there are all ppl so smart
06.53.15 #       <Jamesc> I'm still awake! Sorta...
06.53.19 #       <_DNA_> aha, I was too :)

06.55.23 #       <_DNA_> still alive, hamlet?
06.55.56 #       <_DNA_> james: australia? Is this where are you from?
06.56.29 #       <HAMLET> Still alive... just handeling some problems on another Network
06.56.58 #       * _DNA_ eats just a good chocolate
06.57.39 #       <_DNA_> hamlet: do you know dave_c from this channel? I thought he's still here as channel operator
06.58.10 #       <_DNA_> all: do you know Joe torre has leaved Amiga, Inc.?
06.59.11 #       <Jamesc> Yup . Aussie through and through :)
06.59.28 #       <Jamesc> Just wandering around working on servers here.. Sorry about the delay :)
06.59.29 #       <_DNA_> damned! great lag
06.59.47 #       <_DNA_> I have great lag too
06.59.49 #       <Jamesc> Had to stoke the fire too!
07.00.10 #       <Jamesc> 1 second to you in real time :)
07.00.34 #       <Jamesc> Bout Joe,.
07.00.41 #       <_DNA_> james: stoke the fire? what do you mean? sorry, i'm no E. native speaker 
07.00.52 #       <Jamesc> Dave_c is still the operator.
07.01.15 #       <Jamesc> Joe has left to persue more interesting things.. I forget the exact thing he wants to do..
07.01.18 #       <_DNA_> bout joe... do you know something more?
07.01.28 #       <Jamesc> Gary (TA) tells everyone all the time :)
07.01.48 #       <Jamesc> Stoke the fire = Put more wood on the range and give it a poke :) Cold night here :)
07.02.00 #       <_DNA_> I heard that he left 'cause he found out that he has nothing to do in strict SW only company
07.02.03 #       <Jamesc> Now Joe was Hardware.. Right?
07.02.09 #       <Jamesc> Yeah
07.02.20 #       <Jamesc> That was not exactly it.
07.02.27 #       <_DNA_> so what?
07.02.46 #       <Jamesc> He left on quite amicable terms. He just thought he could use his talents more elsewhere..
07.02.55 #       <Jamesc> They were still using him I believe
07.02.59 #       <_DNA_> I JUST WONDER, how wil design the NG Os5.0 hardware with that MMC stuff? who?
07.03.19 #       <Jamesc> The question on a lot of Amiga fans lips...
07.03.30 #       <_DNA_> yeah...too true
07.03.57 #       <Jamesc> We had Fleecy Moss in here, from A.I. the other day.. Was a great chat session! 
07.04.01 #       <_DNA_> personally, I'm too more HW oriented guy, so I'm quite curious...
07.04.22 #       <_DNA_> should be... but I have Inet access only at school, so... 
07.04.35 #       <_DNA_> no chance to catch that
07.04.37 #       <HAMLET> Oh darn.... i forgot.... ....
07.04.54 #       * HAMLET sighs.... i missed the fleecy meeting =/
07.04.57 #       <Jamesc> There is a transcript of the more salient points.. 
07.05.06 #       <_DNA_> where?
07.05.15 #       <Jamesc> Dave C has it. I have it on another partition I don't have access to right now..
07.05.24 #       <Jamesc> Ummm.. There's also a web page... 
07.05.29 #       <HAMLET> Jamesc: I`ll get it from Dave or Rocam or some of the others
07.05.49 #       <_DNA_> what web? TA?
07.06.12 #       <Jamesc> Somewhere in the news section there as I recall... Can't find the address right now...
07.06.13 #       <_DNA_> probably stupid question, sorry :)
07.06.44 #       <_DNA_> all: do you know new Amiga News page? It's our local: www.realdreams.cz/amiga
07.06.49 #       <HAMLET> James: Your from aussie no?
07.06.56 #       <Jamesc> Someone else will pop up who has the transcript or the web address...
07.07.01 #       <_DNA_> it's very good, really...
07.07.38 #       <Jamesc> Yes Hamlet .. Sure am.. 
07.07.39 #       <_DNA_> jamesc: anyway, what interesting has fleecy told?
07.08.03 #       <HAMLET> James: Know any good shells or VServers that you can run IRCD off?
07.08.14 #       <HAMLET> Based in AU of course
07.08.18 #       <_DNA_> all: ad the news page:  multiple updates almost every day
07.08.42 #       <Jamesc> Oh all sorts of things.. Umm the new hardware is coming along well. There's a quoteee
07.08.51 #       <Jamesc> around which goes somwething like
07.09.07 #       <Jamesc> "The new platform will be the Millenium machine"
07.09.39 #       <_DNA_> damned, but who's working on the HW?  
07.09.45 #       <Jamesc> Shells or VServers Hamlet?? What meanest though? I run oz.beyondirc.net here in Australia...
07.10.14 #       <HAMLET> You run it?? =)
07.10.16 #       <_DNA_> nice words, but I would appreciate some more concrete info
07.10.26 #       <Jamesc> He gave a string of information about that.. Nothing definite I recall.. 
07.10.40 #       <Jamesc> A lot of it was like that..
07.10.47 #       <Jamesc> We all got a chance to ask dumb questions. 
07.10.58 #       <Jamesc> Hamlet: Yes :) I most certainly do :)
07.11.15 #       <Jamesc> It runs on Galaxy GateWay, my network here in Oz.. :)
07.11.24 #       <_DNA_> james: okey, the machine he mentioned - should it be the sub$500 machine?
07.11.31 #       <_DNA_> or architecture in general?
07.12.34 #       <Jamesc> I wouldn't like to say. There was mention of that figure in some respect, but I can not recall specifics - Would be better to get it from the hses proverbial :)
07.12.39 #       <_DNA_> Isn't it strange - Amiga, Inc. as now SW only staff company talks 'bout millenium hardware? 
07.12.46 #       <Jamesc> horses proverbial that should be :)
07.13.06 #       <Jamesc> Where are you from Hamlet?
07.13.32 #       <HAMLET> Jamesc: Would it be possible to get a shell and run ircd off it from you?
07.13.41 #       * HAMLET is from Norway
07.13.45 #       <_DNA_> james: ok, I hope I will find that transcript on monday somewhere
07.13.56 #       <Jamesc> Well they do have others besides Joe.. Joe was going to be involved in the creation originally.. 
07.14.15 #       <Jamesc> Drop a note to Dave C and he can probably email it to you..
07.14.29 #       <_DNA_> okey, please address...
07.14.31 #       <Jamesc> You mean give you shell access on my box?
07.15.10 #       <HAMLET> James: Yes....
07.15.36 #       <Jamesc> Just type /noteserv send dave_c Please email the fleecy transcript to me@yourhost.whatever 
07.15.41 #       <_DNA_> Jamesc: one more thing -- was fleecy still talking only about MMC (so no mention about a 'real' CPU meant as general purpose processing unit?)
07.15.47 #       <Jamesc> And noteserv will tell him
07.16.10 #       <Jamesc> Hamlet: Nice try :) Not a chance :) Why do you want to run your own ircd anyways? 
07.16.13 #       <_DNA_> James: so does it really look like that MMC will do all the stuff? also general code execution?
07.16.43 #       <HAMLET> James: I`m in need of an AU server
07.16.44 #       <_DNA_> james: thanks a lot
07.16.47 #       <Jamesc> Ah, now I'm _pretty sure_ that you are right on that last comment DNA ... 
07.17.06 #       <Jamesc> Hamlet, why an au server?
07.17.52 #       <Jamesc> If You are in Norway!?
07.18.09 #       <_DNA_> James: as I told you, I'm interested. I wanna study Computer Architecture, and just recently I was (and I will again) writing an article 'bout that MMC stuff for our local diskmag
07.18.11 #       <HAMLET> We have quite a few AU users, and only have 2 US servers and 1 EU server
07.18.41 #       <Jamesc> Who 'we' Hamlet?
07.19.04 #       <HAMLET> UltimateIRC.net
07.19.11 #       <Jamesc> Well, grab the transcript from somewhere.. Send that noteserv message. :)
07.19.12 #       <HAMLET> I`m the Network Administrator there
07.19.21 #       <_DNA_> jamesc: also, I had some discussions with hazy.  maybe more ppl dont like his attitudes, but I like him - 'cause he is always so willinfg to talk with me. 
07.19.28 #       <Jamesc> Oh right Hamlet.. I see...
07.19.58 #       <Jamesc> Wonder when Dave usually comes on channel?
07.20.23 #       <_DNA_> james: damned.. sorry. I using VMS on my girlfriend account... can you tell me again what should I type?
07.20.39 #       <_DNA_> James: no IRC... just emails. 
07.20.53 #       <_DNA_> it's 1.5 year I'm talking with him
07.20.56 #       <Jamesc> Just type /msg nickserv send dave_c <message here>
07.21.03 #       <_DNA_> thanks!
07.21.14 #       <Jamesc> Message something like: Please email me transcript of fleecy chaat
07.21.23 #       <Jamesc> And an email address of course :)
07.21.49 #       <Jamesc> So What's UltimateIRC like Hamlet?
07.22.04 #       <_DNA_> whats nickserv? variable?
07.22.08 #       <Jamesc> And I doubt you'll find it too easy to find an .AU based irc...
07.22.11 #       <Jamesc> Ahh
07.22.19 #       <_DNA_> or some key word?
07.22.30 #       <Jamesc> You probably haven't ever registered your Nickname here?
07.22.30 #       <HAMLET> Well... its a pretty small network still.... strictly Familysafe... no swearing etc....
07.22.38 #       <_DNA_> no, I had
07.22.46 #       <HAMLET> James: Yeah... i know =P
07.22.46 #       <Jamesc> I like it already Hamlet :)
07.22.54 #       <_DNA_> As DNA, and@fornax
07.23.09 #       <HAMLET> We have our own IRCD.... developed by me...
07.23.11 #       <_DNA_> and@fornax, is that what you mean?
07.23.18 #       <HAMLET> Based on DAL
07.23.21 #       <_DNA_> sorry, I dont want to bother
07.23.31 #       <_DNA_> I'm just in big hurry, actually
07.23.38 #       <HAMLET> Full services...... lots of fun =P
07.23.50 #       <Jamesc> Oh, okay.. 
07.24.11 #       <Jamesc> Well.. You register your nick with /msg nickserv register <password>
07.24.35 #       <Jamesc> You can do it when you're not in such a hurry :) See you next time DNA
07.25.17 #       <Jamesc> Well if it's family oriented, I wish you the very best of luck :)

12.50.38 #       <Ogge> roc, r u intrested in a mail monitoring script for amirc?
12.51.12 #       <Rocambole> could be nice, how does it work?
12.52.11 #       <Ogge> at the moment u start the monitoring with the command /mail start (have to set an alias) and then it checks your mailbox every n:th minute.. easy config directly in the script.. will be a config file in an hour or two.. 
12.52.24 #       <Ogge> and u can stop monitoring with the command /mail stop
12.52.41 #       <Rocambole> ok, let me have a try
12.52.54 #       <Ogge> ok w8.. have to fix the file for ya.. 
12.53.03 #       <Rocambole> thnx :)
12.54.34 Part    HMetal
12.54.44 #       <Ogge> copy the script to amirc:rexx/
12.54.54 #       <Rocambole> k
12.55.08 #       <Ogge> then set the alias with /alias mail /rx mailchecker.amirx %p
12.55.16 #       <Ogge> start the script with /mail start
12.55.19 #       <Arvid> got to go
12.55.22 Quit    Arvid (:Exciting? ME?)
12.56.55 #       <Ogge> keep the ' in the script.. they r needed for the script to work correctly.. like this 'mail.home.no'
12.57.05 #       <Ogge> if the mailserver is named mail.home.no
12.57.21 #       <Rocambole> :)
12.57.40 #       <Ogge> tried it already?
12.57.54 #       <Rocambole> no, just reading in the script
12.57.59 #       <Ogge> ah ok.. 
12.58.21 #       <Rocambole> dopus is great :)
12.58.26 #       <Ogge> the post office protocol (pop) version 3 is a really simple protocol.. 
12.58.33 #       <Ogge> yeah i know :)
13.00.00 #       <Ogge> so what do u think? should i release it to aminet??
13.00.56 #       <Ogge> Gemini wanted a gui to go with it but i don't know.. 
13.01.39 #       <Rocambole> could be nic with a gui for the lazy ones :)
13.02.13 #       <Ogge> hehe.. yeah if i fix the configfile i could implement a small rexxreqtools gui ;)
13.02.28 #       <Rocambole> I think you should put it on Aminet
13.03.13 #       <Ogge> :) many seems to run yam iconified.. i'm running this script til i get mail ;) only cz i have amirc open everytime i'm on.. 
13.03.26 #       <Rocambole> :)
13.03.58 #       <Rocambole> well, I'm using connect thor to get amils and news :)
13.04.06 #       <Rocambole> emails
13.04.52 #       <Ogge> ok.. then this script is sure needed instead of running connect thor everythime u want to check ur mailbox ;)
13.05.20 #       <Rocambole> :)
13.07.11 #       <Ogge> and i'll change the scripts so if u have the same amount of mail the second time u check it will not show the message to you.. now it can be annoying getting the message about mail every n:th minute.. 
13.07.23 #       <Ogge> abd maybe i'll add a sound to it too.. 
13.07.59 #       <Rocambole> yes, a ping every time a new email arrives :)
13.08.12 #       <Ogge> yep.. 
13.08.14 #       <Rocambole> or a swoosh sound :)
13.08.20 #       <Ogge> so have u tried the script yet?
13.08.32 #       <Ogge> i have a great "You have new mail" sound ;)
13.08.37 #       <Rocambole> no, have to edit first
13.09.18 #       <Ogge> i might use this sound ;)
13.09.25 #       <Rocambole> ok, thanx :)
13.11.26 #       <Rocambole> you should put your name at the top of the script ;)
13.12.25 #       <Ogge> yeah i will... this is only a small beta script ;) but i need some more ppl than me to test it.. have to find bugs ;) if there r any..

15.24.09 #       <pekr> heh, interesting mail at Power-Up ML - some folk just got two A4K machines, revision B and D, updated flashrom on his CBSPPC and one computer can't even boot, while the second runs without probs ...aaahhh, such power-ups ....
15.24.56 #       * StG^sNTx switches back into his old adult self
15.25.15 #       <[X_MaN]> STG:who is interviewing fleecy?
15.25.16 #       <Cryto> I have a friend with an A4k desktop, with rev D MB.  They have the 030 right on the MB on those.  Small enough that it can fit into a tower..  Just need to do something with the daughter board..
15.26.00 #       <[X_MaN]> Cryto:Amiga is damned shit motherboard design, it can only be desktop:( 
15.26.23 #       <StG^sNTx> [X_MaN]: u mean who asked q's at the session here, or for the last cu-issue?:)
15.26.35 #       <Cryto> [X_MaN]: This one looked good..  Was about the same size as my 486 MB.  Its only problem was the daughterboard..
15.26.46 #       <pekr> Now I am confused, - is Siamese PCI card to be probably used at PC/Amiga dev. system exactly the same provided by Access(Inside Out)?
15.26.51 #       <[X_MaN]> Cryto:yeah its a pain
15.27.29 #       <[X_MaN]> pekr:I would say so yes, brb lemme check on the ICOA lists
15.28.04 #       <pekr> ICOA, - it's said the main ("public") list is sooo quiet
15.28.37 #       <[X_MaN]> well what is to be said on the list now
15.28.37 #       <pekr> said=sad
15.29.27 #       <Tarasd> how much is the ICOA having input into AmigaNG?
15.29.30 #       <pekr> yes, but I think there are separate MLs now, the public one is still here because of press-people ranting, so me for e.g. :-)

15.36.59 #       <[X_MaN]> Tarasd:hehe I think the nature of the ICOA will change before the year is up, things are looking to get very secret, and if fleecy is really correct in his assumptions, I would say things are going to get VRY secret
15.38.02 #       <Tarasd> true
15.38.15 #       <pekr> so, you should perform some checks, what about if Yoshi2 is Billy Gates in real? :-)
15.38.39 #       <Yoshi2> pekr: BG wouldn't bother about his modem being online too long :)
15.38.47 #       <pekr> Fleecy's comments in c.s.a.m are great ....

15.46.05 #       <[X_MaN]> Yoshi:the MMC is just a company with a new product, that at least 5 others will have clones of simultaneously

15.46.18 #       <[X_MaN]> Cryto:why?
15.46.22 #       <Yoshi2> [X_MaN]: if not sooner... :(
15.47.31 #       <Tarasd> that may be true, what matters is what they DO WITH IT 
15.47.47 #       <Yoshi2> Tarasd: And that's the thing that worries me most :))
15.48.03 #       <Tarasd> and how they market it
15.48.18 #       <[X_MaN]> Yoshi:hehe I think so too, but I don`t want to keep being a downer
15.48.19 #       <Yoshi2> Tarasd: What they do with it, or rather what they will not do with it...
15.48.30 #       <pekr> yea, wait, but shouldn't be AOS5.x an OASYS, so it will run even without MMC let's say on PPC altivec?
15.48.35 #       <Cryto> [X_MaN]: I dunno why it died, it just did. :)
15.48.40 #       <Yoshi2> [X_MaN]: I used to be optimistic, but things have changed...
15.49.03 #       <[X_MaN]> pekr:hehe an Oasys fan huh
15.50.09 #       <Tarasd> long term MS will probably get split up into 2 companies
15.50.10 #       <pekr> it's fleecy's project and he is at AInc. :-)
15.50.16 #       <Cryto> Ok, I think we need to start an Asha Monitor Fix fund.... :)
15.50.30 #       <Tarasd> lol
15.51.38 #       <[X_MaN]> pekr:yes but it is not going to be used
15.52.45 #       <pekr> so, the OS 5 is going to be some hw dependand once again? I've thought you can add external processor at least and then I don't care if MMC is used for gfx only for e.g.
15.53.29 #       <[X_MaN]> pekr:well to be honest, I dont see the OS as being single cpu only
15.54.06 #       <[X_MaN]> fleecy is a netowrk CPU man, and he is very interested in pursuing that from what I have seen him say
15.57.27 #       <Tarasd> part of me is worried by upgrades or the lack it (like in the past)

16.19.22 #       <[X_MaN]> hesido yes
16.19.59 #       <[X_MaN]> Dave:it mounts the PC as a remote machine, u can see it through shell or whatever, however u MUST use the Amiga to control the networking
16.20.00 #       <hesido> I got a problem
16.20.18 #       <Dave_C> work w/ GVP IOx?

16.21.29 #       <[X_MaN]> Dave:speed my fr4iend, and also it multitasks properly, the serial version kills the cpu
16.21.42 #       <hesido> it is almost evident that it is caused by a bad mui library
16.21.50 #       <Tarasd> hesido: how many mb have u got? 
16.21.53 #       <Yoshi2> hesido: are you using MCP or some other patches?

16.28.23 #       <[X_MaN]> Philbo:nah, I love M$ manners, they are brilliant.  I just hate what it means to be against M$:)
16.30.13 #       <hesido> xman: it should not be a datatype problem. from a clean boot even when no datatype installed, hits hit. (and snooping them gives no clue about a datatype being loaded, if I remember well.)

18.07.51 Nick    Agima is now known as AgAFK (Agima@p1.nas1.is2.u-net.net)
18.10.28 #       <Arvid> hesido: .. he was six months old, once.  But we got a first home comuter in 1979, and his course of life was then set.  He is a 'senior engineer'   at    altavista.digital.com
18.11.53 #       <hesido> arvid: that is really cool! please tell him he assures pages are Voyager compatible :) if that is amongst his duties
18.12.12 #       <Tarasd> Arvid cool
18.13.33 #       <Arvid> hesido: no he does not do the design of the pages .. he just keeps the big fast Alphas  going ... 
18.14.30 #       <Arvid> hesido: he tells me that only about 8 or 10 people work in the altavista building in Palo Alto ... so he gets to talk to the page designers every day
18.14.44 #       * hesido 's page is submitted to altavista, and just that :)
18.15.47 #       <Arvid> hesido .. you know (or maybe you don't )   altavista keeps about six copies of the WWW on their own machines
18.16.23 #       <hesido> that sounds interesting... nut why that much? 
18.16.26 #       <hesido> but not nut :)
18.17.03 #       <Arvid> hesido: so lookup is quicker.  altavista gets about 800 hits a second from folks looking up stuff
18.19.00 #       <Arvid> he told me a few weeks ago they will probably keep eight copies of WWW by the end of summer, as they get toward 200-million pages indexed
18.20.20 #       <hesido> arv: is he allowed to play games on it? :) well, the other  servers left behind would still be sufficient :)
18.21.35 #       <Arvid> hesido: he writes stuff .. utilities and such .. he wrote one program to list the top 100 or so search terms .... the top three never change.    Always users are searching for free  sex  nude
18.21.56 #       <hesido> lol
18.22.13 #       <hesido> well I have contributed to that :)
18.22.18 #       <Arvid> heh
18.22.46 #       <Tarasd> lol
18.22.49 #       <hesido> top 3 I mean, not the utility :)
18.22.50 #       <Tarasd> so have most men
18.22.52 #       <Arvid> If I remember correctly .... altavista now has about 40-terabytes of hard drive storage on line
18.23.04 #       <Tarasd> YIKES   
18.23.20 #       <hesido> <-- hesido has only 1 mb left on both his drives.
18.23.54 #       <Arvid> <-- uses only about 250 meg of the about 900 meg I have on the A3000
18.24.25 #       <hesido> <-- bangs head against walls after hearing that!
18.24.27 #       <hesido> I gotta go ppl.

18.28.45 #       <Arvid> by now they should all be upgraded to 500 Mhz

18.38.27 #       <Tarasd>  but with the 060 and ppc  boards around u would have thought otherwise
18.39.29 #       <Arvid> Seems like it, but I suspect most of the 060/ppc stuff is made for the A1200

18.42.02 #       <Tarasd> Arvid tells your son could alta vista group all pages from the same web site together 
18.42.53 #       <Arvid> tarasd: lots of luck, the way they are indexed determines how that works .. and that is up to the very fancy indexing program written by the guy who thought it all up
18.43.55 #       <Tarasd> cos some ppl sumit EVERY page of their site to alta vista its anoying
18.44.55 #       <Arvid> Tarasd: some people have programs which detect the altavista web crawler (scooter) and blow a whole dictionary at scooter ... so their sits will be indexed under any and all words
18.45.17 #       <Arvid> sites
18.45.29 #       <Tarasd> bummer
18.46.36 #       <Arvid> Tarasd: some weeks ago I did a successful search .. used the words quantum scsi termination resistor and I got it down to 33 hits .. and with those search terms, only three of the hits were adult sites
18.47.17 #       <Tarasd> lol
18.47.44 #       <Tarasd> but alta vista is plauged by sex sites
18.48.04 #       <Arvid> so my final search was    +"quantum" +"scsi" +"termination" +"resistor" -"adult"
18.48.29 #       <Arvid> and I finally found what I needed
18.48.29 #       <Merko> "-adult" hmm.. good idea. :)
18.48.53 #       <Tarasd> lol
18.49.29 #       <Merko> You mean that there are actually sex sites with "quantum scsi termination resistor" in there just to make people visit them?
18.49.35 #       <Tarasd> why AV limited 200 pages per search?
18.49.47 #       <Kinners> The transcript of the discussion with Fleecy Moss is at http://www.amigauni.u-net.com/news/200898-1.html - perhaps someone should change the topic and put that link in it?
18.50.11 #       <Arvid> Merko: I'll repeat an earlier line ..........
18.50.20 #       <Arvid> Tarasd: some people have programs which detect the altavista web crawler (scooter) and blow a whole dictionary at scooter ... so their sits will be indexed under any and all words
18.50.59 #       <Arvid> Tarasd: they figure that 200 is a nice round number .. and you can tighten your search toreduce it even more
18.51.24 #       <Merko> Arvid: Ah.. hmmm, maybe they just have a semi-hidden page with a dictionary on.. would do equally well, spiders are stuupid.
18.52.25 #       <Arvid> Merko: they have looked at the sites which to it .. and they are waiting for the web crawlers to hit ... ordinary hits don't get the dictionary
18.53.12 #       <Arvid> Merko: I don't know if they have done it yet, but altavista was going to move scooter to a privately owned ISP so the return address would not show up as altavista

19.04.25 #       <Miracle> i didn`t know the Palm Pilot used the 68000 chip
19.04.42 #       <Tarasd> thought it used x86
19.05.00 #       <Arvid> Actually it is a 68382 ... a 68000 with a lot of I/O stuff built into the cpu
19.06.43 #       <Miracle> those paml pilots r pretty cool :)
19.07.22 #       <Arvid> Miracle :  it is not an Amiga, but it is so much like an Amiga, and the attitude of Palm users is so Amiga-like, it is really interesting
19.07.55 #       <Miracle> i only used it once for2  mins
19.08.22 #       <Arvid> Similar programs for the Windows CE machines take about 5 to 6 times as much memory as on the Palm

19.42.43 #       <Miracle> if ya get a UDMA controller and HD that shoots as well

19.44.44 #       <Miracle> im not really into the tech side of amiga things
19.45.10 #       <Miracle> but UDMA will be double the speed of EIDE roughly

19.47.08 #       <Miracle> Im tech for PC company so i only research them

19.52.21 #       <Miracle> and if it`s to do that.......
19.52.35 #       <Miracle> it`s not gonna be a Amiga as we all know and love it
19.52.55 #       <Miracle> so research into current dated line is pointless
19.53.02 #       <Tarasd> in what way?
19.53.14 #       <Miracle> it wil be a Amiga by name only really with a fw things carried forward
19.53.41 #       <Tarasd> alot of the os fetures will be updated
19.54.23 #       <Tarasd> the look of the gui will change but the feel won't i guess
19.55.31 #       <Tarasd> things like rexx will  stay
19.56.29 #       <Miracle> we`ll see
19.56.43 #       <Miracle> but MS need stopling and it`s hard to say what wil do it....
19.57.05 #       <Miracle> Apple always been better yet it`s stil only gotlike 14%ish of market
19.57.39 #       <Tarasd> cos of marketing
19.57.58 #       <Tarasd> ms will self implode

20.39.25 #       <Tarasd> cool
20.40.07 Quit    Dave_C (:Ping timeout for Dave_C[host226.internettport.net])
20.40.16 #       <TA> There won't be much lead time usually. They will just pop in and ask if we have questions or drop in.
20.41.40 #       <Jamesc> Pity :( .. Still.. I'm usually online :)
20.42.38 #       <TA> They want to limit the numbers that will try to overwhelm them. I think it scares them that they may screw up if they aren't careful.
20.43.27 #       <Jamesc> Well we definitely don't want any stuffups .. But we the faithful are fascinated to know what's happening :)
20.43.49 #       <Tarasd> yeah no ms ppl
20.43.50 #       <Jamesc> And I as a developer most definitely want to make sure that I am as ready as can be...
20.44.31 #       <TA> That is why they have agreed to come here. I have assured them that the help channel will cooperate with them rather than trying to twist what they say.
20.44.57 #       <Jamesc> Amen. :)
20.45.19 #       <Tarasd> i second that
20.45.25 #       <Jamesc> I for one definitely want to do all I can to help, and the vast resources of my system are at their disposal.
20.45.28 #       <TA> So many are twisting everything out of joint that the message gets out of sync with what they are really saying.
20.45.54 #       <TA> so, they have agreed to come here and tell the news so we can go out and tell the truth for them.
20.46.27 #       <Jamesc> Have you got that "Offical" word on Joe on that site address too TA?
20.47.34 #       <TA> No, I will put that up this weekend.
20.57.14 #       <Jamesc> Good. I've fielded a few of those questions to, and can never remember the _exact_ quote :)
20.57.46 #       <Tarasd> lol
20.57.59 #       <TA> we may even move the pages to another, better spot soon.
20.58.11 #       <TA> or at least mirrir them.
20.59.19 #       <Jamesc> Well I am quite willing to set up a virtual server for them for you.. I don't know if I can run virtuals under AWS, But can on one of the other servers here..
20.59.34 #       <TA> in the uk?
20.59.34 #       <Jamesc> I am in Australia of course :) We count too don't we! :)

21.00.39 #       <Jamesc> I wonder if Ray is going to develop a web server for CNet? 
21.01.31 #       <Jamesc> We run oz.beyondirc.net if you didn't realise that by the way TA...

21.04.56 #       * TA bows to the wizard of oz!
21.05.00 #       <Jamesc> I could host it on any one of them, BUT, it would be good for making a point if I could host it on the Amiga hey ...
