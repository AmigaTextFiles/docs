11.13.49 #       <alanwall> BillM:did you make it to AmiWest with Bob
11.14.28 #       <BillM> Alan: No, sorry. I wish I could have. I would have popped down to Vacaville to visit some friends there.
11.14.59 #       <alanwall> BillM:Charlie Manson?
11.15.12 #       <BillM> Alan: I'm doing a book of poetry with an artist that lives there. Her husband is an Amiga freak. :)
11.16.21 #       <alanwall> BillM:did he make it,I know a few from there did but was so busy never got to meet them-The Manson thing is a local joke
11.16.39 #       <BillM> Alan: Her name's Wendy Vig. I could send you a JPEG of one of her pics.
11.16.47 #       <Kyoto> Anyone using a CsMkII?
11.17.12 #       <BillM> I'm stuck on 68030 on both machines.
11.17.21 #       <alanwall> back in 1
11.17.36 #       <Kyle> Sorry, Dave_C, I was there during the session and my hard drive is getting quite full :/
11.18.07 #       <Kyoto> I have been running my CsMkII in an A4000T at 60Mhz for four weeks now without a hitch.
11.18.30 #       <BillM> kyoto: is that an 040 or an 060?
11.18.31 #       <Rocambole> Kyoto: not me
11.18.50 #       <Kyoto> BillM:Sorry, 060
11.19.22 #       <BillM> kyoto: whew!!! Those 040's could cook bakon already! :)
11.19.34 #       <BillM> kyoto: whew!!! Those 040's could cook bacon already! :)
11.19.45 #       <Kyoto> BillM:Yes, I don't recommend overclocking 040's at all.
11.19.49 #       <Kyle> hmm
11.19.53 #       <Kyle> Im running my 060 at 50mhz and it feels very hot as it
11.20.18 #       <BillM> Kyle: what's the design speed?
11.20.18 #       <Kyle> Im running my 060 at 50mhz and it feels very hot as it is
11.20.21 #       <Kyoto> Kyle:It should be running cooler than an 040 or an 030
11.20.51 #       <Kyoto> I have a CPU fan on the 060 but that is there simply out of caution.
11.21.03 #       <Kyoto> Looks cute too :)
11.21.16 #       <BillM> Kyle: what's the design speed? Are you overclocking at 50MHz?
11.21.56 #       <Kyle> I never overclocked it, just wondering if my 060 chip can cope being overclocked.
11.22.01 #       <Kyoto> BillM:I have overclocked from 50Mhz to 60Mhz. My 060 is an "XC68060RC50".
11.22.02 #       <Kyle> it's not revision A
11.22.08 #       <Kyle> XC68060RC50
11.22.46 #       <BillM> Kyle: It shouldn't be running that hot, then. Are you in an A1200 or an A4000?
11.22.50 #       <Kyoto> "a" 060's are out now?
11.23.17 #       <Kyle> A1200
11.23.33 #       <Kyle> but it is hot even without the cover on it.  must be the psu.
11.23.34 Quit    BillM (:Demo timeout)

11.24.28 #       <Kyoto> Hi BillM
11.24.35 #       <Kyle> Kyle: possible to overclock it to 70mhz?
11.24.44 #       <Kyle> Kyoto even
11.24.46 #       <Kyoto> Sorry, wrong button
11.24.49 #       <alanwall> BillM:could u send again was away
11.24.50 #       <BillM> I've *got* to get this thing registered! :)
11.25.26 #       <BillM> Alan: Here it comes!
11.26.07 #       <BillM> Alan: This is called Nature's Concert after the poem of mine that inspired the original watercolor.
11.26.07 #       <Kyoto> Kyle:I wouldn't go to 70Mhz. I went as far as 66.6Mhz and it ran OK. 60Mhz suits me fine for the moment.
11.26.50 #       <alanwall> Kyoto:read some where u can only clock t066.6
11.28.26 #       <Kyoto> alanwall:My whole system is stable, not a hiccup at 60Mhz. Might be due to being an A4000T though. Hard to say.
11.28.28 #       <Kyle> Kyoto: hmm
11.28.52 #       <Kyle> It was a bloody nightmare fitting the 060 into my keyboard A1200
11.29.04 #       <alanwall> Kyoto:I had the mkII for 4 montha and 1 nite it died and took the hd with it
11.29.30 #       <Kyle> what did it do to the hd?!?
11.29.35 #       <BillM> Kyle: That's why your chip is running hot. No room to breathe.
11.30.12 #       <alanwall> Kyle:started runing VERY hot with lot of errors
11.30.26 #       <Kyoto> Kyle:If your oscillator is socketed then it is quite easy. You will either have a square or rectangular oscillator. Buy one of the same shape in 55Mhz, 60Mhz and/or 66Mhz. Note the alignmnet of the "dot" on the oscillator and plug it in. That's all there is to it.

15.00.09 #       <gio> Ooops! Glossy printmags are expensive to produce, need wide subscription lists & advertizing, particularly difficult to compete with instant online news. Good for in depth featues though. I bet people were brought down about it...

15.10.54 #       <[Gemini]> once again.... wb Pondus :-)
15.11.38 #       <gio> "Strategic PR" consists of sneaking up on market. Needs ideas..If one were to start a proper "guerilla" campaign, it could be done, but then one must be absolutely certain the "machinery" DOES work...
15.12.38 #       <gio> I guess that's why Bill Mcxxxyy wants a "low profile"...
15.14.08 #       <Worzel> gio: especially with the non-acceptance of win98 in some large company networks
15.14.11 #       <[Gemini]> but still... PR costs money, and where should AI advertise?? In what country and what media should they use?
15.15.08 #       <[Gemini]> make that country(s) and mesia(s)
15.16.14 #       <Worzel> [Gemini]: europe has always been their strongest market
15.16.50 #       <[Gemini]> but europe is BIG, with many countrys.... But of courz, england, germany, france and scandinavia would b a good start
15.17.14 #       <Worzel> [Gemini]: I reckon so

15.19.27 #       <gio> Gemini: we said that, no use adv. now. However, what I would do, is to create a test "3rd party endorsement" model (let users, programmers, outside people etc. praise the platform word-of-mouth style) by designing very integrated, interactive community... 
15.20.33 #       <[Gemini]> well... that sounds good enough.... but i doubt the amiga comunety is big enough 4 that
15.21.29 #       <[Gemini]> i personaly praise the amiga whenever i get a chance, but it dossent seem 2 have any effect :-)
15.23.34 #       <gio> Amiga community (such as it is) would provide "model" which then need to be spread to new people interested in new business cultures as well as technoligy. Business is changing very rapidly now, take a peep at http://www.fastcompany.com, online version of "new economy" magazine.
15.26.53 #       <[Gemini]> but is there any point in doing this b4 the we get somewhat closer 2 the release of the new amigas?

16.07.12 #       <Dave_C> it's just that the A/V drivers will be limited
16.07.28 #       <Dave_C> So I'm waiting for Fleecy to mail me and tell me which ones to get
16.07.50 #       <alanwall> so u are trying to match their video specs
16.07.52 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Yeah, the vibrations will make you fall off your chair at regular intervals and the spin-down will cause hickups when playing games. ;D
16.07.54 #       <Dave_C> Merko: Already been chatting w/ Fleecy about it
16.08.42 #       <alanwall> dave did u use an amd or ibm cpu?
16.08.44 #       <Dave_C> The main limitation will be that they will only support a limited number of A/V cards.
16.08.53 #       <Merko> Dave_C: Me too. He did mention that only one or two graphics cards will be supported, but I don't expect this to be different with other hardware requring drivers..

16.12.21 #       <Dave_C> sounds like a HD spindel about to go ballistic
16.13.17 #       <alanwall> has happened in the past but always went away-this time when I turned back on after 4 hrs still there so let it run its cource and noe quite
16.14.01 #       <Dave_C> When I hear something like that, I start worrying about my HD's, as one is REALLY old
16.14.24 #       <Dave_C> and the CSA Magnum csascsi.device is partially accessed from the RDB
16.14.37 #       <Dave_C> part of its boot system
16.14.41 #       <alanwall> this  while it was in sleep mode so the hd should not have been  spinning
16.14.52 #       <Dave_C> and the old drive it the ONLY one that has that code on it.
16.15.01 #       <Dave_C> I lose that drive and I'm SOL
16.15.24 #       <Dave_C> wire hitting a fan maybe?
