<p>First things first --- where will your AmigaOS installation live?</p>

<p>Let's assume from now on that you have an MBR partitioned disk to boot
Amithlon from, which is called disk1...</p>
<ul>
  <li> The easiest way is to have _another_ disk, disk2, which you will
    partition under AmigaOS, using the Rigid Disk Block scheme. This 
    can be a disk currently connected to a "real" Amiga, and it may
    be a disk connected to any of your supported controllers (i.e.
    it's perfectly alright for it to be a SCSI disk). If you go with
    this option, you can move on to the next section.</li>
  
  <li> If you want to (or have to) use just one disk, then you need to
    create a "Virtual Disk" for AmigaOS. Such a virtual disk is a
    partition on the MBR-partitioned drive that has a special type.
    The space in that partition will be presented to AmigaOS as a whole
    hard disk of its own, which you can then partition with the HDToolBox
    under AmigaOS.</li>
    
  <li> Theoretically, you could make AmigaOS use your FAT partition with the
    builtin FAT support of Amithlon. I would strongly advise against doing
    so, and in fact, in Amithlon 1.0.1, this option is unfortunately(?)
    broken.... So I won't actually describe how to do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, you need to ask yourself whether you want to just make Amithlon boot
from the hard disk, but other than that, give the whole disk over to AmigaOS,
or whether you actually want to use a different OS as well. In the first
case, you will only need a very small (~10MB) boot partition, and can give
the whole rest of the disk over to your virtual drive. In the case where you
want to really use different OSs, you will need to work out how much space
to dedicate to each.</p>

<p>Partitions that can be used as Virtual Drives have the type $76 hex, or
118 decimal. </p>

<p><font size="+1"><strong>[Re]partitioning your hard disk</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>***WARNING*** If you repartition your drive, be absolutely sure you have
backups of all important data! Even if a program claims it will repartition
without data loss, do NOT trust it! Backups are cheap, your data is valuable!</strong></p>

<p>You can use any program you like to create and change partitions. However,
at least most of the Microsoft FDISK programs cannot actually set the 
partition type explicitly. </p>

<p>We recommend using the linux based boot floppy provided 
<a href="amithlon_boot.shtml">here</a> on www.amithlon.net,
which in turn was created from 
 <ul> 
    <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/recovery/ramf-111.exe"> http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/recovery/ramf-111.exe</a>
 </ul>

</p>
<p>This will let you boot into a usable system with a fully working linux
fdisk from a single floppy. Just write it to a floppy, boot from it,
follow the instructions until you get a command prompt, and then
"fdisk /dev/hda" (replace "hda" with "hdb" if your boot hard drive is
the primary IDE slave, with "hdc" if it is secondary master, "hdd" for
secondary slave, and "sda" if it is the first SCSI hard disk).</p>

<p>You will get a command prompt saying "Command (m for help):". At that prompt
type 'p' to Print your current partitions. If the output is empty, great.
If it isn't, oh well, use 'd' to delete the existing partitions one by one.
You probably want to start with a clean slate.....</p>

<p>Once you have an empty partition table, start adding partitions by entering
'n' (for New). Where it asks whether you want primary or secondary, say
'p' for primary (unless you need more than 4, at which point you probably
know more about fdisk than I can put into this text, anyway). Make partition
number 1 the boot partition (i.e. with the OS of your choice to boot from ---
if you don't know, read section 4 first!). Start it at cylinder 1, and as
the size give however much you want to spend on it (i.e. "+10M" if you want
10 megabytes, or "+4096M" if you want 4 gigabytes).</p>

<p>Next, add any further partitions you might need for your OS (e.g. in linux,
you might want a swap partition, or a /usr/local partition, or...), always
starting at the lowest possible cylinder, and always giving the size as
before.</p>

<p>Lastly, add what will become the virtual drive for Amithlon. Create a new
partition with 'n', starting at the lowest possible cylinder. When fdisk
asks for "Last cylinder", simply hit return (which will use the default, which
is the highest possible cylinder).</p>

<p>Next, you need to activate the first partition, so that it may be booted
from. Enter 'a', and then give '1' as the partition number.</p>

<p>Last but not least, you need to set the partition types. For each partition
you defined, enter 't', then its number. You will then be asked for a hex code
of the partition type. You can enter 'l' to list a whole bunch of known types.
For partitions that are to hold Windows or DOS of some kind, you should
probably use type "0c" or "0b" (depending on whether your BIOS supports LBA
or not --- it probably does, so try "0c" first). For partitions that will
hold linux, use the appropriate types (82 for swap, 83 for ext2fs).</p>

<p>For the last partition, the one that is to hold the virtual drive, use type
"76" (this will show up as "unknown", that's OK).</p>

<p>Once you have all that, enter 'p' again and check that everything looks all
right. If it does, use 'w' to write back the partition table to disk.</p>

<p>You should now be able to boot Amithlon from CD and see the virtual drive
in the HDToolBox, with a drive name starting with "VirtDsk" and a non-zero
LUN. Hope it worked :)</p>
