So now you have Amithlon booting from the HD. Great! But of course you
are wondering what all those gibberish pieces of text are about that 
you had to put into the various config files....


They are kernel command line options. Some of them you might actually
want to change. Here is a list:



           init=/linuxrc          
    
    
	Don't change this one, it is needed for Amithlon to start
    

           console_level=0        
    
    Set this to 4 (instead of 0), and the
                                  boing ball will no longer bounce, but rather
                                  sit in the top left corner, and you will 
                                  get kernel and emulator messages during
                                  startup. Do this if things fail to start!
    
 
           root=/dev/ram0         
    
    Leave this as it is. Amithlon needs it like this
    

           ramdisk_size=12010
    
         Leave this as it is (or use 2310 if using smallird.gz)
    

           leavepages=7400
            Don't(!) reduce this number. You might want
                                  to increase it to give Amithlon more memory
                                  for disk caching (only read-caching, no
                                  write caching, so it's safe!). Each page
                                  stands for 4k; If you increase the number
                                  by 1024, you are adding 4MB of disk cache
                                  (but take 4MB away from the Amiga). Reducing
                                  the number below the values given will result
                                  in weird and hard to track hangs!
    

           vga=769
    
                    Only used if you are using the VESA driver
                                  for graphics support. In that case, this
                                  decides the one (and only) mode you will
                                  have available. See the following table
                                  for the meaning of the numbers:
    
     
        640x480
        800x600
        1024x768
        1280x1024
    256  
        769
        771
        773
        775 
    64k
	785
	788
	791
	794
    16M
        786
	789
	792
	795
    
    




If you are using the setconfig options in your startup sequence (e.g. to set
cachesize, or monitor frequencies), you can also put those onto the kernel
command line. The advantage is that those options are available before AmigaOS
starts up, and will thus not require a reboot to come into effect.
To set, for example, the cachesize to 16384kB from the kernel command line, 
simply add the option "cachesize=16384" after the "leavepages=xxxx" entry.
A word of warning, though --- the various boot loaders all have limits on
how long the kernel command line can be; So if it looks like your settings
didn't make it into Amithlon, check with "dumpconfig"... They might just have
been truncated.
