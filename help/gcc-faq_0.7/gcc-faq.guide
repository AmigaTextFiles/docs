have an answer or much of an answer.  However, on the whole, there is
still a lot of information here that could be of help to you.

The Amiga Developer's Environment (ADE)
=======================================

   Previously, ports of gcc and other free software (GNU and otherwise)
have been sporadic and lacking in overall organization.  The ADE
project is an attempt to remedy that by providing a central repository
(at `ftp.ninemoons.com') of all ADE packages, mailing lists for
developers, and a project list.  Furthermore, one of the goals of ADE
is to provide a completely self-hosting environment, i.e. all ADE
packages can be compiled by compilers included in ADE, in which a
developer can change his tools in whatever way he sees fit.

   	Cronus donates the space on `ftp.ninemoons.com' for the central
repository, under the direction of Fred Fish.  Snapshots are made once
every 2 or 3 months, depending on Fred's work load, and are a complete
rebuild of the entire ADE tree.  Phillipe Brand still maintains the net
releases of GCC, as the ADE snapshots can be on the bloody (through not
quite bleeding) edge of development.

   For more information on ADE, consult
`<ftp://ftp.ninemoons.com/pub/ade/README>'.  and
`<ftp://ftp.ninemoons.com/pub/ade/Projects>'.  I also try to maintain a
list of web sites related to ADE (and other free amiga software) at
`<http://nickel.ucs.indiana.edu/~owinebar/interests/amiga/amiga.html>',
which includes this FAQ.  For information on the ADE mailing lists,
consult the relevant section (in the chapter on Support).

The FSF, the GNU Project, and the GPL
=====================================

   The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is an institution dedicated to
the free flow of software.  To this end it has start the GNU (GNU's Not
Unix) project, a collection of widely portable software of all sorts
(compilers and Un*x utilities for the most part, but some other stuff
as well).  But I'm sure Richard Stallman, director and founder of the
FSF, can say it better than I:

GNU Manifesto
-------------

          			The GNU Manifesto
          
          Copyright (C) 1985 Richard M. Stallman
            (Copying permission notice at the end.)
          
          What's GNU?  Gnu's Not Unix!
          
          GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete
          Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it
          away free to everyone who can use it.  Several other volunteers are helping
          me.  Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly
          needed.
          
          So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor commands,
          a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, a linker, and
          around 35 utilities.  A shell (command interpreter) is nearly completed.  A
          new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled itself and may be released
          this year.  An initial kernel exists but many more features are needed to
          emulate Unix.  When the kernel and compiler are finished, it will be
          possible to distribute a GNU system suitable for program development.  We
          will use TeX as our text formatter, but an nroff is being worked on.  We
          will use the free, portable X window system as well.  After this we will
          add a portable Common Lisp, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of
          other things, plus on-line documentation.  We hope to supply, eventually,
          everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and more.
          
          GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix.
          We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience
          with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to have longer
          filenames, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, filename
          completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and perhaps
          eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp programs
          and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C and Lisp will be
          available as system programming languages.  We will try to support UUCP,
          MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for communication.
          
          GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class with virtual
          memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run on.  The extra
          effort to make it run on smaller machines will be left to someone who wants
          to use it on them.
          
          To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the `G' in the word `GNU'
          when it is the name of this project.
          
          
          Who Am I?
          
          I am Richard Stallman, inventor of the original much-imitated EMACS editor,
          formerly at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.  I have worked
          extensively on compilers, editors, debuggers, command interpreters, the
          Incompatible Timesharing System and the Lisp Machine operating system.  I
          pioneered terminal-independent display support in ITS.  Since then I have
          implemented one crashproof file system and two window systems for Lisp
          machines, and designed a third window system now being implemented; this
          one will be ported to many systems including use in GNU.  [Historical note:
          The window system project was not completed; GNU now plans to use the
          X window system.]
          
          
          Why I Must Write GNU
          
          I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must
          share it with other people who like it.  Software sellers want to divide
          the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with
          others.  I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way.  I
          cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software
          license agreement.  For years I worked within the Artificial Intelligence
          Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually
          they had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such
          things are done for me against my will.
          
          So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to
          put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to
          get along without any software that is not free.  I have resigned from the
          AI lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent me from giving GNU away.
          
          
          Why GNU Will Be Compatible with Unix
          
          Unix is not my ideal system, but it is not too bad.  The essential features
          of Unix seem to be good ones, and I think I can fill in what Unix lacks
          without spoiling them.  And a system compatible with Unix would be
          convenient for many other people to adopt.
          
          
          How GNU Will Be Available
          
          GNU is not in the public domain.  Everyone will be permitted to modify and
          redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its
          further redistribution.  That is to say, proprietary modifications will not
          be allowed.  I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free.
          
          
          Why Many Other Programmers Want to Help
          
          I have found many other programmers who are excited about GNU and want to
          help.
          
          Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of system
          software.  It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to
          feel in conflict with other programmers in general rather than feel as
          comrades.  The fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the
          sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now typically used essentially
          forbid programmers to treat others as friends.  The purchaser of software
          must choose between friendship and obeying the law.  Naturally, many decide
          that friendship is more important.  But those who believe in law often do
          not feel at ease with either choice.  They become cynical and think that
          programming is just a way of making money.
          
          By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs, we can be
          hospitable to everyone and obey the law.  In addition, GNU serves as an
          example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join us in sharing.
          This can give us a feeling of harmony which is impossible if we use
          software that is not free.  For about half the programmers I talk to, this
          is an important happiness that money cannot replace.
          
          
          How You Can Contribute
          
          I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines and money.
          I'm asking individuals for donations of programs and work.
          
          One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is that GNU will run
          on them at an early date.  The machines should be complete, ready to use
          systems, approved for use in a residential area, and not in need of
          sophisticated cooling or power.
          
          I have found very many programmers eager to contribute part-time work for
          GNU.  For most projects, such part-time distributed work would be very hard
          to coordinate; the independently-written parts would not work together.
          But for the particular task of replacing Unix, this problem is absent.  A
          complete Unix system contains hundreds of utility programs, each of which
          is documented separately.  Most interface specifications are fixed by Unix
          compatibility.  If each contributor can write a compatible replacement for
          a single Unix utility, and make it work properly in place of the original
          on a Unix system, then these utilities will work right when put together.
          Even allowing for Murphy to create a few unexpected problems, assembling
          these components will be a feasible task.  (The kernel will require closer
          communication and will be worked on by a small, tight group.)
          
          If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full or
          part time.  The salary won't be high by programmers' standards, but I'm
          looking for people for whom building community spirit is as important as
          making money.  I view this as a way of enabling dedicated people to devote
          their full energies to working on GNU by sparing them the need to make a
          living in another way.
          
          
          Why All Computer Users Will Benefit
          
          Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good system software
          free, just like air.
          
          This means much more than just saving everyone the price of a Unix license.
          It means that much wasteful duplication of system programming effort will
          be avoided.  This effort can go instead into advancing the state of the
          art.
          
          Complete system sources will be available to everyone.  As a result, a user
          who needs changes in the system will always be free to make them himself,
          or hire any available programmer or company to make them for him.  Users
          will no longer be at the mercy of one programmer or company which owns the
          sources and is in sole position to make changes.
          
          Schools will be able to provide a much more educational environment by
          encouraging all students to study and improve the system code.  Harvard's
          computer lab used to have the policy that no program could be installed on
          the system if its sources were not on public display, and upheld it by
          actually refusing to install certain programs.  I was very much inspired by
          this.
          
          Finally, the overhead of considering who owns the system software and what
          one is or is not entitled to do with it will be lifted.
          
          Arrangements to make people pay for using a program, including licensing of
          copies, always incur a tremendous cost to society through the cumbersome
          mechanisms necessary to figure out how much (that is, which programs) a
          person must pay for.  And only a police state can force everyone to obey
          them.  Consider a space station where air must be manufactured at great
          cost: charging each breather per liter of air may be fair, but wearing the
          metered gas mask all day and all night is intolerable even if everyone can
          afford to pay the air bill.  And the TV cameras everywhere to see if you
          ever take the mask off are outrageous.  It's better to support the air
          plant with a head tax and chuck the masks.
          
          Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as
          breathing, and as productive.  It ought to be as free.
          
          
          Some Easily Rebutted Objections to GNU's Goals
          
            "Nobody will use it if it is free, because that means
             they can't rely on any support."
            "You have to charge for the program
             to pay for providing the support."
          
          If people would rather pay for GNU plus service than get GNU free without
          service, a company to provide just service to people who have obtained GNU
          free ought to be profitable.
          
          We must distinguish between support in the form of real programming work
          and mere handholding.  The former is something one cannot rely on from a
          software vendor.  If your problem is not shared by enough people, the
          vendor will tell you to get lost.
          
          If your business needs to be able to rely on support, the only way is to
          have all the necessary sources and tools.  Then you can hire any available
          person to fix your problem; you are not at the mercy of any individual.
          With Unix, the price of sources puts this out of consideration for most
          businesses.  With GNU this will be easy.  It is still possible for there to
          be no available competent person, but this problem cannot be blamed on
          distribution arrangements.  GNU does not eliminate all the world's problems,
          only some of them.
          
          Meanwhile, the users who know nothing about computers need handholding:
          doing things for them which they could easily do themselves but don't know
          how.
          
          Such services could be provided by companies that sell just hand-holding
          and repair service.  If it is true that users would rather spend money and
          get a product with service, they will also be willing to buy the service
          having got the product free.  The service companies will compete in quality
          and price; users will not be tied to any particular one.  Meanwhile, those
          of us who don't need the service should be able to use the program without
          paying for the service.
          
            "You cannot reach many people without advertising,
             and you must charge for the program to support that."
            "It's no use advertising a program people can get free."
          
          There are various forms of free or very cheap publicity that can be used to
          inform numbers of computer users about something like GNU.  But it may be
          true that one can reach more microcomputer users with advertising.  If this
          is really so, a business which advertises the service of copying and
          mailing GNU for a fee ought to be successful enough to pay for its
          advertising and more.  This way, only the users who benefit from the
          advertising pay for it.
          
          On the other hand, if many people get GNU from their friends, and such
          companies don't succeed, this will show that advertising was not really
          necessary to spread GNU.  Why is it that free market advocates don't want
          to let the free market decide this?
          
            "My company needs a proprietary operating system
             to get a competitive edge."
          
          GNU will remove operating system software from the realm of competition.
          You will not be able to get an edge in this area, but neither will your
          competitors be able to get an edge over you.  You and they will compete in
          other areas, while benefitting mutually in this one.  If your business is
          selling an operating system, you will not like GNU, but that's tough on
          you.  If your business is something else, GNU can save you from being
          pushed into the expensive business of selling operating systems.
          
          I would like to see GNU development supported by gifts from many
          manufacturers and users, reducing the cost to each.
          
            "Don't programmers deserve a reward for their creativity?"
          
          If anything deserves a reward, it is social contribution.  Creativity can
          be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to use the
          results.  If programmers deserve to be rewarded for creating innovative
          programs, by the same token they deserve to be punished if they restrict
          the use of these programs.
          
            "Shouldn't a programmer be able to ask for a reward for his creativity?"
          
          There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to maximize
          one's income, as long as one does not use means that are destructive.  But
          the means customary in the field of software today are based on
          destruction.
          
          Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their use of it is
          destructive because the restrictions reduce the amount and the ways that
          the program can be used.  This reduces the amount of wealth that humanity
          derives from the program.  When there is a deliberate choice to restrict,
          the harmful consequences are deliberate destruction.
          
          The reason a good citizen does not use such destructive means to become
          wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all become poorer from the
          mutual destructiveness.  This is Kantian ethics; or, the Golden Rule.
          Since I do not like the consequences that result if everyone hoards
          information, I am required to consider it wrong for one to do so.
          Specifically, the desire to be rewarded for one's creativity does not
          justify depriving the world in general of all or part of that creativity.
          
            "Won't programmers starve?"
          
          I could answer that nobody is forced to be a programmer.  Most of us cannot
          manage to get any money for standing on the street and making faces.  But
          we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives standing on the
          street making faces, and starving.  We do something else.
          
          But that is the wrong answer because it accepts the questioner's implicit
          assumption: that without ownership of software, programmers cannot possibly
          be paid a cent.  Supposedly it is all or nothing.
          
          The real reason programmers will not starve is that it will still be
          possible for them to get paid for programming; just not paid as much as
          now.
          
          Restricting copying is not the only basis for business in software.  It is
          the most common basis because it brings in the most money.  If it were
          prohibited, or rejected by the customer, software business would move to
          other bases of organization which are now used less often.  There are
          always numerous ways to organize any kind of business.
          
          Probably programming will not be as lucrative on the new basis as it is
          now.  But that is not an argument against the change.  It is not considered
          an injustice that sales clerks make the salaries that they now do.  If
          programmers made the same, that would not be an injustice either.  (In
          practice they would still make considerably more than that.)
          
            "Don't people have a right to control how their creativity is used?"
          
          "Control over the use of one's ideas" really constitutes control over other
          people's lives; and it is usually used to make their lives more difficult.
          
          People who have studied the issue of intellectual property rights carefully
          (such as lawyers) say that there is no intrinsic right to intellectual
          property.  The kinds of supposed intellectual property rights that the
          government recognizes were created by specific acts of legislation for
          specific purposes.
          
          For example, the patent system was established to encourage inventors to
          disclose the details of their inventions.  Its purpose was to help society
          rather than to help inventors.  At the time, the life span of 17 years for
          a patent was short compared with the rate of advance of the state of the
          art.  Since patents are an issue only among manufacturers, for whom the
          cost and effort of a license agreement are small compared with setting up
          production, the patents often do not do much harm.  They do not obstruct
          most individuals who use patented products.
          
          The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when authors
          frequently copied other authors at length in works of non-fiction.  This
          practice was useful, and is the only way many authors' works have survived
          even in part.  The copyright system was created expressly for the purpose
          of encouraging authorship.  In the domain for which it was invented--books,
          which could be copied economically only on a printing press--it did little
          harm, and did not obstruct most of the individuals who read the books.
          
          All intellectual property rights are just licenses granted by society
          because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, that society as a whole would
          benefit by granting them.  But in any particular situation, we have to ask:
          are we really better off granting such license?  What kind of act are we
          licensing a person to do?
          
          The case of programs today is very different from that of books a hundred
          years ago.  The fact that the easiest way to copy a program is from one
          neighbor to another, the fact that a program has both source code and
          object code which are distinct, and the fact that a program is used rather
          than read and enjoyed, combine to create a situation in which a person who
          enforces a copyright is harming society as a whole both materially and
          spiritually; in which a person should not do so regardless of whether the
          law enables him to.
          
            "Competition makes things get done better."
          
          The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we
          encourage everyone to run faster.  When capitalism really works this way,
          it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it always works
          this way.  If the runners forget why the reward is offered and become
          intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other strategies--such as,
          attacking other runners.  If the runners get into a fist fight, they will
          all finish late.
          
          Proprietary and secret software is the moral equivalent of runners in a
          fist fight.  Sad to say, the only referee we've got does not seem to
          object to fights; he just regulates them ("For every ten yards you run, you
          are allowed one kick.").  He really ought to break them up, and penalize
          runners for even trying to fight.
          
            "Won't everyone stop programming without a monetary incentive?"
          
          Actually, many people will program with absolutely no monetary incentive.
          Programming has an irresistible fascination for some people, usually the
          people who are best at it.  There is no shortage of professional musicians
          who keep at it even though they have no hope of making a living that way.
          
          But really this question, though commonly asked, is not appropriate to the
          situation.  Pay for programmers will not disappear, only become less.  So
          the right question is, will anyone program with a reduced monetary
          incentive?  My experience shows that they will.
          
          For more than ten years, many of the world's best programmers worked at the
          Artificial Intelligence Lab for far less money than they could have had
          anywhere else.  They got many kinds of non-monetary rewards: fame and
          appreciation, for example.  And creativity is also fun, a reward in itself.
          
          Then most of them left when offered a chance to do the same interesting
          work for a lot of money.
          
          What the facts show is that people will program for reasons other than
          riches; but if given a chance to make a lot of money as well, they will
          come to expect and demand it.  Low-paying organizations do poorly in
          competition with high-paying ones, but they do not have to do badly if the
          high-paying ones are banned.
          
            "We need the programmers desperately.  If they demand that we
             stop helping our neighbors, we have to obey."
          
          You're never so desperate that you have to obey this sort of demand.
          Remember: millions for defense, but not a cent for tribute!
          
            "Programmers need to make a living somehow."
          
          In the short run, this is true.  However, there are plenty of ways that
          programmers could make a living without selling the right to use a program.
          This way is customary now because it brings programmers and businessmen the
          most money, not because it is the only way to make a living.  It is easy to
          find other ways if you want to find them.  Here are a number of examples.
          
          A manufacturer introducing a new computer will pay for the porting of
          operating systems onto the new hardware.
          
          The sale of teaching, hand-holding and maintenance services could also
          employ programmers.
          
          People with new ideas could distribute programs as freeware, asking for
          donations from satisfied users, or selling hand-holding services.  I have
          met people who are already working this way successfully.
          
          Users with related needs can form users' groups, and pay dues.  A group
          would contract with programming companies to write programs that the
          group's members would like to use.
          
          All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax:
          
           Suppose everyone who buys a computer has to pay x percent of
           the price as a software tax.  The government gives this to
           an agency like the NSF to spend on software development.
          
           But if the computer buyer makes a donation to software development
           himself, he can take a credit against the tax.  He can donate to
           the project of his own choosing--often, chosen because he hopes to
           use the results when it is done.  He can take a credit for any amount
           of donation up to the total tax he had to pay.
          
           The total tax rate could be decided by a vote of the payers of
           the tax, weighted according to the amount they will be taxed on.
          
           The consequences:
           * the computer-using community supports software development.
           * this community decides what level of support is needed.
           * users who care which projects their share is spent on
            can choose this for themselves.
          
          In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the post-scarcity
          world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living.
          People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun,
          such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week
          on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot
          repair and asteroid prospecting.  There will be no need to be able
          to make a living from programming.
          
          We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole
          society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this
          has translated itself into leisure for workers because much
          nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity.
          The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles
          against competition.  Free software will greatly reduce these
          drains in the area of software production.  We must do this,
          in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into
          less work for us.

The GPL
-------

   The GNU Public License (GPL) was written in order to keep software
published under it free.  Here's the Preamble of the GPL:
          		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          		       Version 2, June 1991
          
           Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                                    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
           Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
          
          			    Preamble
          
            The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
          freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
          License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
          software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
          General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
          Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
          using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
          the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
          your programs, too.
          
            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
          price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
          have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
          this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
          if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
          in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
          
            To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
          anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
          These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
          distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
          
            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
          gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
          you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
          source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
          rights.
          
            We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
          (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
          distribute and/or modify the software.
          
            Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
          that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
          software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
          want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
          that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
          authors' reputations.
          
            Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
          patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
          program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
          program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
          patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
          
            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
          modification follow.
          
          		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
             TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
          
            0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
          a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
          under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
          refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
          means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
          that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
          either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
          language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
          the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
          
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
          covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
          running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
          is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
          Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
          Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
          
            1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
          source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
          conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
          copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
          notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
          and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
          along with the Program.
          
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
          you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
          
            2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
          of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
          distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
          above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
          
              a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          
              b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
              whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
              part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
              parties under the terms of this License.
          
              c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
              when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
              interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
              announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
              notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
              a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
              these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
              License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
              does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
              the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
          identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
          and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
          themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
          sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
          distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
          on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
          this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
          entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
          
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
          your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
          exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
          collective works based on the Program.
          
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
          with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
          a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
          the scope of this License.
          
            3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
          under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
          
              a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
              source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
              1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          
              b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
              years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
              cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
              machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
              distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
              customarily used for software interchange; or,
          
              c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
              to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
              allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
              received the program in object code or executable form with such
              an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          
          The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
          code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
          associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
          control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
          special exception, the source code distributed need not include
          anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
          form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
          operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
          itself accompanies the executable.
          
          If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
          access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
          access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
          distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
          compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
          
            4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
          except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
          otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
          void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
          However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
          this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
          parties remain in full compliance.
          
            5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
          signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
          distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
          prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
          modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
          Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
          all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
          the Program or works based on it.
          
            6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
          Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
          original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
          these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
          restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
          You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
          this License.
          
            7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
          infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
          conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
          otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
          excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
          distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
          License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
          may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
          license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
          all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
          the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
          refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
          
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
          any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
          apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
          circumstances.
          
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
          patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
          such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
          integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
          implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
          generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
          through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
          system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
          to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
          impose that choice.
          
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
          be a consequence of the rest of this License.
          
            8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
          certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
          original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
          may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
          those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
          countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
          the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
          
            9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
          be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
          address new problems or concerns.
          
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
          specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
          later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
          either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
          Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
          this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
          Foundation.
          
            10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
          programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
          to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
          Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
          make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
          of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
          of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
          
          			    NO WARRANTY
          
            11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
          OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
          PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
          OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
          MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
          TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
          PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
          REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
          
            12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
          REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
          OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
          TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
          YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
          PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
          
          		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
          
          	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
          
            If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
          possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
          free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
          
            To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
          to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
          convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
          the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
          
              <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
              Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
          
              This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
              it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
              the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
              (at your option) any later version.
          
              This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
              but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
              MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
              GNU General Public License for more details.
          
              You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
              along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
              Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
          
          Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
          
          If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
          when it starts in an interactive mode:
          
              Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
              Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
              This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
              under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
          
          The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
          parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
          be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
          mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
          
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
          school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
          necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
          
            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
            `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

            Ty Coon, President of Vice
          
          This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
          proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
          consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
          library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
          Public License instead of this License.

   More information regarding the FSF, GNU, and the GPL can be obtained
at gnu.prep.mit.edu.  Note that the source code of any GPLed software
must be made available by the distributor.  The GPL may also affect how
you distribute your programs, or maybe not.  For more information,
check out Appendix A of this FAQ.  (Do this before believing all the
bad hype about it.  Then decide for yourself).

What GCC has to offer.
======================

   * A FREE C compiler, for starters.

   * It's available for a wide range of machines (and thus it can't be
     beat for cross-compiling, at least on the Amiga).

   * It's still actively supported.

   * For the interested, a chance to change it as you like, make your
     own       bug fixes, be an active part in the development process.

@Toc "General Introduction"

Hardware and Software Requirements
==================================

   This depends upon what you're doing, but here are some general
guidelines.

Systems
     Any Amiga (ranging from A1000 up to A4000/40, including CD-32 &
     SX-1) will run amigados-gnu utilities.

Memory
     A minimum of 4MB free memory is needed in order to compile
     small/medium projects.  More memory will be needed for large
     projects, such as recompiling gcc itself.  Gigamem is known to
     work with GCC so *maybe* less memory will work.  But in this case,
     you'll need an MMU equiped amiga (A3000,A4000/40, etc...).  VMM40
     (Public Domain Virtual memory manager) is also known to work with
     GCC.

     [Editor's note:  using the g++ compiler can require even more,
     like at 	least  6 MB of free RAM]

OS Version
     Starting from 2.6.3, 1.3 systems are not longer supported.  Gcc
     runs fine on all other systems, starting from 2.04 up to 3.1
     (40.68).

Disk Space
     An installation of gcc requires the use of a hard disk.
     Approximately 10MB is required at present to install the compiler
     and utilities required to use it.  In addition 3MB is required for
     the Commodore Developer Kit, which is required to be able to
     compile AmigaDOS specific programs. This kit is available direct
     from Commodore-Amiga.

     CD-ROM distributions sre generally configured to allow everything
     to be run off the CD-ROM, with a LOCAL: assign to point to
     modifications, third party development files, etc.

   Yes, it can take a lot of resources, but that's a function of its
portability.  Be glad you can count on having the same compiler on your
Amiga at home or the Unix system at work (or vice versa :-)).

Sources of the Amiga port of GCC
================================

   There are a couple of options for getting GCC.

Net Distribution
----------------

   If you have access to the Internet, and ftp service, you can obtain
the current version of GCC from Aminet, in dev/gcc.  The main site of
Aminet is <ftp.wustl.edu> in /pub/aminet, and has mirrors world-wide:
USA (MO)
     ftp.wustl.edu

USA (WI)
     ftp.netnet.net

USA (TX)
     ftp.etsu.edu

Scandinavia
     ftp.luth.se

Switzerland
     ftp.eunet.ch

Switzerland
     ftp.math.ethz.ch

Germany
     kelly.uni-paderborn.de

Germany
     ftp.uni-paderborn.de

Germany
     ftp.uni-stuttgart.de

Germany
     ftp.uni-erlangen.de

Germany
     ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de

Germany
     ftp.tu-chemnitz.de

Germany
     ftp.fh-augsburg.de

Germany
     ftp.uni-bremen.de

Germany
     ftp.uni-kl.de

Germany
     ftp.uni-trier.de

Germany
     ftp.informatik.rwth-aach

France
     ftp.cnam.fr

Portugal
     ftp.ci.ua.pt

UK
     ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk

UK
     micros.hensa.ac.uk

   `<ftp://ftp.funet.fi>' also serves to act as a hub for porting GNU
software to the Amiga, and serves to mirror Phillipe Brand's Amiga GCC
tree directly, so that you may always find GCC there (particularly to
guarantee the availability of source code).

ADE distribution
----------------

   `<ftp://ftp.ninemoons.com>' also carries a distribution of gcc
binaries and source.  They will generally be more up to date than the
latest Aminet distribution. Make sure you check in the Breakdown of the
Distribution for which files you should get.

   The ADE ftp tree can be found at the following locations:

     Site Name		IP Address	Directory	Comments
     ---------		----------	---------	--------
     ftp.ninemoons.com	165.247.33.6	pub/ade		(master site)
     ftp.grolier.fr		194.158.97.67	pub/amiga/ade	(full mirror)
     bilbo.di.unipi.it	131.114.4.62	pub/ade		(latest + updates)

CD-ROM distributions
--------------------

   CD-ROM distributions are particularly handy ways of obtaining GCC
(and other free tools).    Unfortunately, the FreshFish CD-ROM is no
longer in production due to lack of market.  However, Cronus will make
a custom CD with the current ADE development tree in a ready to run
form for $50.  See <http://www.cronus.com> for more details.  The Amiga
Developer's CD may also be a source of the ADE development tree (I'm
not sure).

The Breakdown of the Distribution
=================================

Net Distribution
----------------

   The net distribution of gcc is broken up into several parts, both to
make it easier to download and to respect the GPL.  Thus each archive is
broken into two parts, one for binaries and one for sources.

   Gcc-2.7.0 is split up into 15 archives:
`gcc270-base.lha'

ADE distribution
----------------

   The ADE distribution is quite a bit different from the net
distribution.  From the README:

   The ADE is can be divided into several distinct files trees, as
follows:

ADE-bin
     Binary tree where executables, runtime libraries, user
     documentation, etc live in "ready-to-run" form.  Uses "ADE:" as an
     alias (Amiga assign).  The files in this area are built from
     source in ADE-src or copied from files in ADE-src.

ADE-src
     Source tree which contains all the sources for components of the
     ADE.  Given the ADE-src tree, and a copy of the ADE-bin tree, it
     should be possible to completely recreate the ADE-bin and ADE-dist
     trees.

ADE-dist
     Tree which contains material from ADE-bin and ADE-src, archived in
     a form suitable for BBS or ftp access.  Also contains baseline
     source archives for packages which have been modified and diff
     files for the Amiga sources relative to this baseline.

   The ADE-dist tree normally contains several files for each program.
As an example, here are the names of the files for the GNU C compiler.
Each file also has an associated product info file which has the same
name but an additional suffix of ".pi":

gcc-X.X.X-base.tgz
     Baseline source before incorporation into the ADE.  In some cases
     base files have been reorganized to match the same file tree
     structure as used for the Amiga source in the ADE, so that diff
     files can be mechanically generated.

gcc-X.X.X-bin.lha
     The binary package for GNU C, C++, and Objective C.

gcc-X.X.X-src.tgz
     The Amiga source from which the supplied binaries were compiled.

gcc-X.X.X-diffs.gz
     The diffs from the baseline to the Amiga source.  The baseline
     source, amiga source, and diff file form a complete source
     distribution.  In theory, only any two of these are needed, since
     the third can be regenerated from either of the other two.

   Note that `.tgz' is short for `.tar.gz', which is a gzip compressed
tar archive.  To extract the contents, you would do something like:
     	tar -xvpzf gcc-X.X.X-base.tgz

   If this causes you any problems, you can use pipes to do the
decompression and tar extraction as two separate processes, without
creating a temporary file:

     	zcat gcc-X.X.X-base.tgz | tar -xvpf -
   Without using pipes, you can create a temporary file to extract from,
as follows:

     	zcat gcc-X.X.X-base.tgz >gcc-X.X.X-base.tar
     	tar -xvpf gcc-X.X.X.tar

   The minimum set of packages is:
   - ADE-misc-bin.lha

   - binutils-X.X-bin.lha

   - bison-X.X-bin.lha

   - diffutils-X.X-bin.lha

   - fifo-X.X-bin.lha

   - fileutils-X.X-bin.lha

   - findutils-X.X-bin.lha

   - flex-X.X-bin.lha

   - gcc-X.X-bin.lha

   - grep-X.X-bin.lha

   - gzip-X.X-bin.lha

   - ixemul-X.X-bin.lha

   - ixemul-X.X-env-bin.lha

   - ixemul-X.X-inc-bin.lha

   - ixpipe-X.X-bin.lha

   - libamiga-bin.lha

   - libg++-X.X-bin.lha

   - libm-X.X-bin.lha

   - libnix-X.X-bin.lha

   - make-X.X-bin.lha

   - os-inc-bin.lha

   - patch-X.X-bin.lha

   - pdksh-X.X-bin.lha

   - sed-X.X-bin.lha

   - sh-utils-X.X-bin.lha

   - tar-X.X-bin.lha

   - termcap-X.X-bin.lha

Installation
============

Net Distribution
----------------

   Installation procedures may vary depending on your source, but the
final directory structure should be the same.  Check the `README' files
included in your distribution package for more details.

   The ftp distribution (Phillipe Brand's) contains an Installer
program.      It utilizes the following layout:

   A standard GNU directory tree structure has been adopted by the
porting team to make life easier for everyone.  Starting with the
assign of GNU: to somewhere, we then have:
          GNU:amigados
          GNU:man
          GNU:Info
          GNU:etc
          GNU:bin
          GNU:include
          GNU:lib
          GNU:os-include
          GNU:os-lib

   Since one of the aims of porting GNU software is to be able to
provide a Un*x like environment under AmigaOS, the porters decided to
make a GNU "root directory" (`GNU:') in which a standard Un*x directory
tree can live, like `/etc', `/bin', and so on.  This decision makes for
good Un*x compatibility.

   Also, in the past, you would have to add many assigns (>=10) to have
your GNU utilities working, and now it's just 5 (`GNU:', `MAN:',
`INFO:',`ETC:', and `BIN:').

   We no longer have a conflicting assign `LIB:' (which most other
compilers use).

   The above information is out of date (though true for older
distributions).  Currently the GNU directory has been changed to the
ADE directory, and even fewer assigns are needed.  Furthermore, all
current programs from the ADE distribution refer to the ade directory
and not the gnu assign.

ADE distribution
----------------

   Currently the only supported method of installing components of the
ADE is to create a directory which will be the root of the ADE binary
tree, assign ADE: to this directory, cd to ADE:, and use lha to extract
the contents of the packages you wish to install (everything is
archived relative to ADE:).

   For example, the following illustrates populating the ADE binary
tree with the minimum set of packages that we would recommend for doing
serious C or C++ development.  Replace `-X.X-' with the appropriate
version numbers for the current release:
     	makedir dh0:ADE
     	assign ADE: dh0:ADE
     	cd ADE:
     	lha -mraxe x ADE-misc-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x binutils-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x bison-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x diffutils-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x fifo-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x fileutils-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x findutils-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x flex-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x gcc-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x grep-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x gzip-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x ixemul-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x ixemul-X.X-env-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x ixemul-X.X-inc-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x ixpipe-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x libamiga-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x libg++-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x libm-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x libnix-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x make-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x os-inc-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x patch-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x pdksh-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x sed-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x sh-utils-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x tar-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x termcap-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x textutils-X.X-bin.lha

   The following should be optional, unless you want to remake a
"configure" file, want EMACS, or current need a libcurses library
(should be replaced soon with ncurses):
     	lha -mraxe x autoconf-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x emacs-X.X-bin.lha
     	lha -mraxe x libcurses-X.X-bin.lha

   You may want to examine the ixemul.library flavors in `ADE:Sys/Libs'
and select one more appropriate for your specific machine.  For example,
A4000 users might want to remove the default ixemul.library (68000) and
copy `ixemul040fpu.library' to `ixemul.library'.

   If you want to just do libnix development and not ixemul
development, note that you still need the include files from
`ixemul-X.X-inc-bin.lha'.

   You should also ensure that you have an environment variable called
`HOME', which should point to a local directory that can be used to
contain "reconfiguration scripts" that many tools look for.  As an
example, the following is a useful definition for `$HOME/.inputrc':


       # My ~/.inputrc file is in -*- text -*- for easy editing with Emacs.
       #
       # Notice the various bindings which are conditionalized depending
       # on which program is running, or what terminal is active.
       #
     
       # In all programs, all terminals, make sure this is bound.
       "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
     
       # Amiga console specials
       "": delete-char
     
       "A": previous-history
       "B": next-history
       "C": forward-char
       "D": backward-char

   Once you are done, arrange to assign `ADE:' in your startup, arrange
to execute `ADE:Sys/S/ADE-Startup' at boot time, and reboot.

   Once you've started using ADE, the `ADE-Startup' adds all necessary
assigns to subdirectories of `ADE:'.  So you do not need to, for
example, copy `ixemul.library' to `LIBS:'.  In fact, if have been using
the net distribution, you should make sure that all their binaries are
cleaned out of `C:', `LIBS:', `L:', etc. as they will interfere with
the more current ade distribution.  For example, make sure you delete
`ixemul.library' from `LIBS:'.

Common Installation Problems
============================

   Using the Installer program for the net distribution should get rid
of any problems.

   Check out the GNU documentation on the `specs' file if you are having
problems customizing your installation (say you have another compiler,
and don't want to have 2 separate copies of `os-include').

   Also, for those of you who refuse to read the `README', you need the
Commodore includes. See @{"Getting the Commodore includes" Link "Getting the Commodore includes"}.

   You may need to convert some standard libraries. See
@{"The object file format of GCC" Link "The object file format of GCC"}.

   Another common problem is crashes due to having too little stack.
See @{"Set your stack properly" Link "Set your stack properly"}.

   Most of these problems have been overcome and should not be problems
for current net distributions.

Set your stack properly
=======================

   [Note: this warning is dated as versions >= 2.7.0 include automatic
stack checking.]

   GCC needs a lot of stack to run.  For a nice, small (<1000 lines)
source, a stack of 50,000 should do just fine.  For more complicated
code, you may need more, but 250,000 should do in any case, for gcc
alone.

   Note that using make may increase the demands on the stack size, so
the above suggestions may not hold.

   A word from Phillipe Brand's README:

   You need to have a 50,000 stack size in order to compile with GCC.
This should be enough for most projects. Note than while recompiling
gcc with itself it has taken more than 300KB stack. Stack can grow due
to source complexity.  Don't be afraid of it.

   To set the stack size, see the AmigaDOS Command `stack'.

   To use `ar' and/or `ranlib', 50KB is the minimum acceptable.  You
should have a much larger stack, if you use larger libraries.

   Starting with 2.6.3 a new environnement variable, `GCCSTACK',
enables gcc to read this variable and set stack upon startup. Thus now
no need to set stack to huge values, only `gcc/ld/cpp/cc1#?' will
automatically set new stack, according to `GCCSTACK' variable.

   Simply commit a:
     	setenv GCCSTACK value
   to set gcc stack to value.

   Benefits: huge memory savings.

   Note that GCC 2.7.2 includes automatic stack growth code, so you
won't need to worry about this anymore.

   Actually 2.7.0 didn't quite solve this problem, but (I believe) that
it has been solved in the latest ADE distribution.  However, the
`GCCSTACK' environment variable conflicts with the automatic stack
extension code, and has therefore been removed.

Ixemul.Library
--------------

   This library was developed by Markus Wild when originally started
porting GCC (up to version 2.3.3).  It is a shared library that emulates
a lot of Un*x functions, making life a lot easier for folks porting GNU
utilities and such.  Unfortunately, it is fairly resource hungry by
Amiga standards, and has caused not a little irritation among Amiga
users.  By default, GCC has programs it compiles open ixemul.library, so
if you want to avoid it, you'll have to use `-noixemul' on the command
line (see below in Amiga specific extensions and/or coding with libnix)
and link to one of the libraries below.

   	The general rule of thumb should be to use ixemul.library if you're
writing something non-Amiga specific (e.g. porting something) or one of
the below link libraries when writing something specifically for the
Amiga.

   You can use the ixprefs program to set various options of
ixemul.library.


@EndNode

@Node "libnix" "gcc-faq.guide/libnix"

@Toc "Amiga specific Library options"

libnix
------

   This is a standard link library to replace the functionality of
ixemul.library. Make sure you link to it if you use the `-noixemul'
command line option for gcc.

   Libnix, a static (i.e. link) library for gcc 2.3.3 or above.  It's
not a replacement for ixemul.library (though it's possible to recompile
most of the gcc environment with libnix) but a good thing for amiga
specific development on gcc:

   *   It's mostly compatible to SAS's way of handling things, i.e.
     you get even an automatic shared library opening feature and
     some other things you may miss in ixemul.library.    This also
     means it's ANSI compliant.

   *  It doesn't need any shared libraries than normal Amiga OS ones.

   *  It is not copyrighted by the FSF. Therefore you neither need   to
     include sources nor objects together with your executable.
     (read the GLGPL _before_ flaming on this statement)

   *  And it's short! I was able to compile a 492 byte 'hello, world'
     using normal main.

   *  It uses OS20 features whenever necessary.

   To cut it short:

   Use ixemul.library for porting Un*x programs, libnix for compiling
amiga-only programs and gcc becomes one of the best Amiga compilers.

   But if you use an older gcc version or if you want to get the sources
you can take this package. But be warned: The ld that comes with earlier
versions of gcc has some serious trouble with set elements. You cannot
use libnix without the fixed linker that comes with gcc2.6.0.

The object file format of GCC
=============================

   Yes, GCC uses its own object file format.  This means you aren't
currently able to link to AmigaDOS hunk format object files (standard).
But hunk2gcc (by Markus Wild) will do the conversion for you as
described below.

   Why does GCC use its own object file format?  It's really just a
design decision that allows other gnu utilities to deal with these
objects (for example, gdb, nm, objdump, and gas) without having to
convert them to deal with AmigaDOS hunks.

   [From Brand's README-2.6.3]
     Starting from this release an AmigaDOS compliant library is
     provided, thanks to libnix authors (Matthias Fleischer and Gunther
     Nikl).

     Anyway if you want to rebuild one, there are two methods:

     1) Using hunk2gcc; the AmigaDOS object converter made by Markus
     Wild. To achieve this, simply grab a copy of latest amiga.lib
     (from Commodore Development Kit) and make a new directory where
     you want your converted object files to go, cd into it, and enter

            hunk2gcc amiga.lib [..further libs if you like..]

     This generates an a.out object file for every program unit present
     in the hunk file (in this case, from amiga.lib).

     As the final step convert all those files into an a.out style
     library by issuing:

            ar qc libamiga.a obj.*
            ranlib libamiga.a

     The ranlib run builds a symbol table in the archive, and makes
     accesses to the library much faster.

     2) Creating a libamiga.a library with libnix is fairly easy, but
     takes some time. Just uncompress sources.lha from libnix
     distribution and run a 'make libamiga.a'.

     NOTE:

     As long as you make no AmigaDOs specific calls, you can create a
     dummy library using:

            cat "int dummy;" >dummy.c
            gcc -c dummy.c
            ar crv libamiga.a dummy.o
            mv libamiga.a gcc:lib

     A small libamiga.a (dummy) is also provided with libnix.

   [current]

   Now libamiga.a has its own archive in the ADE tree, and is not the
Commodore copyrighted one.  If for some reason you need the original,
you will have to follow the above procedures to get it.

Getting the Commodore includes
==============================

   [Jochen Wiedmann]

   You can obtain the includes and some developer tools from any Fish CD
and some other CD's as well.

   However, you will be missing the autodocs, which are definitely the
best information source for the OS functions. You can get them either
by buying the

   The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Includes and Autodocs, ISBN
                                              0-201-56773-3

   (about 50-60$, as far as I know), or by buying the so-called NDU
(Native developers update kit, 5 disks, about 40$) from

              Fa. Hirsch & Wolf
              Mittelstr. 33
              56564 Neuwied

              Phone: (0049) +2631 83990
     Email: hhhirsch@carla.adsp.sub.org

   Sorry, but this is still the *only* source for the NDU, at least as
long as CATS (Commodore Amiga Technical Support) isn't alive.

   I'd prefer buying the NDU, because it contains the newer information
than the book and I prefer it online.

   [Rask Lambertsen]

   [The C= includes are available via FTP from <ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de>
in directory cdrom/bbs/cbm. URL:
file://ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de/cdrom/bbs/cbm/

   The latest package is nduk-v40.lha. It includes includes (asm and C),
fd-files and a few developer tools (Atom, Alink, ...).

   Just to advertice a little for my homepage (sorry), I keep an
up-to-date link to the OS includes. They seem to move around from time
to time.  <http://srv2.gbar.dtu.dk:8001/Rask/>

The frontend of the compiler
============================

   `amigados-gcc' and `gcc' are the same thing.  Since `fork()' is
unimplemented in ixemul.library, `gcc' has been replaced by `gccv'
(uses `vfork()' instead of `fork()').

   AREXX scripts [Phillipe Brand's README]:

   The provided ARexx scripts have been contributed by Loren J. Rittle.
If you like ARexx, they're an alternate way of calling gcc. They
automatically make sure you're using a large enough stack setting, and
enable you to compile C++ programs with less obscure options. This
approach is furthermore useful if you're not able to use the g++ /bin/sh
script.

   These scripts should no longer be necessary.

Optimization may work where no optimization doesn't
===================================================

   The folks who write GCC almost always use `-O' when compiling GCC

without optimization.  So you may want to try it.

Using the OS functions with gcc
===============================

   [Jochen Wiedmann, with a small suggestion by Christian Stieber]

   Let's write a simple "HelloWorld.c":

         /*  Compile me with
     	    gcc -noixemul -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.c -lauto
         */
         #include <stdlib.c>
         #include <intuition/intuition.h>
         #include <proto/intuition.h>
     
         int main(int argc, char *argv[])
     
         {
             struct EasyRequest er;
     
             er.es_StructSize = sizeof(er);
             er.es_Flags = 0;
             er.es_Title = "Message";
             er.es_TextFormat = "Hello, world!\nintuition.library is at 0x8l.";
             er.es_GadgetFormat = "Ok";
             EasyRequest(NULL, &er, NULL, IntuitionBase);
     	exit(0);
         }
   Some notes:
   *  We are using the function EasyRequestArgs() from
     intuition.library.      Thus we have to include the appropriate
     headers: intuition/intuition.h     for the structures and
     constants, proto/intuition.h for the     function prototypes. Do
     not use headers from other compilers (for     example
     pragmas/intuition.h), gcc headers (inline/intuition.h,
     included by proto/intuition.h) or even OS headers
     (clib/intuition_protos.h). The only exception are
     clib/alib_protos.h     and clib/alib_stdio_protos.h: These
     represent link libraries and not     shared libraries.

   *  We did *not* open intuition.library. gcc does this for you by
     including proto/intuition.h and linking against libauto.a.
     However, this works only for OS libraries. Consult the GNU:libauto
        directory, if you want to know how to get the same
     possibilities for     other shared libraries.

     Using proto/intuition.h you are safe and even source compatible
     to SAS/C and Dice.

   *  If you *need* to open a library manually, do it as follows:

          	#include <stdlib.h>
          	#include <stdio.h>
                  #include <intuition/intuition.h>
          	#include <proto/intuition.h>
          
                  struct IntuitionBase *IntuitionBase = NULL;
          	/*  Explicit initialization with NULL is a *must*!  */
          
          	void Cleanup(void)
          
          	{
          	    if (IntuitionBase) CloseLibrary(IntuitionBase);
          	}
          
          	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
          
          	{
          	    if (atexit(Cleanup))
                      {
          		perror("atexit");
          		exit(20);
          	    }
          
          	    if (!(IntuitionBase = (struct IntuitionBase *)
          			OpenLibrary("intuition.library", 37)))
                      {
          		fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open intuition.library, V37");
          		exit(20);
          	    }
          
          	    /* Same program as above */
          	}
          Note the use of `atexit()', which makes `exit()' calling
     `Cleanup()'.

     Note this possible alteration:
          struct EasyRequest er;
          er.es_StructSize = sizeof(er);
     This seems to be correct, but I suggest hardcoding 5*sizeof(ULONG)
     here.  That field serves as version information; using sizeof()
     and compiling with newer headers would tell the OS that you're
     using the new structure.  But the additional fields will contain
     garbage...

Removing Debug Symbols
======================

   	By default, GCC will leave the debugging symbols in the executable.
To turn this off, simply use `-s' on the command line when you compile.
It could significantly reduce the size of your executable.

`ssystem()' not implemented error
=================================

   As of `ixemul' version 43.1, `fork()' is no longer supported at all,
and hence `ssystem()' isn't supported either.  The `gcc' executable in
the 2.7.0 distribution still uses `ssystem()', so you need to remove
that executable, and rename `gccv' (which uses `system()') to `gcc'.
These executables should be found in a subdirectory of
`ADE:lib/gcc-lib/' (depends on which distribution you have).

The CHIP keyword
================

   	Most C compilers for the Amiga have a CHIP keyword or equivalent to
signify that an object should stored CHIP memory when declared.  I.e.,
     CHIP struct Image *my_graphics = { ... }
   will cause the memory for the data to which my_graphics points to be
allocated in CHIP memory (pretty handy, huh?)

   	This is obviously Amiga-specific, so of course it's not implemented
in the FSF code. BUT, the linker (ld) currently recognizes -chip and
-fast options.  However, these aren't in gcc itself, mainly because gcc
doesn't output files in the right format to load data directly to chip
memory.

   However, there are several workarounds.  The first is software based,
mainly you declare and define your data as an array (or whatever), then
Allocmem(sizeof(data),MEMF_CHIP), then copy the data from your original
data structure using cpymem().

   [Lars Hecking]
      I have written this code years ago to use Intuition++ (still on
     Aminet)  with g++. The BOOL return type could be replaced with
     int, returning  appropriate values instead of TRUE and FALSE.
     Everything should be  self-explanatory ;-)
          begin>>
          
          chip USHORT CTRL_ImageData[] = { .... };
          
          becomes
          
          extern USHORT CTRL_ImageData[];
          
          USHORT *CTRLImageData;
          
          BOOL AllocInitChipData()
          {
           CTRLImageData = (USHORT *)AllocMem (sizeof(CRTL_ImageData),MEMF_CHIP);
          
           if (CTRLImageData == (USHORT *)NULL)
            return FALSE;
          
           CopyMemQuick ((APTR)&CTRL_ImageData[0], (APTR)CTRLImageData, sizeof(CRTL_ImageData));
          
           return TRUE;
          }
          
          void FreeChipData()
          {
           FreeMem ((APTR)CTRLImageData,sizeof(CTRL_ImageData));
          }
          
          end>>

   The second way is to use a program like Bin2Hunk (on Aminet in
`/dev/misc/BintoHunk.lha'), which will take a data file and make it
into a linkable object file.  The documentation for Bin2Hunk tells you
how to specify variable names for the data in this file so you can
reference this data from within your program.  This seems like a better
solution than the first since you don't have to deal with dynamically
allocating memory and copying it.  However, I haven't tested this
program myself or this way of doing things - please let me know if it
works and how well.

   The third way would be to use another compiler that allows the
`CHIP' keyword to compile the source code containing the data that you
want in `CHIP' memory, then link to it. This doesn't have to mean
SAS/C.  If you're just using it to compile a file that's just a bunch of
     CHIP UBYTE *data { whatever ...}
   you could probably use any Amiga native compiler, even if it's old
and decrepit for doing anything else.  Let me know if you find a good,
cheap or free compiler for this (maybe the old PDC, or the DICE demo
version will do it).  Certainly an old copy of Lattice 5.10 should be
able to handle this.

`-fbaserel' (not available in pre-2.7.0)
----------------------------------------

   [Christian Stieber]

   `-fbaserel' turns on base relative addressing; which means that
global/static variables are referenced with a 16 bit offset relative to
an address register (a4 is generally used for that). The startup-code
loads a4 with a pointer into the data segment. Result: every access to
a global/shared variable is only 16 bit instead of the usual 32 bit
address which is shorter and faster. It also means that you're limited
to at most 64K of global/static variables.

   Make sure you link to baserel libraries when you use this option(!).
The standard configuration of gcc should specify baserel versions of
standard libraries be used, but make sure if you make your own that they
are baserel too.

`-resident'
-----------

   [Christian Stieber]

   A "resident" program (the correct term is "pure") is a program that
can be loaded into memory just once, but executed by serveral processes
at the same time. Therefore, "resident" is actually "code sharing".
-resident turns on -fbaserel and links with a special startup code.
That first thing that special startup code is to allocate some memory,
copy the global/static variables into it and load a4 with a pointer to
that memory. Then, a normal startup-code and your normal program is
run. When the program exists, the memory block is freed.  Result: Every
process has its very own, private data segment for global/static
variables. Since there all global/static variables are accessed via
a4+16-bit-offset (because of `-fbaserel'), the original data segment is
untouched. Result: the program can be executed independently by several
processes, with every process getting its own data segment.

How do I build a cross-compiler?
================================

   [from Phillipe Brand]

     How to generate a cross-compiler, AmigaDOS side:
     
     - Get gcc-2.6.3.tar.gz from ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu or mirror site
     - Get ftp.telesys-innov.fr:/pub/amigados-gnu/gcc-2.6.3-amiga.diffs file
     
     >From CLI:
     
     CLI> sh
     # zcat gcc-2.6.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     # cd gcc-2.6.3
     # zcat ../gcc-2.6.3-amiga.diffs | patch -p1
     # ./configure --host=amigados --target=CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
     # make
   When compilers are built, all you have to do is installing it using
make install, and to grab other architecture's libraries (libc.a,
etc...), and headers.

Finding bugs with trace()
-------------------------

   [Joerg-Cyril Hoehle]

   More than one year ago, I corrected a huge bug in the program trace
(a buffer overflow). Together with ixemul.trace, this program allows you
to see every ixemul call (aka SnoopDOS for ixemul.library programs) and
may be useful for debugging.

   Before, because of that overflow, trace hung the whole system very
often (and very soon) when tracing every ixemul call. Now, I've been
able to trace long sessions of gcc compilation to a (K)CON: window
without trouble.

Writing code for libnix
=======================

   	You should really grab the documentation for libnix from the libnix
source archive and read it.

   	But in the meanwhile, here's a warning from one of the authors of
libnix:

   [Gunther Nikl]

   Let's write a simple "HelloWorld.c":

         /*  Compile me with
                 gcc -noixemul -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.c -lauto
         */
                                                          ^^^^^^

   When using the `-noixemul' switch it is NOT nessecary (and better
avoided) to use `-lauto'. libnix uses an own technique to open  the
system libraries.

   Using `-noixemul' and `-lauto' together means that all system
libraries will be opened twice...

   The `libauto.a' is only useful for IXEMUL linked programs.

Problems with asm()
===================

   	It seems a lot of people have trouble making heads or tails of GNU's
documentation for this function.  As such, someone (or several
someones) is going to be rewriting the GCC documentation with regards
to asm().  Unfortunately, this won't be ready in time for 2.7.0, so I'm
including some answers to a couple of the problems people are having
with asm().  [Perhaps the new GNU documentation for asm() will be
distributed as a "patch" when it is done.]

   [Niels M|ller <nisse@lysator.liu.se>]
     How do I create and use functions that take their arguments in
     registers?
   I'm not an expert, but I'll nevertheless try to answer.

   If you define a function like below, the effect is that it takes two
arguments, in registers D0 and A0. (I hope I got this right, I have
actually never used this myself).

     int my_func(void /* Don't declare any arguments here */)
     {
        register int arg1 __asm("d0");
        register int *arg2 __asm("a0");
     
        return do_something(arg1,arg2);
     }
   [Response from Tom Ollila]

   This works since those registers are not used for anything else. When
declared in this way arg1 and arg2 are hardcoded to registers d0 and a0
(and are therefore not used for anything else when doing register
allocations (if alive)). And with scratch registers such as do and a0, =
a function call will trash the registers if used inside the called
functi= on.

   The "correct" way to make this thing above would be the following:


     int my_func(void /* Don't declare any arguments here */)
     {
        register int d0 __asm("d0");
        int arg1 =3D d0;
        register int * a0 __asm("a0");
        int * arg2 =3D a0;
     
     ...
     }
   [back to Niels]

   To make gcc call a function that takes registerized arguments is a
little more tricky. Here you have to use inline assembler. I quote an
example from the gcc manual (I guess the processor used in the example
is a sparc):

   You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
`asm' template, separated either with newlines (written as `\n') or wit=
h semicolons if the assembler allows such semicolons.  The GNU assembler
allows semicolons and all Unix assemblers seem to do so.  The input
operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered registers, and
neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can read and write
the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here is an example
of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes that the subroutine
`_foo' accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:

          asm ("movl %0,r9;movl %1,r10;call _foo"
               : /* no outputs */
               : "g" (from), "g" (to)
               : "r9", "r10");

   This is equivalent to the C-statement
     foo(from,to);
   except that "from" and "to" are passed in registers r9 and r10, and
not on the stack. To call amiga-style libraries is similar, the inline
headers shows how it can be done.

     	  int *,	rvp,	a0)
     #if 0
     {	/* this is for emacs c-mode */
     #endif
     
     ... and to make a call to this functions (RRAPx -macros also return a v=
     alue)
     
     int main()
     {
       int rv;
     
       RAP1(function,
            int,	6,	d0,
            int *,	&rv,	a0);

How do I save RAM?
==================

   [Jochen Wiedmann, Joerg Hoehle]

   A simple try is to do a
         setenv TMP MyHardDrive:t
   before compiling. This will create temporary files on the harddisk
and not in RAM:. Depending on what you compile this can save several
100KB of RAM and it doesn't slow down the compiler very much.

   Another try is to turn off optimization (`-O0' or not `-O' at all)
until your program is stable.  Optimizing needs a lot of memory.

   Another try is to run `cpp', `cc1', `as' and `ld' directly instead
of through the `gcc' driver.  This saves at least one times your
current stack size.  Use the `-v' option to `gcc' to see what the
command lines would look like and copy&paste them.

   Previous *inlines* used a lot of memory during compilation, but this
is no longer the case.  The new inlines (preprocessor based macros)
even work without optimization.

Writing shared libraries and resident (pure) code
=================================================

   Here is some discussion from the amiga-gcc-port mailing list

   [Peter Ivimey-Cook]
      Obviously there must be other solutions. Being able to build a
     library  is not far away from being able to build a pure
     (=residentable)  program, and gcc-2.3.3 was both largely above
     64KB in size and  residentable. So what's the trick?

   Don't use global data referenced absolutely! residentable implies
reentrant, which means that global data is read-only apart from the
first instance (i.e. it's OK to initialise it, once, but once
initialised it can't be modified or reinitialised). This effectively
means the only data used in the must be on the stack or referenced from
it by pointers, as the stack is separate for different invocations of a
resident program.

   Of course this does pose a major headache for programs which use
lots of global data. And watch out for library use too!

   Failing this, one must use a global data access mechanism which
allows:

   the base address to be set up - e.g. by calling AllocMem() and
storing the result in a register (NOT a global!)

   *all* accesses to "global" data are relative to this register.

   [Peter Ivimey-Cook]
     BUT: If we build a shared lib from the static link lib, code
     exists only once  and is SHARED between callers of the lib
     (callers means different executables, using the lib)  Here the
     problem comes up that the DATA MUST not be shared between
     different callers.   This is because it is PRIVATE to the
     individual caller.   IMHO the only way to realize multiple callers
     is the use of -fbaserel, since now access  is relative to the A4
     register and thus, every program can have IT'S OWN data, without
     interferring with each other.

   It depends on the way the library is constructed. Most Amiga
libraries are written to be re-entrant - i.e. they don't use global
data items which would require loading - they use the stack. For items
which can't be done this way, there are two solutions -
   * Use the library data space. It's global, unless you make provision
     for it to be otherwise - and availabl easily off a6.

   * Manage your own data space, using tags or whatever to allocate
     space for callers. Note that the only indication you have as to
     who is the current caller is the result of FindTask().

   So, in general libraries try to make required data passed through
parameters, or available on the stack, or shareably global. In which
case no baserel or anything else is required.

   [Jochen Wiedmann]
   *  Of course it is possible to write shared libraries
     (ixemul.library,     for example) with gcc, but *only* if the
     source is written with a     shared library in mind.

   *  It is possible (Matthias told how) to develop a solution that
     would     allow to use existing source of link libraries for
     shared libraries     (libbfd sources, for example) with at most
     very minor modifications

   * fbaserel would be a must for the above solution. On the other hand
        it is not possible yet, at least not without going to the
     assembler     level. (Really deep, not just using some headers
     with asm keywords.)

      Could you elaborate on that so that we know a little more about
     it,  please?

   *  keep in mind that all callers use the same global and static
     variables;   that means: either protect them with semaphores (e.g.
     if your library   is using a memory pool), or allocate a block of
     memory inside your library   and pass pointers around.

   *  the "startup" code will contain the ROMTag structure and related
     data,   as well as stubs to push parameters on the stack, calling
     the C function,   cleaning up the stack.

   *  I generally write the libOpen(), libClose(), libInit() etc.
     functions   as normal C functions, but some people might prefer to
     put them into   the "startup code".

   That's about all. It also means that many link-lib functions (e.g.
from libnix) can't be used; this has to be decided on a per-function
basis.  It's pretty safe to say that you can't use stdio and malloc().
strcpy(), isdigit() are safe, etc. Just be careful. Think about what
the function does; that should give you an idea whether you can use it
or not.

   [further elaboration by Christian Stieber]

           Can you tell me what you mean by "startup code" here (since
     you put it  in quotes).

   Simple. The "startup code" is generally something that you pass to
the linker as the first file. It will then end up being the first thing
in the executable, i.e. the stuff in the "startup code" is the stuff
that gets executed when you start the program.

   A shared (Amiga) library doesn't get executed; however, a shared
Amiga library is supposed to be built in a specific way:

     	moveq #-1,d0
     	rts			[ROMtag Structure]
     
     ROMTag:
     	a structure telling exec about the library
     	is supposed to be here

   That's why I used the term "startup code" in quotes. Instead of the
usual "startup code" duties (opening `stdin/stdout/stderr', setting up
`malloc()' etc.) the "library startup code" includes the two asm
statements and the ROMTag structure; as well as other data related to
libraries.

     Does it mean that you can't use any global variable? Or only one
     but  declare it with something like `__asm__("a4")' and use it as
     a base  pointer? Does it imply that you must use the `inline/*.h'?
     Does it imply  that you must use a special startup code , and, if
     so, what must it  do?

   In short: You may well use something like
       struct ExecBase *SysBase;
   and read this variable from anywhere within your program, because you
can
   * initialize it from the library startup code and

   * be sure that it never changes but you must not use global or
static data otherwise.

   [Christian Stieber]

   [about why `-resident' isn't what you normally use for shared
libraries]
           This is really a special case of resident code, and has
          nothing to do  with -resident
       Hmm, why is it called -resident then?

   You were talking about writing shared libraries. As I explained in
my last mail, `-resident' causes the startup code to create a new data
segment for they don't clone their datasegment (usually. Some libraries
do that).

   That means you use `-resident' for programs that you want to be
"pure"; you don't use `-resident' for libraries even though libraries
are "pure" as well.

I want to change from SAS/C to GCC
==================================

   Great!

   [Kriton Kyrimis]
      I am also wondering if it is possible to link object files that
     were  created by different conpilers, specifically GCC and SAS. I
     need to do

   Try compiling SAS programs using DATA=FAR CODE=FAR, then use the
hunk2gcc program to convert the object files from amiga format to sun
format.

   One problem with this approach would be with floating point code and
with integer multiplication/division. If you can compile with CPU=68020
(or higher) and MATH=68881, then SAS/C will produce inline code, and
you will have no problem. Otherwise, you'll have to grab the necessary
modules from the SAS libraries and convert them to sun format as well.
(Compiling with the option that produces code that uses
`utility.library', and linking with `-lauto'  might alleviate the
problem.)

   And here's a little AREXX program to automagically convert sas libs
to gcc libs:

   This arexx program is based on help from Philippe BRAND.

Inline Headers
==============

   [Christian Stieber]
           compiling bgui:demos/font.c:
             gcc -O3 -noixemul bgui:demos/font.c
      got errors:
             font.c:100: unterminated macro call

   This is because the inlined varargs aren't useful at all. Do
`#define NO_INLINE_STDARG' (or whatever it is called), and create
varargs stubs like this:

     Prototype: BOOL SomeFunction(int, char *, ...);
     and        BOOL SomeFunctionA(int, char *, APTR);
     
     Stub function:
     #define NO_INLINE_STDARG
     #include <inline/someinline.h>
     BOOL SomeFunction(int A, char *B, ...)
     {
       return SomeFunctionA(A,B,(&B)+1);
     }

   That isn't really ANSI-C, but it works on all Amiga compilers I know
of.

   Create a .c file for every function, compile, ar and link it to the
program. Make sure the optimizer is on, else `SomeFunctionA' won't be
inlined.

   How to create stubs for non-varargs functions: In order to be able
to compiler without `-O', you want to create stubs for the inline
functions as well:
     #define NO_INLINE_STDARG
     #define SomeFunctionA InlinedSomeFunctionA
     #include <inline/someinlines.h>
     #undef SomeFunctionA
     BOOL SomeFunctionA(int A, char *B, APTR C)
     {
       return InlinedSomeFunctionA(A,B,C);
     }

   Again, create such a file for every function and put the *.o files
into the archive mentioned above.

Writing Hooks
=============

   [Tomi Ollila]
      How to I write a hook function - I.E. Specify which registers
     parameters  should be received in and that the result should be
     returned in register D0.

   One way to do this is to write the function entry the following way:

     ULONG hook(void)
     {
       register char * a0 __asm("a0");
       char * buffer = a0;
       register ULONG d0 __asm("d0");
       ULONG size = d0;
     
       ...
     
       return length;
     }

   We wrote some macros for AmiTCP/IP project to make it easier to
write this kind of function entries...

     #define RAF2(funname, type1, arg1, reg1, type2, arg2, reg2) \
       funname(VOID)                     \
     {                                   \
       register type1 reg1 __asm(#reg1); \
       type1 arg1 = reg1;                \
       register type2 reg2 __asm(#reg2); \
       type2 arg2 = reg2;
   would make the above function look like:

     ULONG RAF2(hook,
     	   char *,	buffer,	a0,
     	   ULONG,	size,	d0)
     #if 0
     {
     ...}
     #endif

   The whole macro file `amiga_raf.h' is available at kampi.hut.fi,
directory /AmiTCP. It defines RAF1 - RAF7 for both GNU C and SAS C
compilers (someone could write these to DICE as well).

       Is there anyway to specify that a function should NOT be made
     inline (As   I wouldn't want the hook function inlined.

   Compile it in a separate module. This way gcc doesn't see the
function code when compiling. If you give a pointer to the function,
then it must also exist as a callable function.

symbol and operator you used is not found. You just have to add
`-lstdc++' at the end of command line, or, even better, use `g++', not
`gcc':

     g++ -o hw hw.cc

@Toc "Notes For Un*x Hackers"

`fork()' is not implemented
===========================

   This is from the current readme (in the ixemul source archive) for
ixemul.library.

   PORTING UNIX PROGRAMS

   Most programs compile out-of-the-box.  There are a few exceptions to
this rule.  First of all, programs like linkers and the like that have
to be able to read or write the standard Amiga hunk format obviously
need a lot of work.

   Secondly, there is no virtual memory support, and therefore no real
`fork()' function.  In most cases the `fork()' function is only used to
spawn a new program, and in such cases it is possible to replace
`fork()' by `vfork()', which is a light-weight `fork()' replacement
that was originally created for Unix to reduce the overhead a real
`fork()' introduced.

   A `vfork()' doesn't create a copy of itself as `fork()' does, but
uses the parent's code and data.  Since the child will quickly call
`execve()' to spawn another program, this sharing of the code and data
is no problem and saves a lot of time.

   In some cases, such as a Unix shell (pdksh for example), you really
want to be able to port a program that uses a fork() that cannot be
replaced with `vfork()'.  There is a way to do this, although it is a
lot of work.  First of all, the program has to be compiled with
-resident.  Now you replace the `fork()' by a `vfork2()' call, and in
the child code you call ix_resident() to copy the original data hunk to
a new location.  Next you have to copy all the parent's data structures
to the child.  In other words, you have to copy the complete state of
the parent process to the child process.  This can be a lot of work.
Finally, you call `vfork_resume()' which unblocks the parent so that
you now have two processes running separately from each other.

   It is important to realize that you should never `exit()' from the
parent before all `vfork()''ed children have died.  Since exiting from
the parent causes the parents code and data segments to be deallocated,
the child would find itself without code space to run on, and would
probably cause a severe machine crash!

   So always call at least `wait (0)' before returning from the parent.

   For an example of how this works, see jobs.c from the pdksh source
distribution.  It's a kind of poor-man's `fork()'.

   The third case I've come across that couldn't easily be ported were
programs that dump their state to a new file.  Emacs does this, as does
GNU Common Lisp.  The idea is that such a program will read lots of
packages, and then dump itself to a new file.  That new file can in
turn be executed, and you will no longer have to load all those
packages.  All this assumes that when you load a program, all the code
and data ends up at the same memory address.  Something that is true
for Unix, but not for the Amiga due to the lack of virtual memory.

   However, if someone wants to do a port of such a program, please
contact me as I have developed a technique to implement this.  At
least, I've made this work with a small test program.  I've tried to
use it with GNU Common Lisp, but time constraints prevented me from
developing this further.

   The last problematic category I've seen is GNU Emacs.  This program
assumes that all the data it allocates will always end up in a
continuous memory block, and that the upper 8 bits of each memory
address are always the same.  The Amiga, however, can have multiple
memory blocks positioned at various places in memory.  While there is a
GNU Emacs port, this port does assume this limitation and if you have
an Amiga with many memory blocks (as I had) GNU Emacs may easily crash.
No easy solution exists.

Debuggers
=========

   GDB is the GNU debugger, and Fred Fish is the port maintaineer for
it.  It is useable now with ixemul-based programs, though there are
still some bugs to be worked out (it has problems when run in emacs
because of the UNIX style pathnames it uses).  Read the documentation
for more information.  The source archive will probably contain more
amiga-specific information if it's needed.

   If you start gdb with the -enforcer option, then the program you are
debugging will automatically stop and drop into the debugger as soon as
an Enforcer hit occurs.  This is obviously very useful.

   Any debugger that can handle the stabs format should work.  If you
know of any such, let me know.

   Actually, amiga-gcc-port is no longer the main mailing list for gcc.
Around late 1995/early 1996, many of the subscribers of this mailing
list migrated to the ADE mailing list.  However, I think it is still
running, and you will probably get some response from someone (I
believe Phillipe is still subscribed).  If it no longer exists, please
let me know.

     The mailing list amiga-gcc-port on lists.funet.fi is run automatically,
     so you can both subscribe and unsubscribe to it simply by sending
     e-mail to the mailing list server, or mailserver program.  You can
     reach the mailserver at the address mailserver@lists.funet.fi as
     described below.  Please use the mailserver rather than the address
     amiga-gcc-port-request@lists.funet.fi (which remains valid) whenever
     you can, so that human list management work can be minimized.
       If the automated way of doing things doesn't work for you for some
     reason, please use the amiga-gcc-port-request@lists.funet.fi address
     instead, and I'll try to solve your problem manually.  Please NEVER
     send subscription or unsubscription-requests to the address
     amiga-gcc-port@lists.funet.fi as that would send your request to all
     subscribers of the mailing list.

ADE
---

   This mailing list is for general discussion about the Amiga
Developer's Environment, a project which is supported by volunteers
from the Amiga community.  There are separate lists for discussions
about specific parts of the ADE, such as ade-gcc for the GNU C
compiler.  Please use this list only for topics that are of general
interest or which do not clearly pertain to any of the other existing
lists.  Note that you do not have to subscribe to the other more
specific lists in order to post to them, if for example you have a
question about gcc and want to post it to the ade-gcc list, but don't
want to see the normal chatter that happens on a day-to-day basis in
that list.

   Because of the hard work from a number of members of the Amiga
community, we now have a large body of development tools and other
packages that have been ported to the Amiga and are available in both
source and binary form.  The ADE is available via ftp at
ftp.ninemoons.com:pub/ade/....

   We welcome mirrors and will list them here as they come on line.
The ADE will also eventually be available on CD-ROM as part of the new
series of developer oriented CD-ROMs expected to be released by Cronus
in the first quarter of 1996.

   Although the ADE started out as ports of tools covered by the GNU
General Public License, the GNU Library General Public License, or some
code covered by the "Berkeley License", it certainly isn't limited to
those.  Any package which is available in source is eligible to be part
of the ADE.

   One of the goals of the ADE is to have a completely self hosting
environment.  I.E. that everything within it be compilable by the GNU C
compiler or other provided compilers.  It should be possible for the
recipient of these utilities to make whatever changes or bug fixes they
want in any piece of code, and then rebuild and use that fixed version
(and hopefully send those changes back for integration into future
releases).

------------

   This list is for discussion of projects that people are working on
related to the ADE.  This might include, for example, projects to
extend various ADE tools to make them more AmigaDOS friendly, projects
to port tools which are not currently part of the ADE but are intended
to become part of it once ported, etc.  The current projects list can
be found at <ftp.amigalib.com:pub/ade/PROJECTS>.

   If you are looking for an interesting project to do, and you have not
already been monitoring this list for a while, you should first check
the projects list to see if the project you are interested in is
already being worked on.  If you don't find it there, then post to this
list asking if anyone is already working on something similar or would
like to collaborate on this project.  When you have defined a project
to work on and are reasonably certain of the details of the project,
send email to the maintainer of the projects list so that it can be
included in the list.

   Note that there may be rewards offered for certain projects that are
deemed to be of importance to the overall evolution of the ADE.

   If you subscribe to this list, you should also subscribe to the

`-resident' option
------------------

   	    The last version in which this worked was 2.3.3.  Hence, you'll
need to get that version if you want to compile a program you can
easily make resident.

   	    Of course, you can always write your code to be resident, it
just takes a little more effort (see above).

   	    This problem is fixed in 2.7.0.

spilled register
----------------

   [Kamil Iskra]

   If you compile AmigaOS-specific sources which use direct OS calls
through `inlines', in some cases compiler might refuse to compile your
source and write:

     fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
     This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
     statements or clauses.

   Expression does not have to be very complex. For example, this simple
source produces the problem:

     #include <proto/intuition.h>
     
     struct IntuitionBase *IntuitionBase;
     struct EasyStruct esg;
     
     STRPTR GetString(struct EasyStruct*);
     
     void easyreq(void)
     {
        struct EasyStruct es={sizeof(struct EasyStruct)};
        es.es_Title=GetString(&esg);
        es.es_GadgetFormat=GetString(&esg);
        EasyRequestArgs(0, 0, 0, 0);
     }

   Yeah, I know this code doesn't make sense, but I wanted to make it as
simple as possible :-).

   With this source, the problem appears when GCC is invoked with
`-fbaserel' (and optimization turned on, if you use `inlines' from
Aminet GCC 2.7.0).

   This seems to be caused by the fact that GCC runs out of registers in
such cases. In the above source, `EasyRequestArgs()' uses registers
`a0'-`a3' as its parameters and `a6' as a pointer to `IntuitionBase'.
`a4' is used by `-fbaserel', `a5' is a frame pointer and `a7' -- stack
pointer, so all address registers are used.

   It is hard to say whether this is a bug. Compiler can behave
strangely if too many of its registers are used, this is described in
GCC manual. One thing is sure: this worked well in the past and no
longer works with the current GCC releases (2.7.x).

   In some cases simplifying expressions might help. For example, try to
define more local variables for function arguments, split function into
two, smaller ones etc.

   If nothing helps, or if you don't want to modify the source code too
much, there is an ultimate solution: you have to force the OS-call that
causes problems not to be inlined.

   If you use `inlines' distributed with Aminet GCC 2.7.0, you have to
change the name of the function in `inlines'. The most neat way to
achieve this seems to be using preprocessor. In the above source, you
should do:

     #define EasyRequestArgs _EasyRequestArgs
     #include <proto/intuition.h>
     #undef EasyRequestArgs

   This way stub from `libamiga.a' will be used instead of `inline'
call.

   Newer GCC versions have new `inlines'. The workaround described
above will work, too, but GCC will generate a warning about redefined
symbol. To get rid of it, just do not add the `#define' line. So, in
the above source, you should do:

     #include <proto/intuition.h>
     #undef EasyRequestArgs

   However, you'll loose one of features of new inlines -- local library
bases. There's nothing you can do about it, I'm afraid.

How does the GPL affect programs compiled by GCC?
*************************************************

   [Niklas Hallqvist]
         If I compile one of my sources with gcc, do I have to
     distribute it under the GPL? I'm not using any GNU libraries or
     startup or anything.  My interpretation of the GPL is that i
     don't have to, but one of the teacher (lecturers?) say that I
     have to. Who's right?

   You are.  The GPL (and LGPL) only covers distributed code, not code
generated by tools which are GPL:ed. As there are code which get linked
by GCC distributed with GCC, libgcc.a, one might think that the GPL
would apply to generated code, but no, libgcc.a is written without GPL
just to enable that use of the GNU compiler.  Think about it, several
object-only commercial applications including OSes are compiled by GCC
for enhanced performance, would they do that if they had to give up
their objectcode-only policy?  The key behind the GPL is that no code
based on work GPLed, should be locked to to that specific compilation,
but the user should be able to customize the GPLed code as he wants to
and recompile.  You are still allowed to protect your own source as you
see fit.  For example, let's say you use som LGPLed library libfoo.a in
your application app.  When you distribute it you must also distribute
a linkable objectfile app.o which, when linked with the distibuted
libfoo.a (with source) generates app.  If the end-user wants, he should
be able to customize libfoo, and relink it with app.o to get a
customized app.  It's not a very severe limitation on distribution
rights IMHO.

   Remember that the (L)GPL was written to give programmers more
Freedom, not to limit their chance of protecting their own work.  As
long as their own work is clearly delimited from others GPLed work, it's
perfectly OK to keep a separate copyright policy on it.

   In your case, your lecturer has misunderstood the intentions of the
(L)GPL which is easy to do.  These discussions come up ever so often
because of the legaleze used to express the GPL.  Too bad many get the
GPL wrong, as rumours like "you cannot use GNU products for business
work" severly harms the usage of GNU products.  To name a few uses of
GCC where the program did NOT fall under the GPL:  Dell Unix SVR4,
NextStep & some OSF/1 port.  Tell your lecturer about these, and ask
him why he thinks the GPL prevents them to be sold during other than
GPL conditions?  I ask you to actually convince him he was wrong as it
is harmful for the programming society that such misconceptions exist.

   [This is where I'd like to put a list of libraries that are GPLed.]

===========================

   lcc is the retargetable compiler for ANSI C described in our book `A
Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation' (Benjamin Cummings,
1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1), which will be available in December 1994.
lcc is in production use at Princeton University and AT&T Bell
Laboratories.

   The public distribution directory contains the following files.

   README	this file.

   install.{ps,txt} 	describes the distribution and gives installation
instructions. install.ps is the PostScript generated from 	the
HTML document, install.html, which is included in the 	the distribution.

   X.Y.tar.{Z,gz} 	a compressed tar files for the distribution of
version X.Y, 	e.g., 3.0.tar.Z the tar file compressed with
compress. This 	distribution includes user documentation, the
front end, the 	driver program, code generators for the SPARC,
MIPS R3000 and 	x86, and the code-generator generator that
produced them. A 	.gz file is the tar file compressed with gzip instead
of compress.

   The distribution is available via `anonymous' ftp from
ftp.cs.princeton.edu (128.112.152.13) in the directory pub/lcc.
Obtaining and extracting the distribution into its own directory is
accomplished by the following commands. Replace `3.0' with the latest
version, which is the only one typically available; versions like
`3.0a' identify minor updates and versions like `3.1beta' identify
pre-releases (which might be incomplete). As suggested, use your login
as the password, and use ftp's binary transfer mode.

   mkdir lcc cd lcc ftp ftp.cs.princeton.edu anonymous yourlogin cd
pub/lcc binary get 3.0.tar.Z dist.tar.Z quit zcat dist.tar | tar xpof -
rm dist.tar.Z
