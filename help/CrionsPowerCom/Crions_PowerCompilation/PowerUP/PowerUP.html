A few days ago orgin showed me the grabs of a press release from Phase 5 digital products that

was in german. I have no clue if it is legit but the facts seem right and so does the style of the 

document. I have translated it into english for the rest of the world, any translation errors are

not my responsibility (I am neither German nor English) so if you want to be sure about what

you read better take a crash course in german and read these four pages (

<A HREF="http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~eric/powerup1.gif">1</A>,

<A HREF="http://www.stack.urc.tue.nl/~eric/powerup4.gif">4</A>). That were found on 

<A HREF="http://barbar.uib.no/">the Moccamachines homepage</A>. Anyway, they are 

nice to read, good for morale, so have a look if you want.

If you belong to the group of<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de"> AMIGA</A>-Users that have

their eyes set on tomorrow, we have good news for you. There 

is life after the 68000 for the<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de"> AMIGA</A>.</H3>

Ever since it was founded phase 5 digital products has played a leading role in innovative

design of <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A> products. In 1993 they created the 

Fastlane Z3, the first Zorro-III-DMA controller and in 1994 they build the Cyberstorm 060, the first 68060-board

for <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A>-systems world wide. In 1995 they created the

CyberVision64 with its CyberGraphX-Software, together they defined the new graphics standard for

<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A>-systems. They were also responsible for the 

BLIZZARD-boards for the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/gb/Produkte/A1200.html">AMIGA 1200</A>

, this board is currently in its 4th generation and sets the standard for value and performance. These 

successes were possible because of our experienced development team, that has been working with

the AMIGA ever since the arrival of the legendary A1000 some 10 years ago. WIth the PowerUP-Program

phase 5 digital products brings all its knowledge together into one sensational project, one with which 

in 1996 a new decisive innovative step is taken into the next 10 years of <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA </A>computing. The 

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC">PowerPC-RISC</A>-processor will be the new heart of

 the<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de"> AMIGA</A>.

<HR>

<H2>Life after the 68000... </H2>

The top of the current line of processors used in the<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de"> AMIGA</A> is the 68060-Processor, it is used

in products like the Cyberstorm 060/50, the Blizzard 1260 or the Blizzard 2060. Although this

processor offers very good performance, it is the best choice for Power-users that want to

upgrade their system at this time, further expansion with this line of processors is not possible 

because the 68060 is the last in its series. Even running the processors at higher clockspeeds

will only provide marginal improvement.

<HR>

<H2>Only Power will help in the long run</H2>

They way out of this performance limit is the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC">PowerPC-RISC</A>-Processors that will

form the bridge from the 68k-Processors into the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA </A>future. With 

its high performance, good pricetag and innovative capabilities of both <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola</A> 

and <A HREF="http://www.IBM.com">IBM</A>, who promote the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-architecture

as an alternative for the common PC-processor, the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-processor line brings the solution that will  

give the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA </A>a position in the future as one

 of the most powerfull desktop-workstations available.

Even better; because of the combination of this new generation of processors and

the unique capabilities of the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA </A>the performace of this computer can bring

many different applications into new heights. The various available and new to come

versions of the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC </A>will bring the right perfermance for the right price 

for every user. With its fast RISC architecture and good floating point performance the

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC-Processors </A>are more than ready to take on the most demanding tasks in the

fiellds of Multimedia, 3D, Image processing. Video editing, Rendering and animation.

<HR>

<H2>Hardware for the next century</H2>

As new heart for the AMIGA the 

PowerBoards from phase 5 digital products will be available halfway in 1996. Initially 

two types of PowerPC-processors will be used. In the lower price range

 the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/library/literature/fs/603e.html">MP603e-processor</A> with

a clockrate of 100 MHz and upward will be employed. In the proffessional high end boards

the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/products/semiconductor/desktop/604.html">MPC604-processor </A> also

at 100 MHz and upwards will be used. For 1996 both versions will be sold at up to 150 MHz. 

Apart from these two boards new board using even more powerfull 

members of the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A> familly, right upto the real 64-Bit

 <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/products/semiconductor/desktop/620.html">MPC620-processor</A> 

with clockrates of up to 300 MHz, are in development. In the, not to far, future

these will bring new levels of performance to the<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de"> AMIGA</A>. Apart from using the

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-processors the Powerboards from phase 5 will be equipped with a

variety of new technical developments. 64 Bit wide memory expansions are

as obvious as a fast 64-bit Local bus-system with an optional PCI-bridge. These

will guarantee good high performance expansion possibilities for the Powerboards. 

<BR>

Powerboards from phase 5 will be available, according to performance, in the

price range from <A HREF="http://www.dna.lth.se/cgi-bin/kurt/rates?DEM">DM1000,- up to DM2000,-</A>. 

They will be available for the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/gb/Produkte/A1200.html">AMIGA 1200</A>,

 AMIGA 3000 and the<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/gb/Produkte/A4000T.html"> AMIGA 4000</A>. They are delivered in

the usual phase 5 high quality and compatibility and will be delivered with

an extensive system software package and CyberGraphX 3.0 native.

<HR>

<H2>A program overview</H2>

The PowerUP-program from phase 5 digital products has as goal the development

of a complete and trouble free upgrade for existing 68k-based <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A>-systems using a 

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A> solution. Apart from developing a powerfull hardware solution for a variety

of <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A>-systems this also includes the modification of the operating system for use

with the new <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-processors.

An experienced team of system programmers is working on these neccesary modifications,

these include the translation of the Exec- and Multitasking routines into 

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A> native

code. This code will work as basis from which an overlaying 68k-emulator will run the existing

operating system from version 3.0 and upwards. Because of the native coding of vital

exec- and multitasking routines a high over-all system performance is guarantueed. The 

other operating system functions will initially be run in the fully compatible emulation, 

during the development of later versions new function-libraries will be optimised in 

native <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A> code.

<HR>

<H2>CyberGraphX 3.0 Native</H2>

In order to deal with a major performance lag right from the beginning,

a new version of the well known CyberGraphX-software is developed for

the PowerUP-project. This package will be available in <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC </A>native code and

will be responsible for the graphic control of GFX-cards and also - new in version

3.0 - for the AGA-Chipset of the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/gb/Produkte/A1200.html">A1200 </A>and

 <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/gb/Produkte/A4000T.html">A4000</A>. Because of the high demands of

graphical output of todays multimedia applications on the CPU power of a computer

the <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC </A>version

 of CyberGraphX guarantuee a big rise in performance

using the full capabilities of modern RISC <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-Processors.

Further CyberGraphX will be expanded with a range of new routines for 3D-

and multimedia applications, these will allow for a whole new generation of applications 

on the present <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA </A>platform. 

The hardware independent availability of powerfull

3D-routines and multimedia functions for audio and video will allow Software

producers to easily create programs that will run on varius hardware configurations.

This will have a positive influence on the popularity of the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA </A>platform and will

lead to a Software Boom of unknown proportions in both the fields of serious 

applications and games of a new generation.

<HR>

<H2>We are not alone</H2>

Right from the start of the PowerUP-project a wide front of Software developers, for instance

Almathera (Photogenics), Maxon Computer, ProDad, Softwood and many others, have been

actively supporting the PowerUP project through redesigning their applications for the new

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-processors. With the expected support of more widespread Software developers

a large variety of extremely powerfull applications, right from the start of the market

entrance of the Powerboards, is expected.

<BR>

Combined with the PowerUP-project phase 5 digital products has taken extensive measures 

to support software developers. Evaluation boards will be available for commercial 

developers from the beginning of 1996 in order to support the software development on

 <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A> 

platforms using a <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-processor. 

Software tools and development systems are being

prepared by phase 5 digital products and partnerfirms. Commercial developers will get

total support from phase 5 digital products. The development of strategically important

applications will also be supported directly by <A HREF="http://www.motorola.com">Motorola</A>.

<HR>

<H2>Investing in new technology</H2>

What should AMIGA-users do when they need more performance today, and can not

wait for six to eight months for the market entry of the new PowerBoard-generation.

Phase 5 has thought of these people and offers fitting upgrade solutions. All customers

that have bought a 68k-based processor board of phase 5 after 01-09-1995 will

get, on showing a copy of their bill of puchase, special upgrade offers when purchasing

a PowerPC baser processor board<B> <A NAME="">(*)</A></B>. For owners of high cost 68060-boards

an even better trade-in-program is planned, this will make upgrading to the new

Powerboards even easier. This program will allow people that need more power now

to invest their money safely withouth having to worry about the future.

 As you can see: we are here to serve. <BR>

<H5>(*) The upgrade program will be valid for all registred owners who have purchased

a 68k-Turbocard from the phase 5 series at an autorised dealer or from phase 5 digital

products directly; buyers of second hand processor boards can not apply to this

upgrade program.</H5>

<HR>

<H2>All this just dreams of the future?</H2>

<B>Yes</B>, but for a future that is very close. This future is allready happening today,

it is supported by huge investments. The PowerUP program will result in

<A HREF="http://www.motorola.com/SPS/PowerPC/">PowerPC</A>-based

processor boards for a variety of amiga systems. With the innovative and 

powerfull capabilities of phase 5 digital products, in its role as one of the

leading developers in the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">AMIGA</A> world, you have the assurance that the 

latest and best technology will be available for your<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de"> AMIGA</A>.
