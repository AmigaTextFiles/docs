<h2><a name="topic0">Why should you care about an operating system?</a></h2>
<p>
When you turn on the tap to get a glass of water, you
don't think about the maze of pipes, pumps, and valves
that bring the water to you.  The same should be true of
the information systems you use to run your business; they
should deliver the information you need, when you need it and
in the form you require, without demanding expertise in the
"plumbing" of the underlying operating system.
<p>
However, your choice of an operating system does have a major
impact on how you'll be able to run your business; it can
become a help or a hindrance.  You should care about your
operating system only insofar as it provides you the ability
to get on with real work.
<p>
AIX<sup>(r)</sup> Version 4.1 from IBM<sup>(r)</sup>
is designed to support real work for real people.

</ul>
<h2><a name="topic2">A mature UNIX-based operating system</a></h2>
<p>
AIX Version 4.1 is an industrial strength
UNIX<sup>(r)</sup>-based operating system, with roots in
UNIX System V and Berkeley Software Distribution 4.3
(4.3 BSD(tm)), and conformance to the Portable Operating
System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX(tm))
IEEE 1003.1-1990.  Version 4.1 is consistent with IBM's
Open Blueprint client/server computing model, will be
submitted for XPG4 evaluation and is designed to provide
full compliance with the emerging Spec 1170 standard.
<p>
However, while standards compliance is essential, it's the
added qualities that make the difference between a lab
environment and a commercially viable platform.
<p>
Building upon innovations IBM has brought to the table,
such as Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and Journalled File
Systems (JFS), IBM continues to bolster the industrial
strength qualities of AIX.  Support for larger (over 2GB)
file systems and the capabilities to easily deinstall unused
software, optimize the use of expensive disk resources, and
take advantage of modern disk striping techniques are some
examples.
<p>
The enhancements introduced with AIX 4.1 go deeper than new
function.  The very structure of AIX has evolved to meet the
needs of today's client/server environment.
<p>
The AIX client and server packaging options let you choose,
and pay for, only the AIX you need.  More flexible and granular
licensing options let you individually select software,
support, publications, and media (including CD-ROM) while
better matching costs to your usage.  iFOR/LS, a new usage
monitoring and control facility, is also provided.
<p>
These new packaging and licensing options offer potential
savings on software license costs as well as system resources
required.
<h2><a name="topic4">To be useful it must be usable</a></h2>
<p>
Many systems fall down in their efforts to shield the customer
from the "plumbing" underneath during the initial
installation of the system itself.  Here, again, IBM applies its
real world, end user environment experience to AIX Version 4.1.
<p>
AIX 4.1 installation is faster and easier with Installation
Assistant, an addition to the Visual System Manager (VSM)
graphical user interface facility, guiding the novice user
through the initial installation process.
<p>
Pre-selection of necessary operating system components reduces
the decision-making and, therefore, the expertise required of
the user.
<p>
What's more, the system automatically detects the hardware
devices attached to the system and installs only the required
device drivers
to further simplify and speed
installation.
<p>
Integrating Xwindowing capability with Motif and a new, intuitive
desktop based on the emerging Common Desktop Environment
standard enhances the system's basic usability.
<p>
An optional Wabi product provides access to a number of
Microsoft<sup>(r)</sup> Windows(tm) applications and
interfaces that PC users are accustomed to.  Also available
are 3270, 5250, and 5080 emulator products for users to access
various host
systems and separately orderable OpenGL and PEX/PHIGS API
products to support entry 3D graphics on 2D workstation hardware
and on IBM's POWER 3D accelerators.
<p>
The InfoExplorer(tm) product provides a usability bonus in the
form of on-line system documentation.  In addition, the
InfoCrafter<sup>(r)</sup> product can be used to create
and add user-specific documentation to this on-line library,
thereby eliminating the age-old problem of missing or out-of-date
manuals.
<p>
Finally, in addition to working with the interfaces and
applications they're accustomed to, users across today's
multinational companies often have an even more basic
need -- interaction with their systems using their native
languages and alphabets.  AIX 4.1 is enabled for wider
internationalization support than ever; further evidence of
IBM's continued attention to the end user in today's
global enterprises.
<h2><a name="topic5">Born to serve</a></h2>
<p>
While usability is of paramount importance to <b>clients</b>,
AIX 4.1 also provides many attributes that are key for a
<b><a name="topic6">server

<p>
These features provide all the qualities you should expect in a
premier server platform.
<h2><a name="topic7">How we manage it</a></h2>
<p>
An essential link between the client and server systems involves
tools and facilities to manage this complex environment.  The
AIX platform offers a comprehensive set of products to manage
all aspects of the system and network, including:
<ul>
<li>operations
<li>configuration
<li>storage
<li>performance
<li>capacity
<li>network
<li>installation
<li>change
<li>data
<li>problem
<li>license
</ul>
<p>
These facilities extend AIX's management capabilities across
multiple IBM and non-IBM LAN-based and mainframe systems.  The
AIX platform provides an unmatched level of coexistence and
interoperability.
<h2><a name="topic8">AIX Version 4.1: A link to the future</a></h2>
<p>
No group of users is more important to IBM than our existing
AIX customers.  As such, a prerequisite for the introduction of
AIX Version 4.1 was a clear migration path for systems,
applications, and users.
<p>
For the majority of existing AIX 3.2.5-based applications, upward
binary compatibility is provided.  Documentation, education, and
services are available to help migrate remaining applications
where compatibility issues exist.
<p>
If you are migrating from the AIX 3.2.5 operating system itself
to AIX 4.1, migration tools help smooth the transition.
<p>
Like AIX 3.2.5, AIX 4.1 supports common mode compilation, a
means for application developers to ensure their applications
can be run unchanged across all RISC System/6000 systems,
whether POWER, POWER2, or PowerPC based.
<p>
AIX 4.1 will support an upcoming new line of PowerPC-based
systems, as well as the forthcoming RISC System/6000 Symmetric
Multi-
processing (SMP) systems.  These additions will extend
AIX's support over an unprecedented range of
processor power, all on a single,
binary-compatible version of AIX.
<p>
Through the immediate support of most existing AIX 3.2.5
applications, assistance for migrating remaining applications,
common mode operation to support all RISC System/6000
processors, and migration tools for the operating system itself,
AIX 4.1 offers substantial returns for minimal investment.
<p>
For developers, the AIX 4.1 platform offers a comprehensive
set of
traditional compilers, development tools, and an integrated
SOMobjects Base Toolkit to begin exploring the reusability
and portability advantages of object technology.  With the
planned additions of OpenDoc and Taligent framework
technologies to its platform, AIX 4.1 will become the premier
object oriented programming development environment.
<p>
OpenDoc and Taligent frameworks are also integral
<b><a name="topic9">Workplace
</a></b>
technologies.  Version 4.1 will become the focus for continued
AIX integration of Workplace technologies.
<h2><a name="topic10">Summary: AIX Version 4.1 technology as an investment</a></h2>
<p>
As with any other business investment, operating system technology
must be viewed based on its potential returns.  For an operating
system, the returns can be operational enhancements or reduced
costs.  These, in turn, can result in a significant competitive
advantage for your business.
<p>
So the question becomes, what
specific benefits can be realized
through IS technology, in this case, AIX Version 4.1?  Some
potential examples include:
<ul>
<li>Lower system software costs, through AIX 4.1's new packaging
and licensing structure
<li>More rapid, flexible application development through object
oriented programming technology
<li>Lower hardware costs through the improved price/performance
offered by PowerPC-based systems
<li>Extended application availability using advanced emulation
technology to enable users to access many applications from
a single system
<li>Lower information storage costs through AIX-based storage
management products (such as ADSM, FSF, Unitree, and
Legato Networker) and AIX features (such as new client
packaging, JFS fragmentation, and smaller block sizes)
<li>Flexibility and productivity improvements inherent in a
distributed client/server environment.  Use of the AIX-based
tools, components, and products can enable migration to
client/server, putting information in the hands of those that
need it
<li>Productivity improvement by minimizing the expertise required
to use and administer information systems through "user
centered" technology
<li>Investment protection through the ability to add AIX systems
in concert with existing systems and networking facilities
<li>Rapid, flexible growth, with the same AIX operating environment
supported across a wide range of systems
<li>Higher service levels for users through higher system
availability pr
