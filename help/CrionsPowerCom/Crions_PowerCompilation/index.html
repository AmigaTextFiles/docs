<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the Amiga users don't have a clue of what PowerPC means, and what it means for the Amiga in particular. And it is my -HOPE- that the ones that read this will know
alot more about it than they did before. The information about DEC's Alpha is just here to somewhat give
a clue of how fast for example a 300Mhz version of the PPC 620 is. The documents come from different sources on the web and they have links in them that will be active if you are connected to the net while reading this. But reading this offline  in IBrowse or any other html 3 compatible browser is
ofcourse Ok (and alot cheaper)...</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was all I'm afraid. If you have something that you feel would benefit this Information Compilation about PowerAmiga/PPC, don't hesitate to mail me at <B>crion@canit.se</B>. Especially updated information is appreciated as I feel that everything isn't as up-to-date as it could be. Real Test Benchmarks is interesting, as corporations rather put in an "estimated" value since it looks more attractive for the buyer... *ntel is especially good at this... Yes you're right; - English is not my native language..but I hope you had an interesting time reading this anyway... </P><CENTER><H2>The Future is Bright, the Future is AMIGA!</H2></CENTER><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Crions PowerAmiga/PPC information compilation $ver:1.3 © CRION 1996</P>
