<H3>The Mightiest Desktop Computer Yet</H3>

Nothing compares to the computing power of the BTG ACTion AXP275. This 
masterpiece unleashes Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha AXP microprocessor, 
PCI local bus technology, and Microsoft Windows NT onto the desktop. 
Capable of peak execution rates of 555 MIPS, its performance is equivalent 
to a supercomputer. The AXP275 zips through the most power-hungry 
applications at blinding speeds. Imagine what you can do with this 
much computing power!<R>


<H3>The Fastest Processor in the World</H3>

Digital's DECchip 21064A microprocessor is a 64-bit, 0.5-micron, CMOS-based, 
super-scalar, super-pipelined processor using dual-instruction issue 
and a cycle time of 275 MHz. The Alpha AXP 64-bit RISC architecture 
is designed with emphasis on speed, multiple instruction issue, multiple 
processors, and multiple operating systems. Sixteen KiloBytes data and 16 KiloBytes 
 instruction caches are integrated on-chip.<R>


<H3>State-of-the-Art System Performance</H3>

What good would all this power be if the rest of the system couldn't 
keep up? That's why the AXP275 uses the highest quality components 
available. It comes standard with 2MB external cache and 32MB of 36-bit 
ECC memory which is expandable to 512MB now, and 1 GB in the future. 
BTG uses only PCI components to eliminate bottlenecks and maximize 
the performance of the CPU and subsystems. Number 9 Corporation's 
lightning-fast GXE64 Pro 4MB PCI graphics engine, features the S3 
Vision964 processor. And Nokia displays are the finest available. 
The Fast SCSI 2 controller is integrated onto the motherboard, and 
the Seagate hard drives offer some of the fastest throughput in the 
industry. A Plextor quad-speed CD-ROM and a Cogent PCI ethernet interface 
are also included with each ACTion AXP275. Fast/wide SCSI 
and Fast Ethernet enhancements are under development.
