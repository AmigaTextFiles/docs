<H1>The PowerPC 603
RISC Microprocessor</H1>

Product Description</H2>
<P>
The PowerPC 603e(tm) microprocessor is a 32-bit implementation of the PowerPC(tm) family of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) microprocessors. The PowerPC 603 microprocessor provides both industry leading RISC performance and power management to the notebook and energy sensitive desktop markets. High performance is achieved through concurrent execution of up to five instructions in five parallel execution units: the fixed-point unit, floating point unit, branch unit, system unit and load/store unit. Low-power is delivered through a low power static design and dynamic power management with three power saving modes. It is this industry segment leading combination of high performance and low power that offers a competitive edge to the system developers using the PowerPC 603 microprocessor.
<P>
The 100 Mhz version extends the performance leadership of the PowerPC 603 microprocessor in notebooks and energy sensitive desktops. The design, enhanced for higher speed and performance, contains twice the cache size of the original PowerPC 603 microprocessor and extends its speed from 80 Mhz to 100 MHz.
<P>
The PowerPC Architecture(tm) is derived from IBM's Performance Optimized With Enhanced RISC (POWER(tm)) architecture The PowerPC Architecture shares all the benefits of POWER and is optimized for single-chip implementations.
