<h2>Product Description</h2>
The IBM Microelectronics PowerPC 601 microprocessor is the first 
implementation of the PowerPC family of Reduced Instruction Set 
Computer (RISC) microprocessors It is a 32-bit implementation of the 
PowerPC Architecture and achieves its performance through concurrent 
execution of up to three instructions per cycle in its three parallel 
execution units: the Fixed-Point unit, Floating-Point unit, and the Branch 
Processing unit. The PowerPC product strategy addresses a broad range of 
customer requirements: performance optimization at the high end, extreme 
cost-sensitivity at the low end, and peak price-performanee in the mid 
range.
<P>
The IBM Microelectronics 100MHz PowerPC 601 processor is a higher 
performance processor which is functionally identical to the original 
PowerPC 601 processor. The 100MHz processor was developed in a 0.5&#181 
CMOS technology with a high performance 2.5v, 0.25&#181m Leff device and 
multilevel 1.8&#181m pitch wiring capability to achieve a higher performance, 
lower power, and smaller die size processor.
<P>
Compared to the original PowerPC 601, the 100MHz PowerPC 601 is 
packaged in a physically identical 304 pin Ceramic Quad Flat Pack with 
improved electrical characteristics to minimize noise at the higher 
performance. Input, output, and ground pin locations are identical to the 
original PowerPC 601 processor. Positive power supply pins are divided 
between 2.5V pins for internal circuits and either 5.0V or 3.3V pins for 
the driver and receiver circuits.
<P>
Input and output signal levels arc identical to the original PowerPC 601 
processor through the development of special driver and receiver circuits 
that interface with the 2.5V internal eireuits. A more sensitive clock 
receiver circuit was also developed to interface with the higher 
performance clock signals.
<P>
The PowerPC Architecture is derived from the IBM Performance 
Optimized with Enhanced RISC (POWERtm) architecture. The 
PowerPC Architecture shares all of the benefits of the Power 
Architecture but is optimized for single-chip implementations.
