<H2>Product Description</H2>

   The PowerPC 602(tm) microprocessor is a 32-bit implementation of the
   PowerPC(tm) family of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
   microprocessors. It is intended for use in portable and small form factor
   uniprocessor applications such as PDAs. It achieves its performance
   through the concurrent execution of up to two instructions per cycle in
   its four parallel execution units: the fixed-point unit, floating point unit,
   branch processing unit, and the load/store unit. The low-power design
   of the PowerPC 602 microprocessor, and the power management
   features it incorporates, offer competitive advantages in performance
   oriented, power-sensitive portable applications.
<P>
   The PowerPC Architecture(tm) is derived from the <I>IBM Performance
   Optimized With Enhanced RISC</I> (POWER(tm)) architecture. The
   PowerPC Architecture shares all the benefits of the POWER
   Architecture(tm) but is optimized for single-chip implementation. The
   PowerPC architecture is a major component of the PowerOpen(tm)
   environment.
<P>
   The PowerPC Architecture offers a complete range of processor
   solutions for computing needs from embedded applications through
   multi-processor mainframe systems. Its unique combination of high
   performance, wide operating systems applicability, and small die size
   has resulted in its unprecedented success in the RISC computing
   market.
