The installation script requires Commodore's standard Installer utility.
In order to keep the size of the release archive down, the Installer is
not included here.

If you have Workbench 2.1, 3.0 or higher you will find Installer on your
Workbench installation disk.  Simply copy it to your 'SYS:Utilities'
directory (or anywhere in your Workbench command path).

The Installer is freely distributable, so you might be able to find it on a
local BBS. It can also be found on Fish-disk #870.

It is also possible to drag the guide icon manually, but the installation
script offers several advantages.
