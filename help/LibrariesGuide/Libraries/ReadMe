*************************************************************************
   The  original file  I've found  in  `aminet/docs/help/' was a standard
plain file:  short, printable ... readable ..., but  not the  best for  a
quick  consultation. That is why I've translated it to an AmigaGuide for-
mat: a bit longer, more readable, easy to use, ...   8)
The translation  was made with the  great aid of `AGW' by David L. McPaul
(you may find in `aminet/text/hyper/AGWriter???.lha').

P.S.: the  guide has several nodes linked to AutoDocs (in the  AmigaGuide
      format). Then you  are supposed to have propely set AmigaGuide path
      env (try `aminet/text/hyper/GuidePrefs.lha'  if you are not so con-
      fident with  this  issue), and  to  have  the AmigaGuide version of
      AutoDocs.
      You  are also  supposed to  have the assignment `TEXT-INCLUDE:' set
      too. Of course you also need include-files.

   I (the AmigaGuide-er) may be reached at the following addresses:
