@NODE PROC "Amigas and Processors"

 The Amiga at the present uses the Motorola 68000 CISC (Complex Instruction
 Set  Chip)  series  at the heart of the system. The Amiga Operating System
 (AmigaOS,  Workbench  or  AmigaDOS)  requires  this  processor  as all the
 programs and OS routines are compiled for that particular chip.

 The  Amiga  has a number of models and each has its own processor, as time
 has progressed since the A1000, newer models featured faster processors:

 The newer Chip Sets required a faster processor as more colours need to be
 processed  and  more  data  moved  around  so  Commodore selected a 32-bit
 processor  for  that  task  ie the 68020 and above. Commodore also used EC
 (Economy)  versions  of  some processors which have some features missing,
 usually no MMU and smaller addressing space.

 The  faster processor the Amiga can have is the 68060 which is at least 40
 times faster than the original 68000.

 Although  the  clock  speed hasn't increased that much, the speed has been
 increased  through  the use of 32 bit architecture rather than 16 bit, the
 use  of  larger and faster caches, inclusion of FPU (Floating Point Units)
 and  MMU  (Memory Management Units) onto the chip itself and better memory
 and instruction processing.

 For  the Amiga to improve a new processor is to be used. For example, when
 Motorola  finished  developing  the 68000 range, they designed the PowerPC
 processor.  The  PowerPC  is  a RISC or Reduced Instruction Set Chip which
 means  that it has fewer complex instructions than CISC chips, it has more
 registers  and it can do those instructions much much faster at higher and
 higher speeds.

 For the Amiga to use such a processor requires two things:

 1. Programs to be written and compiled for that processor

 2. The Operating System has to support and  even rewritten in PowerPC code
    to make full use of the PowerPC chip.

 There  are three operating systems in use that are written for the PowerPC
 and they are:

                   MacOS (System 7, 8)
                   Windows NT 3.x (now discontinued)
                   BeOS
                   Solaris 2.4
                   Linux

 We  have  yet to see a version of AmigaOS for the PowerPC other than the PPC
 library and WarpOS addons.

@ENDNODE
@NODE ACCL "List of Accelerators"

 For  the  Amiga  to  grow  and  expand, some Amiga companies have produced
 Accelerator cards which replace your old processor with a faster version.

 Currently,  the  AGA  machines  and  the  A600  have  the best support for
 accelerators.  Accelerators  for  the  older  OCS/ECS Amigas are no longer
 being  produced  as  they  are  less common and not considered worth while
 supporting.

 There are currently five major makes of Accelerators:

                         Blizzard by Phase 5/DCE
                         Cyberstorm by Phase 5/DCE
                         Apollo
                         Magnum
                         Viper

 There  are  some  other  makes  but  they  are  less common these days and
 unlikely  to  be  sold  anymore. This is NOT a complete list as some older
 cards may been left out.

 @{u}68000@{uu}
 16-bit  processor  (bus  is  16  bit, registers are 32bit internally), can
 address up 9MB RAM. Runs at 7Mhz.

 @{u}68010@{uu}
 Faster  version of 68000 at 14Mhz. Very few differences between it and the
 68000. The MOVE SR,<dest> instruction does not work this or higher processors.

 @{u}68020@{uu}
 New  32-bit  wide  processor  running  at 14MHz. Has 256 bytes Instruction
 Caches  to  speed  up  instruction flow. Allows a co-processor such as the
 68881 or 68882 FPU units. MMU also comes on a seperate chip.

 The  68EC020  in  the  A1200  is  a  24bit  (rather  than  the full 32bit)
 addressing range.

 @{u}68030@{uu}
 32-bit processor running from 16 to 50MHz. Has Data and Instruction caches
 and includes Burst mode (reads consecutive bytes very fast).

 68030 can use 68881/68882 FPU co-processors. Includes MMU on some versions
 esp. the 33, 50MHz, the EC versions do not have a MMU.

 @{u}68040@{uu}
 32-bit  processor  with in built FPU and MMU for maximum speed efficiency.
 Includes  two  4K  caches  for  even faster speeds. Clocks at either 25 or
 40Mhz. Includes Copyback made which allows cache memory to be written back
 to main memory (causes problems with self-modifying code).

 NB:  There's  an  LC  version  with no built in FPU unit (mainly occurs on
 Macs).  The FPU has fewer instructions than the 68882 chip and the missing
 instructions have to be emulated in software.

 @{u}68060@{uu}
 Similar  to  68040 with built in FPU and MMU but has two 8k Caches. Clocks
 at  either  50  or 66Mhz. Last in the 68000 series. Unlike the 68040 which
 can get very hot, the 68060 uses 3.3V and runs much cooler. Has to emulate
 some  of  the  'missing'  64 bit instructions that were present in earlier
 processors.

 @{u}PPC 603/604@{uu}
 RISC  based  processor  with  speeds  of 60MHz to 300MHz+. Some can access
 Gigabytes  of  memory.  Not compatible with 680x0 at instruction level but
 with the correct software can emulate the 680x0 at 040 speeds.

 @{u}PPC G3/G4@{uu}
 Next generation PowerPC 750 processors starting from 233Mhz with 512K or 1M 
 caches gaining at least 50% more speed.

@ENDNODE
@NODE CHOS "Choosing an Accelerator"

 Choosing  an  accelerator is based on a number of factors which may affect
 your choice:

 a) Which model of Amiga you own.

 The  A1200  and A4000 are well supported with new boards. The older Amigas
 have  a limited choice of accelerators. If accelerating your current amiga
 is  next  to impossible then upgrading your Amiga to an AGA Amiga would be
 advisable.

 It  is  inadvisable  to  run  an  040  board  on a plain A1200 as the heat
 produced by the 040 board is quite high, if you do get an 040 then leaving
 the  trapdoor  lid  off  and attaching a fan unit will make it more usable
 though. b) What software you are planning to run on it.

 Modern  games  these  days now require much faster processors. An 68030 is
 considered  to be minimum specification these days and they are very cheap
 (<£100).  High  end  Graphics  and 3D Rendering work would require a 68060
 processor  for  maximum  performance  but it is also the most expensive. A
 68040 processor would be a cheaper alternative for the best of both worlds
 (fast but cheap).

 c) How much money you are willing to spend.

 Always  include  in the price some memory, an accelerator without any Fast
 RAM  would  be  like  running a Ferrari with no petrol. If you don't own a
 SCSI card then buying the SCSI interface option should also be considered.

 d) What other expansions you have or about to buy

 Buying  a  faster  processor  is not the only way to get faster speed from
 your  Amiga.  AGA  is  considered  to  be  too slow especially for quality
 graphics.  A  good  Graphics card is considered to be essential to improve
 graphics speed.

 Floppy  disk  systems  are  a  rare  breed  these  days and a Hard disk is
 absolutely  essential,  the difference is incredible once you've installed
 one.

 e) Quality of the accelerator board.

 It  is  important  that  the  accelerator  board is well built and that it
 doesn't  crash  the  Amiga  every  five minutes. Check that your Amiga can
 handle  a  fast new processor, you may have to upgrade some other parts of
 your Amiga to get the best out of it.

 f) Acceleration isn't everything.

 An  accelerator  will  improve the speed of the programs but won't improve
 drive  speed  or graphics speed. Buying a graphics card will substantially
 improve graphics performance better than any fast processor. Some programs
 will  benefit more than others such as rendering programs which uses a lot
 of processor time.

 Getting  a better accelerator may actually speed up your drive, especially
 if you have an IDE drive, that's very dependent on the CPU. After all, the
 controller used in Amigas can only do PIO (Programmed Input/Output).

@ENDNODE
@NODE MOST "Making the Most of your Accelerator"

 An  accelerator  can  provide  more  options  and  features  than your old
 processor

  e.g. Floating Point Unit for math intense applications - e.g. Rendering

 Memory  Management  Unit  for Virtual Memory and FastROM (copies ROM image
 into  Fast  RAM  for  speedy  access)  and  using  alternative  Kickstarts
 (Soft-kicking).

 Workbench provides three methods to control features of your processor:

 a)  Early  Startup  Screen.  Allows you to turn off/on caches for backward
     compatibility with older software esp. games.

 b)  The CPU command displays your current processor settings and allow you
     to set them eg. Caches, Burst Mode, Copyback, FastROM, Traps, MMU etc.
     You will need a newer version of CPU if using an 68060 processor.

 c)  68040.library.  Patches missing CPU instructons esp. FPU functons that
     exist on the 68882 but not on the 68040. Enabled with Setpatch program

 There  are  loads  of  third  party  programs  that  can  make use of your
 accelerator:

                   PPC (WarpOS only).
   b) AIBB.        Old benchmark program. Doesn't work on PPC, 060 requires
                   CPU=68060 tooltype.
   c) SysInfo.     System benchmark and information for older Amigas only.
                   Benchmarks aren't very accurate.
   d) Speedychip.  Speeds up chipmem writes for 060.

 There  are  some commercial software available for accelerators, some come
 with the accelerator and some seperately:

 a) CPU060. Newer version of CPU command which recognises the 060 properly.

 b) CyberPatcher. Replaces missing 040/060 instructions with emulated ones.

 c) 68060.library.  Called via a dummy 68040.library to replace missing FPU
    instructions. Enabled via Setpatch.

 d) OxyPatcher.  Commercial  68060  instruction patcher.  Faster than other
    patch programs available and more compatible with some programs.

 A  lot  of  programs  these  days can come in different versions, some are
 optimised  to run faster on newer processors. The installer will allow you
 to  choose  the  best  program to install and in some cases install an FPU
 version.  You  can  achieve  big  speed  ups upgrading from a 16-bit 68000
 version  to  a  32-bit  version 020 or better and you will need an 040/060
 version for FPU functions.

@NODE POWER "PowerPC Acceleration"

 The  latest Accelerator cards now have PowerPC 603e and 604e Processors as
 well as 68040/060 processors.The most recent cards now just have a G3 PPC
processor and uses a emulator for the old 680x0 processors.

 Those who are considering buying one of these cards must realise this:

 @{b}Standard 68000 Programs will NOT run faster on the PowerPC cards except
the new G3 cards.@{ub}

 This is because Amiga programs are written in 680x0 code which the PowerPC
 cannot  run  because  it  uses a completely different instruction set. The
 Programs  must  be  written  specifically  for  the  PowerPC to run on the
 PowerPC  otherwise  they  will  run normally on the 680x0 processor on the
 card like other 68k accelerators.

 There are two different methods of running PowerPC programs on the Amiga.

 Phase  5  has a @{b}ppc.library@{uu} which has a range of functions written for the
 PPC  including  Exec  type functions for memory management and 64 bit math
 functions. PPC programs are loaded via ELFLoadSeg which resides in memory.

 @{b}WarpOS@{ub}  by  Haage  and Partner is a different system to access the PPC. It
 consists  of  the  three  libraries  powerpc.library (hardware independent
 part)  and  warp.library/warpHW.library (HAL), a manufacturer of a new PPC
 Board  has  only  to  rewrite  the  1.3 KB Sized warpHW.library to support
 WarpUP.  WarpUP  also  supports  "a  range of functions... and 64 Bit math
 functions   and   quite   some   more   things   like  memory  protection,
 Supervisormode, Cswitch, a PPC Native Message System,...)". Something like
 elfloadseg  is  not  needed, as WarpUP uses directly the fileformat of the
 Amiga, unlike ppc.library.

@NODE PROB "Common Problems"

 1. My machine keeps crashing after installing my accelerator.

 There  are  a  number  of  factors that can cause this to happen, some are
 hardware related or software related:

 Software:

 a)  You  may be trying to use software which breaks under a new processor.
     This will especially occur with WB 1.3 software, demos and games.

 b)  You are using a patch program which no longer works or trying to patch
     some thing which is incompatible.

 c)  Make  sure  that appropiate software is installed before attaching the
     board. Copy the files onto other bootable disks in case of emergency.

 Hardware:

 a)  The accelerator is using too much power. IF using a standard 23W A1200
     PSU,  it is advisable to remove  other devices or upgrade the PSU to a
     higher wattage.

 b)  The  accelerator  isn't  fitted  properly.  You  must  ensure that the
     accelerator is plugged in correctly.  For  the  A1200  it  may help to
     dismantle the casing to allow you to fit in the accelerator.

 c)  The  processor is getting too hot and it is shutting itself down (thus
     causing a crash). Make sure enough air is getting to the processor. It
     is  advisable  to  leave  the  trapdoor lid off. If using a 040 or PPC
     processor  that  a  fan  is  fitted  to the processor to keep it cool.
     Placing  the  system in a tower unit will allow for more air to get to
     the  processor.  Also,  lifting  the unit off the desk will allow more
     fresh air to get to the processor.

     If  you  are using a fan, make sure that it is spinning fully and that
     it is the right way up (it has happened to one person!).

 d)  Other  hardware  is  too  old or incompatible with the new accelerator
     card.  Check custom chip versions and upgrade them if necessary. Check
     docs for these things. This will occur on older OCS and ECS amigas.

 e)  Get  the  right  kind  of RAM. Most Amiga accelerators will use 32-bit
     Fast Paged  non-parity SIMM memory. Single sided SIMMs will fit better than
     double-sided SIMMS (chips on both sides). There are newer types of RAM
     eg. EDO and SDRAM but check with the manufacturer/dealer before buying
     these kind as may or may not work on your accelerator.

 2. My accelerator isn't as fast as it should be.

 Check that all the caches are enabled and that other features are enabled.
 Some  features  like Burst modes and Copyback can cause problems with some
 programs.  Make sure that if using a Benchmark program, that you are using
 a more recent version (AIBB and SysInfo won't work on 060 processors).
    Also, get programs such as OxyPatcher or CyberPatcher to improve FPU
 performance on 040 and 060 processors.

 3. I cannot get older software to work.

 Disable  some  of the new features of the board eg Caches and Copyback are
 the  best  ones  to disable. Disable AGA for really old games or programs,
 KILLAGA2 and Degrader are good programs to get for this. On the 060, it has 
 a SuperScalar mode, disable this with the CPU060 command or equivalent, 
 particularly with Mac emulation.

 4. The MMU doesn't work on my machine.

 The  MMU  is  only used for ROM kicking and Virtual Memory. The 68030 will
 probably  won't have it enabled on processors slower than 50MHz. The 68040
 and  060 has it inbuilt. To check that the MMU works, use a virtual memory
 type  program  to check eg GigaMem, VMM, VMEM. Anything that says EC or LC
 do not have MMUs.

 5. Can I overclock my processor to a faster speed.

 This  is  possible  by  replacing  the  clock oscillator to a faster clock
 speed.  Whether  it works and for how long depends the processor. Some can
 work  at faster speeds than others upto 10-15% faster in some cases. So it
 may  be  possible  to  speed up a 25MHZ processor to a 28Mhz clock rate, a
 33MHZ  to  37Mhz  and a 50MHz to 55Mhz. Bigger clocks speeds may cause you
 machine  to  crash  as  the processor may fail to run at the higher speed,
 reduce the clock speed if this occurs.

 6. Can I replace my processor with a different one directly.

 Only  if the new processor is pin and volt compatible. For example, it may
 be  possible to replace a 25MHz 68030 with a 50MHz 68030 if the oscillator
 AND  the  processor where changed. This is desirable if the curent chip is
 an  EC version and you can replace it will a MMU enabled version. The chip
 itself  usually  indicates  the  recommended clock speed on the end of the
 number eg 68EC030-50 for a 50Mhz 030. A 040 and 060 are pin compatible but
 the  040  runs  at  5V  and  the  060  runs at 3.3V so replacing it is not
 possible.
