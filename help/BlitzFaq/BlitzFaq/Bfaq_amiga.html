<h2>MESSAGE PORTS
<h3>
Original message by Simon Archer<br><br><br>
<p>
The below example will prompt you for a time in which to wait. Once  entered, the routine will call the timer.device and wait
for  the  specified  time.   It will then tell you when all is well.
</p><p>
It  is  a  simple  example, taken from the RKM Devices Third  Edition,  and  shows  how you should wait for a message
from  the  OS  via  message  ports.   Any device operates very similar,  including  the serial.device, which was the original
point raised IIRC.

<h2>EvWait
<h3>
Original message by Simon Archer<br><br><br>

<p>
For  anybody  who's interested, here's a proper example of how
to wait for Ctrl_C.  Compile this into an executable, and then
run  it  from  the  shell.   You  can  then either break it by
hitting  ^C  or by issuing a 'Break' with the AmigaDOS command
Break  or  with ARTM or similar.  It doesn't matter how you do
it,  all that matters is that it sleeps while it's waiting and
not running a loop!

<h2>SystemTagList
<h3>
Original message by Stephan Kortleven<br><br><br>

<p>
After  a  time  searching  for a good way to run programs from
Blitz i find a way that could help many people i think.  I did
see there are many people having troubles finding there way in
a good solution for running external programs from inside your
own  program.   This  will  do the job in all cases.  Except i
think it will only work on OS2.0+ Amiga's.
</p>

<A href="Faqlists/Systemtaglist.txt">Take a look.</A><br>

The advantage of this system is :<br>

<ul>
  <li>that we get the return code of the external program if it can't be runned, or everything else that is going wrong.
  <li>We can specified the stack of the program.
  <li>We  can  even  run  assy.   using the external amigados run
   command (com$="Run Dir dh0:"+Chr$(10)) but then we lose the
   return  codes  from  the  external program whe running with
   run.   But  it will be a save way to close our cli and quit
   the progran even there is still a task running on.  The Cli
   will  stay open untill our last task has finished using it.
   Thats why i don't use #SYS_Asynch,1.
</ul>
<p>
If  you  choose  to  use  #SYS_Asynch,1 the cli will be closed
automaticly  you  could  then  choose  some tag to let the cli
open.
</p><p>
BUT ! If you close then the cli before the external
task is finished you will have a crash.  In this case we have
to  wait  for some code at a own port whe have created.  That's
why  i find using #SYS_Asynch,0 and the external program run a
better and easyer way of doing what i wanna do.

Original example by Andrea Doimo<br>
Modified & updated by Simon Ravn<br><br><br>

<p>
The  problem  with  ScreenTags is, that it's a statement (Yak!
Acid!!), and therefore, if for some reason the screen can't be
opened, you don't know and you can't do anything about it.  So
at  the  moment  my  MovieGuide  crashes  if you try to open a
screen  using  a  ModeID  that  isn't initialized (through the
different monitor drivers).  But all that will change soon, as
I've  found  this easy solution to the problem, just using the
library-function OpenScreenTags_:

If you've got the ElmoreLibs upgrade on Bum6 installed, you
can turn DOS requesters completely off with the SHOWREQUESTERS
command. All requesters will act as if the CANCEL gadget had
been pressed, so you can construct a routine that way. Here
is an example that  will wait until a disk is inserted into
DF0: without ever bringing up a DOS requester!

This  routine  is  stripped  from  BlitzBlankPrefs  2.50.   It
doesn't  use Blitz2's ARexx-commands, but the ones from the OS
and so works.

<p>
It sends the command 'BLANK' to BlitzBlank and then prints the
resultstring ("OK").

Yeahh!!!   I've done it!!!  And it works!  And It's fast!  And

<p>
Ok,  This  program  parse  the  file "ram:aaaa" (modify as you
like)  and  will  report  if it's a shapes file, or not.  I've
assumed  that the maximum size for a shape is 640 pixels wide,
and 512 pixels tall, and obviously 1 to 8 bitplanes.
</p>
<p>
Shapes  by  0x0  pixels and 0 bitplanes can be found, when not
used.   If  any shape into the file doesn't follow these rules
the file doesn't contain shapes at all!

<A NAME="WindowPattern"></a>
<h2>WindowPattern
<h3>
Example by Simon Ravn<br>
Modified by Andrea Doimo<br><br><br>

<p>
A  small statement for filling windows with a background
pattern that I use in MovieGuide Pro V2. First, the statement
assumes that you've loaded your pattern as Bitmap number 5.
It  also assumes  that you've  examined the screen-structure
using BMB's GUI SUPPORT library, using the ExScreen command!
</p>
If you don't do that, you'll have to change the following:<br>

<ul>
  <li>WBorTop - to the height of the top border in a window with Topaz 8 it's 11.
  <li>WBorLeft - to  the  width  of  the  left  border in windows. Normally 4.
  <li>WBorRight - to the widht of the right border in windows. Normally 4.
  <li>WBorBottom - to the height of the bottom window-border. Normally 9.
</ul>

<p>
If  those values doesn't give a good result, try other values,
but using BMB GUI SUPPORT library is the most flexible way, as
it   will   always   be  the  right  values  no  matter  which
font/screensize you're using!
</p>
Two more variables are needed by the statement, and they are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>patwidth - the width of the bitmap in pixels.
  <li>patheight - the height of the bitmap in pixels.
</ul>

<p>
OK  on  with it...  After you've opened the window you can use
the  following  syntax  to  fill  it  out using the Putpattern
statement:
</p>

Syntax: Putpattern {Window,Close,Border}<br>

<ul>
  <li>Window is the window number!
  <li>Close  is  0 (false), or 1 (true) if you want the whole window
       filled.  If this is set to false a small border is left
       unfilled around the pattern. This can look rather nice!
  <li>Border  is 0 or 1, whether you'd like a standard gadget border
       around  the pattern or not.  This set to true and Close
       set  to  false  gives  a very professional look to your
       windows, IMHO.
</ul>

Here's the statement that does it all:<br>

<h3>
Original message by Simon Ravn<br><br><br>

<p>
And  here's  another small routine for intuition programs that
simply  makes  a BUSY/WAITING window that can be used to bring
up  messages in your program.  It's nothing spectacular, but I
use it a lot:-)
<p>
Some  variables  that  has  to be defined before calling this:<br>

<ul>
  <li>WinFSize - the height of the font used in this window.
  <li>yfactor - the yfactor of the screen. 640x256=1. I use yfactor=ScreenHeight/256
  <li>RScreenH - height of the screen.
  <li>RScreenW - width of the screen!
  <li>pattern  - pattern-fill on/off (0/1) - in conjunction with the Putpattern statement!
</ul>

You  should also have your window font loaded with LoadFont as font no.  1, but you can change this, of course!<br>
