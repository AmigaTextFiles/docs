@NODE HISTORY "History of the Amiga"

    Date      Event    ( * = Important events )

    1982      Hi-Torro company created by Jay Minor and 2 others  (later
              renamed  to Amiga Inc). Developed the first prototype Amiga
              called  'Lorraine'.

    1984      January 4th. First Amiga prototype hardware displayed at
              the  Winter CES. Boing ball demo shown.

    1985    * Amiga Inc getting very short of cash. Atari and SGI were
              first interested but Commodore gave the best offer of
              $4.25 a share.

              In June, the first silicon based Amiga shown. Not many
              people could believe the kind of graphics it could do.

              On July 23rd, the A1000 was displayed  with Andy WarHol
              at the launch who drew a picture of Blondie on the spot.
            * The A1000 was released in September. It cost half the
              price of a EGA based PC.

              Amiga World magazine released. The famous Juggler demo
              released.

    1986      Original A2000 designs were rejected by Commodore, instead
              they went for a German design. As a result, more than half
              of the  original Amiga crew were laid off. Within months,
              none of the original crew remained.

              Defender of the Crown game released. It was so impressive
              that it sold thousands of Amigas.

    1987    * The Amiga 500 and the A2000 were released.

    1988      Sales of the Amiga rose.

    1989      Batman Pack (A500) released. It sold in the 100,000s.

    1990      The Amiga became the world's best selling home computer.

              On April 24th, the Amiga A3000 was unveiled and in May
              it was released. It had the new Workbench 2.0.

              In June, the CDTV was released, which looked like a VCR
              with a  CDROM and used the old Kickstart 1.3. It was very
              expensive, and marketed not as a Amiga  computer but a
              home appliance.

            * In August, the A500+ was released which had ECS and
              Workbench 2.04 There were problems with software
              compatibility as a lot of  programs hit the hardware which
              didn't work on the new hardware which caused a few problems
              for new buyers.

              In November, the Newtek Video Toaster was released. It was
              widely used in TV and Video productions including some
              famous ones such as B5, Seaquest DSV, Star Trek TNG,
              Quantum Leap, Robocop, Alladin and Jurrasic Park etc.

    1991      The CDTV was a financial failure and Commodore themselves
              made some mistakes as well. The A600 was unveiled which was
              no better than the A500+ (although it included PCMCIA port
              and IDE interface, but some had ROMs with no scsi.device
              in it!), it didn't have a keypad.

    1992      The A3000+ was shown which had AGA and was very expandable,
              but  Commodore scrapped it, in favour of the A4000.

            * In March the A600 was released, it caused an outcry for
              those people who still bought the older A500/A500+ (CBM
              never released information until the last minute).

              Amiga Format magazine, reached reader figures of 130,000
              and peaked at 160,000 readers.

              On September 11, the A1200 was unveiled which had AGA
              and Workbench 3. It was an actual prototype but if it
              was developed further it could have been even better.

            * The A4000 was released in December and the A1200 was
              released slightly later to cash in on the Christmas
              sales. The A4000 was good but was priced too high.

    1993      Commodore starts laying off people, the new AAA chipset
              is shelved due to lack of money. Rumours of Commodore's
              demise is rife and the PC starts to gain a lead over the
              Amiga.

              Amiga Report, an online magazine by Jason Compton, was
              started in March.

              By April, the A1200 reached 100,000 sales.
              Workbench 3.1 was released to developers for testing.
              The Emplant Emulator was also announced this month, which
              emulates the Apple Mac.

              In September, the CD32 console was released (contained a
              CDROM drive and AGA chipset). It had a lukewarm reception
              and Commodore promised lots of games for it - which never
              appeared. They planned advertising, costing 7million.

    1994      In MArch, Commodore announced huge losses and by April
              they laid off a lot of their staff. By the 25th, only
              30 employees were left, of the original 1000.

              On Wednesday the 27th, the West Chester facility was
              closed down.

           *  Finally, on Friday April 29th, 4:10, Commodore filed
              for liquidation.

              Later, another sad event, occured, Jay Miner, the 'father'
              of the Amiga, died on June 20th due to a long illness
              in El Camino Hospital In Mountain View.

    1995      Chelsea Football Club considered taking legal action
              against Commodore for due sponsership money.

              Commodore UK tried a management buyout until the last
              minute.

              On March 1st, the Amiga World magazine was cancelled.

           *  In April, Escom and Dell fought over Commodore. Escom
              offered 7m while Dell offered 15m but wasnt sure they
              wanted the Amiga...!? Escom won the contest.

              Escom created Amiga Technologies to sell the A1200
              and A4000T which went back into production. There was
              a small problem with Escom made A1200s, the floppy drive
              had a small flaw that caused some programs to fail to
              load! The A4000T was priced at 2000-2500 for 040/060
              Amigas...!

              On April 16th, GVP went out of business. They were very
              popular hardware manufacturers for the Amiga (GVP-M have
              now taken over).

    1996      On April 11th, Viscorp (STB company) announces that it
              will try to  buy the Amiga from Escom (they tried all
              year, keeping the community in the lurch).

              A range of 15" and 17" monitors will be released for use
              on the Amiga by Microvitec on 8th May.

              May 15th, Phase 5 announces its PowerUp accelerator
              boards for the Amiga.
              Also, Eagle Computers announce that they will make
              A4000TE computers.

              The Walker was shown to the public, it used AGA, had a CD,
              floppy drive, a standard sized motherboard and Zorro slots
              but the Black curved casing caused some controversy -
              Darth Vader's helmet, a vacuum cleaner?!

            * On July 15th, Escom filed for bankrupty. They bought out
              hundreds of shops across the country and underestimated
              the growth of PC sales.

              In a shock move, Carl Sasserath (author of Amiga's Exec)
              resigns from Viscorp on Nov 24th.

              On Nov 29th, Viscorp's bid for the Amiga was cancelled.

              Jason Compton (author of Amiga Report) resigns as spokes
              man from Viscorp, disillusioned, on Dec 4th.

              Amiga Power, a games magazine, was closed in September.

    1997      On Feb 1st, QuikPak (makers of A4000s) makes a bid for
              the Amiga.

              On March 2nd, Phase 5 announces that they will be making
              the CyberStormPPC and BlizzardPPC boards which will
              use fast PowerPC 603/604 chips along with 68040/68060
              to run OS functions.

              Villagetronic discovers that the number of OS 3.1
              upgrade kits are in short supply by March 19th.

              Vulcan and Clickboom took on the Amiga market and managed
              to release new games. Myst and Quake were converted to
              the Amiga and sold thousands of copies.

            * On March 27th, a new owner was found for the Amiga.
              Gateway 2000, bought out Amiga from Escom and rename Amiga
              Technologies to Amiga International to sell the remaining
              stocks of Amiga to the public. They have sold a lot to
              various third world countries including India.

              May 9th, Haage & Partner announces that they will bring
              Java to the Amiga (we are still waiting in '99).

              Amiga Inc, the Research and Development arm was opened to
              develop the new Amiga. Staff includes Jeff Shindler,
              Dr Havemose, Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss (who later left).

              In June, Amiga User International magazine closed and
              Amiga Computing in July. Finally, Amiga Review closed
              as well due to lack of advertising.

              On July 5th, Index Info. gets a licence to make Amigas
              such as the Access machine and the BoXeR.

              On July 10th, Intrinsic Computers also get a licence!

              On Sept 15th, Amiga Intl now has a list of spare parts
              to sell.

              Cloanto releases Amiga Forever CD containing UAE and
              Kickstarts and Workbenchs licenced from Amiga Intl
              on 10th Oct.

              On Nov 11th, Index releases their Access Amiga box to
              the world.  Ideal for information points etc.

              1200s are going to India on Dec 21st.

    1998    * 15th May, World of Amiga show, gave a shock to the Amiga
              Community. They announced Amiga OS 4 (actaully Amiga OS 5
              dev) to be run on an industry standard developer machine
              (x86 based) at around US$999.

              The current Amiga range is declared to be legacy or
              'Amiga Classic'. Amiga OS 3.5 upgraded has been cancelled.

              AmigaOS 5 machines will be aimed at Digital Convergance
              platform for customers. No details of processor or
              hardware were released.

            * At the Amiwest show in July, further details about the
              AmigaII or AmigaNG were released:
               3D graphics, Dolby AC3, multi-MPEG decoding, Internet,
              scalable multimedia processors, HDTV, OpenGL, Java,
              Firewire, USB, ADSL and Autoconfiguration!

              At the MAE show in October, Amiga Inc, announces that
              AmigaOS 3.5 WILL after all be developed as a gift for
              the Amiga community. Features includes new interface,
              better CDFS, Internet capabible, better printer support,
              RTG and RTA (later dropped), PPC support, new FFS,  plus
              bugs fixed from WB 3.1.

              On November 11th, Amiga Inc, announces that QNX Software
              Systems Ltd will utilise the QNX realtime OS as the
              foundation for the Next Generation Amiga.

              Due to loss of a partner the Developer box did not appear.

    1999      On February 26th, Jim Collas will take over Amiga Inc
              and has moved its HQ to San Diego and start Fast
              Track Development Plans. Former head, Jeff Shindler
              will take over product strategy for the new Amiga.

              On July 16th, Amiga Inc releases Technology brief detailing
              their new Amiga Operating Environment using AmigaObjects,
              and Java using the Linux (instead of QNX) operating system.
                  
              They also announced the specification of the Amiga Multimedia
              Convergence Computer (MCC) based on a unknown High-performance
              next generation CPU and the latest hardware technology such as
              SDRM, 3D graphics, DVD, MPEG, TV, 16bit surround sound etc.

              Phase 5 announces the new AmiRage K2 computer based on the 
              PowerPC and using QNX as the operating system instead of Linux
              on 5th August.

              In a shock move, Jim Collas, President of Amiga, resigns, 
              probably due to differences of strategy with Gateway. Tom 
              Schmidt takes over as President (1/9/99)

              Amiga files 17 new patents on various Digital Convergence
              technologies.

              Tom Schmidt (15/9/99) announces that Amiga will be only 
              developing software and the AmigaOE. The MCC computer is 
              cancelled, along with any hopes of a next generation Amiga.

              At the end of October, Haage &amp; Partner releases AmigaOS 3.5 
              software upgrade for existing Amigas. Requires an 020, CDROM, 
              6Mb RAM and Hard Disk (raising the minimum standard from a 
              basic 2Mb A1200).
                  
2000          Jan. Amino buys name and rights from Gateway to continue the 
              Classic series to the next generation. They are headed by 
              Fleecy Moss and Bill McEwan. They partner with the TAO
              group.
              The old Amiga Inc is folded into Gateway`s development group.

              Phase 5 goes bankrupt due to shortage of PPC sales and delays 
              getting G4 boards into production.

              April. Amiga announce new developer system based on a 500 MHz
              AMD K6-2, 64Mb RAM, and GeForce 256 graphics which will run
