@{b}Introduction@{ub}

This guide has been started up for all users of IRC. It's really just a
list of channels and jargon which could act as a reference guide for
the times when you decide to go onto IRC. 

It began as a text file, with just a simple list of channels. Now, it
has grown into a Guide as well, with plenty more channels to keep you
interested. We intend to keep on improving the files until no more
channels or jargon can be found. Or as long as the Internet exists. :)

Take a look around and see what there is of interest to you. We welcome
any comments that you may have about the lists. Send them to the addresses
given in the @{" Author " Link "Author"} section.

Thanks for your time. Enjoy!

@{b}PC USERS ALERT! (If any)@{ub}

This archive contains two versions of the IRC list, the 'IRC.guide' which
is only for Amiga computers who have Amigaguide© installed. If you are a
PC IRC user and did manage to stumble across this little gem, there is
also a TXT file which you can view. It's virtually the same, except it's
smaller and less efficent. If you want the best, upgrade to an Amiga! :)


@{b}No discriptions! :(@{ub}

Unfortunately, quite a lot of the channels do not have discriptions on them.
We'll be using them over the next few months and sorting out what each channel
is. If you do send channels, it would be helpful if you could just send a 
@{i}small@{ui} discription on what the channel entails. Thanks!

@{b}How?@{ub}
 
It's easy really, just select @{" The List " Link "List"} and choose a letter relevent to 
the channel that you may be interested in. From then on, you will be
displayed with a list containing all the channels starting with the letter
you chose. Just browse around and see what you can find. :) Also, take a 
look at the discription of the channel to see what it's about.

If you don't want a channel to go to but just require some information on
IRC terms, them look up the @{" Jargon " Link "Jargon"} area for information on terms which you
may come across when perusing the vast area that is IRC.

Also, you may peruse the small collection of @{" smilies " Link "Smile"} that we have in stock,
just in case you get bored at all! :)

has bothered to contact us and send us some stuff. He/she sent us loads of channels, 
some of which were a little bit dubious. We've had to leave out the dirtier ones due 
to some people (On BBS's mainly) complaining about it. Most of it was left in.
Thanks Florent!

That's all for now. :( Keep sending!

@{b}The great Cool96 channel@{ub}

If you want to find me, I'm usually on my own wonderous channel, '#Cool96' which
is free for all kids. Sometimes, however, it will be Invite Only as I often have a 
private chat so message me if you desperately need to talk. :)

I'll also be on '#Pei' and '#Kidz' (With a 'Z')


@{b}Who is LumberJak?@{ub}

Well, he's Cool's brother whom at the moment is in the process of writing his 
masterpiece. It's an AMOS game (Without a title) and is based around the age old 
theme of 3D Role play games. :) It will have monsters,  multiple characters, 
parties, great graphics, sounds etc. All the ususal stuff, and more.

If you are interested in such a game, or just want to query me about my AMOS habits 
then mail me at the following address :

 sewards@jinxster.demon.co.uk

I usually contribute to the AMOS mailing list, so you might be able to find my
comments on there.

BTW, If you are a great graphics designer, and would be interested in drawing 
graphics for my masterpiece, then contact me at the above address. This isn't 
exactly going to be a @{b}major@{ub} project, but it may make a few bob, of which
some will go to the graphics designer. (If there is one) :)
