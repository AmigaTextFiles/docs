@node Introduction

	For as long as I have been using my Amiga, there has been little 
or no information, except for some kind folks on the IRC channel #amiga, 
on setting up SLIP, trouble shooting your setup and using it to its 
fullest with your Amiga.  Although, admitedly, I am no Internet/SLIP/PPP 
guru, I had to learn from the school of hard knocks to get my SLIP setup 
running.  I had to do it with almost no outside help.  In the following 
article I will review several programs relating to SLIP usage and try to 
clear up some points that seem to give beginners the most trouble.  And
remember this;  If I Can Set It Up, Anyone Can.

NOTE: You can print out any part of this document by selecting 'Print' 
from the 'Project' menu. 

Also Note: This file is not complete.  However, if @{"I" link author} get enought e-mail, I
will complete it.

@node Terms

First some terms I may use frequently in this document;


SLIP - Serial Line Internet Protocol
	- This is the interface used to communicate between your computer 
	  and the remote internet provider.

IRC - Internet Relay Chat
	- This is a place where you can have a realtime chat with 
	  literally hundreds of users around the globe.  There are 
	  literally hundreds of channels available.  My favorite 
	  is @{"#amiga" link AUTHOR}  

Usenet News
	- Usenet is a place where you can read up on whats going on with
	  your favorite pastimes.

FTP - File Transfer Protocol
	- Use this program to get files of of your favorite remote 
	  server.
 
WWW - World Wide Web
	- Just another way to 'surf the net'.  WWW Browsers use graphical
	  point and click interfaces.  Sound files and graphics files 
	  can be accessed by WWW browsers.

SMTP - ???? 

NNTP - ????

Pop Mail 
	- If set up, your computer will periocically check your Pop Mail
          address for new e-mail, and will inform you if there is any.

Gopher
	- While getting rather antiquated because of the WWW browsers, 
	  the Gopher style interface is still useful sometimes.  
	  Especially when connecting to older style interfaces of some 
	  servers.

IP Address -
	- This is the numerical address which every server has.  You will
	  almost always use a name when connecting to other servers, 
	  i.e. FTP.WUSTL.EDU  But, you could also connect there by 
	  using its equivalent IP Address of 128.225.135.4 

@endnode

@node Requirements

	One of the questions I here most on #amiga and Usenet is "What do I
need for hardware to set up SLIP on my Amiga?"  Well, the answer is that
you can set up SLIP and its related programs (IRC, Usenet News Browser,
Mail Clent, WWW Browser, FTP Clent, etc) on any Amiga with a modem.  Most
(if not all) SLIP providers require at least a 14,400 baud modem. I would 
recommend at least 1 meg of chip ram and 2 megs of fast ram.  KickStart and
Workbench 3.1 would be desireable, but not necessary.  My system includes;

	Amiga 500 (Stock)
	GVP Impact Series II with 52 meg Hard Drive
	1 Meg Chip RAM
	4 Megs Fast RAM
	1084 Monitor
	USR 14,400 Sportster
	KickStart 2.04/Workbench 2.1

	Although my system lacks the speed I wish it had, it is useable.
Screen redraws can be a little slow when the CPU is being hogged by the
modem.  I have been using SLIP on this system for just over a year now.
With no problems (exept a poorly written program or two)

@endnode
@node Setup

	Now the real fun begins!  Since the only SLIP protocol stack I have
experience with is AmiTCP, I will discuss the setup proceedure of that
program.  Others may be similar.  The below setup for AmiTCP is a minimum
to just get AmiTCP working.  You may change settings as you become more
advanced.

	First you need to obtain several bits of information from your
Internet provider.  Get the following info from them;

	1. Destination IP Address (The IP Address your computer will
	   connect to when you start your SLIP access.)
	
	2. Default Gateway (Often the same as the Destination IP address)
	
	3. Netmask Address
	
	4. Name Servers (Where your computer goes to look up addresses)
	
	5. Domain Name (Usually the stuff after your name in your e-mail
		        address.  My address is jason.d.neus@uwrf.edu, so 
		        my domain name is UWRF.EDU)
	
	6. Is the account Dynamic?  (By that I mean, does the IP address of
                                     your call in account change depending 
				     on which line you call in on.  If yes,
				     then your account is dynamic)

	7. Does the provider have compression on the SLIP interface

	8. What is the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) size

	Next, go ahead and uncompress AmiTCP to the hard drive partition
you want it on.  This will make installation a little faster, as copies
will not have to be made.  Once this is done you may want to read the file
'HowToInstall', although this file may just confuse a first timer.  
	After this, go ahead and select 'Install AmiTCP-4.0' from the
AmiTCP-4.0 directory.  I will go through what you will be asked to answer
one at a time.

	1. Select Directory - Select the directory where you want AmiTCP to
			      be installed (easy enough).

	2. Update Sana-II Device Drivers - These are the drivers necessary
					   to use the SLIP interface.  
					   Select 'YES'. They will be 
					   copied to your DEVS: drawer.

	3. Install Napsa fonts - If you plan on telnetting into a shell
				 account, it is probably a good idea to 
				 install these fonts (although not
				 necessary).  You can then use the 
				 NapsaTerm to telnet into shell accounts.

	4. Default User Name - Just enter in any user name you would like
			       to give your self, it can be anything.

	5. Login Name - To make this easier, just enter in the same name
	   		you used for the User Name.

	6. UID (User ID) - This is just the ID number you want to assign to
	 		   this user, go ahead and select the default of 
			   100.

	7. Group ID - This is a number to assign to a group of users.
		      Again, just select the default of 100.

	8. Real Name - Go ahead and enter your real name.  This is used for
		       an ENV: setting for some programs.

	9. Home Directory - Select AmiTCP:/bin as your home directory to
			    save problems.

	10. Command Interpreter - Go ahead and select the default 
				  'shell'.

	11. Enter Password - Enter the password you wish to use to login 
			     to AmiTCP.

	12. Dynamic Connection - If your connection is Dynamic, select
				 'YES'.

	13. Domain Name - As discussed above, enter your domain name.

	14. Interface Type - If you are a beginner (I'm sure you are,
			     otherwise you wouldn't be reading this file) 
			     Select the 'SLIP/CSLIP' option. (CSLIP is 
			     the SLIP interface with compression). You can
			     play with PPP and stuff later.

	15. Default IP Address - If your connection is not dynamic, enter
				 you account IP Address here.  If your 
				 connection is dynamic, enter one of the 
				 available IP addresses here.  That way 
				 AmiTCP has something to fall back on if
				 neccessary.

	16. Destination IP Address - Enter this from the info from your
				     provider.

	17. Netmask - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	18. Select Device - Go ahead and select 'serial.device' or an
                            equivalent.

	19. Select Unit Number - Unless you have a multi-serial port card,
				 select '0' for the device number.

	20. Select Baud Rate - Type in the highest baud rate your modem
			       will support.  For my 14,400 I have 19200 
			       typed in for this option.

	21. MTU Size - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	22. Select Handshaking Type - CTS/RTS is the best choice.

	23. Default Gateway - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	24. Name Servers - Enter this from the info from your provider.

	25. Domain Names To SEarch - Just enter you domain name here.

	26. Make changes to User-Startup - Select 'YES'.

	27. Start INETD at startup - Select 'YES'.  INET is needed by some
				     programs, so just have it started at 
				     startup.

	THATS IT!  You should now have a functional SLIP interface.  Reboot
your computer to allow the changes to take effect.  
@endnode
@node Starting

	Call up your SLIP provider with a terminal program.  Once 
connected you will now need to quit your terminal program.  It may be 
necessary to turn on DTR override on your modem to prevent it from 
hanging up when you quit your terminal program.  You can do this either 
with the command 'at@d0' or use a dip switch (ala USRobotics).  

	You will now need to start a new shell.  If your account is not
dynamic, enter 'startnet'.  If your account is dynamic, then enter
'startnet ipaddress', i.e. 'startnet 139.225.4.85'.  

	The first thing you will see after entering your password is the
demo version waiting screen.  After the OK button is availabe, go ahead and
click on it.  If this is your first time running AmiTCP, you should read
the copyright info in the waiting window.

	Once done loading in (this should only take around 20-30 seconds)
you are now at a shell prompt, just like when you call into a shell
account.  To test to see if it is working correctly type in the following;

	ncftp ftp.netnet.net  (or any other local ftp site)

	If everything is working right, you should see the modem SD/RD
lights flicker a couple times and you should soon see the friendly greeting
of the NETNET internet site flashing by.  If it does't work the first time,
try it two or three times.  You may simply be getting legitamate
time-outs.  

	If its not working, uh-oh.  Go back to the installation and make
sure everything is typed in correctly.

@node E-Mail

	Ok, one of the first things you'll want to do is setup and E-Mail
client on your computer, right?  OK then.  For the very first E-Mail
program I would suggest using a program called AirMail.  Once you get that
up and running you can upgrade to a program like Pine.


	@{" Before Setting Up E-Mail" link before}
	@{" Setting Up AirMail " link airmail}
	@{" Setting Up Pine " link pine}
@endnode
@node Before

	Before setting up E-Mail or Usenet you will need to set up a UUCP
heirarchy.  This is very simple.  Make the following directories somewhere
on your hard drive;

	UUCP
	UULib
	UUNews
	UUSpool

	Once you make these directories, add assigns to your Startnet file
for each of the new directories. (Amitcp4.0:bin/startnet)

	i.e. Assign UUCP: dh1:amitcp4.0/uucp 

	Also, make a 'mail' directory somewhere for use by E-Mail programs.  
It is not necessary to assign the mail directory.
	You will also need to get the address of your SMTP (mail) server.
@endnode
@node AirMail

	Simply uncompress AirMail and copy it to wherever you want it to
reside.  Double click on its icon and load it up.  Once there simply go to
the 'Settings' menu and do the three 'setup' options.  Thats it.  Click on
'Check Mail' to see if you have any.  Try and send yourself a test letter to
make sure its set up right. 
@endnode
@node Pine

	The Amiga version of Pine is a conversion of Unix Pine.  Many
people may already have experience with this program, and I found it 
much easier to set up than programs like Elm.
	Actually, the installation of Pine isn't very hard thanks to the
inclusion of an installation program.  When downloading Pine, you must
download 3 seperate files from aminet;

	@{"Pine391a_Base.lha" link where}
	@{"PineBaseUpd.lha" link where}
	@{"Pine391a_***.lha" link where} (Depending On CPU Type)

	Uncompress all the above files and double click on the install
icon.  Follow the installation process.
	Once installed, load Pine and type in your user name and password.
Then select S (setup) from the main menu.  Once there select C (config).
You will now be asked for several settings.  The only ones you _need_ are
the SMTP server and the INBOX path (see Pine docs for options on the inbox
setting) but fill in as many as you can.  There you are.  You will have to
quit and then restart for the new settings to take effect. Try sending 
yourself some test mail to make sure it's set up right.  

	You will need @{"IXemul.library" link where} to use Pine.

	I also have been having trouble with Pine crashing with my stock
A500.  From what I gather from the docs, IXemul.library was not really 
written specificaly to be 68000 compatible.  However, I have found that 
having a stack of 35000 helps keep crashes to a minimum.
@endnode
@node Gui-FTP

	I use a program called GUI-FTP for most of my FTP transfers.
AmiTCP comes with ncFTP, but I just prefer the point and click of GUI-FTP.
This is another easy to install program.  Simply copy the libraries to your
libs directory, the fonts to your fonts directory, and the main program to
where ever you want it to reside.  Set the environmental variable 'host'
(see the GUI-FTP.guide on this) and you're ready to go.  Simply run it and
connect to your favorite FTP host.
@endnode
@node WWW

	I have two WWW Browsers on my computer.  ALynx and AMosaic.  Both
are good programs, the only differnce being that ALynx is unable to display
graphics within itself, while AMosaic can (Workbench 3.1 is required for
graphics).

	@{" Setting Up ALynx " link alynx}
	@{" Setting Up AMosaic " link amosaic}

NOTE: As of the time I typed this, there are at least 2 more WWW browsers
on the verge of release;
	
	AMosaic 2.0
	IBrowse

@endnode
@node ALynx

	ALynx is a Unix port of Lynx, a text only WWW browser.  ALynx is a
very good, smooth, compact program.

	Before setting up ALynx, you will need to download @{"AMosaic" link
where} and 
get the MailCap file from it.  The mailcap file contains information 
on external graphic viewers and external sound sample players.

	Uncompress the ALynx.lha file and copy ALynx and Lynx.cfg to your
AmiTCP:/bin directory.  Use your favorite text editor to edit the lynx.cfg
file to the settings you desire.  You will also need to edit the MailCap
file to your desired settings.  See the AMosaic docs for information on
editing the mailcap file.

	ALynx is very straightforward and easy to use.  Even an absolute
beginner should get it down in no time.
@endnode
@node AMosaic

	AMosaic is a decent program, but plagued by some problems.  It has
a habit of crashing at times.  After I went from 2 megs of fast ram to 4
megs of fast ram, the crashes have decreased, but are still there.  You
will also need Workbench 3.1 to get inline graphics with AMosaic.  The one
advantage of AMosaic over ALynx is that it has the point and click
interface of the more popular WWW browsers.	

	To use AMosaic you will need to get @{"MUI.library" link where}.
You must first install MUI.  Use the included installation program.  It
won't work if you only copy the library to your libs.

	AMosaic comes with a good installation guide, so I will not go
indepth about it's installation.

	If you have any questions here, just @{"email" link author} me.
