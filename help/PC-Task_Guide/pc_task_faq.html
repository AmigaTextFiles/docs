Q) The mouse still doesn't work under Windows?

A)  Change the "mouse.ini" file in the Windows directory to read
	<STRONG>MouseType=SERIAL2</STRONG> instead of
	MouseType=PS2


Q) I am using Cybergraphics but I don't get a cursor?

A) Make sure you are running a delayed video update in Advanced Video Options
   Immediate display.


-----------------------------------------------------

Q) What are the minimum requirements for PC-Task 4.2

A) PCTask requires at least Kickstart 2.0, a 68020, and 2Mb memory.  The
   more memory the better.  In order to use FPU emulation, you will need to
   have an FPU.


Q) I am a registered user of a previous version of PC-Task, can I upgrade?

A) Yes, you can.  There are different prices for upgrading from different
   versions, so please visit our ordering page.


Q) I heard a program called PCx was faster, is this correct?

A) Best thing to do is check out our <A HREF="speed.html">speed test page</A>! 


Q) Where is the PC-Task V4 demo ? 

A) It is on aminet ftp sites /pub/aminet/biz/demo/PC-TaskDemo40.lha, goto 
   <A HREF="demo.html">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask/demo.html</A> for direct links to it here
   and various aminet sites. 


Q) How much/where/how can I get PC-Task V4 from ? 

A) PC-Task V4 is a fully commercial product available from the us and our
   distributors and retailers, see <A HREF="order.html">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask/order.html</A>


Q) I purchased PC-Task V1-V2 how do I upgrade to V4 ? 

A) <A HREF="order.html">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask/order.html</A>


Q) I purchased PC-Task V3.0/V3.1 how do I upgrade to V4.2 ? 

A) <A HREF="order.html">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask/order.html</A>
 

Q) How fast is PC-Task V4 ? 

A) See <A HREF="speed.html">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pctask/speed.html</A> 


Q) Why don't you take over the Amiga for more speed ? 

A) Because the speedup is _very_ minimal (it also gets even smaller on faster
   machines) and who is going to write hard disk, floppy, video, sound etc
   drivers for every piece of hardware out there. Look at Transformer it took
   over the system and is slower than PC-Task. Time is better spent on
   improving emulation methods so don't bother suggesting this as I won't be
   doing it.


Q) Why don't you release a demo that allows writing to disk ? 

A) We don't think that this is a good idea and won't be doing it. 


Q) Does PC-Task V4 support graphics cards ? 

A) PC-Task V4 supports all display database compliant cards. 


Q) Can PC-Task access the ISA (PC-XT/AT) slots inside the Amiga
   2000/3000/4000 ?

A) It is impossible for any Amiga software to access anything plugged into
   the ISA slots without a bridge type card.


Q) Why is the graphics update slow in ... ? 

A) Graphics update speed depends on many things. Like did you have it in
   immediate update or after # of frames and what PC mode was it. Did you run
   it on a native Amiga mode or a card mode (if so what card mode & what RTG
   software is doing the work). All these things are important. On a OCS and
   ECS machines (A500/A600/A2000/A3000) any native mode in 16 colors (the
   default PC text and MS Windows modes) you are stuck with the fact that OCS
   and ECS in hires/4 bitplanes are a complete and utter dog because all chip
   RAM access (for all the display area of the frame) is already taken just
   for the display data fetching. AGA does not have this problem. When using
   graphics card modes OR PC-Task as a window the more recent the AmigaOS the
   faster (V3.1 is faster than V3.0 which is much faster than V2).


Q) How can I get faster graphics update in MS Windows ? 

A) Try changing the update method to update after # of frames (except for 256
   color modes). Try using the VGA mono MS Windows display driver. If using a
   graphics card mode see if the native mode is faster.


Q) I can't get PC-Task to come up as a window ? 

A) Make sure you are setting the specific PC mode to the window option in
   advanced video options.


Q) How do I use a mouse in MS Windows(3.1)? 

A) See the README that came with PC-Task 4.2. 


Q) MSBackup doesn't seem to work ? 

A) I believe it wants to access the drive at a hardware level which PC-Task
   does not do. I wonder if Microsoft will ever learn how to write nice
   software.


Q) I get software appears corrupted message ? 

A) If you purchased PC-Task you probably have faulty/corrupted disk, contact
   us. If you have pirated (stolen) PC-Task, buy it or rot in hell.


Q) The partition I had setup under CrossDOS/CrossPC doesn't seem to work? 

A) You must use a mountlist/DOSDriver entry that has NO CrossDOSFileSystem
   entry.


Q) I have the demo and can't seem to create a harddisk for it ? 

A) Setting up a harddisk requires the use of the MSDOS programs FDisk and
   Format which need to write to the harddisk so you cannont do this with the
   demo.


Q) I tried to set up a real partiton but it doesn't work ? 

A) Did it appear next to Hardrive C/D: on the BIOS screen of PC-Task (the one
   after you press start on the setup screen) ? If not then make sure it is
   being mounted and you correctly entered it with colon on the setup screen.
   If you have to set mask values on your Amiga partitions because you
   controller cannot DMA to your 32bit RAM, see section 2.10 of the manual on
   how to do this for PC-Task partitions. If using a mountlist/DOSDriver
   entry make sure it has NO CrossDOSFileSystem entry.


Q) I want to read the harddisk I setup for PC-Task from AmigaOS ? 

A) Use PCTCrossMount that came with PC-Task V4.0. 


Q) I tried to set up CDROM access but it doesn't work ? 

A) Follow section 5.8 of the manual. Make sure you are using PC-Task V3.1 and
   PCTCDROM.SYS that came with it (not some old version). If you have to set
   mask values on your Amiga partitions because you controller cannot DMA to
   your 32bit RAM, see section 2.10 of the manual on how to do this for
   PC-Task. If it still doesn't work contact tech support.
