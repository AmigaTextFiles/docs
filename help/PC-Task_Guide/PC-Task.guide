@NODE "Install" "Installing PC Task"

There are several version of PC Task which comes with the package. 
Some are based on the processor and the others are a Turbo version. 
To get the best speed out of PC Task ensure that you use the right 
version.
The Turbo version uses twice as much ram as the standard version, so 
if you allocated 4Mb RAM for PC Task and type MEM at the DOS prompt 
you may only get a a quarter of that actually showing!
     On the PC Task screen there are various settings, these are saved
in a PC.Config file. 

@{u}Settings@{uu}

1. Dynamic Buffer. Specifies amount of ram for emulation, the bigger the
   buffer, the faster the emulation. There are five sizes: Tiny, Small,
   Medium, Large, Huge. Requires more RAM for each mode.

2. FPU.  Tells the system to use the Amigas FPU if you have one built in.

3. Graphics Adapter. Specifies which type of graphics mode you want. There
   are several modes: MGA (Mono), CGA (colour), EGA (16 colours), VGA (256
   colours), SVGA (512K,1M,2M) for AGA or graphics boards. Use VGA for
   most AGA Amigas.

4. Advanced Video Options. Specify which Amiga screen mode to use and 
   whether to display in a window or a screen and the rate of screen
   refreshes (Graphics Update).

5. Serial, Parallel, Sound, Mouse. Turns ports on or off for use in 
   emulator. The Sound only emulated basic PC sound (not SoundBlaster).
   And the Mouse option emulates a mouse in a COM2 port needed for
   Windows.

6. Floppy drives: A, B. Specify which disk drives to use for PC drives.
   Use DFx: for each entry.

7. Harddrives: C, D. Specify the location and name of hard drive file
   e.g. Work:IBMHardfile or the device name of a partition e.g. HDC:.

8. Create HarddiskFile. Use this option to create a harddiskfile to use
   as a C: or D: drive. Hardfiles are slower than real partitions.
   Enter the location and name of the file and how big it is in MegaBytes.
   Make sure that your hard disk partition has enough room for it.

9. Priority when/when not selected. Specifies the priority to the Amiga's
   operating system when PC Task is or is not running. Leaving the values
   at 1 and -1 will provide best speed required.

10. Conventional Memory. Specifies amount of memory in KB for DOS. Normal
   values are 640K or 704K (in MDA, CGA modes).

11. Extended Memory. Specifies amount of memory in KB for Windows. You can
   specify upto 15000 or 15MB of memory.

12. Minimum Leave Available. Specifies minimum of memory for AmigaDOS, having
   too little can cause unexpected errors. or cause it to crash. I'd leave 400KB
   available.

13. Use Defaults. Resets settings to defaults i.e. A = DF0, B = DF1, VGA, 
    Medium buffer, Serial on, Parallel on, 640K Conv memory, 0KB Ext. Memory
    and 128K left for AmigaOS.

14. Save Configuraton. Saves your settings in PC.Config file in PCTask directory.

15. Quit. Exits PC Task to AmigaOS.

16. Start. Boots into PC Task and loads OS from A: or C: drive.

@{u}Typical Settings@{uu}

I have an A1200 with 50MHz 030 and 16MB Fast RAM and AGA graphics. My settings are:

Floppy:    A = DF0:, B = DF2:
HardDrive: C = HDC: (partition) 
Dynamic Buffers: Small
Graphics Adapter: VGA (PAL:High Res, 16 colours)
Ports on:    Serial, parallel, mouse, sound
Conv Memory: 640
Ext Memory:  15000
Min Leave:   400

@NODE MEMORY "Memory in a PC"

     Memory requirements are different. For best results, the more 
memory you have the better, since it emulates only a 286 you cannot 
use Virtual Memory on the hard disk. All PC DOS programs use the 
first 640Kb of memory, some programs can use Expanded RAM. To
use this on a 386 you need the EMS40.SYS (not supplied) which allows 
you to allocate some Extended RAM as Expanded RAM.

     Expanded RAM (EMS) is basically memory divided into 16K pages. 
When the program requires expanded ram it is paged into a page frame 
(located in upper memory which is located between 640Kb and 1Mb). This 
type of memory is slower than Extended memory. To access this memory
use either EMS40.SYS or EMM386.EXE with the RAM option.

     Extended memory (XMS) is memory located above the 1Mb barrier. 
This requires a memory manager such as HIMEM.SYS (also EMS40.SYS can 
access this memory). Windows 3.x can use this memory quite effectively.
 
     Upper Memory Blocks is located above the 640Kb and 1Mb and it is 384Kb 
large. You need a 386 or higher processor to use this memory and 
requires the EMM386.EXE memory manager to be loaded.

     High Memory Area is available in the first 64K of Extended RAM and
it is available when HIMEM.SYS is loaded. Using DOS=HIGH installs part
of MS-DOS into this area to save on Conventional RAM.

     For advanced operationg systems such as OS2 and Windows NT, these
limitations are replaced by a flat memory address space like the Amiga.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Floppy "Using Floppy disks with PC Task"

     Most PCs these days use 1.44Mb floppy disks. To use these disks 
on the Amiga you need to buy a High Density drive to read/write these 
disks. These drives are now much cheaper than they used to be and are 
available from most Amiga dealers.

     If you are using the XL Drive from Power Computing and having 
trouble recognising PC disks - try switching to WB (LAmiga+M) and
insert the new disk and wait for the Volume to appear before 
switching back to PC-Task.

     To create a bootable floppy disk, there are four methods:

1. If the disk is unformatted: Type FORMAT A: /S or if its a double
   density disk, type FORMAT A: /F:720 /S to format to 720Kb.

2. If the disk is already formatted but needs clearing using the
   Quick Format switch e.g. FORMAT A: /S /Q.

3. If the disk is formatted and cleared you can use the SYS command
   to copy the system files to the disk. Type: SYS C: A: which
   copies the files from the C: to the A: drive. If C: is the
   current drive, you can try SYS A: instead.

4. Run SETUP /F which creates a minimal floppy boot disk.

A bootable floppy should contain COMMAND.COM and two hidden system files:
MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS. To make it more useful, you should copy the following
essential files onto the disk from C:\DOS:

FORMAT.COM - To format new disks
FDISK.EXE  - To create new dos partitions
SYS.COM    - To create new bootable disks
XCOPY.EXE  - To copy multiple files and dirs if required
QBASIC.EXE - Req. for EDIT
EDIT.COM   - To edit Autoexec and Config files
SCANDISK.EXE - To repair faulty disks
UNDELETE.EXE - To recover deleted files
UNFORMAT.COM - To recover formatted disks
AUTOEXEC.BAT - Copy of your current Autoexec file
CONFIG.SYS   - Copy of your current Config file
PCTCDROM.SYS - CDROM Device Driver
MSCDEX.EXE   - CDROM File System driver
MSD.EXE      - Diagnostics

If you have Windows 95/98 you can create a startup disk as follows:
1. Start, Settings, Control Panel
2. Add/Remove Programs
3. Startup Disk
4. Insert a blank 1.4MB floppy and click Create Disk

Otherwise, if using a 720K disk, then do the following:
1. Start, Programs, MS DOS Prompt
2. Format a 720K disk: Format A: /F:720 /S
3. Copy following files from C:\Windows\Command

FORMAT.COM
FDISK.EXE
SYS.COM
XCOPY.COM
EDIT.COM
SCANDISK.EXE
MSCDEX.EXE

The PCTCDROM.SYS file is provided with PC Task.

If you do not have access to Windows 95/98 you can download a boot disk
from http://www.bootdisk.com to use. 

@ENDNODE
@NODE HARD "Using Hard Disks with PC Task"

@{u}Partitions for PC-Task@{uu}

     There are two types of hard disks you can use with PC Task. These 
are HardDiskFiles and Hard Disk partitions. If you have room a Hard 
disk partition is recommended as they are a lot faster than harddisk
files. A 50Mb partition should be adequate for most people. 

     To set up a harddisk partition use the following procedure:

a)Back up the hard disk as this procedure will erase any files on 
affected partitions.

b) Run HDToolbox, select Partition Drives.

c) Reduce the size of the partition on the right hand of the bar.

d) Select Add Partition and this will create a new partition.

e) Click on Advanced Options, and change the drive name from DHx to 
something like PCC or PCD (last letter must be a C or D).

f) Click on Change File System and select @{b}Custom File System@{ub}, 
change the Identifier to @{b}0x4D534800@{ub}.

g) Also turn ON the AutoMount feature.

h) Click on OK and save the changes. Reboot.

i) Format the resized Amiga partition as normal and restore any 
backed up files.

j) Run PCTask and for drive C: (or D:) enter PCC: or PCD: (or whatever).

k) Click on Start and insert a bootable MSDOS disk.

l) You will need to run FDISK to create a Primary Dos partition and 
activate it. If creating a second disk such as D, change which drive
to use (option 5).

m) Format the partition using the command: FORMAT C: /S

n) Install MS-DOS and any other software. NB: Some DOS installers 
   will format the drive for you so step m can be left out.

  As well as dedicated PC-Task partitions, it is possible to use
PC formatted media not set up for PC-Task. These require mountlists
to gain access.

@{u}Accessing PC formatted media@{uu}

For example, you have a ZIP disk formatted on a PC and you wish PC-
Task to access it. The following mount list is required with some
explaination:

/* $VER: PCD 1.0 (17.2.97)
 *
 * ZIP 100M Access
 */

Device = scsi.device
Unit = 0
Flags		= 0
Surfaces	= 2
BlocksPerTrack	= 64
LowCyl	= 0
HighCyl	= 1535
DosType	= 0x4d534800
#

NB: This is more accuate than the one in the PC Task manual.

To get the above information esp. Surface, Blocks, LowCyl and HighCyl you
need to run HDToolsbox or similar and run it through 'Change Drive Type'
 and 'Define New..' and 'Read Configuration' to get the drive's setup 
(Cancel to prevent it being changed).
  Like the dedicated PC-Task partition the device must end with a C or D
and then the device name e.g. PCD entered in the D: entry in PC-Task start
up screen.

@ENDNODE
@NODE CDROM "Using CD ROM drives"

     To use a CDROM drive you need to use the PCTCDROM.SYS device
driver and MSCDEX programs in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat.
For example:

a) Config.sys
     DEVICE=C:\\DOS\\PCTCDROM.SYS /D:cd.device,0    (Zappo/Overdrive)
   
   or
     DEVICE=C:\\DOS\\PCTCDROM.SYS /D:squirrelscsi.device,2 (SCSI id 2)
    
   or 
     DEVICE=C:\\DOS\\PCTCDROM.SYS /D:atapi.device,0 (IDE Fix)

b) Autoexec.bat
     MSCDEX /D:MSCD001 /M:8 /V  (specify /L:<letter> for specific drive)

Where /M specifies number of buffers, /V displays statistics and /D 
specifies the Logical name of the device.

Note: that the Amiga device drivers needed to be loaded before
being able to use a CD ROM in some cases.

@ENDNODE
@NODE RAMDSK "Using a RAM Disk"

     It is possible to use a read/writable RAM disk in the full and
demo version of PC-TASK. To set up a small 64K RAM Disk in Extended
RAM add the following line into CONFIG.SYS:

DEVICE=C:\\DOS\\RAMDRIVE.SYS [d s [n]] /E

where d is DiskSize (in Kb), s is Sectorsize (128,256,512) and n is
Num of Entries. Defaults are 64,512 and 64. Use /A for Expanded RAM.
 
     It will allocate the next available drive letter to use as the
RAM Disk. It will be perfect for Temporary files or a small work 
space.

e.g. SET TEMP=D:\\ (if D: was set up as the RAM disk) 

Note, you will lose whatever is on the RAM Disk once PC-Task is
rebooted or exited.

@ENDNODE
@NODE OPSYS "Operating Systems"

     The best OS you can get is MS-DOS 5 or better and Windows 3.1. 
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 will not work on 286s or the Interpretive
version of PC-Task.

     If you have PC Task 4, then you may use MS Windows for Workgroups
3.11. Windows 95 is now supported on 4.3 upwards, see notes below.

     For more information on Windows 3.x click @{"here" link MOREWIN}.

     For more information on Windows 95/98 click @{"here" link MORE95}.
 
Other operatings systems for PC are: OS/2, Linux, BeOS, Windows NT,
Netware, DR/Novell DOS and FreeDOS.

@ENDNODE
@NODE MOREDOS "More on MS-DOS"

 MS-DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System is a command line based OS
for Intel based PCs.

  COMMAND.COM is the main program loaded when DOS is booted and provides
the command shell to run programs, utilities or run scripts.
   
  In MS-DOS, files are restricted to 8 characters for the name and 3
characters for the extension after a dot e.g. MYFILE.DOC
The extension is significant in DOS and is meaningful:

i.e.

  .EXE,.COM are programs
  .SYS are system files or drivers
  .BAT are MS-DOS batch files
  .BAS are Basic files
  .TXT indicate plain text files
  .DRV are driver files
  .HLP are Windows Help documents
  .DLL are Windows Library files
  .GRP are Windows Group files
  .INI are Windows Prefs files

and there are many more. COMMAND.COM provides some inbuilt commands but
Microsoft have included many external utilities which are normally located
in C:\DOS. See @{"AmigaOS vs DOS" link COMP} for some of them.

@{u}Command                Purpose@{uu}

QBASIC                 Built in Basic interpreter
HELP                   Help on DOS commands (or use /? after command name)
MSBACKUP               Backup facility (does not work in PC-Task)
MSAV                   Anti-Virus utility
UNDELETE               Undelete files
UNFORMAT               Unformat disks
CHKDSK                 Checks disks for lost allocation units
SCANDISK               Scans corrupted disks
DEFRAG                 Defragments disks
DOSKEY                 Provides command history, editing and macros
                       (Press F3 to retrieve last command if Doskey
                       is not loaded or F1 for next character)
INTERLNK               Peer-to-peer file and disk sharing
MEMMAKER               Optimizes Autoexec and Config.


Using HELP can give all the information you need, although a good DOS manual
will also help.

@ENDNODE
@NODE MOREWIN "More on Windows"

     Windows 3.1 and 3.11 uses a Graphical User Interface. There are
several advantages of using Windows over DOS:

     1) It is not restricted to the first 640Kb as it can use
        Extended RAM.

     2) Windows programs are much friendlier to use and the use
        of special keyboards shortcuts aren't required to remember.

     3) Use of graphics.
     
  Windows 3.1x uses Co-operative multi-tasking, that is, it is upto
the programs to give up CPU time for other programs to run. Currently,
this hardly happens and programs tend to use all CPU time. It is
possible to run more than one program at a time and switch between them
using ALT+TAB keyboard shortcut.

     Besides Extended memory there is virtual memory which is disk-
based and a lot slower, newer 32-bit programs tend to require this
memory. There is also a smaller area of memory called Resources
(see Help, About) which is displayed as a percentage. If this gets
very small then you may experience 'Out of Memory' messages. This 
memory is only 64Kb big! This memory is used to display icons, gadgets
etc on the display. The only way to fix this is to re-load Windows.

@{u}Manager Programs@{uu}
     
     Program Manager - This is the main screen you will see, the purpose
          is to display icons for the use to double-click on and run
          programs. Program icons may be grouped together in Group
          windows e.g. Main, Accessories, Startup, Games etc.
          NB: Deleting a program icon DOES NOT delete the program!

     File Manager - This program is used to manage files such as 
          Copying, Renaming Deleting, Moving and Searching.

     Print Manager - This program queues and manages output to the printer.
          The Print Manager icon appears when output is performed and
          print out can be paused, stopped or deleted from the queue.

     Task Manager - This program is supposed to manage programs running.
          The task list can be brought up using CTRL+ESC or the Program
          Manager (top left button).

@{u}Application Programs@{uu}

     Notepad        - Simple text editor for Windows
     Write          - Simple word processor for Windows
     PaintBrush     - Simple bitmap graphics program
     Terminal       - Simple comms program
     Calculator     - Simple calculator program
     CardFile       - Simple database program
     MediaPlayer    - Simple audio/anim player
     Soliataire     - Solitaire game
     WinMine        - Mines games

@{u}Configuring Windows@{uu}
     
     There are two programs. One is Windows Setup where you can set up
mouse driver, screen driver and network drivers. The Control Panel 
is used to the desktop, install printer, manage virtual memory, set the
date and time, set up fonts, sounds and so on.

@{u}Installing programs@{uu}

a)  The standard method is to select Run from the File menu in Program
Manager (there is also a Run option in File Manager) and type the name
of the installer program (usually A:\SETUP.EXE).

b) You can install programs by running File Manager and listing the files
on the installation disk and then double clicking on the Setup program.

c) Manual installation involves copying the files to a given directory and 
then use the New option in the File menu to create group or program icons.
You can then specify the Description of the program and the path and filename
of the program to run for the Command.

@ENDNODE
@NODE MORE95 "Windows 95"

   Windows 95 is Microsoft's attempt towards Windows NT. Windows 95 is a
hybrid of the old Windows 3.x and NT and uses Intel's 32 bit registers
for better memory access on 486s and Pentium systems.

   Windows 95 requires 16 Mb or more RAM to run the OS and the average
application, and more RAM is required for more heavy usage such as graphics,
DTP and some games. It retains some of the old MS-DOS commands in
"C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND" directory, a lot of the others have disappeared. 

   Devices can be set up via the Hardware Control Panel, do NOT use the auto
sense (Plug n Play) feature as it will be too slow on PC Task, set up CDROMs,
Modems etc manually.

   Windows 95 is very configurable and using the right mouse button will bring
up a popup menu which will allow you to set the properities of items on the
desktop and perform various functions.

   Most programs can be run via the START button at the bottom left of the 
screen. Commonly used programs can be put into their own sub menu (eg Popular
Programs) or as shortcuts/aliases on the desktop itself. 

   Unlike Windows 3.x Program Manager, an icon in Windows 95 represents a
real file and you can browse disks on the desktop without resorting to
File Manager or Windows Explorer.

   Windows 95 can use long filenames upto 255 characters long although DOS
can still see them using the old 8.3 filenames (they are shortened with ~1
etc in the filename). To read long filenames on the Amiga requires Crossdos
version 7.

To run Windows 95 on PC Task you will probably need an 68060 and around 24-32Mb
RAM and at least 100-200Mb of HD space for the OS and its applicatons.

NB: Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000 or XP will not run under PC Task due to the high 
specification required to run these operating systems.

@ENDNODE
@NODE DOS "DOS Software"

     The majority of software which requires DOS should run with the 
exception of games. There are a few PD games that may work but check 
requirements first. Many commercial games will not work or run very
slowly.

@ENDNODE
@NODE WIND "Windows Software"

     A lot of Windows software requires lots of memory and disk space 
these days and run slowly even on 386 PCs. For PC Task it is possible 
to run some Windows software but an accelerator with at least 8Mb 
should be able to run some Windows software. If at all possible try
to use a DOS based program instead of a Windows program as they will
run much faster.

Check requirements before trying to use Windows software.

@NODE AUTO "The AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS"

     These two files specify what device drivers and TSRs to load at 
bootup. Device drivers include drivers for the screen (e.g. DISPLAY.SYS,
ANSI.SYS), the keyboard (KEYB.COM), the mouse (PCTMOUSE.EXE), SCSI and 
CD ROM drivers. A TSR is a Terminate, Stay Resident program (similar to 
Amiga`s Commodities), for example Virus checkers and so on.
     These programs can take up a lot of memory and it is best to 
ensure these are kept to the minimum. If you have less than 500Kb free 
then you will experience Out of memory error messages.

Examples,

@{b}CONFIG.SYS@{ub}

DEVICE=C:\\DOS\\RAMDRIVE.SYS /E
DEVICE=C:\\APPS\\UTILS\\PCTCDROM.SYS /D:squirrelscsi.device,2
FILES=30
STACKS=9,256

NB: Loads Extended Memory manager, Loads DOS into HMA, Sets UK specific settings, DOS 
Version control, RAM Disk driver, CD-ROM driver and number of open files to 30,
allocates memory for interrupts.

@NODE TIPS "Ways of making PC Task Run faster"

1. The more memory the better, this is true for real PCs. If you
want to use Windows have at least 8Mb of Fast RAM.

2. If you have lots of memory use the Turbo or Dynamic version.

3. Use a lower resolution video driver such as MDA, CGA (Windows
will require VGA at least).

4. Use a graphics board rather than the Amiga's chipset as no
conversion is required for the boards.

5. Use a faster Motorola processor e.g. 68060.
 
6. Don't use the EMM386.EXE program in the Config.sys.

7. Run Windows in Standard mode rather than Enhanced mode.
   e.g. WIN /S. Windows 3.11 only runs in Enhanced mode so
   using the older Windows 3.1 would be better.

8. Don't emulate, buying a real PC would make life a lot better.
   Buy a Pentium 100 or better, there are thousands for sale second
   hand. If a desktop PC takes up too much room a laptop would be
   better.

9. Use real partitions rather than Harddisk files.

10. Make sure you have plenty of Conventional RAM left i.e. 500K or
   more free.

@NODE TRANS "Transferring Files"

In PC-Task it is possible to transfer files between the PC and Amiga sides
using the utilities provided:

@{u}In PC-Task@{uu}

DIRA            Directory of an Amiga disk.
                e.g. DIRA Work:Docs/Letters

COPYTOA         Copy one file to an Amiga disk.
                e.g. COPYTOA C:\MYFILE.TXT Work:Docs/Letters/MyFile.txt

COPYTOI         Copy one file from an Amiga disk.
                e.g. COPYTOI Work:Docs/Letters/MyFile.txt C:\MYFILE.TXT

NB: Note that the commands do differentiate between '\' used in MS-DOS
and '/' used in AmigaDOS.

@{u}In Workbench@{uu}

If you have a Hard Disk Partition or a HardDisk file, run the 
PCTCrossMount Program. This requires the C: or D: entries saved in the
PC.config file and will automatically create a DOSDriver to be used
-only- in Workbench (It is NOT to be used by PC Task in the C: or D:
entries).
     To make the icon created in RAM: a DOSDriver, load up a text editor
and delete the first line 'TCC:' and the '#' at the end. Then create an
.info file for it and change the following:
     Default tool should be C:MOUNT
     Add Tooltype ACTIVATE=1

To get the icon to appear, execute the command DIR TCC: or whatever from
the Workbench/Execute menu option. You can now drag files to/from the
MS-DOS partition.

@{u}Accessing PC media via Workbench@{uu}

  To access PC media via Workbench requires a mountlist (this is different
to the one used for PC-Task, see @{"Hard disks" link HARD}.
  For Workbench, you need to use the CrossDosFileSystem for Workbench to
read the PC device and you need to know the disk's setup. For example,
to access a PC formatted Zip disk you can use:

/* $VER: ZPC0 1.0 (17.2.97)
 *
 * ZIP file system entry
 * Aminet/disk/misc/NewZipMount.lha
 *
 * This file enables CrossDOSFileSystem on a 100M ZIP cartridge.
 */

FileSystem	= L:CrossDOSFileSystem
Flags		= 0
Surfaces	= 2
BlocksPerTrack	= 64
SectorSize	= 512
Mask		= 0x7ffffffe
MaxTransfer	= 0x100000
Reserved	= 1
Interleave	= 0
LowCyl	= 0
HighCyl	= 1535
Buffers	= 50
BufMemType	= 0
StackSize	= 2000
Priority	= 10
GlobVec	= -1
DosType	= 0x4d534800

/* The Device and Unit fields are controlled by tooltypes in the ZPC0 icon.
 *
 * Device	= scsi.device
 * Unit		= 5
 */

With an icon setup and the Tooltypes set up and the Default Tool set to 
C:Mount you can now read/write PC media like other Amiga devices!

See list of network software in @{"Alternatives" link ALTERN}.

@ENDNODE
@NODE PCFILES "Using PC files on the Amiga"

  It is possible to use PC files on the Amiga and vice versa although in
some cases some conversion work may be needed.

@{u}Text Files@{uu}

  PC and Amiga text files differ in one respect. PCs use CR (Carriage
Return) and LF (Line Feed) characters at the end of each line, while the
Amiga only use LFs. To remove the extra CRs you should load the CrossDos
commodity which does this automatically. Alternatively, there are a few
PD programs to do this for you. Write or WordPad on the PC can correctly
display Amiga textfiles with Line Feeds.

@{u}Word Processing Files@{uu}

  Most PC Word Processing documents are incompatible with Amiga word
processors if saved in their native format. Some Amiga Word Processors
can import different types of files such as ASCII/Text or RTF (Rich Text
Format). For example, if you are using Microsoft Word you should save your
file twice, once in Word format and then in RTF format so that you do not
loose the formatting information (pictures etc may be lost). Wordworth 6
can read RTF files easily.

@{u}Spreadsheet/Database files@{uu}

  A lot of database programs have the option to export data
in many formats including CSV or @{b}Comma-delimited format@{ub} which 
writes the data in an ascii file with each field seperate by commas or other
delimitor characters and records by carriage returns/line feeds.

   Lotus 1-2-3 format is a another common Spreadsheet format and it is 
recognised by many PC and Amiga spreadsheet applications. The CSV format as
used by Database program can also be used.

@{u}Graphics Files@{uu}

  The PC has many graphic formats including common ones such as GIF and JPEG.
A good PC paint program such as PaintShopPro can convert between many formats
including Amiga IFF. There are other formats used by Clipart which are not
easily read by Amiga programs and may need to be converted first.

  Image processing packages such as ImageStudio, SuperView, ImageFX, Photogenics
and PPaint will allow you to load and save between images formats. Access to
datatypes is also an advantage.

@NODE ALTERN "Version 4 and Otherss"

@{u}Version 4 of PC-Task@{uu}

     The latest version can emulate a 80486 PC, has CD ROM support,
CyberGraphics and speed improvements. Cost is 69.99 pounds and is now
available from Wizard Developments. A demo is now available in
the archive PC-TASKDEMO40.LHA (or LZX) on aminet/misc/emu.

  Cost is AUD$114 or to upgrade from v3.1 is 35UKP (AUD$60) or from v2.0 
is AUD$84. The UK distributor is Wizard Developments.

     There are two versions available a Dynamic (similar to old Turbo 
which uses more memory) or Interpretive.  Speed is quite good but I tried 
running DOOM using AGA and it was s-l-o-w. Buying a real PC or console
would be much better for game playing!.

   The latest version is now 4.4 and the patches are available on Aminet
in aminet/misc/emu to upgrade from v4 upwards. Version 4.3 upwards now
supports Windows 95 although a 68060 and lots of RAM is required!
