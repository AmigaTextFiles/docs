@ENDNODE
@NODE WBMENU "1.1 Workbench menu"

1.1.1 Open

     This is used on a selected icon. Instead of double clicking on
an icon to show contents of a disk or drawer or run a program you
can select an icon with the pointer and Select Open to display or
run it.

1.1.2 Close

     Instead of clicking on the Close Gadget at the top left of a
disk or drawer window just select the window (borders blue) and 
select Close.

1.1.3 Duplicate

     This open allows you to copy files and disks. To copy a file 
select the icon and then select Duplicate. Another icon will appear
saying Copy_of_file or whatever, you can then move that file elsewhere
or Rename it.

1.1.4 Rename

     This option allows you to change the name of a disk, a drawer or
a file. Select the disk, drawer or file icon to rename, select rename,
and then type in the new name in the given requester.

1.1.5 Info

     This option displays details of a given disk, drawer or file.
Workbench has 5 types of workbench icons: Disk, Drawer, Trashcan,
Project and Tool. A Trashcan is a special drawer for use with the
'Empty Trash' feature to delete files. A Project is a data file and
a Tool is a Program. Info will display the type, size, stack size,
default file, comment and protection flags of a file.

1.1.6 Discard

     This is a delete function, to delete a file you would normally
drag and drop the file into the Trashcan drawer to empty later.
This option allows you to delete a file straight away. A requester
may appear to confirm deletion.

@ENDNODE
@NODE DISKMENU "1.2 Disk Menu"

1.2.1 Empty Trash

     This option deletes all the files in a selected Trashcan drawer
of a disk. This feature is useful because you may want to delete a
file but you could change your mind and decide to keep it, all you
have to do is to drag the file out of the Trashcan back to its
original drawer or disk.

1.2.2 Initialise

     This option formats a disk for use by the Amiga. It splits
the disk into the right number of tracks/sectors and creates an
empty root directory. It can also automatically create a Trashcan
drawer. To use, select the disk to format and select Initialise.

@ENDNODE
@NODE SPECMENU "1.3 Special Menu"

1.3.1 Cleanup

     This option rearrages icons on a drawer or disk into a less
cluttered state. To use, open the window to rearrange and select
Cleanup. To keep the icons in the new positions, select all the
icons and select 'Snapshot'.

1.3.2 Last Error

     This will display the last message that appeared in the menu
bar at the top of the screen.

1.3.3 Redraw

     If the screen or window has been corrupted by another program
and not all the icons or windows have been drawn then this option
will do it for you.

1.3.4 Snapshot

     This option allows you to save the position of an icon on a
disk or a drawer. To use, select the icon, drag the icon to its
new location and Snapshot it.

1.3.5 Version

     This will display the version of Workbench and Kickstart 
you are using. Commodore uses release numbers. For 1.3 it is 
release 34.

@ENDNODE
@NODE MOUSE "2. The Mouse"

     On the Amiga mouse there are two buttons. The Left Mouse Button
(LMB) and the Right Mouse Button (RMB). 

2.1 Using the Right Mouse Button

     To use the menus, press down the RMB and move the pointer to the
title bar at the top of the screen. Move the pointer over one of the
menu names and some menu items will appear. Now, still with the RMB
pressed, move the pointer down to the selected menu item and release
the RMB to select that item.

2.2 Using the Left Mouse Button

     This button is mainly used to select and move icons around and
click on gadgets (or buttons).

2.2.1 Clicking

    To select an icon move the pointer over the desired icon and then
click the LMB once. The icon will change to a reverse or an alternative
image to indicate it has been selected.

     When using gadgets such as those on windows (there are four gadgets
on a window: Close, Window-to-Front, Window-to-Back and Resize) move
the pointer over the desired gadget and click once to use that gadget.
The gadget will change briefly and also change the window.

2.2.2 Double-Clicking

     This is sometimes a tricky technique to use and requires a steady
hand. This method is used  to open disks, drawers and files or run
programs. To do this, move the pointer over the desired icon and in
quick succession (without moving the pointer) click on the LMB twice.
This should open the icon.

2.2.3 Dragging

    This technique allows you to move objects such as icons around the
screen or resizing windows. Select an icon with a single click, now keep
the LMB down and move the pointer, the icon will now be dragged with the
pointer. If you let go of the pointer the icon will be dropped into its 
new position. 

2.2.4 Multiple selection

    You can select more than one icon at a time. To do this, click on
the first icon, press the SHIFT key down (either one) and then click
on the second, third, fourth icons etc to select multiple icons
     You can also select a whole group of icons by pressing the LMB
at the top left of the icons and while keeping the LMB down moving the
power towards the bottom right. A expanding box will apear and the icons
in it will be selected.

 There  are  another set of error messages called `Guru Meditation' which
 is  displayed  when  the computer crashes. It consists of two numbers. the
 first is the error id and second the address of the task:

       ssggeeee aaaaaaaa

       ss = Subsystem Id, gg = general error, eeeee = specific error

       The most common ones are CPU traps:

@NODE PROBS "5. Common Problems"

5.1 How do I retreive a file I accidently deleted?

     You need to use a Disk Recovery program such as DiskDoctor, 
FixDisk or Disksalv to scan and recover the file. You cannot
retrieve a file that has been deleted and the disk written to
later on as it will most likely been overwritten!

5.2 How can I view hidden file from Workbench?

     There are a number of methods although the best is to use a
file manager program which can see all files and you can copy,
move, delete and view files very easily. Other than that you need
to resort to using the Shell.

5.3 How can I create a bootable disk?

     The simplest method is to Duplicate your Workbench disk, delete
the Utilities and the System files (if not required), copy the 
program to the disk and then edit the s:startup-sequence to run
your program. This method also guarentees that all the necessary
files are also on the disk.
     The minimum required to make a disk bootable is to use the Install
command to save a bootblock to the disk. Create a directory called S
and create a startup-sequence file with the name of the program and
save that in the S directory and copy your program to the disk.
To use install with one disk drive, type INSTALL ? then swap disks
and type DF0: and press RETURN.

5.4 How can I speed up disk access when using the shell?

     The shell is a very powerful feature but can be limiting and
annoying when working from floppy. You can make common commands
run from memory by using the Resident command which allows the Amiga
to use commands from memory instead of loading them from disk.
For example, Resident C:Dir pure will make the DIR command resident.
You can make this a permanent feature by modying the S:Shell-Startup
file and insert these resident commands.
     Also, it is a good idea to do all work on the RAM: disk if you
have plenty of memory instead of saving to/from disk.

5.5 Why do some icons, when double-clicked, don't load up?

     There are two reasons for this. First, if a program is deleted
but its .info file is left behind then the program or file may seen
to still exist. To rectify this, the program should be re-copied back.
     Second, a lot of Project icons have A Default Tool set. This 
default tool loads up the program and the data file. There are many
tools, particularly text and graphics viewers. If you try to run
a file with a Default Tool that you don't have then the following
message will appear: 'Unable to open the tool <file>'
If this happens, select the icon and choose Info from the Workbench
menu and change the Default tool to the one you do have. For example,
if its a text file, change it to 'More' (Workbench's Text Viewer).

@NODE IMPROV "Improving Workbench 1.3"

  Workbench 1.3 is one of the oldest and least usable of the Amiga's OS.
Over the years, plenty of utilities have been released to improve some
of the oversights of WB 1.3. 

  The following programs and packages could be installed to improve your
workbench. Some programs have been upgraded to WB2 or WB3 so check 
requirements first.

a) SID (and other directory utilities)
      SID was a very popular directory utility to organise files on your
   floppy disks or hard disk. A variant called MessySID allowed access to
   PC disks too. (Aminet/util/dir)

b) DMouse.
      A Mouse accelerator which included other options including screen
   saver, pointer blanker, auto window activation, programmable keys,
   window control etc. Essential! (Aminet/util/cli)

c) FixDisk or DiskSalv v1.x
      Essential disk repair programs for fixing floppy or hard disk 
   problems. Later versions only work on WB2 or better.
   (Aminet/disk/salv/)

d) PowerPacker
      Useful packing program with good viewers such as PPShow, PPMore
   to read/view normal or packed files.

e) ARP or Amiga Replacement Project
      A replacement for WB 1.3s older C commands and comes with the
   arp.library for standard file requesters before ASL and REQTOOLS 
   appeared. Difficult to find these days.

f) Magic Workbench.
      Yes, the ultimate icon package IS available for WB1.3 users.
   Look out for MagicWB1.3.lha in Aminet for useful WB 1.3 tools.
   (Aminet/pix/mwb)

g) MSH (or MessyDOS) and MultiDOS.
      This was available before CrossDOS appeared as standard. You will
   be able to read/write PC disks. (Aminet/misc/emu)

h) Virus Checkers
     WB 1.3 users have a big problem in this area as most new virus 
   checkers are for WB2 or better unless you know different?
   VirusX and Virus Checker v6.xx will remove older viruses though.
   (Aminet/util/virus)

i) HDClick - Program Launcher.
     WB1.3 does not have a Tools menu like WB2 or better, so other types
   of program launchers are available to quickly start your programs such
   as HDClick 2.01 (the last one before becoming WB2 only).

  Of course to keep really upto date is to upgrade to Workbench 3.1 and 
there are many advantages to do so:

a) Be able to run latest programs - commercial and PD.

b) Includes CrossDOS to read PC disks.

c) Includes Datatypes to access many file types esp. from other OS'
   and access to the Internet.

d) Compatibility is very high and there is way to degrade to 1.3 for
   older software (no AGA or fast processors in the way either).
   Use some of the Kicker software for this feature eg. SKick, Relokick.

e) Arexx included for program interaction and batch procesiing.

@NODE AUTHOR "The Author"

  This guide has been written for those people would like to make their
  Workbench more up to date and more productive for their use. I hope 
  some of the information will be useful. Almost all the programs described
  can be readily installed and used from the many utility collections, 
  the best place is the Aminet archives either via the Internet or on CD.
  There are some CDs with Workbench Enhancements included as one collection
  and are worth looking at.
