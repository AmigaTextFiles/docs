/* $VER: MOC 40.1 (28.11.98)
 *
 * MO file system entry for the FIRST PARTITION of AT-HD type MS-DOS FAT disks.
 *
 * This file enables CrossDOSFileSystem on an MO disk cartridge.
 *
 * CrossDOS reads the LowCyl and HighCyl information from of the MS-DOS
 * partition table on the disk. It should also read the block size; if not,
 * uncomment the SectorsPerBlock and SectorSize lines.
 *
 * There can be up to 10 partitions on an AT-HD type disk. Which one you
 * access is determined by the last letter of the device name, C for the first
 * partition, D for the second and so on.
 *
 * So this mount file for MOC: accesses the first partition. To access other
 * partitions, copy this mount file and rename to create MOD:, MOE:, etc.
