@node Introduction

@{line}@{u}Introduction@{uu}@{par}

The @{b}Amiga Magneto-Optical Drive FAQ@{ub} contains information about using
@{"magneto-optical (MO) disk drives" link What_are} with Amiga computers. It is
freely distributable providing no changes are made.@{par}

(In case you're not familiar with the acronym, FAQ stands for @{i}Frequently
Asked Questions@{ui}. Compilations of information about various subjects on the
Internet are commonly referred to as FAQs.)@{par}

I hope the availability of this document will encourage more Amiga users to
consider optical storage, instead of fragile magnetic media like
@{"Zip, Jaz" link Zip_Jaz_Problems} and SyQuest.@{par}

Please @{"contact me" link Contacting} if you have any comments, suggestions or
questions about this document or MO drives and media.@{par}

@node What_are "What are Magneto-Optical Disk Drives?"

@{line}@{u}What are Magneto-Optical Disk Drives?@{uu}@{par}

Magneto-optical ("MO") disk drives are versatile removable storage devices,
which use very robust and @{"inexpensive media" link Media_Costs}. You can use
an MO disk just like a large floppy disk, or like a hard disk. 3½" MO disks
can store up to 1.3GB, and 5¼" MO disks can store up to 5.2GB. There are many
@{"advantages" link Advantages} in using MO disks instead of other types of
media.@{par}

The @{"How MO Drives Work" link How_MO_Drives_Work} section explains how data
is written to and read from MO disks.@{par}

MO uses similar technology to Sony's increasingly popular Mini Disc format. If
you have used Mini Discs before, you will have some idea how rugged and
reliable MO disks are.@{par}

In Japan MO drives are very popular, more so than Iomega's Zip drives (which
seem to be inexplicably common in the West).@{par}

MO drives are available as internal or external, SCSI or IDE/ATAPI drives. MO
drives with USB and FireWire (IEEE 1394) interfaces have been introduced
recently. As yet there is no way of connecting USB or FireWire peripherals to
Amigas however.@{par}

MO "jukeboxes" are also available, but these are intended for business use as
they are expensive, and few Amiga users need to store hundreds of gigabytes of
data. Also, special driver software would be required and none exists for the
Amiga.@{par}

@node Advantages "Advantages of Magneto-Optical Storage"

@{line}@{u}Advantages of Magneto-Optical Storage@{uu}@{par}

Magneto-Optical storage has many advantages over other types of removable media:@{par}
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· Media life is at least 30 years, which greatly
exceeds that of magnetic media like floppy disks, Zip and Jaz disks. Some
manufacturers quote media life of 50 or even 100 years. Data can be rewritten
at least a million times, and read at least 10 million times; some
manufacturers quote figures ten times this. This figure also exceeds that for
magnetic media.@{line}@{par}
· There is no physical contact between disk surface and drive head, so there is
no possibility of data loss through a head crash.@{line}@{par}
· MO drives are @{"backwardly compatible" link Backward_Compatibility}, which
means that if you upgrade your drive in the future, you will be able to read
and write all your existing disks on the new drive.@{line}@{par}
· MO disks are not susceptible to magnetic fields.@{line}@{par}
· If, for example, you spill a cup of coffee on an MO disk, you can clean the
disk surface and continue to use the disk. @{"Cleaning kits" link Maintenance} are
available for both MO drives and disks.@{line}@{par}
· MO disks are simple in construction, unlike some other kinds of removable
media which may contain moving parts. This is another reason why MO offers
greater reliability than magnetic media.@{line}@{par}
· MO disks are available in several
@{"different capacities" link Types_of_MO_Media}, which vary in
@{"price" link Media_Costs}. Cost per megabyte is much lower than all other
kinds of random access removable media.@{line}@{par}
· Unlike Zip, Jaz, SyQuest etc., MO drives and disks are not proprietary; they
are made by many companies. The disks are covered by various international
standards. So you will not be stuck if your drive manufacturer goes bust, as
happened recently to SyQuest.@{line}@{par}
· Compared to other forms of optical storage, there are no restrictions on
writing and rewriting data to MO disks, unlike CD-R or CD-RW. Also unlike CD-R
& CD-RW, since the disk itself is protected by a plastic casing there is no
danger of data corruption due to the disk getting scratched.@{line}@{par}
· MO drives normally automatically verify written data to guarantee data
integrity. There is no such verification with CD-R, CD-RW or most types of
magnetic media, so to be assured that the data has been written properly when
using these, you would need to manually compare all copied files.@{line}@{par}
· MO drives have much shorter seek times than PD and DVD-RAM drives.@{line}@{par}
· Magneto-optical technology is well-proven. I believe the first ISO standard
5¼" MO drives were released in 1989 or 1990, with 128MB 3½" MO drives becoming
available in 1991. 640MB 3½" drives have been available since 1996. Originally
MO was largely restricted to professional use due to high drive cost, but over
the past couple of years this situation has changed.@{line}@{par}
· MO disks are convenient, compact and easy to use. 3½" MO disks are the same
size as two floppy disks stacked on top of each other. They have a
write-protect tab which works just like a floppy disk's.@{pard}@{par}

@node How_MO_Drives_Work "How MO Drives Work"

@{line}@{u}How MO Drives Work@{uu}@{par}

This section describes the theory of operation of MO drives. It is quite
technical; it is not necessary to understand this in order to use a
magneto-optical drive.@{par}

Magneto-optical drives use, as the name suggests, both magnetic and optical
effects to read and write data. A layer within the media contains magnetically
sensitive elements. When this layer is heated to its "Curie point", about
200°C, the polarity of the magnetic elements can be changed by an external
magnetic field from the drive head.@{par}

To write data, on normal media two disk revolutions are needed. On the first
revolution, a magnetic field is applied and the laser heats up the target area
of the disk to its Curie point. This causes the magnetic elements to all align
themselves parallel with the magnetic field. This effectively erases the target
area, recording all 0 bits. On the next revolution of the disk, the magnetic
field is reversed, and the laser heats up only those areas which are to have 1s
recorded.@{par}

Because the written magnetic polarity is "frozen into" the disk, MO disks are
not susceptible to magnetic fields as magnetic media are.@{par}

Data is read from the disk in a purely optical way. The laser is used at a low
power which does not heat the disk. Depending on the recorded magnetic
polarity, the polarity of the laser light reflected from the disk is rotated a
few degrees either way. This rotation is called the Kerr effect. The drive
detects this, and thus determines whether a 0 or 1 was read.@{par}


@{b}LIMDOW Media@{ub}@{par}

Use of @{"LIMDOW media" link LIMDOW} significantly improves write speeds.
LIMDOW-capable drives can read and write to conventional MO disks too.@{par}

When a LIMDOW disk is inserted, the drive detects this and enables additional
control over the laser. LIMDOW disks have a different composition to normal
media, which makes it possible to rewrite data in a single revolution rather
than the two required by conventional disks.@{par}

The drive records data by heating areas of the disk to their Curie point, as
with conventional media. However, depending on the laser beam power, the
magnetic element orients itself with either the external magnetic field or with
a reference layer that is built into the disk. Thus data can be written in a
single pass.@{par}

Data is read from LIMDOW media in the same way as from conventional media.@{par}

@endnode


@node Types_of_MO_Media "Types of MO Media"

@{line}@{u}Types of MO Media@{uu}@{par}

There are two physical media sizes, 3½" and 5¼". This document concentrates in
some places on 3½" drives and media, since 3½" MO drives are cheaper than 5¼"
ones, and I have had less experience with 5¼" drives.@{par}

A 3½ MO disk looks similar to a 3½" floppy disk, except twice as thick. There
is a metal shutter covering the disk surface, and a write-protect tab in the
corner, just like a floppy disk. If you open the shutter, the disk inside has a
similar appearance to the surface of a CD.
@{"Click here" link Images/3½_MO.jpg/main} to see a picture of a 3½" MO disk,
and @{"here" link Images/5¼_MO.jpg/main} for a picture of some 5¼" MO disks.@{par}

Whilst there are two physical disk sizes, there are several different disk
capacities. 3½" MO disks are currently available in the these capacities:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· 128MB (512-byte sectors)@{par}
· 230MB (512-byte sectors)@{par}
· 540MB (512-byte sectors), 640MB (2048-byte sectors)@{par}
· 1.3GB (2048-byte sectors)@{pard}@{par}

5¼" MO disks are currently available in these capacities:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· 600MB (512-byte sectors), 650MB (1024-byte sectors)@{par}
· 1.2GB (512-byte sectors), 1.3GB (1024-byte sectors)@{par}
· 2.3GB (512-byte sectors), 2.6GB (1024-byte sectors)@{par}
· 4.1GB (512-byte sectors), 4.8GB (1024-byte sectors), 5.2GB (2048-byte sectors)@{pard}@{par}

The only difference between 540MB and 640MB 3½" MO disks is the sector size. It
is 512 bytes for 128MB, 230MB and 540MB disks, but 2048 bytes for 640MB disks.
There is no real advantage to Amiga users in buying 540MB disks if you have a
640MB drive, unless you for some reason want to use a FastFileSystem version
earlier than 40.1 (see the @{"Amiga Requirements" link Amiga_Requirements} section),
or use an operating system which does not support sector sizes greater than 512
bytes, such as NetBSD. Also, performance of 512-byte-sectors media with
Macintosh emulators or a real Mac or PC computer may be better. A similar thing
applies to 5¼" MO disks, 600MB vs 650MB, 4.1GB vs 5.2GB, etc.@{par}

3½" MO disks are single-sided. 5¼" ones are double-sided, and half the quoted
capacity is accessed at a time. The disk is turned over to access the other
half.@{par}

MO media can be bought as unformatted, or formatted for MS-DOS or Macintosh. If
you're using a Mac emulator, you may wish to buy Mac formatted disks. For Amiga
use it doesn't matter; you can just do a Format QUICK on the disk to make it
ready for use, which only takes a few seconds.@{par}

MO disks are low-level formatted and usually certified at the factory.
Certified disks have had their surface checked and any bad sectors are
remapped. If you buy an uncertified disk (I don't know whether these are
available), it will be a good idea to @{"low-level format" link Low-Level} it
before use.@{par}

More recent disk capacities (230MB, 540MB and 640MB for 3½" disks) are also
available in @{"LIMDOW" link LIMDOW} variants, also known as "direct
overwrite". Writing to LIMDOW disks is faster than to normal disks.@{par}

In common with hard disk manufacturers, MO disk capacities are usually quoted
in @{i}millions of bytes@{ui}, as opposed to the usual computer terminology
where 1 megabyte = 1024×1024 = 1,048,576 bytes. The quoted figure is the
unformatted capacity. For example, the formatted capacity of a 640MB 3½" disk
is 635,600,896 bytes, which is just over 606 megabytes.@{par}

@endnode


@node LIMDOW "LIMDOW Media"

@{line}@{u}LIMDOW Media@{uu}@{par}

You may have heard of LIMDOW media. LIMDOW stands for @{i}Light Intensity
Modulation Direct OverWrite@{ui}, and is also known as "direct overwrite".@{par}

When using convential MO disks, in order for the drive to write a sector to
disk, it erases the sector, writes the new data, and then verifies the
just-written data. (You can enable or disable verification by using a DIP
switch on the drive, or by sending the appropriate command to the drive.) This
requires three revolutions of the disk.@{par}

With LIMDOW media and a LIMDOW-capable drive, the new data can be written with
no need for the old data to be erased first. This means that writing speed is
increased by about 50%. Without verification, writing speed would be almost
doubled.@{par}

The down side to this is that, at least for the moment, LIMDOW media is more
expensive than normal media.@{par}

@endnode


@node Backward_Compatibility "Backward Compatibility"

@{line}@{u}Backward Compatibility@{uu}@{par}

The first generation of 3½" MO drives could only use 128MB disks. Second
generation 230MB drives can read and write 128MB and 230MB disks. Current 640MB
3½" drives can read and write 128MB, 230MB, 540MB and 640MB disks (early 640MB
drives could not write to 128MB disks). 1.3GB drives have recently been
released by Fujitsu and Philips, and are read- and write-compatible with all
previous types of disk as well as the new 1.3GB "Gigamo" disks. You can read
about this drive on the @{"Fujitsu Europe web site" link Where_To_Get}.@{par}

Similarly, 5¼" MO drives are also backwardly compatible. First generation
600/650MB drives were available in 1989 or 1990. Later generations supported
1.2/1.3GB and then 2.3/2.6GB disks. Current drives can read and write
4.1/4.8/5.2GB disks, and most can at least read all older generations. Current
@{"Sony" link Where_To_Get} drives can only write to 2.3/2.6GB and
4.1/4.8/5.2GB disks, not the older 600/650MB and 1.2/1.3GB disks.
@{"Nikon" link Where_To_Get} drives can read and write all generations, from
600/650MB to 4.1/4.8/5.2GB.@{par}

@node Media_Costs "Media Costs"

@{line}@{u}Media Costs@{uu}@{par}

Cost per megabyte of MO media is much lower than other removable media like
Zip, Jaz and LS120 disks. @{"LIMDOW media" link LIMDOW} is more expensive, but
still works out cheaper than other types of removable media.@{par}

This section illustrates the relative price differences between MO disks and
other types of removable media. It is not intended to be comprehensive or
up-to-date or to cover all countries, just as a guide to how much cheaper MO
disks are. Check a current computer magazine for up-to-date prices. Macintosh
magazines are likely to have more adverts for MO drives and disks than PC ones.@{par}

Here are some costs for various types of MO media in the UK. They are the
lowest prices that I have seen advertised. The prices below exclude 17.5% VAT
(sales tax), figures are in pounds sterling:@{code}

finding cheap MO media are @{fg shine}http://shopper.com/@{fg text} and
@{fg shine}http://www.pricewatch.com/@{fg text}.@{par}

Unlike proprietary systems like Zip and Jaz, MO drives and media are made by
many different manufacturers. This is partly why MO disks are so much cheaper.
With the Zip and Jaz, Iomega makes a large profit on the media allowing them to
sell the bare drives quite cheaply, whereas different manufacturers of MO media
are competing. MO disks are made by at least BASF, Dysan, Fujifilm, Fujitsu,
IBM, Imation (3M), Maxell, Maxoptix, Olympus, Philips, Ricoh, Sony, TDK and
Verbatim.@{par}

@endnode


@node Drive_Costs "Drive Costs"

@{line}@{u}Drive Costs@{uu}@{par}

MO drives are usually more expensive than similar capacity magnetic media
drives. However, given the low media cost, they will be more economical if you
have more than a couple of disks. Drives are commonly bundled with several
disks, making the cost very competitive with other removable media.@{par}

Compared with Iomega's recently released 250MB Zip drive, a 230MB MO drive is
the same price from some resellers.@{par}

For example, here are some MO drive prices in pounds sterling:@{code}

@{jcenter}Fujitsu 230MB internal                       100
Fujitsu 230MB with one 230MB disk            140
Philips MO 230 with one 230MB disk           140
Philips Pegasus MO 230 with ten 230MB disks  175
Fujitsu DynaMO 640SE with one 640MB disk     215
Philips MO 640 with one 640MB disk           200@{par}@{body}@{jleft}

Unless stated, these prices are for external SCSI drives; internal models cost
less, so if you have a tower case or a spare internal drive bay you can get one
of them. If your Amiga has an IDE/ATAPI controller, you can consider buying an
ATAPI rather than SCSI drive. But remember that with an external unit, you can
easily connect the MO drive up to a Mac or PC.@{par}

In comparison, buying other types of removable drive with this amount of
storage may cost significantly more; and of course magnetic removable media
does not have the same level of reliability as MO. Some example prices are:@{code}

@{jcenter}Zip 100MB with one disk                       70
SyQuest EZFlyer 230MB with one disk          100
Zip 250MB with one disk                      140
Jaz 1GB with one disk                        190
SyQuest SyJet 1.5GB with one disk            200
Jaz 2GB with one disk                        250@{par}@{body}@{jleft}

@{line}@{u}Drive Specifications@{uu}@{par}

Modern 3½" 640MB MO drives are fast enough to be used as general storage or
like a hard disk. However, writes are slower than reads, and if you are
planning on using an MO disk for very write-intensive applications, you should
probably use @{"LIMDOW media" link LIMDOW} to speed up writes. For general
backup, file storage and running applications & games from, non-LIMDOW disks
are fine. Note that the seek time will not be as quick as most modern hard
disks.@{par}

Fujitsu's latest 3½" drives have an improved average seek time of 23ms.@{par}

Overall write speed will be about 1/3 of the maximum transfer rate for standard
disks with verification enabled. It is about 1/2 of the maximum when using
LIMDOW media with verification, or normal media without verification. Maximum
write speed is achieved with LIMDOW media and verification disabled.@{par}

The drive has 2MB of buffer RAM which improves read and write speeds. Operation
of the read-ahead cache can be seen when reading data from the drive; the
drive's own activity LED only flashes occasionally (corresponding to when data
is actually read from the disk), whereas the Amiga's SCSI activity LED is on
constantly (corresponding to data being transferred from drive to computer).
Earlier MO drives had less buffer RAM; the first 640MB drives had 512KB. Some
5¼" drives have 8MB.@{par}

There is also a @{"write-back cache" link About_Write_Cache} which can speed up
writes, especially small ones. You may wish to disable the write-back cache to
guarantee data integrity. However, there should not be a problem if you are
aware of how the cache works.@{par}

The read speed of my 640MB drive easily outpaces the capability of my
1991-vintage GVP SCSI controller. For writing, on my system I get over 1MB per
second using a direct overwrite 640MB disk, FFS 43.20 and DiskSpeed 4.2.@{par}

page.@{par}

@node Maintenance "Maintenance"

@{line}@{u}Maintenance@{uu}@{par}

If you ever have trouble reading all disks on your MO drive, the drive lens may
need to be cleaned. Over time, dust settling on the lens can hinder the drive's
ability to read data. A cleaning cartridge for your drive will be available
from the drive manufacturer. It is very important to realise that the cleaning
cartridge is specific to each type of drive; you cannot use (say) a Sony
cleaning cartridge with a Fujitsu drive. Attempting to do so may damage the
drive.@{par}

If the problem is specific to a certain disk, the surface of that disk may need
cleaning. Fujitsu, IBM and Verbatim are three sources for these. Non-brand name
combined MO & Mini Disc disk cleaners are available very cheaply; less then 2
pounds.@{par}

Disk cleaners are quite simple to use. They basically consist of a jig into
which you put the MO disk, plus a cleaning cloth and solution. There is a notch
on the jig so that the disk shutter is held open. A knob in the centre of the
jig is turned to rotate the disk, and repeatedly wiping the exposed surface and
turning the knob cleans the whole surface.@{par}

Just how often you will need to clean your disks and drive depends on how dusty
an environment they are in, and how much they are used. In a domestic or office
setting, cleaning disks should only be needed very occasionally, and cleaning
the drive even less so. I have not needed to clean my drive or any disks since I
bought it in early 1998.@{par}

@node Choosing "Choosing an MO Drive"

@{line}@{u}Choosing an MO Drive@{uu}@{par}

Once you have decided to buy an MO drive, which type should you choose? This
section contains some things which you need to consider.@{par}

What disk capacity do you need? Of course this depends on what you will be
using the drive for. For storing a large quantity of files downloaded from the
Internet, backing up a large collection of floppy disks, or large hard disk
partitions, using higher capacity disks can be much more convenient.@{par}

For professional use, a 2.6GB or 5.2GB 5¼" drive is a possibility. These drives
are widely used in professional audio and video applications, e.g. for
direct-to-disk audio recording. For most users, the cost of a new 5¼" drive
will be too high, though used older-generation drives are sometimes available
very cheaply.@{par}

This narrows it down to a 3½" unit; 230MB, 640MB or maybe one of the new 1.3GB
drives. Unsurprisingly, 1.3GB drives are considerably more expensive than 640MB
ones. Compared to 230MB drives, I think the higher cost of a 640MB drive is
well worth it, given the extra storage capacity and data transfer speed.@{par}

Which manufacturer's product should you buy? If you want a 1.3GB 3½" drive,
Fujitsu Europe recently released their DynaMO 1300SD external drive. Philips
will be selling a rebadged version of this. The Fujitsu DynaMO 640SE or
Philips MO 640 may be the best value 640MB external drives. The Fujitsu model
comes in a dark-coloured casing, while Philips' rebadged version has a
white/cream colour casing. Fujitsu also make a faster 3½" mechanism with a spin
speed of 4300rpm, compared to 3600rpm for their other drives. You may want to
investigate which companies sell units incorporating this faster mechanism; I
believe the DynaMO 640SE uses the slower 3600rpm drive.@{par}

Recently Fujitsu introduced a new line of 640MB drive mechanisms, which have an
improved seek time, 28ms average compared with 35ms for the older M2513 drives.
The new MCC3064 mechanism is used in the DynaMO 640SE, but some drives from
other companies may still use the older M2513 mechanism. Getting a drive with
the faster seek time is a good idea, especially if you are planning on using it
for intensive applications, e.g. use like a hard drive for booting from.@{par}

Olympus recently introduced their own external 640MB drive. I do not know how
much this costs, but it may be a good option.@{par}

The best (at least, going from the spec sheet) 230MB drive mechanism is made by
Olympus. External units are sold by Olympus and Philips; they are identical
apart from the case colour. This drive has a 4500rpm spin speed and 1MB cache.@{par}

There are many products available for storing 3½" floppy disks. MO disks come
in individual hard plastic cases, though you could instead store them in a 3½"
disk box.@{par}

For portable storage, anything which holds an even number of 3½" floppy disks
on top of each other should hold 3½" MO disks nicely. For example, the aidata
"DiskToGo/2" product (model: 3502-4) is excellent for storing a single 3½" MO
disk. The Allsop "DiskFile 2" product is similar. These are probably sturdy
enough for sending MO disks by mail, but you should use a padded envelope in
any case. A box for holding ten 3½" floppy disks will hold five 3½" MO disks.@{par}

MO disks usually come with a two stick-on labels. If you run out of labels,
there is no problem; standard 3½" floppy disk labels fit nicely.@{par}

@node Amiga_Requirements "Amiga Requirements"

@{line}@{u}Amiga Requirements@{uu}@{par}

This section describes what hardware and software you need to have in order to
use an MO drive.@{par}

@{line}@{b}Hardware Requirements@{ub}@{par}

You need a SCSI controller in order to use a SCSI drive.@{par}

There are MO drives available which use the IDE/ATAPI interface, for example
Fujitsu's MCA3064AP 640MB drive. It is probably possible to use these with an
A1200 or A4000's built-in IDE controller in conjunction with software like
"IDEfix", but I have not tried this.@{par}

@{line}@{b}Software Requirements@{ub}@{par}

No special software is needed.@{par}

For using media with sector size other than 512 bytes, for example 640MB or
1.3GB 3½" disks, you will need to use FastFileSystem version 40.1 or later,
which is in the Kickstart 3.1 ROM, and on the AmigaOS 3.1 Install disk.@{par}

FFS 40.1 is compatible with Kickstarts 1.2 & 1.3, so it is probably possible to
use 640MB or 1.3GB 3½" MO disks under even these old operating systems. I have
not tested this; perhaps the only problem will be in finding a suitable
1.x-compatible Mount command. It will definitely be possible to use 512-byte
sectors MO media with these old OS versions and almost any FFS version, or the
ROM OFS.@{par}

You can download the latest beta version of the FastFileSystem from the Amiga
Inc. web site at:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.amiga.de/@{fg text}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

I am currently using FFS 43.20 with my 640MB MO drive. The beta FFS versions
seem to require at least AmigaOS 3.1. Alternatively, you can use another
filesystem such as @{"SFS" link Finding} or PFS2. If using disks with a sector
size other than 512 bytes, make sure that whichever filesystem you use supports
that sector size! PFS2 does not @{i}officially@{ui} support sector sizes
greater than 1024 bytes.@{par}

If you want to use HDToolBox to create RDBs on your MO disks, be aware that
HDToolBox only allows RDBs to be installed on direct access devices, i.e. hard
disks. See the @{"Drive Settings (DIP switches)" link Drive_Settings} section
for more information on the two selectable device types. I have created a
@{"patch for HDToolBox" link HDToolBox_Patch} to allow you to use HDToolBox
with MO drives that are set to "optical memory device" mode.@{par}

For information on reading and writing PC and Macintosh-formatted MO disks and
using the drive under @{"ShapeShifter" link Finding}, see the
@{"Cross-Platform Access" link Cross-Platform} section and the
@{"mount files" link Mount_Files}.@{par}

SCSI utility programs such as @{"SCSIUtil" link Finding} can be used to eject
the disk, instead of having to press the Eject button on the drive. You can
prevent and allow manual disk ejection with the same program. See the
@{"example scripts" link Example_Scripts}.@{par}

I have not tried using a large capacity 5¼" MO drive or disks with my Amiga.
However, all current sizes are unlikely to be a problem. Remember that 5¼"
disks are double-sided, and you turn over the disk to access the other half
capacity. So with a 5.2GB MO disk, each side holds 2.6GB of data. There are
none of the problems associated with hard disks larger than 4GB. Some programs
including HDToolBox may get confused and report negative amounts of space free,
but this should be harmless, and happens with any drive/partition over 2GB.@{par}

For use with alternative operating systems such as NetBSD, you may need to use
media with 512-byte sectors if the OS only supports this sector size. You may
not be able to use 640MB 3½" MO disks for example, since they have 2048-byte
sectors. You can use 540MB disks instead.@{par}

@node Drive_Settings "Drive Settings (DIP switches)"

@{line}@{u}Drive Settings (DIP switches)@{uu}@{par}

To set up an MO drive for use on your Amiga, you need to set the following
options using the MO drive's DIP switches:@{line}
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· Set the SCSI ID to one which is not currently in
use.@{line}@{par}
· You may need to set the @{"device type" link Device_Type} to "direct access",
if your SCSI controller driver is old or badly written.@{line}@{par}
· Set "Macintosh mode" to off. I don't know what this setting means exactly,
but my drive works okay with this switch off. I have not tried it when the Mac
mode switch is on. According to Fujitsu: "Because of the differing ways that
both Apple Macintosh and PC hosts respond to the status of the drive, set this
switch accordingly. Mac mode ON will disable the 'UNIT ATTENTION' reporting on
power up and media change."@{line}@{par}
· If your drive supports SCAM (which stands for @{i}SCSI Configured
AutoMatically@{ui}), disable this feature.@{line}@{par}
· Enable or disable termination depending on whether your MO drive is the last
device in the SCSI chain. You may want to leave the disable the drive's
termination and use an external active SCSI terminator instead. This may be
necessary if your SCSI chain is very long.@{line}@{par}
· Consider whether you want to have the write-back cache enabled. By default,
most drives have it enabled. Generally, having it enabled should not cause any
problems, but see the @{"About the Write-Back Cache" link About_Write_Cache} section
for more information.@{line}@{par}
· Set the verify mode. When disabled, the speed of write operations is improved
by approximately 50%, however data integrity cannot be guaranteed. The
improvement when using @{"LIMDOW media" link LIMDOW} is about 100%. I recommend
that you @{b}always enable verify mode@{ub}.@{pard}@{par}

@endnode


@node Device_Type "Setting the Device Type"

@{line}@{u}Setting the Device Type@{uu}@{par}

MO drives usually have a DIP switch to set the device type mode. Depending on
how this is set, the drive reports itself as a @{i}direct access device@{ui} (type
0, the normal value for hard disks), or as an @{i}optical memory device@{ui} (type
7, the normal value for optical disks). In the absence of problems, it is
probably best to set the device type to optical memory.@{par}

Some programs, especially those that access SCSI drives directly, may check the
device type and refuse to work with drives of type other than zero. Commodore's
HDToolBox is an example of this, though I have developed a
@{"patch" link HDToolBox_Patch} to get around this problem. Some SCSI drivers
might refuse to boot from non-type-0 devices. My old GVP controller does not
have this problem.@{par}

The ShapeShifter Macintosh emulator refuses to boot from non-type-0 devices.
You can @{"patch ShapeShifter" link ShapeShifter_Patch} to fix this problem.@{par}

Apart from the reported device type, in direct access mode two hard disk mode
pages are returned, which are not returned in optical memory mode. They are:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· format device (page 3)@{par}
· fixed disk geometry (page 4)@{pard}@{par}

The values for number of cylinders, heads and sectors per track given in these
two pages are "fake", for compatibility with PCs. For example, for 640MB
disks, the geometry values reported in the device format and rigid disk
parameter pages are 606 cylinders, 8 heads and 64 sectors per track, which
implies that the total number of sectors is 606×8×64 = 310272. The actual
number of sectors is 310352; some hard disk partitioning programs may use the
606×8×64 value instead of working out values based on the total disk size.@{par}

@node Mounting_and_Using "Mounting and Using the Drive and Disks"

@{line}@{u}Mounting and Using the Drive and Disks@{uu}@{par}

Using a @{"mount file" link Mount_Files} to access the drive is the best option
if you want to use the MO disk for general data storage, and not for booting
from. This gives the maximum amount of free disk space, and disks formatted
like this will be easily interchangeable between Amigas.@{par}

If you want to boot from an MO disk, you must create an RDB (Rigid Disk Block)
on the disk, just as you would with a SCSI hard drive. You can use HDToolBox or
another hard disk partitioning program to do this. Using the RDB method, you
can create several partitions on a single MO disk. Many partitioning programs
come up with their own "fake" values for Cylinders, Heads and BlocksPerTrack,
which mean that some space is wasted. This can also cause problems if you use
two different partitioning programs, which use different sets of fake values.
Rather than accepting the program's defaults, you should adjust the values for
Cylinders, Heads and BlocksPerTrack so that:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{b}Cylinders@{ub} × @{b}Heads@{ub} × @{b}BlocksPerTrack@{ub} = @{b}total number of sectors on disk@{ub}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}
To find suitable values for these parameters, refer to the prime factors in the
table below. For other types of disk you can use @{"PFactor" link Finding}.@{par}

If you reduce the (logical) number of blocks per track, the RDB will take up
less space on the disk. Be careful not to make it too small though, in case you
decide to add another filesystem in future; the RDB may be too small to hold
it.@{par}

Hopefully an example will clarify this. 640MB disks have 310352 sectors.
310352 = 2×2×2×2×7×17×163, so some suitable values for Cylinders, Heads and
BlocksPerTrack might be@{code}
@{jcenter}Cylinders = 17×163 = 2771,  Heads = 2,       BlocksPerTrack = 2×2×2×7 = 56@{line}@{jleft}@{body}

@{jcenter}Cylinders = 2×7×163 = 2282, Heads = 2×2 = 4, BlocksPerTrack = 2×17 = 34   @{par}@{jleft}@{body}

There are several @{"mount files" link Mount_Files} in the DOSDrivers-3½ and
DOSDrivers-5¼ drawers which are part of the Amiga MO FAQ distribution. You can
modify these if you need to create a mount file for other filesystems such as
PFS2.@{par}

@{b}TO CREATE SOME KIND OF STANDARD FOR AMIGA-FORMATTED MO DISKS, ALWAYS USE 2
RESERVED BLOCKS@{ub}.@{par}

The exact values of Cylinders, Surfaces, HighCyl and BlocksPerTrack are not
important, provided that:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{b}Surfaces@{ub} × @{b}BlocksPerTrack@{ub} × (@{b}HighCyl@{ub}+1) = @{b}total number of sectors on disk@{ub}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

For 640MB 3½" disks, this means that:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{b}Surfaces@{ub} × @{b}BlocksPerTrack@{ub} × (@{b}HighCyl@{ub}+1) = @{b}310352@{ub}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

This is to ensure that MO disks are easily interchangeable between different
Amigas. If @{b}Surfaces@{ub} × @{b}BlocksPerTrack@{ub} × (@{b}HighCyl@{ub}+1)
is less than the number of sectors in the disk, you waste disk space, and would
need to also send a copy of your mount file when sending an MO disk to someone.@{par}

If you use a mount file to mount the drive, you can use MO disks just as you
would floppy disks. Ejecting and inserting a new disk should be automatically
detected by the Amiga.@{par}

If you insert an MO disk with RDB after booting your Amiga, you will need to
use a program such as @{"SCSIMounter" link Finding} in order to mount the
partition(s) on that disk.@{par}

It's easy to format a new MO disk for use. If using a mount file, you can just
insert the disk and type a command like:@{code}
@{jcenter}Format DRIVE MO0: NAME "My MO disk" NOICONS FFS QUICK@{par}@{jleft}@{body}
(Replace MO0: with whatever drive name you have mounted MO disks of that
capacity as.) The MO disk will be ready for use in a couple of seconds. It is
not necessary to do a full format (i.e., not to use the QUICK option), but you
can if you want.@{par}

You may wish to perform a @{"low-level format" link Low-Level} on your MO disks
at some point. This is advisable if you buy uncertified disks.@{par}

@{line}@{u}Using Different Disk Capacities@{uu}@{par}

As mentioned in the @{"Types of MO Media" link Types_of_MO_Media} section, MO
drives can use several different capacities of disk. Since there is currently
no @{"special MO driver software" link For_Programmers} for the Amiga, it is
not possible to access different capacity MO disks using the same device name
(but see @{"Mounting and Using the Drive and Disks" link Mounting_and_Using}).@{par}

On my Amiga, I mount the MO0: device to access 640MB MO disks. To access 128MB,
230MB or 540MB media, I would have to use other mount files, e.g. for devices
@{"MO128:" link DOSDrivers-3½/FFS/MO128/Main},
@{"MO230:" link DOSDrivers-3½/FFS/MO230/Main} and
@{"MO540:" link DOSDrivers-3½/FFS/MO540/Main}, in order to access disks of these
capacities. This is not a major problem, since you will probably mostly use
disks of the highest capacity your drive can handle. See the
@{"mount files" link Mount_Files}.@{par}

It should be possible to use the following mount file with any AT-HD formatted
disk, no matter what the partition layout. Mounting MOC: will access the first
partition on the disk. To access other partitions, you need to copy and rename
MOC to MOD, MOE, etc. CrossDOS determines which partition to mount by looking
at the last letter of the device name; C for the first partition, D for the
second and so on. This mount file is based on the one on Aminet as
disk/misc/mount_msdos.lha, which was created by Dirk Eismann and Volker Remuß.@{code}
@{jcenter}@{"  PC AT-HD (MOC:)  " link DOSDrivers-3½/PC/MOC/Main}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

These AT-HD type mount files can be used with disks which have been formatted
on a PC, with a single partition. CrossDOS is not able to format disks of this
type, but you can read and write them. It is probably better to use the MOC

@{line}@{u}Example AmigaDOS Scripts@{uu}@{par}

I have created some simple AmigaDOS scripts for use with MO drives. They can
also be used for e.g. CD-ROM drives. They have icons, and so can be run from
Workbench; the default tool is IconX. The scripts make use of Gary Duncan's
@{"SCSIUtil" link Finding} program.@{par}

Since the scripts are simply single AmigaDOS commands, you can for example
configure a program like ToolsDaemon with menu items to eject the disk, and
allow/prevent medium removal.@{par}

You will need to edit the scripts to use the correct device name and unit
number for your drive.@{par}

AllowMORemoval can be useful if you have been using a Mac emulator to access
the MO drive as a SCSI device. If the emulated Mac crashes or hangs up, you
will need to tell the drive to allow medium removal in order to eject the
disk. Also HDToolBox has the habit of preventing ejection.@{code}

@node HDToolBox_Patch "HDToolBox Patch"

@{line}@{u}HDToolBox Patch@{uu}@{par}

HDToolBox is Commodore's utility for partitioning and formatting SCSI storage
devices such as hard disks, and is supplied on the AmigaOS Install disk.@{par}

HDToolBox cannot be properly used with an MO drive that is set to "optical
memory device" mode, as opposed to "direct access device", which is normal for
hard disks. The same applies to Panasonic's PD rewriteable drives.@{par}

HDToolBox checks the @{"device type" link Device_Type}, and if non-zero refuses
to read data from the drive. Type 0 is direct access, type 7 is optical memory.
This is not a major problem as MO drives typically have a
@{"DIP switch" link Drive_Settings} to set the device type. Nevertheless, it
would be nice to use HDToolBox with an MO drive in optical memory device mode.@{par}

That is what the following patch allows. It modifies HDToolBox to work with
both devices of type 0 and type 7. Luckily, because HDToolBox is written in C,
there were just enough spare instructions so that I didn't have to alter the
program size.@{par}

I have created patches for five versions of HDToolBox:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· Version 2.2 is on the "Amiga Developer CD v1.1".@{par}

@node Low-Level "Low-Level Formatting"

@{line}@{u}Low-Level Formatting@{uu}@{par}

Low-level formatting is different from high-level formatting, which is done
when you use the AmigaDOS Format command. This section gives a detailed
explanation of what happens when a disk is low-level formatted and how bad
sectors are remapped. You don't have to understand this in order to use MO
disks.@{par}

The primary and secondary defect lists (PDL and SDL for short) are areas on the
disk that store information about which sectors are bad, so that the drive
knows to map the bad sectors out. This is all transparent to the Amiga, it is
handled by the drive.@{par}

When a disk is low-level formatted, the drive completely erases the disk and
checks its surface for defective sectors. If any bad sectors are found their
positions are recorded in the PDL, and mapped out using a "sector slipping"
algorithm. For a new disk, sectors recorded in the PDL correspond to sectors
which really are bad, due to imperfections in the disk manufacturing process.@{par}

MO disks are normally low-level formatted and certified at the factory, so you
do not need to low-level format new disks (but see below for my experience with
a Sony 230MB disk). However, it is possible that some brands of disk are not
certified (that is, the disk surface has not been checked at the factory). It
is a good idea to low-level format uncertified disks before use. Almost all
makes of MO disk are certified at the factory; it should say so on the disk
packaging.@{par}

MO disks have a number of spare sectors which are used when bad sectors are
remapped. For example, 640MB 3½" disks have 2244 spare sectors. Typically the
number of bad sectors recorded in the PDL of a new disk is between 0 and 7.@{par}

The use of sector slipping means that bad sectors found during low-level
formatting do not slow down disk access at all. It works like this. Suppose
that sectors 3 and 7 are bad. Then the logical sectors as seen by the Amiga
correspond to physical sectors like this:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{b}Logical       Physical
@{u}sector @{uu}       @{u} sector@{ub} @{uu}
   0 @{b}---------->@{ub} 0    
   1 @{b}---------->@{ub} 1    
   2 @{b}---------->@{ub} 2    
             @{b}BAD@{ub} 3    
   3 @{b}---------->@{ub} 4    
   4 @{b}---------->@{ub} 5    
   5 @{b}---------->@{ub} 6    
             @{b}BAD@{ub} 7    
   6 @{b}---------->@{ub} 8    
   7 @{b}---------->@{ub} 9    @{par}@{jleft}@{body}

When accessing the disk, the drive simply skips over the bad sectors. The extra
time needed to skip a sector is simply the time taken for one sector to be read,
which is very small.@{par}

The secondary defect list is used to record sectors which go bad @{i}after@{ui} the
disk has been low-level formatted. If a disk is quite old and has been used for
a long time, dust or dirt on the surface may cause some sectors to become bad.
If a verify error occurs when a sector is written to, the drive remaps that
sector and records its position in the SDL.@{par}

Unlike bad sectors which are found during a low-level format, it is not
possible to use a sector slipping algorithm for sectors which become bad later.
Instead a linear replacement algorithm is used. For this, the drive replaces
the bad sector by a sector from the spare area. This method of replacement does
slow down access to replaced sectors, because the drive must seek to the spare
area to read the sector, and then seek back again if more sectors are to be
read.@{par}

The sectors in the SDL are probably not really defective, it's just that the
drive cannot read them properly due to dirt or dust on the disk surface. For
this reason, it is a good idea if you have a disk that has accumulated a large
number of "bad" sectors, to clean the disk surface and then low-level format
the disk. Of course you must backup all data on the disk before doing this!@{par}

To clean the disk surface, use an MO disk cleaning kit. These are very cheap; I
have seen them sold for about 2 pounds. Low-level formatting after the disk
surface is cleaned will clear the PDL and SDL, and completely erase and test
the disk surface.@{par}

To put the situation into perspective, I have had my MO drive for about a year.
Only one disk has developed a single bad sector since then, so unless you are in
a very dusty environment you probably will not have to concern yourself with
low-level formatting.@{par}

I have a new Sony 230MB MO disk that from the factory had 5 sectors recorded
in the PDL. I initially did a high-level AmigaDOS Format (not quick) on the
disk. Afterwards I used @{"ProbeSCSI" link Finding} too see whether any other
blocks had been mapped out by the drive, recorded in the SDL. Surprisingly,
there were several sectors which the drive found to be bad, even though the
disk was brand new. So I low-level formatted the disk, in order to have the
extra bad sectors recorded in the PDL. In view of this, I recommend that you do
a high-level format of new MO disks, and see whether any additional sectors
have been mapped out by the drive afterwards. If so, it is a good idea to
low-level format the disk.@{par}

@{line}@{b}Groups@{ub}@{par}

The spare blocks are distributed over the disk depending how many "groups" are
used. The number of groups is fixed except for 230MB disks:@{code}
@{jcenter}
@{b}Type of          Number of
@{u} disk             groups  @{uu}@{ub}
 128MB               1    
 230MB            1 or 10 
 540MB              18    
 640MB              11    @{par}@{jleft}@{body}

For 230MB disks, when low-level formatting you can specify how many groups to
use, one or ten. Which you choose has a very subtle effect, and for most
applications it will not matter (just as well, because there is currently no
Amiga program to set the number of groups).@{par}

The number of groups determines how the spare sectors are arranged on the disk.
With a single group, all the spare sectors are located after the user sectors.
With ten groups, there are ten groups of spare sectors spread over the disk.@{par}

To illustrate this, suppose a (hypothetical) disk has 100,000 user sectors and
1,000 spare sectors. The diagram below illustrates how the spare sectors are
arranged.@{code}

For a disk formatted to have one group, if a sector is replaced, the drive head
must seek to near the end of the disk to access the replacement sector. On
average, this will mean that the head seeks half-way across the disk to access
the replacement sector.@{par}

For a disk formatted to have ten groups, if a sector is replaced, the
replacement sector is taken from the spare area @{i}for that group@{ui}. On
average, this will mean that the head seeks half-way across the @{i}group@{ui},
i.e. 1/20 of the way across the disk, to access the replacement sector.@{par}

You can see that accessing replacement sectors is quicker for disks which have
10 groups than for disks with a single group. Why would anyone want to
low-level format disks to have a single group then? It depends what the disk
will be used for.@{par}

Imagine you want to store digitised video footage on a disk. If the playback
rate of the footage is close to the maximum transfer rate of the drive, any
interruption, no matter how small, to the data flow may cause problems. When
playing back from a disk with ten groups, when the head reaches the end of one
group it must skip over the spare area to get to the next sector, which is at
the beginning of the next group. This will cause a (very brief) interruption to
the flow of data to the computer.@{par}

For most Amiga users ten groups will be preferable, but there is little to
choose either way.@{par}

@{line}@{b}Programs for Low-Level Formatting@{ub}@{par}

Not all Amiga SCSI software is capable of low-level formatting. Commodore's
HDToolBox fails to low-level format MO disks for me. (The cause of this may be
in incompatibility between HDToolBox and my GVP SCSI controller.) One program
which can, at least some of the time, successfully low-level format MO disks is
GVP's ExpertPrep, which can be downloaded from:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.gvp-m.com/expert.lzh@{fg text}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

ExpertPrep does not allow the number of groups to be specified; to do this you
would need to use an MO-specific low-level formatting program, which does not
exist yet on the Amiga.@{par}

Recently Thomas Richter released his @{"SCSIFormat" link Finding} program on
Aminet. I have successfully used SCSIFormat to low-level format disks in my
Sony SMO-S501-11 5¼" drive, but could not get it to work with my 3½" drive.@{par}

Another option is to use Macintosh MO/SCSI driver software under a Mac emulator
like @{"ShapeShifter" link Finding} to perform a low-level format.@{par}

If something interrupts the low-level format process such as a power cut, or
the Amiga crashes or resets, you must start the low-level format again. The
disk will only be usable after the low-level format is complete.@{par}

@node About_Write_Cache "About the Write-Back Cache"

@{line}@{u}About the Write-Back Cache@{uu}@{par}

MO drives have a write-back cache, which when enabled speeds up write times,
because the drive does not wait for the data transferred to its buffer memory
to be written to disk.@{par}

It works like this:
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· The Amiga sends a first piece of data to the
drive.@{par}
· This data is stored in the drive's buffer memory, and the drive immediately
responds.@{par}
· Drive begins to write the first data to the optical disk. While it is writing
the data, a second piece of data can be sent from the Amiga to the drive's
buffer memory.@{pard}@{par}

But what if a write error occurs when the drive writes the first data to disk?
So far the Amiga thinks that the first data has been written correctly. The
drive will report the write error after the Amiga has sent the @{i}second@{ui} piece
of data to the drive. Depending on the SCSI device in use (scsi.device,
gvpscsi.device, etc.), the Amiga may incorrectly interpret the write error as
referring to the second piece of data.@{par}

So the Amiga will display a Retry/Cancel requester. If you click Retry, the
computer may retry sending the @{i}second@{ui} piece of data. So the first
data, which should be resent because of the write error, is not. Hence bad data
remains on the disk. The first piece of data may not even still be in memory;
the program that wrote it could have since freed or altered the memory.@{par}

For this reason, I do not believe that it is possible to (easily) completely
support the write cache under AmigaOS, though partial support should be
possible. However, in practice the write cache can usually be enabled without
problems. The drive should transparently remap any bad sectors it encounters
when writing, so the Amiga would only be told of this in extreme circumstances.
If ever a write error requester appears, just click on Cancel, delete the file
affected, and re-copy it. Do not assume that clicking Retry will work properly,
because the Amiga may resend a different piece of data for which no write error
occurred.@{par}

In fact, spurious write errors may indicate that there is a problem with your
SCSI chain. This is often due to improper termination. Using an external active
terminator may help.@{par}

@node Cross-Platform "Cross-Platform Access"

@{line}@{u}Cross-Platform Access@{uu}@{par}

This section covers accessing PC and Macintosh-formatted MO disks on the Amiga,
and also using an MO drive and disks with Macintosh and PC emulators on the
Amiga.@{par}

@{line}@{b}Macintosh@{ub}@{par}

It is very easy to use an MO drive and disks with emulators. I will mainly
write about the @{"ShapeShifter" link Finding} Macintosh emulator here. More
information on the Fusion and A-Max Mac emulators can be added if I am sent a
(legal!) copy of these programs to test, or someone else contributes
information.@{par}

There are two ways to use MO disks under Mac emulation:@{line}
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· You can use an MO disk as a "DeviceDisk". This is
probably the quickest method. There are two disadvantages. Firstly, MO disks
used like this will not be readable on a real Macintosh. Even if you buy a
Mac-formatted MO disk, you will need to reformat it in order to use as a
DeviceDisk. Secondly, A-Max 2.50, Fusion and ShapeShifter do not support disks
with a sector size other than 512 bytes. This means that 640MB 3½" disks cannot
be used as DeviceDisks, since they have 2048-byte sectors.@{line}@{par}
· You can use Macintosh MO driver software. It is a good idea to buy an MO
drive that comes bundled with Mac driver software. However, if your drive did
not come with any you can download several
@{"free Mac SCSI driver packages" link Free_Mac_SCSI}. I recommend the Pinnacle
Micro software.@{par}

My Philips Galaxy MO 640 drive came with Mac software called FormatterOne Pro,
which can also be used to access many other types of SCSI device. FormatterOne
Pro is a commercial product; see the Software Architects web site at:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.softarch.com/@{fg text}

@{jleft}@{body}In fact, the free Pinnacle Micro software seems to have more
features than FormatterOne Pro. It allows disks to be
@{"low-level formatted" link Low-Level}, something which some Amiga SCSI tools
can not do. However, the Pinnacle software is apparently incompatible with
System 8. I also had some problems running it under System 7.0.1, though these
may be partly due to my old SCSI controller or bugs in ShapeShifter. The
Pinnacle Formatter seems to require that the MO drive be
@{"set to type 0" link Device_Type} in order to recognise it.@{line}

If you use this or other Mac driver software, you can buy Mac-formatted MO
disks and use them immediately under the Mac emulation. There are other
commercial Mac drivers, though I have not used them. CharisMac sell "Anubis
Pro", which you can buy as a competitive upgrade for US$14.95. Presumably you
could download the free Pinnacle Micro software and then upgrade to Anubis Pro.
For more information, see CharisMac's web page at:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.charismac.com/anubis.html@{fg text}

@{jleft}@{body}Some other Mac commercial driver products are Silverlining, Disk
Drive TuneUp, FWB Hard Disk Toolkit and MicroNet DiskWorks.@{par}

Note that to boot from an MO disk under ShapeShifter, the
@{"device type" link Device_Type} needs to be set to "direct access" (type 0).
You can get around this by
@{"patching ShapeShifter" link ShapeShifter_Patch} to not check the device
type.@{par}

A-Max 2.50 seems to be incompatible with all Mac SCSI driver software that I
tried, but it is possible to use 512-byte-sectors MO disks as DeviceDisks with
A-Max.@{pard}@{par}

Accessing Macintosh disks from the Amiga for both reading and writing may
require the commercial products CrossMac or MaxDOS. However, read-only access
is possible by using filesystems such as @{"AmiCDFileSystem" link Finding} or
@{"AmiCDFS" link Finding} which support Mac HFS CD-ROMs and floppies. If you
have created multiple partitions on a Mac-formatted MO disk, you will need to
make a mount file corresponding to each partition that you want to access.@{par}

There is a @{"mount file" link DOSDrivers-3½/Mac/MAC640A/Main} using AmiCDFS
that works for my 640MB Mac-formatted MO disk. I used the Pinnacle Micro Mac
driver software to format it as a real Mac volume, not a DeviceDisk. I created
a single HFS partition on it, which occupies sectors 96 to 310349 inclusive;
sectors 310350 & 310351 do not seem to be used. So the LowCyl and HighCyl
values for the mountlist are 96 and 310349 respectively (using BlocksPerTrack =
1). If I were to use different Mac MO driver software, the LowCyl and HighCyl
values would need to be altered appropriately.@{par}

When creating mount files for your Mac volumes, you need some way of finding
which range of sectors the volume uses. If you are using a (512-byte sectors)
MO disk as a DeviceDisk with an emulator, this should be no problem; LowCyl = 0
and HighCyl = (number of sectors in disk - 1) should work. Using a real
Mac-formatted disk, you need to use a Mac utility program which tells you which
sectors are used by each partition to get this information.@{par}

@{line}@{b}PC@{ub}@{par}

PC driver software is available from many manufacturers' web sites. The
Fujitsu, Maxoptix, Philips and Pinnacle Micro sites are good places to start;
see the @{"Where to Get More Information" link Where_To_Get} section for their
URLs. The Philips and Fujitsu Europe sites have drivers for MS-DOS, Windows
3.1, Windows 95 & 98, Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0, and OS/2.@{par}

It is possible to mount PC-formatted (AT-HD type) MO disks as Amiga devices,
just like PC0: is used to access PC-formatted floppy disks. This requires
CrossDOS (supplied with Workbench 2.1 and higher) or similar. It is probably
not possible to format this type of disk without special software, so format
disks on a PC first. Accessing PC disks which have been formatted to contain
several partitions is easy using CrossDOS. CrossDOS can be configured to
automatically recognise and mount partitions on a disk; it determines where on
the disk the partitions are by reading the partition table. See the MOC
DOSDriver in the @{"Mount Files" link Mount_Files} section. Alternatively you
could create a mount file for each partition. This has the disadvantage of
being tied to a specific partition layout. It may be possible to use
@{"MountDOS" link Finding} to help with this.@{par}

On a PC it is also possible to intialise MO disks in "superfloppy" format.
This is similar to using a mount file as opposed to RDB for Amiga-formatted
disks. Accessing such disks on the Amiga just requires a suitable
@{"mount file" link Mount_Files}. (Superfloppy format does not apply to 4.8Gb
and 5.2GB 5¼" disks, because the FAT filesystem has a maximum partition size
of 2GB.)@{par}

See the @{"Mount Files" link Mount_Files} section if you want to experiment
with reading PC or Macintosh-formatted MO disks.@{par}

You should also investigate @{"XFS" link Finding} which is a kind of "universal
filesystem" that can access PC and Mac volumes. It supports Windows 95 long
filenames, which is otherwise only possible with CrossDOS 7.0. The author of
XFS has created a web page about it, which can be found at:@{code}

Ever since version 3.4, the ShapeShifter Macintosh emulator can only boot from
direct access (type 0) SCSI devices. It checks the
@{"device type" link Device_Type}, and if non-zero refuses to boot from that
device. So you cannot boot from a Mac-formatted optical disk if your optical
drive is set to "optical memory device" mode (type 7).@{par}

Here is an extract from the ShapeShifter version history:@{code}

@{jcenter}V3.4    04.Mar.96                                                     
  - ShapeShifter won't try to boot from SCSI devices other than direct
    access devices                                                    @{par}@{jleft}@{body}

Similarly to the @{"HDToolBox patch" link HDToolBox_Patch}, I have figured out
a patch for version 3.10 of ShapeShifter to disable the device type checking,
so it can boot from any type of device.@{par}

Use a binary file editor such as @{"Hex" link Finding} to make the change to
your ShapeShifter 3.10 executable. All numbers are in hexadecimal.@{par}

This is probably specific to MO drives. Version 3.2 only works on Pinnacle

formatter works for low- and high-level formats. You can set blind read/writes

incompatibilities there are. Compared to generic software like FormatterOne

@node For_Programmers "For Programmers"

@{line}@{u}For Programmers@{uu}@{par}

It is possible to support advanced features of MO drives on the Amiga by using
custom driver software. No-one has written any such software yet (apart from
perhaps the MO-MIGA software), but here are some things which could be done:@{line}
@{lindent 4}@{pari -2}@{par}· Support automatic media capacity detection. So
regardless of whether a 128MB, 230MB, 540MB, 640MB or 1.3GB disk is inserted,
the drive could be accessed as MO0:. This would be similar to the way that both
high and low density floppy disks are supported as DFx:. The sector size can
also change; it is 512 bytes for 128MB, 230MB and 540MB 3½" disks, but 2048
bytes for 640MB and 1.3GB 3½" disks. @{"CrossDOS" link Cross-Platform} and
@{"XFS" link Finding} have this capability for AT-HD type MO disks.@{line}@{par}
· Allow disks to be @{"low-level formatted" link Low-Level}. Low-level
formatting is possible using ExpertPrep, available from the GVP-M web site.
However this does not provide full support for all features.@{line}@{par}
· Partial support for the write cache may be possible, especially in
conjunction with disk cache software running on the Amiga.@{line}@{par}
· Extended error detection. Detect when the MO drive has to use its error
correction circuitry or retry reading a track. This does not result in data
loss, but many such occurrences may indicate that the disk or drive needs
cleaning. A requester could optionally alert the user to this. The drive
maintains a log of recoverable errors, and this is readable by the Amiga. @{line}@{par}
· Allow various options to be changed in software, rather than having to change
a DIP switch on the drive, such as spindle automatic stop mode, write cache
mode and verify mode.@{line}@{par}
· Allow other options to be set for which there are no DIP switches, such as
spindle stop monitoring time and power save mode.@{line}@{par}
· Filesystems could have an option to "pre-erase" unused areas of an MO disk,
to allow writing new data to normal media to be as fast as for
@{"LIMDOW media" link LIMDOW}.@{line}@{par}
· Filesystems can enable or disable verification of writes on a per-partition
(actually per-write) basis. This speeds up writes, and may be a good idea for
partitions that contain temporary, unimportant data, such as a web browser's
cache.@{line}@{par}
· A filesystem could be written to support NSR format disks, or UDF which is a
subset of NSR. See the @{"About NSR and UDF" link About_NSR_and_UDF} section.@{line}@{par}
· Some MO drives have their firmware in Flash ROM. This means that it is
possible to update the firmware from the host computer. Software to do this
exists for the PC; it would be useful to have an Amiga firmware downloader
program also. An archive containing PC firmware downloader program and BIOS for

I envisage an "mo.device" being written, that goes in between the filesystem
and the underlying SCSI device (scsi.device, gvpscsi.device, etc.). Multiple
units of mo.device could access multiple MO drives on multiple SCSI
controllers, if present. Something like this may already have been written by
Fourth Level Developments. I would like to find information on their "MO-MIGA"
software package.@{par}

If you are interested in the physical specifications of MO disks, there are
some relevant ECMA standards. See the
@{"About NSR and UDF" link About_NSR_and_UDF} section for the URL of the ECMA
web site.@{par}

@endnode


@node About_NSR_and_UDF "About NSR and UDF"

@{line}@{u}About NSR and UDF@{uu}@{par}

NSR and UDF specify platform-independent file systems. UDF is a subset of NSR.
NSR stands for @{i}Non-Sequential Recording@{ui}, and UDF for @{i}Universal
Disk Format@{ui}.@{par}

They allow disks created on a wide variety of operating systems to be
interchangeable between different OSes. Think of NSR and UDF as similar to the
way the ISO 9660 standard allows any type of computer with a CD-ROM drive to
read the files from a CD-ROM disc. With NSR or UDF support, it would be
possible to read and write to NSR-formatted MO disks from a Macintosh, PC,
Amiga, and other types of computer.@{par}

NSR is covered by ISO standard 13346 and an equivalent ECMA standard, ECMA-167
2nd edition. NSR is the international standard logical disk format. It is not
restricted to optical disks.@{par}

ISO standards documents are not available free of charge. Information about
ordering them can be found on the ISO web site at:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.iso.ch/@{fg text}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) standards documents are
available free of charge. They can be downloaded in PDF and Microsoft Word
formats from the ECMA web site, where you can also order a free CD-ROM
containing all ECMA standards. The URL is:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.ecma.ch/@{fg text}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

UDF is a subset of NSR which is defined by the Optical Storage Technology
Association (OSTA). You may have heard it mentioned in confunction with CD-RW
and DVD technologies. It is likely to be more commonly used as the standard
interchange format for MO disks. UDF specifications are available in PDF format
from the OSTA web site, at:@{code}
@{jcenter}@{fg shine}http://www.osta.org/@{fg text}@{par}@{jleft}@{body}

If the Amiga is ever to support new technologies like CD-RW and DVD properly,
an NSR or UDF filesystem needs to be written. The issue of NSR/UDF support is
not only applicable to MO disks.@{par}
