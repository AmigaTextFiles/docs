                                   WELCOME

Welcome to OctaMED Soundstudio! The MED in OctaMED stands for Music EDitor,
and that's exactly what OctaMED is: a versatile music composer and editor.
Although quite sophisticated, OctaMED is also easy and interesting to learn.
You can compose music for games, demos, animations, presentations, or simply
use the program as a stand-alone editor.

In the early days of the Amiga, programmers needed a fast, convenient way to
write music for games and demos. A music program called Sound Tracker was
written in response to this need. It provided a perfect way to incorporate
sound tracks into programs, and as a result, most Amiga games and virtually
all demo programs had their music written with Sound Tracker (or one of its
many imitation programs, known as "trackers").

Unfortunately, like many programmer's utilities, trackers required great
patience. Although composing music was not especially difficult, they often
crashed, seldom caoften
crashed, seldom came with instructions, and refused to multi-task (one of
the Amiga's major attributes). In spite of these problems, trackers became
increasingly popular, a testament to their usefulness.

Recognizing the value of Sound Tracker, Teijo Kinnunen began designing an
improved program. The first version, MED 1.12, appeared in Autumn 1989.
Teijo improved this version with new program code and, in April of 1990, he
release MED 2.00. Perhaps the most important new feature was MIDI support.
MED n excellent piece of music software; virtually
every Amiga publication of both sides of the Atlantic has praised MED.

In 1991, after being persuaded by Ray of RBF Software, Teijo released
OctaMED, a great improvement on MED with its main new feature being the
ability to play eight sounds at the same time, breaking out of the Amiga's
four-sound limitation. With the release of OctaMED Professional V5, the user
interface was completely redesigned to give the program a much more
"friendly" appearance. The program thus moved into the 90's by becoming
Kickstart 2 only, leaving many users with no choice but to upgrade.

OctaMED V6 further modernized the program and introduced ARexx support. Now
the ultimate tracker has arrived: OctaMED Soundstudio. It Includes a
completely redesigned and powerful notation editor, an amazing new playing
mode (Mix), plus enhancements in nearly every other part of the program, we
are confident that you'll enjoy the premier Amiga music package!

                           FOR UPGRADERS FROM V6

Welcome to this major new release of OctaMED for the Amiga: the Soundstudio!

We're sure you'll find that the number and size of the new features in this
version warrant the new name. The new playing mode - Mix - is unique in its
versatility, and extends the number of possible channels to 64. The
notation editor has been completely overhauled and is better than ever. Many
other new features have been added and others enhanced to take Amiga music
sequencing to new heights.

The remainder of this manual will guide you through all these new functions
and describe changes to older functions. Also, the on-line help guide has
been completely rewritten for the Soundstudio; why not press Help and try
it out? Comments are very welcome! A brief list of new Soundstudio features is
available through the new guide: Click on the long box at the top of the
contents page for more details.

INSTALLATION CHANGES

All configuration files starting with OctaMEDPro should be renamed to start
with Soundstudio. In other words, OctaMEDPro.config, OctaMEDPro.defkeyboard
and OctaMEDPro.defprogkeys should be renamed Soundstudio.config,
Soundstudio.defkeyboard and Soundstudio.defprogkeys.

This change can be made through OctaMED, when you run the Soundstudio for the
first time:

  Load your old files, all starting with OctaMEDPro, one by one in the usual
  way. That is, use the Settings menu for .config, the Keyboard Shortcuts
  window for .defkeyboard and the Programmable Keys window for .defkeys.

  Save the files under their new names. To do this, select Save Settings
  from the Settings menu, Save in the Keyboard Shortcuts window (remembering
  to rename the file to Soundstudio.defkeyboard), and Save Keys in the
  Programmable Keys window (again, rename the file).

  Select Delete Files from the Project menu and delete the old .config files.

@node "Mix"

                                MIX MODE



The Soundstudio's biggest addition is a new channel mode: Mix. Based on the
mixing technique used in 5 to 8 channel mode, it can play 64
notes at once using the normal Amiga sound capabilities! You can also bring
your song to life with effects such as echo, and use it to record part of
your song direct to disk as a sample.

But before you get too excited, remember that the Amiga physically only has
four sound channels, so Mix mode uses special tricks to cram all those
notes in. In the process, the notes lose sound quality. In fact, the faster
your processor, the better quality the notes can be. For acceptable
quality, you really need at least the 68020 processor found in the A1200.

Three different 16-bit sound boards are fully supported. These boards don't
suffer from the reduced quality of Amiga mixing, but a reasonably fast
processor is still highly recommended.

Mix mode enhancements and limitations

Here are some of the benefits over 4-channel mode that Mix mode provides,
as well as some of its limitations.

                                Enhancements

                       Can play up to 64 notes at once.

 Effects: Echo, Cross Echo, Stereo Separation.

 Track Panning: Can alter the stereo location of each track.

 Many additional player commands.

 Sample length limited only by available memory (previous limit was
  131072 bytes).

 Full support for three 16-bit sound boards.

 Direct-to-disk recording.

 Three new octaves: 2 low, 1 high. So the note range is now C-1 to B-6.
  The old 4-channel notes C-1 to B-3 are now notes C-3 to B-5.

 More precise sample loop setting. Previously, only even values of Loop
 Start and Length (Instrument Properties) were possible. Now, all values
 are allowed, with both Chip and Fast memory samples.

                          @{" Limitations " link "Lim" 0}


@endnode

@node "Lim"

                             Limitations

 A probable loss of sound quality. The faster your processor, the better
  the quality. In fact, very fast processors may increase sound quality.

 Hisoft's 16-bit sound board Aura can not be supported.

 Multi-octave samples cannot be used. (They are seldom used as it is.)

 The oscilloscope equalizer doesn't function.

So although Mix mode is based on 5 to 8 channel mode, it has hardly any of
its limitations. In particular, "paired" or "split" channels don't exist!
The Amiga's volume is fixed, and the volume of each note is scaled by the
mixing process. So each track has an independent volume.

                          @{" Using Mix Mode " link "Using" 0}


@endnode

@node "Using"

                              Using Mix mode

To use Mix mode, follow these two main steps:

1) Select Set Options from the Song menu. In the Song Options window, click
   on 1-64 Ch Mixing.

2) Select Mixing Settings from the Settings menu, and set up Mix mode to
   your liking.

The rest of this section describes the Mixing Settings window. Open it
through the Settings menu.

Mixing mode section

The radio button at the top left selects the "output device", the device
through which notes will be played. In Mix mode, the Output Device setting
of individual samples (in Instrument Type) is ignored. All samples are
played through one chosen device.

  Amiga 8-bit/14-bit: Plays notes through the Amiga. 14-bit is much better
  quality than 8-bit, and doesn't put much more strain on the processor,
  but it plays at roughly half the volume.

  For those that are interested, in 8-bit mode, the 8 bits of the left
  stereo channel are played on both of the left channels (similarly for the
  right stereo channel). In 14-bit mode, the 14 bits of the left stereo
  channel are split between the two left channels; one channel is used for
  the upper 8 bits, while the other very quiet 6 bits are played through the
  other channel. Because these bits are so quiet, the volume is roughly
  halved.

  Toccata 16-bit, MaestroPro 16-bit, Delfina 16-bit: Play all notes through
  the respective 16-bit sound board. See part 10.4 for more details.

  Disk 8-bit/16-bit: Selects "direct-to-disk recording". Instead of playing
  through your Amiga or a sound board, OctaMED stores the output on disk as
  a sample. See part 10.5 for more details.

The sound output will be in mono (the same on both speakers), unless you
switch the Stereo check box on. Mono is faster than stereo, in the sense that
there is less strain on your Amiga's processor.

Smoothing mode significantly enhances sound quality, but it's very slow.
Because of its speed, it's only recommended for Disk 8-bit/16-bit modes,
although you're welcome to try it with other modes. If you're lucky enough
to own a blisteringly-fast 68060 processor, switch Smoothing on for truly
remarkable results!

                          @{" Mixing Frequency " link "Mixing" 0}


@endnode

@node "Mixing"

                             Mixing Frequency

The mixing frequency is a very important value. It specifies, in Hertz
(sample values per second), how quickly the samples should be mixed. The
higher the frequency, the better the sound quality, but also the more work
the processor has to do.

So - you've guessed it - the highest mixing frequency that you can use
depends on your processor. If you try using a frequency that is too high
for your computer, the computer will "hang"; the mouse pointer will move
very slowly, or even not at all. If this happens, do a "panic stop" by
holding down both mouse buttons for several seconds.

With the Amiga 8-bit or 14-bit output device, the highest possible frequency
also depends on the screen mode! If the screen is DblPAL, DblNTSC or
Productivity, the Mixing Frequency
slider's maximum value is about 56000, 55000 and 59000, respectively. In
other screen modes, the slider's maximum value is 28375. As a side note,
compact disc players use a frequency of 44100 (although the sound is 16-bit).

If the output device can't play at your requested frequency, OctaMED chooses
the frequency closest to your request. Your request is shown in the
Requested numeric box, the actual frequency used in the Actual box. The
reason for this discrepancy is that all of the output devices, excluding
Disk 8-bit/16-bit, can only play at certain frequencies. (This even includes
your Amiga...)

A couple of technical notes:

  The frequency of each note is different in 4-channel mode from Mix mode.
  This is because in 4-channel mode, the frequencies are approximated to
  what the Amiga DMA can play. Mix mode doesn't use the Amiga DMA, so its
  frequencies are correct.

  The frequencies are very slightly off on Amigas not having a Floating Point
  Unit. This is because the integer version of the frequency calculation has
  some error. The difference is not audible.

  Max. Channels: The maximum number of channels. If you want to play notes on
  tracks 0 to 5, for instance, set this slider to 6. Notes become quieter as
  you increase Max. Channels, to "make room" for the new channels. This slider
  doesn't increase processor load by itself: The load depends on the number of
  notes actually playing.

  Volume Adjust: Allows you to adjust the overall volume of notes. The
  value is a percentage; when 100 %, the notes are at "normal" volume. Set
  the notes to half volume by sliding to 50%, double volume to 200%.

  In practice, increasing the volume above 100% generally causes unwanted
  "distortion" (noise), unless the samples in your song are quiet. Also,
  using effects can cause distortion, even at 100%. If this is the case,
  turn the volume down until the distortion is removed. (You can't hear the
  volume adjustment until you release the slider button.)

  The slider value is in a numeric box, to allow you to enter an exact value
  quickly, as the slider's range is quite large. Volume increases of 400% or
  even higher may seem unnecessary, but if you ever use over 8 tracks in
  your song, such increases may be required.

  Mix Buffer Size: The size of the "mix buffer", an area of memory used by
  OctaMED to mix samples together. This isn't changed very often. You may need
  to change it when using:

  a) Disk 8-bit/16-bit mode. Increasing Mix Buffer Size to, say, 30000
     greatly quickens direct-to-disk recording.

  b) MIDI. MIDI notes are played immediately, while mixed notes are played
     after a slight delay. So it's recommended to set Mix Buffer Size
     to the lowest allowed value, 32. If sound quality suffers as a
     result, compensate by raising the mixing frequency (if your computer
     allows it).

  c) 16-bit sound boards. See part 10.4 for details on appropriate mix buffer
     sizes for each board.

  Panning and Effects: These open the Mix - Track Panning and Mix - Effects
  windows. They allow you to adjust the stereo location of each track, and
  add effects such as echo to your music. These windows are covered in parts
  10.6 and 10.7.

Using 16-bit sound boards with Mix mode

The Amiga's 8-bit internal sound capabilities are beginning to show their
age. As a result, several 16-bit sound boards have recently entered the
market. Three of them are supported by Mix mode.

With 16-bit samples, only volume values 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 can be
used. This means that note volumes may sound a bit strange if you change
Volume Adjust or the track panning. Also, the volumes you can use with some
player commands, such as Set Volume (type 0C), are limited to the above
values.

The Amiga's audio channels are now allocated only when they are needed for
the first time. So when using Mix mode with 16-bit boards, they aren't
allocated at all! To control audio channel allocation, use Allocate Channels
in the Project menu.

16-bit samples can be used with Amiga 8-bit and 14-bit output devices as well
as the three supported boards, although some of the bits are removed.

Toccata

To play through Macrosystems' Toccata sound board, select output device Toccata
16-bit in the Mixing Settings window.

Unlike in 4-channel mode, several notes can be played simultaneously through
the board in Mix mode. The mixing frequency is restricted to the fourteen
frequencies which Toccata can play, ranging from 5513 to about 48000 Hz.

The size of the mixing buffer is rounded to the nearest 512. Toccata is
usable with MIDI, if you use a high mixing frequency in combination with as
low a buffer size as possible (512 or 1024).

The support is implemented with toccata.library, which accompanies every
Toccata board. Any version of toccata.library can be used, but library
version V6 or later generally produces better results, allowing higher
mixing frequencies and reducing playing interruptions by other
system tasks.

MaestroPro

To play through Macrosystems' MaestroPro sound board, select output device
Toccata 16-bit in the Mixing Settings window.

Three different output frequencies are available: 32000, 44100 and 48000.
You should provide a reference signal to MaestroPro's input, and also set
the mixing frequency in OctaMED. If no reference signal is provided, its
internal 48 kHz clock is used.

The size of the mixing buffer is rounded to the nearest 1024. Usually,
however, a very large mixing buffer (about 32000) is required, although it
appears that smaller buffers also work fairly well. The larger the buffer,
the less suitable is MIDI usage, so be careful with large buffers.

As Macrosystems do not provide a support library for MaestroPro, it is
implemented with maestix.library by Richard Körber. A copy of this freely
distributable library is provided with OctaMED.

Delfina

To play through the Delfina sound board, select output device Delfina 16-bit
in the Mixing Settings window.

This mode uses the digital-to-analog converter on the Delfina board for high-quality
16-bit output. It does not use the DSP features available on the board,
only the output part. As of the delfina.library V2, six frequencies are
supported.

Support is implemented using delfina.library. Parts of the support code and
testing were done by Teemu Suikki.

The mix buffer can be 32 - 4096 samples in size with Delfina.

                           Direct-to-disk recording

To record directly to disk, select output device Disk 8-bit or Disk 16-bit
in the Mixing Settings window.

Unlike other output devices, you cannot hear any sound during direct-to-disk
recording. This is because the sound is "recorded" (saved) directly to a file
on disk, as a sample.

If many seconds of music are recorded, the sample may be pretty long! Still,
direct-to-disk recording  has many uses. You can construct a drum
beat in a Tracker editor block over several tracks, then use this feature to "sample"
the drum beat. The resulting sample can then be used on a single track.

Alternatively, store an entire song on your hard drive as a sample, then use
the Play16 program to play it with very little processor consumption. Or use
the sample - a digital image of the song - to record a song directly to your
hard drive or a CD, without any unnecessary analog-to-digital and digital-
to-analog conversions.

To record directly to disk, follow these steps:

1) In the Mixing Settings window:

   a) Select Disk 8-bit or Disk 16-bit, to record an
      8-bit or 16-bit sample.

   b) Set the Mixing Frequency to any value you wish. The higher the
      frequency, the larger the produced sample but the higher the quality.

   c) The larger the mix buffer, the quicker the recording. So for a quick
      recording, set a large mix buffer (perhaps 30000). For a slower
      recording (useful if you have to click Stop Recording - see step 4),
      leave the buffer at 300.

   d) We recommend you switch Smoothing on, to increase sound quality.
      Recording slows, so compensate by increasing the mix buffer.

2) The next time you play a note or your song, a "Record as" file
   requester will appear. In this requester, select the filename of the
   produced sample.

3) Next, set the file type of your sample in the requester that appears.
   Mono samples can be saved under more types than stereo samples.

4) Finally, the Record window will open and OctaMED will start recording.
   The window displays information on the sample's file format (8/16-bit,
   IFF/RAW/MAUD/etc., Mono/Stereo, frequency). It also displays
   recording time in minutes and seconds, and file size. These two values
   change as the song is being played.

   Click the "Stop Recording" button to stop recording. Alternatively, stop
   recording exactly by inserting an 0FFE player command at the appropriate
   point in your song; this, of course, does not work when recording single
   notes played with the keyboard.

After recording, Output Device will change back to its setting before you
chose Disk 8-bit or 16-bit (in step 1 above).

@node "Convert"

                Converting between old channel modes and Mix mode

There is one fundamental change needed to songs composed in other channel
modes: All notes played by samples must be transposed up 2 octaves. This is
because there are two extra low octaves in Mix mode, which means that, for
example, note C-1 in an old channel mode is equivalent to C-3 in Mix mode.
(There is also one extra high octave, so that the highest note available is
B-6.)

OctaMED can automatically transpose samples for you, in two different ways.
Only notes played by samples need to be transposed, not synthsounds, MIDI
instruments or ExtSamples (which are now redundant).

Song Options: Changing channel mode

To change channel mode, you use the radio button in the Song Options window.
When changing to and from Mix mode, OctaMED can automatically transpose
notes played by samples up or down 2 octaves, as required. To do this, click
the new channel mode while holding down a Shift key.

So clicking 1-64 Ch Mixing while holding Shift transposes all notes played
by samples up 2 octaves. It also rotates the Oct gadget (Main Control) up 2
places, to ease entering notes. Clicking any other channel mode while
holding Shift does the exact opposite: Notes played by samples are
transposed down 2 octaves, and the Oct gadget is rotated down 2 places.

You can set Mix mode, or any other channel mode, to be the mode used when
OctaMED starts up (or when you clear the song). Use the new Default Channel
Mode cycle gadget in the Miscellaneous Options window.

Miscellaneous Options: Use Mixing

To allow old 4 to 8-channel and Tracker songs to use the new Mix mode,
the Miscellaneous Options window contains two new Use Mixing check
boxes. When on, the required 2-octave transposition to notes played by samples takes
place. There's a separate check box for songs saved by OctaMED in the usual
format (MMD), and for songs created by other Trackers.

When using old 5 to 8-channel songs with the new mode, do not try to set
Volume Adjust to 200% to allow for "halved" samples. Halved samples are in
7-bit quality, so it's best to reload the original samples.


Some other notes

1) Internally, OctaMED has three separate parts which control playing,
   called the "players". There's one player for 4-channel mode, another for
   5 to 8-channel modes, and another for Mix mode.

   When you play a note using the keyboard in 4 or 5 to 8-channel modes,
   the player is used briefly to start the note off, but then the note is
   left to play and finish of its own accord. The Mix mode player, however,
   is used throughout the note's playing, from its start to its finish.

   So the Mix mode player is "switched on" when the first note is started.
   But it isn't switched off when the note has finished. Instead, to react
   more quickly to other notes you play, it's kept switched on until you
   click STOP or press the space bar.

   This means that the player is switched on even when no notes are being
   played. On slower Amigas, this may slow down operation, so simply press
   the space bar to switch the player off. It also means that if you change
   anything in the Mixing Settings window, such as Mixing Frequency or
   track panning, you must stop playing and restart it for the changes to
   take effect. (This doesn't include Stereo Separation, Echo Depth, or
   a change from Echo to Cross Echo or vice-versa.)

2) Do remember about "panic stop"! If the computer seems to lock up during
   play, try holding both mouse buttons down for a few seconds.

3) Samples with very short loops increase processor load. Here, "very short"
   means about a third of Mix Buffer Size (i.e. by default, 100 bytes).

4) 5 - 8 channel mode uses a frequency of 15768 Hz in non-HQ (High Quality) mode,
   and 28867 Hz in HQ mode. In fact, you could perfectly reproduce 4-channel
   mode with a mixing frequency of 3.6 MHz! Though 48 kHz with Smoothing on
   is often better in practice.

5) Almost all settings in Mixing Settings, Mix - Track Panning, and
   Mix - Effect are saved with songs. In particular, Mixing Mode and Mixing
   Frequency aren't saved. This is so that, for example, a song created on
   a fast Amiga using a high frequency won't immediately cause a slow Amiga
   to lock up.

   OctaMED uses a special file format for songs using Mix mode: MMD3. This
   is identical to MMD2. The only reason for its existence is so that older
   versions/player programs will not attempt to play Mix mode songs.

6) You can play samples in either type of memory - Chip or Fast - in Mix
   mode. By default, though, samples are loaded into Fast memory; Load
   Samples To Fast Mem in the Instr menu is automatically switched on.
   Samples in Fast memory can be mixed much more quickly (but bear in mind
   that "fast" memory on an A500 is usually Slow RAM, the same speed as Chip
   memory).

   See part 12.4 for more details about samples in different memory types.

7) An option only applying to Mix mode, Swap Amiga Channels (Mix), can be
   found in the Miscellaneous Options window. Sound channels 0 and 3 should
   be played through your left speaker, 1 and 2 through your right. On some
   Amigas, these are internally swapped round! So switch this check box on to
   correct them.

8) Tempo settings in SPD mode are the same as in 4-channel mode.

                                Track Panning

The "panning" of a track is the stereo location of its notes. The notes can
be played on just the left speaker, just the right speaker, on both speakers
at the same volume (mono) or at different volumes on each speaker.

The panning of each track is adjusted using the Mix - Track Panning window.
Open it by clicking Panning, at the bottom of the Mixing Settings window.

Basic use

Track numbers are displayed to the left of each slider, the tracks' stereo
location to the right. To begin with, all tracks have a stereo location of
0 (center). This means that notes on all tracks are played with equal
volume on both speakers; in other words, they're played in mono.

To force a track's notes to be played entirely through the left speaker,
drag the track's slider all the way to the left (value -16). Likewise for
the right speaker: drag the slider to the far right (value 16).
Intermediate values play the notes at different volumes on each speaker.

Use the Up and Down buttons to adjust the tracks shown, if your song has
over 8 tracks.

Free Panning and Sum Of Balances

Because track panning is the volume of each track on each
speaker, you must be careful that the volume on either speaker doesn't
become too high, causing distortion. For example, setting all tracks to be
played on the left speaker (value -16) is bound to cause distortion on the
left speaker.

The Sum Of Balances display helps you prevent distortion. It displays all
the tracks' stereo locations added together. When the volume is perfectly
balanced between the two speakers, Sum Of Balances is 0, so adjust the
sliders until it becomes 0.

"Free Panning", when on, allows you to set the stereo locations to
whichever values you choose, without worrying about volume distortion or Sum
Of Balances. Not surprisingly, Free Panning is usually on. However, the
drawback is that the overall volume is halved.

Notes

1) Processor load varies, depending on the stereo location. A track with
   location -16 or 16 exerts least load on the processor. A track in the
   center (0) exerts slightly more load. A track in any other location
   exerts the highest load.

2) Stereo samples are handled correctly by Track Panning. For example, a
   stereo sample played on a centered track will play its left part entirely
   through the left speaker, and its right part through the right.

   A stereo sample causes more processor load than a mono sample (unless
   played in location -16 or 16).

3) Not all panning levels are saved with songs, only those that are needed
   by the song. In other words, the panning of any tracks completely unused by
   the song are not saved (for example, track 9 in a song consisting of 8-track
   blocks).

Panning player command

The new player command 2E allows track panning to be changed during play.
The track on which the player command appears is affected. The
command level is in signed hex: $F0 to $10 = -16 to 16 decimal.
See @{" Appendix F  " link "AppF" 0} for a reminder of signed hex.


Special effects

Special effects can be added to your music using the Mix - Effects window.
Open it using the Effects button at the bottom of the Mixing Settings
window.

Different effects

The effect you'll be dying to play with is echo! To switch echo on, set the
Echo cycle gadget to Echo or Cross Echo. The difference between the two is
that Cross Echo alternates echoes between the speakers; you must have Stereo
mode on to use it.

Echo Rate is the distance, in milliseconds, between each echo. It can take
any value in the range 1 to 32767.

Echo Depth sets the depth of echoing. The larger the value, the deeper the
echoes. Technically, it specifies the relative amplitudes of successive
echoes. For example, if it's 25%, the first echo's amplitude is 25% of
the original amplitude, the second echo is 25% x 25% = 6.25% of that.

Stereo Separation is interesting. Dragging the slider to the right
"separates" the sound on each speaker. Dragging to the left brings the
speakers' sound closer together. This feature is best understood by
experimentation. (Technically, the stereo image is separated by feeding
part of the left channel to the right in inversed phase, and vice versa.)

Effect player commands

Command type 2F changes echo depth and stereo separation during play:

  Use command levels E1 to E6 to set echo depth. E1 is 50.0%, E2 is 25.0%
  and so on down to E6 (1.44%).

  The signed command level DC to D4 sets stereo separation. The following
  command levels give the respective stereo separation:

    Command level     | DC | DD | DE | DF | D0 | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4
   -------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----
    Stereo separation | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4

Types 21 and 22 slide the pitch of a note up and down. They work exactly
like 01 and 02, except that each command level value produces the same slide
speed, regardless of the pitch of the note. For example, command level 06
will slide at the same speed if applied to note C-2 or note F-5, or any note
for that matter. This is not true with commands 01 and 02, where lower
pitches mean slower slide speeds if equivalent command levels are used.

Type 20, with command level 00, reverses the sample. With other levels it
changes the sample offset, just like command 19 except the command level is
the new offset relative to the current sample position being played. For this
reason, it should be used after a note.

For example, suppose that a sample started (from byte 0) on line 005. By the
time line 008 is reached, the sample might be at byte 10000. If a 2001
command appeared on line 008, the sample playing position would be moved to
10256, 256 bytes ahead of the current position. Command 1901, however, would
move the playing position to byte 256, regardless of the current position.

Type 20's command level is in signed hex: The largest value is $7F or 127,
the smallest is $80 or -128). A negative value moves the playing position
backwards.

Slides can be created with any of the new Mix mode player commands, using
Generic Slide. Signed hex is now respected

Introduction

Opened through the Display menu, the notation editor is an alternative
method of displaying your song. It uses standard musical notation - notes,
rests, time and key signatures and so on - rather than the more computer-
friendly notation used in the Tracker editor. The music can also be printed
out and played on a musical instrument.

The notation editor is strongly bound to the Tracker editor. After all, the
two editors are just two different ways of displaying the same song. So
when you add a note to the song in the notation editor, the note is also
added in the Tracker editor. Player commands, however, can only be entered
in the Tracker editor.

OctaMED is primarily a Tracker-based sequencer, and the notation editor
exists as a different way of displaying and entering notes, rather than a
comprehensive and professional musical notation system. That said, the
Soundstudio's notation editor is much more powerful than the basic editor
provided with versions up to OctaMED V5, and should be more than adequate
for most of your needs.


Improvements on the old notation editor

Veteran OctaMED users may remember that a notation editor was introduced to
OctaMED V2. Although it was certainly an editor, and it certainly displayed
traditional notation, it was admittedly rather difficult to use. As one user
pointed out, one good use of it was to imitate a "stylophone", that simple
electronic instrument made famous by Rolf Harris, by dragging the mouse up
and down the staffs!

That user will be pleased to know that stylophones can still be imitated in
this notation editor. Other slightly more important new features are:

  The ability to add and remove staffs. Previously, the number of staffs was
  fixed at 2, but there can now be up to 16 staffs - enough for a
  decent-sized orchestra! Any staff can have a treble, bass or alto clef.

  Much greater control over how notes are displayed on the staffs.
  Particular Tracker editor tracks are assigned to particular staffs. If
  more than one track is displayed on a particular staff, there is an easy
  way to select the track to be edited. The three rows of tiny track buttons
  have finally disappeared! Also, the stems of all notes on each track can
  be set to go up or down, if required.

  Print quality is vastly improved. Four different resolutions are
  available, three of which use a Compugraphic font for far superior
  quality.

  The notation editor is more measure-based. You can add and remove single
  measures from a block. The number of measures in the block, using the time
  signature as a guide, is shown. As the mouse pointer is moved across a
  staff, OctaMED displays the current beat and "part-of-beat" (usually 16th
  note) number of each measure.

  Several display options. The number of measures shown at once can be
  adjusted (previously, just one measure was always shown). Staffs can be
  named, and these names can be temporarily removed from the left side of staffs.
  The width of the staffs can be altered. Blocks can be scrolled in
  numerical order or in the order in which they appear in the playing
  sequence. All of these options affect printing.

  A wider variety of available time signatures. Common signatures like 4/4,
  3/4, 2/2 and 6/8 are available, together with more obscure ones like 7/1!

Plus many more smaller features. The editor should now be much easier to
use.


Overview

By default, two staffs (treble and bass) are displayed, in the key of C
major and in 4/4 time. You can change this using the Staff Setup (part 11.7)
and Signatures (part 11.8) windows. Only one set of staffs is ever shown on
the screen at once, but you can set the number of measures shown using the
Notation Display Setup window (part 11.9). By default, only one measure is
shown at any one time.

Because the notation editor is closely bound to the Tracker editor, each
Tracker editor track is shown on a particular staff. By default, a 4-channel
setup is assumed, so tracks 0 and 3 are shown on the top staff (staff 1),
tracks 1 and 2 on the bottom staff (number 2). Change this using the Assign
Tracks window (part 11.6).

Of course, it's rare that all the notes in the song are shown on the staffs
at once. To move around the song, drag the left-hand vertical scroll bar.
Unlike the Tracker editor, this scroll bar moves around the entire song,
rather than just the current block; blocks are shown either in numerical
order or in playing sequence order. The required order is chosen through the
Notation Display Setup window.

The basic procedure for editing is:

  Switch Edit mode on (Main Control)

  Click on the required note or rest, in the Tools window (part 11.5). The
  Tools window is opened with the main notation editor window

  If more than one track is displayed on the staff where the note or rest
  will be entered, choose the required track using the slider at the bottom-
  right of the Tools window

  Place this note or rest on the staff, by clicking at the required point

A note is deleted by replacing it with an appropriate rest.

Print the song through the Print Notation window (part 11.10).

The notation editor, in common with several other major windows in OctaMED,
has a separate menu bar. All windows are opened through the Windows menu on
this bar, except Print Notation, which is opened through the Project menu.


The main notation editor window

On the notation editor's title bar, you'll see something like "Block 0/2 -
Lines 0 - 15 (last 63)". This means "the editor is currently showing lines
000 to 015 of block 0, the last block being number 2 and the last line in
the block, 063". One Tracker editor line is displayed in the notation editor
as a 16th note. So, for example, a quarter note is four Tracker editor lines
long.

If the staffs are partially hidden, use the horizontal and right-hand
scroll bars to show a different part of the staffs. Because only one set of
staffs are shown at once, use the left-hand scroll bar to show a different
part of the song on the staffs. The Tracker editor and notation editor are
"in sync", so that whatever is currently showing in the notation editor is
also showing in the Tracker editor, and vice-versa.

To enter notes, make sure Edit is on (Main Control window), and select a
note in the Tools window. Now click where you require the note to be on one
of the staffs. If you hold down the mouse button and drag over the staffs,
you can hear the note corresponding to its staff position: this note is
shown in the Tools window. And yes, it can sound like a stylophone!

The method of removing notes is to replace them with an appropriate rest.
For example, to delete a quarter note, select a quarter note rest from the
Tools window, then click on the offending note.

More is said about editing in the next section.


The Tools window

Use this window to select a note or rest to add to a staff. It's opened
automatically with the main notation editor, but you can close it using its
close gadget, then reopen it through the notation editor's Windows menu.

Note and rest boxes

Starting from the left, there are 8 note boxes and 8 rest boxes. Select one
of these notes or rests by clicking on the appropriate box. The length of
the selection, in Tracker editor lines, is shown in the "Length" box. The
notes available, together with their length, are:

       American name    |  British name   | Length (in lines)
   ---------------------+-----------------+-------------------
        Whole note      |    Semibreve    |        16
     Dotted half-note   |  Dotted minim   |        12
         Half-note      |      Minim      |         8
    Dotted quarter-note | Dotted crotchet |         6
       Quarter-note     |    Crotchet     |         4
      Dotted 8th-note   |  Dotted quaver  |         3
         8th-note       |     Quaver      |         2
         16th-note      |   Semiquaver    |         1

If the note or rest you require is not shown in any box, you can type its
length (in lines) directly into the Length box. As the above table shows,
one Tracker editor line is equivalent to a 16th note. So notes shorter than
a 16th note are not allowed.

Now move the mouse pointer over one of the staffs. The selected note or rest
appears. Next, hold down the left mouse button. The Tracker editor note
corresponding to the pointer's position is shown, in the display box below
Length. Release the mouse button to add that note.

Mouse position display box

To help you place notes accurately, OctaMED tells you exactly where you are
on the staff as you move the mouse. This information is given below the
Length box. The current Tracker editor line is shown after an L:, and the
current beat and "part-of-beat" numbers in this measure after a B:. The
number of beats in the measure is dictated by the time signature. In 3/4
time, for example, there are 3 beats per measure. Each beat in 3/4 time is
four 16th notes in length; these are the "part-of-beats."

For example, to add a note at the very start of a measure, ensure that
B: 1-1 is shown. This means that the mouse pointer is currently over the
first part-of-beat of the first beat of a measure (in other words, at the
start of a measure).

The smallest note value available is the 16th note. Sometimes, however, you
know that your song will never use notes as short as 16th notes. Perhaps the
song only ever uses 8th notes. You can set the part-of-beat value to an 8th
note; this has the effect of moving (or "quantizing") notes that you enter
to the nearest 8th note, instead of the usual 16th note. To do this, switch
Space on (Main Control), and set the Space Value to 2 (Keyboard Options).

This behaviour is quite sensible, because, like in the Tracker editor, you
can now only enter notes on lines whose number is a multiple of two (000,
002, 004 and so on). Because one Tracker editor line is a 16th note, this
has the effect of quantizing your song to the nearest 8th note. To quantize
your song to the nearest quarter note, set the Space Value to 4. Try out
other values too.

Accidentals

The key signature of the song dictates whether a particular note is sharp,
flat or natural. A note can be forced to become sharp, flat or natural,
irrespective of the key signature, by adding an appropriate sign just before the
note. Such a note is called an "accidental".

To enter an accidental note, enter the note as usual, then add a sharp, flat
or natural using the # and b buttons in the Tools window. After clicking the
# button, every time you click on a note, the note is made one halfstep
sharper. After clicking the b button, a note can be made flatter in the same way.

For example, to enter a G# in the key of C major (where G is usually
natural), enter a G as usual. Now click on the # button, and click on the G
that you have just entered. A sharp sign will be added to the note. In the
key of Db major, however, G is usually flat. So after clicking the # button,
clicking the Gb will add a natural sign to make the note G natural. Clicking
it again will add a sharp sign, because every time you click on a note, the
note is made one halfstep sharper. Similarly for the b button.

Track selection

Just the gadgets on the far right - a display box above a slider - are left.
They tell you which staff, and more importantly which Tracker editor track,
you are currently editing. This is particularly useful when more than one
track is shown on one particular staff.

For a demonstration, note that tracks 0 and 3 are automatically assigned to
staff 1. Click on staff 1 (the top staff). Unless the setting has been
changed, the display box should now show "S1 Trk 1/2: 0". This means that,
on staff number 1, you are currently editing the 1st track shown out of 2,
and this is track 0 in the Tracker editor.

So to edit the other track shown on this staff, number 3, drag the slider to the
right. The display should now be "S1 Trk 2/2: 3". Now, any notes you add
will be entered into track 3. This solves the problem of which track notes
should be entered into when adding notes to staffs showing more than one
track.


The Assign Tracks window

This window is all about Tracker editor tracks. You can tell OctaMED which
tracks should be displayed on which staff. You can also indicate the
direction of the stems of each track's notes: up, down, or automatic.

Each row in the window sets the staff and stem direction for one particular
track, the number of which is shown on the left.

OctaMED assumes a standard 4-channel setup. By default, tracks 0 and 3 (the
left stereo channel) are shown on staff 1, tracks 1 and 2 (the right
channel) on staff 2. If some of these tracks are empty in the Tracker
editor, there will be rests on appropriate staffs.

You can display as many tracks as you like on one particular staff, but
it's best to stick to a maximum of 2, otherwise it might look a bit messy.
If you find you've run out of staffs, add some more using the Staff Setup
window.

In the original notation editor, introduced in OctaMED V2, notes not
belonging to the track currently being edited were ghosted. This is not the
case in the new editor. If you miss the ghosting, try "hiding" the notes of
tracks not being edited, by setting their sliders in this window to 0.

Set the stem direction using the cycle gadgets on the far right. Up means
that all the notes played on that track will have their stems going up,
irrespective of their pitch. Similarly, Down forces all stems down. This
is good for choral music, for example, as you could have all the sopranos'
stems going up and the altos' going down.

With Auto set, each individual stem goes up or down depending on that
note's pitch. If the note is below the staff's middle line, the stem goes
up; otherwise, it goes down. This is particularly useful when only one
track is displayed on the staff.

The Up and Down gadgets shift the eight track numbers up or down. Use these
buttons if you have more than 8 tracks in your song.


The Staff Setup window

Use this window to add and remove staffs, and change their properties.

The top region contains buttons to add and remove staffs, and to select a
staff. "Current Staff:" shows the staff number currently selected, and the
total number of staffs. Use the arrow buttons beside this display to select
a staff. (The selection is used by other gadgets in this window).

The name of the selected staff appears in the Staff Name box. Normally the
staff is nameless; type a name into the box to name the staff. The name
will appear on the staff's left in the notation editor. (To prevent the
names appearing, switch off the Display Staff Names check box in the
Notation Display Setup window).

The next row of gadgets adds or removes a staff. Insert New Staff inserts a
new staff before the selected one. Append New Staff adds a staff after the
last one. Delete Staff removes the selected staff. The maximum number of
staffs is 16.

TIP: If you use a standard 640 x 256 screen, and you add more staffs, it
     can be annoying that only two staffs are displayed at any one time.
     So, try the following:

     1) Outside the notation editor, select Screen Mode from the Screen section
        of the Settings menu.

     2) Set the screen's height to, say, 350. Making sure AutoScroll is on,
        click Ok.

     3) Drag the pointer to the bottom of the screen. You've got some extra
        space now! So use the notation editor's sizing gadget to enlarge
        the window as required, and move the windows below the notation
        editor (perhaps the Tools and Information windows) to the bottom of
        the screen.

The bottom region contains the properties of the selected staff. Space
Above and Space Below contain the vertical space, in pixels, above and
below the selected staff. If you'd prefer the staffs to be closer together
or further apart, try changing these values. Also, if you find high notes
(using many "ledger lines") to be "cut off" in the notation editor, try
increasing the Space Above value. Similarly with low notes and Space Below.

Select the staff's clef - Treble, Bass or Alto - using the Clef cycle
gadget.

Middle C oct is the octave number of the note C corresponding to middle C on
the staff. For example, if note C-3 in the Tracker editor should be
displayed as middle C on the staff, set the slider to 3. So if you find that
notes are consistently displayed too high or too low on a staff, try
changing the staff's Middle C oct value.

When using the notation editor, it's often best to stick to one instrument,
played on one track, per staff. If the selected staff always uses the same
instrument, set the Def. Instr (default instrument) slider to the
instrument's number. Now when you click on that staff in the notation
editor with a view to adding a note, the default instrument is
automatically selected. This saves a bit of effort.


The Signatures window

Use this window to set the song's time and key signature, and to add and
remove measures.

Set the time signature using the two upper sliders, both initially set to
4 to represent 4/4 time. The top slider can have a value of 1 to 8, the
bottom slider 1, 2, 4 or 8. So strange signatures like 5/8 and 7/1, as well
as standard signatures like 3/4 and 2/2, are possible.

Set the key signature using the bottom slider. The slider value is the
number of sharps or flats; if the slider knob is right of center, the key
is sharp, otherwise it's flat. The selected major key, and its relative
minor, is shown below the slider.

A reminder of the number of sharps or flats used in different keys:

    Number of    |        Sharps         |         Flats
    sharps/flats | Major key | Minor key | Major key | Minor key
   --------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------
         0       |     C     |     A     |     C     |     A
         1       |     G     |     E     |     F     |     D
         2       |     D     |     B     |     Bb    |     G
         3       |     A     |     F#    |     Eb    |     C
         4       |     E     |     C#    |     Ab    |     F
         5       |     B     |     G#    |     Db    |     Bb
         6       |     F#    |     D#    |     Gb    |     Eb

So, for example, the major key containing 3 flats is Eb major.

Always remember that the notation editor and Tracker editor are two
different ways of editing and viewing  the same song . So when you add a
note to a staff, you are also adding a note to a Tracker editor block. The
number of measures available in the current block, together with any extra
("leftover") lines after the final measure, is displayed in the middle of
this window. These values are based on the number of lines in the block
and the current time signature.

Add Measure adds a measure to the end of the block. Rem Measure removes the
final measure in the block. Ideally, the number of leftover lines should be
0; these buttons ensure that it is 0. So to make up leftover lines into a
complete measure, click Add Measure. To remove the leftover lines, click Rem
Measure.

The Harmonic Minor Scale check box automatically sharpens the 7th note of
the minor scale. So if you're in the key of E minor, trying to enter a D
(the 7th note) in fact enters a D#. This gives a different sound to your
music - try it!


The Notation Display Setup window

This window contains settings relevant to the general display. All settings
also affect notation printouts.

Display Width is the width, in pixels, of each staff. It's set up for a 640
pixel-wide screen by default. If your screen is wider than that, try
increasing the value from 600. Alternatively, click Scale to set the width
to a sensible value based on your screen width.

Switch off Display Staff Names to remove the staff names from the notation
editor. (Staff names are set in the Staff Setup window.)

Measures/line is the number of measures (bars in Britain) shown on the
screen at any one time. 1 is the usual setting, but 2, 3 and 4 are also
good values.

Positioning Mode affects the order in which the song's blocks are shown. In
Block-Based mode, dragging the notation editor's left-hand scroll bar shows
the blocks in numerical order: block 0, 1, 2 up until the final block.

In Song linear mode, the order is taken from the playing sequence. For example,
if the playing sequence were 002 003 002 000 001, dragging the
scroll bar would show block 2, 3, 2 again, 0 then 1. So the blocks are
shown in the order in which they're played when you click Play Song. This
gadget affects printing, so to print the song in the order in which it's
played, select Song linear mode.


The Print Notation window

Here you print out the song in standard musical notation. You could use the
printout as sheet music for playing on a musical instrument.

Firstly, set where the printout is to start and end. The numbers in Start
and End are in "displayfuls" of measures, rather than actual measure
numbers. To change the number of measures per displayful, use the Measures
slider in Notation Display Setup (part 11.9). The Current buttons set the
current displayful as the start or end of the printout.

Next, choose the print quality using the Resolution cycle gadget. The first
option prints using the standard Amiga font, the other three use the
better-quality Compugraphic font. The higher the number, the better the
quality, but the slower the print speed and the more memory required.

It is important to consider the available memory, because 2x, 4x and 8x
resolution consume 4, 16 and 64 times more memory than 1x resolution.
The Preferences printer settings play an important role in
determining the actual print resolution, especially the Density value. Use
the Printer program in Workbench's Prefs directory to change your printer
settings.

Finally, click Print. In the requester which appears after a while, click
Stop to interrupt printing if necessary.

There is one difference between staffs displayed on the screen and printed
staffs. Notes that extend above or below a staff's Space Below/Above
settings are necessarily "clipped" on the screen. This clipping does not
occur when printing.


Saving notation information

If you compose a song using the notation editor, you can save relevant
notation information together with the song. This information can later be
loaded with the song.

To save notation information, make sure that Save Notation Data, in Save
Options, is switched on when the song is saved. The precise information
saved is:

  Key and time signatures

  Requested display width (when the song is reloaded, this width is only
  adopted if the current screen mode allows)

  Number of staffs

  Number of measures on-screen at once (Measure slider, Notation Display
  Setup)

  Harmonic Minor Scale state (Signatures window)

  All information in the Assign Tracks window

  For each staff: Space above/below, name, clef, middle C octave and default
  instrument (all in the Staff Setup window)

NEW INSTRUMENT FEATURES

The Instrument List window

Pick Select from the Instr menu. The Instrument List is a Block List for
instruments; it lists all instruments with their sizes, and allows you to
select one. So it is an at-a-glance list of all your instruments, and an
alternative to using the Instrument Properties window or
Shift-<left>/<right> to select instruments.

Sizes are shown on the right of a / sign. The size format is the same as in
the Main Control's instrument size box. A reminder:

  The size in bytes is shown (except for MIDI or synthetic instruments)

  -Synth- refers to a synthetic instrument

  M Cxx refers to a MIDI instrument, where xx is its MIDI channel number.
  If the instrument isn't truly MIDI - perhaps it is a sample with a MIDICh
  value set - a   is also displayed

  H is shown for hybrid instruments

  E is shown for ExtSamples (samples with two extra low octaves: All
  ordinary samples in Mix mode have these extra octaves, not just
  ExtSamples)

  W is shown for 16-bit instruments (W stands for Word or Wide - take your
  pick!)

  ' is shown for an instrument in Fast memory


Instrument Parameters window changes

For a start, it isn't called Instrument Parameters any more! We're sure
you'll agree, "properties" is a much nicer and more common word than the
grotesque "parameters". In fact, there have been a fair number of name
changes throughout the program; all should be self-explaining.

"Loop Ping-Pong" is only used in Mix mode. When on, OctaMED plays the
sample's loop (if it exists) in a different way: forwards and backwards
alternately.

In other words, the sample is played until the end of its looped part; the
looped part is played  backwards  from its end to its start; the looped part
is then played forwards from its start to its end; then backwards; then
forwards; and so on. Try it out!

The Loop gadgets finally have sensible names...


Sample Editor changes

Monitor and Digitize now open the Toccata Capture window, if Mixing
Settings' Output Device gadget is set to Toccata. The window already opens
if the current instrument's output device is set to Toccata, in the
Instrument Type window. However, individual instruments' output devices are
ignored in Mix mode.

Period values in the sample editor are now frequencies. Specifying a note by
its frequency is much more common than using its period, and the new method
is well suited to the new Mix mode.

The default Pitch note is still C-2, with a frequency of about 8200 Hz. (The
frequency differs slightly depending on the output device used, to allow for
the deficiencies of some output devices - including the Amiga audio system.)

If you configured OctaMED V6 to a different default Pitch value, the period
value will automatically be converted to a frequency. As a result of the
change to frequencies, the Settings menu item "Pitch In Hz" has been
removed: The pitch is now always in Hz. In the Change Pitch window, the
source and destination values are given in frequencies.

There's a new submenu in the Tools menu: Raw Sample Conversion. If you load
a Raw sample that sounds very distorted and noisy, try using this submenu to
correct it.

OctaMED's samples are stored in 'signed' format. Most samples originating on
PCs are 'unsigned', so use "Unsigned <-> Signed" to convert them. Use "Swap
Byte Order" on noisy 16-bit samples. Each value of a 16-bit sample takes 2
bytes of memory. "Swap Byte Order" swaps the order of each value's bytes.
This can solve distortion problems.



There are two types of memory: "Chip" memory and "Fast" memory. Fast memory
is much faster than Chip memory, so it's preferable to store things in
there. However, the Amiga usually needs all samples to be stored in Chip
memory.

In the Soundstudio, you can now store samples in either type of memory. So
if you have plenty of Fast memory to spare, switch on Load Samples To Fast
Mem in the Instr menu. Now, any samples you load will be stored in Fast
memory unless there is not enough Fast memory available, in which case Chip
memory will be used.

However, depending on the channel mode of your song, you may have to use the
new "FastMemPlay" feature to play samples from Fast memory. FastMemPlay must
be used if the song is in:

   1) 4-channel mode
   2) 5 to 8-channel mode, and contains non-paired tracks

To switch on FastMemPlay, open the FastMemPlay window through the Settings
menu, then click Active. A small Buffer Size value, such as 16 or 32, is
recommended to minimise distortion if your song contains synthetic sounds.
Increasing the buffer size slightly decreases the processor load, because
technically it reduces the number of interrupts. The value range is 16 to
400.

FastMemPlay plays samples from Chip as well as memory. Even if all your samples
are in Chip memory, you may want to switch FastMemPlay on, because you can
play samples of any length (the limit is usually 131072 bytes), and samples
can also have odd loop start/length values (as opposed to even values).

Load Samples To Fast Mem is automatically turned on when Mix mode is
selected, to take advantage of the increased speed (Mix mode needs all the
processor time it can get!). So to load samples into Chip memory in Mix
mode, switch this item off.

Samples should really be either all in Chip memory or all in Fast memory, not
shared between the two types. They have to be in Chip memory if FastMemPlay
is not used under the two channel mode conditions above, and although
FastMemPlay can play Chip memory samples, it makes sense to store them all in
Fast memory for the added speed.

So if you decide
to store samples in Fast memory, any samples currently in Chip memory must
be moved to Fast memory. The Move Samples To Fast/Chip Mem (Instr menu)
exist for this purpose. If there isn't enough of the target memory to hold
all the samples, a requester appears. Free some Fast or Chip memory and try
again.

There's a new addition to Main Control's instrument size display box (on the
far right), to support Fast memory samples. If there's an apostrophe after
the sample size (e.g. 5892'), the sample is stored in Fast memory.
Otherwise, it's in the usual Chip memory.


Other changes

When saving instruments in all formats except Raw, the frequency that
corresponds to the instrument's Default Pitch setting in Instrument
Properties is now saved. If the pitch is blank, 8363 Hz is used. Because of
the difficulties with converting frequencies to exact notes, sample
frequencies are not loaded.

There's a new menu in the Sample List Editor: Format. It controls the file
format of samples saved using Save Inst or Save All Insts. There's a
different menu for 8-bit and 16-bit samples, so you can (for example) save
8-bit samples as Raw but 16-bit samples as WAVE.

NEW MIDI FEATURES

MIDI controllers


Setting a MIDI controller to a different value in OctaMED V6 involved a less
than ideal process. Using a combination of player command types 05 and 00,
you could set any MIDI controller you choose. Command 05's level is the
controller number, command 00's the controller value. So if OctaMED came
across this in a song:

      --- 00509
      --- 00004

then OctaMED would set MIDI controller number 9 to 4. The obvious
disadvantage with this is that it takes two lines: one to provide the
controller number, another to provide the value.

The 05 and 00 player command types can still be used, but this window cuts
the setting of MIDI controllers down to one line. You define command types
31 - 3F to set your chosen MIDI controller numbers to the value given by the
command level you use in the song.

For example, you can define player command type 35 to set MIDI controller
number 12. Then, if you use command 3506 in your song, OctaMED sets MIDI
controller number 12 to 6. So, only one player command is needed to set
MIDI controllers, instead of two.

MIDI controller definitions are saved and loaded with songs.

The MIDI Controllers window

Define your MIDI controller player command set by selecting Controller
Commands from the MIDI menu. This opens the MIDI Controllers window.

Starting at the top of the window, the slider selects a player command type.
Choose one of types 31 to 3F. The xx in the value refers to the variable
player command level, which is the value to which the controller should be
changed.

Clear Current clears the selected player command type's setting; its
controller type is set to Standard [MSB], its number to 0. Clear All does
this to all player command types.

The other gadgets show the selected command type's setting: its controller
type and number. The controller type can be Standard, RPN or NRPN, together
with [MSB] or [LSB]. Although controller numbers can be as high as 16383,
Standard controllers only reach 127.

Controller types

Standard sets a "standard" MIDI controller, which uses the Control Change
MIDI message to change its value. Some standard controllers can be changed
using existing player commands; for example, command 17 sets the volume
controller (number 7). Some other controllers available are foot controller
(number 4) and balance (number 8). You will find a list of standard
controllers in any good book on MIDI.

RPN sets a Registered Parameter Number controller, which uses RPN MIDI
messages. These can be thought of as extensions to standard controllers, as
the Control Change message only supports 128 controllers. Each extended
controller is defined in the MIDI standard; an example is pitch bend
sensitivity (number 0).

NRPN sets a Non-Registered Parameter Number controller. These are similar to
RPN controllers, except that the controllers are not defined in the MIDI
standard. Instead, individual makers of MIDI equipment are free to define
their own "custom" controllers. So each MIDI device has a different set of
NRPN controllers. Please refer to your device's manual for further details.

When using your MIDI controller player command type in your song, you set
the player command level to the required new controller value. Depending on
the controller, this value can be 7-bit (anything from 0 to 127), or 14-bit
(0 to 16383). For controllers taking 7-bit values, the controller type
should be [MSB]. For those taking 14-bit values, you may need to define two
separate command types: one [MSB], one [LSB].

[LSB] stands for Least Significant Byte. It is not necessary to use a
controller's LSB value, but it enables you to "finetune" the MSB value (Most
Significant Byte). For example, the pitch bend sensitivity RPN controller
can be set in halfsteps using MSB, or 1/128th halfsteps using a combination
of LSB and MSB.

If you need to use a controller's LSB value, firstly define two separate
command types. Their controller numbers should be the same, their controller
types also identical except for the difference in LSB and MSB. Then, enter
the two player commands at the appropriate point in your song; the LSB must
come before the MSB.

For example, to set up and change the pitch bend sensitivity controller:

1) Select command 31 (for example). Set its controller type to RPN [MSB],
   its controller number to 0.

2) Select command 32 (for example). Set its controller type to RPN [LSB],
   its controller number to 0.

3) To change the controller to value 900 (for example), firstly divide 900
   by 128; the answer is 7 remainder 4.

4) The quotient is the MSB value, the remainder the LSB value. LSB must be
   sent first, so enter player command 3204 into the song. Immediately
   afterwards, enter player command 3107.

This value 900 can be thought of as 7 "normal" steps plus 4 "finetuned" steps.
In this particular example, 4 finetuned steps is unlikely to make a great
deal of difference, so it would be less hassle just to define the [MSB]
controller and use only command 3107.


MIDI Slave Mode

Introduction

Using the MIDI menu's Slave Mode Active item, you can turn your Amiga into
a MIDI device! Why on earth would you want to do that? Well, if you're
lucky enough to own two Amigas, you can use the sound channels of both
Amigas together, to play a total of 8 samples at once rather than the usual
4. You do this by using one Amiga to control the other, as if it were a
MIDI keyboard.

Another use for the feature is to completely ignore OctaMED's sequencing
capabilities, and to use your Amiga as simply another MIDI device in your
collection. The Amiga could be controlled by a dedicated MIDI sequencer,
perhaps even on a different make of computer.

The idea is: The Amiga receives information that a note of a given pitch is
to be played on a given MIDI channel. It then tries to match that
information with an instrument in memory. If a matching instrument is found,
that instrument is played at the given pitch. Two settings are matched:

  The MIDICh slider. The instrument that is played has a MIDICh setting
  equivalent to the MIDI channel information received. For example, if the
  note is to be played on channel 4, the played instrument has MIDICh set to
  4.

  The pitch. Optionally, an instrument can have a Default Pitch set. If so,
  that instrument has a range of 3 octaves, its lowest note being the
  Default Pitch. So the pitch received falls within the pitch range of the
  played instrument.

One slight drawback is that each instrument can only be played using one
particular sound channel. That sound channel is received as the MIDI preset
number.

It may be difficult to understand at first, so here's how to set up each of
the two examples of the feature's usage: joining two Amigas together, and
using the Amiga as an additional MIDI device.

Joining two Amigas together

This works best in 4-channel mode, for highest quality. You compose your
song using one of the Amigas (call it the "master"), and use the other Amiga
(the "slave") only as a note player. The blocks in your song should be 8
tracks wide: Use tracks 0 - 3 for instruments played by the master Amiga,
and tracks 4 - 7 for those played by the slave Amiga.

Here's how you set it all up:

1) Attach a MIDI interface to each of the two Amigas. Connect MIDI OUT on
   the master Amiga to MIDI IN on the slave Amiga.

2) Load OctaMED into both Amigas. Select MIDI Active from the MIDI menu on
   the master Amiga. Select MIDI Active, Input Active and Slave Mode Active
   (all in the MIDI menu) on the slave Amiga. Make sure both Amigas are in
   4-channel mode.

3) Now to set up the instruments. Go to each Amiga in turn, and load the
   instruments you want to be played on that Amiga. So if you want a
   particular couple of instruments to be played on the master Amiga, load
   them into the master Amiga. Instruments to be played on the slave Amiga
   should be loaded into the slave Amiga.

   The same instrument can't "share" computers; you must assign each
   instrument to either the master or the slave Amiga.

4) On the slave Amiga, give each loaded instrument a MIDI channel number. In
   other words, set each instrument's MIDICh slider to an appropriate value.
   As far as possible, try to give each instrument a different channel number.
   There are 16 different MIDI channels, so if the slave Amiga has no more
   than 16 instruments loaded, there shouldn't be any MIDI channel clashes.

   If clashes are unavoidable - in other words, there are more than 16
   instruments - you must set a default pitch for every instrument which
   shares a MIDI channel number. Such instruments have a 3-octave pitch
   range; the Default Pitch is the instrument's lowest note.

   For example, suppose that instruments 08 and 0J share MIDI channel 5.
   When the slave Amiga receives a MIDI message that a note should be played
   on MIDI channel 5, the slave Amiga wouldn't know which instrument to
   play. Should it be 08 or 0J? It's decided by the pitch of the note.
   Perhaps instrument 08 has a 3-octave range starting at C-6, and 0J a
   range starting at C-1. Then if note D-7 were received on MIDI channel 5,
   OctaMED would play instrument 08 at pitch D-7, because D-7 is within 08's
   range (but not 0J's, whose range stops at B-3, 3 octaves above C-1).

   If the ranges overlap so that a received note could be played on one or
   more instruments, it's played on the first instrument encountered; that
   is, the one with the lowest instrument number.

5) On the master Amiga, you actually need two categories of instrument:
   those to be played on the master Amiga (which you've loaded),
   and MIDI instruments that correspond to each instrument you've loaded
   into the slave Amiga. Now, let's say you've loaded a sample named
   "Fantasia" into the slave Amiga, and given it MIDI channel 6. On the
   master Amiga,

   a) Select any empty instrument slot

   b) Open Instrument Properties (Instr menu)

   c) Change the instrument Name to "Fantasia [slave]" (for example)

   d) Slide the MIDICh slider to 6 (the same channel number as Fantasia)

   e) You must also tell OctaMED which sound channel on the slave Amiga
      that Fantasia should be played through, using the Preset slider. So
      if Fantasia is to be played through channel 2, slide Preset to 2.
      Because there are 4 sound channels, each played using one of tracks
      0 - 3, you can slide Preset to 0, 1, 2 or 3.

      Be careful when deciding which instrument should be played through
      which channel. If you've loaded up to 4 instruments into the slave
      Amiga, you just need to assign a different sound channel to each
      instrument. If you have more than 4 instruments, though, you should
      take care that no two instruments are set to play through the same
      channel at the same time, because this is impossible! This depends on
      your song.

      Remember that in 4-channel mode, sound channels correspond to tracks.
      For example, notes played on track 1 are always played through sound
      channel 1.

   f) Close Instrument Properties

   Now when you want to play, say, note G-2 using the Fantasia instrument,
   you should enter a G-2 using the Fantasia [slave] instrument on the
   master Amiga. Repeat steps a to f for each instrument you've loaded into
   the slave Amiga.

6) Now compose your song! Use 8-track blocks. For instruments played through
   the master Amiga, use tracks 0 - 3 as usual. For those played through the
   slave Amiga, use tracks 4 - 7 and the MIDI instruments you've set up to
   correspond with the slave Amiga's instruments. Then just play the song: it
   should be quite an amazing effect!

Using your Amiga as a MIDI device

Again, this works best in 4-channel mode, for highest quality. The procedure
is much the same as for joining two Amigas together.

1) Connect MIDI OUT (or MIDI THRU) on the external sequencer to MIDI IN on
   the Amiga.

2) Load required instruments into the Amiga.

3) Set up the instruments as in step 3 of part 13.2.2.

4) On your external sequencer, play a particular Amiga sample by playing a
   note through the MIDI channel corresponding to the sample's MIDICh value,
   at a pitch within the sample's range (if a range is set). If you're
   unsure of how MIDI pitches correspond to OctaMED pitches, switch Input
   Active and Edit mode on and try entering a note, noting its pitch.

Other notes

a) Slave mode only responds to MIDI Note On messages. So any
   effects received, including player commands, will be ignored.

b) You can, however, use player command 0C (set volume) with notes played
   by the slave Amiga. The instrument's default volume (in Instrument
   Properties) changes to the appropriate level when a 0C is received. The
   Instrument Properties slider isn't updated, though, for efficiency
   reasons.

c) To reduce the amount of MIDI data sent, you should really switch on
   Suppress NoteOff on all of the MIDI instruments defined on the master
   Amiga.

Thanks to Joe Pierlejewski for suggesting improvements to this feature.


Other new features and player commands

An Immediate Preset Change item has been added to the MIDI menu. When a
particular instrument's Preset value is changed in Instrument Properties,
usually a preset change message is sent the next time a note is played with
that instrument. With this item on, a preset change message is sent straight
away. So as you move the Preset slider, OctaMED is busy sending a preset
change message for every value that the slider takes.

Player command 0FF7 suspends play until all MIDI messages have been sent.
This is mainly for use at the very start of songs, if you have long
initialization messages that you need to send to your device before playing
starts.

You can now use both digits of the command level with command type 08 (set
Hold value). So much longer holds can be created.

"Raw" MIDI messages - that is, messages that haven't been saved using
OctaMED's MIDI Message Editor - are now loaded correctly. Also, after a
message has been sent using Send Msg, a confirmation message is now shown.

SMF Load Options has moved to the bottom of the MIDI menu.

NEW EDITING FEATURES

Replace Notes

The Replace Notes window, opened through the Edit menu, is an extension to
the Change Notes feature of the Transpose window (although the Swap feature
is not provided, only Change). Both the note and its instrument number and
player command can be changed. Programmable key-like "transparency" is also
supported.

You provide OctaMED with a "source" note and a "destination" note. Then,
OctaMED replaces all source notes found in a particular area of the song
with the destination note. For example, you can replace all C-2 10C32's in
the current track with C-2 10C48 if you like.

Setting the source and destination notes

Set the source and destination notes in the Source and Dest boxes, both
initially xxxxxxxx. This means that all parts of the note are "transparent"
(see the following section). As well as the note name and octave number,
you also set the note's instrument number and player command.
(In the help guide, a note with its five digits is called a "full note".)

You set the Source and Dest boxes in exactly the same way as in the
Programmable Keys window. To set a note, hold down the left mouse button
over the note in the box (initially the first three 'x's), then press the
note's key and release the mouse button.

For example, to set the Source note to G-2: Position the mouse over the
note in the Source box. Now hold down the left mouse button, and press T.
Assuming that Oct is set to 12 (Main Control window), the note becomes G-2.
To set the note to ---, use the Del key.

To set an instrument digit or player command digit, hold the left mouse
button over the digit, then type the digit and release the mouse button.

To reset Source or Dest to xxxxxxxx, use the Res buttons. The Swap button
swaps the Source and Dest notes. This can be used as an "undo" feature: To
reverse the effect of (for example) clicking Block, click Swap then click
Block again.

Transparent notes/digits

When setting a note or digit, try pressing Return instead of pressing the
note's key or typing the digit. The note or digit is now "transparent", and
is shown as 'x'.

Transparent notes or digits are ignored by OctaMED. So if the Source box
contains xxx x0C32, OctaMED will replace all 0C32 player commands,
regardless of their note and instrument number. Similarly, if the Source
box contains G-3 4xxxx, then OctaMED will replace all G-3's played by
instrument 04, regardless of what their command digits are.

Transparency in the Dest box has a slightly different meaning. If the Dest
box contains xxx x0C32, then the player command of all Source notes will
become 0C32: the note and instrument number will remain unchanged.
Similarly, if the Dest box contains G-3 4xxxx, all Source notes will become
G-3 and will be played by instrument 04: their command digits will remain
unaffected.

Both sets of notes and digits are all transparent by default, as this is
considered the most useful default setting.

Replacing the notes

In the lower half of the window, the six buttons replace the given notes
in one of six different areas. These areas are as in the Transpose window,
aside from Note which replaces just the Tracker editor's current note.

For example, clicking Block replaces the Source note with the Dest note
throughout the current block. Sel. Tracks replaces throughout the
"selected" tracks (a track is selected by clicking on its S gadget at the
top of the Tracker editor).

Examples

Transparency and the choice of six areas make this window pretty powerful.
Here are a few examples to help you get the hang of it.

1) Throughout the entire song, change all G-2 notes to C-3.

   Source: G-2 xxxxx
   Dest:   C-3 xxxxx
   Click:  Song

   (The Transpose window's Change Notes function can also do this.

    Notice that if the Source and Dest digits were set to 00000, only G-2
    notes having no instrument or player command - very unlikely! - would
    be affected. The xxxxx makes OctaMED ignore the digits.)

2) Throughout the track that the Tracker editor's cursor is currently on,
   change all instrument 02 to 06. (So any notes played by instrument 02
   on the current track will instead be played by instrument 06.)

   Source: xxx 2xxxx
   Dest:   xxx 6xxxx
   Click:  Track

   (The Transpose window's Change Instrument function can also do this.)

3) Throughout the current block, change all 04 command types to 14 (normal
   vibrato to Protracker-compatible vibrato).

   Source: xxx x04xx
   Dest:   xxx x14xx
   Click:  Block

   (Dest could also be xxx x1xxx, because the second command type digit of
    Source notes is already 4.)

4) Throughout the Tracker editor's marked range, clear all command digits.

   Source: xxx xxxxx  (This means "any note or digits")
   Dest:   xxx x0000
   Click:  Range

   (Sets the command digits of all notes in the range to 0000, leaving the
    notes and instrument numbers untouched)


Changes to Generic Slide

Player commands interpret their command level in one of three different
ways, depending on the type. Some, like 0C (set volume), take both digits
together as a single positive value. Others, like 04 (vibrato), take each
digit separately as different values. With vibrato, the 1st command level
digit represents speed, the 2nd depth.

Still others, like MIDI command 03, take both digits together as a "signed"
value. So command 03's level can range from -128 to 127 (decimal), instead
of the normal 0 to 255.

Previously, Generic Slide always assumed the command level to be a single
positive value. Now it's a bit more intelligent!

1) Command types taking a signed number now slide in a signed way. For
   example (in MIDI mode):

   Initial values     Old Gen. Slide    New Gen. Slide

     --- 003FD          --- 003FD         --- 003FD
     --- 00000          --- 003AA         --- 003FF
     --- 00000          --- 00356         --- 00301
     --- 00303          --- 00303         --- 00303

2) Command types interpreting each digit separately have the digits slid
   independently of each other. For example:

   Initial values     Old Gen. Slide    New Gen. Slide

     --- 00457          --- 00457         --- 00457
     --- 00000          --- 00444         --- 0044A
     --- 00000          --- 00432         --- 0042C
     --- 0041F          --- 0041F         --- 0041F

   So in this example, level digit 1 (speed) slides downwards from 5 to 1,
   while digit 2 (depth) slides up from 7 to F. Previously, this wasn't
   possible.

Making a slide with Mix mode command 20 (relative sample offset) ensures
that command 2000 is never added, because this reverses the sample. Also,
stereo separation slides (command 2FDx) are created properly.


Other new features

The Transpose window has a new cycle gadget, Out-of-range Notes. It
determines what OctaMED should do with notes that are to be transposed out
of range; that is, notes to be made lower than C-1 and higher than F#B, as
a result of a transposition. Change Octave transposes the note name but
leaves the octave number unaffected. Leave Intact leaves the whole note
unaffected. Deleted removes the whole note.

Also in Transpose, the Change button in the Change Instruments section now
works if Instruments Slots is on. It moves the source instrument to the
destination instrument slot.

All Cmd Pages is a new switch, in the Block, Track and Edit menus, that
affects cutting and copying. When on (default), Cut and Copy affect all
command pages. When off, only notes in the current command page are cut or
copied.

OctaMED's behaviour when pasting command pages has also changed. If there is
only one page in the copy buffer, it is pasted to the current page. If there
are several, they are pasted to their respective positions, starting from
page 1. Selecting Paste from the Block menu increases the number of pages in
the current block, if the block contains fewer pages than the copy buffer,
to accommodate the extra pages.

Re-mark Range in the Edit menu brings back the most recently marked range in
the Tracker editor.

@node "Arexx"

NEW AREXX FEATURES

ARexx Script

This Project menu item opens a file requester to execute an ARexx file. It
is useful for quickly running an ARexx script without having to set up a
keyboard shortcut definition for it.

Any ARexx script can be run; scripts are limited neither to those ending in
.omed or .rexx, nor to those in the REXX: directory. There must not,
however, be a space in either the path name or the file name. This has the
unfortunate consequence that scripts in RAM: can't immediately be executed,
because RAM: has the volume name "Ram Disk", which contains a space. To get
around this, relabel RAM: with a name that doesn't contain a space. For
example:

   relabel ram: RamDisk
   
This can be put in OctaMED's startup-sequence (but make sure you're using a
copy of the original disk!).


ARexx Trigger Setup

This window, opened through the Display menu, is home to a powerful new
feature. Now, OctaMED's ARexx commands can be executed while playing a song,
by assigning a player command to an ARexx command. As in the Keyboard
Shortcuts window (and Input Map Editor), ARexx scripts, other programs'
ARexx commands, and even whole programs can also all be executed by a single
player command.

The player command type that executes ARexx commands is 2D. 256 different
ARexx commands can be assigned, as there are 256 possible command levels
with type 2D (01 to FF). At the top of the window, select a player command
to edit using the slider. Clear Current sets the current command's action to
None. Clear All does the same to all commands.

The Action area describes what the player command is to do if it appears in
a song. It is exactly like the Action area in the Keyboard Shortcuts window
and Input Map Editor. As a reminder, the top cycle gadget can take the
following values:

  None: The player command has no effect.

  OctaMED Command: Executes an OctaMED ARexx command (type it into the
                   Command box, with any required parameters).

  Execute ARexx File: Executes an ARexx script (type its name into Command.)

  Ext. ARexx Command: Sends an ARexx command to another program (type the
                      command into Command, the program's ARexx port into
                      ARexx Port).

  Launch Program: Launches (runs) an executable program (type its filename
                  into Command).


New ARexx commands

OctaMED Soundstudio includes version 2 of OctaMED's ARexx support.
New version 2 commands are listed in @{" Appendix E  " link "AppE" 0} of this manual.
When writing ARexx scripts that use the new commands, make sure
that your script checks that the version of OctaMED running supports
version 2 commands (that is, it is the Soundstudio rather than V6);
otherwise, the commands will not work.

To do this, include something like the following at the start of your
script:

've_octamedrexx'
if result < 2 then do
   'wi_request "This script requires OctaMED Soundstudio to run.",
               "Proceed"'
   exit
end


Other new ARexx features

"Show Changed Settings" in Miscellaneous Options: When on, whenever an ARexx
option is changed, either within OctaMED or by using ARexx itself, its name
and its new value is shown on the title bar. If "(S)" is shown, the option can
be saved using Save Settings.

This might be useful for debugging ARexx scripts, and for obtaining option
names easily without having to look at the docs. It also serves as a
confirmation message for keyboard shortcuts. There is a known bug in this
feature: Negative settings values are displayed incorrectly.

Error handling has been tidied up in the Soundstudio. If ARexx reports an
error or produces any text output, OctaMED now opens an ARexx Output window
to display the text. In V6, if ARexx reported an error, the computer would
do nothing and it was difficult to work out what had gone wrong.

Also, a "ARexx Program Not Found" requester is now shown if OctaMED tries to
execute a non-existent ARexx script. OctaMED also reports if an external
program's ARexx port cannot be opened.

In the Command Shell (Project menu), type "clear" to clear the window. (The
old BASIC command "cls" also works, as in V6.)

@node "Misc"

MISCELLANEOUS NEW FEATURES


Default directories

Open the Default Directories window through the Miscellaneous Options
window. Use this window to tell OctaMED where you usually keep your songs,
instruments and ARexx scripts.

For example, if your usual songs disk is called MEDSongs1:, type MEDSongs1:
into the Songs text box. Similarly, if you store your ARexx scripts in a
hard disk directory called Work:ARexx/Scripts, then type that into the ARexx
Scripts box.

If you don't have a "usual" disk or directory for instruments, for example,
then leave the Instruments box blank. You can also select a disk or
directory by clicking on one of the small GetFile gadgets to the left of
each text box.

The default directories are loaded into relevant file requesters when they
are first opened. The Songs directory, for example, is loaded when you first
select Open or Save from the Project menu. The Instruments directory is used
when loading and saving instruments; ARexx Script is used by Execute ARexx
Script.

Module Formats

OctaMED can now load modules created on two different PC sequencers:
ScreamTracker 3 (S3M) and FastTracker 1.0. Not all S3M effects are
supported, but most modules play without trouble. The effects that are
supported are:

  Extra fine slides (commands EEx, EFx)
  Tremor (command Ixy)
  Retrig and volume slide (command Qxy)

The more popular FastTracker 2 is not yet supported
but no doubt will be in the PC version!

Play After Loading is now situated in the Project menu, under Open.

AmigaDOS Shell in the Project menu opens an AmigaDOS shell, just like the
shell you can open on the Workbench, on the OctaMED screen. You can now load
and run programs or use AmigaDOS commands like "copy" or "dir". Close the
window by typing "endcli" or clicking its close gadget.

In the Song Annotation window, Show After Loading affects what happens when
a song with annotation text is loaded. Normally, the Song Annotation window
is immediately opened, displaying the song's text. Switch Show After Loading
off to prevent this. Show After Loading is not saved with songs; the user
states whether or not the song's text should immediately shown, not the song
writer.


The Keyboard Shortcuts window

A small set of Protracker shortcuts, called PTKeys.keyboard, was provided
with OctaMED V6. Thanks to Eberhard Hafermalz, OctaMED Soundstudio includes
many more shortcuts, to help former Protracker users make the transition to
OctaMED, to use the shortcuts, check out the rexx drawer on this CD.

You can now make a copy of the current shortcut by holding down Shift
while clicking "Ins. New" or "App. New". This is useful for making a new
shortcut similar to the current one.

You can also now create an empty shortcut for the Help key, thus turning
the "press Help for Help" feature off - the Project menu item can be
selected instead.
This avoids situations where the Help file is accidentally loaded
instead of deleting a note (i.e. Help rather than Del is pressed). Do bear
in mind, though, that the organisation of the new help file should keep
loading from disk to a minimum.

The V6 manual neglected to mention that attempting to redefine a Right
Amiga menu shortcut will unfortunately fail. For example, a shortcut created
for Right Amiga-O will be ignored, because Right Amiga-O is converted by the
Amiga to the Open item in the Project menu. OctaMED has no control over
this.


Player command features

There are three new ways to make entering double-figure player commands
easier.

  To enter command types 10 to 1F, position the cursor over the second
  command type digit, and press key G to V. (Alt-0 to F also still works.)

  To enter types 20 to 2F, position the cursor as before, and press
  Shift-Alt-0 to F. (Be careful: Shift-Alt-C usually means Copy Block!)

  To enter types 30 to 3F, position the cursor as before, and press
  Alt-G to V.

In the Main Control window, shift-clicking STOP to insert a 0FFE player
command no longer works. This shouldn't be a major problem.


Many other small enhancements have been made and previously reported bugs
have been fixed.

We hope you find this, what could well be the last version of OctaMED
for the Amiga platform, useful and enjoyable it took a *lot* of work
and due to the state of the Amiga, gave us no earnings whatsoever! ;(

In fact, due to the vast amounts of piracy, we nearly went bankrupt!

So, many thanks to the thousands of Amiga users, (who will probably never
get to read this, but what the heck ),  for stealing our program instead
of being honest and buying it!!

Just in  case one of those guilty parties ever gets to read this.....

Please don't come back and say it wasn't pirated, we know for a fact
that an idiotic @{fg shine}asshole@{fg text} living here in the UK
actually went on the net and told people how to do it!!

          @{fg shine}Do I sound bitter?, you bet your sweet ass I am@{fg text}!!!!!!

                   AN INTRODUCTION TO OCTAMED SOUNDSTUDIO

This is an introduction to OctaMED's main features: The manual cannot cover
all the program's functions. However, if you discover anything in OctaMED
that you're unsure how to use, just press the Help key for full
instructions.

On loading OctaMED, three windows should appear. Main Control provides
access to some important functions, and Information displays useful
information. The middle window is called the Tracker editor; this is where
you usually create songs.

[Screenshot of main screen]

The best way to learn about creating an OctaMED song is to load in a demo
song and examine it. To load a song, hold down the right mouse button and
select Open from the Project menu (on the left-hand side of the title bar).
A file requester appears; you'll encounter one often while using OctaMED.

To listen to the loaded song, find the playing buttons on the left-hand side
of the Main Control window. Click on the Play button beside Song. When
you've had enough, click STOP or press the space bar. The Cont button
continues the song from where it left off.

Now let's examine the components which make up a song.


THE COMPONENTS OF A SONG

The instruments

(Note: Shift-<right> (for example) means hold down a Shift key and press the
right arrow key.)

The current instrument's details are displayed at the top of the Main
Control window. 01 is its number, with it's its name and size in bytes.
Select the next instrument (number 02) by pressing Shift-<right>.
Repeatedly press Shift-<right> to view all the instruments in the song.

Notice that not all instrument 'slots' (available spaces) have to be used by
a song out of the possible 63, also notice that the numbering system used is
unorthodox: 01 - 09, 0A - 0V, 10 - 19, 1A - 1V. 1V is the final instrument
slot, the 63rd.

OctaMED can use five different 'types' of instrument, and easily the most
commonly used type is the sample. Samples are sounds from real-life, often
created by feeding the sound into the computer from a sound source (e.g.
tape recorder). All the instruments used in this song are samples.

Repeatedly press Shift-<left> until the instrument number becomes 01. Now
let's try playing the instruments; this is done using the Amiga's keyboard.
OctaMED arranges the keyboard into about 2½ octaves, laid out to resemble a
two-tier piano keyboard.

         Piano keyboard layout: the notes of one octave

                | |  | |  |  | |  | |  | |  | |
                | |  | |  |  | |  | |  | |  | |

   Z X C V B N M | , . /         |                <== White keys (naturals)

Try playing notes with the keys listed above. For example, press the
following keys in turn to play a C major scale:

                  Z X C V B N M Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ]

Use Shift-<left> and Shift-<right> to change the instrument that the notes
are played on.


The blocks

A song is made up of several small pieces of music called "blocks". Blocks
consist of many lines of information, and are displayed in the Tracker
editor (the middle window). Only one block can be displayed at a time.

All the blocks in this song contain 64 lines and 4 columns (or tracks). The
lines are numbered 000 - 063 on the far left, and the tracks are numbered in
small blue squares at the top of the window. Try using the <up> and <down>
keys to scroll through the block. You can also do this by dragging the grey
or white scroll bar at the far right of the Tracker editor.

In the Information window, find the block status display (to the right of
the B button). It will display *something* like:

        6/25: Synth (part 2)

In this example, block number 6 is currently being displayed in the Tracker
editor; that is, it's the current block. The current block's name is Synth
(part 2), and block number 25 is the last block in the song. Note that the
first block's number is 0 (zero) rather than 1.

Watching the changes to the block status display and the Tracker editor, try
using Shift-<up> and Shift-<down> to select a new current block. Left Alt -
<up>/<down> selects the first/last block.

To listen to the current block, find the playing buttons on the left-hand
side of the Main Control window. Click on the Play button beside Block. Use
STOP or the space bar to stop the block, and Cont to continue the block.
When the block has played through, it will start again. Stop the playing
when you've heard enough.


The block's contents

So just what do all these letters, numbers and dashes displayed in the
Tracker editor mean? Well, the Amiga plays music using four sound channels,
each of which can play one sample at a time. The four tracks (columns) in
the Tracker editor correspond to these sound channels.

Music is composed by entering notes on to these tracks. A typical note might
be C-2 10C32. Here's how this note is made up:

                      octave    player command type
                      number      /|
                           |     / |
                       C - 2   1 0 C 3 2
                       |       |     \ |
                    note    instr.    \|
                    name    number   player command level

So note C is played on instrument number 01 using octave number 2. The note
also has a player command (0C32), which means 'set the note's volume to
level 32'. Octave numbers and player commands will be explained later.


The playing sequence

To create a song, the blocks are linked together. This involves creating a
list of blocks in the order in which they should be played. This list is
called the playing sequence.

Look carefully at the Information window, and notice that there are two
buttons that seem to be called Sq. Look again and you'll see that the
left-hand one is actually Sg. Click on the other one to open the Playing
Sequence window.

In this window you'll find a list of block numbers and their names. On the
left are two columns of numbers. The left-hand column contains the playing
sequence line numbers, the right-hand column the block numbers on each line.
Although the line numbers are in ascending order, the block numbers can be
in any order and the same number can feature more than once in the list.

When the song is played (by clicking Song Play in the Main Control window),
the song starts playing from playing sequence line 001. Each block in the
sequence is played in turn, the block currently being played marked with a
blue bar.

Close the window by clicking either its close gadget (far top left) or its
Exit button (bottom).


HOW A SONG IS CREATED

OK. We've had a look at the basic structure of a song; now let's examine how
to create a song. Firstly, clear the loaded song by selecting New from the
Project menu then clicking Clear All in the window that appears.

Load instruments

By default OctaMED has no instruments in memory; they must be loaded in.
You can either select Load Instrument(s) from the Instr menu, or click the
small GetFile button sandwiched between the instrument number and name in
the Main Control window.

Try loading in some samples (if you don't have any, most PD libraries will
be happy to help). Remember to select the instrument number first using
Shift-<left> and Shift-<right>. Use the Volumes button in the file requester
to select the correct disk. You can select more than one instrument by
holding down Shift and clicking on several files (then click Ok); the
instruments are then loaded into successive instrument slots.


Enter notes

Firstly, select the instrument that you wish the note to be played on. Use
Shift-<left> and Shift-<right> as usual. Next, position the cursor where you
wish the note to be in the Tracker editor. Use <up>, <down>, Alt-<left> and
Alt-<right> for this.

Now switch edit mode on by clicking on the Edit check box (Main Control
window). Then play the note using the keyboard
The note name, octave number and instrument number is entered.

Just what is this 'octave number'? Well, OctaMED
arranges the Amiga's keyboard into 2½ octaves. However, OctaMED's
instruments can play using more octaves than this, depending on the
instrument's type. Samples, for example, can play using 3 octaves, numbered
1 - 3 (this is the octave number).

So how do you play the extra octaves? Well, by default the keyboard's lower
octave (Z - M) plays using octave number 1, the middle octave (Q - U) using
number 2, and the upper half-octave (I - ]) using about half of 3. This can
be changed by using function keys F1 - F5.

Find the Oct cycle gadget in the Main Control window. The 12 refers to the
lower octave and middle octave's current octave numbers, 1 and 2
respectively. Now press the F2 key. The Oct gadget is now 23. So the lower
octave's number is 2 and the middle octave's 3. (The upper half-octave uses
about half of octave 4, but since samples can only play using 3 octaves you
can't use octave 4 with samples).

Confused? Try entering a few notes, using F1 to select octaves 1 and 2 and
F2 to select 2 and 3, and examine the octave number of each note. For
example, how about a bass drum instrument on track number 0 every fourth
line (000, 004, 008...), and maybe a hi-hat on track 1 every second line?
Stick with something very simple like that to start with, and it shouldn't
be long before entering notes becomes second nature.

Remember to use the Block Play button in the Main Control window to play the
block through. Remove notes (that is, enter a blank note: --- 0) by
positioning the cursor over the offending note and pressing the Del key.


Add new blocks (and change their length)

By default there is just one block in the song, number 0. To add a new
block, select Append from the Block menu's New submenu. Look at the block
status display in the Information window and notice that the
last block in the song is now number 1. Select this block by pressing
Shift-<down>, and return to the previous block using Shift-<up>.

Usually blocks are 64 lines long. (Note for musicians: this allows for 4
measures of 4/4 time; each line is one sixteenth-note.) You can change this
length if you so desire by selecting Set Properties from the Block menu.
Click inside the Length box in the window that appears, delete the 64 using
the Del or Backspace keys, and type in the new length and press Return. The
maximum length is 3200 lines.

In the Block Properties window you can also name a block by typing its name
into the Name box; its name appears in the block status display. Using the
Tracks slider you can change the number of tracks (maximum is 64), but this
is only useful when using 5 to 8-channel mode or MIDI (explained later).

Open the Block List window by selecting Block List from the Block menu. This
window provides a list of all blocks and their names. The blue bar
highlights the block currently shown in the Tracker editor; select another
block by clicking on its name or number in the list. The Append New button
is the same as Append in the Block menu; Insert New inserts a new block at
the current block position (same as Insert in the Block menu).

The Block List can also be opened by clicking the small B button in the
Information window. Holding down a Shift key while clicking this button
opens Block Properties.


Link the blocks together

As discussed in part 1.4, to create a song blocks are linked together by
creating a list of blocks in the order they should be played. This list is
called the playing sequence. You can open the Playing Sequence window by
selecting Playing Sequence from the Song menu.

There is always at least one line in the list, and by default it's block
000. Change this number using the two arrows just below the list (note that
the number can't be increased beyond the number of the last block in the
song). Add a new line by using the Insert or Append buttons, in the same way
as for blocks. In the Block List, the Ins to Seq and App to Seq buttons
insert and append the block currently shown in the Tracker editor to the
playing sequence.

The display box just below the list shows the current playing sequence line
number and the total number of lines in the list. This is duplicated in the
Information window. When Follow is switched on, the current playing sequence
line number is kept as close to the middle of the list as possible during
play (try clicking Play Song with Follow on to see this effect).


Save the song

Select Save from the Project menu. If there is no filename in the box at the
top of the Save Options window, a file requester appears to select a name.
Switching Create Icon off prevents OctaMED saving an icon file with the song
(for use with Workbench).

Clicking repeatedly on the No Compression cycle gadget selects one of
several forms of compression (or none at all), reducing the file size.
Calculate Size calculates the entire song's size using the current settings
(use the Packed button to calculate the song's size when compressed).

Click Save to save the song.


PLAYER COMMANDS

So far we've ignored the 0000 appearing to the right of Tracker editor note
names. Well, the four digits are collectively known as the command digits.
They allow you to add special effects to the notes, and to ask OctaMED to do
certain things. These effects and actions are called player commands.

The command digits are divided into two pairs.
The command type is the sort of effect or action, and the command level
allows you to control the effect or action's intensity, depth, speed, etc.
(depending on the sort of command).

For example, the diagram in part 1.3 shows a note with command type 0C
and level 32. Type 0C means 'set volume', so the player command sets
the note's volume level to 32. A full list of player commands is given
in @{" Appendix A" link "AppA" 0}


Player commands are entered one digit at a time, simply by moving the cursor
over to each digit (using the <left> and <right> keys) and pressing the
correct key. You'll find that turning Advance Cursor Right on will help
(select Keyboard Options from the Settings menu and click Right). Also, to
enter command types such as 19, position the cursor over the right-hand
command type digit and press Alt-9 (the left-hand digit is set to 1).

Both the command type and command level are in hexadecimal. If you're
unfamiliar with hexadecimal, please read @{" Appendix F  " link "AppF" 0}.
A rough understanding of hexadecimal is important for successful use
of player commands.


Slide creation

Slides can be created automatically, without having to painstakingly enter
each individual command in the slide. This is done using the Pitch, Volume
and Generic Slide items in the Edit menu.

To use the Pitch Slide function, firstly enter the notes that the pitch is
to slide from and to. (The notes must be on the same track). Now position
the cursor where the pitch slide is to begin; this will be somewhere between
the two notes. Finally, select Type 1 or Type 2 from the Edit menu's Pitch
Slide submenu. Try out both types; type 1 uses command type 03, type 2 uses
types 01 and 02.

For Volume Slide, you need to enter two 'set volume' (command type 0C)
commands in the same track: one to set the starting volume level, one to set
the ending level. Then position the cursor anywhere between the two commands
and select Volume Slide from the Edit menu. Generic Slide works in the same
way except that any command type (not just 0C) can be used.

The Soundstudio's new Mix mode has an additional set of player commands. See
part A.3 for more details.


EDITING THE SONG

Of course, part 2 is a very simplified guide to song creation. In
particular, OctaMED provides a number of editing features for use in the
Tracker editor that can make entering notes much easier.


Cut/Copy/Paste/Swap

You may recognize the terms cut, copy and paste from wordprocessors. Well,
in OctaMED they are exactly the same: Cut removes notes and stores them in a
copy buffer, Copy stores notes in a copy buffer without removing them, and
Paste transfers the copy buffer to the Tracker editor, overwriting any
existing notes.

Items in the Block and Track menus allow you to cut, copy or paste whole
blocks or whole tracks respectively. For example, to place a copy of track 0
in track 3: move to track 0 (using Alt-<left> and Alt-<right>), and select
Copy from the Track menu. Now move to track 3, and select Paste from the
Track menu. The Swap items swap the current block or track's contents with
the copy buffer's contents.

You can also cut, copy and paste a rectangular area of notes, known as a
"range". A range can be as small as a single note or may include an entire
block. Mark a range by moving the mouse over notes in the Tracker editor
while holding down the left mouse button. The range appears in white. Moving
the mouse beyond the limits of the Tracker editor continues the range in the
relevant direction (for example, try moving the mouse to the bottom of the
screen while holding the left mouse button).

The Edit menu contains Cut, Copy and Paste Range items. Erase Range changes
all the notes in the range to blank notes (--- 00000). If you mark a range
by mistake, press the left mouse button again to cancel it. Make the range
reappear by selecting Re-mark Range from the Edit menu.


Transpose

Select Transpose from the Edit menu. This window contains functions that
alter the notes in a particular area of the current project.

The gadgets under Affect should be selected before choosing a transpose
function. They select which area of the song the transposition should
affect, and the notes played by which instruments. The pitch-changing
functions are Octave Up/Down and Halfstep Up/Down; these should be self-
explaining.

The Change Notes functions act on the Source and Destination notes. Select
these notes by holding down the left mouse button on each note box in turn
and pressing the appropriate key (for example, the I key selects note C-3).
The Change button changes all notes in the Affect area (see above) from the
source to the destination note. Swap swaps the source and destination notes.

A more complicated and powerful note-changing feature is Replace Notes, new
to the Soundstudio. See part 14.1 for more information.

The Change Instrument functions act on the Source and Destination
instruments. Select these instruments by choosing each required instrument
(using Shift-<left> and Shift-<right>) and clicking the Source and
Destination buttons. The Change button changes notes played by the source
instrument to the destination instrument (in the Affect area). Swap swaps
the source and destination instrument numbers of notes played by either.
Delete deletes notes played by the source instrument.

If you switch Instrument Slots on, the Change Instrument buttons affect
the actual instruments, rather than notes played by the instruments. So
click Change to move the source instrument to the destination instrument
position, or Swap to swap the two instruments' positions. Delete removes the
source instrument from memory; there are five ways of doing this in OctaMED!


Track selection

Look at the top of the Tracker editor; the blue boxes are the track
selectors. They are blue when on, grey when off. Try clicking on a few to
turn them off and on.

You'll notice that there are two types: one displaying the track numbers,
one displaying S. The track number type control whether each track is played
or not played. For example, load a song and click Song Play (Main Control).
Now keeping the song playing, try turning the track numbers on and off. Do
you notice the notes in the related tracks being turned off and back on?
This can be very useful while editing blocks.

The S stands for Selected, and this type control whether each track is
'selected' or 'not selected'. They are used in editing functions such as
Paste To Selected Tracks in the Edit menu and Affect Selected Tracks in the
Transpose window.


Programmable keys (progkeys)

The progkeys allow music to be entered much more easily and quickly. You can
assign notes or groups of notes, including player commands, to 10 different
keys. The assigned notes can then be inserted anywhere in the Tracker editor
by holding down Shift and pressing key 0-9.

Select Programmable Keys from the Settings menu. The cycle gadget in this
window selects whether you wish to edit the normal Shift- 0-9 definitions
(default) or the Right Alt definition. The Right Alt definition consists of
the command digits only, and if you enter notes with the Right Alt key held
in the Tracker editor, these command digits will be inserted with the notes.

Select which progkey you wish to edit (0-9) using the slider. The box
containing --- 00000 is the definition of the selected progkey. Edit the
progkey one digit at a time, by holding the left mouse button on each digit
and entering a new note or digit using the keyboard.

To make a digit transparent (shown by an x), press Return while holding the
left mouse button. A digit being transparent means that when the progkey is
entered in the Tracker editor, the corresponding existing digit will remain
unchanged. For example, the definition xxxxx0000 would set all command
digits to zero while leaving the note and instrument number unchanged.

The Pick gadgets copy either the note under the cursor, the currently marked
range, or the copy buffer to the current definition.


Some other editing functions in brief

Space (Main Control window): When on, a set number of lines are skipped when
a note is entered. Select Keyboard Options from the Settings menu, and
adjust the Space Value slider to set the number of lines (default is 2).

Expand/Shrink (Block menu): Expand inserts empty lines between each existing
line; Shrink removes lines. If the Factor box in the window contained 3, for
example, clicking Expand would insert two empty lines between each note
(trebling the block length), and clicking Shrink would remove every second
and third line (thirding the block length). It has the effect of slowing or
quickening the music. Its function should become clear with some
experimenting.

Highlight Options (Block menu): Here you can highlight the current block's
lines in a particular order. This can mark measures and beats for you. Try
clicking the 4 gadget to highlight every fourth line: In a normal 64-line
block, this highlights every beat.


THE SAMPLE EDITOR

Making sure a sample is loaded into the current instrument slot, select
Display menu from the Sample Editor (or click Edit in the Main Control
window). The squiggly black line in this window is the sample's waveform,
which is a graphic representation of the sample.

The sample editor is used to change the whole or part of the waveform. This
can involve copying sections of waveform to other places in the sample,
changing the volume or pitch of the waveform, creating echo effects, and
much more.

The white line across the center of the waveform marks zero volume. The
further away from the white line a point on the waveform is, the louder the
point's volume.


         Volumes of points on the waveform display

    Display: 0032098 Buffsize: 32098 R Start: 0 R End: 0
   +----------------------------------------------------+ <- full volume
   |                                                    |
   |            TOP HALF OF WAVEFORM DISPLAY            | <- half volume
   |                                                    |
   +---------------------white-line---------------------+ <- zero volume
   |                                                    |
   |          BOTTOM HALF OF WAVEFORM DISPLAY           | <- half volume
   |                                                    |
   +----------------------------------------------------+ <- full volume

The number to the right of Buffsize (above the waveform in the middle) is
the size of the current sample in bytes. (In the diagram above, the sample's
size is 32098 bytes). Type a new number into this box to change the sample's
length.


Magnification

Try using the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to magnify and reduce the
display. The black horizontal scroll bar just below the display shows the
section of sample currently being displayed: drag it or use the <left> and
<right> keys to change the current sample section. The Display box (top
left) shows how many bytes of sample are currently displayed.

You can also magnify and reduce the display using the small vertical zoom
scroll bar (far right). The higher the scroll bar, the greater the
magnification. Click Play Display to play the current display at the pitch
shown just below the display on the right (note C-2 by default). Change this
pitch by holding down the left mouse button on the pitch box and pressing a
new note. When you've finished, click Show All to display the whole sample.


Range operations

Just as in the Tracker editor, you can mark a range by moving the mouse over
the waveform while holding the left mouse button. Hold a Shift key while
doing this to adjust an existing range. The byte positions of the start and
end of the range are shown by Range Start and Range End (top right). Click
Range Display to mark a range over the whole display.

Eight range-affecting buttons are situated near the bottom of the window.
Show magnifies the range to fill the whole display. Play plays the range at
the current pitch. Cut and Erase both remove the portion
marked by the range: Cut also copies the range to a copy buffer. Clear
clears the range, Copy copies the range to a copy buffer, and Paste inserts
this copy buffer at the start of the range. Reverse turns the range
backwards.

Some other range-affecting operations are hidden in the Edit menu. Paste
(Overwrite) is like Paste except it overwrites the existing sample contents
rather than inserting. Invert turns the range upside-down, Chop removes the
whole sample except for the range. In the Tools menu, Calculate Range Time
works out the time taken for the range to play at the current pitch.


Special effects

These are all found in the Effects menu, and with the exception of Change
Pitch and Mix, all affect the current range. Here are the most important
effects in brief:

Change Volume changes the range's volume. The sliders select the starting
and ending volume change, and both are percentages of the original volume.
For example, setting Start to 200% and End to 50% fades downwards from
double the original volume to half the original volume. Click CHANGE VOLUME
to change the volume, or choose from one of four presets (Fade In, Fade Out,
Halve, Double). Max increases the volume to the maximum possible without
introducing distortion. (Distortion occurs when the maximum volume limits
are exceeded).

Mix mixes the current sample (source) with the copy buffer (destination),
storing the result in the current sample. The sliders control the volumes of
the two waveforms to be mixed (50% is 'normal' volume).

Filter/Boost filters (reduces noise) and boosts (brightens) the range. The
Averaging slider controls the strength, and try cranking Distance right up
for some weird effects.

Echo allows interesting echo effects to be produced. Before echoing, you
usually need to add some extra space to the end of the sample: select Add
Workspace from the Tools menu to do this. Mark a range over both the
waveform to be echoed and the blank space that the echo is to affect. Echo
Rate is the distance, in bytes, between two echoes. Number of Echoes sets
the total number of echoes, usually quite low (1 - 10). Experimentation is
the key to this feature.

Create Chord creates chords of two to four notes from the current sample.
Specify the chord's notes by pressing keys while holding the left mouse
button on the pitch boxes (you can also use the eight preset buttons or the
four cycle gadgets). Click Play Chord for a preview, and Create Chord to
create the chord and store it in the current sample.


Sample loops

A sample loop means that the notes you play with the sample will be
sustained until stopped. This is due to a particular part of the sample
being continually repeated (or 'looped').

Try clicking the Loop check box (bottom left). The two loop pointers mark
the looped section. One way to adjust them is to drag their small black
triangles across the waveform. You can also use the Loop Point gadgets
(bottom of window): use the cycle gadget to choose whether to affect the
start or end loop pointer, then use < and > to move the pointer in steps of
two bytes, or <0 and 0> to move the pointer until a zero is found. The Loop
menu also helps loop positioning.

Decent-sounding loops often start and end at the same value, which can often
be zero (i.e. no volume). So <0 and 0> are useful in finding good loop
points. Magnification allows far more accurate loop
positioning, and good loops are often found by looping any repeating
waveform shapes in the sample (called envelopes).


OTHER FEATURES RELATING TO INSTRUMENTS

Instrument Properties

Select Set Properties from the Instr menu, or click Props in the Main
Control window. With this important window you may alter the characteristics
of the current instrument.

From the top down, the slider and arrows select the current instrument in
the same way as Shift-<left>/<right>. 1st/Last/L.U. select instrument
01/1V/the last used instrument. Flush removes the current instrument from
memory.

Set an instrument's default pitch by holding the left mouse button on the
box and pressing the appropriate key. Pressing key F then inserts the
instrument at this pitch into the Tracker editor. Useful for percussion
instruments whose pitch is often constant. Loop Start and Length are the
loop start and loop length in bytes. If On is switched off,
the loop is temporarily disabled.

Transpose raises or lowers the current instrument's pitch in halfsteps.
Finetune allows you to tune instruments in small steps. Vol sets the
instrument's default (usual) volume: 64 is maximum, 0 is silent.


The sample list

Select Sample List Editor from the Display menu. The sample list is a list
of all the instruments you have in your collection (not just samples in
fact), and is an easy way of organizing and loading instruments.

Notice that the Sample List Editor is split into two lists - a list of your
sample directories, and a list of the samples contained in those
directories. There may in fact be no directories shown; this is because you
haven't yet told OctaMED in which directories your samples are contained.

Select a directory by clicking on its name. To add more directories, click
Add Dir and select the appropriate directory in the requester that appears.
Repeat for all the directories you wish to add. OctaMED will load the names
of all files in the directories; if some of these files aren't instruments,
click on them in the left-hand list and click Remove.

To load an instrument into the current slot, click on the instrument name
then click Load Inst. Alternatively, close the Sample List Editor and click
SList in the Main Control window. This is a cut-down sample list editor used
specifically for loading instruments. Select the appropriate directory, then
simply click on the instrument name to load it. Select the current
instrument using the four Prev/Next Inst/Free buttons (or Shift-<left>
and Shift-<right> as usual).

In the Save Options window, the Save Instruments check box chooses whether
the song should be saved together with its instruments. If you switch it
off, only the instruments' names are saved with the song; when the song is
reloaded, OctaMED uses your sample list to locate and load each required
instrument from your sample disks. This saves a lot of disk space.

You can save an instrument to disk using Save Instrument from the Instr
menu. Select its file format through the Format menu.


The synthetic sound editor

An simple but much less memory-consuming alternative to the sample is the
synthetic sound (or "synthsound"). Synthsounds are artificially generated by
OctaMED, and are designed using the synthetic sound editor (Display menu).

Synthsounds are made up of one or more simple "waveforms". You can select
one of the predefined waveforms from the Preset menu, or draw your own by
dragging the mouse along a "waveform display" (one of the two speckled
boxes).

The waveforms are then linked together (although many synthsounds consist of
just a single waveform), and their volume and pitch altered by creating a
"synthsound script", a sequence of simple commands and values. A list of
available commands can be found in the help guide.

For more information, press Help, click on Instruments in the Features Guide
and follow the links to synthetic sounds.


The numeric keypad

The numeric keypad is the small collection of 18 keys on the far right of
your Amiga's keyboard (excluding A600 owners). Without alteration (using
Keyboard Shortcuts from the Settings menu), the keypad is laid out as
follows:

   Keys 1 - 9   Select instruments 1 - 9
        0       Select instrument 10
        /       Select last used instrument
        .       Change the first instrument digit (e.g. 05 -> 15, 15 -> 05)
      + or -    Next or previous instrument
      ( or )    Decrease or increase current instrument's volume by one
        *       Pick instrument number nearest the cursor
      Enter     After pressing Enter, press key A - V to select the
                corresponding instrument


MIDI FEATURES

OctaMED can output notes and some player commands to external MIDI devices
(such as MIDI synthesizers) by way of a MIDI interface which you should
connect to your Amiga's serial port.

Note: Please refer to your MIDI device's manual if you come across terms in
      this section that you aren't sure of. To glean more information, press
      Help then select MIDI from the Features Guide.

A MIDI instrument in OctaMED is not strictly an instrument, but simply a few
settings which result in the notes played with that instrument being sent
through a MIDI interface. Therefore, MIDI instruments are not loaded into
memory like other sounds.

MIDI instruments can also use the full 10½-octave range. Use the Oct cycle
gadget (Main Control window) or the F1 - F5 keys to select these. F1 and F5
cycle through three different octaves if you press them repeatedly.

Before using a MIDI instrument, you need to change some settings in the
Instrument Parameters window to the required values. MIDICh sets the MIDI
channel for the instrument (1 - 16). For example, setting it to 5 means this
instrument's notes are sent through MIDI channel 5. Preset sets the
instrument's preset number. When set to zero, OctaMED uses your keyboard's
default preset for the instrument's MIDI channel.

In order to hear a MIDI instrument, you must also set its default volume to
above zero. MIDI instruments can also use all 64 possible tracks (use the
Block Properties window). In addition, you may mix Amiga samples and MIDI
instruments on the first four tracks.

The MIDI menu contains more MIDI-specific functions and settings. MIDI
Active activates MIDI when selected. Input Active, when selected, allows the
entering of notes into the song using your MIDI device. Edit mode (Main
Control window) and MIDI Active must be on.

Read Key-Up's, when switched on, records key-up events into the Tracker
editor (as 0FFF player commands). Read Volume: If you have a touch-sensitive
keyboard, the volume will be entered as a 'set volume' player command (0C)
when notes are input.

Reset Pitch/Presets resets pitchbenders, modulation wheels and presets on
all channels. (OctaMED sends preset change messages for all MIDI channels).


OTHER MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES

The Tempo window

Select Tempo Window from the Display menu. This window is used to set the
playing speed (tempo). For basic use, ignore all gadgets except the Tempo
slider. The higher the Tempo slider value, the quicker the speed. For more
advanced use, read on.

There are two tempo modes: SPD (the default) and BPM. Let's look at SPD mode
first. The Tempo and TPL sliders are used in this mode. Each slider alters
the tempo in a different way, and to fully understand the difference I'll
need to explain a few technical aspects. Don't worry, it's all quite simple
really!

To keep 'in time', OctaMED responds to regular ticks that come from one of
the Amiga's clocks. The tempo depends on two factors relating to these
ticks:

   1) The time between each tick (Tempo slider)
   2) The number of ticks per Tracker editor line (TPL slider)

So each Tracker editor line is divided into ticks. The TPL slider controls
the number of ticks per line. With TPL set to 3, two typical consecutive
lines look like this:

                                   Line no.  Tick no.   Action
                               /     000        1       Play note C-3
                              /      000        2
  000 C-3 10000 --\ ZOOMED --\       000        3
  001 D-2 10000 --/ ZOOMED --/       001        1       Play note D-2
                              \      001        2
                               \     001        3

So notes are played on the first tick of each line. The other ticks are used
for effects such as pitch sliding (although using certain player commands,
notes can also be played on the other ticks).

The Tempo slider controls the length of time between each tick. The higher
the value, the shorter the length of time therefore the faster the tempo.
For normal 4 channel or MIDI songs, Tempo slider values 11 - 240 should be
used (ignore values 1 - 10). The TPL slider can be values 1 - 32.
The higher the value, the slower the tempo. By default the sliders are set
to 33 and 6 respectively.

In BPM mode, the Tempo slider controls the number of beats per minute (just
like a metronome). For example, a value of 60 is one beat per second. The
LPB slider controls the number of lines per beat. For example, 8 (the
default) means eight lines are considered as one beat. In this mode, it's
best to leave the TPL slider at 6, otherwise the timing won't be accurate.


5 to 8-channel mode in brief

When composing using OctaMED, you may find that the Amiga's ability to play
a maximum of four samples at once (using its four sound channels) is a bit
limiting. Luckily, OctaMED allows you to add up to four extra tracks,
extending the maximum number of simultaneous samples to five, six, seven or
eight; and this feature is called 5 to 8-channel mode.

Firstly, increase the number of tracks to 5, 6, 7 or 8, using the Block
Properties window. Next, select Set Options from the Song
menu. On the left of this window, click on the appropriate channel mode
button. Click Yes and Halve in the requesters, then close the window. Voilà!

Unfortunately, you'll notice some side effects pretty quickly. The volume of
all samples halves to minimize distortion. There's a different method of
setting the tempo: in SPD mode, you can only use levels 1 -
10. And the quality decreases, but try selecting High Quality Mode in the
Song Options window (if you own an A500 or A600, this will only work in 5 or
6 channel mode).

For more details, press Help, click on Playback in the Features Guide and
follow the links to 5 to 8-channel mode.


Mix mode

New to the Soundstudio is an incredible new playing mode: Mix. This is an
alternative to 4-channel and 5 to 8-channel mode, and is best suited to
reasonably fast processors (of the A1200's speed, or faster).

Again usually with a loss of sound quality, you can play up to 64 notes at
once, although it's unlikely that you'll ever need this amount! The sound
can be sent through a number of "output devices": Your Amiga - in normal
8-bit or enhanced 14-bit mode, three different 16-bit sound boards, and even
straight to disk as an 8-bit or 16-bit sample.

One great feature of the Mix mode is its ability to add playing effects to your
music. You'll want to play with Echo and Cross Echo straight away! For more
details on the window, see the section for OctaMED V6 upgraders.

ARexx

ARexx support was the most major addition to the previous version of
OctaMED. ARexx is one of these 'buzzwords' used by so many Amiga people,
but many users seem to be in the dark as to what it actually is. Well, in
relation to OctaMED, it is both a way of adding new features to the program,
and a time-saving alternative to mundane tasks.

You use ARexx by typing in an ARexx script, a set of commands (instructions)
that ARexx is to carry out. If ARexx were to control a toaster, some of
these commands could be 'start toasting', 'cancel toasting', 'set timer' and
so on. But we'll be using ARexx to control OctaMED, so commands are more
likely to be 'play song', 'open the Font window', or 'mark a range over
track 3'.

Well, it would be nice if commands were so informal, but computers currently
find informal English pretty difficult to understand! So commands are
actually a lot more precise. For example, the instruction 'set instrument
04's default volume to 32' would in fact be performed by the two commands
IN_SELECT 4 and IN_SETVOLUME 32.

OctaMED's ARexx commands are not only used in scripts. Using the Keyboard
Shortcuts window (Settings menu), you can assign any key combination to
perform any OctaMED ARexx command! This gives you substantial control over
the keyboard in OctaMED. As well as executing OctaMED ARexx commands,
keyboard shortcuts can be defined to perform an ARexx script, send an ARexx
command to another program, or load and run a program.

A similar facility is now available for player commands. Commands 2D01 to
2DFF can be set up to execute different ARexx commands, as well as the other
facilities described above. So you can control OctaMED - and even other
programs - from precise points within your song. This opens up huge
multimedia possibilities!

For more information, press Help and select ARexx from the Features Guide.
A complete list of OctaMED's ARexx commands is given in Appendices D and E.

Multi-modules

Multi-modules are projects containing more than one song. Each song
shares the same set of instruments. This allows you, for example, to
compose different songs for each level of a game, without having to
load or keep the same instrument in memory more than once.

Multi-modules are also very useful when editing just one song, as you can
treat one song in the multi-module as 'workspace', much like Deluxe Paint's
spare screen option. You may design and compose in one song, then cut and
paste to another.

Adding and deleting songs

Find the Sg 01/01 < > gadgets on the left of the Information window.

Sg opens the Song Selector window, which allows you to add and delete songs
in a multi-module, and to choose the current song.

The two numbers (currently both 01) represent the current song and the total
number of songs in the multi-module. < selects the previous song. If clicked
while holding a Shift key, it deletes the last song in memory after
displaying a requester. > selects the next song. If the current song is the
last song, it adds a new song after displaying a requester.

Clicking < and > while holding Shift is the same as selecting Delete Last
and Add New respectively from the Song menu.

Instrument remapping

OctaMED can automatically remap instruments while loading. This feature can
save you a lot of work. If you have one or more songs already in memory,
and you load an additional song, a Remap instruments? requester will
appear.

If you click No: all previous instruments in the entire multi-module will be
lost and the instruments of the new song will be loaded. This could be used,
for example, to use the new, different instruments with the other songs in
the module.

But if you click Yes:

    1) The new song's instruments will be loaded into empty places, so that
       instruments already in memory are preserved;

    2) The new song's notes' instrument numbers will be redirected
       (remapped) so that they point to the new instrument positions.

By clicking Yes, several sets of instruments used in several songs can be
contributed to one large overall set of instruments. This is the option
you'll most often (if not always) choose.

In the Save Options window: the right-hand cycle gadget selects whether to
save the whole multi-module (default) or only the current song.


Some other smaller features

Select Set Volumes from the Song menu. This window full of sliders is used
to set each track's volume and an overall (master) volume. The 'relative'
part in the window's title bar refers to the relativity between the track
and master volumes. For example, setting both master and a track volume to
half (32) will produce an actual track volume of a quarter (16).

Select Set Options from the Song menu. Set the current song's name
(different for each song in a multi-module) by typing it into the Name text
box. The name will appear on the screen's title bar.

Many different settings (preferences) can be saved using Save Settings in
the Settings menu. For a full list of saved settings, press Help, select
Appendices from the Quick Guide and follow links to the settings file.

In your country, if the note between A# and C is H instead of B (for example
Germany and Finland), select Miscellaneous from the Settings menu, then
click H -> B in the window and save settings.

That's all, as mentioned at the start of this introduction, press the
Help key to reveal instructions for almost any part of the program.

                          APPENDIX A: Player commands


1) Both the command type and the command level are in HEXADECIMAL. (Please
   read through @{" Appendix F  " link "AppF" 0} before continuing, just to make sure...)

2) These abbreviations are used:

   Level 1 = 1st command level digit     Level 2 = 2nd command level digit


A.1 Normal commands

Command 00: ARPEGGIO

This command changes the pitch of the note quickly (once every tick,
It's usually used to create special effects. If you've ever
listened to Commodore 64 music, you must have heard arpeggios!

The pitch is changed between three different pitches (1 to 3) during each
note. Level 1 contains the number of halfsteps between pitch 1 and pitch 2,
level 2 the number of halfsteps between pitch 1 and pitch 3.

For example, to create a C major arpeggio:

   Pitch 1:  C-2
   Pitch 2:  E-2 = 4 halfsteps higher than pitch 1
   Pitch 3:  G-2 = 7 halfsteps higher than pitch 1

This produces:  C-2 10047
                --- 00047
                --- 00047 and so on... Note that the command level with a
                          blank note (---) continues the arpeggio.

As with most commands, experimentation often produces the best results. This
effect can sound pretty bad with some instruments but pretty good with
others. Use command level 37 for a minor arpeggio, 57 for a sustained 4th.


Commands 01 and 02: SLIDE PITCH UP and DOWN

These two commands slide the pitch of the current track up or down. They
actually work by changing the period of the note the amount of the command
level every tick. Sounds a bit technical? Dead right! It's best to leave the
donkey work to the automatic slide creator.


Command 03: PORTAMENTO

Again a slide command, and again it's best to use Pitch Slide Type 1 (Edit
menu). The difference between this and commands 01 and 02 is that the latter
replay the note they slide to: command 03 doesn't replay the note. The
command level is the slide speed. Here's an example:

   C-2 50000  <= Note C is played
   E-2 50305  <= This note isn't played! Instead, the slide target note is
   --- 00300     set to E-2 with a slide speed of 5
   --- 00300  <= Level 00 uses the previous speed (5 here)

This example would slide from C-2 to E-2, but the slide stops dead when E-2
is reached (with commands 01 and 02 you can slide beyond the note).


Command 04: VIBRATO

Rapidly slides the pitch up and down (causing a 'wobble'). Level 1 is the
vibrato's speed, level 2 the depth (the length of the pitch slide).

   E-3 4043B  <= Low speed, high depth
   --- 004A1  <= High speed, low depth
   --- 00400  <= Level 00 uses the previous speed and/or depth (A1 here)


Command 05: SLIDE PITCH AND FADE  (Protracker-compatible)

This command combines commands 0300 and 0Dxx. The slide continues at the
last speed entered with command 03, and the command level is the fade speed.

   C-1 10000
   D-3 10303  <= Slide pitch at speed 3
   --- 00300  <= Continue sliding
   --- 00502  <= Continue sliding + fade at speed 2 (see command 0D later)


Command 06: VIBRATO AND FADE  (Protracker-compatible)

Combines commands 0400 and 0Dxx. Again, the vibrato continues at the
previous speed and depth, and the command level is the fade speed.


Command 07: TREMOLO  (Protracker-compatible)

This command is a kind of volume vibrato. Level 1 is the tremolo speed (the
higher the value, the greater the speed), and level 2 is the depth. The
depth must be quite high before you notice the effect (try A - F).


Command 08: HOLD AND DECAY

Sets the hold and decay values for the note (press Help and click Windows
then Instrument Parameters). Level 1 is decay, level 2 is hold.


Command 09: TPL SLIDER

This command sets the TPL slider (the number of ticks per line,
The command level must be $01 - $20 ($ means hexadecimal).


Command 0A: VOLUME SLIDE  (equivalent to 0D: for Tracker compatibility only)

Please use command 0D instead of this.


Command 0B: PLAYING SEQUENCE POSITION JUMP

This command allows you to create songs that have an introduction, which is
only played once, and a main part, which is repeated over and over again.
OctaMED jumps to the entry in the playing sequence given by the command
level. You must, however, remember that level 00 is the first entry, and 01
the second, so e.g. 03 will be the fourth.

   --- 00B06  <= Jump to playing sequence entry 007

Note that when more than one playing sequence is defined (i.e. sections),
the specified entry in the CURRENT playing sequence is jumped to. At
present, no command exists to jump to an entry in the section list.


Command 0C: SET VOLUME

Without doubt the most commonly-used player command. It overrides the
default volume of the instrument  For example,
A-3 40C32 is played with volume 32.

There are 65 volume levels (0 - 64): 0 = silent, 64 = maximum. You may enter
the level in either decimal or hex, depending on the state of the cycle
gadget in the Song Options window.

It's also possible to change the volume of an already played note:

   A-3 40000
   --- 00000
   --- 00C10  <= Change note A-3's volume to 10

In addition, with this command you may actually set the default instrument
volume. The value MUST be in HEX!, and is between 80 and C0: 80 = level $0,
C0 = level $40 (hex). In other words, add 80 to the normal volume in hex.


Command 0D: VOLUME SLIDE

You can increase or decrease volume smoothly with this command. Level 1
increases the volume, level 2 decreases. If both level digits have a value
greater than zero, level 2 is ignored.

   C-2 30C32  <= Sets volume to 32
   --- 00D01  <= Decreases volume slightly
   --- 00D01  <= Decreases volume a little more
   --- 00D20  <= Increases volume back up to 32

For techies only: In this command the volume is changed every tick
So if the TPL tempo slider were 6, a decrease volume value of 1 would
lower the volume by 6. Using 0C commands, the above example would look like
this (except it doesn't sound as smooth):

   C-2 30C32  (volumes are decimal in this example)
   --- 00C26  <= Subtract 6
   --- 00C20  <= Subtract 6
   --- 00C32  <= Add 12


Command 0E: SYNTH JUMP

Only applies to synthetic or hybrid instruments. It is used to trigger a
jump in the waveform sequence. The command level is the line number you
wish to jump to.

   C-4 40000  <= Starts playing the synthetic or hybrid sound
   --- 00000
   --- 00E05  <= Jumps to waveform line number 5


Command 0F: PRIMARY TEMPO / MISCELLANEOUS

Command 0F has many different actions depending on the command level.

* Level 00: causes an immediate jump to the next entry in the playing
  sequence (or to the beginning of the block if you are using Play Block).
  It's actually better to make the block shorter, as it takes less memory,
  so this function mainly exists for Tracker compatibility.

* Levels 01 - F0: changes the Tempo slider. Levels 01 - 0A
  really exist for Tracker compatibility, but you should use command 09
  instead as it's directly compatible (but make sure Tempo = 33).

Commands 0FF1 - 0FFF are reserved for special functions, most of which are
currently in use:

0FF1 makes a single note play twice. Useful for creating fast rhythms. It's
     identical to command 1F03. When the TPL slider is 6:

        C-3 20FF1 is the same as C-3 20000
                                 C-3 20000 with double tempo (i.e. 3)

0FF2 delays the start of a note by half a line (as long as TPL is 6). It's
     identical to command 1F30.

0FF3 works like 0FF1 except the note is played three times! It's identical
     to command 1F02.

0FF4 delays the note one-third of a line.

0FF5 delays the note two-thirds of a line. Commands 0FF4 and 0FF5 can be
     used, for example, to create triplets:

        C-2 10000  Here, the three notes will be evenly spaced throughout
        D-2 10FF4  the four lines (they'll have a length of one-and-a-third
        E-2 10FF5  lines each)
        --- 00000

     0FF4+5 only work accurately when TPL is divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9 etc.).

0FF8 turns the low-pass filter off.

0FF9 turns the low-pass filter on. Commands 0FF8 and 0FF9 work like the
     Audio Filter Active check box in the Song Options window.

0FFD (not MIDI) causes the pitch of the previous note to be set to the new
     note, but it's not replayed.

        C-1 20000  <= Play note
        --- 00000
        D#2 20FFD  <= Don't replay the note, just set the pitch to D#2

     This is especially useful in playing long samples or samples with a
     loop set (such as strings and choirs), as the undesirable "click" that
     you can sometimes hear when playing a new note is eliminated.

0FFE stops the song playing. (When used in 5 - 8-channel mode, the song's
     notes are also stopped). Can be entered by shift-clicking STOP.

0FFF stops the note on the current track. Is almost like 0C00 with Amiga
     samples, but while 0C00 sets the note's volume to zero, 0FFF turns the
     note off completely (there is a subtle difference :-).


Commands 11 and 12: SLIDE PITCH UP and DOWN ONCE  (Protracker cmds E1 / E2)

Whereas commands 01 and 02 change the pitch on every tick, these commands
only change the pitch on the first tick of each line (greater accuracy).


Command 14: PROTRACKER-STYLE VIBRATO

As command 04, except command 14's depth levels produce exactly half the
depth as command 04. Protracker pioneered this more accurate command.


Command 15: SET FINETUNE

Overrides the instrument's default finetune value

Since these are hex numbers, negative numbers must be entered as follows:

       -1 => FF        -3 => FD        -5 => FB        -7 => F9
       -2 => FE        -4 => FC        -6 => FA        -8 => F8

   C#3 21503  <= Finetune +3
   D-2 315F8  <= Finetune -8


Command 16: REPEAT LINES (LOOP)  (Equivalent to Protracker command E6)

This interesting command enables you to set up a repeated section (loop)
within a block.

   004 C-3 11600  <= Command level = 00: mark loop beginning
   005 D#2 10000
   006 --- 11603  <= Command level = 03: repeat this section three times

When the loop has finished, the block continues. You can't nest loops!


Command 18: CUT NOTE  (Equivalent to Protracker command E8)

Almost like hold (command 08), except it sets the volume to zero instead of
actually switching the note off. (Much the same as the difference between
commands 0C00 and 0FFF). The command level must be less than TPL for the
command to function.


Command 19: SAMPLE START OFFSET  (Protracker command 9)

When playing a sample, this command sets the starting byte in steps of 256
bytes (= $100 in hex). Useful for speech samples.

   C-2 11904  <= Play the sample starting at byte $400 = 1024


Commands 1A and 1B: SLIDE VOLUME UP / DOWN ONCE  (Protracker EA / EB)

Whereas command 0D changes the volume on every tick, these commands only
change the volume on the first tick of each line (for greater accuracy).


Command 1D: JUMP TO NEXT PLAYING SEQUENCE ENTRY  (Protracker command D)

"But doesn't command 0F00 jump to the next entry?" Quite right. But with
this command you can specify the line number of the first line to be
played. The line number is (as usual) given in hex.

   --- 01D0A  <= Jump to next playseq entry, and start at line 010 (skip
                 000 - 009)


Command 1E: REPLAY LINE  (Protracker command EE)

Replays the commands (not the notes) in the current line the specified
number of times.

   C-2 11B01 --- 01E3F  <= If instrument 01 had a default volume of 64,
                           these two tracks would fade note C-2 away


Command 1F: NOTE DELAY AND RETRIGGER  (Protracker commands EC and ED)

Gives you accurate control over note playing. You can delay the note any
number of ticks, and initiate fast retrigger. Level 1 = note delay value,
level 2 = retrigger value.

  C-2 11F20  <= Delay 2 ticks  ||  C-2 11F02  <= Retrig every second tick
                               ||
   => tick  0  ---             ||   => tick  0  C-2
            1  ---             ||            1  ---
            2  C-2             ||            2  C-2
            3  ---  etc.       ||            3  ---
                               ||            4  C-2  etc.

Command 0FF1 is equivalent to 1F03, 0FF2 to 1F30, and 0FF3 to 1F02.


A.2 MIDI Commands

Normal commands 0B, 0F, 16, 1D, 1E, and 1F all work identically with MIDI to
Amiga instruments. Commands 15, 18, 19, 1A, and 1B have no effect with MIDI.

Commands 05 and 00: CONTROLLER NUMBER and CONTROLLER VALUE

These two commands allow you to change any MIDI controller (command
$Bx nn vv, where nn = controller number, vv = value).

Firstly, set the controller number you wish to change with command 05.
Then, select the value with command 00. Subsequent uses of command 00 will
affect the controller previously set with command 05. Remember that each
MIDI channel has its own controller number.

If you need to use a controller value of $00, you can't use 00 as a command
level because command 0000 means do nothing. Instead, use level 80.
Acceptable controller numbers are $00 - $7F, and values $01 - $80.

Assuming instrument 03 is set to MIDI channel 1:

   C-2 30000
   --- 00507  <= Controller $07 = volume (according to the MIDI standard)
   D-2 3007F  <= Sets max. volume ($7F). Command $B0 07 7F is sent (this is
   --- 00000     easier to do with command 17)
   F-3 30001  <= Low volume ($01)
   --- 0055C  <= Sets controller $5C (tremolo depth)...
   G-4 30080  <= ...to 0 (note: level $80 = value $00)

For a much simpler way of changing MIDI controllers.

Commands 01 and 02: PITCHBENDER UP / DOWN

These commands "turn" the pitchbender 8 x command level steps up or down on
every tick. Sounds a bit technical? Indeed, but unfortunately automatic
slide making cannot be used. Because the ranges of pitchbenders differ with
various MIDI instruments, you must find the right value by experimenting.

The pitchbender isn't automatically reset when a new note is played. To
reset it, issue the command again with a level of 00.

   C-2 101FF  <= Turns the pitchbender up very quickly...
   --- 00100  <= ...then resets it

Commands 03 and 13: SET PITCHBENDER

With these commands you may set the pitchbender to an exact value, instead
of sliding as with commands 01 and 02. The command level is the pitchbender
value, expressed as a signed hexadecimal digit (aaaarrrgh!!! Better read
@{" Appendix D  " link "AppD" 0} again?!?)

 $00 = center position,   $80 ($-7F) = smallest value,  $7F = largest value

The two commands are identical, except that command 13 can be used when
there's a note next to the command: command 03 cannot.

   C-2 31380  <= Sets pitchbender to maximum value: use cmd 13 beside notes
   --- 0037F  <= Sets pitchbender to minimum value
   --- 00300  <= Resets pitchbender

Command 04: MODULATION WHEEL

Affects the current MIDI channel's modulation wheel. (Modulation is usually
vibrato). The command level can be $00 - $7F: $00 = no modulation, $7F =
maximum. All notes played using the current MIDI channel will be affected.

Command 08: SET HOLD ONLY

Just to underline that decay can't be used with MIDI instruments. (This is
because with MIDI, the volume of an already played note can't be altered).
However, the whole command level can be used to set hold. So hold values
above 15 are possible (right up to 255).

Command 0A: POLYPHONIC AFTERTOUCH

Changes the polyphonic aftertouch of the most recent note. (Aftertouch is
squeezing a key down harder than when it was initially pressed). With this
command, each note has an individual amount of pressure (compare with
command 0D). The level should be $00 - $7F.

Command 0C: SET VOLUME

Again, just to underline that the volume of a note can't be changed after
it has been played (as it can with Amiga samples). The normal Amiga sample
volume range of 0 - 64 is converted to the MIDI range of 0 - 127.

Command 0D: CHANNEL AFTERTOUCH

Sends a channel aftertouch message to the most recently used channel. As
with command 04, all notes using the most recent channel are given the same
pressure (compare with command 0A). The level should be $00 - $7F.

Command 0E: PAN CONTROL

Controls the stereo location of the note. As usual, use levels $00 - $7F.

         left        mid        right
          |           |           |
Level:   00          3F          7F

Command 0F: MISCELLANEOUS
  
0FF7 suspends play until all MIDI messages have been sent. This is mainly
for use at the start of songs, when you may need to send initialization
messages to your MIDI device.

0FFA sends the MIDI hold pedal on command. 0FFB sends the MIDI hold pedal
off command.

Command 10: SEND MIDI MESSAGE

Sends a MIDI message, created using the MIDI message editor. The command
level is the message number. Note that with this command the first message
is number 0, so you need to subtract one to convert the message number from
the message editor for use with this command.

   C-2 11003  <= Sends the fourth message, then plays note C-2 (messages are
                 always sent before notes)

MIDI timing pulses are sent immediately even if a message is being sent.

Command 17: CHANGE VOLUME CONTROLLER

Changes the volume controller value for the most recently used channel.

   --- 00507  <= is the same as =>  --- 0173A
   --- 0003A

Command 1C: CHANGE MIDI PRESET

Changes the current instrument's MIDI preset number. As with all commands
which modify song settings, you should be very careful when using this
command in multi-modules.

Commands 31 to 3F: SET MIDI CONTROLLER

See part 13.1 for more details.


A.3 Mix mode commands

These commands can only be used in Mix mode. See part 10 for more details.

Command 20: REVERSE SAMPLE / RELATIVE SAMPLE OFFSET

With command level $00, the sample is reversed. With other levels, it
changes the sample offset, just like command 19, except the command level is
the new offset relative to the current sample position being played. For this
reason, it should be used after a note. (See part 10.7.2.)

Commands 21 and 22: SLIDE PITCH UP / DOWN (FIXED RATE)

These commands work exactly like 01 and 02, except that each command level
value produces the same slide speed, regardless of the pitch of the note.
With 01 and 02, lower pitches mean slower slide speeds if equivalent command
levels are used.

Command 2E: SET TRACK PANNING

Allows track panning to be changed during play. The track on which the
player command appears is the track affected. The command level is in signed
hex: $F0 to $10 = -16 to 16 decimal.

Command 2F: SET ECHO DEPTH / STEREO SEPARATION

Use command levels $E1 to $E6 to set echo depth. $E1 is 50.0%, $E2 is 25.0%
and so on down to $E6 (1.44%).

The signed command level $DC to $D4 sets stereo separation. The following
command levels give the respective stereo separation:

  Command level     | DC | DD | DE | DF | D0 | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4
 -------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----
  Stereo separation | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4

APPENDIX F: Hexadecimal values

F.1 Introduction

Hexadecimal (or 'hex' for short) is basically just a different way of
representing numbers. It is more convenient for the computer because of the
way it works, and allows the user to specify a greater range of numbers
using the same amount of digits.

Hex values are used in the player commands, MIDI message editor, and the
synth editor, so they're quite important in OctaMED.

In the usual decimal system, a digit can be ten different values: 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.

In the hex system, however, a digit may have sixteen values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E or F. The decimal numbers 10 - 15 are
represented by the letters A to F:

  Decimal 10 = Hex A;  11 = B;  12 = C;  13 = D;  14 = E;  15 = F

With two digits in a number, the decimal system can represent 10 x 10 = 100
different values. The hex system, however, can represent 16 x 16 = 256
values: well over twice the amount of the decimal system. (The lowest hex
number is 00 = zero, and the highest is FF = 255 decimal).


F.2 Converting between the two systems

So although it feels strange to work in at first, it has its advantages. In
a two digit hex number (e.g. 8A), the first digit represents multiples of
16. So, to convert a two-digit hex number to decimal:

        Decimal number = (Hex digit 1) x 16 + (hex digit 2)

And to convert decimal to hex, divide the decimal number by 16. The
quotient is hex digit 1, the remainder is hex digit 2.

e.g. 1) Hex 8A -> decimal:   Hex digit 1 = 8, hex digit 2 = A (10).
                             Decimal number = (8 x 16) + 10 = 138.

     2) Decimal 200 -> hex:  200 ÷ 16 = 12 remainder 8.
                             Hex digit 1 = C (12), hex digit 2 = 8.
                             So hex number = C8.

Hex numbers are sometimes distinguished from decimal numbers by preceding
hex with a $ sign. For example: $C8, $FF.


F.3 Signed hexadecimal

There is a further complication! With the advent of OctaMED Soundstudio, a
significant number of player commands now have "signed" hex command levels.

The sign of a number denotes whether the number is positive or negative:
that is, the + and - signs. In hexadecimal, however, there are no - signs.
So, negative numbers are represented by positive numbers (it will become
clearer!).

In signed hex, the numbers $00 - $7F are positive as usual: they represent
the decimal numbers 0 - 127. However, the numbers $80 - $FF represent the
decimal values -1 to -128:

  Decimal   -1 = Hex $FF;   -2 = $FE;   -3 = $FD etc.
  Decimal  -16 = Hex $F0;  -17 = $EF;  -18 = $EE etc.
  Decimal -126 = Hex $82; -127 = $81; -128 = $80

So to convert negative decimal numbers to signed hex numbers, first add 256
to the number, then convert to hex as above.

e.g. Decimal -67 -> signed hex:  -67 + 256 = 189.
                                 189 ÷ 16 = 11 remainder 13.
                                 Hex digit 1 = 11 (B), hex digit 2 = 13 (D)
                                 So signed hex number = $BD.

It's important to realise that a signed hex number looks exactly the same as
a normal hex number. There is no way of telling whether $FC is 252 decimal
or -4 decimal just by looking at it; it is the context that tells you
whether the number is normal or signed. For example, in the context of
player command 15 (set finetune), $FC would be interpreted as -4. In the
context of player command 01 (slide pitch up), it would be 252.

Hex numbers will crop up in many areas of computing, so if you've never
worked with them before, it's a good idea to get used to them!
