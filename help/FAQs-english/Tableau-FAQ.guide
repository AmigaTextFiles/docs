 @{B}How to connect a graphics tablet to the Amiga?@{UB}

 In general graphics tablets are connected to the serial port of the
 Amiga. As this port is also used by modems you might only be able to use
 one of those devices or you have to buy an interface card (e.g.
 HpyerCOM).
 
 The serial port has a 25-pin connector, the graphics tablet has a 9-pin
 connector. So you will need an adapter that you can buy in a common
 computer store.

 You need to set the protocol to RTS/CTS, 8 data bits, no parity and 1
 stop bit.

@NODE frage78 "Tableau-FAQ"

 @{B}Which tablet drivers support pressure sensitivity with AE?@{UB}

 ArtEffect uses the pressure data send by a Kickstart 2.x compatible way
 (in an intuimessage). Most existing tablet drivers do not support this
 NORMAL way, they instead are providing their on mechanism to receive
 pressure data. But we dont want to implement the private pressure
 mechanism of several tablet drivers. So by now Tablau from ESCENA is the
 only one that support this with ArtEffect.

@NODE frage79 "Tableau-FAQ"

 @{B}At start of Tableau you get the error message 'Can't open serial.device -@{UB}
 @{B}opening in UNLOCK-Mode'.@{UB}

 This normally means that your serial port is already used by another
 application or you tried to run Tableau twice or a missing port handler.
 Please note that the name has to be in small letters.
