 @{B}Voyager doesn´t start@{UB}

 Install a newer version of it

 @{B}MicroDot-II: After the installation of MicroDot-II 1.3 I have no field@{UB}
 @{B}for the sender of the message.@{UB}

 This problem is cured by simply rebooting the Amiga. It is due to an old
 version of textinput.mcc laying around in memory. When there is no
 program loaded that uses 'textinput.mcc' a 'avail flush' in a shell
 window may also help.

 @{B}X-Arc: I have problems with X-Arc.@{UB}

 X-Arc requires SetPatch 43.6 or later.
 You can find it on http://www.amiga.de in the file area.
 
 Some users have problems using X-Arc when the OxyronPatcher is activated.

 @{B}Creating a connection using the Login-script doesn't always function.@{UB}
 @{B}(Pause in the Login-script.)@{UB}

 We have been informed, that inserting a Pause before dialing in the login
 script makes it possible to connect, if this didn't work before:
 
 Pause '1'
 Dial
 GoOnline
 
 Many thanks for this tip to Christian Robl.

@NODE frage58 "NetConnect-FAQ"

 @{B}I have problems with Genesis.@{UB}

 Should you encounter problems with Genesis, please send us the files
 Genesis.log and appp.log. To do this, you would first have to activate
 the Debug-mode under 'Preferences/Options/Misc'.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage59 "NetConnect-FAQ"

 @{B}Problems with Genesis: I get the error message: 'Host not found'!@{UB}

 When Genesis can create a connection, but then gives the error 'host not
 found', this is due to the fact that the ISP doesn't send the IP in a
 standard way. The problem is solved as of NetConnect 2.2, or Genesis
 1.0.4.

@NODE frage61 "NetConnect-FAQ"

 @{B}I get the error message 'PAP Authentification failed'.@{UB}

 This error occurs, when a wrong username or a wrong password is used.

@NODE frage62 "NetConnect-FAQ"

 @{B}The automatic DNS-recognation doesn't function.@{UB}

 With some internet-accesses the DNS-input is not recognised automatically
 by the Genesis-Wizard. If this is the case, you will have to enter the
 IP-address by hand.
 
 If you don't have a DNS-IP-number at hand, please contact your internet
 provider, and ask for it. You then proceed as follows to change the
 settings:
 
 1. Start Genesis (the main program, not the Wizard).
 2. Call the menu: 'Settings/Genesis'.
 3. Choose 'Interfaces'.
 4. Choose the settings you want to set. Most of the times there will only
 be one to choose.
 5. Choose 'Edit' and then 'Resolv'.
 6. Under 'Domain Name Servers' click 'Add'.
 7. Enter the DNS-IP-Address and press <Return>.
 8. Leave the preferences editor with <Okay>.
 9. Call the provider again.

@NODE frage63 "NetConnect-FAQ"

 @{B}It doesn't work right.@{UB}

 When not everything functions right from the start, please repeat the
 final step 'Building a connection with Genesis Wizard'. You will find
 'Genesis Wizard' in the drawer 'NetConnect2' on your harddrive, in the
 subdirectory 'AmiTCP'. It is important to turn your modem off and then on
 again after such a failure, to delete false settings!
 
 Should the connecting information, the password or the phonenumber of
 your internet provider not be clear, please contact your provider (for
 instance UK-Online), and request the information.
 
 Should it still fail, you can contact us directly:
 mailto:netconnect-support@haage-partner.com
