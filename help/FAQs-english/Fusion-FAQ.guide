@NODE frage93 "Fusion-FAQ"

 @{B}I can't install MacOS 8.0 or higher.@{UB}

 MacOS 8.0 or higher needs 1MB ROMs. 256K & 512K ROMs are not supported by
 this version of the MacOS. MacOS 8.0 also needs 8MB RAM to boot.
 
 MacOS 8.5 or higher needs a computer with PowerPC to run. Fusion doesn't
 support emulating a Mac on PowerPC yet.

@NODE frage94 "Fusion-FAQ"

 @{B}I can't start the emulation under MacOS 7.6.@{UB}

 MacOS 7.6 needs 512K or 1MB ROMs. 256K ROMs don't work with this version
 of the operating system.

@NODE frage95 "Fusion-FAQ"

 @{B}I can't install MacOS.@{UB}

 For FUSION you need a Mac System that is not made for a specific Mac
 computer. The DISK TOOLS disc that is delivered with a Mac is usually not
 installable on the Fusion. You need a upgrage or version that runs on
 every Mac.

 @{B}I have problem with the Picasso direct graphics driver. Shortly after@{UB}
 @{B}starting the emulation the screens gets white and nothing happens.@{UB}

 A tool which redirects screens - like NewMode or ModePro for example -
 could be responsible for this problem. Switch it off or tell it not to
 redirect any screens.
 
 Thanks to Andreas Volkmann for this tip!

@NODE frage97 "Fusion-FAQ"

 @{B}I have problems installing MacOS 8.0.@{UB}

 The newer versions of the MacOS 8.0 CD are made for PowerPC Macs. To get
 them to work with a 68k Mac or Amiga you need a special boot disc that
 you can get by a Mac dealer.
