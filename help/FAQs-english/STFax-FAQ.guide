@NODE frage12 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}When i use STFax with a Frontdoor, STFax answer the Fax not in the right@{UB}
 @{B}Baudrate, when the receive Command is given.@{UB}

 STFax should be running all the time: set it to open the serial port in
 Shared mode (Prefs/Modem) and turn AutoAnswer off (Prefs/Misc). Set
 Frontdoor to use the serial in shared mode too. When FD detects an
 incoming fax it should call the ReceiveFax.stfax script (or a similar
 one) passing the device and baud rate that STFax should open.
 This way it should work, for more information you can also try asking in
 the mailing list: there were some people using STFax along with trapdoor.

 @{B}ST-Fax doesn´t start!@{UB}

 Download the vaportoolkit.library from the Vapor Server (www.vapor.com)

@NODE frage18 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}I can´t connect with my modem!@{UB}

 Change the settings to 9600 baud and to Class 1.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage19 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}Where can I find the settings for Elsa modems?@{UB}

 Choose the TKR-Tristar Plus modem settings.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage27 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}How can I can I directly send a fax using AmigaWriter and STFax?@{UB}

 Make sure, that the STFax printer driver 'STFaxPrt' is installed
 correctly in 'DEVS:Printers'.
 
 Without TurboPrint: Simply select the 'STFaxPrt' printer driver in
 AmigaWriter. The document will be sent to STFax via the STFax printer
 driver. After 'printing' STFax will ask you for a name for the new Fax
 and offer you to send it out afterwards.
 
 With TurboPrint: Start the TurboPrint preferences tool. Define a new
 printer with 'New...'. Set the 'Driver type' to 'Workbench' and select
 'STFaxPrt' from the list. Further settings shouldn't be necessary.
 
 Everytime you want to send a fax then, you have to make sure that the
 driver 'STFaxPrt' is selected in TurboPrint. When TurboPrint is running,
 you can not select the printer driver from within AmigaWriter.
 Unfortunately the gadget to select the driver in AmigaWriter isn't
 ghosted yet.
 
 When it doesn't work try to remove 'TurboSpool'. We had some crashes with
 'STFaxPrt' and 'TurboSpool' (from TurboPrint 6.02).
 
 Tip: When you want to send faxes in fine resolution make sure to select a
 high printer density in AmigaWriter. This will double the vertical
 resolution.

@NODE frage80 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}Which modems are supported?@{UB}

 US Robotics, ZyXEL, Dynalink, ELSA, all Rockwell based modems. STFax does
 not support ISDN modems and cards yet.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage81 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}How do I get the voice and fax messages into STFax when they were@{UB}
 @{B}received in off-line mode?@{UB}

 STFax collects them automatically when you start it and there are
 messages/faxes in the modem.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage82 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}How to use USR Message Pro/Plus with STFax?@{UB}

 You have to set it to accept faxes in the Independent Mode settings of
 STFax. (You need that modem to see that menu).

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage83 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}During installation it looks for 'MUI_Install'!@{UB}

 STFax needs some files from the second disk. This one is called
 'MUI_Install', so please insert the second disk when this message appears.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage84 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}How to get TurboPrint to automatically handle faxes and normal printing?@{UB}

 In the Hooks section of the Preferences there are the two gadgets 'Prt
 Driver On' and 'Prt Driver Off': in the 'On' one you can enter the
 command to switch to STFaxPrt (perhaps something like
 turboprint:turboprefs STFaxPrt). In the 'Off' gadget you need to enter
 the command to revert to the real printer driver.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage85 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}How to do fax polling?@{UB}

 It works only with Class 2 modems which support that feature. Just select
 'Poll...' from the Fax menu and enter the number of the fax polling
 service. STFax will dial and retrieve the documents awaiting for the
 download.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage86 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}What's the matter when STFax does not start?@{UB}

 You certainly did not enter the correct serial number. Please reinstall
 STFax and enter the correct number.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage87 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}The Elsa Microlink doesn't answer a call, even though it is set to be an@{UB}
 @{B}answering machine?@{UB}

 The modem doesn't answer the call if 'Shared' is activated. You can
 change this setting in 'Preferences/Settings/Modem'.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage88 "STFax-FAQ"

 @{B}How to receive a fax?@{UB}

 The automatic faxreceiving is activated in the menu
 'Preferences/Settings/Misc' with 'Auto Answer'. You can also do this by
 hand: If the requester 'Incoming call' is opened, click on 'Freespeach
 mode'. Now a second requester will appear called 'Answering', with the
 options 'Hang up' and 'Receive fax'.
