@NODE frage26 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}Problems with installation of X-DVE or VideoFX?@{UB}

 When you get a message of a missing library or missing components after
 installation of X-DVE or VideoFX this is because your CDROM driver does
 not support RockRidge mode. Then e.g. x-dve.library is named as
 x_dve.library and will not be found by the program.
 
 User of later version of AsimCDFS have to set the options 'Identify RR
 vol?' and 'Mount RR first?' at 'Rock Ridge Extensions'.
 
 Users of older AsimCDFS have to reinstall the software because this
 option can only be set during installation.

 @{B}X-DVE: Were do I get the operator for XFA animations for MovieShop?@{UB}

 Registered users of X-DVE can request in the support area on our homepage.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage65 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}FM: I get the error message 'Open screen failed'!@{UB}

 This happens when you try to load an AGA texture on a non-AGA Amiga. You
 can convert it to a 256 color IFF ILBM picture before loading it into FM.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage66 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}FM: How can I make animated fonts?@{UB}

 You can give the font an anim-brush as texture for the front or the
 border. You can save this animated font (in fact only a string) as anim5
 or gif-anim. This function was implemented with ARexx-Scripts.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage67 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: There is only a blue screen when playing an animation!@{UB}

 Playing an animation always starts with a blue screen. Please click the
 left mouse button to start the animation (if any).

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage68 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: Can I set the width and height of an animation?@{UB}

 You can set the height in the resolution requester (close with return).
 Unfortunately, you can not change the width. Here you are restricted to
 704 or 768 Pixel (Bug!).

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage69 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: How can I center objects on the screen?@{UB}

 With the key 'X' you can center on the X-axis. With the key 'Y' you can
 center on the Y-axis.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage70 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: Why doesn't it recognize the PPC processor?@{UB}

 It is next to impossible to detect the PPC processor safely. Therefore
 X-DVE only shows the 680X0 processor.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage71 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: Why does it crash after I installed WarpUP?@{UB}

 You may have installed WarpUP without having a PPC actually. In this case
 you should remove WarpUP or deactive it. To deactive it simply start the
 installation program again. Specify that you don't want to use a PPC in
 one of the first questions.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage72 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: I get the error message 'Can't open x-dve.library.'!@{UB}

 On some CD-ROM-filesystems the name of the file 'x-dve.library' (maybe
 also from other files) will be converted to 'x_dve.library' while
 installing X-DVE on harddisk. In this case just rename the file. After
 this it should work.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage73 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}X-DVE: Bitmaps can lot be loaded or Alpha effects not found.@{UB}

 When using the original CDROM filesystem of AmigaOS 3.1 all filenames
 will be in capital letters when they are copied to your hard disk. Then
 all loaders and savers will not work. Please open the appropriate drawers
 and rename all files to small letters or install a shareware or
 commercial file system.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage74 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}Do I need a new registration code after a reorganization or validation of@{UB}
 @{B}my hard disk?@{UB}

 No, only after a installation on a new computer or a new hard disk a new
 code is needed.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage75 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}Can I install ClassX products with my code on more computers at the same@{UB}
 @{B}time?@{UB}

 No, the registration code is only for one machine, because you only
 bought a single licence. In special cases you can contact us for a
 special solution.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage76 "Video-FAQ"

 @{B}Are the ClassX-products PPC compatible or is it planned for the future?@{UB}

 X-DVE 3.50 already supports PPC. Possibly the others will follow.
