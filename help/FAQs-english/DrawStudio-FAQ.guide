@NODE frage99 "DrawStudio-FAQ"

 @{B}I can't load or save bitmaps!@{UB}

 When using the original CDROM filesystem of AmigaOS 3.1 all filenames
 will be in capital letters when copying DS to your hard disk. Then all
 loaders and savers will not work.
 
 Please open the drawers 'DrawStudio/Module/Bitmap' and 'Load' and rename
 all files to lowercase or use another CD-ROM filesystem - like CacheCDFS
 or AmiCDFS (from AmiNet) for example - to install DrawStudio.

@NODE frage100 "DrawStudio-FAQ"

 @{B}How do I create outline text?@{UB}

 To create outline text, convert the text to a bezier and then give it a
 line weight and no fill. If someone wants to do that quickly, then
 perhaps he can write an ARexx script for this.

@NODE frage101 "DrawStudio-FAQ"

 @{B}Does the PostScript output of DrawStudio support transparency?@{UB}

 The PostScript output of DS does not support transparency, so one will
 have to convert this object to a bitmap before exporting it as PostScript.
