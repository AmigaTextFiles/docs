 @{B}I have some strange problems while using the spraycan with the@{UB}
 @{B}pre-defined brushes (size 3 and larger). When I`m drawing a line it`s@{UB}
 @{B}always breaked in square parts like the sample I included. Has anyone an@{UB}
 @{B}idea what`s the problem?@{UB}

 Try to recreate the brush (e.g. by changing its size clicking render
 brush and changing it back to 3 and again click render brush.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage20 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why crashes ArtEffect 1.5 that often and why do I have wrong menues?@{UB}

 This is because ArtEffect 1.5 uses BGUI-Library. Newer versions of this
 library are not compatible with the old one. So you must install the one
 that comes with ArtEffect 1.5 to get it to run correctly.
 

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage22 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Problems with screen garbage?@{UB}

 Users of Picasso96 video drivers might have problems with video refresh
 when using ArtEffect 3. Then you should download the latest 'rtg.library'
 from the Picasso96 homepage.
  

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage28 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}I get the error message 'Unable to compile script. Error in line 433.'@{UB}
 @{B}when I try to install ArtEffect!@{UB}

 The installer you use is too old. Please copy the installer from the
 'C'-directory of the original ArtEffect disk to your 'C:'-directory. Then
 the installer script should work again.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage110 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why does ArtEffect gets slower and slower?@{UB}

 If ArtEffect is getting slower and slower while working on a picture
 please have a look at the Undo levels. Please set the value to 2 - 5,
 because 'unlimited undo' might make the system slow.
 
 If it is still to slow, please set the Undo level to 1. In some cases it
 is better to switch off 'Async I/O' on 'VMem' settings.
 
 If the VMEM/temp file is large, and your harddrive is fragmented, it can
 happen that booting AE takes a very long time. In this case you should
 reorganize your harddrive or choose a partition on your harddrive with
 enough space on it.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage111 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why doesn't ArtEffect start?@{UB}

 Maybe your settings are opening a screenmode your monitor can not display
 (because you are using an VGA monitor) or something like this. In that
 case you can delete the file 'program2.cfg' in the arteffect:settings
 drawer. You can also delete all files of this drawer to set all settings
 to its defaults.
 
 When ArtEffect stops working during initialisation of the PlugIns (the
 start picture is still open) then the last loaded PlugIn does not work
 with your version of ArtEffect. Please delete it in this case. You will
 find it in the drawer 'ArtEffect:plugins2'.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage112 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why do I get a black window after an operation?@{UB}

 The reason is a lack of memory. AE tries to avoid this, but in some cases
 it needs more memory than it expected. ArtEffect needs its memory in one
 block, so fragmentation could also be a reason. Rebooting your Amiga
 would help in that case.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage113 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why do I get a black picture when I loaded a picture?@{UB}

 One reason for this effect is that you do not have enought memory for
 loading that picture. ArtEffect needs its memory in one block, so
 fragmentation could be a reason. Rebooting your Amiga would help in that
 case.
 
 Another reason is that some TIF pictures types (e.g. CMYK TIF) can not be
 loaded by the internal ArtEffect loader. In that case you can either use
 the optional SuperView loaders or datatypes. To activate this you must
 remove the TIF loader of ArtEffect, because it is used first. The file is
 called TIF.pss and it is located at arteffect:plugins2.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage114 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why am I getting an 'Out of memory' during loading, although I have a lot@{UB}
 @{B}of memory.@{UB}

 ArtEffect needs a lot of memory. It actually need 2-3 times the RAM of
 the pictures. There is also the VMem option 'max. size' which will take
 away memory to use for caching. Maybe this value is set to high. You can
 use a value of 500KB for both memory settings if you do not have
 that much memory.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage115 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why do I need VMem when I have so much 'real' RAM?@{UB}

 ArtEffects needs the VMem for internal operations. It is recommanded to
 set it to a minimum of 32 MB.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage116 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}The cloner does not work well. It always uses the foreground color.@{UB}

 Please select another mode eg. 'impressionist' and then foregrond again.
 This is an error in AE.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage117 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Which are the values for Tableau PRO for bigger Wacom tablets?@{UB}

 XSIZE=5500
 YSIZE=4125
 XOFFSET=200
 YOFFSET=700
 
 (Thanks to Asha DeVelder)

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage119 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Which tablet drivers support pressure sensitivity with AE?@{UB}

 ArtEffect uses the pressure data send by a Kickstart 2.x compatible way
 (in an intuimessage). Most existing tablet drivers do not support this
 NORMAL way, they instead are providing their own mechanism to receive
 pressure data. But we don't want to implement the private pressure
 mechanism of several tablet drivers. So for now Tablau from ESCENA is the
 only one that support this with ArtEffect.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage120 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}How can one make ArtEffect 1.5 work together with TurboPrint 6 or later?@{UB}

 Unfortunately TurboPrint changes the file name of the main program with
 every release. This makes it very difficult to support new version, but
 we implemented an env variable (which is located in the file
 envarc:ArtEffect/TurboPrint) where you can enter the name of the
 TurboPrint main program (e.g. GraphicsPublisher).

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage121 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}How do I use the left AMIGA key?        @{UB}

 ArtEffect 2 uses the left AMIGA key for special functions. Normally this
 key is used for screen dragging. To be able to use this key in ArtEffect
 you have to change the preferences with <IControl>.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage122 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}I can't load some (scalable Compugraphic-) fonts?@{UB}

 If you don't get some fonts to work you should check if you
 'bullet.library' is installed correctly.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage123 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}I get the error message 'can not get a system ressource'.@{UB}

 This happens when you try to run ArtEffect on a screen with 8 or less
 colors, eg. Workbench.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage124 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}I get the error message 'Can't proceed with new setting'. What does it@{UB}
 @{B}mean?@{UB}

 This problem appears when you used the ArtEffect 2.6-patch, but did not
 install all the other files, which has to be done manually. Please also
 install all files of libs, plugins2, ArtEffect.wizard and the new
 wizard.library. Please refer to the Readme-file for details.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage125 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why does ArtEffect crash when using some filters?@{UB}

 This seems to happen when running ArtEffect with a 68EC040 CPU (without
 FPU). You can solve this problem: Rename all '**.p2n'-files in the
 directory 'plugins2' to '**.pss' and delete all files with the suffixes
 'p2m' and 'p4s'.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage126 "ArtEffect-FAQ"

 @{B}Why does ArtEffect crash when I switch the color model in the color@{UB}
 @{B}manager?@{UB}

 This only happens on Amiga with AGA chipset which does not have a
 graphics board installed. We don't know why this happens. But you can
 solve the problem by installing the program 'NewWPA8'. You can find it in
 AmiNet in the directory 'util/boot' or on our ftp server.
