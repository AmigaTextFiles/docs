@NODE frage102 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}The English dictionary does not work!@{UB}

 There was a problem with the English dictionary so it did not function at
 all, but this is fixed and there is a new version on our ftp server.
 Download it.

@NODE frage103 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}I have problems to start the demo version. I get a crash with the number@{UB}
 @{B}8000000B.@{UB}

 Most certainly these problems are due to problems with hard disk access.
 This problem didn't show up while betatesting and we couldn't reproduce
 it.
 In most cases the problem could be solved by updating the SetPatch
 command:
 File Area http://www.amiga.de
 We also created a new demo version that should avoid this problem. Please
 load this demo version update from our ftp server.

@NODE frage104 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}The StormScreenManager blocks switching the screenmode of the Workbench@{UB}
 @{B}screen.@{UB}

 There is a new SSM that doesn't have this problem available on our FTP
 server.

@NODE frage105 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}I have problems when starting AmigaWriter 1.2 demo version.@{UB}

 When you notice problems when starting the current demo version 1.2
 please download the archive ExeOnly-1_2-Demo.lha from our ftp.

@NODE frage107 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}How do I create a manual page break?@{UB}

 A manual page break can only happen at the beginning of a paragraph. Set
 the according attribute in the paragraph dialog ('new page'). Admittedly,
 there should be a menu entry for this tough.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage108 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}How can I make smart (up and down) quotes?@{UB}

 Because they are not implemented on the keyboard, AW doesn't have them at
 the moment. We are working on automating this.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage109 "AmigaWriter-FAQ"

 @{B}How to create a 'tilde' for instance on the 'n' and the accent circonflex@{UB}
 @{B}(^)?@{UB}

 Alt-H and then press the 'u'. Standard procedure on the Amiga.
