 @{B}Using PageStream with older TurboPrint-versions causes problems from time@{UB}
 @{B}to time.@{UB}

 TurboPrint provides an indirect PageStream3-support only with version 7
 or higher. To print in truecolor you need a driver for PGS directly. When
 you don't have the newest Epson printer you can find one in the
 distribution.
