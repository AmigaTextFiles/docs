 @{B}How do I get support?@{UB}

 You can get support most easily and quickly using the Internet. To get
 support from us you have to be a registered user. Please do never send
 your serial number over the internet unless you use PGP encrypted mail.

 Developer area at the Amiga Inc. website:

 If you are interested in PowerPC programming, then the special Extended
 Hunk Format (EHF) should be worth a look PPC-EHF-Info ?

@NODE frage31 "StormC-FAQ"

 @{B}Why does the linker generate the error 'Symbol_exit not defined' ('Symbol@{UB}
 @{B}_exit nicht definiert') when you link as a shared library?@{UB}

 The shared library calls the ANSI function 'exit()'. This can happen on
 the one side explicit, if you use the function, or on the other side,
 implicit, through linker libraries, which use this function. The
 'storm.lib' library uses this function when the shared libraries, for
 example the 'utility.library' are automatically opened.
 
 Normally a shared library is not allowed to use the function 'exit()',
 because it can't be exited this way. How do you avoid the call?
 
 In this case you are not allowed to use the automatic opening of shared
 libraries, but you have to open and close the library as described in the
 StormC documentation. To find out, which libraries are used, you should
 first use the function void exit() {} in the shared library. Now the
 library is able to be linked. Use the linker option 'Write map-file'
 ('Map-Datei schreiben'). The linker creates a file with the suffix
 '.map'.
 
 Now search all INIT-functions, which have the base name of a shared
 library (eg. 'INIT_1_UtilityBase'). Now open all these libraries for your
 own. Don't forget to declare also the base variables (eg. 'UtilityBase')
 for your own and to remove the own 'exit()' function from your source
 code.

@NODE frage32 "StormC-FAQ"

 @{B}Why is the 'storm.lib' library so big and why is there - in contrary to@{UB}
 @{B}SAS/C - only one library?@{UB}

 StormC supports a newer object format, which is also used in
 link-libraries. This format is 100% compatible with the older format
 (upwards and downwards), but the Storm linker and the StormC compiler are
 able to support more data models with this format in one object file.
 
 So you don't have to choose and choose the wrong library to the chosen
 compiler options, because the linker chooses the parts out of the big
 'storm.lib' which are necessary for the taken data model. Therefore the
 'storm.lib' library is as big as the three libraries for the different
 data models.
 
 In the future StormC will support different code models and CPU and FPU
 models, so that the 'storm.lib' library and all other libraries will
 allow the automatic creation of optimized program code.

@NODE frage33 "StormC-FAQ"

 @{B}Why are other compilers faster than StormC?@{UB}

 StormC creates clean, optimized code with optimal support of register
 variables and various optimizations. Besides StormC is ready to use the
 PowerPC and therefore doesn't use fast (but susceptible to errors)
 assembler parts. This is why StormC isn't that fast like other compilers
 (eg. MaxonC++). We are however working on a special optimization stage
 for the development phase of a project with even shorter compilation
 times.

@NODE frage34 "StormC-FAQ"

 @{B}How can a program like 'Hello World' be compiled, so that it is really@{UB}
 @{B}small?@{UB}

 If you do not need floating point datas and the buffering of the Amiga
 DOS is enough for you, you can use the Amiga DOS for outputs directly.
 The functions 'VPrintf' and 'VFPrintf' are here for these purposes - to
 output datas to an Amiga DOS file. But these functions aren't 100%
 compatible with ANSI C. Another possibility is the renunciation of the
 automatic opening and closing of libraries, because these functions
 deliver a comfortable output mechanism for error handling, regardless if
 the program has been started from CLI or Workbench, and which version of
 the operating system has been used.
 
 This luxury isn't necessary for every program. You can use a small
 startup code (which is written in assembler) and do only the most
 important things there, for example use the small data model and don't
 support resident programs.

@NODE frage35 "StormC-FAQ"

 @{B}Why is a program like 'Hello World' greater than one KByte?@{UB}

 The added library 'storm.lib' is an ANSI C library. For a program like
 'Hello World' the 'printf' function has to be linked. That means, that
 the functions of the library which aren't used in the program are also
 linked to it, like functions for integer or floating points datas because
 it isn't obvious which parts are necessary for the 'printf' command.
 Furthermore all printouts to files are buffered. Therefore even short
 programs get big.

@ENDNODE

@NODE frage36 "StormC-FAQ"

 @{B}Why doesn't have StormC a 'global optimizer'?@{UB}

 A 'global optimizer' optimizes a program with a look over the whole
 function, not only over single instructions or terms. Therefore a global
 optimizer can take a term, which is used in a loop - but in each step of
 the loop he has to create the same result - and put it in a place before
 the loop.
 
 StormC doesn't have this kind of optimization yet, but has been designed
 in such a way, that it can be implemented in a forthcoming version. But
 StormC has some optimizations included already now, which are normally
 part of an global optimizer. For example, the use of the global CPU and
 FPU registers in the higher optimization stages. The registers are
 distributed in the whole function optimally, with regard to all function
 calls and assignments to variables.
