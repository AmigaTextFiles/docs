This directory contains a ToolManager Dock for the InterNet
programs. It is a picture dock starting a text popup dock.
It can be appended to an existing Toolmanager configuration
in the Toolmanager Prefs program via the menu item 'Append'.

The main dock picture should be copied to a directory with
an assign 'tm_brushes:' on it. Otherwise the path to must
be edited in the Toolmanager Prefs.
