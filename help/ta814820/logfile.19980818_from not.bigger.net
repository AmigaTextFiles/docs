10.14.14 #       <WarNPeace> Well since I rarely venture off of this net, I wouldn't know, but like I said, I will gladly make the suggestion to her, who knows, she might go code happy and make it a reality :)

11.18.24 #       <Ogge> hi everyone
11.18.27 #       <Gozlingo> hi..
11.18.27 #       <HAMLET> Usually yes, but its pretty empty atm...
11.18.29 #       <HAMLET> Hi Ogge =)
11.18.41 #       <Gozlingo> Can you help me with my trapdoor prob, ogge.
11.19.08 #       <Ogge> gozlingo, trapdoor prob.. the thing i used to poll my fidonet mail??
11.19.23 #       <Gozlingo> yah that one :)
11.19.26 #       <Ogge> any news?
11.19.31 #       <Ogge> goz, whats wrong.. tell me
11.19.38 #       <Gozlingo> I can recieve mail packets but when It tries to send them, it gets to EOF and then sends it again, over and over again.
11.20.08 #       * Ogge ponders.. 
11.21.13 #       <Ogge> was a long time since i last used trapdoor.. but if it sends the packet over and over again it might be a configuration error
11.22.28 #       <Gozlingo> The guy who runs that node said that all I sent him every time was the packet's filename, nothing else.
11.23.02 #       <Ogge> ok.. sounds like a minor config error on your side.. 
11.23.22 #       <Ogge> does the trapdoor config point at the right outbound dir?
11.23.46 #       <Gozlingo> yes.
11.24.33 #       <Ogge> and u have a packet in the dir that u want to send?
11.24.50 #       * Ogge ponders even more.. 
11.24.50 #       <Gozlingo> yep.
11.26.29 #       <Ogge> sorry.. but i can't help u right away.. it has been two years since i last configurated trapdoor.. 
11.26.55 #       <Ogge> but give me a day and i'll check some more on the problem.. trying to find my old config files.. 
11.27.06 #       <Gozlingo> that's okay.. It's just been a bit of an arse for me.. This is twice that I've tried to get it working.
11.27.23 #       <Gozlingo> thanks, ogge if you could find anything that would be great :)
11.27.35 #       <Gozlingo> Now my next question :)
11.27.45 #       <Gozlingo> How do I get an ICQ account or whatever?
11.28.16 #       <HAMLET> You have to use either a PC or Mac, or you can use STRICQ for the amiga =)
11.28.17 #       <Ogge> get stricq (v 0.452) and register.. 
11.28.57 #       <HAMLET> Let me check if i have it handy
11.28.59 #       <Gozlingo> How much does registration cost?
11.29.06 #       <Ogge> nothing.. 
11.29.12 #       <Gozlingo> oh good :)
11.29.17 #       <Ogge> the reqistration for an icq account is free
11.29.39 #       <Ogge> there you have it gozlingo

11.31.23 #       <HAMLET> ogge: Remember to use 452 you have to upgrade from 445

11.32.18 #       <HAMLET> 452 of StrICQ is just an upgrade to 445, you need 445 and install 452 on top
11.32.38 #       <Ogge> hamlet, ok.. thats true.. i think i have that one too somewhere..

12.33.32 #       <[Gemini]> on undernet 9 is max i think
12.34.10 #       <Ogge> hmm.. where did i put that rfc for pop-servers.... 
12.34.48 #       <Ogge> will that be a nice feature of a script.. Telling you when u have new emails in your inbox?
12.35.05 #       <Ogge> no need to start the email proggie to check.. 
12.35.24 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: when i get mail, my screen flashes, and a msgpops up
12.35.41 #       <Ogge> gem, which mailbox checker do u use?
12.35.44 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: well... if u dont have 2 run the e-mail proggy... then its somthing
12.36.03 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: i use yam running in the background (iconfied)
12.36.11 #       <[Gemini]> checking every 10 minutes
12.36.51 #       <Ogge> ah.. i never start yam til a sample is played and a small icon is changing to another icon :) not using yam for that feature.. 
12.37.52 #       <[Gemini]> well..... i start everything frome the pull-down menu.. so it only takes me 15 secs 2 start it, let it check 4 mail, and then iconfy it :-)
12.38.29 #       <[Gemini]> hmmm... make that 7 secs :-)
12.39.44 #       <Ogge> hehe.. everytime i start amitcp it starts a mailbox checker than check the mail every 5 minutes (or was it three) and it takes 10k of memory :)) yam take alot more.. 
12.39.57 #       <Ogge> doesn't have to start anything manually
12.40.18 #       <[Gemini]> well.. i dont use amitcp, i use miami
12.40.30 #       <Ogge> hehe.. this one works on miami too.. 
12.41.04 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: whats it called?
12.41.08 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: With current prices, buying more memory shouldn't be a problem, but it saves much the trouble...
12.42.03 #       <Ogge> Artemis11.lha      comm/mail   66K 119 Monitor mailbox contents via P
12.42.11 #       <Ogge> there you have it gem.. 
12.42.29 #       <[Gemini]> thanx Ogge , jsut gonna start i-b and get it
12.43.02 #       <Ogge> yoshi, true.. but why buy more mem just to run a proggie that doesn't need to be runned only cz there are another that uses less memory
12.43.42 #       <[Gemini]> Yoshi2: buying more memory is ot an option 4 me at the moment.... i use GVP ram :-()
12.44.28 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Yes, but you still need both programs...
12.44.45 #       <Yoshi2> [Gemini]: No luck... :(
12.44.53 #       * [Gemini] wonders what we would have done without aminet :-)
12.45.49 #       <Ogge> yoshi, true.. but u don't have to run the memoryhungry proggie in the first place.. it free's some ram to be used for other things while w8ing for mail.. 
12.46.07 #       <Yoshi2> [Gemini]: Built up an alternative that uses the WWW and sucks?...
12.46.10 #       <Ogge> gem, bugging each other "you got that file? NO i got that one instead" ;)
12.46.29 #       <[Gemini]> hehehe
12.46.43 #       <[Gemini]> yeah... we all owe Urban a gr8 thanx :-)
12.47.08 #       <[Gemini]> neither the PC or the Mac got anything that even comes close :-)
12.47.10 #       <Yoshi2> Ogge: Sure.  But sooner or later, you need to start YAM anyway...  And I don't think that it uses that much mem when iconified...
12.47.22 #       <HAMLET> Anyone else here on the AmIRC ml ?
12.47.39 #       <Yoshi2> HAMLET: no, not me

17.09.50 #       <Agima> TA!
17.09.56 #       <Seed> Hi TA :)
17.10.40 #       <Dave_C> I hope folks do take exception to my saying if they flood Fleecy tomorrow, I'll clear the channel.
17.10.43 #       <TA> Bill M sent me word today. The AI site is going to present some inside info reachable by giving them a name and email address. If one word leaks to NON-Amiga press, it will never happen again.
17.10.48 #       <Dave_C> do=don't
17.11.12 #       <TA> It will happen on or by the 20th.
17.11.15 #       <Dave_C> TA: Yeah.. I saw the update on the new page.. ('bout time!)
17.11.53 #       <Dave_C> oh.. and www.amiga.net should have a slightly different index.html than the one that's there now.
17.12.07 #       * Dave_C has already made the edit
17.12.38 #       <DrJekyl> TA: why take a risk of even delivering info that will hurt the Amiga if it's so important ?
17.13.05 #       <TA> Because Bill made a promise to me.
17.13.27 #       <TA> Based on MY promise that we could behave ourselves and act like rational adults.
17.13.47 #       <DrJekyl> and why is Bill McEwen winding ppl up by posting that stuff on the amiga.com site ?
17.14.11 #       <DrJekyl> TA: you wount believe how many ppl have asked me about his post today :/
17.14.25 #       <Dave_C> It adds the anchor to the existing icoa page.
17.14.38 #       <Dave_C> when the move is done, simple change the anchor
17.14.43 #       <Agima> I'll be checking it myself when I've got the memory
17.15.01 #       <DrJekyl> Dave_C: it appears to have confused the majority of users (including myself)
17.15.12 #       <TA> DrJekyl: Because he is a man of his word, unlike some amigan's.
17.15.38 #       <Dave_C> Info that was presented at AmiWEST will be available on a registration only basis.
17.15.49 #       <TA> Dave_C: Correct!
17.15.53 #       <DrJekyl> TA: back to polatics then... I'll stay out of it this time =)
17.16.01 #       <TA> And he who passes it will be known and won't get anymore.
17.16.09 #       <Dave_C> That way, the info can be tracked.
17.16.38 #       <DrJekyl> Dave_C: that makes sense

18.04.03 #       <Agima> TA : I believe you had some stuff to ask Shoe? :)
18.04.27 #       <TA> shoecake: Why don't you hold a little seminar here one night on foundation and othetr stuff you have done.
18.04.35 #       <shoecake> Agima: i was at a wedding today, drinking booze in the sun. nice
18.05.11 #       <Agima> Nice :)
18.05.48 #       <shoecake> TA: i'm not really into that kind of stuff. prefer to keep out of discussions unless it involved weather, booze or cake :)
18.06.08 #       <Agima> Or money, you forgot the money!
18.06.12 #       <TA> shoecake: It would help more people understand the programs and get you some registrations.
18.07.43 #       <shoecake> TA: mayb but it's not very nice talking about work when i come on irc... i don't mind the odd chat about some things but it's nice to get on irc and chat about other stuff
18.07.54 #       <TA> shoecake: Think of the *money* ... :)
18.08.18 #       <shoecake> hmmm, there's no much money to make chatting to people on irc, mostly just large phone bills :)
18.08.20 #       * Agima crinkles £20 notes in front of Shoe's nose
18.08.24 #       <TA> You need to add a Clinton person in your Foundation ... :)

18.08.38 #       <Agima> :)
18.08.43 #       <shoecake> hehe, he's one i forgot
18.08.47 #       <TA> That is toppled easily by a Monica person.
18.09.04 #       <Agima> Peasantential(?) scandal! :)
18.09.15 #       <TA> hehehe
18.09.44 #       <TA> Haven't bought it yet due to some bad finances and trying to stay ahead, but I have to ask, is there a Jennifer?
18.09.52 #       <Agima> You need to watch it though, I hear Monica would just BLOW the house down.....
18.10.01 #       <TA> hehehe
18.10.14 #       <TA> Clinton's lawyer was VERY upset with his TV talk. 
18.10.25 #       <Agima> What did you make of it all?
18.10.43 #       <TA> Clinton was supposed to go on TV and say "I confess that she had me to her lips, but she never inhaled and that si the truth.
18.10.59 #       <TA> :)
18.11.13 #       <Agima> Hmmm.... she never inhaled... interesting....
18.12.06 #       <TA> shoecake: So how goes registrations?
18.12.19 #       <shoecake> TA: for foundation?
18.12.39 #       <TA> And will it work on an A3000/25 030 with Cybergfx 64/3D?
18.12.43 #       <TA> yes.
18.12.59 #       <TA> My son is dying for it.
18.13.02 #       <shoecake> 030/25 with cybergfx would be way too slow
18.13.10 #       <shoecake> 030/25 with aga might be okay
18.13.17 #       <TA> hmmm ... 
18.13.26 #       <shoecake> rtg version needs a fast cpu
18.13.26 #       <Agima> Uh? AGA faster than CGFX? Is this a processer speed issue?
18.13.47 #       <shoecake> with an 060 the rtg version would be faster than aga
18.13.54 #       <shoecake> but 030 would be slower
18.14.00 #       <TA> would an 040 work ok?
18.14.09 #       <shoecake> yeah, not bad
18.14.27 #       <TA> ok, I have been looking for a 3640 card. I'll do that then.
18.14.52 #       <TA> Can't afford that 060 by P5 right now.
18.14.54 #       <shoecake> is that 040/25?
18.15.01 #       <TA> yes ... :(
18.15.05 #       <TA> still too slow?
18.15.33 #       <shoecake> that may also be a little slow. the 040/25 isn't much better than 030/50 and rtg version does need a good bit of power
18.16.03 #       <TA> hmmm ... maybe I could slag in a 50mhz in the 3640?  :)
18.16.13 #       <Agima> Clock it! CLOCK it!!! :)
18.16.21 #       <TA> and add an air conditioner to my 3000?  :)

18.16.28 #       <Agima> Fridge! Fridge!
18.17.28 #       <TA> without committing yourself, are you thinking about staying with the amiga thru OS 4.0 and beyond?
18.18.11 #       <TA> or will you stay with the classic? I am just curious for my own benefit.
18.18.18 #       <shoecake> I might but a developer machine if i can afford one, else i'll wait for the next official amiga
18.18.26 #       <Agima> If you were askin' me, I'd be there 'til the end. On both of 'em. :)
