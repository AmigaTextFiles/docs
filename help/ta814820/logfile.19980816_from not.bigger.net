04.11.53 #       <DrJekyl> NZ how far is that ?
04.11.56 #       <Jamesc> Oh yeah, where abouts?
04.12.04 #       <Jamesc> NZ .. Quite a few hundred :)
04.12.18 #       <DrJekyl> hehe looks close on a map though ;)
04.12.25 #       <Jamesc> Probably a couple a thousand :)
04.12.32 #       <Jamesc> And yourself?
04.12.43 #       <DrJekyl> Wales uk
04.12.52 #       <DrJekyl> Newport
04.12.53 #       <Jamesc> Loverly Spot :)
04.13.00 #       <DrJekyl> been here ?
04.13.23 #       <Jamesc> My folks hail from the Midlands UK :)
04.13.34 #       <Jamesc> Nope, but I feel like I have :)
04.13.44 #       <Jamesc> Had a welsh uncle ...
04.13.58 #       <Jamesc> Uncle Roy.. Coupla times removed...
04.14.22 #       <DrJekyl> doubt I know him ;)
04.14.31 #       <Jamesc> So do I :)
04.14.53 #       <Jamesc> He looked a little like Harry Secombe<sp?> :)
04.14.58 #       <DrJekyl> so you on an Amiga ?
04.15.22 #       <Jamesc> Certainly do! :) Have owned and programmed one since they first hit our shores :)
04.15.33 #       <DrJekyl> :)
04.15.40 #       <Jamesc> Only a 2000/030 ... But she still goes like beaut.
04.16.10 #       <DrJekyl> I've managed to get an A4040/25 for £200 :))
04.16.15 #       <Jamesc> Greatly covet an A4000 with PPC card for sale over here at the moment.. But don't quite have the A$3500.00 that they're asking for it...
04.16.22 #       <Jamesc> 200!!!
04.16.23 #       <Jamesc> Wow!
04.16.35 #       <Jamesc> Nope, they've definitely kept their value over here.. 
04.17.01 #       <DrJekyl> yep. it ws sold as having a knackered paula chip to me for £200
04.17.22 #       <Jamesc> My A2000/030 is always busy... :) Runs AWS, FTPs and CNet BBS Software.
04.17.28 #       <DrJekyl> dut it was just the floppy drive so I put my A1200 floppy drive in it :))
04.17.33 #       <Jamesc> Not a bad pickup.. Was the Paula repairable?
04.17.39 #       <Jamesc> Magic!
04.17.43 #       <DrJekyl> :)
04.18.05 #       <Jamesc> I'm really hoping that I'll be able to get into some more development work with the new platform coming out...
04.18.24 #       <Jamesc> I've got fed up programming small systems on PCs.. And some fairly large ones I'll admit...
04.18.34 #       <DrJekyl> what have you created so far ? :)
04.18.42 #       <Jamesc> I want something Bleeding edge for a change :)
04.18.51 #       <Jamesc> All sorts of junk! :)
04.18.58 #       <Jamesc> Mainly 2 categories
04.19.05 #       <Jamesc> Utility Programs (Smallish) 
04.19.11 #       <Jamesc> And Business Database applications.
04.19.40 #       <DrJekyl> only thing I've ever coded is a few AmIRC scripts :/
04.20.01 #       <Jamesc> I'd like to look at the comms on the new platform and investigate creating some intuitive interfaces for users 
04.20.20 #       <DrJekyl> have you seen genesis yet ?
04.20.23 #       <Jamesc> But since I don't have any idea what I'll have to work with... I can only speculate at the moment :)
04.20.40 #       <Jamesc> Nope. What's genesis?
04.20.50 #       <DrJekyl> the new AmiTCP 4.6
04.21.03 #       <DrJekyl> I'll get a url hang on a sec..
04.21.45 #       <Jamesc> My Amitcp stack is a little old to say the least.. And while I paid for it, I never got around to sending the registration card in...
04.22.42 #       <DrJekyl> http://www.active-net.co.uk/products/netconnect/
04.22.49 #       <DrJekyl> ^ that's the site
04.23.41 #       <Jamesc> Looking it up :)
04.24.01 #       <DrJekyl> http://www.the-awa.u-net.com/exclusive/reviews/nc2.html
04.24.20 #       <DrJekyl> ^ that's the online review (by yours truley) ;)
04.25.02 #       <Jamesc> My current Amiga project is getting an Apollo030/50MHZ card to replace my old A2630...
04.25.18 #       <Jamesc> The 2630 can only address 8 Meg, and I need about 3 or 4 times that amount :)
04.26.03 #       <DrJekyl> I would like a CS mk3 or CS-PPC but can't afford it :(
04.26.20 #       <DrJekyl> this has a max of 16mb fast atm :((
04.26.28 #       <Jamesc> Well twice the speed and 5 times the memory capacity will suit me :)
04.27.44 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
04.28.10 #       <Jamesc> Don't know that I'll need this new tcp stack currently (I mean, it was a dog to setup years ago, but has run flawlessly!) but would be nice for the new 4000 :) (SFX: Eyes Twinkle) :)
04.28.30 #       <DrJekyl> :)
04.28.57 #       <DrJekyl> it is a good stable and slightly faster than miami setup :)
04.29.48 #       <Jamesc> Yeah, everyone waffles on about how much better miami is than AmiTCP.. Could be they've turned the tables...
04.30.23 #       <Jamesc> I already own Voyager and AmIRC .. So I guess I'll just want the AMITCP-Genesis product...
04.30.25 #       <DrJekyl> miami has too many implamented restrictions, like the DCC send for example :(
04.30.39 #       <Jamesc> It's always a pity just how LITTLE our Dollar is worth over there though!

10.25.48 #       <Dave_C> I liked the little foray again into MIDI
10.26.28 #       <Dave_C> Personally, Music-X looked like a beginners toy, more than a professions sequencer package.
10.26.47 #       <Dave_C> and when anthony said KCS and B&P were LIMITED?
10.27.34 #       <Rocambole> :) maybe a matter of taste

10.29.41 #       <Dave_C> I'd like to see the power features of KCS in any NEW generation of MIDI sequencers
10.30.05 #       <Dave_C> ROc; The free release or a bought commercial one?

10.31.28 #       <Dave_C> To be honest, I haven't had a sequencer up on this machine in years.
10.31.35 #       <Dave_C> OH GOOD!
10.31.39 #       <Dave_C> please DCC it.

10.55.36 #       <Yoshi2> hi Dozer 
10.55.38 #       <Dozer> Hi everyone... I have a question about CD-ROM filing systems.... is it possible to read ISO9660 with the inferior "joliet" extension (Win95 filenames) on the Amiga?
10.55.41 #       <TA> Dozer: Did you get the news that Joe Torre has left AI?
10.55.47 #       <Dozer> hello again. ;)
10.56.20 #       <Dozer> TA: I've been "away" the whole weekend... what did Joe do?
10.56.23 #       <Dave_C> Dozer: yes, w/ CrossDOS 7
10.56.56 #       <Dozer> Dave_C: how? I have CrossDos 7.01... the manual says it's impossible with CD's.. only harddrives....
10.57.21 #       <TA> Joe Torre has left Amiga Inc to return to Atlanta. Joe felt that since he is a hardware man and Amiga Inc is persuing a policy of offloading hardware development and doing only software development at this time, his talents were being wasted.
10.57.51 #       <Dozer> TA: hm... they lost a great deal there...
10.58.01 #       <TA> Joe left in good graces and would be welcome back at Amiga Inc.
10.58.01 #       <Rocambole> TA: great loss :(
10.58.29 #       <Cryto> TA:  Kinda wish AI would do some HW...  Least do something to get the base system done, and things rolling..
10.58.37 #       <TA> But, please note there is nothing sinister in his leaving AI.
10.58.58 #       <Dozer> TA: The world won't end atleast.. ;)

11.04.57 #       <TA> Yoshi2: Anytime Amiga Plus publishes anything without naming a source, consider it another rumor they have either picked up somewhere or are trying to start themselves.
11.05.52 #       <Yoshi2> TA: In other words, this is very probably just bullsh*t? :)
11.06.38 #       <TA> Yoshi2: In laymen's terms, it is complete bullshit.
11.06.59 #       <TA> In diplomatic/PR terms ... consider this a rumor unless a source is named.

11.08.34 #       <Yoshi2> TA: So I can put "Denied by Gary Peake" in the Status: field on ANN for that article?
11.09.02 #       <TA> Yes, you can also put 'confirmed by Gary Peake' next to Joe Torre leaving AI.
11.09.29 #       <TA> Fell free to quote me on Joe's leaving.

12.20.54 #       <Rocambole> Penny: nice to have you with us again :))
12.21.02 #       <Penny> :)))))))) THX honey ;)) 
12.21.07 #       <Dave_C> Termite TCP bombed more times than the US did IRAQ
12.21.12 #       <Penny> miss my old friends :))) 
12.21.19 #       <Dave_C> ;^)
12.21.21 #       <Ogge> cryto, the tcp/ip stack should atleast be amitcp.. more features and more secure than termite
12.21.35 #       <Dave_C> or MiamiDeluxe....
12.21.46 #       <Ogge> NOT miami.. 
12.21.47 #       <Dave_C> at least allow mulitple interfaces
12.22.04 #       <Cryto> Ogge: AmiTCP aint easy for a new user to setup tho. :)  Termite is easy..  It doesnt need alot of features, just something to get them on the net.  They want features, they can get Miami. :)
12.22.05 #       * Rocambole want's Miami DeLuxe :)
12.22.10 #       <Dozer> Dave_C: did you find anything about joilet and the Amiga? I couldn't find diddely...
12.22.18 #       <Cryto> Rocambole: So do I. :)
12.22.46 #       <Dave_C> I just got thru eating...let me see...
12.23.10 #       <Ogge> cryto, can't agree.. first time i setup amitcp it only took me 15 minutes.. 
12.23.54 #       <Dozer> Dave_C: ah... ok..
12.24.18 #       <Cryto> Ogge: Which version?  When I first started with AmiTCP it was 4.0..  4.01 made it easier, and better to work with PPP..
12.24.33 #       <Dozer> Ogge: you must be the swedish genious then... It took me about 5 days... 
12.24.45 #       <Dozer> Miami and Netconnect 2 is great.. ;)
12.24.50 #       <Ogge> cryto, amitcp 4.0 demo version.. 
12.27.03 #       * Ogge wonders why does he always end up with loads of windows on the workbench.. 
12.27.19 #       <Dave_C> best bet would be to contact consultron directly... (313) 459-7271 (tech support)

14.23.01 #       <Yoshi2> Top 10 Reason you're spending too much time on IRC:
14.23.17 #       <Yoshi2> #1 you use "Re" instead of "Hi!" since you're online almost all the time :))
14.23.17 #       <TA> 1. Don't want to deal with reality.
14.23.34 #       <TA> 2. Kids are to loud.
14.23.44 #       <TA> 3. Nothing good on TV.
14.23.57 #       <TA> 4. Wife is gone or mad or gone mad.
14.24.04 #       <TA> :)
14.24.06 #       <Yoshi2> hmm.  I wanted to write "signs", not "reasons" :))
14.24.11 #       <TA> oh ...
14.24.17 #       <Yoshi2> my mistake :)
14.24.41 #       <TA> 1. An arguement with Tim Rue becomes exciting.
14.24.58 #       <wurzel> TA: Hehehehe
14.24.58 #       <Yoshi2> 2. An argument with EAL becomes interesting
14.25.10 #       <TA> 2. You no longer communicate with the family except in writing.
14.25.36 #       <Yoshi2> 3. You know more people by nickname than by real name
14.25.45 #       <wurzel> 5. U shortn all ur words when u write :)
14.26.56 #       <Yoshi2> 6. the next time you phone somebody and he doesn't answer you complain about lag and decide to switch servers...
14.27.09 #       <wurzel> 6. When you apply for a job, you ask if you get an internet connection.
14.27.28 #       <wurzel> Ah, make that 7. ;)
14.27.57 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
14.28.00 #       <TA> 8. You only communicate with your wife when you have her 'plugged in'.
14.28.15 #       <TA> and hear a dial tone in her ears.
14.28.33 #       * TA got slapped for that one.
14.28.34 #       <wurzel> TA: LOL
14.29.06 #       <TA> :)
14.30.03 #       <Yoshi2> 9. you argue with PC people how much better IRC is, as compared to WWW/Java chat systems
14.30.21 #       <Yoshi2> 10. you begin to make your own "top 10 signs" lists :)))
14.30.51 #       <wurzel> 13. You begin to lose the drift ..
14.31.18 #       <wurzel> .. and wake up with keymarks on your forehead.

14.31.58 #       <wurzel> Yoshi2: hehehe
14.32.42 #       <Yoshi2> 11. you spend more time online than offline

17.00.33 #       <Kinners> hi DrJekyl and hesido
17.00.43 #       <DrJekyl> Kinners 
17.01.54 #       <hesido> this fresh channel seems warm (other channels require some months to get accepted :)
17.03.23 #       <DrJekyl> hesido :)
17.05.06 #       <hesido> anyone installed glowicons yam gfx?
17.05.26 #       <DrJekyl> nope
17.05.41 #       <hesido> the read toolbar was trashed. I fixed it. :)
17.06.28 #       <hesido> well glowicons themselves could have been much better if they actually glowed when clicked
17.06.44 #       <hesido> instead, they darken, and outlines glow.
17.07.20 #       <Kinners> hesido: Possibly not enough colours to make everything glow?
17.08.14 #       <hesido> kinners: when there's newicons, there's always enough colors! (well I love newicons. I don't like magicstyle)

17.09.51 #       <hesido> well. I like glowicons too! I'll install it when it comes to v1.0
17.10.13 #       <hesido> the artist says he's gonna add more animations and more icons.
17.10.46 #       <hesido> kinners: are you the glowicons guy??? :)
17.11.09 #       <Kinners> hesido:  I have trouble drawing squares, so figure that out for yourself :))
