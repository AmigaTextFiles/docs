14.32.57 #       <Petah> Yosh: "en route"? "one route"?

15.14.56 #       <Merko> Well, this channel hasn't lived up to the hype, so to speak. <marge-like groan>
15.16.37 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: Hmmm...  I tried my best, but even three mentions on ANN didn't help much...
15.17.13 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Well, that's the hype.. of course you've done your best also by being here but anyway. :)
15.17.28 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: :)
15.17.54 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: It's Friday evening, a lot of people are enjoying their weekend...
15.18.04 #       <Arvid> <-- as one of those wierdos who has actually done advertising for a living .. I add from experience that you must do continuous promotion and keep your name before your intended audience
15.18.34 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: I agree.  It has taken 18 months to get ANN where it is now...
15.18.52 #       <Merko> Arvid: Yeah, but I think we also have a problem of people coming here, seeing that there are 3 guys idling, and never returning..
15.19.40 #       <Arvid> Merko: then the people in charge should insure that the people who are in charge keep a continuous conversation going
15.21.19 #       <Yoshi2> Well, Darxide_TA is already chatting a bit, but he's lacking the AI to say anything that makes much sense :)
15.21.44 >>>     "sview" by Yoshi2 (ckemp@ppp9.vo.lu)
15.21.52 >>>     "top talk" by Yoshi2 (ckemp@ppp9.vo.lu)
15.21.52 #       <Arvid> and some folks should take it upon themselves to start new conversations .. I think I did a bit toward that about three evenings ago when I wrote a couple of lines about the exceptionally wierd Cooksey.  (Even though I am certainly not one of the people in charge here, it was kind of fun to watch the excitement).
15.22.36 #       <Yoshi2> Cooksey is a good topic to start a conversation
15.23.15 #       <Yoshi2> But it's not right that so much time is wasted on him...  that time could be used discussing other things...
15.23.30 #       <Arvid> <-- has spent part of this day getting people to talk about my new computer
15.23.53 #       <Arvid> with some success, actually
15.23.59 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: What computer?
15.24.38 #       <Arvid> Yoshi: I have a new machine ... 68000 cpu at 16 Mhz, preemptive multitasking, built in tcp/ip  (care to guess?)
15.24.56 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: no idea :)
15.25.11 #       <Arvid> Yoshi the 3Com/USR PalmPilot
15.25.29 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: OK.  Didn't know it used a mot CPU
15.26.27 #       <Arvid> Indeed it does.  And I have read that 3Com sold 2-million of them in the last year.  Assuming that Motorola actually made the cpu (I'm not sure of that) .. the 68000 must be the best selling of all the 680x0 series right now
15.27.12 #       <Petah> Arvid: Built in TCP/IP? What applications exist?
15.27.22 #       <Petah> Arvid: Networking applications, that is
15.27.33 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: That's for sure.  At least 3 million Amigas, many million Apples, many million Ataris, many CDi's...
15.27.47 #       <Arvid> Petah: so far, I've not tried either of the two WWW Browsers I downloaded .. but I've been in this channel and others with IRC today
15.27.50 #       <Petah> And SEGA Master Systems :)
15.28.06 #       <Petah> Ah
15.28.11 #       <Petah> Arvid: So what OS does it use?
15.28.29 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: But not right now. :)
15.28.33 #       <Arvid> Petah: of course IRC on that two X three inch screen is a bit of a chore for those of us with less than perfect eyesight
15.28.42 #       <Yoshi2> Arvid: With the USR on IRC, that is
15.29.35 #       <Arvid> Petah: the interesting thing about the OS .. the first PalmPilots used Palm OS 1 .. the one I have (the Professional) .. uses Palm OS 2 .. the newest machines uses Palm OS 3 ... now what does that remind you of?
15.29.50 #       <Petah> Arvid: Kickstarts?
15.30.01 #       <Arvid> Yoshi: well true .. this A3000 keyboard is much nicer than the handwriting recognition ...
15.30.11 #       <Petah> Arvid: So are there any devkits available for AmigaOS?
15.30.23 #       <Arvid> Petah: that is what I was thinking of .. the comparison to Amiga OS

15.35.50 #       <Merko> re :)
15.36.08 #       <Petah> Arvid: So you know how sophisticated the TCP/IP stack is? Can you run "server" applications on the Pilot? Like a webserver?
15.37.58 #       <Arvid> Petah: I think that would be a bit odd on a tiny computer.  But there is nothing limited as far as I know about the tcp/ip .. it supports  PPP  SLIP or CSLIP and talks to the modem at up to 57600 bps
15.39.15 #       <Petah> Arvid: Just modems? You can't use the TCP/IP stack to make the Pilot talk to e.g. an Amiga via a serial cable?
15.40.03 #       <Arvid> Petah: that is easy enough .. well probably not for me .. but for someone else .. that is how I get software onto the PP and backups of data onto the Amiga
15.40.36 #       <Petah> Arvid: Ah. So you're using ftp then?
15.41.26 #       * Yoshi2 is signing off.  See you all later.
15.41.33 #       <Arvid> Petah: ah no .. but I saw an ftp client for download for the PP .. and a telnet client too .. I have not downloaded them .. The Amiga/PalmPilot connection is via a program available on aminet just for that purpose

15.50.37 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: not me

15.52.34 #       <Arvid> Merko: and I've seen some sheets of insulating material for use under heat sinks .. feels like rubber, but is a silicon based material

15.57.13 #       <Arvid> Merko: but I think you have to move the heat away from the components and either a liquid or a lot of air circulating is the only way to do that

15.58.38 #       <heart> afternoon
15.58.50 #       <Merko> Arvid: Well.. the idea would be to conduct the heat to the casing, which would in turn conduct it to the surrounding air and cause some natural convection.
16.00.49 #       <Merko> I find it unlikely that the computer would reach 50° C, casing and all.. but maybe it would.

17.49.15 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: but there is little support for CA. and everyone else I have asked on other servers say CA sux :/
17.50.01 #       <Arvid> The Class Act stuff I use (now to think of what I use) certainly works well and looks good

17.51.22 #       <DrJekyl> hi Kinners 
17.51.27 #       <Kinners> hello everyone
17.52.08 #       <Arvid> DrJekly .. amiftp .. (looking)

17.54.47 #       <DrJekyl> hi Squiz 
17.54.47 #       <Arvid> DrJekyl .. the old IRC program I did use .. but not now ... hmmm whatever it was, it looked really good but was never as good as AmIRC
17.54.56 #       <Squiz> Hello
17.55.09 #       <Squiz> Grapevine?
17.55.23 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: so you only have 1 CA app but you still think it's better than gadtools or MUI ?
17.55.38 #       <Arvid> DrJekyl .. hang on
17.56.23 #       <DrJekyl> Jamesc,Kinners,Squiz  what are your views. do you prefer Gadtools CA or MUI ?
17.56.36 #       <Arvid> DrJ: a big one .. AWeb
17.56.54 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: A big one ? :) LOL
17.57.12 #       <Kinners> DrJekyl: They all have their advantages, so I can't really pick one
17.57.21 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: most ppl use IB or V :)
17.57.34 #       <Arvid> DrJ: in many ways, much better than IBrowse
17.57.55 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: why ? javascript support, what else ?
17.58.00 #       <Arvid> DrJ: I have the paid for AWeb 3.2 and the paid for IBrowse 1.22 ... 
17.58.12 #       <Arvid> DrJ: I really dislike Voyager
17.58.29 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: and IB ?
17.58.54 #       <Arvid> DrJ: Aweb is a lot (and I mean a LOT) faster than IBrowse at displaying pages
17.59.27 #       * DrJekyl invites Arvid to count up all his apps and tell him what he uses most. GT CA or MUI
17.59.39 #       <Arvid> that would take hours and I don't have the time
17.59.56 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: I've tried the Aweb demo... well everyone to his own
18.00.10 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: ok :)
18.00.59 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: I was just curious why so many ppl prefer MUI but you are the first person to say he likes CA more :)
18.01.35 #       <Squiz> DrJ: In answer to your question a minute ago, my preference is MUI
18.01.57 #       <DrJekyl> Squiz: ok tnx (and sorry) :)
18.02.05 #       <Squiz> <- Was outside smoking
18.02.17 #       <DrJekyl> Squiz: in work or sommik then ?
18.02.31 #       <Squiz> DrJ: No, at home. I just don't smoke inside.
18.02.43 #       <DrJekyl> Squiz: good policy :)
18.02.52 #       <Arvid> DrJ: obviously the greater number of programs are written using MUI .. but Class Act stuff is much smaller and seems more efficient
18.02.57 #       <Squiz> It stinks up everything.. 
18.03.20 #       <Arvid> oooh the greater number of programs is
18.04.05 #       <Squiz> It's not more efficient at all. It appears faster, since it does a lot less. MUI is actually a *lot* faster than CA.
18.04.43 #       <Arvid> squiz: does that make any difference?  I don't think so
18.04.51 #       <Squiz> Yes.
18.05.07 #       <Arvid> What matters to me is the efficiency of the programs I use.
18.05.15 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: if it's not speed or looks then what is it that makes you think CA is better /
18.05.36 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: but as you said you only have 2 CA apps
18.05.58 #       <Kinners> squiz: How do you mean MUI is faster than CA?
18.06.02 #       <DrJekyl> would not more ppl develope with CA if it was better ?
18.06.10 #       <Arvid> DrJ: I said I found only two.. I have thousands of programs .. I would have to look at each one to see what it uses
18.06.26 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: fair enough
18.06.34 #       <Arvid> DrJ: developers who use CA use it for just that reason
18.06.37 #       <Squiz> Kinners: In terms of what it does, it's faster. If CA was adapted to look as nice as MUI, it would be 10x slower.
18.07.00 #       <Kinners> Squiz: Do you know that for sure? They are both BOOPSI based remember
18.07.05 #       <Squiz> Anyway, I refuse to get into CA vs. MUI arguments. It's a dull argument that I've been through before.
18.07.10 #       <Squiz> Kinners: Yes.
18.08.18 #       <Arvid> Squiz speaks the truth there .. it does not matter 
18.08.45 #       <Kinners> squiz: I don't care if it renders mandlebrot images in 1 second, so how fast it apparently is doesn't make me happy.  I want responsiveness.  But like you both say, it doesn't matter, and I'm reasoably happy with both systems
18.08.50 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: but it could.
18.09.58 #       <Squiz> Kinners: Personally, I want it to look good as well. If you were to get faster processors, MUI would be extremely fast, and look fantastic as well. As it is, it's pretty quick, and it looks great.
18.10.05 #       <Arvid> DrJekyl and Armageddon could be a good movie, if only the script, director, actors, crew, and effects were different.  But it does not matter to me .
18.10.33 #       <DrJekyl> Arvid: so if the next WB is MUI you would not mind ?
18.10.51 #       <Squiz> I'm going to bed, I'm knackered.
18.10.55 #       <Squiz> G'night
18.10.56 #       <Arvid> DrJ I would not mind at all ... I alwsys get the latest MUI

19.04.50 #       <gabeeg> Anybody here have a A3000?
19.05.02 #       <TA> OK, then I will. 
19.05.09 #       <TA> gabeeg: Yes, I do.
19.06.03 #       <gabeeg> TA:  Is it accelerated?  If so what board?
19.06.12 #       <TA> Joe Torre has left Amiga Inc since they are persuing a mainly software development stance. Jowe feels his talents are not going to be fully used. 
19.06.20 #       <TA> gabeeg: No accelerator.
19.06.26 #       <Kinners> Hmm
19.06.37 #       <gabeeg> Joe Torre left!?  When?
19.06.42 #       <TA> He leaves on good terms and under no pressure. 
19.06.52 #       <TA> gabeeg: This week.
19.07.24 #       <TA> Joe is a hardware guy, not a software guy. Not much for him to do there.
19.07.30 #       <gabeeg> TA:  This has not been a good Amiga week :(
19.07.43 #       <Kinners> TA: Where is he headed now?
19.08.23 #       <TA> Kinners: Not sure yet.
19.09.34 #       <Kinners> TA: Will he be back in the future? Like when they get the MMC/MMR/Ihavenoideawhatthechipiscallednowdays?
19.09.45 #       <TA> gabeeg: The Amiga scene is changing as we once knew it. Things are starting to move into place.
19.10.21 #       <TA> Kinners: Joe is welcome back I understand. He left on his own. 
19.12.10 #       <Kinners> TA: I was a bit worried for a moment :) "Joe Torre has left Amiga".  "World about to end".  "Microsoft seen outside J. Torre's house".  I think I need more sleep :)
19.12.52 #       <gabeeg> Now would be a good time for AI to give us users a shot in the arm (more detailed plans, etc)
19.13.11 #       <TA> Kinners: Just trying to tell th ereal story before the runmors start flying. Feel free to quote me.
19.14.07 #       <gabeeg> The newsgroups the last few days are full of the downtrodden ...CU Amiga dying...Vulcan being gloomy...etc.
19.15.40 #       <TA> gabeeg: Just the calm before the storm.
19.16.55 #       <Kinners> And there are the Tim Rue/EAU idiots
19.18.03 #       <Jamesc> Hi TA!
19.18.08 #       <TA> I, personally, am done with Mr Rue. 
19.18.11 #       <TA> Hey Jamesc
19.19.19 #       <TA> Jamesc: Joe Torre has left Amiga Inc to persue other interests. Since AI is developing software, not hardware, Joe felt his talents were being wasted.
19.20.32 #       <Jamesc> Oh right...
19.20.34 #       <TA> I have never offered anyone a chance to slam me on my own web pages and Mr Rue could have if he would have produced some 'proof' of his wild accusations. Pity him.
19.21.27 #       <TA> Jamesc: Joe is welcome back any time. He left on his own and in good graces.
19.21.44 #       <Jamesc> You know we could do without this sort of thing....
19.22.05 #       <TA> Jamesc: Better to tell th etruth straight up than to have rumors flying.
19.22.35 #       <TA> Joe is worried about it having some adverse effect so I anm making sure the truth is known.
19.22.41 #       <Jamesc> Oh yes, that much is true.
19.22.57 #       <Jamesc> Still a pity...
19.23.09 #       <TA> yeah, I will miss his crazy projects.
19.24.36 #       <Jamesc> Gary, I haven't been involved in Amiga Software development for many years,
19.24.55 #       <Jamesc> But I'd like to get a contact somewhere about getting involved with the development of software for the new platform
19.24.57 #       <Jamesc> when it comes out.
19.25.17 #       <Jamesc> Any tips on how to get into the development group these days?
19.25.41 #       <Jamesc> I _used_ to be on the list.. As recent as 3.0 actually, but lost contact a looooonnggg time ago..
19.25.55 #       <TA> Jamesc: send an email to jlowery@ibrowse.com and tell him you are interested in being a beta tester. Tell John that I sent you.
19.26.46 #       <Jamesc> Dave C said to do that, and I have done so and received a message (Mysterious :) like) and a sample of what a form will look like...
19.27.31 #       <TA> Jamesc: Just hang on to the thought. Things will start happening soon.
19.27.33 #       <Jamesc> But no mention of what it was all about ... Is jlowery likely to put me in contact with the developmet group in due course?
19.27.45 #       <Jamesc> Ok. Hanging on :)
