10.05.57 #       <MSkov> And Good Evening :)
10.05.58 #       <Dave_C> He is due in 9 hours
10.06.06 #       <Dave_C> ooops
10.06.08 #       <Dave_C> 8 hours
10.06.13 #       <MSkov> You got to be kidding!
10.06.16 #       <Dave_C> nope
10.06.28 #       <Dave_C> 21:00 EAST US time
10.06.41 #       <Dave_C> DOn't worry.. it will all be logged
10.06.46 #       <MSkov> yes... what date are you on over there?
10.07.03 #       <Dave_C> it's not gonna be a pick fleecy's brain and make him reveal NDA stuff.
10.07.13 #       <Dave_C> it's the 19th
10.07.29 #       <Dave_C> it's after midnight for you isn't it?
10.07.43 #       <Dave_C> no.. you're only like 6 hours off from me...
10.07.50 #       <MSkov> no... it's 19.05pm...
10.08.13 #       <Dave_C> you're 9 hours off from me
10.08.22 #       <Dave_C> wait
10.08.30 #       <Dave_C> nope 7 hours...
10.08.33 #       <Dave_C> it's one of those days..
10.08.39 #       <MSkov> oh yeah! Now I get it! Oh yes, you're behind over there! Stupid round earth... :)
10.08.45 #       <Dave_C> I've been knee deep in a 6x86 233 box
10.09.04 #       <MSkov> poor soul :)
10.09.08 #       <Dave_C> finally got the bitch running too.
10.09.14 #       <Dave_C> it's rather barren
10.09.21 #       <Dave_C> and needs a new HD
10.09.39 #       <Dave_C> (or the removal of all the M$ stuff that 'came' with it)
10.09.56 #       <Dave_C> It's a scavenged together box of wires
10.10.04 #       <MSkov> well, it just that I'm a journalist and was hoping to ask Fleecy some questions... but it's going to be to late, now
10.10.18 #       <Dave_C> but so far, it's cost me only $280
10.10.28 #       <Dave_C> hmmm
10.10.44 #       <Dave_C> He's already stated that he's not gonna lose a testicle
10.10.46 #       <Dave_C> hehehe
10.10.55 #       <Dave_C> (his cost of breaking nda)
10.10.55 #       <MSkov> what a way to put it...
10.11.43 #       <Dave_C> It's gonna be a casual chat, more to let him hear our ideas, as well as answer HIS questions to the userbase.
10.11.56 #       <MSkov> well, my first question was going to be just how importent these NDAs are... cause they gotta be quite importent when they can't even be told to the Amiga community
10.12.08 #       <Dave_C> they are.
10.12.13 #       <Dave_C> I"m under one...
10.12.39 #       <MSkov> just HOW importent (sensing a break as a journalist) :)
10.13.02 #       <Dave_C> does costing a testicle say enough?
10.13.12 #       <Dave_C> do NOT quote me on that
10.13.13 #       <MSkov> it does... it does...
10.13.23 #       <MSkov> it would sound nice, though
10.13.27 #       <MSkov> :)
10.13.52 #       <Dave_C> If anything further gets out, it's totally closed out on communication w/ the users.
10.14.04 #       <Dave_C> business is cut-throat everywhere.
10.14.11 #       <MSkov> still... can you tell me when they will come a bit more forward themselves?
10.14.34 #       <Dave_C> nope... I'm just a lowly icoa associate.
10.14.42 #       <Dave_C> and workgroup member
10.14.57 #       <MSkov> I hope they'll say something at Cologne
10.15.14 #       <Dave_C> go to bed early...
10.15.23 #       <Dave_C> take a nice nap, and be here...
10.15.29 #       <Dave_C> ask fleecy...
10.15.52 #       <Dave_C> he may answer, or he may ask you how you liked the Hulk Hogan Jay Leno wrestling match...
10.15.57 #       <Dave_C> ;^)
10.16.10 #       <MSkov> the problem is that I have to be up by 6am... :(

10.17.53 #       <Dave_C> You wanna talk to fleecy, or do you want to watch a bunch of hairy legged guys chasing their balls?
10.17.58 #       <Dave_C> hehehehehe
10.18.23 #       <Dave_C> sorry... I'm feeling quite silly today...
10.18.30 #       <Dave_C> probably from lack of sleep.

11.59.43 #       <Sterri> I know SCSI is faster than IDE.
11.59.52 #       <[Gemini]> Sterri: but u must pay twice then

12.35.54 #       <[Gemini]> well... if it dossent take 2 much resources, then yes
12.36.43 #       <[Gemini]> or perhaps u could put it in theconfig file somehow?
12.36.51 #       <[Gemini]> so that ppl can decide 4 themselvs
12.37.34 #       <Ogge> ok.. i'll have a look but i have already implemented a shutdown argument.. 
12.37.58 #       <Ogge> and then i think i'll add it so it starts automatically when amirc is connected to a net.. 
12.38.10 #       <Ogge> still need to add some checks
12.38.15 #       <[Gemini]> Ogge: ahh.. thats good :-)

15.23.30 #       <Seed> Yoshi2: I suggest the one with no digits in it. studies show that they generate many mistakes
15.23.39 #       <Seed> it's easier to type just characters
15.23.48 #       <Merko> I think so too.
15.23.51 #       <Merko> But, what is it?
15.24.37 #       <Seed> Chatsurfer is my vote
15.24.37 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: A page with charts I'm planning to setup.  With cgi and stuff.
15.24.54 #       <Merko> Charts? What kind of charts?
15.25.17 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: All kind of charts (but preferably those that bring the most traffic :))
15.25.33 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: ie. MP3, celebrities, etc.
15.25.38 #       <[SteaG]> Yoshi2 : Chatsurfer sounds good to me too ;-)

15.38.29 #       <defacto> Has anyone thought about moving this channel to another network, toooo much lag
15.38.31 #       <Merko> It only says boxer delays are unrelated to quikpak.

17.13.58 #       <DrJekyl> Sterri: ?
17.14.21 #       <TA> Fleecy isn't coming here looking for a cake walk. He wants to answer serious questions so everyone has a grasp of the real plans, etc that can be revealed at this time.
17.14.36 #       <Sterri> DrJekyl: you said you won't be up around this time of the night?
17.14.52 #       <phoe> can someone ask what effect Joe Torre's departure will make to the development ?

17.15.50 #       <phoe> TA: I won't be able to hang around that late :-(
17.16.16 #       <Yoshi> phoe: Come on, only one more hour... :))
17.16.16 #       <TA> Fleecy wants you to voice real concerns if you have them so he can answer them. You can't be a help team if you don't know the answers to the riddles.  :)
17.16.34 #       <TA> phoe: We will post the log to aminet as well.
17.16.52 #       <Cacique> TA: ah so it's gonna be like jeopardy then eh?

17.18.25 #       <TA> There will be NO /msg to fleecy please. Ask in channel so all can learn.
