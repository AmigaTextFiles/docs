04.04.22 #       <Jamesc> Norway still a kingdom?
04.04.42 #       <Jamesc> Would be a wonderful place for a computer :) I have to keep my computer Room air-conditioned :)
04.04.57 #       <Dozer> Jamesc:  I tried this a lot last night... but you wouldn't happen to know how I can read the LONG names on win95 Cd's?
04.05.06 #       <Dozer> norway is a kingdom, yes..
04.05.31 #       <Jamesc> I've never tried actually... Interesting thought...
04.05.37 #       <Jamesc> Anything on Aminet deal with it?
04.06.01 #       <Dozer> Jamesc: the search function wouln't work...
04.06.21 #       <Jamesc> Ah, yes, that has been a problem of late.. I wonder what's wrong with it...
04.06.28 #       <Dozer> ERROR: Could not connect to find server.. ,(
04.06.55 #       <Jamesc> Hmmm.. About right...
04.07.38 #       <Jamesc> Just did a search on my Aminets INDEX file.. No match on WIN95

04.10.29 #       <Jamesc> I have heard the question before.. Just don't recall if I've heard the answer too :)
04.10.50 #       <Dozer> I know there is a program... some people have heard of it.. but noone has it..
04.11.09 #       <Jamesc> Trick is, that windows 95 stores it's long filenames by cheating... Not too sure how it would do it..
04.11.25 #       <Jamesc> Well they've obviously "Heard" the same things :)
04.11.30 #       <Dozer> ;)
04.11.54 #       <Jamesc> Is there a Web site for AMICDROM or any of the other CDROM drivers?

04.12.51 #       <Dozer> Crossdos can read Win95 filenames... but not on CDs...

06.22.22 #       <Arvid> hello
06.27.18 #       <Dave_C> How';s things
06.27.29 #       <Dave_C> Been catching up on echo mail and the T*A list
06.28.13 #       <Arvid> <-- went to Kansas City to see a movie
06.28.16 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
06.28.17 #       <Arvid> yesterday
06.28.39 #       <Dave_C> whivh movie?
06.29.33 #       <Arvid> Went to see     PI
06.29.52 #       <Dave_C> P.I.  - a private dectective movie?
06.30.48 #       <Arvid> aha .. here goes
06.32.07 #       <Dave_C> P.I.  - Public Indecency?
06.32.56 #       <Arvid> PI is a (very) independent film about a man in New York City who uses his very large home made computer to look for patterns in the value of PI (3.14159.....)  His computer is named Euclid.  He becomes the target of two groups of potentially bad people, some Wall Street types who want to predict the market, and some religious Jews who want to decode the Talmud.  (more to come)
06.33.37 #       <Dave_C> oh... a barely plausible, action adventure, w/ computer overtones.
06.34.18 #       <Arvid> The protagonist also suffers from debilitating headaches, perhaps related to his mathematic genius.  And he has serious trouble dealing with all other people except for an older teacher.
06.35.05 #       <Arvid> I read that the entire budget for the film was $60-thousand ... it won the director's award at Sundance
06.35.33 #       <Dave_C> I remember a story once called 'The Adolescence of P1" about an AI that fullfilled all the prerequistes for life... and escaped onto the internet, propagating it's kernal in a distrubted database on multiple sites around the world.
06.35.49 #       <Arvid> ah I read that story
06.36.04 #       <Dave_C> Now THAT one, I'd like to see made into a screen play
06.36.29 #       <Arvid> I remember that the AI for a while had a huge metallic body
06.36.47 #       <Dave_C> only it would probably have a debilitationg affect on the Internet.
06.37.07 #       <Arvid> I think everything has a debilitating effect on the Internet
06.37.29 #       <Dave_C> Yeah, it was in a college mainframe, then it escaped by modem and RAID'ed itself across the net
06.38.00 #       <Arvid> yeah I need tofind that book again .. I read it .. probably four year ago
06.38.10 #       <Dave_C> I read it 10 years ago...
06.38.14 #       <Dave_C> or more!
06.38.38 #       <Dave_C> AAMOF, it was before I got my AMIGA... closer to 15 years ago.
06.38.48 #       <Dave_C> or more than that... almost 17.,..
06.39.03 #       <Dave_C> I read it while my ex was pregnant, and my son turns 17 this month
06.39.39 #       <Arvid> ah well I am a little behind the times
06.42.43 #       <Arvid> <-- suffers from a lack of coffee .. (away to brew a pot)
06.49.02 #       <Arvid> <-- the coffee is almost ready
06.59.17 #       <Arvid> coffee coffee
07.02.22 #       <Dave_C> PLease distribute this to all the AMIGA BBS's and usergroups you know of
07.02.31 #       <Arvid> oh geez I don't even want to think about running another bbs
07.02.40 #       <Dave_C> It's the latest CNet/BBS demo, w/ 7 day eval keyfile
07.03.16 #       <Dave_C> naaa-- I just wanted to make sure the demo got distributed.

07.03.30 #       <Thrax> hey hey hey
07.03.35 #       <Dave_C> Hi Thrax
07.03.44 #       <Dave_C> You guys still having accell probs?
07.03.49 #       <Thrax> how goes it Dave
07.03.52 #       <Thrax> yup
07.03.55 #       <Dave_C> damn
07.04.17 #       <Dave_C> I was looking forward to helping you guys around in learning CNet/4
07.04.24 #       <Thrax> seams to need a motherboard modification...    heart won't let me use the hammer though
07.04.49 #       <Thrax> we put the gvp ram card back in.
07.04.54 #       * Dave_C is happy as all get out w/ his A2000/o4o
07.05.19 #       * Thrax likes metal case computer
07.05.28 #       <Dave_C> would rather have an o6o, but this one works and I don't feel like spending an arm and a leg.
07.05.43 #       <Thrax> didto
07.06.28 #       <Thrax> unless i can get this warp 40 upgraded
07.06.48 #       <Dave_C> Here's the INstaller Icon for CNET/4
07.07.04 #       <Dave_C> ( Ray has been consistantly forgetting to put it in the packages
07.07.21 #       <Thrax> that really helps
07.07.30 #       <Dave_C> make sure INSTALLER is in C:
07.08.21 #       <Dave_C> and remember, you can now log on to my BBS thru the WWW from your JAVA compatible browser
07.08.27 #       <Dave_C> (from work that is)
07.08.51 #       <Dave_C> It's a little convoluted, but it DOES work
07.09.01 #       <Dave_C> http://gmebbs.cnetbbs.net/bbs/
07.09.04 #       <Thrax> ararar   the ppl at werk think java is expensive coffee
07.09.22 #       <Dave_C> click on JAVA-Telnet button and wait for the app to load.
07.09.41 #       <Dave_C> then click on the active window where it says Connect to BBS
07.10.02 #       <Dave_C> It will then open a telnet console and log you into my site.
07.10.04 #       <Arvid> geez we don't have java appls working on the Amiga but I see that java stuff does work on my Palm PIlot
07.10.25 #       <Dave_C> Try to telnet w/ the PP
07.10.27 #       * Thrax has yet to have his cup of coffee
07.10.35 #       <Dave_C> I bet it's only Java Scritp
07.11.12 #       <Dave_C> The telnet thing I have here has a complet app.wrapper and telnet.class
07.12.16 #       <Dave_C> And I think I've found all the local echo references that were causing it to dupe inputted chars
07.13.23 #       <Dave_C> also, on the latest bout of WB3.5 posts to the mailing lists, I can neither confirm nor deny the existance of a 3.5 workgroup, as that's not where my NDA lies
07.13.43 #       <Dave_C> SO I don't have any info to confirm or deny it.
07.14.11 #       <Dave_C> I can say that the betatesters WG is getting ready to start getting organized.
07.14.22 #       <Dave_C> but it's just starting....
07.14.43 #       <Dave_C> so there's nothing to really discuss, other than "we're ready to try something... when do we get it?"
07.14.48 #       <Dave_C> ;^)
07.15.07 #       <Dave_C> I've already gotten a couple of 'Be patient!" emails
07.15.26 #       * Thrax still waiting after all these years
07.15.46 #       <Dave_C> Thrax: Did you apply for the betatesters WG?
07.15.55 #       <Thrax> nope
07.16.03 #       <Dave_C> jlowery@ibrowse.com
07.16.17 #       <Dave_C> There will soon be a WWW based application.
07.17.02 #       <Thrax> beta test whut...      
07.17.15 #       <Dave_C> whatever AI throws at us

11.54.53 #       * Ogge ponders.. 
11.55.29 #       <[Gemini]> but if i remember corectly they saied that it would neither b motorola or intel, and that it was a company we probably never would have heard about.
11.55.58 #       <[Gemini]> and that we would never guess it :-)
11.56.20 #       <phoe> I saw 'not Intel / AMD / Cyrix'

12.10.27 #       <AmiOS> I''m off   Seeya
12.10.29 #       <HAMLET> Ogge: Where can i get linux for Amiga?
12.10.30 Quit    AmiOS (:Jauda)
12.11.59 #       <Ogge> hamlet, it depends which distro u want to run.. linux m68k, openbsd or netbsd... 
12.13.02 #       <Dave_C> HAMLET: RedHat/m68k is available too.
12.13.14 #       <Dave_C> 4.0, but 5.1 is in the works.
12.13.30 #       <HAMLET> What would you suggest?
12.14.07 #       <Ogge> netbsd... til redhat 5.1 is released.. 
12.14.13 #       <Dave_C> I've heard NetBSD rocks, but the only time I tried to install it, I had a hardware conflict. (multiple SCSI interfaces)
12.14.23 #       <Ogge> netbsd doesn't need any fpu like the others.. 
12.14.34 #       <Dave_C> so I had multipl s0: s1: s2:
12.14.34 #       <Ogge> but uses one if it finds one.. 
12.14.40 #       <Ogge> hehe
12.14.45 #       <HAMLET> My main intention is to get it so i can run linux for coding and debugging of Linux/Unix proggies
12.14.55 #       <HAMLET> Ogge: Does it need a MMU?
12.15.00 #       <Ogge> yep
12.15.15 #       <HAMLET> Then i`m screwed
12.15.24 #       <Dave_C> 030 w/ MMU or better
12.15.33 #       <Ogge> doesn't all amiga linux distros require mmu?
12.15.42 #       <HAMLET> I got the 030.... lack the mmu
12.15.42 #       <Dave_C> I think so
12.16.17 #       <Dave_C> Check the netbsd_amiga site.
12.16.18 #       * HAMLET growls... i should have gone for the blizzard 1230 III 50
12.16.21 #       <Ogge> but it's only netbsd that doesn't require a FPU.. 
12.16.21 #       <HAMLET> That one is with mmu

12.27.39 #       <Dave_C> I have an idea for the european group...
12.28.11 #       <Dave_C> use Darx to ask questions and I'll ask that fleecy paste and answer in the channel (which will be logged of course)

12.31.46 #       <Dave_C> I suggest getting one person to frame the questions saved on Darx, so he doesn't get flooded off before he can say, "HI"
12.32.34 #       <Dave_C> My 1st question would be, "OK, so what CAN you tell us?"
12.32.36 #       <HAMLET> Hehe
12.33.15 #       <Dave_C> 2nd would be to fish for the minimum x86 base requirement for OS4 dev boxes

13.37.54 #       <HMetal> What's the problem with it, Dave?
13.38.06 #       <Dave_C> I think the 5V is horked.
13.38.10 #       <HMetal> got the jumper settings set right for your CPU?
13.38.18 #       <Dave_C> It was a free towercase, y'know

13.44.11 #       <Dave_C> cheap 
13.44.27 #       <HMetal> Ah well..  Still, 16-bit is CD quality so.. :)

14.31.44 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: mine isn't hot even with the 040/40 and only two coolers
14.31.54 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: Not very hot..
14.31.55 #       <Merko> My csppc overheats too..
14.32.09 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: have you tried running it with open casing and pointing a big ventilator at it?
14.32.15 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: What all you got cooling it?  Just the heatsink & the PS fan?
14.32.28 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: yep, just these two
14.32.31 #       <Merko> The 060 gets too hot after a while, so the PPC starts crashing. (!)
14.32.47 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: Did that.  Had a room fan on top of it..  But, in my setup thats not easy to do, as then the monitor is in an awkward position. :(
14.32.50 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: A3000 too?
14.33.09 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: No.. A4k. Open casing atm though, but I don't like it anyway.
14.33.30 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: I understand. :))
14.33.43 #       <Merko> Seems I mostly fixed the problem by putting a stack of coins on the 060 though. :)

14.34.30 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: coins?
14.34.36 #       <Cryto> Merko: Heh. :)  I may remove the fan, see if it does anything..  Maybe its interfering with the PS fan.  Or I will put the cardboard air director I made back on, see if it helps...
14.34.49 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: Nope.  Conner CFP 1080.

14.35.19 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: My two main HD's are in an external casing and these are getting fairly hot...
14.35.27 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: A heatsink?
14.35.34 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: You dont have a HD in the A3k itself?
14.35.44 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: A Quantum LPS105 :))
14.36.03 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: All the other SCSI stuff is connected via the WarpEngine
14.36.09 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: Ah..  I have one of those..  Still think that would get hot tho...
14.36.11 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it? Well, I don't have any heatsinks lying around atm. I'll exchange my current one for a real soon though. ;D
14.36.47 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: I guess it's a cheap alternative for a heatsink (although that surely depends on the type of coins :)
14.37.11 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Well.. the coins get very hot, I take that as a good sign. ;D
14.37.27 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: if air cooling doesn't work, try water... <grin>
14.37.32 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: SCNR :)

14.38.15 #       <Cryto> Oh.. :)
14.38.20 #       <Yoshi2> Cryto: Have you cleaned your PSU fan recently?  or is there some dust that may prevent air from coming in?
14.38.27 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Anyway.. it made things a lot better, that makes it good imo. Not that I want to keep it this way, then I'll surely lift one end of the computer for some reason and make the coins short the motherboard and the csppc at the same time. ;D
14.38.40 #       <Cryto> Yoshi2: Nope.  I cleaned it out a while ago.  Its not too dusty...
14.38.49 #       <Cryto> A bit inside now of course, but the vents are clear.
14.39.06 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: that would be a very expensive mistake...

14.47.00 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: The real fun started in 1990 (I think) when I bought an A500
14.47.36 #       <Yoshi2> ... and I'm glad I didn't get into some other platform...
14.48.30 #       <Merko> A friend of mine bought an A500 in 1992, he showed me DPaint3 and Lemmings and I got one immediately. :)

15.06.45 #       <Cryto> I've never seen it either.
15.09.28 #       <[Gemini]> well... u should, im impressed, running full scren animation of the CD at a good speed

15.11.27 #       <Merko> :(
15.12.20 #       <[Gemini]> but the game is only animations
15.12.47 #       <Seed> Yes, the game is pretty simple.. FMV
15.13.34 #       <[Gemini]> i think its looking quite awsome, cant w8 4 the full game 2 b out :-)
15.14.03 #       * Cryto wishes there would be a Hired Guns II, or a HG map editor/maker..
15.15.00 #       <[Gemini]> who mad Hired Guns?
15.15.06 #       <[Gemini]> made even
15.15.18 #       <Cryto> DMA I think, which was a part of Psygnosis.
15.15.25 #       <Merko> There are games others like that I don't, Frontier for example.. then there's Hired Guns. I'd say it's complete crap, still there are a lot of people who think it's great.. hmm..
15.15.26 #       <Seed> Yes, DMA
15.15.54 #       <Cryto> Merko: I liked HG. :)
15.16.32 #       <Merko> Cryto: Yeah, I kinda figured that out. ;D

15.21.10 #       <[Gemini]> i liked Frontier, even if it had some bugs and were quite limited in the gameplay :-)
15.21.40 #       <[Gemini]> but almost all trading games r limited
15.23.24 #       <Merko> Well, yeah.. some have a storyline though that makes you want to get further.. frontier had nothing of that. Only 10000000000 different stars with random names and parameters. ;D

18.12.34 #       <TA> heh ... they were foaming at the mouth because 'someone' told thenm that we are doing a 3.5 update and making ClassAct the gui of choice IN the OS?
18.14.59 #       <Kinners> I wasn't quite sure which rumour you were mentioning before, but I thought it was that one.  Someone made smoe reference to CA, someone esle told their buddies, they went and told someome that CA was going to be in the next OS ... :)
18.17.05 #       <TA> And it started because about a week ago I asked Chris Caldi for his opinion on what we were planning to do and invited him into the project to help us with a programmer's point of view.
18.18.06 #       <Kinners> Ahh
18.18.33 #       <Jamesc> I'm here really TA!

18.19.34 #       <TA> did you get that Jamesc?
18.21.27 #       <Jamesc> Yeah. Fascinating :)
18.21.27 #       <Jamesc> Amiga people have always been good with rumours though. :)
18.22.27 #       <Jamesc> Totally fascinating :)
18.22.52 #       <Jamesc> Can you start a rumour that they should all post me 10 quid if they want to get the latest rumours :)
18.24.31 #       <TA> hehe, I wish that would work for me.
18.24.55 #       <Jamesc> :) Worth a try :) 
18.25.34 #       <TA> There is a 3.5 upgrade project being discussed between Team AMIGA, Mick Tinker and Olaf Barthel. We are looking for a financial backer now.
18.26.07 #       <Jamesc> I heard that rumour! :) Serious :)
18.26.16 #       <TA> It is true.
18.26.38 #       <TA> BUT, what isn't true is that ClassAct has been chosedn as a new GUI for amigados.
18.26.55 #       <Jamesc> Ha ha ha... Takideasy Gary :)
18.28.22 #       <TA> I try ...
18.28.30 ***     Saving seen data "./dancer.seen"
18.29.24 #       <Jamesc> TA, the first thing I, as a developer-hopeful for the new platform, is whack a Siamese card into my IBM .. Correct?
18.29.37 #       <TA> correct.
18.29.53 #       <TA> But, wait until Mick gets the latest one ready.
18.30.13 #       <Jamesc> That will allow my Amiga (On my local network) and the IBM to communicate making a terminal almost out of my IBM into the Amiga.
18.30.26 #       <Jamesc> Mick Tinker.
18.31.21 #       <TA> The Inside-Out/Siamese will use the pc cpu to offload IO operations to thus allowing the Inside-Out to be fatser than a normal 060 amiga.
18.31.58 #       <Jamesc> I'm fascinated by how these things must work..
18.32.09 #       <TA> It will also offload some other operations, but I don't remember which. Mick has the stuff up on his web site I think.
18.32.10 #       <Jamesc> So it still uses the Amiga for some operations??
18.33.58 #       <Jamesc> It must surely require something to be run on the Amiga then.. What is that?
18.34.43 #       <TA> Jamesc: No, the amiga on a card is for running classic amiga apps if you want to.
18.37.14 #       <Jamesc> "Amiga on a card" <> "Siamese" ??
18.37.25 #       <TA> Jamesc: Yes, exactly.
18.37.43 #       <TA> Th ehardware is the amiga on a card. The software is the siamese.
18.40.02 #       <Jamesc> So I need 2 things. "Amiga on a card"(HARDWARE) and this new "Siamese"(SOFTWARE) - 
18.40.15 #       <TA> Mick told me it will be a package.
18.40.32 #       <TA> Should be ready any time now.
18.41.07 #       <Jamesc> This combination of these two things runs as a complete Amiga on my PC? Correct?
18.41.22 #       <TA> yes, correct.
18.41.52 #       <TA> It should have either an 040 or 060, but will run amiga apps faster than either one since it is offloading tasks to the pc cpu.

18.42.43 #       <TA> well, clinton is fixing to pre-empt the Cowboys. I am off to see him make funny faces and squirm. BB later ...
18.42.44 #       <Jamesc> All=or
18.43.07 #       <Jamesc> Okay, have fun :) I shall ruminate on what you've said :) Byee
18.43.17 #       <TA> It will mainly be offloading IO tasks, but Mick says others as well.
