06.50.13 #       <AmicoBoxe> Hello
06.50.33 #       <Arvid> I remain in both channels ....
06.50.53 #       <Arvid> A nice feature of AmIRC ...
06.51.30 #       <AmicoBoxe> I am on mIRC, thats no fun!
06.51.43 #       <Arvid> Having used mIRC, I must agree with you
06.52.17 #       <AmicoBoxe> The layout is the worst thing
06.53.41 #       <Arvid> Amico: there are some other things too
06.54.33 #       <AmicoBoxe> Tell me..-.

06.56.22 #       <Arvid> Amico: the first thing that annoyed me was the size of the archive
06.56.50 #       <Arvid> Amico: then the appearance was also annoying to me (as I am used to AmIRC)
06.57.10 #       <Arvid> Amico: and then the constant crashing on the Pentium 200 I was using
06.57.10 #       <dozer> Arvid: what are we talking about here? :)
06.57.16 #       <AmicoBoxe> Arvid: MUI is the answere then...
06.57.20 #       <Arvid> dozer:  would you believe      mIRC
06.57.36 #       <dozer> mIRC stinks... AMIRC is sooooo much better... 
06.57.55 #       <Arvid> Amico: and then I disliked the default font
06.58.12 #       <dozer> Arvid: I've shown AMIRC to some of my pc-friends.. and they wondered where they could download the Win-version.. :)
06.58.18 #       <Arvid> Amico: and I dislike the way Windows requires the active window to be at the front
06.58.56 #       <Arvid> Amico: and AmIRC allows me (as now .. ) to be on multiple networks 
06.59.13 #       <Arvid> Amico: those are my greatest gripes about mIRC
06.59.42 #       <dozer> Arvid: mIRC allows you to be on several servers too.. but you have to run the program again.. ;/
07.03.19 #       <AmicoBoxe> I agree with you
07.04.40 #       <Arvid> <-- has never been wrong .. well maybe once, when I thought I was wrong

10.33.49 #       <Dave_C> ogge: will do...
10.34.17 #       <Dave_C> harv: I feel similarly about it, especially as he wants it to be their exclusive.
10.34.33 #       <Dave_C> and most of us in the US don't SEE CU, much less get it regularly
10.34.51 #       <Harv_> and have to pay $15 for it.
10.34.59 #       <Dave_C> <nod>
10.35.17 #       <Dave_C> I'm hoping that I can get Bruce at ACS in Atlanta to get me a copy
10.35.33 #       <Dave_C> speaking of which, I better call him today
10.36.41 #       <Harv_> anyway I'm pissed off about that.
10.36.58 #       <Ogge> CU amiga is the only internation mag i can get in my hometown :( and none of the shops selling mags will sell AF in the future :((((((
10.37.09 #       <Harv_> esp. in light of the way CU treated me a while back but that's my personal beef.
10.37.35 #       <Ogge> well i'm off for a while.. cya all later... 
10.37.35 #       <Harv_> ogge why not?
10.37.48 #       <Harv_> tell the bookstore "if you carry it, I'll buy it."
10.37.56 #       <Ogge> harv, well i talked to four of the shops and they say that amiga mags isn't selling good here :(
10.38.12 #       <Harv_> tell them you have a user group and you'll send people in to buy it.
10.38.25 #       <Ogge> that might work.. have to try that.. 
10.38.28 #       <Ogge> :)
10.38.36 #       <Harv_> hey yer in sweden, you HAVE an amiga magazine there.
10.38.50 #       <Ogge> yep i know.. but i prefer english mags.. 
10.38.57 #       <Harv_> oh.
10.39.13 #       <Harv_> well I'll prolly buy the final issue of CU but I won't enjoy doing it.
10.39.21 #       <Ogge> but Amiga Info is still a great mag to read.. but it has some finacial problems at the moment.. 
10.39.22 #       <Harv_> I hate to think I'm putting one cent in tony horgan's pocket.
10.39.43 Quit    Ogge (:Beam me up....)

11.46.43 #       <phoe> Cryto: if you're used to it, it will be...
11.46.47 #       <Dave_C> no hot keys, but it's not like CNet/3 with cryptic commands
11.47.00 #       <phoe> Dave_C: that's a vast improvement then

15.32.25 #       <Agima> :)
15.33.44 #       <Tarasd> does anyone know of a cure for a overheating A3640 card?
15.34.17 #       <Jamesc> Take it out of the oven
15.34.32 #       <Tarasd> LOL
15.37.06 #       <Jamesc> :)
15.37.35 #       <Jamesc> Seriously, just try and improve the airflow around the card
15.37.54 #       <Jamesc> I keep my Amiga in an Air-Conditioned Computer room.. So I cheat rather heavily :)
15.39.20 #       <Tarasd>  is it the '040 or the card it self causeing the probs - it was working ok untill i added a 2nd hd and a emplant board!!!!!!!
15.39.49 #       <Tarasd> btw i know the '040 gets hot
15.42.26 #       <Jamesc> It's probably the 040 board itself.. In my experience, but try and keep it away from the heat source of the HDs... They generate a fair bit of heat alone...
15.44.52 #       <Tarasd> i just wanted to know if i change processor card
15.45.09 #       <Tarasd> and keep the '040
15.46.45 #       <Tarasd> to tell how bad the prob is the board has a full sized fan (from the psu) and the case has to be left open

17.12.19 #       <Dave_C> a lot more readable
17.12.20 #       <TA> good deal.
17.12.49 #       <Dave_C> I also mailed him about the driver thing.
17.12.56 Quit    Tarasd (:bye bye, maybe sometime soon I'il talk to you again)
17.13.14 #       <TA> just had one hell of a rain here. Having problems staying online, so if I bounce out, you guys know why.
17.13.30 #       <Dave_C> He said as soon as they tell him what cards for A/V they plan to use (probably something GW uses and has a bunch of), he'll let me know
17.13.54 #       <Dave_C> other than that, the rest of the TXPro will be fine.
17.14.23 #       <Dave_C> probably RIVA or similar
17.14.39 #       <Dave_C> no clue on the audio tho.
17.16.06 #       <Dave_C> looks like the whitebox method will come out about $100-200 below the projected price point for the Devbox
17.16.14 #       <Dave_C> well, for me at least.

17.19.26 #       <Agima> I think an official mag from anyone would be a good idea
17.19.30 #       <TA> I used to do that, don't want to anymore.
17.19.37 #       <Dave_C> If they want up to date news, w/o lead times, they should get on the net.
17.19.47 #       <TA> Agima: That just takes away from all the few mags we have?
17.19.59 #       <TA> Dave_C: Correct.
17.20.03 #       <Agima> True I guess
17.20.08 #       <Agima> Dave_C : Agreed
17.20.10 #       <TA> or sign up with Asha, Joanne, or Harv.
17.20.18 #       <Dave_C> the worse part about the mags is the damned leadtime

17.20.46 #       <Dave_C> by the time their exclusive is printed, it's old news
17.20.48 #       <TA> by then it ain't news.

19.24.28 #       <WarNPeace> hesido they only have to identify if the mask does not match one they have on the access list
19.24.53 #       <Eyesy> i'm too tired goodnight all

19.34.21 #       <hesido> the nickserv is not the way it should be, IMHO (not about the access thing): on my local server, nickserv doesn't exactly act like an existent nick, you can msg him as if he is a nick, but a query window doesn't open when he replies back, as if it is a server message.
19.35.01 #       <hesido> so anyone here who can solve the problem?
