12.04.16 #       <Madrox> [X_MaN]: wonder why?
12.04.17 #       * [X_MaN] hasnt read X`s since he left england 6 years ago:(
12.04.35 #       <[X_MaN]> apparently as Amiga is going to follow a more software approach
12.05.11 #       <Madrox> [X_MaN]: we've finally got a decent x comic in uk now, called Essential X-Men. it reprints the american comics rather than adapting the comic series or crap like that
12.05.15 #       * [X_MaN] is trying to take this all without smiling
12.06.02 #       <Madrox> [X_MaN]: which, the comics or JoeT? :)
12.06.18 #       <[X_MaN]> Funny how a company making a hardware reference platform doesnt need a hardware director;)

12.07.37 #       <[X_MaN]> Abslutely nothing, I am not interested in 3.5 at all
12.07.43 #       <Madrox> [X_MaN]: we recently had AOA reprinted over here, but not in it's entirety, natch :/
12.07.54 #       <[X_MaN]> AOA?

12.09.12 #       <[X_MaN]> DrJekyl:and even if I was running Amiga, what will I do with 3.5? Nothing of significance will ever be written to take advantage of it, it is stop gap and pointless
12.09.15 #       <DrJekyl> [X_MaN]: fair enpugh
12.09.49 #       <[X_MaN]> DrJekyl:it isnt compatible with Os5
12.10.08 #       <DrJekyl> [X_MaN]: I know :)
12.10.55 #       <[X_MaN]> DrJekyl:thats why I am not interested, now if it IS, a predeccessor to 5, then 3.5 might be worth a look
12.12.11 #       <[X_MaN]> DrJekyl:but Im betting the 3.5 and 5 development is done completely in secret one from the other, so API`s dont work...
12.13.45 #       <Madrox> heh, won 10 quid on the lottery :)

14.01.21 #       <[arvid]> Ndk  hmm
14.02.12 #       <NdK> Hi Yoshi2, do you have any experience setting up a monitor for a grpahics card?
14.02.21 #       <Merko> NdK: What numbers? Don't you have a manual for the Iyama?
14.02.34 #       <[arvid]> Yoshi2:  hello
14.02.35 #       <NdK> yes I have a manual
14.02.40 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: What do you need to setup?
14.03.02 #       <NdK> I need to set up an Iiyama monitor for use with a CVision
14.03.19 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: I setup my A1438 with Picasso96
14.03.41 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: Is there something that doesn't work?
14.03.43 #       <Merko> NdK: Well, you should be able to find the horizontal frequency range, that one is the most important.. then you can choose one of the preset modes.
14.03.51 #       <NdK> ok, how do I figure out the best settings for each resolution?
14.04.02 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: "Trial & error"
14.04.09 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: at least that's what I did
14.04.13 #       <Merko> NdK: Well.. what do you mean with "best"?
14.04.46 #       <NdK> well, the pixel clock is 160 MHz, should I always go as close as possible to that number?
14.05.05 #       <Merko> No.
14.05.21 #       <NdK> explain please ;-)
14.05.43 #       <Merko> Well, what is wrong with the current settings? If it aint broken, don't fix it. ;D
14.06.13 #       <NdK> The current settings don't go beyond 1152*8-something
14.06.35 #       <NdK> I want to be able to use all resolutions at the highest possible refresh rates ;-)
14.07.03 #       <Merko> NdK: What card is it?
14.07.21 #       <NdK> CyberVisionPPC
14.08.08 #       <Merko> Cool.. I'll get mine next week I hope. :)
14.08.24 #       <Merko> Anyway.. what's your horizontal frequency range?
14.08.46 #       <Yoshi2> Anybody else experienced problems with YAM 2.0 p5 when downloading mails (it just locks after downloading the first message)?
14.08.48 #       <Merko> Probably something like 30kHz-86kHz, it should definately be mentioned in the manual..
14.08.55 #       <NdK> 27-96kHz
14.09.04 #       <Yoshi2> this only happened twice with this mail now, not before
14.09.04 #       <Merko> NdK: Nice monitor. :))
14.09.12 #       <Merko> NdK: 17"? 19"?
14.09.19 #       <NdK> 17
14.09.49 #       <NdK> hmmmm, the Iiyama site claims it is 27-92kHz

14.10.38 #       <NdK> I already entered these values in CGXMode
14.10.50 #       <NdK> the problem is the settings for each resolution
14.11.07 #       <Merko> NdK: Well, try to find some driver on www.vgr.com.. then modify that one. Of course you can play around, but I wouldn't want to damage that monitor you have. :)
14.11.59 #       <NdK> I downloaded the driver for the previous version of this monitor, but it has som mighty strange resolutions and I don't know if that is safe.......
14.13.15 #       <NdK> I mean: 2000*1500 is not supported as far as I know ;-))
14.13.16 #       <Merko> NdK: Check that Pixel clock (Video band width) is <160MHz, and that all modes have a horizontal frequency <92KHz (they should! :)
14.13.37 #       <Merko> Wow.. that's a cool resolution. :)
14.13.58 #       <NdK> ok, good tip. But how do I know I have the best settings possible ?
14.14.22 #       <Merko> No idea.. I've tried 1600x1200 on the cv3d, worked fine, only 50Hz though. I didn't think it supported that high resolutions either..
14.14.45 #       <Merko> NdK: You don't.. unless you know a lot about monitors. ;D
14.14.56 #       <Yoshi2> If you select a setting that is "too good", the monitor will either not display it, or display garbage.
14.15.26 #       <NdK> hmmmm. So the main trick is to just try and make _damn_ sure you are not over the specs of your monitor?
14.15.32 #       <Merko> NdK: Just find some resolution that you like, you probably don't want to use the highest possible anyway..
14.16.33 #       <Merko> NdK: Then of course you want the refresh rate to be high enough.. perhaps 85Hz or so. And finally it might be a good idea to tweak 8, 16 and 24bit modes with the same resolution so that the monitor doesn't resync when flipping such screens.
14.16.58 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: I found the best modes for my A1438 by trying out the frequencies until the monitor didn't display them anymore
14.17.02 #       <NdK> good tip again

14.29.12 #       <NdK> Hi!
14.29.13 #       <NdK> I just asked a question about my graphics card.
14.29.15 #       <NdK> But now I have another question about it.
14.29.16 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: Does your monitor still work :)
14.29.35 #       <NdK> yes it is fine, thanks ;-)
14.29.40 #       <NdK> I studied an example monitor file I found on www.vgr.com
14.29.41 #       <NdK> and it has resolution of 320*256 and 640*512. Those are amiga resolutions!
14.29.45 #       <NdK> I don't understand this, I thought VGA monitors only supported a set of
14.29.45 #       <NdK> standard resolutions? (I mean for each 3 pixels from left to right you must
14.29.45 #       <NdK> have 2 pixels down or something)
14.29.46 #       <NdK> Did this make any sense? Where do I make a wrong conclusion?
14.30.22 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: AFAIK a monitor can display any resolution the graphic chipset can feed it
14.30.36 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: But I'm no monitor expert :)
14.30.57 #       <NdK> So you mean I could make a resolution of 643*485 or something?
14.31.09 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: I suppose
14.31.17 #       <NdK> And this is something else as overscan?
14.31.49 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: Honestly, I don't know.  I guess it can be done, but I'm clueless as to how... :-/
14.31.56 #       <NdK> complicated....
14.31.57 #       <NdK> headache ;-(
14.32.14 #       <Merko> Maybe the VGA only has standard resolutions, but that's MS stupidity.. monitor makers are fortunately not totally hexed by the MS empire. =D
14.33.27 #       <Merko> NdK: I think any width divisible by 32 is ok. And any height. I have 320x256, 320x240, 320x200, 320x512, etc..
14.33.49 #       <NdK> hmmm. as far as I understand the monitor technique, I would not think this is possible. guess I am wrong then ;-)
14.34.12 #       <NdK> I thought a monitor would have a preset amount of pixel-points
14.34.18 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: Don't know.  I could be wrong without even realizing :)

14.34.37 #       <Merko> Well, works fine here at least.. some modes can't be set to fill the entire screen here though, but 320x256 does for example.
14.35.03 #       <Merko> NdK: Expensive? How?
14.35.03 #       <NdK> ok, I'll just try it then
14.35.11 #       <NdK> waaaaay expensive ;-)
14.35.48 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: If you turn of the monitor very quickly (or get rid of the screen that causes problems), it's almost impossible to damage the monitor...
14.36.27 #       <Yoshi2> NdK: the "bad" frequencies only do real harm when you display the screen for longer than just a few seconds, I guess
14.36.51 #       <NdK> That's the same trick I tried with my girlfriend but she wouldn't have it....   >-)

14.37.51 #       <Yoshi2> Merko: I played with it quite a but when I got the A3000 w/ PicassoII, but didn't damage my A1438 at all.
14.39.26 #       <Merko> Yoshi2: Well, there's no warnings at all in my monitor manual.. but then perhaps they don't expect the users to experiment with new screenmodes.. only meant for PC and Mac ppl. ;D

14.58.24 #       <[SteaG]> StG : Aargh !

14.58.32 #       <Seed> Hi TA
14.58.36 #       <TA> mornin'
14.58.41 #       <StG^sNTx> what happens is that i get the normal reset after a sec or two, but then it just keeps resetting
14.58.45 #       <Jamesc> Morning TA! :)
14.58.45 #       <NiteFlite> Afternoon.
14.58.49 #       <[SteaG]> Hi TA !
14.58.52 #       <StG^sNTx> g'night:)
14.59.01 #       <TA> heh!
14.59.16 #       <Jamesc> Ah aren't Timezones fantastic :)
14.59.38 #       <StG^sNTx> Jamesc: sure is:)
15.00.04 Quit    NiteFlite (:http://www.cais.com/)
15.00.53 #       <StG^sNTx> [SteaG]: any idea of what it could be?
15.01.23 #       <[SteaG]> [StG] : Do you use the same configuration ?
15.02.33 #       <StG^sNTx> yes.. think it happened after I disabled it to try shapeshifter. Had to use prepareemul, but when i switched back itdidn't work. have reinstalled the entire package, but without luck
15.04.46 #       <[SteaG]> [StG] Maybe a problem in the options... My command line is : BLIZZMAGIC [my kickfile with its path] STARTUP NOSKIPFLASH NOSKIPOFF
15.06.04 #       <StG^sNTx> [SteaG]: hmm.. I use exactly the same line now as when it worked...
15.08.31 #       <StG^sNTx> [SteaG]: I guess I'll just have to live with it:\
15.09.12 >>>     "sview" by StG^sNTx (~sjurm@ti02a03-0020.dialup.online.no)
15.09.30 #       <[SteaG]> [StG] : Maybe a conflict with another command ??
15.09.32 >>>     "cmd" by StG^sNTx (~sjurm@ti02a03-0020.dialup.online.no)
15.10.31 #       <StG^sNTx> [SteaG]: I've though of that, but have tried to shrink the startup down to a minimum without success
15.11.35 #       <TA> StG^sNTx: Best way to success is to backup what you have now, and go back with a new install of a clean startup.
15.13.12 #       <StG^sNTx> TA: I guess I could try that, even if I'm 99% sure what I have in my startup-sequence has anything to do with it
15.13.40 #       <[SteaG]> StG^sNTx : Maybe a corrupt kickfile ?
15.13.42 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: What board?
15.14.14 #       <StG^sNTx> [SteaG]: tried another one..
15.14.24 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: bliz IV 030/50
15.15.12 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Hmm.. I think a friend got it working with exactly that board. Or perhaps two friends even..
15.16.55 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: It used to work here 2.. just disabled it for a moment to run shapeshifter, and then it wouldn't work afterwards
15.18.23 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: ztrange..  sure you didn't change something by accident?
15.18.53 #       <TA> StG^sNTx: Maybe SS changed something when you installed it?
15.19.14 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: not that I can work out, nope..
15.19.55 #       <StG^sNTx> TA: I re-installed blizzkick afterwards, and I'm sure my startup is "ss-clean"
15.20.20 #       <TA> StG^sNTx: What about devices, libs, etc?
15.20.35 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: I guess you didn't change the jumpers on the card by accident either.. ;D
15.21.44 #       <StG^sNTx> TA: could be I guess, but i have no way of knowing which or what
15.21.52 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: nope:)
15.22.04 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Btw, what happens when you try to rekick now?
15.22.33 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Hmm.. I just read back in the history.. hmm..
15.22.35 #       <TA> StG^sNTx: Check the installer script from SS. It may give you a clue. I think it messes with your devices. I'd start there first. Look for references to devs:
15.22.41 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: :)
15.23.17 #       <StG^sNTx> TA: I'll do that.
15.23.49 #       <StG^sNTx> thnx for your help guys. Will let you know how it worked out tomorrow:)
15.24.01 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: I can't see why that should make any difference.. there has to be something in the startup-sequence before blizkick that messes with resident stuff..
15.24.15 #       <[SteaG]> StG^sNTx : What's your version of BlizMagic ?
15.24.20 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: there's nothing before blizkick in the startup
15.24.48 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko:  blizmagic is the name btw:)
15.24.54 #       <StG^sNTx> [SteaG]: ang on
15.25.06 #       <TA> StG^sNTx: Good luck !!
15.25.21 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Ah. well, you can try Blizkick then if you can't get it to work. :)
15.25.33 #       <StG^sNTx> it's 3.3
15.26.03 #       <StG^sNTx> Merko: is it the same thing?
15.26.43 #       <Merko> StG^sNTx: Yeah, a softkicker.
15.27.00 #       <[SteaG]> StG^sNTx : Ok ! My version of BlizMagic is 3.3 too
15.27.10 #       <Merko> Dunno which is best.. I only ever used Blizzmagic, but I've heard Blizzkick is better.
15.27.41 #       <StG^sNTx> k:) you've given me loads to think about. I'll surely give it another go 2morrow

16.12.28 #       <Merko> Woo.. that's a lot of news to me! :)
16.13.05 #       <Merko> Darn. I'm already swamped by mailinglist mails.. spent 2 hours today catching up.. :/
16.13.12 #       <Seed> Ta: Braille support in OS3.5! And right away! :)
16.13.15 #       <TA> Joe Torre has left AI to persue other interests back in Atlanta. He felt his hardware talents were being wasted since AI is mainly doing software development.
16.13.51 #       <TA> Merko: Fell free to forward any requests or ideas to gpeake@wt.net as well.
16.13.57 #       <TA> feel even.
16.14.51 #       <TA> Hardware development is still planned to be offloaded to third parties by Amiga Inc.
16.15.01 #       <DrJekyl> TA: have you heard anything of 3.5 yet ?
16.15.11 #       <TA> DrJekyl: Yes ...
16.15.22 #       <TA> :)
16.15.32 #       <DrJekyl> TA: ok /msg...
16.17.13 #       <TA> OK, here is the scoop. Team AMIGA is spearheaduing an effort to get AI, Mick Tinker, Olaf Barthell, and possibly the ICOA involved in a OS3.5 upgrade. I can't say more than this yet, but things look hopeful. Chris Caldi may also be involved.
16.18.06 #       <Seed> Ta: I think it's spelled "Barthel"
16.18.12 #       <TA> We do NOT have word back on whether all parties agree to our proposal.
16.18.36 #       <TA> Seed: Sorry, my 2 finger typing isn't always fool proof.  :)
16.18.51 #       <Seed> TA: :)
16.19.11 #       <Merko> He spells it "Barthel", that's right. The swedish Amiga mag wrote "Havemouse" on the front cover in big letters, so I guess you're forgiven. ;D
16.20.34 #       <Seed> As long as no-one improperly spells my full name, it's ok :)
16.23.45 #       <TA> believe it or not, Peake gets miss-spelled all the time. I have grown used to it.
16.24.12 #       <Seed> TA: Yes.. and so is Seedney Poitier :)

16.32.26 #       <TA> Well, he IS gone now.

16.32.48 #       <Seed> TA: Can I have his shoes, then? :)
16.32.59 #       <Merko> Hmm. I missed it. Doesn't sound very good..
16.33.22 #       <TA> Joe Torre has left AI to persue other interests back in Atlanta. He felt his hardware talents were being wasted since AI is mainly doing software development.
16.33.44 #       <Jamesc> Pick pick pick pick pick. 
16.33.53 #       <Jamesc> I'm usually _working_ at the keyboard :)
16.34.43 #       <TA> Jamesc: Ahhh, sorry for the mis-statement then.  :) I alwasy assumed you were catching 20 winks.
16.34.55 #       <Merko> Hmm.. he isn't on www.amiga.com. He used to be, right?
16.35.07 #       <Jamesc> I just can't resist having an Amiga channel operative, but also have programming to do :)
16.35.16 #       <Seed> Merko: he was there
16.35.16 #       <TA> Merko: Joe signed on as the Hardware development manager.
16.35.45 #       <TA> Jamesc: What do you do? What are you working on if we can ask?
16.36.30 #       <Seed> He's writing a program that simulates sleep.. one day he'll run it instead of sleeping :)
16.36.32 #       <Merko> TA: Well.. what makes me a bit sceptical is that they don't seem to have anything but managers at AI currently.. who is supposed to do the work? ;D
16.37.01 #       <TA> Merko: Allan has a crew offsire working steadily on the OS developent.
16.37.09 #       <TA> offsite that should be.
16.37.23 #       <TA> in seclusion.
16.37.48 #       <TA> and the rest are actually 'working' managers.
16.37.57 #       <Merko> TA: Alright.. do you know anything about this crew? How many are they? How long have they been working? Why don't we get to know they exist?
16.38.50 #       <TA> Merko: I can't say much about them. That is totally off limits NDA stuff. 
16.39.25 #       <Merko> TA: Of course I know they are working.. but the impression you get from www.amiga.com is that there are like 2 people supposed to get a half-working OS out by november.. hmmmmm..
16.40.14 #       <TA> Merko: That is the impression Ai wants those outside the amiga community to have. Some things are just not what they appear, on purpose.
16.41.02 #       <Jamesc> Various Projects Seed :) A Waste Management System, Web Development Project, Amiga-based net interfaces, and most recently - The new AOS.
16.41.09 #       <Merko> TA: Sorry, but I don't think that makes sense.. anyone even remotely interested in the activities of AmigaInc already knows far more than I do.
16.41.33 #       <Jamesc> AOS stands for Australasian Online Services Registry... www.aos.ggcs.net.au - It's a new version of the old BBS Registry which has run in Australia for years.
16.41.42 #       <TA> We don't want to believe it but what is happening at Gateway/Amiga Inc is of great interest to competitors like Dell, ComPaq, IBM, etc
16.42.15 #       <Seed> I'm going to retire.. see you all tomorrow
16.42.46 #       <Jamesc> If I can get onto the development group for the new Amiga, I'd like to try some ideas out on it too...
16.42.50 #       <Merko> see(d) you :)
16.43.03 #       <TA> Bill McEwen told us at Amiwestthat AI intends to stay 'way below the radar' of all competitors until it is time to show them all what they have.
16.43.03 #       <Jamesc> But of course, I'll have to be accepted by "The powers that be" first :)
16.43.32 Part    Seed
16.44.24 #       <Merko> TA: I'm sure some IBM 'spies' have already investigated AmigaInc, and I'm sure they found all the info I did, plus more.. the only people they might be fooling are the Amiga users and the general computer press.. not the big companies.
16.45.14 #       <TA> Merko: You may be right, but that is the nature of the business. Dell and Compaq operate the same way unfortunately.
16.50.22 #       <TA> Dell is currently working on a 400mhz rambus card. We won't see that printed anywhere's either until it is ready for sale.
16.51.03 #       <Merko> Well, I already heard about it anyway. ;D
16.51.30 #       <Jamesc> What I find interesting at the moment, is considering what I might be working on in 6 months time..
16.51.38 #       <Merko> The reason they don't blow the big trumpets yet is of course that it would harm their current sales..
16.52.16 #       <TA> Merko: Reason #2 is that it would also tip off the competition and get them heading in the same direction.
16.52.51 #       <TA> Jamesc: In 6 months time, that could be almost anything imaginable!
16.53.23 #       <Merko> TA: I don't think so. YMMV.
16.53.51 #       <TA> YMMV?
16.54.25 #       <Jamesc> Well I hope it will be on the new Amiga OS and be Comms/Net based :) 
16.54.31 #       <Jamesc> With a Database backend...
16.54.51 #       <Merko> Oh.. "your mileage may vary".. not entirely appropriate I suppose.. but I didn't find any better acronym, and I'm tired. ;D
16.57.24 #       <TA> Merko: Develmental companies also operate under the guise of paranoi as well ... :)
16.57.42 #       <DrJekyl> TA: if this is such a big thing abd would " tip off the competition and get them heading in the same direction." then why are *they* dealing with AI ?
16.58.41 #       <DrJekyl> makes no sense to help a pennyless company when IBM and others could invest in the development
16.58.55 #       <TA> "they" are mainly who?
16.59.19 #       <DrJekyl> *they* being the new "super chip" developers
16.59.45 #       <DrJekyl> or have I lost the thread here ? :)
16.59.58 #       <TA> Ahhh, because Gateway is not penniless and is helping in the development I feel certain.
17.00.37 #       <DrJekyl> TA: so the "super Amiga" will be a Gateway thing not an AI baby then ?
17.00.52 #       <Merko> There is another good reason too.. if IBM found out that such a chip would harm their developments, they might justbuy it and cancel it.
17.01.07 #       <TA> DrJekyl: No? Where did you get that?
17.01.22 #       <DrJekyl> TA: <TA> Ahhh, because Gateway is not penniless and is helping in the development I feel certain.  :)
17.01.25 #       <Merko> So, it's only logical for them to stay clear from big CPU makers..
17.01.50 #       <DrJekyl> Merko: that makes sense :)
17.01.59 #       <TA> DrJekyl: AI gets it's money support from Gateway. Dealing with one is dealing with the other in a financial sense.
17.02.27 #       <TA> That should be money/support
17.02.52 #       <Merko> Probably they have approached other companies too though, I don't exactly expect the new Amiga to be the only machine using that chip. I'm not sure I'd want it to be..
17.03.23 #       <TA> Merko: Nor would I . The more widely used it is, the more apps we may have that cross over.
17.03.30 #       <DrJekyl> TA: but if AI develope a platform that can out perform a PC then they could buy themselves out of gateway and Gateway would loose out. and I don't think Gateway will let this happen some how :)
17.04.31 #       <TA> DrJekyl: That is not how daughter companies are set up/registered in the US. AI can NOT buy themselves out of Gateway. There has been no stock offerings. Gateway owns it totally.
