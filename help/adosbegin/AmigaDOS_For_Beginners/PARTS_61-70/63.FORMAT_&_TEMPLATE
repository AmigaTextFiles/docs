@{B}@{U}General Discussion@{UB}@{UU}

The AmigaDOS manuals all tend to use the @{"FORMAT & TEMPLATE" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Format"} at the start
of the command description.

A typical "Format" is:-

  TYPE {<file|pattern>} [TO <name>] [OPT H|N] [HEX] [NUMBER]

and its equivalent "Template" is:-

  FROM/A/M,TO/K,OPT/K,HEX/S,NUMBER/S

First I will discuss @{"formats" LINK "Format"} without reference to templates. Then I will
discuss @{"templates" LINK "Template"} and refer back to the equivalents in formats to give
you a better idea of how the two line up.

@NODE "FormGeneral" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - General Discussion"

@{B}@{U}General discussion On FORMAT@{UB}@{UU}

The format has a number of items in it such as:-

@{B}COMMAND@{UB} - This is the actual AmigaDOS command being explained, e.g. the
TYPE in this format example:-

  TYPE {<file|pattern>} [TO <name>] [OPT H|N] [HEX] [NUMBER]

The meaning of all the symbols <> {} [] | are covered in the section
@{"Symbols Used" LINK "Symbols"}.

@{B}KEYWORD@{UB} - This is an additional part of the Command Syntax that gives
the command some information about the way in which it should operate,
e.g. the @{B}TO@{UB} in the above format example.

@{B}KEYWORDS@{UB} @{"may or may not" LINK "Symbols"} be necessary in the command line. If they are
@{B}not@{UB} essential, they are @{"inferred" LINK "Inferred"} by the position of the arguments.

@{B}COMMANDS & KEYWORDS@{UB} are shown in UPPER CASE to distinguish them from
arguments. However, their case can be upper or lower when used by you. The
@{B}spelling@{UB} of commands and keywords must be exactly as shown.

@{B}OPTIONS@{UB} are additional instructions that can be used at the users option.
In the above example, the part of the format reading:-

  [OPT H|N] [HEX] [NUMBER]

are optional extra instruction to the TYPE command.

@{B}OPT@{UB} is a keyword used in a lot of commands. It indicates that one or more
options are available following the OPT keyword. For example:-

  TYPE [FROM] {<file|pattern>} [OPT H|N]

This OPT indicates that the command line may include one of:-

  TYPE filename OPT H
  TYPE filename OPT N

(See @{"symbols" LINK "Symbols"} for explanations of the {} an |.

@{B}ARGUMENTS@{UB} - These are items that are inserted by the user to give AmigaDOS
some information about the way the command should work or, for example,
the file name on which to carry out the command.

Arguments can be @{"Strings" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Strings"} or numbers, strings being the most common.

For example, in the command line:-

  TYPE startup-sequence

The "TYPE" is the command and the "startup-sequence" is the string used
as the argument. It is the file name that you want AmigaDOS to "type".

Arguments are usually shown in lower case to distinguish them from commands
and keywords.

The text of arguments is determined by the user and thus is not normally
the word shown in the manuals. The word used is merely an indication to
the user of the type of insert that should be made at that spot. For example,
in:-

  TYPE {<file>}

The "{<file>}" would indicate that the name of a disk file should be
inserted in lieu of "{<file>}" (see @{"symbols" LINK "Symbols"} for explanation of the {<>}).

Thus, if you wanted to type the startup-sequence file, you would use:-

  TYPE startup-sequence

The case (upper or lower) of the argument may or may not be important.
This will have to be determined by the context of the instructions.

@NODE "Symbols" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - Symbols Used In Format"

@{B}@{U}Symbols Used In FORMAT@{UB}@{UU}

Whereas the COMMAND is always necessary, other parts of the format may
be optional. This is indicated by the use of the symbols shown below.

In particular, the @{B}KEYWORDS@{UB} may, in many cases, be omitted. In such cases,
they are @{"inferred" LINK "Inferred"} by the position of the arguments.

In the following, I am using the TYPE command as an illustration but, at
the start, it is not the complete format. I will build up to the complete
format by the end.

    @{" <> Angle Brackets            " LINK "<>"}
    @{" [] Square Brackets           " LINK "[]"}
    @{" {} Curly brackets, or Braces " LINK "{}"}
    @{" |  The vertical Bar          " LINK "|"}
    @{" =  Equal Sign                " LINK "Form="}


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "<>" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - <> Symbol"

@{B}@{U}<> Angle brackets@{UB}@{UU}

These are used to enclose arguments that @{B}must@{UB} be included. For example,
if you saw:-

  TYPE <file>

it would indicate that a file name @{B}must@{UB} be included.


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "[]" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - [] Symbol"

@{B}@{U}[] Square brackets@{UB}@{UU}

These enclose keywords and arguments that are @{B}optional@{UB}. For example, if
you saw:-

  TYPE [FROM] <file>

it would indicate that you can omit the FROM keyword if you like but the
<file> must be included because it is in @{"<>" LINK "<>"}.

If a Keyword is @{B}not@{UB} in square brackets then it @{B}MUST@{UB} be included. For example
(this is only part of the full format):-

  FORMAT DRIVE <drive> NAME <name>

The "DRIVE" and "NAME" keywords are @{B}not@{UB} in [] so you @{B}must@{UB} use these keywords.
The "<drive>" and "<name>" are in @{"<>" LINK "<>"} so you @{B}must@{UB} provide arguments in
these spots. For example:-

  FORMAT DRIVE df1: NAME MyDisk


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "{}" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - {} Symbol"

@{B}@{U}{} Curly brackets, or Braces@{UB}@{UU}

These indicate that the item can be used once only or a number of times.
For example, if you saw:-

 TYPE [FROM] {<file>}

it would mean that you could include more than one file name in the TYPE
command line. Thus:-

  TYPE file1 file2

can be used to first type "file1" then "file2".


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "|" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - | Symbol"

@{B}@{U}| The vertical Bar@{UB}@{UU}

This symbol is just to left of back space key. Use shifted \\ to get it.

It separates two or more options of which you can choose one. For example,
if you saw:-

  TYPE [FROM] {<file|pattern>} [TO <name>] [OPT H|N]

it would mean that you could use either a @{B}file name@{UB} or a @{B}pattern.@{UB}

(Patterns are explained in the article @{"Pattern Matching" LINK "ADB:Parts_21-30/22.PATTERN_MATCHING/MAIN"}.)

Also, it would mean that you could use either of:-

  TYPE filename OPT H
  TYPE filename OPT N

In other cases the "|" will represent two alternate keywords both of which
can do exactly the same thing. For example (this is only part of the full
format):-

  FORMAT DEVICE|DRIVE <drive> NAME <name>

The "DEVICE|DRIVE" means that you can use @{B}either@{UB} DEVICE @{B}or@{UB} DRIVE to do
exactly the same thing.

This sort of thing is often the result of later versions of AmigaDOS
introducing a new keyword which better covers the situation but the old
keyword is left available for compatibility with scripts written prior to
the new version. In the FORMAT example, the DRIVE keyword will work in all
versions but DEVICE will only work in versions 2.1 onwards.

@NODE "Inferred" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - Keywords Inferred By Position"

@{B}@{U}Keywords Inferred By Position@{UB}@{UU}

A lot of commands have the keywords in @{"[]" LINK "[]"} to indicate that they need not
be used. For example, in the COPY command, whose format, in part, is:-

  COPY [FROM] <name> [TO] <name>

you need not use "FORM" and "TO" @{B}provided that@{UB} you have the names in the
correct positions. So, if you use:-

  COPY name1 name2

AmigaDOS will @{B}infer@{UB} that "name1" is the file to copy from as it is in
the @{B}FROM@{UB} position. As "name2" is in the @{B}TO@{UB} position, it @{B}infers@{UB} that it
is the name to be given to the file after it has been copied.

You can reverse the order of the names @{B}only if you do@{UB} use the keywords,
as in:-

  COPY TO name2 FROM name1

AmigaDOS now knows that the names are no longer in the normal positions
and will copy from "name1" to "name2".

I do not recommend reversing in this manner as you may end up confusing
yourself.

@NODE "Form=" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - FORMAT - The = Sign"

@{B}@{U}Use of the = Sign in Formats@{UB}@{UU}

@{B}=@{UB} The @{B}equals@{UB} sign is sometimes used to indicate that you should insert a
value after the keyword. For example (this is not the full format):-

  COPY [FROM] <file> [TO] <file> [BUFFER=n]

This is saying that you can use:-

  BUFFER=number       e.g. BUFFER=100

to tell AmigaDOS to set up "number" (e.g. 100) buffers during the copy
process.

@{B}Note@{UB} that the @{B}=@{UB} is used in a @{B}different@{UB} way in @{"TEMPLATES" LINK "Temp="}.


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Template" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES"

@{B}@{U}TEMPLATES@{UB}@{UU}

Templates are, supposedly, a sort of abbreviated format. It is what is
available when you enter the command followed by a question mark(?). For
example, if you entered:-

  > TYPE ?

you might see:-

  FROM/A/M,TO/K,TO,OPT/K,HEX/S,NUMBER/S

(The exact things you see will depend on the workbench version that you
have.

Having already discussed formats, I will now compare the template with
the format to give you a better idea of the meanings.

The following symbols are used in Templates:-

    @{" /A   " LINK "A"} All AmigaDOS Versions
    @{" /K   " LINK "K"} All AmigaDOS Versions
    @{" /A/K " LINK "AK"} All AmigaDOS Versions
    @{" /M   " LINK "M"} Version 2.0 Onwards
    @{" /S   " LINK "S"} All AmigaDOS Versions
    @{" /N   " LINK "N"} Version 2.0 Onwards
    @{" /F   " LINK "F"} Version 2.0 Onwards
    @{" =    " LINK "Temp="} All AmigaDOS Versions

@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "A" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /A"

@{B}@{U}/A@{UB}@{UU}    All AmigaDOS Versions

This means that the argument must always be used but the keyword need not
be used. In the TYPE format and template, these are the same thing:-

  Format:-    [FROM] <name>
  Template:-  FROM/A

Thus you can use either of:-

  TYPE FROM startup-sequence
  TYPE startup-sequence

but in either case you @{B}must@{UB} use the file name argument.

@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "K" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /K"

@{B}@{U}/K@{UB}@{UU}    All AmigaDOS Versions

This indicates that, although the option need not be used, if it @{B}is@{UB} used,
the keyword must be used with it. In the TYPE format and templates these
are the same things:-

  Format:    [OPT H|N]
  Template:  OPT/K

Thus, if you use OPT option then you @{B}must@{UB} use the keyword "OPT" as well
only one of "H" or "N". For example:-

  TYPE file OPT H
  TYPE file OPT N


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "AK" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /A/K"

@{B}@{U}/K/A@{UB}@{UU}    All AmigaDOS Versions

When these two are shown together the @{"/A" LINK "A"} is saying that the argument
@{B}must@{UB} be used and the @{"/K" LINK "K"} is saying that the keyword @{B}must@{UB} be used with
the argument. In the FORMAT command format and template these are the
same things:-

  Format:    NAME <name>
  Template:  NAME/K/A

In the format, the "NAME" is @{B}not@{UB} in [] so the keyword @{B}must@{UB} be used and
<name> indicates that an argument must be used with the keyword.

In the template, the "/K/A" indicates that you @{B}must@{UB} use both the argument
@{B}and@{UB} its keyword.

@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "M" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /M"

@{B}@{U}/M@{UB}@{UU}    Version 2.0 Onwards

This indicates that multiple arguments can be used. In the TYPE format
and template, these are the same thing:-

  Format:    FROM {<name>}
  Template:  FROM/A/M

Thus you could ask for one file name, as in:-

  TYPE file1

or a number of names, as in:-

  TYPE file1 file2 file3

@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "S" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /S"

@{B}@{U}/S@{UB}@{UU}    All AmigaDOS Versions

This indicates an optional switch. If one of the keyword options is used
it "switches" the output to one thing. If another keyword options is used
it "switches" the output to another thing. In TYPE format and template
these are the same thing:-

  Format:    [HEX] [NUMBER]
  Template:  HEX/S,NUMBER/S

The use of "HEX" or "NUMBER" will "switch" the normal output to:-

  HEX -     hexadecimal mode

  NUMBER -  normal but with line numbers at the start of each line


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "N" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /N"

@{B}@{U}/N@{UU}@{UB}    Version 2.0 Onwards

This indicates that the argument, if used, must be a number. In the COPY
format and template the following two lines mean the same thing (these
are only parts of the format and template):-

  Format:    COPY [FROM] <file> [TO] <file> [BUF|BUFFER=n]
  Template:  FROM/M,TO/A,BUF=BUFFER/K/N

In the format the "BUF|BUFFER=n" says that you can use either of:-

  BUF=number
  BUFFER=number

and in the template the "BUF=BUFFER/K/N means the same thing.

@{B}NOTE@{UB} the @{"different meanings" LINK "Temp="} of the "=" in the Format and the Template.


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "F" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - /F"

@{B}@{U}/F@{UB}@{UU}    Version 2.0 Onwards

This indicates that the @{"string" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Strings"} used in the argument must be the final
thing on the command line and everything on the command line from there
onwards will be taken as part of the string argument. For example:-

  ALIAS NAME,STRING/F

means that after the @{"ALIAS" LINK "ADB:Parts_31-40/34.Alias/MAIN"} command you include a NAME then a string that
that NAME will represent. As the "/F" is used it means that everything
after NAME is the string and that you do not need to include the string
in quotation marks even though there may be spaces in the string.

There does not seem an equivalent in for "/F" in the formats.


@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Temp=" "Part 63 - Formats & Templates - TEMPLATES - = Sign"

@{B}@{U}The = (Equal) Sign@{UB}@{UU}    All AmigaDOS Versions

The @{B}equals sign@{UB} is used in Templates in a different way to the way it
is used in @{"Formats" LINK "Form="}. It is the equivalent of @{" | " LINK "|"} in the format. In the
FORMAT command format and template these are the same (this is not the
full format and template):-

  Format:    FORMAT DEVICE|DRIVE <device> NAME <name>
  Template:  DEVICE=DRIVE/K/A,NAME/K/A

These mean that you can use @{B}either@{UB} DEVICE @{B}or@{UB} DRIVE to get the same result.
For example:-

  FORMAT DEVICE df1: NAME MyDisk
  FORMAT DRIVE df1: NAME MyDisk
