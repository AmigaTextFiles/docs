@NODE "Conclip" "Part 65 - Miscellaneous Startup Commands - CONCLIP"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}THE CONCLIP COMMAND@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

@{B}Location@{UB}     - "c" directory

@{B}Purpose@{UB}      - To make available the ability to copy text from the
               console device to the clipboard device and then paste it
               into another window

@{B}Availability@{UB} - AmigaDOS Versions 2.0 Onwards

As you probably know, from AmigaDOS Version 2.0 onwards, you can highlight
text in a console window by dragging the mouse pointer over the text with
the left mouse button held down then copying it by pressing RIGHTAMIGA/C

The copied text can then be pasted into the same or another window by
pressing RIGHTAMIGA/V.

The windows being copied from and pasted to must both be ones that support
such actions. The Shell and ED windows both allow it. Some third party
programs also have windows that can act in this way.

This system is set up by using the CONCLIP command. However, for it to
work your system must have the following files present:-

  LIBS:iffparse.library
  DEVS:clipboard.device

The usage for CONCLIP can be one of:-

  CONCLIP

  CONCLIP UNIT number
  CONCLIP number

  CONCLIP OFF

  CONCLIP UNIT number OFF
  CONCLIP number OFF

The keyword UNIT is optional so that:-

  CONCLIP UNIT 1
  CONCLIP 1

are identical in action. Both turn unit 1 on,

and:-

  CONCLIP UNIT 1 OFF
  CONCLIP 1 OFF

are identical in action. Both turn unit 1 @{"OFF" LINK "Conclip"91}.

If used without a unit number, the default unit 0 is used:-

  CONCLIP       turns unit 0 on
  CONCLIP OFF   turns unit 0 off

There 256 available unit numbers ranging from 0 to 255

The default unit 0 is the one set up in the normal @{"startup-sequence file" LINK "ADB:Parts_71-80/71.Startup-Sequence_Files/2.0"93}.

You can change the number to any of the other 256 units. For example, to
change to unit 1 you would use:-

  CONCLIP 1

If you used this after unit 0 was set up at startup, anything previously
copied to unit 0 would be preserved and all copying would then be to
unit 1. You could then retrieve the text in unit 0 by using:-

  CONCLIP 0

and anything in unit 1 would be preserved.

All this would be rather tedious if done manually in a Shell/CLI window.
However, if you want to be able to preserve a lot of clips in different
units, there are utilities available to do the job for you. Two of them
that I know about (there could well be others) are:-

  CBE (Clip Board Enhancement)   Shareware by   Anthony Moringello
  ClipHistory                    Freeware  by   Magnus Holmgren

Both are available on Aminet web sites and CD-ROM disks in the directory
"util/cdity".

Some programs also have the ability to select various clipboard units
but offhand I cannot think which ones they are.

@{B}The OFF Option@{UB} can be used to turn off CONCLIP. What then happens is the
you can still copy and paste but the copied text is NOT written to the
clipboard. So, if you had text in the clipboard unit 0 (the default unit)
that you wished to keep there, you could enter:-

  CONCLIP OFF

then do a copy and paste, then enter:-

  CONCLIP

and the original text in unit 0 will again be available.

@NODE "IPrefs" "Part 65 - Miscellaneous Startup Commands - IPREFS"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}THE IPREFS COMMAND@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

@{B}Location@{UB}     - "c" directory

@{B}Purpose@{UB}      - To load the preferences that have been set up in
               the various individual preference programs.

@{B}Availability@{UB} - AmigaDOS Versions 2.0 Onwards

In AmigaDOS Version 1.3 and earlier all preferences were set up from a
single preferences program.

From Version 2.0 onwards, this was replaced with individual preference
programs to cover things like printers, fonts, palette, screen mode and
many more.

IPrefs will activate all the individual preferences settings that the user
has up in the individual programs.

Its usage is simply:-

  IPREFS

without any options.

It is normally used only in the @{"startup-sequence file" LINK "ADB:Parts_71-80/71.Startup-Sequence_Files/2.0"83}.

@NODE "AddDataTypes" "Part 65 - Miscellaneous Startup Commands - ADDDATATYPES"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}THE ADDDATATYPES COMMAND@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

@{B}Location@{UB}     - "c" directory

@{B}Purpose@{UB}      - To set up all the datatypes in the Devs:Datatypes
               directory

@{B}Availability@{UB} - AmigaDOS Versions 3.0 Onwards

From AmigaDOS Version 3.0 onwards, the old AmigaGuide was replaced by
MULTIVIEW. Whereas AmigaGuide could read only text files, Multiview is
capable of displaying a lot more types of files such as pictures, sound and
animations.

The files stored in Devs:Datatypes are "descriptor" files which tell
Multiview (and any other programs written to take advantage of datatypes)
how to load the various types of files.

The file "LIBS:datatypes.library" must be on your boot disk to make use of
datatypes.

It is normally only used in the @{"startup-sequence file" LINK "ADB:Parts_71-80/71.Startup-Sequence_Files/3.1"169} in this way:-

   ADDDATATYPES REFRESH QUIET

The simple syntax for the command is:-

   ADDDATATYPES

It can be used with these options:-

   FILES
   QUIET
   REFRESH

@{B}The FILES Options@{UB} allows you to add a datatype to the list from a specific
file that may not be in the DEVS:Datatype drawer. For example:-

   ADDDATATYPES Diskname:Datatypes/MyNewDatatype

If this is used in the Shell/CLI window or from, say, an installation
script, then this new datatype would then become available until the Amiga
is reset.

@{B}The QUIET option@{UB} prevents any error or other messages from being displayed

@{B}The REFRESH option@{UB} will scan the Devs:Datatypes directory for new or
changed files and add them to the list. It could be used after a new
datatype file is copied to that drawer.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "LoadResource" "Part 65 - Miscellaneous Startup Commands - LOADRESOURCE"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}THE LOADRESOURCE COMMAND@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

@{B}Location@{UB}     - "c" directory

@{B}Purpose@{UB}      - To load resources (e.g. libraries, devices, etc.)
               into the resident list to make them available without having
               to reload them from disk.

@{B}Availability@{UB} - AmigaDOS Versions 3.1 Onwards

Files from the LIBS: directory and the DEVS: directory are normally not
loaded from disk into memory for usage by programs until a program first
calls upon that library or device. They can then remain in memory in case
that program or another program needs them (unless a program specifically
flushes the library or device from memory).

The LOADRESOURCE program can be used to load the library or device into
memory BEFORE any other program calls them. In this way faster access is
obtained or, for a floppy disk system, the workbench disk can be removed
but the library or device still be available.

The drawback is that every library or device loaded takes up RAM space.

It can be used in one of these ways:-

  LOADRESOURCE
  LOADRESOURCE filename(s)
  LOADRESOURCE filename(s) LOCK
  LOADRESOURCE filename(s) UNLOCK

When used with "filename(s)" alone:-

  LOADRESOURCE filenames(s)

those nominated files will be loaded from disk into RAM and will be
available for any program calling them. This usage is illustrated in the
Version 3.1 @{"startup-sequence file" LINK "ADB:Parts_71-80/71.Startup-Sequence_Files/3.1"203}. This startup usage is the normal place
for it.

@{B}The LOCK option@{UB}:-

  LOADRESOURCE filename(s) LOCK

will lock the file into memory and prevent it being flushed.

@{B}The UNLOCK option@{UB}:-

  LOADRESOURCE filename(s) UNLOCK

will unlock any locked files and allow them to be flushed from memory if
they are not currently being used. You will recall that the use of
@{"AVAIL FLUSH" LINK "ADB:Parts_41-50/49.Avail/Flush"} will flush unused libraries etc. as will some other programs.

When used without options, it displays the names of LOCKed resources. For
example:-

  > LOADRESOURCE

  -->
      TYPE     NAME

      Library  libs:arp.library
      Library  libs:amigaguide.library

This would indicate that the two files listed had been loaded using:-

  LOADRESOURCE libs:arp.library libs:amigaguide.library LOCK

@NODE "SetMapKey" "Part 65 - Miscellaneous Startup Commands - SETMAP & SETKEYBOARD"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}THE SETMAP & SETKEYBOARD COMMANDS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

@{B}SETMAP@{UB}       @{B}Location@{UB}     - "Sys:System" directory

             @{B}Availability@{UB} - AmigaDOS Versions 2.0 and earlier

@{B}SETKEYBOARD@{UB}  @{B}Location@{UB}     - "c" directory

             @{B}Availability@{UB} - AmigaDOS Versions 2.1 onwards

@{B}BOTH COMMANDS@{UB}

@{B}Purpose@{UB}      - To load a particular keymap for use by the system.

Both these commands are virtually the same - they load a nominated keymap
for use by the system. A keymap is a file that tells the system which
characters to assign to the various keys on the keyboard.

Their usage is simply one of:-

  SETMAP filename

  SETKEYBOARD filename

where "filename" is the name of a keymap (including its path if necessary).

In @{B}AmigaDOS Versions 2.0 and earlier@{UB}, SETMAP was used in the
startup-sequence files in these ways:-

  @{"Version 1.3 and earlier" LINK "ADB:Parts_71-80/71.Startup-Sequence_Files/1.3"48}

  @{"Version 2.0            " LINK "ADB:Parts_71-80/71.Startup-Sequence_Files/2.0"124}

@{B}In AmigaDOS Versions 2.1 and later@{UB} SETKEYBOARD is NOT used in the
startup-sequence file as the keymap is set with the "Input" preferences
program and the desired keyboard is set up by the @{"IPrefs" LINK "IPrefs"} command.

Both commands can be used in a Shell/CLI window or in a script if a
temporary change is to be made to the keyboard map.
