USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - FORMATTING OF TEXT@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
The text in these articles has been formatted with some text:-

  In @{B}bold@{UB} text

  With @{U}underlined@{UU} text

  @{JCENTER}Centred text
@{JLEFT}

If the above three lines are @{B}NOT@{UB}, respectively, in bold underlined
and centred, then you have an early version of the file amigaguide.library.

Bold and underlining is available from version 39 onwards.

Centring is available from version 40 onwards.

If you have an earlier version, then the formatting will not be as
good as it could be. However, I trust that this will not prevent you
from getting the full benefit of the articles.

If you notice that, in some articles, there is a gap between the line
"=== End of Text ===" and the end of the window then @{B}DO NOT@{UB} go into the
file and delete this space!! It is there because some instances of
@{"cross referencing" LINK "Cross"} can be to some of the last lines of a node. If the
space (blank lines) was not there then the cross reference link would go to
a line before the intended line.

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - THE ADB: ASSIGNMENT@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

When you double click on the INDEX icon, an @{"AmigaDOS script" LINK "ADB:Index/Main"} is activated
which includes this line:-

  ASSIGN >Nil: ADB: ""

This ensures that the assignment to ADB: is made to WHATEVER directory
the INDEX file is in. The system does not need to know which hard drive
partition of drawer your "AmigaDOS For Beginners" articles are in. All
reference to them throughout the index and cross references in these
articles is to the @{B}ADB:@{UB} assignment.

Provided that you copied the whole "AmigaDOS_For_Beginners" drawer to your
hard drive without removing or altering any of the files or directories
that are in it then you should have no problems.

If you are just a beginner, then there is no need to worry about this any
further at this stage. However, when you come to the @{"ASSIGN" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/20.Assign/Special"} article I will
have a cross reference back to this section so that you can read it then
with more understanding.

However, if you @{B}are@{UB} interested in reading further now, then by all means
go ahead and click on @{"ASSIGN" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/20.Assign/Special"} .

USING AMIGAGUIDE OR MULTIVIEW@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
I have @{B}NOT@{UB} included a default tool of either AMIGAGUIDE or MULTIVIEW in
the INDEX icon. If I had then those without the program that I had included
would have had to change the default tool.

In any case, I wanted to use an @{"AmigaDOS script" LINK "ADB:Index/Main"} to allow an assignment
of @{"ADB:" LINK "Assignment"}, so the same script can decide whether to use AMIGAGUIDE or
MULTIVIEW. Of course, if you have MULTIVIEW then that will be used in
preference to AMIGAGUIDE!

When you double click on the INDEX icon, the following lines from the
@{"AmigaDOS script" LINK "ADB:Index/Main"} are activated:-

  WHICH >Nil: Multiview
  IF NOT WARN
    RUN >Nil: Multiview ADB:Misc/Index.Text
    SKIP End
  ENDIF

  WHICH >Nil: Amigaguide
  IF NOT WARN
    RUN >Nil: Amigaguide ADB:Misc/Index.Text
    SKIP End
  ENDIF

The AmigaDOS command WHICH will return a code of 5 if the program is not
found in the path. If it is found, a return code of 0 is given and the
lines after "IF NOT WARN" are operated.

Thus, it looks for MULTIVIEW first. If it is in the path, then that is
used and the script skips to the end.

If MULTIVIEW is @{B}not@{UB} found, then a test for AMIGAGUIDE is made and that
is used if it is found.

If @{B}neither@{UB} are found then this part of the script is reached:-

  ECHO "*nNeither MULTIVIEW nor AMIGAGUIDE have been found in your
        system's path."
  ECHO "Please click on the file *"PATH SETTING*"."

  ASK "*nPRESS THE RETURN KEY TO CONTINUE"

The file @{"Path Setting" LINK "ADB:Path_Setting/Main"} will give an explanation of how to proceed.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS

THE AMIGAGUIDE OR MULTIVIEW WINDOW & A SHELL/CLI WINDOW@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

I originally arranged for the Amigaguide or Multiview (AG/MV) window to
open in the top two thirds of the screen and for a Shell/CLI window to
open in the bottom third.

However, as different people have different sizes and types of screens,
a window set up that suited one person would not suit another person.

As it is handy to have a Shell/CLI window open to practice AmigaDOS as you
read about it, and to run the example scripts, I would suggest that you
follow these steps:-

1. Change the size and position of this window so that it takes up
   the top two thirds of your screen. The best size is one that has about
   24 lines of text in it as this will ensure @{"cross referencing" LINK "Cross"38} is done
   correctly. Any other number of text lines might result in some of the
   cross references going to incorrect lines.

   If your version of AG/MV has a menu item:-

       Settings    or    Prefs

   with a sub menu item:-

       Save As Defaults

   then select that sub menu item and the window will always open at that
   size/position.

   See also @{"Window Size and Line Lengths" LINK "Window"}.

2. Open a Shell or CLI window and position it in the bottom third
   of the screen

   To have a permanent Shell/CLI window on your workbench screen
   you can alter your "S:User-Startup" file as I have done.

   I use a "MULTISCAN:Productivity" screen size 656 x 480.

   I have a command line using in my "User-Startup" file to @{"start" LINK "ADB:parts_01-10/06.NewCLI-EndCLI/Specification"} a new
   Shell which reads as follows:-

      NEWSHELL "CON:0/320/656/160/AmigaShell OS 3.1/Close"

   This opens a new shell window in the bottom third of the screen.

   If you are using a standard "PAL:Hi Res" screen size 640 x 255
   then you could use this command line:-

       NEWSHELL "CON:0/175/640/80/AmigaShell OS 3.1/Close"

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - THE GLOSSARY@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
I have included a glossary of terms that can be accessed by clicking with
the left mouse button on highlighted words within the text of the articles.
An example of this is the word @{"Format" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Format"} mentioned earlier.

There is also an @{"index" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Main"} to the glossary items so that you can read them
at any time independently of the articles.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - CROSS REFERENCING@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
There is a lot of cross referencing in these articles and glossary notes.
Clicking on a highlighted item could take you to a glossary item or
another article. You might then click on a cross reference in the new
display thus ending up a long way from where you started. You could even
end up with the same article or glossary item that you started off from!

To go back to where you started from just keep clicking on the "Retrace"
gadget until you get there.

OR - you can click on one of the following buttons in the
     Amigaguide or Multiview window (if they are not shaded):-

     INDEX    - to take you straight to the MAIN INDEX

     CONTENTS - to take you to the first page of the document
                currently being read.

                The CONTENTS button can be useful if you have followed a
                cross reference to a node that is @{B}not@{UB} the first page of a
                document. Clicking CONTENTS will then take you to that
                first page.

@{B}SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CROSS REFERENCING@{UB}

In most cases, the cross referencing will take you to the start of an
Amigaguide "Node", i.e. the first line of that part of the article being
displayed. These cross references usually withstand subsequent corrections
to the text.

However, in some cases the cross reference will be to a particular line
within the node, i.e. at some point beyond the first line. This is done
by nominating a line number in the @{B}hidden@{UB} links.

There are a couple of reasons why cross referencing to a particular line
within a node may take you to an unintended line.

Firstly, your Multiview/Amigaguide window needs to be of a size to display
about 24 lines of text. Other window sizes may give incorrect cross
referencing when the referenced line is close to the end of the node.
@{B}This is a fault with Multiview/Amigaguide, not with my editing!@{UB}

Secondly, as there are inevitably corrections to be made, the particular
line that I am aiming to jump to may have shifted from where it was when
the link was a created. If this happens, then you will be sent to a part of
the document a bit removed from the intended part.

I have done my best to correct such links. However, not being @{B}quite@{UB}
perfect ;-) I may have slipped up at times. If the cross reference does
not seem correct, then just scroll up or down a few lines.

It would appreciated if you could @{"let me know" LINK "ADB:Misc/Read_Me_First!!/Author"} of any such errors

@{JLEFT}
It is recommended that the new user should start at the beginning and
work through the articles in the order set out in the menu:-

  @{" Part 1 - Contents in Sequence " LINK "ADB:Misc/Index.Text/Part-1"}.

In that way, the reader should not often come across commands or usages
that have not already been explained. If later articles are read before
previous ones then the reader may come across unexplained concepts.

However, the use of a command not yet covered is, at times, unavoidable.
On these occasions I have done my best to try to explain what is going on.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - ARTICLE DESIGN@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
The contents of "AmigaDOS For Beginners" are split into various articles.
Some articles will deal with only one topic or command. Other parts will
deal with a number of related commands. In all cases I have tried to make
the individual parts as logical and as self contained as possible.

The articles are held in directories named for the numbers of the articles
they hold. For example:-

  Directory name:- Parts_01-10
  Holds articles:- 1 to 10

All @{"examples scripts" LINK "Examples"} relating to an article are held in the same directory
as the article.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - WINDOW SIZE & LINE LENGTHS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

I have @{"already mentioned" LINK "Windows"15} that your Multiview/Amigaguide window should be
sized to show about 24 lines of text.

As not all people use the same versions of Amigaguide or Multiview, I
cannot rely on the Amigaguide command WORDWRAP to properly word wrap
paragraphs. (WORDWRAP only works with amigaguide.library v39 and later).

I have therefore formatted the articles so that each line that appears
in the window has a maximum of 75 characters with a line feed at the end
of each line rather than only at the end of each paragraph. This should
allow each line to be displayed in a window that has the same width as your
screen provided that you are not using a font size bigger than 8.

Of course, if a @{"cross reference" LINK "Cross"} takes you to read an @{"example script" LINK "ADB:Parts_41-50/Example-47.1/Main"} file
that is an actual AmigaDOS script rather than a copy of it within an article
then you could very well have text going beyond the right edge of the
window. If I put line feeds into the scripts to make them fit in the
window then it would corrupt the script and it would not work!

But if lines are extending beyond the right edge of the window when reading
the articles you may have to do one or more of:-

- widen the window to the full width of the screen

- reset your screen preferences to a width of 255 pixels at least

- reset the "Fonts" preferences to set the "system Default Text" font
  to a size of 8 or less.

If you are using the standard preferences that came with your Amiga then
you should not have any problems.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS

USING AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - EXAMPLE SCRIPTS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
At times I have example scripts in an article. These scripts are also
saved to disk as separate files. This is to save you typing in the script
yourself. The script files have the same number as the article number,
followed by a number indicating whether it is example number 1 or number 2,
etc., for that article. For example, the article:-

   30.QUIT

has these three example scripts:-

   Example-30.1
   Example-30.2
   Example-30.3

The example script files are in the same directories as the articles
to which they belong.

Except for Examples 33-1, 33-2 and 33-3, none of the example script files
have icons. These three only have icons because they are there to illustrate
how to operated scripts from an icon (See @{"ICONX" LINK "ADB:Parts_31-40/33.IconX/MAIN"} article).

@{B}Changing The Current Directory@{UB}

To use the example scripts, go to your @{"Shell/CLI" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/CLI_&_Shell"} window and use the
@{"AmigaDOS" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/AmigaDOS"13} command @{"CD" LINK "ADB:Parts_01-10/07.CD/Main"} to change the current directory to that in which the
examples are held. To do so, use one of these command lines:-

  > CD ADB:Parts_01-10
  > CD ADB:Parts_11-20               @{B}Note@{UB}   ADB: is a  @{"logical device" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/LogicalDevices"}
  > CD ADB:Parts_21-30                      that is assigned when you
  > CD ADB:Parts_31-40                      @{"first double click" LINK "Assignment"} on the
  > CD ADB:Parts_41-50                      INDEX icon.
  > CD ADB:Parts_51-60
  > CD ADB:Parts_61-70
  > CD ADB:Parts_71-80


@{B}Executing The Scripts@{UB}

Provided that you have already used the CD command to change the current
directory, all you need do to execute the desired example script is to
enter in the Shell/CLI window:-

  > ScriptName

For example, to execute Example-27.1 you would enter:-

  > Example-27.1

If you get one of these messages (which, in all likelihood, you will @{B}not@{UB}
get @{B}unless@{UB} you are using AmigaDOS @{B}v1.2 or earlier@{UB}):-


 With @{B}v1.x@{UB} - Unable to load Example-xx.x: file is not an object module.
 With @{B}v2+@{UB}  - Example-xx.x: file is not executable

then try entering:-

  > Execute Scriptname

Then have a read of the section of @{"Part 25 - Setting The `S' Bit" LINK "ADB:Parts_21-30/25.Script_Files/Setting"}.

Don't worry too much about it now. By the time that you have read through
to the first script example in the article @{"SCRIPT_FILES" LINK "ADB:Parts_21-30/25.Script_Files/MAIN"} you should have
a far better idea of how to enter the above example command lines.

AmigaDOS @{B}v1.2 and earlier@{UB} users @{B}must always@{UB} use the EXECUTE command even
when the text of the articles say just to enter the script name.

@{JLEFT}
In learning to write scripts, it is far better to try things out for
yourself and learn by the mistakes you will inevitably make. I make them
too! I have found that seeing @{B}why@{UB} the mistake has occurred is a great way
to learn not to make the same mistake again!

So, after reading my examples, if an idea strikes you then have a go at
writing a script and trying it out.

Can you assume that if you do things differently than I do then you got it
wrong? @{B}NO!!@{UB}

There are many ways of doing the same job. It will be inevitable that
your scripts will be a bit different to mine.

Will mine be better than yours? @{B}NO!!@{UB} not necessarily. In fact, yours might
well be better than mine! I do not always write a perfect script!

So look at ALL the ways of doing the same job and see if you can work out
the best way and @{B}learn@{UB} by the comparisons. Analysing scripts written by
other people is another great way to learn how to write scripts.

@{JLEFT}
This note is for all those who use American spelling.

In Australian we use the British conventions for spelling and so these
articles were spell checked using a British dictionary.

So, if this is being read by Americans, you will find things like:-

   analyse    instead of    analyze

   centre     instead of    center

   colour     instead of    color

etc. etc.

After all it @{B}is@{UB} the @{B}ENGLISH@{UB} language ;-)

However, I will not guarantee it is all spelt correctly even in the British
conventions. All typographical mistakes will be blamed on "Bee Bee", our
Blue Burmese kitten who insists on sitting on my lap or walking over the
keyboard while I am typing!

If you find spelling and/or grammatical errors @{" I " LINK "ADB:Misc/Read_Me_First!!/Author"} would appreciate
your advice.
