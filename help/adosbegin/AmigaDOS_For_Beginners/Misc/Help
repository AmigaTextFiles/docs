All the indices and articles on this disk use the "Amigaguide" or
"Multiview" program to send the text to screen. In nearly all cases, the
text will not fit into the window that is opened. I have put an indicator
which reads:-
@{JCENTER}=== End of Text ===
@{JLEFT}
at the end of each article so that you can be sure that you have reached
the end.

There are about 73 documents (all separate disk files) in this set of
articles (not including the various supplementary text files).

Most of the documents have a menu and/or highlighted text that will take
you into the various NODES of the document. A node is what you reach when
you click on some highlighted text. The window will NOT display the whole
document (unless, as is the case for a few of the documents, the document
only has one node!). It will only display the contents of the node
currently being read.

Don't forget that @{B}wherever@{UB} you see some text @{"highlighted like this" LINK "Testing"} anywhere
in any of the indices or articles you can read more information by clicking
on the highlighted text.

In the index files this will let you read the article you are pointing to.

In the articles this might:-

- take you to another part of the document you are reading,
- take you to another document,
- let you read explanations from the glossary.

When reading any of these documents, you can use the buttons at the top
of your Amigaguide or Multiview window as follows:-

CONTENTS   to take you to the FIRST PAGE @{"of the document" LINK "Documents"13}
           (this will be shaded if already at the first page).

INDEX      to take you to straight to the MAIN MENU
           (this will be shaded if already at the main menu).

HELP       to read this help file or, if already reading this file,
           to take you to the main Amigaguide or Multiview help page.

RETRACE    to take you to the node previously read.
           (this will be shaded if at the first node read).

BROWSE <   to take you to the previous @{"node in the document" LINK "Documents"13}.
           (this will be shaded if already at the first node).

BROWSE >   to take you to the next @{"node in the document" LINK "Documents"13}.
           (this will be shaded if already at the last node).
