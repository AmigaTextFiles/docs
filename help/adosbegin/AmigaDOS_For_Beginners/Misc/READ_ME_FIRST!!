FREEWARE VERSION@{ub}@{uu}
@{JLEFT}
"AmigaDOS For Beginners" is now FREEWARE but still @{"Copyright" LINK "ADB:Misc/Read_Me_First!!/Copyright"}.

The reason for this is that it is now out of date as it does not cover
the latest version of AmigaDOS (v3.5) and I have no intention of updating
it at this stage or in the foreseeable future.

I never thought I would reach this stage but I feel that the Amiga has well
and truly "missed the boat" and is too far behind other computer technology
to be realistically usable in the ever changing world of computers and the
internet.

Maybe one day the present owners will change all this but I cannot afford
to wait and see and I am not willing to spend any more time or money on my
Amiga until the unbelievable happens and a new Amiga emerges that can
really compete with modern computers.

So, in the meantime, use it freely for non-profit purposes and enjoy!

@{B}What "AmigaDOS For Beginners" IS:-@{UB}

What "AmigaDOS For Beginners" attempts to do is to provide the beginner
with an introduction to the use of AmigaDOS by providing information and
examples of the AmigaDOS commands in a way that takes the user through
various commands and their main options without getting too tied up in
their @{"format and template" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Format"}. In my experience, most beginners cannot quickly
understand the formats and templates given in texts about AmigaDOS. By
following through these notes, it is hoped that the beginner can become
familiar with the main options of most commands without needing to worry
too much about formats and templates.

So... whereas I may not always give you the @{B}FULL@{UB} story about an AmigaDOS
command all in the one article I @{B}WILL@{UB} attempt to cover it all by the time
you have read through to the last article. However, if you want the full
story all at once, all you need to do is double click on the highlighted
references to follow through to later articles and read the whole story.

@{B}"AmigaDOS For Beginners" is NOT@{UB} a replacement for the AmigaDOS manual.

While every AmigaDOS @{"command" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Commands"} is covered, "AmigaDOS For Beginners" is @{B}not@{UB}
intended to be a @{B}full and definitive@{UB} description of the @{"format or template" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Format"}
of all these commands. If you want that sort of thing then read the
AmigaDOS manual.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}NON AMIGAGUIDE VERSION FOR WB 1.x@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

I have a non Amigaguide version that uses a hypertext program called
"HT" which works reasonably well under Workbench 1.3 and earlier.

However, @{B}BE WARNED@{UB} that this is an early version of "AmigaDOS For Beginners"
and there may be omissions and inaccuracies in it. In particular, it does
@{B}NOT@{UB} take into account any changes in AmigaDOS from @{B}Version 3.0 onwards@{UB}.

I @{B}DO NOT@{UB} intend to waste time going through it looking for any such
omissions and inaccuracies. The demand for this version would be far too
small to warrant it.

If you order this version, I will NOT be held responsible for any such
omissions and inaccuracies.
