@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - GLOSSARY

DOS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
DOS was originally an acronym for Disk @{"Operating System" LINK "OpSystem"}. Some say it should
be "Disk Based Operating System" as it does a lot more than operate a
disk and that it was really an operating system based (stored) on a disks.
Some say it should be @{"Device" LINK "Devices"} Operating System. These days a lot of the
operating system is hard coded into the Amiga's @{"ROM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Rom"} chips so that it is
no longer disk based. It is best to forget that DOS ever stood for
anything.

@{B}AmigaDOS@{UB} is the term applied to Amiga's equivalent of MS-DOS (see below)
that is used on IBM compatible computers.

AmigaDOS is not just a set of commands nor is it just a @{"Shell or CLI" LINK "CLI_&_Shell"} window.
It is the software side of the Amiga's complete operating system. It
controls all the functions of the computer such as multitasking, peripheral
control and disk filing systems.

IBM Compatible computers use@{B} MS-DOS@{UB} or, as IBM users often call it, DOS
for short. (They don't seem to realise that there are others types of
computers!). The MS stands for MicroSoft, the company that produces the
MS-DOS system.

The two types of DOS (AmigaDOS and MS-DOS) are@{B} not@{UB} compatible but have
many similarities in command names and usage. The comments made above
about AmigaDOS could be equally well applied to MS-DOS.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - GLOSSARY

AREXX@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
ARexx is a programming language.

It is the Amiga version of the IBM language "Rexx".

It is a programming language somewhat similar to BASIC in the way programs
are written and executed through an interpreter but quite a bit different
to BASIC in its capabilities.

The ARexx manual says:-

   "... it can act as a hub through which applications  -  even those
     created by different companies - can exchange data and commands".

Thus it can be used to tell one program to do things like pass commands
or data to another program, or to receive commands or data from another
program. This is known as "Inter Process Communication"

A lot of people only use AREXX for writing small programs to communicate
with other programs. However, AREXX can be used for much more than this.
It can be used for writing small or large programs which are fully functional
in their own right.

ARexx has been supplied as a standard part of the Amiga package from
Workbench 2.0 onwards, However, ARexx manuals were only supplied with
Workbench 2.0 and 2.1. Workbench 3.0 and 3.1 did not supply ARexx manuals!!

@{"ARexx For Beginners" LINK "ADB:Misc/READ_ME_FIRST!!/ARB"}, which has been written along the same lines as
"AmigaDOS For Beginners", is available from the same source as "AmigaDOS

ARGUMENTS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
An @{B}ARGUMENT@{UB} is a piece of information entered by the user into a
@{"command line" LINK "CommandLines"} that causes the AmigaDOS command to act in a certain way.

The contents of the argument can be varied at the discretion of the user,
within the guidelines of the syntax of the command, to suit the way the
user wants the command to work. Compare this to a @{"COMMAND" LINK "Commands"} and its @{"KEYWORDS" LINK "Keywords"}
which @{B}cannot@{UB} be varied by the programmer.

Examples of arguments are contained in these command lines:-

  @{B}DIR df0:devs@{UB}

  "DIR" is the command and "df0:devs" is the argument inserted by the user.

  @{B}FORMAT DRIVE df0: NAME MyDisk@{UB}

  "FORMAT" is the command and "DRIVE" and "NAME" are its keywords.
  "df0:" and  "MyDisk" are arguments inserted by the user.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - GLOSSARY

ASCII@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
@{B}ASCII@{UB}, pronounced "Askey", stands for American Standard Code for Information
Interchange. Basically, it is a system of allocating a unique @{"CODE number " LINK "ASCII_Codes"}
for each character such as 65 for "A", 66 for "B", etc. Most computers
store text files in standard ASCII codes thus making them easily
transferrable.

An ASCII file (in word processing or data base terminology) is one saved
without all the special codes such as those used by the word processor
to indicate bold, underlining and other special features or such as those
used by the data base program to indicate column and row information,
formulas, etc. Thus the ASCII file contains only the ASCII codes for the
text itself.

As well as text, ASCII covers covers codes that are not visible on screen
or paper such as "Control Codes".

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - GLOSSARY

BOOTING@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
"Booting" is the process of getting the computer up and running.

To achieve this, the system uses:-

  @{" Kickstart " LINK "Booting-Kickstart"}

and it must be able to find a @{B}bootable@{UB} disk. To be bootable a @{UB}floppy disk@{UB}
must have:-

  @{" Boot Block            " LINK "Booting-BootBlock"}
  @{" Startup-Sequence File " LINK "Booting-Startup"}

A @{B}hard drive partition@{UB} must also have a "Startup-Sequence" file but it
does @{B}not@{UB} have a boot block as such. It is made bootable from within the
"HDToolBox" program that should be in the "Tools" directory of your
workbench disk.

A @{B}cold boot@{UB} is one where the power is turned on after having been turned
off.

A @{B}warm boot@{UB} is one where the power is @{B}not@{UB} turned off. The boot is effected
by a reset with the CTRL-LeftAmiga-RightAmiga keys.

KICKSTART@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
"Kickstart" is a small program that enables the @{"operating system" LINK "OpSystem"} to read
the @{"boot block" LINK "Booting-BootBlock"} of a disk and get the system up and running. Without
Kickstart the computer could not read the boot block and therefore could not
get under way.

In very early Amigas, Kickstart was on a "Kickstart Disk" which you had
to insert before your Workbench disk. Once the Kickstart software was
read into @{"RAM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Ram"} you could put in you Workbench disk and boot up the system.
@{B}Very@{UB} awkward system!!

These days Amigas have the Kickstart software hard coded into the @{"ROM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Rom"}
chips.

BOOT BLOCK@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
A "boot block" is a special area on a floppy disk that contains the
instructions necessary for the computer's @{"operating system" LINK "OpSystem"} to be able to
start up the system from that disk.

A floppy disk without a boot block cannot be used to boot the system.
However, it also needs a @{"Startup-Sequence" LINK "Booting-Startup"} file to properly get the system
up and running.

A boot block can be put on a disk with the AmigaDOS @{"command" LINK "Commands"} @{"INSTALL" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/17.Install/MAIN"}.

STARTUP-SEQUENCE@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
The presence of a @{"boot block" LINK "Booting-BootBlock"} (and nothing else) on a disk will do very
little except put a CLI window onto the screen.

To properly complete the booting process, the bootable disk needs to have
a file called "startup-sequence" in a directory called "s". This file
can be customised to make the system boot up in different ways for different
purposes.

The startup-sequence file contains a series of AmigaDOS commands. The
one on your boot disk can be read now by @{"clicking here" LINK "Sys:s/startup-sequence/MAIN"}

@NODE "Bytes" "AmigaDOS For Beginners - Glossary - Bytes"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - GLOSSARY

BYTES@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
A byte is the standard unit of computer memory. Larger units are in multiples
of bytes, e.g. Kilobytes, Megabytes, etc. (see table below) and smaller
units are Bits and Nybbles (see table below).

A byte can be a single unit of data. One character of the letter that
you write will be stored in one byte, or one machine language instruction
in a program is stored in one byte.

Other units of memory as related to a byte are:-

BIT                  = smallest memory unit
NYBBLE               = 4 bits  (2 nybbles = 1 byte)
BYTE                 = 8 bits or 2 nybbles
WORD                 = 2 bytes or 16 bits
LONGWORD             = 4 bytes or 32 bits
KILOBYTE (kb or k)   = 1024 bytes
MEGABYTE (mb or meg) = 1024 kilobytes = 1,048,576 bytes
GIGABYTE (gb or gig) = 1024 megabytes = 1,048,576 kilobytes

The multiplier "1024" is used rather the "1000" because computers think
in the @{"binary" LINK "Binary"} number system in which:-

     binary 100         = decimal 4    (2 power  2)
     binary 1000        = decimal 8    (2 power  3)
     binary 10000       = decimal 16   (2 power  4)
     etc.  etc.
     binary 10000000000 = decimal 1024 (2 power 10)

A "Keyword" is a special word used in conjunction with @{"commands" LINK "Commands"} to tell
the command to act in a certain way. For example:-

  COPY FROM name1 TO name2

The "FROM" and "TO" are "KEYWORDS" that tell AmigaDOS command COPY that
name1 is the file to copy FROM and name2 is the file to copy TO.

OPTIONS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
An "option" for a @{"command" LINK "Commands"} is a @{"keyword" LINK "Keywords"} which can be used or left out at
the discretion of the user and which can affect the way in which the command
works.

As an example, the DIR command used without options, as in:-

  > DIR DirectoryName

displays the names of the directories and files contained by the directory
but not the contents of the sub-directories.

It can have@{B} options@{UB} added as in:-

  > DIR DirectoryName OPTION

For example, the use of the ALL keyword option:-

  > DIR DirectoryName ALL

will display all the contents of the sub-directory. Other options do other
things.

Thus an @{B}option@{UB}, while being optional, can change the way the command
works.

tasks.

These chips have names such as:-

   Agnus  Alice  Amber  Buster  Denise  Gary  Lisa

There have been three main versions of the custom chip set:-

LOGICAL DEVICES AND MAKING ASSIGNMENTS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
A "logical device" (as opposed to a @{"Physical Device" LINK "PhysicalDevices"}) is one which does
not exists in reality but is really a "reference" to a directory on a
disk. The system sets up the logical devices either @{"automatically" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/19.Devices/Logical"37} or in
the @{"startup-sequence" LINK "Booting-Startup"} using the @{"ASSIGN" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/20.Assign/MAIN"} command. Users can also use ASSIGN
in a Shell/CLI window or a @{"script" LINK "Scripts"} file.

We talk about this process as "making an assignment" to a directory.

A typical logical devices is FONTS: which is a reference to the "Fonts"
directory on the disk from which the system was booted. Any program needing
fonts knows to look in the logical device "FONTS:". However, the assignment
can be changed to any other directory with, for example,:-

  > ASSIGN Fonts: df1:MyFonts

Programs still look for fonts in the logical device "FONTS:" but now the
system directs them to "df1:MyFonts".

It is much easier to use logical devices such as this as you can change
the reference point without having to tell the programs where to find
the new directory. They still just look for the assigned logical device.

DIRECTORY UTILITY@{UB}@{UU}

A @{B} Directory Utility@{UB} is a program that lets you examine the contents of
disks and directories by directory and file name rather than by workbench
icons. A good Directory Utility will have two windows side by side in
which are shown the contents of two different directories, either on the
same or different disks.

The program allows you to see files not normally visible by icons.

It allows you to do a lot of @{"AmigaDOS" LINK "AmigaDOS"13} functions such as copying, deleting,
renaming, viewing, etc. without having to learn all the CLI commands.
You can, for instance, click on a file name in one window and then click
on a button called COPY and the file will be copied from the directory
represented in that window to the one represented in the other
window.

Modern directory utilities such as "Directory Opus" © Jonathan Potter and
GPSoftWare and "DirWork" © Chris Hames (both available through retail
outlets) have an extremely large range of capabilities and can be
configured to suit you own purposes.

@{B}FLOPPY DISKS@{UB} for the Amiga are normally 3-1/2" Double Sided Double Density
(DSDD) floppy disks with a capacity of up to 880 @{"kilobytes" LINK  "Bytes" 21} of data. Double
sided means that both sides of the disk are used (as opposed to some of
the very early disks that only used on side). Double Density refers to
the density of the magnetic material on the surface of the disk. It is
unnecessary and @{B}inadvisable@{UB} to use 3-1/2" DSHD (Double Sided High Density)
disks in the standard Amiga floppy drives. To the best of my knowledge
3-1/2" disks were never made in a density less than "Double".

The Amiga uses the same type of floppy disks as any other computer. However,
if you buy pre-formatted disks you will no doubt find that they are in
IBM compatible format and you will have to re @{"format" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/16.Format/Why"} them unless you are
going to use them with an IBM emulator or with a program that reads &
writes IBM formatted disks such as "CrossDOS".

@{B}FLOPPY DRIVE@{UB} is one that, unlike a Hard Drive (see below) allows floppy
disks to be inserted and removed and interchanged at the user's will.
The standard Amiga Floppy Drives are 3-1/2" drives that take DSDD (Double
Sided Double Density) floppy disks (see above).

@{B}HARD DRIVE@{UB} is similar in many ways to a floppy drive (see above) but it
is able to store much larger quantities of data and to access the data
much faster than a floppy. The advantages are that most, if not all, of
your programs and data can be stored on the one disk (depending on the
size of the drive) and programs and data will load in a fraction of the
time compared to floppies.

Hard drives have capacities ranging from 20 @{"megabytes" LINK "Bytes" 21} (mb) upwards.
(The old Amiga A590 hard drive was 20mb.)

These days drives of 1 @{"gigabyte" LINK "Bytes" 21} and higher are quite common for the home
user.

Aminet's Australian mirror internet site has a 13 gigabyte drive!!

Most hard drives have the disadvantage that the disk in them is fixed into
the drive casing and can not be taken out and replaced as can be done with
floppies. However, there are also what is called "removable" hard disks with
capacities of, say, 40 mb or 80 mb. These allow one disk or cartridge to be
removed and another inserted.

DISK STRUCTURE & FILE SYSTEM@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
The "file system" is the system used by the Amiga's @{"operating system" LINK "OpSystem"} to
organise files on a disk. The original file system used by Workbench 1.3
and earlier is now called the "Old File System" (OFS). The "Fast File
System" (FFS) was introduced with some Hard Disk Drives used by wb1.3
to allow faster access to disk data. With workbench 2 onwards, FFS is
the default on Hard Drives and OFS the default on floppies. However, FFS
floppy disks can be formatted and read by Workbench 2+. Workbench 1.3
and earlier cannot read FFS floppies. FFS is not only faster but can store
more data than OFS (see below)

In order to store information on a disk, its magnetic surface is divided
into sectors or blocks, tracks and cylinders. These divisions are created
when the disk is formatted.

A @{B}"Sector" or "Block"@{UB} is the smallest unit that can be used for data storage.
Files are stored in one or more blocks and if the last block is not full
then the empty space cannot be used for anything else. A block has a data
storage capacity of 488 @{"bytes" LINK "Bytes"} in Old File System and 512 bytes in Fast
File System. A disk block is sometimes called a "sector".

(See also @{"Header Blocks" LINK "HeaderBlock"}).

A "Cylinder" consists of a number of blocks. On a standard 3-1/2 inch
disk this is 22 blocks, 11 on one side of the disk and 11 on the other
side. The 11 blocks on each side are contained in "Tracks"

"Track" is a term that originated from single sided disks. Each side of
the disk is divided into a number of concentric circles or tracks each
containing a number of blocks.

"Side" or "Head" are also used to describe the two parts of a cylinder,
one on each physical side of the disk.

The numbering of sectors, blocks, tracks, cylinders on a 3-1/2 inch disk
follows these guidelines:-

  Cylinders                - 0 to 79 (80 in total)
  Tracks or sides or heads - 0 and 1 in each cylinder (2 in total)
  Blocks                   - 0 to 1759 on a disk (1760 in total)
  Sectors                  - 0 to 10 on a track (11 in total)

Thus block number 1334 is on Sector 3 of Side (or track) 1 of Cylinder 60.

DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEMS@{UB}@{UU}

"Decimal" is one of at four @{"number systems" LINK "Number_Systems"} that are used in computing.

To say a number system has a base ten means that there are 10 digits (0-9)
that can be used before we start to use double digit numbers.

This system has developed because humans have 10 fingers and primitive
humans counted on their fingers. Maybe some of us still do! If the powers
that be had created us with 6 fingers on each hand we would have a number
system based on 12 digits which would have made arithmetic a lot easier!

BINARY NUMBER SYSTEMS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
"Binary" is one of at four @{"number systems" LINK "Number_Systems"} that are used in computing.

Computers, to create an analogy with humans, have only @{"one finger" LINK "Decimal"10} on each
hand, or a total of two digits. So computers use a @{B}Binary System@{UB} with only
the two digits of 0 and 1. This is really not a good analogy. A better one
is to consider that a computer can be compared to millions of little
switches which can only have two states - on and off:-

- When a switch is @{B}off@{UB} it holds a value of @{B}0@{UB}
- When a switch is @{B}on@{UB}  it holds a value of @{B}1@{UB}

The switches are the @{"bits" LINK "Bytes" 13} of the computer memory. Eight bits make up one
@{"byte." LINK "Bytes"}

Thus a byte can have each of its switches on or off, i.e. holding a value
of 0 or 1. The byte can therefore hold numbers of decimal value from 0
to 255. In the following example the bits are numbered from 0 (rightmost)
to 7 (leftmost) and the binary numbers are represented by the 0's and
1's below the bit numbers. For example, decimal 5 is binary 00000101.

        Bit number values   Decimal Number

        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0        0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1        1
        0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0        2
        0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1        3
        0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0        4
        0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1        5
        0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0        6
        0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1        7
        0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0        8
        ...............       ..
        0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1       15
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0       16
        ...............       ..
        ...............      ...
        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1      255

Thus the binary number, which is represented by the 0's and 1's in the
above table, is directly related to the on and off condition of each bit
of a byte. See @{"Comparative Table" LINK "Table"} for more examples.

Hexadecimal relates more closely to binary than does decimal but is easier

Hexadecimal uses 16 digits for the decimal numbers 0 to 15. It does not
start to get into double digit numbers until the decimal number 16. Because
we only have 10 digits at our disposal, the letter A - F are used for
the extra 6 digits and represent the decimal number 10 to 15 respectively.

@NODE "Opsystem" "AmigaDOS For Beginners - Glossary - Operating System"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}AMIGADOS FOR BEGINNERS - GLOSSARY

OPERATING SYSTEM
@{JLEFT}
WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM?@{UB}@{UU}

Every computer needs some sort of operating system. Without one, the computer
would not know how to make a program work. In fact, it would not even
know how to load a program from disk into memory. It would not know how
to put graphics onto the screen. It would not know how to interpret keyboard
presses or mouse movements. It would know NOTHING at all!

An operating system is really a whole set of instructions, or programs,
and other types of information, to tell the computer how to do all the
things that let you load programs and communicate with them via the keyboard
and mouse, and to let you see the output on the screen.

There are two parts of the operating systems - disk based and ROM based.

@{B}@{U}The ROM Based Part Of The Operating System@{UB}@{UU}

First of all, there is the @{"ROM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Rom"} based part of the Operating System. Let's
call this the ROM-OS for short.

The ROM-OS is "hard coded" into the computer's ROM chips. By "hard coded"
I mean that it is a set of instructions that are permanently written onto
the various ROM chips. Being in ROM it cannot be altered unless a new
ROM chip is installed. For example, if you want to update your Amiga from
Version 1.3 to the Version 2 then you will need to have a new ROM chip
put into your computer.

Because ROM cannot loose its memory when power is turned off, this part
of operating system is always there waiting for you to use it.

The ROM-OS allows the computer to get started. It can read information
from disk, load it into @{"RAM," LINK "RAM-ROM-Ram"} make a program operate properly, display
information on the screen, and lots more.

@{B}@{U}The Disk Based Part Of The Operating System@{UB}@{UU}

Secondly, there is the Disk Based part of the Operating System.

This is what used to be called DOS for "Disk (based) Operating System". (In
IBM compatible computers, it is called MS-DOS and in the Amiga it is called
AmigaDOS although @{"AmigaDOS" LINK "AmigaDOS"13} is a lot more than just the disk based
commands.)

Some people call it "Disk Operating System". This is sometimes taken to
mean a system for operating the disk drive and talking to the disk. While
this is almost true for some computers such as the Commodore 64, it is
far from being the whole truth for the Amiga. AmigaDOS includes more than
just systems for operating the disk drive.

Originally, AmigaDOS referred to a whole lot of programs and information
that is held on a disk. However, with Versions 2 and 3, a lot of things
that used to be on disk are now held in ROM. Thus some AmigaDOS @{"commands" LINK "Commands"}
can no longer be found on disk.

These days "Disk Based" is no longer accurate but DOS is still used to mean
the whole set of commands and files that the user can access to make the
system operate.

For those commands still on disk, individual items can be loaded from
disk into RAM as and when they are required. When they are finished with,
the system can take them out of memory thus freeing up RAM for other
activities.

As an example, when you copy a disk, a program called "DiskCopy" is loaded
into RAM from the Workbench disk, the disk copying is carried out by that
program, and then "DiskCopy" is removed from RAM. Next time you copy a
disk, the "DiskCopy" program must be reloaded from the workbench disk.

@{B}@{U}Why Two Parts Of The Operating Systems?@{UB}@{UU}

Although the distinction between ROM based and DISK based has become
somewhat blurred since Version 2, the following notes are still relevant.

The main difference between the two parts of the operating systems is that
one is ROM based and one is DISK based. ROM-OS is in ROM memory and DOS is
loaded into RAM memory. However, once it is loaded into memory, the Amiga
"sees" the DOS command in the same way as it "sees" ROM-OS, i.e. it is just
another set of instructions and/or information for the Amiga to use.

There are two main reasons for having two parts to the overall operating
system.

Firstly, operating systems have become so large that to have it all hard
coded into ROM would mean a lot of expensive memory tied up with
a lot items that, normally, are used only one at a time. (For those who had
or know the Commodore 64 computer, it @{B}DID@{UB} have the complete operating
system hard coded in ROM chips and discs were only used for programs and
user data.)

In some cases, parts of the DOS are rarely, if ever, used by many people.
It is much more effective to have a lot of the system on a disk ready to be
called up if and when required.

A disk is a much cheaper storage medium than RAM or ROM chips. A 3-1/2
inch disk that costs about $1 can hold 880 kilobytes of information. This
is more than the 512 kilobytes that comes with an unexpanded Amiga 500!
Extra ROM chips equivalent to the capacity of a single disk would certainly
cost far more than $1.00!

Secondly, computer programs, including operating systems, have a habit
of being continually upgraded. It is much easier and cheaper to upgrade
your computer to the latest operating system by buying it on disk rather
than having to have the ROM chips changed. (However, the upgrade to Version
2 involves both ROM-OS and DOS. Thus to get it you need a new ROM chip
as well as new disks.)

For both these reasons, computer manufacturers put a lot of the operating
system onto disk and call it the Disk BASED Operating System, i.e. DOS.

To put it VERY simply, DOS will hold those things not needed for basic
operations and that may only be infrequently used, whereas the ROM-OS
will contain those things needed to get the computer up and running, and
to handle a lot of the facilities that are used all the time. Keyboard
and mouse input and screen output would be two of the most common that
are in ROM-OS. These sorts of things will operate far more efficiently
from ROM-OS than from DOS.

is one case where I think MS-DOS terminology is better - "Protection Bit"
and @{"PROTECT" LINK "ADB:Parts_21-30/23.Protect/MAIN"} are a bit misleading as a lot of the bits have nothing to
do with protecting the file!

These bits can be turned "on" or "off" thus changing the attributes of
the file.

The protection bits that are available in all versions of AmigaDOS are:-

  r To indicate if the file is readable or not
  w To indicate if the file can be written to or not
  e To indicate if the file can be executed or not
  d To indicate if the file can be deleted or not

These extra protection bits became available from @{B}v1.3 onwards:-@{UB}

  h To indicate that the file should be hidden
  s To indicate if the file is a script or not
  p To indicate if file is pure or not (explained in article @{"RESIDENT" LINK "ADB:Parts_21-30/24.Resident/Only"})
  a To indicate if the file has been archived or not

By changing the protection bit you can change how the system treats the
file. For example, the "d" bit, if "turned off" changes the file from a
deletable one to a non deletable one.

Protection bits can be displayed by the @{"LIST" LINK "ADB:Parts_11-20/13.List/MAIN"} command.

Protection bits can be changed with the @{"PROTECT" LINK "ADB:Parts_21-30/23.Protect/MAIN"} command.

They can also be viewed and changed from Workbench by using the icon's
@{"Information Window" LINK "Info_Window"} or with a good @{"Directory Utility" LINK "DirUtility"} program.

MEMORY - ROM AND RAM@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}

Computer memory is the internal chips that are used to hold programming
code and data.

Computers have two main types of memory. These are:-

@{" ROM - READ ONLY MEMORY     " LINK "RAM-ROM-Rom"}
@{" RAM - RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY " LINK "RAM-ROM-Ram"}

In the Amiga, RAM is divided into "CHIP" and "FAST" memory.

@{" CHIP RAM (Graphics Memory) " LINK "RAM-ROM-Chip"}
@{" FAST RAM                   " LINK "RAM-ROM-Fast"}
@{" SLOW RAM or SLOW-FAST RAM  " LINK "RAM-ROM-Slow"}

ROM - READ ONLY MEMORY@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
"Read Only Memory" (ROM) is @{"memory" LINK "RAM-ROM"} that the computer can read information
from but, as the name implies, it cannot write information to it.

Its information is permanent, i.e. it is not lost when the power is turned
off. Compare this with @{"RAM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Ram"} which can be written to as well as read from,
but which loses its memory when the power is turned off. A lot of the
Amiga's @{"operating system" LINK "OpSystem"} is held in the ROM chips.

RAM - RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
"Random Access Memory" is @{"memory" LINK "RAM-ROM"} that the computer can both read from and
write to. (Compare this with @{"ROM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Rom"} which can be read from but not written to).

RAM loses its memory when the power is turned off.

In the Amiga, RAM can be one of:-

  @{" CHIP      " LINK "RAM-ROM-Chip"}
  @{" FAST      " LINK "RAM-ROM-Fast"}
  @{" SLOW-FAST " LINK "RAM-ROM-Slow"}

The term "Random Access" derives from the fact that the computer can gain
direct access to any part of the memory (start, middle or end) at will,
or randomly. Compare this to tape storage where the tape has to be
physically wound to the required spot before access can be gained.

The capacity of a computer is usually measured in the number of
@{"kilobytes or megabytes" LINK "Bytes"13} of RAM memory.

It is in RAM that all the programs that you load from disk are placed. All
your word processor documents and you paint program pictures, etc. are
temporarily stored in RAM while you are using them.

CHIP RAM or CHIP MEMORY - Also called "Graphics Memory"@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
This is called "CHIP RAM" because it is @{"memory" LINK "RAM-ROM"} accessible by the Amiga's
@{"Custom Chips" LINK "Custom"} (the chips specially designed for the Amiga) as well as
the @{"CPU" LINK "CPU"}.

These custom chips cannot access any other type of ram but chip ram.

Chip RAM is used to store data for graphics and sound and is sometimes
called @{B}Graphics Memory@{UB} but can also be used for normal program or data
storage if there is no @{"fast ram" LINK "RAM-ROM-Fast"} available, i.e. if fast ram is already full
or if the computer is not equipped with fast ram.

The original Amiga 1000 and 500 computers could only access 1/2 megabyte
(512 kilobytes) of chip ram. Later Amigas allowed access to 1 megabyte,
then 2 megabyte of chip ram thus allowing bigger and better graphics and
sound.

FAST RAM@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
Fast RAM is @{"memory" LINK "RAM-ROM"} that is only accessible by the @{"CPU" LINK "Cpu"} and not by the @{"custom" LINK "Custom"}
chips. It is called "FAST RAM" as programs stored in fast RAM run with
more speed than those in stored @{"CHIP RAM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Chip"}.

Many Amigas do not have fast ram in the standard model, but only chip ram.
Fast ram is an optional extra with such Amigas.

Memory added as expansion RAM is usually fast ram, not chip ram (but see
also @{"SLOW RAM" LINK "RAM-ROM-Slow"} which discusses "Slow-Fast RAM").

Slow RAM is the expansion @{"memory" LINK "RAM-ROM"} used by the Amiga 500 expansions that
fit into the trap door connector. It is recognised as @{"fast ram" LINK "RAM-ROM-Fast"} by the

but it does not operate as fast as true "fast ram". Hence the term
"slow-fast ram".

drawers and files. You can copy files to it. The @{"Startup-Sequence" LINK "Booting-Startup"} file
usually creates a "T" directory in the Ram Disk for programs to use as
temporary storage. All contents of a RAM Disk are lost on power loss or on
reset.

A "RAD DISK" is another type of Ram Disk. RAD is a "Recoverable RAM Disk".
It still looses its contents on loss of power but it retains them on reset.
It can also be set up as a bootable disk from which you can boot during a

STRINGS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
To put it rather simply, a "string" is a single unit of data that contains
one or more characters. Just as a whole lot of beads can be put into a
"string of beads" so can a whole lot of characters be put together into
a "string of characters". The thing about strings, as the computer sees
them, is that the computer considers the string of characters as a single
unit of data.

There are times when a string must be contained within "string delimiters"
which are simply characters that define the limits, i.e. the start and
finish, of the string. In AmigaDOS the string delimiter character is the
inverted comma (").

If there are no spaces in the string then you often do not need to use
quotation marks. For example:-

  TYPE MyFile

will consider "MyFile" as the string representing the file name to be
typed.

However,:-

  TYPE My File

will consider the "My" and "File" as two separate strings representing
two different file names. You would have to use:-

  TYPE "My File"

to make AmigaDOS look at "My File" as a single string representing one
file name only.

A string can contain any of the characters that can be entered via the
keyboard (as well as some that can't!!). For example, all these are
strings:-

  "A String is a lot of characters put together"
  "!@#$%^&*()"
  " A1 b2 C3 "
  " 12 + 3 is Fifteen"
  " : ; / ? . < "

@{B}Note@{UB} that strings can contain the space character so that a single string
can be made up of a number of words separated by spaces.

@{B}Note@{UB} that the string does @{B}not@{UB} include the string delimiter characters so
that, if the string is represented by:-

  "A String is a lot of characters put together"

The actual string is:-

   A String is a lot of characters put together

A @{B}wildcard@{UB} is a character that can be inserted into a file name to replace

The term @{B}wildcard@{UB} is taken from card games where the joker, or other cards,
can often be used in lieu of other cards.

In AmigaDOS files, the ? character can replace any other character and
the # character is used to say "any number of the characters that follow
me". Thus #? means any number of any characters.

The * character is used by some programs as a substitute for #?

characters that are generally produced when you press keys in conjunction
with the ALT and the SHIFT/ALT control keys.

These code numbers are described as Non-ASCII as they have not been
standardised. The characters (if any) that they represent may vary from
computer to computer (e.g. from Amiga to IBM) and even from font to font
for the same computer

The list shown below covers code numbers 160 to 255. My setup does not
give any characters for codes 128 to 159.

If you do not see any characters under the "Character" headings below,
or if some are missing, then the font you are using is different to mine
in this range of code numbers.

Do not take this list as definitive. I have included it here only to show
