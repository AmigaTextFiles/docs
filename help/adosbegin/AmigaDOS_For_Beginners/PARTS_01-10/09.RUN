@NODE "General" "Part 9 - The RUN Command - General Usage"

@{B}@{U}General Usage of RUN@{UB}@{UU}

The syntax for this command can be one of:-

  RUN filename

  RUN filename +

There are @{B}no@{UB} options.

I will explain the use of the + under the heading @{"Extra Facility" LINK "Extra"}. Forget
about it for the time being.

Although RUN will not give an error if no file name is supplied, it is
a bit pointless to do so!!

I said in @{"Part 4 Using Shell & CLI" LINK "ADB:Parts_01-10/04.Using_Shell-CLI/Starting"46} that you start off a program from
a Shell/CLI window by either of:-

  > ProgramName
  > RUN ProgramName

In explaining the difference we need to understand that an @{B}I/O @{UB}
(Input/Output) Window is one in which a program can display its output
for the user to see and in which the user can interact with the program by
entering data from the keyboard or using the mouse.

@{B}@{U}Launching a Program Without The RUN Command@{UB}@{UU}

When launching the program @{B}without@{UB} the RUN command, the program normally
takes over the CLI process from which it was launched. Thus there will
be no prompt displayed in the window, and the window cannot be used for
anything else until that program has been exited.

Some programs will use the Shell/CLI window from which they were launched
for their I/O operations. Others will open their own I/O window but still
leave the Shell/CLI from which they were launched useless for other
things.

However, some programs have been written in such a way that they @{B}detach@{UB}
themselves from the CLI process from which they were launched even if RUN
is @{B}not@{UB} used. They open their own I/O window and so the original Shell/CLI
window is left completely free for other things.

@{B}@{U}Launching a With The RUN Command@{UB}@{UU}

The use of the RUN command tells AmigaDOS to operate the program in the
@{B}background@{UB}. This means that it will be allocated its own CLI process and
therefore it will @{B}not@{UB} take over the process from which it was launched.
As it is run as a background process AmigaDOS does @{B}not@{UB} open an I/O window
for it even though it has a process number allocated to it.

This is very handy for programs that do not need to need to have any I/O.

If the program @{B}does@{UB} need to have I/O but does @{B}not@{UB} open its own window
then it uses the window of the process from which it was launched. In
theory, this window is free for others things but it makes it very difficult
if you are trying to do something in it and the other program is busy
outputting to the window!

In this sort of situation it is best to open a new Shell/CLI window, start
up the program in that, and go back to your other Shell/CLI window for
your other things.

@NODE "Extra" "Part 9 - The RUN Command - Extra Facility"

@{B}@{U}An Extra Facility With RUN@{UB}@{UU}

Skip this part of the article if you like. It is unimportant, rather obscure
and, to my mind, useless. I include it for those who may be interested.

If you add a plus sign (+) to the end of the RUN command line, as in:-

  > RUN programname +

then press return, the program will not be run immediately. AmigaDOS will
wait for you to add another command line. However, there will not be any
prompt showing. A number of command lines can be entered in this way and
they will be put into a queue until a command line is entered @{B}without@{UB}
the plus sign.

The extra commands added in this way need not have RUN in them. Only the
first one in the chain has to have RUN.

Once the return key has been pressed on a command line@{B} without@{UB} the plus
sign, the commands in the queue will start to be operated in the order
in which they were entered.

Even though programs queued in this way are launched with the RUN command,
the next command line in the queue will @{B}not@{UB} be operated until the previous
program has been exited or has finished its job @{B}unless@{UB} that previous program
detaches itself from the CLI process.
