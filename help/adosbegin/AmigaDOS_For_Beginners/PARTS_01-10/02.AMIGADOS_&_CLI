PART 2 - AMIGADOS, CLI AND SHELL@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
A lot of beginners are rather confused by the differences between the
terms "AmigaDOS", "Shell" and "CLI". Some think that they are all one
and the same thing. Others think that AmigaDOS can only be used in a Shell
or CLI window. Some think that the various AmigaDOS commands are really
CLI commands. Some say they use CLI or Shell when the really mean that
they are using AmigaDOS commands in a CLI window.

So I had better start of with an explanation of the terms.

@NODE "What" "Part 2 - AmigaDOS CLI and Shell - What is AmigaDOS?"

@{B}@{U}WHAT IS AMIGADOS@{UB}@{UU}

@{B}AmigaDOS@{UB} is the term applied to Amiga's equivalent of @{"MS-DOS" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/AmigaDOS" 21} that is used
on IBM compatible computers.

DOS was originally an acronym for "Disk Operating System". Some say it
should be "Disk Based Operating System" as it does a lot more than operate
a disk and that it was really an operating system based (stored) on a
disks. Some say it should be @{"Device" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Devices"} Operating System".

The total AmigaDOS system would include things such as:-

- A set of @{"commands" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/Commands"} that can be used in the @{"Shell/CLI" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/CLI_&_Shell"} window and elsewhere.
- A system for saving data to disk and retrieving it from disk.
- A system for filing data on disks.
- An interface for @{"peripherals" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/PhysicalDevices"} such as keyboards, monitors, printers, etc.
- A method of running programs
- A multitasking system for running more than one program at a time.
- etc. etc. etc.

Some of the AmigaDOS software is hard coded into the Amiga's @{"ROM" LINK "ADB:Misc/Glossary/RAM-ROM-Rom"} (Read
Only Memory) chips and some of it is stored on the Workbench disk.

In @{B}v1.3@{UB} and earlier, all the commands used in the CLI window are contained
on the Workbench disk. Thus the commands used to "operate" the system
are "disk based".

In @{B}v2.0 and higher@{UB} (which I will call @{B}v2+@{UB} ), a lot of the AmigaDOS commands
are hard coded into the ROM chips so they are no longer "disk based" (See
@{"Where are AmigaDOS Commands Located" LINK "ADB:Parts_01-10/05.Commands/Where"} in the article "Commands & Keywords").
However, the term AmigaDOS is still applied to the overall system which
includes the commands.

It is best to forget that DOS ever stood for anything and think of it as a
complete system for operating the computer and its peripherals as described
above.

@NODE "Cli" "Part 2 - AmigaDOS CLI and Shell - What is CLI?"}

@{B}@{U}WHAT IS THE CLI?@{UB}@{UU}

CLI stands for "Command Line Interface". Simply put, it means that you
use an "interface" (in this case a CLI window) to send lines of commands
to the computer.

When you double click on a CLI or Shell icon (or start up CLI in any other
way) you could say that you are "Opening a Window to AmigaDOS".

Thus CLI is only a very small part of AmigaDOS.

@NODE "Shell" " What is Shell?"

@{B}@{U}WHAT IS SHELL?@{UB}@{UU}

SHELL is an upgraded CLI available in AmigaDOS @{B}Version 1.3 onwards.@{UB} It
provides a lot of features, not available in v1.2 and earlier, that make
using CLI a lot easier.

@{B}In Version 1.3@{UB} both CLI and SHELL are available. Double clicking on the
CLI icon gives you a CLI window without the Shell enhancements whereas
double clicking on the Shell icon gives you a CLI window with all the
Shell enhancements.

@{B}For v1.3@{UB} everything you can do in CLI you can do in SHELL, but there are
features of SHELL that are not available in CLI.

However @{B}from Version 2.0 on,@{UB} the SHELL became the standard. In some versions
there are both CLI and Shell icons and in some only a Shell icon. In all
cases, the actual program (tool) is called "CLI" and the Shell icon is a
project icon which has a default tool:-

   Sys:System/CLI

In the articles on this disk I refer, at times, to:-

- @{B}All Versions of Shell & CLI@{UB} which means just what it says. Use it in any
  version of CLI or Shell

- @{B}Shell Only@{UB} which means that it @{B}does not@{UB} apply to the old CLI in @{B}wb1.x@{UB}
  but it @{B}does@{UB} apply to CLI in @{B}wb2+@{UB} as CLI and Shell are the same thing.
