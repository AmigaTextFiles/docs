6th June 1995   First Release


Introduction
------------

Welcome to the world of UN*X operating system. A powerfull OS that is
widely used around the world for network purposes. Linux is a very
space friendly UN*X OS that is available for a lot of different machine
platform such as Atari, IBM PC's and Macintosh.

The first releases of Linux was made for the IBM PC clones and as it
came available to other machines the documentation didn't follow up for
these as good as the PC documentation. This is the reason I decided to
make a complete (well as close as possible) documentation to describe
the basic setup and use of Linux for the Amiga.

I am by no means a UN*X expert but I wanted to make it easier for the
people new to Linux to install this system on their machines. Reading
on is at your own risk. Please refer to the chapter about The Author.

System Requirements
-------------------

For Linux to work you will need a harddrive with at least a 22 MB
partition. Note that you CANNOT use a AmigaDOS partition as UN*X uses
it's own HFS (hierarcic filesystem). It's recommended that you have one
partition for / (root) and another for /usr (additional files).

The root-partition must be approx 3 MB and is the boot-partition. However
I recommend that you leave some more space to edit and add files, and for
logfiles. The /usr partition should be at least 19 MB, but you will need
more if you want to install other programs such as X11 windows and editors.
This is not much compared to NetBSD 1.0 which will require around 200MB
for the complete installation, and around 80MB minimum.

SCSI and IDE controllers are supported.

My setup was on a separate 49MB SCSI drive partitioned into one 10 MB
partition for root (/) and one 39 MB partition for additional files (/usr).
This leaves room for installing additional software.

Linux should work on all processors from the 68000 to 68040. I haven't been
able to test this but will verify as I get to do so. My machine is an A3000
25MHz 68030 based Amiga. I would recommend you have at least an 68030 to
get usefull speed from the Linux OS.

You will need at least 4MB of FAST memory and 1MB of CHIP memory in your
Amiga. Again, it's strongly recommended that you have as much memory as
possible to run Linux.

Linux runs on default on a 640x400 interlaced screen, so a VGA or Multisync
monitor would be recommended. Use of other screenmodes is currently unknown
to me but I will do a own documentation on this when I've done research on
it. It should possible to recompile the kernel to use other screens and
add-on graphicboards.

You will also need some free space on an AmigaDOS harddrive partition for
the required Linux files to be unpacked onto. Temporary free space must be
at least 25 MB. When Linux has been installed you will need under 1MB
for the boot-files.


Getting the required Linux files
--------------------------------

You will need some files to install Linux from. Specific for Amiga:

        A bootstrap program             amiboot-1.9.gz
        A RAMdisk image                 filesys.gz
        A kernel                        vmlinux-0.9.3.gz        or newer
        GZip for Amiga to unpack files

GZip can be found on AmiNet. I've used version 1.23 (24.Jan 93).
To unpack the GZip'ed files (*.gz) use the syntax:

        gzip -d <filename>.gz

GZip will unpack to the same directory and delete the *.gz file when done
to save space.

The bootstrap program loads the kernel file, and you have to make sure you
get a Amigaspecific bootstrap program. Look under the "amiga-directory" of
Linux on Linuxsites. You should always get the latest bootstrap program
unless other is specified in the ANNOUNCE files. Version 1.9 works with
version 0.93 of the kernel.

The kernel should also be Amiga specific, and I'm using version 0.93. Newer
version has been released (0.96 and 0.97) but I've not been able to boot
with these yet.

The RAMdisk image is a 1MB (1024k) Linux bootable RAMdisk image you will
need to install Linux from. You will need to boot from this when installing
Linux. It can usually be found under the "filesys-directory" on Linuxsites.
This is not an Amiga specific file.

Additional files you will need are:

        A root-disk image               root.tar.gz     (~730 kB)
        A usr-disk image                usr.tar.gz      (~5.7 MB)

These are Linuxspecific binaries compressed with full paths and all
directories needed to make a root- and usr-partition on your harddrive.


Where to get the Linux files
----------------------------

Several Linuxsites on Internet offer these files. They are public domain,
and there are mirrors of the mainsite that distribute them for you.

The developersite for Linux is:

        tsx-11.mit.edu

And the directory where the 680x0 specific files can be found in is:

        /pub/linux/680x0

Here you will find several subdirectories with the required files.
Archivenames mentioned above might vary. Please notes the ANNOUCE
files found in this directory as they contain important new-release
information as Linux is under constant development.

A comprehensive list of sites and where to find these files will be made
available.


Testing Linux
-------------

If you just want to see how Linux performs from a mimimum RAMdisk boot you
will not require the root.tar.gz and usr.tar.gz files. You will only need
2 MB of free AmigaDOS space and NO harddrive partition.

        Unpack the GZip'ed files

                amiboot-1.9.gz          (or newer)
                filesys.gz              (1024k image file!)
                vmlinux-0.9.3.gz        (or newer)

        in a AmigaDOS directory.

        You should now have these files:

                bootstrap               (amiga executable)
                RAMdisk-image           (linux RAMdisk root)
                vmlinux-0.9.3           (or newer versionnumber)

        To test Linux by booting from the RAMdisk image:

                bootstrap -k vmlinux-0.9.3 -r RAMdisk-image

Linux will now take over the AmigaOS and a grey screen telling you that
Linux is starting up should appear. After a few seconds when Linux has
checked what hardware you are using and loaded the necessary files, a
prompt should appear. Something like:

        bash#

And a flashing cursor. You can now try various UN*X commands like "ls"
and "cd". You will not be able to perform any usefull UN*X activites
but it will let you know that Linux DOES work on your Amiga. If running
Linux from the RAMdisk works you can be sure it will work from a
harddrive too. This can be usefull before getting all the Linux files
needed for installation.

To shutdown Unix and reboot your Amiga enter:

        /sbin/shutdown -r now

After a few seconds when Linux has updated all files it will automatically
shutdown and reboot your Amiga. As UN*X uses it's own HFS it is VERY
important when running from a harddrive that you use the "shutdown" command
and preferably "sync" before too to make sure all data is saved. It is
very easy to wreck the whole Linux OS if you don't follow this procedure.
All data will then be lost (from the Linux partitions) and can NOT be
restored.


Preparing files for harddrive installation
------------------------------------------

Assuming you downloaded all the required files you are now ready to
start installing Linux on your machine.

Put all files into a directory and unzip the GZip'ed files:

        gzip -d <filename>.gz

You will need about 25MB of AmigaDOS space for the unziped archives.
These should be:

        filename                description                     approx size
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        bootstrap               amiga executable                ~12 kB
        RAMdisk-image           Linux filesys image             1 MB
        vmlinux-0.9.3           or newer version for amiga      ~650-700 kB
        root.tar                Linux / (root) image            ~2.7 MB
        usr.tar                 Linux /usr (additiona) image    ~18 MB


Preparing suitable harddrive partitions
---------------------------------------

You are now ready to make the required Linux harddrive partitions. Note that
these steps must be followed CAREFULLY as one mistake might RUIN all or
some of your AmigaDOS partitions. If you are not 100% sure how to do the
following steps please consult help from a more experienced Amiga user or
your Amiga reseller. Please read these steps carefully before you start.

I would recommend that you put Linux on a own harddrive, but there is
nothing wrong by having it on the same harddrive as your other AmigaDOS
partitions. It's merely for safety when doing this for the first time.

I also recommend that you use Commodores HDToolBox supplied with AmigaDOS
2.0 or newer. Note that functions might vary slightly from those specified
in this documentation. I am using HDToolBox v40.3, and steps will be
described according to that versions functions. HDToolBox can be found
in your "Tools" directory of your Workbench bootpartition or disk.

If you own a GVP, WarpEngine or other SCSI/IDE-controller you will need to
start HDToolBox from CLI with the commandline:

        HDToolBox <device>

Where device is:

        scsi.device             Commodore internal SCSI (A3000)
        gvpscsi.device          GVP internal/external SCSI/IDE controller

or other supplied device that came with your SCSI/IDE controller. Please
consult your SCSI/IDE controller manual for more information.

You can also edit the info for HDToolBox to use it from Workbench.
Click once on the HDToolBox icon and select Icon/Information (hotkey AMIGA-I)
from the Workbench menu. Enter NEW item with the following line:

        device=<device>

as specificed above. HDToolBox uses Commodores scsi.device as default.
The required device should be found in the DEVS: directory of your boot
partition or disk.

You should be able to use any supplied HD-partitioning software that came
with your controller. But as it might NOT tell you all the information you
need I recommend you use HDToolBox to be sure. Consult your manual.

After starting up HDToolBox it will read all your connected SCSI/IDE drives
and show a list of them in a window. Select the desired harddrive you want
to install Linux on. Make a note of which drive you selected. First drive
is listed first (DO NOT note down SCSI ID).

If HDToolBox finds newly added drives or unknown drive types it will
ask if you want to save the drive type to a lookup-table on your
Workbench disk. Refer to the AmigaDOS manuals on more information !


AmigaDOS partition
------------------

Later in the installation you will need to access the AmigaDOS volume
that contains the archived Linux files (root.tar and usr.tar). Therefor
you will need to find out what drive and partition these are located on.

In HDToolBox:

        - Select the harddrive that contains your AmigaDOS volumes

        - Click on PARTITION DRIVE

Find out which partition NUMBER (leftmost in graph = 1st partition, last
is shown as rightmost partition in graph) you have put the archived files
on and note down it's number and which drive number it is on. Drivenumber
is deteremined by counting from the top and down in HDToolBox's listing
of drives.

For example you put the files in DH3:Linux/Archive. DH3: is refered
to as the 2nd partition in the partitioning setup graph. Note that DH3
not necessary has to refer to the 3rd partition because of the number.
You have to check to find what drive has the name DH3 in HDToolBox's
partitioning setup.


Partitioning
------------

Before we can proceed we need to get some information about the desired
harddrive you want to use. Note what drivetype and manufactor the desired
drive has.

        - Click on CHANGE DRIVE TYPE

        - Select the correct drivetype from the list by clicking on it
          and choose EDIT OLD.

A list of the harddrive data will be shown. You will need tonote down how
many BLOCKS PER CYLINDER this drive has as you will need it later.

Perform this operation on all the drives you want to use for Linux. If
you want both partitions on the same drive it will only be necessary to
do it once. MAKE SURE YOU SELECTED THE CORRECT DRIVE. If no data is
available on your drive select NEW instead of EDIT OLD and then
READ DATA FROM DRIVE to obtain the correct values.

DO NOT TRUST LEAFLETS that came with your drive. USE HDTOOLBOX !

Exit by clicking CANCEL or OK. Refer to the AmigaDOS manuals.

        - Click on PARTITION DRIVE

Do NOT change ANY AMIGADOS partitions unless you are SURE you want to
change them. Chaning the AmigaDos partitions will ERASE ALL DATA that
was on that partition.

Please refer to your AmigaDOS manuals for more specific information on
how to use HDToolBox if in doubt!

        - Click on ADVANCED OPTIONS to turn them ON

Select the desired partition from the graphic view above the buttons.
If you want to make a new partition click on NEW PARTITION and select
a empty space to use.

Adjust the size of the partition to the required amount using the arrow
below the partition graph.

        - At least 3MB for the root partition
        - At least 19MB for the usr partition

        - Click on the DEVICE NAME BOX marked "CHANGE_ME" and alter the
          name of the partition. Avoid using existing names on other drives.
          It is not important what this name is set to.

        - Select BOOTABLE to NO (box not checked)

        - Click on CHANGE FILE SYSTEM and select CUSTOM FILE SYSTEM

        - Select AUTOMOUNT to NO (box not checked)

        - Set FILE SYSTEM BLOCK SIZE to 512

        - Enter new IDENTIFIER :

                root:   0x42534452
                usr:    0x42534453

These are not important when using version 0.93 of the kernel.

        - Select RESERVED BLOCK AT BEGINNING and END to 0

        - Select USE CUSTOM BOOT CODE to NO (not checked box)

NUMBER OF CUSTOM BOOT BLOCKS should be 0 too.

Exit by clicking on OK to return to the partitioning setup.

Make a note of TOTAL CYLINDERS for each partition. Also note WHICH
partition on the drive it is. First partition is shown as the leftmost
partition in the graph, and the last one is the most rightmost.

For example if you made a new partition that is shown as the 4th
partition from left in the graph and it contains 419 total cylinders
note down:

        root:   Drive 1, partition 4, 420 cylinders, 60 blocks per cyl.

or

        usr:    Drive 3, partition 1, 1600 cylinders, 49 blocks per cyl.

You will need these figures later!

Make another partition following the steps above until you have two
partitions. One at least 3MB and the other at least 19 MB. Now exit the
partitioning setup after making notes on which drive, what partition and
how many cylinders each partition uses as described above.

        - Click on OK

        - Click SAVE CHANGES TO DRIVE

        - Select CONTINUE if you are 100% SURE you want to save changes.

        - Click on EXIT


Preparing fstab
---------------

You are now ready to install Linux on your partitions. But first you need
to extract one file from the "root.tar" archive and edit it's contents to
suit your drive setup.

        tar xf root.tar etc/fstab       (amigados)

fstab (filesystem table) contains information on your connected harddrives
by using the following syntax:

        /dev/sdXY       /partition      filesystem      options

where:

        "X" is a letter for which drive ID
                (a being first drive on controller,
                b the second drive etc.)

        "Y" is the number of the partition on that drive
                (1 being first partition, 4 the 4th partition etc)

        "partition" is the name of the partition in Linux
                (for example / or /usr)

        "filesystem" is what type of filesystem this partition has
                (for example minix, ext2, proc, affs etc).

        "options" can be bits to show if partition is read/writable etc.

Each entry must be separated with at least one space and be on the same line.
A # in from of a line means the line is commented out.

Now you will need to use an editor to edit this file to fit your setup. This
is where the information obtained during partitioning the drive is needed.

If your root-partition was created on drive 1, as partition 4 this would be
entered as:

        /dev/sda4       /               minix   default

And if your usr-partition was created on drive 3, as partition 1 it would be
entered as:

        /dev/sdc1       /usr            minux   default

In other words the first partition on the lowest numbered drive on your
controller is /dev/sda1.

Edit the "fstab" file to your setup and comment out previous setups. Save it
when you are done.


Booting Linux for installating
------------------------------

Now you can start Linux using the RAMdisk-image to prepare your harddrive
partitions and install the necessary files on them.

        bootstrap -k vmlinux-0.9.3 -r RAMdisk-image

                  ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     name of          name of ramdisk
                     kernel to use    image file

        -k option specifies kernel filename, default "vmlinux".
        -r option specifies to use ramdisk-image as specified.

When Linux has booted and the prompt has appeared on your screen you are
ready to install the minix filesystem on your harddrive partitions.
Before you commence you will need to calculate the size of each partition
in 1kB blocks. AmigaDOS specifies them as 512 bytes.

        size = blocks per cylinder * number of cylinders / 2

Calculate using the above formula for both the root and usr partitions.
Note down these figures and keep them with the rest in case you will
need to change anything later or reformat any partition.

Create a minix filesystem on both partitions using the following syntax:

        /sbin/mkfs /dev/sdXY <size>

X is the drive number and Y is the partition number on that drive. size is
the calculated size above. For example to prepare root as in example above
where root is on drive 1, partition 4 and has 420 cylinders with 60 blocks
per cylinder:

        size = 60 * 420 / 2 = 12600

        /sbin/mkfs /dev/sda4 12600      (linux commandline)

You have to be 100% sure before you perform this operation. Formatting the
wrong drive and partition could destroy an AmigaDOS partition !

For the usr partition in the example:

        size = 49 * 1600 / 2 = 39200

        /sbin/mkfs /dev/sdc1 39200      (linux commandline)

You have now formatted the two partitions you need for installing Linux onto.
Because of Linux's HFS filesystem you have to mount drives as directories
under the root-directory. This is because the usr-partition is refered
to as /usr. The fstab file tells Linux how to and where mount additional
drives to your Linux system. This design makes it possible to mount AmigaDOS
partitions as own directories in Linux. We will need to do so now to access
the archives containing the required Linux root files.

First we need to create a temporary directory where we will mount the correct
AmigaDOS volume that contains the archived files.

        mkdir /mnt2                             (linux commandline)
        mount -t affs /dev/sdXY /mnt2           (linux commandline)

where X is the drive number containing the AmigaDOS volume and Y is the
number of the desired partition where the archived files reside.

Now we need to mount the root partition. We will put it in the /mnt directory:

        mount /dev/sdXY /mnt                    (linux commandline)

where X is the drive number where your Linux root harddrive partition is, and
Y is the number of that drives partition you created root on. This is the same
as above where you formatted the Linux drives.

Go to the Linux root directory and unpack the root-archive from your AmigaDOS
partition:

        cd /mnt                                 (linux commandline)
        tar xvf /mnt2/path-to/root.tar          (linux commandline)

For example if you put the "root.tar" archive in /Linux/Archive enter:

        tar xvf /mnt2/Linux/Archive/root.tar    (linux commandline)

Note that Linux is CASE SENSITIVE !

To make sure everything is saved onto the disk:

        sync                                    (linux commandline)

Now we need to mount the usr-partition and unpack the usr.tar to it:

        mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/usr                (linux commandline)

where X is the drive number where your Linux usr harddrive partition is, and
Y is the number of that drives partition you created usr on. This is the same
as above where you formatted the Linux drives.

        cd /mnt/usr                             (linux commandline)
        tar xvf /mnt2/path-to/usr.tar           (linux commandline)
        sync                                    (linux commandline)

Now we need to put the new "fstab" in the correct directory:

        cd /mnt/etc                             (linux commandline)
        cp /mnt2/path-to/fstab .                (linux commandline)
        sync                                    (linux commandline)

We are now ready to reboot and use the harddrive partition, but first we need
to unmount the mounted drives:

        umount -a                               (linux commandline)
        umount /mnt                             (linux commandline)
        /sbin/shutdown -r now                   (linux commandline)

Now you're Amiga will reboot AmigaDOS again. You might have to press
CTRL-AMIGA-AMIGA manually if "shutdown" doesn't reboot after a few
seconds.


Booting from installed harddrive
--------------------------------

Assuming your Amiga reboots and you managed to install Linux correctly you
can now try and boot Linux from the harddrive partition:

        bootstrap -k vmlinux-0.9.3 root=/dev/sdXY

where X is the drive number where your Linux root harddrive partition is, and
Y is the number of that drives partition you created root on. This is the same
as above where you formatted the Linux drives.

If everything goes well you should be prompted with a login-prompt if
Linux managed to boot in multi-user mode. Don't be alarmed if you do not
get this prompt and instead a bash-prompt as when you booted with the
ramdisk-image earlier. This only means that something in the configuration
isn't correct.

At the login-prompt you should be able to login as root without any password.
If this is successfull accomplished you may skip the next chapter.


Failed to boot in Multi-User mode
---------------------------------

If the login prompt doesn't show it means something in your current
configuration is wrong. Most likely it is your "fstab" file. If you
get the error "fchk.mkfs /dev/sdXY failed, wrong filesystem" or
similar during Linux boot you need to edit the fstab file, or copy
the new you made earlier from AmigaDOS. To copy the new file in:

        mount -t affs /dev/sdXY /mnt2
        cd /mnt2/path-to-fstab
        cp fstab /etc

Remember to use the correct drivenumber (X) and partition number (Y)
for the correct AmigaDOS volume.

If you wish to edit the "fstab" file you can do this in several ways.
Currently the editor "ed" is only available after you booted. The
documentation for "ed" is found on Internet by ftp to:

        tsx-11.mit.edu   /pub/linux/packages/utils/util-linux.1.1.src.tar.gz

To use "ed":

        cd /etc
        ed fstab

If you don't feel confident to use "ed" you can use "cat". It can be usefull
to first view the fstab file before editing it, to have a reference to
the syntax of it:

        cd /etc
        more fstab
        cat > fstab

"cat" copies from the console to the file fstab. You will probably not be
able to correct any typing errors if you make any. End with CTRL-D. Refer
to earlier information on editing fstab to find out what to write in this
file.


Cleaning up the usr-partition
-----------------------------

The usr.tar archive supplied with Linux requires that you will have to
move some files to their correct paths. In general this is done by moving
an entire directory-tree one step up towards the root-directory. After
your installation the contents of / would be:

        /usr/usr
        /usr/usr/bin
        /usr/usr/lib
        ...

This is wrong, as the directory-tree should be:

        /usr/bin
        /usr/lib
        ...

To correct this you will have to move all the directories one directory up,
EXCEPT for usr. Delete usr and mv the other files one directory up.
MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOCATED in /usr/usr by using the "pwd" command. It prompts
what directory you are in.

        cd /usr/usr
        command rm -rf usr
        mv * ..

Now "mv" won't move complete directories so these have to be moved one by
one. There aren't that many. Use "ls -la" to list all files in current
directory (works similiar to dir):

        ls -la
        mv bin ..
        mv lib ..

Continue to move files using "mv" until all the listed directories have
been moved. Check by using "ls -la":

        ls -la                  (should not list any dir's except . and ..)
        cd /usr
        command rm -rf usr      (delete the empty /usr/usr directory)

Now Linux should be correctly installed and ready to be configured to
suit your network setup. Check out all the files in /etc and edit them
to suit your network. The editor "vi" should now be available, if not
try and logout and relogin:

        exit

Now relogin using the login root and no password.


System overview
---------------

Overview of directories:

        /                       root directory
        /bin                    binaries
        /dev                    devices such as console, harddrives etc.
        /etc                    setup files
        /home                   directory for login users or link to it
        /lib                    libraries for compiling and more
        /mnt                    empty directory. can be deleted
        /mnt2                   empty directory. can be deleted
        /root                   login directory for root user
        /sbin                   system binaries (only for root)
        /usr                    harddrive partition 2 (userfiles)
        /usr/bin                additional binaries
        /usr/etc                additional setup (users/applications etc)
        /usr/lib                additional libraries
        /var                    various files (logs etc)

Example of Bourne Again Shell (bash) configuration files
--------------------------------------------------------

Each user has it's own "home" directory. These are usually located in
/home/loginname/. There are no rule for where you want the users home-
directories but it's wise to collect them in one common place. I made
a symbolic link called /home which points to /users. Here I make
directories for each user of my system and edit the /etc/passwd file
to suit this setup.

By default Linux comes with bash. However you can compile csh, tcsh or
any other shell as you like. I will here just describe some VERY basic
functions of the bash configuration files.

Files in users home-dir and /root:

        .profile                executed first at login
        .bashrc                 user-configurable bash sourcefile
        .bash_history           log of last actions in bash
        .bash_profile           executed first when bash is started

Example .bashrc file:

        #
        # Userdefined aliases
        #
        # Run after .profile
        #

        alias dir='ls -la'
        alias ren='mv'
        alias rd='rm -rf'
        alias del='rm'
        alias ll='ls -l'
        alias move='mv'
        alias copy='cp'
        alias md='mkdir'

Bash commands:

        EDITOR=editor           Set default editor (ie. vi)
        TERM=termtype           Set default terminaltype (ie. vt100)
        PATH=paths              Set default searchpath (ie. /bin:/sbin)
        export VARIABLE         Let system know of change (ie. export TERM)
        alias this='do that'    Make alias for "do that" (ie. dir='ls -la')

It's recommended that you do further research on how to use the different
shells that are available.


The editor "vi"
---------------

vi is widely used in the UN*X communitity as it's available to most
systems there is. Here is a quick breif userguide to vi. To find out
more use "man vi".

        Syntax:         vi filename

        Commands:       :d      delete line

                        :x      save and exit

                        :quit!  abort edit and exit

                        a       append mode, starting after current charcter

                        i       enter insert mode, starting before current
                                character on line.

                        esc     enter command mode (to use :d etc)


The password file
-----------------

Users passwords and an overview of the login accounts on the system are
found in /etc/passwd. This file has the following syntax:

        loginname:password:groupid:userid:Users Name:homedir:startup-shell

Example:

        root::0:0:System Maintainer:/root:/bin/bash

When no password is specified there is no need to enter a password at login.
You can use the command "passwd" in UN*X to change your current password.
This password will of course be encrypted so no other users can view
/etc/passwd and find out your login password.

To add new users simply edit /etc/passwd and add a new line with the
user information. DON'T FORGET to make a home-directory for this user !


Other files in /etc
-------------------

This directory contains all the system configurations and all files should
be made only writable by the root-user. Here's a quick overview of the
