+   Due to some complaints from persons about "RECOMENDING" patches,   +
+   I'll stop recomending patches on this list. This is because it's   +
+  very different from each setup if the patch will work successfully. +
+                                                                      +

+   on a URL, It will be announced in this list and the OS 3.5 list    +
