@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}HOW TO WRITE AMIGAGUIDE DOCUMENTS

INTRODUCTION@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
@{"I" LINK "Author"} originally started to write this project some time ago in an endeavour
to teach myself how to write documents in the Amigaguide format.

I had to do this as I could find very little which explained how to do it
properly. 

Although it is not quite complete, I have had a number of requests for it to
be made available so I am now placing it on Aminet as @{"copyrighted" LINK "Copyright"} freeware
or, more accurately, @{"Postcard/E-Mail Ware" LINK "Copyright"11} so that others may benefit from
what has already been completed.

I said above that it is "not quite complete". There are still @{"some points" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/ToDo"}
on which I am unclear. However, having had requests for its release, I did
not want to hold up distribution of it while I searched them out. If anyone
would like to enlighten @{"me" LINK "Author"} then I will update this project and give them
full credit.

I have already had quite a bit of response to and suggestions for this
project and I would like to express my thanks to @{"all those" LINK "Credits"} who have
assisted me in producing "How To Write Amigaguide" versions 1.02 onwards.
As I had hoped, it is becoming an Amiga community project!

@TOC "AGHTW_Index/Main"

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}HOW TO WRITE AMIGAGUIDE DOCUMENTS

USING THIS PROJECT@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have included an icon with this archive which operates a @{"script" LINK "How_To_Write_Amigaguide/Main"} that
detects if you are using Amigaguide or Multiview. It has its default tool
set to "IconX". By this means I can overcome the problem of not knowing
which program (Amigaguide or Multiview) your Amiga has.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have set up the @{"CONTENTS button" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Toc"} at the top of the display window to take
you to:-

- The @{"MAIN menu" LINK "AGHTW_Index/Main"} from nodes accessible from that menu,

- The @{"CONTENTS menu" LINK "AGHTW_Index/Contents"} from nodes accessible from that menu.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While writing this project, I have used a viewing window that displays 42
lines of text. I mention this as there is a @{"problem" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Problems"52} with Amigaguide and
Multiview when links jump to lines in a node other than the first line.

If you find that jumps to such links do not seem to get you where you
thought that they should, then check the size of your window. It would be
best to use one that has at least 75 characters of text across and not more
than 42 lines downwards. The more lines visible the more likely you are to
end up at a wrong line! Less lines than 42 should NOT cause a problem.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As not all people use the same versions of Amigaguide or Multiview, I
cannot rely on the Amigaguide command @{"WORDWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/WordWrap"} or @{"SMARTWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"} to properly
word wrap paragraphs. (These commands only work with amigaguide.library &
amigaguide.datatype version 39 and version 40 respectively.)

I have therefore formatted the articles so that each line that appears
in the window has a maximum of 76 characters with a @{"line feed" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/LineFeed"} at the end
of each line rather than only at the end of each paragraph. This should
allow each line to be displayed in a window that has the same width as your
screen provided that you are not using a font size bigger than 8.

But if lines are extending beyond the right edge of the window when reading
this article you may have to do one or more of:-

- widen the window to the full width of the screen

- reset your screen preferences to a width of 255 pixels at least

- reset the "Fonts" preferences to set the "System Default Text" font
  to a size of 8 or less.

If you are using the standard preferences that came with your Amiga then
you should not have any problems.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The text in this project has been formatted with some text:-

@{B}In bold text@{UB}

@{U}With underlined text@{UU}

@{JCENTER}Centred text
@{JLEFT}
If the above three lines are @{B}NOT@{UB}, respectively, in bold underlined
and centred, then you have an early version of the Amigaguide/Multiview.

Bold and underlining is available from version 39 onwards (AmigaDOS v3.0).

Centring is available from version 40 onwards (AmigaDOS v3.1).

If you have an Amigaguide/Multiview version earlier than 40 then the
formatting will not be as good as it could be. However, I trust that this
will not prevent you from getting the full benefit of the project.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you notice that, in some articles, there is a gap between the line
"=== End of Text ===" and the end of the window then @{B}DO NOT@{UB} go into the
file and delete these blank lines!! They are there because some instances of
cross referencing can be to some of the last lines of a node. If the blank
lines were not there then the cross reference link would go to a line before
the intended line.

@{B}This is a@{UB} @{"fault with Multiview/Amigaguide" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Problems"52}@{B} not with my editing!@{UB}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are using version 39 then you may find that clicking on a link
button then clicking on the "Retrace" button does NOT take you back to your
previous place in the project. This happens if the link button references a
place in the @{B}SAME NODE@{UB} as the one being viewed.

For example, @{"this button" LINK "Using"20} should take you to a spot further up in this node
to a line starting with:-

  While writing this project ......   - version 34
  The line with ~~~~~~ above it       - version 39/40

If, after clicking the button, you then click on the "Retrace" button:-

  With Version 39      - you will be taken back to the point you were at
                         before before reaching this node.
  With Version 34 & 40 - you will be returned here.

I am afraid that I cannot think of any way to overcome this problem. It
seems to be a fault with the version 39 that was not in v34 and that has
been corrected in version 40.

This problem is @{"one reason" LINK "History"24} why I split a lot of the project into smaller
nodes.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}HOW TO WRITE AMIGAGUIDE DOCUMENTS

How I Wrote "How To Write Amigaguide Documents"@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
@{B}"How To Write Amigaguide Documents"@{UB}@{UB} was written on a WB3.1 Amiga 1200
68030/68882 2mb/8mb

It was written with the @{B}EXCELLENT@{UB} shareware program @{B}AMIS@{UB} which, to quote
from the @{B}AMIS@{UB} manual, "is a programme capable of editing multiple file
formats with the power of an unique, easy to use graphical user interface
using normal intuition functions."

I found @{B}AMIS@{UB} on Aminet in the directory "text/edit" and have been using it
to edit my Amigaguide documents ever since.

It is @{B}well worth@{UB} the registration fee.

(Unfortunately I did not find @{B}AMIS@{UB} until I had virtually completed my
@{"other productions" LINK "OtherDocs"}).

@{B}AMIS@{UB} was written by:-

  Willem Mestrom E-mail: wmestrom@cs.ruu.nl or wmestrom@freemail.nl

A visit to the official AMIS home page is worthwhile. It is at:-

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}HOW TO WRITE AMIGAGUIDE DOCUMENTS

HISTORY@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
@{B}Version 1.06 12-Feb-98@{UB}

* Added a section on @{"Alternate Way To Reach A Node" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Alternate"} by double clicking with
  the left mouse button on a word (that is @{B}NOT@{UB} in a link) that is the name
  of the node to be reached.

@{B}Version 1.05 01-Jan-98@{UB}

* Added @{"a section" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/ARexx"} on the use of an ARexx script to open an Amigaguide
  document at a node other than the MAIN node by using the "SHOWNODE"
  function in "amigaguide.library".

@{B}Version 1.04 05-Dec-97@{UB}

* Oh dear oh dear!!!! - found out that Amigaguide/Multiview in Version 39
  will @{"NOT show" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"31} lines which have this sequence of characters:-

     a backslash
     the \@ symbol
     any character immediately after the \@ other than space or {

  so users of version 39 had a lot of blank lines while reading this
  project!!! (@{B}VERY @{UB}strange as versions 34 and 40 @{B}DO @{UB}show such lines!!!).

  Completely rewrote the whole think to fix this.

* As I have now been able to access a version 39 setup I have revised all
  sections where there was doubt expressed as to how version 39 reacted. 

* My thanks to @{"Chris Freestone" LINK "Credits"20} for all his help in the above two matters.

* I found out that there is a @{"problem with `Retrace'" LINK "Using"86} with links to lines in
  the same node when using version 39. I have therefore created a lot more
  nodes rather than having links to lines other than the first in the node.

* Added the section on the @{"BEEP" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/Beep"} section. (Thanks to @{"Oleg Sergeev" LINK "Credits"27}.)

* Added a bit to the @{"Unrecognised Commands" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Unrecognised"} to explain what happens when the
  unrecognised command is @{"set up similarly to link commands" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Unrecognised"37}.

* Added section on @{"Current Directory" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/CD"} recognised by Amigaguide/Multiview.

* Transferred section on @{"Links to Non Amigaguide Documents" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/NonGuideDocs"} from the node
  @{"Links To Document Nodes" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/LinkCommand"} to its own node.

* Added section on the @{"debugging feature" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Debugging"} (thanks to @{"Richard Burke" LINK "AGHTW_Boring_Stuff/Credits"40} for the
  information) which resulted in a slight change to the @{"DATABASE" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Database"18} section.

* Rewrote @{"Problem 7" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Problems"147} when I found that versions 34 and 39 did @{B}not@{UB} react in
  the same way as I had previously thought they did.

* A @{B}LOT@{UB} of other minor cosmetic changes that have made no real change to the
  context. These are too numerous to mention.

@{B}Version 1.03 26-Sep-97@{UB}

* Whoops - Forggot to speell chek!!!! - Sory about that fokes!!
  No other changes.

@{B}Version 1.02 21-Sep-97@{UB}

* Project became far too large for a single document so I split it into 7
  different disk files. (This, in itself, did not cause any changes in
  context.)

* Rewrote @{"NEXT & PREV" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/NextPrev"} section to explain how I included these commands
  in the first and last nodes of each section to link them all together
  after splitting the project into 7 disk files.

* Included @{"Links To Other File Types in Early Amigaguide Versions" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/OtherLinksEarly"}.
  (Thanks to @{"Christopher Jeffery" LINK "Credits"5})

* Following on the above additions, the @{"SYSTEM" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/System"} command section has been
  completely rewritten in order to:-
    - emphasise that @{"any program" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/System"15}, not just AmigaDOS commands, can be used
      in the SYSTEM argument, and
    - include section on advantages of @{"using RUN" LINK "AGHTW_Part2/SystemRun"} in the SYSTEM argument,
    - and generally tidy it up.

* Included note on @{"problem with macros" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Macros"133} that include long strings.
  (Thanks to  @{"Michael Schulz" LINK "Credits"13})

* Rewrote @{"TOC" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Toc"} section without making any changes to context.

* Included a section on the @{"MAIN Node" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/MainNode"}.

* Added a @{"section" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/WinSize"28} to the "Window Size" node to discuss a method of
  obtaining a display window size and position other than the default or
  that saved to the Envarc:Amigaguide/ or Envarc:Multiview/ directories by
  use of the menu item "Setting/Save As Defaults".
