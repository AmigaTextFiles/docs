TEXT ATTRIBUTE COMMANDS

Versions 39 and 40@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
This group of commands, which are really a sub section of @{"local commands" LINK, "AGHTW_Part3/Local"}
can be used to change the appearance of the text.

They are characterised by the use of the {} brackets.

Attribute commands can be used @{B}anywhere@{UB} within the text. They @{B}do not@{UB} have to
be on a line of their own nor at the start of a line.

There are other commands which affect the appearance of the text such as
@{"FONT" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Fonts"17} @{"WORDWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/WordWrap"} and @{"SMARTWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"} but as they do not use the {} and can be
used as both @{"global and local commands" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/GlobalLocal"} they are included elsewhere.

The commands available are discussed under these headings:-

@{" Style (Bold, Italic, Underlining) " LINK "Style"} - Versions 39 and 40

  \@{B}  - to turn on  Bold Text
  \@{UB} - to turn off Bold Text

  \@{I}  - to turn on  Italic Text
  \@{UI} - to turn off Italic Text

  \@{U}  - to turn on  Underlined Text
  \@{UU} - to turn off Underlined Text

  \@{PLAIN} - revert to plain text

@{" Colouring Text & Background        " LINK "Colouring"} - Version 40

  \@{APEN} @{" - " LINK "APen"} to change foreground pen number
  \@{FG}   @{" - " LINK "FG"} to change foreground colour

  \@{BPEN} @{" - " LINK "BPen"} to change background pen number
  \@{BG}   @{" - " LINK "Bg"} to change background colour

  \@{PARD} @{" - " LINK "Pard"} reset all colours to defaults

@{" Justification Of Text              " LINK "Justification"} - Version 40

  \@{JCENTER} - to centre justify text
  \@{JLEFT}   - to left justify text
  \@{JRIGHT}  - to right justify text

@{" Line & Paragraph Indicators        " LINK "LinePara"} - Version 40

  \@{LINE} - to insert line indicator
  \@{PAR}  - to insert paragraph indicator

@{" Indent Commands                    " LINK "Indents"} - Version 40

  \@{LINDENT <n>} @{" - " LINK "Lindent"} to indent by <n> spaces
  \@{PARI <n>}    @{" - " LINK "Pari"} to indent first line of paragraph by <n> spaces
  \@{PARD}        @{" - " LINK "Pard"} to cancel indents

@{" Word Wrapping                     " LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Wrapping"}

  \@{CODE} @{" - " LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Code"} to turn off word wrapping

  Note - The Word wrapping section also includes the commands WORDWRAP
         and SMARTWRAP which do not use the {} and are really global or
         local commands.

@{" TAB Commands                       " LINK "TabCommands"}

  TAB <n>    **       @{" - " LINK "Tabn"} to set tabs to a regular number of spaces

  \@{CLEARTABS}        @{" - " LINK "ClearTabs"} to clear tabs set by \@{SETTABS <n> ...}

  \@{SETTABS <n> ... } @{" - " LINK "SetTabs"} to set tabs to irregular settings

  \@{TAB}              @{" - " LINK "Tab"} to output an actual tab code

  ** Note - The "TAB <n>" command is also included in this section even
            though it is not an attribute command as it does not use the {}
            and is really a global or local command.

@{" Miscellaneous Attribute Commands   " LINK "MiscAtt"} - Version 40

  \@{AMIGAGUIDE} - to insert the word AMIGAGUIDE®

  \@{BODY}       - uncertain purpose

STYLE OF TEXT

BOLD ITALIC AND UNDERLINING

Versions 39 and 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Commands@{UB}@{UU} 
@{JLEFT}
This is done by including these commands:-

   \@{B}  turn on bold
   \@{I}  turn on italics
   \@{U}  turn on underlining

They are turned off again with:-

   \@{UB}  turn off bold
   \@{UI}  turn off italics
   \@{UU}  turn off underlining

For example:-

  \@{B}bold text \@{I}italic text and \@{U}underlined text\@{UB}\@{UI}\@{UU}

The above has been used in the following line which will be in styles if you
have @{"Amigaguide version" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Versions"} 39 or 40 but in plain if you have version 34:-

  @{B}bold text @{I}italic text and @{U}underlined text@{UB}@{UI}@{UU}

The commands can be placed ANYWHERE in the text. Please read @{"Problem 8" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Problems"182}.

If you are using version 40, then all of these attributes can be turned off
with the single command @{"PLAIN" LINK "Plain"}.

{PLAIN} Command

Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
With @{B}version 40@{UB}, if you want to turn off all three @{"styles" LINK "Style"} of text at once
(i.e. bold, italic and underlining) and revert to plain text you can use the
{PLAIN} command.

It could be used as follows:-

  \@{B}bold text \@{I}italic text and \@{U}underlined text\@{PLAIN}
  and now some plain text.
  
  which would appear like this:-
  
  @{B}bold text @{I}italic text and @{U}underlined text@{PLAIN}
  and now some plain text.

The danger with this is that, at time of writing (December 1997), the
majority of Amiga users are using Workbench 3.0 or earlier and so using 
{PLAIN} will result in users of version 39 continuing to see the bold,
italic and/or underlining. So if this paragraph is all bold, italic and
underlined then you are using version 39!

Users of version 34 will not get the bold, italics and/or underlining so
these last two paragraphs will be in plain as well as the demonstration
line above!

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}HOW TO WRITE AMIGAGUIDE DOCUMENTS

COLOURING THE TEXT AND BACKGROUND

Versions 39 & 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Commands@{UU}@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
Colour commands are available to change both:-

- The @{B}foreground@{UB} colour, i.e. the colour of the @{FG Shine}text itself@{FG Text},
  with the commands:-

  - @{"FG <colour>" LINK "Fg"}   in versions 39 and 40
  - @{"APEN <n>   " LINK "APen"}   in version  40

    The main difference between these two is that \@{FG} uses colour names
    whereas \@{APEN} uses pen numbers.

- The @{B}background@{UB} colour, i.e. the colour @{BG Shine}behind the text@{BG Back},
  with the commands:-

  - @{"BG <colour>" LINK "Bg"}   in versions 39 and 40
  - @{"BPEN <n>   " LINK "BPen"}   in version  40

    The main difference between the two is that \@{BG} uses colour names
    whereas \@{BPEN} uses pen numbers.

If you want to ensure that your colours are visible to all users of Amigas
from AmigaDOS/Workbench 3.0 onwards (version 39) then you should use the
\@{FG <colour>} and \@{BG <colour>} commands in preference to the \@{APEN <n>}
and \@{BPEN<n>} commands.

I will discuss how to get @{FG Back}@{BG Text}reverse video@{FG Text}@{BG back} text in @{"another section" LINK "Reverse"}.

There is also a section on the @{"PARD" LINK "Pard"} command that can be used to get back to
normal.

This changes the text (foreground) colour using the names shown in the
following table. These colours relate to those used in the WB3 "Palette"
preferences program as follows:-

   <colour>       WB3 Palette Colour

For example:-

  \@{FG Text}The text will be in TEXT Colour
  \@{FG Shine}The text will be in SHINE Colour
  \@{FG Shadow}The text will be in SHADOW Colour
  \@{FG Fill}The text will be in FILL Colour

The actual colours that you will see will depend on how your palette
preferences program is set up.

If you are reading this with:-

- @{B}Amigaguide/Multiview version 39 or 40@{UB} then you will NOT be able to see the

    The text will be in BACKGROUND Colour
  
  because "Background" is the background colour and text in the same colour
  is invisible!!

TEXT JUSTIFICATION

Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Commands@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
There are three commands to control text justification:-

  \@{JCENTER} - To centre the text (Note that the American spelling is
               needed. The English & Australian spelling JCENTRE does not
               appear to work :-(

  \@{JLEFT}   - To align the text to the left edge of the window

  \@{JRIGHT}  - To align the text to the right edge of the window

For example, these lines:-

\@{JCENTER}\@{B}This line is centred
\@{JRIGHT}This line is right justified
\@{JLEFT}This line is back to default left justified\@{UB}

would appear like this:-

@{JCENTER}@{B}This line is centred
@{JRIGHT}This line is right justified
@{JLEFT}This line is back to default left justified@{UB}

(Users of versions 34 & 39 will not see the centre and right justifications.)

@{B}NOTE@{UB} - If you have two of the above commands on the same line such as in:-

\@{JCENTER}This line is centred\@{JLEFT}

with the intention of having the line centred and the line following it
left justified then @{B}THE LAST COMMAND IN THE LINE@{UB} will take precedence!!.
The above example would be @{B}left justified!@{UB}

@{B}You should only have ONE justification command per line!!@{UB}

INSERTING LINE & PARAGRAPH INDICATORS@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
There are two commands that allow you to tell Amigaguide/Multiview to act
as though there is one or more line feed characters in the text.

@{B}@{U}{LINE} - Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}

This is supposed the be equivalent to inserting one @{"line feed" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/LineFeed"} character
into the text display.

@{B}@{U}{PAR} - Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}

This is supposed to indicate an "End Of Paragraph" to @{"SMARTWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"}.

When SMARTWRAP is active it is therefore equivalent to having two @{"line feed" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"15}
characters in the text.

@{B}@{U}NOTE@{UB}@{UU}

I have found that {LINE} and {PAR} appear to @{"act in the same way" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/ToDo"29} as each
other.

@{B}With no wrapping commands@{UB} they both act as a single line feed character.

@{B}With@{UB} @{"WORDWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Wordwrap"}  they both act as a single line feed character.

@{B}With@{UB} @{"SMARTWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"} they both act as a double line feed character.

I would much rather insert the line feeds with the return key as this will
be @{B}recognised by all versions of Amigaguide@{UB} and it will avoid the
uncertainty of what these two commands will really do! It also makes for far
easier reading of the document while you are editing it in your word
processor or text editor!!

@{JLEFT}
If you wish to have:-

- paragraphs indented from the left edge of the display window,   and/or
- the first line of a paragraph indented from the rest of the paragraph

then you can use these commands:-

  @{" LINDENT " LINK "Lindent"}
  @{" PARI    " LINK "Pari"}
  @{" PARD    " LINK "Pard"}

{LINDENT <n>}

Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Commands@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
This causes the paragraphs to be indented by <n> spaces. It may be 0 or any
positive number. (@{B}WARNING @{UB}- do NOT use a negative number as it causes
problems!)

An example of LINDENT is:-

#{LINDENT 5}                              (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})

This would cause paragraphs to be set 5 spaces in from the left.

The command will act on all paragraphs until another #{LINDENT <n>} command
or a @{"PARD command" LINK "Pard"} is reached.

However, if the command is placed @{B}AFTER@{UB} the first paragraph then it @{B}WILL
NOT WORK@{UB} on the first line of the next paragraph but will work on
subsequent lines of that paragraph and on all lines of subsequent
paragraphs @{B}UNLESS@{UB}:-

 - when using @{"SMARTWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"} - there are at least TWO line feed characters
   between the {LINDENT <n>} command and the start of the next paragraph
 
 - when using @{"WORDWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/Wordwrap"} or no wrap command - there is at least one line
   feed character between the {LINDENT <n>} command and the start of the
   next paragraph 

This can be achieved by using the @{"PAR" LINK "LinePara"13} command after the #{LINDENT <n>}
command as in the following (but I @{"prefer the use of real line feeds" LINK "LinePara"31}):-

  .... end of paragraph
  #{LINDENT 5}#{PAR}                      (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})
  Start of new paragraph to be indented by 5 ....

{PARI <n>}

Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Commands@{UB}@{UU}
@{JLEFT}
This is @{B}supposed@{UB} to cause the @{B}first@{UB} line of a paragraph to be indented by
<n> spaces relative to the @{"LINDENT" LINK "Lindent"} number. For example:-

#{LINDENT 3}                              (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})
#{PARI 2}

The above lines are @{B}supposed@{UB} to cause an overall paragraph indent of 3 from
the left edge with a first line indent of 5 (3 + 2) from the left edge.

However, I have not been able to get it to work for anything but the very
first paragraph of a node and then only if @{"SMARTWRAP" LINK "AGHTW_Part3/SmartWrap"} is active.

It is supposed to accept negative numbers so that:-

#{LINDENT 3}                              (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})
#{PARI -2}

would cause an overall paragraph indent of 3 from the left edge with a
first line indent of 1 (3 - 2) from the left edge.

If anyone knows how to get this to work properly then please let @{"me" LINK "AGHTW_Boring_Stuff/Author"} know!

TAB COMMANDS

Version 40@{UU}@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
A @{B}TAB@{UB} character is the @{"ASCII code" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Ascii"} number 9.

Some word processors and text editors will insert the ASCII code 9 into the
text when the TAB key is pressed. Others will, instead, insert a number of
space characters to take the next character of text to the next tab stop.
These days, the better word processors and text editors (such as @{"AMIS" LINK "AGHTW_Boring_Stuff/HowWrote"8}) will
insert the tab code but display a number of spaces giving you a WYSIWYG
("What You See Is What You Get") effect.

Tab stops work so as to count a set number of character spots from the left
edge of the display window @{B}NOT@{UB} a set number of spaces after the previous
text character. Thus, if all tab stops are set to 8 (which is the Amigaguide
default) then each successive tab stop would be:-

              Characters  From     Next Text Character
               Left Edge That        Appears At This
              @{U}   Are Skipped   @{UU}   @{U}   Position Number  @{UU}

   1st Tab           8                     9
   2nd Tab          16                    17
   3rd Tab          24                    25
   4th Tab          32                    33
   etc.

This is illustrated by:-

1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
        a       ab      abc     abcd    abced   abcdef 

If tab stops were to be set to the irregular amounts of 3 10 17 22 27 45
instead of the default uniform number of 8 then the display would be like
this:-

1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   a      ab     abc  abcd abced             abcdef 

There are four Amigaguide TAB commands which allow you to:-

  @{" TAB <n>         " LINK "Tabn"}  - set the number for regular tab stops in lieu of
                        the default 8

  @{" SETTABS <n> ... " LINK "SetTabs"}  - set a number of irregular tab stops

  @{" CLEARTABS       " LINK "ClearTabs"}  - clear tabs set by \@{SETTABS <n> ...}

  @{" TAB             " LINK "Tab"}  - insert an actual tab code

If the document author does not use any tab commands, and/or if the reader
is using versions 34 or 39, then Amigaguide will default to a regular 8
characters for each tab code.

TAB <n>

Version 40 - LOCAL or GLOBAL Command@{UU}@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
This command allows you to set the number of spaces output by a TAB code.

It is not really an attribute command but I have grouped it with the other
tab commands (which are attributes) as it logically fits in with them.

It is used as follows:-

  #TAB <n>                                      (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})

where <n> is the number of space characters to be used in lieu of the TAB
code.

The tabs are set at  regular intervals of <n>. (Compare this to
@{"SETTABS <n> ..." LINK "SetTabs"} which can be used to set irregular tab settings).

For example:-

#TAB 2   will replace the default 8 with 2      (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})
#TAB 5   will replace the default 8 with 5

All TABs will be given this number UNLESS the {SETTABS <n> ...} command is
used in which case the TAB command appears to be ignored.

If used as a @{"Global" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Global"} Command then it will be used in ALL nodes unless there
is a @{"Local" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Local"} @{B}TAB <n>@{UB} or @{"SETTABS <n> ..." LINK "SetTabs"} command.

If used as a @{"Local" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Local"} command, then it only has effect in that node.

@{B}@{U}{SETTABS <n> ...} - Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
\@{SETTABS <n> ...} sets tabs to irregular settings as compared to @{"TAB <n>" LINK "Tabn"}
which sets them to regular settings.

It overrides the default tabs and the tabs set by the #TAB <n> command for
all text appearing in the node AFTER the #{SETTABS <n> ...} command.

It is used in this way:-

#{SETTABS <n> ... }                       (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})

where <n> is the number of character spots to be used for each successive
TAB code. The "..." means that you can use as many numbers as you like.

The first TAB code will use the first <n>, the second TAB code will use the
second <n> and so on.

Each <n> is the number of spaces from the start of the @{"physical line" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Physical"}. For
example, if you used:-

#{SETTABS 3 10 17 22 27 45}                 (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})

you would get the effect @{"demonstrated earlier" LINK "TabCommands"36}.

Each new logical line will start again at the first <n>.

If there are more TAB codes in the line than there are <n>s in the
{SETTABS <n> ...} command then subsequent TAB codes will use the default 8
character spots or, if a @{"TAB <n>" LINK "Tabn"} command is in effect, to the number
specified by the TAB <n>.

@{B}@{U}{CLEARTABS} - Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}

This command is used like this:-

  #{CLEARTABS}                              (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})

This will reset all TAB settings set by the @{"SETTABS <n> ..." LINK "SetTabs"} command to the
TAB settings set by the @{"TAB <n>" LINK "Tabn"} command or, if no TAB <n> command is in
effect, to the default TAB setting of 8.

{CLEARTABS} has no effect on tabs set with @{"TAB <n>" LINK "Tabn"}

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}HOW TO WRITE AMIGAGUIDE DOCUMENTS

@{B}@{U}\@{TAB} - Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}
@{JLEFT}
This command will output an actual TAB Code - i.e. ASCII code 9. This will
be expanded by Amigaguide to the default 8 character spots, or to the number
set up by the @{"TAB <n>" LINK "Tabn"} or @{"{SETTABS <n> ...}" LINK "SetTabs"} commands.

As far as I can see, there is no point in using this command if your text
editor can insert the TAB code (@{"ASCII" LINK "AGHTW_Part5/Ascii"} code 9) into the document.

Example:-

  There is a tab code between the arrows -->#{TAB}<--

  (remember that @{"# = @" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Important"})

This will appear like this:-

  There is a tab code between the arrows -->@{TAB}<--
12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

Note that the tab has put the <-- after the 6th tab stop:-

  6 tabs times default 8 = 48

@{B}Note@{UB} - if you are using Amigaguide @{B}version 34 or 39@{UB} then there will be
@{B}NO GAP@{UB} between the --> and the <--  because the {TAB} command will be
@{"ignored" LINK "AGHTW_Part1/Unrecognised"}. For the benefit of users of version 34 & 39, the above two lines
would look like this:-

  There is a tab code between the arrows -->    <--
12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

There IS a gap between the two arrows -->    <-- because I have used actual
spaces instead of the \@{TAB} command to let you see what would happen if you
were using version 40.

This command displays the word "AMIGAGUIDE" with the ® symbol, i.e.
"AMIGAGUIDE®".

The above is done without the {AMIGAGUIDE} command for the the benefit of
users with Amigaguide lower than v40.

For the benefit of users of Amigaguide v40, here it is with the
command: @{AMIGAGUIDE}

Note that the command displays it in bold print.

@{B}@{U}{BODY} - Version 40 - Local ATTRIBUTE Command@{UU}@{UB}

I have seen it stated that this command will restore normal format to text.

As yet I have not found any way in which it can be used.
