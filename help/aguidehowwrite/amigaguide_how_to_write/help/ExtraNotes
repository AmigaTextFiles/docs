@DATABASE "Help With something"

@NODE "MAIN" "Extra Notes"

This is the MAIN node of the file Help/ExtraNotes
and is not being used for the purpose of this exercise!!

The node being used is @{"Something" LINK "Something"}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Something" "ExtraNotes/Something"

This node is the one called from "How To Write Amigaguide Documents"
to demonstrate calling a node of another document.

It is in a completely separate document (disk file) to the document from
which it was called, i.e. "How To Write Amigaguide Documents Part 2"

(@{"Click here" SYSTEM "Run More AGHTW:Help/ExtraNotes"} to read the actual file "ExtraNotes" but to do so you must have
the program "More" in your path and you MUST have made the above assignment
by clicking on the previous "Click here" button in the original document!).

There is no point in reading the document using Amigaguide or Multiview as
that would not allow you to see all the Amigaguide style commands!!

If the above "Click here" button does not work for you then go to your
Directory Utility program (Directory Opus, DirWork, or similar) and read the
file from there. It is called "ExtraNotes" and is in a sub directory of this
archive called "Help".
