   (Public Domain) files such as ReadMe documents.

   PATH:
   SYS:Utilities

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   NOTES:
   Once an ASCII file has been loaded the following keys apply:

   SPACEBAR - Go forward one page.

   RETURN - Move down one line.

   H - Present you with a Help screen.

   Backspace - Go back a page.
