                                  DISKDOCTOR


   USE:
   Diskdoctor is a small utility which enables the user to salvage
   information from a corrupted disk.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>DISKDOCTOR DF0:

   NOTES:
   There are a few points which should be noted when using Diskdoctor.
   Firstly Diskdoctor should be used with extreme caution on FFS (Fast
   File System) disks.

   Secondly Diskdoctor was left out of Workbench 2.1 and 3.0 simply
   because it was very dodgy program to use and often made the problem
   worse.
