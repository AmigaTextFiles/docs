                                     CPU


   USE:
   CPU presents the user with information on there systems current
   processor setup. It also enables the user to change there CPU's
   memory cache settings.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>CPU (Default - displays CPU information)
   1>CPU CACHE
   1>CPU NOCACHE
   1>CPU FASTROM (Copy Kickstart ROM)
   1>CPU NOFASTROM (Delete Kickstart ROM from memory)

   NOTES:
   In the last example above an extension has been added which lets
   you copy your Kicktart ROM into FastRam. The advantage of this is a
   slight system speed up. However your CPU must be equipped with  
   an MMU for this to work.

   Below is a complete list of the available options which enable you to
   affect your processor setup.

   next system Re-boot)
