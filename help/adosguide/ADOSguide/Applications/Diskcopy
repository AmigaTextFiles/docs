                                   DISKCOPY


   USE:
   This application does exactly as the name implies-it copies disks.

   PATH:
   SYS:System

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>DISKCOPY DF0:
   1>DISKCOPY DF0: to DF1:

   NOTES:
   It is worth noting that to use Diskcopy you must supply the Device
   Name not the volume name.

   Also that Diskcopy will Format the Disk being copied to so there is no
   need to format it before hand.
