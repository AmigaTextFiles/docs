                                    EDIT


   USE:
   Edit is a text editor kind of like ED but not quite as powerful and
   userfriendly.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>EDIT S:Startup-Sequence

   NOTES:
   Edit does not have a menu interface like ED and so anything you want to
   do with Edit must be done in the Console window.
