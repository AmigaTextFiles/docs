   USE:
   ED is just one of the many text editors supplied with AmigaDOS. It
   enables the user to edit any Amiga text file from a Startup-Sequence to
   a script.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>ED S:Startup-Sequence
   1>ED DF0:Script1

   NOTES:
   To get ED to work you do not actually have to have an existing text file.
   Just make one up when you type in the command.

   ED can import ASCII text files only.
