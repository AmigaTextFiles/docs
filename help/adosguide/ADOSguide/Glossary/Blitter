                                   BLITTER


   DESCRIPTION:
   Amiga Hardware, designed to make copying data as quickly as possible.
   Given a source and destination the Blitter can copy data held in
   Chip Ram giving the main CPU time to do other things. 


   NOTES:
   - The Blitter was ideal for creating software sprites.

   - The Blitter could also draw lines.
