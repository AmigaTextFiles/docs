                               LOGICAL DEVICE


   DESCRIPTION:
   A Logical Device is a directory which has been assigned in the Amigas
   Startup-Sequence to appear as though it is a separate device (like
   the Floppy Drive DF0:)

   One example is the Logical Device Fonts: which is a reference to the
   real directory found on your Hard Drive.


   NOTES:
   None
