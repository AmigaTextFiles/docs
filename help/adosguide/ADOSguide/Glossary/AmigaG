                                 AMIGAGUIDE


   DESCRIPTION:
   AmigaGuide is the HyperText system used by the Amiga.

   It enables software developers and programmers the option to
   include point and click documentation along with their
   software.

   Every AmigaGuide document produced is basically a standard
   ASCII document except that it includes special tags which the
   AmigaGuide program will understand.
