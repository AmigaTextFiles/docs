                           --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                     CPU


   DESCRIPTION:
   At the heart of every Amiga is the CPU or `Central Processor Unit'.
   This is the chip which could be described as the Amigas brain. It
   is responsible for running the Operating System and any applications
   And keeps the rest of the computer going. The faster the CPU the
   faster the computer overall.


   NOTES:
   Amigas use the 68x range of Motorola processors which include the
   following:
        - 68000
        - 68020
        - 68030
        - 68040
        - 68060

   But recent developments in Accelerator cards have brought the PowerPC
   line of CPUs to the Amiga.
