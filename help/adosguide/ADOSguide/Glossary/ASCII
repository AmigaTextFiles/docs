                                    ASCII


   DESCRIPTION:
   ASCII (American Standards Code for Information Interchange) is a type
   of document file format similar to those produced by a word processor
   such as WordWorth or MS Word, except that ASCII is a very simple
   format in that it only contains information on Column and Row
   information and will not record the type of font used. Also underlining
   and Boldface information.


   NOTES:
   Because ASCII is such a simple format, it does have the advantage of
   being very portable meaning that virtually every word processor, text
   editor, Email client etc known to man will handle ASCII files with
   ease.
