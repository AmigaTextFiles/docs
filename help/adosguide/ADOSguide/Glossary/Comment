                                   COMMENT


   DESCRIPTION:
   A Comment is a bit of information which can be tagged to a file or
   directory.

   The comment can be anything from a personal note for the user or a
   note for others to see.

   Tagging a comment to a file will not in any way change or affect the
   file itself.


   NOTES:
   To view the comment use the AmigaDOS command "List" or from Workbench
   execute the Icons Information Window.
