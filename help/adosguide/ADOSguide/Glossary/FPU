                                     FPU


   DESCRIPTION:
   An FPU (Floating Point Unit) or Maths Co-processor is a chip
   specifically designed to assist the main processor in Floating
   point calculations.


   NOTES:
   This Chip can be very useful in speeding up programs which use
   heavy maths calculations like 3D RayTracing packages for instance
   or Spreadsheets.

   Most modern processors have an FPU built in to its architecture as 
   standard and as a result are usually much faster than external designs.
   The 68040 and 68060 processors have an FPU unit built in as does
   the PowerPC 603, 604 and 750 cpu's.
