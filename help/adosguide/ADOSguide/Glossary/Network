                                   NETWORK


   DESCRIPTION:
   A Network is the word used to describe the joining or linking together
   of 2 or more computers at once.

   When a computer is connected to a Network it will be able to share data,
   mail or resources such as printers, with the other computers connected
   to the same Network.


   NOTES:
   Networks come in two main types: Peer to peer, in which every computer 
   is an equal and shares with every other and Client-Server, in which a
   central Server computer provides resources to a collection of other
   systems.
