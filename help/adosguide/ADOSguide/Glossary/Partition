                           --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                  PARTITION


   DESCRIPTION:
   An area of space on a Hard disk.  They are often broken up into
   Partitions which act as separate devices, in the interests of
   speed and security.


   NOTES:
   Most Hard disks are split-up into 2 Partitions.  One for the
   AmigaOS and one for miscellaneous files.  However the Amiga
   is quite capable of supporting more.
