                                   CHIPRAM


   DESCRIPTION:
   Also known as Graphics Memory.  This is the area of the Amigas
   memory which can be directly accessed by the Amigas Custom Chips.


   NOTES:
   The problem with ChipRAM is that the main processor has to wait
   around twiddling its pins whilst the custom chips are accessing
   it.  So to speed up your Amiga always make sure your system has
   FastRAM on board.  (See FastRAM)
