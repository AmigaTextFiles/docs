                           --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                              STARTUP-SEQUENCE


   DESCRIPTION:
   The Startup-Sequence is the Amigas primary script file. It contains
   information needed for the Amigas Operating System to load and
   function properly.


   NOTES:
   The Startup-Sequence file is basically a long list of AmigaDOS
   commands and so can easily be customised.
