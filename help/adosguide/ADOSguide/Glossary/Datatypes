                                  DATATYPES


   DESCRIPTION:
   Datatypes are an integral part of the Amigas Operating system.
   They are in essence small programs which when installed on your
   system allow your computer to read different file formats,
   depending on what you have installed.


   NOTES:
   Some applications like Web Browsers rely heavily on Datatypes,
   and require you to have the necessary Datatypes installed before
   they will work.
