                                     AHI


   DESCRIPTION:
   AHI (Audio Hardware Interface) is a shareware Retargettable
   Audio System.  Similar in principle to CybergraphX, it allows
   software developers to support all 16-Bit sound cards by
   writing to just one standard.


   NOTES:
   Just like CyberGraphX this system will only work if AHI supports
   your chosen sound card.
