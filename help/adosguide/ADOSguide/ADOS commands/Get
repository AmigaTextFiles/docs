                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                   GET


   USE:
   This command is similar to GETENV but it retrieves the value of a LOCAL
   environmental variable.

   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>ECHO "Test is $ test"
   Test is local

   NOTES:
   The Doller ($) operator in the above example informs AmigaDOS to read
   and display the test variable.
   (see also GETENV covered in Commands)
