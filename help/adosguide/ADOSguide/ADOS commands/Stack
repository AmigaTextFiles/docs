                                   STACK


   USE:
   Every AmigaDOS command requires a certain amount of `Stack' to use
   as workspace while it operates.

   Stack allows you to change or read the current Stack value in Bytes.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>STACK (Returns current Stack size)
   1>STACK 6000 (Change Stack size)

   NOTES:
   It should be noted that all processes launched from the Shell will
   adopt the current priority and Stack size, this includes any new Shells.

   Warning: If you have set a new Stack size and it is too low, your
            Amiga could well crash, taking down your whole system.
