                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                  ICONX


   USE:
   IconX is not so much a command but a platform for launching AmigaDOS
   scripts from Workbench.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   (Options)
   WINDOW=CON: 0/0/400/200/INSTALL_Scripts
   WINDOW=AUX: 01

   NOTES:
   WINDOW= This allows you to define a windows specification for IconX to
           open when it executes the script.

   DELAY=  This defines the number of seconds IconX will wait before closing
           the console down.  If a delay of 0 is entered IconX will wait for
           a CTRL-C key combination.

   These options should be defined in the Tooltypes array found by selecting
   "Information" from the Workbench menu.
