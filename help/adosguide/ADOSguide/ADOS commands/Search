                                   SEARCH


   USE:
   Search is the AmigaDOS search utility. It allows you to find strings
   embedded within files.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>SEARCH Strings:#? /* ALL

   NOTES:
   In the above example Search will attempt to search all sub directories
   and files within the "Strings" directory.

   Search is not all that intelligent and will sometimes try to search
   through binary (code) files as well which will bring up some very
   strange results on screen.
