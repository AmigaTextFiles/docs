                          --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                   ALIAS


   USE:
   Alias is a simple command which enables you to tailor AmigaDOS to your
   own needs.  It does this by letting you change commonly used expressions
   and commands.

   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0 (enhanced)

   EXAMPLES:
   1>ALIAS a CD DF0: (if you prefer your drives named A, B etc.)
   1>ALIAS del Delete (changing the Delete command).

   NOTES:
   Alias can also disable specified commands which is particularly useful if
   you have a network setup and want to stop a user from executing the
   Format, Copy, commands etc:

   1>ALIAS Format <space><return>
   1>ALIAS Copy <space><return>

   The space after each command disables it.
