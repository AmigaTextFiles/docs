                                  SETMAP


   USE:
   This command patches the system so that the keys you press generate
   the correct code.  In turn displaying the correct character on screen.

   Setmap executes the keymap file which is the file containing the
   keyboard layout information.  The reason for this is that different
   countries have different keyboard styles.

   PATH:
   SYS:System

   SYSTEM:
   2.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>SETMAP DF0: Devs/Keymaps/My Keymap

   NOTES:
   You can also generate new keymap files to assign ASCII strings to the
   function keys etc.  But this may require an extra piece of software.
   (e.g. KeymapED)
