                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                  MOUNT


   USE:
   This command is used to add new devices to the Amiga system, like Ram
   drives for example.  It should not be confused with "[mounted]" disks.

   It is rarely necessary to use this command these days because most
   hardware devices like disk drives and RAM expansions auto-mount and
   usually some kind of installation software is supplied. 

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>MOUNT RAD:
   1>MOUNT PIPE:

   NOTES:
   With AmigaDOS 2.1 machines you can now mount several devices at once by
   just using one line of commands.
