                          --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                   COPY


   USE:
   Copy is the AmigaDOS command which is used to copy individual
   directories or files to another device within the system.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>COPY FROM DF0:Extras TO RAM:Extras
   1>COPY FROM DF0:C/addbuffers/cpu TO DF1:C
   1>COPY FROM SYS:devs TO RAM:devs ALL

   NOTES:
   The FROM and TO commands are purely cosmetic and you do not have to
   include them.  They are only there to give the user a better
   understanding of what is happening.

   You can also copy separate files to other devices like a Printer for
   instance:
   1>COPY DF0:Scripts/Text1 TO PRT:

   But obviously you can only Copy text files to the printer device.

   It is also worth noting that Copy will create a directory for you when
   needed and also any sub-directories within your original directory will
   also be created.  However Copy will NOT make a copy of any files
   situated with in those sub-directories unless specified. The quickest
   way around this is to include the ALL Option at the end of the command 
   line. (See example 3 above)
  
   This will copy all Directories, Sub-directories and files.
