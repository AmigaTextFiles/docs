                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                RESIDENT      


   USE:
   The Resident command let's you hold copies of AmigaDOS commands in RAM.

   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>RESIDENT
   1>RESIDENT C:IF

   NOTES:
   The only advantage to using this command is that holding commands in
   RAM instead of on a disk may speed up certain AmigaDOS processes.
