                          --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                    CD


   USE:
   The CD (current directory) commands job is to give you an easy way of
   changing your current directory.

   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>CD DF0: (makes DF0 the current directory)
   1>CD devs: (go straight to devs directory)
   1>CD (to find out the current directory)

   NOTES:
   This command reminds me a lot of the PCs operating system and how awkward
   it is to move between directories etc.
   Thankfully this command is now virtually useless as AmigaDOS will let
   you change directories, devices etc.  Without even touching CD.
   (see example below).

   1>DF0: (change device to DF0)
   1>Workbench3.0:Storage (change device to workbench3.0 and goto directory
                           storage).
