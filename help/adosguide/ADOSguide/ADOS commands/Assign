                          --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                  ASSIGN


   USE:
   Assign's primary use is to Assign logical directories to the system and
   under AmigaDOS any directory or path can be made equivalent to a logical
   device.

   So for instance if you had a directory called Pictures located in HD1:
   Software/PPaint/Pictures it would take you quite a while to find it.
   But with the Assign command you can cut out the middle men and open the
   Pictures drawer straight away.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>ASSIGN (default)
   1>ASSIGN GAMES: HD1:Entertainment/Games
   1>ASSIGN FONTS: SYS:fonts RAM:Morefonts DF0:Fonts2

   NOTES:
   The Assign command can be divided into three separate areas: Volumes,
   Directories, Devices.
   -Volumes are the names of mounted disks which have been labelled or
    inserted into the machine.

   -Directories are basically there to divide all of the different files up
    and place them together according to the nature of that file.
    (e.g a pictures directory would amazingly contain picture files)

   -Devices defines the different storage systems or read only devices
    connected to your system

   Assign takes multiple arguments so it is possible to assign more than
   one directory or path to the same logical name. (see example 3 above)
