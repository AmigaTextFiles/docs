                                ADDBUFFERS


   USE:
   Addbuffers allocates a small amount of RAM to act as a sector cache or
   buffer.  This has the effect of speeding up system loading times.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>ADDBUFFERS HD0: (Default)
   1>ADDBUFFERS DF0: 22
   1>ADDBUFFERS DF1: 44

   NOTES:
   Remember that allocating only a small amount of memory could slow down
   your system.  All that is usually required is one complete cylinder's
   worth of information:
   (20-25 buffers)

   1 sector = 512 bytes
   1 buffer = 512 bytes
   1 track  = 11 sectors
   2 sides  = 2 tracks (or 1 cylinder

   By not supplying an argument for the number of buffers, the command
   returns the number of cache buffers currently allocated to your 
   specified device. (see example 1 above)
