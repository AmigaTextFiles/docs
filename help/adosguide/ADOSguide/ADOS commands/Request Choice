                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                              REQUESTCHOICE


   USE:
   The RequestChoice command enables the user to send there own defined
   alert requester to the screen.  This is used to gain information from 
   the computer user.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>REQUESTCHOICE >ENV:Answer "AmigaDOS 1" "Have you got 2?" "YES" "NO"
   "CANCEL"

   NOTES:
   The number of buttons you apply to the requester is only limited by the
   width of the screen, but in general it is best to keep the requester as
   short as possible.

   Below is a complete example of how the RequestChoice command would be
   used within a script.
 
   
   REQUESTCHOICE >ENV:Answer "AmigaDOS 1" "Have you got 2?" "YES" "NO"
   "CANCEL"

     IF $Answer EQ "0" 

       echo "Not sure eh?"

     ENDIF

     IF $Answer EQ "1"

       echo "Version 2 is available now for download"
     
     ENDIF

     IF $Answer EQ "2"
   
      echo "Hope you are finding it useful."

     ENDIF


   The buttons are numbered from 1 upwards from left to right, with the
   exception of the extreme righthand button: this always returns 0 and
   should be kept as a CANCEL gadget.
