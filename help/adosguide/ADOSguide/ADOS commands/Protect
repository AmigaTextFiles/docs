                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                 PROTECT


   USE:
   Associated with every AmigaDOS command are a set of 5 Protection Flags.
   This command enables you to alter these flags so that you can change
   certain aspects of the file (e.g. Whether it can be deleted or not).

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>PROTECT Userfile RWE
   1>PROTECT Userfile +A (sets the file with flag A)
   1>PROTECT Userfile -DW (Resets the file)

   NOTES:
   To set the protection flags just include the letter of the protection
   flag after your file name.

   Protection Flags:
                                A = Archive        R = Readable
                                W = Writable       E = Executable
                                D = Deletable      P = Pure
                                S = Script

  
   A selection of flags can be set or reset at once without affecting the
   status of the others. Also more than one flag can be altered at a time.
