                                   RELABEL


   USE:
   Relabel's main purpose is to rename volumes or mounted devices such as
   HD0 and DF0.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>RELABEL drive DF0: Name Mydisk
   1>RELABEL Mydisk: ADOS Guide

   NOTES:
   Once you Relabelled a disk you must re-insert the disk if you are using
   it with Workbench.

   Please note that Relabel only works within AmigaDOS and so when you go
   to access the disk through Workbench, the system will ask you for the
   previous named disk to be inserted. This is because Relabel does not
   tell Workbench about the changes made.
