                                    ASK


   USE:
   When executing a script file it may be necessary to acquire additional
   information from the user.  By using command you can do just this task.


   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
    ECHO "Do you want to delete all of the selected files?
    ASK "Press Y or N"
    IF WARN
    ECHO "You pressed Y"
    ELSE
    ECHO "You pressed N"
    ENDIF

   NOTES:
   Ask can only be used as part of a script file.

   Ask acts on a simple Y or N basis only to a question (Y=yes, N=no),
   if the user was to simply press return and not press either then Ask
   would interpret this as pressing the N key.
