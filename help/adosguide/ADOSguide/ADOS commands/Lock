                                   LOCK


   USE:
   Locks purpose within AmigaDOS is to inhibit write access to FFS (Fast
   File System) partitions on Hard Disks.

   Lock is only valid until the next system reboot.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>LOCK DH0: ON (locks hard disk partition DH0)
   1>LOCK C: ON (locks the C assignment)
   1>LOCK DH0: OFF (removes lock)

   NOTES:
   Lock offers no protection against Viruses or other non AmigaDOS write
   access.

   With version 2.0 of AmigaDOS Lock was upgraded so that it is now able to
   work on all disk partitions regardless of filing system.

   It is also now possible to Lock Floppy disks as well.

   1>LOCK DF1: ON

   Please note however that the command locks the DF1 device not
   individual disks.
