                           --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                   SETFONT              


   USE:
   Setfont lets you change the font face of the current window.

   This command requires two arguments - the Font name and the size.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0 (enhanced)

   EXAMPLES:
   1>SETFONT Sapphire 14
   1>SETFONT Sapphire 15 scale

   NOTES:
   Setfont will only look for fonts in the fonts directory found in your
   Workbench partition.

   The second example above has an extension added called Scale. This will
   AutoScale the font to another size if Setfont has been unsuccessful
   in finding your chosen Font size.
