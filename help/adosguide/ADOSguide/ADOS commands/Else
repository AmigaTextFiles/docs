                                   ELSE


   USE:
   Else is part of the IF....Endif Construct.  Basically if the If part of
   the script file fails then control jumps to the Else part and continues
   to run until an Endif is reached.

   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>ELSE (written in script files as shown with no attachments)

   NOTES:
   Else can only be used in script files and is meaningless outside
   an IF...ENDIF.
