                                 LOADWB


   USE:
   Loadwb loads and activates the Workbench program.  It is important to
   note however, that Loadwb is not the complete program.  This command
   merely activates it.

   This command is normally executed as part of the Startup-Sequence script.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1 (enhanced), 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>LOADWB
   1>LOADWB -debug

   NOTES:
   The following options are determined directly from the Workbench.

   DEBUG - Activates a sub menu with two options:
           DEBUG and FLUSH LIBS.
           The DEBUG option activates ROM WACK, the serial debugger.  And
           FLUSH LIBS causes Workbench to free up memory.

   DELAY - The DELAY switch is provided to make Workbench wait for 3 seconds
           before starting.

   NEWPATH - This switch can be used with Loadwb at any time to resnapshot
             the current path settings.

   CLEANUP - This switch does a cleanup as soon as Workbench starts.
