                                     SET


   USE:
   The Set command is used to define local environmental variables.

   For most purposes there is no difference between a local and global
   variable, but it is worth pointing out that a local variable has
   priority over its global cousin. Local variables are local to the Shell
   that Sets them.

   PATH:
   Internal

   SYSTEM:
   2.0, 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>SET (Default)
   1>SET (Variable)-insert variable here

   NOTES:
   The default example above lists the current local environmental
   variables.
