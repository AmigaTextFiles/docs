                         --AMIGADOS GUIDE V2.6--
                                 INSTALL


   USE:
   The main use of this command is to prepare boot disks so that when they
   are inserted upon startup the computer will identify the disk and start
   using it.

   PATH:
   C:

   SYSTEM:
   2.0 (enhanced), 2.1, 3.0

   EXAMPLES:
   1>INSTALL DF0:
   1>INSTALL DF1:
   1>INSTALL DF1: FFS
   1>INSTALL DF0: CHECK

   NOTES:
   The FFS attachment in the 3rd example above instructs Install to write
   a FFS (fast file system) bootblock. (see Format covered in applications)
 
   The CHECK attachment in the last example is used to determine if the
   disk has a valid bootblock or not and will also give information on the 
   type of file system used.

   It is important to note that merely installing a disk does not constitute
   a complete workbench disk.
