@node Introduction "ADOS V2.6 Documentation"

@{b}Introduction@{ub}
@{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}

  Welcome to AmigaDOS Guide V2.6 the latest version in my AmigaDOS
  Guide software series.  Version 2.6 includes many enhancements
  over previous versions, but the biggest change of all and one which
  many people have asked for is the ability to install to HardDrive.
    
  The idea behind this software is that you have a reference manual
  which you can easily refer to if the need arises.  And also one which
  doesnt eat up precious system memory and resources.

  I hope you gain alot of use out of AmigaDOS Guide and if you have 
  any comments, queries or ideas (good or bad) please do not hesitate to
  send them to me.  All feedback received is much appreciated.

@node Requirements "ADOS V2.6 Documentation"

@{b}Requirements/Loading@{ub}

  Workbench 2.0 or greater.

@{b}Hard Disk Installation:@{ub}

  To install to HardDrive firstly open up your destination directory in
  Workbench, then Drag the ADOSguide disk icon to that directory, a
  directory called ADOSguide will be created there.

  In fact you can install AmigaDOS Guide to virtually any device such
  as the Ram Disk or even the RAD.device simply by using the same
  method as above.

@{b}Using AmigaDOS Guide V2.6@{ub}
@{b}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}

  AmigaDOS Guide uses a Point and Click Interface so it is very easy
  to use.  Also this version includes Online documentation which explains 
  everything you need to know.

  AmigaDOS Guide has been split into 5 separate subjects, these are:
   ADOS Commands
   ADOS Applications
   ADOS Errors
   Workbench 3 Progs
   Amiga Glossary

  When you click on your chosen subject you will find a file requester
  filled with names relating to that subject.  From there you can then
  click on whatever it is you are looking for.


@{b}Misc@{ub}
@{b}~~~~@{ub}

  Within the ADOS Commands and ADOS Applications you will see a button
  called "ADOS Shell".  This button will allow you to open a Shell
  terminal.  To get at it you will need to click on the Multi-tasking
  gadget at the top right hand corner of the screen. Alternatively
  you can Iconify the Interface by clicking on the small Blank Box in
  the top left corner of the screen.

  On the Main Menu you will notice a button called "Additional Info".
  This as the name suggests will provide you with additional information
  on devices etc. Which may be of some use when using certain Commands
  etc.

  To Quit out of AmigaDOS Guide V2.6 simply goto the menu bar at the top
  and press the Right mouse button then select quit.
