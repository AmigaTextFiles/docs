                             Disk Write Protected


   DESCRIPTION:
   This one should not be too difficult to figure out.  Basically if you
   come across this error you are trying to write to a disk which has the
   write protect tab enabled.

   ADOS CODE:
   214

   REMEDY:
   Simply disable the write protect tab.

   It may be that you are trying to write to a disk which is not meant
   to be written to, such as a commercial software disk.
