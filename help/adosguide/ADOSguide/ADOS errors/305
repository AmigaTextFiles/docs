                            File Is Not Executable


   DESCRIPTION:
   This error only occurs when you have tried to run a file which is not
   a legal AmigaDOS file.

   ADOS CODE:
   305

   REMEDY:
   The only way you can fix this problem is if the file in question is a
   script file.  If this is the case then you must use either the Execute
   command (covered in commands) or set the S protection Flag.
   (see protect command)

   Some files may need another program present before it can be executed.
