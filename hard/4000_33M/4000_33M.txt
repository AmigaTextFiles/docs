	4000/040 running at 33 MHz (!).


IMPORTANT: this is a modification on A3640. HW mani-
pulation skill is requested so MAKE CARE !


This is a tip for everyone want to accellerate his
A4000/040 spending only $ 10.

Cause of my ray-tracing jobs, i need more MIPS by CPU.
CPU accellerators for A4000 are too expensive, so i've
tried to modify CPU clock directly on CPU board A3640
rev. 3.0. First i've tried a standard 66 MHz oscillator
used in PCs DX2, but it failed. After i've tried a      
66.7 MHz and finally it works fine, great !
Using AIBB 6.5, the improvement is 35 % more respect
A4000/040 25 MHz. This method raise the latency time
of CPU vs memory, from 8.1 to 9.1.
To prevent CPU damage an additional coling fan is  
needed on CPU ($ 10).
                          
I didn't test this solution on other configuration,
so for every problem contact me at the following
