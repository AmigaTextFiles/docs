               JOYSTICK/MOUSE ADAPTOR FOR THE CDTV
               ===================================

              Copyright August 1994, Darren Ewaniuk

This text will show you how to add standard joystick/mouse ports
onto your CDTV at a very low cost.  You will need to open up your
CDTV to perform this, but you will not need to cut or solder to any
components of your CDTV.  This adaptor, once you make it up, will
consist of a DIP chip socket, two ribbon cables, and the joystick
ports themselves.  Installation consists of removing a socketed chip
from your CDTV motherboard, installing the adaptor's socket in its
place, and replacing the chip in the adaptor's socket.

=====================================================================

Parts required:

*       2  -  Male DE-9 Joystick port connectors (see note 1 below)
*       1  -  40 pin machine pin DIP socket (see note 2 below)
*       90 cm (3 feet) of 10 conductor ribbon cable


Note 1: For a more professional look (and easier construction) the
        ribbon-cable (IDC) connectors are recommended.  If you cannot
        find these, you can use solder-cup type connectors, but this
        means a bit more soldering work and a flimsier and messier
        looking cable.

Note 2: Machine pin (round hole) sockets are greatly recommended
        because they allow you to solder to the top of the socket
        pins without affecting the socket's ability to be seated in
        the CDTV motherboard's socket.  If you are a skilled
        solderer, you could use standard DIP sockets, but this is not
        recommended.

=====================================================================

Construction:

1.      First, cut the ribbon cable into two equal 45 cm (18 inch)
        lengths.  From each cable, remove the tenth conductor (the
        one on the edge opposite the striped conductor).

2.      Next, put the DE-9 joystick connectors on one end of each of
        the ribbon cables.  The procedure will vary depending on
        which type of connectors you have.  Follow 2(a) if you have
        ribbon cable connectors, 2(b) if you have solder cup
        connectors.

        2(a).   If you have IDC ribbon cable connectors, lift up the
                end cap so you can slide the ribbon cable between it
                and the connector, or if you cannot do that with the
                connectors you have, remove the end cap to expose the
                crimping prongs.  Decide whether you want the ribbon
                up or down, and make up both cables the same way by
                having the free end of the ribbon cable coming out at
                the side of the connector with either the wide or
                narrow side of the 'D' respectively.  Align the
                stripe end of the ribbon cable with the pin 1 prong
                (pin numbers can be read from the front of the
                connector where you would normally plug in your
                mouse).  The end of the cable should be flush with
                the end of the connector.  Then place the end cap on
                top of the ribbon cable if you removed it, and using
                a vise, clamp, or hammer, squeeze the end cap onto
                the connector until the clips on the side lock the
                connector together.  Repeat the procedure for the
                second ribbon cable.

        2(b).   If you have solder cup connectors, split apart all of
                the wires from one end of each ribbon cable so that
                they are separated from the other wires for about
                12 mm (1/2 inch).  Strip the insulation from each of
                these wires for about 2 mm (1/16 inch) and tin them
                with solder.  Solder the striped wire to pin 1 of
                the connector (on the upper pins), the second wire to
                pin 6 (on the lower pins), the third wire to pin 2,
                etc. as shown below.  When all 9 pins are soldered,
                repeat with the other ribbon cable.

                    striped wire -> pin 1
                    second wire  -> pin 6
                    third wire   -> pin 2
                    fourth wire  -> pin 7
                    fifth wire   -> pin 3
                    sixth wire   -> pin 8
                    seventh wire -> pin 4
                    eighth wire  -> pin 9
                    ninth wire   -> pin 5


3.      Prepare the first cable for the mouse port.  Split apart all
        of the wires from the remaining end of the ribbon cable so
        that they are separated from the other wires for about 50 mm
        (2 inches).  Cut off 25 mm (1 inch) of each wire except for
        the fourth and sixth wires. Leave the fourth wire long, and
        cut 13 mm (1/2 inch) from the sixth wire.  This will make the
        connections to the DIP socket tidy.  Then strip about 2 mm
        (1/16 inch) of insulation from each wire, and tin with
        solder.  Solder each wire to the appropriate DIP socket pin,
        as shown below.  Curl each wire around the top, thicker area
        of the DIP socket pin and solder it using a minimum amount of
        solder.  Then cut off any excess wire.  Keep the narrow part
        of the pins clean of solder so that they can fit in the
        socket.  Ensure that the wires and solder do not touch other
        pins.

            striped wire -> pin 9     YB1
            second wire  -> pin 5     FIR0
            third wire   -> pin 8     XA1
            fourth wire  -> pin 1     +5V
            fifth wire   -> pin 7     YA1
            sixth wire   -> pin 12    GND
            seventh wire -> pin 6     XB1
            eighth wire  -> pin 4     POT0Y
            ninth wire   -> pin 3     POT0X


4.      Prepare the second cable for the joystick port.  First, split
        apart the ribbon cable for 75 mm (3 inches).  Cut off 50 mm
        (2 inches) of each wire except for the fourth and sixth
        wires.  Again, leave the fourth wire long, and cut off about
        37 mm (1-1/2 inch) from the sixth wire.  Strip the wires, tin
        with solder, and solder the wires to the DIP socket.  Note
        that pin 12 (ground) will have wires from both joystick ports
        attached to it.

            striped wire -> pin 20    YB2
            second wire  -> pin 16    FIR1
            third wire   -> pin 19    XA2
            fourth wire  -> pin 30    +5V
            fifth wire   -> pin 18    YA2
            sixth wire   -> pin 12    GND
            seventh wire -> pin 17    XB2
            eighth wire  -> pin 15    POT1Y
            ninth wire   -> pin 14    POT1X


5.      Double-check that the ribbon cable wires are connected to the
        correct pins on the DE-9 connectors and the DIP socket, and
        that there are no wires or solder bridges between adjacent
        pins.  Then proceed to the installation step.

=====================================================================

Installation:

1.      Remove all power to the CDTV by unplugging the power cable.

2.      Carefully place your CDTV on a static-free mat, and use
        a static-free wristband if you have one.  If you don't have
        these, at least do this work on a worktable in a room without
        a rug after you have grounded yourself.

3.      Open the top cover by unscrewing the four screws in the sides
        and the two screws in the top back of the CDTV.  Once the
        cover is open, do not touch any components unless told to.
        Many of the components could be damaged by a static charge,
        and even with power off, there could be dangerous voltages
        present on some components.

4.      Find U75, a 40 pin DIP chip at the front centre of the CDTV
        motherboard.  The chip will be marked "252609-02".  It may
        have a different number after the dash, but the first part of
        the number should be the same.  Carefully remove it by prying
        it up using a flat blade screwdriver from the sides, making
        sure that you do not bend the pins.  Remember the orientation
        of this chip (the notch on one end should be on the side
        closest to the right of the CDTV).

5.      Carefully plug the socket of the adaptor cable into the
        socket you just removed the chip from.  Pin 1 of the adaptor
        socket should be towards the right, so that the ribbon cables
        exit towards the back of the CDTV.

6.      Replace U75 in the adaptor's socket, keeping it in the same
        orientation it was when you removed it.  Make sure that it is
        firmly seated and that none of the pins are bent out of the
        socket.

7.      Route the joystick adaptor cables to a suitable position
        outside your CDTV.  If you do not have a SCSI-TV, then
        you can route the cables out the expansion connector space.
        To do this, remove the expansion slot cover by removing the
        two screws holding it in place, and temporarily remove the
        ribbon cable at the back left of the CDTV.  Now route the
        two joystick cables through the hole at the back left of the
        chassis, behind the CD-ROM drive, then out the expansion
        hole.  For a simple strain relief, arrange the connectors so
        that the ribbon cables exit the top of the expansion hole,
        then bolt the expansion plate back on so that the top of it
        holds the ribbon cables in place.  If you want to make a
        professional looking system, then cut or punch out DE-9 holes
        in the expansion plate and mount the joystick connectors on
        it.  Remember to replace the ribbon cable at the back left of
        the CDTV when you are finished.

8.      Replace the top cover of the CDTV, securing the four screws
        on the sides and the two on the back.

=====================================================================

Notes:

1.     This adaptor cable operates just as if you attached a 'Y'
       cable to the joystick/mouse ports of a normal Amiga.  Thus,
       attaching a mouse to the mouse port may have unexpected
       effects, since you are effectively putting it and the
       CDTV remote's 'infrared mouse' in parallel.  Because of the
       way a mouse works, two mice normally cannot share the same
       port.  If you wish to use the CDTV remote in mouse mode, you
       must remove the mouse from the mouse port.  If you wish to use
       a mouse in the mouse port, you must not move the mouse from
       the CDTV remote while it is in mouse mode.  If you wish to
       permanently use the mouse in the mouse port, and disable the
       CDTV infrared controller's mouse mode, then remove U75, bend
       up pins 6, 7, 8, and 9, and replace it back in the adaptor's
       socket.  This will disable the remote's movements in mouse
       mode only, while still keeping its joystick functions and
       mouse buttons intact.

2.     If you wish to use an analog joystick with this adaptor, you
       may have to remove U75, bend up pins 14 and 15, and replace
       it in the adaptor's socket.


=====================================================================

Warning and Disclaimer:

Installing this adaptor will void your CDTV's warranty, since it
requires opening your CDTV's case.  There are static sensitive
devices and possibly dangerous voltages in your CDTV.  Do not touch
any components while the cover is open.  If this adaptor is put
together incorrectly, it may damage your CDTV.  Verify that the
connections are correct and that there are no solder bridges when
constructing the cable, and verify that there are no bent pins or
touching pins when installing the adaptor.  The builder of this
