This is a solution to the problem you will encounter if you build your A1200
into a tower:

It isn't easy to create a RESET with an extern A2000 keyboard, therefore
you need an extra switch. There exist different possibilities to solve the
problem (some are known to you already, I'm sure)...

At first, I had a reset switch that was soldered somewhere to an IC. Then I
examined the Amiga board a bit closer and was sure that the TP pads had been
constructed by Commodore (or AT...) to test the boards after their assembly.
( I think TP is for "Test Point".) You have to establish resets to test a
board. So I got my multimeter and compared the voltages and behaviour of my
old reset switch and the TP pads. So, I had this idea...

This is my proposal:

    A1200-Board (view from the top)

    |
    |------+
    |      |
    |    +-+
    | P  |
    | C  |
    | M  |
    | C  |
    | I  |
    | A  |
    |    |
    |    +-+
    |      |
    |------+
    |         TP1
    |   +----------+
    |   |**********< 1
    |   +----------+
    |
    |         TP2
    |   +----------+
    | 1 >**********|
    |   +----------+
    |O
    +--------------------------


You have to solder a 2-pin connector (like those on PC boards) to TP1 PIN 10
and PIN 9. The RESET switch of a standard PC tower can be connected to the
above connector.


I don't take any responsibility for this hack. It works fine with my
computer. DON'T USE THIS HACK, IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE, WHAT YOU'RE
DOING!
