A program to switch thru one of the Out-Ports of the TriplePlay-Midi-Inter-
face

After I've made  the  TriplePlay-Project  I've  discussed  with  Kjetil  S.
Matheussen  about  the  security of the little switch I've added to use the
TriplePlay with MIDI-software, that can't  control  the  PIN4  (Request  To
Send) and PIN20 (Data Terminal Ready) of the serial-port.

I asked him to write a little program that do this job by software.  So  he
made  this small program to set the default out port for the Triple Play or
Quadra Play midi-interfaces.

This program is the software alternative to the little switch in my TPP.
Both are possibilities to solve the same thing. But this program is able to
replace 3 (or 4 for the Quadra Play) switches.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Quadra Play is a one port enhanced  version  of  the  TriplePlay.  That
version  I've  not put in the public, because in the moment the software is
missing to use it.

This must be, we are poor ... :(

But I think it is NOT possible to damage the TPP-MIDI-Interface  with  this
program.

you  acknowledge  Ketil  S.  Mattheussen as the original author in any code

USAGE
-----

Put the program TPPset at a place you want, I recommend the C: directory.

AFTER (!) you  have  started  the  MIDI-program,  you  want  to  use  (like
"MIDIPlay")  with the TriplePlay, start TPPset with the portnumber you want
to use as argument in a CLI-window, and the requested port will be switched
thru.

Example:

TPPset 1      will switch the Out-Port 1 thru

Now you can connect the Out-Port 1 with your MIDI-equipment. Thats all :))!

Many thanks to the
