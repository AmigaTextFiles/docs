<h3>Fast sampler for your Amiga</h3><BR><BR>
<I>It works!</I>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD>MAX153</TD><TD><a href="http://www.maxim-ic.com">MAXIM</A> chip.<BR>
high speed, 8 bit ADC<BR>
660ns Conversion Time<BR>1Msps Throughput<BR>Low Power: 40mW (Operating mode), 5µW (Powerdown mode)
<BR>Single +5V or Dual +-5V Supplies<BR>
<BR><BR><B>Where to get?<BR>Best place is old GSM phone Motorola flare!<BR>Just open it and take it!</b>

</TABLE><BR><HR><BR>
Here it is Motorola Flare GSM phone without cover:<BR>
<img src="flare1.jpeg"><BR><BR>Locate this part in the phone:<BR>
<img src="flare2.jpeg"><BR><BR>and solder out this chip (MAX153):<BR>
<img src="flare3.jpeg"><BR>Now you can place it to Amiga audio sampler. (By the way, here you can find 68332 CPU which is brother of 68020 placed in A1200 :))
<BR><HR><BR></CENTER>
Search in old PCB boards or buy new chip: <B>74F04</B> or any from 74x04 familly. It is very common chip. I suggest you to find some in SOP/SMD package if you want to place your <B>Fast Amiga Sampler</B> in cable holder.
Also you need some discrete parts: 10 resistors ~30Ohm to 100Ohm, 2 pcs. ~3.3K, one trimmer ~10K. (<i>These details are not critical, use any in 30% range :)</i>)
Also you need some capacitors: 1 pcs 4.7µF, 2 pcs. ~0.1µF and maybe one 10µF.<BR>
(In my project I used all SMD parts. Why? You don't need to drill that damn small holes in PCB. Also if you want to you use my PCB you need to get them all SMD.
Where to get them? I used old 386 notebook :) some other junk and (<I>Oh my god!!</i>) my old bad A1200 :(). You can find this details in shop, but I think you need to buy atleast 100pcs...)<BR>

OK! We have all the stuff. Let's do it!<BR>
<B>Order of the work:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Make PCB. For some people it is very hard work. To help them here is <a href="sampler.pdf">Portable document file (.pdf)</a> to download and print. I think it is the best way to export PCB layout to any platform without any loss in quality.
If your hands are very steady, you can build this sampler "on the air" (Good luck).
<LI> Solder resistors, capcitors, socket and 74F04.
<LI> Check if you didn't make any error.
<LI> Plug it to your Amiga. (Don't forget to pray God for luck) Start software in sampling/monitor mode.
<LI> Check for signals with osciloscope.
<LI> Check if proper signals are on MAX153 traces:<BR>

</TABLE>
NC-no connection; +5V-Vdd,Vcc, power from Amiga; HI-logical "1", high, 2.4...5V;
0- 0V, GND, logical/analog ground; PULSE-short pulses of logical high at each sampling request; x-something from 0V to 5V.
<BR>
<LI> Disconnect all, solder MAX153 in.
<LI> Plug sampler to Amiga. Check if MAX153 is not hot. Start your samplig software in sample/monitor mode. You must see some signal on your screen. Conect sampler input to some audio source (LINE OUT). You must get some sound/noice image. Mute signal and use trimmer to adjust zero.
</UL>
<B>POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:</B><BR>
<UL><LI><B>NOT WORKING AT ALL</B>- your MAX153, 74F04 or 8520 is not working. Check if 74F04 is inverting signal from Amiga with osciloscope. If so, check if MAX153 pin 9 have pulse. This means that MAX153 is working. Check if some pulses are on D0...D7 lines. If so, you CIA (8520) is dead :(
<LI><B>50/60Hz OR HIGH FREQUENCY NOICE IN OUTPUT</B>- check if your Amiga and audio source are properly grounded. Especially you need to ground TV.
<LI><B>BAD QUALITY OF SOUND</B>- overload of sampler. Check your samples for square signals. If yes, use lower volume. If from LINE OUT, you need to build external atennuator (voltage divider).
<LI><B>WHEN I PLUG SOMETHING IT WORKS FOR A WHILE AND THEN SOUND DISSAPEARS</B>- DC present in Audio lines. Use proper C separattion, proper cable load. If you sample from POWER AMPL. output use 4..8Ohm load or connect speakers (not recommended)
