My name is Gabriele Peterle, and I'm an informatic engineering student at the
Padova university.
Excuse me for my poor english but I learn it by myself; I hope you'll be able
to understand.

Copyright and Distribution

This project is freeware, even because I invented nothing; I only read the
manuals and the A500 and A2000 schematics.
You can send me whatever you want, just to tell me if you liked it or not.
It can be distributed everywhere but please keep the archive intact.


History

I own my Amiga 500 since 1988.
As the AGA Amigas were available I was not so excited. The specs was not so
great compared to my system ( and compared to the "soon upcoming" AAA
chipset), so I decided to wait.
You all know what happened a couple of years later ....
Now I'm here waiting for a PPC Amiga, but in the meanwhile I added to my
trusty 500 the only thing it missed: 24 bit graphic !
There are a lot of graphics boards for A2000, but none for A500, so I
compared the schematics of the two systems and I added a full (?) 100 pin
Zorro2 slot to the 86 pin expansion port of the A500 (NOTE: This hack allows
to ADD a 100 pin Zorro2 slot keeping intact the 86 pin expansion port !!!!).


Limits

My system consists of:
   Amiga 500, motherboard rev.5 (originally with kickstart 1.2)
   A501 0.5 MB expansion memory in the trapdoor
   8375 Agnus (1 MB chip ram)
   ROM 2.04 (soon 3.1)
   Hardital Big Bang accelerating board with 68030/882 33 MHz, 8 MB 32bit
      FAST RAM, inserted in the 68000 socket.
   Hardital Synthesis SCSI controller with 80+170 MB Quantum Harddisks
      inserted in the 86 pin expansion port  ( NOT DMA )
   Picasso II graphic board in the added 100 pin Zorro2 slot.

This system works great since over 1 month.
If I'm not wrong the A1000 has the same 86 pin expansion port so this hack can
be adapted to work with this too.

I give NO WARRANTY this hack will work with other configurations; you had to
try by yourself and at YOUR OWN RISK !!!
If you do something wrong the consequences are unpredictable: maybe your Amiga
won't work and removing the hack will solve the problem, but it's possible
that you BLOW UP your computer and I have no responsibility !!!!

I chose a Picasso II, so this project is realized around it.
This hack uses NO EXTRAS CHIPS (in particular there's no Buster), thus this
slot can work with other than graphics boards but I think only one board can
be DMA (I have some doubts it will work with GVP boards, because they use DMA).
Also a Firecracker24 worked good with this hack.


Theoric realization

With reference to the included pic, the straight lines are really used by my
Picasso II board, dotted lines instead are possible links but I didn't
tested it.
The description is referred to my configuration; you change my SCSI controller
with your device inserted in the 86 pin expansion port, and my Picasso II with
the board you want to insert into the new slot.

Here I list the 100 pin Zorro 2 slot signals on the left, and the corriponding
signal taken from the A500 on the right. If in your user manual there are the
schemes, it can be useful to give it a look sometimes. Better if you can
compare the A2000 and A500 schemes.
There are some references to another hack I found on Aminet called 2000slot.lha
which can be found in the hard/hack directory (but this hack only allow to
_transform_ the 86 pin expansion slot to a 100 pin Zorro 2 slot); anyway it
can be useful to give it a look.


ZORRO 2 signals (the initial number    Where to find it on A500 (the initial
is the pin number on the 100 pin       number is the pin number on the 86 pin
Zorro slot)                            expansion port)

                                       In another hack (2000slot.lha) the
                                       author used the pin #8 of the expansion
                                       port but this gives -12 V !!!!!

                                        the expansion port and the #12 pin of

                                       I think this signal is a delayed AS*
                                       (pin #74). The author of 2000slot used
                                       +5 V (pin #5 or #6). I think it is used
                                       by DMA boards

94 BUSRST*                             I first tried the RST* signal (pin #53)
                                       It worked fine in 68000 mode, but I had
                                       big troubles in 68030 mode (yellow
                                       screen with flashing led).
                                       I solved all my problems using the A500
                                       RESET* signal. I took this from the #11
                                       pin of the U37 component of my rev.5
                                       motherboard (it's a 74LS32 (NAND gates))
                                       It is located under the internal floppy
                                       drive.
                                       If in your motherboard isn't there such
                                       a component, you can try to follow the
                                       RST* signal track and see if it passes
                                       through some AND/NAND/OR... gate(s) and
                                       exits unchanged (AND with +5v, or OR
                                       with GND, ...) and then use the output
                                       as BUSRST*.

Almost all the links are taken (in parallel) directly from the 86 pin port, so
you can solder a wire between the two corrisponding pins (one on the Amiga,
the other on the new slot).

The CONFIG_IN* and CONFIG_OUT* signals are connected "serially": the CONFIG_IN*
from the 86 pin expansion port is connected to the Picasso's CONFIG_IN* pin;
the CONFIG_OUT* signal from the Picasso is connected to the CONFIG_IN* of the
board inserted in the 86 pin expansion port (e.g. my SCSI controller);
Probably it's possible to change the config order (first the SCSI controller,
then the Picasso) but my SCSI board has no CONFIG_OUT* signal.
NOTE: it's important that the CONFIG_IN* of the 86 pin expansion port goes to
only one board or you'll have auto-configuration conflicts !!

The BUSRST* signal is taken from a 74LS32 chip on the A500 motherboard (under
the internal floppy drive); the 68000 RST* signal makes there a NAND (with
negated inputs) with 0, thus it exits unchanged but more stable (and a little
delayed), and then goes to the #94 pin of the Zorro 2 slot.
I tried, before, to use directly the RST* signal as BUSRST* but I had some
conflicts between the Picasso and the accelerating board during the reset
sequence (I think both boards tried to autoconfig itself in the same time
and/or in the same addresses).


Practical realization.

I rate the realization quite simple if you are expert with soldering and
testing electric circuits, quite hard (and dangerous for your Amiga) if you
have no idea about what you're doing.
You had to be very patient and make everything slowly with calm.

NOTE: my project uses NO EXTRA CHIPS !!!

It was impossible to me to found a 100 pin slot.
I went to a computer reparation center and there I obtained, for free, a
non-working 286 motherboard. I rip off from it 2 ISA (?) slots (62 pins
each); I cut it in the way that they can be aligned to form one 100 pin slot
(once the Picasso is inserted they won't move).
Then I used a 50 wires flat-cable (two 9 cm long pieces, aligned; keep these
cables as short as possible !) to make the connections between the 100 pin slot
and the 86 pin expansion port.
Note that the numer one pin on the A500 is to the rear of the upper side of
the motherboard, but the number one pin of the 100 pin slot is (looking at it
from above) to the rear of the left side.

I made all the solders in the "vias" (holes which bring a track from a face to
the other) on the SCSI board; the SCSI board is inserted, with its slot, in
the expansion port and the flat cables bring the signals to the new Zorro slot.
If you can't do like me, probably you must think about some other way to
connect the boards; you can make a connector which duplicates the signal of the
expansion port (from each pin start two wires, one for the 100 pin slot and the
other for the SCSI controller).
Other wires can be used for the BUSRST*, 7MHz, -5V,... connections.
You have to make all the connections your new Zorro 2 board requires.
CHECK EVERYTIME IF THE CONNECTION ARE NOT FAULTY AND THERE ARE NO SHORT
CIRCUITS !!!
