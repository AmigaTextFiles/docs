                   Some notes on the Continuity Tester.
                   ------------------------------------

  1) It is assumed, (one must never make assumptions) that you do NOT have
     a Multimeter/Multitester or if you do it has NOT got a LOW Ohms
     range on it.
  2) The Continuity Tester is for the people who do NOT own a Multimeter.
  3) It is for checking wires or lines between one point and another.
  4) View the ~Continuity_Tester.drawing~ for the construction of such an
     item. The drawing should have sufficient information in it to make the
     Continuity Tester, no description should be necessary.
  5) This device is for checking the wiring between the pins of the 25 Way
     ~D~ type plug of the Printer Cable in the ~Stage1_Parts_List~ and the
     bare wire ends at the opposite end of the cable after the Centronics
     Plug has been cut off.
  6) When one of the Crocodile Clips is connected to a pin on the 25 Way ~D~
     type connector and the other is connected to the CORRECT wire at the
     other end the lamp WILL light up.
  7) Slip a piece of heat shrink sleeving approximately 25mm long over the
     cut end of the Printer Cable. Do NOT shrink the sleeving yet.
  8) Strip off the outer covering of the Printer Cable approximately 100mm
     long.
  9) Part the braiding from the other wires and place insulation sleeving
     over the braiding.
 10) Place the Heat Shrink Sleeving, half over the main cable body and half
     over the wires and braiding.
 11) Using the hot soldering iron Heat Shrink the sleeving to make a good
     strain relief for the wires.
 12) Using the Continuity Tester check one wire at a time for a condition
     stated in Part 6). Connect the same pin number of the ~D~ type
     plug to the terminal pin number on the Bread Board Construction.
     That is Pin 1 of the Plug to Terminal Pin 1 of the Board and so on.
     Refer to the ~?.drawing~ files for further information.
 13) Double check your work. Check it again!!!.
 14) Tie Wrap the Strain Relief area to the Bread Board Construction.
     Look at the ~Board_Layout_1~ photograph for more information.
     This shows part of the ~Stage2~ construction also, so ignore these
     areas.
