    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    (This was checked on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations.)

    An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes. See the ~ReadMe-First~ file
    in the ~TestGear4~ drawer for more information.
