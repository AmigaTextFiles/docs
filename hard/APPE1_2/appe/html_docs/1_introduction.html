<TR><TD>First excuse my poor english.  i'm spanish.  :-)<BR><BR>In  Spain every next day is more hard to find suitable Joysticks to
use  in the Amiga, Here in Granada it's almost impossible, we need to find they  outside...  this is time consuming and expensive.  When i found it we
have other problem usually the Joystick have one or two buttons, this makes it  unusable  to play games on some emulators like WarpSnes or MamePPC that
requires  a  CD32  PAD to play games with more than two buttons...  But one day  looking  shops i see lots of PlayStation pads...  There are in a great
variety  of  colors,  forms...  and prices...  it's posible find cheap Pads here  next  of my home...  but we can't use they on my Amiga...  or not?...
if i can...  if i do...  and APPE was born!<BR><BR>By  now  APPE  emulates  the  way that a normal Amiga 3 button Joystick
operates  but  this  isn't the original idea the idea was to emulate a CD32 pad  using a PlayStation pad, but i can't because i haven't any idea on how
a  CD32  pad electronically works...  and the info available have errors or is incomplete.</TD></TR>
