<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3 COLOR=#00EEEE>How to get it working</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><BR>There are two ways to get your APPE working:<BR><BR>
<B>(1)</B> You can order it by <A HREF="mailto:ackman@mx3.redestb.es">mail to me</A> for only 16£, 48dm, or 24 euros. If
you buy it you obtain two benefices, first a <B><A HREF="4_assembled.html">quality assembled</A></B> inferface and second the <B><U>upgrades to versions 2 and 3 are for free</U></B>, simply sending me the
interface and the mail cost.<BR><BR><B>(2)</B> Also you can build your own one, but you need some electronical aknowledge, some ability and the components listed in the archive
<A HREF="5_schematics.html">APPE_SQ.GIF</A>, these components are cheap and simple to find except the <A HREF="6_connector.html">Pad connector</A>, the best way to obtain it is buying a pad extensor cable on any
console shop, and cutting the right connector. The heart of APPE is the PIC16F84 processor that needs the file APPE1_2.HEX to run.
<BR><BR>If you decide to mount it yourself this is GIFTWARE, you must <A HREF="mailto:ackman@mx3.redestb.es">send me</A> a gift. but if you decide to build lots of interfaces to sell it
and win money (ej any Amiga hardware manufacturer) please do a mention of the original author and <A HREF="mailto:ackman@mx3.redestb.es">send me</A> a percentage from the amount. :) Think
that you're getting money with my idea and my work.<BR><BR> Note: The schematic found in the archive <A HREF="5_schematics.html">APPE_SQ.GIF</A> was made
using the AmiCAD program
