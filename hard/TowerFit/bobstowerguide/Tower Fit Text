How do you fit an A1200 into a Pc Tower Case ??

Mmmm, Well details is the problem here.
It's really, excuse the pun, a case of juggling things around till they fit :)
The biggest challenge is the Keyboard conversion, I've attached the file that
shows how to do that bit. It's not too bad a job, you just need a steady hand
& the nerve to have a go ;).
I'm using a CDTV K/B until I can get one from an A4000.

You will also find some pics of my case, hope they give you some ideas :)

As for fitting the motherboard into the case, it's a just question of
extending the leads to the drives etc.
 The case I used isn't really deep enough, the motherboard sticks out the back
a little way, but I can live with that, & I think they are all about the same
depth anyway. Maybe with a full sized tower the board could stand upright,
mine lays on it's front edge, with the sockets pointing upwards. (see my very
rough Grabs)

One of these days I'll get round to finishing the extension leads to all the
sockets, & mounting them on the rear of the case, I've only done the printer
one so far. (One day) :)
Oh, I've also extended the serial lead, that now lays on top of the case so 
it's easy to swap between modem & any other serial device.

Power comes from the Pc supply.
You will have to cut the power plug off of your Amiga power Pack, & connect 
it to the Pc supply, (See Diagram for connections). 

This will power all your drives, the motherboard, & even the monitor. I've 
also got a Zappo rom drive mounted in the case & this too is powered from the 
Pc unit.  My Supra Modem is fitted into one of the Drive bays, but I can't 
power it from the supply as it's 9 volts, Damn.
 
You might want to get hold of a scrapped 3.5 drive & fit it's front cover to
Df0, makes it look a bit tidier :)

I still want to fit another Floppy, & a Bigger hard drive, but funds are now
at an all time low :(

I've probably left out all the stuff you want to know, so get back to me if
you want any more info.
