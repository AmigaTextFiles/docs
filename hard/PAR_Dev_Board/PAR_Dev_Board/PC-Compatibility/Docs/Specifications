                            ---------------------

  1) Fully AMIGA Compatible ..............  Yes, for the A1000 an adaptor
                                            cable WILL be required.
  2) Fully PC, SPP Mode Comaptible .......  Yes.
  3) Fully PC, EPP, ECP Mode Compatible ..  Yes.
  4) Semi-Protected Lines ................  Optional, on ALL active lines,
                                            220 Ohm resistive protection.
  5) Other Protection ....................  The AMIGA +5 Volt supply coming
                                            from pin 14 of the parallel
                                            port, fused at 150mA.
                                            The Ground, GND, rail fused at
                                            1A.
  6) Internal Built-In Clock .............  Yes.
  7) Ability To Disable The Clock ........  Yes.
  8) Internal Clock Rate .................  4.5KHz to 5KHz, dependant on
                                            component tolerances.
  9) External Clock(s) ...................  Yes, two off at Line and Field
                                            frequencies, for example......
                                            PAL, Field frequency, 50Hz SLOW,
                                            and PAL, Line frequency, 15625Hz
                                            FAST, from the 23 pin video
                                            output socket for AMIGA usage.
 10) Ability To Use User Defined Clock ...  Yes, easily, up to at least
                                            100KHz, and possibly to 200+KHz.
 11) Independant Supply Rail(s) ..........  Yes, see below......
                                            An unregulated positive voltage.
                                            +4.7 Volt regulated.
                                            -1.6 Volt regulated.
                                            An unregulated negative voltage.
                                            All relative to Ground, GND.
 12) Battery Requirement .................  9 Volt, PP3 type. NOTE, this is
                                            NOT needed for general AMIGA
                                            use.
 13) Maximum Supply Current ..............  15mA, + or - 5mA, this WILL be
                                            enough for the whole of the
                                            PAR_Dev_Board project.
                                            NOTE:- It IS easily possible
                                            to increase this capability to
                                            55mA + or - 5mA but for this
                                            project it is NOT required.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
