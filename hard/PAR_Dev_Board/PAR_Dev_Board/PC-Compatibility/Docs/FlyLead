                      The Construction Of The Flylead.
                      --------------------------------

(Apologies for any typos, 30-06-2008. :)

(REFER TO THE PHOTOGRAPHS ~FLYLEAD.HAM~ OR ~FLYLEAD.JPG~ IN THE ~Drawings~
DRAWER.)

ALSO THE FOUR STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION OF THIS ITEM GO AS:-

(A) LEFT HAND SIDE ITEM IN THE PHOTO'.
(B) LEFT MIDDLE ITEM IN THE PHOTO'.
(C) RIGHT MIDDLE ITEM IN THE PHOTO'.
(D) RIGHT HAND SIDE ITEM IN THE PHOTO'.

Construction:-
--------------

  1) Cut a length of insulated, thin, grey wire about 200mm, (8 inches),
     long. (Note the demonstration pieces are RED but the main board
     has GREY wire, so stick with GREY.)
  2) Strip one end about 50-51mm, (2 inches), long; (A).
  3) Twist the 7 strands together; (A).
  4) Using Lead free solder ~tin~ along its length; (A).
  5) Using a short length of 22SWG, (standard wire guage), tinned copper
     wire as a winding support, wind the new twisted and tinned wire
     around this copper wire as a coil until all of it is used up except
     for a small tab, which is used for something else; (B).
  6) When it is fully wound, carefully remove the copper wire support; (C).
     (Keep this piece of copper wire and use it for the main board 
     construction.)
  7) DO NOT use any more solder at all, BUT, LIGHTLY solder the coil along
     its length to make it rigid; (C).
  8) Test to see that it slips nicely over one of the terminals on the
     board. If it does then go to Part 10).
  9) If it doesn't then try again, that is, go back to Part 1), practice
     makes perfect... :)
 10) Cut a length of small heat shrink sleeving, slip it over to the tab,
     leave the tab showing and using a hair drier shrink the sleeving to
     fit; (D).
 11) Finally re-check that it slips nicely over one of the terminals on the
     main board.
 12) If all is well you now have the ability to make a simple flylead... :)

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
