                    Construction Procedure For Part 3.
                    ----------------------------------

(Apologies for any typos, 01-07-2008. :)

Overview:-
----------

This part of the construction eliminates the need to rely on the AMIGAs
parallel port pin 14 for power. This addition makes the PAR_Dev_Board
totally independant of the AMIGA and makes it a universal add-on for most
computers that have a parallel port. There are two ~regulated~ rails and
two ~unregulated~ rails. The maximum current available is around 15mA
which is more than enough for the future projects that are to go onto
this board. It IS easily possible to increase the current rating to
50-60mA if so desired but it is not required for this project.

We can now give some sort of basic specification to the PAR_Dev_Board
that makes it appear more professional... :)

Enjoy...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT:-
----------------

Every endeavour has been made to ensure that the drawings and ~Construction~
and ~Test&Use~ files are all accurate.
YOU BUILD THIS HARDWARE AND USE IT ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. ANY ATTACHED
SOFTWARE IS ALSO USED AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE THE ~ReadMe-First~ FILE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(XXX == Image extension used for any pictures and drawings. IFF and HAM are
for ALL classic AMIGAs, GIF and JPG for machines able to display them.)

It is assumed that you have obtained the tools and components list in
the ~Parts_List~ file.
If you are an experienced constructor then this section can be skipped.

IMPORTANT:-
-----------

*** REFER TO ALL DRAWINGS AND PHOTOS' IN THE ~Drawings~ DRAWER! ***

(You might need to tin the individual parts before assembly but it is not
absolutely necessary.)

            Before ANY construction build the flylead first!!!
            --------------------------------------------------

  1) Check that you have the correct type of components against the
     ~Parts_List~. These do not have to be exactly the same but close
     enough to be able to build this project.
  2) On the print side of the stripboard cut all the necessary tracks using
     the 4mm drill bit. Refer to the photos' and drawings.
  3) Fit the short copper wire link. Note its position by counting the
     tracks and holes.
  4) Solder it into place and cut off the excess wire, 2 joints in all.
  5) Using five single ones, fit the link-pin blocks into their correct
     positions.
  6) Solder them into place, 5 joints in all.
  7) Fit the resistors, R5 and R6, into their correct positions.
  8) Solder them into place and cut off the excess wire, 4 joints in all.
  9) Fit the capacitor into its correct position.
 10) Solder it into place and cut off the excess wire, 2 joints in all.
 11) Fit the two wires from the battery connector into their correct
     positions, note the red and black orientation.
 12) Solder them into place, 2 joints in all.
 13) CAREFULLY fit the zener diode into place. Note which way round
     it goes, 2 joints in all.
 14) VERY CAREFULLY fit the red LED into place. Note where the flat part
     goes by looking at the drawings, 2 joints in all.
 15) Finally fit the home built flylead to the point shown in the drawings
     and photos'. My flylead goes through the hole and is soldered to the
     zener diode position on the underside of the board.
 16) Check your construction!
 17) I said CHECK your construction!
 18) Check it again, REMEMBER! any error will cause damage to your computer.
 19) DO A FINAL CHECK!!!

You are now ready to test this stage in the construction using the
~Test&Use~ file.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
