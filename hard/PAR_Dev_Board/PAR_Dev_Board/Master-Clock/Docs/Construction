                    Construction Procedure For Part 2.
                    ----------------------------------

(Apologies for any typos, 16-06-2008. :)

Overview:-
----------

This is the MASTER CLOCK and is a two transistor astable multivibrator,
(relaxation oscillator), that generates a 'Square Wave' with approximately
1 to 1 Mark to Space ratio. Depending on the component tolerances the
frequency of operation is around 4.5KHz to 5KHz. This is good enough for
most uses and certainly good enough for this project.

(You are lucky I decided NOT to use a Relay Relaxation Oscillator. :)

Enjoy...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT:-
----------------

Every endeavour has been made to ensure that the drawings and ~Construction~
and ~Test&Use~ files are all accurate.
YOU BUILD THIS HARDWARE AND USE IT ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. ANY ATTACHED
SOFTWARE IS ALSO USED AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE THE ~ReadMe-First~ FILE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(XXX == Image extension used for any pictures and drawings. IFF and HAM are
for ALL classic AMIGAs, GIF and JPG for machines able to display them.)

It is assumed that you have obtained the tools and components list in
the ~Parts_List~ file.
If you are an experienced constructor then this section can be skipped.

IMPORTANT:-
-----------

*** REFER TO ALL DRAWINGS AND PHOTOS' IN THE ~Drawings~ DRAWER! ***

(You might need to tin the individual parts before assembly but it is not
absolutely necessary.)

  1) Check that you have the correct type of components against the
     ~Parts_List~. These do not have to be exactly the same but close
     enough to be able to build this project.
  2) On the print side of the stripboard cut all the necessary tracks using
     the 4mm drill bit. Refer to the photos' and drawings.
  3) Fit the long and short copper wire links. Note their positions by
     counting the tracks and holes.
  4) Solder them into place and cut off the excess wire, 4 joints in all.
  5) Using four pairs and a single one, fit the link-pin blocks into their
     correct positions.
  6) Solder them into place, 9 joints in all.
  7) Fit the resistors, R1 and R2 first, then R3 and R4 into their correct
     positions.
  8) Solder them into place and cut off the excess wire, 8 joints in all.
  9) Fit the two capacitors into their correct positions.
 10) Solder them into place and cut off the excess wire, 4 joints in all.
     IF these capacitors are similar to the photo' and drawing then lay
     them flat, that way they will not get damaged easily.
 11) Fit the two, (white insulated), wire links into their correct
     positions.
 12) Solder them into place, 4 joints in all.
 13) CAREFULLY fit the two transistors into place. Note the way round
     that they go. This is for the BC548 and similar, IF you choose a
     different transistor then search for the specification for that
     transistor to obtain the correct pinouts.

     Pinouts As Viewed From The Underside Of The Transistor, (Wire Side):-
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                     |¯¯¯\ <-- The Circular Face.
                     | *1 \   1 == Emitter,   (e).
  The Flat Face. --> |   *2)  2 == Base,      (b).
                     | *3 /   3 == Collector, (c).
                     |___/

     Note that ~e~, ~b~, and ~c~ are marked on the drawings!
 14) CAREFULLY Solder them into place and cut off the excess wire, 6 joints
     in all.
 15) Fit the two coloured coded shorting links as per the photos' and
     drawings, black and red types.
 16) Check your construction!
 17) I said CHECK your construction!
 18) Check it again, REMEMBER! any error will cause damage to your computer.
 19) DO A FINAL CHECK!!!

You are now ready to test this stage in the construction using the
~Test&Use~ file.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
