                   Consruction Procedure For Part 1.
                   ---------------------------------

(Apologies for any typos, 16-05-2008. :)

Overview:-
----------

This is the start of the board proper. As it stands it will be an I/O
card only with limiting resistors on all active lines, including the
lines that will be used when in IBM PC 'compatibility' mode. The
jumpers are used to short out the resistors ONLY when any design you
make using this card in 'safe' mode works correctly. This experimental
card can then be 'discarded' and your project connected directly to
the parallel port.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Initial Construction:-
--------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT:-
----------------

Every endeavour has been made to ensure that the drawings and ~Construction~
and ~Test&Use~ files are all accurate.
YOU BUILD THIS HARDWARE AND USE IT ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. ANY ATTACHED
SOFTWARE IS ALSO USED AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE THE ~ReadMe-First~ FILE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(XXX == Image extension used for any pictures and drawings. IFF and HAM are
for ALL classic AMIGAs, GIF and JPG for machines able to display them.)

It is assumed that you have obtained the tools and components list in
the ~Parts_List~ file.
If you are an experienced constructor then this section can be skipped.

IMPORTANT:-
-----------

*** REFER TO ALL DRAWINGS AND PHOTOS' IN THE ~Drawings~ DRAWER! ***

  1) Check that you have the correct type of components against the
     ~Parts_List~. These do not have to be exactly the same but close
     enough to be able to build this project.
  2) On the print side of the stripboard cut all the necessary tracks using
     the 4mm drill bit.
  3) Using the battery drill AND the 1.2mm drill bit drill out any holes for
     components like the fuse holders to be fitted. The terminal block holes
     may need opening also. Be careful not to damage the print excessively.
  4) Assemble the terminal block pairs into two long blocks of 18.
  5) Push each set of terminal blocks into the stripboard.
     NOTE the position(s) of these block assemblies with reference to 
     the PDB_BTM1.XXX and PDB_TOP1.XXX drawings. Check against the photos'.
     Also NOTE that the opposite terminal block assembly to the other is
     offset by one copper strip!!!
  6) Once you are satisfied that you have the position correct solder each
     terminal leg, 36 joints in all.
  7) Now fit the resistors R1 to R17 inlcusive in an upright position with
     the body of each resistor to the each terminal input. See drawing
     PDB_TOP1.XXX and photograph DEV_BD1C.XXX. Note these are staggered
     so that the next part can be done.
  8) Solder all of these resistors into place and cut off any excess wire,
     34 joints in all.
  9) From the link-pin blocks, cut off pairs and fit, staggered, into the
     gaps between the resistors. These are links LK1 to LK17 inclusive.
     Again refer to the photos' and drawings.
 10) Solder these link-pins ito place, 34 joints in all.
 11) Fit the two fuseholders into place, note the GND, Ground line
     fuseholder is offset by 1 hole to the left.
 12) Solder these into place, 4 joints in all.
 13) Lastly fit the copper wire link behind the GND fuseholder. Note
     this connects the GND input line with the GND output line through
     the fuse directly.
 14) Solder into place, 2 joints in all.
 15) Fit the two fuses into the fuseholders.
 16) Fit all the coloured coded shorting links as per the photos' and
     drawings.
 17) Check your construction!
 18) I said CHECK your construction!
 19) Check it again, REMEMBER! any error will cause damage to your computer.
 20) Do a final check and put it to oneside so as to prepare the parallel
     cable assembly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cable Assembly Proper:-
---------------------------

The unit that I built used an old parallel printer cable hanging around at
work so I cut off the Centronics plug and stripped the cable back to reveal
the individual wires. This is the method I will describe.

VERY IMPORTANT:-
----------------

The colour coding of my cable will NOT be the same as yours so DO NOT use
these colours as a reference at all!!!

Cable Assembly:-
----------------

  1) Aquire a parallel printer cable and cut off the Centronics plug. Discard
     this Centronics plug as it is no longer needed.
  2) Strip the cable back about 4", 100mm, to reveal all the wires inside.
  3) Remove any foil screening and expose the bare copper screening wire.
  4) Place very small diameter heat shrink sleeving over this copper wire.
  5) Place medium sized heat shrink sleeving over the cable body. See the
     photos'.
  6) Using a hair drier heat shrink these two pieces of sleeving
     simultaneously. Do not over do it as damage to the cable will result.
  7) Terminate this copper screening wire with any type of insulated terminal
     of your choice.
  8) Using a Multimeter in Ohms(ish) range find which colours of the wires
     go to the pin numbers of the 25 way ~D~ type plug. For example......
     Green == Pin 1.
     Yellow == Pin 2.
     Black == Pin 3.
     ......and so on until you have logged them all.
  9) Check them again!!!
 10) Bring the board back into play.
 11) Now to connect up to the board proper. I used crimp pins for my
     construction but these are not required at all. They were only for MY
     convenience whilst I was doing all the developement work.
 12) For the coloured wires connected to Pins 18 to 25 inclusive, strip the
     ends and twist together and then connect to Terminal 18, GND, on the
     input, (Resistor/Shorting-Link), end of the board.
 13) For each individual wire, strip the end and connect the correct colour
     to the correct terminal number. For Example......
     Green == Terminal 1, (plug Pin 1).
     Yellow == Terminal 2, (plug Pin 2).
     Black == Terminal 3, (plug Pin 3).
     ......and so on until they are all connected.
 14) Finally you can OPTIONALY anchor the cable as in the photos'.
 15) Check your wiring!!!
 16) CHECK it again!!!
 17) Do a final check of everything just to be safe.

You are now ready to test and use the board as it stands.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
