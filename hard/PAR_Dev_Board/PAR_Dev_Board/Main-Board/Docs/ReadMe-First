    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
    PCMCIA memory expansions. All memory expansions were ~DISABLED~ using
    the NoFastMem program from the System drawer. Also tested on a 2MB
    A600, a 5MB A500+ and an old style A500 with a 0.5MB memory expansion
    at $C00000 and 4MB Fastram using the A500+ emulator and Workbench 2.04,
    and LBNL an A600 with 6MB emulating KS3.0x and running Workbench 3.0x.

    All test conditions were/are running STANDARD KS2.0x to 3.1x, and using
    standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.
