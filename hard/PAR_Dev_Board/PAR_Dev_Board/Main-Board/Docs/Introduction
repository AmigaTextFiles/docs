                               Introduction.
                               -------------

(Apologies for any typos, 12-05-2008. :)

Well I received NO Emails at all, good or bad, about the feeder/feeler
upload to AMINET of this project. However the AMINET downloads reached well
over 175 inside 11 days so I guess there are some out there interested in
what I do... :)

This is the first part for this project ~The Main Board~ with drawings
and preliminary test software to use this board in PAR: as a VOLUME mode.

As those of you who have downloaded my stuff before have found out, I write
code and build hardware for children to attempt. This gives children
experience in using simple electronic tools, soldering practice, simple
coding practice and basic building and testing techniques.

The ~Test-SW~ drawer contains two ~C~ sources:-

  1) PAR_Read_Single.c
  2) PAR_Write_single.c

These are compiled using Dice-C, AND, VBCC, both are on AMINET and free for
you to use.
The executables, (compiled using both compilers), are in this drawer too.

These will give single byte READ or WRITE to the parallel port and WILL need

             <http://main.aminet.net/docs/hard/PAR_READ.lha>

for them to work correctly. This archive is only needed for this stage
however and can be discarded for the next stage.

If you want further test software then here are some using PAR: as a VOLUME
that I have uploaded to AMINET over the years:-

PAR_ARexx.lha
PAR_Python.lha
PAR_C.lha
PAR_bwBASIC.lha

All of these are childishly simple.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often difficult problems.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
