(Apologies for any typos, 16-06-2008. :)

This project is a kids level Parallel Port Experimental Board.
It can be built on the kitchen table and only basic standard electronic
tools are required.

Phase three, the simple construction of the low power supply rails for
PC usage also.

It will be easily capable of working on an older PC with a Parallel Port
and there will be some code to use it eventually in this format using
MS-DOS (TM) and the interpreter QBASIC.EXE. For the time being however
it will be dedicated to the classic AMIGA range of computers.

Enjoy...

(The next part will be an extremely simple built-in PWM, (Pulse Width
Modulated), DAC, (Digital to Analogue Converter), PWM in and DC out;
along with a very basic Logic Probe to test the lines on your board... :)

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
    PCMCIA memory expansions. All memory expansions were ~DISABLED~ using
    the NoFastMem program from the System drawer. Also tested on two A600s
    with various memory configurations, a 1MB A500+ and an old style A500
    with a 0.5MB memory expansion at $C00000 using the A500+ emulator and
    Workbench 2.04, and LBNL an A600 emulating KS3.0x and running
    Workbench 3.0x.

    All test conditions were/are running STANDARD KS2.0x to 3.1x, and using
    standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before disconnecting or connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
