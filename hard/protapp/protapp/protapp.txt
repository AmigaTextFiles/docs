The purpose of this hack is to try to protect the parallel port.
This can be useful because CIA-chips can be expensive and hard
to replace(surface mount). Diodes, fuses etc. are used.
This the second revision, and minor changes were made. (pads bigger etc.)
The schematic is in protapp.iff. Parts placement in placement.iff
Printed circuit board layout is in ppcb.ps (Postscript format).
Note: I haven't tested the pcb. The prototype had no varistor.
After building the board it should be put into a plastic enclosure to
avoid short circuits. NOTE: If small fuses with wire ends are not
available, replace them with 56 or 68 Ohm resistors.
Use 1N4448 or 1N4148 or suitable schottky diodes, which are more expensive.
(Some schottkies have large leakage currents, do not use those types.)

If it is hard to reach the parallel port, an extender cable can be built.
It is possible to use D-25 connectors that are attached to flat ribbon
cable.(shielded type is preferable.) The cable should be short (2-3 feet).
