                The Multi-Mode Data Logger/Transient Recorder.
                ----------------------------------------------

                                    General.
                                    --------

                Some General Information About The Data Logger.
                -----------------------------------------------

   These are some notes about Data Logger that do not fit any where else.
   All ASSUME that you are in the ~Ready, <some text>~ mode and IF not then
   just LMB click on the ~Stop.~ button to set it to that mode.
   (Note, LMB = Left Mouse button.)
   (Note, RMB = Right Mouse Button, for menu modes.)
   (Note, KB = Keyboard.)
   (Note, HW = HardWare.)

   1) ~System. -> Quit. (Q)~ menu, ~Quit.~ button and ~Q~ or ~q~ KB.
      Read the ~Manual~ for exiting the Data Logger. All these methods
      are WinUAE compatible.
   2) ~System. -> Reboot.~. This is WinUAE compatible from the menu and
      read the ~Manual~ for more information.
      The KB shortcut ~Alt-Shift-Q~ is hidden and could cause some WinUAE
      installations to fail so BE AWARE OF THIS!!!...

   3) ~System. -> No Reset./Reset All.~ menu, these are two important
      commands that are switched according to whether HW is in use OR if
      running in DEMO mode without HW attached.
      A) DEMO mode. When running in DEMO mode NO HW has been detected so
         therefore this menu command shows as a shaded out command
         ~System -> No Reset.~. It does NOTHING at all as it cannot be
         accessed under normal circumstances EXCEPT KB override IS present
         even in DEMO mode. Read the ~Manual~ for more information.

         DO NOT USE WITHOUT ANY HW CONNECTED AS INSTABILITY MAY RESULT
         IN WinUAE COMPATIBILITY MODE. NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A BUG BUT
         DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN EMULATION UNDER Windows ??(TM).

         Genuine classic AMIGAs are unaffected by this however.

      B) Full HW connected and detected mode. VERY IMPORTANT!!!...
         A major ASSUMPTION is made here, that the HW is still attached, as
         everyone should know, NOT to remove any HW from the AMIGA whilst it
         is powered up. Therefore I had to program this facility with this
         situation in mind.

         This is for both versions of HW detection. When any HW has been
         detected, (read the ~Manual~ for more information), the
         ~System. -> Reset All.~ command now exists, and is available for
         both genuine classic AMIGAs and WinUAE.

         Once selected:-
           1) EVERYTHING is cleared from memory.
           2) The MAIN Window is completely cleared also.
           3) The port(s) and external HW are checked.
           4) The program restarts WITHOUT the HW detection window being
              used.
           5) The MAIN Window is set up again as in a cold start.

   4) ~System. -> Help. (?)~, ~System. -> About.~ or ~System. -> Manual. (!)~
      menu commands, RMB on any of these display various help and information
      files for your convenience. The KB equivalents, ~?~ and ~!~ work
      identcally and ~About.~ also has a hidden KB equivalent ~@~ which IS
      WinUAE friendly.

      The only thing to note is, that the ~Manual. (!)~ requires More to read
      it and MUST be in the path OR the default SYS:System drawer. If More
      does NOT exist then the Data Logger program will ignore the command.
      ~Manual.~ MUST be in the same drawer as Data-Logger for it to be found.
