  1) Foreword:-
  -------------

  This project is a single channel Data Logger/Transient Recorder.
  The object was to compliment my ~TestGear?~ projects in the ~hard/hack~
  drawer of AMINET:-

                    http://main.aminet.net/hard/hack/

  It can be used for all types of logging and in fast mode, on genuine
  AMIGAs, also used like a chart recorder. It is designed to use existing
  projects that have already been built and uploaded to AMINET:-

  A) Project6 of TestGear2.lha an A-D Converter for the Parallel Port.
     This is for genuine AMIGAs ONLY.
  B) WinUAE-ADC.lha an A-D Converter for the Games Port of BOTH the PC
     running WinUAE OR genuine AMIGAs.
  C) A Demo' mode for all AMIGAs and WinUAE using OS2.0x to OS3.1x, also
     tested to OS3.9x and works but NOT guaranteed. This does NOT require
     the hardware to be fitted to give the software a full workout. It
     might work on OS1.3x OK but has NOT been tested.

  A very useful site for AMIGA hardware related information is:-

                        http://amiga.serveftp.net/

                           (C) Anthony Hoffman.

  Anthony has been a close partner with me now for quite some time and
  without him some of these projects would not have seen the light of day.
  He risks his AMIGAs with potential crashes often so many thanks to you
  matey...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  4) Requirements:-
  -----------------

  A) Absolute Minimum.
  --------------------

  1) Standard old style A500, with 0.5MB memory at $C00000, clock optional.
  2) KS2.0x and Workbench 2.0x.
  3) Television display.
  4) 640x200 resolution in 16, (Workbench), colours.
  5) OCS.
  6) Extra Floppy drive or optional HDD.

  B) Developed On.
  ----------------

  1) Stock A1200 with 4MB FastRam, NoFastMem used to ~disable~ Fast Memory.
  2) KS3.0x and Workbench 3.0x.
  3) PAL style monitor.
  4) 4GB HDD, 5.25" DD Floppy and 3.5" HD 1.76MB Floppy drive.
  5) QDrive, (PCMCIA), CDROM drive.
  6) ACE Basic Compiler, (C)David Benn.
  7) HiSoft DevPac3 Assembler for subtle requirements.

  C) Tested On.
  -------------

  An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
  PCMCIA memory expansions. All memory expansions were ~DISABLED~ using
  the NoFastMem program from the System drawer. Also tested on a 2MB
  A600, a 5MB A500+ and an old style A500 with a 0.5MB memory expansion
  at $C00000 and 4MB Fastram using the A500+ emulator and Workbench 2.04,
  and an A600 with 6MB emulating KS3.0x and running Workbench 3.0x.
  Also tested on an A4000 with various upgrades and OS3.9x.

  LBNL, tested on AF5/6 and WinUAE on Windows ME(TM) and XP(TM) using
  OS3.1x, note that this version is STILL under major developement.

  All test conditions were/are running STANDARD KS2.0x to 3.9x, and using
  standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

  I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
  to the ~Legal Notes.~ above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  5) Installation:-
  -----------------

  This is SO easy, just un-archive the ~lha~ archive anywhere on your AMIGA
  and drag the un-archived drawer to any drive and/or drawer of YOUR choice.

  There are NO special ASSIGNs or PATHs to take into consideration. Also
  NO special libraries or files are required for it to run.

  A FULL standard OS install IS required as ~More~and ~RexxMast~ are used.

  (You can, IF YOU CHOOSE TO, add an ASSIGN of anything you like to make
  for easy access to the working drawer when used in CLI/Shell mode. This
  is purely optional. That's all there is to it! :)

============================================================================

  6A) Program Startup:-
  ---------------------

  Switch OFF the AMIGA and disconnect ANYTHING connected to the Games Port
  AND Parallel Port. Connect the Games Port ADC to the Games Port OR the
  Parallel Port ADC to the Parallel Port.

  The Games Port ADC is WinUAE-ADC.lha in the hard/hack drawer of AMINET.

  The Parallel Port ADC is Project6 of TestGear2.lha in the hard/hack
  drawer of AMINET.

  (ENSURE NOTHING, OR, ONLY THE SPECIAL HOME BUILT HW IS CONNECTED TO THE
  GAMES PORT AND/OR PARALLEL PORT. READ THE ~Warning~ FILE!!!.)

  Connect the Data-Logger Hardware to one of the ADCs, whichever is in use.

  IF NO HW IS CONNECTED AT ALL THEN THE SW WILL DEFAULT TO DEMO MODE.

  Boot up the AMIGA/WinUAE to Workbench and go to where the ~DL~ drawer
  is situated.

  Start the Data-Logger SW from the icon provided, DO NOT USE ~DL~ at this
  point this will be explained much later.

  The program starts by opening a small window called:-
  Hardware Detection Window, (C)G0LCU.

  Once this window is opened a line is displayed:-
  Detecting hardware, please wait...

  Then, one of four actions takes place:-

  1) Games Port HW found and Parallel Port HW NOT found, will result in
     the SW running in WinUAE compatibility mode, (Data-Logger only).
  2) Games Port HW NOT found and Parallel Port HW found, will result in
     the SW running in classic AMIGA mode.
  3) Games Port HW NOT found and Parallel Port HW NOT found, will result
     in the SW running in DEMO mode for ALL AMIGAs.
  4) Games Port HW found and Parallel Port HW found, will result in the
     SW exiting with an error report telling you it is NOT possible to
     run both sets of HW, preventing any conflict in the system.

  This Window then closes down completely and IF 1), 2) or 3) is valid
  then the Main Data-Logger window opens up with the MODE displayed in
  its title bar.

  This window is drawn with some actions taking place until the SCANNING
  window displays some variables in it.
  These will be explained later and ARE:-

        Summary of the set up parameters for the Data Logger.
        -----------------------------------------------------

          Graticule set to OFF.
          Sacn rate set to fastest possible speed.
          Scan mode set to single shot.
          Trigger mode set to OFF.
          Trigger point set to  0.
          Autosave set to OFF.
         <WinUAE ADC error correction set to  10.>

       <A description of the mode being used in here.>

      <The version displayed as $VER: whatever it is at the time.>

  NOTE, the <WinUAE ADC error correction set to  10.> will ONLY be displayed
  if the Games Port ADC is connected AND has been detected.

  The Data Logger is now set up and ready for use.

  ANY SHADED OUT MENU-ITEMS OR BUTTONS ARE PURELY DEPENDANT ON WHAT HW IS
  CONNECTED. THESE ARE HW SPECIFIC SO DEMO VERSIONS ARE PUT IN FOR USER
  FAMILIARITY. SOME SHADED OUT MENUS ARE NOT FINISHED YET AND WILL EXIST
  IN ALL MODES, NOT JUST DEMO MODE.

  ANY BEEPs heard are NOT errors and are used as simple ~delay lines~ ONLY.

  6B) And Quitting:-
  ------------------

  There are several ways of Quit(ing) the program:-

  1) ~Q~ or ~q~ from the KB, from almost anywhere and anytime within the
     program.  
  2) The ~Quit.~ button, again AT anyhwere AND anytime.
  3) The ~System. -> Quit.~ menu at ALMOST anytime but NOT anywhere.

  OR REBOOTING:-

  1) From the ~System. -> Reboot.~, only when the scan has stopped AND
     NOT in ~Standby~ mode. You will be prompted with a Y/N in the
     STATUS LINE.
  2) See Appendix A) for KB usage, WARNING use at your own risk!!!

============================================================================

  7) Basic Operation:-
  --------------------

  A) Summary.
  -----------

              OBSERVE EVERYTHING IN THE STATUS LINE/WINDOW!!!
              -----------------------------------------------

  The basic operation consists of the 10 buttons ONLY, (YES, there are 10,
  the STATUS LINE does exactly the same as the ~Stop.~ button :), and any
  part of the button enclosed in (?) is the keyboard equivalent. Single
  LMB clicking is all that is required.

  The buttons in their proper order in the program:-

  (S)tart.   Starts a scan, has ~S~ and ~s~ KB equivalent also.
  Stop.      Stops a scan, "Space Bar~ KB equivalent also, OR RMB, OR LMB,
             <STATUS LINE> does the same also and see Appendix A).
* (F)ast.    Fastest scan speed, ~F~ or ~f~ KB equivalent also.
* 0(.)1S.    0.1 Seconds/Horizontal Pixel, ~.~ KB equivalent also.
* (1)S.      1 Second/Horizontal Pixel, ~1~ KB equivalent also.
* 1(0)S.     10 Seconds/Horizontal Pixel, ~0~ KB equivalent also.
  Save.      Saves stored data to disk in #?.CSV format. See Appendix A).
  Cont.      Continue from last plot. See Appendix A).
  (Q)uit.    Quits WITHOUT ANY PROMPTS AT ALL.

  Note ~*~ above means that the button highlights the text inside it to
  show what scanning rate you are using at any one time. These buttons
  WILL also re-display the summary screen shown at program startup to show
  your present parameters.

  Left clicking on the ~Stop.~ button OR the <STATUS LINE> WILL emit a BEEP.
  THIS IS NOT AN ERROR.

  B) A Full Description Of Each Button:-
  --------------------------------------

  1) (S)tart.
     This starts ALL scanning. It plots POINTS only and does NOT join them
     at this stage of the scanning process. EVERY point is stored in memory
     and IS available to the user for manipulation by various means. A NEW
     RE-SCAN, CLEARS AND RE-WRITES over the memory location(s) of the
     previous scan. UNTIL a RE-SCAN occurs then the present scan can be
     analysed, saved, (printed), etc... ad-infinitum. The scanning window
     shows 1, 0 and 1 on the left hand side and +, < and - on the right hand
     side. IF ALL of the required HW is attached then this corresponds to
     + or - 1 Volt about a centre 0, ~<~. Each vertical pixel corresponds
     to 20mV and for AMATUER use should be more than good enough. The two
     Coloured, (Black?), Lines represent the + or - 1 Volt calibrated limits
     and will ALWAYS be displayed during a scanning process. (The graticule
     is optional.)
  2) Stop.
     There are many ways of stopping the scan. Appendix A) shows another
     method but BEWARE when using this key under WinUAE as strange errors
     can result. This is a function of Windows NOT WinUAE, hence the ~Esc~
     key is in the Appendix A) list.
     A) A ~Single Shot~ scan WILL stop at the end of a FULL scan and does
        NOT require user intervention. For USER INTERVENTION see below.
     B) RMB, just pressing the RMB, ANYWHERE on the monitor screen will
        stop a scan at any time during that scan. The POINTS that are
        already plotted WILL be stored into memory as before. At the same
        time the MENU bar will be highlighted for you to access in the
        normal way. THIS IS THE PREFERED WAY TO STOP A SCAN.
     C) ~Space Bar~, hold this down for about 1+ seconds and the scan will
        stop. It is almost immediate for scan rates of 0.1 S/Pixel and
        Fast but 1 and 10 S/Pixel require about 1 second to respond. This
        will be the normal way to stop ANY scan as it is quick and easy.
        Again ANY POINTS that are already plotted WILL be stored into
        memory. This method does NOT work in ~(F)ast.~ DEMO mode.
     D) LMB, THIS IS NOT THE PREFERED WAY. This stops the scan and places
        it into ~Standby Mode~ awaiting a command from ANY Button ONLY.
        The KB and MENU are suspended until ANY Button is left clicked and
        acted upon. IF you are UNSURE then just left click the ~Stop.~
        button and all will be set back to normal mode. During ANY scan
        a LMB click ANYWHERE on the monitor screen WILL stop the scan, just
        like the RMB method. Again ANY POINTS that are already plotted WILL
        be stored into memory.
  3) (F)ast. 0(.)1S. (1)S. and 1(0)S.
     These are the Pixel plotting times. When ANY one of these buttons is
     changed AT ALL, by KB, MENU OR BUTTON then the active button will be
     highlighted in a different colour to show it is active. The default
     is ~(F)ast.~ on program startup and on an A1200 with 4MB of FastRam
     this is faster than 100 Pixels/Second, more than adequate for AMATEUR
     use. In Games Port ADC WinUAE compatibility mode the 0(.)1S. button
     is shaded out and NOT accessible.
  4) Save.
     When ANY scan has stopped this button saves the plotted points ONLY
     in DD-MM-YYYY_HHMMSS.CSV format ONLY, you cannot specify a filename
     of your own during program run. It will save ALL 512 memory locations
     in easily readable ASCII format and ANY memory loacations NOT plotted
     into will give an ASCII character ~0~. You CAN rename this/these
     file(s) after the program is quitted if you like for importing to the
     likes of Excel(TM).
  5) Cont.
     This button purely continues from where you left off of a previous
     scan. It does NOT clear OR re-write any stored previous POINTS BUT
     redraws them and carries on from the last POINT plotted.
  6) Quit.
     See the ~And Quitting:-~ section of Chapter 6B).

============================================================================

  8) Keyboard operation:-
  -----------------------

  The keyboard can access nearly ALL of the MENU commands including the
  the use of combination keys shown in Appendix A). Some are shown here
  but special ones are left in Appendix A). These are not considered
  totally stable in some WinUAE installations that is why they are in
  Appendix A). WARNING ANY KEY COMBINATION IN ~Appendix A)~ IS USED AT
  YOUR ONW RISK, SO TAKE EXTREME CARE.
