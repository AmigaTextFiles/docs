                The Multi-Mode Data Logger/Transient Recorder.
                ----------------------------------------------

                                    Save.
                                    -----

                    Saving Data To Disk As A ~#?.CSV~ File.
                    ---------------------------------------

   There are two basic ways of saving data to the user defined OR default S:
   volume. All saved data will be in the format DD-MM-YYYY_HHMMSS.CSV and
   CANNOT be altered during program run. The file(s) CAN however be renamed
   after the program has been exited and when the Data-Logger is re-run CAN
   be reviewed with the new name IF required.

   It assumes that the AMIGA of which Data-Logger is run on has an internal
   RTC to gather the correct Date and Time for the filename. If NO RTC is
   present then you MUST manually set the Date and Time on each RE-BOOT of
   the AMIGA.
   (Note, RTC = Real Time Clock.)
   (Note, LMB = Left Mouse Button.)
   (Note, KB = Keyboard.)
   (Note, RMB = Right Mouse Button.)

   Method A), MANUALLY, this method has three modes of access:-
   ------------------------------------------------------------

      1) ~Save.~ button. This method is ALWAYS available; ASSUME that the
         Data-Logger is scanning and grabbing data from the parallel port.

         On LMB clicking the ~Save.~ button, the scan will STOP and the
         number of plots will be displayed in between the scanning window and
         the status line. The values in memory will be saved to a file in the
         current VOLUME name selected, the default being the S: VOLUME.

         ALL 512 memory locations will be saved but the memory locations
         without any plotted data inside will be given an ASCII character of
         0, zero.

         All values are in standard ASCII format and a binary value 01101010
         in memory will be saved as three ASCII characters "106" without the
         quotes.

         If the scan is already in stopped mode then LMB clicking the ~Save.~
         button will do exactly the same as above.

         The status line will display the saving of any file and give its
         present filename, for example a file named ~15-03-2006_113457.CSV~
         will be in plain ASCII text that was saved on 15th March 2006 at
         11:34:57 and set to Comma Separated Variables for import to the
         likes of Excel(TM). With this method there is NO possibility of
         overwriting any previous file, BUT will soon fill up a floppy disk
         if used continuously, SO BE WELL AWARE OF THIS!!!...

      2) ~System. -> Save Data.~ menu. The same ASSUMPTIONS as before.
         This method is NOT always available. IF the status line displays
         "STANDBY, click on ~Stop.~ to CLEAR. ONLY the buttons will work."
         without the quotes then you ONLY have the ~Save.~ button mode
         available. This is because you CAN stop the scanning from ANY part
         of the monitor screen NOT just the Data-Logger window so until the
         Data-Logger displays in the status line "Ready, <some text>" without
         the quotes again then menu and keyboard usage is inoperative.

         To make life easy, IF you use the PREFERED method of stopping ANY
         scan, the RMB, (YES the RMB), then you can use the menu method to
         save a file as normal immediately.

         Similar events occur as in A), 1) above for the saving of the file.

      3) ~Alt S~ keyboard event. This has the same effect as the menu, item
         2), above. This should be used VERY carefully as conflicts CAN occur
         when using some installations of WinUAE. For this reason it is a
         hidden KB shortcut and works faultlessly on genuine classic AMIGAs.
         (Under the vast majority of cases it should work OK on WinUAE BUT
         BE WELL AWARE OF THIS ANOMALY.)

   Method B), AUTOMATICALLY, this method has two modes of access:-
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   This method of saving plotted data is accessed from the KB and menu ONLY.
   The scan MUST be in the stopped state and LMB click on the ~Stop.~ button
   to place the Data-Logger in the "Ready, <some text>" mode as displayed in
   the status line. There is NOT a button available to set autosave to ON.

     1) ~Setup. -> Autosave. (A)~ menu. From the ~Setup.~ menu select the
        ~Autosave. (A)~ command and the scanning window will show the NEW
        current setup parameters. Now select your other setup requirements
        for this scanning session, for example, continuous scanning mode,
        ~Setup. -> Scan Mode.(H)~ and the scanning window will show the
        NEW current setup yet again.

        ASSUME NOW THAT CONTINUOUS SCANNING MODE IS IN USE.

        Once scanning AND plotting has begun and the autosave facility is
        enabled, a file WILL be saved at then END of each 512 plots in the
        format shown above. This will continue ad-infinitum UNTIL the scan
        stops. As soon as the scan stops autosave WILL BE DISABLED again
        and you MUST manually reset to autosave ON again as described above.
        This is for safety reasons so that you do NOT eat up disk space
        in error, as it forces you to make the decision to set automatic
        saving mode.

     2) ~A or a~ keyboard event. As in B), 1) above the ~A~ or ~a~ key will
        do EXACTLY the same as the menu method.
        This is fully WinUAE compatible and NO conflicts occur.
