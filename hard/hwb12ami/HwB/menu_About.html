<p>What about this? Your free reference guide to electronics.</p>

<p>The Hardware Book is a compilation of pinouts I've found from
different sources. I've tried to have the same style for all
pages. This makes it easier to find information for you. I'm not
trying to sell anything.</p>

<p>It has been developed on my sparetime and is made availble to
you for free. This also means that I can't guarantee that the
presented information is correct. Use it on you own risk. I can't
take the whole credit for HwB. I have since the first release
received a great lot of mails with suggestions, questions and
information. With the help of many contributors HwB has grown.
Keep sending me mails...</p>

<p>This is me, Joakim Ögren:<br>

<p>Could it be even better? Perhaps if You help me. Please send
any material you have that might be of interrest for this
project. Send it to <a href="mailto:qtech@mailhost.net">qtech@mailhost.net</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'm looking for a sponsor, if you're interrested
please let me know and I'll tell you more.</strong></p>

<p>All new information since the last update is marked <img
src="images/new.GIF" alt="NEW" width="31" height="12"> and
updated or changed information is marked <img
src="images/updated.GIF" alt="UPDATED" width="52" height="12">.</p>
