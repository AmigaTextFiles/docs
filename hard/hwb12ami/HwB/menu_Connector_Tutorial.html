<h1>Short tutorial</h1>

<h2>Heading</h2>

<p>First at each page there a short heading describing what the
connector is.</p>

<h2>Pictures of the connectors</h2>

<p>After that there is at each page there is one or more pictures
of the connectors. Sometimes there is some question marks only.
This means that I don't know what kind of connector it is or how
it looks.</p>

<p>There may be some pictures I haven't drawn yet. I illustrate
this with the following advanced picture:</p>

<p><img src="images/notdrawn.GIF" align="bottom" width="84"
height="65" alt="NOT DRAWN YET"> (At the computer)</p>

<p>Normally are one or more pictures. <strong>These are seen from
the front, and NOT the soldside.</strong> <strong>Holes (female
connectors usually) are darkened.</strong> Look at the example
below. The first is a female connector and the send a male. The
texts insde parentheses will tell you at which kind of the device
it will look like that.</p>

<h2>Texts describing the connectors</h2>

<p>Below the pictures there is texts that describes the
connectors. Including the name of the physical connector.</p>

<p>5 PIN DIN 180° (DIN41524) at the computer.</p>

<h2>Pin table</h2>

<p>The pin table is perhaps the information you're looking for.
Should be simple to read. Contains mostly the following three
columns; Pin, Name &amp; Description.</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Pin</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>CLOCK</td>
        <td>Key Clock</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>GND</td>
        <td>GND</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>DATA</td>
        <td>Key Data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>VCC</td>
        <td>+5 VDC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>n/c</td>
        <td>Not connected</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Contributor &amp; Source</h2>

<p>All persons that helped me or sent me information about the
connector will be listed here. The source of the information is
perhaps a book or another site. I must admit that I'm bad at
writing the source, but I'll try to fill in these in the future.</p>
