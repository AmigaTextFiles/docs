Construction details.

  This is basically a list of what connects to what. Use this in conjunction
with the IFFs to help you construct your circuit.

  In the diagrams, the pin with the 1 next to it is (guess!) pin 1.

  First, connect the system earth (pin 7) to pins 3 and 5 on all 3 chips.

  Next, connect the +12V supply (pin 9) to pin 8 on all 3 chips.

  Connect the -12V supply (pin 10) to pin 4 on all 3 chips.

  On the first chip, connect pin 2 to pin 2 on the computer, and pin 1 to pin 3
on the cable connector. Connect pin 7 to pin 5 on the computer, and pin 6 to pin
4 on the cable connector.

  On the second chip, connect pin 2 to pin 2 on the cable connector, and pin 1
to pin 3 on the computer. Connect pin 7 to pin 6 on the cable connector, and pin
6 to pin 20 on the computer.

  On the third chip, connect pin 2 to pin 4 on the computer, and pin 1 to pin 5
on the cable connector. Connect pin 7 to pin 6 on the computer, and pin 6 to pin
20 on the cable connector.

  Pins 1 and 7 should be connected to both connectors, but should not be
connected together.
