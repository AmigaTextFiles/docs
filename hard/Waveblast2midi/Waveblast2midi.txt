Introduction
------------

After about a month of experimenting I have finally got the DB50XG
board working with a standard midi input. After reading the
Waveblaster hack by Christian Buchner I went and bought the card.
I noticed that the Reset circuit description was a bit sketchy and
he didn't provide the information on how to convert the DB50XG's
midi input to a standard midi input and so I created this document
and graphic to clearly show this. I also found that converting from
standard midi to the DB50XG midi easier than converting the Amigas
signal.


Requirements
------------

All you need is a midi interface, one 220 ohm resistor and a
1N4148 diode and a 5 pin din socket.

Refer to the included iff graphic for instructions.


Disclaimer

Although this circuit works, I do not guarantee it is safe, correct or
if it will work for you. If you do this hack then you are responsible
for the outcome, good or bad.
