What is this ?
----------------

this hack describes the modification of the A4000 to give you
an extra Z3-slot. This hack is of no use if you allready own an
A4000T.

Be WARNED !!
----------------
This hack requires some skill in soldering and computers in general.
If you`re not familiar with these items, you better don`t use this
hack.


Basics
------

The A4000 has only 4 Z3/Z2 slots. This is somehow nasty, if you
just got a VLAB and your machine is allready stock with 4 other
cards.
When looking into the schematics of the A4000, you can see that
the slots are controled by the superbuster-chip. The superbuster
has 5 sets of lines to control slots, but only 4 sets are used
in the A4000. All we have to do, is to wire the fifth set of lines
to our new slot.


Starting off
-------------

You need to get a connector (100Pins) which should look like the
common connectors you allready use on your A4000.

Now you wire all lines from one of your 4 slots to your connector.
(except: pins 9,60,64,91)

test: put a Z2/3 card into your old slots and test them.
      (The machine must work as before.)


The most difficult task:
Remove your motherboard, so that you can see the lowerside of the
board. There are SMD-resistors called R635 and R622.(These are pullups.)
Take a multimeter and find out, what ends of 635 and 622 are connected.
Now solder a wire to the not-connected end of 635 and one more wire
to the not-connected end of 622. Make the wires long enough as we need
them at our slot.

The most most most difficult task:

Locate the superbuster, it`s beside the simm-sockets. Remove the chip
from the socket. Now locate pin 69. (pin 1 is in the middle on one side,
count against clock`s rotation.) Now cut the little plastic-stick,
which is between pin69 and the right upper edge of the socket.
(This is the way our wire runs out of the socket.)
Now solder a wire to pin 69 and plug the chip back into the socket.

... hold on, now things are getting much easier. =)

Connect the 635-line to pin 9 (of our new connector), and the
622-line to pin 60 and the superbuster-line to pin64.

test: I`d recommend to test the old 4 slots, just to make sure,
      we didn`t make a mistake.


Autoconfig
-----------
To make our 5th slot take part in the big autoconfig-process, we need
to connect config.out of slot 4 to config.in of slot 5.
Config.out is on pin 11 and config.in is on pin12.



We went through hell, but we made it !!
---------------------------------------

Plug a 5th card into our new slot, and also a card in the slot, we got
our config.out-line from. As the new slot get`s it config-signal from
the other card, it will not work, if you`d forget to plug a card into
the other slot.

.. what can I say .. the slot should work as the other`s did before.


NOTE:
-----

pin 91, which we don`t use on our new slot, sets some limitations
on the new slot. This line is used for sensing the Z3 cards, thus
slot 5 will allways behave like the card in the card in the slot
with our config.out supply.
Don`t mix Z2/3 cards on these 2 slots, better use only Z2, as this
no problem on my system.

.... or better buy a PC ?
--------------------------

Depends on your brain.

If you`re happy with installing the same system over and over, without
any advance .....
If you like to spend days to get things working, the Amiga does by a
simple mouseclick .....
If you want to run a OS, which is written that lame, just like your
sister would write it ....

                           ... than buy a PC.

If you think, things should be as easy as the could be ....
If your brain is overloaded, when multitasking appears ....
If you enjoy systems that are pretty expensive .....

                           ... than buy a Mac.

If you`re a real GURU and you want to feel the power of real,smooth
multitasking ....
If you want to go beyond the limits, Billy Gates wants a user to go...
If you want to be the king of a system which is the king of all systems..

                           ... than buy a Amiga and f*ck the rest.
