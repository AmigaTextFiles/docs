Amiga Video Digitizer
---------------------
The IFF picture included contains the schematics for a DigiView hardware
clone.  I am uncertain of the origin, or whether it even works so use it
at your own risk.  I hold no responsibility for the results of this project,
nor do I assume any responsibility for the lack of credit for the schematic.
If you need another copy of the .pic file, I can be reached via email at:

Good luck...
