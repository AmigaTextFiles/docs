                      ------------------------------------


    Minimum Operating Requirements Are:-
    ------------------------------------

    1) Standard Amiga A500 with 512Kb or more of memory.
    2) Workbench 1.3x.
    3) An external floppy disk drive is required.
    4) OCS.
    5) The mouse is optional.
    6) The software has NOT been tested on an Amiga A1000.
    7) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 1.2x or less.
    8) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 3.1x or greater.

    General Information:-
    ---------------------

    This is a simple square wave generator which is used to inject a signal
    into any active part of a wireless/radio. It will produce a tone out of
    the speaker, from the Audio amplifier, down to the RF amplifier, if all
    is well. If not, then it will find the faulty stage of the radio set.

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler.

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations.
