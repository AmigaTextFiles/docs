  Keyboard Controls:-
  -------------------

  The keyboard controls are shown in brackets, for example (q), (Q).
  IF the letter is a capital, then press one of the ~SHIFT~ keys whilst
  pressing the required letter.

  (i) This will increase the frequency at the rate of 50Hz per stop.
  (I) This will increase the frequency at the rate of 1Hz per stop.
  (d) This will decrease the frequency at the rate of 50Hz per stop.
  (D) This will decrease the frequency at the rate of 1Hz per stop.
  (o) This will increase the output voltage.
  (O) This will decrease the output voltage.
  (s) This will switch the mode to SINE.
  (S) This will switch the mode to SQUARE.
  (q) or (Q) will exit the program.

  The mouse can be used to Quit or move to the background. This is not
  needed for correct operation of the software and can be disconnected
  if running the software from a CLI or SHELL window.

  Limitations Of The Computer:-
  -----------------------------

  The specifications of this generator are poor compared to a professional
  piece of test gear, this is due to the AMIGA's hardware. However I have
  worked around these limitations to a great extent to get the most out of
  the audio hardware. The two main limitations to consider are ALIASING and
  audio amplifier BANDWIDTH. Although it was possible to generate a low
  level SINE wave to approximately 10KHz it was suffering badly with these
  two constraints. The audio amplifier's BANDWIDTH is approximately 7KHz.

  ALIASING is the effect of sum and difference frequencies generated by the
  hardware between the sampled waveform and sampling frequency. To reduce
  this problem the sampled waveform must be sampled at more than twice the
  frequency of the waveform itself plus 7KHz for the AMIGA's audio bandwidth.

  For Example:-
  -------------

  Sampled frequency = 1Khz.
  Sampling frequency = 7Khz.
  Sum of the two frequencies = 7+1 = 8KHz.
  Difference of the two frequencies = 7-1 = 6KHz.

  The 8Khz frequency is outside of the audio amplifier's bandwidth and so
  will not be passed through.
  However the 6Khz frequency will pass through as it is inside the audio
  amplifier's bandwidth.
  So to eliminate both we must add 7KHz to the sampling frequency, which
  means that the new sampling rate to produce a ~CLEAN~ waveform would be
  7+7 = 14KHz. Now both the sum and the difference frequencies are out of
  the audio bandwidth.

  BANDWIDTH is the highest frequency that can be passed by the amplifier.
  Thus the effect of the filtering required to try to reduce the ALIASING
  errors effectively reduces the output of the higher frequencies.
  Once lost these high frequency components cannot be retreived.

  Because this program was written with both NTSC and PAL systems in mind
  the frequency generated is a compromise between both. So therefore the
  accuracy is not quite as good as it could be. However this should not be
  a problem.

                       Construction Of The Test Lead.
                       ------------------------------

  Parts Required:-
  ----------------

  1) A length of coaxial cable approximately 1.5 metres, RG58 or UR76.
  2) A PHONO or RCA plug.
  3) A countersunk head brass screw approximately 1.5" (37mm) long.
  4) A matching nut.
  5) An insulated crocodile clip.
  6) A length of sleeving, (the sleeving off of the coaxial cable will do).
  7) An old ballpoint pen case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Tools Required:-
  ----------------

  1) Soldering iron.
  2) Solder.
  3) Side cutters.
  4) Pliers.
  5) File.
  6) A hobby saw.
  7) PVC tape.
  8) Superglue, (be very careful with this).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Strip at least 6" to 9" of sleeving off of one end of the coaxial cable.
  Do NOT discard this sleeving. Seperate the braid from the inner conductor.
  Solder the inner conductor to the head of the brass countersunk-head screw.
  Double click on the icon ~HardWare~ for additional information. To quit
  the ~HardWare~ screen press any key and the screen will close.
  Place the sleeving over the braiding before fitting the crocodile clip
  and then wrap some PVC tape around the ~Y~ joint of the cable. Solder
  the crocodile clip to the braiding. Dismantle an old ballpoint pen to
  obtain the case. Discard all of the inner parts of the pen.
  Before reassembling the screw into the ballpoint pen case, cut the case
  down to a practical length (approximately 3" to 4"). Fit the PHONO (RCA)
  plug to the other end of the coaxial cable, inner conductor to the pin,
  the braid to the outer part of the plug.

  When you have checked this cable and are confident it is electrically good
  use the superglue to seal the top of the pen case and the nut. Do NOT get
  this glue on you or anything else as it is dangerous. Allow time to dry.

  Starting The Audio Generator:-
  ------------------------------
 
                               *** WARNING ***

             DO NOT USE WITH VOLTAGES GREATER THAN 12 VOLTS D.C.

  1) Ensure the AMIGA is switched OFF.
  2) Connect the cable to LEFT channel phono socket.
  3) Connect a blank PHONO/RCA plug to the RIGHT channel phono socket.
  4) Switch on the AMIGA.
  5) Start the ~Sin_Square_Gen~ software from its icon.
  6) Connect up to an audio circuit and start testing.
  7) When finished switch OFF the AMIGA and disconnect all of the hardware.

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
