                       Welcome to the TestGear projects.
                       ---------------------------------

  If you are an amateur electronics enthusiast you will find that you
  require test equipment to set up and calibrate your construction projects.
  This equipment can be expensive and may even be difficult to operate.

  What I have done is to set out a series of construction projects where a
  previous project may be used to calibrate the next project, each project
  getting progressively more difficult. All the projects will be some form
  of test equipment used in the electronics industry.

  Every project will be designed, built, tested and used by myself to prove
  that it works and cells or batteries will be used for calibration, so make
  sure that you have at least a 1.5 Volt cell available for test purposes.
  I used ~EVEREADY~ ULTRA PLUS RED Body types for the calibration. Type ~R6~
  for the 1.5 Volts nominal and type ~6F22~ for the 9 Volts nominal,
  although any ZINC/CHLORIDE cells or batteries should be alright. They were
  all NEW as this gives a definitive starting point to work from.

  The only assumptions (one must NEVER make assumptions) that I am going to
  make are that YOU have a MultiMeter (MultiTester) and a little knowledge of
  electronics, the ability to solder, and the ability to build projects.
  Age is unimportant so long as you are competent. I may design a MultiMeter
  but as these are extremely cheap it would be better to purchase one.
  If you have limited knowledge on project construction, soldering, testing
  etc.. then go to your local library for books on the subjects.

  These projects will be based around a Standard AMIGA A500 (unless stated
  otherwise) or better, using WorkBench 1.3x or better. Some projects may
  require WorkBench 2.0x or better.

  The projects are all in numbered directories. The only one that you can
  ignore if you require is ~Project1~ but ONLY if you have already downloded
  it as TestCard.lha and TestCard.readme from Aminet. If you have not got
  this project then start your building from here. The hardware for the
  first few projects is very simple indeed.

  The way to gain experience is to build your own equipment. This gives you
  a firm basis to start a career on, if electronics is what you want to do.

  Have some enjoyment and start building....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Important:-
  -----------

  Because of the way the AMIGA is made you MUST fit a blank RCA/PHONO plug
  into any UNUSED Audio Ouput Socket to obtain the calibrated results
  of the software in use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A few DO's and DO NOTs:-
  ------------------------

  1) Do NOT plug any equipment into the Amiga's socket(s) without turning off
     the Amiga first.
  2) Do NOT leave the soldering iron ON when it is not in use.
  3) Be careful when using any etching fluids.
  4) If an external supply is required then do NOT reverse polarity the
     connections.
  5) DO, thoroughly check all of your work before powering the project up.
  6) DO take great care when using glues and solvents.
  7) Read the ~Warning~ document.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note:-
  ------

  If you are using a standard AMIGA A500 with 512KB of memory only then the
  programs may run slowly. This is the trade off for making these programs
  work with most of the WorkBench versions available.

  Also each set of projects should fit onto a standard size AMIGA floppy
  disk, so you should be able to download from AMINET and unarchive to
  ~DF0:~ without placing them onto your hard disk drive. Lastly the projects
  do NOT require any special ASSIGNMENTS and will run straight from their
  own directories.

  You will notice that the projects are not pretty to look at but they are
  highly functional. That is, they do what they are supposed to do without
  any unwanted whistles and bells.

  GPL Licence Notice:-
  --------------------

  Projects 1 to 4 inclusive are now issued under the ~GPL~ Licence terms and
  conditions and all ~Source Code~ can be found in the ~TestGear-Notes.lha~
  and ~TestGear-Notes.readme~ archives in the ~hard/hack~ drawer of AMINET.

  ------------------

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
