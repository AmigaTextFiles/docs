             -----------------------------------------------------


    Minimum operating requirements are:-
    ------------------------------------

    1) Standard Amiga A500 with 512Kb or more of memory.
    2) Workbench 1.3x.
    3) An external floppy disk drive is required.
    4) OCS.
    5) The mouse is optional.
    6) The software has NOT been tested on an Amiga A1000.
    7) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 1.2x or less.
    8) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 3.1x or greater.

    General information:-
    ---------------------

    An Audio Wattmeter designed to measure 1 Watt to 100 Watts into a
    7.5 Ohm (low reactance) resistive load. This uses the newly constructed
    Analogue to Digital Converter (Project6).

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler and some assembler.

    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 34MB of ram
    (thanks to Laurence J Greatorex).

    Next project:-
    --------------

    The next project is an RF Probe (Sniffer) which is used to set up
    transmitter multiplier stages and output stages up to aproximatley
    1GHz. This uses the A-D Converter also.
