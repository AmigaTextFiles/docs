  Overview:-
  ----------

  Many modern Linear Audio Amplifiers have ~Bridge~ type outputs and this
  makes measurement of power output tricky. This Audio Wattmeter overcomes
  this problem using a Mains Transformer as an isolating transformer, using
  one of the 120 Volt windings as an input from the amplifier and using the
  other 120 Volt winding as the coupling for the detector circuit, the
  load for the amplifier being the two 15 Ohm, 50 Watt resistors wired in
  parallel. The accuracy of the prototype was far better than the above
  specifications suggest. This can be used to test all types of Linear
  Audio Amplifiers with various means of Output coupling, up to about
  100 Watts (RMS). The unit was checked at 400Hz Sinewave using ~Project5~,
  the Stereo LF Audio Function Generator as the signal source, driving a
  Public Address amplifier capable of giving 120 Watts output. This was
  directly connected to the two wires of the Wattmeter input, presenting a
  7.5 Ohm load to the amplifier.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Construction:-
  --------------

  1) Using the two resistors R1,R2 as templates, drill four holes through
     the HEATSINK as shown in the HardWare drawing. Countersink the two
     innermost holes on the underside of the HEATSINK. Deburr as neccessary.
  2) Fit the resistors to the HEATSINK using the two innermost holes and
     two countersunk screws, nuts and washers.
  3) Using the BLUE and YELLOW connecting wire, connect the two power
     resistors up so that they are wired as per the HardWare drawing. Leave
     a long BLUE wire and a long YELLOW wire free, (these will be the INPUT
     wires). Also leave a short BLUE wire and a short YELLOW wire free,
     (these will be connected to the transformer later).
  4) Centralise the HEATSINK inside the BOX and drill two holes A and B
     through the BOX using the resistors as templates. Countersink these two
     holes on the underside of the BOX. Fit the HEATSINK inside the BOX
     using two countersunk screws, nuts and washers. See HardWare drawing.
  5) Drill two holes for the transformer T1 using the transformer holes as
     a template. Countersink these two holes on the underside of the BOX.
     Fit the transformer T1 using two countersunk screws, nuts and washers.
  6) Connect up the short BLUE and YELLOW wires to the transformer T1 as
     per the HardWare drawing, (120 Volt winding).
  7) Using a TAGSTRIP of your choice as a template drill hole(s) through the
     BOX. Countersink the hole(s) on the underside of the BOX. If a TAGSTRIP
     is unavailable then use TERMINAL BLOCK instead.
  8) Fit the components D1,D2,D3,D4,C1,C2,R3,RV1 to the TAGSTRIP as per the
     HardWare drawing. Note the diode and capacitor polarities.
  9) Fit this assembled TAGSTRIP inside the BOX using countersunk screws,
     nuts and washers as required.
 10) Using the BLACK and RED connecting wire, connect the other two tags of
     the transformer T1 to tags 2 and 3 of the TAGSTRIP. Tag 7 is NOT used.
 11) Remove the outer insulation of the RG58/UR76 coaxial cable approximately
     2" (50mm) long. Part the braiding from the inner conductor. Connect
     the braiding to tag 1 of the TAGSTRIP. Connect the inner conductor
     to tag 6 of the TAGSTRIP. Insulate any bare wires as required.
 12) Drill one 1/4" (6.3mm) hole at either end of the BOX to allow the
     cables to go through. Feed the long BLUE and YELLOW wires through one
     end and the coaxial cable through the other.
 13) Fit an RCA/PHONO plug to the opposite end of the coaxial cable, inner
     conductor to the pin, braid to the body of the plug.
 14) You are now ready to calibrate the Audio Wattmeter.

  Note:-
  ------

  The two 20 Volt windings on the transformer T1 are NOT used.

  Calibrating the Audio Wattmeter:-
  ---------------------------------

  You WILL require a 9 Volt nominal battery type ~6F22~.
  I used an ~EVEREADY~ RED body ~ULTRA PLUS~ type, although any
  ZINC/CHLORIDE type will probably be alright.

  1) Switch OFF the AMIGA.
  2) Connect up the Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) to the parallel port.
  3) Connect the RCA/PHONO plug to the input of the ADC.
  4) Connect your 9 Volt nominal battery type ~6F22~, +ve terminal to C1 +ve,
     (tag 4 on the TAGSTRIP) and -ve terminal to C1 -ve, (tag 1 on the
     TAGSTRIP). These are shown as TP1 (+ve) and TP2 (-ve) on the Circuit
     drawing. Do NOT reverse these connections.
  5) Switch ON the AMIGA.
  6) Go to the ~Project6~ drawer and start the ~Parallel_Test~ software.
  7) Adjust RV1 to give 72 (flashing 73) in the window.
  8) Switch OFF the AMIGA.
  9) If this reading cannot be achieved then change the value of the SELECT
     ON TEST resistor R3. My value was 82 KilOhms.
 10) Do (1) to (8) again until the correct results are obtained.

  ---------------------------

  1) Read the ~Warning~ document.
  2) Connect up the system under test as follows:-
     Disconnect ALL Loudspeakers on the Channel under test ONLY.

        (I/P=Input, O/P=Output, ADC=Analogue to Digital Converter.)

  3) Switch ON all of the equipment
  4) From ~Project5~ start up the ~Function_Gen~ software.
  5) From ~Project7~ start up the ~Audio_Wattmeter~ software.
  6) Set the ~Function_Gen~ software to give 400Hz at ?mV Sinewave on either
     channel. The value ~?~ will be on the specification sheet of the
     Amplifier under test for any given input.
  7) Adjust the Amplifier controls and start testing.
  8) When all tests are complete switch OFF all of the equipment and
     disconnect all of the hardware.
