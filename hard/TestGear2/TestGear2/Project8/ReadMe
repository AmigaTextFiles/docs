    General information:-
    ---------------------

    An RF (Radio Frequency) Probe (Sniffer) used to set up all types of
    RF stages in transmitters. It is purely a detector and uses the Analogue

    calibrated.

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler and some assembler.

    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 34MB of ram
    thanks to Laurence J Greatorex, and also to Bob Eva for testing
    on his A1200, with a total of 10MB of ram.
