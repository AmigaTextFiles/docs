    All projects were intended for use with both NTSC and PAL in mind.

    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations and a similar A1200 with
    a Turbo LC accelerator board with an '030 and 34MB of total memory,
    thanks to Laurence J Greatorex, also to Bob Eva for testing on his
