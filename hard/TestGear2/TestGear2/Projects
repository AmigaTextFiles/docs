              A description of the projects in this directory:-
              -------------------------------------------------

  Project5:-
  ----------

  This project is a Stereo LF Audio Function Generator signal source.
  This generator will produce a Sinusoidal, Square, Triangle or Noise
  signal in each channel. It has sweep facilities on either channel and
  has the range from 25Hz to 2500Hz.

  Project6:-
  ----------

  This project is a parallel port Analogue to Digital Converter.
  This device is the interface between the analogue outside world and
  digital internals of the computer. A simple 0 Volt to +5 Volt DC (Direct
  Current) digital meter is in this directory. Also the calibrating
  software (that will be used extensively for future projects) is in here.

  Project7:-
  ----------

  This is an Audio Wattmeter from 1 Watt to 100 Watts into a low reactance
  resistive load of 7.5 Ohms. It is calibrated at 400Hz Sinewave and
  measures RMS (Root Mean Square) Power Output.

  Project8:-
  ----------

  This is an uncalibrated RF (Radio Frequency) Probe, used to align
  multiplier stages and output stages of Transmitters. It uses the A-D
  Converter as a level meter only, so therefore it does not need to be
  calibrated. Just build it, plug it in and use it. Its useful range
  is 1MHz to approximately 1GHz.
