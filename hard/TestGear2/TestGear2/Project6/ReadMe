    General information:-
    ---------------------

    An Analogue to Digital Converter for the next generation of projects.
    This project includes simple testing software to ensure that the
    parallel port is reading the finished item properly.

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler and some assembler.

    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 10MB of ram
    (thanks to Laurence J Greatorex).

    Next project:-
    --------------

    The next project is an Audio Wattmeter from 1 Watt to 100 Watts using
    the newly built Analogue to Digital Converter.
