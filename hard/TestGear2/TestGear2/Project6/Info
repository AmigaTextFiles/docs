                 The Analogue to Didital Converter project.
                 ------------------------------------------

  Overview:-
  ----------

  This project will enable you to use the parallel port to input voltages
  from 0 to +5 Volts positive and display this voltage as a number in a test
  window. When built it will be used with other projects to measure all
  types of signals whether they be DC, AC, voltage, current, power etc..
  using the correct type of software. With some minor modifications this will
  be used to make an oscilloscope. The first unit was built on a prototype
  EuroCard and was hard wired on the underside of the card. This will be
  the device to be described, although I have drawn a board layout for you
  that is NOT to scale at all. There are no instructions on how to fit this
  unit into a box. This will give you a chance to modify a standard box,
  drill any holes, cut out any slots that may be required to finish the unit
  off and then finally label it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Parts List:-
  ----------------

  For the first part of this project use the parts that are required for
  ~Circuit_1~ only. Do NOT fit R3, R4, RV2, ZD2 and SK1 at this point. I
  have included some suppliers references for the special items. The rest
  can be sourced from any supplier.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Construction Proper:-
  -------------------------

  1) Do NOT trust any markings on the EuroCard, they may be wrong!!
  2) Fit the 25 way ~D~ type plug to the EuroCard first. Check that the
     marking on the board at position ~1~ is ths SAME as pin ~1~ on the
     plug. If it is NOT the same then ignore all markings on the EuroCard.
     Fit this on to the NONE print side of the board.
  3) Fit the IC socket so that pin ~1~ is facing the same way as pin ~1~ on
     the ~D~ type plug. Fit this on the NONE print side of the board.
     When these are fitted MARK with CARE pin ~1~ on BOTH sides of the board
     so that you know where they are when you start adding the other
     components. An error at this point WILL be catastrophic on power up.

  Fit these remaining items on the print side of the board:-
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  4) Connect R2 from pin ~4~ to pin ~19~ on the IC holder.
  5) Connect C1 from pin ~4~ to pin ~2~ on the IC holder.
  6) Connect R1 from pin ~20~ to pin ~9~ on the IC holder.
  7) Connect ZD1 from pin ~9~ to pin ~10~ on the IC holder, the BAND going
     to pin ~9~.
  8) Hard wire the IC socket to the ~D~ type plug as follows:-

           IC1 PIN(S)                TO                 PL1 PIN(S)
           ----------                                   ----------

  9) Connect a RED wire from pin ~14~ of PL1 to one outside tag of RV1.
 10) Connect a BLACK wire from pin ~25~ of PL1 to the opposite oustide tag
     of RV1.
 11) Connect a BLUE wire from pin ~6~ of the IC holder to the centre tag
     of RV1.
 12) Plug the IC (IC1) into the holder, ensuring that pin ~1~ is in the
     correct position.
 13) CHECK all of your work. RECHECK all of your work again. CHECK against
     the circuit diagram, ~Circuit_1~.
 14) Check for short circuits, errors, faulty joints and components in the
     wrong place. Correct as required.
 15) Remember... an error at this point could result in a failure of your
     computer when you power up.
 16) Even a professional like myself has been known to make catastrophic
     errors when building prototype equipment.
 17) When you are sure that you have constructed the A-D Converter properly
     you are now ready to connect to your computer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Testing the A-D Converter:-
  ---------------------------

  1) Switch off the AMIGA.
  2) Plug the A-D Converter board into the parallel port.
  3) Boot up the AMIGA.
  4) Start the ~Parallel_Test~ software. This will be a small window with
     a number between 0 and 255 showing.
  5) Rotate the potentiometer RV1 in either direction and this number will
     change between a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 255. If you get this
     result then Well Done. Switch OFF the AMIGA and disconnect the A-D
     Converter. It is working correctly.
  6) If you do NOT get this result switch OFF the AMIGA and disconnect the
     A-D Converter. RECHECK all of your work, repair as neccessary and retry
     1) to 5).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Finishing off the A-D Converter proper:-
  ----------------------------------------

  Parts List:-
  ------------

  You will now require the parts for ~Circuit_2~ to finish off this project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Wiring information part 2:-
  ---------------------------

  1) Disconnect the RED wire from pin ~14~ of PL1.
  2) Disconnect the BLACK wire from the tag of RV1. Do NOT disconnect this
     wire from pin ~25~ of PL1.
  3) Disconnect the BLUE wire from pin ~6~ of the IC holder.
  4) Connect ZD2 from pin ~6~ to pin ~8~ of the IC holder, the BAND going
     to pin ~6~.
  5) Fit the preset variable resistor on the NONE print side of the board
     about 10 holes away from pin ~6~ of the IC holder.
  6) Connect R3 from pin ~6~ of the IC holder to the centre tag of RV2.
     Use insulation sleeving as required.
  7) Connect R4 from pin ~10~ of the IC holder to one of the outside tags
     of RV2. Use insulation sleeving as required.
  8) Connect the opposite outside tag of RV2 to the inner conductor of a
     PHONO/RCA socket.
  9) Connect the body of the PHONO/RCA socket to the remaining BLACK wire.
 10) CHECK all of your modifications. RECHECK these modifications. CHECK
     against the circuit diagram, ~Circuit_2~.
 11) If all is well then you are now ready to calibrate the A-D Converter.
 12) You will require a new 1.5 Volt cell for calibration purposes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Calibrating the A-D Converter:-
  -------------------------------

  You WILL require a 1.5 Volt dry cell type ~R6~. I used an ~EVEREADY~
  RED body ~ULTRA PLUS~ type, although any ZINC/CHLORIDE type will probably
  be alright.

  1) Do ~Testing the A-D Converter:-~ parts 1) to 4) first.
  2) The reading in the window should now read 0 (flashing 1).
  3) Connect the 1.5 Volt cell across the RCA input of the A-D Converter
     using the previously made test lead from the Stereo LF Audio Function
     Generator project (Project5), positive to probe tip.
  4) Adjust RV2 to give a value of 85 (flashing 86) in the window.
  5) If all is well then you now have a simple 0 to +5 Volt DC voltmeter.
  6) Run the ~VoltMeter~ software to start using the A-D Converter proper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Volt Meter Specifications:-
  ---------------------------

  Voltage Range..........................  0 to +5 Volts.
  Resolution.............................  20 mV.
  Accuracy...............................  + or - 5% of full scale.
  Input resistance.......................  20 KilOhms.
  Sensitivity............................  4 KilOhms/Volt.
  Test lead(s)...........................  Use ~Project5~ test lead.

  WARNING:-
  ---------

  1) DO NOT USE ON VOLTAGES GREATER THAN +12 VOLTS.
  2) DO NOT TRY TO MEASURE NEGATIVE VOLTAGES AT ALL.
  3) ANY ATTEMPT TO DO EITHER OF THE ABOVE MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE
     BOARD AND/OR THE COMPUTER.
  4) ANY VOLTAGES GREATER THAN +5.1 VOLTS WILL LIMIT TO +5.1 ON THE DISPLAY.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  And finally:-
  -------------

  This circuit board will be modified at a much later date for future
  designs. However it is good for most of the projects to come.
  There is an image of 320x200xHAM of my origonal prototype in this drawer.
  It is called ~Prototype_Board.ham~. You will require some type of ~HAM~
  viewing software to see it. I did not bother to write one as this image
  is unimportant to the overall package.
