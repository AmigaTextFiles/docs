               Well done you have now reached TestGear Disk 2.
               -----------------------------------------------

  I have assumed (one must NEVER make assumptions) that you have progressed
  through TestGear Disk 1 (TestGear1.lha and TestGear1.readme) and made the
  simple test leads for the first four projects. The projects on this disk
  are more sophisticated. Some will be connected to the parallel port.
  Take great care when connecting to, and disconnecting from this port.
  There will be NO more references to switching OFF the AMIGA before
  connecting hardware after this text. Also there will be NO more references
  about the use of solvents, glues, dangerous tools and any high electrical
  voltage hazards after this text. By now you should be well aware of any
  problems and dangers that exist with electronic equipment. So here are the
  final warning notes to remind you.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Important:-
  -----------

  If you try any of the software that requires the Analogue to Digital
  Converter without the Analogue to Digital Converter connected the system
  should NOT crash, however the display will always read a maximum value
  for that particular piece of software giving you an idea of the
  capabilities of that software. Enjoy constructing your projects.

  Because of the way the AMIGA is made you MUST fit a blank RCA/PHONO plug
  into any UNUSED Audio Output Socket to obtain the calibrated results of
  the software in use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

  There will no longer be a ~Tools Required~ list in each project's ~Info~
  file. You should now be well aware that you require a standard set of
  electronic and hobbyist tools to make all the projects. However any
  special tools that may be required will be listed, along with any source
  for that tool.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Calibration Equipment:-
  -----------------------

  To calibrate most of the projects from now on you WILL require some dry
  cells or batteries. I decided on using the ~EVEREADY~ RED types as these
  are well known in the UK. They were all NEW, as this gives a definitive
  starting point to work from. However any ZINC/CHLORIDE types should be OK.
  Alkaline batteries were NOT used to calibrate any projects.
  
  1) R6..............  1.5 Volt nominal, RED body type, (ULTRA PLUS).
  2) 6F22............  9 Volts nominal, RED body type, (ULTRA PLUS).

  These are available from most retail outlets.

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

Also to Laurence J Greatorex for giving these a shakedown on his A1200 with
a Turbo LC '030 accelerator board and 32MB of fast ram, also to Bob Eva for
testing on his A1200, with a total of 10MB of ram, and also to all the
other people that have given any of these projects a rigorous testing.
And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
