             A Stereo LF Audio Function Generator for the beginner.
             ------------------------------------------------------


    Minimum operating requirements are:-
    ------------------------------------

    1) Standard Amiga A500 with 512Kb or more of memory.
    2) Workbench 1.3x.
    3) An external floppy disk drive is required.
    4) OCS.
    5) The mouse is optional.
    6) The software has NOT been tested on an Amiga A1000.
    7) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 1.2x or less.
    8) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 3.1x or greater.

    General information:-
    ---------------------

    This tool generates an independant AF signal source on each channel from
    25Hz to 2500Hz. The source can be SINE, SQUARE or TRIANGLE  with or
    without SWEEP facility plus a NOISE generator. Its useful range is
    10Hz to 3000Hz. It is controlled entirely from the keyboard.

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler.

    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 10MB of ram
    (thanks to Laurence J Greatorex).

    Next project:-
    --------------

    The next project is an ANALOG to DIGITAL Converter. This will be
    required for the next generation of projects. It sounds as if it is
    hard to construct but in fact it is still very simple, requires very few
    components, but when finished will plug into the parallel port of the
    AMIGA and provide a new input source.
