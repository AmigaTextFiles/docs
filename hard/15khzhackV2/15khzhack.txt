      don't go on reading. If you do things the wrong way, you have a high
      chance that you will burn your monitor off. We are not responsible
      for that. Usage of this document and the information herein is all
      at your own risk.

Note : we have been successfully using this trick for more than 1 year and
       it has given us no problem whatsoever, even with old monitors.
       However this was tested (directly by us) only on >1991 C= 1084S
       monitors. It should work just the same on older models like the
       1084 and the Philips CMM8833 (or whatever that monitor is called).
       Many other people tried it and it has given them no problem, but
       in case you burn up your monitor, hey, that's your problem.

***************************************************************************

What you need is the following:

 - Commodore 1084 or similar monitor (see below for details)
 - AGA or ECS chipsets
 - WB3.0 or maybe 2.1
 - No hardware hack/change
 - Your favourite filezapper

Ok. Now:

1. Copy the Euro36 monitor driver to DEVS:Monitors.
   This monitor handles 73Hz-15Khz screens that *can* *be* *displayed*
   by the above mentioned monitor (at least our do 8) but not very well
   because part of the screen is not visible. So you have to:

2. Edit the Euro36 tooltypes to bring down the frequency to about 70-71hz.
   Trying some values with MonEd I reached for the optimal value (for my
   monitor) which is:

    TOTROWS = 0xdd

   (any other tooltypes should be left untouched). This is not enough,
   though, because the screen has the right size, but it's too 'high up'.
   Unfortunately the 'Overscan' program won't lower it, so you have to:

3. Reset so that the system recognizes the new monitor

4. Load the overscan prefs and save them the way they are already. (do not
   skip this part!)

5. Manually edit the overscan.prefs file in the prefs/Env-Archive/sys/
   drawer with your favourite filezapper, and change the value $10 to $15
   at offset $039 (this only if the Euro36 is the first in the list in
   the overscan prefs, otherwise the offset will be a different one).

Now, if everything went right, you should have in your screen mode requester
the Euro36 mode. Load the Screenmode pref and look at the values of the
frequencies. They shouldbe 71hz and 15.64khz in a maximum resolution of
1280x400. Try to select it and hope...

NOTE: You are risking to melt down your monitor, so if something looks
      wrong, turn the monitor off immediately ! (you are advised)

Advantages of this method:

- A 71hz interlaced screen flickers way less even than an NTSC one
  (try it with Imagine !)
- Appartently the DMA is not slowed down by it (unlike the DBLPAL 8(,
  and some times it even looks like the refresh is faster)

Disadvantages:

- The screen height is limited to 400 pixels, like in NTSC.
- Only horizontal overscan is possible.

I have no idea on which monitors this trick will work on, but on my 1084S
it works great since last year, even if the manual says it is only 50hz.
This trick *DOES* *NOT* work on TVs (no way, don't even try) but it should
work on other similar monitors that support NTSC. Let me know about it.
