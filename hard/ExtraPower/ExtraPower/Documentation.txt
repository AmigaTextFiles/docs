 WHAT:
=======

 This is a text descriping how to connect a PC power supply to an A1200 (or
A500 or A600).

 WHY:
======

 Because an Amiga PSU is so incredibbly overpriced.

 HOW:
======

 The Amiga uses +5v, +12v and -12v. The pins are located like this from the
PSU:

                             ----OOO----
                             |         |
             (Brown) +12v -> | X     X | <- Signal GND (Black)
                             |    X    |
             Not Used ??? -> |  X   X  | <- +5v (Red)
                             |    ^    |
                             -----|-----
                                  |
                                -12v (White)

 To be sure of the colors, try testing it with a multi-meter, or in the lack
of better, you can use a small lightbulp (like in a bicycle lamp), and a
battery. Connect the bulp to one end of the battery, then put the lamp to one
of the pins from the socket from the 'Amiga PSU power wire', make sure the
lamp only touches one pin, then touch the other end of the battery with the
(de-insulated) wires from the 'Amiga PSU power wire' one at a time. When the
light bulp lights, you have obviously found the correct wire. If this doesn't
make sence, perhaps im too stoned or you should just have a nice game of
Pacman.

 On the PC-PSU, there should be two 6-pin sockets. The pinouts are

1st socket:
Pin 1: GND (Black)
Pin 2: GND (Black)
Pin 3: -5v (White)
Pin 4: +5v (Red)
Pin 5: +5v (Red)
Pin 6: +5v (Red)

2nd socket:
Pin 1: Who cares ???
Pin 2: Does anyone care.
Pin 3: +12v (Yello)
Pin 4: -12v (Blue)
Pin 5: GND (Black)
Pin 6: GND (Black)

 The idea is to connect the +5v, +12v, -12v and GND signals from the PC-PSU,
with the +5v, +12v, -12v and GND.

Heres a connection table:

PC Wires    Amiga Wires
-----------------------
Black    -> Black
Yellow   -> Brown
Blue     -> White
Red      -> Red


 Figure the rest out for yourself; use your imagination; if you haven't got one,
go sit in a corner.

6 o'clock in the morning (night ?) one saturday in april 1996.

 HELP:

 Well, it worked for me.

 P.S.:

 Try this hack at your own risk. It can be very dangerous. You may even die,
imagine that.

 P.P.S.:
=========

 I would like to thank Jens Hansen from Stenløse, Denmark. Without whom i had
stopped when i blew up my A1200 with static electricity. Allways remember to
completely disconnect any periphals and equalize your voltage with the computer
by touching the shielding of the computer before working with it. NEWER use a
radiator or waterpipes to 'discharge' as you will become differently charged
than the computer, wich causes current to flow, and blow up my computer :(

 P.P.P.S.:
===========

 If you are using an A1200 and 3.5" internal HD, let me suggest that you make
an additional power socket by soldering one to the inside of your computer (see
picture).
There is two advantages to this approach:
1. By using the extra power socket for the HD, the power will run directly from
the power input to the HD. If you are powering your (3.5") HD from your floppy
power, the power used for the harddisk, wich is quite a lot, will run through
your motherboard and eventually disturp some components, making your computer
unstable; especially when using floppy and HD at the same time. The extra power
cable will make your A1200 with 3.5" HD more stable. Especially if you have a HD
that uses a lot of power.
2. By partially isolating the powerconsumption of the HD from the motherboard,
you might reduce the risk of damaging the motherboard by connecting a faulty HD.

 P.P.P.P.S.:

 No, i'm not utterly insane. If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to
mail me (see .readme). For those of you Amigans without email: You're really
missing out on something. If you can afford it, you should do so ! It's here !!!

 Remember, this is just guidelines !!!! I haven't been particular thorough on
the data, so double check me ;)
