CD-Rom Mixer
This little schematic shows how I connected 2 cdrom 
drives (1 cdrom and 1 cd-r drive actually) and the Amiga 
soundoutput to one output
The cdrom-audiocables have both been fitted with 
standard 3.5mm stereo jack.
This is done because my mixer is fitted in a box.

Some notes are in Dutch!!
