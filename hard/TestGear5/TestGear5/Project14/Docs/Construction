                    Construction Of The Frequency Counter.
                    --------------------------------------

  The Main Board:-
  ----------------

  1) Cut a piece of stripboard 27 holes wide by 25 strips down.
  2) Cut the strips in the positions shown in the ~Counter_Board.drawing~
     using a small drill or the proper cutting tool.
  3) Mount the IC holders first, and solder into place.
  4) Next fit the wire links and CON1 and CON2, refer to the
     ~Counter_Board.drawing~ for CON1 and CON2.
  5) Fit the resistors.
  6) With care, fit the two diodes. Ensure that they are in the correct way
     round.
  7) Connect the three wires to the ~D~ type socket and the board, refer
     to the ~Counter_Board.drawing~.
  8) Connect two wires to the INPUT socket and the board, refer to the
     ~Counter_Board.drawing~.
  9) For TESTING PURPOSES ONLY connect a red wire to point ~A~ on the board
     and a black wire to point ~B~ on the board.
 10) Do NOT insert the ICs AT ALL at this point.
 11) THOROUGHLY check ALL of your work.
 12) Check it again. Remember that an error can cause catastrophic failure
     of the computer on power up.
 13) You are now ready to test the unit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Testing The Counter:-
  ---------------------

  1) Do NOT connect the ~D~ type socket to the games port AT ALL.
  2) From ~Project12~, (The Oscilloscope Project), use the
     ~Continuity_Tester~ and connect across the two red and black wires of
     the Counter Board. If the light bulb illuminates then STOP, recheck ALL
     of your construction work.
  3) From ~Project12~, (The Oscilloscope Project), use the
     ~Continuity_Tester~ and connect across PIN 6 of the ~D~ type sockect to
     the red wire. If the light bulb illuminates then STOP, recheck ALL
     of your construction work.
  4) From ~Project12~, (The Oscilloscope Project), use the
     ~Continuity_Tester~ and connect across PIN 6 of the ~D~ type sockect to
     the black wire. If the light bulb illuminates then STOP, recheck ALL
     of your construction work.
  5) Using the A-D Converter, ~Project6~, start up the 5 Volt DC Voltmeter
     as per the instructions of ~Project6~.
  6) From ~Project12~, (The Oscilloscope Project), use the 4.5 Volt battery
     used to test this project and connect to the red and black wires of
     the Counter Board. Red wire to the + of the battery, black wire to the
     - of the battery.
  7) The Counter is now powered up WITHOUT the ICs inserted.
  8) Using the 5 Volt DC Voltmeter connect the -ve, (black crocodile clip),
     to the battery -ve, (point ~B~ on the board).
  9) Set the jumpers to the positions shown in the ~Counter_Board.drawing~.
 10) Using the table below check each pin number of the two IC sockets:-

            IC1, (74HC390).                       IC2,  (SG531P).
            PIN      Volts.                       PIN      Volts.
             1     Any +ve DC                      1       Supply
             2         0                           2         0
             3     Any +ve DC                      3         0
             4     Any +ve DC                      4         0
             5         0                           5         0
             6         0                           6         0
             7     Any +ve DC                      7         0
             8         0                           8       supply
             9     Any +ve DC
             10        0
             11        0
             12        0
             13    Any +ve DC
             14        0
             15    Any +ve DC
             16      Supply

 11) If ALL is well switch OFF the AMIGA, disconnect the 4.5 Volt battery,
     remove the extra red and black wires form points ~A~ and ~B~ of the
     Counter board and disconnect the hardware from the AMIGA.
 12) If NOT, recheck ALL of your work and start again.
 13) VERY carefully insert IC1 and IC2 into the sockets. Ensure that they
     are the correct way round.
 14) The unit is now ready for Calibration.
 15) Refer to the ~Info~ document for this proceedure.

  Note:-
  ------

  When finished the Counter can be fitted into any box of your choice.

  The Experimental Amp:-
  ----------------------

  There are NO constructional details about the ~Experimental_Amp~ as this
  is/was a temporary design only and MAY be modified at a later date. The
  prototype was built onto a very small piece of stripboard, keeping ALL
  of the components as close as possible, to reduce shunt capacitances down
  to an absolute minimum.

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
