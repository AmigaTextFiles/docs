               Well done you have now reached TestGear Disk 5.
               -----------------------------------------------

  I have assumed (one must NEVER make assumptions) that you have progressed
  through TestGear Disk 1 (TestGear1.lha and TestGear1.readme), also
  through TestGear Disk 2 (TestGear2.lha and TestGear2.readme), also
  through TestGear Disk 3 (TestGear3.lha and TestGear3.readme), also
  through TestGear Disk 4 (TestGear4?.lha and TestGear4?.readme), I now
  expect that you have built projects (1) to (12) inclusive and that you
  are now ready for the next series of projects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Important Information:-
  -----------------------

  The A-D Converter from ~TestGear2.lha~, ~Project6~ on Aminet WILL be
  required for some of the projects in this drawer. If you just want
  to try the software out but NOT build the hardware then READ the ~Info~
  file in the relevant ~Project?~ drawer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you try any of the software that requires the Analogue to Digital
  Converter without the Analogue to Digital Converter connected the system
  should NOT crash, however the display will always read a maximum value
  for that particular piece of software giving you an idea of the
  capabilities of that software. Enjoy constructing your projects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Calibration Equipment:-
  -----------------------

  To calibrate most of the projects you WILL require some dry cells or
  batteries. I decided on using the ~EVEREADY~ RED types as these are
  well known in the UK. They were all NEW, as this gives a definitive
  starting point to work from. However any ZINC/CHLORIDE types should be OK.
  Alkaline batteries were NOT used to calibrate any projects.
  
  1) R6..............  1.5 Volt nominal, RED body type, (ULTRA PLUS).
  2) 6F22............  9 Volts nominal, RED body type, (ULTRA PLUS).

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
