     Ok thiz time it's a Txt file made for all ya by Nemesis of TCB!!!!
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

  This text is a number of simple hints for those who have bought
  one 1.44 drive (1520k exactly!!) and still have some troubbles with it!

  First of all the 2Nd external drive is usually recognized by the system
  as one STANDARD 880K drive when you make a reset and you keep a DOS disk
  inside your drive...( do this if ya wanna have a 880K drive for any 
  reasons...).
 
  If you wanna have a 1.44 Mb drive you have to toggle any disk from your
  1.44 mb drive and to reset (Sometimes you need 2 resets to have a 
  NON_INITIALISED drive!!!
  At this time you must Configure this drive in order to be recognised 
  and labelled as an 1.44 Mb drive...
  To do this you must modify 2 system files.. the 'Startup-sequence' in
  the S directory... and the 'Mountlist' in the Devs directory.

  In the Startup-sequence you have simply to add the following statement 
  at the start of it...

  Mount df2:

  ...and then save it 

  In the mountlist instead you have to add many statements...
  
  instead of doing this difficoult stuff I included in this .zip file
  A cli-command named ... Mega2

  you simply have to type:

  Mega2 df2: 2
 
  to have your drive installed...
  you have to do this only one time coz the changes are permanently saved
  in the disk/hd you are using right now!
  (That's coz this command modifies the startup-sequence and the mountlist
  in order to mount the drive 'df2:' all the time you boot from that disk)

  Note that if you want to use another disk you have got to boot from it
  and then reuse the command mega2 df2: 2 ....

  For those who are interested there are only 2 differences from the
  880K and the 1.44 Mb drives...
 
  The first one is the number of the sectors per track that is 19 instead 
  of 11 (In fact to use the 1.44 mb mode you need High Density disks!!)

  The second one is that the handler device is not the 'Trackdisk.device'
  but the 'cgr.device' that can handle HD diskettes...

  I hope this TXT is clear enought for ya and that all your troubbles 
  were fixed.... if it's not contact me at :
