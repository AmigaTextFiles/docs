Teletext national fonts
***********************
FREEWARE by Adriano De Minicis

Purpose
ннннннн
This archive contains localized fonts for the TeleText v1.20 software
(by Jan Leuverink). If you live in Italy, UK, France, Spain, or Sweden,
you have probably noticed that some special characters (for example the
accented wovels) are always replaced by wrong chars. The reason is that
there is a subset (13 chars) of the west-european teletext character set
that contains different characters in different nations. Since the TT1.20
software uses the German subset and there is not a way of switching between
those national subsets, I had to modify the teletext font.

Here you find the Italian, English, French, Spanish, Swedish fonts,
togheter with the original (German) font provided with TeleText.

System requirements
ннннннннннннннннннн
TeleText v1.20 hardware and software.

Installation
нннннннннннн
Simply copy the font files contained in the directory corresponding to your
language to the FONTS: dir. For example, if you want the swedish char set:

Copy TT120_Fonts/Swedish FONTS: all

If you have the teletext software running (or you have used it after the
reset) you must exit the program and flush the old font from memory to
note the difference (to flush memory, type "avail flush" in a shell).
If, for strange reasons, you want to revert to the original TT120 font,
you can find it in the directory "Original-German".

How to test if the char set is OK?
нннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннннн
View with TT1.20 the test page (here in Italy is page 198) which shows
the entire charset, and compare what appeare on your monitor to the
corresponding page decoded by your TV. Be sure that the signal reception
is perfect when doing the comparison!
