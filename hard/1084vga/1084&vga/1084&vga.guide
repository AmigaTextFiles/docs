Send @{"me" LINK "contact"} a E-mail if you try this so that i know that i didn't write this
for nothing. If some people sends E-mail the I might write some more stuff.

Do you switch between you amiga-monitor and vga-monitor by turning you
computer and monitors off and then exchange cables? I did that for about
a year then a new idee crossed my mind.

@{"Composite-cable" LINK "comp"} Simpel, and gives the best picture quality.
@{"SCART-VCR cable" LINK "doitvcr"} If you want to use your monitor as TV as well.

@{i}Return to @{ui}@{"main" LINK "main"}.
@EndNode

@Node "doitvcr"
@title "SCART-VCR cable"

What you need:
Amiga monitor (1084 or 8033 or something like that)
Vga monitor   (I have a "AST SVGA-LR")
VCR           (With SCART)
RF-cable      (You got one with your amiga)
@{"SCART-cable" LINK "cable"}  (Depending of 1084-model)

How to connect:
1. Connect the VGA-monitor with a vga-adapter to the video port (as usual).
2. Connect the RF-cable from your amiga to the VCR.
3. Connect a @{"SCART-cable" LINK "cable"} from the video to you 1084.
4. Put your monitor in Comp.-mode (small swith on the 1084-monitor)
5. Tune VCR to amiga-signal.

If you want VGA then turn on your VGA-monitor (and turn of your 1084!)
if you want 1084 then turn on your 1084 (and turn of your VGA-monitor!)

Now I use the VGA for "serious"-work and the 1084 for games!

@Node "comp"
@title "Composite-cable"

What you need:
Amiga monitor   (1084 or 8033 or something like that)
Vga monitor     (I have a "AST SVGA-LR")
Composite cable (Ordinary cabel with a 'phono' contact in each end)

Connect one end to amiga video-out and the other end to monitor video-in.

You can try this with the monitor soud cabel if you like. Put the red one
in amiga video-out and the other red one in monitor video-in (Or use the
black ones if you like them better...).

Put your monitor in Comp.-mode (small swith on the 1084-monitor)

This connection should give you the best picture-quality but the
VCR-connection has the benifit of alowing you to watch TV on your monitor
as well.

Why not take a look at Pietro Altomani project "15khz_vga.txt" on aminet?

@title "SCART to Video"

If your 1084 doesn't have a scart-input then build a special cable
that connects to videoin (I did this):
SCART:			1084s:
19	CVBS OUT	Videoin
17	CVBS GND	GND Videoin 
1	AUDIO OUT	Audioin R (or if it was L, I doesn't remember..)
3	AUDIO OUT	Audioin L (or if it was R...)
4	AUDIO GND	GND Audio (R or L)

I guess that any SCART-cable should work.. go and by one!

I found a pic on my HD that shows how to make a cable. I doesn't know
if it works nor who made it. Try it and se what happends... Caboom!

@{"Video SCART to 1084-RGB" LINK scart.iff/main}

This cable ought to give you a good picture, if it works.
For the best picture, use the composite-cable.
