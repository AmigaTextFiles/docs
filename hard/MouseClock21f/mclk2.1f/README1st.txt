PLEASE READ THIS FIRST - 18 Feb 2000
------------------------------------

I sold my Amiga two years ago, and since than I forgot this project...
Now I've received a request for the registration, but since I cannot
support anymore this project, I decided to release the schematics and
mounting plans, and all the source code, so all this is now FREEWARE.

The last change is in the software v1.23 (1998) due to someone
reporting me timeout problems with an accelerated A4000.

I DO NOT KNOW IF THE SOFTWARE STILL WORKS WITH THE NEW MODELS OF
AMIGA/ACCELERATORS/OS, AND I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PROJECT ANYMORE.
SO THERE IS NO WARRANTY. BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I've included all the version of the software and all the schematics
and mounting plans so you have all the data to modify this hw/sw as
you wish.

This doc and this archive were made with a PC with the only one backup
of my files on a MSDOS disk, so there is the slight chance that some
file might be lost or corrupted.
