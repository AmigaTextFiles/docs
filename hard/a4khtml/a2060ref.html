While Ethernet is far more popular, Arcnet has recently becomevery cheap on the Amiga due to a surplus of these cards.<P>While Arcnet does not transfer information as quickly as Ethernet, testsof actual transfers on the Amiga suggest that it can move information atrates up to 150K bytes per second, which is adequate for many purposes.Arcnet can be configured in a bus arrangement where each machine is linkedto the next, or in a star, where all the machines are connected to an activehub. The A2060 will work with both setups.<P>The A2060 has some bugs. First, the "hybrid" chip that forms the electronicinterface to the Arcnet network comes in two different versions: HCY 9058(for bus networks) and HCY 9068 (for star networks). As the A2060 manualdescribes it, the board is for a bus network, but many A2060s come withthe 9068 (star) hybrid installed. A bus network needs 93-ohm terminatorsat each end, and this works fine with the 9058 (bus) version of the hybrid.With the 9068, however, the hybrid itself performs the termination. Toconnect two machines with 9068 hybrids, run coax from one machine to theother, without using terminators. Using T-connectors to attach more machinesin the middle of the bus may or may not work, due to each one adding itstermination to the bus. To connect a 9068-version A2060 to a bus networkof 9058-version A2060s, place it at the end of the chain and connect thecable directly, without a terminator (this may limit the network to onlybeing operational when the 9068-equipped machine is on). Both versionsof the card should have no problems when attached directly to an activehub. It is also possible to replace the HCY 9068 hybrid with the 9058 version,provided you can locate one.<P>There are also several well-known problems with version 37.2 of the"a2060.device" driver software. Replacements for this driver are availablein the comm/net directory of Aminet. Some commercial networking packageslike Envoy 2.0 also include much better replacement drivers.<P>Other Notes<P>Arcnet requires RG62 coaxial cable, <I>not</I> the RG58 that Ethernetuses, and has a minimum cable length between stations of three feet (0.9meter). Active hubs used for a star layout are self-terminating, so cablesare connected directly between the hub and the Arcnet cards.<P>If the A2060 does not perform reliably even with updated driver software,check the board for cold solder joints on hand-soldered components likethe BNC coax connector and DIP switches. Some or all of these componentsmay need to have overly-long leads trimmed to prevent interference withadjacent cards or connectors.<P>Finally, the Arcnet address switches on the back of the board are labelledincorrectly in the manual (or on the board, depending on how you look atit). At least some A2060's have a sticker stuck onto the DIP switch, whichmay disagree with both other references. Ignore all of these: the correctlayout is described in the Switches section below. (Assign Arcnet ID numbersstarting with 254 and decreasing from there. This will provide a slightperformance increase due to Arcnet's token-passing setup.)<P>Despite all the problems, the A2060 works quite well once the bugs arecorrected.<P>Board Layout<P><TT>  _________________________________________________________________</TT><BR><TT> |        _________                 ...                           |___</TT><BR><TT> |       |   ROM   |                LED                           |</TT><BR><TT> |       |_________|                                 ______       |</TT><BR><TT> |                                                  |      |      |</TT><BR><TT> |                                                  |      |  Bit0#</TT><BR><TT> |                                                  |Hybrid|   .  # Arcnet</TT><BR><TT> |                                                  |      |   .  # Node ID</TT><BR><TT> |                       (Hybrid version number is  |      |   .  # Switches</TT><BR><TT> |                        labelled on the back side |      |  Bit7#</TT><BR><TT> |                        of the potted "chip.")    |______|      |_</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |_| BNC</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |</TT><BR><TT> |_________________________________________________________________|</TT><BR><TT>     |||||||||||||||||||||||||||                                  |</TT><BR> <P>Jumpers<P><TT>    LED: Access LED.
