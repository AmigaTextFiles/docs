CD-ROM Mounting Problems</H4>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>CD-ROMs mounted internally stick out from the front of the case. The
internal mounting depth for 5-1/4 devices is pretty limited, so it's not
unusual for the CD drive to stick out from the front of the case. Heat
or cable problems can be caused by putting the end of the drive too close
to the power supply. Some smaller CD-ROM drives work, notably the Toshiba
XM5701B. It may be preferable to mount these drives externally.

<P>Notes on CDROM drive Installation by Willem Schaaij

<P>Some types or brands of CDROM drives are physically somewhat too long.
This could lead to a malfunction of the CDROM drive when a hard disk is
also placed in the lower part of the Rear Drive Bay (or when a second hard
disk is placed in the lower part of it).&nbsp; The power connectors of
these drives could then mechanically interfere with each other and physical
strain of the connectors, cables, or boards could cause one or both drives
to malfunction after some time.

<P>Solution: First, inspect both power connectors and remove any heightenings
on them with a hobby-knife, on the sides where the connectors could hit
each other. Second, place small and thin pieces of cardboard or soft pvc
(1.5 to 2mm) under both ends of the Front Bay, between the bottom of the
case and the Front Bay.&nbsp; The Front Bay will then be lifted somewhat
on the back and will then give more room to both connectors.
