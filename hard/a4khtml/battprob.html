Battery Problems</H4>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Battery (BT176) is "furry." Batteries can actually leak and destroy
part of the motherboard, so replacement of corroded batteries is advised.
<A HREF="dalco.html">Dalco</A>'s 3.6V 3-pin battery, part #46875, is an
almost-identical part: the pins and size are identical, but it is rated
for 60 mAH rather than the A4000 stock battery's 40 mAH. Later A4000s have
a different type of battery, a flat "coin" cell.&nbsp; These later "cost
reduced" A4000 models also have an external battery connector at the front
left of the motherboard, which should take a 3.6V replacement battery with
a wired connector. Correct operation would probably require removal of
the original motherboard battery.&nbsp; The connector:
