Because of the A2091's highavailability, it is often found in A4000s, even though it performs slowlyin them.<P>The A2091 can't use DMA to transfer data to 32-bit Fast RAM, and ifZorro-II DMA memory is not available, the driver falls back to programmedI/O transfers. In either case, this makes for extremely slow disk transfers(at worst, 50K/second; at best, no more than 1M/second). There are utilitiesin the "hard" directory of Aminet that may help alleviate this problem.(Side note: with some of these, adding some memory on the A2091 may helpby providing Zorro-II DMA-accessible memory for buffering.)<P>ROM revisions are a common problem with the A2091; 6.6 or later ROMsare desirable, with 7.0 being the last version (strongly recommended, andnecessary for 68040 machines). Most A2091s have revision 04 of the WesternDigital 33C93 SCSI controller chip; replacing this with the 08 versionmay clear up SCSI bus problems. (Despite common belief, the "PROTO" markingis insignificant on either version of the WD chip; version 04 or version08 are the only significant values.)<P>Sixteen sockets allow for the addition of up to 2M of 16-bit Fast RAM,using CMOS 256K x 4 DRAMs (44C256) rated at 120 ns or faster. (This isnot normally very useful on the A4000, since a SIMM added to the motherboardRAM sockets is simpler to obtain and install, and will operate *much* morequickly. However, it can be useful to provide memory available to the harddrive controller on the 2091, allowing for better speed as explained above.)<P>The hard drive power connector on the board is not a reliable way topower a card-mounted hard drive. Use the connectors attached directly tothe power supply instead.<P>Usually looked on as a cheap (sometimes very cheap) way to access SCSIperipherals from the A4000, the A2091 is certainly better than no SCSIcontroller at all.<P>A little-known and mostly-unused function of the A2091 is a built-inXT-IDE controller. The IDE connector and LED are not installed, but visibleon the board to the left and upper-right of the SCSI chip. Unfortunately,this port will only work with 8-bit (XT) IDE hard drives, not the common16-bit AT-IDE hard drives. This option was apparently mostly used for the20M drives supplied with the A590, the A500 hard disk option which sharedthe 2091 design.<P>Board Layout<BR><TT>  _________________________________________________________________</TT><BR><TT> | DRAM   _________  ::Memory       ...                           |___</TT><BR><TT> | ||||  | Odd ROM | ::Size         LED                           |</TT><BR><TT> | ||||  |_________|          ::                                  |</TT><BR><TT> |        _________        :: ::                                  |#</TT><BR><TT> | ||||  |Even ROM |       :: :: 50-Pin SCSI                      |# External</TT><BR><TT> | ||||  |_________|   Options:: Connector                        |# SCSI</TT><BR><TT> |                            ::                                  |# Port</TT><BR><TT> | ||||                       ::                                  |# (DB25)</TT><BR><TT> | ||||                       ::                                  |#</TT><BR><TT> |                            ::                                  |</TT><BR><TT> | ||||                        .
