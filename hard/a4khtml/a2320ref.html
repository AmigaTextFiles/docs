It is essentially the motherboard deinterlacer circuitry from theA3000 on a board. Based on the Amber chip used in the A3000, the boardis often referred to as the Amber board. Physically, the board is builtto fit into the video slot of an A2000. Electronically, it works fine inan A4000.<P>Why would you need a separate deinterlacer board when the A4000 alreadyhas AGA circuitry that can scan-double? If you have a VGA or multisyncmonitor, there are two main reasons:<UL><LI>Not all programs can be mode-promoted to "double" screens through software(games, for instance). The Amber board will scan-double all 15.75 kHz screens.</LI><LI>The AGA "double" modes are not truly double in frequency. A 640x200 "doubled"screen syncs at about 27.5 kHz, not the 31.5 kHz that you'd expect. Somemultisync monitors can't sync this low. With an Amber board, the outputis 31.5 kHz, the same as "stock" VGA.</LI></UL>Physical Mounting<P>A modified "slot cover" can be attached to the back panel of the Amberboard to allow it to be mounted securely in an A4000 slot. You'll alsoneed to trim a bit off the "top" of the Amber's metal panel to allow clearancefor the A4000 case (a nibbling tool is useful here). The board will onlyfill part of A4000 video slot; it looks funny this way, but it works.<P>Don't remove the enable/disable switch! The Amber gets confused by someof the "doubled" screen modes, and rather than passing them through, triesto double them to 55 kHz or above! On these modes, you'll need the disableswitch to force the board to pass the video through. (Productivity modeis passed through correctly, since it was part of the ECS chip set thatwas around when the Amber board first came out.)<P>Disadvantages<P>The Amber board was designed before AGA came out, and doesn't reallyunderstand AGA. As noted above, some modes are not passed through properlyunless the board is disabled with the switch. According to Scott Hood,the designer of the A2320, it samples 12 bits for each color. On the A4000,this is the upper 12 bits of the 24-bit AGA information. So AGA screenswith more than 32 colors or HAM-6 will have the colors quantized to a certaindegree. This hasn't been a problem so far, although it can be seen on thingslike ImageFX preview screens. Games that use the AGA color abilities butdon't allow for promoting their screens to doubled modes are the only likelysources for this trouble.<BR><HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
