It maycontain a 68030, 68EC030 (functionally equivalent to the 68030 but withouta memory management unit), or even a 68020 processor. The 68020 optionwas apparently for an extremely low-cost version of the A4000; it is unlikelythat any boards using the 68020 were ever sold. A possible cost-reducedvariation of this processor board has no jumpers. This type of board hasa PLCC socket for the math coprocessor, which runs at the same speed asthe processor.
