It spins on ball bearings insteadof a bushing, so life expectancy is claimed to be 50,000 hours insteadof the ordinary bushing fan's 5000 hours. A disk-drive power connectorpowers the fan. Finally, it's only .6 inches high, no more than the heatsink that comes with the A3640 processor board. PC Power &amp; Coolingcalls it by several names; the best one to use is the "PENTA-COOL 54" forthe 90 MHz Pentium or the "CPU-COOL 1.9."<P>Some earlier versions of the fan had "corners" cast into the aluminumheat sink to better fit the 486; these versions don't fit the 68040 withoutmodification, so ask for either of the versions above, or make sure theyknow that the one you're purchasing must be of the flat variety.<P>In the United States, you can usually save a few dollars by orderingthese fans from large mail-order companies like PC Connection, but pleasemake sure of the model and brand first.<P>PC Power &amp; Cooling<BR>5995 Avenida Encinas<BR>Carlsbad CA 92008<BR>(800) 722-6555<BR>(619) 931-6988 Fax&nbsp;<HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
