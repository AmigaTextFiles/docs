These cables had wires 3-5 twisted, instead of wires 4-6. Thesecables will work fine for a single drive, but will not properly connecta second drive. To use two drives that are both jumpered as DS0, the floppycable should have both wires 4-6 and 10-12 twisted. A cable with only wires4-6 twisted will require the drives to be jumpered as DS0 and DS1.<P>An improperly-wired or failing floppy cable can cause a high-densitydrive to only work with double-density disks.<P>Pin-outs for the internal floppy connector are shown in Internals/ConnectorPin-Outs/<A HREF="inflpins.html">Internal Floppy Connector Pin-Outs</A>.<BR><HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
