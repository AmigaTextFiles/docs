Both BNC (coax) and DB15 (AUI) connectors are provided. Whilethe A2065 hasn't been produced for some time, it's still the most commonEthernet board found in Zorro-bus Amigas.<P>Ethernet Configurations<P>10Base-2 (coax cable, or "thin net") and 10Base-T (twisted pair) arenow the most common variations of Ethernet.<P>Thin Net (10Base-2, or coax)<P>The coaxial cable variant of Ethernet uses a bus arrangement, wherea "t-connector" is attached to the BNC connector of the Ethernet board,and RG58 coaxial cable is connected to the two BNC connectors on it. (Notethat "stub" extension cables between the t-connector and the card are *not*allowed.) At the ends of the bus, 50-ohm terminating resistors are installedon the unused BNC connectors of the t-connector.<P>Twisted Pair (10Base-T)<P>Twisted-pair Ethernet uses two pairs of Category 3 (or higher) twisted-pair wire, although the wire usually used actually contains four pairs.Eight-conductor RJ45 phone-type connectors are used (the actual pins connectedare 1,2,3 and 6). Topologically, 10Base-T uses a star arrangement, wherewire is run between each workstation and a "concentrator," or hub. Twocards can be directly connected with a "null- modem" version of the standardcable, in which the pairs are swapped (1-2 connect to 3-6, and 3-6 connectto 1-2).<P>While the A2065 does not directly support 10Base-T, inexpensive transceiversare available to plug into the AUI port.<P>Board Address<P>The firmware Ethernet address of the A2065 can be determined by takingthe registered CBM block number (00-80-10) and appending the hex valueshown on the sticker on chip U4.<P>Board Layout<P><TT>  _________________________________________________________________</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |___</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |_</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |_| BNC</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |</TT><BR><TT> |                                             JP7       ABC      |_</TT><BR><TT> |                                             :         ABC      | |</TT><BR><TT> |                                                       ABC      | | AUI</TT><BR><TT> |           JP1-JP6                                              | |</TT><BR><TT> |           ::::::                                               |_|</TT><BR><TT> |                                                                |</TT><BR><TT> |_________________________________________________________________|</TT><BR><TT>     |||||||||||||||||||||||||||                                  |</TT><P>Jumpers<P><TT>  JP1-JP6: Interrupt (default is JP2).</TT><P><TT>  JP7: Ethernet Type</TT><BR><TT>    Off: Type 1.</TT><BR><TT>     On: Type 2 (default).</TT><P><TT>  ABC Jumpers: Select Thick/Thin Ethernet.</TT><BR><TT>    AB: Select BNC connector (thin Ethernet).</TT><BR><TT>    BC: Select AUI connector (thick Ethernet).</TT><BR><HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
