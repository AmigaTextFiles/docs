Speeding Up IDE Boot-Up</H4>

<HR>

<P>Even when an A4000 is configured without one, the system will still
look for an IDE hard drive on power-up or reset. To allow IDE drives time
to spin up, there is a long search built into the 3.0 ROMs, and an even
longer one in the 3.1 ROMs (about 30 seconds). A BattMem bit to disable
the extra delay with 3.1 ROMs has been reported and finally confirmed,
but it enables or disables an <I>additional</I> eight seconds of the wait,
and defaults to off. With software, it is possible to remove the delay
between resets, but not on power-up (Matthew Frost's "NoIDE" program is
available from the disk/misc directory of Aminet).

<P>The only currently-known way to completely disable this delay is by
obtaining a small piece of hardware (the circuit is courtesy of Sean Riddle;
the instructions are mine, so errors are entirely my fault). With this
"IDE ignorer," the search for IDE drives is skipped altogether.&nbsp; You
can follow the instructions here to build one, or buy a prebuilt version
from <A HREF="redmcabl.html">Redmond Cable</A> (part number is "40socket-term").

<P>Parts Required

<P>two 4.7K resistors
<BR>40-pin crimp-on IDC connector
<BR>male-to-male 40-pin header (see below)

<P>Procedure: The two resistors are connected between pin 39 and pin 3,
and pin 39 and pin 5 (the effect is to tie IDE data bits 7 and 6 high).
Rather than using a piece of whole 40-conductor ribbon cable, I stripped
short pieces of individual conductors from one and used fine needle-nose
pliers to press these wires into the contacts for pins 3, 5, and 39. Then
the crimp-on cover was clipped on top of these.

<P>Since the relevant pins are at either end of the connector, I ran the
resistors flat along the side of the connector, using heat-shrink tubing
and tape to insulate the leads. The only 40-pin male-to-male header I had
didn't have pins long enough to make contact with both connectors, so I
just cut three pins off a wire-wrap socket and stuck them in the connectors
at pin locations 3, 5, and 39. Physically, this seems to be strong enough
to hold the two connectors together.
