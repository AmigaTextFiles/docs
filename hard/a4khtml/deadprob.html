Dead Machine Problems</H4>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>A4000 does nothing on power-up; keyboard light, power light, and hard
drive spin-up show that power supply is working, but screen is gray or
black, and disk drive doesn't click.

<P>Possible cause: the processor board is not firmly connected to the mother
board, or has worked its way loose (the power LED may flash quickly in
this situation). Reseat the connector strip that is parallel to the floppy
drive. Since this connector is quite long, it is possible for the ends
to be firmly attached while the center is not making adequate contact.
Be careful not to flex either board too much while reconnecting them; using
a large rubber eraser or other flat object will protect your fingers while
pressing the boards together gently. In extreme cases, it may be necessary
to use a contact cleaner to clean accumulated gunk (like silicon heatsink
compound) from the connectors.

<P>Possible cause: expansion cards not inserted fully or properly. Remove
and reinstall.

<P>Possible cause: the motherboard is not supported very well near the
internal IDE connector. Solution: gently lift the motherboard near this
connector. Installing an insulating support underneath the motherboard
near here will be a more permanent solution.

<P>Possible cause: badly-trimmed pins of the soldered power supply connector
have poked through the insulating plastic under the motherboard and shorted
to the case. Solution: trim the pins and install more insulating plastic.

<P>Possible cause: overheating caused by <A HREF="fanprob.html">fan failure</A>.

<P>Possible cause: power supply failure. A company called Micro R&amp;D
repairs and upgrades power supplies. Contact them at:
