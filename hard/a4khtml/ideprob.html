Solution: set MaxTransfer for every partition on the harddrive to 0x0001FE00, or 128K. Older IDE drives may even require settingMaxTransfer to 0x0000FFFF, or 64K. It's even possible that some newer drivesmay need a setting of 0x0000FE00. This problem is due to the way some IDEhard drives respond to requests for large blocks of data. (Note that MaxTransferis <B><I>NOT</I></B> "maximum transfer rate," but rather "Maximum TransferSize.")<P>Some IDE drives may not be consistently ready on powerup; this can causethe A4000 to fail to boot. The machine may just sit there with the drivelight on or off, or it may come up with the purple "Insert Floppy" screen.The <A HREF="st3144.html">Seagate ST3144A</A> drives do this once in awhile; you may hear a clicking as the drive does its self-test then decidesit's not up to booting today. It may work after a reset, or may requirea power-down to revive it. This problem may occur more often with a master-slavedrive setup.<BR><HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
