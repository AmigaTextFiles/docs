A4000s show some faint verticalbands on the display. There is a modification to prevent this, but, likeanything else, it has advantages and disadvantages.<P>Advantages<UL><LI>Removes vertical bands from display.</LI><LI>Simple modification.</LI><LI>Relatively easy to disable.</LI></UL>Disadvantages<UL><LI>Interferes with operation of attached genlocks and deinterlacer boardslike the Amber A2320 board (see Boards/<A HREF="a2320re.html">A2320 'Amber'Reference</A>).</LI></UL>The modification involves connecting pin 15 of the video port connectorthrough a 100 ohm, 1/4 watt resistor to ground. This can be done insidethe A4000, but it's safer and more versatile if the modification is performedon the DB23-to-HDD15 adapter that was included with the A4000. That waythe adapter can be unplugged from the machine if a genlock or Amber boardis to be used.<P>There are two grounds on the adapter PC board: shield ground and videoground (pins 16-20). Since all the other components on the board use thevideo ground, it seems reasonable to use it for this modification, ratherthan the more-easily-reached shield ground. The resistor fits nicely onthe bottom of the adapter PC board, running from pin 15 to pin 18 of theconnector's soldered pins. &nbsp;<HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
