<P>Extremely large selection of connectors, cables (including the relatively
rare SCSI-2 and 2.5-inch IDE hard disk varieties), and pretty much everything
in the way of computer assemblies. Oriented towards computer end-users.
They will custom-build cables. Service is good, prices are excellent, and
their catalog is filled with basically neat stuff.
