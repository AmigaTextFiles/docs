Check for revision of SuperBuster; the revision 9 chip had problems with Zorro-3 bus arbitration.Revision 11 of the Super Buster fixed this problem. Note that this problemis not due to DMA transfers, but Zorro-3 bus arbitration, so it is possibleto see it with any Zorro-3 board.<P>Problems may be encountered with the <A HREF="a2091ref.html">A2091</A>or GVP Series II SCSI controller boards. To isolate this problem, checkdisk transfers to Chip RAM with a program like Diskspeed 4.2. This problemcan be fixed by replacing PAL U209 on the <A HREF="a3640ref.html">A3640</A>daughterboard with a revision 3 version.<P>There can be a software component to these problems, also. Check thatlibs:68040.library is at least version 37.30. Note that due to the waythe library version numbers are handled, version 37.4 is an earlier version.The later 37.30 library correctly handles Zorro-3 transfers and mappingof Zorro-3 boards (for instance, Commodore's SCSI drivers require thatcopyback caching be disabled during DMA, and this version of the librarydoes that). &nbsp;<HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
