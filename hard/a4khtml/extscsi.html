Split the 50-pin SCSI ribbon cable connectors back a coupleof inches. Start with pin 1, lay it in the crimp-on pins at the upper leftof the connector (again, viewed from the back of the connector). By placingthe two sides of a small pair of needle-nose pliers on the wire on eitherside of the crimp pins, you can gently force the wire down into the V-shapedgap between them. Locate wire #2, then use the same procedure to connectit to the other side of the connector. Repeat for all 50 wires, then clipthe plastic retaining clips onto the connector and give it a final squeezeto make sure all wires are making contact.<P>You can cut a hole in the A4000's Expansion port cover on the back ofthe machine to hold this new connector (a "nibbling" tool works well forthis).<P>Don't forget proper SCSI termination: the devices at both ends of thechain should be terminated. If the internal SCSI cable leads from the controllerto an internal drive, and then to this connector, the internal drive mustbe unterminated for this port to be functional. When used in this configuration,the external device plugged into this port needs to be terminated. Half-pitchterminators are available from <A HREF="dalco.html">Dalco</A>; using oneof these would allow you to operate the A4000 with or without an externalSCSI device without having to open up the computer to change termination.<BR><HR><A HREF="main.html">[Main]</A></BODY></HTML>
