<P>Introduction From The <A HREF="editor.html">Editor</A>

<P>The Amiga 4000 Hardware Guide was compiled from online messages posted
by many different folks, various hints and tips that have been sent directly
by helpful folks, stuff I've collected elsewhere, and from my own experiences
with the 4000, so it is by no means complete. Corrections or additions
are welcomed.

<P>The purpose of the guide is to help make A4000 troubleshooting easier
by gathering all kinds of Amiga 4000 hardware information into a concise,
easy-to-use format.

<P>This guide is specifically for the Amiga 4000; however, at the prompting
of several other individuals, I've compiled a short <A HREF="../A1200HardFAQ.txt">A1200
Hardware FAQ</A> to address those same old questions I see popping up in
c.s.a.hardware all the time. Both are available in the hard/misc directory
of Aminet.

<P>All of the people who have contributed are listed under <A HREF="credits.html">Credits</A>.
I can't thank them enough! At this point in time, information of this type
can be very valuable in keeping A4000 systems alive and running, and they
have been gracious enough to freely share this information with everyone.

<P>Comments on this document should be addressed to the <A HREF="editor.html">Editor</A>.
