AvailCIA V1.0 by Chris Hodges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a small CLI-Tool, which lets you know, which CIA-Timers are
still free and which aren't. Your Amiga only has four of them (two in
each cia-chip), so it's useful to know about the timers as you easy
can run out of them! AvailCIA can be used to find out, which programs
use CIA-Timer. Optionally, you can check a specific timer for
availability.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
AvailCIA needs Kick 2.04 or higher.

Usage
~~~~~
AvailCIA [CIAA] [CIAB] [TIMERA] [TIMERB] [QUIET]

Non of these arguments are required. If CIAA or CIAB is not
specified, both CIAs are checked, otherwise only CIAA or CIAB. Same
for TIMERA and TIMERB.

Has no free timer been found, an errorcode of 5 will be returned. The
QUIET option is only useful in scripts as no output is generated
using this option.

History
~~~~~~~
V1.0 (23-Aug-94): First and only release.
