After putting my 1200 in a Power Tower, I thought it would
be cool to have the floppy LED right on the floppy drive
faceplate.

The drive I performed this on was a Panasonic floppy drive
from the Commodore era.

Unplug your computer and take out the floppy drive.

Disable the floppy light from the special Power Tower LED
board, so that the floppy activity doesn't flash the HDD LED
(see your Power Tower instructions for further details.)

Try to use the smallest, flattest, green LED you can find. I
got mine in a mixed pack of 20 LEDs from Radio Shack.

Remove the top metal drive shield. Take a good look at
how everything is placed, paying particular attention
to the slide rails and slide washers of the metal guard
remove the top part of the guard. This can be
done by removing the plastic eject button and pushing back
on the bottom metal guard (like you're ejecting a disk). The
top guard should easily slide up and out from the drive.
WATCH OUT FOR FOUR SLIDE WASHERS ON THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE
GUARD!

On the PCB inside the drive there is a diode symbol printed
on the board, looking down on the drive, near the front of
the drive corresponding to the LED window on the faceplate.
Moving inward, there are two holes in the board and yet
further in there are 3 solder pads, two big ones surrounding
a smaller one.

|    # | #     <---- 3 solder pads (# = big, | = little)
|
|     · ·      <---- 2 holes
|
|    -|>|-     <---- diode symbol
-------------//
    (front of
     drive)

Take your LED and clip the leads such that, with the LED
lying flat on the board, the ends of the leads
terminate directly on the two big pads. Solder these in
place.

Put everything back together, test it, and you're done.
