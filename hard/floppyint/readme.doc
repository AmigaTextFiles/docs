  As promised on c.s.a.hardware, here is my digitized
schematic for attaching up to two external IBM PC style 720K
disk drives to your Amiga.

  I drew this up way back in 1986.  I never built it but a
friend borrowed my drawing and built it up for his A500.  He
reported that the drive he used had the Ready and Disk
Change signals on different pins.  Beware!  Check your drive
pinouts first and make any modifications necessary.

  I have included two different versions of the scanned
file.  The first file, Floppy2.PCX, is the raw scanned file
right out of the HP Scan Jet Plus.  The second file,
Floppy2.IFF is the above file that was converted to IFF
format.

  Good luck!
