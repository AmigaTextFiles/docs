Introduction
------------

These are simple instructions for converting a three-button LogiTech Bus Mouse
("Bus MouseMan", part number M-PD13-9MD) into an Amiga mouse.  This type of
LogiTech mouse does not contain any "intelligence", relying instead on a IBM PC/AT
ISA Bus card to convert raw mouse presses and movement into system events.  This
is fortunate, since the Amiga expects to see just this kind of raw activity from
its mice.

---------
Procedure
---------

All that is required for the modification is to cut off the round plug of the
LogiTech mouse, and replace it with a female DB9 plug (with shell)
suitable for the Amiga's game port.  Connect the wires to the DB9 plug as
described in the following table:

---------------------------------------------------
Wire Function      Wire Color     DB9 connector pin
---------------------------------------------------

Left button          Green               6
Middle button        purple              5
Right button         grey                9
+5 VDC               black               7
Shield                 -            metal plug body
Ground               white               8
Horizontal-Q         red                 4
Horizontal           brown               2
Vertical             orange              1
Vertical-Q           yellow              3

Suggestions
-----------

Double-check that variations in mouse cables may not result in the power wires
(+5 VDC and Ground) differing from those in the above table.  The circuit board
in the mouse has a 74HC14 chip on it, so this chip's corner power pins can be
used to verify that the power wires are correct:

   (14: +5 VDC)    (8)
    ----------------
   |     74HC14     |
   |*               |
    ----------------
   (1)             (7: Ground)

Attach a sticker with the word "AMIGA" to the DIN plug's shell, in case it may
be mistaken for a PC/AT serial mouse.

The mouse cord wires must be stripped carefully.  They are very thin, and their
stranding is easily damaged if nicked during stripping.

The Middle Button
-----------------

There are a number of utilities in Aminet (http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/)
for handling the middle mouse button.  As well, the middle button will display
a popup window in the AWeb V3.1 web browser.
