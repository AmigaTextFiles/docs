                    New Ideas For ADCs For WinUAE/AF????.
                    -------------------------------------

1) The Mouse Counters...
------------------------

Here is a crazy idea for slow Analogue To Digital Conveter(s) using the
Mouse Horizontal and/or Vertical counters as the input(s)... ;-)

NOTE: I have NOT tried this yet, but I have now put it onto AMINET hoping
that someone else might take up the idea and experiment with it.

Most PCs can use more than one mouse at the same time, especially USB types.

Why not modify an second old or very cheap USB mouse to accept an LF Audio
VCO, (Voltage Controlled Oscillator), into one of the counters, or two VCOs
into both counters, for use with WinUAE. The pointer position will need
to be saved and hidden before the ADC reading process and both re-enabled
again after each ADC read too.

The VCO can be a simple very cheap DC controlled astable multivibrator
using standard transistors. It's not very stable but it's easy to do basic
idea testing with, and the parts can be obtained from the 'junk box'.
There is however a Precision Audio VCO IC, type LM331, that will do a good
enough job of converting V to F, (Voltage to Frequency), for this idea and
is also very cheap.

I have no idea whether this zany idea will work or not, but hey, it could
be worth a try and give WinUAE something NEW to add to its credentials.

To make it even more difficult why not make the VCO idea backwards
compatible with Classic AMIGAs too, so that the same SW works on real AMIGAs
AND under WinUAE emulation much like my 'WinUAE-ADC.lha' archive does.

This idea is GPL, but, (C)2008, B.Walker, G0LCU.

2) Arduino Diecimila:-
----------------------

This is a pre-built, very cheap, USB to MPU development board assembly.
It has 'RS232' style serial I/O from the computer to the MPU via USB.
When installed to a Windows OS PC it presents a 'COM' port number to the
system and can be utilised by WinUAE VERY easily. The board can be
programmed via the Windows platform and can be used via the WinUAE platform.

                            <http://arduino.cc/>

The Arduino Diecimila has:-
---------------------------
6 off 10 bit Analogue to Digital Converters.
12, (14), off digital I/O pins.
3 of the digital I/O pins can be used as 8 bit, PWM, Digital to Analogue
Converters.

It is powered from either an external source or from the USB port, jumper
selectable.

I have already uploaded a very simple, slow, single channel ADC for WinUAE
using this board as an example, to show that this is easily possible...

3) Velleman K8055, USB Development Board:-
------------------------------------------

This is a kit of a multi-I/O board using standard components and uses a
USB slot. It CAN be built on the kitchen table with ease.

The K8055 has:-
---------------
5 off digital inputs.
8 off digital outputs.
2 off 8 bit Analogue to Digital Converters.
2 off PWM, 8 bit, Digital to Analogue Converters, filtered AND unfilterd.

It is primarily for use under a Windows environment but there is/are
code for use under Linux. There is a possibility that this board may work
on REAL AMIGAs with a USB port. This includes WinUAE but this may be very
difficult to implement.

                       <http://www.velleman-kit.com>

I have NOT tried to get idea working at all...
I had thought of creating a classic AMIGA games port I/O port using this
development board however.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often difficult problems...

For example using the PCs 'sound card' record inputs as inputs for the VCO
style Analogue to Digital Conversion using AHI??? The VCO hardware could
be the same as the Mouse Counter(s) method above but would use the Stereo
Line/Mic Input(s) instead of the mouse counters... ;-)

  Acknowledgements:-
  ------------------

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

All the guys and gals that have developed WinUAE, this gives we real AMIGA
lovers the feel and friendliness of the AMIGA environment using modern
gear. Thanks guys and gals.

If it wasn't for a guy called Kulwant Bhogal this upload would not have
reached AMINET as my A1200 keyboard failed drastically and Kulwant supplied
me with a replacement FOC and at his own expense. Many thanks matey you
have not been forgotten... :)

Also to Anthony Hoffman who always keeps me on my toes by finding many of
my silly mistakes and adding a few ideas of his own.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
