   These Are Some Ideas For The Analogue To Digital Converter For WinUAE.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1)  For single core PCs WITH an analogue PC Games Port download......

    <http://main.aminet.net/docs/hard/WinUAE-ADC.lha>

    ......from AMINET.

 2) Use the same for single core PCs and an external USB-Games Port
    adaptor, it should, and does, work reasonably well. :)

 3) Multicore machines have now broken the working of the above idea, so
    try running the PC in single core mode by doing the following inside
    Windows XP:-

    A) Click the Start button.
    B) Choose Run...
    C) Type in msconfig and run it...
    D) Click the BOOT.INI tag.
    E) Click the Advanced Options...
    F) Tick the /numproc= box.
    G) Set it to 1.
    H) OK it.
    I) Apply it.
    J) Reboot the Windows XP machine.
    K) Add a USB-Games Port adaptor IF required and set it up.
    L) Run WinUAE/AF????
    M) Try out the above archive.
    N) It might be tricky to set up and I cannot guarantee that it will
       work. Good luck...

 (NOTE, I think this sequence of events is exactly the same for MS Vista.)

 4) Now go to the New-Ideas file for some fresh approaches for an Analogue
    To Digital Converter for use with WinUAE... :)

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

All the guys and gals that have developed WinUAE, this gives we real AMIGA
lovers the feel and friendliness of the AMIGA environment using modern
gear. Thanks guys and gals.

If it wasn't for a guy called Kulwant Bhogal this upload would not have
reached AMINET as my A1200 keyboard failed drastically and Kulwant supplied
me with a replacement FOC and at his own expense. Many thanks matey you
have not been forgotten... :)

Also to Anthony Hoffman who always keeps me on my toes by finding many of
my silly mistakes and adding a few ideas of his own.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
