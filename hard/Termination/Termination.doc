 HOW TO CORRECTLY SET UP A SCSI TERMINATION


 The termination must be connected on the first AND on the last 
 scsi device.


 Term.                UnTerm.              Term.

 Controller --------- [n] Device --------- Last Device




 Example:


 Term.                UnTerm.         Term.

 Controller --------- Cd-Rom -------- HardDisk



 Only one exception is allowed:


 If you have an internal and an external scsi chain, you can leave the
 internal chain unterminated if the chain is shorter than 10 cm.
  
 

 Example:


 Internal Chain                  External Chain


 UnTerm.   8cm   Term.            UnTerm.              Term.

 HardDisk ------ Controller ----- Cd-Rom ------ HardDisk



 Different combinations may work, but is better if your scsi chain
 works following the scsi standard.

 The need of an extra termination is a symptom of a bad scsi chain...
 Better you substitute your old scsi devices with new ones.






 SOME OTHER SCSI TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS


 The maximum length of a SCSI chain is 6 meters.
 


 If you want to have a T ramification you should follow some rules:

                         min 30cm

                 |------------------------------|
                         

 Cable ----------T------------------------------T-------------....
                 | -                            |
                 | |                            |
                 | | 10 cm max                  |
                 | |                            |
                 | |                            |
                 | -                            |
               Device                         Device




 The minimum distance between two parts of the main cable is 1.27mm
 (OkOk...it may also work if you leave only 1.26266267 mm :-) )


 Example:


 Cable -----------------+ min  +---------- .....
                        | 1.27 |
                        | mm   |
                        |      |
                        +------+
                     
                      
 The impendance of the cable must be between 90ohm AND 140ohm,
 better if is 132ohm.

 
 Don't connect cables with different impendances. 



 A little note: Controller isn't the right term, 
                better you use Host Adapter.
