<title>MAC DOS Card Mailing List: Re: 9-pin D shell PC to 8-pin min-DIN Mac serial cable adapter</title>

<p>this document to help amiga users to connect to Macintosh computers and transfer 

  large files without playing the floppy disk jockey, it has been originally written 

  for PC users, it should work fine on Amiga computers since the RS-232 serial 

  port is exactly the same (as far as I know)</p>

<p>*** TURN OFF COMPUTERS BEFORE CONNECTING NULL-MODEM CABLE, now you are warned 

  ! ***</p>

<p>once you build the cable described below, use a &quot;terminal&quot; program 

  on both computers </p>

<p>TERM on amiga or any other aminet equivalent<br>

  Zterm on Mac (http://cnet.com/Resources/Software/Selections/Maccomm/zterm.html) 

  or OLITEC's &quot;OLICOM&quot; (www.olitec.com)<br>

  Hyperterminal, embedded in win95/98 (select install windows parts from control 

  panel then choose communication parts)</p>

<p>launch the term softwares on both computers and choose a REASONABLE speed (especially 

  for your s l o w Amiga)<br>

  38400 worked fine with my accelerated Amiga 1200 a long time ago</p>

<p>connection settings : <br>

  speed : 38400 <br>

  partity : NONE<br>

  stop bit : 1 (aka 8 N 1)</p>

<p>once you have the link working try to increase the speed (keep an eye on error 

  corrections ratio)</p>

<p>protocol/flow control/handshake : RTS/CTS (sometimes called hardware handshake)</p>

<p>USES THOSE SETTINGS ON BOTH COMPUTERS got it ? RELAUNCH term's if necessary</p>

<p>I use a VT100 terminal window if possible</p>

<p>once connected I transfer filez with ZMODEM protocol, it is a fast and efficient 

  one</p>

<p>&quot;send&quot; one the mac and &quot;receive&quot; on the Amiga</p>

<p>hope this helps</p>

<p> <i>&gt;So, who's connected a 9-pin (or 25-pin) PC serial cable to their Mac</i><br>

<i>&gt;through the 8-pin mini-DIN serial port?  I've got a TI PS-6555 personal</i><br>

<i>&gt;organizer with Windows software and a base unit that has a 9-pin connector.</i><br>

<i>&gt; No Mac serial port cable option, of course.  Where can I get one or does</i><br>

<i>&gt;anybody already have pinout information?  This particular device only has 5</i><br>

<i>&gt;pins (5 metal stubs on the base unit).</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;Thanks!</i><br>

I am not sure exactly what you are trying to do, but I have connected Mac<br>

to PC serial ports for direct connect game playing. I guess you could use<br>

it for copying files also. The null modem connection for games can be done<br>

with:<br>

<p>

1. Mac modem cable<br>

2. Gender changer<br>

3. PC null modem cable<br>

<p>

You can buy these at general electronic stores.<br>

<p>

<p>

Alternatively you can build your own cable. I got this info from John<br>

Federico through a newsgroup:<br>

<p>

QUOTE<br>

<p>

Parts:<br>

(1) Macintosh Serial Cable<br>

(1) length of 4-wire phone cable (as long as you want) (1) DIN-9 Female<br>

connector (Radio Shack #276-1538) (1) D-SUB hood for DIN-9 (it's the<br>

casing) (RS #276-1539) (1) flashlight bulb, battery &amp; wire<br>

<p>

<p>

Assembly:<br>

Step 1: Cut the Mac Serial cable, and strip the ends of the 8 wires.<br>

Use the flashlight bulb and battery to figure out which wire goes to which<br>

pin on the connector. (Hey, it works!). Remember which color goes to<br>

which pin.<br>

(As far as I could tell, the mac serial cable is a null modem cable. Not<br>

all the wires in the cable are connected to the same pins on both ends.)<br>

<p>

Step 2: Solder the four wires in the phone cable to the DIN-9 female connector.<br>

Solder one wire to the #2 pin, one to the #3 pin, one to the #5 pin, and<br>

one to the #7 pin. Remember which color goes to which pin. (pins are<br>

labeled on connector)<br>

<p>

Step 3: Assemble the casing around the DIN-9 female connector.<br>

<p>

Step 4: Attach the 4 phone wires to the 4 respective Mac serial wires. They need<br>

to be connected so that the following pins are hooked together.<br>

<p>&nbsp; 
<p>Mac Serial Pin# IBM Serial Pin#<br>
  --------------- ---------------<br>
  1 ------------------------- 7<br>
<p>

3 ------------------------- 2<br>

<p>

4 ------------------------- 5<br>

<p> 5 ------------------------- 3
<p>Step 5: Attach the cable between the two computers and you're ready to go.<br>
<p>

<p>

I have successfully used this to transfer files between a pentium pc and a<br>

duo 280c<br>

using regular terminal software (57,600 baud). Just make sure the terminal<br>

programs have the same settings (8-N-1 &amp; 57,600 baud worked fine), and make<br>

sure<br>

local echo is enabled. Hopefully this will work with cross platform modem games.<br>

<p>

Actually, this works very well with Doom II. I am hoping to try out Havoc<br>

soon. Hope this helps.<br>

Good luck, Thomas<br>
