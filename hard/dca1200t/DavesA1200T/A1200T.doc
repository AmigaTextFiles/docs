THIS FILE IS MEANT AS A GUIDE ONLY. I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
DAMAGED CAUSED TO ANYTHING WHILST DOING THIS HACK. YOU ARE ENTIRELY ON YOUR
OWN. BUT DONT LET THAT PUT YOU OFF, I HAVE DONE THIS AND IT WORKED FOR ME.
THE A1200 WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE AN A1200T   =8-)


How do you fit an A1200 into a PC Tower Case??

After ringing up various computer suppliers, I finally found the cheapest
tower case that I could (£60) which had 6 drive bays and a 3 digit display.
If your going to be doing this, it makes a great case for all of your SCSI
hard drives, CD-ROM's, Zip Drives, etc, since the PC power supply will easily
be able to power them all.
A note of caution however, some of the PC cases have no -12 volt power which
is needed by the Amiga, so make sure FIRST that yours does.
You can get a voltage conversion chip to get -12ve from +12ve, I might be able
to help you with that, I know that you get the chips from Maplin to do this.
Give me an EMail if you get into problems....

The biggest problem seems to be the keyboard conversion, you cant just plug
in a new one like the A500, you have to start soldering to the mother board.
The guide says that you have to cut pins on the chips, but on my A1200, they
didnt need to be cut in order to work. In this case, you could use an upturned
PLCC socket, and solder on to that instead of the chip, but I didnt think of
that till after I did it. =8-) 
The included guide is quite good, and does include a pic too. Its not too bad
a job, you just need a steady hand and the nerve to have a go ;-).
You also need a keyboard from a "Big Box" Amiga, such as: A1000, A1500, A2000,
A3000, A4000, even the humble CDTV keyboard will work...
You can use an A500 keyboard, but a case will have to be sourced from 
somewhere, an old PC one might do the trick, if you dont mind the holes. 
Im sure that there must be some keyboard case that is roughly the same as the 
Amiga's.

When it comes to fitting the motherboard into the case, you will have to 
extend the leads to the back of the case. Maplin seem to supply the 23pin disk
drive and video port plugs and sockets that no-one else does, and they're not
too expensive. It does make the job look more professional.
The motherboard will have to be screwed into the case, and mounting holes may
have to be drilled through the motherboard. Just make sure that if you do this
and cut any PCB tracks, that you cut them back a bit, and solder wires to 
re-route them.
The tower case that I bought was a Full size model, and had plenty of room at
the bottom for a PCMCIA interface such as the Surf Squirrel (a damn good buy!)
but the wiring up of other SCSI drives and cables is best left to another
file which is also in the docs (I hope Anthony doesnt mind too much, but I 
found both the docs and him very useful to my tower system. Thanks!!!).

System power comes from the PC supply.
You will have to cut the power plug off of your Amiga power pack, or find a
spare, and connect it to the PC supply (See the picture for connections). 
You will have to sort this out with a multimeter yourself, as power supplies
vary. Basically, you want +5V, -12V, +12V, and GND in the right places, or
you may experience a slight smoke effect!! =8-)
This will power all your drives, the motherboard, and even the monitor using 
the mains through port. I've also got a CD-ROM drive, and SCSI HD  mounted 
in the case which will be linked up to the Surf Squirrel as soon as I get a 
SCSI cable. My US Robotics modem is 9 volts AC, but this is still attached in
the case thanks to another hack by Arto Niskanen called Modem Power which I
customised to supply 9V AC instead of 12V AC. I've ripped the LED's off the 
front of the modem, and attached them to a spare drive cover, with letters 
under each one. The speaker is now connected to the audio in on the serial 
port and is routed into my HiFi for call monitoring.

I ripped a floppy cover off an old PC and put that on the front of df0.
I also added a second floppy drive which was once an external one bought from
Power Computing and stuck that in too. 
In order to have a second internal drive, all that you have to do is this:
Get a piece of 34way ribbon cable and crimp on three 34pin IDC sockets, and
connect them up to the drive. You might have to start playing about with
power connectors if you havent got enough; take the drive to motherboard power
connector and solder on a power cable from the PC power supply, again using
the multimeter to check voltages, this will give you two floppy power 
connectors. Connect the 34way cable to each of the drives, and then change 
the jummer settings on the drive which you want to be df1 so that it is.
Next, in the extension cable that comes from the external floppy port to the 
back of the case, solder all of the wires striaght across except for the 
following changes: 
pin 21 on the Amiga port is unconnected,
pin 9 on the Amiga port to pin 21 on the case plug,
pin 20 on the Amiga port to pin 9 on the case plug,
pin 20 on the case plug is unconnected,
This will mean that the next external drive will be df2:, followed by df3:, 
this is the maximum number of external drives allowed.

WARNING this drive hack worked for me, but your mileage may vary. You can but
try it out. But again, althought I dont see how any could arise; 
I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED.

Now we come to the front of the case.
On mine I had a power switch, reset button, a 3 digit LED display, a FD and 
HD access light, and a system power on light.
The various lights were wired up to the LED board from the A1200, and the LED
display was setup to read; 6.28  meaning 6Mb.28MHz which is my system spec.
The reset button was linked into the keyboard hack via the reset line and GND,
so can can reset from the front of the case too.

Boring stuff about me:

I have owned an Amiga for the past 5 yrs, and before that used my mate's ones.
My first was an A500+, then came along an A1200 (which became an A1200T).
I even briefly had an A4000/040!!!
My current system is;

A1200T, with 1Gb 3.5" IDE HD, 52Mb removable IDE HD for data transfer, 
Apollo 1220 28MHz 020 with 4Mb, Aiwa ACD-300 CD-ROM, Surf Squirrel, 14.4K USR 
Sporster Modem,

A500+, with GVP Impact-II 52Mb SCSI HD and 2Mb RAM, 2Mb Chip RAM, KS 2.0 + 1.3,
Ext, Floppy, Amstrad Hacked Monitor,

A500+ and A1200 linked with ParNET.

I am currently studying a BSc Computer Science at Teesside University, and have
my finger in the pie at a couple of BBS's, one day I'll have my own. 
Theres more info on me and a VERY good Teesside BBS on Marc Bradshaw's Web 
pages, which are at;

Well worth a visit.....   Check out the pictures!!

Future ideas:

I am currently working on the plans for a Zorro 2 expansion for the A1200, 
interest from the Amiga community would be very greatly recieved, especially
from those of you who have a A1200 Zorro tower expansion system, in case I
cant work out the address lines for myself, and have to cheat a little....
Please contact me at the above places.
 
Happy hacking............
