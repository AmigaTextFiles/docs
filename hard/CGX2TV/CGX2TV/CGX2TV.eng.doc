  As you can see on the scheme TVout is very simple to do. To use TVout You
have to set 15 kHz CGX mode (or P96) and get a tv set with EURO input with
RGB (example 15 kHz monitor settings are in "monitor-15kHz" file). 720x288
mode I have made especially for MPEG-MPEG1 movies that are able to watching
after double horizontal screen size increasing, and MPEG2 (VOB) after
double vertical size decreasing. If Your cart don't have interlace mode
(f.e. Permedia 2) it's the highest resolution that you can set. To use
TVout and >30 kHz monitor in the same time You have to set both minimum
Hfrequency on 15 kHz and the parameters for chosen mode.

  WARNING!!! TVout ain't got no securities! Giving 15 kHz signal to the VGA
monitor or 30 kHz (or even more) to Your tv can damage them! To avoid it
You have to use ModePro with "ask for unknown modes" option, so then a try
to project 15 kHz mode will case to show up the requester. You have to turn
off your monitor and accept the requester. Then turn on the tv. Quitting 15
kHz mode is done by turning off the tv and after that turning on the
monitor. My tv (as for now) stands with 38 kHz and monitor - 15 kHz, but I
don't take the responsibility for Your equipment!

  I have theoriticaly designed PAL coder that gives Composite Video signal
and auto tv/monitor switch for 15 kHz/>30 kHz signals. Finishing this
project costs me a lot of both time and money. As for now I'm not thinking
of >30 kHz modes into 15 kHz modes conversion, but I'm not sure if I won't
do that.

  If You have made my TVout and You are happy of using it please send 10DM
or 5$ (cash).

History:

0.1 - First relase
0.2 - Added CGX2TVeuro.iff - shows you scheme that can be done with Amiga-EURO
cable and use CMOS 4011.
0.3 I added some more resolutions - 1440x288 without interlace (for Permedia 2)
and 1440x576 with interlace (both similar to SuperHires). Pixel Clock >20MHz
in those two modes allows to work with 24bits graphics.
