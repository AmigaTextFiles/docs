 Welcome to the simplest logical solution to the dilemma of the A1200 tower keyboard.

This project was first researched in May 1993, due to the requirements of fitting an A1200
into a tower at the minimal cost to the client/customer.

It was discovered by myself (Jeff Rose) that most models of A500 keyboard could in fact be
utilised in the same way as the A1200 keyboard connects to the A1200 motherboard.

The connectors are the same width, 31 connections, so if it worked on a A500, it was expected
that the Commodore engineers would use logic and simply have moved the connectiom to the centre
of the A1200 keyboard, thus connecting to the A1200 motherboard.

After carefully studying the circuit diagrams of both keyboards, with confidence, I wired up 
the keyboard as per these attached diagrams and it worked first go, complete with reset.

This was then tested on and it worked on Rev 1D4 up to Rev 2B A22200 Motherboards.
A logical solution was born to solve the A1200 tower conversion problem.
This information was classified up till now by myself.

Making the small circuit sitting over the ram is simple.

Cut a small copper clad circuit board to fit just over the 4 chips,
score out teh five dividing spaces witha small sharp knife.
heat up the  small cut out pieces and they will lift off the printed 
circuit board leaving five solder rectangular pads on which to connect 
via soldering,  do not overheat as they too will lift.

Parts Required:
---------------

the small copper clad board, a ferrite bead, (A500 has many)
a 15µF ~ 22µF  capacitor and some colored wires per the drawings.

Doing it:
---------

The most complex part is the lifting of pins 12 & 13 of the keyboard chip.
this will require an amount of skill, not to get it too hot and not to overheat 
the pads on the 12 & 13 chip legs pads.

I would suggest using a very thin rigid knife sliding it under just as the 
solder melts, this will do three things, 

(1) this will separate the leg from the pad.
(2) it will lift the leg off the pad due to the thickness of the knife.
(3) finally it will assist in cooling teh pad and legs after heating.


Follow the pictures (in color) no black & white diagrams to confuse.
Try to stick to the color wiring patterns I have outlined, this will 
aid fault finding.

Be sure to check your work before you power it up, a good digital multimeter
is a good start, the range in price from el-cheapo to really expensive. 

The el-cheapo as long as it has a continuity piezo buzzer or similar in it is fine to use.

It is now for everyone to enjoy !
