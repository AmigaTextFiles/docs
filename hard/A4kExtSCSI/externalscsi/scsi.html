The A4000 does not have a SCSI controller fitted as standard although there
are a wide choice of third-party boards available. These come in two types:
controllers which fit into a Zorro slot, for example the Octagon, and those that are integral to an
accelerator card, for example the WarpEngine. Zorro controllers usually have
a socket fitted enabling SCSI external
peripherals to be plugged straight in. Controllers like the WarpEngine which
replace Commodore's CPU card often only have an internal 50 way socket.
<P>
I wanted to be able to plug in Iomega's external SCSI ZIP and Jaz drives and after
hunting around unsucessfully for a suitable adaptor cable decided to build
one myself.
<P>
No drilling or cutting of the A4000 case is required for this hack which is
easily reversible. Soldering skills are required.
<P>
This hack has been built
and tested by the author and is supplied in good faith. The author cannot be

There are several alternative "standard" SCSI connectors including the
Centronics 50 way but I decided to fit a Mac type DB25 socket. These are
fitted to most Apple Macs and to many Amiga cards including the GVP range.
Warren Block in his excellent
<A HREF= "http://extra.newsguy.com/~wblock/a4000hard/main.html">A4000 Hardware Guide</A>
suggests the use of the Centronics in preference to the Mac
connector but I have never experienced any problems using the DB25 way socket with short cable runs.
<P>
<B>Parts Needed </B>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>A length of 50 way IDC (SCSI) ribbon cable (up to 1 metre)
<LI>Sufficient 50 way IDC plugs for your controller and each internal SCSI device
<LI>A 25 way "D" socket
</UL>
<P>
<B>Method </B>
<P>
Do not be tempted to re-use old IDC connectors, they are almost inpossible to
remove from a ribbon cable without breaking the plastic and anyway they are
designed to be used only once. Re-using them can lead to unreliable
connections. It is much better to buy new parts and leave your old SCSI
ribbon cable intact. If the new cable doesn't work you can always re-fit the
original one.
<P>
Ensure that the power is off and the mains lead is removed from the A4000
before starting. Remove the case and undo the four screws which fix the hard
drives into the rear bay.
<P>
Remove the small plate which covers the "Expansion" port on the A4000 rear
panel. You can either make
a cutout for the DB25 way socket using this plate or preferably find a back plane from an
old PC or Amiga card which has the correct cutout already made and trim it
to the correct length.
<P>
Start making the cable by crimping one of the 50 way IDC connectors onto the
end of the new ribbon cable. This is the end that will connect to the socket
on the accelerator card. Ensure that the (red) identifying stripe is crimped
next to pin 1. There are several methods for crimping on the connector if the
correct tool is not available. The connector can be squeezed onto the cable
between the jaws of a vice using wooden blocks to prevent damage or, with
care, a large pair of pliers can be used.

Form the cable to shape so that it reaches each of
the devices on you internal SCSI chain. In my case the cable was routed from
the accelerator/controller to a CD ROM drive and then to the SCSI hard-drive
in the rear bay. Between the CD ROM and the hard drive I had to put two 90
degree folds into the cable to line up the connectors the correct way (pin 1
is almost always next to the power connector on a CD ROM or hard drive)
<P>
Crimp IDC connectors onto the cable in the correct position for each device.
Take care to make sure the connector is facing the correct way in each case.

The cable should be run underneath the hard drive and out to the Expansion
Connector on the back panel. <P>Cut off the ribbon cable so it is a few inches
longer than needed and seperate each conductor, peeling it back about 1 inch
(2.5cm).
<P>
Counting from pin 1,the red stripe on the ribbon, all odd numbered wires are
grounds and can be folded back for the moment.
<P>
The data lines etc should be soldered neatly onto the DB25 socket

The extra ground wires from the ribbon cable should all be connected to a
suitable point. They can be soldered directly to the shell of the DB25
socket. Double check all your connections, it is very easy to wire the DB25
incorrectly

Once you have made up the cable you can carefully reassemble the computer and
test the SCSI external connector by plugging in your peripheral device.
<BR><P>
<B>Termination</B>
<P>
To ensure correct operation the first and last devices on the SCSI chain
should be terminated with the termination off on any intermediate devices. If
you fit an external SCSI connector as described here this means the
controller and the externally connected device should be terminated while the
internal drives are unterminated. If you intend to remove your SCSI external
device it should be replaced with a seperate terminator, available from most
Mac suppliers.
<P>
Details of how to build an external SCSI terminator are available from the
Aminet:

In practice I found my setup was very uncritical of the actual
terminations and I was able to leave the termination on my hard drive on.
<P>The controller does not seem to care if the external device is connected or not, or
terminated or not. In my case it just works whether the external drive is plugged in or not. For further information on SCSI termination
