Some time ago I had a big problem.
I had borrowed a Blizzard 1220 4 Mb card from a friend and when I tried to
reset the computer, with the turboboard on, the Harddisk ( a Conner 210 Mb)
just disappeared. In other words, the system couldn't find my damn harddisk-
partitions after a reset. I found out that this problem could arise with a
Blizzard-board and a Conner Harddisk so I returned the board to my friend
and bought a M-TEC 68EC030 at 30 Mhz with 2 Mb memory and a 20 Mhz
Co-processor. But when I tried to reset the computer with this board on the
same problem arose again, my harddisk disappeared (it wouldn't boot or even
work after I've loaded workbench from disc). I thought that maybe the
problem was that there wasn't enough power for both the 3.5 inch harddisk
and the Turboboard at the same time so I borrowed a better power supply than
my own from a friend (4 Amp). But It still wouldn't work. So, I gave the
harddisk a look and found two jumpers at the back of it, I removed the second
one (NOT the one in the far end of the series of pins for adding jumpers!)
and threw it away. When I started my computer and pressed Ctrl, L-,R-Amiga,
(i e made a reset) the harddisk started to boot. My BIG PROBLEM was solved.
So I figured that since I'm probably not the only one to have bought a
Conner harddisk and A turboboard for my Amiga 1200 I'm probably not the only
one having this problem, and therefore I decided to write this little script
and share my knowledge with others.

Description of how to do it:

Have a look at your 3.5" Conner harddisk, turn it up side down so that you
can see the circuit-board and it's IC-circuits. At the oppos¡te shortside
of your cables (not the one where your cables are) there is two jumpers and
a whole lot of males (I think there is 15 of them). The males sits in pairs
of two and in two groups, one with 3 pairs and one with 4,5 pairs. Remove
the jumper in the middle of the group with 3 pairs (You should remove the
little black plastic thing with a central position of this group). Start
your computer and VOILA!!! now you can reset again and your computer is
alive and kicking.

has I would like you to send me a letter telling me how thankfull you are :)
Perhaps we could swap PD and Ideas or something.

What the hell is this guide !
Well in case you didn't know by now I think I ought to tell you.
If you have a conner harddisk and a memory or turboboard to your A1200 you
might have the same problem as I used to have, the harddisk won't work
after a reset of your computer. This script tells you how to solve this
problem.

But! don't forget that if you use this script and get your harddisk to work
again you have to send me a letter, or a gift of some kind
(maybe one of your own programs or games if your a programmer).
Just to let me know that you appreciate my help. If you won't give me some
feedback I won't go thrue the effort of uploading my future tips on Aminet.
Anyway read the script. Thanks!
