  How to make a null modem cable.

  There are a lot of games and programs (such as Sernet) going around that have
the ability to utilise a null modem link between two Amigas, but as far as I can
see, there is no documentation on Aminet as to how you construct one of these
cables! This document, along with the files found in SerBuffer.lha give full
details on how to make a serial link cable between two Amigas, and how to makea
buffer to enable this link to be made reliably over long distances.

Parts needed:

  2x DB25 Female connectors (A1000 users see note 1)
  2x DB25 covers
  8 way cable. (See 2)

(1) The A1000 uses male connectors, so if 1 or both of the machines you intend
to connect are A1000s then you will need male connectors instead of female ones.

(2) Choose a length of cable that is as short as convenient, although anything
upto at least 10m (30ft) can be considered safe. Almost any cable is suitable,
although for longer runs, good quality cable, such as that designed for LAN
applications is prefered. For shorter runs, phone or alarm cable will do.
If you intend to hide the cable beneath a carpet or behind furniture, you may
find ribbon cable more convenient, although this tends to be more expensive.

Making the cable.

  This is simplicity itself. All you need to do is connect the pins in the
following order. I`ve included an IFF picture which show the connections, and
gives the pin connections for the serial port.
  You must ensure that only the connections specified are made. The pin numbers
can usually be found molded into the connector itself. Any solder bridged
between pins must be removed before the cable is connected.

Connect the following pins:

Amiga 1   Amiga 2   Purpose

   1         1      Shield Earth
   2         3      TXD -> RXD
   3         2      RXD -> TXD
   4         5      RTS -> CTS
   5         4      CTS -> RTS
   6        20      DSR -> DTR
   7         7      System Earth
  20         6      DTR -> DSR

  You must NOT connect pins 1 and 7.

Soldering tips.

  If you are using multi-core (stranded) cable, you will find it much easier if
the `tin' the end of the wire by twising the strands together and dipping it in
some hot solder.

  I find it easier if you pre-melt a little solder into the holes that need
connecting. When you are ready to insert the wire, all you need to do it heat
the connector and insert the wire, without the need to try and juggle some
solder as well.

  If two connections do become shorted, clean the tip of your soldering iron on
a piece of damp cloth or sponge and heat the join until the solder melts. Try
and bring some away on the iron and clean this off on your sponge. Repeat this
process until the join is removed.

Final words.

  When all the connections are made, to finish, all you need to do it put the
covers on the DB25 connectors. Whilst these are not absolutely essential, they
do help you to insert and remove the connectors without damaging your computer.

  Finally, then your cable is ready, connect it between the serial ports of your
two amigas, but ensure the POWER IS OFF before you plug them in. If, when you
turn you amiga on, the display is not as it should be, TURN THE POWER OFF
IMMEDIATELY! Failure to do so could result in the destruction of parts of the
circuitry of your computer. If there is a problem, remove the covers on you r
cable and check all the connections, with a multimeter if available.
Importantly, ensure pins 9 and 10 (14,21 and 23 on an A1000) are NOT connected
to anything. If the cable checks out, but you still have problems, I would
advise you get a qualified repair technician to have a look at your computer, as
you could have a faulty part.

  To test your cable, simply load a link game, or a program such are sernet. I
have included a simple dumb terminal program written in AMOS for you to test the
link with as well.

  Good luck!!!
