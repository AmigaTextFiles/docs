DumbTerminal documentation.

  This program is provided simply to test a null modem or other serial port link
between two amigas.
  This program has been slightly modified from a package I have written for use
in amateur theatre productions, and therefore it may not be modified without my
permission, nor may it be sold for profit.

  To operate this program, first ensure both amigas are linked with a null modem
cable. Then load this program into AMOS on both machines. Do not attempt to run
this program if only one machine is turned on, as it will hang.

  When the program runs, you will be presented with a seemingly blank screen.
The display is actually divided into two parts, one for outgoing and one for
incoming messages. To send a message, simply enter it via the keyboard. The text
is stored purely as ASCII codes, so if you use the cursors or other function
keys, then what is received might not correspond with what you sent. Once you
have finished typing, press return to send the message.

  Messages are received automatically. If no messages are received, then there
is a fault in your connection. Check your cable and try again.

  If you wish to test the speed of the serial link, you may alter the value
given after the `Serial Speed' command. The default is 9600. If you have trouble
at this speed, then your link is very susceptible to interference.
