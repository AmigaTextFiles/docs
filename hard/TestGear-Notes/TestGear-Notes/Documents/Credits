                              -----------------

  This is a thank you to all those people who have given me support over
  the years whilst I have been developing the hardware and/or software
  combinations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) First and foremost my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
     on my computers.
  2) My daughter Tamsan who puts up with my moaning.
  3) Nathan Shepherd who at 1998 was 8 years old and very interested in
     tinkering with electronics. He was the one who set me off on this
     project building. He owns an old A500 with 1MB, Workbench 1.3x,
     an extra floppy drive and MISSING the mouse. He has successfully
     built some of the projects.
  4) David Benn, the author of ~ACE Basic Compiler~ that made all of the
     programming very easy indeed, (Thanks Dave). I would recommend this
     to anyone who wants to learn programming. David lives in Australia.
  5) Herbert Breuer, who developed the front end ~AIDE~ for ~ACE~, what
     a pleasure to use, (simple and easy). This has NEVER crashed my
     machine at all, in my many years of use. Both this and ~ACE~ are
     unbelievably stable in use.
  6) Laurence J Greatorex, who was/is one of the beta builders and testers.
     He was the first to notice the projects a few years ago.
  7) Bob Eva, also was one of the beta builders and testers until recently,
     sadly Bob is in ill health. Get well soon Bob.
  8) Ozz Scott, an engineer who has been a beta builder and tester, he gave
     me much feedback on what machines the software would run on. He is
     deeply involved in making machine tools at the moment.
  9) Mike Mather, ZL2CC, for the New Zealand vendors/suppliers.
 10) Dave Tyler, for the American vendors/suppliers.
 11) Paul Harvey, for attempting the PCB designs of the ~Scope~ project.
     They will eventually be published in ~TestGear4C.lha~ when he has
     finished his ~Degree~ at University in Australia. Good luck Paul.
 12) Gunther Nikl, for the extra information in the ~NoMouse~ file.
 13) And to the people from all around the world who have Emailed me over
     the years about the projects. Without the AMIGA, and yourselves this
     would not have been possible.
 14) And finally to anyone else that I have missed or forgotten.

                            Thanks to you all.
