Ok Folks...  You all (well not all, but quite a few of you) asked for it

so here it is!  Please excuse spelling errors and type-o's.  I did this on

a floppy based 1200 via "ed" on a FRENCH KEYBOARD no less!



This updated version corrects the case dimensions that I had 

previously given from memory in V1.1 (and were wrong), shows some digitized

picture of the final product (and a picture of ME to boot!), and also includes

a schematic and PCB mask for making your own CDTV/A2000 KB --> A500 adaptor

that will allow a normal "Three Finger Salute" warm boot with a CDTV/2000/3000

keyboard. It also reveals an error found in the original Commodore A500 schem-

atics regarding the _KB_CLK and _KB_DATA lines (they were shown backwards!).  

John Baker and I came to this conclusion after much email discussion and final

verification with Dave Haynie.)  And at the last moment, I also decided to add

my NTSC/PAL switch hack.  Although this hack COULD be reduced to a SIMPLE 

SPDT switch, I added a bit to it to give switch deboucing, TTL buffering,

and a nice LED indicator to show what mode you are in (LED ON=PAL).  I decided

to include this small hack because it works PERFECTLY with the tower hack and

allows one to use the tower case's RESET switch to change video modes, and the 

TURBO LED as the PAL/NTSC indicator.

DESCRIPTION:
------------

The HACK_PICS images that are included in this archive step you through the

process of putting your Amiga 500 into a Black Diamond Mid Tower Klone Case.

The use of the DIAMOND CASE I mention is important in that the dimensions

were specifically selected so that everything fits nicely.  In fact, after

cutting into my machine and actually starting the hack I was

PLEASED to find how nicely the case I had chosen fit the A500 mother board!

The two screw holes next to the Zorro I connector matched up PERFECTLY to

two of the cases mother board mounting holes and positioned the board DEAD

against the upper inside part of the case!  This left me a little room to

possibly add a Zorro II adaptor some time in the future and maybe add a

24 bit graphics board and an Emplant (an A500 geeks dream!).  Now as I

have begun researching it, it does not appear that this is possible while

running an A530 due to bus congestion. <Sighhhh>  Oh well...  An A4000T is

looking better all the time...  Anyway...  Continuing...  This specific case

was chosen for it's nice roomy dimensions.  There is plenty of room to

mount an A500 mother board vertically and have room horizontally (in the

BOTTOM of the case) to mount an A530 or other A500 type expansion device(s).



The PCB_KBRST_LM339.iff and PCB_KBRST_SCEHM.iff pics show how to construct

a small 1 chip PCBoard or air hack to generate the _KB_RESET signal that the 

CDTV/A2000/A3000 keyboards lack.  The signal is derived from the _KB_CLK

line and then in fed into the A500 mother board (pin 3) where the stock KB

signal was hooked up.


The actual construction of the project can be done in one of two ways.  The 

first is to go ahead and use the PCB mask I have made up to print out (at 

360x360 DPI resolution for correct pin dimensions).  After printing it out, 

you can either use the photo-chemical method or use the iron on method (using

special Copier/Laser Printer transfer paper that allows the ironing on of

the PCB mask).  This special Laser Printer/Copier acetate can be purchased 

from Digi-Key (800-344-4539) for around $1.50/sheet in packs of 10.  This 

substance allows you to copy PCB masks onto a special acetate which can THEN

be ironed directly onto the copper PCB and etched!  No holes need to be drilled

in the PCB using this method.  I simply "bent" the lower portion of the chips

pins and mounted the chip and components onto the PCB as one would a surface 

mount devices.  This method is easy and very stable.  I have included a JPEG

image of one of my 741 version prototypes (the last picture in the KB_HACK

slide show) in which I used this "iron on" etching method. It should be noted,

that although the schematic HAS been tested, the LM339 PCB mask I created has

not as I used the second "in air" method for the LM339 version of the circuit.
 

The second method is a simpler and quicker method for small one chip projects.  

This method allows one to simply build the circuit "in air" on no form of PCB 

(except a ground and Vcc Plane if you wish: see below for a rough example).

Hot glue can be used for both a strengthening and insulating material.  It may

SOUND like a kludge... and it is.. but for a simple one chip project, it works

very well and is MUCH faster than etching a whole PCB for one chip and a few

components.

SUPPLIES YOU WILL NEED:(CDTV/A2000 KB HACK)
-------------------------------------------
-SS Copper PCB       This is only if you are planning on dumping my PCB mask
                     to copper PCB and etching your own little board.  I tried
                     this method using 741 op amps but it seems to much of a
                     pain to justify.  The second version I made used the 
                     illustrated LM339 Quad Op-Amp and just built it "in air"
                     which is actually very stable and reliable for such single
                     chip projects.

-Project Case        Since it will be internal, you can improvise.  I used
                     a little Rat Shack project case on my 741 version.  On
                     the LM339 "air" version I used a little plastic case that 
                     looked like a 35mm film bottle with a hinged top.

I have had a lot of questions about the tower cases price, and where to get it,

so to be on the safe side; I will tell you where I got MINE.  I did some

tech work for a friend of mine in College Station Texas who owns his own

computer place and had him track down this case SPECIFICALLY for it's

dimensions.  I hear that there are SEVERAL various "Diamond" cases, so to be

safe, you may want to just stick with this source...  Unless you're feeling

lucky and have a fetish for digging through Computer Shopper.  As I mention

in the IFF's, I do not have access to the REAL dimensions (or any of my

schematics) and so this whole thing (& listed values) is from memory.



The case its self is VERY nice and built like a tank! It is nicer than any

case that I have seen in any PACKAGE Klone deal (I've assembled and worked

on many PC's over the years).  If you decide to take the plunge and build

this project, the guy to contact is Ollie at Texas Computer Warehouse at

phone 409-693-6635.  He usually only does big contract related sales, but

if you tell him that you are an Amiga user and that *I* sent you his way,

he'll take care of you.  I'm not sure what the case is going for but it

should be between $160 and $180 and I have no idea about the shipping

costs.  The best thing to do is call him about that.  Please don't leave me

email about this stuff...  He could tell you WORLDS more than *I* could

about availability and pricing.


Well, lets see...   


***Now would be a good time to multitask yer way to the IFF picture files***

                        (Like you already HAVEN'T!)


POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
------------------
(Assume that you WILL have problems...  That way you won't be surprised...)


The Zorro I bus extension for the A530 (or other device)

connects to the Amigas Zorro I bus and is soldered to the

expansion device.  This is very touchy and should be done with extreme care!

When I did my A530, the A530's leads were too close together to get even a

small pencil iron's tip into, so each pin had to be BENT slightly to the

side before soldering could be attempted.  Just THIS part of the soldering

job took me a couple hours of straight, sweat drenched, teeth clenching,

lead breathing, agony (I'm always more nervous when I'm working on my own

baby!).  Since the A530 is a multilayer board, bending a soldered lead TOO

far or leaving the heat on TOO LONG could possibly break a trace DOWN INSIDE

the multilayer board making the whole thing inoperative.  I guess a fake

MALE CONNECTOR could be used in the expansion device's side, but I did not

have access to any such board when I did this project and I was in a rush

(it being a finals week and all).  If you *DO* have access to an old

totally dead A500 mother board, I guess you could cut off the male edge

connector of the Zorro I and make a fake PLUG in solution to the above

kludge.  Mine works fine though and I ain't messing with it!



There is ONE point where I mention that you have to DRILL THROUGH the

mother board to create a third mounting hole.  If I remember correctly, the

hole was drilled just in front of the GARY chip (this area was dictated by

the alignment of the other two holes by the Zorro connector).  On the

backside of the board, the hole simply penetrated a ground plane (rev 5

mother board) but on the top side, I think I went through like 3 address

lines.  But this was a must due to alignment. So I merely cleared enough room

for the mounting of a metal screw (i.e. cut the traces back further from the 

hole edge) and rerouted the lines with insulated wire wrap wire. All ran 

smoothly and worked fine.


NOTE: THIS LAST STEP IS A MAJOR NO NO TO THOSE OF YOU WITH MULTI-LAYER MOTHER 

BOARDS!  CHECK TO SEE IF YOURS IS OR IS NOT MULTILAYER *BEFORE* DRILLING!



This case also worked nicely because the point at which the mother board

rests, places the adapted power connector solder job (see IFF 2, Fig 4.1)

against open air (as apposed to facing the harsh METAL right hand inside of

the case).  This was a nice relief as I am always paranoid of potential

"Easy Short" areas that could kill an entire machine while tripping your

breakers.

               /
            BvO



Although I doubt that anyone else will have THERMAL (Shea!)problems, I 

found that I had to mount TWO EXTRA internal fans (the second A530 micro fan 

is not shown in the diagrams) due to the fact that I was running an old 5.25" 

HH Miniscribe 160M SCSI drive that puts off a *LOT* of heat.  When the 

platters got hot enough, thermal calibration would fail and the drive would 

go into a thermal recal FRENZY with constant R/W errors until I shut her down 

and let her cool off.  I think that it was also due to the fact that the home 

made AC power supply I made for the Internalized Line Link was dissipating 

like close to 3-5 watts of overhead voltage (times the operational current).

The modem needed a 9V AC Xformer and I was feeding it via a 12V Xformer and

using recitfiers as clippers and they were getting rather warm... In fact,

I had to mount them (3 of them) together, shoot 'em up with heat sink spooge

and make a little aluminum heat sink.  I still don't know why that modem

sucks so much current.  Poor design I guess.




CONCLUSIONS:
------------


I have seen other hacked Tower systems and mine is the only one that I have

seen that could pass for commercial...  Well... Except for the Epoxy I

guess...  But What is a finished plastic, but merely a type of squared

off epoxy?!  Anyway...  It came out looking really nice.  


A nice finishing touch I decided to do was to tape off and paint in BIG,

CLEAN CUT, FLAT BLACK, the letters "A M I G A".  You can also get ahold of

rub on white stencil letters to add final touches to any outside lettering

you want do.  I blanked out (with Mr.Dremel) the letters for the RESET

switch and put PAL/NTSC.  It too looks nice.  The lettering also came in

handy for labeling the LEDs and extras appearing on the front of the Line

Link modem.  The case also comes with a few sheets of little silver stickers

for things such as VIDEO, AUDIO, MOUSE, GAME, COM1, 2, POWER, etc...



This a pretty big project here.  IF you are not very mechanically inclined

OR have not played around electronics a LOT (i.e. Have good soldering

experience), this is probably not for you.  And please don't ask me how

much I would charge to do it for you.  Looking back, I don't think that I

would WANT to do it again.  And if I did, you couldn't afford my time

anyway.  This was more of just an technical outcry of my lowly financial

status in lieu of upgrading than a planned mega-hack.



Keep your eyes open for a possible future A530 RAM HACK to take it PAST

it's hardware designed 8M of RAM!  Well...  If I don't loose interest and

go get that A4000 first.  Or 486 DX...  NOT!


(UPDATE:  I ended up breaking down and buying a GVP 4M SIMM from
a company called HCo.  Another tech friend of mine sent them a GVP SIMM
and got them to clone them.  I got a 4M (1Mx32) SIMM for $158!!  Even less 
if you buy more than one!  Besides.. looks like I may be going to an A4000T 
anyway.  If you want what info I have, email me...  I have the SIMM pinouts 
(GVP) and some of the A530 info..  all I was lacking was the A2000 50MHz 
Combo PAL Eq's... If you have the PAL Eq's TELL ME!!!  Or if you can yank 
your PALs and GET the EQ's.. Email me!)



A Little About Me:
-------------------

(If Anyone cares)  ;u)



I was raised in Groton/Ledyard Connecticut.  Went to a technical high

school (Ella Grasso S.E. Tech) and took Electronics there for 3 years.

Went on from there to Thames Valley St. Tech School for an AS in

Electrical Engineering Technologies.  Transferred to Texas A&M in Spring of

'92.  It's now late '94 (boy I'm feeling long in the tooth) and I've

finished all my engineering classes.  Have to go back this spring to take

a patchwork of classes to finish up my BS in EET/Telecom if I wanna get out

by the end of this summer.


(VER 1.4 Note:  It is now may '96 and I have graduated and have a job
in San Antonio.)


I have been a Commodore Technician for about 7 years.  Have been authorized

Amiga Technician (by Commodore for what ever THAT'S worth now!) since

'91 (but been working on them since '89).  Have also done classified

peon stuff for Tracor Applied Sciences/N.U.S.C, been a Pro Audio Tech

(twice), and a computer tech (at like... uhhh.. 5 official places through

time.)



Oh...  My System includes: A500 (tower of course), A530, 9M RAM(1C8F), 800M
