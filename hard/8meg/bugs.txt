Bug fixes:

- v1.0 - November 1991

Big bug here! Fixed in 2.0


------------------------------

- v2.0 - February 1992

There was a BIG mistake in the schematic. The top three address lines were
REVERSED when going to the 74ls138. It should have been
A23 - 1   A22 - B   A21 - A .  This has been changed in the new schematics.
My thanks to Jason Goga for pointing that out
                                --------------
I have also been told that 256k x 1 DRAM chips will also work on this project.
My memory data book doesn't have full specs on the 256x1, so I canot verify
this. Use them at your own risk.
