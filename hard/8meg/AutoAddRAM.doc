            AutoAddRAM v2.03 (c) Copyright 1990 by Jonathan Potter

  This program allows you to add multiple non-autoconfiguring memory boards
to the free memory list quickly and easily. It reads from a text file a list
of addresses, and attempts to add memory at those addresses. It will not
attempt to add memory that does not exist, or has already been added.

  To use, set up a file in the S: directory, called MemoryList.AAR. This file
contains, on each line, the start and end addresses of each memory chunk you
wish to add. For instance, if you had a 1 meg RAM board at $200000, a 2 meg
RAM board at $400000, and 256K KickRAM at $f80000, your S:MemoryList.AAR would
read :

200000 2ffffe
400000 5ffffe
f80000 fbfffe

  You may also specify the priority and name for each chunk of memory. You
may specify neither priority or name, just priority, or priority and name (ie
you must include priority if you specify the name). For example,

200000 2ffffe 10
400000 5ffffe 0 mymemorychunk
f80000 fbfffe

  Consult the documentation of your memory boards if you do not know the
start and end addresses of that memory.
