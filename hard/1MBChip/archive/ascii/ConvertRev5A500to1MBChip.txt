Short: 	   1MB ChipRAM on Amiga500 Rev.5

Version:   2.1
Replaces:  Most other stuff about this subject

Did you try to find a document about giving 1MB ChipRAM to your A500 ???
If so, you will probably have found a dozen docs telling you to proceed
differently. This doc is what you should believe in. I did it myself, and
it worked fine.
NOTE: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY USING THIS DOC NOR
IS ALLAN. YOU DO EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN RISK. READ EVERYTHING CAREFULLY.




Convert A500 Revision 5 to 1MB ChipRAM (Version 2.1, 8.6.99)

I wanted to give my Amiga 500 1MB of ChipRAM but most documents dealing with 
this conversion were incomplete, except the one by Allan Versaevel. But even
this very good document lacks some valuable information on how to do the task.

Please note: The scheme below was sent to me by Allan Versaevel who really 
answered all my questions without getting bored.
And now, NOTE THAT YOU DO EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN RISK. NEITHER ALLAN NOR
MYSELF TAKE ANY RESPONSABILITIES FOR DAMAGE THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY THIS
CONVERSION.

Things needed:
8372A Agnus
512KB mem expansion in the trapdoor-slot
solder iron

At first, open up your Amiga. Take care not to break the expansion port.
Then look above the trapdoor slot, where you`ll find something like
"Rock Lobster bla bla". Is it a Rev. 5 Amiga, then OK. If not, check
the hints at the end of this text. Now you should check whether you have
a 512KB expansion in the trapdoor slot. Without this, you can forget 
about the conversion. Well, two thirds are checked. Look at your Agnus
chip. You find it right of the CPU. In most cases it will be an 8371.
You have to replace it by an 8372A. Drink a beer and heat up your solder
iron because you`ll need it later. Now remove the metallic cover from the
lower side of the motherboard. You can only remove it half, so you`ve got
to hold the cover back. A second person could be useful for this, maybe
a little sister !?? Take care. Where the Agnus sits on the component side
are two holes. Take TWO screwdrivers and press the Agnus out of its socket
via these two holes. This way you won`t damage the socket if you take care. 
Once this is done, put the new Agnus into the socket. Now you have to cut 
two little connections. First you should cut the _exram line. It`s not 
labeled, but you can find it easily. Look at the pins of the trapdor slot.
Count down 8 pins, starting from the back of the Amiga. Now look directly
left. There is a single solder POINT with a line coming out of it. This
line goes directly up ( towards the back of your Amiga ). Cut it without
cutting any other line. I recently found out that you can do this much easier:
Just pull the Gary chip out of its socket and bend up pin ?? ( sorry, forgot
which pin, look into the A500 manual, it`s described there ).
Then take a look between the CPU and Kickstart ROM. You`ll find a jumper called 
JP2. You have to cut the existing connection and solder the other two pads 
together. That`s all. Close your Amiga and have fun.

Hints:

1. Take care and time. Treat your Amiga like an egg. Make some breaks.
2. If you have a Rev 6 board look at other docs. Most deal with it ,too.
   On Rev.6 boards you have to cut a second jumper. Sorry, that`s all I
   know.
3. Maybe you use a TV as monitor. If you`ve got four flickering pics
   after the conversion, you are proud owner of an NTSC Agnus. Some
   TV`s can`t handle this american TV standard. Use a monitor
   instead of a TV or boot up in PAL mode via the prefs. Note that most
   games will produce garbled screens on a TV because they use NTSC modes.
   If using a monitor, note that PAL games ( Die Siedler or Settlers,
   Great Courts 2, etc. ) won`t run. They have to be spoofed that they
   are running on a PAL machine. You can do this easily by TUDE. You
   can find this useful proggy on Aminet.
4. Those of you who fear that all expansion memory is lost, especially
   the RAM on Turboboards or HD Controllers, can calm down. Only the
   RAM in the trapdoor expansion is affected by cutting the _exram line.


That`s all folks, best regards,
