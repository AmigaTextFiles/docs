  You need to set the patched kickstart for this board to work
(it's necessary if pld is not used). Check rom/ROM_A1200_V39.106_M0.dif
and rom/ROM_A1200_V39.106_M0_c0.dif files for this.
The first file adds possibility to recognise memory from
$c00000 and system configuration using joystick, but it doesn't work
on certain a500s (screen goes yellow...) and also it isn't compatible
with genlocks that are programmed through joystick port.

  For rom/ROM_A1200_V39.106_M0.dif during reboot hold:
joystyick left -  change memory priority
joystyick right - change memory priority
joystyick up -  chip ram is copied 128Kb up (in order to rip mods from demos)
joystyick down -   no fast-ram recognition
joystyick left button - software HDD reset using cs1 and chip ram
                        clearing (reset won't be intercepted then)
joystyick right button - no HDD recognition

  Both version are checked and work fine. Futhermore, these changes
  were made to roms:

1. carddisk.device and carddisk.resourc¥,
   located at $f8a070-$f8b55b, were removed as a500 has no pcmcia.
   This space is used for some patches. The rest of this space is filled
   with $ff.
2. The algorithm for recognition of 1.5Mb of ram located at $c00000
   is changed, and recognition of 8Mb of ram located at $200000;
   ram can be located discontinuously. The case when ram is an image
   of the active rom is supported, though in pld version a part of ram
   is physically unavailable. It is made in to make the scheme universal.
   These roms were workiing with the old hddmem.lha project, which needed
   that feature sometimes. All the memory recognition is made without
   loosing its contents. The memory has the kick attribute, so "RAD" disks
   survive reboots.
3. Joystick reading during reset was added. See before.
4. IDE chip recognition removed, resulting in serious pld-free scheme
   simplifying.
5. IDE HDD reading and writing 30% speed-up gained, now it's about
   1.08 Mb/s. This is made changing move.w with move.l. HDD ports are
   duplicated for full commands anyway, and hardware access is only
   16-bit. By the way, this works even on a1200 and I see no point not
   to use it, especially the companies who make kickstart. It's
   absolutely correct for hardware.
6. Drive clicks removed by puuting the head to track 0.
7. "Guru" flashes only 3 times now. ;)

  Some words on how to get two files of 256Kb each for 8-bit roms 27C2000
from #?.dif files. First you need a1200 rom. It's not included in this
archive as it would be a copyright violation. So you should get it somehow
(you may even buy it ;) or rip it from your friend's rom or ask by
e-mail ;-) - not so important. The point is that it should be the file
kickstart from $f80000-$ffffff and it has 512Kb. Have a look at offset
$7ffe8 for these 4 bytes: $8b $56 $e9 $30 - this is the checksum.
Next you should copy it with the name xxx to rom/ directory of this archive
and open this directory in the shell so it is made current and type:

  >file_diff/diff_paste xxx rom_a1200_v39.106_m0.dif yyy

or

  >file_diff/diff_paste xxx rom_a1200_v39.106_m0_c0.dif yyy

  After that you'll get a file named yyy with needed kickstart and,
eventually, 512Kb in size. This is the patched rom. Next you type:

  >rom_split yyy aaa bbb

  aaa and bbb files are 8-bit rom image for 27c2000 chips.
Even bytes go to file aaa and then to dd14 chip, odd bytes go to
file bbb and then to dd15 chip.
