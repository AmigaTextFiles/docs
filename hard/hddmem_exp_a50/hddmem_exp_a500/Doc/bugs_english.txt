  There're supposedly no bugs in pcad4_5/kontr8.pcb borad scheme.
The only thin you should do when loading kontr8.pcb to pcad4_5 is
to widen the holes for IDE connector, for HDD  reset jumper, for
pld programming connector (if you need pld) and for
IDE HDD power supply, or the connector would be hard to fit in.

  The board in pcad4_5/real_old was made completely. Any amount of it can be
bought from me (Vladimir Sobolev) directly, but note that it contains sume
bugs. If you're not going to buy this board from me, you may delete the
"pcad4_5/real_old" directory and stop reading this file :)

  Unfortunately, the board in new .pcb file was not developed
(few clients; development of a board of this size costs about 50$;
the board itself costs about 20$), but all the bugs in new
.pcb file were corrected.

Bugs and new features from the board and scheme in pcad4_5/real_old
 to the pcad4_5/ version:

1. rom_oe is made of the same elements + dd13 element, but using other
   signals and in another way.
2. rd_wr is not connected to the system connector at printed board
3. we signal is not needed; rd_wr connected to SIMM instead
4. adr_sw signal is passed through the extra element dd13,
   which was freed of we signal, for longer delay;
   r21 resistor should be connected to gnd, not +5v.
5. simm panels are side-exchanged to solder the simm by the board's side.
6. pins 8 and 9 of dd6.2 element were circuited by mistake;
   pin 8 should be free.
7. pins 5 and 6 of dd11.1 element were circuited by mistake;
   pin 5 should be free.
8. pins 13, 10, 14, 11 of dd18 chip should be free to use them
   for even longer delay of adr_sw signal when necessary.
9. in dd7 trigger the circuits connected to pin 1 should be connected to
   pin 4 and vice-versa.
10. in dd7 trigger the circuits connected to pin 5, should be connected to
   pin 4 and vice-versa.
