AnaCal - The Analog Joystick Calibration Program!

FreeWare courtesy of C&P Software (Tony Solomon) 1992!

After building  an adapter to use IBM analog joysticks on the Amiga
(included!) for use with Fighter Duel (GREAT program!), I found the
need for a simple program to calibrate the stick.  I couldn't find any
to meet my needs so I quickly threw one together.  This program will 
let you set your trim BEFORE you start up your favorite simulator.

The Screen/Window and what it means:
The first thing you will see is a box in the top left corner with
the current X/Y values displayed.  Next you will see four values
to the right of the current X/Y.  LowX/Y and HighX/Y are the lowest
and highest values registered this session (for your information
only).  The average between the highest X/Y and the lowest X/Y 
are displayed next directly under the current X/Y.  You will need to 
try and get the AverageX (AvgX) and the AverageY (AvgY) values to 
+/- 1 increment to consider your joystick "calibrated".

How does it work?
When the program starts all the values are based on the current
settings your stick is at.  Let go of the stick and get your
trim settings (pots,dials,levers etc.) as close as possible to
centered.  Now move the joystick all the way to the left.  Notice
the LowX reading has dropped (hopefully to zero).  Now move the
stick all the way to the right.  A accurate average between the
lowest and highest 'X' reading is now available.  Do the same thing 
in both 'Y' directions (up/down).  Now release the joystick, using 
your trim, try to get the AvgX and the AvgY as close as possible
to the actual X/Y readings in the upper left box.  When you achieve
this a message will appear in the box at the bottom of the window.

To put the program back to zero and try again, simply push the 1st
fire button (different on sticks with more than one fire button).
If you are equipped with a 2nd fire button you may test this button
as well (the colors will change and you will get a 'Button2!' message).
I also put the facility for buttons 3&4 although I've never seen a
joystick with 4 fire buttons.

Congradulations, you have a calibrated joystick!  If you have any
questions/comments you may reach me on CompuSpend (70471,2654)
or on Computer Country BBS (904-769-9431).  I hope you find this
little tidbit useful.  Have fun!
