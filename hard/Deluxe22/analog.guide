                    Amiga Deluxe Analog Joystick Switch


 

  While researching analog joysticks for my Amiga, I found
that there were alot of different hacks out there all trying
to do the same thing. Before you say and here comes another,
let me explain why this one is the best.

  The major problem is there is no standard for analog
joysticks on the Amiga. Some software companies wrote the
analog drivers differently. Some swapped the X & Y axis
connections and some swapped the Fire button 1 & 2
connections,  while others need a capacitor on the X & Y
potentiometer wiper for added sensitivity! Why they choose
to do it this way is beyond me. 

  This hack will allow you to switch between all the
different functions, so you will be compatable with programs
out now or others written in the future.

  So until someone develops a standard or makes a fair
priced analog joystick for the Amiga, this is it.

                            Fighter Duel Pro-II




  Fighter Duel Pro 2, by Jaeger Software,Inc. Has a feature
in that it supports the CH Flight Stick Pro  analog
joystick.  This stick features what is referred to as the
'coolie','top',or 'Madonna' button. 

  This allows you to have four instant view changes at the
touch of a button on the top of the stick. Included is an
alternative way in which to hook it up, you must add 2 more
wires than are included in any existing analog adapter we
have ever seen.

                          Sensitivity Adjustment:


  Ideally you want to use .15 microFarad caps, but other
values will work.  Here is list of values and their range
readings using Anacal. 

  Note theses values may be a little different depending on
the brand of Joystick you use.



.1 micro-- X axis 0-120
           Y axis 0-120

.15 micro--X axis 0-220   (Full Range of Amiga 0-255)
           Y axis 0-220

.22 micro--X axis 0-255+ (off scale)
           Y axis 0-255+ (off scale)

 Note: a hooded connector will not fit on an A2000, best
thing to use  is a Joystick extension cable (made for
Atari®) with the regular slim  line joystick connection,
Radio Shack used to carry them.)

                           Joystick Calibration





  To calibrate or just check to see if it is working
properly, I recomend a program called @{"Anacal" link "AnaCal.ReadMe!/main" 0}  written by
Tony Solomon of C&P Software. This program is freeware and
is included with this archive, Thanks Tony.  

  This program will allow you to calibrate (center)  your
analog stick before you start playing a game.

  It shows you the Range of the X & Y potentiometers ie:
0-180, the average X & Y value ie:90 and the current stick
settings which can be changed by adjusting the trimmmers on
your stick. Ideally you want to get it exactly centered, so
your current settings match the average X & Y values. 

  It also checks for up to 4 fire buttons, although most
sticks have only 2.

                                Disclaimer:
 

  I assume NO responsibility for your use of this wiring
information!
 
 
  If done incorrectly it could easily damage your computer.


  Don't let that scare you.  I have used this design for
about 4  years.  I have built them for my friends as well
and the design works very well.

  This hack is Freeware, send me email or something if you
really like it. If you make any money off of it you have to
split it with me.  I think thats reasonable considering  the
"Amiga Smart Port" sales for $52.95.

 This hack is freeware, but if you would like to send me a
disk full of hacks, pics or what ever, feel free to do so.
If you make a million bucks of my design you have to split
it with me.

 For other neat hacks, download (Maps1.lha).  Any hacks sent
to me will be included in my next issue of Maps, unless the
author specifically states not to.
