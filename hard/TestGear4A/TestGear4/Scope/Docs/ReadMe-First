    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
    PCMCIA memory expansions. All memory expansions were ~DISABLED~ using
    the NoFastMem program from the System drawer. Also tested on an A600
    with various memory configurations, a 1MB A500 and Workbench 1.3x,
    an A500 with various memory configurations and also an A500(+) with
    various memory configurations.

    I suspect it will NOT work with fast accelerator cards.
