               Well done you have now reached TestGear Disk 4.
               -----------------------------------------------

  I have assumed (one must NEVER make assumptions) that you have progressed
  through TestGear Disk 1 (TestGear1.lha and TestGear1.readme), also
  through TestGear Disk 2 (TestGear2.lha and TestGear2.readme) and also
  through TestGear Disk 3 (TestGear3.lha and TestGear3.readme). I now expect
  that you have built projects (1) to (11) inclusive and that you are now
  ready for the next series of projects. These projects are now going to
  get harder. At this point I am NOT going to assume that you are a
  beginner, but instead a competent amateur electronics engineer. You now
  have the building blocks for testing many pieces of electronic apparatus
  on the market and are about to start building some serious test gear.
  The mouse WILL now be required, and the test gear on screen will even look
  like purchased equipment. This archive consisting of ~TestGear4?.lha~ and
  ~TestGear4?.readme~ will be dedicated to a Digital (Storage) Oscilloscope.
  It will have a specially designed Analogue to Digital Converter that is
  theoretically capable of sampling from DC to 5MHz Bandwidth. Enjoy
  building this tool.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.

  Calibration Equipment:-
  -----------------------

  To calibrate most of the projects you WILL require some dry cells or
  batteries. I decided on using the ~EVEREADY~ RED types as these are
  well known in the UK. They were all NEW, as this gives a definitive
  starting point to work from. However any ZINC/CHLORIDE types should be OK.
  Alkaline batteries were NOT used to calibrate any projects.
  
  1) R6..............  1.5 Volt nominal, RED body type, (ULTRA PLUS).
  2) 6F22............  9 Volts nominal, RED body type, (ULTRA PLUS).

  Also you WILL require ~Project11~ from ~TestGear3.lha~, the Oscilloscope
  Calibrator, also ~Project5~ from ~TestGear2.lha~, the Stereo LF Audio
  Function Generator and ~Project6~ from ~TestGear2.lha~, the 5 Volt DC
  digital voltmeter. Because the Digital (Storage) Oscilloscope project
  Disables/Enables both Tasking and Interrupts you WILL require a second
  AMIGA to run ~Project11~ and ~Project5~, preferably a Standard A1200 as
  all the previous projects are calibrated against this machine.

First of all many thanks to my wife Tricia who allows me to spend many hours
on my computers.

Also to David Benn and Herbert Breuer for the ACE/AIDE combination supplied
on an AMIGA FORMAT floppy disk which made it easy to compile this program.

And finally to anyone else who I may have neglected or forgotten.
