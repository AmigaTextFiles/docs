@Node AnotherHD "Installing a 2nd Hard Drive!"

 Installing a 2nd Hard Drive!
 ============================

 If you've not read the rest of the document then do so first!

 Okay, this is definately NOT for the faint hearted or those who are no
 good at diy.

 First I'll explain the basics of daisy chaining 2 hard drives.

 Okay, IDE can only have 2 devices at anyone time, the first device is
 called the MASTER and the second one is called the SLAVE.

 when you get a new IDE device it's always configured to be the MASTER
 drive as most people only have one IDE device, so if you want to add
 another drive you need to do 2 things.

 1) configure your 2nd device so that it is the SLAVE
 2) configure your 1st device so it knows there is a SLAVE device.

 (note: 2 is not always needed, but 9 of 10 times it is!)

 IDE idiosyncrasys
 =================

 you now need to know that some IDE devices dont like being slaves to
 other devices and vice versa.  Even IDE devices from the same company
 aren't compatiable!

 On a brighter note I can tell you that My western Digital 2250 and my
 conner 30254 work fine together! (and it's DARN GOOD having half a
 gigabyte of storage at your disposal!)

 The reason for some IDE's being different to other IDE's is that PC's
 dont use the IDE standard to the full and only use bits of it, for
 instance, the PC's BIOS will not get all the info about the drive from
 the drive itself,  you have to tell it what you've plugged in :-) crap or
 what!.  anyway,  because of this hard disk manafacturers only
 implemented the bits of IDE that PC's use to cut costs.  So, when your
 nice shiny new A1200 comes along with it's all singing all dancing FULL
 IDE you start to find that these so called 'standard' IDE drives dont
 work properly!   Aaarrgghh!

 See, PC's ARE to blame for all this, so take it out on your PC owning
 mate!

 Dont you just HATE PC's ????  I know I do (I had one once, It pissed me
 off so much I ripped the hard disk out and connected it up to my Amiga
 instead! and have since sold the PC!!! hahahahaaaa :-)

 So, the first thing to think about is wether your 2nd device will work
 with your first one,  if it does then carry on reading otherwise you
 might as well stop now!

 right then, still here ?

 Where do i put the bugger
 =========================

 to fit 2 3.5" hard disks inside the case of an A1200 is almost
 impossible, it was bad enough with just one, let alone 2!  So, unless you
 want to take out your floppy disk drive and put the hard disk there
 you'll have to mount it externally!  What I've done is mount BOTH of my
 hard disks externally,  it also makes it easier if you want to add an
 external PSU for the Hard Drives if you have it like this. This brings me
 nicely onto the next thing on the list :-

 EEErrrrk, where's all the power gone!
 =====================================

 having one 3.5" HD is a bad enough strain on an A1200 PSU, but having 2
 leaves the computer with NO power left at all!   If you went out and
 bought an beefy PSU for your 1200 when you fitted the first hard disk
 then there should be enough current for both of them (check the ratings on
 the Hard Drive(s) and on the PSU to make sure.)
 If you didnt then your gonna have to either a) get one or b) buy an
 external PSU for the hard drives,  the PSU MUST supply +12 volts at
 around 1 amp minimum and +5 volts at around 1.2 amps.  If you can find
 one with better ratings get that to be on the safe side,  but I wouldnt
 recommend using less than the above ratings.

 Oh no, i dont need to make another lead do I ?
 ==============================================

 you most certainly do my dear reader!

 what you now need is a lead that goes like this

 #-------<---------------------------#-----------------#

 A1200's 44 way       |                 and 2 40 way
 HIGH density         |                normal density
 connector        These little       connectors for the
                 lines signify           hard disks!
                  actual wires
              (in real life there
                would be more of
                 them and they
              would be a *little*
              closer together :-)

 The little squigly arrows in the middle of the cable mean "there can be any
 amount of cable here" (but it's not a good idea to have more than 1.5 Meters!
 preferably not more than 50cm if you can help it.

 you now have a choice to make,  you can either make a whole new cable
 or use the old one,  If you use the old one you can make it so that you
 can unplug the hard disks from the computer.

 Use the old cable
 =================

 ok then Mr. cheapskate! you'll need the following EXTRA bits

 1 x length of 40 way IDC ribbon cable
     (make it as long as you want but not too much longer than a meter)
 2 x 40 way IDC FEMALE connectors to crimp onto the above cable.
 1 x 40 way IDC MALE cable fitting connector.
     (basicly it fits onto the cable the same as the other connectors did
     but this has pins instead of holes so you can plug your old cable
     into it.)
     these connectors are about 4 quid or more!! compared to the female
     ones that cost about 90p tops!

 to make the cable do the following.

 Crimp the 2 female connectors to one end of the 40 way IDC cable (use a
 crimp tool or a vice) make sure you've got enough space between the
 connectors to allow you to plug them into the hard disks easily enough,
 about 4 inches should be plenty.

 Next, crimp the 40 way MALE connector to the other end of the cable
 making VERY sure that pin 1 on that connector matches pin 1 on the other
 ones or you'll be scraping bits of IDE hard disk off your wall!

 and thats it,  simple huh ?

 Make A New Cable
 ================

 ok, this is a bit more difficult than the other one so be prepared for
 some real tedious soldering.

 you'll need these parts to make this cable

 1 x length of 40 way IDC ribbon cable
     (make it as long as you want but not too much longer than a meter)
 2 x 40 way IDC FEMALE connectors to crimp onto the above cable.
 1 x 44 way HIGH DENSITY female IDC connector (to plug into the A1200)
 1 x length of 44 way HIGH DENSITY IDC ribbon cable
 1 x length of heat shrink tubing, about 1.5 MM unshrunk should do the
     trick.
 1 x soldering iron
 1 x length of solder (for soldering wires!)

 ok, now do this.

 crimp 44 way cable into 44 way connector.
 then crimp the 2 40 way connectors onto the 40 way cable about 4 inches
 apart.

 now comes the tricky bit. what you have to do is join the two cables
 together!!  Erk!

 so, solder pin 1 on the 44way to pin 1 on the 40 way cable all the way
 down to pin 40, dont forget to put the heatshrink round the cable so that
 the solder joints dont touch each other.

 and thats that.

 what about power ?
 ==================

 oh yeah, nearly forgot!

 if you've got a decent PSU for your A1200 then you can make a cable up as
 per cable3.iff (which is the same as cable 2 onlyit has a 4th connector
 on it.

 OR

 if you bought a seperate PSU then you'll need to wire it up to the
 connectors as per the pinouts in cable2.iff


 how do it configure the drives ?
 ================================

 now there's a good question if ever I heard one!

 well, as I've already said each IDE seems to be different so hear's a
 quick guide line.

 get hold of your existing (1st) hard drive, now somewhere on it there
 should be a load of jumpers that we need to change.  if you remeber I
 said there were 2 steps, 1 of which was to tell the master that there is
 a slave drive present,  so we now have to find the jumper that tells the
 hard drive that there is one,  on western digital drives it's marked as
 SP meaning "Slave Present"  this jumper needs to be set

 next get your other (2nd) hard drive, we've now got to tell it that it's
 the slave drive, so find the jumper that tells it this.

 you might also have to tell this drive (the 2nd drive) that there is a
 slave present (itself, that is) if it didnt work.

 heres a list of what some jumper labels *might* mean

 C/D  = pc's use letters instead of device names (cos PC's are SHIT) so
        on a PC the first drive would be C: the next would be D: and so
        on, so this jumper means select first/second drive or master/slave
        or C: or D:,  get it ?
        only problem is we dont know if it means jumper set means C: or
        jumper set means D: ?  oh well... (note: some drives have a little
        line above the letter C (like the conner 30254) which means that
        it is the opposite to what you think it should be :-)

 SP   = Slave Present, set this on the master drive and you might need to
        set it on the slave drive too

 SL   = Slave Drive

 MA   = Master Drive

 DS   = Drive Single (as on my Quantum)


 I've come across these on western digitals and conners, but havent really
 looked at other makes too much.

 if you need a hand give me a ring and i might be able to help you, you
 never know.

 you can also get drive/jumper setting info from various distributor BBS's
 around the UK or you could try ringing the people you got the drive from.
 most hard drives DONT come with any info on them what so ever, which is
 REALLY helpful!

 See @{"Manufacturer BBS's" link bbsnums}

 Connecting them up.
 ===================

 connect the drives to the 2 40 way female connectors on your lead, it
 doesnt matter which way round they go (thats what the jumpers are for :-)
 then dpenting on the cable you ad up connect it to a) your other cable or
 b) your a1200.

 now all we need is some power

 so, connect your PSU or your power cable to the hard drives and thats
 about it now.

 lastly..
 ========

 when you partition the drives make sure that the device names dont
 conflict (ie, dont have two DH0:'s!)

  First release.

  2.0
  ---
  in version 1.0 CABLE2.LBM had a slight error in it.  The actual wires on
  the cables did not correspond to the pins correctly.  This has now been
  rectified.

  The drawings have now been converted as I have been told that the origonal
  drawings were somewhat corrupted.  The reason for this is that they were
  drawn on DPAINT on the PC (hopeless computers!!) and the file format was
  incorrect.  They have now been converted to load into DPAINT and other IFF
  viewers.

  3.0

  Spelling mistakes corrected, fitting instuctions and other helpfull hints
  from people that have responded to this file (and belive me, there were
  quite a few (perhaps I should have made it shareware :-) )
  I've also now included 3 digitised pictures of the inside of my machine to
  help you along.

  4.0

  added text on running 2 hard drives
  added info on drives that work.
  converted to amigaguide and most parts have been re-written!

@Node WhatYouNeed "What You Need"

  What You Need
  =============

  1 x A1200 Amiga Computer (no shit!)

  1 x 44 Way HIGH DENSITY Female Connector

      (note,  these connectors and the cable are VERY hard to get hold of.
      i had to resort to buying a cable with the connectors already on it,
      I bought the cable from POWER COMPUTING for 10 Quid including 2
      connectors.  Trilogic also do one)

      Also make sure it is a HIGH DENSITY connector,  a normal 40way IDC
      connector WONT FIT,  like wise, the standard density ribbon cable also
      doesnt fit.

  1 x length of 40 way HIGHDENSITY Ribbon cable to connect to the 44Way
      Connector (the length depends on wether you want to mount the drive
      externally, I.E.  Short for intenally (10 inches or so) or long for
      externally (1 Metre or so)

      I wouldnt recommend using overlong cables as i dont
      know what the hell would happen to the integrity of you data as it
      wizzes past you 5000000000 other power cables behind the back of
      your desk!

      (note, you only need 40 way ribbon cable as the 4 power
      pins of the 44way connector arent used)

  1 x 40 Way IDC Standard Density Female Connector

  1 x 4 way Power Connector  (the type of this depends upon the type used on
      your hard disk as some hard disks have the same kind of connector
      that is used on the floppy drive others have the older (more
      standard on hard disks) type of connector, and others have BOTH!

  1 x 3.5 inch hard drive,  make sure that the current (AMP) ratings do not
      exceed that of your power supply or it'll blow something up.... :-(
      I.E.

         On the back of the hard disk it might say something like

         =====================
          Current consumption
         =====================
             +12V  0.4 A
              +5V 0.2 A
         =====================

         this would mean your PSU needs to provide this amount of power or more.
         (preferably more,  cos your computer eats some power and so does all
         your floppy disk drives/genlocks/digitizers/sound samplers/etc..)

         the output of the Amiga's power supply is shown on the underneath
         of the PSU,  there are various different amiga power supplys, all
         of which ARE interchangeable and ALL have different ratings.
         I've seen 2 different A500 PSU's and 2 defferent A1200 PSU's!!
         the best PSU so far is the lightweight A500 brick PSU as these
         tend to be a bit more reliable than the older A500 ones and can
         output more current than the A1200 ones, so if you've upgraded
         from an A500 and still have it lying around, swap it's PSU for
         the A1200's one!


      If your PSU doesnt supply enough power you will need to A) get one that
      does, B) Get a hard disk that doesnt eat much power or C) get a REGULATED
      +5 V and +12V Supply and connect it to the power pins of the hard drive.
      (pinouts of power pins are in file CABLE2.LBM)
      (note, any PSU out of a PC will do,  so if you've got a PC, rip it
      apart and nick the PSU from it (belive me, it's the only thing that
      PC's are useful for :-))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

  Also it might be an idea to get 2 of the power connectors that are used on the
  floppy drive so that you dont need to cut the wires and solder extra wires
  onto the existing ones, but these are not nessasary, they just make it neater


  Note:

  Female Connectors are the ones with the HOLES and male ones are the ones
  with the PINS.  (quite easy to remember really  :-)))

@EndNode

@Node MakingCables "Making The Cables"

  Making the cables
  =================

  First, get the 44way connector and crimp in the cable as pictured in CABLE.LBM
  then get the other end of the cable and connect each wire from the cable to
  each pin on the 40 way connector (also as pictured in CABLE1.LBM)
  Start from pin 1 on the 44 way and go upto pin 40, pins 41-44 are not used
  by the 3.5inch hard drive as the pins are +5V and ground. but no +12V

  Thats the fiddly bit done!!.

  Note: I have been told by some people that it's possible to heat the HD cable
  and stretch it to fit over the larger connector but I've not tried it..

  Now we need to supply the Hard Disk with some power,  so, get the power
  connector and then take the lead that connects the Floppy Disk drive to the
  mother board.  Then solder the wires from your connector to the wires on the
  lead making sure that you connect them correctly (as pictured in CABLE2.LBM)
  this is very important as these wires connect +12V and +5 volts to the drive.
  getting these the wrong way round will blow the hard drive! and possibly the
  computer.  Shorting them out is also NOT recommended :-)

  If you are using an external PSU for the Hard Disk then connect +12V, +5V and
  ground to the pins on the Hard Disk Power Connector.  (pins in CABLE2.LBM)

  And dont forget to turn on the hard drive BEFORE you turn on the computer.
  (but if you were clever you would take the +5v or +12v from the A1200 and connect
  it to a relay so that when you turn on your computer it would turn on the PSU to
  the drive..:)

  Trilogic make adaptors for 22 quid + p&p that do exactly the same as described
  above by the way,  so to save yourself hassle buy one of these, (even tho they
  are expensive for what you get...)

@EndNode

@Node Mounting "Mounting The Hard Drive"

  Mounting The Hard Drive
  =======================

  there are several places to mount the hard drive, one of which is externally
  in a box (you can get a simple project box from maplin that does the job
  nicely) or there are two places inside the 1200 that just about do the
  trick.

  One of them is at the far left hand side (viewed from the front), but you'll
  have to remove a peice of the metal shielding.  The second is just underneath
  the keyboard connector (you'll have to remove the small metal cover here to
  make it fit..) and remove a bit of the shielding.  If you look at INSIDE2.IFF
  you'll see where i've cut the shielding.  NOTE:  it is NOT ALWAYS necessary
  to cut the sheilding in the way I have done,  alot of people have rung me up
  saying that they have fit one without cutting the sheilding at all,  it all
  really depends on the hard drive's physical size,  the conner cp30256 drive
  fit's really snugly without cutting the sheilding.  try putting it in first
  if it doesn't fit then cut a bit of sheilding in the right place until it
  does fir :-)

  I've now heard from some austrailian chap that you can fit a 3.5" HD and a
  2.5" HD in without taking up the internal expansion slot and you still get
  the case on!!

  I, and several other people I know, have also mounted Hard Disks externally.
  The way it did it was to buy a Mini Tower Case (for about 58 quid including
  VAT and next day delivery from star computers if you are interested) and
  a long-ish bit of cable (but I wouldnt go over 1.5 meters if i were you
  or you'll get read write errors or other weird things happening to you)
  and feed it out the back of your 1200 where the floppy drive is and then
  into the Mini Tower via one of the back plane slots (or anywhere you see fit)
  and into the hard drive.  In doing this you solve your Power Supply problems
  because the mini tower i bought came with a nice 20AMP (200watt) power
  supply unit, complete with the correct connectors on it.  It also had a nice
  LED speed display which it set to 50Mhz to go with my '030 accellerator!
  and looks nice too.    Getting a mini tower case is much cheaper than buying
  one of those external hard drive boxes from trilogic that cost you about 75
  quid (ex postage) unless you dont have much space (i can tell you that my
  computer looks very inpressive sitting on my desk next to my monitor and
  mini tower case!!)

  You can also get an old external floppy drive case (as they are the same
  size as 3.5" hard disks and put it in that (you'll have to block the front
  up and route the cable out the back of the floppy drive port where the 23
  way connector normally goes tho :-)

@Node Preping "Preping and Formatting"

  Preping and Formating
  =====================

  You now need to get some HD Prep software,  this is availiable from COMMODORE
  and various other companies.  Most of the people who sell hard drives as kits
  will be able to sell the prep program to you.

  Microbotics have now realeased their HD prep software into the public domain and
  is known as RDPREP, availiable from any decent BBS or PD library.

  Basically a prep program just reads the info about the drive from the drive and
  lets you partition it.

  Note: each partition will eat up a certain amount of memory, so if you've only
  got 2 meg in your a1200 I wouldnt recomment more than 2 partitions.

  when you've preped and formatted your hard disk you should do a quick test to
  make sure every thing works,  first switch off your a1200 and the hard drive(s)
  if you have an external PSU,  then wait about a minute (it is IMPORTANT that you
  wait this long)  Then turn your computer back on and check that the partitions
  are still there via the boot up menu (hold down both mouse buttons on startup)

  If they are not there then your hard drive isnt compatiable with the A1200,
  quite a few drives seem to work fine until you switch your computer off and on
  again,  the western digital 40 and 340MB and the Maxtor 250MB ones do this along
  with a few others too.

  (See @{"the RESET line" link reset} for Important New Info)
@EndNode

@Node Reset "The RESET line"

  I've since found out that some drives (like the 2 mentioned in @{"Preping" link preping} and
  Formatting) need pin 1 (the Reset line) disconnected from the drive before
  they will work correctly (This is normally the red wire in the cable, or
  the wire nearest the front of the  A1200 (when looking at it from the top,
  with the floppy drive to the back))

  This gets some Conner and Western Digital drives working correctly (like the
  Caviar 140 and 2340)

  If you cant get a drive to work then you might try this out (you wont be able
  to damage the hard drive by the way!)

@Node Installing "Installing Workbench"

  Installing Workbench
  ====================

  Installing workbench 3.0 is DEAD EASY!

  make sure you've got at bootable formatted partition on your hard drive and
  then do the following.

  1) boot for your origonal Workbench 3.0 system disk.

  2) open a shell window

  3) enter these commands to make some programs resident

     resident C:COPY
     resident C:MAKEDIR

  4) then repeat this step for all your workbench 3.0 disks (system, locale
     and extras) except the FONTS DISK and the STORAGE DISK

     COPY DF0:#? DH0: ALL

  5) insert the workbench 3.0 FONTS disk into df0:

  6) then do these commands

     MAKEDIR DH0:FONTS

     COPY DF0:#? DH0:FONTS ALL

  7) then go to the workbench screen, double click your hard disk icon so
     that it shows the root directory of your hard disk then make a directory
     called "Storage" (don't enter the quotes!)

  8) then do these commands after inserting your Storage Disk in DF0:

     COPY DF0:#? DH0:Storage ALL

  9) all you need to do now is drag the correct keymap and printer drivers
     from the subdirectory in dh0:storage into the same subdirectory in
     dh0:devs. (E.G.  Dh0:storage/keymaps/gp dh0:devs/keymaps/gb)

  10) now reboot and go WOW!

  simple huh, although if you were watching the output from the copy
  command when you were copying the Locale Disk you would have noticed
  that we copied loads of catalogs and info for all sorts of different
  countries.  well, we only need the english ones so you can infact delete
  all the ones that you dont want.  I recommend the use of a File Manager
  program (such as my >>> EXCELLENT <<< AFCopy V3.4xx! (Plug Plug!)) to do
  this as it's a bit fiddly!

@Node WorkingDrives "Drives That Work"

  Drives That Work
  ================

  The following makes of hard drive have been known to work with the 1200 (note that
  some dont, so if you try before you buy then do so.)

  Western Digital Caviar Series (the best drives by miles!)
  Myself I've tested a caviar 140, 2250 and 2420 (40MB, 250MB and 420MB respectivly)
  other people have had the 2340 (340MB) working.  The 140 and the 2340 NEED to have
  pin 1 (RESET) cut to get them to work properly.

  Segate (not tried these myself but believe they are OK)
  Connor (all the ones where the model number starts 30xxx (Mines a 30245))
  (except the CP3044)  If i were you I'd avoid these drives like the plague, they
  dont seem to work with most other manufactures drives and they are DEAD slow, but
  they do fit easier!, typical huh ?)

  IBM drives,  some work, some don't.  Avoid these as they are not reliable.

  Quantum, I've got a Pro Drive LPS (104MB) quite old now and gets very hot and
  makes a noise,  I'm told by our PC engineer (from DCM) that these drive's (and
  any other quantum drives) are un-reliable and dont last long,  on the good side
  they are fairly quick,  the above drive does 1.2MB/sec on a stock 1200 with
  no fastram.  Also note, that I've got 2 Amiga's 1200's and it does not work
  on the newer one, Also not the it crashes the WB 3.0 version of HDtoolBox,  I had
  to use the Workbench 2.1 version of it.  This drive doesnt seem to work with
  western digital drives or conner drives.

  Any drive made by Hewlett Packard is a bad choice as anything HP do seems to be
  very non-standard compared to what everyone else does,  take for example thier
  HP vectra range of machines (the older ones, cant speak for the new ones.)
  They have the polorization pin on the 34way floppy drive connector on the other
  side from normal ones!


  If you can find a Western Digital drive that works, like the 250MB one, then
  go for that as these are by far the fastest drives and have low power
  consumption (which is good if you want to mount 2 hard drives! :-)

@Node NonWorkingDrives "Drives That Don't Work"

  Drives That Don't Work
  ======================

  Maxtor 250MB (not tried with the RESET pin disconnected)
  Fijitsu 100MB (mind you, it was 5 years old!)
  Some IBM drives
  Some JVC Drives
  Some HP drives
  Some Quantum drives
  Some Conner Drives (the 44MB one (CP3044) for instance!)

  (also see @{"Preping and formatting" link preping} and @{"the RESET line" link reset} )

@Node WhereFrom "Where to get drives from"

  Where to get drives from
  ========================

  The best place to pick up a cheap hard drive is from an add in micro mart,

  Star Computers, Delta Technology and Jupiter Computers.

  the best people to deal with are STAR, jupiter and delta are both VERY cheap
  but the service isnt so good.

  PLEASE when you ring these companies make sure that you specify the
  EXACT MAKE AND SIZE OF THE DRIVE YOU WANT AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE IT IN
  STOCK BEFORE PARTING WITH ANY MONEY or they might send you a maxtor when
  you ask for a western digital like jupiter computers did to me!

@Node Prices "Current Prices"

  Current Prices As Of 10/12/93
  =============================

  A Conner 250MB drive can be had from around 130-140 quid
  A western digital of the same size is generally 20-30 quid more

  (note: prices quotes are Ex-VAT and P&P)

@Node maxtrans "Max Transfer settings"

  Max Transfer settings
  =====================

  normally you wont have to change this unless you get file corruption when
  you save large files to your hard disk.

  to check this, copy a large .lha file to ram: (about 600K sould be
  enough) then copy this back to your hard disk and check the .lha file,
  if you get CRC errors or any other errors then it looks like you'll need
  to change it.

  So, to change this, go into HD toolbox and select "Partition Drive",
  then click on "Advanced options" then a button called "Change" will
  appear, click it,  now you get another screen full of buttons one of
  them will be a string gadget for the maxtransfer setting,  set this to
  about 128KB in HEX (0x1ffff) then save your changes, reboot and try the
  .lha test again, if works ok (it should do at this setting!) then
  keep doubling the maxtransfer rate until it fails, then go a bit lower
  until it works.  It's all a matter of trial and error really!
