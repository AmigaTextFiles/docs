@node WHAT "What is AClock?"


AClock is a receiver program for the DCF77 clock. AClock looks for the clock
data on the gameport or the parallelport depending on the setting of the
PORT @{"tooltype" link TOOL}. When AClock receives 2 valid minute informations it will
signal its main task to update the system and battery clock.

@node TOOL "Changing the configuration."

 PORT         Where is the hardware connected?
              - JOY6 = pin  6 on game port 2

              - JOY1 = pin  1 on game port 2
              - PAR  = pin 11 on parallel port
 WINX         X coordinate of AClocks window.

@node HIST "A look at the past."


		History:
		--------

1.00  * First real version, based on old code without any version numbering.

1.10  * Window width is now calculated better.
      * Now displays duration of incomming pulses. If it does not detect any
        signal for 3 seconds it displays ---. A 0 bit signal should take
        ~0.1 seconds and an 1 bit ~0.2 seconds. Because of my use of the
        vertical blanking interrupt the values displayed here are not
        very accurate but accurate enough to be used.
      * Fixed a problem with short pulses. If a 0 pulse was a bit short it
        would be missed.

1.20  * Removed dependency on VBlank interrupt frequency. The program now
        uses a self restarting timer.device software interrupt of ~100 Hz.
      * Added Info, Hide & Quit gadgets to main window.
      * Added amigaguide style documentation which can also be displayed
        using the Info gadget.

1.30  * Now has WINX & WINY tooltypes for window position.
      * Now has CX_PRI tooltype for Commodities priority.
      * Now has CX_POPUP tooltype to select startup with or without a window.
      * Now acts as a timeserver in an envoy network. Use TimeClient to get
        the time from a remote machine.
      * Now supports hardware on the parallelport aswell. (tooltype PORT=PAR)
      * Now comes with an install script.

1.31  * Added JOY4 hardware option
      * Changed JOY into JOY6
      * Added JOY1 hardware option. (untested)

@node FUTU "A look at the future."


		Future:
		-------

* AClock should have a popup hotkey and a tooltype to define it.

* AClock should support Locale and both the docs and the program texts
  should be translated.

* AClock should be able to use a time offset so users in different timezones
  can still use the program. There might be a problem with Daylight savings
  time not starting/stopping on the same dates.

* Aclock should display if it is Daylight savings time or not.

* AClock should display if the main or spare DCF77 antenna is used.
