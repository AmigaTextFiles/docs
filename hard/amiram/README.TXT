Since the RAM slots in the 4000 are, well, crap they don't hold the SIMMs in
old age. I had that problem with my 4000, but came up with the following
idea to make to ram stay in! If require the use of the little insulating
washers (the ones often used in IBuMs), or similar thickness material wedged
in the little clip. Its hard to explain so I included some pictures. Holds the ram 
in perfectly :) What do you think?

Hope this is of assistance to someone
