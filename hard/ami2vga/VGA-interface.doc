Just a short note for those wanting to build this.

The Amiga horizontal and vertical sync lines are used as inputs when
interfacing a genlock. If these lines are loaded too much, the amiga
will think that it has a genlock connected, and won't provide sync
signals. By buffering these lines, you will be able to hook up any 
monitor without problems. I chose a CMOS schmitt-trigger inverter
to buffer these lines to give the signals a nice sharp rise & fall 
time, as well as providing for sync inversion if necessary. 

The VGA interface is somewhat vague about which pins are used as grounds.
Different manufacturers use different pins, however, they all use pins
6, 7 & 8 (return grounds for Red, Green, & Blue). The diagram provided 
will work on 99% of the monitors out there without problems, and should
be used first. Otherwise consult the pinouts for your particular monitor.

When I built my interface, I put the 74HCT14 in the hood for the DB-23. 
There was more than enough space for the IC mounted on a piece of perf-
board along with the wires & capacitor. If you do not have a 74HCT14, 
almost any buffer or gate will do, but best results will be had with this
chip.  It is best to run all the ground wires seperately between the two
connectors, but it won't hurt it to combime them if you do not have enough
conductors in the cable you are using.  Be sure to double check your
connections!!!  If you wire this up incorrectly, you could permanently 
damage your Amiga. Good Luck.
