   Solving the acceleration problem of Western Digital hard drives


	 Well as a friend of mine I bought a 1 Gb Western Digital Caviar hard
drive by its fame of good  quality.  But the only problem  WAS that it didn't 
accelerate enoughly to boot. Argh. It really sux. Everytime I had to reset my
computer or use a lamy floppy with a program to slow the boot. Well I got bo-
red of all this  s**t and realize that It would need a hardware-solution.  
	If you  have a  Western  Digital hard drive,  a soldering iron,  some 
ability and courage to do it, the hack is very very simple: all you have to do
is to solder your hard drive power supply cable on the power supply connector
(female) inside the amiga.
	I STRONGLY Recommend you to insulate the zone .And voila'! Your WD hd 
will acellerate and boot nicely! Take a look at the enclosed picture WDHD.iff
.
If you want you can try to solder the wires under the board, at your own risk!!

Important: Doing this WILL void the warranty of you Amiga . I take no
responsability for ANY KIND OF DAMAGE on you or your equipment.
Try by YOUR OWN RISK!!!!
