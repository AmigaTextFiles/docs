              Parallel Port Input/Output Routines for C Programs


                                 Introduction

   These routines provide a convenient, consistant, and `system friendly',
assembly interface that allows C programs to manipulate the parallel port.
They allow low-level access to the port without the overhead of device I/O.
However, they have exclusive access to the port so while you use these
routines, other programs can not access the port.  The concept is based on an
article in AmigaMail, Jun 92, 4Play/read34.asm.

                                 Distribution

   This software is placed in the public domain and is freely distributable.
If you modify these routines and re-distribute them, please change the name of
the file and add a note that states the modifications are yours, not mine...

                                  Disclaimer

   If you use these routines, you use them at your own risk!  I am not
responsible for any damage that may occur as a result of using these routines!
This archive should contain the file "Port.txt" which provides an overview of
the parallel port as well as precautions when interfacing external hardware to
the parallel port.  Please read this!

      freeport -- Free  parallel port access
      portdir  -- Set   parallel port data direction      (0/1 = Input/Output)
      portddr  -- Set   parallel port data direction bits ($00-$FF)
      rdport   -- Read  parallel port data                ($00-$FF)
      wrport   -- Write parallel port data                ($00-$FF)
      busydir  -- Set   BUSY control line data direction  (0/1 = Input/Output)
      rdbusy   -- Read  BUSY control line state           (0/1 = Low/High)
      setbusy  -- Set   BUSY control line state           (0/1 = Low/High)
      poutdir  -- Set   POUT control line data direction  (0/1 = Input/Output)
      rdpout   -- Read  POUT control line state           (0/1 = Low/High)
      setpout  -- Set   POUT control line state           (0/1 = Low/High)
      seldir   -- Set   SEL  control line data direction  (0/1 = Input/Output)
      rdsel    -- Read  SEL  control line state           (0/1 = Low/High)
      setsel   -- Set   SEL  control line state           (0/1 = Low/High)
