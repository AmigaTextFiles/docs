@node "Einleitung" Introduction
Introduction
============         
 
Some time ago when I bought a remaining A2386 bridgeboard, I felt angry
that I should have to buy very expensive and aged ZIP ram. For 2 Megabytes 
ZIP ram I should pay 200 DM !!! 

I remembered having some old 1MB-PS2-Simms lying around and thought that there
should be a possibility to use them on my bridgeboard. 

The result of my thoughts and work is that little adapter which can be 
installed into the free ZIP sockets.

@node Beschreibung
Description
===========

After having finished the adapter, you will have to put him into the free ZIP
sockets of the A2386 bridgeboard. It is not possible, to continue using 
remaining ZIP rams, because the adapter is reserving all banks.

You are now able to use standard PS2-SIMMS (72 pins) on your bridgeboard. 
You may use simms with or without parity, it doesn't matter. EDO-SIMMs seem not 
to be work. So please don't use EDO-SIMMs. You damage nothing, but the Bridgeboard
don't work!

The following combinations of SIMMs are possible:


socket1 (@{"U1" link "bestueck_e.iff/MAIN"})   socket2  (@{"U2" link "bestueck_e.iff/MAIN"})  total memory   tested
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1MB-SIMM        not used        1MByte            X

1MB-SIMM        1MB-SIMM        2MByte            X

1MB-SIMM        4MB-SIMM        5MByte            X

4MB-SIMM        not used        4MByte            X

4MB-SIMM        4MB-SIMM        8MByte            X

8MB-SIMM        not used        8MByte            X


It is not necessary to change any jumper. Perhaps you will have to change your 
BIOS configuration to match the installed memory size.

I personally use two 4MB-SIMMS (60ns!!!) with the
BIOS configuration:

Page Mode      ENABLED
DRAM Wait States  0

@node Bauanleitung
How to build the adapter
========================

You need the following material:

- two PS2-SIMM sockets (72 pins) 
- of course the adapter pcb
- in total 41 @{"contact pins" link "stifte.jpg/MAIN"} (0.6mm diameter, precision!!, others won't fit!!!)
- a little bit of wire for 6 jumpers
- a little bit of synthetic resin or glue to fix the pins
  (synthetic resin which can be taken from car reparation kits fits very well!!)


Attention
=========

It's very difficult to solder the contact pins in the correct alignment !




Okay, let's start:

- First of all create a pcb layout using the postscript file @{" A2386_PS2.ps " link "a2386_ps2.ps/MAIN"} 
  or the HPGL file "A2386_PS2.HPGL" @{"Overview" link "top.iff/MAIN"}.
  
- Now take the layout to etch the pcb

- Then drill the needed holes (0.8mm). You don't need to drill all holes of the
  ZIP rams (that would be 320 holes!!), but only the 41 needed.
  
- Now you have to solder the contact pins from the solder side (bottom side).
  These have to stand off as much as possible from the pcb. To do so, please
  lay the pcb with the component side on a flat surface, mount the pins and
  solder them vertical. It is very, very important to solder them vertical, 
  otherwise they won't fit into the sockets of the A2386.
  The best way is you etch a "helping PCB" witch has some ZIP-Rows on it and
  drill all holes of this PCB. At soldering you fix the contact pins one by one
  with the "helping PCB". @{" scheme " link "einloeten_e.iff/MAIN"}

  
- Solder the 6 @{" jumpers " link "bestueck_e.iff/MAIN"} .

- Solder the two PS2 sockets normally (mounted on top, soldered on bottom side)
  @{"alignment" link "bestueck_e.iff/MAIN"}

- That's all !! 

Now you should try to install the pcb on your bridgeboard (see @{"Installation" link installation}).
In case the pcb should not fit correctly, because of some pins who aren't 
positionned absolutely vertical, there are two possibilities (a soft one and 
a 'brutal' one !):

1. (soft) Try to correct very cautious the bad alligned pins by the use of a
   solder tip until the pcb fits (very hard!).
   
2. (brutal) Take all your force and press the pcb into the sockets ! After this
   act of force you will find some pins being loose (the conductor will lose
   contact to the pcb). Don't panic!  Just fix the shaky pins by applying a
   little bit of glue from the component side on each hole:
   
   
   
   
                           
              _           _        
             / \         / \ <---- glue drop
   -----------|-----------|------ 
   -----------|-----------|------ <---- pcb
              |           |
              |           |
              |           |
              |           | <---- pin

@node Installation
Installation
============

The installation of the adapter is very simple, because he will only fit in one
position. Look for U302 on the bridgeboard and align the left uppermost pin
of the adapter to the left uppermost contact of U302. The most part of the pcb 
will lie on the the two great custom chips U401 and U402 (see @{"side view" link "seite_e.iff/MAIN"} ).

If these two custom chips should be mounted with sockets, you will probably have
difficulties, because the precision pins won't be long enough! If all fits well
the pcb should lie close to the BIOS Eprom (see @{"top view" link "lage_e.iff/MAIN"}).

Now you are ready to install your two PS2 simms. Please keep in mind, that you
always have to use socket 1 in first order (the socket which is closest to the
pins) (see @{"assembly" link Beschreibung} ). The bridgeboard should now work 
as usually !



Final consideration
===================
Some of you will have noticed (at latest when reinstalling the A2386) that the
whole construction has a very great height. You certainly will lose one  
Zorro connector! But most of the serious brigeboard users will certainly have
installed a PC(WC) graphics card which only uses the halve length, so this should
be no problem.

@node "Shareware" Shareware

If you build your adapter of your own by using this manual and if you are using
it successfully, you should pay the shareware fee, because I have spent a lot of
time creating it. If you consider how much money you may save with this manual,
I think the shareware is really acceptable! 
 
The shareware fee is @{"DM 20" link "nil"} via transfer on the following
banc account:

future projects
===============

@{B}Etherbridge.device:@{UB}

This is an SANA2-Network-Driver for AMIGA
witch makes you able to use PC-Network-Cards (ISA)
from a CMB A2x86-Bridgeboard on the AMIGA-Side!


@{B}Oktagon-PS2:@{UB}

It's very difficult to make such an Adapter for the Oktagon 2008
because you must use 2 SIMMs every time (you need 2 independent RAS and WE).
But on the Oktagon 2008 you have only place for 1 SIMM !!(Oktagon Layout)
That's why I give up this project!
