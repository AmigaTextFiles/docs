	This is a D.I.Y.  project for making an A4000 desktop to tower using
cheap materials from PC (such as AT PSU and PC tower).

     Read the Guide file (AmigaDIYtower.guide), the plain text file
(AmigaDIYtower.txt), the Final Writer file (AmigaDIYtower.fw) or the Wordworth
file (AmigaDIYtower.ww) for details.  The guide file has direct links with the
photos and schematics in the same directory, which show the conversion all the
way through.

     Same pictures are included in Final Writer and Wordworth documents.  You
may have to redirect manually the above programs to the location of the
pictures, because they are included as links and not as full graphics to keep
the size of the archive as small as possible.

   Also, there are 2 pictures of my workbench screen (1280x1024x16bit),
showing the great advantages of a gfx card:  My_workbench.jpeg and
My_Workbench2.jpeg
