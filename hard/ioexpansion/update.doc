Serial driver update documentation

This is a brief doc file describing some updated software for the
I/O expansion board described in the February Amazing Computing.
For technical information refer to the source code.

newser.device -- A new version of the driver itself offering
higher speed, bug fixes, and preferences support. Copy to your
devs: directory.

serprefs -- New version of the serial preferences program that is
now actually useful. Typically used to set up the serial port to
your liking before doing DOS-level output...most terminal
programs provide their own internal preferences, for better or
for worse. Copy to your c: directory (or anywhere else).

loadprefs -- Small program to load the preferences file
(s:serial-preferences) into memory. It is equivalent to running
the serprefs program and clicking on "Use". Copy to your c:
directory and put it in your startup-sequence, if desired.

How to contact the author (Dan Babcock)
=======================================

Thus far I haven't heard a peep from I/O board users. C'mon, I
know you're reading this! Why not drop me a letter, or a few
disks of software (I especially like megademos). Heck, even
consider supporting a poor college student with a modest
donation. Whatever your pleasure, send it to...

I'm also currently available on People/Link (DANBABCOCK) and
Usenet. For the latter, drop a note in
comp.sys.amiga.programming, or send mail to d6b@ecl.psu.edu.
