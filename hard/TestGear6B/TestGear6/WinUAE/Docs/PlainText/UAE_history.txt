IMPORTANT NOTICE: Picasso96 support in (Win)UAE would not be possible without
the support and generosity of Alexander Kneer and Tobias Abt. Please donate
to the Picasso96 team if you use P96 and UAE together.  NOTE: Amiga Forever
from Cloanto includes a full Picasso96 license already, which is even more
reason to support a long-time Amiga software company. Click on the Picasso96

How to use hdtoolbox with full harddisk images:
-----------------------------------------------

Create hardfile normally or use harddisk image from your real Amiga but clear all
hardfile parameters except block size.(sectors, surfaces and reserved)

HDToolBox must be run with "uaehf.device"-parameter ("tools/hdtoolbox uaehf.device")

Vsync-instructions:
-------------------
- works in fullscreen modes only
- select 50Hz or 100Hz refresh rate (PAL) or 60Hz/120Hz (NTSC)
- WinUAE skips every other frame if refresh rate is over 85Hz
- display driver must support refresh rate selection. VSync is not selectable
  if only available option in refresh rate selection box is "default"
- you can also select other refresh rates for "interesting" results :)
- your pc must be fast because missed frames will cause huge slowdown
- display emulation refresh rate must be set to "every frame"

Some display card test results:

- ATI Radeon/Radeon 8500, XP, 6052: refresh rate selection supported
- NVidia GF2, W2K, Detonator 27.52: refresh rate selection supported
- Matrox G400, W9x, 6.82.016: no refresh rate selection support (=no WinUAE vsync support)

CD32 emulation instructions:
----------------------------

Emulated:

- CDROM except CD audio fast forward and rewind (1) (2)
- 1Kb NVRAM (works just like console emulators' memory card)
- C2P
- Joypad (keys: /=RWD *=PLAY -=FFW 7=Green 9=Yellow 1=Red 3=Blue)
  You can use input-tab to configure pad mappings.

Notes:

- CD32 emulation mode is automatically activated when 512KB extended ROM is selected (ROM-tab)
- CD32 configuration: 68EC020,AGA,2MB chip,0 floppy drives
  (some games fail to load if number of floppy drives is > 0..)
- CD32's NVRAM (build-in 1024 byte flash RAM) file location can be specified in ROM-tab.
- CDXL animations looks quite bad. Better timing is needed.
- CD32 ROMs come with Amiga Forever 5.0 or you can dump then from floppy drive extended CD32.
  Don't ask me for ROMs!
- Windows 95/98/ME users: IOS.VXD bluescreen = updated ASPI drivers required..
- If you have CD32 CD images, you can use daemon tools (http://www.daemon-tools.com/) to mount them.

uaescsi.device instructions
---------------------------

- Makes your IDE ATAPI/SCSI CDROM drives available on Amiga side (1)
  Use Amiga CDFS, CDA players or CD burning software etc..
  (not tested with real SCSI drives)

Action Replay 1 / 2 / 3 instructions
--------------------------------

- You need AR 1, AR 2 or 3 ROM (see below for rip instructions)
- Set path to Action Replay ROM file (ROM-tab, cartridge ROM)
- Freeze button = Page Up
- Don't use AR support to save game states, use build-in state save option instead.
  (much faster and compatible)
- WARNING: Action Replay don't like fast Amigas or 68020+ CPUs
  and max supported fast ram is 4MB.

Action Replay ROM Ripping instructions:

 Find A500 with Action replay-cardrige,
 press 'freeze'-button, write following:

 AR 1:

 lord olaf<RETURN>

 AR 2 and 3:

 may<RETURN>
 the<RETURN>
 force<RETURN>
 be<RETURN>
 with<RETURN>
 you<RETURN>
 new<RETURN> (AR 3 only)
 
 insert empty floppy disk into DF0:

 AR1: "sm ar1.rom,f00000 f10000"
 AR2: "sm ar2.rom,400000 420000"
 AR3: "sm ar3.rom,400000 440000"
 transfer ROM image to your PC

______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.17 Release 1
==============================================================================
- FIXED:   Various AGA and chipset-related fixes. (Bernd#1, Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   .GZ support in floppy dialog doesn't cause corruption. (Timothy)
- FIXED:   Updated sprite-collision logic which fixes Leander, Archon 1 and 2,
           Menace, etc. (Toni)
- FIXED:   Updated disk-emulation code, for higher compatability.  Also now
           supports .fdi and high-density .adf images. (Toni, Adil Temel)
- FIXED:   60Hz support in Dynablaster and BC Kid (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   BSD-Socket emulation is mostly working, although bugs still exist.
           (Bernd#3)
- FIXED:   Picasso96 screens smaller than their display-mode would have crap
           in their left-hand-border if you grabbed the screen's title-bar and
           moved the screen to the right.
- FIXED:   Updated copy of rtg.library, including more patches. (Bernd#3)
- FIXED:   You can set the WinUAE resolution in full-screen to whatever you
           desire.  Especially useful so that you set your full-screen size to
           match your desktop size, and it will prevent all your desktop icons
           from moving around after exitting WinUAE. (me, Georg)
- FIXED:   Stupid sound_channels=0 stuff in config-files works properly.
- FIXED:   Stupid gfx_center_xxx=yes/no stuff in config-files works properly.
- FIXED:   Selecting an item in the Hard Drives page of the GUI and then
           moving its position in the list now leaves the item highlighted.
- FIXED:   Detect OS version early, and inform the user appropriately instead
           of crashing.  Windows NT is no longer a supported OS for WinUAE.
- FIXED:   Various little off-by-one pixel errors in the GUI.
- FIXED:   MIDI in/out lists in the Ports page of GUI were behaving strangely.
- FIXED:   Floppy-disc emulation change to allow Shadow of the Beast Trainer
           to work. (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED:   Small change in MIDI support so that closing MIDI and then
           reopening it will work properly. (Bernd Roesch)
- FIXED:   Call ahi_install in main.c.  No Amiga-side AHI driver yet.
- FIXED:   MIDI-input doesn't have the concept of a "default device", unlike
           MIDI-output.  Changed the GUI and programming accordingly.
- FIXED:   MIDI-output now does the right things with the serial-port after
           each written byte, which allows some other programs to finally
           work (MusicX, Deluxe Music, etc.)
- ADDED:   New hook function in uaelib for checking on removable drive state.
- ADDED:   Disk-change status is now tracked via WM_DEVICECHANGE notifications
           which allows "run >nil: uaediskchange cd0:" in the startup-sequence
           to work properly.  Eject a CD-ROM, and the Amiga knows about it.
           Insert a new CD-ROM, and the Amiga knows about it.  Woo-hoo!
           NOTE: Probably really buggy.
- ADDED:   New collision-modes, fast-copper mode (not save-able with config).
- ADDED:   State-save support. (Toni Wilen)
- ADDED:   Option in Sound page of GUI to enable/disable synchronized sound.
- ADDED:   Printing of DDCAPS info for display-driver, to help diagnostics.
- ADDED:   FDI disk-image support (Toni Wilen)
- CHANGED: Tweaked the sound-code yet again, hopefully will get less out of
           sync.  (Jose Gil, myself)
- CHANGED: Add PC Drives no longer adds the floppy-drives.  If you want access
           to A:, then you'll have to add it manually in the GUI.
- CHANGED: Added ability to allocate larger amount of ZorroIII memory. 
           (Bernd#3)
- CHANGED: Added ability to allocate larger amount of RTG (Picasso96) memory.
           (Bernd#3)
- CHANGED: Removed Vertical Blank Synchronization (VSync) support in Flip
           calls.  This should increase synchronization and performance in
           full-screen mode, but may introduce some tearing/artifacting.
- CHANGED: Use the system "hand" cursor when pointing at web-links in the
           About page (if available). (Oscar Sillani)
- CHANGED: Use Tahoma font in About page of GUI.
- CHANGED: Use up/down icons in the HardDisk page of GUI. (Oscar Sillani)

- ADDED: Sprite-collisions can be enabled/disabled during emulation, not just
         at startup.
- ADDED: Patched rtg.library added to package, which should fix the mouse trails.
         (Thanks to Tobias Abt and Alexander Kneer of P96, and Bernd Roesch).
		 This file (rtg.library) will end up in the "Amiga Programs/" directory
		 under the "WinUAE/" directory where you install to.
- ADDED: German keymap (UAE_German)
- ADDED: uaediskchange utility
- ADDED: French and German DLLs updated, Italian DLL added.  (Thanks Georg V,
         FagEmul, and Daniele G)
- CHANGED: Tweaked the sound code again, memory-leak should be gone, performance
           should be better - expect a speed decrease when using JIT and sound.
- CHANGED: Graphics glitches caused by NOVSYNC flipping should be gone in full-
           screen mode.
- REMOVED: Turkish DLL, as it was out-of-date
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.16 Release 2
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Stupid shift-key issue (me)
- FIXED: Should be back to 50Hz at A500 speed emulation, so audio latency should
         be reduced or non-existant. (me)
- FIXED: Graphics-updates may work now on Voodoo cards (Toni, me)
- FIXED: Updated file-version info in WinUAE.exe resource. (Georg)
- FIXED: Bug with version-number checking and GUI DLLs (Georg)
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.16 Release 1
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Better 040 compatibility (Toni, Bernd#3, Gwenole)
- FIXED: Even more 040 and debugger compatibility (Toni, Bernd#3, Gwenole)
- FIXED: Fixed the cleanup_sound() routine to not crash on some systems (Andreas)
- FIXED: AGA support (Toni)
- FIXED: Don't die on CPUs (Cyrix) which don't have rdtsc instruction
- FIXED: Printing from within FinalWriter (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Graphics printing should work now. (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Translated GUI libraries are only loaded if their version number is
         0.8.16.1 now, so that the GUI is consistent across languages for a
         given WinUAE version.
- FIXED: Horizontal/vertical lines are 2x faster in Picasso96 (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Floppy disk emulation tweaks (Toni Wilen)
- FIXED: Auto-activation of WinUAE window is smarter now.
- FIXED: Bug with flipping surfaces in DirectDraw.  If the flipping-pair was
         not properly created (say the primary was in video-ram, but the
         secondary was in system-ram) and cannot be flipped, we tried to
         flip anyways.  This would fill up the log with flip-failure reports.
- FIXED: Infinite loops when GetBytesPerPixel fails.  Still looking into why
         GetBytesPerPixel fails in some weird circumstances.
- FIXED: "more compatible" string in CPU page of GUI is no longer too long.
- FIXED: Mouse-pointer reappears when message-boxes pop up.
- FIXED: Mouse-button state isn't kept across screen-mode changes (Bernd#3)

         This fixes the icon overwrite problem when installing OS 3.5 and 3.9.
         (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Added a hack for volume-names of "AmigaOS3.5" and "AmigaOS3.9" to be
         used even though Windows shows "AmigaOS35" and "AmigaOS39". (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Make sure that the Windows mouse-pointer is not active on an Amiga
         screen-mode switch. (Bernd#3)
- FIXED: Fixed timing problems on SpeedStep mobile processors, due to their
         strange RDTSC implementation being variable.  Instead, use the OS
         provided QueryPerformanceCounter(), which actually works but
         has much lower resolution.
- FIXED: Framerate reporting. (Toni)
- FIXED: Maximum number of Picasso96 screen-modes is increased.
- FIXED: Screen refresh bug when minimizing/maximizing full-screen Amiga gfx.

- FIXED: Stupid frames-per-second bug whenever the GUI has been displayed.
- FIXED: Graphics garbage at bottom of Amiga screens whenever the GUI is
         displayed and moved around (in windowed-mode).
- FIXED: Enabling "Show LEDs in full-screen" once running didn't actually work.
- FIXED: Speed of emulation is no longer "crazy" when sound is disabled.
- FIXED: Crashing with certain .uae config-files, including default.uae.

           physical printer-port.  You MUST have a printer-driver on the Amiga
           side that matches your actual printer.
- REMOVED: Ability to adjust the floppy-disk speed.  This "feature" doesn't
           exist in the core UAE version, and can also cause incompatabilities.

WinUAE 0.8.14 Release 3 (the Stupid release)
==============================================================================
- FIXED: Stupid bug with GUI (F12) when in full-screen mode.
- FIXED: Stupid Picasso96 slow-down in Release 2

- FIXED: Sound-buffer slider gets disabled when no audio output is selected.
- FIXED: German GUI DLL is accurate now. (Thanks Georg)
- ADDED: Flicker-free Amiga screen updates when full-screen.  Doesn't affect
         Picasso96 screens, though.
- CHANGED: Sound output tweaked again, should be "slightly" better.
______________________________________________________________________________
WinUAE 0.8.14 Release 1
==============================================================================
- FIXED: When WinUAE is full-screen, the Message dialog-box no longer "hides"
         and locks up WinUAE.  Instead, WinUAE will automatically minimize
         itself and display the dialog-box on the Windows Desktop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For general information about the core UAE platform, refer to:

http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/

This readme file does _not_ cover the features of UAE that are common to
all versions. If you're not familiar with UAE yet, consulting the generic
distribution before attempting to use this port might actually not be a
bad idea.

The generic UAE documentation can be found in the docs directory of this
archive. Take these docs with a grain of salt, though: Not every detail of the
Linux documentation pertains to WinUAE, and vice versa.

The latest release of UAE for Win32 is available from:
http://www.winuae.net/

Also, excellent English *and* German help-files in Compiled HTML Manual (.chm)
format can be found at http://www.winuae.net/download.htm.  Many thanks
to Georg Viechtlbauer for his help with this!

If you are using Windows 95 (shame on you!) and don't have DirectX
installed yet, you need to grab and install a copy first. UAE works
with older versions of DirectX, so chances are that you won't have
any problems if you had installed a DirectX game on your machine at
least once.

There are no problems running WinUAE under Windows 2000 and XP - in fact,
Win2K or XP is the best platform to run WinUAE on - providing the best
graphics and network performance, as well as core emulation duties.

Windows NT 4.0 is not supported

| BUG REPORTS VIA EMAIL: Please make sure that the following conditions are
| met before you report any kind of problem:
|
| (1) You are using the latest version of WinUAE
| (2) You have read the documentation (90% of all potential questions are
|     answered thoroughly in the this readme file)
| (3) You have used your brain
| (4) The graphics drivers of your systems are up-to-date 
|
| If you do write me, _always_ state what version of UAE your feedback is
| pertaining to. Include all the necessary information, e.g. the command
| line options you are using.
|
| Do _not_ send me warez of any kind, no matter how non-working they are.
| Do _NOT_ ask me for ROM-files, warez, etc.

1. Command Line Parameters
==========================
UAE's command line options are now quite hidden, since we're a true
Windows application now (and not a console-application).

The most important one is:
  -config=configfile.uae
or this will also work:
  -f configfile.uae

which will cause WinUAE to load the saved config-file (which is just
ASCII format anyways).

2. File-System Specifics
========================
UAE will try its best to bridge the gap between Microsoft and Tripos file
system semantics, but there are some inherent limitations:

1. The Windows "read only" flag controls the w and d bits on the Amiga side
2. r and e are always set
3. h, s and p cannot be set
4. The a flag is preserved
5. File comments are not supported
6. Not all file names that are "forbidden" under the lame Windows fs are
   being handled correctly yet. The most common ones, however, are.

Beware: UAE does _not_ live in a chroot-like environment! There is no
checking for accesses to directories above the mount point. Do not
assume that your data is absolutely safe from rogue Amiga programs!

3. Keyboard Emulation
=====================
Most of your keyboard retains its regular functionality under UAE, but
there are a few notable exceptions:

- if you don't have a Win95 keyboard, you'll have to use Ins/Home as a
  replacement for Left Amiga/Right Amiga (this is different from other
  versions of UAE).
- HELP has been remapped to Page-Down
- F12 brings up the GUI
- Shift+F12 brings up the GUI-based debugger
- Scroll Lock toggles screen refresh, speeding up the emulation
- Pause toggles sound, speeding up the emulation (note that you can't
  enable sound this way if you haven't configured UAE to run with sound
  from the beginning).
- End+F1, F2, F3 or F4 allows you to change disks in one of the four
  Amiga disk drives. Shift+End+F1...F4 ejects the disk.

The keyboard replacements for an Amiga joystick are as follows:

                 a              b            c
Up            Keypad 8      Cursor Up        T
Down          Keypad 2     Cursor Down       B
Left          Keypad 4     Cursor Left       F
Right         Keypad 6     Cursor Right      H
Fire          Keypad 0      Right Ctrl    Left Alt

WinUAE supports gzip-compressed disk images if you have zlib.dll.

Windows 2000/XP users: Using the compression feature of NTFS instead
of gzip is a good idea if you wish to save space and be able to write
to the ADF files at the same time.

3. Performance Issues
=====================
On a sufficiently powerful PC, UAE will give you quite an authentic
flashback into a (better?) past.

Thanks to DirectX, the raw drawing throughput of this version will be
among the highest of all Intel ports. 800x600 is only about 20% slower
than 320x200 on my Pentium 100, although it requires more than seven
times as many bytes per second to be pumped across the PCI bus. UAE's
native display depth is 16 bpp. This table shows how the net drawing
speed is affected by your display type:

16 bpp full screen - 100%
16 bpp desktop     -  98% 
24 bpp desktop     -  72%
32 bpp desktop     -  60%

Sound is a luxury. Because sound output is strictly synchronized with
video DMA, you _won't_ get clean sound _unless_ your machine is capable
of running at 50 fps at least internally.

Rule of thumb: Get a PPro or Pentium II if you want full graphics and
full sound at the same time (reportedly, the Pentium MMX 200 MHz,
overclocked to 250 MHz [83.3 MHz bus speed], is a powerful platform
for running UAE. I have no definite reports about the K6 and the M2 yet,
but these should do pretty good as well.).

On a Pentium 100 equipped with a Matrox Millennium, UAE-Win32/DirectX
is slightly faster than the Linux version under AcceleratedX for programs
that perform a _lot_ of screen updates, i.e. action games and demos.
All other things should run at roughly the same speed.

4. Compatibility
================
The number of programs that don't run properly under UAE decreases with
every new release. If you find a piece of software to require special
treatment, please let me know. I have received copies of pirated software
in my email in the past. Never ever do this to me.

Consult compatibility.txt for tips on how to get software running and a
growing collection of user-submitted parameters.

A few broken programs require instruction prefetch and/or exception 3
to be emulated (e.g.  Shadow of the Beast I, Katakis and Denaris). These
can be forced to run by playing with the "compatible-mode" CPU-flag in
the CPU-settings section of the GUI.
