<CENTER><B>A Single Tone, CTCSS, DCS, SELCALL, DTMF, 2 TONE And VOICE Encoder</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<U>Overview:-</CENTER></U><BR>
<BR>
<P>  This program is a generator of the various tone signals required to
  unmute professional radio gear. It is used to generate the five main
  code modes used on such gear:-
</P><BR>
  1) CTCSS, Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System.<BR>
  2) DCS, (CDCSS), Digital Controlled Squelch.<BR>
  3) SELCALL, Selective Calling.<BR>
  4) DTMF, Dual Tone Modulation Frequency.<BR>
  5) 2 Tone.<BR>
<BR>
  Other extras are part of the software and will be explained later.<BR>
<BR>
  It is beyond the scope of this manual to explain how the different
  methods work but suffice it to say that different countries use
  different modes and all are equally as good for muting radio gear.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=BLUE><I>
  It is worth noting that the DCS mode will NOT work with AC coupled AM/FM
  modulators of professional RF signal sources. For DCS to work the RF
  signal source MUST have some kind of DC coupled AM/FM modulator. These
  signal sources are seriously expensive. Therefore the average AMATEUR
  can ignore the DCS information if he/she so desires.<BR></I></FONT>

<BR>
<BR>
 <CENTER><U>Minimum Requirements:-</CENTER></U>
<BR>
<BR>
  1) A PC running Windows 95 or higher which meets the requirements of
     WinUAE.  A Pentium 2 @ 233MHz or greater with 64Mb memory and soundcard
     should be sufficient.<BR>
     Note that the performance of WinUAE will depend on on the PC hardware and
     Operating system.  Amiga sound emulation is a CPU intensive task. <BR>
  2) Latest version of WinUAE.  At time of writing this was 0.8.22 release 9
     Freely downloadable from <A HREF="http://www.majestic.ndirect.co.uk/">
this site</A> or one of them any WinUAE download sites available.<BR>
  3) AmigaOS 2.0x or higher ROM image (not included with WinUAE).  Can be
     obtained from a real Amiga, or purchasing Cloanto's Amiga Forever package.
  4) Amiga OS 2.0x or higher installed and running on WinUAE.<BR>
  5) A 2.3mm stereo to RNC or BNC audio cable (see Hardware-UAEcable for
     instructions).<BR>
  6) A VERY high quality RF signal source, I.E. RF test set/signal generator.<BR>
  7) ~narrator.device~, ~translator.library~ and ~speak-handler~ ARE a must.<BR>
  8) A wristwatch with a second hand on it for calibrating.<BR>

<CENTER><U>Setting Up WinUAE and the hardware</CENTER></U>
<BR>
<BR>
  1) Obtain a suitable cable to connect the 3.5mm stereo jack of the computer
     soundcard to the RF signal generator's external modulation input (usually
     a BNC connector).<BR>
     You can also construct a cable using the included instructions.<BR>
  2) Either use the included WinUAE configuration file, or use it as an example.
     See the inclued screenshots which will help with the setup of WinUAE.<BR>
     The audio compatibility settings are the most important, as the sond must
     be correctly emulated for selcall encoding to work.<BR>
     Some parameters of WinUAE may need to be set specifically for your PC,
     depending on the OS used, and the hardware.<BR>
  3) Encoder does not require workbench to run, but it does require a number of
     standard system libraries, handlers, devices and fonts to be present.<BR>
     Therefore the standard Workbench 2.x or higher must be installed.<BR>
  4) Run WinUAE.  Encoder can be started either from a CLI (shell) prompt, or
     from a workbench icon.  A grey window with "please wait" should appear.<BR>
     If this does not happen, copy the libraries from this archive into LIBS:
     and try again.<BR>
  5) Set up and use the program as detailed below.  The the audio output does not
     appear on the RF signal generator, check your cables and connectors.<BR>
     If the soundcard does not appear to generate any output, be sure the Windows
     soundcard drivers are working correctly.<BR>
     Also see the additional text files on setting up and controlling WinUAE.<BR>

  8) Pressing the ~C~ key will disable the CTCSS mode if required.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="50%" COLOR=BLACK>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><U>Setting The Software DCS Mode:-</CENTER></U>
<BR>
<BR>
  1) Press the ~b~ key from the main command screen.<BR>
  2) Using the line that appears enter a DCS 3 digit octal code and
     press ~RETURN/ENTER~.<BR>
  3) If ~ENTER/RETURN~ is pressed ONLY, then the DCS mode is disabled
     and normal keyboard command input resumes.<BR>
  4) When the next line appears press any key to go to software DCS
     control. If ~H~ is pressed then hardware DCS is activated and
     hardware needs to be connected to the AMIGA, see the ~DCS~ Drawer.<BR>
  5) When the next line appears use the keyboard to set the output level.
     If ANY key is pressed the the output is set automatically set to 20%.<BR>
  6) The ~o~ and ~O~ keys INCREASE/DECREASE the output level.<BR>
  7) The ~Del~ key exits the variable output control at the level
     shown on the display.<BR>
  8) After 7) is done normal keyboard command input resumes.<BR>
  9) The 23 bit binary DCS word is displayed.<BR>
 10) Pressing the ~B~ key will disable the DCS mode if required.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR SIZE=2 WIDTH="50%" COLOR=BLACK>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><U>Setting The SELCALL Mode:-</CENTER></U>
<BR>
<BR>
  1) Press the ~s~ key from the main command screen.<BR>
  2) Using the line that appears enter a tone length as shown and press
     ~RETURN/ENTER~.<BR>
  3) If ~ENTER/RETURN~ is pressed ONLY, then the SELCALL mode is disabled
     and normal keyboard command input resumes.<BR>
  4) Using the lookup table provided enter EACH frequency in turn for
     the tone format required. If another format is required then YOU
     will have to provide the look up table for yourself.<BR>
<BR>
A) Any number of frequencies up to a maximum of 64 can be entered.<BR>
B) ~0~ is considered to be a single tone length gap.<BR>
C) If an intersequence gap is required then calculate the number
        of INDIVIDUAL ~0(s)~ to be entered using the calculation:-<BR>
<BR>
               (Intersequence gap time)/(Single tone length)<BR>
<BR>
        e.g. (Intersequence gap time) = 0.5S<BR>
             (Single tone length) = 50mS = 0.05S<BR>
<BR>
        Therefore.......       0.5/0.05 = 10<BR>
<BR>
        So you would enter ~0~ ten times, (a little cumbersome but it
        is fully functional).<BR>
<BR>
	D) ~RETURN/ENTER~ on its own at the end of the string terminates
        that string and immediately sends it to the audio ports.<BR>
<BR>
  5) Pressing the ~S~ key will disable the SELCALL mode if required.<BR>

<CENTER><U>Useful Hints And Tips:-</CENTER></U>
<BR>
<BR> 
  1) If you think that the software has ~LOCKED UP~ then try pressing:-<BR>
     A) The ~Del~ key first. You may be in a control loop, as for
        example the CTCSS output level control loop.<BR>
     B) The ~Space Bar~ this will RESET to the ~Default/User~ setup.<BR>
     C) The ~m~ key to switch ON the single tone.<BR>
     D) In that order only.<BR>
  2) Set the RF generator modulation input control to give the correct<BR>
     deviation - 15% on the single tone ONLY, for example if the
     system deviation under test is 2.5KHz then set the RF signal
     generator to approximately 2.1KHz to allow for CTCSS or DCS to
     be added if required.<BR>
  3) The synthesised male and female VOICES do a good job of finding
     ~falsing~ and ~chopping~ problems with two way radio gear and helps
     in adjusting DCS and CTCSS levels.<BR>
  4) Only one multitone and/or one sub-audible tone can be used at any
     one time. This is the same for two way radio gear also.<BR>
