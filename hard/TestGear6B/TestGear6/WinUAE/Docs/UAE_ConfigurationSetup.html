<P>This is version 0.8.22 of UAE, the Un*x Amiga Emulator.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Versions numbered 0.8.x are beta versions, to be used for development
only.<BR>
If you are only a user of UAE, you are better off using the latest 0.7.x<BR>
version or waiting for 0.9.0.</P>

<P>Overview<BR>
========</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>An emulator is a program which enables you to run software for a machine<BR>
which has non-native hardware and a non-native operating system, on your<BR>
computer.  UAE allows you to run most of the available Amiga software. It
is a<BR>
software emulation, meaning that no extra or special hardware is needed to
do<BR>
this. The hardware of an Amiga is emulated accurately, so that Amiga software<BR>
is tricked into thinking it is running on the real thing, with your computer's<BR>
display, keyboard, harddisk and mouse taking the parts of their emulated<BR>
counterparts.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>UAE was developed for Unixoid systems. Meanwhile, it has been ported to
the<BR>
Mac, DOS, the BeBox, NextStep, the XFree86/OS2 environment and the Amigas
(it<BR>
can run itself by now). You should have received several other files along<BR>
with this document with details on how to install and use the version for
your<BR>
operating system.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>This section is just what it says: an overview. Please read _all_ of this<BR>
file, especially if you have problems. UAE has many, many features and<BR>
equally many configuration options. If you don't know about them, it's likely<BR>
that UAE doesn't work for you, or doesn't work as good as it could.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Please read also the file &quot;FAQ&quot; which contains some Frequently
Asked<BR>
Questions (and even the answers!) You should also look for a document<BR>
describing the specific port of UAE to the operating system you are using,<BR>
for example &quot;BeOS/README&quot; or &quot;DOS/README&quot;.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>People have complained that the UAE documentation contains only &quot;weird
jargon&quot;.<BR>
Sorry about this. Despite what MessySoft and Tomato tell you, computer<BR>
programs aren't always easy to use. UAE does require some assistance from
you,<BR>
and therefore you should at least understand a bit about computers. After
all,<BR>
you are an Amiga fan, so you should know what a Workbench is, don't you think?</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Features<BR>
========</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>This version of UAE emulates:</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>- A 68000, 68010 or 68020 CPU, optionally a 68881 FPU<BR>
- OCS Graphics Chipset, plus big blits from the ECS Chipset<BR>
- Up to 2MB Chip RAM and up to 8MB Fast RAM, or 8MB Chip RAM without Fast
RAM<BR>
- Up to 64MB Zorro III Fast RAM, independent of Chip RAM setting (68020 only)<BR>
- Up to 1MB Slow RAM, for extended compatibility with problem software<BR>
- Up to 8MB of graphics card memory, usable by software that supports<BR>
  Picasso 96 compatible graphics cards<BR>
- 4 x 3.5&quot; floppy disk drives (DF0:, DF1:, DF2: and DF3:). It's not
possible to<BR>
  read Amiga disks, so these are emulated with disk files.<BR>
- A hard-disk: either a harddisk image file or part of the native filesystem<BR>
- Joystick support (with option of mapping joystick to numeric keypad)<BR>
- Mouse support<BR>
- Ability to run in various screen modes (for better display quality or<BR>
  better speed)<BR>
- Full stereo sound support, consisting of 4 x 8bit channels<BR>
- Beta parallel and serial port support<BR>
- some other things which don't work well enough to mention them here...</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>  <BR>
Requirements (IMPORTANT! READ THIS!)/Limitations<BR>
================================================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Not emulated:<BR>
- Sprite to playfield collisions (sprite to sprite collisions work)<BR>
- An MMU (part of 68030/040 CPUs except those that Commodore used). This
means<BR>
  you can't use virtual memory systems or real operating systems like Linux<BR>
  or BSD.<BR>
- The AGA chipset (A4000/A1200). This chipset has enhanced capabilites for<BR>
  up to 256 colors in all resolutions.<BR>
- Serial port emulation exists but doesn't work too well.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Since the PC floppy controller can't read Amiga disks (yes, that's a fact),
<BR>
floppy access has to be emulated differently: Floppies are emulated by means
<BR>
of disk files that contain a raw image of the floppy disk you want to emulate.<BR>
A disk file is an image of the raw data on an Amiga floppy disk, it contains<BR>
901120 bytes (880K), which is the standard capacity of an Amiga disk.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>To actually run the program, you'll need to install the ROM image from
your<BR>
Amiga. You can't run UAE if you don't have this image. It is not included<BR>
because it is copyrighted software. Don't ask me to send you one. I won't.<BR>
If you don't have an Amiga and still want to use UAE, you'll have to buy
an<BR>
Amiga or at least the system software (ROM + Workbench) first.<BR>
The Kickstart image can have a size of either 256K or 512K. It must be named<BR>
&quot;kick.rom&quot; by default.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Read the section &quot;tools&quot; below for information how to create
ROM images and<BR>
disk files.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>If you don't have a Kickstart file, you may still be able to boot some
games<BR>
and demos. The emulator includes some primitive bootstrap code that will
try<BR>
to read and execute the bootblock of the diskfile you are using, and if that<BR>
bootblock only uses the one or two Kickstart functions that are supported
by <BR>
the &quot;replacement Kickstart&quot;, your program will boot. Don't expect
too much, <BR>
though.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>You'll also need some other software to run - why else would you want
to<BR>
emulate an Amiga? There are several ways to make the software accessible
to<BR>
UAE, either with disk image files or with a harddisk emulation. You should<BR>
make an image of your Amiga's Workbench disk and install it as &quot;df0.adf&quot;<BR>
(adf = Amiga Disk File) when you use UAE for the first time. More about how<BR>
to create these files in the chapter &quot;Transferring software&quot;</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>To use Picasso96 emulation, you need the Picasso96 libraries, which are
also<BR>
not included. They can be obtained (e.g.) from Aminet.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Invoking UAE<BR>
============</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>First, read the system-specific documents for information how to set up
UAE.<BR>
You should have an executable program called &quot;uae&quot;. You can simply
execute it,<BR>
but you can also optionally give it one or more of the following parameters:</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P> -h              : Print out a help text.<BR>
 -f file         : Load a configuration file<BR>
 -s opt=val      : Set the emulator's option &quot;opt&quot; to value &quot;val&quot;.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Configuration files consist of several lines of the form &quot;opt=val&quot;,
just as<BR>
with the &quot;-s&quot; parameter.  You can use the following options with
the &quot;-s&quot;<BR>
option, or in a config file.<BR>
[Here, &quot;=n&quot; means the option takes a number as value.  &quot;=bool&quot;
means the option<BR>
takes a value of either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; (or &quot;true&quot;,
&quot;false&quot;, or abbreviations of<BR>
any of these).  There are other classes as well.]</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>General options:<BR>
accuracy=n [default=2]<BR>
  Set emulator accuracy to n. The default is n = 2, which means the<BR>
  emulator will try to be as accurate as possible. This no longer<BR>
  does much in this version, and I'll probably remove it.<BR>
framerate=n [default=1]<BR>
  Sets the frame rate to 1/n. Only every nth screen will be drawn.  Using
a<BR>
  higher value can speed up the emulator, at the expense of graphics quality.<BR>
autoconfig=bool [default=yes]<BR>
  If this is enabled, all expansion devices provided by the emulation will
be<BR>
  automounted. You should only disable this if you have a Kickstart ROM<BR>
  earlier than 1.3 which can't cope with this. Some badly written games and<BR>
  demos might also be incompatible with this.<BR>
kbd_lang=lang [default=us]<BR>
  Set the keyboard language. Currently, the following values can be used:
&quot;us&quot;<BR>
  for U.S. keyboard (default), &quot;se&quot; for swedish, &quot;fr&quot;
for french, &quot;it&quot; for<BR>
  italian, &quot;es&quot; for spanish, or &quot;de&quot; for german keyboard.<BR>
  This setting only affects the X11 version.<BR>
floppy0=file [default=df0.adf]<BR>
  Try to use the specified file as diskfile for drive 0 instead of df0.adf.<BR>
  The options floppy1, floppy2, and floppy3 also exist.<BR>
kickstart_rom_file=file [default=kick.rom]<BR>
  Use the specified file instead of kick.rom as Kickstart image.<BR>
joyport0=mode [default=mouse]<BR>
  Specify how to emulate joystick port 0. You can use &quot;mouse&quot;,
&quot;joy0&quot;, or<BR>
  &quot;joy1&quot; to use the corresponding input devices of your machine,
or you can<BR>
  select several different keyboard replacements for a joystick:<BR>
    &quot;kbd1&quot; for the numeric pad.  '0' is the fire button.  Three
keys on the<BR>
           numeric pad act as autofire toggle: '.' (or ',' depending on your<BR>
           keyboard language), Enter and the division key.<BR>
    &quot;kbd2&quot; for the cursor keys with right control key as fire button
and the<BR>
           right shift key as autofire toggle<BR>
    &quot;kbd3&quot; for T/F/H/B with the left Alt key as fire button and
the left Shift<BR>
           key as autofire toggle.<BR>
  The autofire toggle keys will turn on autofire (25 shots per second), it<BR>
  will stay enabled until you hit the autofire toggle again.<BR>
joyport1=mode [default=joy0]<BR>
  Like joyport0, but for the Amiga's joystick port 1.<BR>
use_gui=bool [default=yes]<BR>
  Show a user-interface that enables changing these options at run-time.<BR>
32bit_blits=bool [default=no]<BR>
  If enabled, the blitter emulation will use 32 bit operations where that<BR>
  seems profitable (note that this will cause bus errors on most  RISC<BR>
  machines)<BR>
immediate_blits=bool [default=no]<BR>
  If enabled, all blits will finish immediately, which can be nice for speed,<BR>
  but may cause incompatibilities.<BR>
collision_level=level [default=sprites]<BR>
  This can have a value of &quot;sprites&quot; or &quot;full&quot;.  If set
to &quot;full&quot;, the emulator<BR>
  will compute collisions between sprites and the background.  This is slow,
and<BR>
  used only rarely, so it's turned off by default.<BR>
cpu_speed=speed [default=4]<BR>
  This can have a value of &quot;real&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, or an integer
between 1 and 20.<BR>
  &quot;real&quot; will try to give the CPU emulation exactly as many cycles,
relative<BR>
  to the other chips, as on a real A500.  &quot;max&quot; will try to give
you the<BR>
  maximum CPU emulation speed achievable on your machine.  Numeric values<BR>
  specify a fixed relation between CPU and custom chip emulation, where lower<BR>
  values prioritize CPU emulation, while higher values prioritize custom
chip<BR>
  emulation.<BR>
finegrain_cpu_speed=speed<BR>
  Like cpu_speed, but only accepts numeric values.  These numeric values
are<BR>
  equivalent to the ones given to cpu_speed multiplied by 512.  This means<BR>
  that &quot;cpu_speed=2&quot; and &quot;finegrain_cpu_speed=1024&quot; have
the same effect.<BR>
  Using this option you can give the CPU emulation a much higher priority
by<BR>
  using small values.<BR>
cpu_type=type [default=68000]<BR>
  Controls which CPU is emulated. This can be &quot;68000&quot;, &quot;68010&quot;,
&quot;68020&quot; or<BR>
  &quot;68020/68881&quot;.  In some cases, you may need to use &quot;68ec020&quot;
or<BR>
  &quot;68ec020/68881&quot; to emulate a crippled variant of the 68020 that
has only a<BR>
  24 bit address bus.  Some software, including some Kickstart versions,
does<BR>
  not work with a normal 68020 that has a 32 bit address bus.<BR>
  Careful: using an &quot;ec&quot; variant has harmful side effects, and
should be<BR>
  disabled unless absolutely needed (you lose Z3 memory and Picasso<BR>
  emulation).<BR>
cpu_compatible=bool [default=no]<BR>
  If enabled, a slower but slightly more accurate variant of the CPU emulation<BR>
  will be used.  This is needed for some types of copy protection, among
other<BR>
  things. This is only meaningful for a CPU type of &quot;68000&quot;.<BR>
nr_floppies=n [default=4]<BR>
  The emulator will emulate this many external floppy drives.  Some very
old<BR>
  games apparently have problems if this is larger than 1, but for all normal<BR>
  programs the default is good enough.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Emulating external devices (harddisk, CD-ROM, printer, serial port):<BR>
filesystem=access,volume:path [default=no filesystems mounted]<BR>
  Mount the host's file system at &quot;path&quot; as an Amiga filesystem
with volume<BR>
  name &quot;VOLUME:&quot;.  &quot;access&quot; can be either &quot;ro&quot;
(for readonly), or &quot;rw&quot; (for<BR>
  read-write).  If you want to mount a CD-ROM, you should use a readonly<BR>
  mount.  You can mount multiple file systems.<BR>
  See below.<BR>
hardfile=access,secs,heads,reserved,bsize,file [default=no hardfiles mounted]<BR>
  Mount the hardfile &quot;file&quot; as an emulated harddisk, using a geometry
of<BR>
  &quot;secs&quot; sectors per track, &quot;heads&quot; surfaces and &quot;nr&quot;
reserved blocks.<BR>
  Each sector should have &quot;bsize&quot; bytes. This can be abused to
mount<BR>
  floppy images.  You can mount multiple hardfiles.<BR>
  See below.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Sound options:<BR>
sound_output=type [default=none]<BR>
  The type of sound output can be &quot;none&quot; (no sound at all), &quot;interrupts&quot;<BR>
  (emulated for the internal side effects that can be noticed by programs,<BR>
  but no sound output), &quot;normal&quot; (emulated, and sound output),
&quot;exact&quot; (a<BR>
  slightly more accurate emulation that may be necessary in some cases, but<BR>
  can also be slower).<BR>
sound_channels=type [default=mono]<BR>
  Can be &quot;mono&quot;, &quot;stereo&quot;, or &quot;mixed&quot;.  If
set to &quot;stereo&quot;, the left and right<BR>
  channels produce the same output as on a real Amiga - two of the four audio<BR>
  channels are audible on the left, and the other two on the right.  This
is<BR>
  exactly what you want, except if you're using headphones - having the sound<BR>
  split so strictly can lead to a strange listening experience at times.
 This<BR>
  is what &quot;mixed&quot; is trying to solve: it mixes the left channel
with a low<BR>
  volume into the right channel and vice versa.  (This mixing operation loses<BR>
  a bit of precision in the output).<BR>
sound_bits=n [default varies across UAE versions on different OS types]<BR>
  Common values are 8 (low quality) or 16 (high quality)<BR>
sound_frequency=n [default varies across UAE versions on different OS types]<BR>
  Common values are 22050 or 44100. The quality of sound output increases
with<BR>
  the frequency.<BR>
sound_min_buff=n<BR>
sound_max_buff=n [default varies across UAE versions on different OS types]<BR>
  You can specify the minimum and maximum size of the sound buffer.<BR>
  Smaller buffers reduce latency.  Usually only the minimum size is used.<BR>
sound_interpol=type [default none]<BR>
  Normally, sound samples are output exactly as they are computed, without<BR>
  any post-processing.  This can generate errors in the sound output when
the<BR>
  output frequency isn't an even multiple of the input frequency.  These<BR>
  errors are usuable perceived as a high-frequency noise.<BR>
  There are currently two types of interpolation available, both under<BR>
  experimentation.  You can use either &quot;rh&quot; or &quot;crux&quot;
as value for this<BR>
  option.  Note that no interpolation is supported for 8 bit output; you
need<BR>
  to use 16 bit output to hear a difference.  If you have any comments about<BR>
  the effects of either method on audio quality, I'd be very interested to<BR>
  hear them.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Memory options:<BR>
bogomem_size=n [default=0]<BR>
  Emulate n*256K slow memory at 0xC00000. Some demos/games need this.<BR>
fastmem_size=n [default=0]<BR>
  Emulate n megabytes of fast memory as an expansion board.<BR>
z3mem_size=n [default=0]<BR>
  Emulate n megabytes of Zorro III fast memory as an expansion board.<BR>
chipmem_size=n [default=4]<BR>
  Emulate n*512K chip memory. Some very broken programs need specific amounts<BR>
  of chip mem to work properly. The largest valid value is 16, which means
8MB<BR>
  chip memory.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Display options:<BR>
gfx_width=n [default=800]<BR>
  Use a window that is n pixels wide for displaying the Amiga screen.<BR>
gfx_height=n [default=300]<BR>
  Use a window that is n pixels high for displaying the Amiga screen.<BR>
gfx_lores=bool [default=no]<BR>
  Enable this option if you use a very small window width (320 to 400 pixels)<BR>
  to shrink the display horizontally.<BR>
gfx_linemode=type [default=none]<BR>
  The type can be none (every line is drawn once), &quot;double&quot; (every
line is<BR>
  drawn twice), and &quot;scanlines&quot; (every line is drawn once, but
the image is<BR>
  stretched vertically by inserting a black line every other line to simulate<BR>
  the display on an old monitor).<BR>
  The &quot;double&quot; mode gives best results, but slows down the emulation
quite a<BR>
  lot. Don't use the &quot;none&quot; mode if you want a decent interlace
emulation.<BR>
  If you use &quot;double&quot; or &quot;scanlines&quot;, your window needs
to be twice as high<BR>
  as when using the &quot;none&quot; mode.<BR>
gfx_correct_aspect=bool [default=none]<BR>
  Try to fit the image into the specified window dimensions by leaving out<BR>
  certain lines.  Useful if you want to fit a 640x512 Amiga display in a<BR>
  640x480 window.<BR>
gfx_center_vertical=bool [default=no]<BR>
gfx_center_horizontal=bool [default=no]<BR>
  If you use a smaller window than 800x300 (400x300 with &quot;gfx_lores&quot;
option or<BR>
  800x600 with a gfx_linemode other than &quot;none&quot;), not all parts
of the display<BR>
  will fit on the screen. By enabling the necessary centering options, you
can<BR>
  ask the emulator to try and move the screen contents so that the relevant<BR>
  parts are displayed. If you are unlucky, this can cause the contents to
jump<BR>
  around a bit in certain cases.<BR>
gfx_fullscreen_amiga=bool [default=no]<BR>
  Enable if you want to use the full screen, not a window on the desktop,
for<BR>
  the Amiga display.  Some ports (DOS, SVGAlib) always use fullscreen mode.<BR>
gfx_fullscreen_picasso=bool [default=no]<BR>
  Like gfx_fullscreen_amiga, but for the Picasso graphics card display.<BR>
gfx_color_mode=mode [default=8bit]<BR>
  Select a color mode to use.<BR>
  Color modes: 8bit (256 colors), 15bit (32768 colors), 16bit (65536 colors),<BR>
        8bit_dithered (256 colors, with dithering to improve quality),<BR>
        4bit_dithered (16 colors, dithered); 32bit (16 million colors)<BR>
gfxcard_size=n [default=0]<BR>
  Emulate a Picasso 96 compatible graphics card with n MB graphics memory.<BR>
  This requires that you use set the CPU type to &quot;68020&quot; or higher,
and that<BR>
  you do not use 24 bit addressing.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Debugging options (not interesting for most users):<BR>
use_debugger=bool [default=no]<BR>
  If enabled, don't start the emulator at once, use the built-in debugger.<BR>
log_illegal_mem [default=no]<BR>
  If enabled, print illegal memory accesses</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Whew. You'll probably have to experiment a little to get a feeling for
it.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>You can also put these options into a configuration file in your home<BR>
directory. Simply create ~/.uaerc and put some of these options in it. On<BR>
non-Unix systems, the file is called uae.rc and should be located in the<BR>
current directory.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Choosing color and screen modes<BR>
===============================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>As described in the previous paragraph, UAE can run in many different
<BR>
resolutions and color modes. However, few of the color mode options are<BR>
available if you use the X11 version of UAE, since the X server determines<BR>
how many colors are available. If you are running a 256 color X server, you<BR>
can use &quot;-H3&quot; to tell UAE to dither the colors for better results.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>You will have to experiment which mode gives the best results for you
at a<BR>
satisfying speed. Note that the dithering process consumes time, so even
if<BR>
256 colors with dithering look better than 256 colors without, remember that<BR>
UAE will be slower in that mode.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>The recommended resolution is 800x600. In the lower resolution modes,
some<BR>
overscan pictures the Amiga tries to display may not fit entirely on the<BR>
screen, others may be off-center and some graphical effects may look weird.<BR>
For best results, use 800x600 with at least 32768 colors.<BR>
For speed, use 400x300 lores with 256 colors.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>_Don't_ use 24 bit or 32 bit screen modes, unless you absolutely have
to.<BR>
These are way too slow to be usable.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Harddisk emulation<BR>
==================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Since using diskfiles is awkward, it is necessary to emulate harddisks.
There<BR>
are two ways how you can use large amounts of data with UAE: harddisk files<BR>
and mounted directories.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>1. Harddisk files</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Harddisk files are large files that contain the image of an Amiga filesystem.<BR>
They work much the same way as a disk file. You can simply create a large<BR>
empty file and tell UAE to use it as a hardfile, but you will need to format<BR>
it from the emulation before you can actually use it.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Under Unix, You can create a (unformatted) harddisk file with<BR>
  dd if=/dev/zero of=hardfile bs=512 count=16384<BR>
That will create an 8MB file. Other ports of UAE may come with a utility<BR>
called &quot;makedisk&quot; or other ways to create such a file.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>To tell the emulator that you want to use a certain file as a hardfile,
use<BR>
the &quot;-W&quot; option, for example<BR>
  uae -W 32:1:2:hardfile<BR>
The first three numbers are geometry information which tell the AmigaOS how<BR>
the file is organized. The first number (32) is the number of sectors per<BR>
track, the second number (1) is the number of heads or surfaces, the third<BR>
number (2) is the number of reserved blocks. If you use &quot;normal&quot;
sizes<BR>
(powers of two, like 32MB), then you should be OK using the same numbers
as<BR>
in the above example. Using different numbers can make sense if you transfer<BR>
the image of a real Amiga harddisk which uses a different geometry. The last<BR>
field of the argument to the &quot;-W&quot; option is the name of the harddisk
file.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>If you are using Kickstart 1.3 or earlier, hardfiles can't currently be<BR>
mounted at boot time, and therefore you can't boot from it either. You will<BR>
have to boot either from a floppy disk image or from a filesystem (see below),<BR>
and mount the hardfile.device later. To do this, add the following to<BR>
&quot;DEVS:mountlist&quot;:</P>

not<BR>

<PRE></PRE>
<P>Then, type &quot;mount UAE0:&quot; (or put that command in your startup-sequence),

<P>b) Accessing native filesystems from the emulator</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>This has some major advantages:<BR>
 - It has no problems with Kickstart 1.3<BR>
 - It is more convenient.<BR>
 - It is much faster.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>If you specify the -M or -m command line arguments, you your native filesystem
<BR>
from the emulator. If you start UAE with</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>  uae -m sound:/usr/amiga/modules</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>you can access all the files in /usr/amiga/modules by reading from the<BR>
AmigaDOS volume &quot;SOUND:&quot;.<BR>
(DOS users: try &quot;uae -m dh0:C:\&quot; to mount your drive C:\ as DH0:)</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>You can mount up to 20 devices, either hardfiles or filesystems, by giving<BR>
either of these options multiple times. The volumes will be named UAE0:,<BR>
UAE1:, etc. UAE will boot from UAE0: if no diskfile is found for floppy<BR>
drive 0.<BR>
You can also use native filesystems to mount Amiga CD-ROMs, and you can<BR>
abuse the hardfile emulation to mount floppy disks: &quot;uae -W 11:2:2:wb13.adf&quot;<BR>
will mount the diskfile &quot;wb13.adf&quot;.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Tools / Transferring files<BR>
==========================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>As you should know by now, you need to transfer files between your Amiga
and<BR>
the machine you run UAE on. There are several ways how to do this.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>- Using a null modem cable, and a terminal package running on each machine,<BR>
  you can transfer the file(s) via Zmodem upload/download. 68000 equipped<BR>
  Amigas can normally attain around 3000cps through the null modem cable,<BR>
  using the standard Commodore serial.device.  However, by using the device<BR>
  replacement BaudBandit.device, anything up to 5500cps can be attained.<BR>
  BaudBandit can be obtained from Aminet.  A second alternative is to use<BR>
  the BASIC program adfi.bas (included with UAE) to transfer a file from
the<BR>
  Amiga to the PC via the null modem cable.<BR>
  <BR>
- If you're using CrossDOS on your Amiga, you can compress the disk or<BR>
  kickstart image using LhA or similar PC compatible archiver and copy it
to<BR>
  a 720KB floppy disk.  You can now take the disk over to the PC, copy the<BR>
  compressed file to the UAE directory and uncompress it.<BR>
  If you don't have CrossDOS on the Amiga, there is a similar freeware tool<BR>
  called Msh, which can be found on Aminet or on Fish disk 382 or 327.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>In either case, you ought to read the documentation for the programs that<BR>
you use for the transfer. These programs can't be explained here.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>In the &quot;amiga&quot; subdirectory you'll find two small Amiga programs
that will<BR>
help you to generate the necessary image files. These are called transrom
<BR>
and transdisk. Copy them to your Amiga and make them executable (by typing<BR>
&quot;protect transrom rwed&quot; and &quot;protect transdisk rwed&quot;
in the Amiga shell<BR>
window).<BR>
transrom will dump the contents of your Kickstart ROM, and transdisk will
<BR>
dump an image of a floppy in one of the drives. Both programs write to the<BR>
standard output (read: the screen), so you'll want to redirect that. Do</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>   transrom &gt;ram:kick.rom<BR>
   <BR>
to create a file called &quot;kick.rom&quot; in the RAM disk, and</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>   transdisk &gt;ram:df0.adf<BR>
   <BR>
to create a file called &quot;df0.adf&quot; in the RAM disk. These files
are pretty<BR>
big, 262144 or 524288 bytes for the ROM image and 901120 bytes for a disk
<BR>
image.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>NEVER run either of these programs from the Workbench. Always open a Shell<BR>
or CLI window to do this.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>transdisk understands the following arguments:</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>    -d device unit: Use this device instead of DF0:<BR>
    -s n:           Begin transfer at track n (default: 0)<BR>
    -e n:           End transfer at track n (default: 79)<BR>
    -w file:        don't read from the floppy, instead write the contents<BR>
                    of &quot;file&quot; to the floppy<BR>
    -h:             Treat the disk as high-density disk. HD images aren't<BR>
                    supported by UAE yet, though. Note that the resulting<BR>
      file will be twice as big.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>So, to transfer the disk in drive DF1:, you'd give the command:</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>  transdisk &gt;ram:df1.adf -d trackdisk 1</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>If you don't have much RAM and can't fit all of a disk image in the RAM
disk,<BR>
you can split up the transfer into multiple parts with the &quot;-s&quot;
and &quot;-e&quot;<BR>
parameters. To transfer the disk in four parts, you'd use the following <BR>
commands:</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>  transdisk &gt;ram:df0_1.adf -s 0 -e 19<BR>
  transdisk &gt;ram:df0_2.adf -s 20 -e 39<BR>
  transdisk &gt;ram:df0_3.adf -s 40 -e 59<BR>
  transdisk &gt;ram:df0_4.adf -s 60 -e 79</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Of course, you should save each of the four files to another place before<BR>
transferring the next one with transdisk to make space in your RAM disk.
<BR>
If you have all the files on your PC, you can do the following under Unix:<BR>
  cat df0_1.adf df0_2.adf df0_3.adf df0_4.adf &gt;df0.adf<BR>
or, under DOS:<BR>
  COPY /B df0_1.adf+df0_2.adf+df0_3.adf+df0_4.adf df0.adf<BR>
I've been told there are the following tools for the Mac to join binaries:<BR>
&quot;ChunkJoiner 2.1.2&quot; found under Info-Mac's &lt;disk&gt; directory
or <BR>
&quot;JoinFiles 1.0.1&quot; under Info-Mac's &lt;text&gt;.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>The current transdisk can only read the standard AmigaDOS format. This
means<BR>
that most games that rely on some form of copy-protection cannot be<BR>
transferred (more about disk formats in the file &quot;FAQ&quot;)</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>****************************************************************************<BR>
If you transfer commercial software, you must not distribute the resulting<BR>
image files, since that would be a violation of copyright law. The Kickstart<BR>
ROM has to be considered commercial software. You may only use the Kickstart<BR>
from your own Amiga, and you may not distribute Kickstart ROM files.<BR>
Please read the license that came with your software for details.<BR>
****************************************************************************</P>

</PRE>
<P>Retrieving files from a disk image<BR>
==================================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>If you have a disk image file, and you want to retrieve the files from
it, you<BR>
can use the &quot;readdisk&quot; tool. It is automatically built by &quot;make&quot;.
If you have<BR>
a disk image of a disk called &quot;Workbench1.3D&quot; as df0.adf, and you
do<BR>
   readdisk df0.adf<BR>
the whole directory structure of the disk image will be stored in a newly<BR>
created subdirectory called &quot;Workbench1.3D&quot;. You can optionally
give a second<BR>
parameter to specify a directory where to create the output other than the<BR>
current directory.<BR>
readdisk only understands about the OFS right now. FFS disks will cheerfully<BR>
be regarded as being unreadable. Use the unixfs.device from within the<BR>
emulator if you want to transfer files from FFS disks.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Picasso 96 graphics card emulation<BR>
==================================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>To use this feature, you must select 68020 emulation with a 32 bit address<BR>
space (i.e. _not_ 68ec020). You also need a Kickstart 3.x ROM.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>To specify how much graphic memory you want to emulate, use the &quot;-U&quot;
option,<BR>
e.g. &quot;-U 4&quot; for 4 megabytes. Then, you need the Picasso 96 software
which<BR>
is not distributed with UAE (There will be a link to the Picasso 96 home
page<BR>
on the UAE Web page soon). Version 1.31 or higher is recommended.<BR>
Install the Picasso software, and make sure you enable the &quot;uaegfx&quot;
driver.<BR>
After that is complete, reboot, and you should be able to select the new<BR>
modes from the ScreenModes program.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>UAE SCSI device<BR>
===============</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>To enable SCSI support, use --enable-scsi-device when running configure.<BR>
The emulator provides a uaescsi.device. This device only supports<BR>
direct SCSI, which is sufficient to run applications like MakeCD. The<BR>
device does not support reading or writing with the normal Exec commands,<BR>
so you cannot mount filesystems on it right now.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>The unit numbers of the uaescsi.device follow the Amiga SCSI<BR>
conventions: unit number &quot;xyz&quot; maps to the lun y of target z on
bus<BR>
x. Wide SCSI busses can have targets with numbers larger than 9. In<BR>
this case the uaescsi.device pretends that there is another SCSI<BR>
bus. To avoid confusion, all available SCSI targets are listed<BR>
together with their unit number when starting UAE. Devices cannot be<BR>
added while the emulator is running.  Reseting it is not sufficient<BR>
either for technical reasons.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>The implementation of the uaescsi.device uses cdrecord's libscg as<BR>
interface to the native SCSI system. The Linux implementation of this<BR>
library used to be included into UAE, but now the library as generated<BR>
by the cdrecord source package (ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/)<BR>
is used. As the library is not distributed seperately, you will have<BR>
to get the whole cdrecord sources, compile it and then make several<BR>
header and lib files available to the compiler if (and only if) building<BR>
UAE with SCSI support. The script &quot;src/install_libscg&quot; copies the
files<BR>
required for the libscg in cdrecord 1.8.1.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Using threads is strongly recommended, because some SCSI commands can<BR>
run for extended periods of time and would block the whole emulation<BR>
during this time without threads. Use --enable-threads when starting<BR>
configure.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Depending on the hosts capabilities the uaescsi.device may be limited<BR>
compared to other Amiga SCSI devices. The Linux kernel by default only<BR>
allows 32KB of data per SCSI command and does not always perform SCSI<BR>
requests in parallel.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Setting the chunk size in MakeCD to 30KB is already too much and<BR>
causes an IO error -4 (IOERR_BADLENGTH), because the setting is only<BR>
used as a guideline. You can work around this by setting the Tooltypes<BR>
BUFFER_CHUNK_XXX to 29. On a Pentium II 350MHz with Adaptec UW SCSI<BR>
controller on board on-the-fly copying was possible from a Philips<BR>
CDD2600 (SCSI) to a Yamaha CRW4416E (IDE) at 4x.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>The UAE_CONTROL program<BR>
=======================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>In the &quot;amiga&quot; subdirectory, you will find two programs, uae_control
and<BR>
uaectrl that provide the same functionality as the X11 GUI. uaectrl is<BR>
shell-based and works with any Kickstart, while uae_control needs the<BR>
gadtools.library and a recent version of reqtools.library, so it only works<BR>
with Kick 2.0 and upwards. Copy these two programs to the directory that
you<BR>
use for harddisk emulation. They should be self-explanatory.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>The timehack<BR>
============</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Another tool in the &quot;amiga&quot; subdirectory, timehack, synchronizes
the<BR>
emulated Amiga's system time with the host's time every second. This<BR>
is useful when the emulation is not done in real-time or is suspended<BR>
completely.</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Quick overview of the debugger commands<BR>
=======================================</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>Some (window-system based) ports of UAE have a built-in debugger. You
can<BR>
press ^C at any time to enter this debugger.<BR>
Each debugger command consists of a single letter and occasionally some<BR>
parameters.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>g:                    Start execution at the current address. <BR>
c:                    Dump state of the CIA and custom chips.<BR>
r:                    Dump state of the CPU<BR>
m &lt;address&gt; &lt;lines&gt;:  Memory dump starting at &lt;address&gt;<BR>
d &lt;address&gt; &lt;lines&gt;:  Disassembly starting at &lt;address&gt;<BR>
t:                    Step one instruction<BR>
z:                    Step through one instruction - useful for JSR, DBRA
etc.<BR>
f &lt;address&gt;:          Step forward until PC == &lt;address&gt;<BR>
q:                    Quit the emulator. You don't want to use this command.<BR>
M:                    hunt for sound modules<BR>
S &lt;filename&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;len&gt;:<BR>
                      save a sound module<BR>
C &lt;value&gt;:            Search for values like energy or lifes in games<BR>
W &lt;address&gt; &lt;value&gt;:  Write into Amiga memory</P>
<PRE>
</PRE>
<P>Sound<BR>
=====</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>If your version of UAE supports sound, you can pass parameters like frequency<BR>
or number of bits to use on the commandline; if you don't specify any, sane<BR>
defaults will be used. If graphics output is enabled while sound is output,<BR>
the emulator will be much too slow on most systems. The sound will not be<BR>
continuous. Therefore, a hack to turn off screen updates is provided: Press<BR>
ScrollLock to disable graphics, press it again to enable them.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>The quality of the emulation depends on the setting of the &quot;-S&quot;
commandline<BR>
option. With &quot;-S 3&quot;, all of the sound hardware is emulated; and
some programs<BR>
(e.g. AIBB) won't run with other settings. &quot;-S 2&quot; should sound
just as good as<BR>
&quot;-S 3&quot; and will be much faster for some programs. &quot;-S 1&quot;
tries to emulate most<BR>
of the sound hardware, but doesn't actually output sound. &quot;-S 0&quot;
completely<BR>
turns off sound.</P>

<P>There is supposedly a newsgroup named &quot;alt.emulators.amiga&quot;,
but I don't get<BR>
it here.<BR>
The newsgroup &quot;comp.sys.amiga.emulations&quot; appears to be a proper
place to<BR>
discuss Amiga emulation, but, strictly speaking, it is _not_ the right place.<BR>
More appropriate places are &quot;comp.emulators.misc&quot;, and, of course,
Gustavo's<BR>
discussion board.</P>

<P>Petter Schau has written another Amiga emulator named &quot;Fellow&quot;.

<P>Please don't ask for Kickstart ROM files or other copyrighted software.
Don't<BR>
_send_ me stuff like this either. If you want to send me something else which<BR>
is big (&gt;= 50K), ask me before or put it somewhere in Webspace.<BR>
If I get 3MB of screen shots or a core dump (&quot;it doesn't work, it generates<BR>
this file&quot;), I'm very likely to get extremely angry, I might complain
to your<BR>
sysadmin, and you might lose your account. Think twice.</P>
<PRE></PRE>
<P>I'm also going to be extremely annoyed if you send email in HTML format.<BR>
Fight this disease!</P>

<P>Oh, and another thing: If I promise to do things (like implement new<BR>
features), and forget about them, pester me. That happens occasionally, it's<BR>
a known bug in my brain. I'll have it replaced.</P>
