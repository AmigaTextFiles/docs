Subject: Installing a fan inside an A1200


I used one of the 486 CPU fans from Radio Shack. I think it was about
$10. I discarded the plate used to attach it to the 486 chip. For power I
tapped into the lines going to the floppy drive. I unplugged the connector
leading from the motherboard to the floppy drive. I carefully removed the
wires from the plug that plugs into the floppy drive. I removed about 1/4 inch
of insulation from each of the 2 wires. This can be done anywhere on the
wires. I wrapped the wires coming from the fan around the bare spots on the
floppy drive power wires. I then soldered these. I put some heat shrink tubing
over the solder joints and shrunk them.

As far as mounting the fan, I simply used a two sided tape that I had laying
around. It's a "cushiony" tape about 1/16 inch thick that I believe I bought
at a hobby shop a while back. It can probably be bought at a hardware store
though. It worked very well. The location I used to mount the fan might seem a
bit odd but I could see no other location and it does work.

Finding a decent location to put the fan proved to be a challenge. Maybe you
can do better. The way I did things has the air blowing on the BACK (or
bottom) of the accel board. The BACK being the side which is UP when the board
is mounted in the A1200 and you're looking down on the motherboard as shown
above. Hope this makes sense! If not--let me know! 

The fan is taped to the heat shield at points X, Y and Z above. Note that
point Z is on top of the raised portion of the heat shield which helps to aim
the airflow more towards the CPU. The fourth corner is not attached to
anything because it is suspended. The airflow is down towards the accel board.

This creates an airflow across the BACK of the board which helps to cool the
CPU. Mine still gets warm but it's comfortable to touch. Before installing the
fan, the CPU would get too hot to touch.

If any of this isn't clear, let me know and I'll try again. Good luck with
your fan installation!

Regards, 
John
