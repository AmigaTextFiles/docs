    Minimum operating requirements are:-
    ------------------------------------

    1) Standard Amiga A500 with 512Kb or more of memory.
    2) Workbench 1.3x.
    3) An external floppy disk drive is required.
    4) OCS.
    5) The mouse is optional.
    6) The software has NOT been tested on an Amiga A1000.
    7) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 1.2x or less.
    8) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 3.1x or greater.

    General information:-
    ---------------------

    This tool will measure the Power Output of a Transmitter, up to 10 Watts
    from 21 MHz to 435 Mhz into 50 Ohms. Its useful range is 1 MHz
    to 520 Mhz.

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler and some assembler.

    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 34MB of ram
    thanks to Laurence J Greatorex, and also to Bob Eva for testing on his
    A1200 setup, with a total of 10MB of memory, and to Nathan Shepherd
    with an absolutely standard A500 without a mouse.

    Next project:-
    --------------

    This is to whet your appetite, it is an Oscilloscope Calibrator,
    ready for ~TestGear4.lha~ and ~TestGear4.readme~ which will be an
    Oscilloscope. The Oscilloscope will be built in stages and requres
    a mouse to run.
