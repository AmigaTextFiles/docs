  Overview:-
  ----------

  This tool is used to set up Oscilloscope Time Bases, Vertical Deflection
  Amplifiers. Synchronisation and trigger settings can be checked also.
  
  Note:- This is the first project with full construction information.

  As this is used to calibrate a serious piece of test equipment, it has
  to be made as well as possible so that the specifications remain the
  same for anyone who builds it.

============================================================================

                  Using the Oscilloscope Calibrator Software.
                  -------------------------------------------

  Keyboard Controls:-
  -------------------

  (1) Sets the frequency to 1KHz.
  (2) Sets the frequency to 100Hz.
  (3) Sets the frequency to 10Hz.
  (r) or (R) Resets the Output to the Default conditions, (calibrated on
      an A1200 only). The defaults are, 1KHz Square Wave at 1 Volt peak
      to peak.
  (q) or (Q) Quits the program.

  There are four more hidden keys in the program:-
  ------------------------------------------------

  (a) or (A) Sets the software attenuator to -20dB below maximum output.
      Do NOT use this mode unless it is absolutely neccessary, use the
      mechanical switched ranges instead. This only works on ranges (1), (2)
      and (3) and will default to the 1KHz range.
  The ~SPACE~ bar will also Quit the program.
  (H) That is ~SHIFT h~, Sets the frequency to 10KHz Square Wave. The
      amplitude may NOT be accurate so therefore the key is not shown
      on the window. However the frequency IS very accurate for all the
      AMIGAS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The mouse is optional and can be used to Quit the program or move the
  window to the background. It does NOT need to be connected for normal
  operation of the program.

============================================================================

  Calibration of the device:-
  ---------------------------

  1) The only test that can be done is with ANY Audio Amplifier.
  2) Switch OFF the AMIGA and Amplifier and read the ~Warning~ file.
  3) Connect the PHONO/RCA plug of the Oscilloscope Calibrator to the Left
     Channel Audio Output Socket of the AMIGA.
  4) Connect a blank PHONO/RCA plug to the Right Channel Audio Output Socket
     of the AMIGA.
  5) Connect the Output Cable PL259 plug to the SO239 socket of the
     Calibrator.
  6) Connect the Output Cable BNC plug to the Input of ANY Audio Amplifier
     using a suitable connecting cable or adaptor. A typical adaptor can be
     obtained from MAPLIN, part number FE88V, (BNC female to PHONO/RCA plug).
  7) Set the Audio Amplifier's volume to minimum, and to the correct Input
     source.
  8) Set the Calibrator's Attenuator switch to maximum output,
     (fully anti-clockwise).
  9) Switch ON all of the equipment.
 10) Start up the ~Scope_Calib~ software.
 11) Adjust the Audio Amplifier's volume for a normal listening level.
 12) Switch the Attenuator up or down and listen to the large changes
     in the volume from the speaker(s).
 13) Press ~1~ or ~2~ to hear the frequency changes from the speaker(s).
 14) Try the other keys to check that they also work.
 15) If all is well, switch OFF all of the equipment and disconnect any
     of the hardware.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Limitations as to use:-
  -----------------------

  Because of the limitations of the AMIGA'S Audio Output the Square Wave
  will not be as good as a professional Oscilloscope Calibrator. However
  it is infinitely better than NO calibrator at all and will successfully
  set up the next project, the Digital Storage Oscilloscope, along with
  the batteries that you should have for calibrating some of the previous
  projects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Using the ~Viewer~ program:-
  ----------------------------

  Important:-
  -----------

          This program requires Workbench 2.xx or greater to run.
          -------------------------------------------------------

  To view any of the construction drawings start up the ~Viewer~ software.
  You will see a requester with all of the relevant drawings inside it.
  Double click on the required drawing and it will be displayed.
  (r) or (R) will bring up the requester again for another drawing.
  Any other key will Quit the program.

  For Workbench 1.3x users:-
  --------------------------

  Do NOT run the ~Viewer~ software, instead open up the ~Drawing~ drawer
  and view the files using an ~iff~ image viewer. All of the ~?.drawing~
  files are standard (NTSC) 320x200x2 Lores IFF files. The icons for the
  ~?.drawing~ are project icons and I have used ~Display~ as the default
  image viewer. ~Display~ is NOT in this archive. You may change the default
  viewer and its path to suit yourself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  What it is used for:-
  ---------------------

  Refer to the ~Examples.drawing~ for all of the following information.
  The circuit shows a passive network of resistors and capacitors.
  It is a general circuit for the input of a Vertical Deflection Amplifier
  of any random analogue Oscilloscope and will be used in the next project.
  R1 and R2 form a potential divider. TC1, C1 and Cx form the total
  capacitance across R1, C2 and Cy form the total capacitance across R2.
  Cx and Cy are both unknown stray values in the range of 1 to 200
  Pica-Farads. To obtain some form of frequency compensation the Time
  Constant (TC1+C1+Cx)xR1 must be the same as (C2+Cy)xR2. We have assumed
  that there are no stray inductances in the passive network. The variable
  capacitor TC1 is adjusted to give the best possible Square Waveform from
  an Oscilloscope Calibrator. If TC1 is too large then the waveform will
  look like box number (1). If TC1 is too small then the waveform will
  look like box number (2). However if TC1 is correctly adjusted then the
  waveform will look like box number (3). This Oscilloscope Calibrator
  project is set to give a square wave at a specific frequency and with
  a specific amplitude, and each range of the Digital Storage Oscilloscope's
  Vertical Amplifier will be adjusted to give the shape in the box number
  (3). Also the frequency will be used to set up the Timebase ranges.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Using the Oscilloscope Calibrator:-
  -----------------------------------

  1) Switch OFF the AMIGA and read the ~Warning~ file.
  2) Connect the PHONO/RCA plug of the Oscilloscope Calibrator to the Left
     Channel Audio Output Socket of the AMIGA.
  3) Connect a blank PHONO/RCA plug to the Right Channel Audio Output Socket
     of the AMIGA.
  4) Connect the Output Cable PL259 plug to the SO239 socket of the
     Calibrator.
  5) Connect the Output Cable BNC plug to the ~Y~ input of an Oscilloscope.
  6) Set the Oscilloscope's Vertical Range to 1 Volt peak to peak.
  7) Set the Calibrator's Attenuator switch to maximum output,
     (fully anti-clockwise).
  8) Switch ON the AMIGA (and the Oscilloscope if required).
  9) Start up the ~Scope_Calib~ software.
 10) Adjust the relevant variable capacitor(s) in the Vertical Amplifier
     to give the best possible Square Waveform.
 11) Switch the Attenuator to give a different output and do the same for
     the other ~Y~ ranges.
 12) Use the frequency output to set up the Horizontal Timebase speeds.
 13) When finished switch OFF all of the equipment and disconnect any
     of the hardware.
