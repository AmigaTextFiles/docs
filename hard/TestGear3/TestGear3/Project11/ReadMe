                         An Oscilloscope Calibrator.
                         ---------------------------


    Minimum operating requirements are:-
    ------------------------------------

    1) Standard Amiga A500 with 512Kb or more of memory.
    2) Workbench 1.3x.
    3) An external floppy disk drive is required.
    4) OCS.
    5) The mouse is optional.
    6) The software has NOT been tested on an Amiga A1000.
    7) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 1.2x or less.
    8) The software has NOT been tested on Workbench 3.1x or greater.

    General information:-
    ---------------------

    This tool is the start of the next generation of projects. It is to whet
    your appetite for ~TestGear4A.lha~ and ~TestGear4A.readme~ which will be
    a Digital Storage Oscilloscope. Some previous projects may be used to
    set up this Oscilloscope.

    This software was written using ACE basic compiler and some assembler.

    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 34MB of ram
    thanks to Laurence J Greatorex, and also to Bob Eva for testing on his
    A1200 setup, with a total of 10MB of memory, and to Nathan Shepherd
    with an absolutely standard A500 without a mouse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Next project:-
    --------------

    This will be ~TestGear4A.lha~ and ~TestGear4A.readme~ and is a Digital
    Storage Oscilloscope. The Oscilloscope will be built in stages and
    requires a Standard A1200 with a second floppy disk drive as a minimum
    to run. It will probably NOT work with fast accelerator cards.

    This, and all future projects, will be in the ~hard/test~ drawer
    in the AMINET archive.
