    Testing evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was tested on an A500 with various memory configurations,
    the same A500 switched to 1MB Chip Ram and emulating WB2 using
    the A500+ emulator, an A600 with various memory configurations,
    the same A600 emulating WB3 with various memory configurations,
    an A1200 with various memory configurations, and a similar A1200
    with a Turbo LC accelerator board and an '030 with 34MB of ram
    thanks to Laurence J Greatorex, and also to Bob Eva with his
    A1200 setup, with a total of 10MB of memory, and to Nathan Shepherd
    with his absloutely standard A500 without a mouse.

    Next major project:-
    --------------------

    The next project will be an Absorption RF Wattmeter. It will measure
    up to 10 Watts RF power output into a 50 Ohm dummy load. Frequency
    Range from 1 Mhz to approximately 500 Mhz. This project WILL require
    the A-D Converter from ~TestGear2.lha~, ~Project6~.
