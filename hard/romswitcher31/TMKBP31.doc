Three Sentence Overview Of What This Thing Is:

The Multi-Kickstart Board Project allows the user of an Amiga 500,
2000, or 2500 to switch between different versions of the operating
system, called Kickstart.  Some older software, and even some new
software, are not compatible with Commodore's latest version of
the operating system. This hardware project will let you use the new
version of the operating system (it is *tons* better than 1.3 and
below), and still remain compatible with the software that won't work
under the new operating system.

General Information:

The Multi-Kickstart Board Project allows the user of an Amiga 500, 
2000, or 2500 to switch between different versions of the operating 
system, called Kickstart.  These versions of Kickstart are contained 
on ROM chips that are normally plugged into the computer mother board.

The reason for the switching ability is due to the incompatibility of
older software programs, and perhaps a few new ones, with the newest
version of the operating system, particularly Kickstart version 2.04.
The Multi-Kickstart Board Project will enable the user to access an
older version of Kickstart so that 2.04-incompatible software in the
user's library may be used.  The Multi-Kickstart Board Project will
also allow the user to switch to the latest version of Kickstart to
gain the advantages it offers with newer, more compatible software.

The user removes the ROM chip from the computer mother board, inserts
it into any empty socket on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project, and
then inserts the 40 pin DIP connector from The Multi-Kickstart Board
Project into the empty ROM socket on the mother board.  When a newer
version of Kickstart is purchased, that ROM is simply plugged into 
another empty socket on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project.  The user
may then, with a flick of a switch, select either version of 
Kickstart: the older version that is more compatible with the user's
collection of older software, or the newer version with its many
enhancements.  A third ROM socket is present on The Multi-Kickstart
Board Project to allow for another, future version of Kickstart.

You can build this project by obtaining all the parts yourself and
wire wrapping it together on a perfboard, following the schematics, or
you can order The Multi-Kickstart Board Project in kit form which
includes the printed circuit board and all the parts needed to put it
together. See the parts list for a detailed breakdown of the parts
needed.  You can also order just a printed circuit board from us if
you have your own parts.

Shipping and Packaging Prices:

All shipping within the United States is done First Class, and all
shipping done outside the United States is done by Air Mail.

Shipping and Packaging:

Prices are for EACH board with parts ordered. Same shipping and 
packaging price for each board ordered without parts.



United States -  $1.16

Canada        -   1.22

Mexico        -   1.25

Germany       -   2.53

England       -   2.53

France        -   2.53

Australia     -   3.11


These are all the main locations I could think of to ask the post 
office for shipping rates to. Shipping and packaging to Europe appears
to be $2.53 so if you're in Europe and we don't have a shipping price
for your area then just make it $2.53 for shipping. The weight of the
package is 3.9 ounces so if you are somewhere else that we don't have
a price for then you can go to the post office there and see what the
shipping would be and add 18 cents for packaging. If you can't get to
the post office and your country is not listed then make the shipping
and packaging $3.50 and that should cover it.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Theory Of Operation:

The Multi-Kickstart Board Project is simply an extension of the 
Amiga's ROM socket with switching ability.  The circuit board consists
of three ROM sockets (ROM1, ROM2, and ROM3), three 330 ohm resistors
(R1, R2, and R3), three .01uF capacitors (C1, C2, and C3), and a
74LS32 quad two input OR gate (U1).  

The ROM chip of the Amiga is a Read Only Memory chip that contains the
operating system of the Amiga Computer called Kickstart.  In order for
the computer to read the contents of any memory chip, the processor
has to somehow tell the memory chip that it would like to read its 
contents.  Many memory chips have a pin call Output Enable (*OE). This
pin is used by the computer system to tell the ROM chip that it is the
device being selected to be read from by the processor. By decoding
the address lines of the processor, a signal called *ROMEN is produced
by the computer. This signal is then fed into the Output Enable pin of
the Kickstart ROM.  The Output Enable pin of the Amiga's ROM chip is
an active low line. This means that the ROM will only respond to the
address bus if its Output Enable line is low, or 0 volts. If this line
is high, or 5 volts, the ROM chip will effectively take itself off the
data bus and will not respond to the address bus. By taking control of
the Output Enable line and steering it to one of three ROM sockets,
The Multi-Kickstart Board Project is able to control which one of
three ROMs will be used by the computer.  When one of the ROMs is
enabled, the other two ROMs remain off the data bus. They will stay
off the data bus as long as their Output Enable pins stay high. The
logic circuitry of The Multi-Kickstart Board Project was designed to
only allow one ROM to be enabled at a time, allowing for only one
operating system to be running, for example Kickstart 1.3, Kickstart
2.04 or any other Kickstart version installed in the board. Other than
the Output Enable lines, all the other lines of the ROMs on the board
are connected in parallel as you can see in the schematic.  If for any
reason all the ROMs were all enabled at the same time bus contention
would exist on the data bus and the machine would crash.

At the heart of The Multi-Kickstart Board Project is a 74LS32 two 
input quad OR gate. This device is configured as a logical switch that
will only allow one Output Enable line to be activated at a time. The
logic circuit is controlled by a three position switch which is used
to select between the ROMs. All the lines from the Amiga's ROM socket
are placed in parallel with all the lines of the ROM sockets on The
Multi-Kickstart Board Project, except for the Output Enable lines of
both the Amiga's ROM socket and The Multi-Kickstart Board Project's
ROM sockets.  The Output Enable line from the Amiga's ROM socket is
sent into one of the gates of the logic chip that is configured as a
buffer. This buffered signal is then fed into one of the inputs of
each of the remaining three gates.  The other input of the remaining
gates is connected to one of the switches three positions. At each of
these points a pull-up resistor is added (R1, R2, and R3).  The
purpose  of the pull-up resistor is to keep the input of the gate at a
high when it is not being pulled low by the switch. The switch 
activates a gate by connecting the gate's input to ground or taking it
low. This condition allows only one gate to pass the Output Enable 
signal through its output to the ROM socket and then to the ROM 
sitting in that particular socket. All the other Output Enable signals
stay high.

On The Multi-Kickstart Board Project printed circuit board, pin 1 and
pin 31 are jumpered together.  This was done because earlier versions
of the Amiga's motherboard had the address line A17 at pin 1, the 
newer versions of the motherboard have A17 on pin 31 of the ROM 
socket.  For People that have the newer versions of the mother board,
they must simply cut the trace at JMP1 on the printed circuit board.
On the newer versions of the mother board pin 1 must NOT be connected
to pin 31. Having these lines connected together on the newer boards
will cause  the computer to crash. The jumper was added to The Multi-
Kickstart Board Project printed circuit board for the convenience of
the people that have the older version of the mother board, and to
make switching between different board versions an easy task.

The purpose of the capacitors on this board is for filtering the power
supply line.

The following items are required in order to put the Multi-Kickstart
Board Project together.


Soldering Iron
Solder
Wire Cutters
Wire Strippers

Ruler (optional)
Masking Tape, or Scotch Tape (optional)
Permanent Marker Pen (optional)


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Assembly Of The Multi-Kickstart Board Project:

The assembly and testing of The Multi-Kickstart Board Project should 
not take very long to do.  Although it is a very simple project, I can
not stress it enough that you take your time and be neat with putting
it together and testing it.  The more time you take with putting this
board together the less mistakes you are going to make and the happier 
you will be with the results.  The less mistakes you make, the less 
time you will spend banging your head against the wall for making 
those stupid mistakes.  Before starting, read all instructions and 
check to make sure that all the parts in the parts list NOT marked 
(OPTIONAL) are in the kit.

For those of you that have never soldered on a printed circuit board
before, this paragraph will give you a few tips to help you through
this task.  First of all let the soldering iron heat up for at least
ten minutes prior to soldering.  When soldering, it is always a good
idea to keep the tip of your iron clean. Clean the tip with a damp
cloth before each pass with the iron.  When soldering  on a board like
this, it is best to use a small and pointed soldering iron tip.  The
most important thing to remember is what I call the "Ten Second Rule."
This rule simply states that you do not leave your iron touching the
printed circuit board for more than ten seconds.  The reason for this
is that if you let the hot iron sit on the board for more than ten
seconds, you will probably lift a trace or a pad from the board
because of the heat.  Ten seconds is more than enough time to let the
solder flow.  If you must resolder a point on the board, let the board
cool down before reapplying the iron.  Remember, whenever you solder,
treat the board gently.  When you solder, it is a good idea to use a
flux core solder.  Another good tip to remember is to first place the
iron at the point to be soldered THEN add solder to that point. DO NOT
put too much solder at each point, put enough just to get the job
done.

There are some drawings included within this archive that may help you
put this project together (see the first section of this file for
their names and what they are pictures of).  You may look at them with
any program that display standard Amiga IFF pictures, and you may
print them out so that you have them at hand.

Now we will begin putting the Multi-Kickstart Board Project together.
You may check off each number as you perform each step so when you
take a break you can easily continue where you left off.


[ ] 1.  Read this entire document before going on to step 2! Never
work on a project until you have read all the instructions at least
once!


[ ] 2.  If you would like to test the blank board for shorts prior to
putting it together, you can assemble the continuity tester shown in
the drawing "TMKBP31Probes.iff". If you do not have access to the
supplies to build the continuity tester, or if you do not want to test
the board for shorts, then check off steps 2 and 3, and go on to step
4. If you do want to test the board for shorts, then using the
continuity tester shown in the drawing, check to make sure that the +5
volt line and ground line are not shorted together.  To do this touch
the (+) probe of the continuity tester to the pin 14 location of U1 on
the board and the (-) probe to the pin 7 location of U1 on the board.
If the LED lights, that means there is a short.  If this condition 
exists, check the board for a short and remove that short. 


[ ] 3.  If you've built the continuity tester, then check and test the
board for open lines and shorts by using the continuity tester and the
schematic in the drawing "TMKBP31Schematic.iff"; check to see that all
the lines on the printed circuit board are connected as they should
be.


[ ] 4.  Now we are going to solder the four sockets to the printed
circuit board one at a time.  Place the three 40 pin IC sockets on the
top side of the printed circuit board so that pin 1 of the socket is
in the top left corner of each of the socket locations marked ROM1,
ROM2, and ROM3.  Place the 14 pin IC socket in the top right corner of
the board in the location marked U1.  Pin 1 of this socket is at the
bottom left.  When placing the sockets on the board and prior to
soldering, make sure you do not bend any of the pins.  The top side of
the printed circuit board is the side with the silkscreen stating the
name and revision number of the board.  Refer to tips 5, 6, and 7 (in
the "Tips For Building The Multi-Kickstart Board Project" section) for
a few helpful hints.


[ ] 5.  Solder the three capacitors (C1, C2, and C3) to the printed
circuit board.  The capacitors are non-polarized and can go in either
direction.  They go in the locations marked C1, C2, and C3.  The
capacitors are .01uF capacitors.  Refer to tips 5, 6, and 7.


[ ] 6.  Solder the three resistors (R1, R2, and R3) to the printed
circuit board.  The resistors go in the locations on the printed
circuit board marked R1, R2, and R3.  Just like the capacitors the
resistors can go in the board in either direction.  All three
resistors are 330 ohm resistors.  Refer to tips 5, 6, and 7.


[ ] 7.  If you have an Amiga 2000, see "Installation Of The Multi-
Kickstart Board Project" to determine which motherboard revision you
have. This is necessary in order to determine the length and
orientation of the 40 wire ribbon cable used in step 8.


[ ] 8.   You will eventually need to cut the 40 wire ribbon cable to a
length that you feel will fit in your computer properly.  We give you
a six inch cable so that you can cut it down to the size that best 
fits your system.  On a newer revision Amiga 2000 a length of about 
1.75 inches works good, but double check to make sure.  On the older 
revision 2000 the ROM was put into the machine reverse of how it is in
the 500 and newer version 2000; on the old version, pin 1 of the ROM 
is facing forward. We have never seen the old revision Amiga 2000 
except in pictures.  We figure that if you have the old version you
will have to mount The Multi-Kickstart Board Project upside down with 
the red stipe facing forward, keep this in mind when measuring the 
length of your cable.  On a 500 the length you choose will depend on 
what other items you may have stuffed under your 500's cover.  After 
you get a good length, add about a half an inch for soldering 
purposes.


[ ] 9.  Now cut the cable.


[ ] 10.  Once the cable is cut, peel the wires away from each other 
about a half inch.  See cable drawing "TMKBP31Ribbon.iff".


[ ] 11.  Strip the ends of all the wires about 1/8 of an inch.


[ ] 12.  Tin the ends of the wires with solder.


[ ] 13.  Pin forty of the cable is the wire with the red stripe.  See
cable drawing "TMKBP31Ribbon.iff" for wire and hole numbering.  We 
will call the top of the cable the part that faces up when the teeth 
of the connector points down.  Starting with the red wire, bend every
other wire up at a forty five degree angle and the other wires down at
a forty five degree angle.  This zig-zag pattern will allow the cable
to fit in the holes labeled CN1.


[ ] 14.   Place the wires in the holes by matching the numbers in the
drawing "TMKBP31Ribbon.iff" and then solder the wires to the board.  
Refer to tips 8, 9, and 10.


[ ] 15.  The last thing you need to do is assemble the switch harness.
The switch harness consists of the three position switch and the four
wire ribbon cable that connects to it.  Peel each wire on the four
wire switch cable at both ends about half an inch.


[ ] 16.  Strip those wires.


[ ] 17.  Tin those wires.


[ ] 18.  Following the drawing "TMKBP31Switch.iff", solder the wires,
as shown, to the switch.  In operation the switch should allow only
one wire at a time to be connected to ground (GND).


[ ] 19.  Now that the switch harness is finished, solder its wires to
the board using the numbers on the board and the drawing
"TMKBP31Switch.iff" as a guide.  Refer to tips 8, and 9.


[ ] 20.  Place the 74LS32 (U1) into the U1 socket.  Be VERY careful
that you do not bend any of the pins.  Make sure that you insert the
chip in the right direction.  Pin 1 at the bottom left.  Pin 1 is at
the end of the chip that is marked with a notch.


We are now finished with assembly of The Multi-Kickstart Board
Project.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Testing Of The Multi-Kickstart Board Project:

Before you place your ROMs into any of the sockets it is a good idea
that you run through this little test to make sure that the logic
circuitry on the board is operating correctly.  Running through this
test will help pin point and solve any problems before they happen. 
For this test you will need to obtain the parts and construct a simple
logic probe as shown in the drawing "TMKBP31Probes.iff". If you are
not able to get the parts to build the logic probe, or you do not want
to test what you have just built, then skip the rest of this section
and go on to the section "Installation Of The Multi-Kickstart Board
Project"


[ ] 1.  Apply +5 volts to the left side of one of the capacitors and 
ground to the right side of one of the capacitors.  This will energize
the board.


[ ] 2.  Place the (+) probe of the logic probe on pin 14 of U1 and the
(-) probe on pin 7 of U1.  The LED should light.  If the LED does not
light then U1 is not receiving power.  If this is the case disconnect
power and look for an open or short circuit and fix it.  Once you pass
this test go to the next step.


[ ] 3.  Connect pin 12 of the ribbon cable to +5 volts.  Next take the
(-) probe and touch pin 12 and take the (+) probe and touch pin 21 of
each ROM socket.  The LED should stay off at each of these points. 
Repeat this test for each switch position.  If the LED turns on at any
of these points re-check the switch wiring and board traces.  If all
the wiring is okay, the 74LS32 is bad, replace the chip and test
again.  Once you pass this test go to the next step.


[ ] 4.  Disconnect the +5 volts from pin 12 of the ribbon cable and 
connect pin 12 of the ribbon cable to ground.  Take the (-) probe and 
touch it to pin 12 and the (+) probe and touch pin 21 of each ROM 
socket.  With the switch in position one, pins 12 and 21 of socket 
ROM1 should be the only ones to light the LED.  Place the switch to
position two, touch pins 12 and 21 of all the ROM sockets, and now 
pins 12 and 21 of ROM2 should be the only ones to light the LED.  
Place the switch to position three, touch pins 12 and 21 of all the
ROM sockets, now pins 12 and 21 of ROM3 should be the only ones to 
light the LED.  Repeat this test several times with the switch in 
different positions to insure proper operation.  If the board failed
this test recheck the wiring of the switch and check the board for
opens and shorts, and fix the problem.  If you do not find any opens,
shorts or other problems replace the 74LS32 (U1) and retest. Once you
pass this test, disconnect the ground from pin 12 of the ribbon cable.
Your project is now ready to install in your Amiga computer.

Installation Of The Multi-Kickstart Board Project:


The instructions below are based on the instructions that Commodore
provides with the 2.04 Kickstart ROM.  We added more steps to the
installation instructions so that they could be used for The Multi-
Kickstart Board Project.  Installation instructions for both the 500
and the 2000 are provided.


             - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


Installation Instructions For Amiga 500 Systems:



[ ] 1. With power disconnected and the 500 upside down, remove the six
screws holding the case together with a #10 torx driver.


[ ] 2. Place the 500 right side up and carefully remove the top cover.


[ ] 3. Disconnect the keyboard harness and the ground strap.


[ ] 4. Using a pliers, bend up the four tabs that hold the shield,
then remove the four screws that also hold the shield.  The shield
should come out by lifting it straight up.


[ ] 5. The Kickstart ROM will be located to the right of the 68000,
in the U6 position.  It should be marked 315093-01 or 315093-02.


[ ] 6. Remove the Kickstart ROM from the motherboard and place it in
any one of the ROM sockets on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project.  Also
place your 2.04 Kickstart ROM in any one of the other ROM sockets. 
The placement of the ROMs is up to you.  Place them in the positions
that you feel comfortable with.  The ROM positions 1, 2, and 3 match
the switch positions 1, 2, and 3.  Refer to tips 11, and 12.


[ ] 7. There are many different versions of the Amiga 500 motherboard.
You will have to determine which mother board you have and make 
modifications accordingly.  The revision number of the mother board is
printed on the top right front corner of the mother board.


[ ] 8. If you have a Rev 3 or a Rev 5 mother board you must have
pins 1 and 31 of the ROMs jumpered together.  In this case you do not
have to do anything because The Multi-Kickstart Board Project already
has this done at JMP1.


[ ] 9. If you have a Rev 6A or higher motherboard you must cut the
jumper at JMP1 on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project with an X-acto
knife or something equivalent (refer to the drawing "TMKBP31Board.iff"
to find the jumper).  If the 2.04 Kickstart ROM comes with a jumper
connecting pins 1 and 31 you must also cut or remove this jumper.


[ ] 10. Place the board gently inside the Amiga.  Take the 40 pin DIP
connector and insert it into the ROM socket of the mother board.  The
red stripe on the cable should be to the back of the computer and The
Multi-Kickstart Board Project should be sitting to the right of the
68000.  Pin one of the ROM socket is in the top left corner.  When
inserting the DIP connector make sure that you do not bend any of the
pins on the connector or misalign the connector.  After inserting the
DIP connector examine the connection to make sure it was done properly
and that no bent pins exist.  Refer to tips 11 and 12.


[ ] 11. Now comes  the time for you  to mount the board.  On one of
our computers we simply glued a piece of nonconductive and nonstatic
foam underneath The Multi-Kickstart Board Project and simply let the
board sit on top of the mother board.  On another computer we glued
plastic feet to the board and let it sit on the mother board.  It is
okay to mount the board any way that is acceptable to you as long as
you do not short any lines on the mother board or The Multi-Kickstart
Board Project.


[ ] 12. The next thing you need to do is run the cable for your switch.
It is best to run the cable through one of the holes in the back of
the computer.  For the most part any way of running the cable should
be okay as long as you don't pinch or scrape the  wire on any sharp
piece of metal.  Refer to tip 12.


[ ] 13. Before putting your computer completely back together it
might be a good idea to confirm that the system is working properly
with The Multi-kickstart Board Project installed.  Put the computer
together to the point where it will work.  Set the switch to a ROM
position and turn on the computer.  The computer should boot as normal
into that version of Kickstart.  Turn off the computer and set the
switch to the next ROM position.  Turn on the computer again; the
computer should now boot into that version of Kickstart.  Repeat this
test for all the ROMs that you have installed.  If the computer does
not operate as expected check your installation.  If the installation
seems okay and the system still does not work as expected, repeat the
tests on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project (in the section "Testing Of
The Multi-Kickstart Board Project"). If everything worked out okay and
the ROMs switch properly, you can now put your computer back together,
put your tools away and play.  Refer to tip 12.

Installation Instructions For Amiga 2000 Systems: 



[ ] 1. With the power off, remove the cover of the 2000 by taking out
the five screws holding the cover to the body of the computer.  Take
the cover off by sliding it toward the front and up.


[ ] 2. Remove the power supply and disk drive assembly by taking out
the seven screws holding it to the body.  You should also disconnect
the power supply and drive cables from the motherboard.


[ ] 3. You must now determine the revision of the mother board and
the location of the Kickstart ROM.  The older version of the 2000
mother board has "© 1986 COMMODORE","AMIGA 2000" and "MADE IN GERMANY
(BSW)" on the left side of the board.  The Kickstart ROM is located
at U2, just to the right of the 68000 with pin 1 toward the front of
the machine.

The newer version of the 2000 motherboard is marked with "B2000-CR" in
the lower left corner.  The Kickstart ROM is located at U500, which is
located just to the right of the 68000 and below Fat Agnus.  Pin 1 of
the ROM is located toward the back of the machine. 

The ROM should be marked with the number 315093-01 or 315093-02.


[ ] 4. Remove the Kickstart ROM from the mother board and place it in
any one of the ROM sockets on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project.  Also
place your 2.04 Kickstart ROM in any one of the other ROM sockets. 
The placement of the ROMs is up to you.  Place  them in the positions
that you feel comfortable with.  The ROM positions 1, 2, and 3 match
the switch positions 1, 2, and 3.  Refer to tips 11,and 12.


[ ] 5. For the older version motherboards you must have pins 1 and 31
of the ROMs jumpered together.  In this case you do not have to do
anything because The Multi-Kickstart Board Project already has this
done at JMP1.


[ ] 6. If you have the newer version mother board you must cut the
jumper at JMP1 on The Multi-Kickstart Board Project with an X-acto
knife or something equivalent (refer to the drawing "TMKBP31Board.iff"
to find the jumper). If the 2.04 Kickstart ROM comes with a jumper
connecting pins 1 and 31 you must also cut or remove this jumper.


[ ] 7. Place the board gently inside the Amiga.  Take the 40 pin DIP
connector and insert it into the ROM socket of the mother board.  The
red stripe on the cable should be to the back of the computer if you
have the newer version mother board, and toward the front of the 
computer if you have the older version mother board. When inserting
the DIP connector make sure that you do not bend any of the pins on
the connector or misalign the DIP connector.  After inserting the 
connector, examine the connection to make sure it was done properly
and that no bent pins exist.  Refer to tips 11, and 12.


[ ] 8. Now comes the time for you to mount the board.  On one of our
computers we simply glued a piece of nonconductive and nonstatic foam
underneath The Multi-Kickstart Board Project and simply let the board
sit on top of the mother board.  On another computer we glued plastic
feet to The Multi-Kickstart Board Project and let it sit on the mother
board.  It is okay to mount the board any way that is acceptable to
you as long as you do not short any lines on the mother board or The
Multi-Kickstart Board Project.  On the newer version of the mother
board, The Multi-kickstart Board Project will most likely sit with the
component side up.  Because pin 1 on the older version mother board is
facing forward, you will most likely have to flip the board over and
mount it with the component side down.  In both cases The Multi-
Kickstart Board Project will most likely sit to the right of the
68000.  Refer to tip 12.


[ ] 9. The next thing you need to do is run the cable for your switch.
It is best to run the cable through one of the holes in the back of
the computer.  For the most part, any way of running the wire should
be okay as long as you don't pinch or scrape the  wire on any sharp
piece of metal.  Refer to tip 12.


[ ] 10. Before putting your computer completely back together it might
be a good idea to confirm that the system is working properly with The
Multi-Kickstart Board Project installed.  Put the computer together to
the point where it will work.  Set the switch to a ROM position and 
turn on the computer.  The computer should boot as normal into that 
version of Kickstart.  Turn off the computer and set the switch to the
next ROM position.  Turn on the computer again, the computer should 
now boot into that version of Kickstart.  Repeat this test for all the
ROMs that you have installed.  If the computer does not operate as 
expected check your installation.  If the installation seems okay and
the system still does not work as expected, repeat the tests on The 
Multi-Kickstart Board Project (in the section "Testing Of The Multi-
Kickstart Board Project").  If everything worked out okay and the ROMs
switch properly, you now can put your computer back together, put away
your tools and play. Refer to tip 12.

Tips For Building The Multi-Kickstart Board Project:

When building projects like this for the first time, it is very easy
to make mistakes and errors.  I've built many electronic projects and
have found many different ways of doing things that save both time and
headaches.  I have already built a few of these kits so that I could
get a good feel of what needs to be done in order to make this a
smooth and easy project to put together.  Below I have put together a
few tips that should help you greatly in putting this kit together. A
few of them are repeats from what I said earlier in the text.

1. Make sure all the parts NOT marked "OPTIONAL" in the parts list are
in the kit.

2. Read all instructions before you ever start a project so that you
can get a feel of what you will need to do.

3. Do not try to finish the project in one sitting.  If you rush 
through it you will probably make some mistakes.

4. Plan out how you are going to do something before you do it.

5. Allow the soldering iron to heat up prior to starting and keep the
tip of the iron clean with a damp cloth.

6. Do not put blobs of solder on the board.  Put only enough solder to
get the job done.  The solder should flow between the pad and the
component's lead.

7. When soldering, do not allow the iron to stay on the board for more
than ten seconds.

8. When cutting, peeling, and stripping, ribbon cable or any other
wire, measure and mark the cable prior to doing any cutting or
stripping.  Use a permanent fine point marker to mark the points of
cutting, peeling, and stripping.  Cut the wire at the first marked
point, peel the cable to the third marked point, and strip the wire at
the second marked point.  If you do this you will come out with a
neatly prepared cable ready for installing.

9. It is a good idea to tin a wire with solder right after its been
stripped so that the fine strands of wire don't break off or frizz
out.

10. So that you don't peel your ribbon cable down farther than you
want to go, a good idea is to place a piece of tape at the point you
would like the peeling to stop.  The tape will not allow you to go
past that point.

11. Before turning on the power, always check for bent pins and proper
alignment after installing ICs.

12. Because the inside of your computer is a static sensitive 
environment, do not touch any parts inside your computer unless you
have grounded yourself. To ground yourself simply touch the grounded
case of your computer or attach yourself to a grounded strap.
