          yKick -- zKick like Kickstart file loader for A1000

     USAGE
          KICKFILE/K,START/N,END/N,TO/K,NORESET/S:

          KICKFILE   or '-f'  force next argument to be the kickfile
          START      or '-s'  set begin of fast memory (default: $200000)
          END        or '-e'  set end of fast memory (default: $400000)
          TO         or '-o'  write relocated A1000 kickload file
          NORESET    or '-c'  load kickstart file but don't reboot

     REQUIREMENTS
          o Amiga 1000 w/ RAM expansion which needs to be configured
            by "KickPatch" or "AddMem" and
          o The Commodore (or ZKick) A500/2000 kickfile37.175

     DISTRIBUTION
          This versions of yKick and AddMem are NOT in the PUBLIC DOMAIN.
          You can however freely distribute them if all parts listed in
          the original `Distfile' are distributed together AND WITHOUT
          COMMERCIAL PURPOSES!

     DESCRIPTION
          yKick allows the usage of Kickstart 2.0 for A1000 users who
          do not have an auto configurating memory board and therefor
          can not use Daniel Zenchelsky's ZKick.

          yKick takes advantage of the Amiga 1000 WOM which offers 256K
          of Kickstart memory at 0xFC0000.  This is possible because the
          Kickstart file of V37.175 can easily be split.

          yKick splits the zKick Kickstart file V37.175 into two parts
          of 256K each and places one of them into your WOM and the
          other one into any location in your fast memory you like.

          yKick relocates and patches the Kickstart file for A1000 usage
          on every startup.  You don't need to create an adapted Kick20
          file as you do when using versions of Bernd Harder's "Kickload"
          and "Kick2".  Nevertheless, yKick is very fast.

          If you prefer the usage of Bernd Harder's "Kickload" for any
          reason yKick can be used to replace his hyper-slow "Kick2"
          tool with the yKick option '-o'.

          To install yKick you need the old Kickstart 1.x "Version" command
          and prepend the following to your startup-sequence


              Version1x >NIL: graphics.library 37
              If WARN
                yKick DEVS:Kickstart
              EndIf

              ;--- 2.0 STARTUP-SEQUENCE GOES HERE ---

     NOTE
          yKick replaces your 256K Kickstart (1.3 or less) but it needs
          the original 256K Kickstart reset code for a very short time
          when coming up.  This reset code MUST NOT be patched!
          YOU CAN NOT use a Kickstart disk which is patched by
          "KickPatch" (supplied with some memory boards) or a similar
          application.

          You can however use AddMem before running yKick but you don't
          need AddMem when running Kickstart 2.0 with yKick.  yKick will
          automatically add your fast memory to the system free pool
          during a reset.

          An improved version of AddMem is supplied with yKick.  It
          does not cause a crash if you try to add memory twice.
          The here supplied version of AddMem can also be used to link
          additional fast memory AFTER yKick'ing to Kick 2.0.
