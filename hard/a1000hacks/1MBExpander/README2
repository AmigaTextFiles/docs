The next few postings describe in detail an expansion board that you can
build to add 1MB of memory and a clock to your amiga.  Note that this
memory and clock DOES NOT conform to the standard Amiga expansion
architecture, and as such, won't autoconfig.  You probably won't be able
to use a standard expansion box with this either.  With that said, here
it is.  It was forwarded to me by a friend who got it sent to him by
someone who got if off of a BBS...  You get the idea. 

I have no idea if this works or not.  Hey, it could smoke your system 
for all I know.  The schematic looks resonable enough, but I'm not a
hardcore hardware hacker.

Do what you wish with it; if it doesn't work, I sure won't be held
responsable.   Look at the README file for more info about where it
came from.
