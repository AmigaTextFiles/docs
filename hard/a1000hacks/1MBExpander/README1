Start with mem.doc for an overview of the project. This document will
explain the other files.

If you have any comments or questions about the documentation, leave me
Email on the Denver Amiga BBS, (303) 693-4735.  If you cannot get the board
to work, please try to get local help from some technical type. I cannot
debug miswiring over the phone.

Several people have asked about expanding the board.  I have two
suggestions. If you can, the easy thing to do would be to use 1 meg chips.
These are very expensive at present, but would give you a 4 meg board.  The
extra address multiplexer is already there, only a little rework of the
select lines is needed.  A second copy of the memory array is possible,
including the drivers.  If you do this, you must add another chip to develop
more ras lines.  Also, you will have to add a power supply since the Amiga
cannot handle more chips than are on the present design.

entire archive file is copyright 1986 by Michael W. Fellinger, 1590 Quince
Ave. Boulder, Co 80302.  Any contributions cheerfully accepted at that
address. Anyone interested in commercial use should contact me first.

My next hardware project for the Amiga will be a cheap hard disk interface.
Anyone interested should leave me Email. At this time, the hardware has been
figured out, but I need a device driver. Help would be appreciated.
