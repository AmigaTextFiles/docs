I got this from the net a while ago, and tried it out on my A1000.
(I went for the switch option, and mount it on the front panel 
beside DF0). It worked fine for me, but usual disclaimers etc. apply.

Disabling the filters on the A1000
----------------------------------
To disable the audio filter on an Amiga 1000 snip one leg of capacitors
C103 & C104.  These capacitors should be right next to each other.  If
you are more ambitious you could hook up a DPST switch to switch the
filter capacitors in and out.  Make sure you use shielded cable that has
two internal conductors for each capacitor.  The shielding should be
hooked up to ground.  BTW, the capacitors are located beneath the
"daughter board" so you'll have to remove it first to access the
two little beasties.  If for some reason this doesn't work for your
1000 version than all you'll need to do is put a tad of solder on the
snipped leg and all will be back to normal.
