The files in this archive will explain how it's done!!

This archive contains the following:

Abouthack.readfirst!  - (this file) Introduction to this whole mess!
3000-50mhz.txt        - Original text Ren and I downloaded
A3000-50.readme       - Aminet readme description file
Hack.responses        - Our responses to the board where we got the file.
Rens3000              - AIBB 6.1 mod created on Rens 3000 after the Hack

Upon reading the orginial file on how to do the hack we were very unsure about it. We don't expect
you to feel any differently after reading the file.  So we enclosed our feelings about the hack in
the file Hack.responses and made an AIBB 6.1 mod on the hacked 3000 as proof that it works.  If you
don't have the program "Amiga Intuition Based Benchmarks" (AIBB) then you should get it - it's the
best speed comparison program available.

IMPORTANT!!! When reading the original file, one of the things that really screwed us up, was that
fact that whenever the guy talks about a "wire" going into the board he really means a "trace".

I suggest you read the files in the order above - (it'll make more sense that way)
