   *** BUILD A *QUALITY* AUDIO DIGITIZER FOR YOUR AMIGA FOR UNDER $20 !!!***

OK, I finally got my audio digitizer working after a lot of help from one
of the applications engineers from National Semiconductor. He works on the
team that came up with the A/D in this project. Thanks a million!!!

On to the fun stuff!!!!

First off, here is the correct parts list. DON'T use the other ones below
from the original articles!!! They are WRONG!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 ADC0804   A/D Convertor
1 LM386N    Audio Amp
1 100K      Trim Pot
1 .1uF      Capacitor
1 10uF      Electrolytic Capacitor
1 47pf      Disk Capacitor
1 10K       Resistor
1 DB25      Male connector
1 Female RCA or Mini jack
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I built mine on a piece of perf board 2" x 3.5" in size. Drill holes for
the RCA jack and the 100K pot shaft. Make all the solder connections as
shown in the schematic I drew. I take no responsibility for any problems
caused by or resulting from this schematic. I drew it exactly the way that
I have mine wired up, and it worked fine! I suggest using sockets for the
2 IC's as the ADC0804 cost ~$12.00 !! Pick a good layout before doing the
project because you can get this thing really small if you try hard. I
made the mistake of laying mine out poorly, and ended up having to cross
over the 8 data lines from the A/D to the DB25!! Think ahead and save
yourself some trouble. 

I have used the digitizer with AGMSRecordSound/Playsound, MED 3.21,
AniMan, and VCLI4. It has worked great with all of them. The quality of
the samples it takes can be very good. One thing that I have noticed is
that electric guitars and high pitched rapid sounds tend to sound very
scratchy, but this is pretty common on digitizers. For $4.95, Radio Shack
also sells a cheepo-microphone. If you are just in this to play around
with VCLI and AniMan, then this is the perfect thing to get.

Future Possibilities:

In an attempt to alleviate some of the scratchiness, I might attempt some
sort of filter subcircuit. According to my boss (an EE) this should take
care of the problem, and reduce some clipping at high volume levels.

Alright, here is the original documentation. Use it more as a guide as to
what can be done with this project. DON'T USE THEIR PARTS LISTS!!!!!!

************************ READ AT YOUR OWN RISK **************************
                           ORIGINAL DOCS


     NOTE: Although I re-typed these instructions off of paper, I take no credit
for the contents of this file. I typed exactly what I read off the paper and
only made cosmetic changes to the look of the text file. Meaning, I only made
it look better. I did not, to the best of my knowledge, change any of the
wording or directions that follow. I also re-drew the schematics off paper
using Deluxe Paint. Use a IFF picture viewer to see this picture, contained in
the file called Schematic. Again, I only made a few cosmetic changes to the
look of the schematic. I can not be sure that I didn't change something along
the way of typing or drawing it on the computer. For this reason I must say
that I can take no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer
system from using this device. Use at your own risk!

   OK, now that that is out of the way, let me say this. I am very impressed
with samples I've heard from this audio digitizer. It can be built for $15 to
$20 dollars and consists of 9 parts! You can make a PC board for it or simply
wire everything together. It will work with Perfect Sound, Audio Master II, and
several other audio digitizing programs on the market. The sound quality is as
good as any comercial devices I've heard samples from. It uses the same audio
to digital conversion chip that the Perfect Sound digitizer uses. The only
drawback to this device is that it can not sample in sterio. By this I mean
that it can only sample one channel at a time, the left or right channel. This
is not a problem, as a program like Perfect Sound will let you get around this.
To create a sterio sample you need only to do a little more work. First sample
the left channel, then the right channel, and then choose the menu command to
create sterio. The software will then splice the two together to create sterio!
I'd say this is a minor price to pay for saving $80 on the price of a sterio
digitizer.


   I was told to try Jamaco Electronics at 1-415-592-8097 for the rest of these
parts, but I'm sure a lot of other places also carry them. There are a lot of
different types of plugs you can use in place of the RCA type. Simply choose the
type you want and if it will be male or female. Most people will use a female
RCA plug. Get one that rack-mounts. I also picked up a small plastic box with
IC project-board, 8 screws, 4 rubber feet, 2 label panels, all included in one
package (Part 270-291a). It measures 3 7/16"x2 5/16"x1 3/16" and cost me $4.49.
There are several small PC boards and cases at Radio Shack that will work fine.
Just remember to think small. This layout doesn't need much room. I plan to melt
(I always use a screwdriver to melt my holes instead of drill them.) two holes
into this case. One will be in the middle-rear side of the box for the RCA plug.
The next will be on top of the box for the pot. I also plan to cut a hole, using
a hot exact'o knife, into the front of the box for the printer port connector.
One hole will be melted on each side of this for two screws to hold the printer
connector in place. A few labels, here and there, and we're all done. There are
many ways one could go about building a case for this. I just thought I'd give
some people an idea.

   Before you digitize something your going to want to set your input level. If
the input level is too high or low, the recording results will not be as good as
they should be. To do this via Perfect Sound:

   1. Choose "View Signal Levels" under the "Digitize" menu option.
   2. Look at the "L" (Left channel.) or "R" (Right channel.) display at the
       bottom of the screen. Three numbers will be shown. The first is the
       smallest value ever digitized, the next is the highest ever digitized,
       and the last number is the current value. If your input level is too high
       ,then the smallest value will stay at 0 and highest value will be around
       255. If your input level is at too low a level, the values will change
       only a little.
   3. Adjust the volume of your output device and the pot on the digitizer 
       until you get the right readings.

   Now your ready to digitize. Changing the sample rate will alter the quality
of the recording. A high sample rate will give a good recording, but eats up
memory a lot faster than a lower sample rate. Certain samples will sound fine at
a low rate of 8000, or less. While other samples will require a sample rate of
10000, or more. Play around until you find the best setting for what your doing.

   Hope I've helped made the project a little easier for some of you. What
follows is the original instructions.

                               You can reach me on CA-AUG at 216-292-4404.

   This is a simple two chip audio digitizer for the Amiga (Specifically the
500, but the DB25 pinouts can be changed for the other models.). The parts list
is:

Qty   Item/Desc               Value
-----------------------------------
1     Resistor                1K
1     Pot                     100K
3     Capacitors              .1uF,47pF,10uF
1     Mini Plug or RCA Plug
1     Connector               DB25
1     A/D Converter           ADC0804 (HeathKit usually has these.)
1     Audio Amp               LM386N  (Radio Shack)

   This circuit will work with the program from the Perfect Sound digitizer with
one small exception- it won't digitize in stereo.

   All the Vcc's (Pin 20 on the ADC0804 and pin 6 on the LM386N) can be powered
from the printer port (at least it is working for mine with no power supply
problems!).

   Use the monitor signal level option in the Perfect Sound program to adjust
the pot to the correct level (NOTE: If the circuit is hooked to a line level-
e.g. to the Audio-Out of a VCR or sterio- the pot should be turned WAY down.
Just listen to the "monitor" and you'll see what I mean.).

   I do have this circuit built and running on my Amiga so I know it works. I
just hope you can read the diagram!

   The digitizer plans were made to connect to an A500 parallel port. However,
this will not work on the A1000 without some changes.

   If you have an A1000:

   Pin 10 (ACK*) is the same on both the A500 and A1000.
   Pin 2 to 9 (Data bits) don't change either.
   Pin 14 in the A500 is +5V (100 mA). Use pin 23 on the A1000 for this.
   Pins 17 to 25 on the A500 are signal to ground. Use pin 14 on the A1000 for
        this.
