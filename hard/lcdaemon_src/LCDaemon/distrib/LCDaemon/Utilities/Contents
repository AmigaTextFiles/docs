This directory contains some useful programs to control your LCD.

LCDecho puts a text on the LCD. Handy for your startup-sequence or
in scripts.

Furthermore, the First Ever Application To Support LCDaemon (FEATSLCD®)
is included: some program I wrote ages ago and never bothered to upload
to Aminet. It is called ResetIntercept, is written in Amiga E¹, and
since I use it I have never had to validate my harddisk again!

The program introduces some time between the press of Control-A-A and
the actual reset. It only works on Amigas with a detachable keyboard.
Try it, if it doesn't work for you, tough luck!

If it does work, though, you'll be presented with a countdown requester,
an optional sample and now: a message on the LCD²!

The handle directory contains the compiled version of the test program
for handle allocation and programmable character support. It is not
useful as a stand-alone program, but included for demonstration purposes.

Finally, you'll find SysMon, the SEATSLCD® ;-) This program is a little
(very little, actually) system monitor that displays the currently
available memory, the date and time on your LCD. It is running as a
LCDPRI_MEMDISPLAY so virtually anything gets higher priority for the
LCD. Since this program is included at the very last moment, no
doc file is available yet. No problem, since the two only parameters
are:
·   UPDATEDELAY or UD : time in jiffys (50ths of a second) between updates.
    Defaults to 50 (1s) but I suggest lowering it to about 5 seconds,
    similar to the Workbench display. It places a burden of about 3-4%
    to your Amiga, @ UD=50 jiffies, but this figure decreases with
    increasing UD factor. Furthermore, SysMon sets its priority
    to -1 automatically, so you needn't be concerned about useful
    computing time being stolen. You could use the LCDaemon parameter TASKPRI
    as well, but if you're that cheap about cycles you should have bought
    an A4000/040 to start with! ;-)
    (Valid range 1/50 sec ... 10 minutes)(Default 50 = 1 second)

·   QUITAFTER or Q : time in retries (!) that SysMon will try
    to put data on the LCD. If SysMon starts getting LCDERR_TOOBUSY because
    some other program is doing a LCDMSG_ALLOCATE or other exclusive stuff,
    it will retry QUITAFTER times before quitting. If you don't want this
    feature, just set a bloody large value.
    (Valid range 2 (!) ... infinity)(Default 20)

An new version of SysMon, written especially for the Executive task
scheduling system is also available. It is called SysInfo and has
no command line options. It will use the first line of the display to
display available chip and fast memory. A CPU usage bar is overlaid over
this memory display. If a second line is available, it is used to display
the date and time.

lcd-handler is an extremely beta version of a handler allowing you to

mount lcd: from lcd
echo test >lcd:100/20 (devicename:time/priority)

Reports are welcomed. I'd like to see this evolve into a CON: -like handler,
but I'd prefer that users work on LCDaemon client programs. I haven't got enough
time to develop both the daemon and everything else!
