		Accelerator Notes		leslie Ayling

	Numerous people have been in contact with me regarding the 14MHz
accelerator project as described in Megadisk 15.(As far away as Canada and
Norway..Megadisk sure gets around.)Thanks for all your support and
suggestions for future projects!
	Here are a few problems which some people had which don't appear
obvious at first.

	1. If you are using ribbon cable to the switch , make sure to
seperate the conductors as some ribbon cables exhibit a cross-conductor
capacitance. Hence the ground wires seperating the various signals on the
disk-drive connector for example.This could stop the system working at all.

	2. Make SURE that you are supplied with the 16MHz version of the
processor. The 12.5MHz version carries a similar part number but is not up
to our demands. The 16MHz version should have "16MHz" printed on its case
underneath the Motorola part number.
