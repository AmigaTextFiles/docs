Some people have complained of problems using the mod with the serial port.

This could occur as the frequency of the clock on the two CIA's is now
double as they are both fed from the E clock of the 68000. Hence if our
68000 clock is doubled the E clock is also doubled. Therefore the timers in
the CIA's will be operating at twice the speed as normal .

When selecting the BAUD rate on any particular program just divide by two.
In other words if you want to use a 2400 baud modem through the serial port
just select 1200baud on your communications program.
or if you are using 1200 baud modems select 600baud from your menu.


I don't have a modem on the AMIGA so I haven't tried this out but
theoretically it should work..      regards Leslie Ayling.
