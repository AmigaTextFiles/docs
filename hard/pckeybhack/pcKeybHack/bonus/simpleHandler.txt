Last minute...a one hour program ! Perhaps it will crash your Amiga.

This small example install a simple handler that change the rawkey codes
75 to 7C into something printable.

usage:

- tie low the pin number 8 of the 8051,

- open a shell and type "run simplehandler",

- hit home and a '5' should appear
- hit end and a '6' should appear
- try pageUp, pageDown, printScreen, scrollLock, F11, F12

AMAZING ! no ?:-)

- to remove this handler click on the close gadget of the small window,
yes on top !

That's all, it's too late !


Hope someone will make a wonderful commoditie or a powerful handler.
(Send me the source please ;-)
