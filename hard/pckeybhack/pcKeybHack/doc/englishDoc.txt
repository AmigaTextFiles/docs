Many people want to use a PeeCee keyboard instead of the Amiga keyboard so,
this archive is an update to the hack made by Eric Rudoph in 1991
(aminet hard/hack/ibmKeyboard.lha).
I build this hack and it work great with my Amiga 1200, so I decide to put my
work in an archive in aminet because the original one is "fairly involved".

I give you:

	a shematic instead of a long text,
	a PCB to build the interface (not very beautiful because there are
	many wire bridges needed but it work),
	a binary (without the XT support) to put in an 2732 eprom.
    some improvements...


For 1200 owner, like me, we must first do another hack to have an external
keyboard port, the way to do that is in archive A1200exkeyb.lha (hard/hack).
The only thing that I would like to say about this hack is that I DON'T CUT
ANYTHING IN MY 1200 the two keyboards work perfectly (but Your Mileage May
Vary).
***NOTE: the reset will be driven by the micro-controler, so no external
reset button.


In this archive You can find:

	doc/frenchDoc.txt		( french doc)
	doc/otherStuf.txt		( the most important file )
	doc/englishDoc.txt		{ this file }
	onlyAT.asm		( source file )
	onlyAT.hex		( hex for hex eprommer  )
	onlyAT.bin		( binary for binary eprommer  )
	keymaps/fPC		( a french keymap to put in your devs/keymaps)
    bonus/simpleHandler.c   (example to show how to change the  xtra keys )
    bonus/simpleHandler     (binary)
    bonus/simpleHandler.txt (english doc)

some very useful files in EPS form (my work is done on a PeeCee so...):

You need a postscript printer to print these files correctly; take care at the
scale of the PCB (VERY IMPORTANT).

	pcKeyPCB.eps 	( PCB - Printed Circuit Board - )
	pcKeyshem.eps	( a great shematic - without IC's  power supply - )
	pcKeyTop.eps	( component side, top view of PCB )

and some uggly and unusable pictures (just to give a preview)

    pic/pcb.gif
    pic/shem.gif
    pic/top.gif

Now have a look at "otherStuf.txt", all you need is there.


I recommend these archives

	A1200ExKeyb.lha ( only for A1200 owner ;-)
	editKeys.lha	{ useful to make your own keymap }



I would like to thanks

Eric Rudolph for his idea,
David Kinder for EditKeys,
All the people who make good hacks,
Me for doing this.

I use the registered version of the great and well supported FrexxEd,
so thanks Daniel Stenberg & Kjell Ericson.


Is there a good (Amiga) software to make electronic projects from shematic
to PCB ?
