THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE...

Parts:
=====

	U1:    8051 / 8031
	U2:    74LS373 (octal latches)
	U3:    eprom 2732 or 2716
	Q1:    11.0592 Mhz quatz
	C1,C2: 30pF capacitor
	JP2:   solder the 5 lines of Amiga (kbClock, KbData, KbReset, GND, 5 V)
	JP1:   wire a DIN 5 female to plug the PeeCee keyboard like this:

	front view not solder view
       -v-
      /   \
     |3   1|   1 = KBClk
     | 5 4 |   2 = KBDat
     |  2  |   3 = NC
      \___/    4 = Gnd.
               5 = +5v

	(the pinout is the same as external Amiga keyboard for 2000...)


optional, but better with:

	1: 40 pins socket for the 8051,
	1: 24 pins socket for the eprom,
	1: 20 pins socket for the latch.

    1: 101, 102, 104, 105 AT style keyboard !!

very very optionnal reset (for reseting the interface not the amiga !):

	BP1: push button
	C3: 10 µF capacitor
	R1: 10 K ohms resistor



Some strange key mapping:
=========================

Insert :   Help
Delete :   Delete

Left Ctrl  :   Left Amiga
Right Ctrl :   Right Amiga
Capslock   :   Control (IF used in conjunction with another key)

This release bring you the ability to use the 105 AT keyboard (win95).
So, if you tie low the pin number 7 (p1.6) of the 8051 (solder a wire between
the pin and GND), the mapping will be:

left windows  : left Amiga
right windows : right Amiga
windows menu  : left Amiga m    (cycle screen)
             (USA: tie low the pin 3 of the 8051, because different 'm')

right or left control : Control:


My mapping for the xtra pc's keyboard keys:

Home      Control + Up Cursor
End       Control + Down Cursor
PageUp    Shift + Up Cursor
PageDown  Shift + Down Cursor

F11           \                 (the missing key !!)
F12           right Amiga d     (don't ask me why !)
PrintScreen   right Amiga /     ( why ? )
ScrollLock    Left Amiga m      if not in 105 keys mode or Left Amiga o if so
             (USA: tie low the pin 3 of the 8051, because different 'm')


If you don't like this mapping you have two solutions:

 - change the source & reassemble it before making your eprom or
 - tie low the pin number 8 (p1.7) of the 8051 and the interface will send
rawkey codes for these xtra keys as follow:

 home        : 75
 end   :     : 76
 pageUp      : 77
 pageDown    : 78
 F11         : 79
 F12         : 7a
 printScreen : 7b
 scrollLock  : 7c

so you could use an external program to bother with these codes (a simple
test example can be found in the drawer "bonus"). If someone make a
commoditie or a good handler send it to me please (source code).


More and more
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

With this relaese the interface has the ability to perform a reset after
a programmable delay.
Why ? For those who, like me, have some hard drive spin up problem...
The port p3 (pin 17 to 10) is a 8 bit register that define the duration of
the delay.

Examples:

p3.0 is pin 10
...
P3.7 is pin 17

if you leave pin 10 to 17 unconnected nothing happens.
if you tie low the pin 16 the delay before a reset will be 64 * 70ms.
if you tie low pins 15 and 16 the delay will be (32+64) * 70 ms.
All the the pins of p3 at gnd and the delay will be 255 * 70ms that's
too much !
Personally, I only use pin 16 that's a good choice...for me.
