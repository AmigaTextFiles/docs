Introduction:
-------------

A few years ago, there was an article in _Amazing Computing for the
Commodore Amiga_ on using an IBM PC-compatible bus mouse with the
Amiga.  This interested me greatly, as I only had the standard Amiga
mouse (which wasn't very good).  However, I couldn't find a bus mouse
anywhere.

In Autumn 1992, I managed to find a copy of Acorn's BBC A3000 Welcome
Guide at school (*that*'s an odd thing: Acorn computers in a British
school ;-).  This thin booklet has the computer's pinouts in the back.
I was particularly struck that the Acorn machines have a 9-pin
mini-DIN mouse port (the same as a bus mouse port, according to the AC
article); I already knew they had three buttons.  Now I just had to
find an Acorn-compatible mouse.

On 16 October 1992, I went to the _Acorn User_ show at the Wembley
Exhibition Centre in London.  I found two stands selling Clares Micro
Mouses: Clares, selling them for £19.99, and someone else, selling
them for £19.95.  I asked a bloke at the latter whether they were
compatible with bus mouses; he told me that they were.

I compared the Welcome Guide pinouts with the AC article, and I saw
that they were not particularly similar.  This is when I decided to
go ahead and attempt to convert the mouse anyway.

Stuff You Need:
---------------

9-pin `D' female connector
multimeter or continuity tester (but see 4 below)
something to strip wires with (such as a pair of wire strippers)
something to cut a cable with
soldering iron and solder
9-pin `D' hood (note that you might need a low-profile hood if
    you plan to use the mouse with an Amiga 2000, 500, or perhaps
    certain other models)
screwdriver

How to do it:
-------------

1.  See how your mouse opens.  Mine has a screw underneath each of the
    bottom corners of a silver-coloured label:

              .----------------------------.
              |     CLARES MICRO MOUSE     |
              |                            |
              |    FOR THE ARCHIMEDES ®    |
              |                            |      `X' represents
              |     Serial No: 0000431     |          a screw
              |                            |
              |  A Naksha O.E.M. Product   |
              |                            |
              |X  Made in Taiwan R.O.C.   X|
              `----------------------------'

2.  Open your mouse.  For mine, this involved peeling back the label,
    removing two Philips-head screws, and separating the two halves of
    the mouse's case.

3.  If your mouse's plug is attached to its circuit board by wires
    terminating in a header plug, remove it from the board.  Mine
    did, so I did.

4.  Find out which colour wire is attached to which mini-DIN pin.  You
    can use a multimeter for this; if you don't have one, you can make
    a continuity tester:
                           __________
         .----------------|__________|-----------.
         |                                       |
         |                  resistor             |
       -----  cell                               _
        ===                                     / \  lamp
         |                                      \_/
         |                                       |
         |                                       |
   negative probe                          positive probe

    You probably ought to note the colours down; I have provided space
    on the pinouts chart above for this.

5.  Reassemble the mouse.

6.  Cut off the 9-pin mini-DIN plug a few centimetres from the mini-DIN
    plug end of the lead.

7.  Strip the wires from the mouse's cable.  I stripped about 7 mm
    of insulation; this was more than plenty.  If you're using a
    hood that doesn't separate around the cable entry, you probably
    ought to slip it over the cable now.

8.  With the help of the chart above, solder the wires to the
    appropriate pins of the `D' socket.  I swapped the right mouse
    button wire with the middle mouse button wire so I could carry on
    using my middle finger for menus.

9.  Once the solder has cooled, fit the hood.

10. Test your new mouse!

Conclusion:
-----------

I've been using my converted mouse for nearly three and a half years,
and I haven't had any problems yet (neither hardware nor software).
Your mileage might vary, and please remember that I take no
responsibility for anything that might happen in your life, including
(but not limited to) any possible damage to your computer system.

Enjoy!
