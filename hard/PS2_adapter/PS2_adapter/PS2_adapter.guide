@Node Introduction "Introduction"

Introduction
============

Back in 1990 when the Amiga 3000 was released, ZIP Rams were
widespread and commenly used.
Nowadays things have changed. Simms dominate the market, and ZIP
Rams are very expensive (if you can find some !). At this time
4MB SC ZIP Ram for the A3000 are sold for ~400 DM while you can get
an 8MB PS/2 Simm for only 250 DM. You get the idea ...

The second reason for this project was, that when you want to install
a 040/060 cpu-card, you must also use Simms on this card to get the
maximum speed out of it. If you already used them in conjunction with
our adapter there's no need to buy new Ram. Just remove them from the
adapter and put them on the cpu-card.

Some of you might now think of another reason for using our hack:
if you ever want to switch to a PC, you can still use the RAM you
bought a long time ago.
But we don't accept that as a valid reason to build our hardware, so
better forget about it fast ;-)

IMPORTANT:
==========

We are not responsible for any damage you may cause while trying to
rebuild or install this hack in your computer !

If you don't have much experience with projects like this, it
may be a good idea to let someone else build it for you, or to
@{" buy " link buy} a complete adapter directly from us.

@Node description "Description"

Description
===========

This hack only works in the model A3000 and maybe A3000T.
I couldn't test it in an A3000T because I don't have access to
one. If the adapter physically fits into the A3000T, it will work.

After you build the adapter, you'll have to plug it into the
empty ZIP sockets on the A3000 motherboard.

From now on you will be able to use standard PS/2 Simms ( with or w/o
parity ) in your A3000. Two Simm-sockets are available which can be 
used in one of the following ways:


Socket I      Socket II      Total Memory
-----------------------------------------

4MB Simm      Empty          4 MB
4MB Simm      4MB Simm       8 MB
4MB Simm      8MB Simm       12 MB
8MB Simm      Empty          8 MB
8MB Simm      8MB Simm       16 MB

* IMPORTANT: If you only use one Simm, you MUST plug it into Socket I *
*                                                                     *
*            If you use one 4MB and one 8MB Simm, you MUST plug the   *
*            4MB Simm into Socket I !                                 *
*                                                                     *
***********************************************************************


Use the five jumper blocks, see @{" top view " link "top.iff"} J1-J5, to configure your Ram:

@Node build "How to build it"

Building the adapter
====================


REQUIREMENTS:


- Two PS/2 Simm sockets (72 pin)
- A PCB
- 16 rows connectors with 10 pins each
- 5 jumper blocks
- 3 short pins
- some wire


o Use the PostScript file layout.ps to generate a PCB-layout of the adapter. 

o With the layout, you can now produce a PCB which connects the two Simm 
  sockets on top of it, to the ZIP sockets on the A3000 motherboard.

o Drill holes in the PCB. Do this either by hand, or use the file 
  'drl01.drl' to control a Gerber compatible drilling-machine, if you can 
  access one.

o Install the wire-bridges, see @{" top view " link "top.iff"} (red connections). 

o Next, solder the Simm sockets to the board, then the jumper blocks and
  finally the connectors to the ZIP sockets.

  ( Don't forget the three seperate connectors C1-C3 )

o All that's left to do now is to solder some connections by hand. They
  couldn't be included on the PCB because of space limitations.

@Node installation "Installation"

Installation
============

The easiest way to install the adapter in your A3000 is to remove the
motherboard completely, and put it on a hard surface.

Locate ZIP-Ram socket U850, and put socket #1 of your adapter on top
of it. The rest of the PCB sockets belong to the ZIP sockets as follows:


2 -> U851
3 -> U852
4 -> U853
5 -> U854
6 -> U855
7 -> U856
8 -> U857


If you turn your adapter slightly now, you should notice that at one
point it just 'falls' into place. This is the right position. Check it
anyway, because inserting the adapter into the wrong place can damage
your computer and/or your Simms.

When you are sure about the position, press the adapter down, to finally
install it in your machine.

Now you can install your Simm(s), put the short pin(s) in the right position
and test your new Ram.

@Node problems "Known problems"

Known problems
==============

- If you get a yellow screen right after startup, make sure that the 
  daughterboard is installed correctly.


- The message 'Error, can't get memory' can be caused by several
  problems. It could be an incorrect installed adapter, a defective
  Simm, or, most likely, a bad PCB or wrong/missing connection.


- If you notice a slight decrease in Ram speed after you installed
  the PS/2 Simms, it's likely that you used static column ZIP Rams
  before. PS/2 Ram works in page mode which is a little bit slower.
  
  This isn't really a problem, but it's worth mentioning.
