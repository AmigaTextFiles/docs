Spartan is a, build it yourself, SCSI interface for the Amiga 500
or Amiga 1000 which was featured recently in the AC TECH magazine, 
Vol.2, Num.1, 1992.   My only association with it is that I built 
one and am very happy with it.    


Included in the article was a disk containing a low level formater, 
device driver, sample mountlists, and other info.  All those files are 
included in the archive.  


In addition, I have included two other files which are replacements for 
the low level format and test programs.  Those original programs would 
not work correctly on my system.  My versions are slightly modified in 
that a delay is inserted immediatley after the scsi SEL signal is 
de-asserted.  Those new files are in the directory named NewSformat.

 
The design is not auto config or auto boot.  It is known to work with
Seagate, Quantum, Maxtor, Adaptec, Sysquest, and probably most others 
(These are the ones I've been told do work).  I had trouble with a 
90 meg Fujitsu drive that is firmware configured for Macintosh.  Someone 
else apparently had trouble with a Rodyne drive. (My Maxtor works
fine)

I ordered the bd and 5380 chip from the designer and bought the rest of
the parts through digi-key.  Total cost was just under $50.


Here is the parts list:

	qty	description					Digi-Key #

	1	74ls00 quad nad gate				DM74LS00
	1	74HC688 eight bit comparitor			MM74HC688N
			(74ls688 is acceptable)
	3	.047 ufd ceramic capacitors			P4521
	1	22ufd tantalum capacitor			P2015
	3	8 pin 220/330 ohm terminator pack		Q1T04
	1	10 pin 1K ohm pull-up pack			Q9102
	1	8 position dip switch				CT2088
	1	50 pin scsi connector				AHR50G-ND 
	1	86 pin edge card connector
	1	50 wire ribbon cable with connectors		A3AAT-5018G-ND
			 				(or A3AAT-5036G-ND)

The text of the article is not in the uploaded files.  I would suggest
asking Paul Harker to email you the ascii portion or get the magazine
if you can.  Failing that, I will mail a photocopy if you send a self
addressed stamped envelope to me.


There are reported problems with copying large files across partitions on 
some IBM type drives using an Adaptek adapter.  When this happens, the
drive has to be reformatted.  I would suggest using only one partition
with these drives.
