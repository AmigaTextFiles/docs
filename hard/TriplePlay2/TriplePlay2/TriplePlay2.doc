A MIDI-Interface Projekt by Alfred Faust

*******************************************************************************

DISCLAIMER

FIRST OF ALL:

I AND THE ORIGINAL AUTORS ARE NOT HELD LIABLE IF  THERE  ARE  ANY
DAMAGES OR HARD ERRORS WHEN YOU MAKE AND USE THIS TRIPLE-PLAY.

MAKING MONEY WITH THIS PROJEKT IS NOT ALLOWED.

IT IS ADAPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL "TRIPLE-PLAY MIDI-INTERFACE" FROM
"BLUE RIBBON INC." AND FROM A PCB BY RYAN OSMAN.

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

THAT MUST BE ... I'M A POOR MAN ... ;(

This projekt is freeware. That means you can use it without to pay anything. But
I will be very enjoyed, if you send me a mail, when you use it.

It comes with NO warranties.

********************************************************************************

That's a rework of my TriplePlay-Projekt, that was only a rework of the  PCB  of
Ryan Osmans PCB.

As I have tested the original Triple-Play from Ryan Osman with my  MIDI-Hardware
(DX11), it won't work correct. But this was only at the "IN" and the "THRU". The
three "OUT"-channels of this Interface are worked  fine.  So  I've  altered  the
MIDI-IN  and  THRU. Now it works correct. I hope this little alteration can help
other people, with similar problems.

At the first I will also say you a fact, before you try this all. Have you  ever
used  Bars&Pipes  with  16  channels  and  many  notes  ? If your AMIGA have had
problems  with  this,  it  is  not  probable,  that  it  can  handle  the   full
possibilities of 3x16 channels.

I think a 68040 processor with 40 Mhz is the  minimum  of  the  work  with  this
TriplePlay - MIDI - Interface.

But try it. Bars&Pipes have so much possibilities ...

  What components you need:
  -------------------------

    Logical IC:

      The label of  the  logical  IC's  are  some  different  by  the  different
      companys. But at all: there is a international standard. The last 4 numers
      in the label are the same everywhere.

      For example:

      The IC "4052" we need : MOTOROLA  MC14052B
                              PHILIPS   HEF4052B
                              TOSHIBA      4052B

      You can see: the last 4 numbers are the same.

      Don't use the 74... types (example 74HC4052). This IC's are for only +5  V
      power and they will be destroyed by our +12 V .


      We need: 1x  4052 (4 channel Multiplexer/Demultiplexer)
               1x  4069 (6 gates - (Hex) Inverter)

    Optocoupler:
               1x CNY 17 or similar

    Si-Diode:  2x 1N4148 or similar

    Resistors: 1x 220  Ohm
               4x  10 KOhm

    Capacitors are not needed.

    5 DIN-sockets for the MIDI-connections.

    1 SUB-D female plug 25 pin

    short piece 9 wire-cable (shielded)

    What kind of connectors at the PCB you are use, is your choice.

    A small METAL case (100x70X30);
            -----
    !!!It is very important for shielding radiation!!!


  Making the PCB
  --------------

    For making the PCB you need:

        - transparentpaper (for the exposuremask)
        - a piece of 6 x 10 cm fotopositv PCB-material

        - a UV-lamp (a normal flourescent lamp does the same)

        - developer for the exposured PCB: NaOH
        - corrosive for the developed PCB: FeCl3 or other


   First:

    Print out the exposure-mask to the transparent paper. It is possible with  a
    normal computerprinter in black/white. Use maximal contrast. The best result
    you get with a laser-printer.

    If you use a inkjet-printer, it is possible, that the  black  color  is  not
    real black. It may be, that than there are some difficulties. You can also
    make a fotocopy with maximum contrast. The result is like a printout with a
    laser-printer.

    The #?.ps - files you can print out using "ghostscript" or  "post",  if  you
    have no postscript-printer. Then all will be printed in the right messures.

    The #?.iff - files  you  can  print  out  with  any  graphic  print  program
    ("graphic-publisher"  of  "Turboptint", or "Studio" or other). A DTP-Program
    is also a good coice. In this way you must a little  experiment  up  to  the
    measure-lines matchs the lenght that shown.

    The dimensions of the #?.iff-picture are 21 X 8 cm.

    I've made the PCB with ProDraw3. If you have this program you can  load  the
    ProDraw-file . Then is the printing easier.

    If you can't make PCB's by yourself, I can help you. But I'm not a
    electronic concern ... ;-)

   Second:

    Prepare the developer and the corrosivebath.

    !!!! CAUTION !!!

    The developer and the corrosive are very corrodive.

    !!!! USE GLOVES !!!


    NaOH :  50g to 1l water
    FeCl³: 400g to 1l water

    Lay the printed mask down  the  PCB-material.  (remove  the  protectionsfoil
    before).  Use  the mirrored one with the printcoulor to the PCB. That means,
    that it is now unmirrored. Press it down with a glasplate. Than lay it under
    the UV-lamp.

          exposure time with UV-lamp : 3 min
          exposure time with flourecent-lamp : 7-8 min
          (a small distance between lamp and PCB is necessary)

    After the exposure put the PCB immediately in the developer. In a short time
    you  will now see appearing the line wires. When all spaces between the line
    wires are free, take the PCB out of the developer and bring it under  water.
    Then let it dry accurate. Don't use a cloth, it wipes the line wires.

********************************************************************************

    NB.: I tryed to make the mask with a  inkjet-printer.  The  ink  isn't  real
         black. So the UV-light wasn't exact shielded at the black lines. So the
         developer also destroyed the lines and the PCB was lost.

         So I experimented a little. My result:

         Make a low concentrated developerbath : 20g NaOH to 1l water
         Exposure a short time: UV-lamp only 40 seconds !!!
                                flourecent-lamp only 90 seconds !!!

         Hold the exposured PCB only so long in the developer  bath  up  to  all
         lines are clearly to see, then immediately put it under flowing water.

         You can put the PCB again in the developer if it is not OK,  and  again
         under the water.

         Be careful ! In the other way you will lose your work.

         But this is only for that reason if you use a inkjet-printer.

********************************************************************************

    If the PCB is dry, put it in the  corrosivebath  .  The  time  it  takes  to
    cauterize  is  between  10  min and some hours. Look often at the PCB in the
    corrosivebath. If you heat up the corrosivebath to 60°C  the  cauterize-time
    will be very short. Often move your PCB in the bath, that will also minimize
    the time.

    If all line wires clean cauterized, put the PCB under water to wash  up  all
    corrodive.

   Third:

    Drilling:

    - use a drill 1 mm

   Forth:

    Soldering:

    On the PCB you can see how all components shall be connected. Also you  will
    see the connections to the PCB. (MIDI-Output, and serial connection)

    Use a electric soldering iron with no more than 20 W.

    Look accurate before soldering the IC.

    Use only  so  much  solder  tin  as  necessary.  Use  only  solder  tin  for
    electronics.

    There are two small jumpers to sold in. At the PCB these are marked with
    "JP". Don't forget these!


                   For the MIDI-Ports use normal DIN-sockets:

                     View from the back (soldering) - side:

                               ---------------
                               |             |
                               |      2      |
                               |   5     4   |

                               |      S      |
                               |             |
                               ---------------

              S = Shield of the Plug (must be connected to Pin 2)

                                  ATTENTION !

      THERE ARE DIFFERENT ORDER OF THE PINS AT THE PCB FOR THE MIDI-PORTS

                           MIDI-IN      :   5 2 4
                           THRU         :   4 2 5
                           MIDI-OUT 1-3 :   4 2 5


    Most there are numbers of the pins at the DIN-sockets. Look accurate please.

    For the connection to out use soldering pins, or sold in a PCB-plug.

    The numbers of the pin-connections of the serial-port-plug you  see  at  the
    top of the PCB.


                          1+7  2  3  4  9  10  20


    CONNECT ONLY THIS PINS. SEE, THAT PIN 1 + PIN 7 AT THE SERIAL-PORT-PLUG  ARE
    CONNECTED !

    LOOK VERY ACCURATE AND COUNT THE PINS FOR SECURITY THREE TIMES ORE MORE.

    MOST FOR PIN 9 and 10. THE REASON IS: PIN 9 HAVE +12V PIN 10 HAVE -12V !

    IT WILL BE VERY DANGEROS IF YOU EXCHANGE THESE TWO PINS. THE  IC's  WILL  BE
    DAMAGED.


    At last build the PCB and  the  DIN-sockets  in  the  metal  case.  For  the
    connection  to  the serial-port I made a short cable with the female plug at
    the one side.


                 Before you connect or disconnet to your AMIGA:

          !!!!!   S W I T C H     O F    T H E     P O W E R    !!!!!

          IT IS VERY EASY TO DESTROY THE PORT IC's, WHEN YOU MAKE ANY
         CONNECTION OR DISCONNECTION AT YOUR AMIGA, IF THE POWER IS ON.

    The time you loose with a new boot is very good invested in the life of your
                                     AMIGA.

                                 BE WARNED ....


    And now good luck and many fun with the Triple-Play-MIDI-Interface ....  :))

    ############################################################################

    The "Driver Tools"  I've  also  put  in  this  package.  They  replaces  the
    MIDI-OUT.ptool.
    Before you can use the TriplePlay.ptools you must remove the  MIDI-Out.ptool
    in the Toolbox (in the menu of the Toolbox "Remove Tool").
    After  that  "Install  Tool..."  -  the three TriplePlay.ptools. Use them as
    MIDI-Out-Tools.

    Each of them can handle 16 Channels.

    That means: Each MIDI-OUT-Port has 16 MIDI-Channels. 3x16 = 48

    So you have now real up to 48 MIDI-Channels.

    All other functions the same like in the MIDI-Out-Tool.
