A1200 Clock Port Info

Version 1.2    4th December  2000

Introduction

On the A1200, there is an area of the motherboard that may have between 20 
& 80 pins on it. This is the ubiquitous 'Clock Port.' It is a popular 
interface for add on I/O card as it connects directly to the A1200's DRAM 
data bus. 

Why is it so Called?

According to my sources, Commodore were unsure whether they should add a 
Clock to the A 1200 and how much memory to fit as standard, 1 or 2 MByte.
To allow for easily changing their minds, they built an interface 
straight onto the A1200's DRAM bus and provided it with the appropriate 
interface lines. Commodore decided to add a full 2 mbyte of RAM and leave 
the real time clock off the A1200. 

How many pins are there?
Most Amiga's do not have the full 80 pins, just a space on the motheroard 
for them. The full 80 pins were apparently fitted to early A1200 models 
but removed from subsequent models. In theory it should be possible to 
add on the missing pins and make full use of this bus interface. I am 
told that these pins are 2mm pitch, the same as those used on the 2.5" 
internal IDE port. 

How do I interface to this port?
You will need to know about microprocessor interfacing to do this.
Insert info here later.
block diagram of Read/Write lines, chip selects and wait state info?

How do I access the Clock port?

Use the following addresses from the A1200 memory map

D80000 to D8FFFF  64 KB SPARE chip select  
    (The area of memory where the clock port resides)
D90000 to D9FFFF  64 KB ARCNET chip select
DC0000 to DCFFFF  64 KB Real Time Clock(RTC)

A note on chip selects and wait states

As this is a CPU bus interface
SPARE_CS 64K, 3 wait read/4 write, _IORD/_IOWR/_WAIT

Nominally an Z8530 or 1NS8250 derivative UART. Note that while slow timing 
is provided there is no hardware support for the PCLK "holdoff" required 
by the Z8530 chips, this must be insured by software and/or using one of 
the derivative chips which minimize this requirement.
_RTC_CS 64K, 3 wait read/4 write, _IORD/_IOWR/_WAIT

Nominally a OKI M5M6242 or Ricoh RF5C01 Real-Time clock chip.  Note that 
there is provision for this chip both on board and on a "A501 style" 
chip memory expansion header.

_NET_CS64K, 0 wait read/1 write, _IORD/_IOWR/_WAIT
 Nominally a network interface chip such as the SMC C0M2020 Arcnet controller
 chip or one of the various  "single chip" Ethernet controller chips.

Addendum the CS8900 ISA ethernet IC should have a near Glueless interface to
 this port. a full design should be easy to draw up. Hopefully available on Aminet soon

Clock Header Pinout information
Two 40 Pin DIL headers have been provided on the A1200 for a Memory/RTC expander. 
This is the pinout for the complete "clock" header - the space for which is visible above and below the Chip Mem IC's.  Note that only the P9B pins 19-40 actually have a header soldered in in most machines, although some earlier revisions (such as 1B) had a complete P9B, and the earliest of prototypes had both P9A and P9B complete, probably in conjunction with 1mb Chip RAM.
