Signal Descriptions for the Amiga A1200 'Clock Port'

Other notes


Because the A1200 implements only a 16 M-byte address space and the software currently 
implements only the Zorro-Il auto-configuration protocol, memory expansion devices are limited 
to the 4/8 M-bytes allocated to "Zorro Space" memory expansion in the address map. There are 
4-Mbytes available if a PCMCIA card is inserted, 8M-bytes if no card is inserted or the interface 
is disabled by software.

Memory/expansion device design is similar to that of Zorro bus peripherals, with the exception 
that the devices should run off the 14MHz processor clock and most memory devices will use 
the _OVR signal to disable the default Gayle cycle termination and aasert their own _DSACK for 
32-bit termination.

All devices should implement the Zorro-Il auto-configuration protocol, since this provides for 
automatic address assignment and device driver linkage.  There is a pin on the expansion 
connector that is defined to be the start of the auto-config chain, currently this is just a ground, 
but future systems are may put some auto-config resources on the main board and implement 
this as an output.

There are some fixed decodes implemented for specific devices, (UART, network and RTC) 
however these should be avoided except for the most trivial devices since system software may 
assume the presence of specific (but currently undefined) devices at those decodes.

	Various address ranges are decoded and generate "Intel/PC" style memory 
read/write (_OE/_WE) and I/O read/write (_IORD/_IOWR) strobe signals, insert 
default wait-states for peripheral timing and obey the _WAIT signal to add additional 
wait states.

Note the above is from the A1200 system spec, the _WAIT signal is not present on the 
clock port header.

Unless stated overwise, all signals are TTL compatible and have the following characteristics

Logic 0		<=0.8V for an input, <= 0.4V for an output, 3.2 mA drive.
Logic 1		>=2.0V for an input, >= 2.4V for an output, 400 microamp (uA) drive.  

DRD0-DRD31

32 bit DRAM Data bus.

Budgie provides these signals. 
Essentially the 68020 Data bus buffered/relayed via Budgie.
Budgie segregates the 68020 from the Chip Ram. The 68020 access chip
RAM and the custom chips over this bus, via Budgie.
 
This bus can not be used for Add on peripherals, it is only for the onboard
chip ram.


_RTC_CS 

Chip select for the real time clock that was never fitted.
It decodes/selects a 64K memory space from $DC0000 to DCFFFF.
There are 3 Wait states on a read and 4 on a write to ports using 
this address strobe.
Active low.

_IORD

An Intel/PC style I/O Read signal.
Active low.
Used for Read strobes on a device connected to the clock port.
The IORD signal is also used by the IDE interface.

Signal sourced from Gayle. 

_IOWR

An Intel/PC style I/O Write signal.
Active low.
Used for write strobes to devices connected to the clock port.
Also used by the IDE interface.

Signal sourced from Gayle. 

_RESET & PWR_BAD

The RESET line appears to come from the RESET line by the keyboard micro?

PWR_BAD is a power up reset signal, as far as I can tell.

The KB_RESET signal is used to Warm Reboot the Amiga and this signal comes from the 
keyboard array by using the 3 finger salute!

_INT6

A level 6 interrupt which goes to Paula. Paula feeds this to the 68020's IPL 
(Interrupt Priority Level) lines. Can be used by add on peripherals

_RTC_CS

One of 2 chip selects available on the clock port.

Was originally intended for the optional clock!

It is active low for any address access in the range of $DC0000 to $DCFFFF

_SPARE_CS

The second of the chip selects.

It is active low for any address access in the range of $D80000 to $D8FFFF

D23-D16

8 bits of the 68020 Data bus.

These are the only data bus lines available for add on peripherals.

These lines connect directly to the 68020 so bear in mind their limited drive 
capability, 400 uA for a logic 1, and 3.2 mA for a logic 0.

Timing in relation to IORD and IOWR is detailed later.

A5-A2

4 bits of the 68020 Address bus.

DC drive capabilities as above for the Data bus.

Timing info to be added later.

VCC

A +5V supply pin.

No idea of current limits, depends on PCB tracking. 
Limit to 200 mA to play safe.

GND

2 0VL (0V logic) pins.
