Hello.

This hack will allow you to use standard 1.44 PC floppy as 880kb amiga one.

It only requiere to modify the floppy data cable.

As most PC drive are configured as unit 1 i have inclued doc for unit0 and unit1,
you should look at the rear of the drive there should be a switch to configure the unit.

Even, in this archive, there is only picture for unit1 hack.

THANKS to SIL^PPC that made me the scans !!

So there is:
------------

Get your floppy cable and remove the connector that go on the floppy drive.
Notice that the red wire is pin 1.

For UNIT1 configured drive you need to :
----------------------------------------
1- swap 2 and 34
2- move wires 10,11,12 to 12,13,14 respectivly
3- move 13 to 11 and 14 to 10
