This material was submitted to me on disk directly by one of the authors,
Michael Cianflone, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Michael!

I added the various icons, and set them up to use the "LoadImage" IFF
viewer, the only one I could find that allowed you to easily scroll around
in the large images relatively quickly and easily.  Just hold down the left
mouse button and run the cursor up against the side of the screen that you
want to scroll into.
