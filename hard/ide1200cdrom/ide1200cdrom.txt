opening your A1200 do not attempt this project. (see DISCLAIMER below)



Introduction
====================

Having just saved tonnes of money by adding an IDE CDROM to my A1200, as opposed
to a SCSI CDROM, I thought I'd produce this document to help others do the same.
From what I have read in the newsgroups a number of people have managed to add
an IDE CDROM to their A1200, and a number of people keep asking if it can be
done. Well it can!

Having a CDROM has become as standard as having a floppy drive (or harddrive) in
the PC and Mac marketplace with 650Mb of information at your fingertips. The
ability to access this has been difficult even for "Big box" Amiga users because
the Amiga's IDE interface lacks buffering. Well, this is the reason I have heard
from everyone who has told me that it is impossible to attach an IDE CDROM to an
A1200. To get around this there are a number of software patches that provide a
software fix for this problem.

The only problem remaining is where to put such a large device as a CDROM if you
own an A1200? Well from what I can see you have two options. One - have the
CDROM sit next to your A1200 with the IDE and power cables coming out of the
side of the case, either by not screwing down the case on that side (which I am
currently living with) or cutting some "ports" in the side of your case (joy).
Two - buy a case, either try to get it into a PC case based on the information
that can be found on Aminet and some WWW sites, or get a custom A1200 case like
Ramiga or Micronik's Infinitiv. Of course you may already have your 1200 in a 
case in which case you one up on me.



Requirements
========================

This method requires that you have a 3.5" harddrive already installed. I don't
know if it will work without a harddrive but I wouldn't recommend it. As for 2.5"
drives, if you can find a way to add a 40 pin connector to your IDE chain -let
me know!

Of course since you have a 3.5" harddrive you have a large power requirement.
If you also have an accelerator you are really living on the edge, so if you
are planning to add a CDROM you will more than likely need a larger power supply.
I have a Goliath that provides 200W for my system and is more than adequate.
Micronik sell PC power supplies that provide power to you system as well
as external devices. If you get one of these you will not need the power splitter
cable.

23/6/96:

	I have heard someone has got an A500's supply to work, so it
may be worth a try.

  You will require:

Hardware:
---------

 - 1 IDE ATAPI/EIDE CDROM (the faster the better)

 NOTE: The drive MUST be ATAPI/EIDE compliant. All drives that are quad speed
 or above should comply to this standard but if you are looking to get a cheap
 double speed ensure it complies to this standard. See the CDROM FAQ for more
 details (see "Documentation" below).

 - 1 40 pin IDE Cable able to connect two IDE devices (Maplins order code: DG40T)


 This is long to allow enough cable to reach outside the case.

Software:
---------

(All software mentioned is available from Aminet Archives throughout
the world)

idefix.lha         disk/misc  247K  Newest Demo (104.1) of the IDE-fix packa
        - full version available at 49.95 UKP
        from PDsoft and Intrinsic Computer Systems (see "Commercial Suppliers" below)


Atapi_PnP212.lha   disk/cdrom 130K  V 2.12 Atapi cd.device for A4000,A1200,A
        - registered version costs 40 DM, I think :-)

  These include the latest devices to handle an IDE CDROM, but I have to date
only tried idefix.lha as Atapi_PnP212.lha is only in German and Italian.


I have also heard that ASIM CDFS 3.0 has the appropriate device driver.
Price: 49.99 UKP

REMEMBER: register you're software and support the Amiga Community.

Installation
====================

1. TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER. Remove all cables and drives. This makes it easier
and safer to open.

2. Open you're A1200 by turning it over and unscrewing the three screws at the
front of the case and the two at the sides of the base.
(WARNING: opening you're A1200 will void any Warranty on it).

3. Carefully open the top of the case, taking care of the cables that go to
the LED's. You can disconnect the cables from the motherboard or the LED's
from the case quite easily.

4. Carefully remove the IDE and power cable from the harddrive. Depending
on what 44-40 pin connector you have you may have to hack around with it
to connect the new IDE cable. Connect the male connector of the power 
splitter cable to the power cable that was connected to the harddrive.

5. Reconnect the harddrive to one of the power connectors and the first
connector on the IDE cable. This should allow enough cable to extend outside
the case. Ensure the harddrive is set up as a MASTER device. Some drives may
not need the jumper settings changed as they are set up for acting as a
stand-alone/master with one setting. Others may require changing the jumpers.
The jumper settings for your harddive can be found on the packaging or
manual of the harddrive. If you don't have these most, if not all, harddrive
manufacturers now have Web sites which include the settings of their drives. 
If this still fails, try the dealer you bought it from.

6. Close your case carefully leaving the side that the cables exit slightly
open, or cut some holes in the case. Make sure the cables are not crushed by
the case.

7. Connect essential cables and devices - power, mouse, moitor/tv. Turn on your
machine to make sure everything is still running before you add the CDROM drive.

8. TURN OFF THE COMPUTER. Connect the CDROM to the cables, making sure the IDE
cable is connected properly (this is important as an incorrectly connected IDE
device can damage your machine). Ensure the CDROM is set up as a SLAVE device. 
The jumper settings for this should be in the manual for the drive or on the 
packaging.

9. Turn on the computer and install whatever software you are going to use.

10. You should, hopefully, now have a fully functional CDROM drive.



System
=====================

The CDROM was installed and tested on the following system:

Amiga 1200
1220/4Mb
Conner 3.5" 425Mb Harddrive
External Floppy
Goliath 200W Power Supply


The CDROM is a BCD Six Speed IDE CD-ROM with ATAPI-IDE Interface:

Seek Time           1/3 stroke := 180 ms

Power saving        Enabled within 3 - 6 minutes

Power               5V DC
                    12V DC



Speed Comparison
=====================

The following information was given by Sysinfo.

Conner 425A 3.5" HD  - 1.6 Mb/s  (after adding CDROM, 1.8 Mb/s before)
Six Speed CDROM      - 0.8 Mb/s
Floppy Drive         - 0.022 Mb/s (just to let you know)


Price comparisons (UK - June 1996)

Double Speed SCSI CDROM (including SCSI Squirrel) - 179 UKP
Quad Speed SCSI CDROM   (including SCSI Squirrel) - 249 UKP

DIY SCSI system
SCSI Squirrel                                     -  60 UKP
Quad Speed SCSI CDROM                             -  35 UKP
SCSI enclosure                                    -  69 UKP
Software                                          -  ?? UKP
                                            Total = 164 UKP

SO... you can see the monetary reason to go for an IDE CDROM :)

Insane Ramblings
====================

Hopefully you have now got a functional CDROM drive which can now open your eyes
to the great world of CDROMs. I only have one CD so far (Amiga Format CD1) but
I'm hooked. There are quite a few places that sell CD's for the amiga, and there
is such a wide range: AGA experience, Arcade Classics, C64 games CD, plus the
Aminet set - Aminet 11 has just come out with complete Xi-Paint 3.2 package. So
get out there and be mind boggled........

23/6/96

I have a second CD - yay!



Disclaimer
=========================

I do not take responsibilty for any damage caused to your machine or CDROM drive
by following these instructions. Computers should only be opened and tinkered
with by qualified technicians and hackers who have a good idea of what there
doing. If you open your own machine you take its well-being in your own hands.
You have been warned!!

 without whom I would never had had the courage to try this out.

 committing myself to buying my own drive.

Amiga Format
 - for giving me a reason to get a CDROM drive (so I could look at
 AFCD1 - Amiga Formats first CD cover disk). Here's hoping it
 encourages more people to get a CDROM and in turn gets the games
 industry in on the market.
