@node Introduction "Introduction"
	In december 1994 I bought a CD³² (the last in stock).  But I didn't
want  it  just to play games.  In fact, I just wanted an AGA machine with a
CD-ROM  and  I  found that a CD³² + SX-1 is cheaper than an A1200 + CD-ROM.
After  that,  I  purchassed  a  SX-1 in England.  Well, my machine was very
powerful  but  there was a problem.  The PSU is just too weak.  Putting two
disk drives did just break it.
	Now  I  would say to Commodore (even if now you're doing PC's) that
the  PSU who came with the CD³² is a muthaf#?cking PSU.  It is too weak and
that's  not  all.   It  hasn't  got a fuse, it's impossible to open and the
cables  are  not  coloured  logically.   An  it's  very weight!!!  So Amiga
Technologies please, change this PSU.  Use the old good A500 PSU.
	Well.   My  PSU was broken.  So I decided to build another one (but
with  much  more power).  I searched trought Internet a documentation about
the plug of the CD³² but...  nothing!!
	Fortunately,  a  friend  called BAP did send me his CD³² PSU.  So I
tested  it  and  finally  my  CD³²  is  working with a PC PSU (and it works
well!!).   If you're a owner of a CD-32 and a SX-1, I think it's better you
make a more powerful PSU to avoid problems.

	Let's go!!!!!

@node material "What you need"
For doing this project, you need:

		- Some screwdrivers

		- A PC-style PSU

		- The original CD³²'s PSU

		- A soldering-iron

		- Something to cut the cables

		- A multimeter (optional)

		- A insulate ribbon

		- And a clean desk

	That's all!!!

@node build "Building the Power Supply Unit"
	Before  starting, remember that you'll need to cut the cable of the
CD³²'s PSU.  Doing that will invalidate the warranty, so make your choice.

	Well,  you  need  a  PC PSU.  They are powerful, reliable and don't
overheat because they are fan cooled (it will make a bit of noise, but...).
You can take a PC, open it, take his PSU and get rid of it.  The PSU is the
only  good think the PCs have.  Look at the PSU.  There is a lot of cables.
You  need  only 3 cables.  The +5V, the +12V and the GND.  In the PC-XT the
+5V is the red cable, the +12V the yellow and the GND the black cable.

Remove  the  PSU  of  the PC.  You only need to remove some screws.  If you
don't have any PSU, you can buy one.  They're not too expensive.

After  that,  look  at the PSU's connectors.  There are 2 or more 5¼ drives
connectors.   Take  one  and  cut  the four cables 2 centimeters behind the
plug.

Now,  strip  one  centimeter  of  each  cables  and solder the 2 GND cables
together (the black ones).

Take  the  CD³²'s PSU and open it with a good screwdriver(you need to break
the plastic sheet under the box).  Cut the 4 cables (red, yellow, black and
brown)  and remove the PSU to CD³² cable.  Solder the red and yellow cables
together.

It's  time  to join the PC-PSU to the CD³².  Solder each PSU cable with the
good cable of the CD³² plug.  Refere to the diagram below:

	PC-PSU			CD³² CABLE		VOLTAGE
	------			----------		-------
	black	==============	black			GND
	red	==============	yellow and red		+5V
	yellow	==============	brown			+12V


Insulate  all  the  cables  with  rubber.   It's  very  important  to avoid
short-circuits.

If  you've  got a multimeter, control the voltage (be careful, it's easy to
touch more than one pin on the CD³²'s cable plug).

Insulate the others PC-PSU's cables.

Double check all.  If you made a mistake, you can damage the CD³².

That's  it.   Plug  the PSU, turn it on and turn the CD³² on.  It will work
fine now.  If not, you made a mistake and your CD³² is certainly broken.


Now  you  can  add as much drives, harddisks and boards you like.  A PC PSU
can  cope with all.  For example, here is a comparison between the original
CD³²'s PSU and my PC-PSU.

	CD³²'s PSU				PC-PSU
	----------				------
	+12V = 0.5A				+12V = 5.5A
	+5V  = 2.2A				+5V  = 15A


If you want, you can also plug your monitor in the PSU's AC OUTLET.

A scheme is supplied in the archive if you need more informations.

@Node address "David Gerber"
	 If  you  like  this  hardware  hack,  send  me an e-mail with your
comments  and  ideas for a future version.  You can also send me postcards,
programs,  money  (doing that, you will get the future programs on a disk),
CD's,  girls  (90-60-90),  etc...   If you have a bug report or if you want
more programs or MODs, contact me.

There are some programs I developped:

	- ZapDisk (the best disk eraser) (aminet   disk/misc)

	- CodeFile (file encoder, easy to use)

	- CloseWorkBench (a very simple program who give you 40 kb more
	  CHIP RAM. I've done it for ProTracker).
	  
	- Very goods HARDCORE songs (Protracker)

	- And much more...

@Node cv "David Gerber's life"
	I'm  born in Switzerland the 6 of april 1978.  I studied at college
but  I  decided  to  change  and  now  I'm  studing engineering.  I started
computing  with  an  old  MSX-2 (it was a good machine).  It learned me the
BASIC.   After that, I bought an Amiga 500 and I found it was an incredible
computer.   I  bought another Amiga 500, and now, I've got a brand new CD³²
with a SX-1.  I hate PC's (Amiga is 10 years beyond PC's).
	I like swimming, diving, listening HARDCORE (with full volume), the
COCA-COLA, the girls with blond hair and of course the Amiga.
	If you want to know me more, e-mail me.


	Note: if you want to contact me and you're not very good speaking
	      english (like me) you can also write in french or spanish.

@Node greets "Greetings"
Greetings to:

	- DJ Lang for improving my sound system

	- Juan for giving me an Amiga. What are you doing
	  with your fucking PC? It's only a 486? You need to buy a P7 and
	  Windoze 96 plus ten add-on and a hundred of bugs!

	- BAP. Thank you for the CD³²'s PSU.
	  Tu m'as sauvé la vie!!! C'est Germond qui a conçu la PSU CD³²!!

	- Axl for his Action Replay MKIII (a very good cartridge)

	- Coca-Cola

	- ID&T

	- Motorola

	- Commodore (Thank you for supporting the Amiga. It's sade that
	  you have to produce fucking PC's now)

	- Escom for supporting the Amiga. All the Amiga community is
	  with you.


Fuck's to:

	- Bill Gates for producing the stupide Windoze.

	- Intel for stupide CPU's with poor efficiency.

	- THI for beeing stupid.

	- Stupid people how think that Mhz is all.
