    GamePort MIDI Interface
    -----------------------
    a FREWWARE hardware project

    DISCLAIMER (it must be, I'm a poor man ...):

    THIS PROJECT COMES AS FREEWARE. YOU MAY USE IT AND/OR  MODIFY  IT  LIKE
    YOU  WANT.  KEEP  THE  COPYRIGHTS  UNCHANGED  (OR  ADD YOUR OWN IF HAVE
    SOMEWHAT CHANGED).

    I HAVE MADE THIS MIDI INTERFACE 10 TIMES WITH SUCCESS. THE COSTS OF THE
    PARTS ARE VERY MODERATE.

    AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE IT FOR PROFIT, YOU HAVE NOT TO  PAY  FOR  THIS
    MATERIAL. OTHERWISE CONTACT ME.

    I CAN'T GIVE ANY WARRANTY, USE THIS MATERIAL AT YOUR OWN RISK.

    I HELD NOT LIABLE FOR ANY POSSIBLE DAMAGE ON YOUR HARDWARE.  DON'T  SUE
    ME.

    1. Preface:

    Building  such  a  hardware  presumes  any  experience   in   self-made
    electronics,  especially  in  "How  to make a PCB?". If you need such a
    MIDI-Interface, you can also contact me, in the case you can't make  it
    by yourself.

    This Gameport  MIDI  Interface  should  work  on  every  computer  with
    MIDI-transmission over the standard Gameport (MPU401).

    normal pinlayout of a standard Gameport:

    15-pin female connector

    Pin Assignment
    ----------------------
    8   +5V
    5   Ground
    12  MIDI-send (OUT)
    15  MIDI-receive (IN)



    I've made this interface primarily  for  my  PEGASOS  with  a  CREATIVE
    Soundblaster LIVE! soundcard.

    It is working on the internal  gameport  of  the  PEGASOS  and  on  the
    gameport of the soundcard.

    I also have tested it with success on my Win-PC.

    ATTENTION !
    -----------
    Don't try this Interface to use on a serial port of normal AMIGA.
    IT DOESN'T WORK !
    For AMIGA other MIDI-Interfaces are neccessary.


    2. Short description:

    First, buy the parts:
    --------------------

      resistors, all 1/4W:

        9x220 Ohm
        1x470 Ohm
        1x10 kOhm

      capacitor:

        1x 10µF/16V (its very uncritical 10-100µF)

      diode:

        1N914 or 1N4148 or similar universal type (uncritical)

      IC's:

        1x6N138 or 6N139  (optocoupler)
        1x4049 (CMOS - 6 HEX inverters)

      5x 5pin DIN-print-sockets

      cable:
		4x - shielded
        circa 1 meter (or more, if you want, up to 25 meters ... ;-D)

      plug:

        SUB-D 15-pin male (plug NOT socket - with case)

      A metal case, which is big enough for the PCB

    Second, make the PCB:
    ---------------------

      To print out the Mask (PCB.gif) pay attention, that the pic  is  made
      for a printout at 600x600 dpi. You MUST set the resolution of the pic
      in your image-processing-program also to 600x600 dpi before  you  try
      to make a printout. (normaly the screen has 72 or 96 dpi)

      Than the printed PCB-Mask should appear in the correct size:
      100x50 mm.

      I presumed that you are familiary with making PCB's.

      Drill the holes, and take your soldering iron ... ;-))

	
	Prepare your case
	-----------------
	
	It's up to you, to fix the PCB in the case.
	
    Prepare the SUB-D plug with the cable:
    --------------------------------------

      Here I only have to say: be accurate, don't use the false  pins,  and
	  connect ONLY the needed pins. 

      The shield of the cable, only connect to  the  outer  shield  of  the
      plug.  The  other  side  MUST  be unconnected. Otherwise you get some
      unwanted noise form the MIDI-Interface to the computer. (You can hear
      this.)

      The case of the MIDI-Interface must be connected to the Ground of the
	  PCB.
	  
	I wish you good luck. If you have some unsolvable trouble, you may con-
	tact me. (address see above)
