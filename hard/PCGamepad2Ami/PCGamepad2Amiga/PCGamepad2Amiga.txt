PCGamepad2Amiga describes how to build an adapter for connecting a PC gamepad
or joystick to the Amiga and use it as digital joystick.
This new version now supports two fire buttons. There are Amiga games that
support 2 buttons, e.g. Mortal Kombat 2. If you know of other games with
2 button support please let me know (see below).

Although I'm quite sure that this circuit doesn't do any harm to your
hardware if set up CORRECTLY, I take NO responsibility for any damage,
even if I got something wrong.
This project demands a bit of experience, so please leave it, if you don't
know what you are doing.

Introduction:

Some PC games are much better playable with gamepads than with normal
(analogue) joysticks. These gamepads work just like the digital joysticks
we know from Amiga/Atari ST/C64. But they got a circuit that converts the
digital signal into an analogue one so that the PC can handle them as 
analogue joysticks. To use these gamepads with your Amiga you have two
choises:
1. Open the gamepad and make some changes in it
2. Build an adapter that lets you use any PC gamepad without making changes



Parts You Need:

1x DB15 female connector
1x DB9  female connector
2x 22K  resistor
2x 8.2K resistor
2x 100K resistor
2x 120K resistor
2x 33K  resistor
6x BC549C (transistor) or equivalent (like BC237C, BC238C, BC239C, BC547C,
	BC548C) 

and optionally (see below): 2x 82K resistor and 2x 100K potentiometer


You can set up the whole adaptor on one of these experimental-boards, so
you don't have to solder anything (maybe except the wires to the connectors)
and make sure it works. Afterwards you can solder the parts on a breadboard
and put it in a suitable box.



Compatibility:

I have tested the adapter on two Amigas and on C64 with these gamepads:
QTRONIX Orion 95, QuickShot Starfighter 5 (QS-191) and Gravis PC GamePad.
It also works fine with my analogue PC joystick (QuickShot Warrior 5).
Most analogue PC joysticks have trimmers for calibration that allow you to
adjust them to the adapter.
It should also work with digital PC joysticks like COMPETITION PRO, but
I haven't tested that.

Nevertheless you could have a gamepad/joystick that produces other voltages
than the above mentioned gamepads, that means you need to change at least
two resistors. Therefore I included a more flexible version of the adapter,
that lets you calibrate the circuit to work with your gamepad/joystick.
You just have to replace the two 120K resistors with two 82K resistors and
two variable resistors of 100K (see "Adjustable_Adapter.iff").

Note: 
If you have the adapter connected to your computer without a gamepad/joystick
plugged in has the same effect as if you press a connected stick/pad back and
right. This is no bug, because if you move the pad or stick to the right,
there will be a voltage of 0V at pin 3 (PotY). Analogous with pin 6 (PotX).

Note for usage of 4 button gamepads:
If you want to use all four fire buttons (as one Amiga fire button), you can
connect them to the Amiga like this:

PC gamepad:                                                Amiga game port:

fire 1 (pin 2)  __________________________________________ fire (pin 6)
fire 2 (pin 7)  ________|
fire 3 (pin 10) ________|
fire 4 (pin 14) ________|

Thanks to my brother Michael for advice and to Axel Stahl for lending me his
Gravis Pad.
Special thanks to Tomek Zebik for telling me that Mortal Kombat II supports
2 fire buttons.

this project, feel free to contact me.
Please also send me a message if you know of other Amiga games supporting
2 or more fire buttons.
