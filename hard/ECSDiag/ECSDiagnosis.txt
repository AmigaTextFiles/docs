        This is a program that I wrote in Amiga E v2.1, because there was
no similar program, and the only sheet is from commodore, and is red,
making it very difficult to photocopy.  Anyway, this is my program, it
requires 2.04 (I think, I have no 1.3 machine to test it on!)  It contains
all the diagnoses from every check sheet I have access to, including
breakdowns of port problems, disk drives problems, keyboards, graphics,
audio, parallel port problems, and about everything  I could think of, even
mouse & joystick problems.
        It is designed to use REQTOOLS.library(sorry, I can't remember who
wrote it), anyway, it works fine using a 640 screen(although I use a 698x283!)
I hope that it will work with REQ.library, as well as asl.library(Although
I wouldn't know why anyone would want to use there, as reqtools is SOOO
much better!)
        It is designed for certainty with the A500-A2500 in mind, although
I am not sure about the A3000, all my tech friends say it will work with
the A3000(with possible exception to graphics problems.)  I have no
certainty of its usefulness with AGA machines (1200 & 4000)

        If anyone has a tech diagnosis sheet for any AGA machines, I would
love to have a copy to add to this program.
