              Programmer for at89 series chips.

   I. Introduction.

 This  piece  of  hardware  &  software  is for programming at89 series MCU from
ATMEL.    It   supports   currently  at89c1051/2051/4051  and  at89c51/52.   All
operations,  such  as  erasing, programming, reading, verifying and setting lock
are  supported.   You  can  easily modify software to deal with other chips like
at90s2313 and more.


   II. Some notes on hardware.

 Hardware  should  be  connected to the parallel port of your amiga.  You should
also  provide 12v supply (taken from amiga as well).  82c55 is preferred because
of  high  power  consumption  of  NMOS  8255A (which in turn would cause extreme
heating  of  7805).   4013  flipflops have reset level of logic one, the same as
8255.   LEDs  indicate  state  of hardware:  green - it is safe to remove/insert
chip, red - chip is powered (no removing).


   III. Software notes.

 Working  with  software  is  quite  easy, especially when you've read output of
'aprg  HELP' command.  Software will simply do specified jobs, as soon as it has
determined  type of inserted chip.  Any problems (like absence of hardware) will
cause error messages.


   IV. Support of new MCUs.

 This  program  is opensource, and it can be easily adapted for a new chip.  All
you  have  to do is just to add new entry in struct chipinfo (with corresponding
new functions) and to modify chip_Identify() function.  If you've added new MCU,
feel  free to send me your modifications.  You can also contact me, if you don't
want to do it yourself - hopefully we will find a way to solve your problems :).
