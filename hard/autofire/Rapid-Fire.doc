In order to keep up with the fast paced arcade action built into today's
computer games, it is often necessary to come up with an edge. Sometimes
you need to be able to shoot 30 to 50 aliens a second, or blast tunnels
through solid raster.  With the device presented here, you will be able
to modify your favorite joystick to become an adjustable switch select-
able rapid fire menace!

	This project should work on any Atari-style joystick interface using 
DB-9s, including Amigas, C-64's and C-128's, Atari ST's etc. and even many
console machines.

	The circuit developed to do this has been optimized to a single CMOS
gate package (4011) and a few capacitors and resistors. It generates a
50% duty cycle square wave, which is important for programs which respond
to the highest rates of fire. Imagine the program sampling the port for
fire button presses trying to see a signal that is only on for 10% of the
time. Many of these signals would go unnoticed at high rates of fire. 
This circuit does not suffer from a duty cycle problem unlike many 555 IC
based designs.  It should also function well on a wide variety of supply
voltages (+3 and up) although +5v is the recommended voltage. 

	It uses a 50K to 100K potentiometer to control the rate.  There is
an LED to indicate when the fire button is pressed in normal mode, or at
what rate it is firing in rapid-fire mode. And of course, there is a  switch
to select between normal and rapid-fire modes. The circuit is designed around
a pair of NAND gates wired up as a free running oscillator. An additional 
NAND gate is used on the input, to invert the incoming signal from the fire
button on the joystick, and to enable the oscillator. The output from the
oscillator drives a small LED and the final NAND gate,  which reinverts
the signal, making it the right polarity for the computer. Before the output
from the last NAND gate gets to the computer, it is passed through a small
signal diode to keep the signal active only when low.

	When constructing the circuit, it is possible to make it small enough
to fit in an existing joystick. This takes some patience and practice, but
the results are well worth the added brainwork & effort. Alternately, it 
may be place in a small box in-line between a joystick and the computer.
The only disadvantage with this approach is that the enable/disable switch
is not as convienient to reach.  Take whatever approach you like, it's easy
enough to build several, or remove them if you don't like them.

In most joysticks only up, down, left, right, fire and ground are wired
to the computer, the +5v signal is absent from the cable. In order to power
the circuit, you must get a cable that has all nine wires, or perhaps, add
external power (A 9 volt battery may suffice). If your joystick does not 
have the necessary wires, I suggest you go to your local Radio Shack, and
purchase a joystick extension cord. These cords are 10 feet long and pass
all 9 wires!  Cut off the male end & use the rest on your joystick, or
save a few feet of wire and the male end for your next hacker project.

Use the diagram in the included IFF picture to wire up your rapid-fire
module. Be careful when wiring up the 9-pin connector to your computer,
a short circuit could cause permanent damage. The IC used here is CMOS,
and sensitive to static discharge, so take the normal precautions when
handling it. Good Luck!
