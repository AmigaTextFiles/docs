This project started when a user at Aces High asked me how to connect a second
fire-button. So here I have drawn a picture of how to do it...

Here are how you connect a second or even third fire-button to your Amiga

Add on #1: Analog converter!
This was done a while ago... But I haden't tested it until I tested it with
Virtual Karting and it worked out just fine! It is a converter-cable to
connect PC-Joysticks to Amiga... analog ofcause!
