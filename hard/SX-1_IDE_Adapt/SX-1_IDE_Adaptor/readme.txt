SX-1 EXTERNALE IDE -> AT-BUS HD ADAPTOR
---------------------------------------

This is a little hardware reference to connect an AT-BUS HD to the external
DB-37 connector on the SX-1. I've made this little doc for all the people
like me that have the SX-1 manual without the Pin-Out of the IDE external
connector. For this i've used a simple tester and a lot of time to waste.
Fortunately i haven't buried anything during my experiments with this cable.

Enjoy it...
