       Well, this is my first hardware project for Amiga computers via 
eletronic mail. If you find it a little difficult to understand (this 
document or the whole project!), please forgive me and contact me, so I 
can improve it next time...

       Just a little bit of history:

       This sampler was developed because I wasn't able to find the 
ADC0802 chip here in Brazil. All samplers I could find on e-mail used it, 
but I only found the ADC 0808. Then, I decided to project my own sampler, 
using the '08 chip, otherwise I would go mad...

       Now that I AM mad, you can enjoy this useful project like me, with 
an stereo version of this sampler.

       The ADC 0808 (or 0809) is a monolithic CMOS device with an 8 bit 
A/D converter with typical conversion time of 100 µs, like the 0802. The 
main differences are the 8 channels multiplexing analog switches and no 
internal clock generator. The IFF file named "Sampler.dat" contains the 
connection diagram for the 0808 and the LM324 chips, both used on this 
project.

       To build the sampler, you will need:





      Quant.   Component



       01      ADC 0808  - A/D converter

       01      LM 324    - Quad operational Amplifier

       01      CD 4093   - or any other 4 "inverter" gates

       02      1N914 (or similar) diodes



       02      1K   1/8W resistor

       02      100K 1/8W resistor

       02      470K 1/8W resistor

       02      47K  1/8W resistor

       01      3K3  1/8W resistor

       01      68K  1/8W resistor

       01      220K trim pot

       02      100K potentiometers



       02      220nF ceramic capacitor

       02      100µF eletrolitic capacitor



       02      any-color-you-like 3 mm leds



       02 knobs for the potentiometers, a 25 pin D type socket for the 
Amiga parallel port, 02 RCA jacks, a printed circuit board and usual 
eletronic stuff.

       

       Circuit description



        Following the diagram on file "Sampler.pic" is easy to understand 
how to connect the ADC chip to the parallel port of the Amiga. Adress 
lines A and B are used to switch left/right inputs, and adress line C is 
held low to keep adress range between 0 and 3. The part of the circuit 
marked with a gray background must be repeated for the right channel and 
connected to input 2 of the ADC chip. The three gates of CD 4093 are used 
as a clock generator. The fourth gate is used as an inverter for the 
STROBE line from the computer. It is good to remember that almost any 
"inverter" gate can be used for the clock generator and strobe line. I 
used the 4093 only because I already had one at home.

       The 220 K trim-pot is used to calibrate the overload level for 
both channels. To set the right point of the trim-pot, connect an analog 
source at the inputs and turn the trim-pot until the Leds start flashing 
very dim. It's a good idea to connect and audio source like a CD player 
to adjust the trim pot. If you don't want the overload sensor, just don't 
wire it and it won't be there. It's there just to use the other 2 built-
in op.amp. on LM324 that would be left useles otherwise.       

     

    Assembling the circuit



        The sampler circuit should be mounted over a PCB designed only 
for it. If you try to use wire-wrap or other kind of work, like proto-
boards or similar, you'll be very impressed with the noise! Make all 
connections very short and use shielded cable for the RCA inputs and rec 
level potentiometers. If you use a metal case, ground  it to the audio 
inputs.

               After putting all the stuff together, double check all 
wiring and conect the sampler to the amiga parallel port. REMEMBER TO 
TURN THE COMPUTER OFF BEFORE DOING IT!!! 

               Now, pick up your favorite sampler/editor software like 
AudioMaster III, or any similar commercial or PD software. If there's 
any, choose Perfect Sound 1 or 2 from the setup menu. You're now ready to 
make your first sample! Some mono programs use the left channel input, 
and others use the right, so don't be upseted if things go wrong at the 
first time. I tested my prototype on AudioMaster III, NoiseTracker, 
OctaMed 2.0, Future Sound 1.0 and they all worked well. The demo files 
were sampled by AudioMaster III. I decided to send as a demo one bit of 
Mozart's work, so I don't think there will be any difficulty to recognise 
it... Take care when sampling copyrighted music! Anyway, this' not my 
business :-)
