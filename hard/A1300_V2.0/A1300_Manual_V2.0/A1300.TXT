                                  PAY ATTENTION!!!

I AM NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY CAUSE TO YOUR A1200
...MY SYSTEM WORKS PERFECTLY,BUT BEFORE STARTING YOU GOTTA PRACTICIZE
WITH SOLDERER,TIN,SAW,DRILL AND CUTTING-NIPPERS...
USE IT (THE FILE) AT YOUR OWN RISK AND NOTICE THAT FROM THE
MOMENT YOU UNSCREW ANY OF THE SCREWS OF YOUR A1200 YOU UNVALIDATE THE A1200
WARRANTY

THANX TO :

-Franz (Francesco Simonetto) for having helped me to build up many
 of the parts this case is made of (and for having held me back
 each time I wanted to burn everything down)

-"Teacher" Michael Griggs for having helped me to correct the old version
 (hehe!! your english lessons haz been a lott very much usefuller than that I
 thinked,az you cann see =) )

-LOGICA (Pn) for having helped me to desolder the white keyboard
 connector (u needn't such an "external" help as everything I have
 written is enough)

Hi everybody!!! If you got this file it means that you want to "pack" your
A1200 into a PC minitower and that you are still in love with your
wonderful A1200 keyboard


My "configuration" :

-A1200
-Blizzard 1230 IV (with coprocessor 882) - not necessary for you
-2 HD IDE (if you have a 2.5 HD see 9) ) - not necessary for you
-1 (obvious) internal floppy
-a lot of patience
-3 or 4 grey cells


What you need (other than the things I've just mentioned) :

-a river of patience
-a solderer
-a drill
-1 or 2 "sticks" of tin for electric soldering
-a little pump that sucks up melted tin (very cheap
 and funny to use with your tongue when you
 have nothing to do, but pay attention:
 tin mix is dangerous)
-a minitower case (mine is "TERRA CASE TK330",dimensions:
 41.3 cm. x 35.8 cm. x 17.5 cm.)

wires
-----
-lots of reels of electric wire (sect 0.6 mm.)
-a 36 pin wire (similar to the one you use to connect
 the data flow of your HD) which is as long as you require your
 keyboard to be from your case (mine is 2 meters long)
-a 34 pin flat cable to connect your floppy disk to
 your motherboard(the one you own is not long enough)
 about 30 (or more) cm. long
-(if you own 2 HD's) a 40 pins "L" shaped normal HD
 data wire about 40 cm. long (with 3 females connectors)
 (you can use the one you already have,on condition
 that it is long enough)

connectors
----------
-a male connector for power supply like the one
 that comes out from the A1200 pow.suppl. box
-2 female audio connectors (like the ones your Amiga has)
-2 male audio connectors (same format
 PAY ATTENTION TO ASK FOR 2 FEMALE
 CONNECTORS WHICH HAVE ALSO A MASK TO BE INSERTED AND
 FIXED TO A PANEL see picture 0a )
-2 female 9 pins connectors (like your mouse connector)
-2 male 9 pins connectors (with mask) (like your joystick connectors)
-2 female 25 pins connectors (like Amiga parallel port)
-2 corresponding male 25 pins connectors (with mask)
-1 female 23 pins connector (like Amiga video port)
-1 corresponding male 23 pins connector (with mask)
-1 female 37 pins connector
-1 male 37 pins connector (with mask)
-12 screws to be inserted into your connectors masks
-12 tins suitable for the screws
-12 washers suitable for the tins
-2 screws suitable for the audio connectors masks
-2 tins suitable for these last 2 screws
-2 washers suitable for these last 2 tins

others
------
-a shell suitable for the male 36 pin connector
-cutting nippers for metal (only if you own the Blizzard)
-3 screws M3 (3 mm. diameter) 5 cm. long
-9 tins suitable for the 3 screws
-9 washers suitable for the 9 tins
-a saw for metal (useful if you wanna find out what's under
 your skin...and if you r good enough you
 can see how deep the flesh of your fingers is... isn't this enough?
 well,you also will be able to find out the difference between
 arterial and venous blood)
-little panels to fix in the ports panel of the case
 (with all the Amiga ports shaped holes)
-a vice is highly recommended



GETTING READY

Unscrew the A1200 motherboard from the metal panel,using a lot of patience
in unscrewing the ports

Don't throw those stupid and strange hexagonal screws away!!  They'll be
helpful later

Throw away the transparent plastic sheet you find below the motherboard
(or try breathing onto it and painting indecent drawings)

Throw away also the 2 metal panels unless you need something to beat onto
to wake up your parents in the middle of the night 



0)   LEARNING TO SOLDER

-first of all switch on your solderer and wait for it to become hot
 enough to make you scream a big "FU*$£K YA!!!" when you touch it to
 test if it is hot enough.

-take an electric wire and cut about 1 cm. of plastic covering
 away from it (pay attention not to cut the metallic threads)

-curl the metallic threads enough to have an almost solid wire

-stabilize the wire (i.e. with a vice)...if you r good enough you can do
 this by using a hand only...(best wishes!!)

-take the solderer and the tin and let the point of the solderer TOUCH
 the "naked" wire together with the tin

-spread the melted tin onto the "naked" part of the wire

-mind not to form big DROPS of tin,the coating MUST be even and thin

-cut away about 1 mm. of the wire soldered point



1)   BUILDING UP EXTENSIONS

you need this to connect your motherboard ports
(joystick,mouse,parallel,serial, video) to the back of the case, where
ports have to be.  I've heard of many people who have adopted many other
solutions, but this is the only way to make a clean job and to adapt the
motherboard into your case in the way it was conceived to be (if you want
your Amiga to be packed into a miniTower).

-for each port take the female connector, connect to the male connector so
 that you have a more "solid" unit to work with and so that the plastic
 around the pin of the connectors won't melt

-cut the wire into pieces of length 40-50 cm. and do what's described in
 0) for each piece of wire and for each edge of the piece of the wire

-stabilize the edge of each wire (ONE PER TIME) into the small basin of
 the pin in the the connector

-take the solderer and the tin and touch with the solderer and the tin
 the edge of the wire AND the small basin so that you melt the tin of the
 wire and the tin in the stick to connect the wire to the basin

-do this for every pin of the connector.Check picture 1a

-when you have finished with the male (or the female) side you have to
 connect the other edge of the wire.. MAKE SURE YOU connect the pins
 in the right way!!! (Check picture 1a)

-building audio extensions is quite simple...you simply have to
 connect the inner contact of a female connector to the inner contact
 of the corresponding male connector,and do the same with the outer
 (GND) contact



2)   FIXING  HARDISK(S) AND FLOPPY DISK INTO THE SMALL BASKET

-unscrew the cover of the case and take it off

-unscrew the side panel (where you'll have to fix your mother case) and
 take it off

-unscrew the small basket where HD's and floppy disk will sit and take
 it off (BE CAREFUL!)

-fix HD and Floppy Disk into the small basket the way you like most (I
 suggest, from upper to lower side: Floppy,HD,HD)

-take away the plastic mask at the height of your floppy disk



3)   CUTTING THE FRONT METALLIC PANEL OF THE CASE
(for Blizzard board owners only)

-if you try to put the motherboard of your 1200 with the blizzard you'll
 find out (after 3 or 4 hundred of curses) that the Blizzard is too
 long to fit

so you have to do this:

-unscrew the front plastic panel of the case and take it off

-take away the stupid useless little speaker and its case

-use the cutting nippers and the saw to cut the metal front panel like
 described in picture 3a



4)   CONNECTING THE KEYBOARD

...ok now the most delicate part of the journey...

-take off the blizzard board and the rest of the wires (leds,HD data
 and power supply,floppy disk power supply ones...) from the A1200
 motherboard

-find the white keyboard connector on your motherboard (31 pins)
 see picture 4a

-take off the green plastic wire from the white connector (pick up
 a little piece of white plastic in the white connector then take the
 green ribbon out)

-overturn the motherboard and put it on a clean cold isolating surface

... NEXT THING IS HIGHLY RISKY IF YOU ARE NOT SKILFUL ENOUGH ...
it is not too difficult,but be sure to be able enough to handle the
little pump and the solderer together

-find out the soldered connectors on your motherboard corresponding to
 the white keyboard connector

-melt and spread a reasonable quantity of fresh tin onto the soldered
 connectors (I know,you have to "short-circuit" them)
 (this enable you to melt and suck up in a better way ALL the tin on
 the mother board)

-using the solderer and the little pump suck ALL the tin up from the
 31 connectors on the mother board using a bit of patience

-done? good,take off the white connector from the motherboard (if you need
 it pushing it gently forward and backward)



5)   BUILDING KEYBOARD EXTENSION CABLE

-take the 36 pin wire and isolate each one from the others paying attention
 to leave each one isolated from the others (both edges)

-do with each edge what's in 0) paying attention to follow the measures
 given in picture 5a (both edges)

-solder and connect the grey 36 pins flat cable -like in picture 5b - to
 the white connector pins

-take the male 37 pins connector and solder it to the 36 pins flat
 cable, remembering that pin 1 of the cable has to be connected
 like in picture 5c

-remember to use the metal ring to fix the cable in the 37 pins
 connector shell (so that pulling the cable won't unsteady the contacts)

-take 31 pieces of normal wire 30-40 cm. long and connect each one to
 the hole in the motherboard where the white keyboard connector used to be

-now connect each of the 31 wires coming out from the motherboard to the
 FEMALE 37-pin connector like in picture 5d



6)   CONNECTING LEDS

-ok ...now 36-31 is... 5!!! (WOW!!) ...so..what can we do of the 5 grey
 wires
 left on the cable? Let's use them to connect leds to keyboard!!!

-unscrew the green little led panel of the A1200 (the one screwed to
 your keyboard case)

-unsolder the 4 wires soldered to it (black,red,orange,green)

-connect the edges of these wires to 4 of the 5 basins left on the 37
 pins female connector (in the order you like best)

-now on the 36 pins cable (keyboard side)take 4 other grey wires and
 extend them with 4 pieces of normal wire (about 30 cm.)

-connect the edges of these 4 extension wires to the holes just
 desoldered on the little green led panel

-now check the order you have just connected these last 4 wires in and
 solder the grey wires of the 36-pin flat cable (corresponding to the
 extension wires just soldered to the led panel) in the right order to the
 male 37 pins connector (you can check the right color on the little leds
 panel...it is written there)

-there should now be only one grey wire not connected on the 36 pins
 cable and 2 pins free on the 37-pin connector

check picture 6a



7)   CONNECTING POWER SUPPLY

-lots of wires come out from the little pow.supp. basket in the case

-there is a group of 6 wires: blue,orange,black,black,red,yellow

-cut out the white connector which contains these 6 wires and do with
 the wires (unless one of the 2 black ones, it is indifferent which one)
 what's described in 0)

-connect the 5 wires as in picture 7a,throwing away (pay attention not
 to dislocate your wirst) the plastic shell (hope you have the same
 tension values, otherwise check one of the many aminet files talking
 about this argument)

-you can fix the last black wire with some good tape connecting it to any
 metal part of the case (you can even solder it).Check picture 7b



8)   REPLACING THE BACK PORTS PANEL
(for Blizzard board owners only)

-unscrew the back ports panel of your case and replace it the way it is
 shown in picture 8a



9)   FIXING THE MOTHERBOARD

-I suggest you to use these 3 holes in the A1200 motherboard to fix it
 to the support: see picture 9a (if you use the metal support for your 2.5
 HD you'd better find a different solution)

-with the drill enlarge (GENTLY!!!!!) hole 2 and 3 to a suitable measure
 for your long screws to fit in (pay attention not to ruin the NOT-GND
 circuits on the motherboard)

-drill with the same tip size (3 mm. should be ok) like in picture
 9b, but I suggest you sign the right measures using a black feltpen

-put on the Blizzard board

-fix the motherboard like in picture 9c, doing as described

-notice that the extreme part of the Blizzard should almost "touch"
 (ALMOST!!) the frontal plastic panel once inserted (try it).
 Check picture 9d

-you will probably have to cut out the lowest long screwing guide
 (the one which would block the insertion of your Blizzard).See picture
 9d

-I had to unscrew and overturn the little box containing the contacts
 of the "ON-OFF SWITCH" because my motherboard didn't fit...quite
 easy.Check picture 9d



10)   CONNECTING PORTS

-once you have fixed the mothercase you have to connect all the port
 extensions to it,and the extensions to the little rectangular panels
 that have to be screwed to the back of the case

-you would be a wizard to own a small panel with a hole with the
 right shape for the 36 pins connector,but with a bit of ability
 (and with the help of the same old curses) you can build it using
 the drill (small tip!)...or enlarging an already present 25 pins
 connector hole... the same things apply as about the audio connectors

-take the case back port panel and fix each port as described in picture
 10a and 10b

-do it for each port

-regarding the keyboard connector there is a little trick:  as it is quite
 heavy it may be too unsteady to be connected...use the strange hexagonal
 screws uscrewed from the original Amiga ports to fix the male connector
 to the female through the little port panel as in picture 10c



11)   BUILDING KEYBOARD CASE

-saw (yes,saw!) the upper and the lower keyboard part like in picture 11a

-don't throw away the 2 circular rubber buttons under the forward part
 of the sawn case: unstick them and stick them to the part of the
 keyboard case you are to keep

-screw the little green led board to your keyboard like it has always
 been

-fix with some tape or with a decent glue (or better with a suitable
 locking metal ring) the keyboard cable into the plastic case and
 let it come out of the frontal plastic grating so that pulling it
 from outside won't unsteady the contacts.  See picture 11b

-stick together the keyboard plastic panel with the sawn one like in
 picture 11c(I suggest you to use a sort of liquid steel stick,very
 useful (I used LOCTITE METAPOXI))

-check picture 11d



12)   LAST THINGS TO DO

-isolate with a generous turn of isolating tape the stupid metallic
 original mouse port,or it'll be free to hang dangerously onto the
 motherboard circuits

-rescrew the little basket which now contains your HD's and your floppy

-connect the data cable to your HD and to your floppy (and to
 motherboard)

-connect the general 5 pins power supply cable to your A1200 motherboard
 and the 2 HD power supply connectors too (easy to find:they are the same
 as the ones you already own)

-connect the floppy disk power supply connector (same than the one you
 had on your motherboard) directly from the case to your floppy

-take away all the stupid wires which come out from the front plastic
 panel and the leds too

-build the floppy disk mask drilling and shaping the rectangular plastic
 mask of the case

-DONE? ...good... and now u can throw all your case away 'cause this
 file was only a trick!!! haha!!! ...just kidding,just kidding.. =9
 everything is all right

-before screwing everything and switching on I suggest you to un-plug
 the Blizzard



13)   TRICKS

-you can connect your monitor directly to the case for having only
 one power switcher by which you can turn on the computer AND the monitor
 all at once. See picture 13a

... cross your fingers ... and...

WELCOME TO THE FANTASTIC A1300 WORLD!!!
