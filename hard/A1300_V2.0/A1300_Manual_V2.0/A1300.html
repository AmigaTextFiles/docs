Unscrew the A1200 motherboard from the metal panel,using a lot of patience<BR>
in unscrewing the ports<BR>
<BR>
Don't throw those stupid and strange hexagonal screws away!!  They'll be<BR>
helpful later<BR>
<BR>
Throw away the transparent plastic sheet you find below the motherboard<BR>
(or try breathing onto it and painting indecent drawings)<BR>
<BR>
Throw away also the 2 metal panels unless you need something to beat onto<BR>
to wake up your parents in the middle of the night <BR>

</CENTER><BR>
-first of all switch on your solderer and wait for it to become hot<BR>
 enough to make you scream a big &quot;FU*$£K YA!!!&quot; when you touch it to<BR>
 test if it is hot enough.<BR>
<BR>
-take an electric wire and cut about 1 cm. of plastic covering<BR>
 away from it (pay attention not to cut the metallic threads)<BR>
<BR>
-curl the metallic threads enough to have an almost solid wire<BR>
<BR>
-stabilize the wire (i.e. with a vice)...if you r good enough you can do<BR>
 this by using a hand only...(best wishes!!)<BR>
<BR>
-take the solderer and the tin and let the point of the solderer TOUCH<BR>
 the &quot;naked&quot; wire together with the tin<BR>
<BR>
-spread the melted tin onto the &quot;naked&quot; part of the wire<BR>
<BR>
-mind not to form big DROPS of tin,the coating MUST be even and thin<BR>
<BR>
-cut away about 1 mm. of the wire soldered point<BR>

<STRONG>1)   BUILDING UP EXTENSIONS</STRONG><BR>
<A HREF="#Index"></FONT>
back to index <BR>
</A>
</CENTER><BR>
you need this to connect your motherboard ports<BR>
(joystick,mouse,parallel,serial, video) to the back of the case, where<BR>
ports have to be.  I've heard of many people who have adopted many other<BR>
solutions, but this is the only way to make a clean job and to adapt the<BR>
motherboard into your case in the way it was conceived to be (if you want<BR>
your Amiga to be packed into a miniTower).<BR>
<BR>
-for each port take the female connector, connect to the male connector so<BR>
 that you have a more &quot;solid&quot; unit to work with and so that the plastic<BR>
 around the pin of the connectors won't melt<BR>
<BR>
-cut the wire into pieces of length 40-50 cm. and do what's described in<BR>
 0) for each piece of wire and for each edge of the piece of the wire<BR>
<BR>
-stabilize the edge of each wire (ONE PER TIME) into the small basin of<BR>
 the pin in the the connector<BR>
<BR>
-take the solderer and the tin and touch with the solderer and the tin<BR>
 the edge of the wire AND the small basin so that you melt the tin of the<BR>
 wire and the tin in the stick to connect the wire to the basin<BR>
<BR>
-do this for every pin of the connector.Check picture below<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC=" Pictures/1a-Extensions" ALT="Extensions"><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
-when you have finished with the male (or the female) side you have to<BR>
 connect the other edge of the wire.. MAKE SURE YOU connect the pins<BR>
 in the right way!!! (Check picture above)<BR>
<BR>
-building audio extensions is quite simple...you simply have to<BR>
 connect the inner contact of a female connector to the inner contact<BR>
 of the corresponding male connector,and do the same with the outer<BR>
 (GND) contact<BR>

if you try to put the motherboard of your 1200 with the blizzard you'll<BR>
find out (after 3 or 4 hundred of curses) that the Blizzard is too<BR>
long to fit<BR>
<BR>
so you have to do this:<BR>
<BR>
-unscrew the front plastic panel of the case and take it off<BR>
<BR>
-take away the stupid useless little speaker and its case<BR>
<BR>
-use the cutting nippers and the saw to cut the metal front panel like<BR>
 described in picture below<BR>

</CENTER><BR>
...ok now the most delicate part of the journey...<BR>
<BR>
-take off the blizzard board and the rest of the wires (leds,HD data<BR>
 and power supply,floppy disk power supply ones...) from the A1200<BR>
 motherboard<BR>
<BR>
-find the white keyboard connector on your motherboard (31 pins)<BR>
 see picture below<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/4a-White_connector" ALT="White connector"><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
-take off the green plastic wire from the white connector (pick up<BR>
 a little piece of white plastic in the white connector then take the<BR>
 green ribbon out)<BR>
<BR>
-overturn the motherboard and put it on a clean cold isolating surface<BR>
<BR>
... NEXT THING IS HIGHLY RISKY IF YOU ARE NOT SKILFUL ENOUGH ...<BR>
it is not too difficult,but be sure to be able enough to handle the<BR>
little pump and the solderer together<BR>
<BR>
-find out the soldered connectors on your motherboard corresponding to<BR>
 the white keyboard connector<BR>
<BR>
-melt and spread a reasonable quantity of fresh tin onto the soldered<BR>
 connectors (I know,you have to &quot;short-circuit&quot; them)<BR>
 (this enable you to melt and suck up in a better way ALL the tin on<BR>
 the mother board)<BR>
<BR>
-using the solderer and the little pump suck ALL the tin up from the<BR>
 31 connectors on the mother board using a bit of patience<BR>
<BR>
-done? good,take off the white connector from the motherboard (if you need<BR>
 it pushing it gently forward and backward)<BR>

-take the 36 pin wire and isolate each one from the others paying attention<BR>
 to leave each one isolated from the others (both edges)<BR>
<BR>
-do with each edge what's in 0) paying attention to follow the measures<BR>
 given in picture below (both edges)<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/5a-Keyboard_connector" ALT="Keyboard connector"><BR>

 the white connector pins<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/5b-Keyboard_connector" ALT="Keyboard connector"><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
-take the male 37 pins connector and solder it to the 36 pins flat<BR>
 cable, remembering that pin 1 of the cable has to be connected<BR>
 like in picture below<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/5c-Keyboard_connector" ALT="Keyboard connector"><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
-remember to use the metal ring to fix the cable in the 37 pins<BR>
 connector shell (so that pulling the cable won't unsteady the contacts)<BR>
<BR>
-take 31 pieces of normal wire 30-40 cm. long and connect each one to<BR>
 the hole in the motherboard where the white keyboard connector used to be<BR>
<BR>
-now connect each of the 31 wires coming out from the motherboard to the<BR>

-ok ...now 36-31 is... 5!!! (WOW!!) ...so..what can we do of the 5 grey<BR>
 wires left on the cable? Let's use them to connect leds to keyboard!!!<BR>
<BR>
-unscrew the green little led panel of the A1200 (the one screwed to<BR>
 your keyboard case)<BR>
<BR>
-unsolder the 4 wires soldered to it (black,red,orange,green)<BR>
<BR>
-connect the edges of these wires to 4 of the 5 basins left on the 37<BR>
 pins female connector (in the order you like best)<BR>
<BR>
-now on the 36 pins cable (keyboard side)take 4 other grey wires and<BR>
 extend them with 4 pieces of normal wire (about 30 cm.)<BR>
<BR>
-connect the edges of these 4 extension wires to the holes just<BR>
 desoldered on the little green led panel<BR>
<BR>
-now check the order you have just connected these last 4 wires in and<BR>
 solder the grey wires of the 36-pin flat cable (corresponding to the<BR>
 extension wires just soldered to the led panel) in the right order to the<BR>
 male 37 pins connector (you can check the right color on the little leds<BR>
 panel...it is written there)<BR>
<BR>
-there should now be only one grey wire not connected on the 36 pins<BR>
 cable and 2 pins free on the 37-pin connector<BR>

 what's described in 0)<BR>
<BR>
-connect the 5 wires as in picture below,throwing away (pay attention not<BR>

 about this argument)<BR>

-I suggest you to use these 3 holes in the A1200 motherboard to fix it<BR>

 HD you'd better find a different solution)<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/9a-Holes" ALT="Holes"><BR>

-with the drill enlarge (GENTLY!!!!!) hole 2 and 3 to a suitable measure<BR>
 for your long screws to fit in (pay attention not to ruin the NOT-GND<BR>
 circuits on the motherboard)<BR>
<BR>
-drill with the same tip size (3 mm. should be ok) like in picture<BR>
 below, but I suggest you sign the right measures using a black feltpen<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/9b-Holes" ALT="Holes"><BR>

<BR>
-fix the motherboard like in picture below, doing as described<BR>
<CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=" Pictures/9c-Holes" ALT="Holes"><BR>

-once you have fixed the mothercase you have to connect all the port<BR>

 the drill (small tip!)...or enlarging an already present 25 pins<BR>

-rescrew the little basket which now contains your HD's and your floppy<BR>
<BR>
-connect the data cable to your HD and to your floppy (and to<BR>
 motherboard)<BR>
<BR>
-connect the general 5 pins power supply cable to your A1200 motherboard<BR>
 and the 2 HD power supply connectors too (easy to find:they are the same<BR>
 as the ones you already own)<BR>
<BR>
-connect the floppy disk power supply connector (same than the one you<BR>
 had on your motherboard) directly from the case to your floppy<BR>
<BR>
-take away all the stupid wires which come out from the front plastic<BR>
 panel and the leds too<BR>
<BR>
-build the floppy disk mask drilling and shaping the rectangular plastic<BR>
 mask of the case<BR>
<BR>
-DONE? ...good... and now u can throw all your case away 'cause this<BR>
 file was only a trick!!! haha!!! ...just kidding,just kidding.. =9<BR>
 everything is all right<BR>
<BR>
-before screwing everything and switching on I suggest you to un-plug<BR>
 the Blizzard<BR>

-you can connect your monitor directly to the case for having only<BR>
 one power switcher by which you can turn on the computer AND the monitor<BR>
 all at once. See picture below<BR>
