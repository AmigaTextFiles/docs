ParKeyboard is a hard and software solution to connect a second keyboard by using the parallel port.@{par}

I wrote this tool for testing @{"my" link "Author"} @{"MMKeyboard" link "OtherPRGs"} hardware.
Before using the ParKeyboard interface it was required to bridge my internal interface to get an original Amiga
keyboard connector. If something went wrong I had to do tricky things to get my keyboard working
again. Thanks to ParKeyboard my Amiga owns a second keyboard connector to testing purpose.@{par}

This program should be published on every public medium, as long as all files in the archive are
unchanged. If this medium is a CD, I expect a free copy. (AminetCDs excluded)@{par}

@{b}ParKeyboard is Mailware.@{ub}@{par}

I expect from everybody, who uses ParKeyboard regularly, to send me an email or postcard. I
think this does not hurt anybody, and I will have more fun to integrate new features.@{par}

@{b}I am not liable for injures or data loss caused by ParKeyboard! The use of
ParKeyboard is on your own responsibility !!!@{ub}

@{MS "Buglist"}

The reset handler isn't working by using this keyboard connector! The reason is simple! There is no
way to activate the external reset handler!@{par}

The keyboard repeat isn't working. The reason is: I didn't programmed it. (-8@{par}

Some keyboards (e.G. A500, A1000 and some A2000) aren't reseting the system. ParKeyboard is using
the ResetWarning to detect a reset. For most keyboards and for the @{"MMKeyboard" link "OtherPRGS"}
interface there is no problem with the reset. If there is a problem you may use a hotkey tool and
start a tools like Reboot.

@node "OtherPrgs" "Other programs!"

   @{MS "Other programs!"}
   @{MS "BoulderDäsh   [game/jump/boulderdaesh.lha]"}

Clone of the original Boulderdäsh for Amiga. It is the only version running faster on Amiga than the
original. It looks and behaves like the original. I was asked, where the C64 is. (-8 And all this on
a 68000 without Fastmem.

   @{MS "SimpleCat   [dev/misc/simplecat.lha]"}

This tool is for programmers and user. Using this program you can change catalogs of programs with
your favourite text editor in the easiest way. These programs must include a CS file. Search for it
in the archive of the catalogs drawer.

   @{MS "Afind   [util/misc/afind.lha]"}

With this program you can search for programs on your Aminet CDs in the easiest way. It is the same
than the original tool on the CD, but here you can use AminetCDs and AminetSets mixed. So you are
not forced to search for a program on the first 5 Aminet CDs, that is on AminetSet1 Disc b.

   @{MS "AView   [util/misc/aview.lha]"}

AView is a great multiview enhancement/replacement! It is working like Multiview, but you are able
to specify a special viewer/player for each file type.

   @{MS "Guideformat   [text/edit/guideformat.lha]"}

GuideFormat is a simple tool. It is easy to format text blocks, even if there are "links" or other
guide commands in.

   @{MS "GuideCheck   [text/edit/guidecheck.lha]"}

GuideCheck is a tool, that allows to check an entire guide file and discovers all errors!

   @{MS "SiedlerBoot   [game/patch/siedlerboot.lha]"}

This allows to start the Settlers direct via CD and save the scores on HD. There is no hard disc
install required. SiedlerBoot requires the "Amiga Plus Sonderheft 9" cover CDROM.

   @{MS "Execute64   [misc/emu/execute64.lha]"}

Execute64 allows to transfer file direct into the C64 and to start them. This allows to play games
an use the Amiga a big file server.

   @{MS "R   [util/cli/r.lha]"}

"R" creates a GUI for each DOS Program. This allows you to use DOS commands even if you aren't very
good in reading templates.

   @{MS "DVBControl   [comm/misc/dvbcontrol.lha]"}

DVBControl is a software project for the Nokia MediaMaster (D-Box) and DVB2000 firmware. It allows
to update firmware, edit channel settings and much more. So if you are using DVB2000 and an Amiga
DVBcontrol is your only choice!

   @{MS "MCControl   [hard/hack/mccontrol.lha]"}

MCControl (MemoryCard Control) is a card reader for Playstation MemoryCards. It requires a little
self made hardware (~$5) and the free software!

   @{MS "VBRControl   [util/sys/vbrcontrol.lha]"}

VBRControl moves the processor vector base to fast ram. This is increasing system speed.

   @{MS "AvailCPU   [util/sys/availcpu.lha]"}

AvailCPU is a little program that shows the CPU usage by using the Power LED!

   @{MS "TrackDisplayClock   [util/time/trackdisplaycl.lha]"}

A hardware track display is very useful, if you need it! The most time this type of hardware is only
good for lighting up the room! This will be changed when using TrackDisplayClock! TrackDisplayClock
displays the system time on your track display! Its cool, its useful and of cource the time is
always in visual range. Delete all programs using screens, windows or icons to display the time and
of course don't forget to remove your noclick tool! TrackDisplayClock is doing all these jobs and
your system will be faster than before! (-8

   @{MS "MMKeyboard   [hard/hack/MMKeyboard.lha]"}

MMKeyboard is a hardware for using IBM-PC keyboards on Amiga. It allows to use multimedia keys like
Play or Pause. MMKeyboard supports any key on any keyboard! No special driver for each keyboard like
on the PC! Only one small commodity for all keyboards is required to smuggle the multimedia keys
into the system. MMKeyboard is full reset handler compatible, contains a internal hardware password,
allows to turn your Amiga on and off by using the keyboard and much more.

   @{MS "ParKeyboard   [hard/hack/ParKeyboard.lha]"}

ParKeyboard is a small hard and software project that allows you to use an Amiga keyboard connected
to the parallel port. The interface did't contain any components. Just four wires are required to
adapt the parallel port.

   @{MS "WheelMouseSupport  [util/mouse/WheelMouseSupp.lha]"}

WheelMouseSupport is a WheelBusMouse Software replacement. It allows to use the mouse wheel with most
Amiga programs without any patches.

The hardware is very simple. You only need a box, a PS/2 or DIN connector and a SUB-D 25 Plug.
@{"Here" link "/Pictures/Hardware.ilbm/MAIN"} is a small schematic.@{par}

I used a "SUB-D 25 -> SUB-D 9" interface box. If you bend the pins, a MiniDin6 connector for print
mounting is fitting perfect. Just put it in laying on one side. Use hot glue to fix the connector
position.@{par}

Here a list of the requirec connections:@{par}

@{MS "CXPriority"}

This defines the commodity priority. You shouldn´t change this without a good reason!

@endnode
@node "NoReset" "ParKeyboard Setup: NoReset"

@{MS "NoReset"}

This option allows to disable the keyboard reset (Control, Amiga, Amiga). When pressing the reset
combination nothing happens at all.@{par}

Some keyboards like A500, A1000 and very old A2000 versions didn't allow to reset at all, because
ParKeyboard is using the ResetWarning key code for reset detection. The most keyboards even the
@{"MMKeyboard" link "OtherPRGS"} are supporting the reset process.@{par}
