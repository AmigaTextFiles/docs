<h2>Future plans</h2>

<ul>
<li>support of any your mouse, <a href="compatibility.html#support">if you send it me</a>
<li>advanced system-wide wheels and additional buttons support (will be more useful than FreeWheel and any PeeCee wheel soft)
<li>all preferences as MUI application
<li>two wheels support (A4Tech WOP-35).  PIC16F627 (or 628) will be needed for this - but not required if you don't use second wheel.
<li>joystick simulation (if you don't have real joystick - it will be useful feature for
you): you will can temporary plug Amiga keyboard in controller instead of PS/2 mouse
(through PC PS/2-AT convertor, if your keyboard has DIN-5 connector) and it will act like
a joystick - maybe even configurable.  PIC16F627 (or 628) will be needed for this too - but not
required.
<li>maybe even more - any ideas?
</ul>
