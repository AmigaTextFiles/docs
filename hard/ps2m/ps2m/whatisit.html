<h2>What is PS/2 and what mice may be?</h2>

</font><font color="ffff00">

<img src="ps2.jpeg" width="183" height="200" alt="PS/2 connector" align="right">
PS/2 is a name of old PeeCee series from IBM.  PS/2 computers are forgotten long time ago,
but they have interesting solution - synchron serial port for mouse.  It was times very
early before USB, and this solution become popular in third-party PeeCee motherboards
because of it allows to be free all RS-232C ports.  Now ATX standard defines PS/2 mouse
connector as default, and PS/2 mice become very popular.  Before this time most popular
mice are RS-232C (they have similar DB-9 connector that Amiga mice, but imcompatible
electrically).
<font color="ffffff">PS/2 mice have MiniDIN connector with six pins (see photo)</font>.
RS-232C mice have extremely poor quality - mouse pointer with them doesn't move, it jumps.
It is because generic 3-button RS-232C mouse reports about movement only 25 times per
second.  PS/2 mice work better - all of them can report about state 80 times per second,
and most of them (excluding 5-button or wheel mice) can report <font color="ffffff">200
times per second.</font><p>

RS-232C mice were accessible for Amiga users - there was some software drivers and
hardware controllers.  But it is not good solution because of described above.
PS/2 mice were not accessible on Amiga at very long time - but this time now is in
the past.<p>

PS/2 mouse can work on Amiga with my controller too well as works native Amiga
mouse.  But you can ask - why you will do my controller, if your Amiga mouse works
similarily?<p>

<font color="ffffff">
Here is an advantages of PS/2 mouse usage instead of native Amiga mouse:
</font>

<ul>
<li>New native Amiga mice are relatively rare and expensive.  You can use cheap
PS/2 mouse with self-made controller, and it will cheaper that Amiga mouse.
<li>If you break your mouse for any reason, new PS/2 mouse will be cheaper.
<li>It is more harder to find comfortable ergonomical Amiga mouse, than PS/2 mouse.
<li>Most Amiga mice don't have useful middle button.
<li>You can use second joystick in parallel to PS/2 controller without
switching - my PS/2 controller has special feature for this.
<li>You can use wireless mice.
<li>You can use additional mouse features like wheels and buttons.
<li>You can use modern <font color="ffffff">optical mice</font>.
</ul>

Some words about optical mice - if you don't know what is it.  Agilent company developed
in later 1999 new optical sensor, that can be used in mice instead of ball - see center of
the left picture.  Optical mice <font color="ffffff">don't have inertia, don't require
clearing and mouse pads, always move smoothly, and are much more comfortable than
mechanical ones.</font> Of course, them are relatively expensive - like 25-30 USD for
Genius NetScroll Optical - but mouse cost is not very important in comparison with all
computer cost, and I don't recommend you economize on mouse in damage for your comfort.<p>

<img src="gns_1.jpeg" width="250" height="159" alt="Additional Buttons" align="right">
Additional buttons (look at <font color="ff4040">
<a href="adv_detail.html#buttons">two red buttons</a></font> at the left side
of the mouse) can be used for similation of some actions, like keys pressing - for
example, &laquo;Back&raquo; in Web-browser.  Wheel(s) are used for scrolling, selection of
cycle-gadget item (supported in MUI now) and any other purposes.<p>

Adwantages of my PS/2 controller in comparison with RS-232C mice you can read
<a href="adv_detail.html#linear">here</a>.  Additionally, RS-232C mice require +12v
and -12v logical levels and additional scheme for level transformation - and
PS/2 mice has simple TTL logic levels with +5v power.<p>

</font><font color="ffffff"><h2>Where to get it?</h2></font><font color="ffff00">

It is a self-made product.  I am not a factory building this controller.
If you want it - do it by yourself or ask your friend.  This manual contains
all required instructions, schemes and files.  It will cost for you only
material and your work cost.
