If you want to get tested and certainly working system - buy
<font color="ffffff">Genius NetScroll Optical</font> mouse (PS/2 version).
It has very good ergonomical design and quality.<p>

Don't confuse it with Genius NetScroll+ Eye and NetScroll+ NB!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&laquo;Plus&raquo; models are not better - them don't have additional two buttons.


<h2>Compatibility with different mice</h2>

My controller works with all mice, where it was tested.  But I don't give you any
warranty that it will work with your mouse.<p>

Even if your mouse works at all, there are some differencies in advanced mouse protocols -
supporting wheels and additional buttons.  Microsoft (for this paragraph it is a company
name, not an abuse) instead of it's normal practice to hide all details, published
protocol of wheel mouse.  It has two &laquo;layers&raquo;: protocol of wheel mouse, and
protocol of 5-button wheel mouse.  There are many Microsoft Intellimouse compatible
devices (for example, Genius NetScroll Optical), and all of them will work with wheel at
my controller.  Some other mice are Intellimouse Explorer (5 buttons) compatible.  For
example, it is A4Tech WOP-35.  That mice will work with all 5 buttons.  If you use
4-buttons <a href="version.html">version of controller</a>, both additional buttons
will work as one.<p>

Another mice, like of Genius NetScroll Optical, can be compatible with Intellimouse, but
incompatible with Intellimouse Explorer.  Genius NetScroll supports both Intellimouse and
own protocols.  In Intellimouse mode it works as 3-button wheeled mouse, and in own
Genius-mode it works as 5-button wheeled mouse.  From <b>version 1.5</b>, ps2m supports
both 5-button protocols - Genius NetScroll and MS Intellimouse Explorer.<p>

<a name="support"><h2>Future support of unsupported now mice</h2>

Yet some another mice, like A4Tech WOP-35, can be Intellimouse (and even Explorer)
compatible, but have additional features like two wheels, feedback (Logitech iFeel), etc.
Some mice can have even different ideology - like Maxxtro with &laquo;joystick&raquo;
between buttons.  Additional features of these mice can't be used with current version of
ps2m, but things have characteristic to change :-)<p>

If you have unsupported mice - you can send me it (or money, enough for buy it here) by
mail, and I will do support for it.  If you are interested - welcome to my
<a href="mailto:rdc@cyberlan.mtu-net.ru">e-mail-box</a> ;)<p>


<h2>Compatibility with Amigas and software</h2>

Because of this device has two interfaces - to the computer and to the mouse, I
must describe both questions.<p>

Compatibility with Amiga is not a problem - <font color="ffffff">device will work with all
current Amiga models</font>, from A1000 to A4000 and A1200.  You can even try to adapt it
for Atari ST or any other computer, where was used bus mouse interface.<p>

<a href="ami/wbm">WBM utility</a> was compiled for 68000 and requires only 2.0 OS.  If you
don't use wheel(s) - you can use controller even under 1.x OS.  Controller succesfully
works under Linux and any other operating systems on Amiga hardware - not only AmigaOS.
If you want - you even can write wheel support to any OS.  All details can be found in <a
href="ami/wbm.c">WBM source code</a>.<p>

<center><a name="scala">
<img src="scala.png" width="609" height="36" alt="SCALA Screen Bar"></center><p>
There is some small problem with Scala: because of
<a href="adv_detail.html#joystick">parallel joystick feature</a> and usage of fire0 at
mouse port for custom Scala hardware, PS/2 controller will be disabled after start of
Scala.  It is not a noticeable problem - you can enable it again by one mouse click.  If
it disturbs you - my PS/2 controller (<font color="ffffff">from version 1.5</font>) has
special feature: <font color="ffffff"> if you will hold right mouse button pressed during
start of Scala, <a href="adv_detail.html#joystick">parallel joystick feature</a> will be
disabled during all following session of your work.</font> If you want enable it again,
for game as example, you can switch power off/on, or simply disconnect/reconnect mouse.
