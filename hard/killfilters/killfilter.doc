>>> FILTERFIX FOR ALL AMIGAS

Are you one of those persons that hear music using the amiga
frequently? Do you have your amiga connected to expensive
hifi-equipment?

Then you WILL hate the lowpass-filter,built into all amigas.
Hearing music with the filter turned on simply sounds terrible.
There is one easy step to do if you want to have the filter
turned off forever (no longer depending on the led's state).

>>> HOW TO DO

Simply remove a transistor from your Amigas mainboard.
If it is mounted using SMD (that means the resistor is
only 2-3 millimeters big and directry soldered to the
mainboard's surface) you have to use a eletronic solder-
iron (that means earthed),otherwise you can simply
cut it off.

Do this only if you have at least some experience in
soldering! Note that SMD-Parts are usually glued to
the mainboard.

To know what transistor to remove,simply look up your
amiga-model in the table below and search for the
transistor on the mainboard that has the right number.
Then remove it.

AMIGA   TRANSISTOR NUMBER
-----   -----------------
A500    Q301
A500+   Q301
A2000   Q202
CDTV    Q4
A600    Q341
A1200   Q341
A4000   Q400

>>> TECHNICAL INFO

The transistor is usually a 2N3905/06 or BC556/727 and is
located somewhere around an IC named LF347.If you dant
want to fully remove the transistor,just isolate one pin.
