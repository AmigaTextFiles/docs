 Remember the above header and how I basically told you how you could build your
own SCSI tower out of a PC case and drives?  Well, I got several responses from
you and because of this, I feel that a more detailed text was needed. So I've
updated this text and added new sections.  Please read on....

               $VER: SCSI Tower V2.0 (Written by Anthony Keeley)

 Adding extra externally mounted drives to your system is one of the easiest
things to do, and it doesn't have to cost the high prices charged for simply
putting the bits together: and when I say easy I mean EASY!  If you can use a
screwdriver and push connectors together, then you can build yourself a SCSI
Tower.

 Also, at the end of this text is some information on installing an external
floppy drive into the tower (you'll require a working external DF1:): and some
useful information on how to power your Amiga from the tower.

 For a start, I'd like to thank a good friend from his electrical abilities, for
installing the power connector into the PSU: and for doing the laborious job of
soldering all those wires to make up a 23 way straight through cable (46 pins).

 Secondly, Dave Collingwood in believing that the original SCSITower text was
good enough to include in his `DCA1200T.lha' file.  Thanks for the compliment!
(Does that keyboard hack work with the Amiga Technologies A1200?)

 And.. to those of you who kept my brain ticking over by sending me questions
about SCSI drives and the numerous faults that people can come up against:
but SCSI's are still easier than IDE's :)

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  An Amiga.  Whilst this document can be used by PC & MAC people, the software
             referred to is Amiga only.  PC & MAC users will have to refer to
             your own manuals on how to set up the drives etc.

  A SCSI Controller with an external SCSI Port.

  External SCSI Drive(s) and/or SCSI CD-Rom Drive (both is better :)

  1 x PC Case.  (Shape and size dependant on your requirements/cash)

  1 x SCSI ribbon cable.  A pre-made ribbon with 7 x 50 pin connectors on.
      (with connectors)   Preferably with an 8th connector This 8th connector
                          should really be a Centronics 50 way female connector.

  1 x 25 D-type female connector to a 50 way Centronics male connector.

  If you're using the Squirrel SCSI interface (A1200 & A600) you don't want the
  last cable (25-50), as the Squirrel is already fitted with the correct type of
  connector. But you may want a 50 way male centronics to 50 way female
  centronics extension cable, as the Squirrel cable is very short (.5m long).


Tower and Desktop Cases:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 PC cases come in all shapes, sizes and shades of grey and cream:  and depending
on your needs and desk space will be which box you finally purchase: a FULL,
MIDI, MINI tower or DESKTOP case (and which one your cash flow allows).  The
`desktop' boxes and `mini' towers usually cost roughly between £30 - £40 (check
out the ads in MicroMart 80p). `Midi' towers range from £40 - £60, and `full'
towers from £50 - £100.

 Desktop   3 x 3.5   1 x 5.25   200 + watt PSU   These are only a guide to the
 MINI      4 x 3.5   2 x 5.25   200 +   "   "    drive storage of a case, it
 MIDI      5 x 3.5   3 x 5.25   200 +   "   "    may vary. Check with the
 FULL      5 x 3.5   4 x 5.25   200 +   "   "    vendor before purchasing!

Note:  The FULL tower can hold more drives than the SCSI controller can use.

 If you have a spare 3.5 drive space you could always install an external floppy
in it as DF1:  and power that also from the tower (How to install a DF1:  is
documented at the end of this SCSI text).

 Buying a tower/desktop case will only be affected by how many drives you want
to install into it.  If you decide that you'll be simply fitting 2 x 3.5 SCSI
hard drives and a single CD-rom drive, then the cheaper mini tower or the desk
top case will be ample.  If you want to install 2 x CD-rom drives, 1 x 5.25 SCSI
hard drive, and 2 x 3.5 SCSI hard drives, then the minimum you'll need is the
midi tower, as neither the mini or desktop has enough 5.25 drive bays to
accommodate your designs.

 As to the wattage of the built-in PSU, forget it.  New standard PC case comes
with a 200 watt psu minimum:  some have even higher rating:  some even weigh in
at a tidy 350 watt.  Consider that the A500 came with a massive 60 watt psu and
the (Amiga Technologies) A1200 comes with an even greater 25 watt psu, then a
200 watt psu is going to be ample to drive 7 SCSI devices, 1 floppy drive and an
Amiga 500/+, 600, 1200.  For those who've got the big box machines, you have
even less power problems.


SCSI Drives:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Hard drives come in various sizes, 5.25" FH (Full Height. You'd know one as
soon as you see it - 3") and HH (Half Height - 1.5"): whilst the 3.5" come in
HH, 1", and Slimline.  Quantum produce a drive called a BIGFOOT, which I've seen
in IDE form, but not yet in SCSI form. But that doesn't mean they aren't made in
SCSI.  A Bigfoot is a 5.25" slimline and is very large capacity drive - Gb's.
Each of the above drives will take up 1 drive bay except a FH (full height)
drive will take up 2 drive bays.  As for CD-rom drives, they come in 2 sizes.
Yes, 2 sizes, both 5.25":- a 1.5" drive (normal size) and 1" (laptop size).

 The type of SCSI connector on the drive is very important, and they do come in
differing guises.  The standard SCSI 50 pin connector, the IBM edge connector.
The condensed 50 pin SCSI 2 connector, and the various other connectors for SCSI.
The type of connector we'll be using is the standard 50 pin connector as shown
here.

    ------------------------~~~--------------------------  
 49 | o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o | 1 
 50 | o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o | 2
    -----------------------------------------------------

 If the drive you plan on buying doesn't have this type of connector, then don't
buy it, as it wouldn't fit onto that nice ribbon cable you bought earlier.


SCSI Controllers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The various Amigas could have a number of SCSI controllers. Even the small box
machines (A500/+, A600/A1200) could have several different controllers. And as
for the big box machines the choice is even greater!  Listed here are just some
that each of the machines could use. It is not a complete list and personally I
don't think any single person could compile a comprehensive list that covers
everything.

  Machine     Controllers      Device driver        Supplied software

  A1000       A590             scsi.device          HDToolBox *

  A500/+      A590             scsi.device          HDToolBox
              GVP HD8 II+      gvpscsi.device       Faaastprep

  A600        SquirrelSCSI 
              Surf Squirrel    squirrelscsi.device  HDToolBox

  A1200       Same As A600
              Accelerator boards such as the Blizzard, Apollo, Falcon
              etc all take a SCSI controller each having their own type
              of device driver.

  Big Boxes   A2090/1          scsi.device          HDToolBox
  A1500/2000  GVP HC 8         gvpscsi.device       Faaastprep
  A2500/3000^ And any other Zorro II scsi controller...
  A4000/4000T 

  Big Boxes   All Zorro II scsi controllers...
  A3000/4000  A4091            scsi.device          HDToolBox
              And any other Zorro III scsi controller

 *  The A1000 could have the A590 attached on the right hand expansion port
    at the side, but the A590 was facing to the back of the unit.

 ^  The A3000 came with a built-in scsi controller, & I'm led to believe that
    the controller's SCSI ID is actually `0' and not `7' like most of the
    other controllers. But I'm also told that this can be changed using the
    built-in software.


Putting it Together:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The Tower or Desktop case you buy will most probably have the PSU disconnected
from power switch at the front: and this will be a four (4) connection affair.
Simply follow the connection diagram on the PSU for connecting the wires up..

 Before you start putting anything into the case, check that the SCSI ID's of
each of your drives that you intend to connect, including any drives that you
already have connected, do not match with another drive that will be on the same
controller. If you already have a SCSI controller in use and plan on extending
it into the PC case, `HDTooBox' will list all the drives on that particular
controller.  WRITE THEM DOWN, BEFORE YOU SWITCH OFF!

 With all the internal drives I've seen, ID's have to be changed using jumpers
either next to the SCSI connector (CD drives), or on the circuit board (hard
drives).  Referring to the manual/A4 sheet that came with the drive (you did get
one didn't you?) will tell you where the jumpers are and how to set each ID
correctly.

 AND....  for those of you who, like me, bought their drives second hand without
instructions....

 SCSI ID jumpers come in a set of three lots of 2 pins. They can be anywhere and
they can be part of a row of other jumpers. But there are clues as to where they
are:  as is the case with Quantums which have a row of six jumpers. And the ones
marked A0, A1, A2 are for the SCSI ID, whilst the other three have other uses,
such as PARITY etc.

 Ok, you've located the ID jumpers and want to work out how to change them to a
particular ID.  The following chart will show you which jumper has to be open
(Not Connected) and which has to be closed (Connected) to get the correct ID.

We'll use Quantums marking for this chart..

   
   \ ID      0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7
    \
Jump \

   A0        O    C    O    C    O    C    O    C     O = Take the Jumper Off

   A1        O    O    C    C    O    O    C    C     C = Put a Jumper On
     
   A2        O    O    O    O    C    C    C    C

(ID 7 has been listed for those who have a controller whose ID is `0')

Getting the SCSI ID's correct is half the battle won. The other half comes in
various shapes and forms which I'll tackle later.

 Change the ID on the drive(s) so there are no matching ID's.  The controller is
usually ID 7 so don't use that.  The drive that came with the controller
originally (if it came fitted) should be ID 0.  (See later about changing ID's)

 Most CD-rom drives come set as ID 2 or 3. Change these to the highest ID that
is available. This depends on the controller's ID and how many CD-rom drives
you plan on connecting to your system.

 Open your PC case and install the drive(s) into the appropriate drive bays, not
forgetting to connect the power connectors.  Both the SCSI and Power connectors
will only fit in one way due to their design, so DO NOT FORCE them in.

 With Tower Cases, the fastening screws are provided and you should use four
screws for each drive installed.  Desktop cases can vary on how drives are
installed, so check before you buy that you'll have everything provided in the
initial purchase.

 Get your internal SCSI cable and connect it to the drives.  Common sense will
tell you how to connect the drives to the cable.  If you can't manage this, I'd
give up and find someone who knows.

 Before closing the case, you'll have to determine how to get the connector to
the outside of the case so you can make the connection to the controller.

 With Towers, the ribbon cable can sit between the outer casing and the frame of
the tower.  Or, both the tower and desktop cases have a section for expansion
cards to be fastened to.  Most should be removable, so you can put the ribbon
cable under the frame to the outside world.  DON'T refasten the screws too tight
near the cable.  Another option would be to dismantle the connector, pass the
ribbon through one of the back plate openings and rebuild the connector!  This
last option is NOT recommended.
 
 Finally, you can now connect the external scsi port on your controller to the
connector at the back of your case using the 25 to 50 way cable.  The Squirrel's
connector should connect directly to the connector at the back of the PC casing
without a problem.

 Don't put the casing back on yet, but first boot up your Amiga and watch and
listen very closely.  Your machine will take some time to boot the first time
due to the drives not being set up under AmigaDos, and the controller trying to
determine what on earth a CD drive is and why it wasn't told about it.

    OR

 YOUR MACHINE DOESN'T LIKE YOU ANY MORE AND THINGS DON'T WORK AS PLANNED!

FAQ:
~~~~
 What is FAQ, well FAQ stands for `F'requently `A'sked `Q'uestions. Personally
I prefer the more accurate `Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!  WHY DOESN'T IT WORK...!'

 Problem :  Your machine simply won't boot...

  Cure 1 :  Switch on the PC case

  Cure 2 :  You've managed to allocate a drive ID the same as your boot drive.

  Cure 3 :  A termination problem (see later - Termination)

Uncure 1 :  The drive's logic card has such a big clash with the controller that
            they both refuse to work, and the machine fails to boot.

    OR

 Problem :  Your machine boots but HDToolBox doesn't see the added drives...

  Cure 1 :  Switch on the PC case.

  Cure 2 :  SCSI Cable not connected.

  Cure 3 :  Wrong SCSI device set in HDToolBox's Icon.

  Cure 4 :  SCSI ID set to the same as another drive (not the boot drive).

  Cure 5 :  A termination problem (see later - Termination).

  Cure 6 :  The Block size on the drive has been set to 1024 (usually 512).
            Later versions of HDToolBox could handle 1024 byte blocks. OR
            Get a PC user to reformat the drive with 512 byte blocks 

Uncure 1 :  The drive added is a non-worker.

Uncure 2 :  The drive added won't work with your controller.

    OR

 Problem :  Your machine displays a purple screen with a floppy being inserted
            into a floppy drive.....

  Cure 1 :  Switch on the PC case.

  Cure 2 :  SCSI Controller not connected to Amiga.

  Cure 3 :  Possible loose SCSI connector, or Power connector.
            I've only ever suffered this problem once, and the first thing I
            did was to check the connections and try again: the machine booted.

  Cure 4 :  A possible termination problem (see later - Termination)

   OR

 Any or all of the above problems can be caused by the ribbon cable being ripped
where it joins the actual metal pins inside the connector.  If you suspect you
have got a ripped cable, then you can try one of two things to find out.
Firstly you can take a multimeter and test each and every even numbered
connector pib: or if you have a spare connector which sits inline before the
suspected connector, connect your drive to this one, remove any drives after the
suspected one, and switch on to see if this has cured your problem!

 So you've managed to boot up, and HDToolBox has found the added drives but says
they are UNKNOWN.  Brilliant!  Exactly where you should be (unless they were
already used on another Amiga, in which case HDToolBox should say they are
CHANGED).

 Using HDToolBox click on the UNKNOWN drive and then select 'Change Drive Type'.
Now select 'Define New':  select 'Read Configuration' and the boxes should fill
with the information required by HDToolbox to work with this drive.  Select OK,
and then 'Save Changes to Drive'.  If you want to partition the drive, away you
go and divide the drive up into as many pieces as you want by selecting
'Partition Drive'.  Repeat this process for all UNKNOWN Drives.

 Quitting from HDToolBox will force a reset, but this is so the system gets to
recognise the new drives.

 For the CD-Drive, you'll have you use one of the CD filesystems provided; such
as Xetec, AsimCDFS, AmiCDFS. Or you could simple use CBM's dos driver (if you
have Workbench 3.1).  If you do use CBM's Dos driver, remember to change the
device and SCSI ID in the tool types of the icon to match the correct device
driver and SCSI ID.

 One final reset and everything should be working ok.  But your boot up will
take longer because of the added drive(s).

CD Hints:
~~~~~~~~~
 1.  Don't put your CD Dos driver into the DEVS:DOSDRIVERS drawer.  Put it into
     SYS:STORAGE/DOSDRIVERS, this will allow you a faster boot up:  and if you
     need the CD, you can simply double click on the icon.

 2.  If you do have your CD dos driver in DEVS:DOSDRIVERS, put an Amiga CD in.
     This will help reduce the boot up time.

Termination:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I would like to quote a passage from a FAQ text on the SCSI standard about
termination and how it works. Then I'll tell you how I work with the SCSI
termination (or how this standard does NOT work as it should).

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

There is a simple 'guideline' (see below) to termination:

   No matter what (1Drive, 2Drives, 3Drives/2Cards), only the devices
   at both ENDS of the SCSI chain are to be terminated, all the rest
   are not!  Here are a few examples, terminate the [ENDS] ONLY!

    [END]Controller-----Device[END]

    [END]Controller-----Device-----Device[END]

DO TAKE ANY CHANCE AND TERMINATE THE BUS PROPERLY EVEN IF IT MEANS UNSOLDERING
THE TERMINATORS ON THE CONTROLLER!

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 Errr Yes!  Thats how the Termination standard should be implemented and if it
works for you, DON'T change anything, BUT....

SCSI termination is a very BLACK art, and for a very good reason!

SCSI termination works on the principle that both ends of the chain should be
terminated to stop signal echo's.  A simple example would be as in example 1

  Terminated              Terminated
 --------------          --------------
 | Controller |----------| Hard drive |
 --------------          --------------

But if you add a second drive, example 2 should be the result.

  Terminated              Unterminated              Terminated
 --------------          --------------          --------------
 | Controller |----------| Hard drive |----------| Hard drive |
 --------------          --------------          --------------

 Sadly, as the chain gets further from the controller, Termination "rules" seem
to go out of the proverbial window.  Looking at my present setup (I've only got
the one tower now, with 2 CD-rom drives and 3 Hard drives) which uses a
non-standard termination sequence with the Classic Squirrel:

   Terminated         terminated       Unterminated       Unterminated  
  --------------    --------------    ---------------    ---------------
  | Controller |----| Hard drive |----| CDRom drive |----| CDRom drive |--\
  --------------    --------------    ---------------    ---------------   |
   ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^                                                           | 
  I believe the Squirrel has            terminated *       Unterminated    | 
  Termination Set.                     --------------     --------------   |
                                       | Hard drive |-----| Hard drive |--/
  * This last drive has powered        --------------     --------------   
    termination on it.

 The first hard drive in the chain simply refused to work until the terminator
packs had been re-installed into the drive.  Whilst both CD-rom drives and the
2nd hard drive all refused to work whilst termination was present on them.  As
for the last hard drive, I've no way of turning the termination on or off and I
don't plan on finding out because it works quite happily without me fiddling.

 I did have two towers before and their setups were as shown..

Tower1:

   Unterminated      Terminated        Unterminated       Terminated
  --------------    --------------    ---------------    --------------
  | Hard drive |----| Controller |----| CDRom drive |----| Hard drive |--\
  --------------    --------------    ---------------    --------------   |
                                                                          |
                                        Unterminated      Unterminated    |
                                       --------------    --------------   |
                                       | Hard drive |----| Hard drive |--/
                                       --------------    --------------

Tower2:

   Terminated        Unterminated       Unterminated
  --------------    ---------------    --------------
  | Controller |----| CDRom drive |----| Hard drive |--\
  --------------    ---------------    --------------   |
                                                        |
                      Unterminated      Unterminated    |
                     --------------    --------------   |
                     | Hard drive |----| Hard drive |--/
                     --------------    --------------

 I'll leave you to decide which is true of SCSI Termination: the Standard (ends
only termination) or the Black Art Method. IF IT WORKS, DON'T FIX IT!

Not Building Cables:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I'm not going to tell how to build a cable for this project, but I can show you
the connector types, and the pinouts to make up a 25 way to 50 way connector.

 SCSI ribbons have 50 wires. Wire 1 is the cable marked with a secondary colour
such as a red or blue stripe down the side.  Be careful not to purchase security
ribbon as this isn't flexible enough to be used.


 D type 25 pin connector
    _____________________________
 13 \ o o o o o o o o o o o o o / 1
 25  \ o o o o o o o o o o o o /  14
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 This D type connector was used by Apple, but seems to be taken on as a standard
for external connectors for SCSI expansion.


 Internal IDC 50 pin SCSI connector      

    ------------------------~~~--------------------------  
 49 | o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o | 1 
 50 | o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o | 2
    -----------------------------------------------------

  All odd pins are on one row, all the even are on the other.

  Making up a ribbon cable using these header blocks allows you to set the
connectors to exactly the correct spacing you need.  Sadly, adding one of these
connectors without the proper tools can leave you suffering from ripped cables,
bad connections, and a lot of headaches when it comes to booting up.  I've only
managed to get 2 out of 7 connected correctly, and I still have some suspicions
about them.


 Centronics 50 pin connector
    _________________________________
  1 \                               / 25       This connector is roughly the

  26  \___________________________/   50       internal 50 pin connector.


Not Making That Cable:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Most SCSI drives connect via the IDC 50 pin connector, unless the drive has
higher specifications such as SCSI WIDE, DIFFERENTIAL etc, but the ones that use
the IDC connector all stick to the pin assignments listed below.  You may notice
that none of the odd numbered pins are mentioned on the 50 way side. That's due
to them all being GROUNDs and have no need to be connected.  The pin-out below
shows you which wires to connect to which pin, to allow you to connect it to
your controller.

* note:  Pin 26 is labelled either TERMPWR or N/C (Not Connected) in my manual.
   I have connected this, and have suffered no problems (yet!).  I suggest that
   you should connect this, as one of the drives you fit may need Terminator
   power and you may experience problems getting your drive(s) to work if not.
   Drives without powered termination wont be affected by this being connected.

Installing a DF1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I'm not going to start telling you how to technically connect up a floppy drive
to work as DF1:  You can work that out for yourselves by examining the pin
assignments listed below. These are listed in the A500 user manual in the
`Technical Reference' section.

 If you have an external floppy drive and would like to install that into the
tower then read on.  Oh yes, before I forget, you will have to make up a
connecting cable to act as an extension between the drive's old cable and the
computer.  This uses 2 x 23 (twenty-three) pin connectors (1 x male, 1 x
female), 25 core cable and 2 x D type socket enclosures (sheaths).

Solder the pins straight through...  (or get someone to make it up for you)

 You'll have to open the casing on the drive, and this is usually a plastic or
metal casing (can't be much else :)) and they'll either fasten together with 4
screws (metal) or simply snap together (plastic).  Once you get the casing open
you should see a small circuit board at the back which allows detection of other
drives, and thus gives DF2:  DF3:  etc depending on how many external drives you
have. This will be connected between the cable and the floppy drive. Be careful
handling this.  Unscrew the drive from the casing and DON'T lose the screws for
you'll use these to fasten the drive into the tower.

 Dismantle the plastic casing on the connector which connects the drive to the
computer, and attach this to an opening on the back of the PC case.  It will
probably have a plate spot-welded in 2 places covering the gap: this is easily
removed.  Connect the old connector to the metalwork, and install the drive,
remembering to remove the blanking plate at the front first.  If you want to
power the drive directly from the PC case PSU then you'll have to either
desolder the old power connector from the circuit board (e.g.  Cumana 354) or
snip it off. Otherwise simply leave it on and power the drive from the computer.
 
 With the cables connected switch on, and DF1:  should be visible to the system.
Don't panic if you don't at first see an icon, you may not have a floppy disk
in the drive.

 Ok..  you want to power you A500/+, A600, A1200 from the psu that comes with
the PC case, and this is simple - IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR, YOU KNOW
HOW TO SOLDER, HOW TO USE A MULTI-TESTMETER, AND CAN AFFORD TO BLOW UP YOUR
COMPUTER IF YOU GET IT WRONG.  Want to carry on? Then read on.

Before starting, unplug the Amiga's PSU from the computer and switch it on.
Using the multi-meter test each of the pins for voltages and write them down on
PAPER!


1.  Open up the PSU from the PC Case. Check that it supplies -12v
    (I have been told that some psu's don't)

1a. Remove the Amiga's PSU from it's plastic casing. 

2.  Desolder the Amiga's power cable from the circuit board.

3.  Locate the 2 power connectors which supply a PC motherboard with its power.
    They're 2 connectors with 6 wires on each: desolder these.

4.  Now Solder the respective power wires of the Amiga's cable to the PSU board.

5.  Before reassembling, check that the voltages are correct.

6.  Reassemble, PRAY, switch on, pray again!

 What!  You don't have the pin-outs for the Amiga's PSU? Oh ok!  This diagram is
a direct copy from the casing which houses the PSU for the A500/+. I have sat on
the table next to the A1200 (powered by the tower I use) which I've used to type
this on.

   |  o 1  2 o  |      2  =  0 volt     (Black Wire)

 For this Part I got a friend to do the work, and he knew exactly what he was
doing, why he was doing it, and how to do it: and I had complete faith in him.
I'll repeat myself here and say - IF YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST UNCERTAINTY ABOUT
THIS, FIND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING AND GET THEM TO DO IT!

Getting In Touch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This is an update to the original SCSITower.txt, which I got several requests
for help from: and I tried my best to help them, and I believe I was quite
successful in all cases.  If you would like help with any of the above, please
include as much information as possible, as it can take several weeks getting
mail backwards and forwards, and I don't login every day to check my mail.  So
the more info, the quicker I can possibly help!

 Remember to include:

    Which - Computer you've got
          - SCSI Controller
     What - drives your using (and sizes)
          - your trying to do
          - you did do
          - connections you've made               
      
     And..

    Exactly what the problem is and what you've done to try and cure it..

 I'm sure there are SCSI experts out there who are screaming in agony over my
methods of SCSI TERMINATION.  And there'll be the odd one or two who'll say I'm
talking rubbish.  All I'll say is if you don't like it, don't read it!

 If you want to send me any advice or info, I'll be glad to read and learn from
your wisdom.

 If you have to send me abuse, I can quite happily delete those messages faster
than you can write them.

 Here's my contact address..

  Anthony Keeley (My name, just in case you'd like to use it)

  Snoopy@mail.on-line.co.uk (my email address, if you hadn't guessed)

 I look into my mailbox occasionally, so you should get an answer within a week
depending on how difficult it is to answer and how much info you provided.

Anthony...
