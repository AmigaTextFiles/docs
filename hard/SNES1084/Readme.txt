This document is for Super Nintendo (PAL or NTSC) and Commodore 1084 PAL
users.


In the early 1995 my brother bought an american Super Nintendo.  It was
NTSC but we in Italy use the PAL TV Standard (as others European
countries).
Unfortunatly we don't own a Multistandard TV (PAL/NTSC) and so, connecting
the Super Nintendo (SNES) to our two TV's via the standard SCART cable or
the RF (antenna) output we got only images without sync (rolling) or Black
& White images.

This was due to differences between NTSC and PAL standards... :-(

Since the SNES video connector is an "unknow standard", I had to use the
provided SCART connector for my experiments. I tried to get a CVBS
(composite) signal out from the SCART, but connecting it to a CVBS monitor
(like the Commodore 1084), I got only Black & White images (this because
the PAL 1084 monitor did'nt found the color datas from the NTSC signal).

So I asked about this to a my friend employed at the best Commodore Service
here in Rome, and he suggested me to take out from the SCART the RGB
signals and use an analog RGB monitor (like the Commodore 1084).
Unfortunatly the SCART doesn't have Sync signals (horizontal & vertical),
so I had to take out the Composite Sync signal from the CVBS pin (it is
very easy, and there's no problems between NTSC & PAL).

I can't found any SuperNes hardware documents in the world, so I decided
to write this document to help the other Super Nintendo owners that want to
use an RGB Video-Monitor (like the Commodore 1084).


Unfortunatly you can't connect Super Nintendo to all the 1084 monitors:

Your Commodore 1084 (or 1084S if it is stereo) have to own a 9 pin SUB-D
connector.  Read the label on the rear of your monitor, if it says:  "TYPE
1084-D1" you should have the 9-pin connector, if it says "TYPE 1084-P" you
should have only a couple of round DIN connectors, and you should'nt to be
able to use them (though this is not 100% sure...).

If your 1084 have a SCART connector (some 1084's have it!) simply connect
the Nintendo SCART cable to it!

If your monitor has a 9-pin SUB-D connector, look at the SNES1084.IFF or
SNES1084.GIF file, build your cable and enjoy.

If your monitor has only a couple of round DIN connectors, take you user
manual, read the ANALOG RGB DIN CONNECTOR specifications and try to build a
SCART to DIN cable, connecting the SCART CVBS to the DIN H-SYNC or to the
DIN V-SYNC or both, the SCART GND to the DIN GND and the three SCART
components (R, G and B) to the three DIN components.  Don't worry, you
can't damage your 1084 or your Nintendo.  If you'll see only a un-sync'ed
image, I'm sorry, you can't use your monitor!  If your cable works
properly, let me know, I'll update this documents to support the DIN
connectors too!

If you don't have the ANALOG RGB DIN CONNECTOR specifications I can send it
to you. Just send me an InterNet email or a FidoNet Matrix.


If you own a Philips CM-8833 monitor, it has a SCART port, connect the
Nintendo SCART connector to it.

If you own a Philips CM-8833-II, it has a 9-PIN D-SUB (just like the
1084-D1), so you can use the "SNES to 1084" cable properly.

Reader: if you have any tech document (hardware or software) about Super
Nintendo, please send it to me, or let me know where can I found it! I like
Video related documents too (CVBS, RGB, PAL, NTSC...).  Thank you.
