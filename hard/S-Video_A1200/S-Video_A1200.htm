      <H1></H1>This circuit is not my idea but has been taken from CD32 design. 
      By the way, that's pretty strange why this never went into regular 
      production for the other models?<BR>At the bottom of window you can see a 
      piece of the CD32 mainboard enclosed in the metal case - this has been built 
      for A500 as the standalone PAL encoder. 
      <H2>Overview</H2>
      <P>Actually, there are three phases to achieve finally composite signal. 
      1. RGB &gt;&gt; YUV. 2. YUV &gt;&gt; YC. 3. YC &gt;&gt; Composite. If the 
      last phase known as YC mix process will omit a black and white 
      information which is most responsible for quality will have "more space" 
      in a separate wire. This is because PAL/NTSC systems have limited video 
      bandwidth to about 4-6MHz and if a B&amp;W info (commonly referred as  
      lumination or Y) is mix together with a coded color info (commonly referred as   
      chromination or C) then they must share the bandwidth and in the effect 
      there are some visible degradations on the final picture.<BR>Another thing 
      is poor delay line used in the A1200/A600 designs that makes only worse, 
      too. The S-Video signal is formed right after the RGB matrix and color 
      coding process from the pins 15 and 16 - see the functional block diagram. 
      Such a way saves more upper band frequencies and picture remain still 
      sharp. With this circuit a separate YC video bands look much better than the 
      Composite video and they are even comparable to the source RGB component.

      <P>There's one more interesting thing about CXA1145 - It has RGB outs. A few additional 
      discrete parts can be video 
      sources at the same time as all the others outputs. However, in A1200/A600 
      it's sensless because of the direct RGB output stage from 
      DACs.</P><BR><BR><IMG height=457 alt=""

      <H2>Principles</H2>
      <H3></H3>
      <UL>
        <LI>all needed signals can be found on CXA1145 (U12) pins - see the pic 
        <LI>no software needed 
        <LI>no need any regulations<BR></LI></UL>
      <H2>Implementation</H2>
      <P>For the best results all parts should be smd. The 75ohm resistors (1% 
      metal-film are recommended) should be located as close as possible to the 
      capacitors to minimize noise pickup and reflections caused by impedance 
      mismatch. The 100uF capacitor should be a tantalum type or a low 
      inductance electrolytic type for good and stable frequency response as well 
      the 1nF cap should be a ceramic smd rather than any other type.   
      S-video socket should be connected by the 75ohm wires and the traces 
      between bases T1, T2 and the CXA1145 pins should be kept as short as 
      possible for maximum performance.<BR>One more tip to add... as you can see on 
      the circuit diagram, there's no low post filter for EMI protection. 
      The reference circuit from CD32 had this anyway, but it has been omited 
      for best quality in this solution, again.<BR>Btw the same LPF is mounted in 
      A1200/A600 for RGB and Composite video. You can freely remove them.
      The LPF LC parts in the A1200 have the following marks: E258R, E259R, E260R and E263R - 
      these are ferrite beads, after remove simply short remaining places by a 
      solder, but the capacitors which are: E258C, E259C, E260C, E231C - only remove 
      and do nothing more.<BR>Also note that the original RF modulator must 
      be removed for additional connector. </P><BR><IMG height=487 alt=""

      <P>Here are the video frames captured and saved with lossless compresion for 
      objective compare from both Composite and S-Video outputs. The differences 
      can be easily visible because quality of sharpness and color reproduction is 
      somewhat different. These frame grabs were taken from A500 and the standalone 
      PAL encoder, so.. this is not the best result, especially when encoder 
      wasn't made with the highest quality parts... Unfortunately, my old A1200 have 
      damage sync line and this is all I could put on this page. </P>Composite 
      B&amp;W: visible loss of luma bandwidth (horizontal resolution), 
      there's less details and the subsequent loss of sharpness<BR><IMG
