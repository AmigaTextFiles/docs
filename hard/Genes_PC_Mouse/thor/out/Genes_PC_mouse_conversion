Gene Hesketts notes on making a _cheap_ PC mouse work on the Amiga.

Preface:

If this modifcation causes a divorce, or warts, or your dog bites the
postman again, or your Amiga goes up in copious clouds of smoke, I am not
responsible.  This is 100% your baby!

I am going to assume that you are familiar with modern soldering technics,
and not belabor the choice of irons and tools to use.  Simply said, if you
weren't born with a hot soldering iron in one hand, then this is NOT a
project for you.  I've been doing this stuff for a living since the late
40's, so I guess that makes me a genuine old fart!

1. Get the generic, approximately $15 at Office Max, Logitek DeXxa 3 button
serial mouse, model #3B MSE 930265-00 or its el cheepo replacement.  I have
found from about 3 years use of this mouse, that its usually quite smooth
in operation, requireing considerably less cleaning and tweeking to keep it
moving accurately.

2. On your way back from Office Max or ???, stop in at Toys R US, and get a
9 pin gamepad extension cord, the one I just got was a 7 footer and cost
about $3.50 or so.

3. Open up the mouse, and remove the cable plug from the board, tossing
that cable in your "spares for pc's" box as it doesn't have near enough
wires in it to work on an Amiga, which if you are gonna use all 3 buttons,
takes all 9 pins in the plug.

4. Remove the socket where that cable was plugged in.

5. Clipping the legs very close to the board, remove the 16 pin integrated
circuit, and clean the holes out because 7 or the wires in the gamepad
cable will be inserted into the holes the IC's pins vacated.

6. Remove the chip resistor marked '470', located between the IC's 8 and
9th pin, and which is on a pad connected to pin 10 of the IC on one end,
and to a runner that hits the minus pin of LD1 on the other.  This is the
current limiting resistor for the infrared leds that drive the motion
detectors, and at 47 ohms, would smoke them quickly.

7. Form and clip the leads of a 680 ohm, 1/4 or 1/8th watt resistor so that
it will lay on the bottom of the board neatly and solder to the pads
vacated by the chip resistor removed in 6 above.

8. Using a short (1.5") piece of wrapping wire, connect trace that runs
around the outside edge of the board using the outside hole of the cable
sockets pattern on the board, over to the gap between the switches and to
the bottom of the board, wrapping it around the negative lead of the small
electrolytic 'c1', and taking it back thru the gap between the switches
back to the top side of the board and to the hole where pin 9 of the IC
was.  Solder the wire where its wrapped around that bit of cap lead
sticking out of the bottom of the board.

9. Now, cut the male end of the gamepad cable off a few inches from the
plug, and remove about an inch of its outer jacket.

10. Verify that the black wire in the gamepad cable is indeed connected to
pin 8 of the female end of this cable.  If pin 8 isn't black, then you will
have to make suitable corrections to the colors I will name along with the
pin it belongs to.  Pin 8 is the common ground for the system.  I will
state the color and the pin it belongs to like this: black(8) from now on.
I'll also assume you are soldering as we go.

11. Insert the black(8) wire into the hole in the pcb adjacent to the J1
marking where you removed the cable socket.

12. Insert the red(7) wire into the pcb hole where pin 13 of the IC was.
This is directly below the slender gap between the 'left' and 'middle'
switches.

13. Insert the yellow(5) wire into the IC's hole pattern at pin 11.

14. insert the white(1) wire into the IC's hole pattern at pin 8.

15. Insert the green(3) wire into the IC's hole pattern at pin 7.

16. Insert the blue(2) wire into the IC's hole pattern at pin 6.

17. Insert the brown(4) wire into the IC's hole pattern at pin 5.

18. Insert the grey(9) wire into the IC's hole patern at pin 3.

19. Insert the orange(6) wire into the IC's hole pattern at pin 2.

20. Double check everything.

21. Plug it into the second db9 on the machine, turn it on and measure the
voltage at the plus side of c1, using the minus side or the machines
grounded case as the point to place the black probe, which should be 5
volts plus or minus whatever your supplies 5 volt tolerance is.

22. Check the voltage from c1's negative terminal to the ends of the 680
ohm resistor installed clear back up at step 7.  You should find ground on
one end, and about 2.65 volts on the other.  This would indicate that there
is some current flowing thru the ir led's.

23. If these check out, mash the game cable down into the gap between the
middle and right switches so that its laying as the original but somewhat
smaller cable was. Set the pcb back into the bottom half of the shell and
mash the cable into the strain relief notches molded into it.  Press down
on the top of the shell enough to get the rear half into place.  Put the
screws in and tighten.  Then using a smaller jewellers screwdriver, reach
into the area under the outside buttons and press until the clips finally
catch to hold the front of the top shell on.  The larger size of the game
cable makes this a bit more difficult obviously.

24. Plug it in and check it out!

Background:

The average pc mouse sets new standards for being miserly with power.  It
turns out that not only does the typical mouse sleep 99% of the time unless
moving, it also strobes the ir leds at a high audio rate in order to get
enough light for the sensors without sucking the power way down.  Remember,
these things actuall run on the milliamp or so from a couple of the usual
rs-232 signal lines!

This modification sends a steady current thru the led's, wires the switches
for steady power which the amiga has plenty of, and send the photo detector
outputs directly to the amiga.  I experimented some with the led current,
and got good operation when the resistor was adjusted to the 1000 ohm end
of its range, a very miniscule (2.5 milliamps) amount of current for an led
I think since the two of them are in series with themselves and the changed
resistor across the 5 volt line now.  So I gave it about 3.5 mills and
called it good.  I can imagine that some mice's led's might need as low as
a 220 where the 680 I used goes.

25. This has been tried on 2 different A2k's both running ados 3.1.  This
machine, when running a swifty 3 button, has always been slow, making me
turn on MCX's mouse acceleration to 3 or 4.  Now its turned off and just
right.  On my office machine, its quite a bit faster.  As this is a
function of the conversion chips in the amiga, there isn't much I can do to
slow it down there, except take my old swifty to work!

27. Have fun folks!  Thats what this is all about.
