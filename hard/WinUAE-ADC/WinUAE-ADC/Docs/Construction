             An Analogue to Digital Converter project for WinUAE.
             ----------------------------------------------------

  Construction Information:-
  --------------------------

  There are NO absolute construction details as the prototype was made
  on perforated board with terminal pins, connected up using coloured wire.

  However here are a few pointers to make things easier:-

  1) Use different coloured wire to do different tasks, I used:-
     A) Red wire for the +5V supply rail.
     B) Black wire for the ground, (GND), circuits.
     C) White wire for the DATA out.
     D) Blue wire for the TRIGGER circuits.
     E) Yellow wire for circuit board timing circuits.
     F) Orange wire for analogue signal paths.
     G) Green wire for any other stuff.
  2) Build the ~TEST-ADC.IFF~ first, so that it can be tested in stages:-
     A) Do the 9 Way ~D~ Type SOCKET first with the coloured wires,
        Red to Pin 7, Black to Pin 8, Blue to Pin 9 and White to Pin 6.
        For WinUAE, construct the WinUAE adaptor cable as per the
        ~UAE-Cable~ file.
     B) Do the NE555 timer circuit next and thoroughly check that it is
        wired correctly, then power it up and check that it is oscillating
        at around 10-12Hz. If ALL is OK then carry on to Part C). If NOT
        Then recheck ALL of the construction work and try again.
     C) Do the divide by 10 counter circuit next and thoroughly check that
        it is wired correctly, then power it up and check that the
        TRIGGER line pulses about once a second. If ALL is OK then carry
        on to Part D). If NOT then recheck ALL of the construction work
        and try again.
     D) Do the Transistor ciruits and check the wiring again, power it up
        and check the TRIGGER line is working as before. Again if ALL is OK
        then carry on to Part E). If NOT then recheck ALL of the
        construction work and try again.
     E) Now finish off with the A-D Converter circuit and check the wiring
        again. If ALL is OK then you are ready to calibrate the finished
        item. If NOT then recheck ALL of the construction work and try
        again.
  3) You are now ready to test and calibrate the ADC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Testing and calibrating the ADC:-
  ---------------------------------

  1) For testing under WinUAE refer to the ~UAE-Cable~ file.
  2) For testing on a genuine AMIGA refer to the ~Info~ file.
  3) For calibrating for BOTH formats refer to the ~Info~ file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Final construction:-
  --------------------

  Now to modify the board to the ~UAE-ADC.IFF~ circuit diagram.

  Remove RVA from the circuit and fit RV1 and R10 as per the ~UAE-ADC~
  circuit ready for final calibration. Refer to the Voltmeter file for
  final calibration and you will now have a slow fully working A-D
  Converter.
