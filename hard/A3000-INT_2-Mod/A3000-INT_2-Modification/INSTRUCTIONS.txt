Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A4000D and T models have an interrupt line called _INT2 on the CPU (FAST) slot.
On the A4000, this slot is CN606 and the line is on pin 82. However, this pin
was not connected in the A3000D and A3000T, causing PPC and other 68k CPU
boards which use this line to not function correctly. Most CPU boards which
have onboard SCSI will require this modification to operate in the A3000D
and A3000T.

The modification simply involves connecting the INT_2 line to pin 82 of the
CPU slot, CN606. Electrically, the INT_2 signal is physically available in
several places, but the most convenient connection point is pin 19 of the
A3000D Zorro riser slot, CN600.

The details below apply specifically to the A3000D, though the same can be
applied to the A3000T, though the physical layout is different to that of
the A3000D. Electrically, this modification is the same on both D and T
models.



Parts and tools required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Approx 20cm of enamel "wire wrap" wire or small hook-up wire (0.2mm²)
- Electronics grade soldering iron and solder
- Small side-cutters
- #2 Philips screwdriver
- 1/4" hex nut driver
- 3/16" hex nut driver
- A multimeter or ohmmeter for testing
- Adhesive such as hot glue or araldite epoxy

- Some reasonable soldering ability



Disassembling the A3000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**************
* IMPORTANT! *
**************
Ensure you take all static electricity precautions while working inside the machine!
Ideally wear an anti-static wrist strap at a statically safe workstation.


- Remove the 4 beige screws around the outside of the case, and the silver screw
  in the top centre of the back panel.
  The case slides forward to remove it.

- Remove any expansion cards if fitted, and any blanking plates covering up the
  expansion slot holes.

- Remove the Zorro riser card by gently rocking it left and right while pulling
  directly upwards.

- Remove the centre plate assembly.  There is a screw by the power supply, one
  by the expansion slots, one at the top front of the case, one under the front of
  each floppy drive bay and one at the back of the inside plate under the hard drive.

- Lift out the centre plate assembly, taking care to unplug the main board power
  connector, ribbon cables for the SCSI hard drive and the floppy drive.

- Remove the 2 Philips screws holding down the main board, and the 4 x 1/4" hex
  mounting posts.

- Remove the 2 countersink Philips screws either side of the side connector plate.

- Remove the 12 x 3/16" hex retaining nuts from the rear D-range connectors.
  Note that the nuts on the 15 pin 30kHz monitor port are a different thread type,
  so don't mix them up.

- Unplug the front LED panel connector.

- Lift the front edge of the main board up and out of the lower case.

**************
Also check the real time clock battery for corrosion, or replace it if in doubt!



Performing the modification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turn the main board upside-down, and rotate it so the CPU slot CN606 is
nearest you.  Heat the end of the enamel wire to "tin" it with solder and connect
it to pin 82 of CN606 as detailed in the included photos and drawings.

Cut the wire to length so it reaches CN600 pin 19.  Tin the other end of the
enamel wire and solder it to CN600 pin 19.

Carefully inspect both solder joints to make sure the joint is secure and there are
no solder bridges/shorts.

Turn the main board right side up and check your work as detailed in the
"TestingCompletedJob" image, included in this archive.

Once checked, turn the board upside down and apply small drops of adhesive
along the length of the wire to hold it securely in place.

Reverse the disassembly instructions to reassemble the machine.

Take care to correctly fit the mylar insulator behind the Zorro riser card. 

Fit accelerator card and other expansions and test machine as required.



Questions and answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: Is the INT_2 modification necessary for all accelerators?
A: No, some will work without it.  Anything with a SCSI controller or a PPC
   will require it.  Some others may require it as well.

Q: Will it damage the computer/accelerator if the modification is done and the
   accelerator doesn't require it?
A: No.

Q: I've seen a modification similar to this on Aminet, but the wire connects to a 
   different point, is this the same thing?
A: Yes, it does exactly the same thing.  The connection points are electrically 
   the same.  I've used these points because it makes the job slightly tidier.

Q: The A3000 won't boot when turned on, I just get a yellow screen.
A: Fit the Zorro riser card, the machine won't operate correctly without it.

Q: It won't run with my new accelerator card.
A: Does the card in fact work at all?  Test it in an A4000 or known good machine.
   Make sure the two "clock source" jumpers are set correctly for your card.
   Does the card require OS 3.1 in ROM to operate?
   Remove the accelerator, all expansions and drives.  Make sure it powers up
   into the "insert disk" pre-boot screen.

Q: The accelerator runs OK, but its SCSI controller doesn't seem to work.
A: Did you properly check your job after the modification?

Q: The whole machine seems dead!  Only the power supply fan operates.
A: Did you plug in the main board power connector?

Q: I see signs of fuzzy corrosion on the RTC battery, what should I do?
A: Replace the battery immediately, or remove it from the main board at least.

Q: Where can I get a replacement battery?
A: Email me.

Q: Where can I get technical info on A3000s, and replacing batteries?
A: http://amiga.serveftp.net

Q: These instructions suck!!!  Where can I get something else?
A: Just after doing all this, I found instructions online at http://vgr.com/int2/
