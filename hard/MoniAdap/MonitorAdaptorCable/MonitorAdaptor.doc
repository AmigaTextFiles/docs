VGA-/ Multiscan-monitor-adaptor
===============================

This is a description to built a monitor adaptor / cable for all
monitors with RGB input (VGA and Multiscan monitors).
It's not a scan-doubler!
All parts are explained within the IFF-picture.
The adaptor is simultaneously to decouple the syncs and to avoid
vertical stripes on the screen.

- Use it when the amiga wont't start with the monitor connected
  (screen stays grey and the amiga [all models] restarts in an
  endless loop).
- Use it if you have vertical stripes on the screen although you
  own a high quality monitor [AGA models].


I put all parts in the plug at the amiga side, thus the new monitor
cable is simultaneously the adaptor.

The plugs inside with all parts and the cable(s) was fixed by
hot (melt-)adhesive.

The C-Mos TTL 74 HCT 08 is used because of the 50 Ohm output
impedance required at the sync lines (the RGB-lines are at 75 Ohm).
In the original Commodore adaptor is also a 74 HCT 08 used.

The decoupling of the syncs is necessery because the amiga isn't
able to drive the impedance of 50 Ohms and less of this value
correctly. This is recognizable when the amiga restarts in an
endless loop with the monitor connected and seems to be start
normaly without the monitor connected. Most monitors will still
work because they have an impedance over 50 Ohms at the sync
inputs. Then you don't need a decoupling of the syncs.

Pay attention to choose the right cables (impedances) e.g. if you
split into 5 lines after the plug at the amiga side to connect to
a BNC input at the monitor. (Three cable of 75 Ohm impedance for
R G B, two cables of 50 Ohm impedance for horizontal and vertical
sync.)

A low voltage computer cable isn't suited very well. This will
cause interferences over the lines.
There are special video cables available holding small coaxial cable
of right impedances inside.

The two inputs of one lattice of the TTL are wired together for a
sync input. Connect the four unused inputs to ground. Don't
connect the unused outputs because they are at high potential!

The Resistor of 220 Ohm is to avoid vertical stripes on the screen.
I think all AGA-Amigas are producing such stripes. They are
particulary visible at all resulutions with 27 kHz and more
(DblPal, DblNtsc, Muliscan).
Don't use the resistor with a genlock, it wouldn't work correctly.

If you have interferences on screens with wide dark areas after
starting the amiga (the machine is just cold) increase the value
of the resistor.
