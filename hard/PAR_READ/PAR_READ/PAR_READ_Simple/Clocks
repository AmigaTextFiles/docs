                       The Two EASILY Accessible Clocks.
                       ---------------------------------

  When I uploaded PAR_READ.lha to AMINET some time ago I had to build a very
  simple clock pulse generator to toggle the ~-ACK~ line of the parallel
  port. I set this at about 1KHz just purely for experimentation but it
  could have been any frequency from very slow to 20KHz or more. I decided
  to find a MUCH easier way to use PAR: as a VOLUME without using this
  extra home built hardware and it dawned on me that there are ALWAYS two
  usable clocks coming from a port at the back of the AMIGA. One is slow at
  approximately 50 to 60Hz the other is fast at approximately 15+KHz.

  These ~CLOCK~ pulses sit on the 23 Way VIDEO ~DB23~ plug at the rear of
  the AMIGA.

  ASSUME the AMIGA is running in PAL or NTSC mode.

  The SLOW CLOCK is on Pin 12 of this plug and the FAST CLOCK is on Pin 11.

  The SLOW CLOCK is the ~VSYNC~, is active low and is the vertical sync'
  pulse for monitor use, and is 50 to 60Hz.

  The FAST CLOCK is the ~HSYNC~, is active low and is the horizontal sync'
  pulse for monitor use, and is 15 to 16KHz.

  BOTH are at TTL level and are PERFECT for toggling the ~-ACK~ line of the
  parallel port, Pin 10.

  A simple wire connection is all that is required from one of these Pins
  of the VIDEO port to the PARALLEL port Pin 10.

  NOTE that this is NOT limited to PAL or NTSC as all ECS, AGA and RTG
  graphics modes have SYNC' pulses coming from their VIDEO output sockets.
  The frequencies vary but there ARE still ~CLOCK~(s) available for your
  use AND at TTL level.

  (Also these clocks are absolutely LOCKED to either the horizontal and/or
  vertical blanking periods and could be used to HW trigger ANY event(s)
  of your choice.)

  GOOD EH!... :)
