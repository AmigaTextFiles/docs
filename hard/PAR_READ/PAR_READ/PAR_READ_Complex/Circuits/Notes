                      A Few Notes About The Pictures.
                      -------------------------------

  1) This is NOT the Stripboard version described in the Manual.
  2) It is a Eurocard that I use for experimental work only.
  3) The Eurocard is readily available along with the PCB type 25
     way ~D~ type plug if this is the way you want to go also.
  4) The small IC is the -ACK_CLOCK circuit.
  5) The large IC is the ADC circuit.
  6) The jumper is for other experimental work I am doing and is NOT
     needed for this archive so this part can be ignored.
  7) -ACK_ADC.HAM is a PAL 320x512 HAM Lores-Interlaced image.
  8) WIRING.HAM is a PAL 320x256 HAM Lores image
  9) In reality only the -ACK_CLOCK circuit is REQUIRED, ADC is optional.
 10) The HAM images are poor quality by todays standards but are more
     than satisfactory for general viewing. They can be displayed on
     ALL classic AMIGAs so that was why I used HAM mode. The JPG versions
     are for AMIGA owners with graphics cards.
 11) These images are for guidance only and NOT definitive as you may
     decide on a properly etched circuit board.
 12) -ACK_CLOCK.IFF is a 320x200 2 colour circuit diagram, see Part 13).
 13) IMPORTANT!!!. The ")(" in the supply rails from the AMIGA +5V rail
     AND the optional +5V AND GND rails are circuit BREAKS and link
     ONLY the ONE supply rail that you will use in your construction.
     DO NOT CONNECT THE TWO +5V RAILS TOGETHER AT ALL!!!.
 14) ADC.IFF is also a 320x200 2 colour circuit diagram, refer to the
     Manual for D1 and D2.
 15) These two IFF images use ~Display~ as the default viewer which was
     part of an OS2.0x install. You can use any display program of your
     choice for these Project icons.
 16) The HAM and JPG images have NO real default icons at all.

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
