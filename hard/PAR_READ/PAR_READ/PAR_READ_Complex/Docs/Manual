           The PAR: Device Used As A VOLUME In READ Mode ONLY.
           ---------------------------------------------------

  Preface:-
  ---------

  Before we get into the project proper, humour me here. :)

  I know that PAR: is a DEVICE and NOT a VOLUME but if you read this
  simple explanation then you will see where I am coming from.

  Imagine a normal AMIGA, say an A1200 probably with a HDD fitted.
  Now the internal floppy disk drive is DF0: and this is the DEVICE.

  This device can be manipulated by device drivers with offsets inside the
  device driver(s), (e.g. trackdisk.device), to give limited control of the
  HW, (note that at pure HW level full control can be achieved), this
  does not require any serious knowledge of the workings of the disk drive
  other than what the offset names mean.

  OK, now suppose that you insert a floppy disk labelled DF0 and now the
  DEVICE DF0: has a VOLUME also called DF0. This VOLUME can only be written
  to or read from AND manipulation of the volume is done by the DEVICE.

  This is exactly the way I am using PAR: as NO device offsets are being
  used by the sofware ONLY a call to OPEN the DEVICE and from then on
  just READING in this case, NOT WRITING although it is SO EASY to WRITE
  to it from the CLI/Shell to print ASCII characters to a standard parallel
  port printer. In EITHER case some sort of EXTERNAL HW modification will
  be required to SEND or RECEIVE data to and from the parallel port.

  THIS project is for RECEIVING 8 Bit binary data from the parallel port
  WITHOUT the need to know anything about the internal workings of the
  port at all.

  I decided on ARexx as this is effectively ~FREE~ with OS2 to the A1 and
  OS4. I have NO IDEA if this works on an A1 with OS4 or PPC gear with
  MOS or any other derivative of an AMIGA WITH ARexx AND PAR: installed.

  IF ANYONE is interested in experimenting with me and OWNS an A1 or PPC
  MOS type AMIGAs the Email me at    wisecracker@tesco.net    as I would
  love to make this project UNIVERSAL to the point of OS4 at least.

  TIA... :)

  Enjoy experimenting like I do with VERY simple solutions to sometimes
  very difficult problems. See my ~Criteria~ for these projects and you'll
  understand what I mean.

============================================================================

  General Overview:-
  ------------------

  This project is SO simple that I have split it into two parts.

  The first part the ~-ACK_CLOCK~ is ALWAYS REQUIRED to use this method of
  accessing the parallel port. This is a simple '555 timer IC running in
  astable mode at somewhere around 1KHz and CONTINUOUSLY toggling the
  ~-ACK~ line of the parallel port, Pin 10. I left it at that clock rate
  because I was using ARexx which is slow in relation to other languages.
  This can EASILY be built on the kitchen table by a young child without
  ANY special construction techniques, (which is part of my criteria).
  No special components are required and can be obtained from any ordinary
  electronic components supplier.

  The second part is an A-D Converter add-on which will be used to make
  a VERY simple 0V to 5.10V Voltmeter. This is a DIRECT derivative of
  of my Project6 of TestGear2.lha in the hard/hack drawer of AMINET.
  Because this performs EXACTLY the same as the Project6 A-D Converter
  then ALL of the HW projects that use Project6 will work on this project
  BUT YOU will have to modify OR re-write the ARexx code for those projects
  to work of course. This is the ~ADC~ project. This is NOT needed at all
  if all you want to do is INPUT binary data to the parallel port, ONLY the
  ~-ACK_CLOCK~ IS required for correct operation.

============================================================================

                   The -ACK_CLOCK For PAR: In Read Mode.
                   -------------------------------------

  Overview:-
  ----------

  For PAR: to work in READ mode WITHOUT using DEVICE offsets and using
  ARexx then there are some limitations:-

  1) The data lines are ALL set to READ and CANNOT be indivdually made
     INPUT or OUTPUT. These are Pins 2 to 9 inclusive. The parallel.device
     will ONLY set ALL data lines to READ OR WRITE as required AND the
     device offsets will not ALLOW individual lines to be controlled.
  2) Pin 1 of the parallel port, -STROBE, (-DRDY), is NOT required for
     correct operation, it can be used IF needed but it is not necessary.
  3) Pin 10, the -ACK line MUST be toggled for any data sitting on the
     parallel port to be READ by any software.
  4) All other Pins are NOT used, except for Pins 14 for the +5V and 20
     for GND purely for a 5V supply for the -ACK_CLOCK HW and the optional
     ADC HW.
     Note that these two pins are different for an A1000 and are 23 for
     the +5V and 20 for GND.
  5) Read PAR_Device for more information about ALL of these pins or
     further on in this Manual for a precis about it.
  6) ARexx is SSLLOOWW, BUT it exists on standard OS installs from 2.0x
     to 3.9x and this HW works on all GENUINE AMIGAs with these OSs and
     with ARexx and PAR: installed. Also it is ~FREE~ and any code
     written in ARexx is NOT subject to upload restrictions to sites
     like AMINET.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Construction:-
  --------------

  To make the -ACK_CLOCK project VERY CHEAP I decided to use
  Veroboard/Stripboard as this is easy to obtain and NO special dangerous
  etching methods are employed. All of the components, (and a case which is
  NOT in the Parts List as it is optional), are readily available and
  should be VERY cheap for such a versatile means of parallel port
  access. It opens up the door for all kinds of add-ons such as:-

  1) A-D Conversion. See further in the Manual.
  2) Voltmeters, Ammeters, Data-Loggers, Power Meters, Slow Logic Probes.
  3) With special adaptors, Thermometers, Anemometers and many more.
  4) Also because the data lines are being READ then they could be
     used to detect fault conditions of different aparatus connected to
     it and WARN on screen of pending ~DOOM~... :)
     For example a Water Depth Alarm.

  The list is ~endless~ and opens up a new avenue for experimentation.

  Last But Not Least it is SOOOO simple and NO special coding knowledge
  is needed for the parallel port access and NO special construction
  knowledge is required either. It is SO simple that there are no drawings
  on how to build the item. A teenager with basic electronics skills could
  easily build it from first principles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  How Does It Work?:-
  -------------------

/* ----------------------------------------------- */
/* PAR: used as a ~volume~ for binary data access. */
/*            (C)2005, B.Walker, G0LCU.            */
/* ----------------------------------------------- */
/* Use ECHO for printing to the screen and SAY for */
/*      printing any variables to the screen.      */
/* ----------------------------------------------- */
/*   IMPORTANT!!!, run ONLY from a SHELL or CLI.   */
/* From the SHELL/CLI, type:-  RX PAR.rexx<RETURN> */
/* ----------------------------------------------- */


/* Show my version number and (C) for one line only. */
/* (Note these two lines can be omitted.) */
    ECHO 'c'x
    ECHO '$VER: PAR.rexx_Version_0.94.00_(C)01-09-2005_B.Walker_G0LCU.'


/* Set up any variables. */
    ParaByte = ''
    MyByte = ''


/* Set the signal for breaking the script, ~Ctrl C~. */
    SIGNAL ON BREAK_C


/* ------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* This is the main working loop for accessing the parallel port. */
    DO FOREVER

/* Open up a channel for reading from the parallel port. */
    OPEN(ParaByte, 'PAR:', 'R')

/* Read a single binary character from the port. */
    MyByte = READCH(ParaByte, 1)

/* If MyByte is a NULL then this corresponds to the EOF, 0, so correct */
/* it by making sure ALL NULLs are given the value of 0. */
    IF MyByte = '' THEN MyByte = 0

/* All major data access done, NOW IMMEDIATELY close the channel. */
    CLOSE(ParaByte)

/* Print the character onto the screen. */
/* This binary character ~MyByte~ can now be manipulated by all */
/* of the normal methods available under ARexx. */
    SAY 'Byte at parallel port is decimal value '||C2D(MyByte)'.    '
    END
/* ------------------------------------------------------------------- */


/* Cleanup and exit from the script. */
Break_C:
    EXIT

  Refer to the above ludicrously simple ARexx script.

  After setting up ~global~ variables the ARexx script goes into a loop
  and ~Ctrl C~ is the only way to exit it. It WILL hang IF the -ACK_CLOCK
  HW is NOT connected however and ~Ctrl C~ will NOT work.

  It opens up PAR: in READ mode for binary data access except for ONE
  binary value. This is 0 which is for all intents and purposes an EOF
  character.

  This single byte, binary data sits on the parallel port and hangs there
  ad-infinitum until a ~clock pulse~ from HIGH to LOW and back again
  appears on the -ACK line of the parallel port, Pin 10. This is what
  this HW is for to give a continuous train of pulses to Pin 10.
  If NOTHING as connected to the data lines then 255 will be read
  from the port. That is, all data lines set to HIGH, logic 1.

  If all the data lines are set to LOW, that is 0, then a NULL character
  is generated and a simple correction line is required to give this
  NULL character a value of 0.

  After each character access the OPENED PAR: ~volume~ is then CLOSED.

  The value is then printed to the screen.

  There you have it, binary input without special AMIGA internals
  knowledge. It gives 8 bit accuracy for most amateur hobbyists needs
  and with the ~FREE~ AMIGA ARexx the means to code for it also.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Testing The -ACK_CLOCK HW:-
  ---------------------------

  1) Check all construction work before continuing.
  2) Re-check all construction work AGAIN.
  3) Check for short and open circuit(s) AGAIN.
  4) A final check against the ~-ACK_CLOCK.IFF~ drawing.
  5) Switch OFF the AMIGA.
  6) Connect the -ACK_CLOCK HW to the parallel port.
  7) IF a separate 5 Volt power source is used for the home built HW then
     switch this ON.
  8) Power up and boot the AMIGA with RexxMast running and PAR: in the
     device list.
  9) Open up a Shell or CLI.
 10) Go to the drawer containing the PAR.rexx script.
 11) From the prompt type "RX PAR.rexx<RETURN>" without the quotes.
 12) "Byte at parallel port is decimal value 255." will be continuously
     printed to the screen WITHOUT the quotes.
 13) If the system hangs then there is a problem. Go to Part 15)
 14) If all is well then press Ctrl C and the script will exit back
     to the prompt.
 15) Switch OFF the AMIGA, (then switch OFF the home built HW).
 16) Disconnect the home built HW, if there is a fault go back to Part 1).

============================================================================

             The Optional Analogue To Didital Converter Project.
             ---------------------------------------------------

  Overview:-
  ----------

  This project will enable you to use the parallel port to input voltages
  from 0 to +5 Volts positive and display this voltage in a test window.
  When built it could easily be used with other projects to measure all
  types of signals whether they be DC, AC, voltage, current, power etc...
  using the correct type of ARexx script.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Construction:-
  --------------

  (This is an optional extra and can be ignored if it is not wanted.)

  There are no construction notes as this is another TestGear project and
  you should by now be able to build the -ACK_CLOCK and the ADC without any
  guidance. If you require some assistance then download TestGear2.lha from
  AMINET and refer to Project6 the A-D Converter Project for help. This has
  other sofware to calibrate and test the ADC part of this dual project.

  D1 and D2 can be omitted from the construction if a separate 5V supply
  is used. This is the recommended way as it divorces itself from the
  computer completely. IF the AMIGA is known then a single wire link CAN be
  connected from EITHER Pin 14 OR Pin 23 depending on the AMIGA in question
  to the 5V rail of the home built HW.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Calibrating The A-D Converter:-
  -------------------------------

  You WILL require a NEW 1.5 Volt dry cell type ~R6~. I used an ~EVEREADY~
  RED body ~ULTRA PLUS~ type, although any ZINC/CHLORIDE type will probably
  be alright.

  1) Do "Testing The -ACK_CLOCK HW:-" Parts 1) to 3) inclusive first.
  2) Switch OFF the AMIGA and connect the ADC/-ACK_CLOCK board to the
     parallel port.
  3) Boot up the AMIGA to a standard Workbench 2.0x or greater.
  4) From a CLI/Shell go to the drawer with the PAR.rexx program in it.
  5) Type RX PAR.rexx<RETURN>.
  6) The line "Byte at parallel port is decimal value 0.", (or 1), will be
     continuously printed to the screen.
  7) Connect the 1.5 Volt cell across the RCA input of the A-D Converter
     using a previously made test lead from the Stereo LF Audio Function
     Generator project, (Project5), positive to probe tip.
  8) Adjust RV1 to give a value of 84 + or - 1 on the screen.
  9) If all is well then you now have a simple 0 to +5 Volt DC voltmeter.
 10) Use ~Ctrl C~ to Quit the ARexx script and Close the CLI/Shell window.
 11) Run the ~VM~ ARexx software to start using the A-D Converter proper.
 12) When finished, Quit the VM software, switch OFF the AMIGA and
     disconnect the hardware.

                 Some Information About The PAR: ~VOLUME~.
                 -----------------------------------------

This is from experimentation, see the ~PAR_Device~ file for more info'.
(NOTE, these notes could be wrong!!!)

A) In READ mode on the 25 way ~D~ type socket.
(Note - means active low.)

  1) Pin 1......................  -STROBE line, fixed OUTPUT.
  2) Pin 2 to pin 9.............  Data lines INPUT ONLY, set to high.
  3) Pin 10.....................  -ACK line, fixed INPUT.
  4) Pin 11.....................  BUSY line, fixed OUTPUT, set to low.
  5) Pin 12.....................  POUT line, fixed OUTPUT, set to low.
  6) Pin 13.....................  (-)SEL line, fixed OUTPUT, set to high.
  7) Pin 14.....................  NOT USED, (+5V on classic AMIGAs).
  8) Pin 15.....................  NOT USED, (NC on classic AMIGAs).
  9) Pin 16.....................  -RESET line, follows the standard reset.
 10) Pin 17.....................  NOT USED, (Ground on classic AMIGAs).
 11) Pin 20 to pin 25...........  Ground, (also pins 18 and 19).

Information only. EVERY time the parallel port is accessed the -STROBE
line is triggered for about 1.5uS. This is NOT required for PAR: in
BINARY READ mode.

The -ACK line MUST be toggled to get each ~byte~ of data into a user
buffer. This line does NOT need to be sync'd to the -STROBE line to work,
and can be a free running, external, clock pulse.

Pins 11, 12 and 13 are NOT needed for BINARY input operation. ONLY pins
2 to 10 inclusive are required, that is the eight data lines, pins 2 to
9 inclusive, and the -ACK line pin 10.

NONE of the individual pins can be altered on the fly from INPUT to OUTPUT
and vice versa when using PAR: in VOLUME mode.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

B) In WRITE mode on the 25 way ~D~ type socket.

  1) Pin 1......................  -STROBE line, fixed OUTPUT.
  2) Pin 2 to pin 9.............  Data lines OUTPUT ONLY, set to low.
  3) Pin 10.....................  -ACK line, fixed INPUT.
  4) Pin 11.....................  BUSY line, fixed INPUT, set to high.
  5) Pin 12.....................  POUT line, fixed INPUT, set to high.
  6) Pin 13.....................  (-)SEL line, fixed INPUT, set to high.
  7) Pin 14.....................  NOT USED, (+5V on classic AMIGAs).
  8) Pin 15.....................  NOT USED, (NC on classic AMIGAs).
  9) Pin 16.....................  -RESET line, follows the standard reset.
 10) Pin 17.....................  NOT USED, (Ground on classic AMIGAs).
 11) Pin 20 to pin 25...........  Ground, (also pins 18 and 19).

(Ensure a printer is attached to the parallel port.)
To see PAR: being used as a ~volume~ in WRITE mode open up a CLI and
type the following:-

Echo > PAR: "This is a test line sending plain text to a PRINTER."<ENTER>

This will send the text line to the parallel port and a random printer
should print it as GENERIC text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although very minor, there is a flaw when using PAR: in VOLUME mode READ
or WRITE format. I'll let you find out what it is... :)
It does NOT affect the overall usage of PAR: as a VOLUME however, so I will
not pursue it any further.

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
    PCMCIA memory expansions. All memory expansions were ~DISABLED~ using
    the NoFastMem program from the System drawer. Also tested on two A600s
    with various memory configurations, a 1MB A500+ and an old style A500
    with a 0.5MB memory expansion at $C00000 using the A500+ emulator and
    Workbench 2.04, and LBNL an A600 emulating KS3.0x and running
    Workbench 3.0x. Also tested on an A4000 with various upgrades and
    OS3.9x.

    All test conditions were/are running STANDARD KS2.0x to 3.9x, and using
    standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.
