My  friend has bought Blizzard1260 turbo board. What we made first was
testing  of  it's  speed.  Yeah! Great boost, but... slower to Pentium
machines!  So  I  was desperated to think out something to speed up it
yet  more.  Solution  is  simple:  Replace  50MHz clock generator with
faster  one.  Yes,  I know - CPU will be overclocked then, but it's so
common in PC world! So, let's begin...

What you will need:

  i.c. named MX8315
  capacitor 47nF
  three resistors 10kohm
  quartz oscillator 14.318MHz
  three jumpers

MX8315  is  an integrated PLL clock generator. You can get a different
output  frequency  by  changing  settings  of  JP1,  JP2 and JP3. I've
removed  this  chip  from my old, defective Pentium motherboard. Every
Pentium  motherboard  must  have  this  or similar circuit. Oh, yes! I
forgot to explain, why to use this instead of replacing original clock
generator  chip  with  faster one. Of course, this was my first choice
too.  I  checked  66MHz  generator first. Wow! Amiga was over 90 times
faster  to  A500,  but...  it didn't worked too long. My computer went
crazy after a few minutes. I've found it's too fast. So I tried to buy
little  slower  generator  and...  I managed to buy only 55MHz one. It
worked  fine  but  I wanted to check 60MHz! So I had to make circuit I
describe below. Ok, now you know the whole story.

How to assembly this stuff (see iff picture for schematic):

Bent  all  pins  of  U1  around.  Leave only pins 1, 7, 8 and 14 (with
orange  bullets),  with  those  pins  you will insert generator into a
socket on a Blizzard1260 board. Connect pins with a thin wire as shown
on  the  picture, then mount other elements (oscillator, capacitor and
resistors).  Resistors are optional. You can tie pins FS0, FS1 and FS2
directly  to  5V  (DVDD)  or  0V  (DGND). For 60MHz output clock (CLK)
connect  FS0,  FS2  to  5V,  FS1  to  0V. Now the most difficult part:
Unsolder  and  remove  original  50MHz  clock  generator (square metal
element).  Remember  this invalidates your warranty! You may need some
special  equipment  here.  Be  careful! You may damage your board! You
must  be  100%  sure  you are able to do this. In the other case leave
this job to your experienced friend.

OK.  You  made  it!  Have  you realized, that there are two more drill
holes  reserved  for  "big" generator on Blizzard board. Now clean two
top  and two bottom holes and place the socket for our generator. Pins
1, 7, 8, 14 are compatible with pinout of generator, so you can insert
it  into  a  socket  with  these  pins  (I hope you know what I mean).
Remember  to  check  orientation  of  a chip. Pin no. 1 is marked by a
square both on my picture and on the board.

That's  all! My Amiga works fine with 60MHz clock and now it is almost
20%  faster.  I hope you will not have any problems either. Anyway you
can  always  replace  the  original generator. Also, try to find 60MHz
chip first. You are happy man if you have this, your task will be much
simpler.
