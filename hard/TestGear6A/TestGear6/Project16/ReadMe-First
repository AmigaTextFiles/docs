    General Information:-
    ---------------------

    This tool is an Audio Encoder to generate the necessary codes for
    professional business two way radios. It is just as good for the
    professional RF engineer as well as for the AMATEUR enthusiast.
    The modes generated are CTCSS, DCS, SELCALL, DTMF, 2TONE, VOICE,
    CONTINUOUS SINGLE TONE and ALL OFF with mixtures of these.

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    This was designed with both PAL and NTSC in mind.
    An A500+ in 1MB and 5MB modes, an A600 in 1MB, 2MB and 6MB modes
    and an A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes, an A4000T in various modes.

    Workbench 2.0x to Workbench 3.0x. WinUAE, see ~WinUAE~ drawer.

    (Although untested thoroughly, it DOES work under Workbench 1.3x
    and an old style 1MB A500 with an extra floppy disk drive.)
