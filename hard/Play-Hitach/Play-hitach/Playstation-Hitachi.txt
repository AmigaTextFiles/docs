To connect a Playstation to the Hitachi TV you require the following parts:-
                       
                       1no - shop bought Blaze scart cable
                       1no - 7pin din plug male

Dismantle the scart plug and make sure to retain the audio connections
(the one's going to the phono plugs).you will need something to insulate these
I used rubber sleeves but tape will do fine.just solder the connections as shown 
in fig2. making sure to identify each numbered connection before soldering 
and double check afterwards.
I have used this cable on my playstation and is lovely and clear.
Also these tv's appear to be becoming available at numerous places 2nd hand.


                                Good Luck!
