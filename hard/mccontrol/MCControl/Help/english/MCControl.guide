@{MS "Introduction"}

MCControl is a tool for all PSX owners. It's a hard and software project to read and write your
memory cards.@{par}

So there is no need to buy new bigger memory cards. Just one card is needed to store all your save
games.@{par}

MCControl allows to import savegames from internet, so you'll get access to features and stages
you've never been before.@{par}

@endnode
@node "Systemrequirements" "Systemrequirements"

@{MS "System requirements"}

MCControl (should work) works on all Amigas with OS 2.0 or higher.@{par}

The @{b}gtdrag.library V3.2+@{ub} is required if you want to use the drag and drop features. I
suggest to use this library if possible, because the only other way to move save games between
windows is to save and reload. @{b}The gtdrag.library requires OS3.x+ and a 68020 or
better!@{ub}@{par}

A PSX and a MemoryCard should be around, too! (-8@{par}

You need a @{"DexDrive" link "FAQSDexDrive"}, a @{"PSXPort" link "FAQSPSXPort"} or you must build a
special @{"hardware" link "Hardware"}!@{par}


   That`s all!
@endnode
@node "Featurelist" "Features"

@{MS "Features"}

  ° 100% Assembler@{par}

@{MS "Distribution"}

This program should be published on every public medium, as long as all files in the archive are
unchanged. If this medium is a CD I expect a free copy. (AminetCDs excluded)@{par}

@{b}Blittersoft is allowed to sell this archive within their @{"PSXPort" link "FAQSPSXPort"}
packet!@{ub}@{par}

@{b}MCControl is Mailware.@{ub}@{par}

I expect from everybody, who uses MCControl regularly, to send me an email or postcard. I think this
does not hurt anybody, and I will have more fun to integrate new features. In addition to that it's
possible to insert your EMail address into my MCControl mailing list. So you'll get access to pre
releases and additional information about MCControl.@{par}

@{b}I am not liable for injures or data loss caused by MCControl or the
@{"hardware" link "hardware"}. The use of MCControl is on your own responsibility !!!@{ub}

@endnode
@node "HowToInstall" "How to install MCControl"

@{MS "How to install MCControl"}

Please use the original @{b}system installer@{ub} for installation. This allows to create a memory
and hard disk optimized installation.@{par}

Well, its also possible to drag the MCControl drawer onto your hard disk, but - as I said above -
you are wasting hard disk and memory.@{par}

Thats all!@{par}

Don't forget to build the @{"CardReader" link "Hardware"}!! (-8

BUGFIX: Multi slot reader with none or only one card within the personal card list, caused a gadget

Thanks to Ivan Budjak for the nice idea! Why it wasn't my idea in the first place? (-8@{par}
FEATURE: Added new pictures for the disk port hardware.@{par}
CHANGED: Reworked the parallel port driver and changed the names, so there is no MCControl.mcm

@{MS "What is a Region or Productcode?"}

Well, each game is developed with special feature of the region. Every one knows that a US game
isn't working on an european Playstation. To make this work every game becomes an unique code for
this region.


   Example:


   BESLES-00463@{par}
   ------------@{par}
   0123456789ab@{par}

   0     The "B" is constant.@{par}
   1     Region of the developer.@{par}
   2     The "S" is constant.@{par}
   3     "L" Licence@{par}
         "C" Computer Sony products only.@{par}
         So 234 on an european sony game results "Sony Computer Europe" or@{par}
         on a licenced game "Sony Licence Europe"@{par}
   4     The Game is only working on Playstations for this region.@{par}
   5     "S" Software@{par}
         "D" Demo (a PSX demo software)@{par}
         "H" Hardware (controller, memory cards, multitaps, light guns)@{par}
   6     Separator, constant, "-"@{par}
   789ab Number of the game (the licence number). Games may have differend@{par}
          numbers for different regions (4).@{par}

A geman developer for example would get BESLUS-12345 as product id for the US version of a game. The
european id of the same game may look like this BESLES-22222.


Save games may contain 8 additional chars to separate types of save games for the same game. Its
correct to save these 8 bytes are the file name.


   "BESLES-22222Records "@{par}
   "BESLES-22222Settings"@{par}

The easiest way to get those IDs is to open the @{"save game patcher" link "Patc"}! You'll find the
ID in the @{"ProductID" link "PatcProd"} Gadget! The first 12 characters represent the complete
product id followed by 8 bytes of file name, if available.

You want to see it right now? @{"Click here" link "/Pictures/MemoryDiskDrive.jpg/Main"}!@{par}

As you can see it looks like an external Amiga disk drive. Just the two LEDs and the two buttons are
unusual. The buttons are used to activate the transfer to and from disk.@{par}

Is this device useful?@{par}

Well, loading and saving takes 1-1,5 minutes. To save one 15 block MemoryCard one HD disk is
required. There is also an old incompatible and slower version that only supports DD disks. The
hardware is very expensive and you should better by 16 MemoryCards insteed of this device.@{par}

Why you should change the hardware?


Well, the new hardware version consumes less CPU power during card access and the card reading speed
depents on the speed of the used card.


What is required to modify the old version?


It's just one little wire! A bridge (connection) between Pin 10 and Pin 12 on the Amiga-connector. I
called it @{b}IRQ Bridge@{ub}, because this wire creates a bridge to the IRQ connector of the Amiga
parallel port.


Thats all!

@node "FAQSExternalV" "FAQ: What are the external power supply specifications?"
@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "What are the external power supply specifications?"}

The external power supply voltage should be about 9V-18V! The exact voltage isn't important because
the LM317 is creating always the correct value by using the resistors.


The power supply should be able to output more than 200mA! The output of a playstation itself isn't
more than 100mA per powerline, but the LM317 circuits are consuming some energy, too! If you are
only using 15 block cards then 100mA should be enough!


@{b}Do not use power supplies with less than 100mA! They may work, but they are producing much heat
and may burn out!@{ub}


If the power supply isn't able to supplie enough power, it may happen, that your card isn't working
or must be read much slower than normal. Timo Hegemann is using a normal NoName card, but when using
a 9V Battery instead of an external power supply the card turns into a very slow card!

@node "FAQSDiskPort" "FAQ: What is the Disk Port Hardware?"
@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "What is the Disk Port Hardware?"}

The @{"disk port hardware" link "HardDisk"} is identicaly to the standard @{"parallel port version" link "HardPara"}. The
only difference is that the reader is connected to the disk port and not to the parallel port.

@{MS "The good things:"}

There is no need of an external power supply, because there is a 12V line on the disk port you can
use.


You parallel port stays free!


@{MS "The bad things:"}

The disk access will be shut down, because MCControl is using the hardware! @{b}This problem will be
fixed, soon!@{ub}


The disk port reader causes trouble with Index-line driven disk formats like PC-Disk. These disks
aren't working, when as long the card reader is connected! It's possible to avoid this by
disconnecting the /WProt line (pin 14) off your disk port connector. This makes your reader 100%
disk drive compatible. The only side effect is, that you may (depending on memory card) loose the
multi page support.

@{MS "Why my Diskport-Reader isn't working?"}

Well, its not possible to make a proper diagnose from a distance, but if your reader supports the
required voltages and all lines are connected right and without cross connections, then your problem
seems to be the Konfiguration.@{par}

Each slot of your reader is handled like a disk drive. Normaly there is already one diskdrive, so
slot1 (df0:) is already in use and the first external drive is DF1: (Slot2)! On bigger Amigas the
first external Drive is DF2 (Slot3), because DF1 is locked for internal usage.@{par}

@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "The PSX says my card isn't formated, but...! Why?"}

  ... MCControl is able to access the card without any problems.


Well, this is a very rare problem. The reason is, that the first frame of a MemoryCard indicates
the status. If these frames are invalid the playstation is reporting that the card is
unformated.@{par}

MCControl ignores these frames and if the card is unformated then the directory contains only
invalid entries!@{par}

@node "FAQSDBLanguages" "Why it is required to include languages into the MCdatabase?"
@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "Why it is required to include languages into the MCDatabase?"}

Well, this isn't easy to explain! First lets say european games aren't equal in each country.


In our days each game is a multimedia event, which is using sampled voices, videos and music. The
support of only one language may be enough to fill up an entire CDROM, so its required to make
different versions for all required languages.


Examples are "Heart of Darkness", "Breath of Fire III", "Tomb Raider 1-4" and the Oddworld games.
These games exist in an german only version. Same is done for the most used european languages.


Sony is handling each new languaged version as a new game and the @{"product id" link "FAQSRegion"}
is different even if the game name is the same! Each game is using it product id to recognize its
save game, so the german save game for "Heart of Darkness" isn't working with the français version
and vice vesa.


It's not possible to find out what sub region (Well, I call it sub region) only by scanning the
@{"product id" link "FAQSRegion"}! So all these games get the region "EUR" for european!


Now back to the data base. Normaly it would be enough to specify an "EUR" or a sub region ("DEU",
"FRA", ...), but if you want find out if your game is a german only version you must start the game
and see for your self. Why not entering each language? In the most cases there less than 6 languages
available.


Maybe the languages will be used for another feature, too, so why doing the job right the first
time!

@node "FAQSPSXImageBad" "Why are some PSX Images are looking so ugly?"
@toc "FAQS"

@{MS "Why are some PSX Images are looking so ugly?"}

@{b}MCControl itself is not displaying the images. This is the job of the datatypes.library. I as
programmer just setup a black box and handle the refresh.@{ub}@{par}

Each images has 16 colors. The workbench must have at least 16 colors to display the pictures at
minimum quality.@{par}

The workbench itself owns colors for icons, windows and of course the backdrop image. These colors
are available for other tools, but there is no way to change the color value. This causes the images
to be displayed with the best matching colors. On graphic boards a 16 bit color size (65536 colors)
should remove all your problems. When using 256 colors the new OS3.5 and up icon system is grabbing
most of the colors (depending on the number of icons on screen), so free colors may not be
available.@{par}

@endnode
@node "FAQSPSXImageMiss" "Why some save games aren't containing a PSX image?"

@{MS "Why some save games aren't containing a PSX image?"}

Each save game has an image. The problem is that a datatype is missing or not proper working.
Multiview shouldn't be able to display IFF animations or IFF pictures as well. For example a missing
"realtime.library" causes newer versions of the animation.datatype to fail.@{par}

After reinstalling the datatypes and a system restart everything should work like expected.

@{MS "This is a list of all files that can be used with MCControl"}

Well the first PSX MemoryCard Software was designed for PCs and PCs are stupid! So they created many
formats for the same shit, because there is no reason for creating a special format.

@{MS "MCD - Real MemoryCard Image"}

This is a 1:1 card read out! It is the best format for storing complete MemoryCards, because its
easy to detect and it is small.


If you own other save game types, then send me two files of each type!

@{MS "GME - Game file"}

This file contains a complete MemoryCard!


This is the most stupid card image file type! Its a MCD File using an 3904 Byte header! Most of this
Bytes are unused. Even the name is stupid, because this file may contain the storage of up to 15
games.


I was told that these additional bytes are used to contain special information about the MemoryCard
and each block. Well, I scanned around 100 files and all of them are only using the general
MemoryCard information, so there will no MCControl support for these additional information.


Even some PC tools are not able to write these files correctly! I own some files that are longer
than a standard game file. After scanning the file I found the problem. They just saved to much
data, so you'll find windows specific strings behind the real image.

@{MS "VGS - Video Game Strategies"}

This file contains a complete MemoryCard!


This format is performing a small header with informations about reading the file. Well, quite
useless! It was IMHO created by an organisation named "Video Game Strategies". You'll find them in
internet.

@{MS "PSM"}

This file contains a complete MemoryCard!


It's equal to the MCD format and is used to store MP3 player skins. This is done, because the skin
files aren't in PSX format.

@{MS "PSX - Playstation Game File"}

These files contain the savings created by one game. This may be one block, or more.


This format is great for holding only one saved game.


@{b}Attention: There are damaged (patched) files around. These files aren't working with MCControl,
because important data is missing! If you use AmigaDos and "type Filename hex" you will see, that
these files contain a small message, where you get a working version! Don't do this! Get a serious
source for PSX save games and do not support such "We spread damaged files to powerup our homepage"
suckers!@{ub}

@{MS "MEM - Memory File"}

This format is the most stupid save game format. It requires two (2!!) different files for holding
only one save game. Together these two files are nearly equal to the PSX file.


I think someone decided to create this format for saving programming time. I strongly suggest not to
use this file format, because it doubles the chance to loose data and it requires more disk space.

@{b}General:@{ub}


The patch commandos work like DOS commands. If you want an argument containing a space, then it is
required to use "".


Every time numbers are required you are able to specify them decimal or hexadecimal! Hexadecimal
numbers can be defined by a leading "$" character!


By default all commands are working in the byte @{b}access mode@{ub}! This means every read or write
access will be only one byte wide and not more. To change this behaviour use a leading "B" (1 Byte),
"W" (2 Bytes) or "L" (4 Bytes)!


In addition to that, its also possible to specify a @{b}mask@{ub}, to change only some or even only
one bit. Just put a mask behind the address offset leaded by a "&"!


In the command specifications you'll find an "A" if the argument supports setup an @{b}access
mode@{ub} and a "M" for @{b}mask@{ub} support.


   Examples:


   Access two bytes ($4001/$4002):


   W$4001


@{b}Remember: INTEL like, the first byte will be read as low byte and the second as high byte.@{ub}


   Access four bytes ($23e,$23f,$240,$241) and the masking of $7f.


   L$023e&7f

How to get these @{"Product codes" link "FAQSRegion"}? Very easy! Just take the .PSX file, open a
DOS window and type "Type savegamename.psx hex". At the beginning of the dump you'll find a string
starting with "B". This is exactly what wie need. Just must deliver this complete string to the
support command.


If an ID contains spaces if required to enclose it into quotation marks.


   Examples:

different. The contents is compatible. This is made by games using a whole block for saving the data
for one player. The next player gets a different number. Sometimes the filename is equal to the
player name. To convert such save game its required to setup this command line:

@{MS "CHECKSUM"}

Many save games require no checksum and may be manipulated very easy! If you don't understand how
this command is working then skip ist. You need knowledge of programming and a lot of experience to
do the right. Just playing around makes no sense.


 Template:


   START/K/A,END/K/A,DEST/K/A,ADD/K,SUB/K,EOR/K,ADDCARRY/K,SUBCARRY/K,STARTVALUE/K


 Function:


This command calculates the checkum of a specified area within the save game. This sounds easier
than it is! It will never possible to implement all possible checksum combinations.


Why there is a checksum? Well, programmers of games are saving time by calculating all data by a
specific formula. This will be checked during save game loading and if its not correct the game is
reporting the savegame is defect or empty. The reason is very easy. For example its possible to
collect a maximum of 99 coins. Why should the programmer take care of a value bigger than 99? During
the display operation no further check is done. A patched (or just damaged) save game may cause a
game to crash. A nice side effect is that the game is working a little faster, because there are no
savety checks.


I implemented this command to cheat the game by recalculation the checksum!


 Inputs:


  START      A Offset of the first byte of the checksum area.@{par}
  END          Offset of the first byte after the checksum area.@{par}
  DEST       A Offset of the checksum@{par}
  ADD        A Add values@{par}
  SUB        A Sub values@{par}
  EOR        A EOR values@{par}
  ADDCARRY   A Value to add on carry. (default=0)@{par}
  SUBCARRY   A Value to subtact on carry. (default=0)@{par}
  STARTVALUE   Start value for ADD, SUB and EOR mode (default=0)@{par}

 Examples:


  CHECKSUMM START L$1000 END $2000 DEST L$1004 ADD L0 ADDCARRY W1


Activates a four byte read mode from address $1000 (START L$1000) to $2000 (END $2000) and added
with a 32 bit add (ADD L0). Each carry overflow one is added to the lower word (ADDCARRY W1). The
result will be stored within the four bytes beginning at address $1004 (DEST L$1004).


  CHECKSUM Start L$023A End $6036 Dest L$023A EOR L0


Four byte read mode (START L$023a) and four byte eor (EOR L0) of each value until $6036 is reached
(END $6036). The result will be stored from $023a to $023d (DEST L$023a).


  CHECKSUM Start B$0236 End $0836 Dest W$07de Add W0 SUBCarry B1


Byte by byte Mode (START B$0236). Add bytes word wise (Add W0) and subtract one for each carry
overflow (SUBCarry B1). Destination for the checksum is the word starting at $7de (Dest W$07de).

Many save games require no checksum and may be manipulated very easy, but some are very complex or
contain a special checksumm. For this games I implemented the tool command!


 Template:


  FileName/A


 Function:


This command is running an @{"external program" link "SGTFile"} to patch the savegame.


 Inputs:


FileName:  Name of the @{"SGT File" link "SGTFile"} without path!! The SGT File must be located
within "Patches/SGT/" drawer!

@endnode
@node "SGTFile" "The SGT File Format"
@toc "SGPFile"

@{MS "The SGT File Format"}

SGT files are standard DOS Executables with a little header! For more information about the file
format consult the documentation @{"Bonus/Developer/SGT/SGT.doc" link "//Bonus/Developer/SGT/SGT.doc/MAIN"}

@node "MCDB" "MCControl - MCDatabase"

@{MS "MCDatabase"}

MCDatabase is a little tool to create the MCDatabase.prefs stored in MCControls prefs drawer.


Why this data base? Until now it worked fine!


Yes, and its still working without, but the database contains additional information on Playstation
games. These information are used to make the usage of MCControl much easier!


   Example:


   "GC  1 WILLY   JUNGO      28:19"


Which game is this? I think you had the same problem before this a few of your games. By activating
the @{"special option" link "SettDBNa"} MCControl is using the name in the database instead of the
name delivered by the save game itself. The result looks like this:


   "Guardian's Crusade"


Much better I think!


The same happens when japanise games are using japanise letters to view the game name on
Playstation. This data chaos isn't readable when using MCControl. By using the database "GCI i V" is
automaticaly converted into "Dead or Alive"!

@{MS "Introduction"}

The format of the database wasn't easy to invent. It should be fast and flexible to use for every
one. Thats why I decided to create a text based source format, which will be compiled into a new or
an existing database file. This allows me to change the real database format every day, without any
compatibly problems.


The databse can be found in the MCControl prefs drawer by the name "MCDatabase.prefs". Its the
normal IFF-PREF format.


By using the MCDatabase tool you are able to add new and modify existing games.


It's just required to create a test file by using any text editor. This file contains all
information for any game you want to change. These are the game names, game product ids and all
languages available within the the games. This text file is the key. It's irrelevant what format the
data base is using in the future, this text file stays valid forever and the only thing to do is to
complile the data into the database.

@endnode
@node "MCDBForm" "MCDatabase - The File Format"
@toc "MCDB"

@{MS "The File Format"}

Well, the file format is a simple text file. The first line must contain a comment and will no be
parsed. Beginning with the second line each line represents one game.


Each game line is parsed by using this normal dos template:


   "NAME/A,PRODUCTID/A,DEU/S,ENG/S,FRA/S,ESP/S,SVE/S,ITA/S,JAP/S,NED/S"


 Example:


;This is the first line and ignored by the parser!!!@{par}
"Ruff & Tumble (40 Winks)" SLES-01939 DEU@{par}
"S.C.A.R.S." SLES-01286 DEU ENG FRA ESP ITA@{par}

Important is that the game name is placed within quotation marks, like required for filenames
containing spaces. If the product id contains spaces, then here quotation marks are required, too!


The languages are the languages available within the game. If there is no language selection then
just specify the automaticaly used language.


Please @{b}always@{ub} specify @{"all languages" link "FAQSDBLanguages"}. If a language isn't
available in my dos template, then let me know and I'll implement this language. Without specifing
the languages MCControl isn't able to view IDs like "DEU" or "FRA"!

@node "MCDBComp" "MCDatabase - Compiling the Database"
@toc "MCDB"

@{MS "Compiling the Database"}

The required tool can be found in the "Bonus/MCDatabase"-drawer of your MCControl installation.


You are allowed to specify 3 arguments:


   DIFF/A,TO/A,FROM:


   DIFF    : Name of your text file containing the database changes.@{par}
   TO      : This is the destination name of the new/updated database!@{par}
   FROM    : Here you can specify an old data base as input. This is@{par}
              required when changing an existing data base. If nothing@{par}
              is specified here, then a complete new data base will be@{par}
              created containing only the games specified in your text@{par}
              file (DIFF).@{par}

   Examples:


@{b}I used MC: for the MCControl drawer, just to make the examples easier@{Ub}


Create a new data base containing all games specified in New.txt!


MCDDatabase t:New.txt t:MCDatabase.prefs


Change the delivered data base:


MCDDatabase t:New.txt t:MCDatabase.prefs MC:Prefs/MCDatabase.prefs


The old data base will be loaded and changed by the information specified in t:New.txt. After this
the data base is stored in the "T:" drawer.


@{b}Its possible to overwrite the database direct, but on a failure (e.g. a wrong ID caused
MCDatabase to overwrite an other game instead of creating a new one!) you may damage other data base
entries. Thats the reason why destination (TO) and source (FROM) should be different!@{ub}
