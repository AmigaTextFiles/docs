   How to use these SGT files? Well,  its  very  simple.  MCControl  calls
   these  file twice! The first time its for the init process and a second
   time for the final update.

   Note: The command will be reloaded, so saving data within the command
   is useless.

   Example:

   Your save game stores the lives multiplied by 6:

   Mode_Pre:  Divide the lives by 6 and write result into the PSX file.
   Mode_Post: Multiply the value given by the gadgets by 6 and write the
              result into the given PSX file.

   If you need room for storage then feel free to use up  to  16384  Bytes
   behind  the  given PSX file. (see Pitfall3D, where the offset 10000 and
   up is used for data storage)

 *General*

        RSRESET
SGTF_RTS                   rs.w 1 ;to avoid crash when user is starting module
SGTF_Version               rs.w 1 ;Currently 0
SGTF_ID                    rs.l 1 ;must be "SGTF"

   In Assembler this looks like this:

   RTS
   dc.w 0
   dc.l "SGTF"

   Your routine is placed direct behind this header  using  the  following
   arguments:

   >a0.l Pointer on PSX File
   >d0.l Mode

   a0 points on the PSX file memory buffer. Its allowed to use up to 16384
   bytes  after  the real PSX file.

   Where mode (d0) specifies:

   SGTF_Mode_Pre  = 0
   SGTF_Mode_Post = 1

   The SGTF_Mode_Pre mode is used before opening the window,  so  you  can
   setup  the  gadget  values!  The  mode  SGTF_Mode_Post  is  used  after
   processing the gadget commands and before the checksum command.
