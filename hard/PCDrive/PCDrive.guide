Take care to do correctly all connections and soldering! Pay attention! This
interface works fine and I have one working as DF1!

                              @{i} Good Luck!@{ui}

Simple! Do the connections below and build the @{"circuit" system "run >NIL: amigaguide PCDrive.iff"}. The Ge (@{u}@{uu}@{fg shine}@{b}@{fg fill}@{ub}@{i}Germanium@{ub}@{fg text})@{ui}
diode can be AA113, AA118, OA90, 1N34 or @{fg shine}@{fg text}1N60@{fg text} and the transistor can be
changed by other NPN with ~200 of hFE current gain.

Odd wires (1~33 on Drive BUS) are connected to ground at 3,5 and 7 pins on
Amiga drive port connector.
