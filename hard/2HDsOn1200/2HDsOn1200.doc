else to do it for you.

What u need
~~~~~~~~~~~
For the IDE data cable:

o 1 PC IDE cable (3.5" to 2x 3.5")

o a 2.5" IDE connector or a 2.5"->3.5"/2.5" IDE cable to nick one off.

For the power cable:

o 2 male HD style power connectors (nick from a PC power supply <G>)
  Make sure you leave plenty of wire on them if you nick them from a PC.

o 1 PC HD style power to diskdrive style power connector

You can get everything you need from a PC shop. Hey, they're usefull for
somethings :)

You'll also need a soldering iron and some solder and some tape. Black
electrical tape does the trick.

If you're doing 2HD's, any 2 3.5" IDE HD's will do ... if you're doing 1 HD
and a CD Rom, make sure that the CD Rom has master/slave jumpers otherwise
it won't work.

Making the IDE cable (the cheapo way)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is tricky ..

CAREFULLY remove the 2.5" connector from the 2.5"->3.5" cable .. it's very
easy to snap it .. if you do, its no big problem ... u just need more tape :)

Take the 3.5" connector off the 3.5" 2way cable. You don't have to be carefull
with this one cos u wont need it anymore. 

Attach the 2.5" connector in place of the 3.5" one u just removed. You will
probably have to split all the leads up and put them in 1 by 1 to get it to
fit OK. there will be 3 or 4 (i can't remember) left over on the OPPOSITE
side to the red one. Dont worry bout these, should work without it.

The IDE cable 2, the not so cheap way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can buy a 2.5" to 3.5" converter. This is just a small bit of PCB which
you can put inside the 1200. This is probably the safest way to go.

The rest of the IDE cable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: SET THE JUMPERS BEFORE YOU DO THIS !!!

Right, this is the tricky bit ... you need to remove the 3.5" connector
nearest to the connector that goes into the 1200's IDE connector .. plug
the end into the first HD. Now put the second one on top of it and tape
both the HD's together. Make a mark with a pencil or sommit on the cable. 
Be sure to leave enuff room for the connector. Now take the cable off again
and attach the connector you just took off to where your pencil mark is. 
There should not be any slack on the cable between the HD's (or CD Rom and
HD, whichever). Make sure the connector is on the cable properly (its a right
bugger to get on). Attach to your HD's or HD and CD Rom.

CD Roms
~~~~~~~
You make the IDE cable the same way, but make sure the CD Rom is set to be the
slave. Power is also the same.

The power cable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll need the normall HD power cable (but you wont need to do anything to
this). Basicly, what we're gonna do is make a power splitter.

Get the disk drive power converter and chop off the disk drive side, leaving
plenty of wire. Solder both the power connector's leads to the wire on the 
disk drive power converter thing. Make sure you get the right pins!

You should now be able to connect the single end one to the current power
connector inside your miggy and the other 2 should connect to your HD's ok.

Final words ...
