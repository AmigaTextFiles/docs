You can actually make your SmartMedia incombatible with your
other hardware.

I used this software only for reading photos that I had taken
with my Fujifilm FinePix 4700Zoom. At 20-08-2001 I wrote empty
(0xFF) bytes all over my 16MB SmartMedia. Then I wrote some
files to it and read them back to my Amiga. Files were same as
before. Then I put the SmartMedia to my digicam. 
Digicam said "!CARD ERROR" and digicam didn't format the card.
Yes, then I thought that I'll write a whole original FAT12-image 
back to the SmartMedia, but I had cleaned all those images
out of my harddrives. So now I have 16MB SmartMedia that I can
use to backup some important files.. urgh, I still prefer my
PlexWriter to do that kind of things..

You have been warned, you should only use this software to
read SmartMedia, it is safe as long your hardware is ok.
