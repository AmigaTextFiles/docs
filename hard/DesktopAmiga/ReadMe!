 Type: hard/hack
 Requirements: Any AGA Amiga with 2 Meg Chip ram.



 This slideshow is a short guide on converting your A1200 to a Desktop Amiga.
 The aim of the project was to acquire a big power supply,and extra drive
 bays as cheaply as possible.The case and keyboard might be obtained as
 scrap items but you will still need a keyboard interface (cheapest £25)
 and for reliability an IDE buffered interface (cheapest £30)if you wish
 to use a cheap IDE CD-ROM (£20 upwards).


 This slideshow was created using DPaint and Scala to run just click on the
 DesktopBuilding icon.

 I am 11 years old and struggling with the finer points of Blitz Basic .
 You are welcome to this pitiful effort ,but I take no responsibility for
 for any software/hardware that you own!!
