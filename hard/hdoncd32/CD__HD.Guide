          This text explains how to connect a 3.5"IDE  Hard disk on
     a CD-32 with the SX-1 expansion. Please read carefully all the 
     docs,`cause i don`t care if you
     blow up your (lovely) machine (see @{" Disclaimer " LINK Disclaimer}).

I TAKE NO RESPONSABILITY FOR ANY CRASHED HARD DISK OR COMPUTER DAMAGE.WHAT
WENT WELL FOR ME MAY BE FAULT FOR YOU, SO IF YOU FOLLOW PERFECTLY MY WORDS
YOU PROBABLY WILL MAKE YOUR HD WORKING WITHIN HALF AN HOUR, BUT IF YOU DO A
MISTAKE YOU RISK TO BLOW UP YOUR HD.

Hi, I`m a 18 years italian student, I really LOVE my Amiga, its OS 
and all the beautiful things it can do.I like hearing music, in particular 
Michael Jackson (see my MJCover picture on Aminet pix/art/HISTORY.LHA,soon
to be uploaded),I LOVE my girlfriend (Ciao Ramona!!), and my 20 years old
motorbyke.....

OK,here I am:

@NODE Needs "What you need"

Ok,let`s see what we`ll need...
To connect the HD you have to find or build an IDE flat cable.See on Aminet
(IDE2Ami or something like this) to find how to build one that fits on the
internal 2.5" connector on a side and on the 3.5"HD connector on the other.
Anyway you can use the external SX-1 IDE port, but it should be made by hand,
while a cable is easy to find or to build. 
To do the power cable for the HD you will need:
a male  DB23 (to plug in floppy disk port) connector
a 4 poles standard HD-Power connector
a soldering iron and the needed stuff
(Note: you can easily find many A1200 internal HD kits that give you the IDE
cable and an internal floppy power-doubler who gives power from motherboard
to internal drive and to HD: you can adapt this cable buying only the DB23
connector)

@NODE Mounting "Ok,let`s go!!!"

Well, first open the SX-1 unit by using a normal #1 Philips screwdriver and
localize the ide pins on the left.Connect the flat-cable and let it go out
of the board ,then close the case, without screwing too tightly the left
side.Now connect the HD.Put the HD in a box to protect it from dust (i used
a videotape box,so use your inventive...).Now if you have a high-powered
PC :-( power supply unit (like me :-)) (look for the hack on aminet) you
can connect one of PSU HD outputs and go...if you haven`t one you must build
a @{" power cable " LINK Cable}

@NODE Cable "How to build a power cable"



Hard disks use the same voltage of floppy drives, so we can get the power
from the floppy port.Make sure your external drive is a pass-trough one,but
almost every drive (except old Commodore ones) is pass-trough.So you can
plug the drive connector on SX-1 and the cable of the port for DF1: on the
drive itself.Now start to warm up your soldering iron....
Examine the connector:on Amiga the pin12 provides +5V, the pin23 provides
+12V, pin3-7 provide the ground. Now solder the cables on these four pins
using the scheme below:

               ____________
              /            \\
             |  O  O  O  O  |
             |__|__|__|__|__|
                |  |  |  |
               /   |  |   \\
              /   GND GND  \\
          pin23            pin12 
         (+12V)             (+5V)

Note that usually the GROUND wires are BLACK, the +12V are YELLOW, the +5V
are RED.If something is different, STOP NOW, and check that you soldered
right.
Now DOUBLE CHECK the connections and plug the connector in the HD socket.
Now turn on the CD-32.The HD should start to spin up, if you can hear it,
everything went well,and now you can partition and format it.If it doesn`t
spin up you hopefully forgot to connect the IDE cable,if not, probably your
HD is now dead (I TOLD you to check the wires!!!!!!)

@NODE Problems "Have you got problems ? Read Here..."

Ok...what`s your problem ?

Q.-I followed instructions, done all prep job on HD, but it doesn`t boot from
cold (it means when you turn on your computer the first time).

A.-The drive simply hasn`t got the time to reach the right spinning speed in
time to boot.The SX-1 has an internal jumper to delay of 10 secs the boot.
Look on the board an turn on the jumper marked "Power On Delay"


Q.-Everything goes right, but sometimes system crashes in a GURU without
reason.

A.-If this happens when both HD and drive or either CD-ROM are on,you
probably need a new PSU,try disconnecting drive (don`t forget the HD power
cable...)


Q.-Everything LOOKS right, but as I write on the HD, the mouse pointer
freezes and the system stops.When I reboot, the HD reports errors or
become invalid.

A.-This may happen with some hard disks (on my Seagate it happened..),if
your HD locks when writing on it, you can solve the problems in two ways:

1)Download from Aminet the IDEFix CD-Rom package, in the "C" directory you
will find two commands: IDEFix and LoadIDE.Adding one of these in the first
line of you startup-sequence should solve your problem (note that the two
programs are the same, but LoadIDE stays resident after the reboots), but
do not forget to launch IDEFix when booting from disk or without startup-
sequence.
2)Go to ftp.amiga.de/pub/Public/PublicBETA and download the new "scsi.device" and
install it. After, the HD should not lock anymore.

@NODE Thanx "My thanx goes to..."

My thanks go to:

- Paravision for providing a good device like the SX-1 (even with some
  little bug ;-))

- Zapek for mailing me about the new scsi.device and for the debug under 3.1 AGuide

- Oliver Kastle for the useful IDEFix package

- Diego De Felice for the first upload
