Do you have a new Amiga 1200 of Amiga Technologies and do you wonder
why some software doesn't work on your machine, but does so on older
Amiga 1200s? - Then this fixpack is for you!

It's because AT had to use PC-drives, as the original Amiga-drives
aren't manufactured anymore. :(
Those PC-drives lack a signal older Amiga-drives always had; this
signal is called _RDY and indicates that the selected drive has spinned
up and is now ready to read/write to the floppy.
Amiga OS never needed this signal, but as it was documented, some games
and even XCopy Pro wait for it - and are waiting forever, cause it never
will become active!

I've designed a small schematic to set the missing _RDY-signal after
_MTR0 and _SEL0 have become active.
In original Amiga-drives, this happens after about 500-600 ms, so
some adjustment is nescessary, but I'll come to this later on...

The file 'schematic.iff' shows - surprise - the schematic.
'CircuitBoard.iff' shows how to assemble the components
(note: you have to open your Amiga so you might lose the warranty!)
I think the drawing is sufficient so there's no need for more information...

Caution:
I won't take any responsibility for anything if you turn your Amiga into
a fireworks! Do it at your own risk!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've built in the hack, you have to adjust the delay time with
resistor P1.
Start 'A1200FDtest' to see the current delay and adjust P1 till the delay
has got a level of approximately 0.5 s.
OK, that's it! Now everything which works on an old Amiga 1200 should work
on yours, too!

Psst: There are rumors about AT, working on an own - more elegant - patch.
So if my hack doesn't satify you, just wait for the professional
patch coming out...

Thanx go to my beloved one, Katja, for her help in english, Dr. Peter Kittel
for his information about facts, Thomas Peuss and Toni Pomar for his idea
(see hard/hack/Floppy_fix.lha)
