<a name=summon>
<font size=+1 color=red>Summon your people</FONT>
<p>
The first task you must learn is that of commanding your people to leave a building. This is done
in two main ways. The easiest method is using the Quick Orders panel. You can call up this panel
by clicking in an empty space in the play area. The Quick Orders panel will show you how many
spare people you have in your Store. Selecting one of these people will command that character
to leave his home and walk to your chosen location.
<P>
Another way to command a person to leave a building is via the Occupants panel. You can call
this panel up by selecting the same building twice.  The Occupants panel will provide you with a
simple list of the people in the current building and it is possible to select any one of these and
command him to leave using the leave icon.
<P>

<a name=build>
<font size=+1 color=red>Create a new building</FONT>
<P>

<P>
Creating buildings is quick an easy. You must first choose a suitable location on the play area.
The first click will bring up the Quick Orders panel but a second click with bring up the Choose
Building Panel.  You must have enough of the necessary resources to be able to select a building
and you must be in a valid location. The Mine for example must be on high ground where the
rock landscape is found. The Pump House building must be built where the ground is soft. You
can't build in areas that are not fully explored. In some cases it is possible to reserve your
building even if there is insufficient resources.
<P>
One you have chosen a building to create you will be given a Foundation and a Wizard will soon
arrive to Magic the building in place. If you do not have enough Magic in storage then this stage
will be have to be delayed.
<P>

<a name=food>
<font size=+1 color=red>Food and health</FONT>
<p>
You will have to provide enough food for you people and you must also ensure that there is a
good variety. It has already been mentioned that those Peasants working in the mine will require
a different diet to the Scientists working in the laboratory.  The Storage buildings usually contain
the full range of food and it is usually in plenty supply but other buildings have a limited menu.
If your people become unhealthy they will not reproduce and they will become easy targets for
attackers.  If they become too unhappy then they may start to disobey orders and generally
become inefficient and worthless.  This it is not essential to provide a full range of food it is
recommended to attempt to supply as much as you can whenever possible.
<P>

<a name=guards>
<font size=+1 color=red>Guards</FONT>
<p>
Every building will contain at least one space for a Guard.  It is good to keep someone guarding
your buildings because without a guard you are open for an easy takeover.  Without a guard it is
possible for an enemy team to enter the building at will.  When there are enemy people in the
building it usually turns into a fight and the strongest group will take control.  While you
building is guarded you are still subject to thieves.
<P>

<a name=magic>
<font size=+1 color=red>More Magic</FONT>
<p>
The Magic is a useful element in the world of Foundation.  It is not only the commonly used
system of building but it is also used for landscaping.  When you advanced your technology
to a good level you'll be given extra Wizard Spells. These spells will allow your wizard to
summon extra rocks and trees. These trees and rocks can be scattered about the land for the
Forester and Stone Mason to collect. The rocks are a good source of Coal and Ore but the most
common rocks are made of pure Stone. Extra Magic must be created using the Crematorium. This
special building will turn the last remains of your people into fresh Magic.  This gives you an
almost endless supply of Magic to last you for as long as you continue to have a population.
<P>

<a name=control>
<font size=+1 color=red>Control your people</FONT>
<p>
The control system for organizing your people and issuing commands is a very simple one but
from a simple method you have a very complex array of commands ready for controlling your
populous.
<P>
The first lesson to learn is the select.  This is done by clicking the mouse in an empty area of the
world with thew Left Mouse Button and dragging the pointer across the View area to form a box
on the screen.  Any people that were inside the box during hat time will become selected and
they will form a group.  Another trick to learn is the SHIFT select option which will allow you to
add more people to the group.
<P>
Now you have a group selected you are able to issue commands.  The most basic of these is the
MOVE command.  The MOVE command is issued using the Right Mouse Button to click in an
area on the playfield.  Now your whole group will start their journey to your selected location.
When they arrive you will see they are waiting for your next command.  The MOVE command is
the most useful command of them all.  It gives you the power to command any of your people
to go to any valid destination including buildings.  If you send a person into a building it will
then become his home.  This is where he will stay until you command him to another place.  If
this building is a production building (for example a Mine) then he will start to work there.  This
is where he will spend the rest of his days unless you command him to move somewhere else.
<P>

<a name=fight>
<font size=+1 color=red>Fighting</FONT>
<p>
The fighting side of the game works in the same way as all other control features. You simply
select a group or a single fighting unit and command them to attack. Selecting one Soldier with
the left mouse button and selecting an enemy building with the right mouse button will send the
Soldier into attack. Selecting a group of Soldiers with the drag technique and then selecting an
enemy Soldier with the right button will command your group to attach the single Soldier. This
simple point and click technique is used for all battle commands.
<P>

<a name=dropped>
<font size=+1 color=red>Dropped Resources</FONT>
<P>
At the start of each game thre will be various resource items scattered about the
land. You will also notice resources are left/dropped on he ground after a death.
A soldier may leave some Armour on the ground, a Peasant may leave some carried objects
on the ground and quite often people will leave a cross behing after death. These items
may be collected by commanding a Peasant to walk to that exact location. The easiest
method is to select the location with the mouse revealing the `Quick Orders' Panel and
then command a single Peasant to come to that location. When the Peasant collects the
element, he will take it to the most suitable building.
