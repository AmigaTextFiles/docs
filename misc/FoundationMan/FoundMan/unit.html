<EM><font size=+2 color="#FF0000">Unit Description:</FONT></EM>

<P>

People/Units are split into two groups, Working Units and Fighting Units.

<P>

<EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Peasant</FONT></EM>
<P>
This is your most important Unit. The Peasant can be used in many tasks such as mining, fishing
and farming. They are used to transport resources about your land. The Peasant can take on most
jobs in your kingdom and once trained they can be upgraded to higher level Units. A good
supply of Peasants in your Storage buildings will play a big part in a successful game.
<P>

<EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Maiden</FONT></EM>
<P>
Another important Unit. Without the Maiden your people cannot reproduce and your numbers
will soon shrink. The Maiden provides you with fresh blood and a good supply of Maidens is
needed in order for you to generate a large healthy band of people. For your people to breed
and reproduce you will need to give them some privacy. The Headquarters is not the best place
to raise a family but it is possible. The newborn people in the world of Foundation have the
ability to work in the same way as the older people.  In the world of Foundation you take on the
character rather than the character taking on you.

<P><EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Wizard</FONT></EM>
<P>
The Wizards are highly trained in the use of Magic. For many years they have replaced the
Peasants skills in the area of Building and transforming the land. With a good supply of magic
they can provide you with all the buildings you require. You still have to provide the necessary
resources but the use of Magic has speeded up the building process and indeed the removal of
buildings.

<P><EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Scientist</FONT></EM>
<P>
Without science you cannot expand your technologies and your enemies will soon surpass your
knowledge. With a good team of scientists you can create a flow of fresh ideas that will keep you
ahead of the opposition.  Scientists are also the key to discovering cures to any health problems
that can arise with overcrowding and the problems of war.

<P><EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Soldier/Guard</FONT></EM>
<P>
Every building in your land will have room for at least one Guard. If you have a guard in a
building it will protect you from attacks. When the guard has served enough time and he has
proved himself in his work he will be promoted to a Knight.

<P><EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Knight</FONT></EM>
<P>
The knight is a powerful fighter. He is strong and brave but he is not happy to be reduced to the
lower ranks of a Guard. He will happily serve to your demands on the battlefield and after he has
reached a high level of experience he will be promoted to Black Knight.

<P><EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Black Knight</FONT></EM>
<P>
The strongest of all fighting units. He will usually survive until his days are over and he has the
power to protect himself from most attackers. He is immune to the arrows of the archer and it is
rare for a Peasant to approach him.

<P><EM><font size=+1 color="#FF0000">The Archer</FONT></EM>
<P>
The archers like to keep away from trouble but if you give them enough distance they can take
out targets quickly and safely. Being a cowardly group they enjoy nothing more than to live in
the safety of the Archers Tower where they are safe from even the weakest of peasant attackers.<P>
