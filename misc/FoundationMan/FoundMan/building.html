<font size=5 color=red>HeadQuarters</FONT><br>
<img src="gifs/bld_HQ.gif" width=95 height=96 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Storage/HQ.<br>
<font colour=green>Stores: </font> Everything.<br>
The Headquarters is used as storage for resources and people. It is also the home of your good
self so it is important that you protect it against the enemy. Storage space is limited so you will
probably need at least one Warehouse to store a large bulk of your goods. If this building is lost
the game is over - so guard it well!
<P clear=left>

<font size=5 color=red>Warehouse</FONT><br>
<img src="gifs/bld_Warehouse.gif" width=96 height=96 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Storage.<br>
<font colour=green>Stores: </font> Everything.<br>
This is a very important building. Without the Warehouse you may find that resources and people
are delayed in the process of leaving your Headquarters. Don't underestimate the usefulness of
this Building.

<a name=mine>
<font size=5 color=red>Mine</FONT><br>
<img src="gifs/bld_Mine.gif" width=85 height=82 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_stone.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_ore.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_coal.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_oil.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
This is an important building for the collection of Stone, Ore, Coal and Oil. A good production
of Ore is needed to create Gold for wealth. A good production of Ore is also the key to producing
Steel. You will need a good supply of Oil to fund Research and a good supply of Stone is always
required as it is the main building material.
<P clear=left>


<a name=farm>
<font size=5 color=red>Farmhouse</FONT><br>
<img src="gifs/bld_Farm.gif" width=96 height=91 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_wheat.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_fruit.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_veg.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
Important building for the creation of Wheat, Fruit and Vegetables. This should be one of the
first buildings to be built. The Farmhouse will supply the most basic food supply which is
needed in most buildings and a good supply of Wheat is used for the Bakery and Brewery buildings.
<P clear=left>

<a name=armoury>
<font size=5 color=red>Armoury</FONT><br>
<img src="gifs/bld_Armoury.gif" width=94 height=95 align=left>

<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_armour.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The place where your Steel is turned into Armour which is the important resource of War.
<P clear=left>

<a name=pump>
<font size=5 color=red>Pump House</FONT><br>
<img src="gifs/bld_PumpHouse.gif" width=70 height=94 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_water.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The Water source. Water is needed for drinking and well as various production buildings. Without
a good supply of water you will have many health problems.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Wizard Hut</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_WizardsHut.gif width=80 height=83 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Home.<br>
This building will become useful when your land expands. It allows you to place Wizards closer to
your expanding areas. Wizards are also required for the extinguishing of fires so be sure to
have Wizards available throughout your settlement.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Peasant Hut</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_PeasantHut.gif width=88 height=74 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Home.<br>
A nice peaceful building which gives the Maidens the privacy they need and it also stops the
Headquarters from becoming too overcrowded. Population reproduction rates can be raised by
building Peasant Huts.
<P clear=left>

<a name=forester>
<font size=5 color=red>Foresters Hut</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Forester.gif width=77 height=72 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_wood.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The source of your wood collection. Your forester will happily collect up the wood from the
surrounding trees. As the wood is collected it is also distributed about the local buildings.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Stone Mason</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_StoneMason.gif width=92 height=85 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_stone.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_coal.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_ore.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The Stone mason will search the land for rocks. This is probably the best source of stone you will
have. Many rocks will contain Coal and Ore. This is a good way to collect resources when there
are no available mining areas.
<P clear=left>


<a name=refinery>
<font size=5 color=red>Refinery</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Refinary.gif width=87 height=79 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_coal.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_ore.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_gold.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_steel.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
This is yet another important building where your Ore is refined to become Gold and Steel. Gold is always
needed to fund repairs, pay for buildings and for training training new units. Steel is also a popular
building material as well as the necessary resource for creating Armour. Without a Refinary you will
have very little use for Ore.

<a name=fishery>
<font size=5 color=red>Fishery</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Fishery.gif width=95 height=96 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_fish.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The Fishery must be built close to the sea or lakes. The Fishery will not provide a lot of fish but it
is important to provide a wide range of food. This building is not avilable in the Lava regions because
thre are no Fish to be found in the Lava lakes.
<P clear=left>


<a name=crematorium>
<font size=5 color=red>Crematorium</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Crematorium.gif width=86 height=89 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_cross.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_magic.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
This is where the last remains of your people (the Cross) can be refined to become a single
element of Magic. The magic is then used to aid you in future developments an as a part of
ongoing repairs.
<P clear=left>


<a name=lab>
<font size=5 color=red>Laboratory</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Laboratory.gif width=77 height=73 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Special Building/Research.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_oil.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_idea.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The important base for advancing technology.  This is where your Scientist will be housed and
provided with the resources to develop new technologies and any other helpful advances to aid
you on your mission.
<P clear=left>


<a name=bakery>
<font size=5 color=red>Bakery</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Bakery.gif width=96 height=96 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_water.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_wheat.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_bread.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
This is where the Bread is formed from the Wheat and Water. While it is possible to live without
the Bread it is worth providing it to improve the diet of your people. The Bread is even more
important when fresh Fish in unavailable.
<P clear=left>


<a name=brewery>
<font size=5 color=red>Brewery</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Brewery.gif width=95 height=95 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Inout:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_water.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_wheat.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_wine.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
The Wine is not the most healthy food source but it helps to keep your people happy. It is
possible to live without this Food type but if your Population get unhappy you may be forced to
provide them with this building.
<P clear=left>


<a name=factory>
<font size=5 color=red>Food Factory</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_FoodFactory.gif width=96 height=82 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Production.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_gold.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
<font colour=green>Output:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_meat.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_wine.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_fish.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_bread.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_veg.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_fruit.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
Modern day living has inspired the use of a simple approach to creating food. This is the easiest
way to provide a good range of food but it is also the most expensive method so keep a watch
on your Gold supplies.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Barracks</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Barracks.gif width=92 height=94 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Special Building/Training.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_gold.gif" width=11 height=12>
<img src="gifs/elem_armour.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
This is where you will train your Peasants to become other Units.  You can train a Peasant to
become a Guard at the cost of one Gold and one Armour.  You can also train a Peasant to
become Scientist or a Wizard at the cost of one Gold.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Hospital</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_Hospital.gif width=84 height=89 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Special Building/Storage/Health.<br>
<font colour=green>Stores: </font> People/Food.<br>
The Hospital works in a similar way to the Warehouse. It acts as a storage of people and food.
There are some important differences. The healthy living will allow your people to recover health
quickly. If you have many Peasants in the Hospital and you request for a Peasant to leave the
building then the most healthy Peasant will leave first. Any time during the game you find a sick
person you should always send him/her to the Hospital to recover.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Gun Tower</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_guntower.gif width=68 height=67 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Fort.<br>
<font colour=green>Input:</font>
<img src="gifs/elem_stone.gif" width=11 height=12>
<br>
This is one of the offensive buildings.  When the building houses a Guard and a supply of Stone
you will see the Tower appear. The Tower will automatically aim at any enemy building or Unit
that is in range.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>Other Storage Buildings</FONT><br>
<img src=gifs/bld_OtherStorage.gif width=96 height=67 align=left>
<font colour=green>Class: </font> Storage.<br>
You will develop more storage buildings that will help to distribute materials and food. The Food
Store building will allow you to store large amounts of food where it is needed. The Water Tower
will allow you to store Water where it is needed. These buildings don't seem very useful at first
but the use of specialised buildings will lower the traffic problems caused by a large network of
buildings controlled by a few storage buildings.
<P clear=left>


<font size=5 color=red>More Buildings</FONT><br>
Your scientists will invent more buildings. It is your duty to discover these yourself. In future
Conquest packs there will be additional buildings and more technologies to develop.
