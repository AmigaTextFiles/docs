 @{b}@{u}Introduction@{uu}@{ub}

  People complain that Amiga companies do not know what the Amiga users want,
 well, this file is there to solve just this problem as well as to give
 software/hardware developers future ideas.  Now there is no real
 excuse for any Amiga company to NOT comply with the users' demands.  Some
 people say it's a bit selfish doing this, but what people must realize is
 that the Amiga users left are not stupid, they are professionals when it
 comes to the Amiga and who else knows better what the new Amigas should do 
 but the Amiga public who has been using them for up to 10 - 11 years!
 This guide is basically a giant wish list for the new Amigas, however it
 also shows what ideas Amiga users have an possibly some new areas for Amiga
 software/hardware to develop in.

  This guide is not a press release, or anything official, it is what users
 want to happen, not what WILL happen.  This was produced separate to Amiga
 International and any other Amiga company.

  This guide assumes that 24bit Graphics and 16bit Sound are standard and
 should not have to be repeated.

 All Hardware and Software is Copyright their makers...

 @{b}@{u}Authors@{uu}@{ub}

  This guide is compiled with the help of the Undernet @{b}#Amiga@{ub} and
 @{b}#AmigaCafe@{ub} channels.  I realize that not all of this is accepted by all
 users, that would be impossible to accomplish, but any difference in
 opinion is mentioned and detailed.

  This guide was compiled by Me, Wayne Martin (TB).  I have been using
 Amigas right from the start back in the mid 80's and have loved them ever
 since.  However, I also have used MACs and PCs as well and even so, I know
 that the idea behind the Amiga is just so far superior.  I started making
 this guide after a few people requested my opinion on the Amigas current
 situation, they liked, I liked, the guide was made.  I was sick and tired
 of not having my say, and this is somewhat of an attempt to correct that.
 However, this is not just my say, but anyone who wishes to send me
 comments.

  We want @{b}YOUR@{ub} support and ideas to help us make a better example
 of what the Amiga users world-wide want.  If you have any ideas, suggestions 
 or comments, please mail them to me at @{b}martinwa@geocities.com@{ub}.
 Please also state if I can add your nick/alias to the file to show your
 support.

  @{fg highlight}http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~chayne/amitng@{fg text}

  The format of the online version has changed from HTML to AmigaGuide for
  now, however I do wish to put a HTML version on again.  As well as the
  AmigaGuide version there is also the release archive in LZX and LHA
  formats for you to download.  Chances are that updates will be here first
  rather than on Aminet.

  For the AmigaGuide version, look on Aminet in docs/misc where updates
  will be uploaded.

@NODE "AmiDont" "What Amiga Users Don't Want"
@font xen.font 8

 @{b}@{u}What Amiga Users Don't Want@{uu}@{ub}

  This section is here to show what the average Amiga user does @{b}NOT@{ub}
 want in the new Amigas, no matter who makes them.  Amiga users are smart
 and know what is needed to make the Amiga regain its place in the computing
 world.

 The following is not wanted:

@{b}o@{ub} The DEC Alpha, or other DEC Chips.  The majority of Amiga users
  believe the future is with the PowerPC family of chips, however, if we 
  'HAVE' to use DEC chips, an @{"emulation" Link "AmiEmul"} solution for 3.1- 
  code must be made.

@{b}o@{ub} No p-OS or BeOS, we want AmigaOS.  p-OS is little more than OS 3.1 
  with KingCON, MCP and CyberGFX running.  BeOS may be a fine OS, but it's 
  not OUR OS. Of course if the choice came up for p-OS or BeOS, BeOS would
  win hands down.  @{fg highlight}@{i}As they days have passed since this 
  file was released on Aminet, more and more people have written to me saying 
  they agree, they don't want to see p-OS in any Amiga or Amiga clone machine.
  And now even phase5 has said that they would never use pOS in the A\Box
  from its lack of features.@{ui}@{fg text}

@{b}o@{ub} No PeeCee Generic SVGA GFX cards, we want a custom chipset that can 
  actually do things like scroll 2D smooth unlike SVGA cards.  We shouldn't 
  have to give up our wonderful scrolling abilities for so called progress.

@{b}o@{ub} No Soundblaster!  We know for a fact that the Soundblaster's sound is 
  way to substandard to be used in a machine like the Amiga.

@{b}o@{ub} No Advertising saying 'The Amiga is a great games machine', Look
  what happened last time they did that.  Well, not without a lot of
  business advertising to counter act.

@{b}o@{ub} No connection in anyway to MicroSoft.

 @{b}So, do you have any comments or anything you want added?

@NODE "Ami1200" "1200/4000 Re-release"
@font xen.font 8

 @{b}@{u}1200/4000 Re-Release@{uu}@{ub}

  Once Amiga International has been re-started, one quick source of income
 could be the re-release of the 1200 and 4000(T).  If such a thing is
 attempted, the machines would have to be released fast but still taking
 as much advantage of the current OS and Architecture.  However, small
 updates could be done to make sure these machines are used to their best
 possible productivity.  @{fg highlight}@{i}This doesn't mean we want the 1200/4000 to be
 re-released, this section was made to cover one of the many possibilties.@{ui}@{fg text}

 @{b}@{u}Updates in OS 3.1@{uu}@{ub}

  Small changes must be made to 3.1 if it is to be used in the 1200/4000 for
 new production.  These changes should take no more than a month to make so
 would be a benefit to attempt. The majority of code for these changes is
 now in existence and is freely available:

@{b}o@{ub} Setpatch 43.5+ should be included into to the OS to fix/add already 
  known code.

@{b}o@{ub} Simple things such as 'NoClick' 'Filter off' 'Border Blanker' and 'Wildcard'
  must be added to provide what is thought as standard and yet not in the OS.
  Or, at least added to the Setpatch.  The interface to these functions
  could be added to already existing Prefs programs as some users may not want
  these functions as default.

@{b}o@{ub} A collection of datatypes should be included, especially if the machine
  is to be 'Internet ready'.  Datatypes such as GIF/JFIF/PNG/WAV/VOC/BMP/-
  MPEG/MPI-II-III etc etc. should all be standard.

@{b}o@{ub} A simple sample player supporting datatypes should be included.

@{b}o@{ub} The commands 'LoadWB' 'Assign' 'Copy' 'Dir' should all be added into the
  ROM, with the fall back available if those commands appear in C:.  This
  would increase booting speed and overall usability.  'LoadWB' is a MUST
  to add, it's stupid how you can not load your WB if that small command is
  not there.

@{b}o@{ub} New FFS 43.11+ should come standard.

@{b}o@{ub} A 'Newshell' should be opened on 'Boot With No Start-up-Sequence' in
  stead of the enhanced CLI thus instantly providing 'copy and paste' as well as
  other features.

@{b}o@{ub} Fixes for the problem that occur when using High Density Disks.

@{b}o@{ub} When the menu item 'ROM Wack' is selected, a requestor should appear
  asking if the user wishes to continue.

@{b}o@{ub} Any optimizations to known ROM routines should be added, such as GFX
  routines.  Possibly even total ROM optimization for the CPU the machine
  is provided with, e.g. ROM 020+ for 1200, ROM 040+ 4000.  This would
  allow speed increases where ever possible.

@{b}o@{ub} More printer drivers with OS.

@{b}o@{ub} Optimized serial.device, possibly Separate mode for 8N1
  transfers.

@{b}o@{ub} Multiple monitor drivers sorted into monitor types, e.g. a set of monitor
  drivers for the 1942/1940, one set for Generic Multiscan etc etc.

@{b}o@{ub} IPrefs updated to allow PICs to be stored in Fast ram.

@{b}o@{ub} On Booting, the 'Boot Menu' should be able to be accessed via the
  keyboard and not just the mouse, e.g. Space Key.

  @{b}@{u}Hardware Updates@{uu}@{ub}

  Small bugs known to exist in AGAs architecture could be fixed or at least
 tweaked quickly to allow the most use from it's dated architecture.  Most,
 if not all hardware changes exist and are documented.

@{b}o@{ub} Chip ram could be accelerated, even if only by 5%, the faster the
  Chip ram speed, the more benefits higher CPU uses will get, such as
  increased GFX speed.

@{b}o@{ub} At least one SIMM socket on the MB, this would help with cheap 
  upgrading.

@{b}o@{ub} A minimum of 2megs Chip ram, 4megs Fast ram, 8megs Fast ram would 
  be preferred.

@{b}o@{ub} FPU sockets for machines that do not have an FPU on-board.

@{b}o@{ub} A clock, simple as it sounds, the raw 1200 does not have one.

@{b}o@{ub} If possible, a high-density disk drive.

@{b}o@{ub} 3 Button / Hi-res mouse as standard.

@{b}o@{ub} More powerful PSU with the 1200.

 @{b}So, do you have any comments or anything you want added?

@NODE "AmiNewOS" "Features Of The New OS"
@font xen.font 8

 @{b}@{u}Features Of The New OS@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}o@{ub} All features mentioned in the @{"1200/4000" Link "Ami1200"} section at least 
  should be added.

@{b}o@{ub} The obvious things such as 'Networking' 'Memory Protection' 'Virtual
  Memory' 'Resource-Tracking' 'Task-Pausing' 'Multi-Threaded'.  @{fg highlight}@{i}Some
  people however are opposed to this, read more in the @{"Emulation" Link "AmiEmul"} 
  section@{ui}@{fg text} 

@{b}o@{ub} KingCON-like features such as name completion, and scroll buffers in
  Shell.  This should also be user configurable via Prefs.

@{b}o@{ub} New FileSystem allowing more characters in draw, file, and device names.
  More crash protection for drives and higher partition limits, e.g. 1 terabyte.
  Also, multi-user support possibly via flags.

@{b}o@{ub} Unicode support, which will become more important in the future.

@{b}o@{ub} Auto-Shut-Down modes aswell as "Sleep" modes to reduced power
  useage, handy for laptops as well as desk based machines.  This includes
  Power Saving features in monitors.

@{b}o@{ub} Auto detection of 'wide' monitors. e.g Turn monitor on side it
  Auto Detects this and adjusts the display to match, similar to MAC.

@{b}o@{ub} Multi Input System, e.g. multiple mice, monitors, keyboards, er
  with more than 1 Amiga in a box.

@{b}o@{ub} More screenmodes for use with multimedia of the 90's, such as
  HDTV modes etc.

@{b}o@{ub} The ability to pause tasks, possibly via a gadget.

@{b}o@{ub} Ability to Minimize/Iconify/Menuify windows and screens.

@{b}o@{ub} Ability to move certain windows to other screens. e.g. Shell,
  output windows and requesters.

@{b}o@{ub} Ability to read/write MS-DOS disks in ROM including the
  Windows95 256 char name filesystem (Also new Win97 format?).

@{b}o@{ub} Executive/Unix type system management, configurable.

@{b}o@{ub} An MUI 'like' GUI that is configurable as well as functional.
  Auto scaling, re-mapping etc.

@{b}o@{ub} User definable 'Dock' like function, allowing things such as copy,
  delete, unarchive etc.

@{b}o@{ub} System Automatically detects version numbers of files and advises before
  old file is copied over new file.

@{b}o@{ub} The OS delete functions should display more information on the File/Draw
  before you delete it.  Things like File size, Flags, Filetype (Via
  datatypes), Compression type, Current Network Status etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Requesters when doing certain WB functions, such as Copy and Delete.
  e.g. Percentage, estimated time to finish, cps (Useful for Network
  functions).

@{b}o@{ub} Automatic system updating. e.g. File added to HD0:, all things displaying
  the HD0: file list should be updated to show new file.

@{b}o@{ub} Default font not topaz (or other ROM font) but Prefs assigned font.

@{b}o@{ub} Gurus that tell you what happened in English! (or whatever language you
  speak :)).  Things such as what task, was a file missing?, what drives will be
  effected? Will these drives be unvalidated?

@{b}o@{ub} WB should be configuarable, e.g. hotkeys etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Better WB execute command, name completion, requester selection, scroll back
  buffer.

@{b}o@{ub} ARexx integrated Shell/WB.  ARexx should be running ALWAYS.

@{b}o@{ub} ARexx interface to Workbench/Shell e.g. OpenWindow, OpenShell.

@{b}o@{ub} All Maths Libs should use external Maths Prefs.  e.g. Prefs set Maths
  Libs to use PPC, or if you have a 'FPU accelerator card' you can select the Maths
  Libs to do calculations using that.

@{b}o@{ub} New ASL system, allowing at least all the options of the current ReqTools.

@{b}o@{ub} Workbench defaults to MOVE and not COPY when drag'n'dropping
  icons even if over to other devices, however a qualifier such as shift can
  be used to make this COPY.

@{b}o@{ub} Configurable hotkey for selecting multiple files, e.g. configure it just
  to dragging a box around the icons, and then dragging a single file, like the
  Macintosh.

@{b}o@{ub} Proper multiple assign system, e.g. Assign HELLO: HD0:Yay/
  HD1:Yay/.  This would come in handy for doing things like going "Dir
  HELLO:", and this should not just display the first assign, but all the
  assigned dirs.  Also, if "Dir HELLO:Yay/" was typed, it should dir both
  the dirs contained inside each assign.

@{b}o@{ub} Addition to the paste and cut system to work like PowerSnap
  allowing text from gadgets etc to be pasted etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Option so that when you open a drawer, its parent drawers window
  is shut, and also the other way round.  Configurable via prefs, e.g. If
  on or off by default and what key toggles it or temp disables it.

 @{b}So, do you have any comments or anything you want added?

@NODE "AmiPrefs" "New OS Prefs Features"
@font xen.font

 @{b}@{u}New OS Prefs Features@{uu}@{ub}

  The issue of the TNG Amigas Prefs seem to be great enough to make its own
 section. I believe that all Prefs should be kept in one program or at least
 in a smaller number than we have now.  Also, all Prefs should be accessed
 and running from 'Boot with no Start-up'.

@{b}o@{ub} Totally re-done Workbench Serial Prefs.  All programs using Serial should
  use these Prefs instead of having their own interface.  In this new serial
  Prefs, you should be able to pick what driver you want, see some
  statistics on the driver (e.g. Speed, Baud).  Also, this should also
  apply to nullmodem preferences.  Baud rates above 115,200 should be
  supported.

@{b}o@{ub} New Font Prefs allowing new attributes to fonts such as outline, more
  configurable Screen font that can have different styles.  Also new formats of Font
  should be supported.

@{b}o@{ub} Control system allowing the setting for Voice Regonition
  commands and functions.  E.g. By saying "Amiga On!" the system resumes
  function from stand by mode.

@{b}o@{ub} Screen Blanking/Mouse Blanking should now be a part of Prefs, complete
  with sun mouse option for those who use them.  Also this should include
  things like Click to front etc etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Some prefs system for Digital Camera systems.

@{b}o@{ub} GUI Prefs should now be included with the OS.  Buttons, menus, Intuition
  gadgets/slider, Window style, Cycle gadgets, Cycle menus, Window border size, all
  should be configurable via the GUI Prefs.  Also included into this should be more
  Prefs for backdrops (If 'Fast ram' and 'Chip ram' still exist, the option
  of Backgrounds to 'Fast ram' should also be there.)

@{b}o@{ub} A New Sound Prefs with the ability to add sounds to any event, such as
  Disk Inserted, Window Opened, Boot Up (Its very import that we have this
  free to edit as we wish).  Also included should be the options to turn
  filter on/off and to have samples played from Chip/Fast or from HD.  The
  Prefs should be able to load any datatype sound present, with or without
  compression etc.

@{b}o@{ub} New Pointer Prefs with the ability to have as many colours in the pointer
  as on the screen.  Also, instead of just normal and busy states, the
  pointer should have more states to give the user more of an exact idea of
  what is going on.  These new states can have graphics, or small
  animations. e.g. Program Loading, Pointer Locked, Disk Access, Error...

@{b}o@{ub} A New Palette Prefs with the ability to change ALL colours and not only
  the first 8 etc.  Also the possible addition of 'Transparent colours' to
  allow more powerful GUI looks.  Things such as 'Unselected Window',
  'Shell background' and other should all have selectable colours.

@{b}o@{ub} A New updated Printer Prefs, with new options like Print to FAX or print
  to HD in selectable format (e.g. FAX, IFF)

@{b}o@{ub} New Time Prefs with alarm, ability to display clock etc on title bar or
  some where selectable on any or all screens.  Also, a self-correct system using
  international time servers.

@{b}o@{ub} Workbench Windows should display more information on the Drive/Partition 
  they are for, e.g. free space, file system, number of files, number of files 
  selected, total bytes selected, access 'led'.

@{b}o@{ub} Hardware Prefs program, with possible external system allowing 3rd party
  companies to add new Prefs to the program to configure their 'card'.  This
  would simply blow away Plug'n'play, of course, Fit'n'Forget should still
  be there.

@{b}o@{ub} The startup-sequence and user-startup (If they still exist) should be
  counted as a system pref, so should be able to be edited via Prefs.

@{b}o@{ub} Compression Prefs, based on somewhat of a more advanced XPK/XFD 
  idea.  As some compression methods should be included with the OS, these should be
  selectable via Prefs so they are transparent to the system.  Also,
  actions such as copying from HD0: (compressed) to DF0: should automatically
  be recognized and files should be decompressed.

@{b}o@{ub} Datatype should no be counted as a system pref.  Datatype options should
  be edited via a Prefs program.

@{b}o@{ub] Assigns added into the prefs system, configuarble via program or
  at least a text editor.  One single file that contains all the assigns
  (system and custom).

@NODE "AmiNewWB" "Features Of New Workbench Release"
@font xen.font 8

 @{b}@{u}Features Of The New Workbench Release@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}o@{ub} On CD and/or Disk.

@{b}o@{ub} Many new printer drivers for support of top brands and if not, a better
  generic set of drivers.  Also, printer support should move to a 24bit
  colour model.

@{b}o@{ub} Set of monitor drivers to match certain monitors e.g. 1942 etc.

@{b}o@{ub} 2-Way Datatypes, Load and Save.  1-Way Datatypes should also be 
  supported such as only save or only load.  15/16/24bit colour depths
  should also be added into datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} New set of Datatypes covering main world formats e.g.
  GIF/PNG/JFIF/AIFF/WAV/VOC/MPEG/MPI-II-III etc etc.

@{b}o@{ub} HyperText viewer, if not built into MultiView via datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} Sound/GFX format converter via datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} Archiving tool like LhA/LZX using the 'new' Amiga archiving format.

@{b}o@{ub} Documents for 'EVERY' command or file present with the Workbench Release.

@{b}o@{ub} New icons, with at least 16+ colours.  Also, a set of Patterns and Sound
  should also be included. (8bit+ would be best)

@{b}o@{ub} More filetype recognition, or at least configurable by the user, with a
  default Default Tool for the selected type, thus minimising you having to change
  every Default Tool on your HD when you change your text viewer.

@{b}o@{ub} Total new OS 'Support'.  e.g. New Pic format, New Sample format (Both
  with support for increased bit expansion), New Standard Archiver, New
  AmigaGuide Format, New Set Of OS Compression tools (similar to XPK/XFD),
  New ARexx with support of ARexx 1.x and REXX. New Animation format (Sound
  and Video.)  This allows a general set of formats to be used similar to
  the way the old IFF formats did, but with extended abilities.  The IFF
  format itself could be redone to provide these features.  By re-starting
  this it removes the previous limits on software and makes software more
  powerful.

  (All with dedicated Libs, so support and upgrades can be done externally.
  As well as docs and datatypes for all formats.) 

@{b}o@{ub} A File Manager similar to DirectoryOPUS with datatype support.

@{b}o@{ub} CDDA Player/Writer as well as CD-I MPEG Software.

@{b}o@{ub} Sound and GFX Editing software that can Load/Save via Datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} Text Editor that is far more powerful than ED, and of course a
  ARexx Interface.

@{b}o@{ub} Standardized 'Locale' file that contains Several 1,000 common words
  allowing programmers quick and easy multilingual support.  e.g. Load,
  Open, Save, Delete, Copy, Paste, Quit.  A file for each main language
  could be released with Workbench allowing instant Locale support.
  Even if there was only 100 words in each file, that would be more than
  enough for a good quick locale support.

@{b}o@{ub} Programmer documents, Kernel etc.  This would provide an large developer 
  base quickly with the tools and information needed.

@{b}o@{ub} Disk-fixing Utilities, even though basic operations should be built into OS.

@{b}o@{ub} HardDisk Prep utilities.

@{b}o@{ub} Stacker with support for the 'new' Amiga compression format(s)

@{b}o@{ub} Blanker with Powersaver support, as well as HDSleep system.

@{b}o@{ub} Exchange with support for 'pause' and other features more like
  ARTM etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Terminal, FAX, Voice Mail, Video Phone and TCP software
  (FTP/WWW/IRC/Telnet), including a PCMCIA serial.device.

@{b}o@{ub} System Speed Tester and combination Hardware Config/Checker.

@{b}o@{ub} Possibly a program similar to ShapeShifter and/or PCx.

@{b}o@{ub} Bug-fixes and New OS Software should be released at least every 6 
  months.  Patches would be the simplest way to do this.  A Setpatch could
  be released in even less time.

@{b}o@{ub} New Narrator and Translator system that uses human sampled speech 
  fragments to produce a human sounding speech effect.  Also, a user
  definable file filled with corrections to make the speech more accurate.
  This has already been done so would be simple to add. @{fg highlight}@{i}There has been
  a lot of support for this, hey, and even wipEout 2097 uses the Amigas
  speech :)@{ui}@{fg text}

@{b}o@{ub} Support for Extended Density Drives/Disks. e.g. 900k, 1.8m, 3.6m disks.

@{b}o@{ub} Drop the idea of Chip/Fast ram and just have a single type.
  Of course, amounts of GFX data and Normal data must also be able to be
  displayed.

@{b}o@{ub} Desktop and Mini/Full Tower cases.  There should no longer be any
  Wedge machines.  However, Laptops would be a good idea when/if technology/demand
  allows.

@{b}o@{ub} A SetTop Box machine could be a possibility, but NOT the main focus of
  Amiga, it should be something on the side of normal production and
  development.  Possibly the Set-Top box could be used in an @{"Entertainment
  Network" Link "AmiFami"}.

 @{b}@{u}Expansion:@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}o@{ub} Internal port for Internal modems etc that is accessible via small
  removable panel in case, for easy access without having to rip machine
  apart.  Same with RAM.  Similar to the 'Trapdoor' of the 1200 etc.

@{b}o@{ub} PCI, but a new 64/128bit Zorro (IV) possibly added via PCI (possibly 
  compatible with Zorro II/III). PCI is there without question. PCI ports included
  should be PCI multimedia buses.

@{b}o@{ub} A range of @{"expansion cards" Link "AmiExpan"} should be available including,
  MPEG cards, accelerator cards, ISDN cards, expansion I/O cards, TV/radio
  tuners, MIDI, Network cards etc.

 @{b}@{u}Keyboard:@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}o@{ub} Keyboard buffer, another simple function people take for granted.
  The choice of a Normal/Natural keyboard should also be included. KB Light
  allowing of typing in the dark, sounds silly but is handy for people with
  poor vision such as my self.

@{b}o@{ub} Detachable/Separate Keyboards. Expanded from the original C= Design,
  e.g. More keys such as new F Keys, 8 Cursor keys etc, Space key split
  into 2 keys, both programmable as normal.

@{b}o@{ub} Configuarble LCD strip above FKeys to display what they do.

 @{b}@{u}Misc:@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}o@{ub} An advanced Diagnostics system to detect and 'inform' the user of
  faults and their cause, and this time... In English, not colours.
  Colours are not the standard international language :)

@NODE "AmiMisc" "Misc Suggestions"
@font xen.font 8

 @{b}@{u}Misc Requests@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}o@{ub} Talks between Amiga and other Amiga-orientated companies such as 
  Phase V should occur often providing the user with the best software/hardware.
  Just imagine what the Amiga user would get if AT, Phase 5 and PIOS worked
  together for once!

@{b}o@{ub} The idea of Aminet should be continued and supported.

@{b}o@{ub} Amiga Software/Hardware prices should be available on the Net in every
  currency where Amigas are used.  As well, ordering via Internet should be
  possible.

@{b}o@{ub} Advertising should be controlled by a group in each country where
  advertising is to be attempted, with close connections to Amiga.
  different countries require different advertising needs.

@{b}o@{ub} Official 'Amiga Approved' licences should be used so that Amigas can be
  cloned but remain under control of Amigas standards thus stopping the
  'PeeCee' problem.

@{b}o@{ub} Close talks between NewTek and Amiga would be wise, possibly offering
  technology for a deal with future VideoToaster and other technologies.

@{b}o@{ub} Donation of Hardware/Software to certain companies/services to boost
  coverage and the identity of the Amiga.  e.g. TV companies, ISPs etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Demos should be made and distributed via Internet to stores all over the
  world,  Offers could be made, best demo wins a new Amiga etc etc.
  (Nothing shows off an Amiga better than a good Demo ;) )

@{b}o@{ub} Official User groups should be setup allowing users to communicate to
  Amiga with suggestions/fixes, and support for the users.  Its is common
  to see some Amigas user groups that basically have no idea of what they are
  doing.

@{b}o@{ub} Regional Amiga Companies run by and for Amiga users.  Hiring
  Amiga 'Personalities' might be a wise idea, after all they know what they
  are doing.

@NODE "AmiEmul" "Emulation, How?"
@font xen.font 8

  @{b}@{u}Emulation@{uu}@{ub}

  The emulation option is under great debate, if the new AmigaOS etc etc is
 to support 3.1- code, then emulation must be done.  However what type of
 emulation is the question.  I'm going to try and explain the 2 main
 types that are supported at the moment. (This section is'nt finished yet
 as there is so much to add etc)

  @{b}@{u}Internal Emulation@{uu}@{ub}

  This is where the OS itself emulates the older code.  Similar to the
 MacOS system on the PowerMAC platform.

  @{fg highlight}Good things:@{fg text}  -Simple for the user
                -Transparent to the user
                -Incorporated into the OS allowing very little user
                 interaction to get running.               

  @{fg highlight}Bad things:@{fg text}  -Hard to upgrade if OS in ROM
               -Makes OS's kernel even more complex
               -Conflictions possible inside the OS since older software wouldn't 
                use the same memory system (Assuming the 1 memory type is
                introduced. Also memory protection etc will make the
                emulation process harder.

  @{b}@{u}External Emulation@{uu}@{ub}

  This is where the emulation is done by a separate program @{fg highlight}@{i}like@{ui}@{fg text}
 ShapeShifter however, it integrates the emulation a lot closer to the
 current OS than ShapeShifter does.  I use ShapeShifter as an example as I
 can not think of a system that is closer.

 @{fg highlight}Good things:@{fg text}  -Emulation can be improved fast since the program just needs
                to be replaced or patched.
               -Allows use of external hardware/software.  Example, drivers
                can be made to support the latest GFX card, or to use a new piece
                of graphics software.
               -Problems with memory protection are avoided since the
                applications are in an emulated environment.

 @{fg highlight}Bad things:@{fg text}  -The simple fact you have to load another program :)
              -Separate resources for the 2 different sides (Old OS and
               New).

@NODE "AmiFami" "Future Jobs For The Amiga"
@font xen.font 8

  @{b}@{u}Future Jobs For The Amiga@{uu}@{ub}

  When the Amiga was first released some 10+ years ago, it opened new areas
 that computers could be used in, multimedia for an example.  For a hold on
 the future the Amiga needs to once again grab a hold of a new and
 inovative market, and this is one of the challenges ahead of us.  This
 section is basically for new ideas where the Amiga could be used in new ways
 to once again be a pioneer in the computing world.

 @{b}Entertainment Networks (EN):@{ub}

  With the introduction of DVDs (Digital Video Discs) and Set-Top boxs, the 
 computer is going to move away from being the white box we know, to a black 
 addon for your TV and Stereo making it just another peice of entertainment
 hardware as common as a video recorder.  The worlds largest computer
 powers are saying the next big computer battle ground will be over EN
 systems which are expected to be in almost every home in 10 years time.

  A EN would basically consist of a TV, and DVD system all connected to a
 computer network.  This computer network would be run with a server hidden
 away out of site doing the main processing and other tasks while being
 connected to terminals around the house such as Set-Top boxs, and computer
 remotes.  From these terminals you will be able to control everything from
 taping your favorite TV programs to reading your email.

  With the Amigas talent for being powerful even with low reasources, the
 Amiga would be perfect for the EN idea.  Current estimated prices on a
 Set-Top box using current PC technology is between $2500US and $4000US
 which is far out of the reach of an average family.  However using Amiga
 technology, this would be possible at a fraction of the cost not to
 mention that EN systems could be made well within 2 years rather than the 
 10 years other companies such as MicroSoft are expecting.  However, just
 a Set-Top box is not the answer, the EN system would need a full computer
 system with advanced networking but still being cheap enough for home use.
 Can you imagine your Amiga running your houses security system?  This
 would all be possible via a EN system.

@NODE "AmiWhat" "What Can We Do To Help Amiga"
@font xen.font 8

  @{b}@{u}What Now?@{uu}@{ub}

  Waiting and hopeing for a new machine is'nt going to make one magicly
 appear, we need to keep up the support for the Amigas we have for as long
 as possible to insure that there is enough support to allow us move to the
 new platform(s).  We can do this by setting ourselves some rough standards
 and by sticking to them.  I have looked round and heres an example. Im not
 saying this is right or even close, but I think its fair.

  At this time, I would consider the following to be an good example of an
 average machine which should be supported to the best people can manage.

 @{fg highlight}Graphics:@{fg text}@{b}AGA@{ub}

  AGA is now considered the minimum graphics system for the Amiga and
 should be supported.  64 colours should be the minimum that games are made
 in now, but of course 256+ would be prefered.

 @{fg highlight}CPU:@{fg text}@{b}EC030/50Mhz@{ub}
  
  A 50Mhz EC030 is considered the average CPU on Amigas now and should be
 used to their full ability, however the only things to do that half the
 time is Demos.  If coded well, a 030/50Mhz is more than capable of a great
 game or business aplication.  Also the 030 is a good example to use as it
 is now a cheap expansion card and isnt to far out of reach for everyday
 users.

  Even thought I class the 030/50 as standard, we should start making code
 for highend systems like the 040, using as much optimizations as
 possible. After all, the 040 can get large speed increases for 040
 optimized code, and I dont mean 882, but real 040 code.  e.g. The 020
 version of LZX on a 040/40Mhz is 3x faster than on a 030/50, but the 040
 version is 5x faster and more faster!  Some FPU programs get a 7x boost
 in speed from the 882 versions when 040 optimized, now thats what I call a
 worth while speed increase!

  @{fg highlight}Sound:@{fg text}@{b}Mixing@{ub}

  We all know the Amiga has wonderful 4 channel 8bit sound, however this
 just doesnt cut it in 97, but as we have little to use, we have to make
 the most of it.  Software exists today to provide 8+ channels via Mixing
 routines, which could be used in any games or demos, possibly altering 
 the sample rate depending on the speed of the CPU. The 030/50Mhz is 
 considered standard and it can easily cope with a good quality 8
 channel song.

  Also, 14bit routines have become more common now allowing higher sound
 quailty for sound.

 (I wrote this before AHI 4 was out, of course AHI needs some big fixes but
  its damn good for a start)

 @{fg highlight}Memory:@{fg text}@{b}2Megs Chip, 4Megs Fast@{ub}

  These days it is rare to find an Amiga with less ram than 2Megs Chip and
 4Megs fast and yet few game makers take advantage, this is something that
 needs to be changed.  People complain how games have cruddy graphics and
 badly sampled sound, what do expect if you are running a game that will
 work on a raw 1200!

 @{fg highlight}Expansion:@{fg text}

  The one area the above stats won't thrive in is 3D Texture mapping type
 applications, BUT there is now a low cost partial solution to the problem.
 Cards such as the 'Graffiti' remove the need for the complex and slow
 Chuncky to Plannar routines used in 3D games and programs such as TKG and
 Breathless for a low price.  Support for these cards is essential as they
 allow slower and cheaper cpus to achive what only faster and more expensive
 cpus have been able to do in the past.  One other benefit of these cards
 is that even ECS/OCS machines can use them and even display 256 colours on
 screen.  Of course, the c2p routines are starting to get realy good now,
 theres some 040 c2p routines that are almost AS fast as the Graffiti, and
 well, on an 060, take a guess.

 @{fg highlight}Software:@{fg text}

  Just above I stated a 3D type card should become standard, thats fine
 however I think that 3D software such as 3D games on the Amiga for now is a
 waste of programers time.  I'd rather play Dune fast on an 020 rather than
 play a Doom Clone at 10fps on a 040 ;).  Amigas cant be beaten for 2D
 games so why not get over the whole 3D idea and start making those games
 that the Amiga became famous for.

  But thats just games, what about business?  The Amiga is currently
 lacking business software, so this should be an area that needs to be
 addressed.  Software such as Word Processors, Data Bases, Multimedia
 Systems, Spread Sheets etc.
