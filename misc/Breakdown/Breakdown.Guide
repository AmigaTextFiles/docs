F o r e w o r d

If you thought my fiction was bleak, wait until you cop a load of this.
  Our teenage years are strange, ever-changing rollercoasters of good
and bad feelings, of experimentation, depression, fantasies and fun. 
According to typical modern `teenage' novels, those of us aged between
fourteen and nineteen spend most of our lives ruled by mood-swings,
scoffing unhealthy food, partying, and trying to get off with the opposite 
sex. Either that, or we're teenage health-freaks, sort of `quiet drop-
outs', or lifeless weirdos who require pushing `back into the stream'.
  However, as Richmond's stories will tell you, things aren't quite so 
easy for `out-of-the-crowders' - it's not a simple matter of somebody
coming upto you and saying, "awww, you poor thing, here, let me help
you get back on track" because, firstly, nobody gives a shit, and 
secondly, some `out-of-the-crowders' would rather /die/ than have to 
mix with the mainstream.
  And so it is for many of Richmond's young protagonists. "Breakdown",
the title piece, and the most recent story in this collection, shows
how society scrapes the sucessful from the losers, makes a clean cut
between the two - and how? By luck. By chopping school at the age of
sixteen and offering a basic choice - hang on to higher education or 
jump in at the deep-end with your useless certificates and get a low-
paid, perpetual-routine job. (Hell, if you /can/.)
  Later in life we meet old friends, as in "Rendezvous", and realise
we've lost more than we've actually gained. Things we never thought
twice about during our childhood become of magnificent importance -
drinking ("Inebriation"), smoking, endless shagging - and why? Because 
we've lost our ability to occupy ourselves using only our imaginations;
the string of life's zest has slipped out from between our fingers,
crushed beneath the weight of pressure to be adult, the demand that we
become yet another fish in the river, and the suffocating fists of 
work and responsibility.
  Richmond's lucid characters are squashed beneath the soiled arses
of their greedy, bullying peers; shaken into whirlwinds of depression 
("Fragments"), confusion and chaos ("The Morning After"), and into
the soul-destroying depths of obsession and perversion ("Love is 
Blind"). Here, in this collection, we're dragged through social vomit, 
nose first - sometimes at the sacrifice of continuity, layout, and 
punctuation - and the nails of our wrongness are hammered in, hard,
with no mercy. We grow up, and we lose it. We grow up, and we lose
it. We grow up and we lose /everything/, and we /know/ it. We know
it we know it we know it.
  Mike Richmond, with his vivid, honest and disturbing fiction, 
has every right to rub this in.

L o v e   i s   B l i n d

I never knew love until I laid eyes on her, and I never even knew
her name until I fell in love with her.  Sadie Benton: thirty-two
years old; divorced; no children; long, black hair; brown eyes.  The
woman of my dreams, and I hoped I would be the man of hers.
  I first met her when I was a trainee in the bank, back in the
nineties - doesn't that sound really long ago now?  Just think, we can
say "back in the /twentieth/ century", or even "back in the /second/
millennium" now.
  Back in the fifties there were literally hundreds of comics floating
around that said "by the nineteen-eighties we'll have this thing" and
"by the year 2000 we'll have such and such" and it was all bollocks.
Well okay, most of it.  Some things: moon landings; a computer in
every home; computers you can fit in your pocket; wrist-watches with
memo facilities and all the other modern stuff like that /did/ happen,
but all the shit about moon /bases/, a robot in every home,
/intelligent/ computers, wrist-watches with communicators in them
never happened.  Or if they did they never filtered down into everyday
society.
  The kiss of death for any technology is Tomorrow's World.  I mean,
have you /ever/ seen anything that has been featured on Tomorrow's
world again?  It's a subliminal way of intervention by the Government
- if somebody invented perpetual motion then it would just go on
Tomorrow's World and never be seen again.  Free energy isn't taxable,
you see.  That's why cigarettes and alcohol aren't illegal, and that's
why the world's Governments spend millions of pounds on busting drug
dealers so they can make twice as much selling the shit back to the
kids on the streets.
  Just think, if Tomorrow's World had been around in the forties we
could have so easily prevented nuclear weapons.  It would have been
far more effective than a bunch of moaning hippies with honourary
life-membership of CND.
  Tomorrow's World has done /some/ good, I admit.  If some of these
futuristic appliances had arrived for use by the public, it would have
only made us even lazier than we already are.  We've already turned
into virtual robots, and we all want everything at the push of a
button - entertainment, shopping, even communication.  The human
contact has gone, all because machines do it more efficently.  Which,
of course, is better, according to the Conservative theory.
  As you can probably tell, I'm not a fan of technology - so far as I
can see all we are concerned in doing is inventing more and more ever
more comprehensive ways of killing each other.  Who needs fancy
gadgets to do that?  It's all too impersonal.  Like banking.  Maybe it
was just as well I got out of that dead-end occupation when I did.
  Anyway, the day Sadie Benton walked into my life was the day she
decided to open an account with the bank I was working in.  As she
pensively filled in the probing form I stared and smiled at her.
Eventually she turned away.
  She asked me, politely, what was the problem and I said "I was
looking at you", which sort of annoyed her.  After a couple of minutes
she decided she had had enough and she walked out of the bank, and out
of my life.
  I lost my job the next month, as the result of a "merger".  Mergers
are to make business more efficient.  Efficency requires streamlining.
Streamlining increases profits.  Profits means redundancies.
  Aren't there a lot of synonyms in the English language.
Streamlining is used as a euphemism for "redundancies"  which is, to
me a far betterword.  At least it gets straight to the point.  I hate
all this Latinate flowery shit and all that Politically Correct
beating around the bush bollocks that's it's so fashionable to use
these days.
  Political Correctness, to me, as immeasurably patronising.  It's not
as though the terminology /has/ to be in complicated language - it
just makes the twats at the top feel better about themselves.
  I'm sorry, we haven't been properly introduced, have we?  My name is
Wally Taylor.  I'm thirty-five (I was only twenty at the time), five-
ten and twelve stone.
  Aren't numbers wonderful.  Your entire life can be recorded as a
list of numbers.  Everything is a number.  If you ever get interested
in computers you'll find out that everything is either a "one" or
a"zero".  That's it.  With two numbers - well, one number and nothing
- you can describe anything you like.  Anything from a piece of music
to a painting to a story to a game to a word processor to a nuclear
power plant is /all/ made up of a list of numbers.
  I've always been good with numbers - that's the reason that I went
into banking.  I bet I could have been a divisional manager now, if it
weren't for the merger.  The /fucking/ merger, God bless our poor
souls.  Just twenty years old and in a few short months I lost
everything as I went from a promising career in banking to...

                                  *

  ...wanking in a tree.  That's what it came to, if you'll excuse the
double entendre.  She lived in a house facing the woods.  Well
"rearing" the woods at least.  I found her address in the telephone
book.  She'd only got so far as to writing her full name on the
application form when the bitch walked out of the bank.  I looked up
all the Bentons, ripped out the page - there were only three-and-a-
half columns - and crossed out their names one by one as I rang them
and asked for her.  Hers was the last name I tried, because the phone
was still in her ex-husband's name.  Terry.
  I pretended to be a sales-person, safe in the assumption that nobody
/ever/ buys anything via telesales.
  Quite who came up with the idea that people might positively respond
to some out-of-work actor offering them a "once in a lifetime"
opportunity to purchase double glazing "at a discount price,
especially for /you/, but only if you reply within seven days" is
beyond me.  Seems like a waste of time an money, to me, but at least
it provides jobs.  Not that you couldn't make a computer that would do
the job a hundred times more efficiently.
  I wrote her letters, up to seven a day.  She never replied.  I
signed each one with a declaration of love but she did not seem to
care.  I just could not understand how I could be so in love with her
while she hated me.  I felt compelled to tell her how I felt, and that
I did, as often as I could, and I intended to do so for as long as it
took.  I never got nasty.  Not at first.  I was just a shy soul
searching out for something, anything.  A rock to grab on to keep me
from my own emotional whirlpool.

                                  *

  I eventually decided to make a kind of tree house in the woods, the
ones backing onto her house.  I dragged loads of branches through the
woods late at night over a period of about a week, and I stacked them
in a criss cross pattern on a suitable nearby tree.  It was shaped
like an upside down spider, which was useful 'cause it kept all the
logs in place.  I kept my binoculars up there.  I kept a flask up
there.  Most importantly I kept a King Size box of Kleenex up there
and used it up within a week.  Then I moved onto pages from books,
leaves, my clothes, anything.
  Once, when she was on holiday I went into her house and wanked in
her bedroom.  In her bed.  I had to keep away for a few weeks because
the police kept hanging around the house.  Rumour has it she thought
the house-breaker was her ex-husband trying to find her divorce
documents.
  I'd convinced myself I was an author by that time - I've got "A"
level English Language, you know, whatever /that's/ worth.
  "A" level English Language, at least at the time /I/ took it was
essentially in two sections.  The first dealt with such exciting
subjects as grammar, semantics, phonology, graphology and about ten
other Greek or Latin words - I don't know which.  This was basically
about studying what writers were trying to say in their text and what
it was about.  Personally, I think that a piece of writing is about
what /you/ think it's about.  What it means to whoever is reading a
"text" is infinitely more important than what some university-based
academic /tells/ you it means.
  The other part of the course was about the even /more/ exciting
subjects of the history of the language and the way children learn to
speak.  /Gripping/ stuff, I'm sure you'll agree, and a disappointment
to all of the students who expected to be able write Science Fiction
stories all day.
  I often took a notebook up in the tree house with me and scribbled
down notes for my novel.  I never finished it.  I've still got all my
notes and all my drafts but I doubt I'll ever look at it again.
  The last night in the "tree-house" was the best night of all.  She
came out of the shower at nine-thirty, as usual, but this time she
didn't close the curtains.  She ran to answer the phone - or maybe to
make a call - and sat their in her bedroom with only a towel around
her for maybe ten minutes.  I clenched my teeth and slowed my rhythm
to delay the climax, to heighten the excitement, and was rewarded when
she started to get changed in front of my very eyes.  I dropped the
binoculars in the rush and vaguely heard them smashing twenty-feet
down as I released my breath in a gasp, red faced and sweaty.  I burst
my seams in a rippling orgasm and left a sticky DNA sample all over
the tree.  And all over my fucking sandwiches.
  I ate them anyway.

                                  *

  The Fair came to town the next day - the autumn had come late so it
was still quite warm.  It was then that I decided that it was time to
make my move.  I waited for three hours in a phonebox across the road
from her house in case she decided to go.  I was rewarded when she
stepped out of the house with a friend, both of them giggling and
chattering at each other like teenagers as their heels clicked down
the street.  I followed in the shadows, ducking into the hedgerows as
they turned round to make sure they weren't being followed.
  Because she didn't live far from the Fairground she walked all the
way.  It was a good job - I'd missed my Giro that week and didn't have
any money for a bus fare.
  The Fair was the same as always.  Full of laughter, smiles and
screaming.  Lots of screaming.  I like to scream.  Sometimes, when I'm
alone I scream and scream until I feel dizzy.  Sometimes I do it when
I aren't alone.  I like feeling dizzy.  It reminds me of the climactic
moments immediately before an ejaculation.
  I lost Sadie for almost an hour.  She disappeared into the crowd and
I got really frantic, desperately looking for her.  The bitch.  No
consideration for others.  For /me/.  I had to talk to her, I /had/ to
tell her how I felt, I /had/ to make her love me.  Shit, I must have
asked a hundred people if they'd seen anybody matching her description
(and her description /did/ match half the women /there/ but no fucker
ever helps you when you're desperate)
  When I was about nine or ten I went on a walk with my cousins to the
Country Park.  They went up a steep hill and I lost them because I
couldn't keep up with them.  I cried for ages, and I asked loads of
tourists if they'd seen them.  Nobody took a blind bit of notice of
me.  So I tried to leave them a message in the rocks near the
entrance - stupid, I know, but at the time I was reading a lot of
Combat and Survival type mags and I honestly thought it would help.  I
saw loads of passers-by laughing at me, pointing at me, and in the end
somebody kicked the stones away while I was arranging them.  Not a
teenage boy, as I would have expected, shit, not even a child at all.
It was just an ordinary bloke, out with what must have been his wife,
or at least a long term partner.
  From that day on I've never taken anyone at face value.  The most
ordinary looking people can be complete /wankers/, and most of the
time they are.  The people who I can find solace in tend to be those
who don't take everything for granted: the "weirdos", the homeless and
so on.  Society in general just takes everything for granted.  We
/expect/ to be able to watch television whenever we choose, we
/expect/ teenagers to nick cars and turn into junkies, we /expect/
everybody to want to do certain things with their life: by your
thirties, if you haven't got a mortgage, a Ford Mondeo in the drive
and two point four children you are considered abnormal.  People will
start making rumours about you: you're shagging a married woman;
you're gay; anything except the truth which is that you want something
/different/ out of your life to what they're getting.
  Back to the Funfair: Eventually a dark-skinned bloke with a baseball
cap on pointed her out to me.   Silly me - she was right there at the
toffee apple stall, barely a hundred meters away.  We must have been
psychically linked - she could never get away from me.  I would
always, /always/, be there for her, following her.  Watching her.
  She began to apprehensively lick at her toffee-apple: cautiously at
first, then she sank her teeth deep inside it with an almost-audible
squelch, her tongue licking and probing its every ridge and trough.
She closed her lips around  the semi-consumed core right up to the
stick and closed her eyes, breathing in its  taste.  I imagined the
toffee-apple was my cock and soon I had to close my eyes too.
  I crept around the back of the toffee-apple stall where it was
suspiciously quiet.  There were no people there, just a dog, tethered
with a leather rope and loads of thick, black criss-crossed wires.
The only sound was the stacatto jingling and thumping of distant dance
music.  I could just see her legs - they were exposed to the soft
wind, and propping up her short-skirt.  My greedy eyes followed them
down to the painted toes peeping through her sandals at one end then
up, up to her arse at the other.  Before I could stop myself my pants
had filled with a hot, sticky pleasure.
  Of course I could hardly go and proposition her, as I had intended,
with an unsightly, but pleasantly warm, damp patch on the crotch of my
jeans so I reluctantly decided to go home and wait until the morning.
  I scribbled a note on my pad, and put it through her door on my way
home.  I told her what I had done.  Everything I had done.  I said I
was sorry, and begged her to let me into her life.
  I even gave her my telephone number and asked her to ring me as soon
as she got home, knowing she would not.  I expected to wait forever
for her to love me but I just wasn't sure I could wait that long...

                                  *

  ...and I couldn't.  I rang her at midnight, giving her plenty of
time to get home.  As always I made sure to dial 141 before her number
so she couldn't ring 1471 to find my number, even though there was no
need anymore, because I'd left my name and number on the note.
  She answered the phone in a faint but distinctly slurred voice - she
must have been out drinking after she had been to the Fair.  I told
her I loved her.  She told me she didn't know what I as talking about.
  Normally she slammed the 'phone down right away. Sometimes I rang
late at night and I didn't say anything, letting myself be comforted
by the sexy huskiness of her night-voice.
  Sometimes I wanked while I was ringing her, but I always tried not
to make it obvious or she'd just call the police again.  The last time
I had to tell the pigs that I intended to ring my girlfriend and I
inadvertantly rang the wrong number, and the stupid bastards believed
me!  I guess it was the suit and tie I was wearing that made them more
inclined to believe me instead of her.  Good job I didn't burn all my
suits after the banker-bastards sacked me.  I almost did.  I had a
bonfire prepared in the woods and everything.  I was going to burn
myself as well.  I covered everything with petrol but I chickened out
at the last minute.
  I might still do it, though. I thought about doing it when I broke
into Sadie's house.  I was going to slash my wrists in her bath and
write her a note in my own blood, but I felt better by the time I had
reached the bathroom.
  On the phone I told her that we were destined to be together: she
told me that she didn't know who the fuck I was so why on earth would
she want to have a relationship with me.  I told her that I would kill
myself if she didn't want me.  She said she'd kill me if she ever set
eyes on me, after she'd read what I had done.  I told her that if
there was life after death I would wait for her until she died, and
then she would love me.  She told me to fuck off.  I told her I would
kill her and then kill myself so we could be together in heaven.  She
said I was going to hell.  She told me to shut up, told me she would
rather go blind than fuck me, then she told me to fuck off again and
slammed the telephone down.
  For a couple of minutes I seriously thought about going to her house
and raping her, then murdering her, then killing myself.  I always
carry a knife around with me, and I always keep it sharp.  The thought
went temporarily out of my head when I found myself rolling up my
sleeve and carving her name into my forearm with the flashing blade.
Then I drank a bottle of whisky and watched TV until the sun rose
again.  I was unable to prevent myself from thinking about her, the
way she said she'd rather go blind than fuck me.  The bitch.  The
fucking bitch.
  While Jobfinder silently mocked me from the corner of my living room
I tore down all the pictures that I had caringly plastered all over my
walls in a red rage - the pictures of her, most of them taken using a
telephoto lens (I borrowed the camera off an ex-workmate.  He's moved
to Bristol now) and some that I took from the personal collection in
her bedroom.  I put them all in a bin-bag and left them outside for
the dustmen.  I was absolutely fucking /livid/, and this time my
disappointment didn't wane in the daylight.

                                  *

  So I went to her house as soon as GMTV started.  I couldn't take
that bastard Eammon Holmes with his scripted wit and the plastic-faced
tedium of Anthea Turner's grin any more.
  I had dark glasses on, and a black woolly hat that covered up my
hair.  I also had my thick leather driving gloves on - the same ones
I'd worn when I broke into her house.  Not much use for them since my
car had been repossessed.
  I knocked on her door so hard my knuckles cracked and as soon as she
opened the door and peeped through a slim vertical crack I pushed
inside and slammed the door behind me.
  She started screaming so I put my hand around her mouth, then she
bit me so I turned her around and pushed her against the wall, gritting
my teeth and telling her if she didn't stop yelling I'd fucking kill
her.  I told her not to fucking look at me, and then I tore off her
clothes and fucked the bitch.  Then, as she laid crying on the floor I
told her that she'd said she'd rather go blind than fuck me and now
she was fucking getting both.
  And then I stuck the knife into both of her eyes in turn, her frothy
mouthed protestations cutting off as her terror hit a peak and
continued to escalate.
  Finally, I tied her up and emptied all of the bins in her house
until I found my letter, which I slipped into my inside pocket.  I
thought it fair to assume the bitch wouldn't have kept the rest of my
letters, but they didn't have any identifiable features anyway.
  And then I walked away - just walked away - out of her back door,
past my deserted tree-house and the smashed binoculars still lying
below it and away, away, away.

                                  *

  I must have had a nervous breakdown or something after that.  Well I
/did/ have a nervous breakdown: I'd probably had one long before that
as well.
  That night, and every night afterwards for the next few months I
contemplated suicide by every possible method, always changing my mind
at the last minute.  In then end I just walked out of my house one
night with nothing on except a bright yellow flasher's mac and my
shell suit bottoms and jumped off the little stone bridge by the
telephone box, right into the river.  Unfortunately for me it was a
dry year and it had only just started raining a week or so earlier and
so I just splatted embarrassingly onto the mud, which prevented any
serious physical injury.
  I just laid there for two nights, laughing and crying at the same
time until, by way of chance, a passing rambler spotted the yellow of
my coat through the mud.
  I was taken straight into hospital, where they cleaned me up,
treated me for exposure, dehydration, malnourishment and fuck knows
what else.  It was then that I was labelled "mentally unstable" -
more fucking PC bollocks - and institutionalised "for my own benefit".
  In time I told the doctors /everything/, but they didn't seem to
care.  One day I read the notes from the interviewing doctor's
clipboard. Reading upside down is one of the first things you learn.
It said "Delusional manic-depressive paranoid-schizophrenic".  I
didn't know if that was a description of me or just a list of every
possible psychiatric complaint it was possible to suffer from, which
they would tick off for each patient like their lottery numbers.
Probably both.
  I impressed the doctors by my swift "recovery" - I always was a good
actor - and I never thought of Sadie again, until a frightened-looking
blind woman claiming to be a voluntary Social Worker came to visit me
during my last week in "care".  /Care/, Christ, it sounds as if
they're /helping/ you.  I never met a single bastard in there who
/cared/.  All of them, every last one, was just a patronising pile of
shit.
  But back to my "visually impaired" visitor: She said she had once
been obsessively stalked and seriously assaulted by what the police
thought was an escaped psychiatric patient, and that if I was going to
be released was I sure that I wasn't going to to her what he had done
to me.  I looked at her long, black hair and smiled to myself as I
told her I would never even /think/ of doing such a thing.
  That seemed to convince them that I was sane enough to be released
back into the real world, which was great because I really thought
they'd keep me there forever.  You see madness isn't a scalar quantity
- madness and sanity are balanced very finely with each other.  In
fact, I would say that the very act of institutionalising a man
/drives/ him mad in the end.
  You see, asylums, as we aren't allowed to call them any more, aren't
to protect the mad from themselves, nor to protect the public from
them. They are there to protect the "mentally challenged", as they are
pompously known by so called "normal" citizens, from /society/.
  Most of the inmates - sorry, /patients/ - weren't actually raving-
lunatic mad. They just thought differently to most people.  Sometimes
innovative thinkers are labelled "geniuses" - it depends whether their
radical ideas are accepted or not.
  If they had suffered from a physical handicap rather than a medical
one they'd be pandered and helped an loved but mental problems just
don't win votes so nobody cares.
  Little children in wars, amputees making a new life for themselves -
/that/ is what the political parties wants to be seen to be
supporting.
  People with mental illnesses, and I mean /illnesses/, I'm not going
all PC on you, are seen by the public as being perverted child sex-
killers who are a danger to the public.  Okay, some of them /are/,
fair enough, but so are millions of other people.  In no other
situation can you punish innocent people for the crimes that others
with the same affliction have committed in the past.
  Imagine if it was proven that 90% of criminals had beards: would
every man with a beard be criminalised?  Would every /man/ be
criminalised just because he had the capability of growing a beard?
It sounds ridiculous and unlikely, but this kind of discriminatory
generalisation is /rife/ in the world, it's just that most of us
manage to turn a blind eye to it.

                                  *

  Shit!  Is that the time? I'm afraid I'll have to be off now, the
wife gets worried when I'm late home.  She doesn't like being alone -
she says she feels unsafe when I'm not there protecting her.
  Her name? Oh, she's called Sadie.

The moment their lips touched  Paul  turned  away in embarrassment and
jealousy, their open  display  of  intimacy  disturbing and depressing
him.  But everywhere he looked was  a  seething mass of checked shirts
and nubile flesh, locked  together  inseperably.   To  him  it was not
beautiful or affectionate, but a  collection  of hideous siamese twins
leering at him from their conjoined  faces.   The numbers on his watch
did not seem familiar and they  rotated  along  with the hands when he
tried to read the  time,  so  he  asked  Chris  instead.  Emptying his
bottle he passed it to Chris who dropped  it into the bin for him.  He
closed his eyes but experienced a  rushing motion.  His eyes failed to
focus properly when he cautiously  opened  them  and an aching feeling
soared  through  his  veins,  starting  at  his  stomach  and  rushing
outwards.  He loosened his  belt  and  leaned  against a wall.  Slowly
sliding downwards he realised  Tony  and  Maria  had finished touching
each other up and were staring at him with some fascination.  He tried
to speak but his mouth would  not  move  so  instead he gazed into the
distance, at the one point were he could  not catch the eye of anybody
wanting to pick a fight.   For  no  particular  reason he let his head
drop into his hands.  He decided he wanted a knife.  He asked for one.
Nobody replied.    He was met by a  strange glance when he asked for a
rope, then he ran  his  hands  through  his  hair  and closed his eyes
again.  Maria had stood up.  She walked  up  to him and waved her hand
in front of his face.  He  continued  to  gaze straight ahead.  "Is he
alright?" asked Tony but she did not answer immediately.  She repeated
her gesture then answered Tony. "We'll  soon see,", she whispered, not
realising Paul had heard, then to  Paul  directly she said "Hiya!". He
ignored her, her greeting not  initially  registering in his mind.  By
the time he had  mentally  prepared  himself  to  answer  the time had
passed and he realised she was  now  sitting next to him, also leaning
against the wall.   Rob  and  Andrew  had  disappeared,  and  had been
missing for over half an hour.   He  was  just about to ask where they
were when Dave came back and announced  that Rob was "getting off with
a really hot lass."  "What eloquence"  thought  Paul, but today he did
not feel like saying it out  loud.   He  pushed  himself up a bit, not
wanting to be mistaken by the  bouncers  for a drunk, and continued to
look straight ahead.   Tony  was  talking  to  somebody  who he didn't
recognise.  Chris and Steve stood up   "We're  off for a piss.  Anyone
coming?".  Tony grinned at  them.   "Not  today,  I'm already taken.".
And then they were gone, and  Maria  leant  over to Paul and planted a
wet, drunken kiss on his cheek, in full view of Tony.  Although he was
grinning his eyes contained a  hint  of  jealousy.  Paul still did not
react, although he  was  tempted.   Very  tempted.   For  a  moment he
considered leaning  back  and  returning  the  favour  but immediately
changed his mind, deciding that  kissing  his mates' girlfriends would
be metaphorically equivalent to screwing them so he slid back down the
wall and painfully remembered  a  time  when  none  of this would have
really concerned him at all.

F r a g m e n t s

And after an eternity  of  falling  he  finally  hit  the water with a
deafening yet silent splash.  His ears  filled  with water and he lost
all sense of direction.  He squeezed  his  eyes shut until he saw just
the redness of his eyelids and he had  held his breath for so long his
chest felt ready to  implode.   Down,  down,  he  continued to plunge,
longing to be able to gasp  for  breath.   Able  to hold his breath no
longer, his mouth fell open,  and as  he took in his first lungful  of
salt water the dream ended.

                                  *

"...and the answer is clearly two  root  two multiplied by six Pi plus
two, all squared,"  drones  the  teacher,  clearly  trying  to hide an
orgasmic feeling of superiority as  the  entire class rest their heads
on their elbows, baffled, trying not to fall asleep.

The bell rings at half past three, startling the bright kids almost as
much as the dozing half-wits and  gradually the whole building springs
to life in a frenzy  of  swinging  bags, endless footsteps and violent
jostling.

Four boys leave  the  Maths  room  later  than  the  others, belatedly
giggling at a joke one  of  them  made  earlier  in  the day.  A brown
haired, small-framed boy says a  swear  word  and they once again fall
into hysterics as an in-joke is repeated for the millionth time.

As they leave the building  into  the  hot  summer sun, the screams of
four hundred school-children hit their  ears.   In the distance, seven
boys on bicycles chase a  thin  blonde boy, shouting indistinguishable
obscenities at him as he  runs   for   his  life,  terrified that they
will re-enact the threats they had made earlier in the day.

Two streets later, the small boy says  goodbye to his friend and turns
into a near-deserted road.  A tall,  fat   boy   with a shaved head is
half way  down the street ahead.  The  small  boy mutters a swear word
under his breath and  slows  down  his  walk,  trying  to hide himself
behind cars and trees.

The fat boy turns around, and  spots  a small boy with glasses walking
slowly down the street.  He has seen  this boy before.  He has shouted
names at him as he has ridden past on his bike.  He has thrown eggs at
him as he was walking back to  school after dinnertime.  The small boy
is often alone, his friends seem to disappear after school.  He stands
still, staring at him.

The small boy's heart beats faster -  the  fat boy is waiting for him.
He thinks about turning round and running, but that would fuel the fat
boy's hatred even more.  He   crosses   the   street and walks, faster
than before, hoping that the fat boy is waiting for somebody.

The fat boy picks up a stick  and  half-jogs across the road, until he
is blocking the small boy's progress.

"Oy, little shit," he shouts  to  the  small  boy, who ignores him and
tries to walk around him.  The fat  boy  grabs his coat and pushes him
into a hedge.

"Are you deaf, you little cunt?  Eh?"

The small boy sees the fat boy tapping his stick in his left palm.

"You're in the sixth-form, aren't you?", says the fat boy.

"Yeah..." spits the  small  boy,  in  a  weak  voice.   His  throat is
swelling and he is barely  choking  back  tears.   He brings his hands
down to his side,  remembering  the  still-throbbing  cuts he made the
night before.

"You're a fucking little shit, aren't  you,"  laughs the fat boy," Are
you the one we were throwing eggs at last week?"

The small boy shakes his head, gritting his teeth in anger.  He wishes
he had the courage to retaliate, but the last time he tried to do that
he ended up in casualty.

"Don't fucking lie to me, you little wanker," growls the fat boy, in a
high pitched, pre-pubescent voice.  He  hits  the small boy across the
back of the head  with  his  stick,  then  fumbles  around  in his hip
procket, eventually producing a cheap  gas  lighter.   He flicks it on
and lets the boy watch the angry  flame  for a few seconds, which seem
to him like eternity.

The small boy starts to cry,  and  shouts  "Fuck off!" to the fat boy,
who eventually wanders away from  him,  grinning.  The small boy walks
down the street towards his  home,  barely  managing to avoid running.
If he runs the fat boy will chase him and hurt him again.

                                  *

After falling forever, he opened his  eyes and realised he was bearing
down on the ground and he  closed  his  eyes  again and prayed for his
life.  A voice in his  head  told  him  to  give  up, and he gradually
accepted his inevitable death.  The  world  blurred  through a wall of
tears; he waited for his head to hit the water.

                                  *

A door distantly slams, shaking the whole house.  The boy contemplates
turning up his music but stops,  hand outstretched as he hears another
piercing shout and a louder slam.  Shouting voices make his heart beat
faster; make his throat  go  dry.   He  leaps  onto  the  bed as heavy
footsteps climb  the  stairs  and  stares,  teary  eyed  at  the faded
whiteness of his firmly closed door.

"...bastard..."

"...why don't you just listen to what..."

"...shut your bloody mouth..."

"...I mean it this time...."

"...goodbye..."

Several minutes pass as he tries to  put  actions to the noises he can
hear; clunking, slamming, crying.  His  heart  beats  out of his chest
and his mind races thorugh a thousand terrifying possibilities.

He chokes back a final  phlegmy  mouthful  of  tears as the front door
slams.

                                  *

Outside, a strong breeze was  blowing.   He  looked down and the world
momentarily span.  Rushing adrenalin   made   him   feel  tenser  than
usual.  He glanced behind himself.  His bedroom didn't feel right, but
he could sense nothing wrong   with   it.   He  suddenly  tripped  and
fell impossibly backwards out of  the  window.    He  didn't  want  to
fall, but it felt natural.   He  wondered  what  sound it  would  make
when his body hit the river softly flowing below the window.

                                  *

The small boy swings his football in  a bright yellow bag.  He doesn't
really like playing football  but  all  of  his  friends  do, and he'd
rather be with them than left alone  with his thoughts.  He is wearing
a jumper even though  the  sun  is  blazing  and  is sweating horribly
beneath his goalpost-coat.

In the distance he sees two  hazy  figures, and for a moment considers
changing direction to avoid  them,  as  he  normally  does.  But as he
draws closer  he  realises  they  can  be  no  older  than  twelve  or
thirteen,a good four years younger than  him.  He assumes they'll just
walk past and carries  on  to  meet  his  friend,  whose house is just
around the corner.  As he approaches his friend's street, the two boys
cross in front of him.

"Excuse me, kid," says the smaller of the two.  His face is like a rat
and he  and  his  friend  are  grinning  and  nudging  one  another in
anticipation, "Have you got ten pee I can lend?"

"Sorry, no," says the boy, now becoming suspicious.

"Yes you fucking have.  Give us it now or we'll have to rough you up a
bit, if you know what I mean..."

The small boy tries to hide a grin  -  as if these two little kids are
going to rough him up.  He  mentally  prepares to flatten one of them.
He tells the rat-boy to fuck off.

"Hey, there's no need  to  swear!",  shouts  the  rat  boy, his friend
turning away to suppress a giggle.   The  small  boy tries to push his
way past.  His friend lives less  than two hundred metres away.  He'll
go and ring his  doorbell  and  the  two  smaller  boys will leave him
alone.  He notices his heart beating  faster  as both of the boys grab
him and push him away.

"What's in the bag?"  asks  the  rat  boy.   His  friend  says "It's a
football,".  The small boy  wonders  if  they  are  going to steal his
ball.  How will he explain that  to  his  friends, who are expecting a
game of football.

The rat-boy pats the small boy's pockets, and the small boy thanks God
that he has put his wallet safely  in his coat pocket.  Then his hopes
are shattered as the rat-boy  dips  into  his  pocket.  He pulls out a
hard plastic case, missing the small boy's wallet by inches.

"What's in this?" he asks.

"It's for my glasses, knobhead,"  says  the  small boy, shame and fear
breaking up his voice.   What  if  his  friends  find  out he has been
mugged by two little kids?

The rat-boy opens the  case  and  removes  its  contents.  A couple of
scraps of paper and a pen.  He  mutters something to his friend: "What
a fucking strange thing to keep in  a glasses case," then hurls it all
to the floor and  the  small  boy  runs  past  him towards his friends
house, clumsily bending to  grab  his  glasses  case from a shimmering
puddle on the way.

"Hey, kid, you forgot your pen,"  laughs  the  rat boy.  The small boy
carries on running until he  reaches  his  friends door.  He rings the
bell four times, heart knocking against his ribs.

His friend comes to the door.

"What's up with you, you look like you've seen a ghost!" he laughs.

The small boy looks to the floor.

"Something like that..." he whispers.  His friend would only laugh and
tell everybody else if he told him about what had just happened.

When he walks past the spot  a  moment  later,  he notices his pen and
scraps of paper are gone from  the  flooded gutter,  and he forgets to
breathe for half a second.  His  friend  begins  to  talk about who is
coming to play football today.

                                  *

He had woken up with a start, and  after  the world had swum back into
focus he realised that  there  was   smoke   coming  from  beneath his
door.  He leapt out of bed and ran  to the window.  The river that ran
beside his house was there,  even   though   he   lived  over  a  mile
away from the nearest stretch of water.

Vague memories of childhood came back to  him - his mother telling him
to keep away from the  end of  the  garden  where the "drain" ran - an
open stretch of muddy water  in  a  sharp mini-valley, making a border
between the residential area and the ship-yard.

He tried to  breathe  but  knew  that  the  smoke  ought  to  stop him
breathing.  He opened the  window,  and  a  breeze  tugged  it out his
hands, cracking it against the  outside  wall.   He remembered that he
was supposed to throw down something  soft, but then realized that the
water was still there.  He wished he could wake up.

                                  *

The small boy  sits,  the  room  illuminated  only  by  the sixty watt
dimness of a bedside lamp.  His left hand lies palm up in front of him
covered with two or three dark horizontal lines.  In his right hand he
clutches a half-sharp penknife.

His parents have been annoying him for weeks - taking out their angers
on him and each other.  He is  sick  of  being picked on by people far
younger than himself.  He wishes  he  could  be  normal.  He wishes he
didn't look like a bully's dream  come  true.  He wishes he could tell
somebody.  He wishes somebody could love him.

And he wishes the dreams would stop  -  the dreams in which all of his
terrors come true: fire; falling;  drowning.   He wishes the voices in
his head would shut up and leave him  alone.  He wishes he could be as
important as he feels in his "other" life.

And in a white frenzy of  hate  and  terror he drags the knife sharply
across his wrist again,  causing  a  white  scratch  to appear.  For a
moment he realises what he is  doing,  but then he repeats the action,
pressing a little harder.  This time  the  white line turns red at the
ends.  He cuts again and again and again and again and again and again
and again and again.  Then he  holds  the  knife  in his left hand and
carries on until both of his  wrists  are  a mass of red scratches and
bleeding.  Then he turns off the  light  and  cries until his eyes run
dry, terrified to sleep and terrified of what tomorrow will bring.

                                  *

Peace.  Maybe everything  was  going  to  be  alright,  he wondered to
himself.  Fleeting colours formed images of  heaven in the back of his
mind's eye and a single, soft kiss  made him feel wanted for the first
time in his life.  But  something  gravelly  and ashen was hitting his
nostrils and the mental  images  were  becoming blurred and contorted.
He tried to prise open his eyes with sheer mental willpower and missed
a heartbeat as thick smoke rushed into his lungs.

Picking at his flaking fingertips he  puts down the guitar and vaguely
recalls the dream.  Sitting down,  he  flicks  a  switch and his Other
life bursts into place.  Self respect is  gained and he begins to talk
to the machine, fingers stinging with the dull throbbing of his heart.

He signed the small slip of paper to inform the DSS that he had been
out of work and actively seeking work on each of the days since he last
signed.  His Unemployment Benefit book was passed back to him, and he 
quickly slipped it into his inside pocket as he stood up and left the 
office with a confident stride.  The carpets were new and springy and 
the whole place seemed bright and lively.  Hordes of people were 
queuing outside the Job Centre, that bright oasis in the concrete 
desert.
  He walked past the drug addicts and dossers, the ex-businessmen with
briefcases.  A dozen young unshaven men across the road stared him
straight in the eye as he opned the double doors to the outside world.
He didn't turn away - he wasn't afraid any more - and in time they
carried on their loud conversation, standing by a wall in their
circular exclusion zone, where nobody came within two hundred metres
of them unless absolutely necessary.  And even then they stared 
constantly, watching for sudden movements, watching for that familiar
face that next week would be breaking into their garden shed or dumping
bags of glue over their back wall or running away down the street as
they opened their curtains in the dead of night to check on their car.
  He walked past the shops.  Half of them were boarded up now, the
public no longer needing their overpriced goods and the old fashioned
values of friendliness or service.  Instead the middle class wives
took their husbands' cars out of town to discount wholesalers to buy
baked beans for three pence a tin.  Outside each shop another group of
youths gathered - nothing to do, nowhere to go and no intention of
doing anything else for the rest of their lives.
  At the end of the pedestrianised zone the people disappeared away in
cloud-like dribs and drabs and the strains of conversation faded away
into the distance, replaced by the man made sounds of cars and trains, 
all of them heading away.  Away from the slums, away from the city, 
into the countryside so they could demolish the farms and spew a sea 
of asphalt over the fields.  Leaving the towns and all they stood for 
only to repeat their mistakes over and over again, forever.
  After a while he was approaching the coast.  He looked out upon the
waves and saw the floating tyres and the washed up bodies of sea birds
and fish.  He watched the smoke slowly rise from oil rigs in the far
distance, and the oily barges sliding past and underneath the bridge.
He climbed up the embankment towards that great steel and concrete
megalith and eventually reached a walkway - a quarter of a mile long
and begging to be traversed.
  He walked halfway across the bridge, reading the graffiti written by
the countless nameless, jobless, hopeless teenagers and felt for the
first time that he belonged.  The silent majority, the underdogs of
society.  All he had worked for, all his qualifications were just
pieces of paper floating by on the wind.  For now he was just the same
as the junkies in the park, and the single mothers and the thieves and
the underclass.  And he vowed never to return.

R e n d e z v o u s 

"It's been a long time," said Dan, after a lengthy silence.  Each of
us studied each of the others.  Taking in every last detail, half
remembering the good times of the past.  I wondered if we still knew
each other.
  Ten years is a long time to go without seeing somebody.  Friends
become strangers as strangers replace your friends.  Looking at the
three of us now, compared to the three of us then, I could no longer
pinpoint what made us click.
  "So where have you all been?" asked Pete.  Neither Dan or myself
replied immediately.  As always, each of us were waiting for the
others to answer.  I always thought friends should know when to speak
and when to be silent but we never did.  Had ever really been friends
at all or just three emotionally repressed individuals clinging to
each other as we tried to climb the slippery slope to adulthood?
  Dan had never been a decision maker so it was me who spoke first - I
remembered only too well the times we'd planned to go out and he'd
spent the days beforehand checking and double-checking the time and
place.  I often wondered how he would fit into "University life".
He'd always seen "University" as being something that assured you of a
well-paid job, a family and a nice car.  He'd never looked beyond
that, but why should he?
  "I've been around," I said, inexplicably avoiding expressing myself.
I felt that I had a "mystique" to keep up.  God knows why.  "What
happened to you?"
  "I'm married now," Dan said.  I knew that - Pete had been his best
man.  I hadn't been invited to the wedding.  It was just a simple
register office affair about five years ago.  Not long before that
we'd all lost touch.  Or at least I had.
  "And I'm working as an Analytical Engineer.", he continued.
  Analytical Engineer.  Everything I'd expected him to be, everything
I'd spent my life not wanting to become.  I turned to Pete.
  "I've just got another job as a record producer.  I've got a couple
of hot projects coming up!" he enthused.
  I'd often envied Pete.  Despite his percieved immaturity at school
he'd always had ambition.  He'd failed to get into University the
first time round, but instead took a year out.  In that year he
matured immensely and became self-motivated and in charge of his
future.  Me, I'd decided by the age of fifteen I wasn't going to waste
my life on exams and learning.  I didn't see the point any more.  I'd
half-expected to be dead by eighteen, anyway.
  "That's good, well done, guys," I said, forcing the words from my
mouth.  My mind had already decided that I should have done what Pete
did and it was punishing me for it.  Why?  The damage had already been
done.
  I pondered that that was how I'd spent my whole life.  Waiting for
somebody else to take my opportunities then immediately regretting it.
Envy never did me any good but I still let it take me over.
  It suddenly struck me that Pete and Dan weren't such strangers as
I'd assumed.  They'd probably been in touch with each other all this
time.  I had only bumped into them by chance:  wandering around a now
unfamiliar part of town looking for something to take my mind off the
world.  They were just /there/, standing by the bar in a near deserted
pub on a rainy Monday lunchtime.
  I hadn't recognised them at first.  They'd recognised me.  I thought
it was an act of God, a twist of fate making us all meet for the first
time since we were teenagers.  Now we were all in our late twenties
and rushing headlong into middle age.  Or at least I was.  They were
both doing just fine, as always.  I wondered if Pete had tied the knot
with his childhood sweetheart yet.  I made a bet with myself that he
had.
  "So are you still screwing Janet then, Pete?"
  He coughed, and reddened slightly.  "Yeah.  We're engaged."
  /Quelle Surprise!/  Trust Dan to still have some element of
"normality" left.  What was I going to do now?  All my one-time
friends were pairing off and becoming upwardly mobile bores.  I
noticed a mobile phone in Pete's inside pocket.  He'd  probably  left
it  hanging out to attract attention to it.  Dan's wedding ring
latched itself onto my eyes and I couldn't stop looking at it for a
long while.
  "Did you see Paul on TV the other  day?" asked Pete.  I shook my
head, remembering Paul's numerous failed attempts at breaking into the
art world.  Undoubtedly he was a TV presenter or something, earning
six-figure sums of money for doing bugger all.  I didn't watch TV any
more.
  I wasn't far from the truth.  Pete told me how Paul had just sold a
painting for twenty-thousand pounds.  I almost passed out.
  Once I had been paranoid and nearly destroyed everything I'd been
working towards.  The only person who nearly got to the root of the
problem was Pete.  We wandered  around a deserted park for an hour,
both of us trying to escape the tedium of sixth form life.  Both of us
rejecting the "party and study" atmosphere and swearing to do neither.
Yet both of us succumbed in the end.  He often half-heartedly talked
of the pointlessness of existence not knowing I had first hand
experience of it.  For a fleeting second I had considered telling him
everything, validating the advice I was giving him but the moment had
passed and still nobody knew my darkest  secrets.  Besides, I didn't
want him to think I was just an idocentric moaner.
  Once I would have been able to talk to Dan, but he and I had been
growing apart for years before we lost touch.  He was intent on
keeping himself to himself and so was I - hardly the basis for a
trusting relationship between friends.  He liked his secrets.  In
fact, he always used to spend half of his time making sure that all
but one of our "gang" didn't mention specific "things" to that person.
Usually somebody who wouldn't have cared less if it hadn't warranted
being kept under wraps.  Usually me.
  Realising my mind was rushing towards paranoia for the first time
since my youth I tried to reassert myself by changing tack.
  "Remember when you first took a lass to the cinema?" I asked Pete.
  "Arse!" he laughed.  I had taken it upon myself to wait for him to
leave and embarrass him on his first date.   I felt it was the least I
could do as a friend.
  Dan stared at me and then Pete.
  "You two never changed, did you?"
  We were giggling like a couple of teenagers.  Dan used to be the
worst offender.  You only had  to /mention/ a swear word and he was
having raptures.  Now he was a "scientist".  No doubt he was still in
touch with Keith, the school's "Oxford Student".  I wondered if he had
found life there are difficult as we had all enviously hoped he would.
I bore a huge grudge against him, mainly because if I had chosen to
/work/ in the sixth form instead of complaining about my own
inadequacies and sitting around with a guitar in my hand hoping to
become a pop star, that would  have been /me/.  I had once been the
"top swot" at school until I had been marked down as a "gifted
student".  The feeling of embarrassment and patronisation at being
singled out never died down.  When Keith was finally "chosen" to join
the "gifted students" (almost a year after me, as I had once taken
pleasure in boasting) he took it as the incentive it was meant to be.
  Pete took a sip of his drink.  Pete, the one who used to go to
parties and drink all of /two pints/ much to my amusement.
  Dan, whose over-protective mother only let him out after ten O'clock
when he first got a girlfriend at seventeen, was getting a pen out of
his jacket.
  "We'll have to keep in touch.  What's your number?"
  "I'm not on the telephone,"  I lied.  He would never have rung me
anyway, except perhaps to invite me to his wedding.  I could see
myself sitting in a pew on my own, watching him fumble through his
vows, watching Pete, his best man, grinning inanely at him, the two of
them sharing a joke, undoubtedly at my expense.  An unholy gathering
of everyone I thought I used to know, the ones Dan assured me in the
sixth form I would "really miss after a bit."  The ones who he thought
would miss me.  Of course this wasn't true.  For the next three years
while they whiled away their hours on "dissertations" and cramming in
last minute revision for "finals" I'd been sat at a computer, alone,
writing hundreds of thousands of unpublished words,  whiling away /my/
time on writing reports and studying for exams in a hundred and one
"training" schemes.
  As I stood up and left the pair of them for the final time I almost
turned back and told them about everything  that had happened to me as
a teenager, while we were simultaneously friends and virtual
strangers.  I almost told them how I had predicted the paths of their
lives almost perfectly and how I used to vow I would never take the
route in life that was expected of me.  But I changed my mind because
the truth hurt.
  We'd all ended up exactly the same in the end.

@node Glor " Morning Glory "

M o r n i n g   G l o r y 

7.28 AM. Semi darkness, semi awake.  His mind wanders.

"It gets  you  eventually.   Everyone,  no  matter  how  much  you kid
yourself, kid  others:   You'll  succumb  in  the  end  and  you  will
/change/.  Maybe you'll 'grow up', maybe  you'll turn into a gibbering
child.  Maybe you'll  unlock  previously  hidden  areas  of your mind.
Maybe you'll lose your  creative  instincts  altogether.  You've spent
your whole life wanting it, and when it stops you'll spend the rest of
your life wishing you could  still  get  it.   Maybe you're better off
without it, you think, but  maybe  you're  wrong.  You're dying for it
and you're worried you'll be the  only  person  in  the world to die a
virgin."

He turns over onto his back,  trying  to avoid crushing himself on the
way.

"They say your testosterone levels are highest in the morning.  Do you
think they're right...?  Well,  it  certainly  looks  like it...  'Up'
early this morning, eh?"

He realises his head hurts.

"Headache?  Over celebrating last night?   No.  Drowning your sorrows,
perhaps.  That was the  best  chance  you've  had  and  you wasted it,
didn't you.  Another half an hour and  you'd have been in her knickers
for sure."

He shakes his head, trying  to  get  the  unwanted thoughts out of his
head.  A record he heard yesterday  is  going around and around in his
head, in perfect stereo.

"Why did you have to  act  like  such  a  twat?  Why does shouting and
swearing and laughing and singing and  acting confident always have to
be so important?  Why do you have to hide away from yourself?  Why did
you walk back after bowling a strike  in ecstasy, look her in the eyes
then walk away  and  sit  with  your  head  in  your hands, wondering,
hoping.  You've got to  help  yourself.   No  other  fucker's going to
waste their time on you."

The distant sound of a dog barking hits his ears, and he almost climbs
out of bed.  Then the voice starts to speak again.

"Of course, she wouldn't really  be  interested,  anyway.  No way. She
was too attractive, too tall.  Wouldn't want to provoke her boyfriend,
would you.  You're only acting  like  this  because your he has beaten
you to it.  You don't  want  to  accept  what  your are.  You laugh at
those who have found  happiness  but  only  to  cover  up your hatred.
You're jealous.  You're jealous  and  you  can't  take  it.  You can't
fucking take it that you  really  /are/  what  you think you are.  You
have become what you always  knew  you  were  but tried to pretend you
weren't.  You sad, sad, sad bastard."

Vaguely, he wonders if  everyone  else  hears  the voice,  if everyone
else hates themselves as much as his mind does.

"They all think  you're  such  fun,  don't  they.   But  it backfires,
doesn't it.  It's so easy to  hide  behind  a frivolous mask that your
true self is lost  forever.   It's  all  very well being quick-witted,
always the first to find humour in  a situation, always happy to shout
daft words and act like an idiot but what do you do when you're alone,
other than regret it.  You don't seem  serious so they don't treat you
as if you are.  And then you  wonder why they never tell you anything.
Why should they - as far as  they're  concerned you don't give a shit.
You'd probably just laugh at them.  You're a fucking waste."

His arm is trapped under his body  and  he can't feel it properly.  He
moves it.  The sheets  move  with  his  body,  sticking  to his sweat-
dampened legs.

"Kill yourself.  It's easy.  You've got a knife hidden under your bed.
Just a few cuts and it'll all be  over.  It didn't hurt the last time,
and you only have to cut  a  little  bit  deeper  and you won't feel a
thing.  Kill yourself.  Go on, teach them a lesson."

A droning vacuum cleaner pierces the whistling silence.

"Or are you just going to  lie  back  like that and toss yourself off,
you don't want to waste a good opportunity, do you?"

Almost audibly, he tells his mindvoice  to  fuck off.  The clock reads
7.30.  He lets out a  deep  breath  through  his nose.  Somebody walks
into the room, climbs into his bed, kisses him softly.

At 11.30 he wakes up.
Alone.
