Below is a listing of the significant directories and their contents.


Bible      A set of ASCII files containing the Masoretic (Hebrew) text
      of the Bible, and 4 right-to-left Hebrew fonts in which to view
      the text. Also included are programs to display the text, verse
      by verse, optionally reciting the text aloud; to reformat the
      text by breaking large files up into smaller files, or changing
      the length of each line; to mask out vowels and/or cantillation
      marks to make word searches easier; converting the text into
      phonemes so the Amiga can read the text aloud; and displaying
      the numeric values of the verses for esoteric research.  The 
      right-to-left fonts can also be used in many word processors.
