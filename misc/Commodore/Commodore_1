|
| This message was posted on the Genie Starship by a former Commodore
| software engineer.  He lives in West Chester and is well connected with the
| company.  This is grim news but the source of it can not be doubted.
|
| =======================START OF MESSAGE================================
|
|
| On Wednesday, April 27, Commodore laid off 65% of it's remaining work force at
| the West Chester, Pennsylvania location.
|
| There were also layoffs at that location the previous Friday. The total number
| of employees there has dropped from approximately 65 to approximately 22.
| Almost all of the remaining staff are in the engineering department. There are
| a handful of people (from 2 to 5) in each of the software, hardware, and chip
| design groups as well as a remaining sysadmin and technical people useful in
| maintaining equipment.
|
| Commodore also closed its chip manufacturing plant in Norristown, PA,  and
| layed off it's 15 remaining employees.
|
| Sources inside Commodore say that there are currently only three staff members
| in Commodre's U.K. office, two in the German office and only three at the
| production facility in the Phillipines. All other non-U.S. facilities have
| been, or are being, liquidated. (The state of the Canadian subsidiary was
| unknown but is presumed to be on par with those in UK & Germany.)
|
| The remaining engineering staff believes it is being kept on in the hopes that
| a buyer can be found for the technology and that the remaining staff woould be
| in a position to hand over the technology (and possibly to follow the
| technology to new employment).
|
| A remaining manager said (off the record) that they expect Commodore to last
| "two, maybe three more weeks".
|
| ==========================END OF MESSAGE====================================
|
| Stick a fork in them, they're done.   Commodore is going down the toilet
| at last.  It's a fair chance that somebody will buy the technology at the
| soon to be held Commodore fire sale.  Whether they will keep the Amiga
| computer alive is another question.  It's not likely to happen.  As I
| said this is grim news but it's time to set aside the usual .advocacy
| fantasies and face cold reality.

|                COMMODORE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED TO LIQUIDATE
|

| CBU) announced today that its Board Of Directors has authorized the
| transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit of its creditors and

| By DINAH WISENBERG BRIN
|  Associated Press Writer
|
|    WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the
| personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of business.
|
|    The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees "for the
| benefit of its creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore
| Electronics Ltd., into voluntary liquidation.
|
|    "This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary liquidation of both
| companies," Commodore said in a brief statement.
|
|    Company executives could not immediately be reached Friday evening.
|
|    The company last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter ending
| Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost $77.2 million
| on sales of $237.7 million in the same period.
|
|    In the latest report, Commodore said financial limits had thwarted its
| ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new products,
| the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the company did most
| of its business.
|
|    The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last June
| 30.
|
|    Its stock, which had traded at around $3 per share before the quarterly
| results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87 1/2 cents per share on
| the New York Stock Exchange Friday.
|
|    "This is a company that briefly captured the attention of the American market
| and didn't go where the market was going," said David Coursey, editor of the
| newsletter P.C. Letter in San Mateo, Calif. "They just never managed to change
| with the marketplace."
|
|    While grabbing some market share and attention in the late 1970s, Commodore's
| products were something between PCs and game machines "and never quite became
| either," Coursey said.
|
|    Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter repair company in the Bronx.
| Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it to make
| calculators and then personal computers by the mid-1970s.
|
|    Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold to homes and
| co-founder Jack Tramiel became a highly-regarded figure in the fledgling PC
| industry.
|
|    By the early 1980s, it was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple Computer
| Inc. and IBM. Software manufacturers didn't create as much software for
| Commodore's Amiga line as it did for Apple and IBM-compatible machines.
|
|    In recent years, most of Commodore's business was in Europe.
|
|    NewTek Inc. of Topeka, Kan., created a product called Video Toaster that
| converted Commodore's Amiga to a video-editing system. The $2,500 product was
| popular with small advertising agencies and home hobbyists. The company's phones
| were busy Friday night.

|  Commodore International <CBU.N> to liquidate
|
|     NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuter) - Commodore International Ltd said it authorized
| the transfer of its assets to trustees for the benefit of its creditors and
| placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics Ltd into voluntary
| liquidation.
|     The company said this is the initial phase of an orderly liquidation of both
| companies, which are incorporated in the Bahamas, by the Bahamas Supreme Court.
