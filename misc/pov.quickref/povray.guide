   Persistance Of Vision RayTracer -- Quick Reference Guide

   Larry Tweed and Drew Wells TeXInfo'ed by Kent Dalton
(Kent.Dalton@FtCollinsCO.NCR.com)

   This document is designed as a quick reference for those already
familiar with the program POV-Ray. You should use POVRAY.DOC to learn
about POV-Ray and then use this document as a memory jogger or for
quick syntax checks. It is not meant to replace the main documents that
accompany POV-Ray.

   NOTE: This document is not complete or perfectly accurate in all
cases.       We judged it to be useful even with a few innacuracies and
its state       of completion. Hopefully, it will be useful to you.    
  If you can't find something here or can't understand what is here,   
   refer to POVRAY.DOC.

   Some entries have been left blank due to time constraints. A later
version of this document will contain text for these entries. For now,

     direction
     ---------
     Syntax: direction <# # #>
     
     Description: The direction vector is used in the camera block and specifies
                  the direction the camera is pointing with a vector. Normally,
                  this vector points straight ahead (<0 0 1>) and look_at is
                  used to point the camera. The direction vector should be used
                  to set the "length" of the camera lens. Small values are
                  similar to a wide-angle lens, large values are like a tele-photo
                  lens.

     light_source
     ------------
     Syntax: light_source { <x y z> color red # green # blue #}
     
     Description: To shed a little light on a scene, you must provide a
                  light_source. The center of the light is at the vector x, y
                  and z. The red, green, and blue color values define the color
                  of the light which is cast. The light_source itself is
                  invisible. A light source is treated as a shape even though it
                  cannot be seen. It may be used in CSG.

     Description: sky describes the orientation of the sky, which is not
                  necessarily the same as the UP direction. If sky is defined,
                  it must be defined before the look_at parameter.

                  in the ray tracing universe is the right hand side of the
                  image being generated. Usually, right <1.33 0 0>.

     height_field
     ------------
     Syntax: height_field { gif "file.gif" water_level # }
     
     Description: A height field is a rectangular mesh of triangles where the
                  height of a triangle at a certain X,Z point is controlled
                  by the number in a file at that same index. GIF, TGA and POT
                  files may be used as height fields. The water_level is
                  the height below which the untransformed height field is cut
                  off. The untransformed height field is similar in size to:

               color red # green # blue #
               spotlight
               point_at <x y z>

               falloff #
               tightness #
             }
     
     Description: A spotlight light_source emulates the behavior of a real
                  spotlight, projecting a cone of light. point_at specifies the
                  point in space that the light is aimed at. radius is the radius
                  in degrees of the circular "hotspot" at the center of the
                  spotlight's area of effect. falloff is the radius in degrees
                  that defines the area where the brightness falls off to zero.
                  Both values may range between 1 and 180. Tightness controls
                  how fast the brightness falls off at the edges. Low values
                  cause softer edges, high values create sharper edges.

             }
     
     Description: The up parameter describes the surface normal of the "up"
                  direction. up <0 1 0>, for example would have a "up" direction
                  in the positive y direction.

               texture { ... }
             }
     Description: objects are the basic building blocks. An object defines a shape
                  and associated textures. Objects may not be used in CSG, but
                  they may be used in composite objects.

               }
             }
     
     Description: clipped_by will "cut off" any part of the object that is outside
                  the clipping shape. This should not be confused with bounded_by.

                   shape {...}
                }
             }
     
     Description: A bounding shape helps speed rendering time in many cases. The
                  bounding shape is first tested by the raytracer. If the ray
                  does not strike the bounding shape, the raytracer does not need
                  to test or calculate any of the bounded objects.

     Syntax: object {
               ...
               no_shadow
             }
     
     Description: no_shadow causes an object to be transparent to all light
                  sources. The object will not cast a shadow. This feature is
                  especially useful for enclosing a light source to give the
                  illusion that the light source is actually visible with a shape.

             shape  { ... rotate <x y z> }
             texture{ ... rotate <x y z> }
     Description: rotate will move any element about the origin in x, y and z
                  degrees. It is important to note that if the object is not
                  centered at the origin, it will "orbit" the origin rather
                  than its current center.

             shape  { ... scale <x y z> }
             texture{ ... scale <x y z> }
     
     Description: scale will enlarge or reduce the size of any element.
                  If the values for x, y or z are greater than 1.0, the object
                  is enlarged. If the values are between 0.0 and 1.0, the object
                  is shrunk. Scale may also be use on textures.
                  NOTE: Scaling by zero will cause an error.

     texture
     -------
     Syntax:  object {

                texture {
                   (texture modifiers)
                }
              }
              shape { ... texture {...} }
     Description: The texture keyword begins a block which describes the appearance
                  of an object, but not the size. See the section on texture
                  modifiers for a list of available modifiers and their defaults.
                  A texture may be used inside a shape or object, but not
                  in a composite object.

             shape  { ... translate <x y z> }
             texture{ ... translate <x y z> }
     
     
     Description: translate moves the element in space by the number of units
                  specified by the x, y and z parameters. Translate is relative
                  to the element's current location. If the element is at <3 4 5>
                  and is translated by <1 -1 1>, the element is moved to <4 3 6>.
                  Normally, translate is used after scale because the scale will
                  "scale" the translate.

     Description: A plane is a flat surface which is infinite in all directions.
                  The surface normal (or orientation) of the plane is determined
                  by the x, y and z arguments. The d parameter specifies the

     Syntax: color red # green # blue # alpha #
     
     Description: The alpha property of a color determines how transparent the
                  color is. Values range from 0.0 (opaque) to 1.0 (totally
                  transparent). Transparency is a filter. Black is always
                  opaque. The color red with alpha 1 will only allow red light
                  through, and so on.

     Description: brilliance controls the tightness of diffuse illumination on
                  an object and adjusts the appearance of surface shininess. Values
                  from 3.0 to 10.0 can give a shiny or metallic appearance. The

             }
     
     Description: A color_map provides a palette for color patterns. A point on the
                  surface is located and it is determined which start_value
                  end_value pair the points falls within. The color is then
                  determined by smoothly blending the colors associated with
                  the start_value end_value pair. Values for start_value and
                  end_value range from 0.0 to 1.0.

     Description: The ior is the Index of Refraction. This value determines how
                  far light will bend as it passes through a texture. To be
                  effective, refraction should be set to 1 and the texture must
                  have some transparent colors that use alpha. A value of 1.0 will
                  not bend the light. Some typical ior values are 1.0 for air,

                  1.0 (Very Rough, large highlight) to 0.0005 (Very Smooth,
                  small highlight). The default, if no roughness is specified, is
                  0.05.

                specular #
             }
     
     Description: A specular highlight is similar to a phong highlight, but
                  provides a more credible spreading of the highlights near
                  the object horizons. Values for specular range from 0.0
                  (no highlighting) to 1.0 (bright highlighting). The size of
                  the highlight is determined by the roughness value.

     Description: tiles gives an effect similar to checker, but with textures
                  rather than just colors. The textures for tile1 and tile2
                  may also be layered, but only the first layer will be seen.

     Description: turbulence will distort a pattern so that it is not so "perfect".
                  Typcical values for turbulence range between 0.0 and 1.0, but
                  any value can be used.

     Description: wood used the supplied color map to create concentric cylindrical
                  bands of color centered on the Z axis. Small amounts of
                  turbulence will make the texture look more like real wood. There
                  is no turbulence by default.

     Description: wrinkles is a bump pattern that will give the appearance of a
                  wrinkled surface. Values for wrinkles range from 0.0 (no wrinkles
                  to 1.0 (very wrinkled)
