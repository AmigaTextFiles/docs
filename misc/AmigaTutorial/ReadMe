  Hi!  If you've got a printer, definitely print this puppy.  If not, well,
that's why it's not one great big huge file.

  The Intro and SysCon should be printed separately, the Parts can all be
printed together.

  If you don't have a printer, which perhaps is probable, then the absolute
first thing you should dig up off a BBS or from your local store is a
program called Less, which replaces your Type command with a MUCH better one.

  The Buster.info should be renamed to "CLI-Buster.info", mentioned later.

  The files Inlace and Nolace are Preferences settings, to be used with the
BBS program PrefCh.  The colors are no big deal, I just wanted you to have
the pointer.  I've tried a lot of them and this is my all-time favorite.

  The "8" and myfont.font are for the BBS program NewFont when you get it.
Put them in your fonts directory.  If you don't know how, you will soon.

  Take it slow, have fun, learn well!
