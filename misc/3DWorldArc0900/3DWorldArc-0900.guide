Nowhere. AFAIK it was put offline after one week of net-appearence,
because of license-problems. I tried to find it and failed, too...
The point is: it is illegal and the movie-company holding the rights to
alien seems to have good laywers...

Hi

I'm stuck to Andoria Slums. I searched every single corner [after I killed big
monster and after the 'roof' crashed], but  looks like Corben have nowhere to go.
I can't jump anywhere or find wayout. Anyone have luck?

Kind regards

Yes. I tried again tutorial and 'learned' definitelly that jump. But in this
level - it doesn't work...

Looks like Corben can reach the platform but won't climb :{

It is extremly hard :( The first 'hard' thing I experienced was when Corben had
to jump diagonally from crashed bridge [few levels back] to one of the two
tiny walls on the left and right of the bridge... But I did it after 30 tries :)

Unfortunatelly, I'm stuck in this level :{ After over 2 hours of jumping
around, I couldn't climb on the platform over the piece of debris...
[I hope it isn't a bug]. I'm pretty tired now...

Are there some cheats, like 'Fly' or something, to type in console? Pity that
game will end here... because Corben can't climb...

Unfortunatelly... no luck at all :( It is really impossible to climb there :(
I was trying over 2 hours...

Erm, any 'tips & tricks'? Is there a 'fly' command for this engine? :)

Don't remember whether it was in the slums or not, but there's also a
wall in a corridor somewhere, which is partially collapsed, and can be
removed by a few wacks of your staff. (Long time since I visited that
level )

If it's the same place I'm thinking of, I was stuck there for ages
too.  Eventually I found the ledge up, from the room where the dome
roof crashed in, was climbable after all.

In the chamber where the roof collapsed, you will find that one
particulary large piece of debris is lying below a hole in the wall. 

Now if you did go through the tutorial levels you might remember the
place where you had to grab the town key from the stack of boxes. The
jump you'll have to perform here is the same, jump and tap forward at
the same time to perform a sommersault in mid-air and grab the ledge
(this is done automatically) and pull up into the passage.

It's kind of tricky :-)

The sommersault is not strictly required, but it will make the jump
slightly higher. In the other case, you'll have to find the exact spot
from where to jump, and this is definately tedious work ;-)

I was stuck at that location for about an hour, but I wasted most of
that hour trying to find other ways out.  Eventually I spent several
minutes jumping around under the ledge trying different combinations
of holding the shift key or not, pressing forward then jump or
simultaneously, different starting places, etc.  Sorry I don't
remember the combination that finally worked.  I only did it once,
then saved.  At the time, I was surprised when Corvus' hands suddenly
gripped near the top of the ledge and he hauled himself up.  It was in
the middle of the ledge, between the 2 overhangs, and his hand-grip
seemed to be a little below the top of the ledge.  I don't remember a
somersault at all, but perhaps I wasn't concentrating.

One problem of the Quake2 engine is that if the server code is called too seldom
there are some problems in smooth movement/collisison detection. You may have
noticed it when walking down stairs with a low framerate. Another effect is
that you can jump slightly higher with higher framerates. So you may want to
try lower resolutions or other things to speed up rendering while performing
that jump.

That's an inherent problem of the Quake2 engine, it was simply not designed for
low framerates.

Kind Regards

Probably not. The difference is the clocking of the chip and memory, and
whatever gadgets the manufacturer put on it. There might be
compatibility issues between older and newer revisions of the same card,
but I don't expect any trouble elsewhere...

Which does not prove that it might not happen...

I hope it gets reality. We need whatever we can get. The Mediator
started an avalanche, now everyone wants to produce PCI slots (which
should have started YEARS ago).  I am not too sure about the specs of
the card, and PCI vs. AGP 2x might not make a difference at all, but of
course the AGP slot means you can pick almost every graphics card
(although PCI cards are readily available, sadly not from Matrox).

But that does not mean they don't exist. On the contrary, you can get

4/2000 etc.

We'll be writing drivers for the Voodoo 3, but the time frame entirely
depends on certain aspects. For one thing, the CGX drivers must be ready
for us to start working, and it must fit into the time frame. All three
of us are very busy at the moment. 

We'll also not be able to support each and every card that is available.
The Voodoo has open documentation and is therefore a good choice, but
for other cards it also depends on the manufacturer to provide
documentation.

This was exactly what I was trying to say. But I still get about 10 mails
per day with H2 as topic. I didn't subscribe to get my mailbox trashed.

You were right!!! Thank you! When I changed resolution from GL 640x480 to GL
320x200, I climbed there from the third time of trying [!] Without resizing
play screen, I would never climb there. I was trying over 4 hours just to jump
in last 2 days :)

p.s. Ok... I picked up everything I need on that level, but what then? There
is no exit or door. I arrived to another dead-end where I can only jump into
the water and will have 3 [or 4 I think] exits. I don't like idea to enter the
previously finished level... I arrived 2 levels back and found talking 'rat'
who wanted me to bring him a crystal [if I remember well]. But, as I didn't
find it, he told me 'to come back to him, when find a crystal'... Where to go now?

You can finish the quest of the healer in any order you like. You'll
have to go back again to the plaza from time to time, though, since the
stuff you're looking for is in oposite corners of the city... Use the
city map to find your way...

dont see why not...after all, PC people do this!

basically same chip, different clockspeeds and micron-layout

because in PC land thaey ahve AGP2x and 4x slots that actually do work at

most we can expect to be able to drive reasonably fast...heh. 25Mb/s

dont forget, Voodoo3 doesnt really use AGP. it just uses that slot so it 
looks good and gets the 2x xfer.

Yeah, considering the hassle you would have with different drivers for
each model, I also doubt there's a difference. Look at nVidia: The
Detonator drivers work on all chips from TNT to GeForce2. Although there
are of course differences between these chips, I would guess they have
at least the same 2d core, and a very similar, layered 3d core.

Yeah, soon means "as soon as I get the time and don't forget about it
because somehow my memory is getting a bit shaky and I have to write
things down"...

Anway, I've set up a list at eGroups. 
Subscription: hyperion-support-subscribe@egroups.com
URL: http://www.egroups.com/group/hyperion-support

This list will be used for general discussion of our stuff, including
questions about content (i.e. how do I stop Corvus from scratching is
back).

The only possibility is using PLIP (or SLIP), which will simulate a TCP
connection.

Btw, we have a support list now, so if there are questions about Heretic
2, please ask them there, you'll get a faster answer there, anyway...
(see my last mail for subscription details).

Nope. We have a demo of the Mac version out, and a Linux version is pending. 
However, the Amiga version is a bit behind still, and will take a few more 
weeks. This is because the sales of Heretic II have been so disappointing 
that we have to concentrate on the Mac and Linux version first.

you're still on this list. It's just very quiet.
This might change when first drivers for 3D gfx card (PCI) for Mediator
