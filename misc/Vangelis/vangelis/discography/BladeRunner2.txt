"Most  of the music contained in this album originates from recordings I made
in  London  in  1982,  whilst working on the score for the film BLADE RUNNER.
Finding  myself  unable  to  release these recordings at the time, it is with
great  pleasure  that  I  am able to do so now.  Some of the pieces contained
will  be known to you from the Original Soundtrack of the film, whilst others
are  appearing  here  for  the  first  time.   Looking back at RIDLEY SCOTT'S
powerful and evocative pictures left me as stimulated as before, and made the
recompiling of this music today, an enjoyable experience." - VANGELIS Athens,
April 1994
