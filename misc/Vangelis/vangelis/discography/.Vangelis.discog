1986      Travels With My Cello Vol 2 - Encore! (Julian Lloyd Webber)

          Julian Lloyd Webber (Cello)
          Vangelis (Synthesizers)

          ``Ever since my chance meeting two years ago with
          synthesizer-king Vangelis, I have been reminding him of
          his remark that the cello was the only  instrument he
          could not reproduce convincingly on his synthesizers.  I
          suggested that the only solution to his problem would be
          to write a piece specially for synthesizers - with cello.
          "Une apres-midi"  is the result. ''
