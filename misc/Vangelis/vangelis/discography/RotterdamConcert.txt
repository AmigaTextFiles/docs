                          The Concert In Rotterdam

                                     ***


During  June  1991,  Vangelis  celebrated  a  big concert in Rotterdam.  This
concert  has  been  organized  by  Eureka,  which  was  set  up to serve as a
Europe-wide   framework   to  encourage  further  collaboration  on  advanced
technology   projects.   The  concert  has  been  broadcasted  by  the  Dutch
Television,  and  some  short  snapshots  and videos are archived here.  Just
click  on  one  of  the  pictures  to  watch  the  movie.   This  material is
copyrighted by the Dutch Televions and may only be used for private purposes.
Thanks to J.W.  from the Netherlands, who supported us the video recordings.
