                                     ***


Vangelis, a name derived from his birth name of Evangelos O.  Papathanassiou,
is  widely known as a talented musician and composer of electronic music.  He
was born in Volos Greece on March 29, 1943.

He  is a very enigmatic figure, and prefers to stay out of the public eye and
do  what  he  does  best  - realize the music within him.  He is a charitable
individual  who  frequently  donates  him  time  to  perform concerts for the
preservation of the Acropolis.
