Welcome
-------

These are the example code files for use with the book

"Classic AmigaOS Programming: The Network" (ISBN  9798301294907)

If you have bought the book, thank you very much and I hope that
you will enjoy reading it and using its contents in your own
software.

If you do not own the book then please do have a look at it in
case it is of interest to you. It is available from Amazon as
well as other online book retailers. Feel free to use these files
without the book, although they may make less sense this way.



The code
--------

While writing the examples I aimed for readbility rather than
efficiency of the code. There is plenty of scope to make the code
faster as well as smaller, but this may make the code less obvious,
especially to coders who have only started to code for the Amiga
recently. 



Updates
-------

Over time I may update existing examples and add new examples to
the archive. Please feel free to check back on my website to see
if a newer version of these examples is avalable. The latest
version will be available from the download section, which is at:
