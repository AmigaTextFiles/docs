As requested...

Russian Black Bread:

Mix 4 c. unsifted rye flour and 3 c. unsifted white flour.

In a large bowl, mix
	2 1/2 c. of the flour mixture
	1 tsp. sugar
	2 tsp. salt
	2 c. whole bran cereal
	2 T. crushed caraway
	2 tsp. instant coffee
	2 tsp. onion powder
	1/2 tsp. crushed fennel seed
	2 pkgs. undissolved yeast

Combine in a saucepan
	2 1/2 c. water
	1/4 c. vinegar
	1/4 c. dark molasses
	1 square unsweetened chocolate
	1/4 c. margarine
Heat over low till very warm (120 to 130 deg F), Margarine and
chocolate need not melt.  Gradually add to cereal mixture and beat 2
minutes at medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally.  Add 1/2 c. of the
flour mixture.  Beat on high 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally.
Stir in enough additional flour mixture to make a soft dough.  Turn
onto lightly floured board.  Cover, let rise 15 minutes.  Knead till
smooth and elastic (10-15 minutes).  Dough may be sticky.  Place in
greased bowl.  Grease top of dough.  Cover, let rise till double (about
an hour).  Punch down.  Turn onto lightly floured board.  Divide in
half.  Shape in 5 inch diameter balls.  Place in greased 8 inch round
cake pans.  Grease tops of loaves.  Cover, let rise till doubled.  Bake
at 350 deg F 45-50 minutes.  Mix 1 tsp. cornstarch and 1/2 c. cold
water in small saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat till it
boils.  Boil and stir 1 minute.  As soon as bread is done, glaze and
bake 2-3 minutes more till set.

(All rising should be in warm place free from drafts)

This is a wonderful bread.  For a slightly lighter bread,
substitute 1 c. of white flour for 1 c. of the rye flour.

Enjoy,
Connie
