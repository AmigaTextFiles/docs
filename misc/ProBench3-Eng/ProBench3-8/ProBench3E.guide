@{u}6.1  ProBench3 - The new capabilities of the emulator@{uu}

ProBench3, announced as ProBench '96, is an Intuition Emulator of the new generation. It uses new technologies that make it more stable and faster, and therefore it uses less resources. The first rate performances of ProBench 1 and 2 have been improoved so that previous problems are avoided.

ProBench3 is the first emulator using a smart integrated memory management. A lot of improovements are, therefore, possible (like in speed and resource usage), which would not be otherwise possible.

Further to the improovents in the intuition emulation, ProBench3 can also run CyberGraphX applications in 16 bit modes. Together with WorkBench there is a lot of other graphics programs as well as other apllication programs (e.g. DTP program) in this category.

@{u}6.1.1.  The intuition emulator@{uu}

One of the most important new features of ProBench3 is, together with the CyberGraphX interface, the integrated memory management. It is, for the first time, permitted to not use the board's memory to only show graphics, but it is also allowed to store alternatively several graphic elements with no need of a buffer in the Amiga memory.

This drives to a FAST RAM saving of 2MB under Zorro II and 4MB under Zorro III and it makes possible to use more frequently the Blitter of the Merlin board. Owner of a Zorro III Amiga should run Merlin with ProBemch in the faster Zorro III mode as often as possible. You will find further information about the new memory management on te section @{" 6.2.3. New Features in the Gloabls Window " LINK "2.3 Changes in the Globals window"}

Besides this revolutionary new feature it has also changed the way ProBench integrates with the Amiga system. ProBench3 does no longer use the ProBenchSeg to add the needed patch on the Amiga system, but it works on the shared libraries concept. These are located in the logic volume LIBS: and are loaded on an as-needed-basis. Untill now ProBench 1 and 2 used HRGSystem-CardSys-Render-Tool libraries.

ProBench3 additionally uses the hrgemu.library which actually contains the emulation, and the cyberprobench.library which provides the same API of cybergraphics.library. Furthermore, ProBench3 uses homonimous monitor file which is normally located in DEVS:Monitors, but which can also be run from anyother location (Warning: the ProBench monitor can be activated from a shell environment only!).

This monitor contains, together with basic emulation functions your personal information and can be used only on your Merlin board. You only are responsible in case of damages which should arise from the use on another Merlin!

Through the usage of the shared libraries concept pieces of the emulation can be replaced in an essentially easier way. As you can notice from the history of ProBench, different libraries have been updated in a very particular order. Without shared libraries this will not be possible.

@{b}Disabling ProBench3@{ub}

In spite of the above, if you want to renounce to all Merlin software just for once, you don't need either to uninstall nor store ProBench3. You only have to hold down the right mouse button early during execution of Startup-Sequence (after reset). In this way all Merlin software will not patch your system.

@{b}IMPORTANT information about hrgblitter.library and pocessing power@{ub}

Since now two versions of hrgblitter.library exist.

As many users discovered, since a certain version of this library the emulation became substantially slower on A2000's. We have finally found a reason for this: Merlin, under Zorro II, is cached on all processors exept on A4000/040. This also causes caching of a register which is unfortunately masked in the VMEM field. This causes blits to wait a random time until caches are flushed.

This is an hardware problem which, unfortunately, can't be fixed (this occurs also with C='s BridgeBoard). The reason is that processor architecture doesn't know a cache-disable for Zorro II memory fields.

Anybody that uses his Merlin on a non-A4000/040 Amiga should disable his CPU's data cache. If then the emulation becomes faster, you should immediately copy the "UNI" version of the library in LIBS:!

In practice it already happens during installation. In case you want to change this later, you should rename it hrgblitter.library and put it in LIBS:!

@{B}HRGBlitter-UNI.library - Universal version@{UB}
(In the version string it has the annotation: CacheClear)

Computer:

@{u}6.1.2. CyberGraphX Emulation@{uu}

Since the first ProBench version we cared about how fine would be to have an Intuition emulation with more than 256 colors. With ProBench2 the blitter was able, in most cases, to show how quickly it can complete a Merlin graphic operation. Therefore our worries for a growing amount of data on higher color depths don't pose anymore. So, in winter '95, the first version of a 16 bit WorkBench emulator was born which worked under ProBench2. Although its speed was not comparable with today's speed this early version gave us the satisfaction to break the 256 colors limit.

Anyway in order to really exploit this color depth as well as to make system and appication software running on it aware we had to use another graphic system instead of our HRGSystem. At this time, EGS (unfortunately) had very few importance as an alternative system. As CyberGraphX (from Phase5's CyberVision) was developed as an interesting alternative we tried to get into cooperation with the developers of this system. Unfortunately they didn't show any interest in adapting their system to Merlin. We decided, therefore, to give our software a CyberGraphX compatible interface and make Merlin users able tu run CyberGraphX-capable software.

In spite of high costs and limited budget (renouncing to some features of Merlin) we saw, in January '96, that ProBench3 is able to run almost any CyberGraphX compatible software in 65536 colors, as well as it can reach very high speeds that can definitely compete with ProBench 1 and 2 in 8 bit mode.

Integration of CyberProBench derives from a library with the same name. Due to the fact that CyberGraphX compatible software uses a library called "cybergraphics.library", CyberProBench is installed under this library. From this some problems may arise. On one hand there should not be any library in the system with the same name. This will be the case where you apply a picture.datatype of version 43 and the cyberng.library (which is also known to the system as cybergraphics.library).

On the other hand you are not allowed, of course, to use any other CyberGraphX libraries, because those are not CyberProBench compatible. On AmiNet any update of cybergraphics.library are not interesting for you. Any corrections made there is not seen at all in the CyberProBench system. You can use cyberng.library if you disable ProBench holding down the right mouse button during boot. Anyhow, ProBench can't be started after this operation. Usually the use of cyberng.library (cybergraphics.library for using the new picture.datatype V43 with non-CyberGraphX-Amigas) is not interesting for you. As a matter of fact CyberPtoBench is enough compatible with most of the graphic software.

IMPORTANT:

Don't forget to activate the 16 bit modes by double clicking on the Display ID column (4000900x)! In this way they will be still available after rebooting.

@{u}6.1.3. Known problems in ProBench v3.0@{uu}

ProBench has to fight, as well as all other WorkBench Emulators tasks, with tasks that surely exist on any unmodified Amiga. Those can try to force the screen in a particular resolution or try to access the video hardware directly. Those are fully available on the Amiga and are not "unconform". They can lead to such modifications all around the system as if they are started from a WorkBench Emulation, but they can cause a system crash. For the time being there is no solution for this. The only thing to do is to not use those programs on WorkBench emulators.

Unfortunately we are not able to do anything against this. Other things are avoidable errors in the emulation. Few of them are still present in this version.

@{u}Known bugs in ProBench v3.0@{uu}

Some minterm combinations (however they never come across during our tests) are not masked under 16 bit modes or they are erroneously handled because of compatibility with CyberGraphX.

Sometimes (althought not very often) it can occur that some rastpot masks are not correctly folloewed (mostly under 16 bit modes, but as everybody should know thise programs shuld not be used in 16 bit). Isn't up to us to take care of these errors. In this cases the only solution is to make the programmer of the application aware and ask him for an update. So what is becoming quite easier because of the increase in the use of graphic boards.

Flood is very slowly. This is generally, however, enough for its purpose. As we know only one program that calls Flood(), which isn't an appication but a speed tester, you don't have much to worry.

Switching from one screen to another, sometimes blanking is disabled too early so that you can see building of new screen (what did not, however, recently happened).

@{b}@{u}6.2. ModeMaster - Changes/innovations in the mode editor@{uu}@{ub}

ModeMaster is the program with which you can very easily create video resolutions or only modify them.

For ProBench 3 some additional option were made possible/needed for the first time. Furthermore, ModeMaster has been ported to MUI3.6.

Warning! You are no more allowed to use ModeInfoPrefs from ProBench 1 and 2!

@{u}6.2.1. Changes in the main window@{uu}

In the main window you will only find two new buttons: "Reset IDs" and "Reset Names". The first one resets to standard setting assigned display IDs that are also used by Intuition to indicate a screen mode.

This becomes necessary if you are working with a mulfunctioning DisplayID database and you want to reset on a certain point.

"Reset Names" resets names associated with DisplayIDs to default names: "color depth Height x Width" (For example "8bit 800x600"). As you can associate, thanks to ModeMaster and ProBench3, a particualr name to any single DisplayID, we implemented this function to help you going back do default settings.

To use ProBench in 16 bit modes do the same as you are used to do for 8 bit modes. Chose the desired mode and click on the DisplayID column. List content should change to a number in the range over 0x4000900. Now save settings so that this mode will be available after the first reset either for Intuition (ScreenMode-requester) as well as for CyberGraphX.

Now you have to find a string gadget to enter resolution's name. This gadget may contain up to 32 characters and should be used to identify a resolution more quickly. So the mode "320*256" may become like "VGA, 640*512 HIRES INTERLACE", and so forth.

@{u}6.2.3. Changes in the Globals window@{uu}

The Globals window is working now as a control panel for several new ProBench3 options. These are, in details:

@{b}VMemBitMap@{ub}

It is allowed to manage hidden window areas in video RAM. This is a determining factor for opening an moving window speed. If this option is not enabled, the memory manging in the board is limited to screens. This option should be then disabled if a fast screen switch priority is higher.

@{b}VMemBobs@{ub}

Blitter objects like icons, or drag'n'drop objects can be kept in the board for a more quick movement. If for generation of a such (little) object video RAM must be flushed, this can lead, on one hand, to a slow down in moving bobs and, in second place to an unusefull flush of other graphic objects (windows or whole screens).

@{b}Deep Find Color@{ub}

Changing a screen's color depth from 16 to 8 bit through HRControl and with this option disabled, a fast and simple color conversion algorithm is used, otherwise a slow one, which gives better results, is used. This option doesn't work when a "normal" change is performed by ScreenMode requester.

@{b}Sprite Colors@{ub}

Mouse pointer colors are always resetted together with the screen colors or when its shape is redefined.

@{b}Disable Blitter@{ub}

It disables the Merlin blitter. This option is meant to limit error causes only. Usually you should keep blitter enabled!

@{b}Fix ShapeShifter-Screen@{ub}

This is an extra option for C. Bauer's outstanding Mac emulator. When this option is enabled, Mac screen is kept on the Board. By this can you avoid that the Mac-sign draws on another screen. For this option you must chose CyberGraphX as video driver. If you use XCalibur digitizer you cannot use any "fixed" ShapeShifer screens.

@{b}Optimize Layers@{ub}

This option leads to a faster window moving.

@{b}Force MerlinBitMaps@{ub}

When enabled, Merlin chunky bitmaps are used instead of Amiga planar ones. Merlin bitmaps are faster when using Merlin blitter, while Amiga bitmaps are faster when using Amiga blitter. Althoudh it is normally better to switch this option on, it may occasionally lead to wrong display, for instance in the color marker of colorwheel.gadget. Enable this if you want a fast and sometimes wrong display, disable this if you want an always correct but somewhat slower one.

@{b}Allocate BitMaps first in...@{ub}

Establish if and how memory managements work inside the board. For this three ways exist: (Merlin) video ram is used, and only when full it is flushed and Amiga memory is used. In the case not enough Amiga memory is available what may happen is unpredictable. (Merlin and Amiga) it is always possible to additionally allocate Amiga memory so that unpredictable results will not happen. Furthermore, flushing of graphics in video RAM is faster. This method, however, uses more Amiga memory than the first one does. (Amiga) Memory management can be completely disabled and only actual screen can be shown through the graphic memory. This is the slowest method and it still needs even more Amiga memory.

@{b}Max. BlitPlanes@{ub}

By this you establish when Blitter is detached from CPU for planar to chunky conversions. Although, under this circumstances, blitter speed can be higher it is more enjoyable to look at (i.e. flickering) to use blitter until a particular depth.

@{b}Optimize Spaces@{ub}

If, in a text, many white spaces appears, these can be drawn by a special routine. This can lead to a considerable speed increase when many spaces are in the output of programs, like in DirectoryOpus or text editors.

@{b}Copy areas min.@{ub}

Inicates the minimum space for Blitter enabling for copying areas. As preparing a copy operation whith blitter cannot happen at once, a fast CPU can be, up to a particular size, faster than Merlin Blitter.

@{b}Fill areas min.@{ub}

The same as Copy but referred to fill operation.

@{b}Line blit min.@{ub}

Here length/height of certain lines from which the blitter, by drawing, detaches from CPU are selected. Substantially same as for previous options applies. Also here a -1 exists to always draw with the CPU. Insert here a 0 to correct possible Merlin hardware troubles (wrong colors in vertical lines).

@{b}@{u}6.3.  HRControl - The universal commodity to drive ProBench v3.0@{uu}@{ub}

HRControl is a little commodity which contains some usefull functions to drive ProBench. It was created for the socalled "Power User" and should be only used when it is well known which consequences can arise from its use.

If  you are a user  who wants to take advantage from all functions of ProBench3, HRControl perfectly fits your needs.

@{u}Functions:@{uu}

HRControl is driven through hotkeys like most of the commodities. These hotkeys are set through ToolTypes (TT:) and shoud be chosen not to collide with other hotkeys in use.

HRControl uses LCOMMAND LSHIFT as a standard qualifier as well as the left amiga key plus the left alt key. Furthermore you have to hit another key to use the functins like:

@{b}a@{ub} puts monitorswitch on the amiga display status (TT: AMIGA)

@{b}b@{ub} puts monitorswitch on the merlin display (TT: BOARD)

@{b}t@{ub} toggles monitorswitch status (TT: TOGGLE)

@{b}k@{ub} closes the upper merlin screen (Be carefull !) (TT: KILL)

@{b}DEL@{ub} puts monitorswitch in visible switching (see ModeMaster) (TT: BSWITCH)

@{b}2@{ub} puts the scrren palette on the standard digitizer palette (TT: PALETTE2)

@{b}F1@{ub} grabs the upper screen in XPGI format (TT: GRABXPGI)

@{b}F2@{ub} grabs the upper screen in ILBM format (TT: GRABILBM)

@{b}F6@{ub} copies hidden parts of the upper screen into the videoram and considerably iprooves speed. (TT: UPRECTS)

@{b}F7@{ub} converts the upper screen from 8 to 16 bits, this is only possible if you have a 16 bit mode with the same resolution of the actual screen. (TT: DOXGA)

@{b}F8@{ub} does the opposite conversion done by F7. If on the 16 bit screen there is a 24 bit resolution working in 8 bit could be much slower.  (TT: UNDOXGA)

The last two functions should be only temporarily used

@{b}F9@{ub} Empties the video ram and loads on board the upper screen. In this case you can avoid a memory fragmentation (TT: FLUSHMEM)

@{b}F10@{ub} Loads the upper screen on the bord. This has meaning only if a program has to do its task always in the video ram. You shouldn't use this funcion with the digitizer. (TT: FIXSCREEN)

This is the new version compatible with ProBench v3.0. ProSpeed accellerates drawing of background patterns defined in WBPattern. To obtain this you must convert gaphics for IPrefs from planar to chunky. Due to technical reasons the original bitmap cannot be freely kept in CHIP RAM.

To install ProSpeed3 add this line @{b}BEFORE@{ub} IPrefs in you startup-sequence:
