NEW AMIGAGUIDE FORMAT -

Due to numerous requests HowToCode has now been rewritten into
AmigaGuide format! It's still readable as text files (just!)
if you haven't got AmigaGuide, but download it and use it, it's good!

* Please note this is a REPLACEMENT to text files howtocode1.txt
through howtocode6.txt. Sysops, please remove these earlier files
as they contain many mistakes. Thanks in advance...*

Thanks to:

Richard Aplin, Matthew Arnold, Dean Ashton, Andreas Axelsson
Michael Bauer, Bilbo the First/Hypenosis, Eddy Carroll, Mark Cassidy,
Nils Liaaen Corneliusen, Walter Dao, David Dustin, Chris Green,
Joep Grooten, Grue, Jim Hawkins, Arno Hollosi, Lars Holmgren,

for their comments and contributions, both rude and polite!

And Commodore - Pull your fingers out and **DISTRIBUTE** the V39
docs to *all* Amiga programmers.


Please note that this file is the work of many authors, although
the spelling mistakes are all my fault!

I apologise in advance for mistakes in HowToCode, I am unable to check
everything thoroughly and certainly not on all machines, and in
particular with AGA information so much misleading and contradictory
information is going around that it is inevitable that mistakes will
happen. Please point these out to me, however trivial! I promise
I won't be angry if 100 people point out the same mistake. If no
one does and everyone tells me later that they knew - then I will!

If you intend to use part or all of HTC in a Public Domain disk
magazine (or similar), please email me first. I *will* give
permission freely, but I want to make sure that only the latest
versions are published. Please also mention your request to
Carl-Henrik, especially if it concerns Vectors.txt since it will
be continually updated and debugged for some time from now.

All opinions expressed in this article are my own, and in no way

programming practices described in this text are ONLY applicable
for demo coding, and should not be used for Games and other
programming.

I didn't write this for fun, I wrote it for you to use!

If you want to make a contribution please email it to me:
I prefer plain ASCII set to no more than 75 column width, and
no tabs if possible (although I can fix text sent to me..)

If you strongly disagree with anything I write, or you want to send me
some source or demos to test on Amiga 1200/4000 etc, or you have
questions about Amiga programming, or suggestions for future articles,
or just want to chat about the best way to optimise automatic copperlist
generation code, then contact me via email at:
