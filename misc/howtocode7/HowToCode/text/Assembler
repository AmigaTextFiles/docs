@node seka "Don't use the K-Seka assembler!"

It's dead and buried. Get a real assembler. Hisoft Devpac is probably
the best all-round assembler, although I use ArgAsm which is
astonishingly fast. The same goes for hacked versions of Seka.

Is it any coincidence that almost every piece of really bad
code I see is written with Seka? No, I don't think so :-)

When buying an assembler check the following:

1. That it handles standard CBM style include files without
alteration.

2. That it allows multiple sections

3. That it can create both executable and linkable code

4. 68020+ support (especially if you want to program for A1200,
writing A1200 code without 68020 instructions is real stupid!)

Devpac 3.0 is probably the best all-round assembler at the moment.
People on a tighter budget could do worse than look at the
public domain A68K (It's much better than Seka!). I'd suggest
using Cygnus Ed as your Text Editor, or Turbo Text.

@node devpac "Devpac optimise mode produces crap code?"

If you're using Devpac 2.x and have found that the OPT o+ flag
produces crap code, then you need to add the option o3-. This is
indeed fixed in >=V3.02

Under certain circumstances the optimiser will optimise relocate
references in the first 64Kb of your code to word addressing, which
obviously isn't very good if AmigaDOS then loads your code above
65535, which is quite likely!

o3- disables short-word address optimising.

This isn't necessary if you're creating linkable code (with l+),
and indeed may be fixed in current versions of Devpac 3

My current option setup for Devpac is:

   opt   l+,o+,ow+,ow1-,ow2-,ow6-,d+,CHKIMM

l+ sets linkable code on (as I mix C and Assember in my current projects)

o+ enables optimise mode.

ow+ enables optimiser warnings (they act as errors with SLINK, so I edit
my source when I get an optimiser warning)

ow1- disables warnings on short backwards branch optimising

ow2- disables warnings on address register indirect with displacement zero
to address register indirect optimising, again I don't want to edit my code
if I have (for example)

         move.l   vs_vscreen1b(a0),a1  ; vs_vscreen1b = 0

ow6- disables warnings if short branches forwards can be made

d+ debug information on

CHKIMM - Check Immediate values. This will report an error if any
immediate addresses are used (the most common mistake in assembler
is to leave the # from a value). Address 4 (EXECBASE) is allowed, and
other fixed addesses (eg CUSTOM - $dff000) are allowed as long as
you add a .L to the end.

         add.l 123,d0         ; This now gives an error!
         LEA   (CUSTOM).L,a0  ; This doesn't.

@node argasm "Argasm produces crap code, whatever happens"

First, Argasm (unlike Devpac) from the Command Line or if called from
Arexx using Cygnus Ed (my prefered system) defaults to writing linkable
code, so if you want executable files you need to add

        opt l-    (disable linkable code)

If you find that your Argasm executables fail then check you haven't
got any BSR's across sections! Argasm seems to allow this, but of
course the code doesn't work. Jez 'Polygon' San from Argonaut software who
published ArgAsm says it's not a bug, but a feature of the linker...

Yeah right Jez...

But Argasm is *fast*, and it produces non-working code
*faster* than any other assembler :-)

Argonaut have abandoned ArgAsm so the last version (1.09d) is the
last. There will be no more, and it doesn't support 68020+
instructions, so I've stopped using it now.

@node arexx "Using Arexx with Cygnus Ed"

Cygnus Ed is a wonderful system: Included in the the utils/ced
directory are a few macros I wrote that may help you configure
your assembler to run in CED.

To install:

1. Make sure Rexxmast is running and you have copied the macros
to your REXX: directory (make a sys:rexx directory rather than
assigning REXX: to S:)

2. Add the line

ced -r

to your s:user-startup. Copy the CygnusEd Activator (on Cygnus
Ed V2.1x distribution disk) as C:ed, yes, that's right. Right
over the top of the abysmal Commodore editor!! You lose 200Kb of
fastram doing this, but believe me, it's worth it. Whenever you
need to use Cygnus Ed, either type ed filename and it loads
in a flash, or just press Right-ALT/Right-Shift/Return to open
a new CED session.

The CygnusEd Activator is public domain, and is in the utils
directory of this archive.

3. Install the commands on the keys you want to use (under the
special menu).

I currently have mine set up:

F1 - @{" devpac.ced " link howtocode:utils/ced/devpac.ced/MAIN}    - This calls Devpac to assemble the current file.
                        Output is file ram:test, errors to ram:errors

F2 - @{" argasm.ced " link howtocode:utils/ced/argasm.ced/MAIN}    - Same, but for Argasm


F3 - @{" errors.ced " link howtocode:utils/ced/errors.ced/MAIN}    - Open and close the error window. The error
                        window is not editable.

F10 - ram:Test        - Execute the code!


Other keys are free for C, TeX or whatever else you want to use...
