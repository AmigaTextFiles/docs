Hi!

I am sure that all of you know the RPG game called Evil`s Doom.  Well,    Titan
Computer  announced  a  long time ago "Evil`s Doom SpecialEdition" on their web
site.(http://www.titancomputer.de) As stated on the webpage,  this should be  a
"tuned-up" version of Evil`s Doom.



Titan Computer promised the following features :

 - wonderful hand-drawn gfx , nice soundtracks
 - lots of characters and places
 - lots of animation sequences
 - digitised english speech
 - 256 color hires gfx
 - AGA and GFX-Card support


Minimum hardware requirements :
    - min. 68020 , 4 Mb Fast Ram , 2x CD-ROM , 30 MB harddisk space

Some time ago I heard that Titan C. already finished the  game,  but  they  are
thinking  about  whether  is  it worth to be released. I dont know whether this
info is true or not, so i think they need some support from amiga users  to  be
convinced to release it, because everyone I talked to liked the game very much.

So I decided , - with some friends from my university - to collect e-mails from
you amiga users all over the world.

If  you want Titan Computer to release the game, and you think about buying it,
just drop me an E-mail at:

stone@softhome.net

(place the following line as subject : EVILSDOOM <YOUR REAL-NAME>

If there will be enough response,  I will send  the  list  to  Titan  Computer,
maybe  that  will  be  a  final impulse for them to release this great game and
thereby support the come-back of the amiga! (was it ever dead ???? ) :)


Best wishes:
