Amiga Arena Interview with Sigbjørn Skjæret,developer from the mpega.library clone!



*Please Introduce yourself for the Readers!

Hi, my name is Sigbjørn Skjæret, but as you probably can't even type that,
much less pronounce it, just call me CISC. ;)

*Since did you start to work with the Amiga?

Since the A500 was released (90/91?) and I just *had* to get one. ;)

*What Amiga Modell do you own?

I own 2 A500's (sadly no longer in use), 2 A4000's (1 is dead and stripped
for parts) and 1 A1200 .. The A4k and A1200 both have PPC cards, and the A4k
also has a CVPPC, IOBlix, Peggy+ and CV64. ;)

*What Version of the OS is running on your Computer?

3.1 and MorphOS

*Which Software Develope you?

Several through the times:
- Lots of ARexx scripts for various things...
- StreamMP3/RA
- RAPlay
- LAME (various Amiga compatabilities and porting)
- sndfile.library
- VCDGear port
- vpeg (a player for my Peggy+)
- clip
- waitx
- various ports
- MorphOS
- prolly lots of other things I've forgotten... ;)

*Can you tell us what your software is about?

Well, as you can see, my range is wide-spread, but my most recent release
which is a mpega.library clone, deals with some of the shortcomings of the
no-longer updated original...

*What created the idea in you to continue developing your software?

I will continue developing as long as I find it interesting (forever? ;) )
and/or useful (to me is enough. ;) )...

*How long took the development up to now?

Well, the mpega.library clone didn't really take that long .. it was an idea
I'd harboured for a long time, and finally started working on, and it was
pretty much whipped out in a matter of days (though, widespread due to having
a real life as well and all)... ;)

*What software are you using?

Heh, well, alot of stuff really, but I'd say I mostly use MorphOS, CEd, DOpus4
Frogger, SoftCinema, AmigaAMP, THOR, AmIRC and IBrowse...

*For what system are you developing?

AmigaOS/PowerUP/MorphOS, which are the systems I have devtools for.

*Would you support the "Amiga One"?

As I don't see it as likely that I will get one, it's more a question if they
will support me. ;)

*What can we expect from future versions?

Uhm, bugfixes (as if there are any bugs?! ;)) ), and ofcos updates when libmad
is updated...

There's also a couple of other projects that might resurface soon. ;)

BTW, I've gotten some reports indicating there's a problem with the 68k
library and certain programs (like AMPlifier and Prayer), I thought I fixed
this, but obviously only for PPC, I'm currently trying to work out the
problem, so expect (yet another) update soon...

*Don't you lose the fun and interest in developing when
 you see the small amount of feedback and money you get
 from the small Amiga market?

No way, never .. I don't even ask for money .. for me money is not an object
.. I do what I do because I like to do it .. what does put me off sometimes
though are ppl who whine about things they obviously have no clue about, and
expect you to listen to them, but I try to ignore those.

*Get you enough Feedback for you Software?

It varies, for some I get none, others I get alot .. many feedbacks say this
and this doesn't work etc (some not even elaborating on that), but sometimes
there's the really nice ones congratulating me on a job well done .. I like
the latter best... ;)

*When did you use your Amiga for the last time?

I use my Amiga(s) daily.

* What software have you bought for your Amiga last time?

Humm, I think that was Shogo.

* What software do you use till today?

The same as mentioned earlier...

* What soft/-hardware are you planning to buy?

Well, the bplan Pegasos board seems a likely candidate. ;)

* Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?

Not really per se .. not as many envision it .. I believe in the prolonged
life of "Amiga", through projects like MorphOS and AROS and similar...
