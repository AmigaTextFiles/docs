Amiga Arena Interview with Mario Esper - KidHTML
-----------------------------------------------

*Please Introduce yourself for the Readers!
My name is Marcio Esper, I'm from Brazil - South America.


*Since did you start to work with the Amiga?
I work with the Amiga since 1989, my first Amiga model was the
A2000/Toaster. But soon I got an A3000
(at the time, I used it mainly for BBS and programs development).

*What Amiga Modell do you own?
A1200, but it's broken now... :(
I'll try to fix soon...

*What Version of the OS is running on your Computer?
AmigaOS 3.9

*Which Software Develope you?
I developed a couple of Shareware programs,
found today on Aminet (IceHeX,IceMemo, IceBoot,
KidHTML, Shazzam, and some early game projects).


*Can you tell us what your software is about?
Mainly apps for use with the operation system, and HTML editing..and games
of course ;)


*What created the idea in you to continue developing your software?
The idea is to be a professional in the software business.


*How long took the development up to now?
Before Amiga development, I've done development on Tandy, TRS 80, Apple II
and other early computers. So, one can say it took around 20 years long. :)


*What software are you using?
I use ACE and Latice (on the Amiga);
on PC I use Flash, Visual Basic,
Borland C++ 3, etc.


*For what system are you developing?
For Amga and PC - Amiga specs are low.


*What can we expect from future versions?
More features and enhancements.


*Don't you lose the fun and interest in developing when
you see the small amount of feedback and money you get
from the small Amiga market?
Really, the Amiga market is small, but it's satisfying to develop for this
market because the end user demands more and you can achieve superior levels
in your work.

*Get you enough Feedback for you Software?
Sometimes I'm very happy when people comment about my work, so I know that
I'm not working in a lost cause.


*When did you use your Amiga for the last time?
Unfortunately, my real Amiga is broken, but I'm currently using UAE until I
fix the real one.

* What software have you bought for your Amiga last time?
Amiga OS 3.9.


* What software do you use till today?
Brilliance and ImageFX, and of course, KidHTML ;)


* What soft/-hardware are you planning to buy?
AmigaOS XL.


*Would you support the Amiga One?
Of course, if possible. I need to know the AmigaONE software development
kits, to exactly know what will be possible.


* Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?
I believe in a expansion of the Amiga in 'concept'.
