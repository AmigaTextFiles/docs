Amiga Arena Interview

*Please Introduce yourself for the Readers!
My name is Peter Armann, I'm 20 years old and I'm a university student in England studying for a degree in Mathematics.

*Since did you Start to Work with the Amiga?
After owning a Commodore 128, I got my first Amiga in 1993 - an Amiga 500+. I upgraded it by adding an Alfapower HD controller with 420Mb HD and 8Mb Fast RAM, and used it to develop "The Legend of the Elves".

*Which Amiga Modell have you got?
I recently bought an Amiga 1200 in a Power Tower with an 040 processor and 16Mb RAM. No PPC or graphics card yet though....

*Which Amiga OS Version is used by you?
I bought AmigaOS 3.5 along with my new A1200, but use OS3.1 on my A500+.

*Which Software Develope you?
So far, I have only developed, with Gary Walkden, one game: "The Legend of the Elves". Unfortunately, even this wasn't finished completely, and we ended up releasing only the first part of the game as freeware to the Amiga community.

*Would you continue Develope for your Software?
Since "The Legend of the Elves" initial release, I have produced a number of updates and bug fixes to improve the game, many of which have been suggested by the users. The current version is 1.5, and this will probably be the last. Unfortunately, the second part of the game will never be written, but that doesn't mean to say that I won't write more games for the Amiga in the future.

*Get you enough Feedback and Registration for you Software?
I was amazed by the number of people registering "The Legend of the Elves" and particularly those filling in the form on the website (www.ericelf.freeserve.co.uk) to download it. The comments written on the registration form and in e-mails to me have been very gratefully received. It's great to know that so many people have enjoyed playing TLOTE, even though it was initially just a "fun" project giving us something to do in the summer holidays!

*Would you Develope your Software for the AmigaOne?
I don't think "The Legend of the Elves" warrants being ported to the AmigaOne. If there was a demand for "retro-style" games, I might consider it, although being written in AMOS, it might be quite difficult to do. I think I'll leave TLOTE to the Classic Amiga line!

*Would you change to the New Amiga?
I am definitely looking forward to its release and, depending on its price, will be buying one sooner-or-later.

*When have you used your Amiga at last?
I last used my Amiga today to play HBMonopoly after exploring the latest Amiga Active CD.

*Which was your last Soft/Hardware Product you buy?
The last hardware I bought was my new Amiga 1200, and along with it AmigaOS 3.5.

*Which Software used you on you Amiga?
I use AMOS Professional v2.0, along with Personal Paint 7 and Octamed to develop "The Legend of the Elves". I also use Final Writer and Pagesetter 3 amongst many PD products.

*Which Soft/Hardware would you buy in the Future?
I would like to buy a PPC accelerator and graphics card, although I cannot afford it at the moment. After that, some games that take advantage of this hardware! My first task, however, is to get my Amiga on the Internet (I currently use a Windoze PeeCee - sorry!)

*Do you belive on the Amiga comeback?
Definitely, although I'm very cautious after all the false starts that the Amiga has had over the past few years. This time, it's looking much more promising, and I have every faith in Amiga to fulfil their Amiga dream.

Thank you for your Answer!
