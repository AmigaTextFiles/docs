 *Please introduce yourself to the readers!*
 My name is Nicolas Ramz (Nogfx).
 I'm a 21 years old and I study Mathematics/Computing in Clermont-Ferrand
(center of FRANCE).
 

 * When did you start working with the Amiga?*
 I first bought an A500 in 1989: this was my very first computer
 and I only used it to play games. Just after the fall of
 Commodore I really believed in a comeback of the Amiga so
 I bought an A1200 and started to program in BlitzBasic.
 
 *Which Amiga model do you own*
 A1200/030 and A2000B  

 *Which version of the operating system is running on your computer?*
 AmigaOS 3.1(1200) and AmigaOS 1.3 (2000) 

 *Which software are you developing?*
 I'm currently most working on an Amiga68k ScummVM port.   

 *Can you tell us what your software is about?*
 ScummVM is an open-source interpreter for the so-called Scumm scripts
 used in old LucasArts games: with this program, one can finally play great
 games such as Day of The Tentacle on the Amiga.
 
 FlashNG is a small portable Arkanoid clone (currently available for Amiga,
 MS/DOS and Win9x) 

 *What has created the idea in you to continue developing your software?*
 Well, I always wanted to develop games... especially adventure games.
 After finishing the Windows port of FlashNG, I heard of ScummVM but
 unfortunately, no one wanted to make an AGA port of it: thinking it
 would be too slow. I was convinced AGA was not that slow in 320x200 so 
 I started to port it... 

 *How long has the development taken so far?*
 My first program is a small tool for Aminet CDs called "DreamCDGuide".
 The first version (written in BlitzBasic) has been released in 1997.
 One or two years later I released a new version re-written in C/MUI.

 I also commited some changes to the StrICQ GUI but the first "real" project
 I worked on is FlashNG.
 
 The original Turbo-Pascal MS/DOS version of FlashNG was written 2 years ago.
 The Amiga/FreePascal port only took me a couple of days. It then took me a
 lot of time to rewrite it into C (actually, I was learning C at the same
 time I was porting FlashNG from Pascal to C).

 Thanks to the work I already did in FlashNG, I have been able to make ScummVM
 work under AGA into one day and it took me about 2 weeks to make it really
 usable. But if I add the time used to download and configure GCC it is a 
 LOT MORE than that !   

 *Which software are you using for developing?*
 GCC (AmigaOS) and LCC (Win32) 

 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*
 For AmigaOS 3.1 

 *Which OS will you support in the future?*
 I don't know: I will choose what OS to support when they are released.  

 *What can we expect of future versions?*
 ScummVM: it depends on the time I'll have to work on it... 
 Sound support in Amiga version of FlashNG. 

 *Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the
 small amount of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?*
 The Amiga/AmigaOS has a really "clean" and compact design: I'm still working
 with it because I like it and because I easily learn a lot of things 
 (unlike when working on OSs such as Win or Linux). 
 If I wanted to have some feedback I would not program for Amiga anymore. 
   
* Do you receive enough feedback for your software?*
 Considering the time I spend working on it, I don't receive enough feedback.
 But considering the Amiga "market", I think it's not so bad: I have been
 impressed by the feedback I received for ScummVM_AGA. 

 *When did you last use your Amiga?*
 I'm using it to answer this Interview.

 *Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?*
 The last soft I bought is a game: Shadow of the Third Moon.
 
 *Which software do you still use?*
 DOpus, C Compilers and IBrowse
 
 *Which hard/software are you planning to buy?*
 Nothing. I'm waiting for something different than those PC/Macs, not
something
 /superior /compared with everything else: I know it is not possible but at 
 least something /different/. 
 If nothing is released, one day, I'll have to switch to Pc/Mac...
 
 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*
 Please don't blame me... I think it's really too late: the AmigaOS is a great
 OS but lacks a lot of things such as Memory Protection, Ressource tracking
 (which implies a total rewrite of the kernel) and "Multimedia" apps. 
 => It will take a long time to add these functionalities to the actual AmigaOS
 (and I am not talking about drivers issues...). 
 
 MorphOS seems to be the closest to achieve this but I don't think they have
 the ressources (in terms of Money and Skilled people) to make the Amiga comeback.
 
 As for the AmigaDE, I don't know what market they are targeting with their
 small PD-Quality games. In two years they only released a modified Tao/Elate
 kernel: they'll have to do a lot more to make the Amiga comeback...
  
 *Your final words for the readers?*
 Continue to Support the Amiga Developers and instead of wasting time 
 saying "Windows Suc...", take a compiler and write Amiga apps...

 Nogfx.
