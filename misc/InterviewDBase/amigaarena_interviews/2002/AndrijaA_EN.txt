 *Please introduce yourself to the readers!*

 My name is Andrija Antonijevic, I'm 23 years old student of Mathematical
 University in Belgrade.

 *When did you start working with the Amiga?*

 I bought my Amiga at the end of 1995, but I used every opportunity I had
 to work on my friends Amiga 500+ before that :)

 *Which Amiga model do you own*

 A1200 with Blizzard060/50 MHz and a network card, but I'm considering buying
 a PPC board and putting everything into a tower in the near future.

 *Which version of the operating system is running on your computer?*

 OS3.9

 *Which software are you developing?*

 I'm currently mostly working on Charon and AmiSSL, I've dropped support
 for HTTPResume (since Charon is something like HTTPResume - new generation).

 *Can you tell us what your software is about?*

 Well it's mostly networking software, way or the other.

 *What has created the idea in you to continue developing your software?*

 I like programming, if can be very fulfilling and that keeps me going.

 *How long has the development taken so far?*

 It depends how you look at it. I started working on HTTPResume AFAIR in
 1997 and it slowly evolved to Charon in 2000, and now in 2002 it's at
 version 1.98. So it has taken either 5 or 2 years of on and off
 development.

 *Which software are you using for developing?*

 SAS/C as compiler and some GNU tools.

 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*

 Currently for AmigaOS, if I buy that PPC board, I might be doing some
 programming for a PPC OS.

 *Which OS will you support in the future?*

 I cannot say. It's very hard to predict anything when Amiga development
 is in question, so I'll just wait and see how things are going.

 *What can we expect of future versions?*

 I have a large number of things planned, but I wouldn't want to give them
 away, I prefer to surprise the users :)

 *Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the small amount
  of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?*

 Not really. It's a fact that you can't make much money from the small Amiga
 market, but if you like what you do and you get even minimal positive feedback
 from the users, it's enough to keep you going.

 *Do you receive enough feedback for your software?*

 People write about things that they like and what they would like added or
 improved just about enough :)

 *When did you last use your Amiga?*

 Today. There was a 6-12 months period when I was too busy to use it
 regularly (and Charon development suffered because of that) but
 fortunately, that has changed.

 *Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?*

 Let me see... Currently, there's almost no new software out there, mostly
 updates. And I'm either translating or betatesting most of the software
 that I'm using so I already have registered versions. The last thing I can
 remember buying is SAS/C. So much about the size of the Amiga market :(

 *Which software do you still use?*

 DOpus 4.12, programming tools, Ibrowse/AWeb, Thor and Charon :)

 *Which hard/software are you planning to buy?*

 Currently, I'm planning to buy a PPC board and a tower.

 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*

 I can only hope... There are some interesting projects that might do
 the trick, but you can never tell.

 *Your final words for the readers?*

 Well, let's just hope that this year we'll all see some Amiga projects
 that will make a difference.
