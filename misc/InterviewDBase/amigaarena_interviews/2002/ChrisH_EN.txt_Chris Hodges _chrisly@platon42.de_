 *Hi Chris, can you please tell us a few words about yourself and your
  amiga history?*

 Being brought up in a suburb of Munich, Germany, next to lots of  computers
 and  slightly  insane  people,  a rollercoaster of ups and downs, the Amiga
 offered a more or less constantly pleasant time (4844 of about 9418 days so
 far).  Obviously,  and with determination, I'm studying computer science at
 the Munich University of Technology in Munich. I like  fries  with  vanilla
 ice.I can clap using only  one  hand.And  with  the Amiga I'm doing
 everything I want to do: That's freedom I need.

 *People visiting your homepage will notice, that there's a large track
  record on software written for the Amiga, including a lot of PD games.
  Do you have plans to write a new game or rework some of your classics
  like "Tubes" or "F.T.C"?*

 For some years now about 20MB of graphics  and data is waiting on my
 harddisk for me to be revived.It's from a game I once started with Andreas
 Lindinger in my dark days of my youth for the  Wintel  boxes,  but  it  was
 never  completed. And then, there are some ideas for Tubes II. However, the
 older you get, the less time you've got for such kinds of projects. Anyway,
 writing games always has been a lot of fun.

 *Let's get to your current software project "Poseidon USB", which has been
  developed for the USB boards "Highway" and "Subway".
  Which duties does "Poseidon" cover for these or other USB cards?*

 Well, Poseidon is a so-called  USB  stack.  The  software  can  be  roughly
 divided  into  three  parts:  The  low-level hardware drivers, that map the
 actual USB host controllers to the Amiga  system,  then  there's  the  main
 library,  that  does the management (and other services). Finally the class
 drivers add the functionality of the USB devices to  the  system,  such  as
 mouse  or keyboard handling, or mounting partitions of a flash card reader,
 so that it can be accessed by the user.

 *What made you develop "Poseidon USB"?*

 Michael Böhmer, who built the Highway and Subway cards a long time ago,  of
 course  wanted  to sell them. However,the software wasn't ready. In march,
 still nothing working was present, so Ijumped in  as  backup.I actually
 would have written my own stack anyway as I reckoned, that neither AmigaOS4
 stack nor the original solution would be available to MorphOS.I didn't
 want  the  market to split again and I thought, that blue butter flies much
 further than just to Sirion. Well, three weeks later I had a pretty  usable
 design and a working USB mouse driver.

 *How is the decision made, if a driver for hardware XY is going to be
  written or ported?*

 The hardware has to support the USB standards or if not, the user base must
 be  large  enough.Obviously, I need to have access to the hardware itself
 and the amount of work needed must be somewhat sensible.It doesn't make
 any sense to write a driver for Winmodems for example.

 *Will "Poseidon USB" support other host controller boards in future, or,
  which boards does it support right now?*

 Generally speaking, anyone can write a hardware driver for an USB host
 controller,  no  matter,if this for zorro boards, PCMCIA or PCI chipsets.
 Hence, I do not have the time nor the required hardware to development
 these myself.

 Currently,there are drivers for the Highway/Subway, Thylacine (beta), GRex
 and  Pegasos,Spider USB (PCI/Mediator).A driver for OpenPCI (Prometheus,
 GRex, MorphOS,Berniethlon) is currently in development,  but  doesn't  yet
 run.

 *How long did you take to develop this software until now?*

 Development startedin march and I've been working on it with a few breaks
 due to my studies.However,I cannottell you how much time I spent exactly.
  
 *Which software are you using for development?*

 GoldED as editor, SAS/C for the 68k version, GCC for the  MorphOS  version,
 CyberGuard,  BDebug, SmartCrash, MungWall, MuForce, PatchWork, Sashimi. And
 lots of lovely music by Aimee Mann.

 *How long do you think you will stick to writing new drivers?*

 Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support  it  for  your
 whole life. Well, I guess this means until Poseidon is an adult.

 *Which are the features for "Poseidon USB" that you would emphasize on?*

 It's stable,has a clean  design and easy to use for both users and
 developers.And,its  programmer has a very subtle kind of humor. There a
 long manual,which nobody ever reads.And people have found million ways to
 misspell "Poseidon" or "Trident" (maybe I should setup a contest?). Uhm, it
 can be made reset resident.

 *What can we expect of future versions?*

 The HID class for magic carpets,fire alarms  and  refrigerators.Ethernet
 drivers  (however, I still recommend the Norway over USB ethernet). Scanner
 drivers (when I get one eventually). And of course,  satisfying  the  never
 ending wishes of the users.

 *"Poseidon USB" can be used by other vendors as well, as the users have to
  register for the corresponding USB host controller (except for
  Highway/Subway users). Although this a good idea to make "Poseidon USB"
  available to more people (users/developers), aren't you afraid of more
  cracked keyfiles popping up and Poseidon being used illegally, compromising
  your work?*

 Good luck to these sad people trying to create cracked keyfiles.I've spend
 several  weeks getting into new and safe cryptography algorithms.I know,
 this doesn't help against manipulated versions  of the  software package.
 Therefore,I try to keep as much updates coming as possible. Giving away
 legally obtained keyfiles would be plain stupid, as the complete name and
 address is stored in each keyfile and is displayed in Trident.

 Though I haven't written Poseidon to make a killing,it is utterly
 devastating to find out that cracked copies are floating somewhere on the
 net (just like it happened  with  Deli14BitGenie, which  was  uncripped
 postcardware:I stopped its development right afterI was told about it).
 It's a bit depressing to see, how  much  money people are  spending  on
 hardware, but aren't willing to pay the ridiculous small fees of software.

 *Does the work and the effort pay off for the actually non-existing Amiga
  market?*

 Does it pay to paint a picture? To write a poem? I'm having much  fun  with
 my Amiga and it allows me to put my creativity into something. And whenever
 a mail arrives from a happy and content user, or when you meet people like
 the  ones  at  O.A.S.E. in Graz, Austria, the answer is definately: Yes! It pays off!

 *"Poseidon USB" is now available through "IOSpirit" by Felix Schwarz,
   what do you expect from this co-operation?*

 That's simple: So  that  the  users,  who  *want*  to  register,  have  the
 *possibility*  to  register.  Prior  to this contract, buying a licence was
 rather slow via snail mail and not that straight forward.

 *Given the eagerly awaited new generation computer systems, USB for the
  classic Amiga computers seems to be a dead horse, concerning development
  and costs, isn't it?*

 First of all, Poseidon is not limited to the 'classics'. But you are right:
 All these announcements (and delaying the release further and further) keep
 the users from spending their money in existing and available hardware  for
 their  old  Amigas. That's killing the market and the dealers are suffering
 from this, too. People still believing that they could get back  more  than
 the  costs  for  development,  or even make a living with an Amiga product,
 well, these guys probably have read too much of Platon's "Ideal state" ;)

 *Is it still worth to invest in new hardware for the Amiga in your opinion?*

 In fact, with  USB  you  can  still  use  your  hardware  (except  for  the
 controller)  on  your  next  machine  (whatever that might be, maybe even a
 Wintel box or MAC?). Even Michael BÃ¶hmer doesn't use floppy disks  anymore,
 but instead copies the data onto a compact flash card and just connects the
 reader to another machine to get the data  off it  very  quickly.
 And moreover, your old machine doesn't vanish in haze, just because you bought
 a Pegasos, does it?

 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*

 I never got curious on AmigaDE, even if the idea sounds  nice.  Same  thing
 with  x86,  don't expect to see anything from me in this direction, I think
 it's a cul-de-sac. Poseidon has been developed for 68K AmigaOS and  MorphOS
 PPC native.

 *Which operation system are you going to support in future?
  What are the reasons for you to do so?*

 Certainly, my old Amiga will be supported until it breaks down into pieces.
 However,  my  future  path will be definately MorphOS, as the atmosphere is
 more than plain oxygen there. There're  many chances for a good, new
 operating  system. Many people just don't  know, how many benefits the
 AmigaOS has,that you cannot find on any other system. Obviously, large
 parts need to be designed from scratch To my opinion, the MorphOS team are
 the ones, who can recapture and reignitethe spirit (I'm  sure  there  are
 some of the  best  developers in the AmigaOS4 team aswell). In this team,
 people are emphasizing more on personal contact and human communcation than
 on  exclusive  and  commercial contracts. It's not so important to me, what
 the box is labeled. And the A-Box is just the beginning.

 *What features do you miss on the AmigaOS for developing?*

 Hm. Good question. Except for memory protection, which can be added already
 partly by Guardian Angel,I can only think of a "make what-I-have-in-mind" target.

 *What features would you wish for the development on the Amiga?*

 A second monitor and an automatically self-cleaning (non-virtual) desk.

 *Which hardware or software do you plan buying?*

 If I ever will have some spare time again, I'd really like  to  guy  a  few
 games. The demo version of Payback was quite impressing and I'd like to see
 Simon I & II, too. Concerning hardware, I guess some USB stuff  (having  to
 write the drivers for it then ;) ) and of course, a Pegasos machine.

 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*

 es this even really matter? The question is:Am I pleased with my
 computer  system? Can  I be proud of it? Do I prefer it to these anonymous
 wintel boxes or one-button-MACs? What do I really want? That's what matters
 and nothing else.I'm an Amiga user, because I'm enjoying it (and because I
 like my student colleagues making fun out of me, still being a  poor  Amiga
 guy). Moreover, I do know exactly, why I do love this machine.

 *Your final words for the readers?*

 Things fall down. People look up. And when it rains, it pours.
