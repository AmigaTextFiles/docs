If you`ve got rev2b of the 1200 motherboard I`ve had the same problem. I was
told that it`s a timing problem on the motherboard. The solution here was to
set max transfer rate on your boot partition down to 0xFFFF with hdtoolbox.

Well, I think you can turn it on/off with a tooltype. I don't

	Hello Boyz!

I have a PPC603/175 in a desktop case(with an LC040:). It had been 
VERY HOT before I turned the fan upside-down. Now, it is only HOT:)
Anyway, I haven't seen any "Privilege violation" errors(I use WOS). I 
don't remember, if I tried to use several ppc apps in one time. I 
dont't need to do that(maybe if I would have a BVision card...) You 
can say that my PPC is running "only" on 175Mhz and that's why 	 
don't get any errors, but I heard several times, that IBM PPCs are 
bigger and warmer than MOTOROLA PPCs. So I think it has got the same 
temperature as a 603/233, maybe my cpu is (much)warmer... I will 
try PPC multitasking within some days, when I go home.

	Regards,
	Pedro.

I think I've finally tracked down what's causing the crashes on the CSPPC. A
FAQ on the VT website of all places explains very clearly the problem I'm
having and indicates that it is indeed due to the rev 9 Buster. It's not
the CSPPC that's locking up. It's the Zorro III bus that's locking up from
the overloading.

Thanks to all for the help.

Fair enough....thanks for the info...just wanted to make the point about the
history via cgx3dvirgin.library

The whole program tends to be a little unstable...maybe it'd benefit from a
overhaul and transfer to WarpUp anyway....

My suggestion was just because I've very recently discover this pb. But BTW
I had also another possible explication (yes, one more) and in fact i'm
really wondering if this could cause pbs in the future: The Stack! Yes, it
is now well known that all the Warp-os (and some Power-up) software seems
to need a really huge stack (500000 on most case). So what happen if you
launch 2 or more of those "stack-hungry" apps? Do you have to define a
500000 stack for each PPC apps running on your system, or do they share a
unique stack, and so have we to increase that stack a bit more?
I think this question not only concern ROJ's problem.

I haven't found it! I use the "speedhack" option by default, but it doesn't
seem to work with mov files! If someone have a more precise clue...

If you open a shell and do the stack command and then run programs
from the shell, they will each take the size specified by the stack 
command.  If you use scripts and IconX, they will have to have a
stack command in the script for each one seperately.  If they are
run from WB, they take the stack specified by their respective icon.
Two programs run from the same shell do not share the same stack; only
the size is the same.

This is more Compiler-Specific than Kernel-Specific. Programs compiled with 
StormC, vbcc (both used with WarpUP) and gcc (used with WarpUP and PowerUP) do 
not support a command to raise the stack automatically. Of course it is 
possible to check before starting a program if the stack is big enough, or 
even launching the program inside a second task - using for example a GUI - 
which automatically raises the stack, but few people do it. You will notice 
that "stack problem" also by gcc-68k compiled programs, BTW.

My own solution to this is to use as default-shell the shell "KingCon" which 
sets the default-stack to 30000 for programs started from the Shell which is 
enough for most programs. If it is not enough a nice solution is providing a 
GUI (AmiHeretic for example supports a stack-raising GUI).

ow> I think this question not only concern ROJ's problem.

The Stack is not global to your system. It is specific to the task (the Shell) 
from which you start the program. It is an area inside a Task where things 
like local variables for recursions are stored. Each task has it's own stack.

For the CLI Shell the default stack is 4096. Which is really too low for
most bigger programs.

*some* programs have to have a really big stack - usually quickly ported (or
badly ported) apps. And yes, if you open a new CLI you have to reset the
stack - as the shell has its own default stack value.

well, i did cover this scenerio - quickly *or* badly ported apps. If a lot
of effort of spent on the port, then these problems can go. but its is worth
it for the amount of discontent users that will still plague the mailbox

Nice method is setting STACK 250000 [or more] inside shell-startup

It helps you to avoid typing 'stack blahblah' each time you start a shell :P

What should I do about it if a program in the original PC Code for example 
uses TONS of local data which ends all up on the stack ? Okay, i can rewrite 
it, but this *can* for some projects - especially if the original code is not

If a program needs large stack this is all already in the original source 
code, usually... for ports...

That is the Microsoft(C)(R)-way-of-solving-problems(TM). I usually have a lot
of shells open(around 10), so that is not a good solution. Especially since
maybe only one of those 10 may need more than the 16kb, which is the default
here.

The correct solution is to do proper coding. I don't mind needing 4kb extra
stack, but a stack of 500kb is simply WAY to much. If a such high stack is
REALLY, REALLY needed, it should be set by the program, not by the user!

That is true, it isn't possible any better solution? Eg. at the 
startup each program raises its stack, if it is too low. I saw 
programs that could do that, of course there can be some problems 
with PPC programs, AFAIK PPC stack determined somehow from the 68k 
stack, isn't it?

BTW I don't know anything about the stack raising. (Maybe allocated 
the programs itself or... I don' know.)

But what do you expect me to do, if the PC version of a program uses tons of 
*big* local variables ? Recoding a *lot* because some people still use 4 KB 
stack (which is too little...). Most programs run fine with a default stack of 
30 KB (which i myselves use as default stack). If a program needs more the 
clean solution is to raise the main task after the program launched, either by 
a GUI or by a seperate task simply. But if a program runs with 30 KB stack i 
won't care...

It's a design question. So if anyone writes a new program and does
a proper design, then no such problems will ever occur. In case that
someone has to work with an existing software he is more or less stuck
to work with the design of that software, which might heavily rely on
local variables/arrays. Of course you can easily say that an existing
software can be changed, but it's a lot of work and it's something quite
dangerous to do, because lots of new errors might be introduced, especially
when we are talking about ports of big and complex software, where the
porters have in no way the same knowledge about the inner workings
of the software compared to the original developers.

Of course there is quite an easy way to solve the stack problem even
for ports: change the stack using exec/StackSwap. For PPC programs
this can also be done by providing a small 68k startup code that
changes the stack and then jumps into the PPC main function. The
PPC stack size is derived from the 68K stack size. WarpOS right now
doubles the size and defines a minimal value, too.

Geez... grow up and get a life.  If you find making a script too
hard, here's something to help your overworked brain.

AddBuffers GAMES: 1000
Stack 400000
QuakeWS
AddBuffers GAMES: -1000

The first line adds 1000 buffers to the GAMES: drive
so that you get decent caching; lower this is you use
PFS: or FFS: with big blocks.

The second sets the stacks.

The third runs the program.  Be sure to put the name of
the program YOU want to run in place of QuakeWOS. :^}

The last line resets the buffers on the drive.

Put this little text file in the same drawer as the game,
give it a project icon and set the default tools to C:IconX.

You may now just double-click the icon from WB to play the
game.  If you find this too hard, don't ever buy a PC.

Amiga Programmers should take care of this. But in case of ports from PC
I think the programmer does not need to recode all this - especially when
further versions of the PC base source are expected and he remains to
stay close to the original to be able to update his source to the new versions 
also
. My opinion of course. Stack needs can in such 
cases be handled by an external GUI. 

I have said what i wanted, i won't comment further on that stack discussion.

With the help of Peter Annuss I have found a workaround for the stdio
relative path problem I mentioned here a little while ago.  It is simply to
remove the unix->amiga path conversion routine which doesn't appear to work
properly by adding

char *__amigapath(const char *path)
{
    return ((char *)path);
}
 
to one of the source files.  If you need the support for unix paths then
stick your own conversion code in there.

Didn't i explain myself correctly ? Besides that little 4kb thing. I don't
mind programs requiring XYZ stack space. But if they do require something
above the normal, it should be raised by the program, if it is too low, not
by the user!

Please, the system doesn't get any hotter or anything when it exceeds 100%,
however what could affect heat, is if your program is using the FPU. If it is
not, the FPU is powered down. Another thing is that a high load on the
Permedia2 makes it hotter. Anyways, my system is (usually) properly cooled,
and completely open atm, since i have just broken my pcmcia adaptor, and a

Subject: @{b}[warpup] Prob with my AMY@{ub}

Hi all,
	 sorry for my question but I want to take part in this discussion
'cause I had (have) a lot of problems about heat and power supply. 
This is my config.:	-A1200 in a Power Tower;
				-BlizzardPPC 603e+ @240Mhz with 040/25
				-BlizzardVision:
				-64Mb RAM (2x32Mb 60ns SIMM);
				-CD Plextor 40x SCSI;
				-HD Seagate 9 Gb SCSI;
				-250 Watt PSU;

ATM I have only one fan (on the PPC) and 2 heat sink (Permedia2 & 040)
without fan.
Before install the OS3.5 I solved all my heat/supply related problems using
the configuration mentioned above (but with a 230W PSU and a 16x IDE CD-ROM
and 4,3Gb IDE HD). Only in that way I was able to use my AMIGA without any
kind of problems, freeze,ecc... In fact if I was trying to put two fans on
the P2 and on the 040 sometimes I got freeze and blocks on my AMIGA. These
probs occurred randomly whether after 5 minutes or after 1 hour, until I
removed the to fans on P2 & 040.
So the problems were caused by the two fans. I know it's seem incredible but
the only way to use my AMIGA was this. 
I continued to use my stable AMIGA before updating to OS3.5. The probs
restarted. I tried a lot of solutions. 
	1) Two PSU: one to supply only the fans ( P2, PPC & 040) and the
other one for devices, ecc...
	2) No strange patches;
	3) Mem settings;

How many do they have to sell to make it profitable?
I don't really know _anyone_ that want to buy yet another addon CPU card
for their Amiga. Not to be negative, but most of my friends which still
use their Amiga have either started to use a PC besides as HW for them are
a whole lot cheaper or they have (like me) already bought a PPC card and
are not interested in buying a new CPU card. 

Personally I must say I'd like to hear what kind of research they have
done and what the results where coz I would think they had to do
_somekind_ of checking the market before they announced their upcoming
hardware. 

I'd probarly buy a new PPC based Amiga if it had new technology and not
3/4 legacy system like now, but like some people have already pointed out,
PC hardware is really cheap (atleast compared to Amiga hardware). I got a
dual Intel Celeron 500MHz w/Mainboard, LS120 drive and a huge ATX cabinet
for a lot less than I paid for my CSPPC w/040-40 and 604e-233... Afterall
price does matter. 

I'd really like to see a _NEW_ machine released, not just 'hacks' to add
to a old one. The first thing should probarly be to have the OS run PPC
native and to use standardized hardware. Afterall it takes a lot less time
to write just a driver than to make the hardware write the driver and then
push it to the market before its yesterdays technology.

The hardware design of the Amiga was an important enabling factor when it
was first released, but after that standardization of PC hardware and a
big market for PC-hw made them cheap because you kept costs down by
producing in great numbers, thus the enabling factor became a constraining
factor.

If anyone has a dual PPC running AOS native, let me know ;)

Can I suggest that coders provide a script and icon like this for all progs
that need it? As you say it`s not too much work.
Another suggestion is that stack size should be mentioned _*prominently*_ in

I'm getting one. I currently have a copy of Wipeout 2097 here that I bought
right when released, and do not have either the PPC or 3d hardware required
to run it. amiJoe will satisfy at least one of those requirements, then I
just have to wait for either the Paraglide to actually happen or someone to
make a 2d/3d card for the amiJoe's PCI connection.
I also plan to get Heretic II, Shogo, SiN, Freespace, Nightlong, etc. as I'm
very happy that some software is coming our way, and can't wait to have some
new games to play again. My 060 and no 3d card either won't run this stuff at
all, or won't do real well, and I'm hoping that a decent PPC card will make
some difference in that. And I'd like to support a company that has the guts
to even attempt supporting our platform with some spiffy gizmos.

I know a LOT of people, who just waiting for a G3/G4 board without 
M68k. They did not bought PPC card because of this.

Well, that's great! Because nothing would be better than selling those
cards by the thousands. I based my email on my experience with
users here in Oslo, Norway. I think I know most of the Amiga users here at
the university (atleast those who are still active), most of them have a
060 card, or even PPC w/060 and I know they don't want to pay for a new
computer-in-computer (coz that's more or less what the card is), but the
interesting fact is that most of them are willing to pay a whole lot more
for a new "Amiga" and that goes for several people I know that have put
their Amiga in the attic (and those far outnumber the active users).

I sincerely hope that H&P succeed in pushing everything over to a PPC only
system and that they make their software run on some open licensed
platform so we can have cheap and readily available hardware. 
I would easily let myself be persuaded to whip out 2-3000 GBP for a good
SMP dual PPC box w/Warpup and some really nice hardware, as a matter of
fact one of the companies I work for, which specializes on seismic
reservoar evaluation don't care about wether they can run Windows or not,
they want fast machines for numeric calculations. Right now we are in the
process of evaluating a 100+ number machines just for _one_ boat, whereas
they have tens of boats and they said they would want a PPC based platform
if possible as Intel is not very good on floats and are harder to program
in assembler. The OS must be efficient and stable. Other than that they
don't care because the rest of the software would be written in-house from
scratch. Historically this is a very Sun biased company, but is
considering switching to a PPC based platform if a good one will be
released as most probarly know Sun hardware is good, but it's rather
expensive and more often than not you would have to use Suns add-on
hardware...Sell a PPC based platform and ship it with WarpOS to a few
companies like that and you have a good baseline to evolve from as low-end
users would probarly buy the cheapest available PCs anyway.. 


I think it would be easier to sell a little expensive workstation as long
as you offer something different/better than standard PCs with the whole
world as your market instead of selling only to a very small group.

I would think Motorola would _very_ much like to take back the superiority
they enjoyed earlier. With the rise of LINUX maybe something interesting
will show up here ;)

What shouldn't be forget: a G3/G4 card does only make sense in conjunction
with graphics boards. I would even say they do only make sense in conjunction
with *fast* graphics boards (>Z3). Otherwise the difference in processing
power between today's processors and G3/G4 gets lost/wasted. I also ask
myself whether the classic AMIGA hardware architecture really can handle
this level of processing power anymore.

If those PPC-only boards came out 2-3 years ago it would have been a great
thing. Now I fear that they come too late.

Yes...a top speed 68k barely capable of driving PCI let alone AGP (thinking

hmm...if they come 2 or 3 years ago the emulation speed would have been
unacceptable..but maybe there would've been more development biased towards
PPC..but no need to drag out who screwed that up eh?

That's not completely right. A 68060 running a 66 MHz should be able to
satisfy a 33 MHz PCI. The problem may be that in the current Amiga,
everything has to go through a crappy buster.

The Boxer may be something completly different. There are special north
bridge chips that can connect directly to a 68060. That could bring a lot
of speed.

And don't forget that the Boxer may have a PPC that's directly connected
to the bus.

On the contrary, a 68040 or 68060 is more than capable of
saturating the bandwidth of a thirty-two bit PCI bus.  A
sixty-four bit bus would take more hardware, but a 66 MHz
060 could still saturate it as well.  4x AGP would be a
different story, but an 040/060 and PCI are a real good
match.

The BoXeR is supposed to be a modern motherboard design using modern parts
and methods and supposedly is much faster than Amiga motherboards designed
by Commodore. ;-)

So the only two or better three questions will be:
- for which end-price?
- does the current software and software in development work without
problems (warpos, games, raytracers and all that stuff)
- will it ever be released?

$1895 (US) which includes:
- 50mhz 68060 (PPC addon card available 2-3 months after initial Boxer
  systems ship)
- 10GB HD
- 32Mb RAM
- 40X CD-ROM

- 100% Amiga compatible

I dunno, but I assume so. It would be incredibly stupid if it weren't
compatible. It is supposed to be a 100% Amiga comapatible motherboard, and
it has a lot of enhancements to the motherboard design.

> - will it ever be released?

Yup. Atni-Gravity got tired of waiting and waiting so they bought the BoXeR
from Access Innovations and hired Mick Tinker to finish it. I think the
motherboard is basically finished now. The software (maybe firmware?)for the
system needs finished now. I dunno if the website has all the specs for the
motherboard or not. If not, I can type it up later.

That may or may not work; you can tell them HOW to make the script,
but some things are going to HAVE to be done by the user.  E.G., in
ADoomPPC, I tell the user how to make the script, but if I provided
one, they'd still have to edit it to set the drive paths and options.
If I provided one, the user PROBABLY wouldn't bother reading the docs
and complain when the default script failed.  Better to make them read
the docs and then make their own.  Trust me, I speak from long 
experience here.

Is it so hard? Scripting on Amiga is _very_ fexible. You can write 
easily scripts for handling special options, paths etc.
I am personally not a script-mage (BTW I wrote games and some tool in 
AOS script), but I may help everybody if he/she write me a letter.

There is an unofficial boxer site:

You can also have a look at the blittersoft page

Hi !

Some days (Or weeks ?) ago I asked for a solution for timing on the ppc. I
thing that I will use the WarpUP-functionality, everything I´m not sure
about is the relation between the timer and the real world. As far as I
know the PPCTimer is increased with half the bus speed (means that an
increase of 33000000 on a 66mhz-ram-board means that 1 second is gone), is
that right, is it another value or totally different ?

By saying 'use the WarpUp-functionality' you basically say to use
the WarpOS system functions. And these return the time in 'real time'.

GetSysTimePPC has not much overhead and is well-suitable for most
purposes. Only for stuff like intensive profiling it might be better
to directly read the registers. But then you have to do the conversion
yourself.

 1/4 the busclock.  I suggest you go to Motorola or IBM's web site
and get the manuals.  This is clearly described in the manual.

hard- and software or software only?

The Price seems a bit high, when you think about the memory being to low
and what you get in PC-market. But it might be acceptable when one of my
old miggys breaks down completly.

Thanks for your quick answer anyway! :-)

I was thinking about the discussion a little while ago about the scheduler
and how it always gives some time to all tasks.  If making some tasks get
no time when something else wants some is not going to be implemented, how
about being able to set the default nice value?

If I set the default to -20 and set rc5des_ppc to 20, it would achieve a
similar effect.  While not being quite as good, this would satisfy me.

That is correct, the Phase5/DCE-PPC cards will not work as there is no
A3000/A4000 accellerator slot.  There is planned a Zorro expansion daughter
card but don't know when or if it will make it to production.  As for
Graphics cards, with the appropriate drivers the BoXeR will be able to use
any PCI (and perhaps with the latest spec BoXeR, AGP) graphics cards.  I
wouldn't mind moving my Diamond Viper 770 32mb card to an Amiga box.

Supply & Demand as always determine pricing in conjunction with return on
investment and higher parts pricing for low volume production.

I'm not sure about other accelerators. As for video it is full AGA emulation
but is fully 24bit so you really don't need a graphics card. For Zorro card
there is a header(?) to plugin in a Zorro backplane to put Zorro cards into,
but I think that is inline with the video slot (I think a Toaster can go
there).

You get a lot of bang for your buck though. full 24bit video and 16bit sound
(i think the sound is 16bit).

> Thanks for your quick answer anyway! :-)

Also the RAM goes into 2 x 64-bit DIMM sockets. I think most of the ports
are DMA also for faster access. There is also a CD-ROM audio input connector
and mixer. Chip RAM is not limited to 2MB either. The onboard IDE interface
supports UDMA. There are 4 PCI slots, and there is a 2MB 32-bit flash ROM to
boot the OS and resident modules from. Also a dual USB interface is on the
motherboard.

I got all this from the spec sheet at the show.

The price is still high compared to "supermarket-pcs". And it is too
high, if only software is compatible and my ppc-cards from phase5 and
graphicscard and all this stuff is not compatible and cant be plugged
in.
Thats the important point of being 100% Amiga compatibel for me...

Well ok. This then sound like the new amiga we all have been waiting
for, as soon as the main processor can be changed to G3 or G4. And the
price with your hardwarespecs seems ok for me now, too.
But they should provide some drivers for common (cheap?) PCI-
graphicscards. (perhaps like on PC standard VGA-drivers).

I think you can make all the normal go in the same direction more or less
easily if you object is a closed mesh. Just pick up a triangle, and
look at the neighbours triangles. You can make all the neighbours
triangles have their vertex in the same order as the triangle you
picked:

						a______d
						|\     |
						| \  2 |
						|  \   |
						|   \  |
						| 1  \ |
						|_____\|
						c      b

For example, if you picked the triangle 1, you have vertex a,b and c
clockwise. So you know that for triangle 2, you can have his vertex
clockwise ordered if you put them in the following order: b,a,d.

That is, you take the two points shared between the two triangles (a
and b), you swap them (b,a) and you add the third point (d), giving
you the (b,a,d) order. Do this for all the neighbours, and then for
the neighbours of the neighbours, until all the triangles are done.

The only problem is that this work if the first triangle that you pick
is oriented in the good way, otherwise they will all end up oriented in
the bad way. If it's the case, you can just flip all the triangles to
have them in the good way.

Ps. I never tested all of this, so maybe it doesn't work at all :))

I dunno, but it would be a good idea. Maybe somthing Holger Kruse does with
MNI drivers for ethernet cards would be a good idea. As long as card uses
the same chipset the driver shouldn't have to be that different for
different cards.
I don't know how drivers work, but they shouldn't that hard should they? I
think one of the hardest drivers for the BoXeR will be the USB ports.

As far as video drivers go, the CGX driver for the CV3D
would work with a Virge PCI card with very minor changes,
and the CVPPC driver would work with Permedia 2 PCI cards
with very minor changes.

Whether the sync's are the same depends on the units Windows is
showing compared to what CGX is showing.

For the Mankind site: http://tex.mankind.free.fr/ (demos can be found at
"products"). And yes, the Deathtrial demo (Warp-OS, finished first at the
UKONX) is really worth seing and for your information, TEX is also the
author of "Doggy", great LW-object viewer under warp3D/storm-mesa (can also
be found on the MKD site). You should also notice a new warp3D-demo
realised by CdBS at the UKONX: "Enclume". Both groups will members present
at the Amigamania, Amiga-users meeting that will stand in TOULOUSE from 6
to 8 of May.

Bye,

I fear not much currently... I also did not get any mails... but to add some 
new stuff which some people might not yet have noticed:

- Hyperion released the first progress report for SiN, with first Screenshots
  of both Hardware and Software Renderer of SiN on the Amiga !!!
- The group ManKinD released two really great PPC Demos using WarpUP,
  MKD_DeathTrial and MKD_ViolentDumb, one of them is on the homepage
  of ManKinD (sorry, don't have the URL currently handy), the other
  on ftp.scene.org in the folder for Mekka-Symposium 2000). I also
  heard rumours there will be WarpUP Demos from other groups quite
  soon ("with maybe also Warp3D Support")
- MiniGL has been released (actually already around 2 weeks ago), to
  provide a easy-to-use API to port OpenGL Stuff to the Amiga (with
  still optimal speed). Programmers can download it at the WWW of
  Hyperion Software. Currently supported are StormC PPC - both 3.0 and
  4.0 Beta -, gcc-WarpUP, StormC 68k and gcc-68k. (Anybody interested in
  helping with the vbcc-version ?)
- The new version of WarpSNES is nearly finished, I am currently working on it.
  Basically I am just waiting on a new c2p which a friend of mine is coding, 
  which will speedup the emulator a lot for AGA users. The new version is
  around 30% faster than the old, new stuff are: Move to SNES9x base sources
  V1.29, support for PSX Port using LowLevel Emulation, and added support
  for HAM8 mode for AGA users
