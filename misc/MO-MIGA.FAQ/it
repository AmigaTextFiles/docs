4. What is a MO-MIGA?


A. Introduction

(i) Where does this information come from?

The information in this section has been extracted from the manual so 
that it can be shown to people in your organisation who need 
an over-view of the MO-MIGA system. 

(ii) Who Can it be copied to?

You are welcome to copy this section and distribute it freely 
to your colleagues and contacts. Your attention is however 
drawn to the fact that the copyright to contents of this 
manual are the property of Fourth Level Developments and any 
unauthorised distribution in whole or in part is an 
infringement of copyright.

(iii)  What are Magneto Optical Drives (MO's)?

MO drives are like compact discs but re-writable.
The discs come in a 5.25 in plastic cartidge but have the appearance
of a large 3.5 in disk. The data is very secure and can be read 15 years
after writing without any need for maintenance.

Magneto Optical drives use a combinating of Magnetic and Optical effects.
The disk is simular to other laser disks but the active area is made 
from a magnetic medium. In its raw state the medium is uniformly
magnetised with the magnetic domain perpendicular to the plane of the disk.

When you write to the disk its magnetisation can not be easily altered at
room temperature, however when the temperature reaches a certain point 
the polarity can be flipped by an external magnetic field. So when a bit
is to be recorded a high powered laser a beam is used to heat the material
above the critical temperature there by allowing the reversal to take place.

On reading the disk the drive has to decide which bits have been flipped 
and a low powered laser beam is used, the polarisation of the reflected
beam is altered depending on the polarity of the bit. The polaristion is
detected by the drive. This means that the drive can have a very high read
speed because we are using light rather than magnetic interpretation of 
data. 

(iv) What are the advantages of Magneto Optical Drives?
Magneto Optical Drives have the following major system advantages:

(a) Portability
Cartridges are compact, easily removable and transportable
(b) Data Integrity
Unlike conventional magnetic media they are not easily erasable by accident
and they provide archive quality storage facilities. They are not
easily damaged and the data can be made more secure than conventional
hard drives because they can be securely locked away.
(c) Speed. MO-MIGAs read much faster than standard
IDE drives (see test results) and their write speeds are at least equal to
if not faster)
(d) Economy per MByte- The cost per Megabyte is much lower because
you pay approx £100 per 1.2G cartridge(one off) and £85 per 1.2G cartridge
in quantities of 5 or more.


B. The MO_MIGA:

(i) Can you give me an over-view?

MO-MIGA 1.2GB Version 2.41 is the latest Magneto Optical Drive system for
the Commodore Amiga from Fourth Level Developments. It is the ultimate
drive for the professional user and comprises a specially adapted 5.25
inch  rewriteable Magneto Optical drive built by Sony supplied with full
Amiga support software and cabling for  installation in all Commodore Amiga
range  of computers equipped with a SCSI interface.

There are two drive types :

      (a)  MO-MIGA 1.2 Internal
      (b)  MO-MIGA 1.2 External

The double sided cartridges, (double the capacity of release 
2.1.), provide  616MBytes of user data storage per side and 
can be changed over or new disks  inserted at will.

(ii) How much data can I store on the MO-MIGA system?

Because you can have a many cartridges as you wish the 
MO-MIGA  provides  virtually infinite data storage.

(iii) How fast are MO-MIGA drives?
  
The data  transfer rates  have now been dramatically 
increased to 2.0 MBytes per  second sustained and up to 5.0 Mbytes per 
second sychronous burst. 
(That is provided  your system and its applications are fast enough
 to keep up with it!).

(iv) Are there any test results available?

Yes see Appendix 1
Also see review in Amiga Computing of pre-production prototype
which did not have the latest  high speed buffered data
transfer facility.

(in June issue). 

C. What support software is available?

   MO-MIGA Software includes:

(i) MO-MIGA Install- User friendly Commodore installer program which
copies the software onto your hard drive and sets up your configuration.

(ii) MO-MIGA Toolbox- Once the system is installed the user is 
provided with a tool box to format  and partition cartridges  
Each cartridge, and cartridge side, can have  different 
partitions which can be changed to suit the users' needs 
without  resetting the Amiga or stopping other tasks from 
running.

(iii) MO-MIGA Exchange provides new  facilities for data exchange.  
Large scale  automatic data exchanges by cartridge between 
sites and users have been  catered for in this new release.   

MO-MIGA Exchange provides a common system  which enables  
remote sites to  automatically identify and implement  the  
user setup requirements for each  cartridge coupled with 
optional  automatic dismounting  upon cartridge  ejection.

MO-MIGA Exchange also provides a standard  method  for  
automatic identification of the  cartridge originator by  
company name, site name,   machine name and operator name.

(iv)MO-MIGA Audit provides recording of audit events such as 
logons and cartridge changes. The system supervisor can set up 
different audit clasess and place certain users into these 
clasess, by doing this s/he can record the activities of users 
in a flexible manner.    

     The MO-MIGA system enables users to increase the  security   
     of their  data with the following options:

     (a) a movement audit trail,  
     (b) a system of optional and multi level  password controls 
      to control access  and writing of data. 
     (c) a data access audit trail
     (d) An error audit trail which includes a record of attempts to make  
      unauthorised reads or writes or to issue unauthorised 
      commands. 
     (e)  A  user transparent data  encryption facility is available
      to registered users as  an optional extra.

     Details of the security facilities and its management 
     instructions and  programmes are contained within a separate 
     sealed package to be  opened by  the system administrator.

(v)MO-MIGA device  - Takes Amiga O/S- commands and manages the 
drive via SCSI direct commands to the MO-MIGA 1.2GB.

Uses virtual data handling so all software can read/write any 
number of bytes from any bytewise disk offset. This means that 
the bytes per sector needs for multi operating system 
requirements can be met via the same device driver.
Therefore partitions for the Amiga  O/S operating at 512 Bytes 
per sector and (for example) a unix/xenix/BSD system partition at 
1024 bytes per sector can access the same cartridge. Uses 
continuous sweep write cache and random access read cache of 
user requested size from 17k upwards. Supports all standard 
Amiga trackdisk.device commands.


(vi) MO-MIGA Auto-error correction and defective block handling 
algorythms: For maximum compatibility with other systems data 
is written and error  corrected by default in accordance with 
the lastest ISO ECMA standard defect management scheme for 
130mm ReWriteable Optical Disks. The system is also compatible 
with the earlier ISO Standard  and Sony's defect management   
system,  or can operate in raw mode.

(vii)MO-MIGA Tools Provides user controlled partitioning of the 
media and automatically creates and modifies mountlists and 
batch files. This feature overcomes the limitation for the 
Amiga to handle removable media that is differentially  
partitioned.
MO-MIGA tools also supports Multi-file systems. Each 
individual media can carry its own set-up utility which 
includes assigns and all other standard user start-up 
sequences.

(viii)MO-MIGA Blanker - Automatically stops the MO-MIGA's motor from 
spinning if the drive has not been used for a user-defined 
time period with auto restart when data transfer is requested. 
This prevents unnecessary wear on drive and  disks.

(ix) MO-MIGA start/stop/eject - These cli commands allow the user 
control over the  drives motor and disk ejection.

D. Is the MO-MIGA compatible with SCSI  & SCSI2?

Will operate under either SCSI or SCSI2.
The system is backward compatible and will read and write current
version lower capacity cartridges.


E. Does the MO-MIGA permit multi-tasking?

The MO-MIGA system multitasks and allows O/S-Legal programs to 
access the  cartridges like a normal hard drive. MO-MIGA is 
compatible with WB2/3, this allows the user to pass cartridges 
to other Amiga computers without encountering compatibility 
problems.


The MO-MIGA system is delivered complete with all system 
software, operating  manuals, cables and straightforward 
installation guide. A voucher for 2 months immediate and free 
on-line support direct from Fourth Level Development's own  
system engineers and support team is included in the package. 
This includes access to new software releases and updates as 
they become available. Support can be  extended by an annual 
subscription which includes access to new system software 
releases. As an optional extra a SCSI2 card is available.


F. Who needs MO-MIGAs?

MO-MIGA is an essential tool for any user needing mass 
data storage with fast convenient access. Graphics/video/film 
houses, bulletin board  operators, company information 
providers www and ftp sites and CD ROM publishers are only a
few examples of many ideal MO-MIGA environments.

G. Can I run my MO-MIGA under NetBSD?

Yes, provided your SCSI controller is supported you can use the
MO-MIGA as either your root drive or as additional storage. If you
need information on how to set it up under NetBSD then contact
Fourth Level Developments who will even supply a cartridge to plug
in and go. 

If you want to use the faster 1024 bytes per sector media with NetBSD
then you will need kickstart and workbench V3.1. It is recommended
that you stick to 1024 byte per sector media due to the significant
increase in data storage capacity and speed.

H. Can I use it on my PC compatible?

Fourth Level can supply you with software to run your MO-MIGA drives
on your PC compatible. Fairly shortly you will be able not only to
read PC filing systems but also disks that have data stored on them
in Amiga FFS and BFFS. The security features which are presenly 
available on the Amiga will also be available for the PC.

I. Can I read files that have created under MSDOS on my Amiga?

Yes you can. The ideal method is to establish the partitions which will
be used as MSDOS partitions on the Amiga. Then mount the partitions on
your PC and any data so stored will be readable under cross dos on the 
Amiga.

J. Can I read files from NetBSD under AmigaOS.

Yes, at the moment you will have to create your own mountlist from
BFFS1.3, however a new release (V2.6) will cure this problem.


K. Is an auto-change system available?

Delivery of our auto-changer system will begin in September 1994.
It holds 20 Cartridges and provides 24 GB on line? 

The price of the auto-changer will be announced during the week begining
the 8th of August 1994.

L. What is the price of a MO-MIGA

End user prices are £1800 sterling + local VAT (if applicable)
+ carriage fully inclusive of all software.

Up until now supplies of MO-MIGA's have been limited but full production
has begun and ample supplies will be available to meet demand.
Outstanding orders will be met in full by the end of August.

End user support is via email and BBS direct from Fourth Level.
Direct Ftp to Fourth Level is planned to be available from the middle
of October 1994.

APPENDIX:


Disk speed results:

These tests were done through the Amiga's FFS and so the data
transfer rate is inclusive of SCSI,Device Software,File System 
and Operating System overheads.

If speeds for specific applications are critical then we have available
a number of special modes for fine tuning your application.

One partitical example not mentioned below is pre-erased writing which
increases the write speed by about 1/3 (Depending upon file size). This
mode is particularly useful for batch digitising where using the MO-MIGA
you should achieve significantly greater output than on IDE drives. 

These tests were done using 340K of software cache and 1MB of harware
cache (Built into the MO-MIGA as standard).

One word of caution, the way the test software package works has the 
effect of flattering the MO-MIGA seeks speeds. That is because some of
the data being requested was already present in cache.

In princial the seek time of MO drives is somewhat slower than hard
drives because the MO has only one read/write head. However the MO makes
up for this defiency by its much faster read time.

The read speed on the first of the two tests is slighty faster because
the write cache is enabled on the second test and it will finish emptying
itself when the read starts thus reducing the figures slighly.
