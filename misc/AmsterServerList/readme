Requirements: Amiga 68k Amster V 0.8

Summary-------

This is a manually converted text server list for Amster, Do not get to excited....Slavanap servers will allow you log on,then you will log off straight away, this is something to do with connection protocols and as i am not a coder i can't fix this problem..... But on the good side there are at least four opennap ng servers that you will be able to log onto.

Installation-------

Just drag and drop into your Amster drawer.

Notes--------

If anyone has access to the source code for Amster perhaps someone may know how to adjust the protocol problem.

Lastly-------

Have fun with the servers that work....
