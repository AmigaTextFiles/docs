                                                  a textfile - great! For you it was a simple
                                                  tool but for us it was very useful!

FAQ (Frequently asked Questions)

What kind of creation/building/element/organisation is the SCENE?


The Scene, What is it?

For  many  people,  computers  are  fascinating  machines.  Using their creative
spirit  and intelligence, they try to use them to create something new.  That is
nothing  special.   It  is  not  only  the  case  with  computers but with every
technology.   Each  new discovery in science or every new machine finds devotees
as  soon  as  it  gains  enough popularity.  The term scene does not necessarily
relate  to the demo scene.  It does not even refer the computer scene in general
- there are many scenes.

A scene means all the people who are involved in a certain area - be it actively
or  passively.   Scientists  and people who are especially interested in science
can  form  a  scene  -  even  snowboarders or computer freaks can have their own
scene.   All  scenes  are  in some respect underground.  This does not mean that
they  are  fully  isolated from the outer world.  Nor are they stricly organized
communities;  one  cannot  tell who exactly belongs to a scene and who does not.
However,  the  world outside does not necessarily have much insight into a scene
apart  from  what  it  releases  to  the  public.  Therefore a scene composed of
scientists  is  just as underground as the demo scene.  From this point of view,
the  demo  scene  is  not  unique  at  all.  It is one of many different scenish
communities all over the world.



Demo-Scene:
Maybe  you  remember the colorful C64 INTROS which crackers have put in front of
the  games  to  tell  you  who  brought  it  to  you?   That  were  the earliest
INTRO-ductions  or better say the first demoscene related productions.  The hard
thing  for the CODERS (programmers) today at introcompetitions at parties is the
fact,  that  the  bytelimit  of their INTRO is strictly limited.  They have only
40kb  or  64kb to use, so the intro of the coder with the best packer-routine or
precalculating routine will win.

To speak generally about the demoscene, it can be compared with the music-scene.
There  are  groups  of  artists  who are all doing different things, like making
computer  graphics,  either  a  logo,  fonts, entire screens or even animations.
Then  there  are artists who make computer music.  At the demoscene we also have
DISKMAGS  driven  by  EDITORS  that  can be compared to newspapers in real life.
Magazines-on-(hard)disk  try  to  inform  the  sceners what`s going on, but they
should  normally  also reach their goal in entertaining the readers.  Also, some
groups   present   SLIDESHOWS   or   MUSICDISKS  showing  the  skills  of  their
graphcians/musicians in a coded form to the public.  But most productions coming
out  are  still  DEMOS (demonstrations) which can be compared in some aspects to
modern videoclips shown on music-channels like Mtv or Viva.

And  every  year  the  demosceners  come together in one of the big parties like
Assembly,  The  Gathering,  Mekka&Symposium or The Party to compete against each
others or just in order to have fun or to booze around a bit.





Cracking Scene:
Members  of  the  cracking  scene try to get games or tools as fast as possible,
remove  the  copy-protection and release it.  Now everybody can use that program
for  free  without buying it.  Of course this is illegal and many people dislike
their  work because it doesn`t make the gamecompany`s life easier.  A lot people
from  inside  and  outside  the scene said that the Amiga market was also mainly
destroyed  by  the  crackers.   Can`t say if that`s true or not, but it`s a fact
that many people gave up producing Amiga programs because they didn`t get enough
income for all their work.  On the PC market the number of games/tools/utilities
coming out is so high that all groups together cannot release everything that is
sold.   With  about  300-400  Megabytes  of stuff beeing spread daily at good PC
boards, nobody is able to have a look at every single file that came out.

Also  the number of "normal" users that are willing to buy the software they use
is  a  lot higher so there are still good chances to earn some dollars with your
PC-software.


Ascii/Ansi Scene:
That  are creative people that design logos out of the aviable ascii-chars.  (of
the  keyboard)  It`s  really  ram-hard  to  make  a  goodlooking  logo...   Most
Ascii/Ansi Sceners try to introduce their own style.  You won`t get any applause
for a plain copy of someone elses style.








FAQ:
What makes a person to call himself a Scener?

A Scener is a person that playes his little own role in the scene.  He or she is
in  contact with other sceners, he supports scenish productions, visits computer
parties etc.  But many people only spend their time watching the demos that came
out  or  hang  out in the different IRC channels.  That won`t be a way that will
save  the  scene  but  it`s  also  a way to be a scener.  The scene doesn`t have
rules,  it  doesn`t have any laws or courts telling you if you are worth to call
yourself  a scener or not.  It`s a totally anarchy.  And that`s what many people
enjoy, they can do what they want without beeing punished for anything.  hehe

However  for nearly everybody in the scene it`s important to have an own HANDLE,
crackers  from  the past introduced them because it was too dangerous to use the
real name...  nowadays it would be totally strange to everybody if a person that
calls  himself  a  scener  wouldn`t  use a handle.  That`s why we sorted out the
entries in every category after the handle of the scener.






FAQ:
What is SCENET?

SCENET was created roughly four years ago by the hungarian Amiga demoscener Lord
of  Absolute,  Impulse  & Crimson Jihad.  Lord was concentrating on email addies
and  first  merged two old lists from Igo of TBL which was published at the "RAW
Online"  homepage and another from Cesium, who was a norwegian Amiga Scener from
the  group Session.  SCENET aims to be a kind of gateway for all kind of Sceners
or  those  people  who  are interested into the Scene.  It wants to give you the
possibility  to  find good old contacts/friends you`ve possibly lost during your
time  of  inactivity.  It can be also a gateway to enter the Scene for newcomers
or just a way to inform yourself about it.  If you`re searching for scenerelated
email addies, personal or group related homepages, telnet ip`s from boards, good
newsgroups,  active irc channels etc.  etc.  etc., then SCENET will fulfill your
needs!!!

Lord  has  done  about  20  issues  of  the database under the label "SCNET" and
released  them  as  lha-archive in the Amiga boards and in the Aminet..  In 1998
nearly to the end of his career he became quite lazy and after no update saw the
lights  for  many  months  we  decided to take over his work and renamed it into
SCENET.   In December 1998 tbe musician Evrimsson of Nuance created the homepage
and thank to this great pixeler, we were able to use some really nice but simple
graphics  from  Leunam  of  Network.  In April 1999 the editor  Dire of  Darkage
took over the webmaster`s job and is since this time responsible for all kind of
links.   Checking & working on all kind of parts of SCENET was too much work for
one  person.   He`s  also  updating the link section once every week.  The email
datas are only updated after a new issue of SCENET came out.  In Spring & Summer
`99  we`ve  send  a verification email to every person who`s listed in the email
list.   Many  many  people  were so nice to write us back and send us a lot more
support!   By  the  way:   All email adresses are verified every second month to
make sure our datas keep on a fresh standard.

Also since Spring `99 we`re working together with the german commercial papermag
AmigaOS.   On  their  site  you`ll  find  the  latest  serious  Amiga  links  of
gamedevelopers,  utility  coders,  Amiga  fanclubs  and  all you can imagine of.
Visit http://AmigaOS.de and you`ll see what we mean.

To  get  the  latest  update  leech  it here on our site in the DOWNLOAD area or
search in the MISC area at the scene.org or dc-1 ftp servers.


Since   Summer   `99   we   have   our   own   domain  and  own  email  accounts
(http://scenet.de)  To  be independant from any homepages, productions or groups
became more and more important for us.  We got many offers from other webmasters
to  move  to their location but SCENET was ment as an independant production and
only  with  an  own  domain we can show this in our opinion needed independance.
We`re  still  working together closely with Evrimsson & Merlin-M, the authors of
the  scenerelated  book  "Hackerland".   We hope to organise a lot more "Cologne
Conferences" in the future but at that time we simply thought it would be better
to follow an own path instead of keeping SCENET on their site.

In  August  `99  we`ve started an own ICQ list which is actually honestly rather
small.  Just write us an email to add yourself to the list.  Thanks!






Future:
A  database  like this is never finished, it can`t contain enough adresses.  The
more  scenerelated  emails,  homepages,  ftp  servers, irc channels, the better.
Also,  daily  emails  & links break down and become invalid.  It`s impossible to
check  everything  daily,  not  to  forget  that  we  would  surely  disturb the
recipients  this  way.   If we didn`t do that already..  ;-)) Not to forget that
there`s  still  a  lot  old  material from Lord which is waiting to be veryfied.
Many  urls of his list are surely dead but as you know the day has only 24 hours
and  not  more.   Maybe  you won`t find every single url you`re searching for as
it`s  impossible to have them all but this institution should be a good starting
point  for  your  tracing.  Especially as all datas are sorted in a logical way.
You  won`t  be  killed  by masses of unsorted shots like in case of Altavista or
other search engines.

We`re  actually  also working on a bigger party & fair calendar.  If you want to
check our present one, just click on "Scheduler" in the menu.



What we need!
What  we  need  is your support.  Writing a small email informing us isn`t a big
deal,  but  without  YOUR  help our site will vanish the sooner or later or will
simply  become totally uninteresting.  Get active for us - 33.000 visitors in 14
months cannot be wrong!


We`re  also  searching  for more important scenerelated sites like TREBEL or the
GFX  ZONE  working together with us, exchanging informations and advertising for
us with our buttons.  (and we surely for them)
