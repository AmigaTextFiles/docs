Hi,

Attached is an arc file ( 10 KB ) that contains instructions and a
schematic for building an Amiga midi interface that I got from the Amiga
Arts forum on Compuserve.  I haven't looked at it so let me know if it
doesn't work.  And if attachments don't work on this mailing list, let me
know and I'll send it directly to you.

Take care.

>  Hi all, I would like to use the AD516 to play samples when triggered 
by a MIDI keyboard.

Hi, you can achieve theplayback of sound samples with the AD516 by using 
Bars&Pipes Professional MIDI sequencer. Bars&Pipes can work integrated 
withStudio16 SW: for this, there are some B&P tools which can be puton a 
MIDI track. With this tool you can define a sample for each specific 
note that will be played by that track. Each time that note is 
eoncountered on the track, the corresponding sample will be played by 
the AD516 card. In the same way (though I haven't tried this) I'm pretty 
much sure that also realtime (direct) MIDI events (like pressing a note 
on your keyboard) will produce the same MIDI events on the track and 
therefore start the corresponding sample.
So far I have been able to play samples (I have the AD1012 card) within 
Bars&Pipes without any problems. Bars&Pipes can be downloaded FREE from:

    www.in2nett.com/bws/blue

I have seen, from your Email, that you have as much as 128MB of RAM 
installed in your A3000. Well, I do have an A3000 myself and would be 
very much interested in knowing what type of memory expansion board you 
have. My Amiga has already been expanded to its full capacity of RAM on 
the motherboard but I'm starting to think that it's time to go even 
further. I don't know what expansion boards there are on the market. So, 
would appreciate if you could tell me what board you have.

There do exist pure memory boards (e.g. DKB3128), but most people with
that much RAM have accelerators.  Boards like the CyberStorm can take up
to 128Mb in SIMM form.

I have files to build your own, but when he can pickup a multi
port model used for about 30-40$US, Is it worth his trouble?
I built my own interfaces for C64/128 and amiga, but that was years
ago when the price was closer to $90 (in 1987 dollars). If he wants
to spend the time and effort for fun, then I'll try to dig up the files
for you.
But I would recommend getting a commercial model used if he can.
All three of my "home mades" were retired in this way.

This is only remotely related to the S16 list, but I thought I'd
try out the ideal here first. I'll explain the link at the end.

I had some converstions with an amiga user who is
working with another group. They are looking for an affordable
AHI soundcard, and are talking about doing their own.
I had these thoughts........
The other users wan tto develope a new card under $100
that would simply give 16 bit sound, AHI support and maybe
some basic recording. I think with the news of the new MMC
amiga, that a new developement project for zorro amiga's, and
all the time and money invlolved, might be hard to recover in
sales. I did have another ideal though. What about a Zorro card
adapter at very small price that would let you install one on the 
many (and nearly free) 16 sound blaster compatible cards. The
card developement is done, no cost. What you do need is a
16bit ISA to Zorro pin to pin interface. I've done simple interfaces
similar to this before. It would be the easy part. The main thing
would be a .lib that would give amiga access to the sound card/chip,
and I suppose with that part done, interfaceing to AHI would be like
any other amiga sound card.
I see this as a possible aid to S16 in mix down/re-recording.
Right now I mix S16 to a turtle beach card in a pc. How possible might it
be
to play S16 multitraks into a second sound card in an accelerated amiga
as
wav files ready to burn onn CD?
Multitrak recording and CD mix down on the same machine?

Any comments or technical help?

troy

Isn't this the same as the Golden Gate card? Or could you do it in a
single slot? 

Don't you need some hardware to swap the high and low bytes in all the
data?

If you made a single-slot one that was software compatible with Golden
Gate and BoXeR, you could use the same software. Actually, IIRC there
are some problems accessing PC soundcards in Amiga, but I can't
remember what. DMA or something.

Essentially that's what the GG2 does, although it's more than just a "pin
to pin interface".

That could be done in software if the overhead isn't an issue.  I don't
know whether the GG2 includes a byte-swapped instance of the space or not.
This is esaier for Z3 cards, since the address space is less constrained.

I don't know if the GG2 supports DMA at all; I doubt it.  Supporting all
variants of Amiga DMA (Z2, Z2 with inaccessible accelerator RAM, Z3 with
buggy Buster, Z3 with good Buster, third-party tower implementations,
etc.) isn't entirely trivial in its own right.

I really don't see devs wasting time with a big project like this when
they can be getting their ducks in a row for AMIGA 5.0, and getting to deal
directly with PCI slots, having only to come up with drivers for
whatever fantastic cards will be available then.

At that point people will be starting to ask for PCI slot adapters that
will take in their old Zorro cards...

Hello Kenny;

I had a chance to do some quick tests using the utilities you
sent me. I'm having a few problems, however.

1. 

-->press the Play button of SmpteCTRL and both SmpteOutput and
the 

I can't get this work, even after having followed your
instructions. I wonder though Kenny, if I have to press the
SMPTECtrl button, how is it different than pressing the
SMPTE_Out play button? 

If I press the SMPTE_Out play button, both the SMPTE_Out & the
cuelist start playing together, which, normally would be fine. 
On the other hand, Kenny, I find the cuelist real convient to
use (mostly because of the flags), so I would be looking for a
way to press play on the cuelist, and have the SMPTE_Out (or
SMPTECtrl) start to play (as opposed to the other way around).



2.

At first, I really liked your suggestion to set the AREXX
command in the directly in the cuelist. I was never able to get
SMPTECtrl to trigger however (even using your suggested
commands). I know AREXX works because I can trigger the
internal SMPTE Generator (for ex), using a similiar AREXX
string. Should I be using the same AREXX port (Studio16.1)?

Assuming I could eventually get this to work, I was going to
add the AREXX command at the beginning of the cuelist. I
started thinking about this however, and I started wondering
about a few things: a) If I start the cuelist, the internal
SMPTE generator will start counting. As soon as it hits the
AREXX command, it will trigger the SMPTE_Out play button. How
can I be sure that both the internal SMPTE, and external SMPTE
will both contain the exact same time count, considering that
both generators can run indepedantly? How much time is lost
between the time the AREXX command is sent, and the SMPTE_Out
generator starts running? Is there going to be an offset?

Another problem with setting the AREXX somewhere in the
cuelist, is, assuming I put the command at the start of the
cuelist, it always assumes I'm going to restart playing at the
start of the cuelist every time. What if I want to use my
flags, and start playing my cuelist halfway through? This woudl
mean I would either have to move my AREXX command every time,
or place multiple AREXX commands throughout my cuelist. Seems
like a bit of a hastle.


Any thoughts?

I have other questions (regarding QMASTER), but I'll wait until
I come back in town (in two weeks).


See ya.

SAG


BTW: Very impressed with your efforts.  :>)

I DL a copy of B&P pro some time ago but have not installed it yet, I will try
that.
I have a DKB3128 RAM board, You must be carefull though, the early ones didn't
work right with the A3000. I had to send mine back many times over the 3 year
warranty before they finally replaced it (after my complaint they confirmed
that all the boards at that time had the problem but only on the A3000) and I
have had no problem since.
To be exact, the Ram would work fine unless you shut off the computer and
turned it back on before the computer cooled down (about 20 minutes, I
discovered this after someone thru the wrong switch during a live performance
#$%) at that point the board would come up as bad and you would not get the
extra ram, this problem didn't come up on a reboot. You can also use EDO,
there is no extra benefit, other than that thay are easy to come by, be
carefull of placement if you mix though, it didn't work when I had Fast page
mixed with edo in the same bank, the first two on my board is edo and the last
two are fast page.

               Monty

Ok, first - are you sure you set the smpte source to be "SMPTE Output" ?
This is essential. If started from the Workbench you can edit the tooltypes
in the icon where it says "SetSource=SMPTE Output".

The main difference is that you expand the control access to Smpte Output
and in this case the Cuelist to be available outside Studio 16.

>way to press play on the cuelist, and have the SMPTE_Out (or
>SMPTECtrl) start to play (as opposed to the other way around).

I will dig into this. What I will do is to implement a redirection feature.
This will allow SmpteCTRL to pick up any transport comands sent and redirect
them to the source it's locked to. That means if you target the SMPTE Output
source you should be able to press the Cuelist buttons to control it (this
is how the Smpte Monitor works btw).

SmpteCTRL is a young program - it will grow with suggestions and
implementations so just let 'em come. I also got a suggestion of MIDI
triggering by SysEx messages which also will be implemented.

>2.

I tried this now and there seem to be some weird ways of handling the arexx
strings. Addressing the port "REXX" (in the track) should enable you to send
address command 'comand' strings to rexx, but it apperantly doesn't work.
Secondly, if Studio 16 creates a rexx message and sends it to the host a
string containing the comand it self should also work as RexxMast will act
like the 'rx' comand.

Anyone that have suggestions on the Studio 16's arexx track comands ?

>can I be sure that both the internal SMPTE, and external SMPTE
>will both contain the exact same time count, considering that
>both generators can run indepedantly?

The architeture of Studio 16 will make sure they get the same time as they
get the SMPTE TC from the same origin. The current TC is stored in the
library base and there only exist one. There are locking protocols to make
sure the SMPTE TC and status isn't changed when the program reads them with
supplied functions for this.

>How much time is lost between the time the AREXX command is sent, and
>the SMPTE_Out generator starts running? Is there going to be an offset?

The delay depends a bit on how fast cpu you have. The delay is tiny,
but you probably want to adjust the offset with a couple of frames back.

>or place multiple AREXX commands throughout my cuelist. Seems
>like a bit of a hastle.

Indeed. Not to worry, the next larger update will contain redirection
support so you shouldn't have to worry about this in this conjunction.

I'm going on vacation now so I will have to get back to all this after the
summer.

To those of you who have ttried the SuperModel patch -

has anyone had any problems with the asl requesters ? If so, what OS do you
run (2 or 3) ? I'm also interrested in knowing if it works fine on you
machine.

Haven't used it much yet. I'm about to. But for now;

Works well on my PPC '060 with CyberGraphX. OS 3.1.
as well as

 '060 MKII, OS 3.1


A strange thing though, if I run SuperModel, then go into S16, SuperModel
will use the Topaz fonts in the requestor that S16 uses.

If I quit S16 - don't quit SuperModel - but just say
run >NIL: <path>:SuperModel
again (essentially running it twice) and restart S16 I get my default
small Helvetica fonts in my ASL requestors.

It's not a big deal, and I don't mind that it does this, I just thought
you'd like to know the bug.

Maybe I'll just try running it twice to begin with.  :-)


Kind regards,

Brian

Big? Not really. The sound card is already made and I have done
Zorro card adapters in my garage. Proto could be done easily enough.
The software driver would be the work though. And your point is exactly
what I was telling my friend about his VERY BIG developer ideal for a
card. Zorro amiga is dead like it or not. Unless Amiga or Phase5
chages direction, that's the truth. But I thought this Ideal could mean
a $50 sound card for all exsisting zorro amigas. If interest is totally
dead for even this though, then I guess I will just keep using my
AD516 the same way, tied to the pc. And whatever fantastic card
might appear  could still be 2-3 years away. Even then S16 will
still kick butt :) And so far PCI has not even been announced as the
standard. Also 16 bit ISA sound cards are still the norm. Only one
PCI sound card I can remember so far, and it still has hardware/driver
issue problems. Any one know of any off hand?

Nah, not even that....... they will just want a video slot for the
toaster.
The zorro cards are going the way of the IBM microchannel.

I think golden gate was way more that is needed here.
And yes, I'm talking single slot.

Swap? Why? data to data's, addresses to addresses. With software to
handle the data transfer. A companion .lib file similar to AD512 handler.

If your trying run in a Pc compatible mode, I can see that might be a
problem.
But if I hardwire the card to the zorro buss through a slot converter, I
should be
able to push data to the DSP through brute force. A mod to the PC sound
card
could be necessary to bypass any DMA exspectations the PC is waiting for,
or maybe the slot converter could convert a zorro id request to a dma
signal
to make it happy. I don't know yet, but i almost doublt that would be
needed though.
 
Thanks for the input.

Hello there,
Here a little bit of my experiences......

There is no good software for Amiga platform, that performs
Clicks  and pops removal from old records.
At least, actually.
I've tried with almost of them.
None is fast, either.
if you really want to try, you can do it, but manually all the
time. You will have to find each glitch one by one and remove them,
one by one.
Too much job with a great delay..... 

If you want to perform a good job at a reasonable price, you
can use SoundForge 4.0 with Noise reduction plugIn  on a
Windows platform.

If you own a PC 233MMX the work is pretty fast.
Example: on a LongPlay record (About 35min) you spend around
70 min of your Pentium CPU.
If you own a PentiumII 350MHZ, this time falls down to the same time
of your LP

I've tried with SamplitudeOpus 060. It took around  6hours to 
perform the same task.
And all the Clicks and pops removal function was  made by hand.
Perhaps, If samplitude goes PowerPC, we will have a better time with
a better alghoritm.

A brief explanation of SoundForge tools:

There is an option called Vynil restoration. Here you can  adjust
various parameters like:

Noise floor from -inf to -40db 
Reduce noise by Off to 100Db
Click removal  amount from 1 to 20
Affect frequencies above 100HZ to 10000HZ
Attack speed from 1 to 20
Release speed from 1 to 20
Find large gitch with adjust of sensitivity: Slope and proximity
Find small glitch with the same adjust...
Interpolate or replace settings
There is a tool to use extra verification when searching for clicks.

Note that for this option you do not need to get the noise (Envelope mode)

If you want to  use Noise print, you  have other Tool called Noise reduction.
Here you must get a sample of the noise (Noise print method).
You can remove CasseteHiss, Air conditioner noise, Vynil noise, Clicks and
Pops,
Hum remove, etc.

Please, if you look for more details, let me know.
As you and many others, I am waiting for a good Sound Editing Software to the
Amiga.
Until it not comes, I do my job on a  Windows Platform.

Best Regards,
Francisco

The old 2.05 (or 2.08) and 3.0x isn't compatible unfortunately. SuperModel
can only be used with 3.0x. If you need to run 2.0x sometimes you can't run
SuperModel first as it will open the studio.library v4 (v4 is for Studio 16
v3). This will probably produce crashes as when S16 v2.0x tries to open the
lib it will first look in the resident library list and find v4.

Does "Avail flush" get around this, or does something forget to close the
library?

Hello troy


> card. Zorro amiga is dead like it or not. Unless Amiga or Phase5
> chages direction, that's the truth.

The BoXeR has both ZorroIII and ISA (active). Plans for the BoXeR 2
include PCI, but it's not clear whether that will still have ZorroIII
as well (it'll be at least next year before BoXeR 2 appears).
For those who want to mix Amiga stuff with ISA the BoXeR will be a
good, though expensive, solution.
It is supposed to be available in about 6-8 weeks time. 
IIRC there is no sound card driver for Golden Gate but a way has been
found to drive sound cards from BoXeR, which is register-compatible
with GG. 

Apart fron struggles with IRQs etc, how similar are PC sound card
drivers? Do you need a driver for each card? There's one called
Terratec (?) with audio sockets on a front panel which looks handy.
Actually I'm constantly surprised at how adequate 14-bit Paula can be
for routine monitoring, if you go through a good amp and speakers.

Yes, a very cheap adaptor with an AHI driver for a PC card would be
useful.

Noone forgets to close the library - it must stay open in order to have the
patch beeing effective. Closing the library after it's patched will simply
remove the effect. If the library was to be patched everytime it was made
resident the OS function OpenLibrary() must be patched too or the binary
itself must be altered.

'Avail flush' and other dedicated utils can solve the problem with conflicts
between 2.08/3.01 in other situations.

As SuperModel is a hack and highly optional - if it conflicts with your
setup (ie. if you run both 2.08 / 3.01) don't use it. Or, ctrl+c break it
when you change programs from 3.01 to 2.08, flush memory and then start
2.08. This can be automated with a script started from icon/menu etc.

Oddly enough I've been playing with this vey thing over thing over the
last 
24 hours. Jamie Krutz was kind enough to tell me about the "avail flush" 
shell command to go between versions 2.0 and 3.0.
Unfortunately the avail flush doesn't close SuperModel of course. However
(thanks Kenny) if you do a "control C" or better yet try the "Tbreak"
command (Stefan Le Breton) from Aminet you can use that in a script to end
SuperModel and go between v2.0 and v3.0 freely.

The other thing is that you cannot run any assigns as SuperModel does not
want to "let go"(for lack of a more specific term) of the
Studio16_3: assign once SuperModel is run.

So simply put, disable the assigns for Studio16 out of your user-startup,
and make out a script that you can run either v2.0 or v3.0 using IconX or
your favorite button launcher is what I am doing.

You should be able to get the advantages of both versions that way.

Hope this is not too confusing.

I was just addressing the [2.08 w/o SuperModel]->[3.01 w/ SuperModel]
case.

Sounds like a cleanup bug in SuperModel.  Shouldn't be too hard to fix.

No, the assigning is done by Studio 16 itself when studio.library is opened
the first time (init code). This is nothing that SuperModel is responsible
of. Here is the scematic on what SuperModel do:

 1) Open libraries (incl. studio.library)  <- here assigns are issued by
                      studio.library with no control from mother program.
 2) Patch vectors via exec/SetFunction()
 3) Wait for Ctrl+C
 4) Remove patches
 5) Close libraries

Nowere is an assign function called. To remove an assign from a script you
simple do:

assign Studio16_3:

or

assign Studio16_3: remove

I think he's claiming that removing the assign doesn't work.  Usually this
is due to something still having a lock on it.

I have files to build your own, but when he can pickup a multi
port model used for about 30-40$US, Is it worth his trouble?
I built my own interfaces for C64/128 and amiga, but that was
years
ago when the price was closer to $90 (in 1987 dollars). If he
wants
to spend the time and effort for fun, then I'll try to dig up
the files
for you.
But I would recommend getting a commercial model used if he
can.
All three of my "home mades" were retired in this way.

Help, I have had a Sunrize AD 1012 since 1994 in operation.  Only in the last month have I tried to start working with TimeCode.  After picking up the SMPTEOUT Module (2 Versions, old and new) I have been able to output TimeCode without problem, and it is there on the video tape.  

In trying to read external TimeCode, the Board or Software does not seem to recognize any TimeCode, as the External Monitor does not budge. I have set the prefs to AD1012 and made sure that the Generator and SMPTEOut Modules were closed.

Help, what could be causing this problem?  I somehow feel that the SMPTE Input port is disabled or not working.  Is there a jumper on the board itself that would deactivate it?  

Or how can I go about getting it to work?  As I am now at the point for projects were I need the TimeCode.


Thanks for any assistance.

Works just fine here. BTW I use AFR which I would never
be without..ever! AFR patches any or all of the Amigas
file requestors with highly configurable requestors. 

It remembers the exact size type and position for each
and every app as well. If you encounter problems with
a particular app, you can easily exclude AFR from patching
the requestors. AFR makes accessing your data very easy
and if you have not tried it perhaps you should. It uses
MUI and you might like it you might not. I could never
go back to not having it. Its on Aminet as AFR_2227.lha
in util/boot/ for some strange reason..

But back to the original question..it works great here
using OS3.1 and patching ASL requestors with AFR.

Lee

Works just fine here. BTW I use AFR which I would never
be without..ever! AFR patches any or all of the Amigas
file requestors with highly configurable requestors. 

It remembers the exact size type and position for each
and every app as well. If you encounter problems with
a particular app, you can easily exclude AFR from patching
the requestors. AFR makes accessing your data very easy
and if you have not tried it perhaps you should. It uses
MUI and you might like it you might not. I could never
go back to not having it. Its on Aminet as AFR_2227.lha
in util/boot/ for some strange reason..

But back to the original question..it works great here
using OS3.1 and patching ASL requestors with AFR.

Lee

I know this has come up before, but I got sidetracked and didn't see the
thread through.  Apologies that this is a repeat.

Has anyone come up with a successful set of settings for CyberGraphX V3 for
happy co-existance with Studio 16?  I am running an Amiga 3000/25 with a
Spectrum board, running CyberGraphX V3 (latest available from the website). 
Even in Cyber V2, Studio 16 acted really funny.  Dragging things around with
the mouse is a nightmare, as it 'hangs' every second for about as long
(dragging around the current position, any flags, etc.. screen refreshes in
general sort of lurch along.)  It makes it quite impossible to use sometimes.

Any suggestions welcome.

Except for the fact that I have a PPP Mercury 040 board in my A3000, I
have a system very similar to yours. I have a Spectrum, I softkick 3.1
(2.04 ROMs) and have 1 meg on the motherboard, 2 megs chip and 20 megs
on the Mercury board. I have the Spectrum set to Zorro 3 mode (jumper
on the board). Studio 16 is running on an 800x600 8 color screen that
is promoted using NewMode (available on aminet). Cybergraphix 2 worked
but Cybergraphix 3 works better. Also, I have 2 megs of memory on the
Spectrum board.

Here are some thoughts.

1. Zorro 3 makes a huge difference on screen updates and should be used.

2. Cybergraphix on the Spectrum makes use of fast RAM for storing screens
   that aren't being displayed. Do you have plenty of RAM beyond the
   amount that Studio 16 and it's channel buffers are using? Make sure to
   subtract the memory used by other software you have running, softkicked
   ROMs, and all open screens. Deep color screens take large chunks of RAM
   regardless of how many colors are actually displayed. I make sure
   NewMode assigns only as many colors as the screen takes.

3. Cybergraphix Environment variable settings make a difference, here's mine:

   ALERTEMU               0
   BOOTLOGO               0
   CPUP2C                 0
   HIDE15BIT              1
   HIRESCRSR              1
   KEEPAMIGAVIDEO         1
   NOCHIPSCREEN           0
   NOPASSTHROUGH          0
   PLANES2FAST            1
   SAVEMEM                0
   SUPERLAYERS            1

   plus

   SUPERGELS              1
   USESEMAPHORES          1

   and the tooltypes on my Spectrum file in devs/monitors:

   DRAGGING=no
   BOOTLOGO=no
   PASSTHROUGH=yes

I've had good luck with my setup, I hope this helps you track down your
bottleneck problem.

You might also want to use a screen promoter like ModePro or NewMode. I
run
an 8 bit screen limited to eight colors for Bar&Pipes as well as Studio16
and it works well for me.

I still use CyberGFX 2.x because of a "Fuzzy Pixel" problem
known to exist on certain PicassoII's. Anyway, I've never had
any problem with CyberGFX, PicassoII and Studio 16. It works
perfectly. I couldn't ask for better. 

I use an 800 x 600 8bit screen with 16 colors. I use NewMode to promote
screens, it works quite nicely.

Hmm.  Well I tried all of the ENV settings posted but have not gotten any
better of a response out of Studio 16.

I am using NewMode to promote it onto a 1024x768 (though it doesn't matter
what resolution I do it at), 8-bit CGFX screen.  I tried shutting down all
extra utilities that could potentially be interfering with graphics library
calls, but no go.

Hmm!

Are you using NewMode to reduce the number of colors on the 8-bit (256 colors)
to 8 colors? It might make a difference.

Another thing you may want to check is that your 8 bit mode is stable in
the first place in CGXmode. Then you'll want to remove the Studio16 from
NewMode before you try again. I also have NewMode set to
"ask for = None, take new screens" and it seems to be friendlier with new
screens and simpler to dial them in after you've got them to a stable 
point.

My 8-bit mode seems to be OK (I use it on Workbench as well as a few other
public screens that various things run on), and I have deleted Studio 16 out
of my NewMode config.

I played around for several hours last night and haven't made any progress.  I
cleaned out old libraries, re-loaded all the CGX drivers, etc.  One thing I
did find in my investigations is that the CGX V3 "cgxsystem.library" contains
a copy of the old V2 library, and makes it resident as the old
cybergraphics.library.  When I snoop on this library from Scount, it comes up
as the 040 version even though I don't have an 040.  I doubt this is related
to my problem since Studio16 doesn't directly call any CyberGraphX functions
in the first place, but it did strike me as odd.

Oh well.. it's appearing as this is something I'm just going to have to live
with!

Does anybody know about this card? I was looking at an old Amiga world FEB93
and saw a Sunrise Ad that had 
this card in it.

According to the knowledgeable people I have talked to when I was looking 
for one also, Sunrize went out of business before they ever actually
manufactured them - no-one that I have talked to has ever seen, or heard of
any that actually existed - too bad. 

I ended up buying a Maestro Pro digital
I/O board and Samplitude software for around $400.00 U.S., which I am still
learning to use. Quality is pro,
but manual is in german, though some of the prompts are in english - enough
to get started. 

I bought mine from Dthomas Trenn of Youngmonkey studios in Canada - he uses
one, and spoke highly of it -

Using TimeCode (which I am completely dependant on) has a number of
pitfalls. Here's things to check.... 
-Can you connect the audio output of the video deck
(where you recorded the TiimeCode) to an amp of some sort and actually
hear it? If the video deck has headphone output, this is even easier
to check.
-Do the TimeCode formats match? Considering you get *no* response at
all, this is probably not it, but it's good to verify.
-I have an AD516 board, so I'm not 100% sure, but I am pretty
confident there's no jumper for anything. Do you see any pins that
look like a jumper block could connect them?
-What is the dB level you are recording the SMPTE signal at? I have
had the best luck at around -7dB. Too hot, and it will distort, too
low, and it won't be 'heard' at all. You want to get it as low as
possible to minimize it creeping into your other audio signals.  I
arrived at this -7 level by recording at 0dB, and attenuating it
during playback until it quit working, then bring it back up a bit so
it will be reliable. 
-Do you have any other source for SMPTE code other than the TimeCode
out module of S16? The cheapest thing I can think of is there is a CD
somebody sells that has a long audio track of timecode as well as a
bunch of test tones for audio equipment calibration. 

Hope some of this helps.

Thanks, I will try it out. I had the advice earlier to record it at higher and higher levels. Yes, I hear the timecode with headphones and through an Amp.  I first tried recording at 0 Level then +3, +7, and +10 dB.

I will try again, thanks.

SMPTE Timecode exsists in different frame rates.

In Europe we use 25 fps as most common SMPTE Timecode
But there are others, like 24 fps (USA i think) and 30 fps for Film projects

You have to know in what framerate your source timecode is.
In your Studio16 prefs you can choose between all the framerates, trie them
till you find the wright frame-rate of your source timecode.

Another problem can be the volume of your timecode strapped on tape, when this is
to low, the Ad1012 or Ad516 will not see it as timecode.
When the volume is too loud you can get a distorted SMPTE signal, both the boards
will not reconize the timecode-signal.

Check if your timecode-cable runs free of Monitors and other EMC related
equipment, this can distord you timecode-signal.
Check your plugs on wrong soldering etc etc.

Ok, when all this not works, i think you have a problem with your hardware.


Succes with your quest.

We record SMPTE at -8db. The higher levels cause distortion in the smpte signal and  occasional loss of synch.

Hey there... it's been a while... but I'm still here.....

I just added a Quantum 6.4GB drive to my system. I updated to the 43.19
version of fastfilesystem that's on the Amiga web site. Supposedly this will
allow for larger than 4GB drives... but I still seem to be having problems. It
never seems to recognize that last partition on the drive. For example... I
first partitioned it exactly in half, calling them DH2 and DH3. DH3 would not
come up onto the workbench screen. Then I partitioned into 3. DH2, DH3, & DH4,
all three of them 2GB in size. DH4 refuses to show its face.....

Any idea's anyone?

I added a Quantum 6.4GB Drive to my machine, and downloaded the latest
fastfilesystem from Amiga's web site  (43.19), but still have trouble reading
the last partition on my drive, no matter what the size.

for example.....

DH2:   = 3.2GB        DH3:    = 3.2GB        - Only DH2: will show up allowing
me to format.

DH2:  = 2.0GB         DH3:    =2.2GB        DH4:    =2.2GB            - Only
DH2:   and   DH3: will show up


does 43.19 of fastfilesystem only allow 4GB drives? 


Thanks

I believe it is your partition size.  The drive can be big but your
max partition size is limited to two gigs.  Pretty sure this is
correct even with the new ffs.

BTW AFS Pro is wonderful with big drives.  I used to have problems
with FFS every once in a while.  Kept up with all the disktool
programs.

Then with AFS Pro I never had any problems except for it allocating
some blocks that were not used.  I just run DiskValid once in a
while.(Comes with AFS).

Wonderful not waiting on a disk to validate itself.  That used to
drive me nuts.  I have two four gig drives and one 2 gig.  It takes
mucho time for even one to validate.

Finally, bonus, AFS Pro is more than noticeably faster than FFS.

Down side is cost.

DISCLAIMER: The statistic counting is automated and there might be some

- The survey -

First I must say I'm surprised about the high number of forms (128). I have
removed duplicates (senders client-address is used as id) at best. Many nice
comments - thanks to everyone. I will not have time to reply personally to
those who requested it at this time, sorry about that.

The result from this survey will be used as an indication for what to
develop for Studio 16.

There should be no doubt that an AHI driver is wanted as this will open up
AHI-aware software to use the Sunrize audio cards as recorder/player. The
price will most likely be less than the threshold value in the survey.

Even though a sample editor has higher pri than the mixer I will make a
mixer module first due to development time. If a sample editor was to be
made first there will be atleast a year of no development. Besides, there
are no alternative to the mixer module (software-wise) like there are
alternatives to sampleeditors.

So, conclusion is that an AHI driver will be made first. Start-time for
development is after the summer. The numbers above look ok, but I will see
what they turn out to be in the real world before I continue on other Studio
16 stuff.

Later I will post an excert/compilation of the comments and wishes from the
forms. I will also add a few comments myself and they will be open for
discussion. I will also present some of my plans for the mixer/sample
editor.

But for now I'm gonna enjoy what's left of the sun.. ;-)

Have a nice time everyone! Feel free to comment the results btw.


- Kenny

Hello Jeffrey;

I'm not sure I really understand your problem. Perhaps you
could elaborate:

-->old and new) I have been able to output TimeCode without 

You are using the SMPTE_Out Generator, and you are able to
generate a signal on the Amiga Right channel. Correct?


-->In trying to read external TimeCode, the Board or Software
-->does not seem to recognize any TimeCode, as the External
-->Monitor

You are trying to read a SMPTE timecode into the Sunrize card,
and you are getting no response. Correct? If you look at the
display of the Internal Generator, or Generator Monitor (you
can keep them both open at the same time), there is no code
counting up? If you look at the Cuelist, the Play button is not
pressed in?

What is the "External Monitor"? Is this the window which
displays the SMPTE code being played (Generator Monitor)?


-->does not budge. I have set the prefs to AD1012 and made
-->sure that the Generator and SMPTEOut Modules were closed.

You do not have to close any windows when reading, or
generating SMPTE code from any of the generators (internal, or
external).

The Internal Generator takes priority over the SMPTE_Out Module
as far as the Cuelist is concerned, but you can have them
running both at once.

If you press the Play button on the Cuelist, or the Play button
on the Internal SMPTE Generator, does the Cuelist start to
play? If so, your card is probably working fine.

There are no settings which disable the SMPTE port on the
Sunrize card. I know it sounds silly, but the obvious place to
start looking is the signal coming into the Sunrize card.
a) Is your cable properly connected?
b) Is your cable in working condition (both shield and hot)?
b) Is your SMPTE source actually generating a signal? You can
verify this by hooking up an oscilloscope. You should see some
alternating square pulses. Even a Voltmeter will do in a pinch.
c) Is your SMPTE "loud" enough? The Sunrize is pretty
sensitive, but, you should be able to see at least a 1 volt
peak-to-peak output on your SMPTE code, if not more (I forget)
on your 'scope.


I don't know if I've addressed any of your questions, but I
hope this helps, Jeff. Let me know what you find.

A Wise Old Man Once Told Me: "Go Away!!!". And So, I Did
________________________________________________________














Help, I have had a Sunrize AD 1012 since 1994 in operation. 
Only in the last month have I tried to start working with
TimeCode.  After picking up the SMPTEOUT Module (2 Versions,
problem, and it 
is there on the video tape.  


Help, what could be causing this problem?  I somehow feel that
the SMPTE Input port is disabled or not working.  Is there a
jumper on the board itself that would deactivate it?  

Or how can I go about getting it to work?  As I am now at the
point for projects were I need the TimeCode.


Thanks for any assistance.

Kenny -
Sorry to be so dumb, but what is an AHI??  Where is it?  Sounds like software
that will be useful.
Happy summer,

AHI is to soundcards as CyberGraphX and Picasso96 are to gfx cards.  See

You will also see that the new program NewPlay can do the stuff Scala EX can
do as well. The reason why this can't be used directly for AHI is that the
Studio 16 API (what Scala, NewPlay and Studio 16 itself and more uses..) is
buffering samples from disk while an AHI driver require the sample data to
be in memory.

Now, the sample data that gets loaded from disk via Studio 16 is of course
loaded into memory first, but the buffers are "hidden" and can't be obtained
with the use of the Studio 16 API. That means the AHI driver can't access
the data, atleast not reliable. The whole thing would be a guessing-project.

If that should be possible to do you must either know the code behind the
API, the meaning of every privat and undocumented structure fields and so
on. Today only the creators of the API knows these things and they are
bounded by nda's etc.

So, in order to get sample data from disk into memory for AHI, the Studio
16 must be fooled to think it's reading and writing data to disk as that is
what it's built for. There are several ways to do this, some good and some
bad. After evaluating the possibilities it's been decided to fool it with a
disk handler which the dos (and Studio 16) will think is a device and file,
while AHI and the handler co-operate to share the data loaded into memory.
This will provide double buffering and the needed buffers for AHI. It will
also allow Studio 16 to run simultainously.

This is a project that will start in some weeks. It remains to see if the
theory work in the real world as well.

I have the needed docs, both for the old Studio 16 and the new (3.01). I
just very recently got the needed key to the API after spending almost a
year _intensivly_ to figure out the system and fileformats. I also have a
hardware map on the DSP for AD1012 and AD516, but the info is just not
enough to use the board directly. It would require knowledge about
ADSP2105 programming as well so that the DSP can be made "intelligent" (the
DSP must be programmed with some "handler" code too).

BTW: the AHI driver will work with both the AD1012 and AD516.

Hi Kenny,
              Just like to let you know I'm still behind you as far
as the AHI driver is concerned, as I'm sure everyone else 
on this list is,  We all have faith in you and appreciate 
immensely the amount of work you must be doing to 
implement AHI. If anyone can do it I'm sure you can. 
Can wait to hand over the $$$/'s to you.

Cheers for now, 


Wayne.

I think the DSP info is available from Analog Devices, but I couldn't tell
for sure looking at the website, since the closest you get to particulars
is the *family* of DSPs until you start downloading and printing huge PDF
files.

The board also has a ROM which presumably contains DSP code (though
conceivably it's just tables).  That would have to be reverse-engineered
as well.  There are also several PALs, although the hardware information
you already have may cover that. 

Simple hardware<->sofware question:  Does Studio16 autodetect the AD516
interrupt priority, or would the sofware need to be changed if the jumper
were moved.  I can tell by looking at the board that the jumper has no
effect other than changing the interrupt level, so it can't be directly
readable.

------------ STUDIO 16 ML SURVEY COMMENTS AND WISHES EXTRACT ------------

The comments below are collected from the survey forms. I have tried to
represent common comments/wishes with one line, though some wishes will
appear in other lines as well.


SMPTE/Sync
	- Can it be possible to EASILY access the SMPTE reader to drive an
	  external subtitling program?
	- Improving SMPTE LTC for pic and sound mix
	- New SMPTE output
	- Sync to AVI/QT etc animations with timecode for soundtrack work -
	  i.e. display thumbnails on a video timeline in sync

Sound
	- A system to apply pro-quality effects to each track - at the
	  moment, no Amiga sample editors will do that.
	- Also beeing able to make volume adjustments at specified times in
	  the sample - not making them permanent.
	- Better control over effects during and after recording,
	  especially echo.
	- Compression and surround sound encoding
	- Directly record in CDDA (LSB or MSB first) format
	- I can't stress enough how I would love to see sourround sound
	  implemented into Studio 16.
	- I would also like to see more effects, and undos for the effects
	- I would like to have an effectsmodule to add specific effects to
	  parts of the mix - making external modules down to a minimum.
	- I would like to see SamplitudeOpus with a driver for Studio16
	- Lower frequency response. I work with brain frequencies. We use
	  the Amiga for voice analysis and wanted a card that would work in
	  the lower alpha, theta frequencies.
	- Module which lets you slow playback but retain original pitch
	  (educational)
	- More effects and an integrated EQ are my immediate wishes.
	- More samples effects in the sample editor would be a major boost,
	  such as "time-stretching" as switching between Octamed and
	  AudioMaster is rather awkward. Also regarding this an auto channel
	  deallocate would be an option, i.e. when another program requires
	  the channels Octamed automatically deallocates them and when this
	  program closes Octamed reallocates?
	- More use of the DSP, digital I/O, and PPC support.
	- MP3 Encoding and Decoding Capibilities
	- NewPlay is good. It would be useful to me if it could open on any
	  public screen and had and AREXX Port to load and trigger samples.
	- Scrub capability
	- Sound analysis for making animation dope-sheets. That is: Run a
	  dialogue through a program and get a list out that reads:
	  Frame 4: "a" Frame 5: "h" etc.
	- Studio 16 3.01 needs more  Live Effects  like 2.04 just more
	  improved !
	- The abilities to control a CD-ROM directly
	- What about software limiter and compressor?
	- Would prefer to see an integrated sample handler/mixer module that
	  shows modulation waveforms of the sample in the sample bars for
	  ease of cueing the sample in the cuelist.

MIDI
	- Audio to MIDI; MIDI to Audio (Recyle on the MAC)
	- I'd like to hook up to a MIDI keyboard and use S16 as a Sampling
	  Keyboard
	- More midi

Mixer
	- Being able to type in text strings in the Mixer channel windows
	  (Bass, E Gtr, Ld Vox, etc.)
	- EQ incorporated with in mixer
	- I would like to have a mixer module where I can add effects at
	  certain timecodes and for a specified time.
	- Output of midi info from the mixer so external hardware can be
	  automated both ways.

API
	- Hooks for 3rd party developers - shared library.
	- Shared library that allows us to use the DSP to process datafiles
	  to create FFT's and the like

GUI
	- A Gui for the smpte sunrise par link up.
	- Better CyberVision 64, will not display sample in sample editor in
	  any mode.
	- Better GUI
	- Improved interface or MUI interface
	- Updating the look of the interface would be great.  Maybe a
	  different one for Music production and Film/video production?

Cuelist
	- An easy way to adjust volume and EQ in the timeline window
	- Better Cue List with display of samples
	- I would like to see Q master be able to use an CMX Edl and be able
	  to mark regions of the edits in that list.
	- You have all your recorded files in one directory; a routine
	  should put them all into a 3.x cuelist by itself

Sample editor
	- A scrub option in the editor.
	- Automatic Zero-crossing point location.
	- More DSP; not necessarily real-time, but in conjunction with the
	  sample editor. (Studio16's sample editor is about perfect; I've
	  always loved the way you can drag the range from either side
	  without having to reselect the entire portion).
	- Plug in interface for effects
	- Some basic EQ for a start and hopefully a plug in interface for
	  effects. Much like the DirectX plug in system on PC systems.
	- The abilibity to run a standard form of plugin with the studio 16
	  editor would be nice.  that would open up alot of possiblities.
	- Time compress/expand feature (making a sound shorter/longer at the
	  same pitch)

Misc
	- A 'CD Looper-like'(on PC) module that lets musicians and students
	  understand music and scales and analyse jazz solos etc.
	- A better link to Scala MM300/400 would be good.
	- a Gui for the smpte sunrise par link up.
	- AHI is most important along with anything else that would allow
	  3rd parties to develop software easily for the board.
	- Amiga needs b/p back in action! can you write a new program?
	- Any chance of a shared library that allows us to use the DSP to
	  process datafiles to create FFT's and the like? Makes a dandy
	  co-processor for general data filtering - does not HAVE to be
	  audio files.
	- Being able to have someone to get advice from?
	- Better error handling (too many crashes)
	- Digital I/O, more analog I/Os, plug-ins for processing, and better
	  MIDI support
	- Digital multitracking software
	- Direct support for Newteks Video Flyer NLE.  The Flyer lacks real
	  audio tools. I wish Studio 16 was my Flyers Audio tool
	- Driver for other soundcards
	- How about a Lightwave Layout Plug-In that will syncronize with the
	  Studio 16 from within Lightwave and or other Animation Programs.
	- I have sound switch and would like to use it with the toaster
	  Flyer
	- I wish that this software was available on the PC also. Whats the
	  possibility of porting it over?
	- I would like to have the ad516 s/w tightly integrated with the
	  flyer
	- I would like to see a new card with more outputs and MIDI
	  integration.
	- I'd like to see better documentation of the Studio 16 hardware and
	  firmware.
	- I'd like very much to see direct compatibility with AudioLab16 and
	  perhaps a nice ProTools-type environment so I can keep using the
	  system professioanlly for years to come.
	- Is there a way to track down the owners and buy-out the code ?
	- It might be nice to have a small gui that would include simple
	  tape deck controls for record, play, etc. similar to some for
	  Windows..  I can see using the card more if I could pop up a panel
	  on Workbench instead of opening several windows.
	- More bars and pipes support-make your own audio/midi seq like b
	  and p
	- Someone to take on as new Sunrize and continue Development,
	- Studio16 4.0 and DD-524
	- Support for Video Toaster/Flyer file audio format and PC .wav
	  files.
	- The biggest limitations at this point are: 1) digital I/O 2)
	  plug-in support 3) the ability to edit MIDI and audio
	  simultaneously.
	- The neccessary features to compete with the PC based equivalants
	  as is Studio 16 develpment never stopped
	- Tutorial Videos
	- Your modules (with GUI) to open on Studio16 screen
	- Just DO IT
