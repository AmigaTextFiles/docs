<BLUE-KNIGHT> OK ITS 10:20 :-)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Here it goes!!!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Let me tell you all I know about the New Tek Toaster and save the
questions for later.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> There is a new Toy from New Tek called the 4000 toaster... they
announced it this week at NAB.
<CHRIS.P> sheesh, denny, scrounging for attention  <grin>   So, how's that NEW
BOOK of yours?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The info here is directly from New Tek themselves! It is not
second hand reports so you can consider it all Fact :-) Including the
pricing... If anyone want's proof I can show the phone bill to Topeka :-)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The 4000 Toaster is a card that will work in 2000, 3000 and the
4000. Although the special features are 4000 specific there is some
improvements to the software
<Paul> Why would Topeka want to see the bill?  :)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> as well so that regular owners can have some great things out of
this as well.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> I will mention the prices later write now here are the features
about the 4000 toaster. I will go more info on what it will lack in the no AGA
machine later.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Welcome,  G.GILBERTSON 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The 4000 toaster uses full AGA capabilities for a few things... 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> here are the improvements.... There are new effects that are
praticular to AGA mode. since I have not seen them I can not say if they are
great or not.. that will come in about a week when I get more feedback from
people at NAB.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The addition software (TOASTER 3.0 now) has 9 banks of effects
now.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Although they still did not include a program that will rearange
them or create new effects from you there are plenty of 3rd party programs to
do that. Cureently at least 3 that I know off.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The additions of a cleaner Genlock with the ability to use the
processing features as well. So there is no more need to record from Workbench
as current toaster owners have to.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Now you can use the Switcher to run the animations :-)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Welcome,  C.GIESEKE 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> There is a whole new rewritten TOASTER CG.
<SIDEWINDER> hi 'yal....
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The new CG is all mouse driven so that you can move and position
the letters directly by mouse.
<CHRIS.P> did they shoot the guy that wrote the old one?
<CHRIS.P> sorry :-)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Most of the features are mouse driven with the ability to pull
down menues for more features.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> In other words they made it like Amiga software :-)
<(otis> be nice he was an ex pres of our San Diegoo Amiga Group
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Welcome,  M.SMALLS1 
<CHRIS.P> sorry otis :)  never could figger that CG out, tho
<M.SMALLS1> hi, guys!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> You can also change fonts and adjust colors styoes and other
nieat things all by mouse now!
<SIDEWINDER> whats the latest version of the TOaster? (prob asked
already sorry
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Wait till later sidewinder I am listing the features of it now!
<SIDEWINDER> heh 'k.. 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> There is also COMPUGRAPHIC and POSTSCRIPT type 1 support directly
from CG.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> CG also autmoatically space letters properly for you (in DTP
world its Kerning)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Ther are over 300 FONTS included with the software.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> You can load images into CG as background now and Toaster Paint
brushes as graphic elemnts... all directly now.
<CHRIS.P> wow
<BLUE-KNIGHT> You can draw semi transparent boxes in CG now so that you can
have the look like they do in the real pro CG's that cost over 200,000
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Thats the things for CG now.... Here is the not so good news.
<gg> now==2010
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Toaster Paint is not rewritten yet... but expect to see an
upgrade for it with it totaly rewritten in a few months.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Here is the best PART LIGHTWAVE!!!!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Lightwave 3.0 Pro is the same Pro version that was announced in
the Amiga show with lens flares and other neat things which we can talk about
later. 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Welcome,  S.LUTNES 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> It now supports directly Postscript and CG fonts directl
<Crickets> Hi all :>
<BLUE-KNIGHT> AThe other things is that it does is tremendous speedup on the
4000 with code directly written for the 4000 (although that part is not
confirmed yet).
<CHRIS.P> howdy Syl! Yury's talking about 4000 Toaster
<BLUE-KNIGHT> There are new effects like lesn flares and out of fouceeffecs and
soft edge shadwos.
<SIDEWINDER> Wow...
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The new interesting this is the modeler! Whichallows you tho draw
curves cut holes inobjects (boolean feature) and create text objects directly!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The greatest part of it is this!!!!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> YOU CAN RECORD LIGHTWAVE ANIMATIONS IN REAL TIME FROM THE
SWITCHER!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Ok close your mouths now :-)
<SIDEWINDER> heh
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The playback of Lightwave anims is thorugh the 4000's AGA chips
in HAM8 at full resolution. Which gives you great looking animations
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The conversion is automatic for the animation creation from
Lightwave.
<M.SMALLS1> Saw the thing at NAB
<M.SMALLS1> Look great!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> IF you have 8 megs of memory I think it is RUMORED to play 3
seconds and with more memory (4000 takes up to 18 on motherboard) it plays 16
or so... but that is not confirmed yet.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The best features is the price.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> it is lower then the 2000 toaster at $2395.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> You can use it in the 2000, 3000 and the 4000 but with only 6
banks of effects
<BLUE-KNIGHT> OH I forgot to mention... now there are 3 frame buffers instead
of 2 frame buffers int he 4000 version. 
<M.SMALLS1> any upgrade policy?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> The upgrade for software only form Lightwave 2.0 to 3.09 is $799
<BLUE-KNIGHT> If you want to upgrade the board you can send it back and get the
new Toaster for $1199
<BLUE-KNIGHT> If you want to keep the old toaster send in disk 8 and get the
Toaster 4000 for $1799.
<M.SMALLS1> NNot bad!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> If you send in disk 8 you are still eligeble for the software
upgrade!!!! so you can get both.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> ThATS IT From my end.... open for questions ... what do you all
think??
<BLUE-KNIGHT> OH SHIPPING should start middle to end of next month!
<SIDEWINDER> WOwzers!
<(otis> sounds great
<M.SMALLS1> Great!
<SIDEWINDER> Hay did anyone see KIKI at the Toaster show?
<gg> question:   NOW = ???  WHEN = ????
<(otis> weren't there originally some 'upgrades' for the hardware
side of the Toaster
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Yeah it does sound good! I could not get pricing on it myself (as
a dealer) since the pricing for dealeres is not set!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Gary... read my last line!!!
<(otis> or unused features?
<Rick> Is there a new advertizing  blitz planned?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Welcome,  S.ROLLINSON 
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Well I guess they did not use them... since the 4000 came out and
they can do alot better by redesigning the board.
<AskMeBtMyBk> Is Toasterpaint HAM8 now? Any idea if this one will fit
in a single slot without blocking others?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Rick I have no idea about that ... I am sure knowing New Tek
there is... but now they are cooperating with C= so you might want to look for
a joint add.
<CHRIS.P> hey, doesn't the A4000T have two video slots?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Denny It goes in the video slot.... I think it will crowd the
other slot but not kill it!
<gg> LW 3.0 is spose2b out by the end of May?
<(otis> yes
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Yep Chris 2 of them
<Rick> How many Toasters have been sold?
<CHRIS.P> you could have a Toaster AND an AGA display enhancer for superfast
animation!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Gary Lightwave 3.0 will be included with the Toaster 3.0 upgrade
and the price... well you know the price now!
<SIDEWINDER> Can toaster paint be used JUST with the HAM8...like
all the same features?
<AskMeBtMyBk> Is Toasterpaint HAM8 now?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Rick there are alot of 2.0 toaster sold... ALOT Of them but no
4000 toasters are available yet.
<gg> sorry BK... need to hear it a few times...  been VAPORized
so much in the past hehe
<BLUE-KNIGHT> No Denny they say the upgrade to Toasterpaint will be in a few
months... did not finish it for this release!
<AskMeBtMyBk> sheesh!
<Rick> How many toasters of ALL kinds were sold?
<(otis> May be off topic, but didn't I see on my local BBS that
Commodore was going to be doing some special pricing in conjunction with
NewTek?
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Sidewinder if you are using the 4000 you can use Toaster FX and
Image FX to have Image FX as a toaster paint program which is better then
Toaster Pain. At leastt the 2.0 toaster paint.
<SIDEWINDER> Awsome!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Rick a in the 100,000 range I am sure... no wonder Tim drives a
ferrari :-)
<M.SMALLS1> big time!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> See this weeks news with a statement from C= (We get C=
statements directly for the news here so its the first place you see them)
<Rick> I have heard the figure of 60,000 toasters which at $2400
adds up to about $150,000,000.
<SIDEWINDER> lots 'o bread..
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Rick the only people that can tell you about the toaster is New
Tek themselves.
<M.SMALLS1> takes money to make money!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Rick I am talking bout sales!
<SIDEWINDER> Will there be a TOaster version for the
1200..(holdingbreath)
<Rick> Are there any plans for a PAL version of the toaster?
<M.SMALLS1> the bottom line is to market,market!
<S.ROLLINSON> GOT HERE LATE. Can someone list the what, when, how much of the
4oo toaster for me. thanks.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Rick no so far there are no releases or plans about PAL version.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Welcome,  FRED.M 
<FRED.M> hello!
<BLUE-KNIGHT> S.ROLLINSON I already went through it all... It will be in the
library tomorow if you wnat to read the specifics on it.
<BLUE-KNIGHT> I have no more strenght to type in in again now :-)
<SIDEWINDER> heh....
<S.ROLLINSON> Ok, thanks, I'll get it tomorrow.
<SIDEWINDER> So theres no A1200 support Yuri??
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Sidewinder there will be no A1200 support for the Toaster :-)
<FRED.M> is the 4000 toaster a new board or just physically altered to fit?  I
assume the software has been upgraded?
Message sent to Job 11 
<SIDEWINDER> time to up the grade.. :)
<BLUE-KNIGHT> Fred its a new board.... with alot of new features and Toaster
3.0 software to take special use of the AGA chipset.
