Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hiya,

I heard about the World of Amiga 2ooo being held in
Birmingham, UK. After that I've heard nothing else
plus the website (http://www.worldofamiga.com) seems
to have no information what so ever.

Has this been cancelled? Its coming very close to
the usual dates for such events and little has been
said, I really hope it hasn't been cancelled as I was
actually looking forwards to going even just for the
atmosphere.

Toodle Pip!

Subject: [just-amiga] Absolute Beginners
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi just-amiga people,

Copying following email to just-amiga egroups to give some indication where
i'm at. Have had lots of help from an Amiga user-group member via phone,
snail + email, now trying to find own way. Have much to learn and hoping
for some help or a prod in the right direction here and there.

Other questions - apart from obvious unfamiliarity (long spelling of
'ignorance') with net software and etiquette -  how can I check if FPU
present? preferably without opening up my Amiga. Voyager 3.2 about: says
image decode vimg lib is 68020. On install I selected 68030+FPU (there was
no 68030 without FPU option. I've set 'images' config to '2 pass' and fpu.

Don't know modem speed. thought it was 33k, have set interface to 38k and
miami says V34 but have read somewhere that 32bis=9,600bps. Tried USR
website but no info - its prob obsolete.

Offline browsing is 'interesting':-) seem to lose some links or complete
websites after switch-off or reboot. just had a thought-maybe should
install Voyager Docs in V drawer. 

Cache directory takes ages to load, then, after selectting and viewing
something, if i go 'back' to directory it goes through the whole loading
process again.

Don't know when to use 'cache memory flush' or prune.

re - long load time for cache directory, I read emails from just-amiga re HD
cache. As my HD is relatively empty to date I copied everything from the
sector containing internet files to another sector, reformatted the sector
with directory cache OFF and copied them back. Don't know yet if any
different. (Had a look how to do it just using HDtools but couldn't find an
option to do it).
 
I hope these things not too trivial to engage brains:-)

Thanks in advance, I'll be grateful for any daylight.

Type 'cpu' in a shell or in the command line of workbench.
If you have a fpu, you will see '68030 68882'
Or look at your acceleration board. If there is an empty square socket,
you have no fpu.

The most bang for your buck would be to upgrade to MiamiDx. :-) Upgrading
from Miami to MiamiDeluxe is $30US. :-) I think that includes from 2.x to
Deluxe (otherwise it is 3.x to Deluxe.. but I don't think 2.x is excluded)

open a CLI and type "cpu".. it should look something like this;

if you have 68882 or 68881 present, then yes you do have an FPU...

it would probably crash if you didn't have an FPU...

that is all fine.. i wouldn't touch anything in there...

even after visiting whole webpages, you never seem to actually get the WHOLE
thing in your cache.. don't know why ;(

yup.. this is just a little bit of crap programming really.. the author
(bless him) works hard on the browser and such, but should really have an
'index' file for the cache - it takes AGES to load on EVERYONE's system! :)

> Don't know when to use 'cache memory flush' or prune.

you don't have to use them at all if you don't want to.. the browser will
automatically prune/delete old stuff out of the cache.. you can use 'memory
flush' if you find your running low on memory after a good 10+mins of
browsing...

i would highly recommend re-formatting the sector/partition *WITH* Directory
Cache ON.. it does give significantly faster HD access..

i signed up for that too.. and if you did it on the THURSDAY 20th like I

what does TKG BBS stand for?? I use to run Innovations BBS on xenolink
(which has stopped developement).. i'm interested in setting up a telnet
BBS and I remember when I first bought Xenolink, it was a hot battle (back
in 1994/95) between Xeno and Zeus. anyway, now, its obvious that Zeus is
'better'.. it was even better back at the time.. i just didn't realise, and
I think the cost was substantially higher...

anyway, how much does Zeus cost now!??! still available? and what useful
internet features does it use?!? is it any good for telnet? (i imagine so,
even Maxs was)...

thanks

 HW> Directory Cache ON.. it does give significantly faster HD access..

DO NOT DO THIS FOR HARD DISKS!

Directory caching for floppy disks only, on hard disks you have a huge
overhead in reading file lists, blocks, and everything else.

 HW> obvious that Zeus is
 HW> 'better'.. it was even better back at the time.. i just didn't realise,

Zeus was pretty much the same price as Xeno, until Xeno dropped to 60 quid -
Zeus then dropped to 75..

 HW> anyway, how much does Zeus cost now!??! still available? and what

I'm working on Zeus everyday, in fact release 1.4 is due soon.  You'll find
pricing on our website (along with credit card ording facilities) at
http://www.bleach.demon.co.uk/zeus/

You can also order by cheque if you want.

We supply Zeus on CD-R disks.  If you don't have a CD-ROM drive (ha!) then we
can arrange to send a /big/ archive via e-mail too.

It costs UK£59 new, or if you send us proof of purchase (front of the manual
etc., which we'll send back) of Xenolink you can get a decent discount. 
/Please/ write to zeus@bleach.demon.co.uk (or follow the guides on the
website) to arrange where to send it - as credit card ordering is more
expensive than a cheque (US$97 vs UK£59) it'd be a good idea to stick a cheque
in with the proof..

You can also buy a manual (1.1 manual with a suppliment for Zeus 1.3 features)
for UK£15 - it's expensive but they cost loads to get printed...  You get
guide and HTML online manuals on the CD.

 HW> useful internet features does it use?!? is it any good for telnet? (i
 HW> imagine so, even Maxs was)...

Currently, Zeus 1.3 relies on a third party telnet device (like TelSer) and
works well.  This will change with the 1.4 release, but I'm keeping that under
wraps until release time :)

Towerhawk is a big Tower ... not great ... I've some trouble with the

My God.....some people are still on that list....probably rabbiting on

and sending 150 mails a day to do it :(

Depends if you try and get on between 6-11p.m.,with free access at all
times and being a shift worker,I don't usually use those times.

>   and other people say it's really slow. 

I've had much slower downloads using a traditional paying ISP...it can
be slow but if you do get on ,it usually downloads about 5k/s

>They do say on their website they're dealing with the problems though... 

Yeah......we'll see :)

Argh, I hate plastic cases.  If you scratch a metal case you can paint over
it, not so with plastic.

Is the Towerhawk an A1200 tower conversion?  I'm thinking of doing it with
mine..

   He's rigth y'know. Directory caching speeds up reading a directory, but on a hard disk that is so fast anyway you really wouldn't notice a difference.

It does, on the other hand, slow writing to the disk down considerabally, and presumably take up room on the disk as well.

See ya :)

I beleive ther had been a few problems at the start, But according to
reports they seem to have sorted this out. Redhotant is run by "Free4all"

I signed up with rha last week, and within about 1 min, got the confirmatio=
n
email from them, 20 mins later I was using them. There is, in a way, a
problem, in that you can sometimes have a bit of a wait trying to connect,
but once on, generally things are ok. I have not had many line drops, the
only thing that they ask is for people NOT to stay connected all the time.
Because that makes the connecting problem for others, and they state that
they WILL track down the ones you are abusing the system, and when they do,
their accounts will be terminated :)

And ATM they are installing more modems to try to ease this problem, not ba=
d
for a new isp, IIRK since they have been active they have constantly
monitored the situation, and acted on it where possible.

I paid =A330 + =A330 a year for the top service, others are =A330 + =A320 a=
nd =A330 +
=A310. The prices are due to go up now, but they havn't announced the new
prices yet.

And the best bit yet is that they, and free4all actively support the Amiga,=
 so
that's a big point in their favour anyway:)

As My web site http://www.lordofchaos.co.uk is hosted by free4all, it now
means that updating my site is nw free through rha. I need this because in
the next few weeks, I hope to have added a great deal, (special project I
have started).

I think I have said it all above :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi everyone,

A problem has manifested itself on my Microvitec 1438 multisync monitor, and
I was wondering whether anybody else out there has experienced a similar
problem.  The video signal has started to intermittently disappear at
regular intervals, even though the monitor screen still has power to it, and
the only way to get the signal back is to tap the monitor on the side, or to
switch the monitor off for five minutes or so, and then back on again.  This
is happening whatever screen mode I happen to be in, whether playing a game,
or using workbench etc.  Any information i.e. fault description or repair
cost (and a recommended repair centre), would be much appreciated.

Writing the JVM is not a problem. There are several around.

It's the libraries that are the problem. Before you commit to starting yet
another Amiga java attempt, read up on the AWT and Swing libraries, and design
an outline of how you'd implement that on the Amiga. Work out how many classes
you need, and how many could be written per week - then work out how many
years it will take...

I'm not too happy about that :(

Pay for something, use it, get kicked for using it.

I did use Free4All at one time, and found it very reliable.  The thing that
pulled me to Freeserve was the unlimited email accounts under my own domain..
I should really register my own domain, but haven't a clue how to go about it.
 If I do it via Freeserve it'd cost £150!  So, I'm looking for other ways..

They still haven't set it up.  Well, I haven't had an email..  Perhaps I
should see if any money has left my bank account..

Try www.easily.co.uk - you can get .co.uk for a tenner + .com + .net for
=A335 - both last for 2 years and then you pay again if you want to keep it=
.

I have no connection with the company at all.  I haven't even used them - I
just came across it the other day.

Alternatively you can get one free from www.freenetname.co.uk but there are
limitations, the main one being you HAVE to use their ISP on a 0845 local
rate number to collect email and update webspace.  I personally use them at
the moment and find the service pretty good.  Tech support is on an 0800
freephone number.  These are only .co.uk

I've just checked and neilwilliams.com has gone but .co.uk and .net are
still available as @ 8.30pm 2/5/00 ( GMT+1 [BST] )

Hope that helps
Wayne

To be honest Neil I'm not really sure !! - I think they can just redirect t=
o
say a Freeserve account with email but I'm not quite sure about the
webspace.

Does anyone know what would be displayed in the address window of the
browser after entering say http://www.pyrah.net would it be that address or
would it say show the address its being diverted to like
http://www.wayne-pyrah.freeserve.co.uk for example.

When I use freenetname it actually shows http://www.pyrah.co.uk all the tim=
e
but this is actually with them so that could be why.

Like you said Neil a beginners guide would be great, maybe this could be
something for AIO ??

Sounds like a loose connection or perhaps even the tube is going.

If you have the Amiga version of the I think you'd be best off trying Analogic
(advertise on the back of Amiga Format / Active) otherwise god knows what a PC
repairer will make of the 23pin connector :)

If it's the other version with a 15pin connector then any good PC or TV repair
shop should be able to take a look.

Interesting!

How does this work?  I can understand with Freeserve and Freenetname that you
already have webspace with them and upload the pages to there, but how does it
work with Easily, for example?

Do I pay extra to have them host a web site and store email, or do they
redirect to (e.g.) my Freeserve account?

Is there a step-by-step or beginners guide to this somewhere? :)

As soon as I understand the principles behind hosting & domain names I'll
register what I need.  I don't want to do it and find I've wasted 35 quid...

Jeez I hate that,   "The tube is going".....   

Now listen,  irrespective of what you have heard,  or what "magic"
you think is inside a TV/Monitor,  unless you throw a damn ashtray 
through the front if the screen,  *picture tubes DON'T go !!!*

They have 3 colour guns,  ALL of them would have to fail simultaneously
to cause a black out.

The best you can do, is watch them fade away over periods of years.
The focus will degrade,  the brightness & contrast controls will be
flat-out and it is still not high enough for a normal picture.
One or more of the colour guns output may be so low as to cause
a  "grey scale"   imbalance,  so that everything may be  green-ish
or purple....                    That is what tubes do..............

The other ways it can fail are so rare that you would have a better
chance of catching leprosy.....

The above mentioned monitor appears to have an intermittent 
component malfuction of some kind.

Or,  if giving it a  "whack"  causes the fault to change state,
it is a bad solder joint somewhere inside..  (quite common)

That is all the information that can be supplied without a first hand
evaluation of the unit.

I think you have been talking to PC owners too-much.

You do NOT need an individual monitor driver for the P96 software.
The software IS the monitor driver....

To edit your MONITOR values,  
go into:      :prefs/picasso96mode
and define a new one or edit one in there....

Holger didn't think it would take years from the way he talked last year
aftr announcing the project.. and as for the classes, wouldn't it be faster
if multiple developers were working on it? I thought that part of what this
whole OpenAmiga open source movement thing was about.

Holger had all the source code from Sun - that's a lot easier
than writing from scratch.  Even so, Holger hasn't finished it...

Yes it would be faster if more people were working on it - but
then management becomes a major problem. The quality of the resulting
classes would also be rather variable :-/

I have a TV which started making 'pinging' sounds occasionally, turning red in
the process.  After a while of this it failed in a fairly loud way blowing the
back of the tube off.

If you think it's still repairable I do still have it to try.

I also have another TV, used for spares, in which the horizontal electromagnet
no longer works.  It is attached to the tube fairly well, but again I'm all
for trying to fix it.

<cut>

I'm not really a retard, honest, but I find 'the tube is going, man' a quicker
way of saying the obvious.

You don't need any form of software driver for a monitor.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi all,
I am hoping that someone out there can help me in finding a monitor 
driver for my Picssso  IV graphic board.  The driver I am looking for is 
for an  Electrohome 1440, series 13 autoscan monitor.  
My system is an Amiga 2000 with an old Progressive peripheral 040 
processor card and 32 MEGs memory, also can't find a newer version 
of their software driver any place.
If anyone can direct me to a place where I may find this monitor driver, 
it would be appreciated.  Here in the states it is very difficult to find any 
info for the Amiga.

The millennium is coming, Live, Love and be happy.

Traffic is down recently, normally <100 mails a day, and Ben's been keeping

I think they're looking at holding it in the autumn this year, which
would explain the lack of any concrete info at the moment

There was an announcement a few days ago that AmigaInc asked them to
postpone the show until this Fall, and apparently they have. I guess Amiga
wants to have something substantial to show off at the event...

I haven't actually looked into the company Easily but
for =A335 I would be 99% sure they only register the
.com / .co.uk domain or whatever they register.

You need to have webspace somewhere. I'm not sure if
your ISP or freeserve will allow you to have your
domain name pointed to your own webspace, you'd have
to email them to ask.

Then you will need to give easily the two DNS servers
for the webhosting so the domain knows where to be
pointed to.

For AIO I have dedicated webspace with a specific
company which isn't too expensive. Do a search for
hosting etc.

Don't get conned into paying =A3200+ for hosting as alot
of UK companies charge faaaaar too much. I suggest
looking to US companies, these are much cheaper, you
do have the hastle of paying in $$$ but in the end you'll
save money.

Although saying this your ISP may let you point to your
free space, although i'm sure not many allow this, its
worth asking.

If you are stuck in the end I can recommend who I host
aio.co.uk with. They do have their problems but you
get access to a unix/linux system which can do alot more
than just host your website, they can also subdomain
etc.

Any specific questions feel free to ask, i'll most likely
write a beginners guide for AIO possibily.

I don't know about Easily, you'll have to look at what
the provide, i do expect =A335 is just for the 2 years
internic charges.

If you want a dedicated pop3 server for your email then
expect to pay a big amount for your hosting.

If you want a .co.uk or .org.uk then freenetnames
does those free, but if you want .com/.org/.net then
=A335 is cheap. I think thats cheaper than if you
register direct with the US internic company who
handle all top level domains (.com/.org/.net) plus
you save the hastle of paying in $$$ :)

Another UK company i think charges =A325 or =A335 for
those domains is

http://www.ezee.co.uk

I don't know what they are like but i plan to register
my .com domain through them for my next project as
soon as i can find a .com name that isn't already
taken ;)

Folks:

Have any of you got this month's Amiga Active magazine?  The local
W.H. Smith doesn't have it; I tried yesterday, as well as the previous
Saturday.

Anyone else having trouble sourcing a copy, or is it just me?

PS.  Happy birthday, Chris!  :-)

Subject: [just-amiga] Great News for Me!
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi Everyone,
    Just wanted to pass along the good news that I don't have to sell my
A4000 after all!!!!

    Boy, what a relief. Especially after getting it running a little faster
and more memory. My family and some others helped me out financially so I
can still afford the Miggy. I have a smile on my face again.

    I am still moving, so I will be in North Idaho, USA, for 2 to 4 months.
Then I will be heading to Arkansas, I think, to warm up some. Hope to do
some catfishing there. I will be keeping in touch as I can.

    Thanks for all the good wishes, jokes and help. My email address for
the meantime will be

drb1939@yahoo.com

if anyone wants to get in touch personally.

    Also, many thanks to SoftwareHut for getting my Miggy going again
without charging me a king's ransom. Chris at SWH is definitely 'the Man!'

    Take care and keep the faith in the New Amiga!

-----Don

You sound like a likely candidate for the competition that's just been
launched by Pinprint. See http://amiga.org

Basically, if you can't find Amiga Active in your local area, you get put in
a draw to win a 6 month sub to the mag. And you'll be more likely to fnd it
locally in the future.


Sooner or later,

        Sandy, just fine and dandy, dandy.

Subject: [just-amiga] Screen modes
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello All at just-amiga,
My monitor is a Microvitec multiscan (computer is A1200+68030/40). In
multiscan productivity screenmode all operations seem slow compared with
PAL hi-res mode, which is more or less instantaneous. Is this something to
learn to live with or have I missed something?

DEVS: drawer has multiscan driver. Startup-sequence has a couple of lines
for a VGAonly driver so I tried changing that to multiscan but no effect.
setups for multiscan say ECS required.....whats that?

 PAL is lower resolution but I would have thought  the
 electronics/software would be fast enough for difference not to be so
obvious.

Its not just academic, it takes up a lot of time over any period, inc
paid-for online time.

To quantify it a bit I compared times to display a typical Wordworth doc
from first clicking on Ww
        multiscan = 75secs   Pal hi-res =  28secs   times approx and include
using mouse to select document.

I'd be grateful to know how to put it right if I have set up wrong.

Ta in advance
Joe

Subject: [just-amiga] Where's Henning Tietgens?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings All...

Sorry if anyone got this twice, I've had trubs with my ISP.

Does anyone know the email address of Henning Tietgens, the author of
CassCover  v1.41  on  Aminet?  I D/L'd all the cassette inlay utils I
could  find  on  Aminet  and  the printouts from this were by far the
best.  The  only problem is, all documentation and the utility itself
are all in a language that is foreign to this English (well, sort of)
speaking  Australian. It's much, much easier to find out if he's done
an  English  version  than  me doing a TAFE course and learning a new
language. (I have enough trouble with this one !!)

The address in the doc is:

                    b19b@alf.zfn.uni-bremen.de

and he's not to be found there.  TIA for any help.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Hi list members,
Thanks for the info concerning my request for help in finding a monitor 
driver for my Electrohome 1440 monitor to use with the Picasso IV 
graphic card.
Unfortunatly, the skimpy manual I received with the monitor only has 
general information for their complete range of monitors, nothing 
specific to the 1440.
Thanks again for your help.  I guess I will have to try once again to 
contact the company, if they haven't merged and changed their name 
or gone under by now. 
-<BUD>-
 
The millennium is coming, Live, Love and be happy.

I had a multiscan only last year,I found it far better to ignore multiscan
mode completely, and put Super72, or DBLpal in your devs/monitors drawer.
Available (still I hope) at aminet.

Learn to live with it. I'm afraid that multiscan pushes AGA to its limits,
with having to refresh the screen at about double the rate of PAL: hi-res.
This is one of the reasons why people spend lots on nice, fast graphics
cards.

Multiscan is much slower than PAL.  Any modes that show as more than "15KHz"
in ScreenMode are.

Something important to consider is the number of colours.  In PAL, 256 colours
can be /just/ about usable - in MultiScan Productivity everything slows to a
crawl in 64 colours.

ECS = Enhanced chipset, the chips in the A500+, A3000, some A500s and A2000
and others.

AGA (in the A1200, A4000) is the next step up from ECS.

Well, this is something you'll see on any graphics hardware, but with the
built-in Amiga modes you have to remember that they are more designed for
PAL/NTSC applications.  Multiscan was just something put in 'because it could
be done'.

The problem is that multiscan is something like 4 times more demanding of the
chips than PAL.  The solutions are to stick to PAL, reduce the number of
colours in multiscan, or get a graphics card (all of which feature much faster
graphics chips).

The only reason for doing this is cos im a skin flint & dont want to waste ink

I don't know if Ww loading is slow cos I use Final Writer, (just tried it -
It took 10 seconds to start FW then choose and load a letter). 

I just thought I'd let you know how I have my A1200 set up. you might like to try
doing the same thing. I also have a Microvitec multiscan monitor. I found a better
monitor driver for Super 72 Hi Res Interlaced. I use 800x600 in 64 colours for Workbench. I don't need a
flicker fixer gizmo, the display is rock steady and comfortable and not too
slow with 64 colours. If anyone wants a copy of this driver let me know.

BTW I have an 040/40 accelerator and 32Mb ram.

85. I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly

    then activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse.'' Instead it
    will be more along the lines of ``Push the button.''

Has anyone else tried HighGFX from AmiNET? I use it for a lot of stuff
on my A1200 and it doesn't seem all that slow here. It does flicker a
bit, but that's not a problem for me. It goes all the way up to 256
colors and supports HAM8 and screen dragging, of course.

I have two printers connected.  I am using the two ports on my 
Hypercom and the parallel port.  One of the Hypercom cables 
and the parallel port cable goes to a switch box so I can still use
them both.  I have one old program that demands to use the 
parallel port thus the strange setup.  But it works fine.

When you start printer preferences you select the printer name and
the port.  If you use the Hypercom port you will need to check the
Use custom device gadget..  When it is set up the way you want it,
save it.   You can do this by just clicking the save gadget.  If you
do this you will need to restart the prefs program (I think) since
it exits after saving.  Or, you can use the saveas option.  This is a
little more involved than you may want to know about.  If you
do let me know.  You are probably better off just clicking on the
save button and restarting the program.  

Then for the next printer setup, click on the Printer Device Unit 
gadget at the top of the printer prefs window and choose unit 1 
(or any other unit).  Go through the same setup as before and save it.   

Now when you want to switch printers just start the prefs program,
select which printer you want to use by using the Printer Device
Unit gadget and then clicking on the use gadget.

Note that there is a bug in the prefes program that won't let you
set which printer to use via a cli command.  This is useful if you 
want to set up a DOpus button to switch printers with just a click.  
I reported the problem and was told it would be fixed with the next
Boing Bag release.

I hope this helps. 

Jack

Thanks, this is exactly what i wanted to know.

Would it not be possible to use a dosdriver mountlist to say set up a device
called PRT1: or whatever?
I havent got my sticky mits on this second printer yet, so i have no way of
trying it at the moment, probably will by the end of the week.

Thanks again for your help.

Mick.

Subject: [just-amiga] A4000 batteries
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


Right, I've tried to replace the battery on my A4000T with a battery from a
PC, but it appears to be soldered on (it's a button battery! how could they do
this to me?).  Not only that, but they're different batteries anyway (I
thought perhaps it was standardised).

Could anyone please point me to a step-by-step guide to replacing it or
connecting a battery to the pinouts below it.  Same for an A4000D too.  What I
really need is known part numbers so I get the right things to solder on.

Hi Neil,

the battery can be obtained from Radiospares, I`ve changed mine twice, =
you have to remove the motherboard from the case and de-solder the old =
one, the new one needs to be solered in place. The battery has 3 tags on =
it and it is polarised, so it will only fit one wat on the board.

It`s a lithium coin cell type 2330, the rs part no is 597-368 and its =
price is =A32.43 + vat. You may be able to obtain this from Maplin as =
well.

If you need one the I can get you one and post it off to you.

John

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Dear Amiga Lovers,
   I have an Amiga A600HD computer which I hope to use during a tour
of Europe, including Bulgaria.
   I know that I may have to step down the voltage from 220 to 110
volts.  I have an adapter with which to do that.
   The computer is used to generate interval tones for our harmonic
keyboard.  The A600 generates specific-frequency, sine-wave tones.
   My question is:
      Will my A600HD run correctly with 50-cycle electricity?

   Thank you, in advance, for your wisdom on this subject.
      
     Bless You with Divine Inspiration,
       The Robert Part of Our Creator

No, that's an all-inclusive price, for a period of two years.  After that, =
the
renewal fee would be another 35 UKP, again for a period of two years.

I don't think that Freeserve do or, at least, if they do, they may well cha=
rge
you for doing so.  RedHotAnt do, and if you've bought the Advanced or
Superior options, it's included in the price.

If all that you want is web space within your own domain, with no fancy bel=
ls
or whistles, then a combination of Easily and RHA is a good, cost-effetctiv=
e
way to go.  That's the route that I went, so I'm probably a bit biased B-)

For the 35 squids (or a tenner, if you go for a *.co.uk* address), Easily w=
ill
redirect calls to either your domain name or e-mail address, to any account
of your choice.  They will also point your domain to someone else's name
servers (as they did for me, with RHA), or they will transfer the name to a=
n
ISP of your choice.  As I said, that's all inclusive of the original purcha=
se
price;  there are no hidden transfer fees, for example.

Eddie

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello j-a Egroups,
Many thanks for help re screen modes 08-05-00 from:
            Neil Ives
            Alan Paynter
            Neil Williams
            Sandy Brownlee 

I don't know if Ww loading is slow cos I use Final Writer, (just tried it -
It took 10 seconds to start FW then choose and load a letter). Neil Ives

/Sounds like FW a bit faster. The example I used was long winded, using/
/several screens on the way - wanted that for easier to time. /

I found it far better to ignore
>multiscan mode completely, and put Super72, or DBLpal in your
>devs/monitors drawer. Available (still I hope) at aminet.
Alan Paynter

/Found I had those drivers. Super 72 worked out best/

Something important to consider is the number of colours.  In PAL, 256
colours
can be /just/ about usable - in MultiScan Productivity everything slows to a
crawl in 64 colours.
 Neil Williams

/Reducing the number of colours from 256 to 64 had a lot more effect than /
/changing drivers/

Learn to live with it.
        Sandy
/Sorry you had to talk about refresh rates!! :-)  (re your mail to j-a last/
/week) /

Thanks again for all the info. Its not a perfect world but its starting to
make sense. I now know
what I am doing in this area of the Amiga.

Regards
Joe

   Yes.


If you're using a telly, it may not support NTSC (or pal, whichever way round you're doing it), so you may need to go into the early startup, press a key to change it, and then in display options change the default screen.

You're not totally clear though; do you have a 110v/60Hz A600?

This may be a problem depending on the program used: basically, keep the

Most TVs and monitors handle both.

 RMF>    My question is:

Erm. I defer. On the A2000/A500 there are switches on the motherboard to set
the system to run with 50 or 60Hz supplies, but I don't know if that affects
the /usability/ of the machine or just the genlocking capability (which
depends on accurate timing).

I don't think so but I have never tried it.  When you are entering the
command I mentioned above you are just running the printer prefs
program with various arguments.

Subject: [just-amiga] Spam, my story :(
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi All,

Just thought i'd tell my interesting spam story, its not
too long but its really p**s annoying.

Last sunday i got more than a bit annoyed at receiving
emails from a

k@pcuk.co.uk

I had never asked to receive them and had been for a
long time so i reported it to,

abuse@pcuk.co.uk

THIS was my first mistake, i didn't think that they could
actually own the domain pcuk.co.uk and so emailing
abuse@pcuk.co.uk just sent the email to them. I got a
reply from a

alicia.<something>@pcuk.net

<somthing> is the surname that I can't remember. The
reply was telling me the users account had been closed
etc.

With that email I received two emails saying i'd sign
up on two different sites, which i can assure you I
hadn't, this week I have receivied about 8-10 more
for different websites that I've never even visited,
nor wish to probably. Luckily most require me to reply
to confim my subscription, but still, I am now being
targetted.

Now you could say anyone is targetting me, but when I
wrote to abuse@pcuk.co.uk I only used my first name and
ALL the subscriptions to the sites are ONLY signed up
with the name "Chris", no surname or anything which is
why it makes me 100% sure that it is these same people
donig this to me.

A mistake the "person" made is when they signed up on
some sites the IP of the person who signed up was
emailed to me with the confimation, and so a friend
who will remain nameless did a scan on the IP and found
it is a dynamic or static IP belonging to a customer
on NTL (the cable company) internet provider, in the
United Kingdom and so this links in with the pcuk.co.uk
as it being a uk address.

I am going to report this all to my ISP but if anyone
has any suggestions or help otherwise, then i'd be
MOST thankful.

Toodle Pip!

G'Day Chris and all others

The way I handle spam is to report it all at this site:-

  http://spamcop.net/

When you get there read all the conditions and click on:-

  I understand and agree

Then a bit more to read and enter your e-mail address. No worries there
- they are legit.

Then they send you your own personal URL reporting adress. Bookmark it.
You then go to that URL every time you want to report spam.

All it takes is to copy the whole spam e-mail (including ALL headers)
into a form on the page and click on "PROCESS SPAM"

Their system analyses the spam and comes up with a number of address to
which reports will be sent. NOT JUST ONE ADDRESS!! They show all
addresses to which report is sent

Then you click on SEND SPAM REPORTS and away they go.

All very simple and I get the feeling that I am getting less spam since
I started doing this! (But maybe that is just my imagination)

In the case you talk about, I think that:-

  pcuk.co.uk

would be hosted by some other ISP and SPAMCOP would ferret out that ISP
and report it to them, not just to pcuk.co.uk

I read the other post on spamcop.net which sounds like a very interesting
prospect that I'm considering trying, but what I've been doing until now is
this...

NEVER reply to the spam mails you get.  If your reply actually gets to a
live mail box then you are just letting the spammer know that somebody
reads the mail at the address he just spammed.

View the header of the offending message.  You should see something like
this somewhere in the header:

from myrop (AC8E6AFC.ipt.aol.com [172.142.106.252]) by
amhotsv01.amhot.co.jp...

This is out of a message with a reply to of "ielauty@calvacom.fr"

What has happened is the spammer is using an AOL dialup account to send
messages through an smtp server in the amhot.co.jp domain.  In this case
sending a message to "abuse@aol.com" might fix it, but I never actually
have heard a reply from them before.  Other ISP's are much better about it
and will give you a status as they nail the spammer.

Many times it's not always this easy as spammers will sometimes use an smtp
server with a "HELO localhost" in which case you'll never find out who sent
it. because you won't find the originating IP address.

I'm sure that's a great site. However, for those who prefer an email
interface, please have a look at www.abuse.net. Once you sign up, you can send
mail to site@abuse.net, where site is the name of the site you wish to report.
Example: pcuk.co.uk@abuse.net. In the message body I usually include about 2
lines with "The following mail was sent to me, and I consider it spam. Please
take appropriate action.", followed by the original mail (with headers!). Then
abuse.net will send the mail along to whatever addresses will be appropriate
(probably including abuse@pcuk.co.uk if they've never heard of that site
before, since abuse@site is the default).

But remember to send your mail to many sites (as in site@abuse.net,
site2@abuse.net), actually to every site you find in the Received: lines in
the mail headers.

My experience of abuse.net is that it works great.

G'Day Linus et al

The thing I like about SpamCop is that it decides on a number of address
to which to send the report.

For example, one I am doing right now was:-

  From:     success@freeinet.com
  Reply to: starluckcasino@mail.com

But Spamcop made out reports to be sent to the folloiwng four addresses,
none of which appear at first glance to be related to freeinet.com:-

     Spam Recycling Center
                                                   
src@admin.spamcop.net
     Source of email
                                                    abuse@mindspring.net
     fire41@bigfoot.com - Email host
                                                    abuse@bigfoot.com
     http://www.starluckcasino.com/slcasino/links/4540.... - Web host
                                                   
jcrescenzi@colosseum.com

which makes me think that just sending it to abuse@freeinet.com may not
work!!

OK, I'll try sales@antigravity.com again, later.

The reason I wanted to deal direct with GVP was they claimed to have
the RAM board I wanted, they were cheaper by far than anywhere else,
and most importantly I expected proper support and no lies regarding
compatibility with my Series 1 accelerator. A sydney computer store
told me bare faced lies about the RAM board I asked for.

Another reason is of all the suggested sites to go to, www.softhut.com
included, of those that bothered to reply, (2 from memory) none had the
board in question, either new or secondhand, or knew where to get same.

Regarding GVP, at this time I've sent 8 (yes, eight) emails to them.
Three to each address on their Web site and 2 snail-mails, the last 
one by airmail included an international return mail coupon, I'm not
sure what the correct name is, and a self addressed envelope. 

They just don't want a sale, and I find their attitude ignorant in
the extreme. Why have a bloody Web site with addresses all over the
place if one is arrogantly going to ignore potential customers?

Someone answered me making excuses for the poor, hard working Mike
and his partner, who, out of the goodness of their heart, are keeping
GVP going while holding down an outside job. What utter bullshit!!
the only reason they are involved with GVP is to make money, or to
piss off potential customers, otherwise, why bother?

Dear Amiga Lovers,
   What is the best application program for imputting text into
an Amiga by voice?  I am interested in dictating text into a file
rather than voice control of the computer's functions.

     Bless You with Divine Inspiration,

I had a 1960 till a few months ago   :-(

This monitor will not show a pal screen ( high res ) very well ( it is
ghosted & distorted ) but will show screens on my PPC/Bv ok 

it is not listed in the cyber gx  list of monitors .

Subject: [just-amiga] Font Questions
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings Amigans...


I  have some questions regarding fonts. This is a bit longwinded, so,
please bear with me.

The  problem  was  brought  home  to  me when I recently attempted to
install  a different font caching utility than the one I'd been using
for  some  years.  It failed to work because it was looking for a dir
called `_bullet' in my Fonts: assign to write the fontcache file to.

When  I copied this dir along with `_bullet_outlines' from my back-up
partition,  it started working correctly. (So far, anyway.) These two
directories have never been in my Fonts: dir since I got the A1200.

At present I have the normal assigned Fonts: directory, plus some add
assigns for fonts stored on another partition. These assigns all work
correctly and all fonts in the multiple assigns are listed and can be
used in all programs that I use regularly, eg., paint programs and so
forth. The following is a truncated version of my setup:

Directory WORKBENCH:Fonts/

  Courier                (sub-dir)
    Courier.font            (in root of WORKBENCH:Fonts)
    Courier.metric          (as above - but no sub-dir)

  Helvetica              (sub-dir)
    Helvetica.font          (in root of WORKBENCH:Fonts)
    Helvetica.metric        (as above - but no sub-dir)

  Times                  (sub-dir)
    Times.font              (in root of WORKBENCH:Fonts)
    Times.metric            (as above - but no sub-dir)

To  the best of my knowledge, the above have been in my Fonts: assign
since I've had the A1200 with OS3.0 along with the normally installed
and added fonts and their associated sub-dirs.

What I need to know is, what purpose do the 3 .metric files serve, as
to my knowledge, I have not been able to use them?

Should there be some sort of assign? If so, I've never seen one.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are also in the root of WORKBENCH:Fonts and have no
associated sub-directory.

    CGTriumvirate.otag
    CGTriumvirate.font
    CGTimes.otag
    CGTimes.font

What purpose do these 4 files serve? Once again, I don't believe I've
ever been able to use them.

PLEASE  NOTE:  There are Triumvirate sub-dir and Triumvirate.font and
as  mentioned above, Times and Times.font files in the Fonts: assign,
but no `CGwhatever' sub-dirs.

Do  the  above  have  something  to  do with the newly added sub-dirs
below? These have the following files in them...

Directory WORKBENCH:Fonts/_bullet

    hq3.fnt                 (all inside the _bullet sub-dir)
    hq3updt.tyq
    if.fnt
    if.uc
    plugin.types

Directory WORKBENCH:Fonts/_bullet_outlines

    CGTimes.type            (all inside the _bullet_outlines sub-dir)
    CGTriumvirate.type
    LetterGothic.type
    OctaMED.type

The  above  do  not have any assign associated to them either. Should
they have one?

The  only  fonts I have no problems with are Bitmap and the type used
by FinalWriter. (Adobe, NimbusQ - I think.) My version 4.02 of FW has
never  given  me  a  single problem using these (vector ?) fonts, the
ones  with  the  .pfb  postfix,  and  the internal FW libs/files have
allowed  me  to add many fancy fonts from Aminet that work absolutely
transparently  with FW. Though, with only 6Mb of memory, I am limited
on how many pages (and fonts) I can use.

The A1200 manuals are sadly lacking in information on the above, and,
despite my prolific reading on Compugraphic and other types of fonts,
(eg., Truetype) I have no idea what I should be doing to access these
add-on fonts.

Any  information  on the above, or pointing me in the right direction
of some dox that may help, would be greatly appreciated.  TIA.

Tehy are there so that you can crerate fonts of various sizes
using any of the FontManager utilities.
The *.otag are what it looks for when creating these new fonts.
The www.v3.com site (VaporWare Site) has a new link to fonts. The creator 
wrote the documents sop you could use IBM-PC fonts with V-NG. Try it and 
see.

Also works great with iBrowse2.2. 

FWIW I have the _Bullets and _Bullets_Outlines in the same directory as my
CGFonts. I keep my fonts seperated my type. My main FONTS: assign points to
Sys:Fonts/BitMappedFonts with additions "ADD"s for Sys:Fonts/CGFonts,
Sys:Fonts/PS_Type_1, and Sys:Fonts/True_Type_Fonts. For the most part it all
works. A few of my TTF fonts aren't recognised though they do show up in
font requestors. I could probably do it simpler, but this is my method. I
hope the original poster finds his answer.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello All.
         Anyone help with a "Self Inflicted" Problem? I have an old Pal
monitor (Acorn) which i have happily been using for the past 4 years (can't
afford any thing better at the Moment) I have been using almost the
standard Workbench (3.0) running on a "SuperHires" screen. Now I was quite
happy with this set-up, But found an old version of Magic Workbench on a CD
and thought I wouuld try and "Spruce" thing up a little.

                                    <Bad Mistake>

Regardless of how much I tried, I could only get a reasonable viewing screen
using "Superhires interlaced" However this suffered from so much
"flickering" and the fonts were so small that I couldn't read any text.

So I had to "TRY" to un-install the version of Magic Workbench ....(not the
easiest task I have ever undertaken :(

I have the Workbench *almost* back to normal (With the exception of the
"Workbench Drawer" whish is distorted and coloured Blue/Green & White. Also
if I try to switch from "Superhires" to "Hires Interlaced" For using the
internet ...The screen changes to a Total Blue Background (Screen &
Windows) with black text. (although the web pages display ok)

I have "racked" my Brains and tried everything I can think of to rectify
this problem ....But sadly failed!

Anyone suggest something or had the same experience.

Thanks in advance for any assistance given.

P.S. the random tagline says it all ;)



Best

Actually, I think MagicWB is great, but it does like a proportional
resolution.

What about MagicTV? Or are you using too many colours?

If you just comment out the two long MWB lines, one in startup.sequence,
and the other in user-startup, it should totally disable MWB and return
things to normal.  Did you try that?

I went there today.. It's called TTF Guide. It addresss' the fonts for
V-NG, but you can use the guide for all your font needs.

   Ok, I'm still not sure how MWB can be causing you so much problem, as it's only replacement Icons.  Although, you say you were running you workbench in superhires??? 1280x256???  uch! thats a 4x1 proportion screenmode!  You really should be using a 1x1 screenmode.

If you want MWB, all you need is a little program called, 'MagicColour' I think (to sort the palette out) and you really should be running your workbench in hires-laced (640x512). 

   Of course, if you don't like the MWB look, try 'NewIcons' instead:)

   And if you don't like Interlaced, MWB will still look fine in hires. (but you really shouldn't use superhires modes, they eat chipram speed.)

See ya :)

Put it on it's own screen then,  that way you have the entire

Well normally I use a 64 colour WB screen but reducing it to 4/8 colours
made no difference, In fact it seemed worse! As I said for some reason MWB
would only give a reasonable display in Superhires Interlaced running at
the Full 256 colour mode. Apart from the fact that this was almost
impossible to read because of the small text and flicker it also "Ate" up a
lot of chip Ram, Hense the reason I had to try and un-install it :(

Again I thought that would be easy! and it did work for the "Ram Disk" icon,
but for some stupid unknown reason the WB Drawer refuses to return to
normal, I have tried replacing it (Icon edit and Dragging a new icon in  to
the Info screen) I even tried re-drawing the Soding thing in icon edit..But
it keeps going back to the Distorted Blue/Green/White thing :(

Notice your from AberdeenShire ( Land of my birth :) well the name says it
all ;)
Ever been in "Cruden Bay"? I stayed there for 6 years :)

Fortunately I tend to back-up my "S" Drawer after installing any new
programs, And I had just re-installed "Kingcon" a week prior ...So I
simpley replaced the whole "S" drawer.....I did thnk that this would get
rid of MWB and it seemed to help apart from the annoying problems with the
switching of screen modes and the WB Drawer icon. :(

It has been a while since I formatted my drives but two thoughts come
to mind.  First, be sure you are using pfs2ds instead of pfs2 for the area
greater than 4 meg?   And second, be sure you are doing a quick format
instead of a full format?    Hope this helps.

Yeah! I'm an "Oddball" :) .... Sadly can't afford a Decent monitor ATM. So
stuck with this old Pal thing. Problem is that the standard "High Res" is
so big that it leaves little room to work on the Workbench screen. "high
Res Laced" is OK but the "Flicker" bugs the old eyes to much!
Super Hi-res provides a nice sized screen with no flicker and easily
readable text, Combined with FBlit I can run it at 128 colours and still
have in excess of 1.5 meg of chip Ram left ( and yes I do have a Back Pic
on Workbench ;)

Don't want MWB ...In fact the CD is now lying somewhere in a Field about 500
yards from my house (Makes a great frisbee ;)

Tried Newicons but it seemed to eat up Chip Ram worse that my Screenmode :(

Call me fussy ;) Hate "hires screenmode"

There is something else you have to set in OS 3.5 to make it work beyond
4 gigs, but I don't remember what -- anyone know?

MagicTV is a program that seriously reduces interlace flicker, but it only
works on screens up to 16 colours.

Also, you could try increasing font size to make things more readable.

Dunno why that would be. Is it the disk.info on WB, or is it a drawer info
somewhere? Have you checked that you're saving the icon as the right type?

Not recently. Last time was a couple of years ago- decent place, amd not
quite as small as where I stay. (New Deer- know where that is?)   :-)


Sooner,

        Sandy, maybe this week...

Hi Ian

I found a drawer of MWB extras in my A1200 (started withbog-standard min
config given to me by a relative 'moving on...? to 486:-) and am
collecting goodies as I go along)  Had some interesting moments in this
area. I haven't got a MWB install prog which may have prefs etc - just
imported icons to iconedit.

Pretty icons all change colors when apps progs run...even prettier!! had to
make screen 256 colours to stabilise them, then everything slows to
near-stall if wbackdrop+music+application prog. Using multiscan
productivity is part responsible and other modes better but number of
colours main prob.

More trouble after installing organiser EO2?? (found at aminet). When I
dragged windows across the screen they left residual debris behind,
obscuring everything eventually.   EO2 refused to be de-installed. when I
tried to delete it it always said 'object in use'. I found it had put time
prefs in WBStartup aand launched itself when I booted 
Some places I went to get rid of these probs:
Boot amiga up with L&R mouse buttons held down - goes to early start screen.
(avoids WBStartup)  Use cd and dir commands in the shell window to have a
look whats in where.  If you not amigaDos wizz - i certainly not-u can go
back to WB to remove anything you find wrong. think loadWB command (?) will
take you there without reboot.
Have a look at startup-sequence and user-startup (ed s:start...xxx...)
Disable with CAUTION, partic in startup-sequence,;-) any lines that refer
to MWB or whatever by putting ; at start of line.
Reduce screen colurs/resolution
After doing it the hard way I found DOpus makes life easier by miles.

...Sadly the Drawer icon
>ICF has now been replaced by a Disk symbol ...                             
Is it a drawer in a window or a 'drawer type' disk icon in Workbench ?

Use Iconedit to change it: select the correct drawe or disk option from
types menu
select 'open' from project menu - choose a xxx.info file to import to
Icoedit.  select saveas from project menu. select the icon you want to
change. 

Sounds like your "Disk symbol" is a default icon.  to change these go to
'save as default icon' in project menu.  dont forget the 'type'
>ICF  But at least it is usable :)  
Who dares wins:-))))
Hope i not boring you stupid or insulting intelligence. Its just the route I
took.
Regards
Cally

Colors.  I used a program off Aminet called FullPalate to recolor the
MWB icons on OS 3.5.  I must warn you it is a bitch to use in more than
16 colors, but going back to my ECS NTSC workbench and resetting the
colors at 16 worked, and the settings held when I went back to 256
colors at 800x600x8.  I also set the WB to 800x600x16, and the changes
still held there -- that is the MWB icons still looked ok.  That might
help if not solve your problem.  I don't run MWB on OS 3.5, BTW.

OS2.0-3.5 comes with CompuGraphic Outline fonts (CGTimes, CGTriumvirate, and
Lettergothic) and the outline font manager "Intellifont". If you install the
ttf.library for TrueType Fonts it comes with a font manager called
"ttfmanager", and last but not least, type1.library for PS Type 1 fonts
comes with "t1manager".

Yeah! I've tried MagicTV but still didn't like the Interlaced screen to much
:(

TRied just about everything ....I have now managed to get rid of the
"Squashed Bug" effect for the Workbench Drawer ...Sadly the Drawer icon has
now been replaced by a Disk symbol ... But at least it is usable :)

Yeah, they only need to be in the Fonts: path. I simply put them in my
CGFonts directory since they deal with outline fonts and this was before I
started using the Type1 and TTF libs and fonts.

Hello Ian,

    I have installed a demo of MWB in the past and had some of the same
problems.  

    As for your monitor, I've never gotten to work with a pal so don't know
much about them.  Super hires always shows things super small i think...
and if you don't have aga or graphics card in only four colors.... If you
use MUI,  then try your screen mode hi-res lace (will flicker without
graphics card) remember to make the dimentions slightly wider than taller
and go into the MUI drawer and then the Goodies drawer and
click on
"Click for Colors" then go to your pallet and click on save ... now it won't
look the same when you reboot but it might clear up the icon color prob.

    Another thing in addition you might try is to go to the prefs dir and
then into the Env-Archive dir and delete any thing that says MagicWB

Is this similar to 3-2-8? (ie, remaps the blue/red/green type icons caused
by differing MWB versions to the nice MWB gradient) Or does it convert the
MagicWB icons to GlowIcons?

I do, but slowly it is getting superceded by Glowicons. Especially in the
next couple of weeks, when hopefully the BVision arrives.  :-)

Now you just need to muck around with IconEdit. Do you you a replacement

Greetings All...

On 25 May 2000, I received a welcome mail from Heiko to the...

                      finalwriter@egroups.com

mailinglist informing me that I'd been added to HIS finalwriter group
at  eGroups  and that it was the "first and one and only Final Writer
Mailing List."

As  the  above  is patently not true, I thought I'd go to the eGroups
URL  in  this mail and check it out. When I got there, I was informed
that  I  was a guest, and when I tried to go anywhere I was told that
as a guest, I didn't have access to where I was trying to go.

I  sent  an  email  asking what the whole thing was all about, and at
this stage have not received a reply.

What's happened to the real, original mail list at...

                      finalwriter@thepentagon.com

Is  this  now  dead  and has Heiko taken over and moved us to the new
site?  Has  anyone else received this email, and, do they know what's
going on?

OK...  I'll  bite,  how does one find the TTF.guide, or anything else
for that matter, on this site? It seems to have no search options and
many links to oddly named sites such as:   go.to, where.are, look.at,
etc., etc.

It's the most user un-friendly site I've ever been to.  TIA.

Go into Dopus, use select #?.info ,use "delete" all. Select all
directories, click "add icon"! There, that better now ?

Hello, Ian.


You wrote at 30-Mai-00 concerning "*[just-amiga] Re: Any Suggestion Welcome!*":

Are you sure that installing MWB is the reason for that?
I have been using MWB icons for years now, because I like them, but
never saw a connection between MWB and the selection of screenmodes.

How much fast ram do you have? Have you tried FBlit? It makes the system use
fast ram instead of chip ram for graphics.

All you really have to do is to comment them out, but deleting would be
better if you know you don't wnt to go back to it.  This should do it,
but it won't get rid of the Icons.  I have the things on my OS 3.5
machine, which has never had MWB on it, because the programs were
installed with them by default.  Worse, the colors were messed up and I
had to use FullPallate to fix them.  That may be his problem with the
WB Icon.

You're right.  If it's a file, the easiest place to find it would be in
downloads, but you may have to check more than one country as different
countries have some variation in the files they cary.  First goround I
had to go to Germany to find Voyager 3.2 and ist plugins.  The next
night they were finally on the US site.

Yeah! I've managed to almost get everything back to normal :) The only
problem remaining is I can use *any screenmode* in anything more than 32
colours. If I try to go beyond 32 colours the screen just locks up and i am
forced to reboot :(

Do you think this FBlit might work on say SequencerOne+ that uses chip ram
for the samples. Or does it just focus on graphics?  SeqOne may be

Now that I think of it though, even with fblit, this could be a chip ram
limitation.  Not everything goes to fastram afterall.  Still, even with
AGA, you ought to be able to manage 64 colors.  What's running in the
background?

Not positive M8 ...But prior to installing MWB ...I often switched to HiRes
Laced (Full colour) for web browsing. In an attempt to get rid of Magic
Work bench I have installed "Newicons" so I suppose it could be that
causing the screen colour selection problems.

Got the drawer back now :) Only got a problem that I can use a screen with
more than 32 colours without the "miggie" Freezing up on me ( Oh! and
another strange one! The prefs drawer in WB is the size of a standard
"Keyhole" Dragging it out "Clean up" and Snapshot makes no difference, it
just goes back to the Keyhole after a re-boot)

Hey! I forgot you were on this list ....Gave me quite a shock there ;)

'Am looking for help/advise - I've just, well yesterday, bought an
A2000 from a car-boot(=A310). It's a rev' 6.2 board, non up-graded, with
a card carrying a hard drive and what looks like 4meg' of Ram, plus
the front panel from an A1500 with it's two floppy drives. So far all
I've done is powered it up, the power supply, hard drive and one
floppie seem to work.('t other one's missing a jumper)

I think my main question is - do I now expand the A2000, or my
A1200 030/50 34meg?

The *first* thing you need to do is change the clock battery...
Second,  lubricate the rails in the disk drive/s.

Then,  see if you can pick up a GVP  board from somewhere.
Try here.....   http://amibench.org    for  a used one....

Have fun....

I do not know. I think it is only for graphics operations. I have never used
it since I have a graphics card, but many people without one seem to like
it, and it is still being developed.

OK! Your mail got me thinking :) I totally disabled my WBstartup drawer
...Then tried rebooting ....WoooHooo! all the Newicons displayed in the
correct colours & I could easily switch from Superhires to an Interlaced
screen using full colour (And the interlaced screen didn't come out that
horrible blue colour)

I then tried re-installing all the little patches one&one and continually
testing the Icons & Screenmodes.

I discovered that both "Autorun" & "Tools Dameon" when installed caused the
screen to lock up if switched. :)

Workbench now working properly again <Phew> I did use the Tools Dameon quite
a bit, but as I have "Netconnect" installed, I just have to move my Fav.
programs to the Menu Bar.

Thanks for the "Suggestion" and to all who have responded over the past few
days.

A Happy Ferret once again :)

*CLIPS*:       

If you havn't assigned it to ram:clips   in your S-S 
then it must be picking it up from the old default
location   devs:clipboards   directory.

It is not used these days,  clips are put in clips: assignment,
but I am not sure if it still checks in there, 
if clips:  is empty,  probably still does. ?

Same thing goes for the old devs:Mountlist file,  
it's not used anymore as all the mountable device entries 
are put in devs:Dosdrivers,  however,  "Mount" will 
still look for/in it, if it can't find it in the dosdrivers drawer.

Isn't backwards compatibility wonderfull..... (:/

Hang on a bit. Stefan, you say that *when you turn on your Amiga* you
press Amiga-V and it pastes the above text in, right? Do you mean that
you're pressing those keys during boot-up?

If this is the case, this is enlightening for me, as it means that the
Amiga is already using the clipboard *during the boot process* as that
is where anything that gets pasted by the Amiga-V combination comes
from---the clipboard (in most Amigas this is RAM:clipboards/). Why it
would do that is beyond me at the moment. :)
