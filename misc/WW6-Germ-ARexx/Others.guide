   I have written some other little ARexx-programs for Wordworth. Some people will write these
   things for themselves, but maybe they are of help for some of you. I haven't translated all
   of them, sorry.

   @{"WW-Print              " link Druck}  -  Print several documents one after another

   Overview over the pre-defined colours of WW. (WW 3.0.-Document and ARexx-Script)
