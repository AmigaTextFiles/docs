The BeBox: A Technical Summary

The BeBox 

Moving beyond the limitations of today's computing architectures.

The BeBox(TM) from Be, Inc. combines supercharged hardware, an innovative
new operating system, and a host of powerful sound, graphics, and video
capabilities -- all at an extremely affordable price.  It's the first true
real-time system that features multiple processors, preemptive
multitasking, fast I/O, and a wide range of expansion options.

The BeBox allows you to run multiple high-performance, graphics-intensive
programs, synchronize music and sound, view and edit videos, and access the
Internet -- all at the same time.  It features a built-in database that's
always accessible, so you can continually store, retrieve, and update key
information from multiple sources.  No other product on the market can
equal its performance in its price range.  It's a system that has already
excited developers and is capturing the imagination of a wide spectrum of
computer users.
