Project Walker

Specifications;

CPU

	68EC030 40Mhz (Proto 25Mhz while custom chip 'Tony' a PLA/GAL')
        Space for FPU. Could be socket or FPU as standard in production unit.

SUPPORT

	Real time clock as standard
	Hard drive as standard (size depending on market when manufactured)
	CD (Quad Speed) as standard
	Billed as 1MB CHIP RAM + 4MB of FAST as standard. Likely to be 2+4.

ASSORTED

	PCB currently 6 layers but expected to reduce to 4 and footprint
	to be reduced noticably. Rectangular optimised PCM layout is far
	cheaper to product.
	Return to dial in-line socketted 8520 CIAs even at greater cost.
	PCMCIA in prototype but expected to be dropped for production unit.

EXPANSION

	Standard multicontroller PC style IO chip. Exact model undecided since
	they are largely similar to include in the design and program.

	Features; EPP Parallel port, High speed serial port, E-IDE port used
		  for CD-ROM and hard drives, Floppy controller * See note.

	* Floppy Controller is obviously capable of full speed (not half spin)
	HD floppy disk access but this provides a delima in how to support
	existing hardware illegal DD floppy access. Some sort of electronic
	switching is being considered as well as a physical switch/cable
	relocation to move between the new controller and the standard Paula
	based interface. A change in the HD Amiga floppy architecture is also
	planned.

OS

	Currently V43.1, KS 3.2 will move to a set of 1MB chips which while
	AT aren't sure if it will be provided by THEMSELVES as an retro
	upgrade for existing machines (A3K/A4K and A1200 can take 1MB ROMs
	apparently) they are open to a 3rd party deal at the least.

	Contains mainly bug-fixes and small enhancements like the removal
	of the 2GB limit from FFS.

	CDFS revamped and bug-fixed to function with Scala etc and obviously
	the new E-IDE interface.

SLOTS

	There's one slot located dead center in the motherboard. However it's
	split into two sections so that it may house 2 cards if needs be.
	The exact details on the signals and purpose of each half weren't
	finalised or available but basically one can surmise that one is a
	CPU slot and the other a video slot. Signals will be duplicated so
	that different cards could function.

	Amiga Technologies WILL MARKET THEIR OWN PPC UPGRADE! Though it was
	developed in conjuncton with Phase 5, AT will provide the upgrade
	which will contain a new OS on-board and such forth. PPC603 based.

	If it's not obvious, it's possible in theory to plug in a GFX board
	in the video half and a 680x0 based accelerator in the CPU half. It's
	not clear if the PPC card will need both or just the CPU slot.

	Another major application could be to make a Zorro and/or PCI break
	out board from this slot. No, there are NO Zorro or PCI slots as
	standard though the physical nature of the slot is PCI style.

	An additional small 'IO' slot is being considered. 3rd party simple
	hardware projects such as a networking facility, extra serial ports
	or a sampler could be used with this as well as home made projects
	conceivably. This isn't decided, just considered at this time.

CASE	
	Yes it's a vacuum cleaner. :-) Seriously the only way to describe it
	is with a picture and I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Interesting
	AT say that the hood could be raised by spacers and such forth to make
	more room internally for a bus board for cards etc.

TIMEFRAME

	AT say that the design will be finalised in the Summer ready for
	production. It's not decided of Solectron will be the manufacturers.
	The production unit should be available in the 'Fall' for the Christmas
	Season.

NOTES/AUTHOR

	I'm the techical staff writer for CU Amiga Magazine. This information
	is important enough to release publically immediately though more
	details, details (very) pictures and interviews with the AT design
	team will feature in the next issue. <sorry for the plug>

FINAL

	The name 'Walker' is not the production name! Therefore we call it
	Project Walker. The name is undecided and Amiga Technologies have
	decided to run a competition for the name of the unit! This
	competition will be run through our magazine. Both by writing in to
	the standard address and E-mailing walker-compo@cu-amiga.demon.co.uk
	Just state your name in the body of the mail. That's all that's required
	, if you win I'll be in touch via E-mail to sort out the prize/s.

	Prizes; 1st Amiga Surf Pack, 2nd Amiga Magic Pack.

AFTERWORD

	I don't know about you but I dig this machine from the bottom of my
	heart. It's made me feel better about the future of the Amiga. It's
	a step in what I believed was the right direction.

	Three cheers for AT! 

Later,
