                            (The what, why and hows)

                            Version 1.20 release 1.2
                                Updated: 19.5.95



                       --==>> What exactly is USG? <<==--

     USG is a non-profit organisation of users and developers who are
    willing to support and aid in the development of high quality software
    and standards.  As such, USG and USG-Net will help developers with ideas
    to make their product better, and to encourage them to actually release
    their products.  USG will also help with suggestions, tips, technical
    details, and to provide betatesters for these products.  Developers
    connected to USG-Net will also find it useful to set up their own echo,
    which will provide them with even more help in finding the "right way"
    for their product.  USG-Net is explained in more detail in its own,
    introduction-text.


                   --==>> What are the goals with USG? <<==--

     USG's goal is simply to provide a stable base for developers to get
    their products tested and to provide the end-user with a simple way to
    let the developer know what they think of their product.  USG will try
    to help developers find suitable betatesters for their product.  USG
    will also act as quality-assurance for products.  Look for things like
    'Endorsed by USG', 'Supported by USG' and similar...


                             --==>> Why USG? <<==--

     Well, that is up to you.  If you have ever developed something, you
    might know the amount of work involved.  If you also have been busy
    betatesting it, you know that there is always one more bug.  USG will
    not do all the work for you, but should provide you with enough
    suggestions and tips to make it easier from the start.


                     --==>> Why should you join USG? <<==--

     As a developer, you should join to gain access to a wide variety of
    users and other developers.  Other developers could provide you with
    lots and lots of tips on 'how to'.  Betatesters finding that obscure bug
    noone would have found until after release.  Suggestions on how to do
    certain things.  These things can be the thing that gets a product
    released instead of scrapped.

     As a user, you should join USG to support the development of quality
    software and quality standards.  As a user, you can also take active
    part in the development of said software and standards.  You could be a
    betatester for someone, or maybe do some promotional work for a product
    you like.

     As a member of USG, your knowledge, thoughts and opinions can provide
    invaluable help for others, which is the main goal with USG.


                        --==>> How does USG work? <<==--

     USG as an organisation works by the rule that everyone is equal.  Major
    changes regarding USG will be a matter for all members.  For single
    developers, they will still have full control of their product.  USG
    will serve as a support organisation for the product, IF the developer
    wishes it.

     Practically, most contact is through USG-Net, FidoNet, AmigaNet or the
    InterNet.  USG-Net, the core of the developer support, is available to
    anyone, not just USG members.  But, to get full support and use of USG
    you will still have to become a member.  USG-Net is a growing net, but
    will try to be somewhat faster than existing nets, mainly by not
    concerning itself with non-development topics.  For more information on
    USG-Net, see the 'Introduction to USG-Net' text.

     At the time of writing, USG does not handle any registration issues,
    nor any distribution of your product, but maybe in the future.  This
    depends on the interest among members to take active part in the
    maintenance of USG as an organisation.
