0.  What can we expect from the Amiga community for multi-platform support?

    This is a temporary section added for the purpose of providing a context
    for the use of the material included in this FAQ.  Multi-platform support
    in the Amiga community can be divided into two categories.  First, there
    are companies which provide cross-platform software packages as commercial
    products, either as stand-alone utilities, or as support packages for
    emulators.  Respective examples are Consultron (CrossDOS/CrossMAC) and
    Utilities Unlimited (Emplant, 586PC).  Then there are the PD (publicly
    distributable) utilities and shareware.  Respective examples are PCDisk
    and MultiDOS.

    The commercial packages are usually self-contained and self-consistent.
    This means that the packages consist of two or more parts which have been
    designed to work together (thus they are compatible with each other and
    with AmigaDOS).  The publicly distributable and shareware codes are set
    up best as they possibly can to be compatible with AmigaDOS and to be
    co-compatible with other existing packages, such as PCTask or with the
    CBM Bridgeboard or perhaps even with ShapeShifter.  It usually becomes
    necessary for the commercial package producers to maintain firm control
    (in order to keep the workload on the support services lines at a sane
    level).  Thus, the use of commercial packages in combination with PD
    utilities is permissible only if you resolve not to call the product
    support line, given that you encounter unexpected problems.  For one
    thing, problems are what you should expect, and for another, the product
    support people don't have any information about the PD tools you're using.

    We can expect in the future, with the seemingly dispersed Amiga product
    leadership, that commercial products will move toward interfaces which
    are capable of recognizing the company drivers and handlers, and thus
    are also capable of xenophobic rejection of unfamiliar PD and shareware
    utilities.  The PD utilities will, on the other hand become more and more
    tailored to work with standardized static output from commercial packages
    and MSDOS, Macintosh or AmigaDOS data storage and retrieval systems.  For
    further information, see "COMPATIBILITY ISSUES" in section 7.
    
    Last but not least is the matter of parenthood for the AmigaDOS software
    itself.  As of this writing I do not yet see a dominant principality for
    the care and feeding of AmigaDOS.  We do have AmigaDOS 3.1x and we expect
    continued development for the operating system software.  However, since
    there is not a broad support base for the new OS versions in the US, this
    FAQ has not yet evaluated hardfile application techniques for AmigaDOS 3.1
    and higher.  Thus in the future, this FAQ will need to be significantly
    changed so as to have separate sections directed at specific commercial
    products for the new OS versions, and other sections for PD and shareware
    utilities, some of which are applicable only to older OS versions.

1.  What are "hardfiles" and why does anyone use them?

    Hardfiles are simulated hard disks; they are implemented through
    generation of an organized flat file representation of a hierarchical
    directory tree.  The folks who use hardfiles are those who don't
    have room for several dozen multi-OS hard drives in their desktop
    computer, for one thing.  For another thing, they are also people
    who cannot tolerate the agony of frequently repartitioning their
    hard drive into a myriad number of various odd-sized partitions.

2.  What are the advantages of hardfiles over partitions?

    Hardfiles are used rather than partitions because they are easy
    to generate and discard, and because they lend themselves to the
    application of simple, understandable file comparison and modification
    tools.  The consequences of a damaging action in a partition on a
    disk containing primary operating system tools and software is far
    greater than the consequences of damaging action in a directory full
    of hardfiles.  Also, hardfiles are very much less expensive than
    a hard disk farm, particularly where the data set consists of many
    small disks.

3.  What are the disadvantages of hardfiles?

    Hardfiles are slow.  Working with large hardfiles is more wearisome
    than other challenging activities, such as watching paint dry.  The
    tasks of generating, assigning, and mounting hardfiles are sometimes
    seemingly obscure, and the tools for generating and maintaining them
    are often pragmatically oriented toward some particular application,
    and thereby lack flexibility compared to less frequently used partition
    related tools.

4.  How can I can get faster disk transfers to and from my hardfiles?

    The AmigaDOS AddBuffers command works for any disk device, and thereby
    will speed up any file system that works by asking the device for sector-
    sized records.  A file system such as the PFS (from Aminet) that asks
    for larger amounts, such as multiple tracks, and then buffers these in
    its own allocated memory space will probably not be helped by the use
    of the AddBuffers command.  A buffer is only 512 bytes.  If you issue
    a command to AddBuffers 2000 you'll allocate enough RAM (1 Megabyte) to
    get good performance out of even an 80 Meg hardfile, so use about 1000
    buffers per 40 Meg of hardfile.  Use a command such as

    			AddBuffers HD1: 2000

    for the HFD directory (which in this case can be assigned to HD1:HFD).

5.  What utilities are available for use in generating hardfiles?

    Following is a list of some utilities used for generating hardfiles:

	Utility		    Applications	      Software / Drivers

	MakeAB		CBM Bridgeboard; Soft PCs	janus.library
	HardFileSetup	UU Emplant MacII Emulator	emphf.device
	Install		Consultron CrossDOS		filedisk.device
	Mount		AmigaDOS recoverable RADs	ramdrive.device
	various		DILLON File system devel/maint	any of the following:
			     FmsDisk hardfile		fmsdisk.device
			     Consultron CrossMAC	fmsdisk.device
			     Consultron CrossDOS	filedisk.device
			     CBM AmigaDOS hardfile	scsi.device

	Tool				Amiga Use

	Assign		-Amiga symbolic link generator
	Mount		-Amiga partition and general device mounting tool
	DJMount		-Mounts AmigaDOS format partitions within MSDOS disks
	Format		-Amiga general file system formatting tool

	Note:	Installation of CrossMAC/CrossDOS overwrites some AmigaDOS
		 commands, replacing them with versions having extended
		 capabilities which support CrossMAC and CrossDOS file systems.
		 If you have not purchased and installed Consultron's CrossDOS
		 and CrossMAC packages, invocations of the Format and DiskCopy
		 commands could produce results different than results shown
		 in this FAQ.

	Tool				MSDOS Use

	JLINK		-Mounts extendible MSDOS format Amiga hardfiles for BB
	FDISK		-MSDOS disk partitioning tool
	ADISK		-AmigaDOS disk partitioning tool for BB MSDOS drives

	Tool			     Bridgeboard Use

	AREAD		-Reads AmigaDOS files and writes them to MSDOS files
	AWRITE		-Writes MSDOS files to AmigaDOS partitions/directories

	Note: janus.library AND its icon must be placed in sys:Expansion
	      so as to automatically load the Bridgeboard autoboot code!!!

	FYI only, available partition file devices:

	PCDisk		Publicly Distributable MSDOS emulator partition manager
			-this is an _excellent_ partition manager which both
			 allows mounting an MSDOS file system for the emulator,
			 and also allows mounting the same partition on the
			 Amiga side (via the CrossDOSFileSystem).  You can get
			 simultaneous [but somewhat uncoordinated] disk access.
			 It's on Aminet Set 1 D (a four-disk set) filed as a
			 beta revision, ":Aminet/misc/emu/PCDisk91b.lha" there
			 may be a more current release, so check around...

	A-MaxII		Mac Plus emulator  Eeeek! :-)	 NO! A-Max uses
							 _partition_ device
	 Controller	 Device Driver	A-MaxII Driver   drivers, which will 
							 not only not create
	   A2090         hddisk.device    hddisk.amhd    hardfiles - they will
	   A2091/A590    scsi.device      scsi.amhd      destroy all other
	   GVP           scsidev.device   scsidev.amhd   data in your hardfile
							 partition!!!
	But there is a way - see item on A-MaxII below.

6.  What components are involved in the installation of a hardfile?

    Installation of a hardfile is accomplished for an application via a GUI,
    a program, a shell script, or a manually invoked sequence of commands
    which accomplish a procedure of the following form:

	a. A link is provided between the hardfile location and the
	   hardfile device driver.  Some drivers want to be given a
	   partition name, some need a volume:directory/path supplied
	   through a software ASSIGN, and some drivers need an ASCII
	   string pointer in a <Volume/directory/filename> format.  For
	   example an Emplant hardfile might need "Assign EMPHF: HD1:"
	   where EMPHF: is a symbolic link name known to the emphf.device
	   driver, and HD1: is a hard disk device name. The device driver
	   will usually supply the actual enumerated file name for the
           hardfile, with the enumeration determined through information
           supplied from the GUI tool or CLI entry, inspection of the named
           partition, or by the "Unit =" entry in the mountlist.  One
	   exception is the Bridgeboard, which looks for an ASCII string
	   file pointer link in a file having the name aboot.ctrl which
	   must be placed in the sys:PC/System drawer; some more usual
	   examples would be

           "Unit0" (FmsDisk) or "EmpHardFile0" (Utilities Unlimited).

	b. Specifications for the required hardfile size, driver, file
	   system definition and format are supplied through either CLI
	   or GUI user input or through a user supplied Mountlist.
	   For circumstances where simulated hard disk size and desired
	   file system were supplied by the user, the creation/installation
	   utility will, on user request, write a Mountlist suitable for
	   subsequent loading of the device driver and mounting of the
	   hardfile.  By the end of this part of the sequence, the
	   hardfile is created and low-level prep'd; perhaps it will
	   also be mounted, ready for formatting.  If not automatically
	   mounted by the installation utility, the device will have to
	   be mounted by the user.  As an example, the FmsDisk driver
	   fmsdisk.device would like to see the following sequence:
	   "Assign FMS: HD1:HFD" and "Mount MAC: from devs:Mountlist_MAC"
	   where "FMS:" is the symbolic device name, "HD1:" is an actual
	   hard disk partition device name, "HFD" is a nice, quiet, clean
	   directory for storing hardfiles, and Mountlist_MAC is a suitable
	   mountlist containing mounting information for the volume.

	c. The FORMAT command is invoked by the user in the same fashion
	   as would be required for high-level preparation of an actual
	   hard drive, i.e.:  If Mountlist_MAC begins with the symbolic
	   device name "MAC:", "Format drive MAC: name Sys7.1.1 noicons"
	   is the command that will format the "MAC:" device after it has
	   been mounted.

7.  What file formats or handler specifications are acceptable for hardfiles?

    The answer to this question depends on the device driver.  Basically,
    it's a bit of a zoo.

    COMPATIBILITY ISSUES:

    For some time now, computer data and instruction storage systems have
    been structured for device independent composition.  Beginning with the
    Unix operating system, the idea was that any driver could be connected
    to any device, each driver extracting or replacing from that device the
    elements of its own concern, leaving the remainder untouched.  However,
    painful lessons have emerged concerning the practicality of this simple
    approach.  While it has worked fairly well for common use of sequential
    serial access file systems and hierarchical parallel access file systems,
    difficulties have been encountered with highly specialized applications
    such as multi-OS data storage and retrieval systems.  In particular, the
    boundary interface between the system, the drivers, and the file systems
    must be written coherently.  If a reader requests an element of data, the
    most recent data must be passed.  If a writer sends an element of data,
    the data element must be written in the most current storage location.
    It does appear that in AmigaDOS and its applications this does not always
    happen as it should.  The interface boundary specification is either not
    followed, or it is not capable of assuring this simple scheme will work
    as needs be.  Systems using the mem/media data cache approach (i.e., the
    Emplant file system) evidently won't work with drivers that don't expect
    data cache methodologies to be in use (i.e., FMSdisk or the Flat-Handler).

    Don't expect co-compatibility with application specific file systems; to
    the contrary, expect that extended operations with drivers not specifically
    designed for use with a particular application, and not co-maintained with
    the current release of the software in use will sooner or later bring about
    file system corruption.  Uses of these tools are thus for first aid efforts
    or for inconsequential experimentation only, and are better practiced only
    by those familiar with each of the application specific environments.
    
    SOME DEVICE AND DRIVER ASSOCIATIONS:

    Here is a brief overview, by device:

	Tool/Device      File Formats Supported     File Formats Not Supported

	makeab/janus     MSDOS Big Floppy Image     Standard Hard Drive Format
	jlink/janus      MSDOS Big Floppy Image     Standard Hard Drive Format
	Install/emphf    EMPLANT hardfile drive     Any entry accepted.  Use of
	                 CrossDOS/MAC formats       PD drivers unacceptable;
	                 supported for MAC & PC     not a co-compatible system.
	Install/filedisk MSDOS, CrossDOSFileSystem  Unknown: manual spec can
	                 Mac,   CrossMACFileSystem  be entered in Mountfile via
	                                            any text editor; it's YTBD.
	PcFormat/multidos MSDOS, MultiDosFilesystem Those needing MSDOS bootcode
	Various/fmsdisk Non-cached data systems     You MUST supply a Mountlist
	                                            No Mountlist = No Support!

    Note that "Install" refers to the CBM Install utility, which is custom
    built by each licensee for a particular application.  The problem is
    that an application's Install menu may not offer at a critical point
    in the install sequence the particular option you seek to invoke.

    Both A-Max and Emplant are able to read and write to AMAX partitions,
    though Emplant will not format on request a disk volume with AMAX format
    unless the volume is a hardfile created by the Emplant install utility
    for which the file system was specified as "L:CrossMACFileSystem".

    A-MaxII does not accept EMPLANT format, regardless of the supplied media.
    For Macintosh enthusiasts, FmsDisk can create many Mac formats desired
    for a hardfile via a user supplied Mountlist containing a suitably set
    reference: i.e., "FileSystem = L:CrossMACFileSystem"; furthermore, with
    this Mountlist entry "Flags = 2 /* Amax = 2 */" will succeed in creating
    a hardfile with the AMAX format.  Unfortunately, though, the mfm.device
    used with this file system may not be able to reliably read those floppy
    disks not too well written (it would seem) by A-MaxII.  The Emplant
    multi-os.device can provide a way out of this problem, or at least, it
    can if you have the Emplant Macintosh emulation software release 5.0 or
    earlier.  For 5.0 or lower, the multi-os.device can be substituted for the
    CrossDOS mfm.device.  Do not use FmsDisk with the EMPHF hardfiles, though,
    since FmsDisk is not co-compatible with that system.  With the release of
    Emplant version 5.1, UU put this interesting note in the upgrade document:
	
 "* Removed AmigaDOS support completely from multi-os.device.  Due to various
    changes in trackdisk.device over time, it no longer behaves in a proper
    manner (ProtStatus can no longer be called from with [sic] an interrupt),
    so multi-os.device no longer passes things to trackdisk.device (AmigaDOS
    disk format).  This means that you will no longer be able to use the
    multi-os.device in place of the mfm.device (as of OS3.1's version of
    CrossDOS you couldn't anyways)."
	
    One can easily surmise that difficult, ugly and weird terrain lies ahead
    in the world of multi-OS file system management via independent drivers
    and devices.  Formerly it was the case that CBM enforced the rules for
    Amiga compatible devices and drivers.  Now it is the case that the VARs
    have been transformed to independent system authors.  They are now found
    to be responsible for the proper function of their application software,
    independently with respect to the operating system.  Expect that they will
    use a Macintosh-like closed system authorship, and will maintain whatever
    compatibility is needed within their own products, co-compatibility then
    becoming a thing of the past, a relic of former days when there was a
    strong Amiga parent company.

    The constructs discussed in this FAQ were verified under AmigaDOS 2.1 and
    3.0 with Consultron's CrossMAC 1.05 used with CrossDOS version 6.03, A2000,
    A3000, & A4000 computers.  While Consultron did provide CrossDOS for CBMs
    AmigaDOS version 2.1 and 3.0, many users have reported problems for newer
    AmigaDOS 3.1 with CrossDOS and with the Emplant empscsi.device. Likely it
    is broken under AmigaDOS version 3.1; if it won't work, it probably isn't
    a Utilities Unlimited problem.  The same applies to the CrossDOS examples.

    For all the CBM AmigaDOS versions one can use FmsDisk to create and mount
    floppy disk image hardfiles with Consultron's supplied floppy Mountlist.
    One can then format the floppy via Consultron's own Format command.  As
    long as one uses the comparatively slower FmsDisk software exclusively
    with the file systems created via the fmsdisk.device, and one does not
    sometimes Mount them with the emphf.devices and at other times go to the
    fmsdisk.device for the same volume, data corruption is unlikely.  When
    CrossMAC's file system handler (CrossMACFileSystem) is in the Mountlist,
    a floppy thus initialized is an aligned mfm format that is superior to
    one written by A-MaxII (at least with respect to desired cross-system
    portability).  It is, as well, a format into which either A-MaxII or
    Emplant can reliably copy whatever files you may want to move from one
    platform to another.

    Below is a list of file systems used in hardfiles, per application:

	Application	File System		Compatible Drivers

	Apple `Any Mac'	L:CrossMACFileSystem	fmsdisk.device, mfm.device
	Consultron				ramdrive.device, emphf.device

	Apple MacII	UU Emplant proprietary	emphf.device ONLY
	HardFileSetup	?"EmplantFileSystem"? <-FS Name not seen in Mountlist!

	A-MaxII/IV	L:CrossMACFileSystem	fmsdisk.device, mfm.device
	Consultron				ramdrive.device

	MSDOS		L:MultiDosFilesystem	multidos.device, mfm.device
						fmsdisk.device, ramdrive.device

	MSDOS		L:CrossDOSFileSystem	filedisk.device, mfm.device
	Consultron				fmsdisk.device, ramdrive.device

	Amiga		AmigaDOS		fmsdisk.device, ramdrive.device
	Commodore				scsi.device

	Bridgeboard	MSDOS			janus.library, scsi.device etc.
	JLINK		makes PC linked hardfile volumes, extendible size
	MakeAB		makes PC Autoboot hardfile volume, fixed size

8.  How do I make a symbolic device link to a hardfile and get it mounted?

    Very well, here's the bunch of procedures, listed by Application.  The
    Mountlists are described below in the query concerning "typical mountlists"
    Note that a reference to "Mountlist_DEV"[n] in the procedures below
    identifies the particular mountlist "DEV" and, optionally a unit number n
    which should be used with that procedure.  The mountlist entries in the 
    mountlist section may either be placed in individual files in the devs:
    directory with the filename given in the procedure, or they may all be 
    lifted out of this FAQ as one file named, say, "devs:Mountlist_HF" or
    whatever fits well with your particular method of filing mountlists.

	In any of the following, HDx is a partition on a hard disk drive or a
	disk hardware-jumpered to Unit number x, FDHF is a "Floppy Disk image"
	stored as an AmigaDOS HardFile, and HF is a general purpose specifiable
	length hardfile stored via AmigaDOS.

	Comment:	The HardDiskSetup program can be invoked by double
			clicking on its Icon via the mouse.  It is a menu
			operated selection system similar to the CrossDOS
			Install program.  Details are explained here;
			A single page window allows incrementing the
			hardfile size from 0 in 64Kbyte steps.  Changing
			anything else in the window in an inappropriate
			fashion will silently reduce the amount selected
			to zero, at which point the "Create HardFile" and
			"Create Mount List" selection gadgets will silently
			do nothing whatsoever - so keep an eye on the size
			selected to be sure you are asking for something
			the menu is willing to provide.  A gadget allows
			selection of 0 - 15 for the unit number. A string
			gadget allows specifying a handler for the file system,
			though for either PC-Task or "Bridge Board" selections,
			L:CrossDOSFileSystem is entered automatically.  Any
			string entered in the text gadget will be obediently
			included in the FileSystem Mountlist entry, even if
			it's "L:HotCoffeeFileSystem" (don't forget the "L:").
			For the "Emplant" selection, no handler is either
			offered up or required in order to create the hardfile.
			If no entry is made, you get the UU proprietary EMPLANT
			File System.  If you type in "L:CrossMACFileSystem"
			your hardfile will be formatted with the AMAX File
			System.  The Emplant MACII emulator asks to initialize
			the hardfiles for use as soon as the emulator is opened
			to the point of displaying the Macintosh desktop.

	Query:		The drive PCC: doesn't appear to be partitioned.
			 Do you wish to partition it?  WARN: a YES may
			 corrupt data that already exists! [It seems that it
			 wants to know if you want to partition the hardfile.
			 (though it COULD be asking if you want to partition
			 the storage device (entered above as "HD1:"). You
			 always answer "Don't Partition" since you can use
			 the MSDOS FDISK command to partition it if need be,
			 and you don't want/need HD1: partitioned or, as it
			 may be, destroyed even.  Nonetheless, when selected
			 as "Partition" it did partition the hardfile, and not
			 the drive (Whew!).]
	Sub Query:	 Do you wish to format the partition?  WARN: a YES
			 may destroy data that already exists!  I invoked the
			 Format option, and it formatted the partition it
			 had placed in the hardfile... I Experimented with
			 this on a 1440K recoverable ramdisk.  Perhaps it
			 will behave in similarly civil fashion on a hardfile?
	Notice:		If you need to prep PCC: again use "QuickPrep" (TM). Ok
	Result:		Install places Mountfile and Icon in drawer
			 devs:DOSDrivers, then mounts the hardfile for you.
			 As the Mountfile is now in the devs:DOSDrivers drawer,
			 the device will hence be mounted each time the system
			 is booted.  To avoid this in future boots, you can
			 move the Mountfile and Icon to sys:Storage/DOSDrivers.
	Conclusion:	Install closes all hardfile related windows, exits.
	Comment:	The supplied Mountfile can be converted to a normal
			 Mountlist by merely inserting the device name ("PCC":)
			 as the first line of this file, checking to see that
			 the last line of the file has a single # character
			 alone on the last line, and then moving the file to
			 the devs: drawer; delete the Icon, as it is not
			 thereafter needed.  If needed at some subsequent
			 date, just cd to devs:DOSDrivers and Copy PIPE.info
			 to PCC.info and "unedit" the device name from the
			 mountlist in the devs: directory and move it back to
			 the devs:DOSDrivers directory where the tool initially
			 put it.  It would be nice if they'd let you specify
			 the hardfile size to the nearest kilobyte, or 32Kb,
			 even but after all, MSDOS would have a cow when it
			 tried to partition and/or format the file, eh?
			 Partitioning the hardfile consisted of placing at
			 the head of the file a standard MSDOS partitioning
			 table.  Formatting the hardfile consisted of writing
			 zeros in all the subsequent blocks of the file.
			 The two PC[ALPHA CHAR] mountlists at the end of the
			 FAQ's "Typical Mountlists" section (including the RAM
			 drive), were built by the CrossDOS Install utility.

			/C:N	Create a volume on the Amiga side.
				 Here N is the size in kilobytes
			/U	Unlink that volume
			/R	Link as ReadOnly (all write attempts will fail)

		Note: If you do not specify a switch, JLINK will attempt to
		       link an existing file.  If the file does not exist,
		       the link will be unsuccessful.  If you use /N with /C,
		       existing volumes are deleted without any warning.
		       For example:

		       		JLINK E: RAM:VD /C:1000

		       creates an Amiga VD file in the root directory of the
		       Amiga RAM disk.  The file contains the necessary MS-DOS
		       structures like file allocation tables, MS-DOS format,
		       and an empty root directory.  The maximum size of the
		       file in this case will be approximately 1 Meg.  The
		       specified size (/C:N) is the maximum size the file can
		       grow to.  Response of JLINK seems inconsistent, so some
		       rounding of this number must be taking place.  If the
		       number is less than 160,  the size is set to 160 Kb.
		       The file starts off as small as possible and can
		       grow as data is added, but it will never get smaller.
		       After the file has been created, it is linked (in this
		       example) to the virtual drive E:.  If the file already
		       exists, you will be asked if you want to continue.
		       By continuing, you will destroy all previous data
		       stored on that volume.  After the Amiga VD file is
		       created, and linked to the MS-DOS virtual drive E:,
		       the display will show:

				VDrive   Status   Linked to
				d:
				e:	 R/W	  vd
				f:
				g:

			The status of a new file will be either R/O for
			ReadOnly, or R/W for Read and Write.  To unlink a
			virtual drive, specify the MS-DOS virtual drive
			you wish to unlink and use the /U switch.

			CAUTION: Be sure to unlink each volume before you
				  reboot or power down the PC!

			The Amiga files of virtual drives contain no
			information that could be used on the Amiga side.
			However, they can be copied, renamed and deleted
			like normal Amiga files.  When a file is linked
			to a virtual drive, AmigaDOS cannot access the
			file until it is unlinked by JLINK.

			[Note that JDISKS are nonetheless hardfiles, and
			any MSDOS hardfile that has a boot block that can be
			translated into a mountlist can be mounted via the
			CrossDOSFileSystem and the fmsdisk.device, or by the
			CrossDOS ConfigDisk utility.]

10. What keywords are known to the AmigaDOS Mount Command?

    There are bunches of Mount keywords; most are optional.  Here are the ones
    described in the "AmigaDOS Reference Guide" (Fourth Edition) Sheldon Leemon
    Compute Books (1992):

	Handler =	The name of the device handler file.
	EHandler =	The name of the environment handler file
			 (Release 2 and 3 AmigaDOS).
	FileSystem =	The name of the file system file.
	Device =	The name of the device driver file.
	Priority =	The task priority of the process;
			 5 is customary for handlers, 10 for file systems.
	Unit =		The unit number of the device.
	Flags =		Flags setting for OpenDevice call (usually 0)
			 (See RKM for details).
	Surfaces =	Number of write surfaces.
	BlocksPerTrack= The number of disk blocks (sectors)
					per track (cylinder).
	BlockSize =	Number of bytes per block (default = 512)
	Reserved =	The number of blocks used for boot block; usually 2.
	PreAlloc =	The number of blocks reserved at the end of a partition;
			 used with a few IBM-style hard drives.  Usually set to
			 zero.
	Interleave =	Interleave value (controls DOS interleave, not physical
			 hard drive interleave).
	LowCyl =	Starting cylinder to use for this device.
	HighCyl =	Ending cylinder to use for this device.  Total number
			 of cylinders = HighCyl - LowCyl + 1.
	Stacksize =	The amount of working memory to allocate to the process.
	Buffers =	Number of cache buffers to use with this device.
	BufMemType =	Type of memory to use for cache buffers:
			 0 or 1 = Any
			 2 or 3 = CHIP
			 4 or 5 = FAST
			 Originally: Odd numbers were presumed to be public.
				      - or was it the other way around...???
	Mount =		If this value is positive, MOUNT loads the handler or
			 driver software as soon as the device is MOUNTed,
			 rather than the first time the device is accessed.
			 Workbench 2.1 adds ACTIVATE as a synonym for this
			 keyword.
	MaxTransfer = 	The maximum number of blocks transferred at one time;
			 used with fast file system devices.
	Mask =		Address mask that specifies the memory range that can
			 be used for DMA transfers; used with Fast File System.
	GlobVec =	If the handler is written in BCPL, it needs a global
			 vector.  A value of 0 sets up a private global vector;
			 anything else indicates that the handler is written
			 in C or assembly language, and no global vector is
			 needed.  If this keyword isn't used, the shared
			 AmigaDOS global vector is used.
	Startup =	A string passed to the handler, device or file system
			 on startup; this string is passed as a BPTR to a BSTR.
	BootPri =	The boot priority of a bootable device, expressed as a
			 number between -129 and +127.  A value of -129
			 indicates that the device isn't bootable, as is
			 appropriate for use with the recoverable RAM disk if
			 you don't want to boot from that device on reset.
	DosType =	Indicates the format of the file system used.  If the
			 Fast File System is used, this value should be set to
			 0x444F5301 which is Hex for "DOS1"; other types that
			 were introduced in 2.1 include 0x444F5302 ("DOS2"),
			 an international version of the old file system that
			 allows mixed case accented characters in filenames,
			 and 0x444F5303 ("DOS3"), an international version of
			 the Fast File System.  User types commonly found in
			 applications such as use CrossMAC or CrossDOS are
			 0x4D414300 ("MAC"), or 0x4D534400 ("MSD"), and from
			 Emplant 0x4D534800 ("MSH") for their MSDOS hardfiles.
	Baud =		Serial device speed (in bits per second).
	Control =	Serial device control parameters;- word length, parity,
			 and stop bits (e.g. 8N1, 7E1).
	ForceLoad =	A new 2.1 option; when this value is zero (the default)
			 the system will check the resource list to see if the
			 file system named in the entry has already been loaded.
			 If it has, the system will use that one, instead of
			 loading a new copy.  When ForceLoad is set to one,
			 however, a new version will always be loaded from disk.


11. Can I mount a file system for A-Max as a hardfile?

    There is at least one way, but it involves several elaborate procedures:

    Make a partition on a Syquest 88 Meg removable media hard disk containing
    an AutoBootPC volume in the upper half of the partition and an A-MaxII
    file system in the lower half.  The AutoBootPC volume is effectively just
    a large-floppy format MSDOS hardfile.  It is then only necessary to overlay
    the A-MaxII file system by a file which is allocated to AmigaDOS.  This is
    done by generating a file named "RESERVED" formatted by the AmigaDOS v1.3
    Fast File System.  The v1.3 Fast File System did not have any dispersed
    file list blocks such as are interspersed within the otherwise contiguously
    formable file blocks of the AmigaDOS 2.0 and higher file system revisions.
    This Mac file system system can be created in the following manner:

	1} Copy the v1.3 FastFileSystem from an AmigaDOS v1.3 Workbench into
	   your v2.+ AmigaDOS Workbench L: directory as "OFFSFileSystem" and
	   copy the v1.3 Workbench Format command to sys:System as "Formit"
	   using either the v1.3 icon or a copy of the sys:System/Format.info
	   to sys:System/Formit.info; correct the Tool Types to be the same as
	   are used by the v1.3 version of Format.
	 
	2} Build overlapping mountlists for the 64 megabyte DH1 partition.
	   Inspect and plan to use the "-->" entries in the mountlists below:

	/*SyQuest SQ5110 BBA CFA  ADDR 0  LUN 0	 CYL 2710  HD 2  BPT 32 */

	While to start with the RDB will contain only DH0: and DH1:, after all
	of the partitioning, formatting, and loading of software has been done,
	the RDB will contain only the DH0: and AMAX: volume mountfiles.
	The intended run-time operation is as follows:

	Of the above, RES0: is unopposedly mounted by the hard drive controller
	(it is the RDB partition); DH0: and AMAX: are then mounted by the
	hard drive controller as automounting from the RDB, while the upper
	half of the space described in the DH1: mountlist above is "empty grey"
	or unallocated, according to the HDToolbox depiction.  The lower end
	of DH1: starts one cylinder below AMAX:; the center of DH1:, which
	contains all of the file list blocks is just above the top of the
	AMAX: volume.   DH1: is mounted after boot at the beginning of the
	s:User-startup file.  Why is all this rigamarole engaged?  Well, it's
	done because A-MaxII will mount ONLY a device whose name begins with
	AMAX and is also ONLY placed in the RDB!  Devices having names that
	begin with AMAX and are mounted by Exec after the RDB has been read
	are ignored by the A-MaxII boot sequence.  Do not let anyone who has
	not read this FAQ ever invoke HDToolbox on your Syquest drive, or they
	will surely not understand everything that is going on, and will mess
	things up before they get any grasp of the way all this must be done!

	A procedure needed to make the file systems in the right order is
	explained as follows:

	1) Use HDToolbox to initialize the Syquest DH0: and DH1: partitions.

	2) Reboot the system so that the hard drive controller can read the
	   RDB.  Format the DH0: partition and load the operating software,
	   including the Bridgeboard and A-MaxII software.

	3) Now "formit" the DH1: volume.

		Formit drive DH1: name DH1 noicons ffs

	4) Generate the AutoBootPC file

		CD DH1:
		MakeAB AutoBootPC

	   Use 1024 cyl 2 hd 32 blocks per track - get a 33 Meg hardfile, which
	   AmigaDOS will gleefully place entirely in the upper half of the
	   partition (except for the file list blocks, some of which will be
	   written at the top of the lower half of the partition).  Edit the
	   sys:PC/System/ABoot.ctrl file to contain the string "DH1:AutoBootPC"
	   sans quotes.

	5) Invoke a program that sequentially allocates file blocks and writes
	   a FFS format pattern in them; use it to fill the entire lower half
	   of the DH1 volume.  [One such a program, "Reserve" creates one long
	   sequential file named "RESERVED"; the OFFS file system puts the
	   file list blocks just below the root track working downward, while
	   Reserve writes file blocks at block 2 of Cyl 0, working on upward.
	   Note: since A-Max adjusts its AMAX: file system to work upward from
	   (and including) block zero it is necessary to mark blocks 2 through
	   64 of DH1 as unavailable in the bit map using "Sec" (sector editor).
	   Reserve will then start by allocating two blocks in the root track,
	   one for the file header, and one for the first data block.  Reserve
	   will then continue on writing and allocating blocks starting with
	   block 65 (the second block in Cyl 1) right up to the last block
	   available on the disk.  When Reserve is done, Sec is used to change
	   the file header block pointer for the one data block in the root
	   track to a pointer to block 64, thus making the RESERVED file start
	   exactly at the beginning of Cyl 1, and end exactly at the top of
	   cylinder 996; the last block is block 63807 ($F93F), as must be
	   secured by zeroing any higher numbered blocks out of block 63849
	   ($F969), which is the last (and highest numbered) file list block.

	6) The RESERVED file header block size word ($51) is next edited to
	   show a file length of exactly 32,636,928 bytes = 996 cylinders.
	   This will leave 22 unallocated blocks just above the last of the
	   file list blocks that begin with block 63808 ($F940).  There is thus
	   room there for the disk icon file (Disk.info) if it is written to
	   the disk right after the disk is validated (see procedure below).
	   Now, force the disk validator to process the DH1 volume (clear word
	   4E in the DH1 root block from FFFFFFFF to 00000000 and invoke the
	   diskchange program to call the validator).  By AmigaDOS standards,
	   though, the AMAX partition is rather non-standard, since standard
	   partitions start on an even numbered cylinder and end with an odd
	   numbered cylinder.  Don't ever try to get AmigaDOS to format the
	   AMAX partition, as it may format one cylinder higher than intended
	   while thinking it needs to format an even number of cylinders...

	7) Place the command "Mount DH1:" in the s:User-startup file and edit
	   the devs:MountList file to contain the above specied device entries.
	   Invoke HDToolbox; delete the DH1 partition and define the AMAX
	   partition in the start and end text gadgets as start cyl 661 and
	   end cyl 1656.  Leave everything above cylinder 1656 unallocated.
	   Use the "Advanced Options" to declare the AMAX partition as a
	   "Reserved File System" partition with automount enabled.  Again
	   reboot the system to bring this status to current for AmigaDOS.
	   From now on, only the RDB and A-MaxII will need to know about the
	   AMAX: partition. Having done all this, bring up the Bridgeboard
	   and use FDISK to initialize the 33 Meg AutoBootPC hardfile, format
	   its internal partitions (if you created an extension using FDISK)
	   format all the PC volumes and load the PC software.  When done with
	   that, invoke A-MaxII; it will find the AMAX: partition mounted by
	   the hard drive controller from the RDB.  A-MaxII will ask that the
	   hard disk be initialized; given your approval, at the end of that
	   operation a 31 Meg Mac hard drive will be available for loading all
	   those cheap 128K mac programs you've always wanted to try out!

	   In addition, the DH1: file "RESERVED" is effectively an A-MaxII
	   hardfile which can be transferred as an AmigaDOS file to any other
	   similarly formed Syquest 88 Meg platter.  It can also be mounted on
	   the Amiga side, but not simultaneously with operation of the A-MaxII
	   program, however; as Dave Haynie once declared, "A-MaxII is not a
	   well behaved Amiga application - it's a `hostile takeover' program."
	   Following is a CrossMAC mountlist:

  /* SCSI A-MaxII system hardfile on an 88 Meg removable Syquest hard disk */

	MACS:
	     Device = scsi.device
	     FileSystem = L:CrossMACFileSystem
	     Unit   = 0
	     Flags  = 0
	     Surfaces  = 2
	     BlocksPerTrack = 32
	     Reserved = 2
	     Interleave = 0
	     LowCyl = 661  ;  HighCyl = 1656
	     Buffers = 30
	     GlobVec = -1
	     BufMemType = 0
	     DosType = 0x4D414300
	     StackSize = 4000
	#

	   With AMAX: / RESERVED mounted as a CrossMAC volume, you can do with
	   it as you please in so far as file transfer to your other networked
	   Amigas and their Mac emulator packages is concerned.  As an exercise
	   in extreme file system perversion, this is a good one; as "hardfile
	   support" well, it's just not.  Of course, you could avoid all this
	   by just doing the RDB allocation of an entire 64 Meg AMAX partition
	   to A-MaxII, or even by making two 32 Meg partitions, DH1 with PCDisk
	   for the Bridgeboard, and AMAX for A-MaxII.  You could the copy the
	   AMAX partition mountlist to devs as a MACX partition with FileSystem
	   and DosType entries as above, and use CrossMAC to mount the MACX:
	   volume to access it from the Amiga side when A-MaxII is not running.
	   Far simpler, but then you wouldn't have a RESERVED hardfile you
	   could mess with, either, would you...

12. Can I mount Emplant or PCTask hardfiles for access from the Amiga side?

    If you have the applicable multi-platform software (i.e., CrossDOS for PCs,
    CrossMAC for MACs), you usually can provide access to the hardfile content
    from the Amiga in addition to that provided through the emulator via its
    file handling software.  Just as instructions are provided with the Aminet
    program PCDisk for mounting a PC partition on the Amiga side, instructions
    can be generated for mounting a PC or MAC hardfile - with a little work.

    Mount a floppy image hardfile as device MFH0 (as in the mountlist section).
    Format the hardfile via the command "Format drive MFH0: name MFH0 noicons"
    for instance (this is the first reference for new files - otherwise you can
    use any command that requests data from the file in order to access it and
    bring up the Workbench icon for the volume).

    Note that an initial formatting done immediately after creation of the
    hardfile may not produce a format usable by the emulator.  In that case,
    the volume will be mounted and presented to the emulator, and the emulator
    will then usually have the capacity to format the volume for its own use.
    
    However, in most cases it is possible to mount and format the volume with
    CrossDOS or CrossMAC (making it accessible on the Amiga side) and then
    discover that the emulator also has access to the volume after it has been
    mounted.  For such instances, do be aware that the emulator has no idea
    what state AmigaDOS has stored for the content of the volume, and neither
    does AmigaDOS have any idea what the emulator's stored state for the volume
    happens to be.  For these circumstances, only one system may write to the
    volume at once without corrupting it; so as soon as a writer has finished,
    the reading system needs to perform an internal update of it's own record
    of the volume content.  With AmigaDOS, use the command "diskchange"; for
    the Mac it will be necessary to drag the volume to the Trashcan (possibly
    it will be necessary to re-mount it after doing this).  On a PC, issue a
    "CHKDSK" command for the volume.  Needless to say, these procedures do not
    support automatically maintained access from both sides...

    Also, FYI only, Macintosh partitioned hard drives connected to the EMPLANT
    SCSI bus can be mounted on the Amiga side via the empscsi.device prior to
    invoking the MACII emulator, thus allowing the same type of self-policed
    only-one-writer-at-a-time-please mode described above for hardfiles.  Do
    be aware, though, that you can only read (not write) a disk which has been
    previously mounted by the Emplant Mac Emulator and formatted to run with
    the faster EMPLANT file system (which uses directory and data caches); but
    if the volume was previously formatted via mounting it from the Amiga side
    using the CrossMACFileSystem, you can read and write as long as you don't
    do so at the same time the emulator is trying to read or write.  As an
    an example, assume you have an old Quantum 105S you didn't know what to
    do with, and you put it on the Emplant SCSI bus.  After the 2-sequence
    boot produced by RsrvMem via the SetupEMPLANT script launched in the
    Startup-sequence invocation, before you do much of anything else, mount
    the Quantum 105S with this mountlist from the file "Mountlist_MACX":

	/* Quantum LP105S with Macintosh format, no Amiga Rigid Disk Block! */
	/* It is factored to multiples of 13, 16, or 19 blocks per track to */
	/* utilize a total of 205,504 available blocks.  The Standard Amiga */
	/* format for this drive is a multiple of 14 blocks per track, done */
	/* as 2097 cyl, 98 blocks per track = 205,506 available blocks.  It */
	/* is rated at 101 Meg (1 Meg = 2048 blocks) or 105,906,176 bytes.  */

	MACX:
	    Device = empscsi.device
	    FileSystem = L:CrossMACFileSystem
	    Unit   = 0
	    Flags  = 0
	    Surfaces  = 2
	    BlocksPerTrack = 32
	    Reserved = 0
	    Interleave = 0
	    LowCyl = 0 ;  HighCyl = 3211
	    Buffers = 30
	    GlobVec = -1
	    BufMemType = 0
	    DosType = 0x4D414300
	    MaxTransfer = 0xffffff
	    Mask = 0x7ffffffe
	    StackSize = 4000
	#

	via	Mount MACX: from Mountlist_MACX

    Note that you cannot use SCSIMounter to mount this Mac formatted hard disk
    since it does not have an RDB written to the first two cylinders as would
    an Amiga system hard drive or Amiga-specific CD-ROM disk.

    If you issue the command "cd MACX:" from a CLI, you will get a requester
    advising that there is no media in the drive.  However, if you cancel the
    requester and issue a "DiskChange MACX:" command, a CrossMAC icon for the
    drive will appear on the Workbench, and the next CLI command you issue to
    reference the drive will work to open the volume to the Amiga side.

    Once the volume is available to the Amiga, you can go ahead and launch the
    Mac emulator.  Note that some Mac apps do timing critical disk accesses.
    If you gong one of these programs with interleaved disk accesses, you may
    end up with a messed up MAC file system. It isn't assured that you could
    mess things up if you wanted to, but it's also not assured that you won't
    even if you don't want to...

    Keep in mind the fact that this volume is mounted and accesed from the
    Amiga side, this being the case in spite of the fact that the volume is
    also available to the emulator on the Emplant scsi bus.  What this means
    is that if the disk is hardware jumpered as unit 0, the emulator will try
    to boot from it, and if it succeeds in this, it will use it as the System
    disk.  If, using the emulator setup screen you have also presented it to
    the emulator as a mountable Amiga device, the Mac can access it as either
    volume, and will almost certainly corrupt it if it is write permitted, and
    otherwise will probably crash before long because the read-only volume will
    not have updated information about the file system once the emulator writes
    to the System volume.  Next, if the emulator insisted the device was not
    initialized properly and you elect to have the emulator initialize it, the
    emulator will install the EmplantFileSystem with a dynamic cache in place.
    After that, any read or write from the Amiga side will cause the emulator
    to non-interactively corrupt the file system.  However, as long as the
    CrossDosFileSystem was used in formating the disk, and the emulator does
    accept the volume as valid from the emulator port on the scsi bus, and
    the disk was not presented to the emulator from the Amiga side via the
    Mac Emulation Setup "Devices" option, and the disk was presented to the
    emulator via the "Mass Storage" "Enable Emplant SCSI" check box, it should
    be ok to use via the previously described one-writer-at-a-time methodology.

13. Can I use MessyDOS for MSDOS hardfiles?

    No.  MessyDOS was a shareware program developed for floppy disks on the
    Amiga 1000 or 2000 computers using the MC68000 processor.  The included
    formatting routine "MessyFmt" is an IBM DOS 720K floppy tool even though it
    seems to present options that might allow formatting a 1440K MSDOS floppy.
    It is reportedly buggy when used with 020/030/040 processors, producing
    errors such as "missing sector" in freshly formatted disks.  It may have
    processor speed dependent timing loops that do not work with the faster
    Motorola processors.  Also, when one enters values that are appropriate
    for 18 sector/track HD media and a HD disk is placed in an Amiga HD floppy
    drive, the resultant disk is unreadable by any DOS.  Perhaps a more recent
    version than the Aug 1990 release would be more functional (v1.3, but at
    least one earlier release had a higher number due to omission of the "v0."
    that should have been prepended).

14. Can I use MultiDos for MSDOS hardfiles?

    Yes.  MultiDos, like MessyDOS, is an IBM DOS 720K floppy utility.  The
    multidos.device is a fine DD floppy driver which provides auto diskchange
    for volumes mounted in accordance with supplied documentation.  Look for
    it on Aminet Set #1 disk A in :Aminet/misc/emu.  For hardfile support, the
    components of MultiDos work just fine with the standard Amiga drivers and
    work with the fmsdisk.device as well.  While the documentation says that
    the formatting tool "PcFormat" allows the user to specify the DOS boot
    block file system information content, it only writes the first 54 bytes
    of the boot block.  But it will usually provide enough vital file system
    data that the volume can be mounted and accessed on an Amiga, execpt that
    the multidos.device fails on HD floppies in the same way as does MessyDOS.
    If you should happen to use the Norton Utilities program Disk Doctor (NDD)
    to inspect the disk, and the utiliity requested permission to re-write the
    boot block, then you will need to inspect the parameters the utility wrote
    to the boot block to make sure information provided by the PcFormat tool 
    was not altered; any alteration to the file system parameters will need to
    be returned to what PcFormat wrote.

    Do have on hand a generous stock of your favorite beverage before invoking
    the PcFormat command on a large rigid disk hardfile, though, as it can
    take a significant fraction of an hour to do its work (adding buffers via
    the AmigaDOS "AddBuffers" command for the disk devices will help some, but 
    for even a thousand extra buffers, "initializing disk" at the end takes a
    long time).
    
    MultiDos is useful when maintaining hardfile images of floppy disks, since
    CrossDOS will format non-floppy internal 1440K drives with a 25 sector
    overhead rather than the standard 33 sector overhead DOS expects.  Use of
    MultiDos allows formatting internal drives with whatever values are needed
    for the application via the file "s:PcFormat.spc" in which the usable specs
    can be entered and identified much as one identifies the individual entries
    in a large file containing multiple mountlists.  A good optional tool from
    MultiDos for hardfile support is the sys:System/PcFormat executable.  For
    previously undocumented extraordinary HD floppy and MSDOS hardfile support,
    see devices DV0:, DR0:, DD0:, and MDH: in the Procedures and Mountlists
    sections of this FAQ.  When preparing mountlists, remember that while the
    CrossDOSFileSystem desires a "Reserved = 0" entry in the mountlist, the
    MultiDosFilesystem wants to see "Reserved = 1" to separate the boot block
    from the file system allocation tables (FATs) and the blocks assigned to
    the root directory.  Below is an example of a "s:PcFormat.spc" file entry
    for a large hardfile. It shows what was included in the <spec> and what the
    formatter did for a volume established via the fmsdisk.device referencing
    the L:MultiDosFilesystem in a mountlist.  As reported by the AmigaDOS Info
    command, the file system total is 65277 blocks, 157 of which are used in
    file system overhead.  It can accommodate a 65120 block file, which will
    be 33341440 bytes. The specification and its result is detailed here:

	Entry				 Result

	F8:				 Boot Record (Norton Utilities):
	SystemID = MDos1.0		 OEM ID: MDos1.0.
	BytesPerSector = 512		 Bytes per sector: 512 
	BlocksPerCluster = 4		 Sectors per cluster: 4 
	PreAlloc = 1			 Reserved sectors at beginning: 1 
	NumbersOfFats = 2		 FAT Copies: 2 
	NumberOfRootDirEntries = 448	 Root directory entries: 448 
	TotalBlocksOnDisk = 65280	 Total sectors on disk: 65280
	FormatID = 0xF8			 Media descriptor byte: F8 Hex
	BlocksPerFat = 64		 Sectors per FAT: 64 
	BlocksPerTrack = 32		 Sectors per track: 32 
	Surfaces = 8			 Sides: 8

	VolumeSerialNumber = 0		 Volume Serial Number: 0 
	VolumeLabel MultiDos1.0		 Volume Label:        s1.0
	FileSystemID = FAT12		 File System ID: ........ <<not known>>
	##				 ##


    The PcFormat software seems to use FAT12 for floppy volumes or moderate
    size hardfiles, though it automatically adjusts to FAT16 for volumes with
    more clusters than the 4096 that can be listed with a 12-bit FAT pointer.
    At no time does it ever enter the FAT type in the bootblock entry, though.
    It's doubtful that PcFormat can prepare a volume larger than 65 Meg, even
    if CrossDOSFileSystem were to be used in the mountlist.  Do note that for
    CrossDOS Professional (CDP) software, an install utility is used to set up
    large hardfile volumes.  Volumes created by the CrossDOS utility will have
    a partitioning table pre-pended to the file system, as well. CrossDOS is
    considerably more stable than the multidos shareware, as one might expect
    for a commercial file system software package versus good shareware code.
    This is so not so much in regard to the skill levels of the shareware
    programmers (who probably do computer programming for a living eight or
    more hours a day anyway) but rather because commercial establishments can
    more readily hire additional programmers, and they can as well specify
    performance criteria for the beta testers they employ.

    If you need to figure out what to use for the <spec> entries, start with a
    volume size in megabytes (try to use a size that's an even power of two);
    divide that by 512 to get the TotalBlocksOnDisk (if equal or greater than
    65536, you need to desire a smaller volume, as this software uses FAT12 and
    16-bit integers; that's all it can do).  Divide the number of blocks by
    4096 (FAT12) rounded up to the nearest integer to get the minimum usable
    number of blocks per cluster.  To make life easy, use 16, 32 or 64 sectors
    per track (this number also should be used in the device mountlist for the
    "BlocksPerTrack" item).  You can use whatever multiple of 16 you like for
    the NumberOfRootDirEntries, since there are 16 entries per 512 byte block.
    Set the Surfaces to the TotalBlocksOnDisk divided by BlocksPerTrack.  If
    Surfaces comes out larger than 16, multiply the BlocksPerTrack by factors
    of two up to no more than 64.  Surfaces times BlocksPerTrack needs to be
    1024 or less.  If you want a somewhat more MS-DOS compatible file system,
    you can always set it up with some numbers using PcFormat with -f<spec>
    option, then edit the boot block with a sector editor to change from the
    DOS 3.2 implementation to a DOS 4.0+ implementation - if you know what to
    put in the last six entries.  The only thing you must have done right in
    order to do this is you must have fat tables large enough to hold the FAT
    cluster pointers.  If you had enough room for the FAT12 pointers, you'll
    have enough room for the FAT16 pointers with no adjustment in the cluster
    size, for sure.  The FAT16 pointers are four bits longer than the FAT12
    pointers, but there are fewer of them by a factor of 16 with no change in
    the cluster size.  Thus it is also usually possible to reduce the cluster
    size by two, four, or eight and still have enough room in the FAT table
    for all of the cluster pointers.  PcFormat will allow <spec> entries with
    undersized FATs.  It will just go ahead and put up as free all the file
    system space it has pointers for, and mark the remainder as unavailable.
    So if you have calculated ahead of time the size needed for the FAT16
    tables, you can enter that in the <spec>, then patch the boot block with
    a sector editor to upgrade the file system to FAT16.  Conceivably, you can
    use the Norton Utilities to help with this operation, but if you happen to
    do something Norton DISKEDIT doesn't like, Norton will reward you with a
    "sector not found" error after writing the boot block back to the disk,
    and you'll have to start over.  So try to do this with an Amiga sector
    editor if you have one handy.

    Using "PcFormat" sans the -f option on a device mounted with fmsdisk.device
    for a handler, and with FileSystem = L:MultiDosFilesystem in the mountlist
    will create a volume with only 30 blocks overhead.  This implies a large
    cluster size.  CrossDOS likewise tends to use cluster sizes equal to the
    volume size in megabytes.  However, when given the "-fF8:" specification
    as above, there were 157 blocks of file system overhead using a cluster
    size of only 4 blocks, more nearly as expected for a 33 megabyte volume.

    Also, even for the above listed example, the PcFormat routine nulled out
    the first seven characters of the Volume Label.  The L:MultiDosFilesystem
    can be used for both floppy drives and internal floppy images as well as
    medium sized hard files.  It is, though, fatally cranky about numbers in
    the file system pointers larger than 65536, and did not employ the FAT16
    entries found as the last six items in the file properties list above even
    when they were specified as non-zero values. So it is the case that both
    MessyDOS and MultiDos are somewhat flakey when it comes to user entry of
    file system parameters, MessyDOS being considerably worse than MultiDos
    in that regard.

15. Can I use my Mac-2-DOS MAC floppy adapter cartridge to load hardfiles?

    CrossMAC reports this cartridge as a "Non Amiga-standard Mac drive" and
    subsequently ignores it.  Emplant ignores either the Mac-2-DOS cartridge
    or the AMAX cartridge for anything except the "Converter" program.  The
    Mac-2-DOS software itself is Mac <--> Amiga oriented and does not possess
    the multi-platform mentality it would need to have in order to transfer
    files into MSDOS file systems, for instance, in a convenient way.  Each
    direction of a Mac-2-DOS transfer comes with certain assumptions about
    vendor & product name, resource & data forks, and the handling of icons.
    The DOS-2-DOS software package (also produced by Central Coast Software)
    was intended to address the intricacies of MSDOS <--> Amiga transfer in
    an independent way.  The tools provided with these packages are oriented
    to black & white graphics for the most part.  So while it might be that
    these packages are good companions for the A-MaxII emulator and the CBM
    XT and AT Bridgeboards, they are not as useful in the current programming
    context as they need to be.

16. Can I use my A-MaxII ROM / MAC floppy adapter cartridge to load hardfiles?

    Yes, you can.  Connect the cartridge to the DF2: 23-pin D Connector on
    your Amiga, and you can read, write, format or [accidentally?] destroy
    any write-permitted 800K real Macintosh variable speed drive floppy you
    can get your hands on.  You can use either A-MaxII or CrossMAC to read
    disks on a Mac 800K drive plugged into this cartridge.  You can use the
    CrossMAC utilities to convert 800K Mac format disks to 800K AMAX format
    disks, as described earlier in this FAQ.

17. Can I use my Emplant AMIA MAC floppy adapter cartridge to load hardfiles?

    Yes, and a Fujitsu 800Kb floppy drive is available from Utilities Unlimited.
    Can't say as how it would work with HD disks in a Mac SuperDrive, though;
    connecting one up might be a fun project to try...

18. Can I read A-Max Mini-transfer and other mixed format disks with CrossDOS?

    The short answer is: If you have an 800K Macintosh drive connected to your
    DF2 port via an A-MaxII cartridge or you have the A-MaxII+ ZorroII board
    with an 800K Macintosh drive attached you can probably read either the
    normal 800K Macintosh disks or AMax Mini-transfer disks.  But of course,
    if you had an 800K Macintosh drive connected to your Amiga, you wouldn't
    be asking this question.  While it is true that the CrossMAC devices can
    read files from A-Max format disks in Amiga DD drives, CrossMAC is not so
    likely to be able to read Mini-transfer disks in these same drives.  This
    comes about because a Mini-transfer disk is in fact nothing more than a
    standard 800K Mac floppy format divided up into two segments, one placed
    in the lowest 48 tracks and the other located in the highest 32 tracks.
    A DD disk is formatted in a standard 800K variable track speed Macintosh
    drive on a Macintosh (or on an Amiga running A-MaxII or A-MaxII+ with a
    standard 800K Macintosh drive connected to the A-MaxII cartridge or the
    A-MaxII+ board) and prep'd by the A-Max Disk Transfer application's
    "Make Mini Transfer Disk" utility.  The utility revises the disk's file
    system structure for the lower 48 tracks to effectively utilize 704 blocks
    to make a 262K file system with a 3K desktop.  After the user has written
    files to this lower part of the disk, the "Prepare Mini-transfer Disk"
    utility copies the 704 blocks verbatim to the upper 32 tracks of the
    disk.  If the disk is then moved from the Macintosh to the Amiga running
    AMax by inserting it in an Amiga DD 880K floppy drive, AMax examines the
    disk; failing to find a ten sector trackdisk format for track 0, AMax
    skips over tracks 0-47 and examines track 48 to see if it can find there
    a ten sector trackdisk format (which for that track and all other higher
    tracks is the same as a Macintosh DD format).  Although there is nothing
    more than the addition of some simple code to CrossDOS to have it do the
    same in order to read such disks, CrossDOS does not at the present time
    concern itself with such archaic meanderings.

    Mixed format disks are not commonly readable by anything but the software
    that wrote them.  Although Consultron is constantly upgrading their tools
    and utilities, priorities do not point to support for non-standard efforts.
    The A-Max Mini-transfer disk was developed by Readysoft, Inc. as a way of
    moving software from the Mac Plus to the Amiga.  These days Macintosh can
    hardly even get enough of their system on a 1440K floppy to boot a MacII
    (or a MacII emulation, for that matter).  The AMax-II Utilities disk is
    effectively a Mac format Mini-transfer disk prepared by first formatting
    it as an 800K disk, then loading 64K of utilities onto the disk, and then
    running the "Prepare Mini Transfer Disk" utility on it to directly copy
    704 blocks from the lower part of the disk to the upper 32 tracks.   With
    a disk image copier, one can make a backup copy of this disk on any 800K
    Mac floppy drive or on an Amiga running A-MaxII or A-MaxII+ / cartridge
    or board with an attached standard 800K Mac DD drive.

    Interestingly enough, it is possible to make a mixed Amiga/AMax format
    disk with the lower 48 tracks having Amiga DD format and the upper 32
    tracks having the AMax Mini Transfer Disk format.  This would be done by
    formatting, then using the AMax utility to "Make Mini Transfer Disk" and
    loading the disk with software, then using the AMax utility to "Prepare
    Mini Transfer Disk"; following that, overwrite the lower 48 tracks with
    an Amiga disk copy program that starts at track 0 and can be killed just
    as it finishes writing track 47.  It helps if the Amiga disk being copied
    is an FFS floppy, one that has a dummy file in the upper 32 tracks of the
    disk, but with the protection file's extension blocks located somewhere in
    the lower 32 tracks in order to reserve the upper 32 tracks from accidental
    write attempts by AmigaDOS.  You can do this with AmigaDOS version 1.3 FFS
    and trackdisk.device, along with the QuickCopy program by Copperstate
    Software (Fish disk 35) and the Amiga TrackUtils (Fish disk 350) or the
    Amiga DevBlocks program from Aminet Set #1.  That's the good news.  The
    bad news is that only AMax can read the upper 32 block section, which
    contains the "Prepared" Mini Transfer portion of the disk.

19. Are there any useful mixed format disks, and if so, how do I create them?

    The Unix Amiga Emulator (UAE) presents a need for multi-OS floppy support.
    Mixed format disks are useful for distributing multi-os utilities, thus it
    may be worthwhile to mention a few such formats that may be used, and to
    give instructions concerning what may be done with them for hardfile or
    floppy image support.
    
    The most serious inhibitor for mixed format floppy disks for the Amiga
    is that track 0 cannot readily be made simultaneously Amiga and DOS or Mac
    compatible.  If the lower portion of the disk is Amiga format, then it
    cannot be recognized by any other OS.  If the upper portion of the disk is
    Amiga format, then even the Amiga will refuse the disk without some fast
    handed trickery directed at track 0.  Mixed DOS and Mac formats suffer an
    even worse fate, since each uses most or all of track 0 for file system
    tables. Split or nested formats are possible; however, it must be something
    like a 720K DOS format written by v1.3 FFS within the lower and/or upper
    portions of an Amiga HD formatted disk via the trackdisk.device, and then
    accessed by a hardfile driver.  Or it can be that the upper portion of the
    disk is a Mac, DOS, or Amiga format accessible on an Amiga, while the lower
    half is a 720K DOS format readable on a PC or a 720K Mac format readable on
    a Macintosh.  The file systems, while they are on the same disk and are set
    up independently, can be used alternately, or can be networked via ParNet.
    The 1440K combined file system is the most useful, but more difficult to
    construct.

    I. A Combined Multi-OS 1440K floppy file system

    To begin with, try the following example.  Using the mfm.device, we format
    a 1440K disk first with the Amiga filing system, and then with a Macintosh
    filing system.  Then we use a sector editor to re-write the first four
    bytes with the Amiga identifier code DosType = 444F5301.  Presto, the disk
    can be simultaneously mounted as an Amiga format disk and as a Macintosh
    format disk.  This is possible because Macintosh uses the zero block for a
    partition table index, and the Mac doesn't expect a floppy to be partioned
    anyway.  However, as both file systems maintain their block allocation
    records independently, it will be necessary to manually confine the writing
    of Macintosh files to tracks below track 40, and likewise with the Amiga to
    make sure everything is written to track 40 and higher.  While this is not
    a totally sweatless proposition, it does come about as a natural behavior
    of the two file systems as long as one writes not too much.  That is, don't
    write much more than 700K in either section, and try to confine activities
    to one file in each section at once.  However, both sections can write
    almost concurrently when the disk is mounted on an Amiga.  Alternate writes
    of complete files to the Amiga and MAC sections are surely possible without
    resulting in file system corruption.  The procedures used are listed below:

	{
	Application	Device Driver	Handler			Name	Format

	MultiMAC Floppy	mfm.device	L:FastFileSystem	AX0:	Amiga
				    and	L:CrossMACFileSystem	MX0:	MSDOS

	Command:	Mount AX0: from devs:Mountlist_AX0
	Command:	Format drive AX0: name AX0 noicons ffs
	Command:	Mount MX0: from devs:Mountlist_MX0
	Command:	Format drive MX0: name MX0 noicons quick

	And do the following (or the equivalent with a sector editor):

	Command:	disked <s:reini.sh AX0:
	}

	[In the file "s:reini.sh" put the following short script, sans brackets

	g0		;read block 0
	Sx		;set hex display mode
	0/#X444F5301	;open longword 0 and replace its content with ffs ID
	x		;toggle editor's write protect to permit track write
	p		;write the track with the newly edited track content
	q		;quit

	                                                         ]
    The Mountlists for the two volumes are composed as follows:

    /* MultiDOS 1440K Amiga DOS-MAC floppy drive for Amiga DOS-MAC HD disk */
    AX0:
         Device         = mfm.device

    #

    Except for the fact that the MSDOS floppy file system IS critically
    dependent on the content of block zero, one could do much the same with
    a combined Amiga-MSDOS 1440K HD disk.  If one is willing to edit the
    boot block before carrying the disk to an MSDOS machine, then the same
    technique may also be applied to an MSDOS 1440K format, given equivalent
    changes with respect to the L:MultiDosFilesystem in place of Consultron's
    L:CrossMACFileSystem in the mountlist:

	{
	Application	Device Driver	Handler			Name	Format

	MultiDOS Floppy	mfm.device	L:FastFileSystem	AX0:	Amiga
				    and	L:MultiDosFilesystem	DX0:	MSDOS

	Command:	Mount AX0: from devs:Mountlist_AX0
	Command:	Format drive AX0: name AX0 noicons ffs
	Command:	Mount DX0: from devs:Mountlist_DX0
	Command:	PcFormat drive DX0: name DX0 noicons quick -fF0Standard:

	And do the following (or the equivalent with a sector editor):

	Command:	disked <s:reini.sh AX0:
	}

	Note that the "F0Standard:" entry in the Mount Procedures section above
	must be present in the file "s:PcFormat.spc" for PcFormat to succeed.
	Both the Amiga and the MS-DOS sections of the disk will remain mounted
	as long as the disk is in the HD drive, which is assumed to be the
	Amiga's unit 0 drive.  The mountlist follows:


	[See above MultiMAC exercise for description of a reini.sh script file]
	[and the AX0 mountlist for the Amiga FFS file system on a 1440K floppy]

    /* MultiDos 1440K MSDOS floppy device for dual Amiga-MSDOS HD disk */

         Flags          = 0
         Surfaces       = 2
         BlocksPerTrack = 18
         Reserved       = 1
         Interleave     = 0
    /*   SecOrg         = 1 */
         LowCyl         = 0
         HighCyl        = 79
         FileSystem     = L:MultiDosFilesystem
         Buffers        = 30
         BufMemType     = 1         /* 1=PUBLICMEM / 3=CHIPMEM / 5=FASTMEM */
         Stacksize      = 4000
         Priority       = 4
         GlobVec        = -1

         Mount          = 1
    #

    If the first longword of the disk is reset to EB 3C 90 43 before removal,
    this disk can be ejected and taken to a DOS machine, and the DOS part can
    be read directly without additional change or patching of the file systems.
    Now being as the Amiga can write to either type of disk without all this
    mucking about in hyperspace these days, it's difficult to see what use all
    of this might happen to be.  But do realize that you can swap MAC and DOS
    HD floppy disks used in maintaining MultiOS system documentation quickly,
    having only to use the AmigaDOS DiskChange command for each device to
    introduce new volumes as you work your way through a documentation update
    procedure.  It is possible to build a protection file in each section that
    will protect against the Amiga writing in the DOS reserved section, and
    vice-versa.  However, the blocks allocated to the protection files must be
    deliberately placed on the disk (without a block-addressing disk writer,
    accomplishing this is a difficult endeavor).  An example of the directory
    lists for such an arrangement follows:

    MAC-AMIGA disk:

    Directory of MX0:
       MultiDosAFFSimg          ----r-e-  736256 1438  02-Jul-96 08:23:23

    Directory of AX0:
       mdosbblk.bin             ----r---    1024    2  02-Jul-96 07:03:49
       mdosfsys.bin             ----r---   23552   46  02-Jul-96 07:09:19
       mdosdata.bin             ----r---  712704 1411  02-Jul-96 07:18:23
       mdosmdir.bin             ----r---    1024    2  02-Jul-96 07:29:54

    MSDOS-AMIGA disk:

    Directory of DX0:
       MDOSAFFS.BIN             ----r-e-  737280 1440  05-Jun-96 16:41:42

    Directory of AX0:
       mdosbblk.bin             ----r---    1024    2  05-Jun-96 17:26:51
       mdosfils.bin             ----r---   16896   33  05-Jun-96 17:31:45
       mdosdata.bin             ----r---  720384 1426  05-Jun-96 18:10:57

    The files are listed in the order installed on the disks.  The bblk is
    a dummy boot block file because the Amiga filesystem cannot access its
    own boot block.  The DOS bblk is double linked so that the lowest block
    of the first FAT is actually taken from the lowest block of the second
    FAT (an Amiga file system rectification tool would complain concerning
    this).  The fsys files cover the file system allocation blocks and the
    file content pointers.  The data files cover the actual file data blocks.

    II. Independent 720K Multi-OS Volume Environments on a 1440K HD Floppy

    Warning: the following is more an intellectual learning execise than it is
    anything useful.  If you follow it through, though, you will learn more
    about Amiga Multi-OS floppy operations than you ever really wanted to know.
    Below are some independent 720K Multi-OS Vol pairs on a 1440K HD Floppy.
    The largest file size for these half-disk HD floppy volumes is as follows:

							Largest File:
	Volume	Format	Sectors/Track	Device		Bytes	Blocks

	DFA,DFB	AmigaFFS	22   trackdisk.device	886272	1731
	DFV,DFW AmigaOFS	18	mfm.device	691008	1416
	DFX,DFY	AmigaFFS	18	mfm.device	725504	1417
	DFZ     AmigaOFS	22   trackdisk.device	844728	1731
	FHA,FHB	MSDOS		22   trackdisk.device	893952	1746
	MFA,MFB	MAC		18	mfm.device	720896	1408
	MSA,MSB	MSDOS		18	mfm.device	730112	1426

    Following are procedures for mounting and formatting dual-volume HD disks.
    Note that the "Formit" command is the AmigaDOS Version 1.3 "Format" command
    renamed, and that the mounting procedure for for the Macintosh lower (A)
    volume is somewhat more involved than is the MSDOS file system setup, since
    an intermediate volume must be mounted, formatted, and DiskCopy then must
    be used to load the format onto the disk.

    IV. Extended Trackdisk MultiDosFilesystem Floppy Configurations

	The Amiga is capable of writing extended size MS-DOS file systems on
	floppy disk.  The MultiDos PcFormat supports numerous configurations:

	MultiDos MS-DOS trackdisk formats (for <= 8n.3e char file & dir names):

	BPC is Blocks Per Cluster, equivalent to "SectorsPerCluster" for DOS.
	The mounting and formatting procedure is the same for all the above
	volumes.  Mountlists are similar to examples provided below for other
	extended-track floppy file systems, except that for this section the
	mountlist must have a "FileSystem = MultiDosFilesystem" entry.  Floppy
	hardfiles or ram disks may be configured for these file systems by the
	methods described in earlier sections of this document.  The procedure
	and the PcFormat.spc file entries for the depicted formats are given
	next:

	{
	Application	Device Driver	Handler			Name	Format

	MultiDos Floppy	  <various>     L:MultiDosFilesystem    Mdtn:   MSDOS
								"Where dt is
								 device type
								 DS =  double
								       cluster
								  diskspare fmt
								 SS =  single
								       cluster
								  diskspare fmt
								 DD =  80 track
								  diskspare fmt
								 TS =  extended
								  trunktusk fmt
								 TT =  Elephant
								 file supervisor
								  trunktusk fmt
								 And n is the
								 unit number"
	Command: Mount Mdtn: from devs:Mountlist_Mdtn
	Command: PcFormat drive Mdtn: name "Volume Name" NOICONS AMIGA -f<spec>

    V.  Notes, Procedures and Mountlists for Sections III and IV above

	*   Unfortunately, the upper-half offset of the "B" section in the
	    mountlist is ignored by the PFS.  The Format and Formit commands
	    fail; the root block and file system structure end up in track 0
	    without regard for what the mountlist says.  Even use of another
	    method of formatting a volume such as making two hardfiles of the
	    correct length for the upper and lower sections, then JOINing them
	    as one longer hardfile and then using DiskCopy to get them from
	    the hardfile to the HD floppy does not work.  A disk preformatted
	    in this way, even, is recognized as two identical lower-half HD
	    floppy volumes.  The recognition is followed by an immediate system
	    crash.  It's too bad, but the PFS will, in this case, not seem to
	    keep the "B" section file system information where the mountlist
	    says the sub-volume's root block should be located.  These upper-
	    half PFS volumes will not be functional until the PFS is revised
	    to consider more carefully the content of the mountlist.

	%   The ProfessionalFileSystem is found as "pfs95.lha" in the disk/misc
	    directory of Aminet Set #1, Disk D.  Included is DiskSpare2.2 in
	    the "tools" directory of the archive.

	+   The Elephant File Supervisor (which is merely a floppy disk
	    husbandry system for after-the-fact computation of disk-wide
	    cyclic-redundancy checksums on a block-by-block basis) adds
	    block checksums as per a schedule algorithm; the checksums are
	    written to a file maintained in cylinders above track 79 by the
	    ElephantFileSupervisor, invoked manually or via a cron entry.
	    Mounted as an RDB-like trailing storage partition, this segment
	    of the system optionally adds back to the fast file system an
	    important part of the redundancy lost from the OldFileSystem.
	    Thus the "file system" portion referenced for this setup is
	    really just an independent renamed AmigaDOS FastFileSystem; the
	    the Version 1.3 FFS (OFFSFileSystem) is used for these exercises
	    because file overhead blocks in that system are near to the root
	    track and can be more easily picked up in only a few reads and
	    then made available in an expanded buffer cache.

	$   Unfortunately, the MultiDosFilesystem is not compatible with the
	    diskspare.device for any known configuration.  The PcFormat.spc
	    entries work just fine with PcFormat and the fmsdisk.device for
	    hardfiles, and PcFormat even succeeds in formatting floppies that
	    have been mounted via a mountlist with a diskspare.device entry.
	    In accordance with the supplied "-f" option specification, PcFormat
	    does its job, though it does issue "error 0" at the conclusion of
	    the formatting operation.  Nevertheless, the mounted volumes cannot
	    be accessed in the way typically possible for mounted file systems.
	    Similarly, the CrossDOSFileSystem also fails to recognize the
	    diskspare.device (even though the diskspare.device does  work
	    with the OFS, FFS and PFS).  In order to utilize the MDDn:, MSSn:,
	    or MDSn: devices, one must copy the device mountlist and edit the
	    copy to substitute the fmsdisk.device for the diskspare.device,
	    mount a mirror (image) hardfile, and load/use the hardfile until
	    ready for backup to floppy.  Then one can mount the corresponding
	    floppy device (and, if the floppy was not formatted as a diskspare
	    disk, use PcFormat to format it) then DiskCopy the hardfile to the
	    floppy for cold storage.  Retrieval is accomplished by mounting
	    both devices and invoking DiskCopy from the floppy back to the
	    hardfile.  One must want very badly for the storage to be in an
	    MS-DOS format in order to be willing to put up with this, since
	    the PFS works just fine with the diskspare device, and can be
	    routinely used with DD and HD floppies, even while providing the
	    filenotes feature and the long 30 character Amiga file names!

	@   Obsolete Version 2.0 of the diskspare.device, may be found as
	    "DskSpr20.lha" in the disk/misc directory of Aminet Set #1,
	    Disk D.  A very necessary post-release is DiskSpare2.2, part of
	    the Professional File System archive referenced above.  The
	    diskspare.device ignores the BlocksPerTrack informtion in the
	    mountlist when it is greater than 81.  Also SectorsPerTrack must
	    be 12/24 for diskspare to work; attempting to use "11/22" fails.
	    Note that ALL automatic DD/HD acceptance for Amiga high-density
	    drives from a mountfile or mountlist that has, say, a DD entry
	    for "BlocksPerTrack" occurs via the trackdisk.device and no other
	    device.  Every other device must be mounted as DD or as HD and
	    cannot change after mounting.  To provide this function, the
	    diskspare.device docs say that a patch to trackdisk.device was
	    necessary; for this patch to work, the diskspare.device must be
	    mounted in the User-startup.  Otherwise, mountlists must be
	    specifically DD or HD as are the mountlists (generally speaking)
	    in this FAQ.

	&   The trunktusk.device is a patched hackdisk.device module.
	    HackDisk 2.02 is found on Aminet Set #1, disk D; the patch allows
	    access to tracks 80 and 81.  After November 1996, look for it on
	    Aminet in the disk/misc directory.

	#   The trackdisk.device may be used for any applications utilizing
	    track addresses 00-39 or 00-79; also 40-79 may be used, exclusive
	    of the PFS.  Note that the native trackdisk.device is faster than
	    the hackdisk.device (and its associated autoverify read-back cycle)
	    functioning  without the hazard of access collisions with a floppy
	    in a drive other than unit 0.  These difficulties are of course
	    circumventable via the hackdisk.device exec list loading procedures
	    which substitute the hackdisk.device (or trunktusk.device) for the
	    trackdisk.device, as described in the the HackDisk documentation.
	    Note however, that the hackdisk.device and the trunktusk.device do
	    write verification automatically with each track write.  Because of
	    this they are slower than the trackdisk.device, but a reliable file
	    system would of course need this feature.  As well, all three of
	    the devices handle either the FastFileSystem or the OldFileSystem
	    in a format command with or without (respectively) the command's
	    "FFS" keyword, and accomplish this transparently when there was no
	    "FileSystem" or "DosType" entry provided in the mount file (or the
	    mountlist).  Note also that the "Format" command, reports activity
	    as in tracks "0 to 39" for either the upper half or the lower half
	    of the floppy with these volumes as described.  The aforementioned
	    "Formit" command (which is really just the AmigaDOS V1.3 "Format"
	    command renamed) which is used for the OFFSFileSystem (which is
	    actually just the former V1.3 AmigaDOS FastFileSystem) reports its
	    activity as for tracks "0 to 39" in the lower half of the floppy,
	    and as for tracks "40 to 79" in the upper half of the floppy, with
	    either of the trackdisk.device or the hackdisk.device and "0 to 39"
	    or "40 to 81" with the the trunktusk.device or the diskspare.device
	    when they are used, respectively, for the lower-half or upper-half
	    of a floppy format which includes the extended cylinders.

    }\/{    Three-letter devices in this list are prepared by composing
    }/\{    a mountlist containing no "FileSystem", "DosType", or "GlobVec"
	    entries.  The format type is defined at the time the "Format"
	    command is issued, via omitting or including the "FFS" keyword.
	    A four-letter device name containing a letter replacing the "x"
	    with "D", "F" or "P", as in the sequence following, will
	    need (for D) a "DosType = 0x444f5300" entry, or including (for
	    F) the "DosType = 0x444f5301" and "GlobVec = -1" entries will
	    load the "FastFileSystem", and including this FFS DosType and
	    (for P) the "FileSystem = OFFSFileSystem" entry will load the
	    AmigaDOS V1.3 FFS module, obtained as discussed elsewhere in
	    this and other sections of this document.

    PC floppy disk hardware drivers cannot read trackdisk format, since that
    format has no sector gaps (though it does have unused sector headers).
    The PC hardware is able to read the 18 sector/track MFM formats when the
    appropriate software handler can be obtained and installed via a CONFIG.SYS
    file entry.  Generally speaking, all the dual HD MSDOS floppies discussed
    in this document can be transferred to PCs without modification.  However,
    invoking the Norton Disk Doctor utility (NDD) will bring up a requester
    stating that the boot block is invalid (mostly because the PcFormat routine
    did not write boot code into the boot block).  Allowing NDD to fix the boot
    block will incapacitate the volume, since NDD will relentlessly reset the
    sectors per track from 18 to 9.  This can be easily overcome by simply
    putting it back to 18 with the Norton DiskEdit program.
    
    The use of other formats in the Amiga, such as Amiga PFS, is of course easy
    to accomplish.  This is the case with the exception of the problem of
    formatting these volumes to begin with.  However, once the media is known
    to be good, a format may be placed on the volume by means of DiskCopy of a
    suitable hardfile image to the media, and then the floppy volume can be
    used without further difficulty.  Note that it is also possible to have a
    semi-overlapped file system prepared via formatting a floppy as a 1440K
    PC volume, then formatting the upper half as an 18- sector per track file
    system in Amiga OFS format, then entering the entire upper half of the PC
    volume as one file in the PC root directory in order to allow image file
    access of the volume for the Unix Amiga Emulator (UAE).

20. How can I make image file copies of floppy disks and hardfiles?

    The simplest way to make an image copy of a floppy is to use a block-
    read device handler; i.e., Use one of the following utilities to copy
    the floppy to RAM:; remove the original floppy and replace it with an
    empty floppy formatted via the same device, and then use the device
    handler to copy the image file back to to the empty floppy in the same
    device to get the same volume name and date for the copy.  Following
    is a list of programs which are block-read/write device handlers:

	Program		File Type	Device Type	Archive

	PackDev		LhA, LhZ, ZIP	XPK packer	AmiNet Set #1
	DevBlocks	Uncompressed	handler		AmiNet Set #2
	Device-Handler	Uncompressed	handler		AmiNet Set #1
	RawDiskHandler	Uncompressed	handler		AmiNet Set #1
	DD		Uncompressed	handler		AmiNet Set #1
	Flat		Uncompressed	handler		Fish Disk 535

    Not all of these work adequately with a Macintosh 800K drive attached to
    AMax hardware, however.  The "Flat" handler does work with AMax hardware
    for the CrossMAC MAC2: device.  Another method of making identical image
    Macintosh 800K disks is to use the CrossMAC version 1.01 distribution of
    the CrossMACFileSystem via the instruction "DiskCopy MAC2: TO MAC2:" which
    will (while warning that the copy was not validated) produce backup disks
    with the same volume date as the original.  Interestingly enough, while
    later versions of CrossMAC always re-date the copy of a floppy to another
    volume, when copying from a hardfile to a floppy, they will ask if the
    volume date should be changed, recommending that a change of date is the
    best choice.  So if a same-date hardfile image can be acquired in the first
    place, making a same-date backup floppy volume is readily accomplished.

    Note that DevBlocks is useful for saving hard disk RDBs and file system
    tables for backup purposes.  Realize that you can sometimes edit the hard
    disk RDBs given that you know how to create and read from a truncated
    image of those volumes.  However, watch out for volumes with write cache
    options, including the emphf.device as per other warnings in this FAQ; you
    may not get what you are looking for when you do block-sequential reads
    from those devices, and you may even destroy them if they are active on
    the emulator side while you are trying to read them from the Amiga side.
    This is a hazard which is in the same instance a system compatibility
    failure and a system co-compatibility failure.

    Another method for obtaining an image copy involves generating mountlists
    for both devices with the "FileSystem" and "DosType" entries deleted.  When
    the volumes are mounted, there may not be icons for them (or you may get
    "NDOS" icons) but you can succeed in obtaining an image copy via the
    DiskCopy command from the hardfile to the Mac floppy drive.  CrossMAC won't
    redate the copy, since no other volume seen by the CrossMAC file system
    will have the date.  The mountlist used must, however,  have the correct
    driver and sector/track information, or DiskCopy will refuse to make the
    copy.

    With CrossMAC any disk you copy from one unit to another will end up with
    the date set to the current date on the copy.  Thus it won't be a "real"
    copy in so far as some Macintosh install programs are concerned.  If you
    are depending on backup floppies, and you have a source floppy disk error
    in the middle of processing disk 14 of a 16 disk set, and your backup is
    not a "real" copy, the Mac will just keep asking for the one who's date
    it has memorized, for instance.  However, it is the situation that for
    CrossMAC, anyway, that if you use their "DiskCopy" program and issue the
    the command from some unit to a hardfile device with the same format,
    i.e., DiskCopy MAC0: TO MFH0: you will get a disk copy with identical
    directories, though the volume date of the copy will be the current date.
    If the Mountlist for a hardfile is the same as is used for the mounted
    real Mac drive connected to your A-MaxII cartridge (or ZorroII board)
    you can issue the command:

			DiskCopy MAC2: TO MFH2:

    To obtain a hardfile copy of the original 800K Mac format floppy disk.
    Similarly, you can use:

			DiskCopy MFH2: TO MAC2:

    and make reliable backups of your Macintosh system installation disks.
    Using a Mac (or mac emulator for that matter) and opening the source and
    destination disks to windows, then dragging the files and folders from
    the source disk window to the destination disk window may not work.  This
    can lead to some difficulty, i.e., icons, such as the Install icon itself
    may not appear when you insert the copy in the target AMAX floppy drive.
    Making AMAX format backups of these disks is, though, a substantial task.

    MAKING AMAX FORMAT BACKUPS OF 800K MACINTOSH FORMAT DISKS:

    With a standard DD Amiga floppy DF1: and an AMAX 800K Mac floppy DF2:

    Instead of this:

    "1> DiskCopy MAC2: TO MAC1:
    DiskCopy Failure: Disks in devices MAC2 and MAC1 are not of
    the same size and cannot be copied to
    one another."

    which evidently doesn't do what we want, can be circumvented, believe it
    or not...

    Try this:

    From a fresh boot-up,
    double click the CrossMAC MAC2 and MAC1 icons in the DOSDrivers drawer
    to mount the hardware disks.  If you have files named Unit1 and/or Unit2
    in your HFD: directory and you want to keep them, you can temporarily
    rename them U1 and/or U2 so they won't be erased and replaced with content
    from the following procedure.  Having saved Unit1 and Unit2, enter commands
    as follows:

    1> Assign FMS: HD1:HFD
    1> Mount MFH2: from devs:Mountlist_MFH2
    1> Format drive MFH2: name AMX2 noicons
    Insert disk to be formatted in device MFH2 [Sokay - hardfile's in there!]
    Press RETURN to begin formatting or CTRL-C to abort:	[<CR>]

    Formatting/Verifying cylinder 0, 0 to go
    Initializing disk...

     The previous procedure makes a MAC format hardfile HFD:Unit2, 819200 bytes.
     Place the Macintosh format 800K source disk in the Mac drive connected to
     the AMAX ROM / Mac Floppy drive cartridge, and place a blank disk in the
     DF1:/MAC1: floppy drive.  The following command will want to allocate
     about 1.6 Meg of ram in order to copy the Mac floppy to the hardfile:

    1> DiskCopy MAC2: TO MFH2:
    Insert disk to copy from (SOURCE disk) in device MAC2
    Insert disk to copy to (DESTINATION disk) in device MFH2
    Press RETURN to begin copying or CTRL-C to abort:
    Reading/Verifying   cylinder 0, 0 to go

     If you wish to have a different date on the target floppy, leave the Mac
     floppy in the drive, and CrossDOS will subsequently allow redating the
     target disk via a requester asking if you want to redate the target.

     After the copy has been made, note the following:
     It is now necessary to disassociate the hardfile from the MFH2: definition,
     so you need to rename and remount the hardfile as MFH1, then format the
     target AMAX floppy:

    1> Assign MFH2: DISMOUNT
    1> Rename FMS:Unit2 FMS:Unit1
    1> Mount MFH1: from devs:Mountlist_MFH1

    1> Format drive MAC1: name MAX1 noicons
    Insert disk to be formatted in device MAC1
    Press RETURN to begin formatting or CTRL-C to abort:	[<CR>]

    Formatting/Verifying cylinder nn, mm to go
    Initializing disk...

     Now all that remains is to copy the hardfile to the target AMAX floppy:

    1> DiskCopy MFH1: TO MAC1:
    Insert disk to copy from (SOURCE disk) in device MFH1
    Insert disk to copy to (DESTINATION disk) in device MAC1
    Press RETURN to begin copying or CTRL-C to abort:  
    Writing/Verifying cylinder mm, nn to go

     If you did not remove the source disk from the Mac floppy drive, this is
     the time the requester will pop up asking if you want to redate the
     target.  If you wish to manufacture an image copy, you should click the
     "Ignore" box, then remove both source and destination floppy disks as
     soon as possible after the copy is done.  If you want a current date for
     the target disk, click the "SetDate" box.

     Having finished these procedures, it is advisable to reboot the machine,
     if for no other reason than to release the lock on the file HFD:Unit1
     so that you can delete it and rename the U1 and U2 hardfiles back to
     Unit1 and Unit2 to make them available for mounting, if need be.

21. Will we have any trouble with the advice in this FAQ?

    You can bet we will.  Therefore, this disclaimer:  The information in
    this file, while as accurate as I can make it, is offered for entertainment
    use only; neither I nor any subsequently posting site is responsible for
    damage done to data, programs, computers, or peripheral devices via the
    content of this FAQ.  Some cases in point: Watch out for the EMPLANT file
    system when working with disk editors; the hardfiles, at least have an
    even numbered top block.  Most Amiga disk editors expect an odd numbered
    top block, and thus may have problems finding the root directory via a
    simple offset calculation.  Even though the "Reserved" Mountlist entry
    gets set to 2 for AmigaDOS file systems or 0 for Macintosh and MSDOS file
    systems, that won't help the tools any.  You may need to set Reserved to
    an odd number to get disk virus scanners and other tools to work very well.
    Be prepared to read floppy disks using the program that originally created
    them.  The same goes for formatting MAC hard drives.  There's no cyl zero
    prep data on a MAC hard disk, so if you try to mount it on an Amiga hard
    disk controller, you'll destroy the MAC hard drive root directory when you
    try to set it up with HDToolbox.  Use the correct procedure for doing this,
    if you try to do it at all.  For example, see pages 26 and 27 of your
    A-MaxII manual, or get some hints from the PCDisk documentation.
    
22. Where can I get FmsDisk?

    Anywhere Fish Disks are to be found.  FmsDisk is on Fish Disk 294.

23. Where can I get CrossMAC and CrossDOS?

    While there are a few PC# devices included with AmigaDOS >2.0, life will
    not commence for you until you get the real products from Consultron.
    You can contact them by email at: consultron@consultron.plymouth.mi.us ;
    direct the first line in the body of your email to Jay Morgan.  The
    address is:

	Consultron
	8959 Ridge Rd
	Plymouth, MI 48170

	9AM TO 5PM CST Sales/Tech Support/Fax
	(313) 459-7271
	for Tech support (Have your customer id # [CIN] ready...)
	6PM TO 10AM EST Weekdays and 24 hours on weekends this becomes a BBS.

24. Where can I get Emplant and AMIA?

    Emplant is a MacII emulator sold by Utilities Unlimited, Jim Drew CEO.
    The address I have is

	Utilities Unlimited, Inc.
	3261 Maricopa #101
	Lake Havasu City, Arizona 86404
	(520) 680-9004 Voice
	(520) 453-6407 FAX
	(520) 453-3909 BBS
	(602) 453-9767 Orders

    Mac ROMs, by the way, dump ok as 27C64 devices, creating four files which
    then must be merged.  This may be accomplished with the Unix binary editor
    "bed" or an equivalent Amiga binary editor.

25. Where can I get A-MaxII, A-MaxII+ or A-MaxIV?

    Supposedly you can get them through ReadySoft, Inc. in Canada.  Be aware
    that as of the issue of A-MaxIV, the designers of A-MaxII may not be a
    part of ReadySoft or the makers of A-MaxIV.  So A-MaxII upgrades may be
    impossible to acquire via the original source.  This section of the FAQ
    may need considerable updating itself; send me update information if you
    have current knowledge, please.  Until such updates are in hand, though:
    You can reach ReadySoft at (905) 731-4175 from 9-5 Eastern time Monday
    through Friday, or FAX at (905) 764-8867.  Their mail address is:

	ReadySoft Inc.
	30 Wertheim Court, Unit 2
	Richmond Hill, Ontario Canada
	L4B 1B9

26. Where can I get Shape Shifter?

    As of September 1995 it was:

    ShapeShifter3_5 (at least) at the official ftp-site:
    131.188.170.4 or server.biologie.uni-erlangen.de/pub/shapeshifter/

    It may also be possible to
    obtain SS from the Author:

    Christian Bauer, Langenaustr. 65, 56070 Koblenz, Germany
    EMail: bauec002@goofy.zdv.uni-mainz.de

27. What address can we use for the FAQ maintainer?

    You can yet use email -
    hull@ucar.edu or hull@ncar.ucar.edu or hull@hao.ucar.edu

    The address is soon to be changed, but until the end of December
    you can send snailmail to me:

	Howard Hull
	PO Box 952
	Nederland, CO 80466
