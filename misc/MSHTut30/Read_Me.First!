                                 MSH-TUTORIAL

   This is version 3.0 of my original tutorial.  Those of you who already
have the tutorial disk. this update takes into account the newer version
1.56 of MSH.  Its purpose is still to provide an updated archive, MSH, it-
self, and all the possibilities of MSH, credits to those people and organ-
izations, without whom, I could not present this to you.

   The newest change (as of version 1.56 of MSH) are simple suggestions on
making MSH more compatible with AmigaDOS versions 2.xx and 3.xx and above. 
As of 8/98, I have successfully used version 1.3 and version 1.56 of MSH
with version 3.1 of AmigaDOS.  I have removed the DMS drawer and the LHA
drawer from the archive as I realized that unless you have those compres-
sion programs already, you will not even be able to decompress this ar-
chive, if you got it as a download.  I also removed the compressed
WorkBench disk to avoid any misunderstanding between me and the owners of
the AmigaDOS system (now, Gateway 2000, Inc., U.S.A.).

   Perhaps the most important difference between this version of the tutor-
ial and prior versions is that Olaf Siebert has given me express permission
to include his program in my tutorial.

   I am openly declaring that this tutorial and the manner in which this
disk is prepared for distribution, with the choice of the various files
are copyrighted by me, Julian Aronowitz, with all rights reserved.  No
part of this tutorial may be changed, or modified in any way, except for a
misspelling, and must accompany this package; without this, the entire
package looses all meaning.  I give permission for this tutorial to be
distributed only with the accompanying files, as enumerated in the "Table
of Contents."  Without those files, any benefits derived from this tutorial
will be greatly diminished.  Any copying/distribution service (club, freely
distributable service, etc.) may, of course, place/add their logo(s), ad(s)
and information in this disk, if they fit.  They also may use their own
choice of icons throughout the disk, including the disk icon, as long as
the type of icon (project, disk, tool) matches what I have already used,
and that the "info" window shows the same information as found in the ori-
ginal disk.

   The MSH program and files were updated/upgraded as of December, 1996.

   As for additional credits:

         Commodore Business Machines for their Amiga computer (the best of
      the best), and their WorkBench;

         DevWare for their vast assortment of shareware programs which
      allowed me to acquire MSH, 3DLook;

         Bronx Users' Group for their kindness in getting me the updated
      MSH program (version 1.3), and for including this disk in their li-
      brary for other users to enjoy;

         AMUSE (New York AMiga USErs' Group) for the copy of ARP (which I
      use in all my work with the Amiga, in AmigaDOS 1.3.3) and for includ-
      ing this disk in their library;

         Charles Heath and MicroSmiths for everything from the FF program,
      which allows for a more readable system font, to ARP (Thank you.);

         Fred Fish, without whose efforts and collection many of the prog- 
      rams I have used on this disk would not have been available to me.

         Various local BBS's for allowing me to download the needed
      compression programs.

         Those of you who have used the earlier versions of my MSH tutor-
      ial, either by downloading it from a BBS or by obtaining it from a
      disk library. 

   This disk is updated because this tutorial is specifically designed to
make life a little easier for you, the user (novice and expert, alike).

   Inasmuch as I did not do any of the programming found on this disk, I
give full credit also to the creators of the programs and any and all icons
used on this disk.  I thank all for their splendid professionalism.  I know
I must have left at least one person or organization or program out in my
effort to properly acknowledge everyone's efforts. I do apologize for the
neglect.

   "MultiDos" by Kjell H. Didriksen has been added for the convenience of
those who prefer it to MSH.  I also have found additional information very
useful in my understanding of the Amiga computer, which went beyond what
MSH stated.  At this point, I have no real preference insofar as which to
use, only in feeling more at ease with the computer and what I am trying
to do.

   Because LHA has been proven to be more powerful and versatile than
LHARC, and can successfully decompress any file compressed with LHArc, no
matter which version of LHArc, I strongly suggest you use only Lha.1.38e. 
DMS.1.53 is the desired program to use in decompressing any DiskMasher
System (.DMS), LHWarp (.lhw), or Warp file.

   I have found that MSH works just as well with ARP being used in place
of AmiagaDOS commands while using version 1.3.x of AmigaDOS.  This goes
for version 1.56 as well as version 1.3 of MSH.  I also was not able to
get my Applied Engineering high density disk drive to work with MSH as a
high density disk drive under version 1.3.x of AmigaDOS.
