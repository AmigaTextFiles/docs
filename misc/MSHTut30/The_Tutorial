                                MSH Tutorial

   If you are reading this, you are obviously interested in using your
Amiga for cross-development and for transferring files from one system to
another.

   I have included following in this disk:

         1) The complete MSH program including all documentation so you may
            alter it as will best serve you.  I also do not take any credit
            for the program, itself.  Therefore, all information of the au-
            thor is still amongst the documentation.  This is compressed
            and found in the MSH drawer as MSH-156.lha by using the dir
            command while you are in "Shell" or "CLI".  This version of
            MSH is the upgraded version by Olaf Siebert.  It supercedes
            and makes superfluous the need for also providing his version 
            1.3, which were in my earlier tutorials.

         2) Also, the complete MultiDOS program including all documenta-
            tion.  This is found in the MultiDOS drawer as MultiDOS.lha.

                  WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

   After decompressing MSH-156.lha, we must install the program.  Just
copy each set of files from the directories, found with the MSH package,
to its equivalent directories on your system drive:  commands in the "c"
directory are copied to your "c" directory, and so on.  Then edit your
User-Startup (if using version 2.x of AmigaDOS and up), or your Startup-
Sequence (for version 1.3.x of AmigaDOS) with the following:
        Assign MSH: sys:
Oaf Siebert gives some suggestions on how to install, also, in his documen-
tation.  That is all!  You have installed MSH.

   Then, after you have properly added some special things to the Mountlist
in your devs directory, that names and describes the drive you want to use,
or used a mountlisting, as CrossDOS does; both are provided in the devs di-
rectory (As with AmigaDOS 2.xx and up, how you mount a device is your
choice; you choose whether you want to have it automatically activate on
startup, or click on the special icon, or use the shell.

   Do not have a "mountlist"?  Easy to remedy.  Using a wordprocessing pro-
gram, like WordPerfect for the Amiga, KindWords, Final Copy/Writer, PenPal,
WordsWorth, etc., import this file into the program.  Then "block" the
lines that describe the listing I have provided in this file.  Copy it to
a document called "mountlist."  Then save the document as an ASCII file in
your system devs directory with the name "mountlist."  (Remember not to
use the quotes or punctuation marks found here in these instructions.)

   I have found the easiest way to activate the MSH drives is to use the
shell.  Presuming I want to use my df0: floppy drive and my df1: floppy
drive as MSH drives, I would first make sure I had a mountlist entry de-
scribing both drives.  A sample of my mountlist entry is below:

 *************************************************
 *                                               *

 *                                               *

 *         Device = msh:devs/messydisk.device    *

 *         DosType  =  0x4d534400                *
 *         BootPri = 0                           *

 *         Mount = 1                             *

 *   #                                           *
 *                                               *

   You can name the MSH drive any name you choose, MSH does not care.  MSH
does pay attention to the same description of attributes that the track-
disk.device needs.  MSH, though, when indicating "device = Messydisk.de-
vice" and "BufMemType = 1" will use Fast RAM for its attachment to your
system, instead of CHIP RAM, as would happen if you chose "device = Track-
disk. device."

   Version 1.56 also lets you take advantage of the abilities in 2.x and
above of AmigaDOS, to format, write to, and read from a high density flop-
py disk in the 1.44 MB formatting scheme of MS-DOS/IBM high density floppy
drives, provided you are using a high density 1.76 MB floppy drive for the
Amiga.  Version 1.56 will not allow you to do this on version 1.3.3 of
AmigaDOS, since you cannot activate and use the 1.76 MB high density floppy
disk drive, as a high density disk drive, under version 1.3.3 of AmigaDOS.

   The following is my listing in my devs/mountlist for the use of my
Power Computing high density floppy disk drive:

   Notice that I have placed a special number in the "DosType = " line? 
This tells the computer that the disk inserted and the device are definite-
ly not AmigaDOS items.

   The final thing to do is to type, "mount MS0:", "mount MS1:", and "mount
MSLX1:".  There is no need to do more.  Your Amiga is now ready to work
with MS-DOS formatted disks, whether double density or high density.

      OKAY, THE DRIVE/DEVICE IS MOUNTED, WHAT DO I DO WITH IT?

   FIRST.  MSH version 1.56 is designed to work as well under AmigaDOS ver-
sion 1.3.x as in 3.1.  

   USE.  I can now use my Amiga disk drive as an MS-DOS drive, to read
from and write to.  If my mounted drive is a high density floppy drive, I
can also read from and write to MS-DOS formatted high density disks.

   FORMATTING.  Formatting a floppy disk under MSH is a snap.  My choice
is to use the shell command "messyfmt <drive:>"  The command does not care
whether you want to format a double density or a high density disk; it
"knows" which type of disk is in the drive (If you are using a high density
disk drive, the sensing of the extra hole tells it that it is a high den-
sity disk.  A double density disk drive can only format a floppy disk as
no more than as a double density disk.)  Now I have a disk I can also use
on an MS-DOS/Windows/IBM machine.

   NAMING.  Unfortunately, the naming convention is still based on the
restrictions of the older manner that MS-DOS used:  eight plus three or
six plus three (ex.  UFORMS.DOC, MY_DISKS.ONE).

   You can use all your 3.5 drives as MicroSoft drives at the same time
without hampering their use as AmigaDos drives.  Now you can cross-develop
by simply copying from an MS formatted disk to an Amiga formatted disk. 
Remember, though, you will still need a program like a cross-assembler or
cross-compiler to even attempt to make a copied program correctly run on
the Amiga, unless you run a program like CrossPC, PCx, or PC-Task, and you
have an MS-DOS disk.  If you do run a program like PC-Task, then the drives
you have declared as MSH drives, will allow you to run those programs  This
transfer program only allows you to gain access to those files.

   This disk is presented by me as an effort to make life a little bit
easier for all the other Amigans out there.  I again state that I take no
credit for any of the programs presented on this disk except for the   
changes in any script files or other manipulations found in some director-
ies and how this disk is generally prepared for your use and viewing.  If
you wish to get a more complete documentation of the compression programs,
please obtain the complete programs and documents from either your local
user group librarian, a BBS, or a distributor of shareware.

   I would appreciate hearing from you.  Let me know if you like this
disk.  If you would like a custom disk with some other programs or pack-
ages, please call or write.  It is negotiable.
