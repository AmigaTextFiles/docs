    ELECTROGRAVITICS SYSTEMS

An examination of electrostatic motion, dynamic
   counterbary and barycentric control

   It has been accepted as axiomatic that the way to offset the
effects of gravity is to use a lifting surface and considerable
molecular energy to produce a continously applied force that,
for a limited period of time, can remain greater than the effects
of gravitational attraction.  The original invention of the glider,
and evolution of the briefly self-sustaining glider, at the turn of
the century led to progressive advances in power and knowledge.
This has been directed to refining the classic Wright Brothers'
approach.  Aircraft design is still fundamentally as the Wrights
adumbrated it, with wings, body, tails, moving or flapping
controls, landing gear and so forth.  The Wright biplane was a
powered glider, and all subsequent aircraft, including the
supersonic jets of the nineteen-fifties are also powered gliders.
Only one fundamentally different flying principle has so far been
adopted with varying degrees of success.  It is the rotating wing
aircraft that has led to the jet lifters and vertical pushers,
coleopters, ducted fans and lift induction turbine propulsion
systems.

    But during these decades there was always the possibility
of making efforts to discover the nature of gravity from cosmic
or quantum theory, investigation and observation, with a view
to discerning the physical properties of aviation's enemy.

	 -2-

    It has seemed to Aviation Studies that for some time
insufficient attention has been directed to this kind of research.
If it were successful such developments would change the
concept of sustentation, and confer upon a vehicle qualities
that would now be regarded as the ultimate in aviation.

    This report summarizes in simple form the work that has
been done and is being done in the new field of electrogravitics.
It also outlines the various possible lines of research into the
nature and constituent matter of gravity, and how it has changed
from Newton to Einstein to the modern Hlavaty concept of
gravity as an electromagnetic force that may be controlled like
a light wave.

    The report also contains an outline of opinions on the
feasibility of different electrogravitics systems and there is
reference to some of the barycentric control and electrostatic
rigs in operation.

    Also included is a list of references to electrogravitics in
successive Aviation Reports since a drive was started by
Aviation Studies (International) Limited to suggest to aviation
business eighteen months ago that the rewards of success are
too far-reaching to be overlooked, especially in view of the
hopeful judgement of the most authoritative voice in micro-
physics.  Also listed are some relevant patents on electrostatics
and electrostatic generators in the United States, United Kingdom
and France.

	     DISCUSSION

    Electrogravitics might be described as a synthesis of
electrostatic energy used for propulsion - either vertical propulsion
or horizontal or both - and gravitics, or dynamic counterbary, in
which energy is also used to set up a local gravitational force
independent of the earth's.

    Electrostatic energy for propulsion has been predicted as a
possible means of propulsion in space when the thrust from a neutron
motor or ion motor would be sufficient in a dragless environment
to produce astronomical velocities.  But the ion motor is not
strictly a part of the science of elctrogravitics, since barycentric
control in an electrogravitics systems is envisaged for a vehicle
operating within the earth's environment and it is not seen
initially for space application.  Probably large scale space opera-
tions would have to await the full development of electrogravitics
to enable large pieces of equipment to be moved out of the region
of the earth's strongest gravity effects.  So, though electrostatic
motors were thought of in 1925, electrogravitics had its birth after
the War, when Townsend Brown sought to improve on the various
proposals that then existed for electrostatic motors sufficiently to
produce some visible manifestation of sustained motion.  Whereas
earlier electrostatic tests were essentially pure research
Brown's rigs were aimed from the outset at producing a flying
article.  As a private venture he produced evidence of motion using
condensers in a couple of saucers suspended by arms rotating
round a central tower with input running down the arms.  The
massive-k situation was summarized subsequently in a report,
Project Winterhaven, in 1952.  Using the data some conclusions
were arrived at that might be expected from ten or more years of

	      -4-

intensive development - similar to that, for instance, applied to
the turbine engine.  Using a number of assumptions as to the
nature of gravity, the report postulated a saucer as the basis of
a possible interceptor with Mach 3 capability.  Creation of a
local gravitational system would confer upon the fighter the
sharp-edged changes of direction typical of motion in space.

    The essence of electrogravitics thrust is the use of a very
strong positive charge on one side of the vehicle and a negative
on the other.  The core of the motor is a condenser and the
ability of the condenser to hold its charge (the k-number) is the
yardstick of performance.  With air as 1, current dielectrical
materials can yield 6 and use of barium aluminate can raise
this considerably, barium titanium oxide (a baked ceramic) can
offer 6,000 and there is promise of 30,000, which would be
sufficient for supersonic speed.

    The original Brown rig produced 30 fps on a voltage of
around 50,000 and a small amount of current in the
milliamp range.  There was no detailed explanation of gravity
in Project Winterhaven, but it was assumed that particle
dualism in the subatomic structure of gravity would coincide
in its effect with the issuing stream of electrons from the
electrostatic energy source to produce counterbary.  The Brown
work probably remains a realistic approach to the practical
realization of electrostatic propulsion and sustentation.  What-
ever may be discovered by the Gravity Research Foundation of
New Boston a complete understanding and synthetic reproduction
of gravity is not essential for limited success.  The electro-
gravitics saucer can perform the function of a classic lifting
surface - it produces a pushing effect on the under surface and
a suction effect on the upper, but, unlike an airfoil, it does not
require a flow of air to produce the effect.

	 -5-

    First attempts at electrogravitics are unlikely to produce
counterbary, but may lead to development of an electrostatic
VTOL vehicle.  Even in its development form this might be an
advance on the molecular heat engine in its capabilities.  But
hopes in the new science depend on an understanding of the
source and matter of gravity.  It is fortuitous that lift can be
produced in the traditional fashion and if an understanding of
gravity remains beyond full practical control, electrostatic lift
might be an adjunct of some significance to modern thrust
producers.  Research into electrostatics could prove beneficial
to turbine development, and heat engines in general, in view of
the usable electron potential round the periphery of any flame.
Materials for electrogravitics and especially the development
of commercial quantities of high-k material is another dividend
to be obtained from electrostatic research even if it produces no
counterbary.  This is a line of development that Aviation Studies'
Gravity Research Group is following.

    One of the interesting aspects of electrogravitics is that a
breakthrough in almost any part of the broad front of general
research on the intranuclear processes may be translated into
a meaningful advance towards the feasibility of electrogravitics
systems.  This demands constant monitoring in the most
likely areas of the physics of high energy sub-nuclear particles.
It is difficult to be overoptimistic about the prospects of gaining
so complete a grasp of gravity while the world's physicists are
still engaged in a study of fundamental particles - that is to say
those that cannot be broken down any more.  Fundamental particles
are still being discovered - the most recent was the Segre-
Chamberlain-Wiegand attachment to the bevatron, which was
used to isolate the missing anti-proton, which must - or should
be presumed to - exist according to Dirac's theory of the electron.

	 -6-

Much of the accepted mathematics of particles would be wrong
if the anti-proton was proved to be non-existent.  Earlier
Eddington has listed the fundamental particles as:-

    e The charge of an electron.

    m the mass of an electron.

    M the mass of a proton.

    h Planck's contant

    c The velocity of light.

    G The constant of gravitation, and

    L The cosmological constant

   It is generally held that no one of these can be inferred from
the others.  But electrons may well disappear from among the
fundamental particles, though, as Russell says, it is likely that
e and m will survive.  The constants are much more established
than the interpretation of them and are among the most solid of
achievements in modern physics.


	      * * *

Gravity may be defined as a small scale departure from
Euclidean space in the general theory of relativity.  The
gravitational constant is one of four dimensionless constants:
first, the mass relation of the nucleon and electron.  Second is
e^2/hc, third, the Compton wavelength of the proton, and fourth
is the gravitational constant, which is the ratio of the electrostatic


	     -7-

to the gravitational attraction between the electron and the
proton.

    One of the stumbling blocks in electrogravitics is the
absence of any satisfacotry theory linking these four dimension-
less quantities.  Of the four, moreover, gravity is decidedly the
most complex, since any explanation would have to satisfy both
cosmic and quantum relations more acceptably and intelligibly even
than in the unified field theory.  A gravitational constant of
around 10^-30 has emerged from quantum research and this has
been used as a tool for finding theories that could link the two
relations.  This work is now in full progress, and developments
have to be watched for the aviation angle.  Hitherto Dirac,
Eddington, Jordan and others have produced differences in theory
that are too wide to be accepted as consistent.  It means therefore
that (i) without a cosmological basis, and (ii) with an imprecise
quantum basis and (iii) a vague hypothesis on the interaction,
much remains still to be discovered.  Indeed some say that a
single interacting theory to link up the dimensionless constants
is one of three major unresolved basic problems of physics.
The other two main problems are the extension of quantum theory
and a more detailed knowledge of the fundamental particles.

    All this is some distance from Newton, who saw gravity as
a force acting on a body from a distance, leading to the tendency
of bodies to accelerate towards each other.  He allied this
assumption with Euclidean geometry, and time was assumed as
uniform and acted independently of space.  Bodies and particles
in space normally moved uniformly in straight lines according
to Newton, and to account for the way they sometimes do not do
so, he used the idea of a force of gravity acting at a distance,
in which particles of matter cause in others an acceleration
proportional to their mass, and inversely proportional to the


	     -8-

square of the distance between them.

    But Einstein showed how the principle of least action, or
the so-called cosmic laziness means that particles, on the
contrary, follow the easiest path along geodesic lines and as a
result they get readily absorbed into space-time.  So was born
non-linear physics.  The classic example of non-linear physics
is the experiment in bombarding a screen with two slits.  When
both slits are open particles going through are not the sum of
the two individually but follows a non-linear equation.  This
leads on to wave-particle dualism and that in turn to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle in which an increase in accuracy
in measurement of one physical quantity means decreasing
accuracy in measuring the other.  If time is measured accurately
energy calculations will be in error; the more accurate the
position of a particle is established the less certain the velocity
will be; and so on.  This basic principle of the acausality of
microphysics affects the study of gravity in the special and
general theories of relativity.  Lack of pictoral image in the
quantum physics of this interrelationship is a difficulty at the
outset for those whose minds remain obstinately Euclidean.

    In the special theory of relativity, space-time is seen only
as an undefined interval which can be defined in any way that is
convenient and the Newtonian idea of persistent particles in
motion to explain gravity cannot be accepted.  It must be seen
rather as a synthesis of forces in a four dimensional continuum,
three to establish the position and one the time.  The general
theory of relativity that followed a decade later was a
geometrical explanation of gravitation in which bodies take the
geodesic path through space-time.  In turn this means that
instead of the idea of a force acting at a distance it is assumed
that space, time, radiation and particles are linked and
variations in them from gravity are due rather to the nature of
space.

		   -9-

   Thus gravity of a body such as the earth, instead of pulling
object towards it as Newton postulated, is adjusting the
characteristics of space and, it may be inferred, the quantum
mechanics of space in the vicinity of the gravitational force.
Electrogravitics aims at correcting this adjustment to put
matter, so to speak, 'at rest'.


	       * * *

    One of the difficulties in 1954 and 1955 was to get aviation
to take electrogravitics seriously.  The name alone was enough
to put people off.  However, in the trade much progress has
been made and now most major companies in the United States
are interested in counterbary.  Groups are being organised to
study electrostatic and electromagnetic phenomena.  Most of
industry's leaders have made some reference to it.  Douglas
has now stated that it has counterbary on its work agenda but
does not expect results yet awhile.  Hiller has referred to new
forms of flying platform, Glenn Martin say gravity control could
be achieved in six years, but they add that it would entail a
Manhattan District type of effort to bring it about.  Sikorsky,
one of the pioneers, more or less agrees with the Douglas verdict
and says that gravity is tangible and formidable, but there must
be a physical carrier for this immense trans-spatial force.  This
implies that where a physical manifestation exists, a physical
device and be developed for creating a similar force moving in
the opposite direction to cancel it.  Clarke Electronics state
thay have a rig, and add that in their view the source of
gravity's force will be understood sooner than some people
think.  General Electric is working on the use of electronic rigs
designed to make adjustments to gravity - this line of attack
has the advantage of using rigs already in existence for other
defence work.  Bell also has an experimental rig intended, as


	    -10-

the company puts it, to cancel out gravity, and Lawrence Bell
has said he is convinced that practical hardware will emerge
from current programs.  Grover Leoning is certain that what
he referred to as an electro-magnetic contra-gravity mechanism
will be developed for practical use.  Convair is extensively
committed to the work with several rigs.  Lear Inc., autopilot
and electronic engineers have a division of the company working
on gravity research and so also has the Sperry division of
Sperry-Rand.  This list embraces most of the U.S. aircraft
industry.  The remainder, Curtiss-Wright, Lockheed, Boeing
and North American have not yet declared themselves, but all
these four are known to be in various stages of study with and
without rigs.

    In addition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is
working on gravity, the Gravity Research Foundation of New
Boston, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the
CalTech Radiation Laboratory, Princeton University and the
University of North Carolina are all active in gravity.  Glenn
L. Martin is setting up a Research Institute for Advanced Study
which has a small staff working on gravity research with the
unified field theory and this group is committed to extensive
programs of applied research.  Many others are also known to
be studying gravity, some are known also to be planning
a general expansion in this field, such as the proposed
Institute for Pure Physics at the University of North Carolina.

    A certain amount of work is also going on in Europe.  One
of the French nationalized constructors and one company outside
the nationalized elements have been making preliminary studies,
and a little company money has in one case actually been
committed.  Some work is also going on in Britain where rigs
are now in existence.  Most of it is private tenure work, such


		-11-

as that being done by Ed Hull, a colleague of Townsend Brown
who, as much as anybody, introduced Europe to electrogravitics.
Aviation Studies' Gravity Research Group is doing some work,
mainly on k studies, and is sponsoring dielectric investigations.

    One Swedish company and two Canadian companies have
been making studies, and quite recently the Germans have
woken up to the possibilities.  Several of the companies have
started digging out some of the early German papers on wave
physics.  They are almost certain to plan a gravitics program.
Curiously enough the Germans during the war paid no attention
to electrogravitics.  This is one line of advance that they did
not pioneer in any way and is still basically a U.S. creation.
Townsend Brown in electrogravitics is the equivalent of Frank
Whittle in gas turbines.  This German overlooking of
electrostatics is even more surprising when it is remembered
how astonishingly advanced and prescient the Germans were in
nuclear research.  (The modern theory of making thermonuclear
weapons without plutonium fission initiators returns to the original
German idea that was dismissed, even ridiculed.  The Germans
never went very far with fission, indeed they doubted that this
chain would ever be made to work.)  The German air industry,
still in the embryo stage, has included electrogravitics among
the subjects it intends to examine when establishing the policy
that the individual companies will adopt after the present early
stage of foreign licence has enabled industry to get abreast
of the other countries in aircraft development.


		   * * *

    It is impossible to read through this summary of the
widening efforts being made to understand the nature of matter
of gravity without sharing the hope that many groups now have,
of major theoretical breakthroughs occurring before very long.

		    -12-

Experience in nucleonics has shown that when attempts to win
knowledge on this scale are made, advances are soon seen.
There are a number of elements in industry, and some
managements, who see gravity as a problem for later genera-
tions.  Many see nothing in it all and they might be right.  But as
said earlier, if Dr. Vaclav Hlavaty thinks gravity is
potentially controllable that surely should be justification
enough, and indeed inspiration, for physicists to apply their
minds and for management to take a risk.  Hlavaty is the only
man who thinks he can see a way of doing the mathematics to
demonstrate Einstein's unified field theory - something that
Einstein himself said was beyond him.  Relativity and the unified
field theory go to the root of electrogravitics and the shifts
in thinking, the hopes and fears, and a measure of progress is
to be obtained only in the last resort from men of this stature.

    Major theoretical breakthroughs to discover the sources
of gravity will be made by the most advanced intellects using
the most advanced research tools.  Aviation's role is therefore
to impress upon physicists of this calibre with the urgency of
the matter and to aid them with statistical and peripheral
investigations that will help to clarify the background to the
central mathematics and physical puzzles.  Aviation could also
assist by recruiting some of these men as advisers.  Convair has
taken the initiative with its recently established panel of advisers
on nuclear projects, which include Dr. Edward Teller of the
University of California.  At the same time much can be done in
development of laboratory rigs, condenser research and dielectric
development, which do not require anything like the same
cerebral capacity to get results and make a practical contribution.

   As gravity is likely to be linked with the new particles, only
the highest powered particle accelerators are likely to be of use


	     -13-

in further fundamental knowledge.  The country with the biggest
tools of this kind is in the best position to examine the
characteristics of the particles and from these countries the
greatest advances seem most likely.

    Though the United States has the biggest of the bevatrons -
the Berkeley bevatron is 6.2 bev - the Russians have a 10 bev
accelerator in construction which, when it is completed, will
be the world's largest.  At Brookhaven a 25 bev instrument is
in development which, in turn, will be the biggest.  Other
countries without comparable facilities are of course at a
great disadvantage from the outset in the contest to discover the
explanations of gravity.  Electrogravitics, moreover, unfortunately
competes with nuclear studies for its facilities.  The clearest
thinking brains are bound to be attracted to locations where the
most extensive laboratory equipment exists.  So, one way and
another, results are most likely to come from the major
countries with the biggest undertakings.  Thus the nuclear
facilities have a direct bearing on the scope for electrogravitics
work.

    The OEEC report in January made the following points:-

The U.S. has six to eight entirely different types of reactor in
operation and many more under construction.  Europe has now
two different types in service.

The U.S. has about 30 research reactors plus four in Britain,
two in France.

The U.S. has two nuclear-powered marine engines.  Europe has
none, but the U.K. is building one.

Isotope separation plants for the enrichment of uranium in
the U.S. are roughly 11 times larger than the European
plant in Britain.

Europe's only heavy water plant (in Norway) produces somewhat
less than one-twentieth of American output.

In 1955 the number of technicians employed in nuclear energy
work in the U.S. was about 15,000; there are about 5,000 in
Britain, 1,800 in France, and about 1,000 in the rest of
Europe.  But the working party says that pessimistic conclusions
should not be drawn from these comparisons.  European nuclear
energy effort is evenly divided at the moment, but some
countries have notable achievements to their credit and important
developments in prospect.  The main reason for optimism is
that, taken as a whole, "Europe's present nuclear effort falls
very far short of its industrial potential".

    Though gravity research, such as there has been of it,
has been unclassified, new principles and information gained
from the nuclear research facilities that have a vehicle application
is expected to be withheld.

    The heart of the problem to understanding gravity is likely
to prove to be the way in which the very high energy sub-nuclear
particles convert something, whatever it is, continuously and
automatically into the tremendous nuclear and electromagnetic
forces.  Once this key is understood, attention can later be
directed to finding laboratory means of duplicating the process
and reversing its force lines in some local environment and
returning the energy to itself to produce counterbary.  Looking
beyond it seems possible that gravitation will be shown to be a
part of the universal electro-magnetic processes and controlled

		 -15-

in the same way as a light wave or radio wave.  This is a synthesis
of the Einstein and Hlavaty concepts.  Hence it follows that though
in its initial form the mechanical processes for countering
gravity may initially be massive to deal with the massive forces
involved, eventually this could be expected to form some central
power generation unit.  Barycentric control in some required
quantity could be passed over a distance by a form of radio
wave.  The prime energy source to energise the waves would
of course be nuclear in its origins.

    It is difficult to say which lines of detailed development
being processed in the immediate future is more likely to yield
significant results.  Perhaps the three most promising are:
first, the new attempt by the team of men led by Chamberlain
working with the Berkeley bevatron to find the anti-neutron,
and to identify more of the characteristics of the anti-proton*
and each of the string of high energy particles that have been
discovered during recent operations at 6.2 bev.

    A second line of approach is the United States National
Bureau of Standards program to pin down with greater accuracy
the acceleration values of gravity.  The presently accepted figure

___________________________________________________________
*The reaction is as follows:  protons are accelerated to 6.2 bev,
and directed at a target of copper.  When the proton projectile
hits a neutron in one of the copper atoms the following emerge:
the two original particles (the projectile and the struck neutron)
and a new pair of particles, a proton and anti-proton.  The
anti-proton continues briefly until it hits another proton, then
both disappear and decay into mesons.

of 32.174 feet per second per second is known to be not
comprehensive, though it has been sufficiently accurte
for the limited needs of industry hitherto.  The NBS program
aims at re-determining the strength of gravity to within one
part of a million. The present method thas been to hold a ball
16 feet up and chart the elapsed time of descent with electronic
measuring equipment.  The new program is based on the old, but
with this exceptional degree of accuracy it is naturally immensely
more difficult and is expected to take 3 years.

    A third promising line is the new technique of measuring
high energy particles in motion that was started by the
University of California last year.  This involves passing
cosmic rays through a chamber containing a mixture of gas,
alcohol and water vapour.  This creates charged atoms, or
positive ions, by knocking electrons off the gas molecules.  A
sudden expansion of the chamber results in a condensation of
water droplets along the track which can be plotted on a
photographic plate.  This method makes it easier to assess the
energy of particles and to distinguish one from the other.  It
also helps to establish the characteristics of the different
types of particles.  The relationship between these high energy
particles, and their origin, and characteristics, have a bearing
on electrogravitics in general.

    So much of what has to be discovered as a necessary
preliminary to gravity is of no practical use by itself.  There is
no conceivable use, for instance, for the anti-proton, yet its
discovery even at a cost of $9-million is essential to check the
mathematics of the fundamental components of matter.  Similarly
it is necessary to check that all the nuclear ghosts that have been
postulated theoretically do in fact exist.  It is not, moreover,
sufficient, as in the past, only to observe the particles by

	       -17-


radiation counters.  In each instance a mechanical maze has to
be devised and attached to a particle accelerator to trap only
the particle concerned.  Each discovery becomes a wedge for
a deeper probe of the nucleus.  Many of the particles of very high
energy have only a fleeting existence and collisions that give
rise to them from bevatron bombardment is a necessary pre-
requisite to an understanding of gravity.  There are no shortcuts
to this process.

    Most of the major programs for extending human knowledge
on gravity are being conducted with instruments already in use
for nuclear research and to this extent the cost of work
exclusively on gravitational examinations is still not of major
proportions.  This has made it difficult for aviation to gauge
the extent of the work in progress on gravity research.

	    CONCLUSIONS


1. No attempts to control the magnitude or direction of the
earth's gravitational force have yet been successful.  But if
the explanation of gravity is to be found in the as yet undeter-
mined characteristics of the very high energy particles it is
becoming increasingly possible with the bevatron to work with
the constituent matter of gravity.  It is therfore reasonable to
expect that the new bevatron may, before long, be used to
demonstrate limited gravitational control.

2. An understanding and identification of these particles is on
the frontiers of human knowledge, and a full assessment of them
is one of the major unresolved puzzles of the nucleus.  An
associated problem is to discover a theory to account for the
cosmic and quantum relations of gravity, and a theory to link
the gravitational constant with the other three dimensionless
constants.

3. Though the obstacles to an adequate grasp of microphysics
still seem formidable, the transportation rewards that could
follow from electrogravitics are as high as can be envisaged.
In a weightless environment, movement with sharp-edged
changes of direction could offer unique manoeuvrability.

4. Determination of the enviroonment of the anti-proton, discovery


	-19-

of the anti-neutron and closer examination of the other high
energy particles are preliminaries to the hypothesis that
gravity is one aspect of electromagnetism that may eventually
be controlled like a wave.  When the structure of the nucleus
becomes clearer, the influence of the gravitational force upon
the nucleus and the nature of its behaviour in space will be more
readily understood.  This is a great advance on the Newtonian
concept of gravity acting at a distance.

5. Aviation's role appears to be to establish facilities to
handle many of the peripheral and statistical investigations to
help fill in the background on electrostatics.

6. A distinction has to be made between electrostatic energy
for propulsion and counterbary.  Counterbary is the manipulation
of gravitational force lines; barycentric control is the adjustment
to such manipulative capability to produce a stable type of
motion suitable for transportation.

7. Electrostatic energy sufficient to produce low speeds (a
few thousand dynes) has already been demonstrated.  Generation
of a region of positive electrostatic energy on one side of a plate
and negative on the other sets up the same lift or propulsion
effect as the pressure and suction below and above a wing,
except that in the case of electrostatic application no airflow is
necessary.

8.  Electrostatic energy sufficient to produce a Mach 3 fighter
is possible with megavolt energies and a k of over 10,000.

9. k figures of 6,000 have been obtained from some ceramic
materials and there are prospects of 30,000.

10. Apart from electrogravitics there are other rewards from
investment in electrostatic equipment.  Automation, autonetics
and even turbine development use similar laboratory facilities.

11. Progress in electrogravitics probably awaits a new genius
in physics who can find a single equation to tie up all the
conflicting observations and theory on the structure and
arrangement of forces and the part the high energy particles
play in the nucleus.  This can occur any time, and the chances
are improved now that bev energies are being obtained in
controlled laboratory conditions.

     EXTRACTS FROM AVIATION REPORT

ANTI-GRAVITATION RESEARCH

    The basic research and technology behind electro-anti-
gravitation is so much in its infancy that this is perhaps one
field of development where not only the methods but the ideas
are secret.  Nothing therefore can be discussed freely at the
moment.  Very few papers on the subject have been prepared so
far, and the only schemes that have seen the light of day are for
pure research into rigs designed to make objects float around
freely in a box.  There are various radio applications, and
aviation medecine departments have been looking for something
that will enable them to study the physiological effects on the
digestion and organs of an environment without gravity.  There
are however long term aims of a more revolutionary
nature that envisage equipment that can defeat gravity.
		     Aviation Report 20 August 1954

MANAGERIAL POLICY FOR ANTI-GRAVITICS

    The prospect of engineers devising gravity-defeating
equipment - or perhaps it should be described as the creation
of pockets of weightless environments - does suggest that as
a long term policy aircraft constructors will be required to
place even more emphasis on electro-mechanical industrial
plant, than is now required for the transition from manned
to unmanned weapons.  Anti-gravitics work is therefore likely to
go to companies with the biggest electrical laboratories and
facilities.  It is also apparent that anti-gravitics, like other
advanced sciences, will be initially sponsored for its weapon
capabilities.  There are perhaps two broad ways of using
the science, one is to postulate the design of advanced type
projectiles on their best inherent capabilities, and the more
critical parameters (that now constitutes the design limitation)
can be eliminated by anti-gravitics.  The other, which is a
longer term plan, is to create an entirely new environment with
devices operating entirely under an anti-gravitic envelope.

THE GREATER THE EASIER

    Propulsion and atomic energy trends are similar in one
respect:  the more incredible the long term capabilities are, the
easier it is to attain them.  It is strange that the greatest of
nature's secrets can be harnessed with decreasing industrial
effort, but greatly increasing mental effort.  The Americans
went through the industrial torture to produce tritium for
the first thermonuclear experiment, but later both they and the
Russians were able to achieve much greater results with the
help of lithium 6 hydride.  The same thing is happening in
aviation propulsion; the nuclear fuels are promising to be
tremendously powerful in their effect, but excessively complicated
in their application, unless there can be some means of direct
conversion as in the strontium 90 cell.  But lying behind and
beyond the nuclear fuels is the linking of electricity to gravity,
which is an incomparably more powerful way of harnessing
energy than the only method known to human intellect at
present - electricity and magnetism.  Perhaps the magic of
barium aluminum oxide will perform the miracle in propulsion
that lithium 6 hydride has done in the fusion weapon.  Certainly
it is a well-known material in dielectrics, but when one talks
of massive-k, one means of course five figures.  At this early
stage it is difficult to relate k to Mach numbers with any certainty,
but realizable k can, with some kinds of arithmetic, produce
astounding velocities.  They are achievable, moreover, with
decreasing complexity, indeed the ultimate becomes the easiest
in term of engineering, but the most hideous in terms of
theory.  Einstein's general theory of relativity is, naturally,
and important factor, but some of the postulates appear to depend
on the unified field theory, which cannot yet be physically
checked because noone knows how to do it.  Einstein hopes
to find a way of doing this before he dies.

			 Aviation Report 31 August 1954


GRAVITICS FORMULATIONS

    All indications are that there has still been little cognizance
of the potentialities of electrostatic propulsion and it will be a major


	      -23-

undertaking to re-arrange aircraft plants to conduct large-
scale research and development into novel forms of dielectric
and to improve condenser efficiencies and to develop the novel
type of materials used for fabrication of the primary structure.
Some extremely ambitious theoretical programs have been
submitted and work towards realization of a manned vehicle
has begun.  One the evidence, there are far more definite
indications that the incredible claims are realizable than there was,
for instance, in supposing that uranium fission would result in
a bomb.  At least it is known, proof positive, that motion, using
surprisingly low k, is possible.  The fantastic control that again
is feasible, has not yet been demonstrated, but there is no
reason to suppose the arithmetic is faulty, especially as it has
already led to a quite brisk example of actual propulsion.
That first movement was indeed an historic occasion, reminiscent
of the momentous day at Chicago when the first pile went critical,
and the phenomenon was scarcely less weird.  It is difficult to
imagine just where a well-organized examination into long term
gravitics would end.  Though a circular planform is
electrostatically convenient, it does not necessarily follow that
the requirements of control by differential changes would be
the same.  Perhaps the strangest part of this whole chapter is
how the public managed to foresee the concept, though not of
course the theoretical principles that gave rise to it, before
physical tests confirmed that the mathematics was right.  It is
interesting also that there is no point of contact between the
conventional science of aviation and the New: it is a radical
offshoot with no common principles.  Aerodynamics, structures,
heat engines, flapping controls, and all the rest of aviation is
part of what might be called the Wright Brothers era, even the
Mach 2.5 thermal barrier piercers are still Wright Brothers
concepts, in the sense that they fly and they stall, and they run
out of fuel after a short while, and they defy the earth's pull
for a short while.  Thus this century will be divided into two parts -
almost to the day.  The first half belonged to the Wright Brothers
who foresaw nearly all the basic issues in which gravity was
the bitter foe.  In part of the second half, gravity will be the great
provider.  Electrical energy, rather irrelevant for propulsion in
the first half becomes a kind of catalyst to motion in the second
half of the century.

ELECTRO-GRAVITICS PARADOX

    Realization of electro-static propulsion seems to depend
on two theoretical twists and two practical ones.  The two
theoretical puzzles are: first, how to make a condenser the
centre of a propulsion system, and the second is how to link the
condenser system with the gravitational field.  There is a
third problem, but it is some way off yet, which is how to
manipulate kva for control in all three axes as well as for
propulsion and lift.  The two practical tricks are first how, with
say a Mach 3 weapon in mind, to handle a 50,000 kva within the
envelope of a thin pancake of 35 feet in diameter and second how
to generate such power from within so small a space.  The
electrical power in a small aircraft is more than a fair sized
community the analogy being that a single rocketjet can provide
as much power as can be obtained from the Hoover Dam.  It
will naturally take as long to develop electro-static propulsion
as it has taken to coax the enormous power outputs from heat
engines.  True there might be flame in the electro-gravitic
propulsion system, but it would not be a heat engine - the
temperature of the flame would be incidental to the function of
the chemical burning process.

    The curious thing is that though electro-static propulsion is
the antithesis of magnetism,* Einstein's unified field theory is an
attempt to link gravitation with electro-magnetism.  This all-
embracing theory goes on logically from the general theory of
relativity, that gives an ingenious geometrical interpretation of
the concept of force which is mathematically consistent with
gravitation but fails in the case of electro-magnetism, while the
special theory of relativity is concerned with the relationship
between mass and energy.  The general theory of relativity fails to
account for the electro-magnetism because the forces are proportional
to the charge and not to the mass.  The unified field theory is one of
a number of attempts that have been made to bridge this gap, but it is
baffling to imagine how it could ever be observed.  Einstein himself
thinks it is virtually impossible.  However, Hlavaty claims to have
solved the equations by assuming that gravitation is a manifestation
of electro-magnetism.
   This being so it is all the more incredible that electro-static
__________________________________________________________________
*Though in a sense this is true, it is better expressed in the body
of this report than it was here in 1954.

	       -25-

propulsion (with kva for convenience fed into the system and not
self-generated) has actually been demonstrated.  It may be that
to apply all this very abstruse physics to aviation it will be
necesary to accept that the theory is more important than this
or that interpretation of it.  This is how the physical constants,
which are now regarded as among the most solid of achievements
in modern physics, have become workable, and accepted.
Certainly all normal instincts would support the Einstein series
of postulations, and if this is so it is a matter of conjecture
where it will lead in the long term future of the electro-gravitic
science.
		       Aviation Report 10 September 1954

ELECTRO-GRAVITIC PROPULSION SITUATION

    Under the terms of Project Winterhaven the proposals to
develop electro-gravitics to the point of realizing a Mach 3
combat type of disc were not far short of the extensive effort that
was planned for the Manhattan District.*  Indeed the drive to
develop the prime mover is in some respects rather similar
to the experiments that led to the release of nuclear energy in
the sense that both involve fantastic mathematical capacity
and both are sciences so new that other allied sciences cannot
be of very much guide.  In the past two years since the principle
of motion by means of massive-k was first demonstrated on a
test rig, progress has been slow.  But the indications are now
thet the Pentagon is ready to sponsor a range of devices to
help further the knowledge.  In effect the new family of TVs would be
on the same tremendous scope that was envisaged by the X-1,2,3,4
and 5 and the D.558s that were all created for the purpose of destroying
the sound barrier - which they effectively did, but it is a process
that is taking ten solid years of hard work to complete.  (Now after
7 years the X-2 has yet to start its tests and the X-3 is still in
performance testing stage).  Tentative targets ...<illegible>
anticipate that the first disc should be complete before 1960 and it
would take the whole of the sixties to develop it properly, even
though some combat things might be available ten years from now.

  One thing seems certain at this stage, that the companies
likely to dominate the science will be those with the biggest

computors to work out the ramifications of the basic theory.
Douglas is easily the world's leader in computor capacity,
followed by Lockheed and Convair.  The frame incidentally is
indivisible from the engine.  If there is to ba any division of
responsibility it would be that the engine industry might
become responsible for providing the electrostatic energy
(by, it is thought, a kind of flame) and the frame maker for the
condenser assembly which is the core of the main structure.

		  Aviation Report 12 October 1954

GRAVITICS STUDY WIDENING

    The French are now understood to be pondering the most
effective way of entering the field of electro-gravitic propulsion
systems.  But not the least of the difficulties is to know just where
to begin.  There are practically no patents so far that throw very
much light on the mathematics of the relation between
electricity and gravity.  There is, of course, a large number of
patents on the general subject of motion and force, and some of
these may prove to have some application.  There is, however,
a series of working postulations embodied in the original Project
Winterhaven, but no real attempt has been made in the working
papers to go into the detailed engineering.  All that had actually
been achieved up to just under a year ago was a series of fairly
accurate extrapolations from the sketchy data that has so far
been actually observed.  The extrapolation of 50 mph to 1,800
mph, however, (which is what the present hopes and aspirations
amount to) is bound to be a rather vague exercise.  This explains
American private views that nothing can be reasonably expected
from the science for yet awhile.  Meanwhile, the NACA is active,
and nearly all of the Universities are doing wokr that borders close
to what is involved here, and something fruitful is likely to turn
up before very long.

GRAVITIC STEPS

    Specification writers seem to be still rathet stumped to
know what to ask for in the very haze science of electro-gravitic
propelled vehicles.  They are at present faced with having to plan
the first family of things - first of these is the most realistic
type of operational test rig, and the second the first type of test
vehicle.  In turn this would lead to sponsoring of a combat disc.
The preliminary test rigs which gave only feeble propulsion have
been somewhat improved, but of course the speeds reached so
far are only those more associated with what is attained on the
road rather than in the air.  But propulsion is now known to be
possible, as it is a matter of feeding enough KVA into
condensers with better k figures.  50,000 is a magic figure
for the combat saucer, it the is the amount of KVA and this amount
of k that can be translated into Mach 3 speeds.

    Meanwhile Glenn Martin now feels ready to say in public
that they are examining the unified field theory to see what can
be done.  It would probably be truer to say that Martin and other
companies are now looking for men who can make some kind of
sense out of Einstein's equations.  There's nobody in the air
industry at present with the faintest idea of what it is all about.
Also, just as necessary, companies have somehow to find
administrators who know enough of the mathematics to be able
to guess what kind of industrial investment is likely to be necessary
for the company to secure the most rewarding prime contracts in
the new science.  This again is not so easy since much of the
mathematics just cannot be translated into words.  You either
understand the figures, or you cannot ever have it explained to
you.  This is rather new because even things like indeterminacy
in quantum mechanics can be more or less put into words.

    Perhaps the main thing for management to bear in mind in
recruiting men is that essentially electro-gravitics is a branch of
wave technology and much of it starts with Planck's dimensions
of action, energy and time, and some if this is among the most
firm and least controversial sections of modern atomic physics.

ELECTRO-GRAVITICS PUZZLE

    Back in 1948 and 49, the public in the U.S. had a
surprisingly clear idea of what a flying saucer should, or could,
do.  There has never at any time been any realistic explanation of
what propulsion agency could make it do those things, but its
ability to move within its own gravitation field was presupposed
from its manoeuvrability.  Yet all this was at least two years
before electro-static energy was shown to produce propulsion.
It is curious that the public were so ahead of the empiricists
on this occasion, and there are two possible explanations.  One
is that optical illusions or atmospheric phenomena offered a
preconceived idea of how the ultimate aviation device ought to
work.  The other explanation might be that this was a
recrudescence of Jung's theory of the Universal Mind which
move up and down in relation to the capabilities of the highest
intellects and this may be a case of it reaching a very high peak
of perception.

    But for the air industries to realize an electro-gravitic
aircraft means a return to basic principles in nuclear physics,
and a re-examination of much in wave technology that has hitherto
been taken for granted.  Anything that goes any way
towards proving the unified field theory will have as great a
bearing on electro-gravitics efforts as on the furtherance of
nuclear power generally.  But the aircraft industry might as
well face up to the fact that priorities will in the end be
competing with existing nuclear science commitments.  The
fact that electro-gravitics has important applications other
than for a weapon will however strengthen the case for
governments to get in on the work going on.
		       Aviation Report 28 January 1955

MANAGEMENT NOTE FOR ELECTRO-GRAVITICS

    The gas turbine engine produced two new companies in
the U.S. engine field and they have, between them, at various
times offered the traditional primes rather formidable
competition.  Indeed GE at this moment has, in the view of some,
taken the Number Two position.  In Britain no new firms managed
to get a footing, but one, Metro-Vick, might have done if it had
put its whole energies into the business.  It is on the whole
unfortunate for Britain that no bright newcomer has been able to
screw up competition in the engine field as English Electric have
done in the airframe business.

	      -29-

    Unlike the turbine engine, electro-gravitics is not just
a new propulsion system, it is a new mode of thought in
aviation and communications, and it is something that may
become all-embracing.  Theoretical studies of the science
unfortunately have to extend right down to the mathematics of
the meson and there is no escape from that.  But the relevant
facts wrung from the nature of the nuclear structure will have
their impact on the propulsion system, the airframe and also
its guidance.  The airframe, as such, would not exist, and what
is now a complicated stressed structure becomes some
convenient form of hard envelope.  New companies therefore
who would like to see themselves as major defence prime
contractors in ten or fifteen years time are the ones most likely
to stimulate development.  Several typical companies in Britain
and the U.S. come to mind - outfits like AiResearch, Raytheon,
Plessey in England, Rotex and others.  But the companies have
to face a decade of costly research into theoretical physics and
it means a great deal of trust.  Companies are mostly overloaded
already and they cannot afford it, but when they sit down and
think about the matter they can scarcely avoid the conclusion
that they cannot affor not to be in at the beginning.

ELECTRO-GRAVITICS BREAKTHROUGHS

    Lawrence Bell said last week that he thought that the tempo
of development leading to the use of nuclear fuels and anti-
gravitational vehicles (he meant presumabley ones that create
their own gravitational field independently of the earth's) would
accelerate.  He added that the breakthroughs now feasible will
advance their introduction ahead of the time it has taken to
develop the turbojet to its present pitch.  Beyond the thermal
barrier was a radiation barrier, and he might have added ozone
poisoning and meteorite hazards, and beyond that again a time
barrier.  Time however is not a single calculable entity and
Einstein has taught that an absolute barrier to aviation is the
environmental barrier in which there are physical limits to any
kind of movement from one point in space-time continuum to
another.  Bell (the company not the man) have a reputation as

		-30-

experimentalists and are not so earthy as some of the other U.S.
companies; so while this first judgement on progress with
electrogravitics is interesting, further word is awaited from
the other major elements of the air business.  Most of the
companies are now studying several forms of propulsion
without heat engines though it is early days yet to determine
which method will see the light of day first.  Procurement will
open out because the capabilities of such aircraft are
immeasureably greater than those envisaged with any known form
of engine.

THERMONUCLEAR-ELECTROGRAVITICS INTERACTION

    The point has been made that the most likely way of
achieving the comparatively low fusion heat needed - 1,000,000
degrees provided it can be sustained (which it cannot be in
fission for more than a microsecond or two at a time) - is by use of
a linear accelerator.  The concentration of energy that may be
obtained when accelerators are rigged in certain ways make the
production of very high temperatures feasible but whether they
could be concentrated enough to avoid a thermal heat problem
remains to be seen.  It has also been suggested that linear
accelerators would be the way to develop the high electrical
energies needed for creation of local gravitation systems.  It
is possible therefore to imagine that the central core of a
future air vehicle might be a linear accelerator which would
create a local weightless state by use of electrostatic energy
and turn heat into energy without chemical processes for
propulsion.  Eventually - towards the end of this century - the
linear accelerator itself would not be required and a ground
generating plant would transmit the necessary energy for both
purposes by wave propagation.

			 Aviation Report 30 August 1955

POINT ABOUT THERMONUCLEAR REACTION REACTORS

    The 20 year estimate bye the AEC last week that lies
between present research frontiers and the fusion reactor

		-31-

probably refers to the time it will take to tap fusion heat.  But
it may be thought that rather than use the molecular and
chemical processes of twisting heat into thrust, it would be more
appropriate to use the new heat source in conjunction with some
form of nuclear thrust producer which would be in the form
of electrostatic energy.  The first two Boeing nuclearjet
prototypes now under way are being designed to take either
molecular jets or nuclear jets in cse the latter are held up
for one reason or another.  But the change from molecular to
direct nuclear thrust production in conjunction with the
thermonuclear reactor is likely to make the aircraft designed
around the latter a totally different breed of cat.  It is also
expected to take longer than two decades, though younger
executives in trade might expect to live to see a prototype.
		      Aviation Report 14 October 1955

ELECTROGRAVITICS FEASIBILITY

    Opinion on the prospects of using electrostatic energy for
propulsion, and eventually for creation of a local gravitational
field isolated from the earth's has naturally polarized into the two
opposite extremes.  There are those who say it is nonsense from
start to finish, and those who are satisfied from performance
already physically manifest that it is possible and will produce air
vehicles with absolute capabilities and no moving parts.  The
feasibility of a Mach 3 fighter (the present aim of studies) is
dependent on a rather large k extrapolation, considering the pair
of saucers that have physically demonstrated the principle only
achieved a speed of some 30 fps.  But, and this is important, they
have attained a working velocity using a very inefficient (even by
today's knowledge) form of condenser complex.  These humble
beginnings are surely as hopeful as Whittle's early postulations.

    It was, by the way, largely due to the early references
in Aviation report that this work is gathering momentum in the U.S.
Similar studies are beginning in France, and in England some men
are on the job full time.

ELECTRO-GRAVITICS EFFORT WIDENING

    Companies studying the implications of gravitics are said,
in a new statement, to include Glenn Martin, Convair, Sperry-
Rand, Sikorsky, Bell, Lear Inc. and Clark Electronics.  Other
companies who have previously evinced interest include Lockheed,
Douglas and Hiller.  The remainder are not disinterested, but
have not given public support to the new science - which is
widening all the time.  The approach in the U.S. is in a sense
more ambitious than might have been expected.  The logical
approach, which has been suggested by Aviation Studies, is to
concentrate on improving the output of electrostatic rigs in
existence that are know to be able to provide thrust.  The aim
would be to concentrate on electrostatics for propulsion first
and widen the practical engineering to include establishment of
local field forcelines, independent of those of the earth's,
to provide unfettered vertical movement as and when the
mathematics develops.

    However, the U.S. approach is rather to put money into
fundamental theoretical physics of gravitation in an effort first
to create the local gravitational field.  Working rigs would follow
in the wake of the basic discoveries.  Probably the correct course
would be to sponsor both approaches, and it is now time that the
military stepped in with big funds.  The trouble about the
idealistic approach to gravity is that the aircraft companies do
not have the men to conduct such work.  There is every
expectation in any case that the companies likely to find the
answers lie outside the aviation field.  These would emerge as
the masters of aviation in its broadest sense.

    The feeling is therefore that a company like A.T. & T. is
most likely to be first in this field.  This giant company (unknown
in the air and weapons field) has already revolutionized modern
warfare with the development of the junction transistor and is
expected to find the final answers to absolute vehicle levitation.
This therefore is where the bulk of the sponsoring money should go.

@NODE Freedom "Freedom of information Act"

                              -37-

The American Freedom of information Act gives the possibilities for to
declassify secret information.
In Europe and other nations a Freedom of Information Act does not exist.
In those nations it is very difficult to get on free information.

You have to know that the freedom of information is a human right.
See also the declarations of the United Nations Human Rights.

For all activists in Europe and other nations: Watch out for your rights!
In Europe the rights for freedom of information is decreasing by local
authoritees and politics.

So beware of this!

In the nearby future more about the Freedom of information Act will be 
released into a newer Amiga Guide Declassified Document.

@NODE Tesla "Tesla Documents......"

VERY SOON IN AMIGA GUIDE FORMAT

The Tesla Documents are released by the CIA.


Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a great inventor who had lived in the time 
of Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein:

A hand full of inventions from Tesla:

a Telephone repeater, rotating magnetic field principle, 
polyphase alternating current system, induction motor, Tesla Coil 
Transformer, wireless communication, radio, fluorescent lights and so on.

There are more than 700 other patents.

Something about the patents of Nikola Tesla; you'll find them on the
internet at Google Patents, but either on the Keelynet!
See also @{"Links on the Internet..." link Links}!
They are all in PDF format.

@NODE Searl "The Searl Documents"

VERY SOON IN AMIGA GUIDE FORMAT



The Searl Documents are very rare and very difficult for to get on.

John Searl was a scientific engineer who had lived in Great Brittain.
He invented a electrostatic rotating disc which lifted up from the
Earth gravity field by high electrostatic voltages and forces!

His flying disc was confiscated by the Brittish gouvernement ( MI-6)

John Searl ended into a geriatric/psychiatric hospital after this experience.
More about John Searl, see also at the Keelynet!

@NODE Physics "Real Physics......."


VERY SOON IN AMIGA GUIDE FORMAT


Forget all the physics which you have learned.
Because it is all theory.

The real physics is the physics of our present life.

The officials, our secret gouvernements, they know that all theories
are not working.
They will fool you around for to get you under their thumbs.

Very soon in AmigaGuide Format the physics of the reality.
And how to do it by your self.
