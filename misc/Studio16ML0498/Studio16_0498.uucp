Hi Gord! The Studio16 interface is nice. After seeing some on other
platforms, i found that release was a real eye-pleaser. And for its
time, it was designed well for getting some things done.

But if B&P is cluttered, it is because midi programs need to display
quite a bit of information as well as offer control. Compared to S16,
any sequencer, especially one with windows, looks cluttered.

I really prefer user-configurability myself. Directory Opus Magellan or
some of the larger MUI apps like IBrowse allow the user to see what they
want to see, and use the model of control that works best for them.
DOpus probably would be improved with even user-configurable menus, and
it binds a few keyboard shortcuts I wish I could change, but the vast
(99.9%) of them are assignable.

IBrowse allows one to easily move the controls and displays around in
the window, or run only those one wants. FI, I have no navigation
controls, waitanim, quicklink buttons, or any of the other stuff you see
in a browser. It is Spartan! But all that stuff is just in the way for
doing what a browser is designed to do: read html. I can see a large
amount of a page at one time at 1024x768, and there are so few
navigation key shortcuts to remember. So that's IBrowse.

In another prog I might look rather florid in comparison. I would still
want to see lots of information, but might need more controls available
at one time. Each of the best sequencer programs has a nice twist here
and there on mouse use; so do some of the sample editors and midi
patch-editors. But to be able to make your own environment easily allows
the program to be a real productive friend.

It probably makes the evolution of the artist/user more natural as well.
I have tweaked on my Directory Opus setup since the first release many
years ago. As my needs changed or I thought of a better way to do
something, I made it so. If something would be cool, I made that so.
GPSoft didn't need to do revision after revision for the program's
usefulness to improve--they could concentrate on other matters.

An aside:

When one sees the Windozzze 1895 interface, a few things seem pretty
decent. But wow, what opaque windows these are! Someone painted 'em;
file management and disk-management on the PC is a joke! I know that
fits somewhere into the discussion of interface. ;^)

Take care, buddy!

When syncing my AD516 to my 8-track reel-reel, everything works great. Everything is in sync. But the other day we recorded a song.... Drums and SMPTE time code on the reel-reel, and vocals, keys, hats, & cymbals on Studio16. Everything was synced up great, we played it back over and over again, 30 or 40 times, getting a good mix. We dumped it to a cassette.... No problem. Then a week later we load everything up, and played back our recording. And the reel-reel was out of sync by about one frame (24fps), as well as it started drifting. By the end of the song, it was really drifted bad.

Any ideas as to why?

-->I've noticed when you play a sample in the sample editor, it shows up then, but

I've got the same problem. It works with the Sample list, but not the Cuelist. If
you look at the manual, it states specifically that it will show files from the
"Sample List". I guess it's meant to be taken literally.  :>)

Have a look at your Studio16  preference-settings. It could be that accidently
changed the SMPTE-settings to 24fps, while you recorded everything in 25fps
(or the other way around).

Sure thing. I'm assuming you're using the reel-to-reel as your SMPTE master. The
most likely culprit has got to be your reel-to-reel. As we have discussed on this
list previously, using your reel-to-reel as a master is dicey, at best, no matter
how $$$ your reel-to-reel is. I have one of the better ones, which was brand,
spanking new when I brought it in to be calibrated (just to be sure), and to my
surprise, it was running a bit fast.

Ideally, you should be using a hardware standalone SMPTE generator as master.

If you're going to use the reel-to-reel as an open-loop SMPTE master, I believe it
absolutely essential to keep it calibrated on a regular basis, and to make sure
that it's properly warmed up before using it. You've also got to make sure the
pinch roller, and other mechanically strained parts are cleaned, and changed at
regular intervals. Parts wear down, lose calibration, and start to drift. Maybe
the ear doesn't notice, but SMPTE timing requirements are a lot more discerning
than the ear. In your case, the lapse of time was a week. Imagine what could
happen after a year, or more.

I'm going to climb down from my soapbox now.

Off the cuff, perhaps your machine was not warmed up enough during one of your
sessions?

BTW: Keep in mind that if you do get your machine re-calibrated, all the tapes you
striped before that will most probably be out of synch.

Maybe it's the Whether.
If you recorded it on a hot day and do a playback on a cold day the reel to reel
could be out of sync because it has shrinked a little bit.
Even the tape has shrinked, not much but enought to get a sync problem.
Because the Ad516 has no mechanical parts nor Tape, it has no  sync problems when
it is hot or cold.

BTW, did you have a SMPTE time-code track on the TAPE or is it synced in another
way.
Or do you just use Punch in and Out ?????

Which of the 2 is the Master en which is the Slave ????????



Succes with solving your problem.

``I've chatted with you a couple times on the
Compuserve Amiga forums, how's tricks? ;-)''

It's the I-play-drums guy! How's it going? My current setup now is B&P,
DMCS2, OSMS attached to a Fatar 610 Plus Controller on an A4000. And AD516
on my A3000, with Studio16 3.0 'cause there's no room for more boards on my
A4000. Is the 3.1 version better than 3.0? Could I have both of them on  the
hard drive? Could I have all three (v.2.0 too)?

BTW, did you have a SMPTE time-code track on the TAPE or is it synced in another
way.

SMPTE time code on track 4 of the reel to reel

You would think that the smpte reader would produce an error if the tape shunk, but it tracks the code quite nicely!!

Or do you just use Punch in and Out ?????

Which of the 2 is the Master en which is the Slave ????????

The reel to reel is the master, studio16 the slave

Succes with solving your problem.

I think you can have all three on there at the same time.  When I first set up
my system someone in the Amiga Arts forum ( John Abney I think ) was helping me
with some problems and had me try something with ver. 2 and then ver. 3.1 (
turned out I just had to get the newest versions of the custom chips ) so I have
both of those on there at the same time.

Take care!

Hi list,
        Is there really a Version 3.1 of the Studio 16 software or are 
some people mixing this up with version 3.01! (this is the version I
have) If there really is a version 3.1 I'd be interested if someone 
could tell me where I might be able to get a copy? 

Cheers for now.

Everyone confuses 3.01 with 3.1, so I just ignore it.... I think most everyone on this list knows what your talking about if you refer to  3.1....  as this question come up about once every two weeks or so.... :)

``Is there really a Version 3.1 of the Studio 16 software or are 
some people mixing this up with version 3.01!''

No, there is, however, a person (me) who doesn't read version numbers
closely enough! Okay, so it's v2.0, v3.0, and v3.01 correct?

What kind of economical mixers are people out there using?

That would be the logical conclusion. ;^) Ennui, overwork, poor morale
because of no further news of S16 progress--who knows?

I kind of miss the discourse here; but my excuse: blown A4000 proc-board,
waiting for mail-order replacement. In the meanwhile suffering through on
a P2@300mhz, wishing I was using YAM and CygnusEd and IBrowse and DOpus,
and had access to my email addressbook and web hotlist.

BTW, digital audio hardware and software on the PC is proliferate, and
some is quite good--if you don't mind plug-and-pray, unexplained system
crashes and lockups, and Windozzze1895, which encourages needless
complexity and bloatware. (It takes a 8-gig drive on a PC to feel like
you have a 2-gig drive on Ami.)

Take care, see you on the funway!

Hi folks,

I'm still here too albeit looking up from a dark hole of non-functional
Broadcaster ware. National Association of Broadcasters convention meeting
in Las Vegas will be over soon and hope to get some help then. Hate it
that I am not in the throes of massive digital audio editing projects yet
but think it will come soon enough.

I hope I run Qmaster ragged!

Someone on the list recently inquired about mixers, I can't remember
who it was, but I just wanted to recommend you take a look at a 
Carvin catalog or the Carvin web site. I have used Carvin equipment
for years and it is quality throughout and the prices cannot be touched
by any other manufacturer I've ever seen. The specs on their equipment
are awesome and they are not afraid to tell you what they are.

I can highly recommend anything made by Carvin, Guitars, Basses, Mixers,
PA, Amps, crossovers, etc. It is all top quality and the prices cannot
be
touched for what you get. For example the Studio Mate 16 Channel mixer
for
$299.00 cannot be touched even by much more expensive boards, and it is
built like a tank. 

Anyway if you're interested check out their webpage and request a
catalog.

Their products are top quality with awesome specs and componets, I
cannot
stess this enough. And it is all made in the USA! They have been in
business
for 50 years. I have several items including many guitars and basses,
and their equipment is the choice of many, many professional bands and
musicians as well.

Their website is http://www.carvin .com request a catalog and see for
yourself.

regards,

Lee

My Carvin 5-string bass is a tone-monster, has the greatest neck and
materials, looks smashin', and cost 1/2 what the other serious basses I
looked at! Peavey of course introduced a great new model right after I
bought it.

But when you buy a mixer, I think you need to sit down and write yourself
a feature list, like--what is it that you need? Ever since Mackie entered
the fray, there have been an incredible amount of sonically-superior, cheap
mixers. They all have slightly different features or design philosophies,
or implimentations.

Peavey has always had good models for the price, as does Carvin. Now some
good British companies like StudioMaster and Spirit have "cheapies" as does
Behringer, Sampson (I got one of these I really like as a submixer) and many
others. (Not like those nasty Fostex and Tascams that started coming out in
the early midi years.) I prefer companies that have made mixers as a major
part of their enterprise, as honest specs only tell part of the story.

Mackie's original 1604, for instance, is especially suited for AD516 use
because of its routing design, and that is one reason I purchased one. And
a good midi automation option.

But if it wasn't for the Carvin come-on I probably wouldn't have thrown an
answer out this time around either. Asking what mixer is best is like
asking, "What is the best color?" or "Who makes the best motor-vehicle?"
For what--a heavy troop transport, or weekend street stock?

There ain't no substitute for actually thinking about this stuff, reading
reviews, learning to ask informed questions, and then--purchasing and
repurchasing, always chasing the ever-receding horizon of features, specs,
price-point, and status.

Oops! Did I write that last part out loud?

Ahhhh...Carvin guitars are awesome. IMHO they have NO equal. The necks
are unbelievable. Nevertheless, my point was that the SM162 has tons of
features, is very, very high quality, built like a tank and cost only
$299.00. It is a steal.

I have serious doubts that a Peavy or anything else for that matter
could
come even close to the quality and sound of Carvin guitars. There is
nothing
like a Carvin neck for playability and that tone....geez

And I was about to mention the new Ramsa digital board, or the Yamaha 03R.

For the price that is probably true. But the sun does not rise or set in
any one place. (Though now I believe in my One True Bass.)

Whatever, I'm not going to argue with you over this. Someone had asked
about an inexpensive mixer and I replied that they might take a look
at Carvin equipment. That is all. If you don't like that idea then YOU
should look elsewhere. If anyone else is interested then I suggest you
got to http://www.carvin.com and look at what they have and compare
that with other stuff. I think you will find a tremendous difference in
quality and price. If not then hop on out to your local music store or
order something from Musicians Friend, etc. and pay twice the amount for

half the features and quality. It is up to you! I could really care
less.
Have them send you a catalog and look at how their specs are laid out.
Everything is there for you to look at. And of course they have mixers
of various types and prices, but still less than what you could buy
something else with more features.

Hmmmmm....gotta disagree with you here. From what I've seen the Sun does
in fact rise and set at the Carvin factory. Carvin Rules...there is NO
equal for the price.

It looks as though various people are planning to add PCI slots to
Amigas over the next year or so. Then it will just be a matter of
getting drivers written.

I am putting a deposit down for Siamese System's PCI-card Amiga. Since
Alpha-powered boxes with PCI slots have come down in price, having an Amiga
running on that hardware should be inspiring! (But a fast Pentium2 will
have to do, for me). The card is either $500 or $600.

I suggest everybody trumble over to cucorg Amiga News, which will further
point your surf limos at Siamese Systems, since I don't have an URL handy.
I believe the Siamese stuff may be very significant for the future of Amiga.

Whhhho, dude! Swallow the hostility. WHO is arguing? Me (a very satisfied
Carvin customer!), I'm just presenting a few alternatives. It is always
good to have a full perspective.

> Hmmmmm....gotta disagree with you here. From what I've seen the Sun does

So, the deal is: no arguing with turk, but turk can disagree? How 
very generous, definitely a road leading to higher levels of discourse.

I am getting a new high-output power amp. The Carvin one I'm looking at is
fairly light for its wattage, purports to do well with 2 ohm loads (I have
little doubt it does), has a high slew-rate, and is CHEAP! Let me say it
in another way: BARGAIN ALERT!

But I am considering a few others that cost more because (surprise) they
have features I consider useful, and it does not. If I was buying for a
different application I wouldn't desire those features, and the Carvin
would be a shoe-in.

Peavey is releasing a digital power amp that weighs in at 16 pounds in a
single space, can accept crossover modules (not yet confirmed on this
point), can handle 2-ohm loads also--or bridged 4-ohm, and develops
600 a side @4 ohms. It has a digital version of Peavey's DDT circuit, which
is a good, fairly low-coloration limiting scheme.

The fan is variable speed. As the output demand goes up, so does the speed
of the fan. So it increases cooling, while being masked by the audio it is
amplifying. Cool. Methinks this is a great piece in my bass-rack, along with
my tube preamp.

That is eminently lustworthy! But I would settle for what I've got. Putting
more stuff into computers, even with decent breakout-box designs no longer
has the zing it used to...

Whoa greendude, I am not arguing. I simply stated that whoever it

Personally I've never cared too much for Peavy products. I've found

Or Event Electronics' (purveyors of fine near-field monitors and mics)
Darla, Gina, or Layla (http://www.event1.com). The beauty of running a
Siamese System Amiga-on-a-PCI-card would be not having to wait and see if
the Amiga gets a jump-start. One could use so much great stuff on Intel or
Alpha boxes, and use the Amiga stuff like DOpus Magellan to help keep that
unruly Microsloth OS in line.

Also the new MOTU 2408 ( Mark Of The Unicorn )  is another really nice $1000
unit similar to the Layla setup.  It has a PCI card and external rack mount
converter box like the Layla, but with lots of flashing indicator lights. (
oooohhh pretty! ) The Layla has 8 in / 10 out analog balanced where the MOTU
2408 only has 8 in / 8 out unbalanced BUT the MOTU 2408 can connect up 3 ADATs
and 3 Tascam DA-88 type units at the same time and then you can select any
combination of three units at once.  Very slick especially if you have or can
afford several digital tape machines.  Go to <http://www.motu.com/> to check
it out.

Never seen any specs on this. Don't know whether its hardware or software
or just a name that Maurizio dreamed up to deflect attention from the fact
that there seems to be no development happening on AudioLab.

Good way to get some stuff out of the noisy computer environment and have
a decent i/o contingent.

Boy. Tough trade-off. I love balanced connections for several reasons.
But you would have to buy yet another card to handle the DADs if you got
the Layla. You've got the DADs online with the MOTU piece, but no
balanced connections. Hmmm.

Will do. I've had a few Mark Of The Unicorn toys; MOTU have been real
comers since day one.

I think all three of Index's boards (Access, BoXeR, InsideOut) will be
very useful for different setups. For instance, an Access with the
MindEye gadget and a projector would be good for clubs.

MickTinker keeps talking about long-term development plans, too: this
year's BoXeR won't be the last. The nice thing about this is that for
the kind of investment that would normally go to developing three
Zorro cards, Index have created 3 computers. The basic concept of
using Altera Flex chips has infinite possibilities.

Yes. If only that annoying software interface for MindsEye would get
brought up to something beyond Amiga 1988 standards. After that was
streamlined, bugified, and modernized, then using the "Viz" would become
awesome again. (And then tinkering with its midi abilites, just so its
discussion on this m-list wouldn't be totally irrelevant. ;-)

This type of engineering approach definitely will see the Amiga through, if
anything significant happens on the OS, developer-seeding, and marketing
fronts.

Anyone look at the report on Play Inc's Trinity? Looks like a very expensive
boat-anchor for all it's being touted as the Toaster killer. And they have
some annoying credo about the Amiga resting in peace. Sanctimonious
so-and-sos.

Ensoniq's Paris has an external box option with slots for extra expansion to 
support 24 bit AD/DA cards, ADAT, etc. Right now the 24 bit cards 
are available (8 in or out per card). There are 4 each 16 bit ADDA and 
SPDIF I/O included in the expansion chassis with no i/o cards installed.

Assuming all the bells and whistles get finished in the software, and
all the hardware parts come out (things are moving slower than the
marketing department predicts), Paris may be the coolest thing out
there for Mac or Intel boxes. About 3x-4x the cost of the SunRize
cards when they were shipping, but has real time effects (reverb, echo,
compression, expansion), simultaneous 16 ins/outs per Paris card, 
automated mixing of 16 tracks (with 128 promised), and tons of very 
flexible real time EQ (parametric, low pass, high pass, shelving) using the 
custom DSP chips on the card. 

It's almost an entire recording studio in one product, and will be even 
more so when they add MIDI support, (but you can supposedly use it 
along with other sequencers now). If they keep hacking at it and add 
the rest of the effect algorithms from the DP4, create a mic preamp
board for the expansion box, and finish the software, it would be pretty
much everything you need except for a mic, a voice and instruments.
Racks worth of gear sucked into a computer.

Paris includes an external control surface with sliders and solo/mute 
buttons for each track, aux/EQ controls for one track at a time, a 
numeric keypad and a shuttle knob.

It lacks deessing and a few other useful effects, the software
has holes (no MIDI, 128 track mixdown, or precise sample editing
yet), and design flaws (can automate returns but not sends, can slip
samples in the timeline but not by single sample increments, etc.).
Still, what it does do is pretty impressive, and the potential seems
greater than the other systems mentioned.

For all that there are a few things the SunRize card does that Paris 
doesn't. And I gotta say, the SunRize manual is much better than the 
Paris manual.  :^)

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

That's what is great about an active marketplace: solutions in all
price-ranges, and competing feature-lists that give the prospective buyer
a chance to meet the needs of his studio AND his pocketbook.

As a customer of Ensoniq many times over the years, I have had an
opportunity to form a love/hate relationship with them, some via beta-
testing. My read: they have always supplied lots of bang for the buck,
but have--up to now--required purchase of new replacement hardware due to
limitations in the original, or a prevailing "we don't want do that, so it
won't go into the new software" attitude.

It looks like they have a big-league attitude this time around though.
Though I wouldn't bank on any feature promised in software until it
actually exists.

There was always at least one good 3rd-party midi control surface available
ever since Studio16 came out. But in spite of pleas, S16 support never came
about for JLCooper, Peavey, Yamaha, (etc) boxes. So this is a real plus
for Paris. More like what the incredible digidesign community has enjoyed.

The Peavey PC1600--
http://www.peavey.com/division/mi/keyboards/MIDIcontrollers/pc1600x.html
seems to be the most flexible and widely supported stand-alone of this
type at this date. And it is very well-designed (sound wall-wart alert!).

I'm counting on one of the cheaper systems, in conjunction with Cakewalk
6.x Pro, or something else with a real open plug-in architecture. (The V8
stuff probably bears some watching also). I liken the harddrive studio to
(ironically) what happened when EMu--and then Ensoniq--introduced cheap
samplers to the rarified, Synclavier/Fairlight dominated marketplace.
Heck, guys have hacked more useful software for Ensoniq samplers including
the Mirage, than all other samplers combined.

>For all that there are a few things the SunRize card does that Paris

Each system in existence seems to have that distinction. Spectral (still
in Woodinville WA?) has developed some nice cards for the PC since about
'89 or so. But being tied to designs that started back when the state-
of-Gates-Crates was antedeluvian, probably doesn't help against the crop
of relative newcomers.

>And I gotta say, the SunRize manual is much better than the Paris manual.
:^)

I'll leave this judgement up to you; I'm to biased to make an impartial
call. ;^]

I'm reading.  But I'm busy using Studio16 and my newly "souped up" A3000
(OK, I just upgraded to the current chipset and OS, but it seems souped
up to me) to record and edit sound effects for our local theatre group.

So I'm a happy and busy user of Studio16.  I do appreciate this list. 
Just not a lot to say.

Hi Dave! I'd probably be writing a bit less, if my AD516 was not on
"permanent lend". And having the altogether dated 3.1 is certainly more
pleasurable than an even-moreso dated OS. So its understandable.

And it is amazing how little speed difference I typically notice doing 
average tasks between the P2@300 I've been using, and my Amiga. The
souping-up process on Windozzze probably requires TONS of RAM and a
Ultra-SCSI drive subsystem, QUEMM's memory management software, and praying
to the correct God/Gates.

This system is accessing the disk about as much as Studio16 does. HUGE,
bloated progs, virtual mem disk-swapping, poor use of RAM, the inherent
inefficiency of IDE when getting simultaneous-thread requests--I could go
on and on. And I frequently do, as you see here.

On the list we've been waxing on about the bold advances in digital audio
on the PCI buss lately. But I bet the code that every single one of those
cards is run with is BLOATWARE, compared to what Amigans are using. The
features-per-meg index is certainly better on the Amiga.

So enjoy your sporty car, while I maneuver this Mimbari battle-cruiser.

I forgot to mention I upgraded to an 040, and will soon be going from 4
meg to 16 meg (on my A3000).  Sad thing is, I also have a Dell Pentium
Pro 200 with 64Meg RAM.  I do nothing nearly as strenuous as digital
sound sampling and editing on it ... mostly Netscape and Access stuff. 
But it literally *drags* when compared to my A3000 ... at least in terms
of user perception.  

I ask my Amiga to do something, it snaps right to it.  Ask it to play
back a sample while loading another one into the editor; no problem, not
a hiccup.  (This is with 4 meg memory, and no virtual memory.)  I
honestly don't remember the last time it crashed on me.

If I try to do anything on my PC while Netscape is downloading mail
messages, it's going to go in spurts and sputters, guaranteed.  I'll
normally get several random GPFs per day.

Yet which system won out in the long run, except with a few of us
fanatics?

It breaks my heart to think so many people have never known anything
other than the mediocre OS the world is becoming saddled with, which is
only as barely-functional as it is because we've been able to throw huge
amounts of memory and CPU cycles at it. <sigh>

Yes. So what a dream to have that Amiga OS expanded where needed, and
playing back on a fast buss and processor.

Those huge Windooz releases need virtual memory; and it seems to really
drag the speed and reliable operation down.

Well, the type of robber barons at the top of CBM had a different view than
Gates and crew on how to pursue an honest living. (slight sarcasm)

Most people have always been more comfortable with the predigested pap that
comes with mediocre thought. But the power of that marketplace drives an
incredible amount of hardware R&D. Cheap memory, faster busses, cheap
replacement for (admittedly fast) obsolescent CPUs, and lately, the
promise of even denser harddrives from IBM.

The development tools available on the PC seem to be wide, deep, and
strong also. I am sure that programmers have complaints about this and
that, but many also remark that a mature development environment is not too
far from the truth when migrating. The OS supports many things Amigans
tack on via Aminet or extra purchases, or simply do not have (much of it
is not needed on the Amiga however).

Many of the faults of Windozze are not to evident when using a good
application there, and since most file standards (and standards bodies)
come from that world, the user is assured that those file standards kind of
work, most of the time (Microsloth joke).

I believe a successful Amiga marketplace can bootstrap itself with the PC
industry however. Via PCI, third party Amiga hardware, continuing Aminet
proliferacy, user and developer dedication, and who knows--maybe some
unexpected developments from the most unlikely of places: the owners of
The Amiga.

Trying to explain that to people is like trying to explain blue to 
a blind person. That there are actually people defending Microsoft's
"right to innovate" is indicative of the wool over their eyes.

Tis true.

And don't even get me started on the stupid Windoze IRQ limitations.
You simply can't put all the cards you want into one computer, even
if there are available hardware slots. This is merely one example of a
brain dead limitation due entirely to the baggage carried by Windoze.
Yes, even NT.

On a brighter note, the BeOS has just been released for Intel
machines (PPC later this month). And Apple could become 
a contender with the Rhapsody OS on PPC/Intel if Apple doesn't 
screw it up.

It will be interesting to see what the announced AmigaOS
upgrades bring to the table later this year, assuming AI 
follows through with their promises (I've learned not to
count on any Amiga announcements until something
actually ships). Good thing AmigaOS 3.1 still does so
many things well.

BTW, the announced intention to make future Amigas include 
both PPC and 68000 chips is good for those of us with
unsupported "legacy" hardware/software like Studio 16
and AD516/512 cards. Despite the many choices for audio
cards on other platforms, the AD516 will always be useful
for what it was designed for: multitrack audio-for-video 
production, (as well as other uses).

There's a group in Scandinavia somewhere that seems to
be planning to build an Amiga PDA. That would be nice. I
wrote my own PIM in CanDo and it would be cool to carry
it around in a portable, Amiga-based box.

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

I don't think BeOS is much to get excited about. I've seen
it and it is nothing special, and certainly isn't much compared
even to the aging AmigaOS.

I haven't looked at it serously for quite a while. But back
when I did look at it, it seemed to me to have promise.
It is _designed_ for media uses, and it does not carry the
baggage of MS Windows or MacOS. It already has 
some of the things AmigaOS lacks (memory protection,
virtual memory, Intel and PPC versions, up-to-date
development tools, real ongoing development). It also has 
the involvement and input of quite a few folks with Amiga 
experience. 

I think perhaps you dismiss it too soon. Right now, Be
is aiming it at early adopters; developers and experimenters.
When more display drivers are developed and more 
development is done, it may well be a worthy alternative.

Meanwhile, we can continue to use our Amigas and 
whatever other boxes we want.

I would like to see Be, Rhapsody and the next AmigaOS
succeed. It's way, way too early to standardize on one
OS (hear me, Mr. Bill?). Choice is good.

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

Huh? We can talk again after the Apple developers conference,

the movement of the Mac toward NEXTSTEP (his babies
both). The MacOS _needs_ to move on. 

If you have specific sources of Apple dropping Rhapsody,
please point me to 'em.

Well, it is certainly better than Windows or MAC OS, however
as I said it is NOT AmigaOS. Perhaps it will be more so as

I agree. Anything but Microsoft's crap.

TITLE

  QMaster (for Studio 16)

VERSION

  1.2 DEMO

AUTHOR

  Kenneth Chr. Nilsen/Digital Surface

  mailto:kenny@bgnett.no

DESCRIPTION

 QMaster is an ARexx host which offer comands that can be accessed
 from arexx scripts. QMaster provides comands to handle every aspect
 of Studio 16's Cuelist files giving the arexx programmer full
 control and making life much easier for the user.

 The comands allow you to alter cuelist entries, tracks, preferences,
 remove, add, adjust, swap, copy entries and tracks, convert files to
 and from other formats, and in conjunction with other arexx hosts
 you can do automated processes, on-air organizing, connect with
 other programs such as video- and musicediting software, databases,
 networks, multimedia packages and so on, to influence the cuelist
 files and more.

 You don't have to be familar with arexx programming to take
 advantage of what QMaster can offer. QMaster comes with several
 arexx scripts that you can use just by double clicking their icons
 or by starting them from cli/shell. More scripts will come in the
 future.

FEATURES

  QMaster provide more than 40 comands to handle Cuelists,
  convert times, provide requesters, information, resource tracking
  and more.

  With QMASTER you can:

   - create cuelist files from scratch
   - read/edit existing cuelist files
   - read/add/remove/cut/swap and alter tracks (Audio/AREXX)
   - read/add/remove and alter entries (Audio/AREXX)
   - read/alter and set preferences
   - load (add) and save track (TRAX) files
   - copy and paste tracks
   - do statistic operations
   - interface directly with the Amiga's global vars (SetEnv/GetEnv)
   - add progressbars to your scripts
   - add informal requesters to your scripts
   - add file- and directory requesters to your scripts
   - add string requesters to your scripts
   - convert between SMPTE (PAL/NTSC) and seconds
   - optionally auto detect video system (PAL/NTSC)
   - define 500.000 entries (100 tracks with 5000 entries on each)
   - get online help
   - invoke RESOURCE TRACKING if needed at any time

  and more...

  QMaster is written in assembler to achieve optimal speed in
  processing comands and content. QMaster has been through several
  weeks of betatesting and proves to be stable.

  The archive comes with several public domain arexx scripts which
  you can run from Workbench as well as from cli:

   AllToAny       - sets all play/rec channels to "Any"
   AppendCuelists - merges two cuelist files horizontally w/ grouping
   CMXtoCUE       - converts CMX EDL to Cuelist format opt. database
   CountCuelist   - statistic info
   DumpCue        - dumps info about all tracks/entries in cuelist
   FindEntry      - search for an entry by keyword
   FixPaths       - fixes entry paths if samples are moved on HD
   GroupEvents    - search for keyword in events and group them
   ListEntries    - dumps different entries used (one of each)
   MergeCuelists  - same as Studio 16's built-in function with extras
   NameToCue      - for fun, converts a string to cuelist 'letters'
   ReplaceEntries - search by keyword and select new from requester
   SampleTime     - shows SMPTE time in PAL/NTSC (AUTO) for a sample
   StereoJukebox  - puts samples in a dir after one eachother on cue
   StripEmpty     - removes empty tracks from a cuelist file
   TestVideo      - test script to auto detect video system

  You can also find tutorial scripts that show how to use some of the
  comands in QMaster.

Hi all,

Just a heads up note for anyone interested.

We finally have the latest release by the Makedonians TZAZ in our hands.  TZAZ
is a 'live' disk taken from many different source DATs ( and one cassette!  ) A
majority of the DATs are from different performances at KING FM 98.1, recorded
off the board by several different engineers ( hey, they work at a radio
station, they must be REAL engineers! ;-)  a few are from a quick direct to DAT
session at my project studio  and the rest are from various concerts and
parties over the last several years.  None of the source recordings were done
with the thought in mind that they would ever be used on a release and  most of
the equipment I used is on the low mid level end of quality  but all in all I'm
quite pleased and proud of the final result.

-The source tapes were transferred from a Sony 75ES DAT ( analog out ) and a
Tascam 102MKII ( for the one song that was on cassette....the DAT had been
eaten by the original engineers machine. )

- processed with small amounts of one or more of the following:
 Rane MQ302 stereo EQ
 DBX 266 stereo compressor
 BBE 422 Sonic Maximizer
 Roland RSP550 effects
 Roland M120 line mixer

-and then recorded onto an Amiga 3000 with a Sunrize AD516 HD recording card @
44.1 and Studio 16 software.
In the Amiga the tracks were put in order, beginnings / endings trimmed, a
couple pieces shortened by splicing out sections, fades and cross fades setup,
and track to track volume normalization adjusted.

-The final result was then recorded on a Sony R500 DAT at 44.1 via the analog
inputs

Monitoring for most of the project was through a pair of Tannoy PBM 6.5s
powered by a Crown D75A amp.  When I got the first proof back and after
listening to it on several different stereo systems I realized that I had to
much bottom end. I added a Tannoy powered sub ( cuz I didn't want to guess )
and made a 5 db cut 80Hz and a 1 db cut at 63Hz and 100 Hz.


Besides getting credit for the 3 individual songs I recorded I'm given credit
for 'Mastering'  Now I told them that technically my part was more like post
production and / or pre mastering and that's how the art work proof read but
somehow it got changed in the final version.  The disk manufacturing was
handled by Martin Audio in Seattle WA.  There was some communication breakdown
as the people at Martin and I were only talking through the band leader /
producer but I was told that the CDR proofs were made directly from my DATs and
the folks at Martin didn't really do any adjustments.   hhhmmmm....



If anyone is in the Tacoma WA USA area and would like to hear the band we will
be performing at Borders Book store on Saturday April 18th  6:00 to 7:30 PM.




Thanks to everyone in the forum.  I've learned quite a bit here and it
definitely made our CD much better. :-)   ( and if you hear it and you think it
sucks  .. . .uuhhh... mmmm  ..uuuhhhh   if  you're not supposed to eat meat . .
. . ..how come it's food?????? )




 ImJohn@worldnet.att.net
  .......I play drums.


PS - I made sure that the Amiga and Sunrize card are in the credits! ;-)

Whereever this goes Kenny, I want to thank you for your contributions to the

great thing you have done. I hope you will realize the rewards of your
efforts.

Congrats! It is always good to hear about creative people doing something.

Alas, formerly lived in Tacoma area; just left Seattle area a few years
ago. But reading the invite flashed some good pictures of Pt Defiance,
the old smokestack, Steilacoom, etc. (Ah jee, seeing Kenny's announcement,

This is as it should be. Take care, John! Oh, is your CD available
anywhere? Like BlockButt-ers (heh-heh)? I am interested.

I don't recall, but did I mention also that MEN AT WORK
(major aussie band  from the mid 80's)
was back together and using A4000/060/dual AD516's
to do some of their new tracks? They plan to release
a "new" CD this year. "new" because I was told it will be a
re-release of their Brazil tour from about a year or so ago and
is suppose to contain some new songs authored
on the Ami. At least that was the last info I had from
Greg of the band in mid-december 97. Last I heard, they were
headed for a concert/holiday in florida and then planed to
be on the road for a while. I hope to hear back from them someday :)

It will be good to hear some of their stuff again. Have you heard of
Yothu Yindi? That's an Aussie tribal/rock band I shot video for a
couple of times. And they use yidaki (digeridus) too! Tim Finn (Crowded
House) has appeared on their albums.

The Amiga, and Studio16 have been involved in many illustrious projects
over the years. It took true believers to do it, especially when the
"chicken lips" (CBM) were still around.

When I lived in Seattle there was a decent-sized Amiga users' group at
[gasp!] MicroSoft. And they studied the Amigas during working hours too.
Several trade shows I went to Amigas were doing the work behind the
curtains for other platforms (shades of the Wizard of Oz!) and IBM, among
others used Amigas extensively for business presentations.

Here's to continued fun and creativity with the Amiga,

Hi Kenny and all,


I'm out of the woods!

IT"S WORKING FLAWLESSLY!(Broadcaster Elite NLE board)  YA-A-A-A-A-AY!!

The turn came when after playing with different SCSI and device settings I
chose NoReselection in the two configuration programs. (cybPPCcontrol and
SCSIconfig). Amoung other little fixes.

Just to push the video compression to the max to see what it would do, I
tried OverKill2 Mode and got flawless JStream at;

6.86 Megs/sec  - Mean Frame size 228,788 - 3:1 Compression

==============

I now have a total audio/video Amiga digital editing suite!

Now that this is over I can spend more time in Studio16 and get the SMPTE
and overall system network stuff worked out.

Not to add to your homesick grief ;-) but did you know that the smelter
smokestackis no longer there?  It was imploded 5 or 6 years ago.  It was both
a sad and exciting
day around here.  Did you go to school around here? I went to Washington
elementary,
Mason junior high and Wilson high.  Also a couple years at PLU.  And if you
like
progressive rock music you might of seen one of my bands play in the area,
THEATRE
 and / or BALANCE.

I may be a little late now but if everyone who ever used an Amiga had made
sure thatthe credits contained the AMIGA name, it would have help public
awareness and
possibly added a lot of strength to the user base.


RE: TZAZ  - Thanks for the interest! We are just starting to get them into as
many outlets
as possible.  Borders book store in Tacoma WA should have them as we speak and
if you
have a Borders store near you I'm sure that they could do a special order or
store to store transfer.

If I didn't mention it before the Makedonians play Greek, Yugoslavian,
Bulgarian, Turkish, Macedonian,
Balkan folk music with interpretations that range from fairly traditional to
more jazz / fusion like.

Artist           : The Makedonians
Album Title : TZAZ

Catalog #   : MAK 08972
Full UPC     : 712657089726
Category    : Folk / Ethnic / Local / Independent


Or if you prefer, you can order one directly from me for $15.00 plus $2.00
postage.
Just send a check or money order and your mailing address.  ( shipment of the
CD
may be suspended until personal checks clear the bank, at our option.  Like if
the

It's software, Dave. A 040/16MB is the recommended entry-level setup.
The application is designed for 060 systems. Since February we're
experimenting on the 604/060 dual-processor architecture too, but the
first ProStation release is for the 680x0.

Since we talked, two more Tacoma-related mentions came up on other m-lists.
Syncronicity? I went to PLU for 2 years in the early seventies before
deciding to JUST play in Ball&Chain, Cout Cee Lab Band, and the Shaft Club
(on Broadway in '72 or so) house band.

I knew about the stack; was living in Seattle when they blew it.

I like all kinds of music. But Tacoma - other than ocassional visits - was
a long time ago. The only Tacoma band I REMEMBER seeing while living in
the Emerald City was the Malchicks, at the Rebar.

I think we need newer, flashier stuff to really expand that user base.

Borders are only the biggest in the world, along with Barnes & Noble.
Those two own B. Dalton's and Waldenbook's as well, and are currently
under investigation for unfair trade-practices. I hope YOU won't be jailed
{small laugh}.

That is a good way to get things rolling, placement in local outlets of
chains. (New Age oriented stuff seems to do alright in Natural Health Food
stores, FI.)

Ah! I love that. So you are playing all those great meters like 17/8,
15/16 etc? A few jazz groups (of course one of them would be displayed
on Dave Brubeck's ground-breaking Take Five album) have crossed over in
the other direction. I especially enjoyed the Don Ellis Big Band's late
'60s/early '70s experiments in meter, polytonal and quartertone,
"psychedelic" electronic miasmas.

I've seen a few groups also cross the stuff over into Yiddish music, like
the NAMA Folk Orchestra. Cool.

I hope this isn't too far off topic... I've used a Phantom SMPTE 
interface on a 68000 Amiga, but would like to connect it to a 68040 
Amiga. The support software crashes (the system) on 040's! Has anyone 
found a patch for this? Does anyone know what became of Dr. T's, the 
designers of the Phantom? Thanks for any insights.

THAT is good news! Got it on the hotlist, will visit when I get back from
band practice. Then, the deluge of questions and observations! ;^)

Ah, modern! I like it! But I am almost afraid to ask: what is happening on
the AD516 driver issue?

I would like to second that greenboy. I am soory to say that I still
haven't tapped into the power of Qmaster due to getting the video side
working properly. But that's over now and I am looking forward to doing
more audio/music.

Kenny you're a gem and I would be proud to have you add my name to your
list of friends also.

I hope this isn't too far off topic... I've used a Phantom SMPTE 
interface on a 68000 Amiga, but would like to connect it to a 68040 
Amiga. The support software crashes (the system) on 040's! Has anyone 
found a patch for this? Does anyone know what became of Dr. T's, the 
designers of the Phantom? Thanks for any insights.

THAT is good news! Got it on the hotlist, will visit when I get back from
band practice. Then, the deluge of questions and observations! ;^)

Ah, modern! I like it! But I am almost afraid to ask: what is happening on
the AD516 driver issue?

I would like to second that greenboy. I am soory to say that I still
haven't tapped into the power of Qmaster due to getting the video side
working properly. But that's over now and I am looking forward to doing
more audio/music.

Kenny you're a gem and I would be proud to have you add my name to your
list of friends also.

I don't know anything about this software package, but I'm a Draco user,
and was wondering if it will be able to work on the Draco?  Cost?  Etc.

Used any search engines? Although if Dr T isn't even a player anymore, on
other platforms, I doubt support is going to come from him. Other music-
related m-lists (Bars&Pipes) or websites probably could help. I know there
is a 020+ version.

Good luck.

Not a lot of traffic for a bit off topic I guess. We can write personally
after this if you like. But please use my baff@stc.net address.

I've got one a friend gave me with no software also, but I haven't used it
yet. I thought that the Bars&Pipes software drove it with no problem.
Am I wrong?
There is an accessory for it in B&P which I have which comes with the 2.5b
version if I am not mistaken which is at;

http://members.theglobe.com/geoarn/download.html.

I hope I'm not off base about this........

Hey Kenny,

I have learned a lot from the mailing list.

I think somebody must continue the list because we need it.

Thanks Kenny for Q-MAster and this mailing list.

You brought a little usergroup together including some very important
people Like mr Ben Fuller and dr.Maurizio Ciccione.

We all can make the Amiga a surviver,lets do it and keep it alive by using it.


SeeYaa,





Rene'(DSP) Schaap

Off the top of my head I don't remember any in 15 or 17 but we do have 'em in
3/4, 4/4, 5/8, 5/4, 7/8, 9/8, 10/8, 11/8, 18/8, and 25/8! ;-)

I've always liked classical / symphonic music and I'm a major fan of
progressive rock
and fusion jazz.  It took me awhile to get used to Balkan odd times though
because
the subdivisions of the measures were more unpredictable than what I had
encountered
before.

Well, we are still getting things established.  I would hate to quote tolow of
a price and then wind up paying out of my pocket.  This weekend
we played at Borders as the kickoff for the CD release and they have our CDs
marked at $13.95!  Hey, no one told me!  We are looking into get hooked up
with a distributor and I'm sure there will be minimums we can charge,  price
protection
for retailers, etc., etc. that we will have to deal with. For now lets just say
$15.00 from
me and that includes postage.

community which shares the same interrests. I don't want that to disappear.
I must also say thanks for warm words! Those helps on motivation.

Ok, lets party on (or maybe not?.. ;D )

Too late! Brian got thrown in the Clink for violating community decency
standards, and they're after me for ... punching the Spike [yike!]

No, It's definitly a party. Glad to hear we're not being
evicted. With out this group, I might not be sticking
to my goal of being an Ami programmer. 
I'm curious though. If there are a hundred programmers
(or wanna be's) here and maybe another 1 or 2 hundred
professional Ami programmers out there, that make us
a pretty small group. What are some estimates of the number
of real ami programmer able to do major projects?

Gee, Troy this is the kind of question I like to answer with a clout on the
head with a Zen handbook (Ko-ang!). There are enough to do whatever they
think they can do! I admire programmers - they have the potential for
mastery over a fascinating medium (- not the dollar, I'm not talking about
just the dollar, folks.)

The recent trend in Amigaland is for single guys to keep up with projects
whose equivalents on other platforms require teams. This may seem admirable,
but results in user frustration and programmer burnout, as the gap widens
between expectations - based on comparison to competitor's products - and
the reality of what one person can deliver.

I am hoping developers and publishers in Amigaland will realize that their
read on economic solutions is stifles the development of the type/quality of
programs the Amiga needs to go forward.

So I would say to any would-be (sounds nicer to me than wanna-be)
programmer: Hang out at newsgroups, websites, and m-lists (and physical
meetings if possible) where others of like inclinations are. Get a good
idea for a real project that has salable potential. Start coding
yourself if need be. But put together a specefication masterplan to attract
others. Then get ready to blow all us buyers away; its happened before!

So my answer is not 42 - it is more along the line of how many nanobots
can dance on the head of a 25-micron lead-out pin.

Big ideas start as small hows. The hows come from the whats. And the big 
vison is a product of both.

What is it one wants to do?
How does he do it?
What is the vision?


Therefore; What is your what?

Hello greenboy, Troy and anyone else who's still there

It seems to me that the next stage here should be to draw up some
specs for a music composition program to replace B&P and to work in
future Amigas with PPC processors and (probably) PCI slots.

At the very least we could prepare a doc saying what we want in an
ideal program. Not only what is missing from B&P, MusicX etc but also
what is missing from CubaseVST.

Think hard about the best interface.

Then we can think about what language it should be coded in (this may
depend on what is being done about slim binaries or some other system
to make software that works on either 68K or PPC).

Then if it looks as though it is worth doing, a couple of clever
persons may like to do some coding. The main motivation ought to be to
produce the music program that you want - profits from the Amiga
market are not to be relied on.

What is wrong with B&P?
1. Doesn't work properly on graphics cards
2. Bad at handling samples (new software can handle 24-bit samples)
3. Needs support for continuously varying pitch - some kind of pitch
bend editor (see Bob Moog's MIDI Theremins)
4. The multimedia features are weak

What's good?
1. The liked list structure relates well both to the Amiga OS and to
the flow-like process of recording, editing and playing music and
sound effects
2. The plug-in tools and accessories facility - it would save a lot
of coding if a new program was compatible with existing B&P tools
3. Generally good interface

I would like to see a program which had very strong support of time
code and links to animations. Perhaps a window on screen for
displaying an animation when a music track for it was being worked on.
The NLE video edit programs basically only edit samples, not MIDI.

I doubt if I can help with coding, but I would gladly help with design
of Icons, interface graphics etc. for a good project.

What about the existing programs such as Camouflage?

There ought to be a world-beating Amiga music program. 

Eh?

Hi Don,

>What is wrong with B&P?
>1. Doesn't work properly on graphics cards

A note on this.....You can load B&P on an 8 bit screen limited to 8
colors. I am running it on an1600x1200 screen with Studio16 and
MovieShop.

The kludge is that B&P has to be launched from a hi-res native mode. I
don't know how or why it works. I only know it works, it's stable, and
once you do it you don't have to do it again until the computer is reset.

I've tried using the loadresource command to pre-load the
BlueRibbon.library but that doesn't work. So what I did was wiite a very
small (and clumsy I suspect) Arexx script that opens Studio16 on a hi-res
screen (it loads faster than B&P and seems to access the file B&P needs),
immediatly closes it, then opens B&P on an 8 bit screen.

It's a kludge, it works for me, and I've got my huge B&P and Studio16
working environment. The WBstarter command comes with ToolManager and 
loads the tooltypes of the icon.

Have fun.

I'm there, sign me up and just send me a free PPC card :)
This is why I dove into learning C in the first place.  From where I
stand
as a programmer now, It seems an un-doable task for me. But I'm not gonna
give up. Thanks to some of you in this list and 4 different books on C, I
now
have some of the hardest concepts under my belt. (structures, typedefs,
pointers,
funtions) Now I have to make C and the Ami OS a second langauge.
Unbeleivably
I have recieved 2 contacts this week asking if I would be interested in
joining a
couple of software developers just because of my ML / Basic backgounrd
and I
know what C looks like. One big problem is they are MS developers. My
answer
was "bite me", in a nicer way of course. I code Ami only, or I code
nothing.

>At the very least we could prepare a doc saying what we want in an

I'll start it this evening.

>Not only what is missing from B&P, MusicX also what's missing from
CubaseVST.

They are both missing B&P :)

>Think hard about the best interface.

I have a unique interface in mind already. Mial me if you want to
talk about some possiblities.

>to make software that works on either 68K or PPC).

If it is done in clean C, won't it compile properly for PPC?

Beggers can't be chosers when you looking for all the help you 
can get. If your a handy graphics artist, you'll have plenty to do
in an interface I have in mind.

>What about the existing programs such as Camouflage?

I talked to those guys a couple of times before. Nice group,
but they tell me they have a contract with the originator of the
software and it's basiclly proprietary software they are keeping
to themselfs, at least for now. The story could have changed
since the last time I talked to them though. Unfortunatlly I doubt
you'll find other coders as into this as I am. They all have their
own projects they want to do and are probablly not interested
as much In a music program. But If that program could
double as an Mpeg/Video/MOD/Sample player among other things,
then it could find a market and a wider interest among developers.

There are remarkable programs on the Mac, and ONE on the PC that is well
worth studying. Cakewalk Pro Audio 6 (soon to be 7) is very solid, been
around since pre-Windozzze. Unlike Cubase or Logic, it has a controlled-
ascent learning-curve. A well designed program on a great OS like Amiga's
should be a no-brainer to operate straight out of the box for the basics,
and should be easy to add on to one's capabilities.

Cakewalk is also a good model because it believes in supporting standards.
If you want to use it in conjunction with automated digital mixers, Roland
VS-series NLEs, ADATs or Tascam DA-series, it has the goods. As well as
supporting standard PC digital audio cards, it supports some specific
features.

CW supports realtime effects, again as a standard, so modules are freely
available. Actually they look like they are on fire in all the good ways!
Cakewalk can convert single-instrument digital audio tracks quickly into
midi tracks with high accuracy. It can make tempo maps or groove templates
from digital audio. It can automatically chop up a long DA track into
shorter segments without all the silence (great for dialog placement!).
The 7 upgrade promises better independence for looping midi and DA tracks.

Godlike! And the price is half that of serious Macware.

Good articles in Byte magazine lately about how lame C and C++ really are.
The author advocates using Java and other high-level platform independent
(well it was when Sun introduced it, before Microsloth subverted it!)
languages for use on power machines, because of portability, ease of
modification, and fast development cycle. But in a music program, where
timing is paramount, I think this approach may not be the way.

Incidentally, Cakewalk has a macro language that allows one to design
tools like B&P, or automate tasks. CAL is approachable by non-coders,
and existing scripts easily enough tweaked that a huge amount of stuff
is available.

Anyone who is interested in DA and sequencing, with decent scoring, web-
specific features, and multimedia on the side should study this jewel.
Major pros use it to score weekly hour-longs, which goes a long way
in impressing me, because a program has to be quick and easy to do this
well.

>There ought to be a world-beating Amiga music program.

... Again. There ought to be a world-beating Amiga music program again.

Beggers can't be chosers when you looking for all the help you 
can get. If your a handy graphics artist, you'll have plenty to do
in an interface I have in mind.

I'd be willing to do some beta testing, and possibly some interface design.... And I mean serious beta testing... not just an excuse to get free software. I too am 100% Amiga, and am trying to bring my C/C++ skill levels up to speed. I refuse to do any coding for anything but AmigaOS. Microsloth doesn't need anymore help anyway... they already have to many cooks, and the broth is beyond being spoiled!

B&P ToolTypes and mode promotion allow B&P to run on a card in a primitive
kludgey fashion. But like many programs of its time the developers didn't
take the time to use systemwide support that had become available: ie,
the screenmode requester. A modern music prog should be able to run 16,
even 24-bits deep on a properly equipped system, and actually make good
use of the additional color that is available.

Font sensitivity with good font-smoothing is also necessary to support
different screen resolutions effectively. I am hoping we will get modern
PS/True-type support in the Amiga OS.

Yes, you may be right... although I haven't had a chance to test my editor updating very extensively, although on the surface, it appears to be working properly.

Hello to all involved with this thread (and everyone else also!)


>>>What is wrong with B&P?
>>>1. Doesn't work properly on graphics cards

Could someone please explain the dificulties they are having with
this? What exactly doesn't work? Screen display, timing, anything?
I use B&P on a Spectrum/CyberGraphix3/16color/800X600 screen and the
only thing I've noticed is some menu display problems. I only use
B&P sparingly (I use Studio16 extensively!) and have used them, with
success, together on the B&P screen. More specific info would be very
helpful in avoiding a potential problem that I haven't encountered yet.

Thanks much!

Resources on the web for the Amiga that really need to be exploited to the
fullest include the Team AMIGA website (http://www.wans.net/~gpeake/) and
m-list, all the programmer newsgroups, ICOA and other developer/publisher
based organizations that can be tracked from the Amiga Web Directory.
It probably wouldn't hurt to check out the B&P m-list as well.

And perhaps the site with the greatest potential for newer non-established
entrepreneurs who want to assemble ideas and people - No AMIGA To Waste:
(http://thunderstorms.org/NATW/). An incredible idea for a site that I
encourage all to check out and participate in!

To really build a program that musicians will buy, like, and excel with
I think it important to study the tools that are foremost in the
occupation. Electronic Musician has a great archive of back-articles and
reviews tied to a search engine. Here I can read an article on how five
leading pros from different specialties use Cakewalk, FI. 
http://www.e-musician.com/Excite/AT-Article_Archivesquery.html gets it.
Many of the publishers like dissidents (hi Jim!), Cakewalk, Opcode, 
Mark Of The Unicorn have great sites including good screenshots.

[HEY DON? Don Cox. You still have that detailed email I sent you
concerning interface and music prog design, a month or three ago? Could
you post it back up?]

No doubt they are writing utilities we already have fifty of, or clones
of gameclones that are based on games that resemble ... you guessed it -
other games. But to start a program that takes true stones, it might take
a real visionary, and someone who can pitch it.

MODS! The scourge of serious Amiga musicians. Even serious game
design is getting away from a mod or sample-playback approach. This is
why MicroStealth bought BlueRibbon: to develop intelligent, creative,
interactive approaches to score games and multimedia.

Mods are tired not wired; there are already a kazillion modbuilders and
players out there, and when I think of all the wasted programming talent
out there THAT could have been applied to real music programs, why my
blood pressure rises and I am forced to SHRED on my guitar with the amp
turned to 12!!!!! (I don't like mods.)

Come on guys, turn up the heat, shed some light!

Brian spoke and whirled like a Dervish divine:

> Just ran it. Works great and not only that, B&P makes my coffee now
too!
> Wow what a coder!

Is the coffee good?  I'm not a coffee drinker so I didn't confirm the
quality of that part of the script!   :)


I think the script still does more than it has to do, but I don't have
an
AD516 in my machine to test it out right now.

Of course, I think ModePro was handling it fine anyway... but then I
can't be sure of that either right now.  I think it depends on what
screen resolution you are using it with for B&P.

I've got B&P set up as 1280x1024 via ModePro with DOUBLEWIDTH and
DOUBLEHEIGHT set.  This is with the Cybervision64, so nothing is virtual
at all.

I'm too busy figuring out all this new video and printing technology...
get back to audio later in life... :)

Perhaps it's my system. It makes me wonder now that I find someone else
using a Spectrum graphics card. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But I
find that an 8 color screen works better for me than 16 so that's how I
run it. Studio16 only uses 8 colors anyway right?

If you are not experiencing any problems with it now, then I doubt that
you will in the future . . . . . .  :)

Mods suck, I agree. And I'm not apologizing, but most Amigans couldn't
afford to buy a decent sound card that costed as much as some computers.
So we end up with a lot of creative folks who do the best with what they
have. I wish mods would die also. It would spur people to find a better
solution. . . . .  (hot enough?).    

(we're still suffering Mehdi's hardware restrictions)

P.S. Please try to put the arrows in the *center*
                                             of the target on my back. ..

Thanks for the reassurance :)

However, I'm still curious as to what the "non-working" symptoms are.
Do buttons not respond, tools not function, windows not open, menus
come up blank, display not scroll, midi not function properly, etc.?

I have not had a project that required extensive B&P usage since I got
my Spectrum. (However I did score a 90 minute and 20 minute film with
B&P on my A500 a few years back. I had to buy an accellerator for the A500
to keep timing up to snuff.) I would really like to explore any problems
that others are having so they don't sneak up and bite me in the middle
of a project where I'll be relying on B&P.

Thanks!

If the program comes up, it works. That's it. It's a screen promotion
problem it doesn't affect the gadgets, menus, requestors or anything else.
B&P runs on Amiga native screens no problem so you can always go back to
that if you absolutely have to in order to finish a project.

My best guess is that if you are not having a problem with it now, you
won't in the future . . . . . . that's all I can say.

How is B&P and Studio16 doing on a Cv3D or the earlier graphics board
from phase-5 (i forgot it's name at the moment).

Which screens can be used ???????

We have enough colors in B&P i think,i do not need more colors i mean.
I make music with b&P, not drawings.

But run B&P in other screen modes is a must, maybe someone knows how it
can be done ????,  modepro util for B&P maybe.
PS/True-type support ????, Nyaaaaaa, try other fonts it's not a must.

A Midi/Music program must do it's job well, and thats Midi and Music, maybe
some Audio.
It all come together with a great functionallity and a fine layout.
I liked Music-X very much because it worked nice and feels nice.
I like protools in the same way and Studio16.

All the mentioned Amiga programmes have little support.
We can have new great programs by buying Camouflage, Prostation, MSE etc. etc.
Support the programmers of Amiga Midi and Audio software by buying their
software.
Take a look at my side for the 303 tracker software with harware add on.


So use your old programmes and look at the new supported ones, they are our
Amiga Future i think.


SeeYaa,

Aha! A simple symptom. It starts or it doesn't start. Just so you know,
I'm using CyberGraphix v3 (though v2 also seemed to work) and NewMode
from Aminet to promote the screen. I also use a Tool Manager "dock"
button to start the program. I hope you get this worked out.

Thanks for the info!

Perhaps it's my system. It makes me wonder now that I find someone else
using a Spectrum graphics card.

ADDENDUM:

perhaps you would be kind enough to show us your CyberGraphX env: settings
so I and others can see what works.

here's mine, let's compare. Maybe you can fix the problem for all of us;

If you look at the icon information for Studio 3.01 there is a PICKMODE
option.  If you enable that in the icon, every time you start Studio you can
tell it what screen mode to use.  I am running it on a Cybergraphics v2 CV64
(the original) 1024 x 750 screen with no problems.

Excuse my last answer, you were talking about B&P not Studio :(

There is an option in B&P under preferences to run the program in Workbench
screen mode.  On my machine this just creates another public screen using
whatever screen mode that workbench uses.  I have a 1024 x 750 16bit workbench
and B&P will open on that same type of screen.  

This is with Cybergraphics V2 on a Cybervision64 board.

No problems here.

I seems there is still confusion about B&P on graphics cards. I'll say it
another way:
	1) It works, if it works on your card.
	2) It works because of mode-promotion, not because they added
	   proper support.
	3) See any program that uses the screenmode requester properly
           (PageStream, DOpus, etc). A world of difference. More choices,
	   more abilites, less overhead.
	4) But it works. Don't get more confused.

Thats great, Brian. Now we know what SIZE your envars are, and that you have
them in the correct place. ;)))    Too bad we don't know what the values
are.

I said *modern* programs, not B&P, which I loved. We are discussing the
design of new world-class programs.

Running in hi- or true-color allows one to deal with scoring for film,
video, or anim (running Quicktime or MPEG window on same screen, anyone?).
It allows one to have more colors to define different windows, parameters,
modes, and states - so if you are running a complex environment on a
1280x1024 or 1600x1200 screen you can easily differentiate the mass data
you are confronting yourself with.

If good graphic principles are employed at the time of program design, eye
fatigue can be lessened, data recognition is enhanced, and it looks cool.

>>Font sensitivity with good font-smoothing is also necessary to support

> PS/True-type support ????, Nyaaaaaa, try other fonts it's not a must.

If you want a program that allows multiple resolution screen use (from
640x480 to 1600x1200) it is much easier to have fonts that are easily sized
and antialiased than it is to have many bitmaps of many sizes. Unsmoothed
screen fonts do not look as good, cause eye fatigue, and will not represent
at small sizes.

Being able to swap the entire family of fonts just by selecting small, med,
large, etc is standard on other platforms for screen resizing applications.
And we need it on the Amiga. For modern programs. 

> All the mentioned Amiga programmes have little support.

Most serious musicians went to other platforms at least partially because
Amiga midi programs are not progressive. MusicX was way cool in its time as
was B&P. But MusicX never got more than 16 midi-channels in a time when
multitimbral modules demanded interfaces like TriplePlay+ or bigger.
Microstealth stole our flagship, B&P to gain a leading programmer or two
and the associated intellectual property.

I agree we need to support Amiga programs, but we need to demand competitive
Amiga programs in order for it to be worth anyone's while. Take care Rene'.

Yeah Rich . . . . . .

I hope you get your problem that you don't have yet and will only use once
in a while solved too. . . . . .

Thanks for your input. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

That brings to mind the tornado that we just had here in Georgia that
missed our neighborhood by a mere 6 miles. We didn't have one here but I
am worried that someday one may hit here. Does anyone else out there know
how to prevent this when it happens? (not that it ever will of course)

I've heard incredible mods. There is some great skill in surpassing the
seeming limitations that are imposed. But mods (on the Amiga) have
sidetracked programmers, made the hobbyist and game sector stronger while
very little energy has gone into making the kind of toys I can sink MY
teeth into. Selfish enough for ya?

Actually, I was refering to the main topic; of modern DA/sequencer design
when I exhorted the list to turn up the heat, shed some light.

>P.S. Please try to put the arrows in the *center* of the target on my back.

Nah, need a worthy adversary at a later date. Take Care, Brian (as in,
watch your scarred and punctured back).

I agree %100 greenboy. It has to do with the vision thing we keep bringing
up here. But that's why I say they suck. They literally suck energy away
from better vehicles. I will never deny the creativity involved in
putting together some great compositions. (biff!..boff!..baff!..kazowie!)

It's all Don's fault. He started it.  :)   (pluck-pluck)

But to the subject; I don't much care about jazzy eye-candy GUI's as long
as they are fairly configurable. Studio16 isn't overly jazzed but it's
great for what it does. The cuelist editor was only an infant when Sunrize
fell it seems. The reason I paid full retail for B&P was because of the
baloney they spouted about a competent notation printer. What a joke . . I
can do it better and easier in DPaint. But the SMPTE timing, and a number
of other accessories were ahead of their time (albeit a short time)for the 
money The tool concept was a good one, it's just that they relied upon it 
too heavily. 
As the power of the ordinary user has increased, and as the Amiga
will be going the way of parallel PPC processing, I think it would be a
good idea to build the next premier music program as blocks that can be
integrated into a "core" sequencer so as to be functional or not. It seems
that it would also be easier to get public input for add ons. We see it in
B&P as the tools offered by many helpful folks who contributed them.
The core should have the capability to do the serial functions as well as
the driver functions for AHI and all the possible sample formats.

There's more. I'll be back later. . . . .

I haven't used Studio in a while but noticed today that the Play1 both mixer
and meter are showing red when I start Studio.  It appears that something is
playing over Play1 but this is prior to me loading a sample or playing
anything.  The meter and mixer are both reading in the red on that channel.  I
don't know if messing with preferences and the SMPTE settings could have
caused this??

Any ideas??

Thanks,

Norm

Hi folks,

reading all this stuff about an imaginary wonder music program for the
Amiga and the constant references to Bars&Pipes I couldn't help not
making the point that I personally HATE B&P. Back in the early ages
I started using KCS from the late Dr T.'s, and while it never proved
so 'clumsily handy' as an old C-Lab midi program for the C64 whose name
I don't recall any longer, I just managed to get on fine with it.
I made music for countless TV commercials and the soundtrack for a few
longer TV programs by KCS and we got on very well together. When a friend
of mine borrowed me his B&P, I spent hard hours trying to get accustomed
to a screen that looks like the kids' playground in the kindergarten with
all the stupid little icons and everything but in the end I failed. Okay,
I heard from many people that it's versatile and everything, but even in
extreme conditions there was nothing I couldn't do with the KCS I needed
to do. The point I'd like to make is, power behind simplicity is the
key phrase to all successful software. That's why MicroSloth sucks (or
rather, makes a lot of money by providing you with software for the
Ferrari engined tricycle called a PC that people need to attend courses
to learn using: the biggest hoax of the 20th century). Yes, I can hear
Greenboy saying that I'm an anti-technical minded jerk or something, but
still, there's a fine line between being in control of a program and
accomplishing everything with a few clicks of the mouse and being
overwhelmed by the array of so-called 'functions' that you use once in
a year after consulting the manual. 'Convert single-instrument DA tracks
into midi tracks with high accuracy'. Wonderful. I've been working in the
pro audio-for-video field for more than ten years now, but there wasn't
a single occasion when I needed to do that. In case I should do that, I
listen to the track and then play it on my midi keyboard right away because
that's what I've been trained to do in the Music College and that's what
my ears and hands are for if I consider myself a musician. Looks like the
role of many computer programs is to hide our lack of talent and education.
I know people who are boasting of their newest DTP programs, but never in
their entire life would they ever publish a single page of newspaper or
leaflet or anything that has printed letters on it (they would have a hard
time getting the spelling right, anyway... oops, the spelling checker will
do that for them.) The new chick is to have soundcards with 24 bit
processing. Fabulous. The problem is, 98% of people can not hear any
difference between a 32 kHz and a 48 kHz sample of any piece of audio.
(We've made experiments on that!!!) The problem is, most people don't even
bother to buy a Hi-Fi VHS to view any program with stereo sound. After
seeing your first few films in Dolby Stereo or DTS or THX or anything, and
enjoying the cascade of sounds from different directions, you won't have
any special experience. The first time I saw 'TITANIC' in the sleaziest and
smallest confinement of space one may beneficially call a cinema somewhere
in the smallest village of the country with mono sound, I was thrilled and
for months it was on my mind. The second time I went to see it with DTS
sound and all in one of the most elegant cinemas of the capital, it didn't
give any more than what I remembered and I felt bored. 24 bits, oh, yeah.
I'm afraid Batman 26 is even more annoying in Dolby Surround than through
your pocket radio.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not against technology, on the contrary. I'm against
the senseless inflation of technology, when the Ferrari engine becomes a
space shuttle jet thruster on your tricycle, but instead of going to the
moon (which you obviously couldn't do in the lack of an airtight suit) you
use it for travelling London-Paris in 0.37 seconds instead of 0.38, for
ten times the price.

Greetings Zsolt Kovacs ;

Which proves the point that knowing one program well is better many times
than knowing a little about a lot of programs. I know others who prefer
KCS and I agree with the simplicity theory you are talking about.

>to a screen that looks like the kids' playground in the kindergarten with
>all the stupid little icons and everything

Well said. And I am a B&P user. Although I prefer B&P, I think it could
have been a bit less on GUI and a little more tuned to the needs of making
music. I had a conversation with the SoundLab people when they were
premiering one of the new MIDI foot controllers for Boogie (1988) when I
was in music school. The stupid thing read out in hex and they wanted
$1500 for it. I had recently designed a similar foot controlled
program/MIDI sender and asked them how they could justify selling a box
that could be built for $25 worth of parts for that price and they looked
at me like I was crazy. I asked them why anyone would want to learn hex
just to know their location? Especially when it was so easy to understand
8 banks of 8 patches, or 16 of 8 etc.

To make a long story short engineers for the most part aren't full time
musicians. We are only in the last few years getting to the point in
technology where power and simplicity can be more easily married and
where forums like this exist in which ideas can merge.

>The point I'd like to make is, power behind simplicity is the

Hear hear.

>that's what I've been trained to do in the Music College and that's what
>my ears and hands are for if I consider myself a musician. Looks like the

At a certain point I had to decide whether I was a technician/engineer or a
musician. I chose the latter. This is why I was so frustrated in terms of
not being able to edit in realistic notation (but I do like the hybrid
staff in B&P and I'd like it better if it worked well %100 of the time). 
IMHO It seems that most music programs are made for folks who aren't 
musicians. And it seems that that is where the program should start. Of 
course it's all about time and MIDI and SMPTE and multi-media and all the 
different formats of 8/16/24 bit sound. That's why the timeline is the 
centerpiece of music software.


Thanks Zsolt.

That is what I USED to say. But when its not just for the sake of being
rococo or flash, color can serve as a way of differentiating what is
going on, where one is, what is activated, etc.

Normally I go for minimalist: my browsers, I run with the keyboard, none of
those anims and flashy buttons for me. But then; there aren't that many
commands to know in a browser. In a program that can open 30 or 40
different modules/windows/views it is nice to have quick recognition of
all controls, when sqwushing an incredible amount of data onto a 1280x1024.

That is the other reason I don't like to have anything but the url window
in a browser. It makes more room for the data I have come to browse. Big
pics, major text - less scrolling. Multiple windows at several sites make
for easier cut-n-paste, corroboration, whatever.

That was a great thing about B&P too. For its time it used color to identify
things (well you sure couldn't actually see what some of those little icons
were, on a .40 dot-pitch screen with Enterprise'66 transporter-beam
flicker!). And you could open or close as many windows as you wanted, at the
size you needed, and save that configuration.

>The reason I paid full retail for B&P was because of the baloney they

It was either that, DMCS (a consumer entertainment program that didn't do
half bad), or Dr T's The Copyist which was like arm-wrestling a tiger
while he was under the impression that the agenda was chomp-n-chew.
Finale on the Mac was rough too, and cost $999 at the time.

>I think it would be a good idea to build the next premier music program as

What was Todor Fay's first program, before B&P? Soundscape? It was totally
modular, to the point of having to do things like start modules separately,
use a patch bay to connect them, etc. Later he somewhat streamlined it into
the pipeline concept, which gave some advantages for "tool" design.

>It seems that it would also be easier to get public input for add ons. We

Yes. I designed a few macrotools that I really used. There was that level
of modularity. Then there was the Rules For Tools level, that actually
involved writing code. This was another thing I found attractive about
the wonderful Cakewalk. Its CAL (Cakewalk App Language) is much like having
ARexx commands to operate the interface, do operands and data manipulation,
etc. The more that you can make, the less you have to depend on them for.

Which brings us around to the high-powered and lucrative marketplace of
plug-ins for digital audio: real-time and computationally latent. Next
installment?

Thank you so much for validating the point of my post on a simpler
interface for normal musicain that just need powerfull basics.
(check my message on "Musician resources NOT cakewalk")
Personally I hated KCS :) BUT what you say about the need for
an interface that can get the job done without software training courses
is right on with me. I do agree that KCS had a much more basic, usable,
but some what powerfull interface, but at the same time I still spent too
much time trying to figure it out to make me happy. Nothing ruins a
musical inspiration and sends you from mellow to pissed faster
that screwing around with a program to the point you have lost the mood
that was creating the music.( 95 hanging my sequences and making me
reboot
was enough to shoot kittens over) B&P requires manual too, but I went
with it for the CD sample recording and spent the time to learn it.
KCS never made it to this kind of features. Ever use Tiger Cub? It was
an interesting sequencer, but lacked much. Also done by Dr.T.

I keep seeing cakewalk come up in some of these examples.
I normally don't say any thing If I have nothing nice to say,
but I'll have to make a small exception this once. :)
This is a little long and if nothing else please read the last part.
Though I'm not a major pro musician, I do have many years
at playing, writting and recording and I have worked with other
musicians that are considered pro, though not they are not famous.
I understand some of you may have feelings for cakewalk and I don't
mean to pick on your preferences. But here's some of my insite.
I have used sequencers of about every kind C64/128, Mac, PC, Atari, Ami
of course, and serveral standalone sequencer boxes like teac, alesis
roland
and even one that was built into a pro keyboard. First on the list,
the stand alones suck as a user interface. Little LCD panels with lots
of hyroglyphics to spend days reading about. Some are better than
others, but over all I hate them. Next is the Mac... Master Tracks
and....
damn, can't remember the other 2 sequncers. All were ok but lacked
horribly the kinds of features of B&P. I have not used the Mac version
of cake walk though. On to the PC..... This is why you see me in these
groups now. The C64 and Atari just lack any real power any more. I once
tried
to abandon Ami for the PC to continue my work.
Cakewalk has some nice features that B&P would like to have, but other
than that, it was a uninspiring,"hard to edit you work", utility. I did
find one
ray of hope on the PC side that none has mentioned. Digital Orchastra
by Voyetra/Turtle Beach. www.voyetra.com they have been around since
sequencers looked and worked like sonus64 and dos based voyetra.
If you want to see what I think is the best the PC has on sequencers,
check out that site. To move to voyetra at that time, I would have had to
spend
serveral hundred to upgrade my PC and buy their software. And still I
would be
missing some of the basic things I liked B&P for. After 4 months of
serious
effort, I tuned off the quirky, one active window at a time PC
sequencers,
turned back on B&P, got pissed, wrote MS tdo get B&P back, and here I am
today.

Summary........
None of the other sequencers have any thing more on B&P except for
the updates it could have recieved if not for it's destruction in '93.
You must relize there is a huge musicain market out there going
ignored. I would estimate as much as 80% of the potential sequencer
buyers, are less educated (not dumber, just lest formal education)
have little or zero computer/software knowledge, are intemidated
and reject a computer as a member of their band. Now which machine
does this sound like a job for bridging this gap? More exspensive Mac?
Bloated 95 interface with endless manual reading and software/hardware
tweeking? Our Ami of couse. 2 professionals I worked wtih were ready to
drop there respective Mac and PC to use B&P when I showed them what
It could do. Ami's bankruptcy and near death convinced them not to.
Even B&P's interface can be intimidating, but time and time again when
other musicians saw how it worked, they wanted to now how they could
get a set up with their own Ami. A couple did go Ami, others were turned
off by Ami's market trouble. My Idea of an interface is one that any
musician
who has ever pressed record/play on a tape recorder could start using
in 10 minutes with out a manual. Difficult you say? Was it hard the first
time you pressed record/rewind/play? Other exspaned features could be
installed as add-on's or updates, but one simple but powerfull interface
at a small price with an affordable (and very portable for gigs) A1200
could potentially sell 10's of thousands in the US alone. I spent $500
on my first basic 4 track recorder 9 years ago. And I was doing
cartwheels
to have it. Imagine what can be offered to young bands and musicians at
the
same price with an interface as easy to use as their track recorders,
with mega more features and power in an A1200 (or next gen ami) +
software+sound card and with out prior knowlege of a PC. It can be done,
No current platform can offer this to a PC illiterate musican. It would
be
a major victory for ami, as video toaster was to the video market.
Well thanks for making it through all of this, now back to my programming
books. I have a long way to go to get there. BTW, I was going to finish
my own
demo at the request of a small record lable, but put it off to work on
Ami and
programming this. It means that much to me.

troy

Same here, before it got ported to the Amiga. I got good and fast with it.
It also had incredible compositional prowess for more experimental
approaches to music. I always waited for it on the Amiga, as Soundscape
was less musician-oriented, and more for multimedia (the word hadn't even
been invented yet!).

But I also bought bug-ridden yet simply standard Passport MasterTracksPro,
because of promised 32 midi-channel support. And I bought MusicX, which I
got some good mileage out of, especially exploring graphic continous-
controller editing. MasterTracks just sat in the box as MusicX had somewhat
the same model, but didn't crash, and had some new twists.

>When a friend of mine borrowed me his B&P, I spent hard hours trying to

It was a WAY tough transition. Almost diametrically opposed. I don't
know that I ever got FAST in B&P. But it supported 48 midi-channels.
That covered quite a few multitimbral samplers and synths, and automated
all my signal processor mixing.

But after fighting with the totally non-graphic algorythmic stuff in
KCS Level 2 MPC (all those checkboxes for bias, density!) it was a joy
to design tools that related to musical concepts like triadic or quartal
construction, arpeggiation, things I learned to use as a theory/compos-
ition major. I got results for that type of thing MUCH quicker in B&P,
and without the dictionary of rocket science Dr T wanted me to swallow.

>Yes, I can hear Greenboy saying that I'm an anti-technical minded jerk

How do you figure? We've never talked that I recall. And I believe in
choices; to each his own, etc. Don't jump to conclusions. Ironic: Most
people used to think I was a techie because I preferred KCS to their
programs. And now there is something wrong with me because YOU like it.

A well-designed program should give that control readily, and have a
smooth learning-curve because newer features are added in an intuitive
fashion, perhaps using models we are already comfortable with as musicians
or computer operators. And quick is good. But - I'll qualify this - if a
toolset is deep and multirelational, it takes discipline to get with it.
You didn't have ALL of Dr T's mastered overnight, did you?

So. No sense in allowing others some of the features they might use?

That's good. I might use my vintage octapad, sax with pitch-to-midi
convertor or Yamaha WX11 to enter data. It still comes down to data. If
the new tool is available I might use it. Or I might set up 3 mics in a
tunnel and play it with a bass clarinet (I have almost all the woodwind
family) to tape.

>Looks like the role of many computer programs is to hide our lack of

This argument comes from Day One of the midi era. Examine history. There
have always been poseurs and powers, since music became an "entertainment"
as well as a spiritual power. There were people whining about putting keys
on flutes. Still are a few. But it is really about everybody finding what
they are looking for, what they resonate to.
 
>Don't get me wrong. I'm not against technology, on the contrary.
>I'm against the senseless inflation of technology

It is ALL technology! A shaman drum or a modeled instrument from a DSP.
There is plenty to explore in music from any viewpoint, and some people
would have stuck with the Amiga if their needs for the right artistic
tools were met.

We have the opportunity to address this, we who care about the Amiga.

Or lots of hotkeys that maximize/minimize a certain window setting. So one
can do more stuff with less screen. It's pretty daunting running B&P,
Studio16 *and* MovieShop on one 1600x1300 screen. If you separate it in
four corners or work areas you still can't necessarily get the two or
three windows that you use at a time in one area. (not that I'm
complaining I'm just speaking of being more efficient). Configurable
hotkeys make this a bit faster and easier.

Yup. It's all about configuration. That's a big reason why we love our
Amiga's.

But the MIDI I/O was sub par in terms of recording MIDI and composing 
MIDI. Yes the notation looked OK but DMCS was . . .I guess I have to say
it....a bit of a toy. Like SoundScape. Again 8 bit oriented.

Uh. Cakewalk is come long way since old day, ke-mo-sabee. Things change.

Actually Digital Orchestrator Plus is the other sequencer on the PC I was
looking at. It too has had many recent improvements that add to its speed
and ease of use. But Voyetra (they built a killer rack synth way back when)
is aiming at the middle-market with this package, and it is missing just a
few things I want.

Sion Software (http://www.infoserve.net/quickscore/) also has taken what
used to be marketed as Tiger and Quickscore by Dr T and improved it, if
someone is looking for midlevel sequencing with a bigger emphasis on
scoring. They also have improved The Copyist, but I would still have
SOME fear in my heart. (I used all the primitive knuckle-dragging
ancestors of these).

I like sequencers more for their compositional and recording use, than I
care about toting 'em to gigs. But any sequencer that can trigger
sequences/songs/smidgeons from a ascii or ivory has my vote. (Cakewalk
does this BTW. So do a few "classic" sequencers: Dr T really had this
stuff in spades.) Only now you can cheat even more and use digital audio
in the same fashion.

$159 list. Easy to use considering it has midlevel DA support, decent
scoring (that would be KILLER scoring as compared to B&P's).

Mine too. When is someone gonna write it? And does that include bass

Do you somehow have the output and the input looped together?  This could
(will?) cause feedback which would make your meters peg.

The original B&P sucked. However B&P _Pro_ grew into a very
nice composition environment. There's a lot a like about it.
The basic metaphor of a pipeline is great. The modularity of
the tools, the non-destructive nature of placing tools in the
end of the pipeline, the handy visualization of the general shape 
of phrases in the track window, and the fairly well implemented
list and graphic editing are all things I like.

The notation was never much to write home about and the
multimedia stuff seems like fluff to me. The icons are squished
at the resolution I use, which looks a bit silly. 

The integration with Studio 16 finally (after many headaches)
turned into a workable arrangement and has been very useful.

I tried the Dr. T's stuff, but it lacked flexibility due to its
interface. It could do some neat stuff, like triggering individual
sequences from the computer keyboard, but I never needed 
to do that. Other stuff I needed to do it could not do easily, or
sometimes at all. Dr. T's stuff got better, but was always just 
short of elegant to my brain's way of thinking.

I probably still have a bunch of Dr. T's software around
here somewhere, if anyone wants to buy it cheap. :^)

I've been involved in several MIDI sequencer projects 
(testing Music X, testing B&P Pro with Studio 16, writing 
the manual for Harmony). It's not an easy kind of program
to whip out. Today, there are more object oriented ways
of designing software that would make code reusable
and easier to extend. Any new project ought to go that
route.

Some of those earlier programs likely got so complex 
they were probably too difficult and time consuming to 
take to the next level. I saw initial screen mockups for an 
updated MusicX that never happened, but it looked 
beautiful!

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

That's also how I do it on a Spectrum card running CyberGraphX, and
I run at 1120 x 832 or some such. As I've posted previously, I can run
B&P, Studio 16 inside B&P, and Producer (Broadcaster) simultaneously,
all at that screen size. Studio 16 will sync via external SMPTE cable to
the Broadcaster and B&P syncs internally to Studio 16. That's for
music scoring projects. For video editing I can run the old Studio 16
libraries to control the AD516 card from within Producer (although
I mostly use that system for scoring now, and edit video on a different 
system).

It's more than looks. If you have a speedy PC get the demo and give it a
try
OK we can include cake walk. All these apps have some good features.
I just don't want a cake-clone for ami. Some of it's good points can be
included of course.

I love to play bass! And it's those type of musicians that would benifit
from the type of interface I have in mind. How many musicains I can list
that have no interest in editing midi tracks or samples. Those features
will be there for the ones who need it,  but many full time
musicianssimply
rewind and re-record the botched track. Forget event editing. There is 
a whole world of guys out there that are tired for taking their DAT
recorders
in for regular maintenance. For the same kind of price they can go
digital
with a good sequencer/sampler. And if the gods continue to smile on me
I hope to have a least a non-working example of the interface I can show.
It will show the lay out and buttons so some one can get an Idea what I
mean and maybe draw in some more coders.

I know it has Tonto :) I used 5.0 for about 4 months. And it does have
some nice
utilities, but I still think better things are possible than it's 95
interface.
And I even put in my first message that I wasn't slamming anyones prefs.
So if anyone IS pissing, they just need to calm down and have a nice
chat..

Agreed. I came about as close to buying that one as you can with out
actually passing the $$$. I ran the demo for about a month. I think when 
I was looking at it, it was about $239 or so. For more like $100-120 I
would
have been using it and maybe dropped B&P. (perish the thought)

The whole purpose of listing urls, mailing lists, features of other
programs, is not to play the same ranting and ranking games you can see on
any "Everthing but Amiga Sucks!" m-list or newsgroup. It is to share
ideas, make them available to others, to bootstrap ourselves out of our
pre-'94 software doldrums.

Appraisal of other software should not be based on knee-jerk platform
association, opinions from versions that haven't been the state of the
particular software for years, or fear/hate of anything that does not
resemble that which we have personally become the most familiar or
comfortable with.

Many of the things I thought I would never care for, I've come to
appreciate the beauty and logic of. That took time and required me to get
past my own habits. The growth was worth it. Now, I value a quick snap
judgement, but I am not tethered to it.

A piece of software that is to have wide approval must either supply so
much power that other alternatives simply do not exist to a majority of
potential users - or - it must be so well-planned and flexible that many
types of users feel that it was designed to meet their particular needs,
style of work, and expertise.

Type One software (power) either tries to improve its interface design as
time goes by, or loses market share to Type Two. Sometimes this is not
possible beyond a certain point, because the design is not modular enough,
is tied to fundemantal shortcomings in the model, or the thinking of its
developer/programmers. Even a from-the-ground-up rewrite is not going to
revitalize it if the writer(s) have blocks and preconceptions.

Type Two software usually has enough power at the start of its cycle to 
survive while features are added or enhanced. Interface designs can also
vary, and a few users simply are not going to grok it, even if it is
simple, because it comes from a mindset that is alien to them. But in
general, it can enjoy a broad spectrum of users, if it keeps up with
market expectations of ease-of-use for the amount of power supplied.

I have seen complaining that makes me wonder why I bothered sharing.
Digging up sources, ideas - why bother when people say, "Come back in
the cave, life is proper here!" Or even worse, "You are no longer
welcome in the cave! You have offended me and my people."

Anyway, I have examined sequencer/sampler/digital audio/computer design
ever since before the dawn of the midi age and find it fascinating. My
love for permutation and evolution of thought and design philosophy forces
me to admire what I see on other platforms, and allows me to go back to all
the sequencers I have known and loved and recognize their genius.

[You should see my "record" collection. Try getting a fix on me, your eyes
go on to the next few titles, and you are sunk. I like ALL those types of
music, though a firm believer in Sturgeon's law "Ninety percent of anything
is crap."]

Its real simple. Amiga needs new software to go forward. If it doesn't
cover enough ground it probably won't satisfy existing users, let alone
attract new ones - goodbye Amiga.

I'm writing this (rambling) because I want to tell someone who will listen, and where I live, everyone is PC or nothing, so this list is the only place for me to turn to.

I've owned an Amiga for 11 years, and this past year has been the most Amiga productive year ever. I have been drawn closer to the Amiga then I ever have before. Maybe it's because of the advent of some good internet software, but what ever it is.... I love it more than ever.

For someone to give up on the Amiga now, after all it's been through, would be silly. How many other computer platforms can survive 3 bankruptcies and still have a following this big... (yes it's small in comparison to MS, but MS never went bankrupt). To me, this can mean only one thing. It's the technology that keeps its head above water. As a technical person, I don't really care if the platform is supported by the masses, as long as it is supported in some small way, even if it's only by the users. If the masses can't see the difference, that's their problem isn't it? I have given up on trying to convince people of Its superiority. They can all flounder in the dark with Win95 for all I care. It's not worth the effort anymore.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but I just had to write this down after reading Greenboys last message.

There are other ways to achieve non-destructive editing, but the pipeline
approach is amazing. Not only does it help one visualize what is going on,
but it allows one to come back to song a year later, without wading through
a bunch of different saved versions, and continue to experiment with the
basic germ. Whereas multiple undos can't go beyond the session, and
multiple version saving can be a headache.

>the multimedia stuff seems like fluff to me.

Me too. But someone has probably used it to great effect somewhere. I think
pro music software today puts its multimedia emphasis on being able to deal
as a game-soundtrack environment. Supplying tools that assist in film
scoring is also important. Though internet music issues are becoming part
of the mix, and presentations have not been forgotten in some quarters.

>The icons are squished at the resolution I use, which looks a bit silly.

Imagery and fonts need to be resizable. It seems that having two nested
images stored for each placement (configured by user radio-button) can
solve this. Fonts are either stored in sets of bitmaps, or can be resized
vector fonts. But Amiga's current vector font choice and engine is not up
to good display, especially at smaller pointsizes. Though I have noticed
a font-smoother on the net lately; for graphics-card users of course.

>The integration with Studio 16 finally (after many headaches) turned into
a workable arrangement and has been very useful.

Another advantage of current gen stuff: the devs have already integrated
the environment. Some titles support industry standard plug-ins, external
hardware control and interfacing, and support for further real-time 
effects via add-on DSP boards - and you get to choose the hardware to
run your digital audio on according to needs and budget.

>Dr. T's stuff got better, but was always just short of elegant to my
>brain's way of thinking.

Dr T's original screens never really changed that much. They just added
a few for the PVG and MCP. Most sequencing studios couldn't believe I
used that butt-ugly 2-bitplane interface by choice. I had three platforms
to choose from, after all! But at the time, Dr T's allowed one to deal
with compositional techniques that were not achievable elsewhere, at
least not without microscopically tweaking in an event list. I was after
multiple simultaneous meters, polyrhythms, non-chained sequencing, etc.

>I probably still have a bunch of Dr. T's software around here somewhere,
>if anyone wants to buy it cheap. :^)

I thought you were going to buy mine! I gues it just stays in the drawer
with the ginsu knife and the one-size-fits-all socket wrench...

>I've been involved in several MIDI sequencer projects (testing Music X,

I betaed for Music-X also, and it became my sequencer of choice for quite
awhile. Many of its abilities, and the model it was built on (colorful
MasterTracksPro basically) are still in wide use elsewhere today. One
thing it never really fulfilled was its support for more than 16 midi-
channels. (Where is David Joiner today?)

I bought two Checkpoint Tech multi-serial cards to use with it for up to
(eventually) 64 channels. But Music-X never really got that happening
satisfactorily. Fortunately, I talked B&P into supporting those cards.
[When I later bought TriplePlay+, Blue Ribbon offered to buy those two
(discontinued) serial cards - for full list! Full value recieved!]

Amen! It also makes it easy to maintain a tradition in the sequencing
world: MidiMangler Home, MidiMangler Studio, and MidiMangler Pro Audio Plus
(with studio furniture included!). They can all be the same thing - with
hooks for the uplevel modules. The software engineer does not need to go
and do mild rewrites to have models for all sizes.

As Amiga users, we might at times take ARexx for granted. But having a macro
language - and a way to communicate with other programs is a treasure. And
it is already built. On other platforms, any power-user program needs to
supply its own language, and one that is not system-wide.

To be able to perform the moves and tasks you want to take place and record
them as an EDITABLE script/macro, like you can in ImageFX or PageStream, is
a fantastic way to have incredible third-party commercial, share- and free-
wares available for MidiMangler. There is a BUZZ a title gets when cool new
freebies and affordable modules are continually available for it. And all
that free advertizing!

And as an aside, I've never seen it done with more apparent simplicity than
in ImageFX! The scripts it generates are so clean and easy to modify. The
included AutoFX utility makes it possible to chain these macros and do
incredible things without ever really getting your hands dirty. And it is
all due to a well-thought out design, where ARexx was in at the foundation.

Java isn't half bad either. (always willing to confuse the issue)

Howdy,

Sorry for the off-topic post, but have been watching a site in Los Angeles
that is a hoot.  A local station has 5 kids stuffed in a '98 VW Beetle, and
the one that lasts the longest wins it.  They've got streaming video/audio,
and it's pretty neat to hear what these kids talk about after 3 or 4 days
in the car.

The site is http://liveinit.earthlink.net

Yes. Should work with SAS c if I understand correctly - I think people
are trying out the new beta now.
But there is a rumor floating around about the possible use of a
system called slim binaries to make code which would work with either
processor, and with Pentium as well. The computer adapts it at load
time. 
The problem is that at
present this idea has only been made to work with the Oberon language.
In fact the only working example is the Mac Oberon compiler.
It involves a special compiler which analyses the code, and a special
loader.

This is a vague rumor which might solidify at WOA. There may be
nothing in it, and anyway a straight 2-version compile must be OK.


Re: Cakewalk
I have also heard lots of good things about Cakewalk, so we should
look at it for ideas. I don't have a PC here, so I can't try it
myself.

I tried it on CGFX3 and found that it didn't draw some details (parts
of the notes in standard notation for instance) and it seemed
unstable. Maybe it is happier under P96. I don't think it can be said
to be 100% retargetable, more like ProPage, almost there.

I only suggested B&P as a starting point because it works well with
S16 and I know it. We need the best ideas from all the programs.

The central problem is how to edit a multi-dimensional structure. In
the time dimension, the tricky bit is handling the constant slight
tempo changes that happen in real music, getting the sequencer to
respect the variations in your timing as you play into it and
recognise where your bar lines (measure lines) come. And adjust it
later.

At right angles to the time there are several dimensions: pitch,
loudness, instrument, effects (echo etc), envelopes of notes, and
maybe others. How to do a clear interface to edit all of these?

I have a sort of vague idea of something like a horizontal rotating
bookcase which would turn to emphasise the aspect you are editing, but
still show, for instance, pitch while you are editing velocity.
There should be options for traditional notation, hybrid or piano roll
(nice for chromatic scales) as now.

A crucial feature of real music which MIDI neglects is phrasing, how
you move from one note to another, especially on a continuous
instrument like a violin. MIDI sequencers are geared more to
individual notes. Some kind of graphic pitch bend editor is needed.

Yes, that's what I think. A core program with well documented
facilities for plug-ins and comprehensive ARexx support, including
commands for making requesters, as is documented for B&P tools.
If we could agree on a spec for this, there is some chance it could
get coded, whereas a complete 2 Meg program is too much for one or two
ppl to tackle.

Could we think up a program which would be simple, like DPaint, when
you first turn it on, and be able to be built up later as add-ons get
written?

No clones. We need to go on to the next step in interface design. 
But look at all of the existing software for good ideas.

I can represent a different point of view from you as I am _not_ a
musician. I doubt if I will ever be able to play an instrument to a
good standard. But I would like to have a program I could use to
explore and learn about music composition, and to link up sound to
animation.
So there are many users of this kind of software.

It seems to be best to use pre-rendered and hand-optimised bitmaps for
small sizes, up to 24 pixels, and outlines above that. Adobe have made
bitmaps of their fonts for the Mac.
It is easy on the Amiga to combine the two, as the system will use a
bitmap if there is one, and scale an outline if not. You just set up a
bitmap font drawer with the same name as the outline.

Just check out those urls and look at the descriptions, reviews,
screenshots. For everything, not just Cakewalk.

It is almost beside the point for our purposes whether the stuff works,
or works well. It is just a set of ideas to steal, avoid, or learn from.

You know the old saw: If you're going to steal, steal from the pros!

Catch you on the funway!

So far I think most of the conversation has gone well here.
A bit of knee jerking is going to be involved no matter what,
but so far I have not seen a thread disentegrate in to the
normal flame wars you see almost every where else.
In some cases people are going to exspress a strong personal
preference on a subject or product. "That sux" "This rulez".
In most of those cases it's the reponders that start over-reacting.
In one case I stated I hated KCS, then I hate KCS. I've used KCS, CW 5.0
and 6.0 and I didn't like them. 
Acussing me (not you greenboy) or anyone of being ignorant,
uninformed, or not learning it well enough to qualify an opinion
is pointless, and eggs on time consuming nothing-ness. If we are
going to talk about the next gen sequencer for amiga, I suggest maybe
we ignore sequencer names completely and instead start to compile a
list of the features that should be included. 3 groups of features
possibly.
Everyone close their eyes, reach in and pull out a good thing from a
sequencer
they like or don't like, and we'll go from there.
#1 the most essential basic utilities to start, #2 the advanced features
for
the power user, and then #3, the wish list features. And I don't care
what
sequencers, Mac, PC, or Ami the features are drawn from and it shouldn't
matter at all. Of course there will be disagreement in what one might
call
essential and another calls advanced, but that's a task for another day.
Let's
start with the list first. I can try to keep a list of suggestions, but
if some one
wants to help compile it, lets do it.

BTW RanKOn doesn't sound too bad for a working name if the new sequencer
:)
Any one know how camoflague is doing? I havn't heard any thing new
latley. 
I have not used it, but it looks far from the idea I have in mind for an
interface.

Actually Amiga's compugraphic engine doesn't do that hot of a job with
many faces, until you get up in the 36point range. But you should see the
latest font-smoother in (here comes a stoning for the blasphemer now!)
Windozzze. In Netscape, FI, you can take a TT or PS down to maybe 6pt and
the letters still hold up and are readable. Any of them at 8 points look
as good as a properly-designed bitmap - and are antialiased! This really
smokes for multiresolution and configurability issues!

If my Amiga weren't waiting for a processor, I'd be playing with the font
smoother I saw  announced (Amiga Web Directory? Aminet?) for graphics-card
users, right now. In conjunction with the for-so-long-now-Beta patch that
allows one to use PS fonts as system fonts.

See you on the funway!

Thanks Rich. It just looked to me like you were asking a help question

A respected PC prog whose name I shall not mention does this well. It can
take a digital audio track, construct a tempo map complete with bar-lines,
and is easily editable. It can also make groove templates from audio or
sequences, so as to fit "the feel of the real" and still have some
quantizing to nip the bummers into place.

This is also great for a band-oriented approach, because tracks can be
recorded in real time with all those wonderful "performance anomalies",
and any needed midi work can really fit in, be expanded upon, etc.

[I can't believe some of the ppqn quotes I'm seeing these days! I would
think 480 or 960 would be sufficient! Its a magnitude higher than we
started out with.]

Like the Caligari [True Space] 3d prog's interface. Serious horsepower
needed, and you can BET sequencers of the future will all have something
like this. Will we be the first?

And a event-editing window, that allows you to work with each data
ala original Dr --whoops! - I mean, that sequencer that originated on
the AtariST from a developer who was around even before that.

Most pro sequencers for the past decade (has it been that long?) have
graphic editing for all types of CC (continuous controller) events.
Various thinning and filtering methods are usually present. On our
platform M____-X was a good example.

I love your thoughts and ideas Don, especially the 3d model. It has
movies of MidiMangler v6.07 playing in the old noggin already!

I've met alot of "musicians" that couldn't play. And run for it when they
try to sing :) A good app for learning on ami is music shop, the other
title from blue ribbon, but you still need to get a keyboard or guitar
along with a chord book to acompany it. If you find you can't sleep
at night becase playing is more important, then I think you call your
self a musicain and actually get some lessons. But as you say, it
is still a necessary tool for any one who just wants to add sound and
music to their video work.

Personal Paint has a standard IFF file with 2 sizes of tool icons. Any
user can edit these if they like. This could be extended to give more
sizes, or the icons could be stored as simple structured graphics
(DR2D?) and rendered to size.

He has a nice looking web site at sylvantech.besler.org/~talin
The links back to his home page don't work. There are some essays
which are worth reading.
I have thought that as the Amiga gets going again it could be worth
while to try to wake him up.

Agreed. Old way bad. Modular good! [But not modular in the sense of Todor
Fays' Soundscape. Every session with it involved much configuring before
plunking even a note!]

Intelligent defaults for the first time the user boots, and until he
familiarizes himself with the program, have long been a hallmark of a
good title. But supplying a SET of defaults/presets for different user-
profiles would be better yet (would you like to play a game of chess,
Dave?)

Another approach would be that of a Setup Wizard (idea nicked from the
evil empire of William the Astonished). It will walk the user through
initial setup while familiarizing him with perhaps a few concepts.

Gotta have:

Online help bubbles and hypertext, with an auto-connect to a support
website would be nice also. No more waiting for bugfixes, or updates.

Automatic user-registration at first connect - no more reg cards
moldering away at the bottom of the box.

CDRom distribution: its the turn of the millenium now. [As an additional
service the user will be assured nothing is going to crash forever at the
strike of Twelve.]

And it should be what you call Type 2, as is the Amiga OS.
People will actually buy a computer to use a good piece of music
software. People buy Acorn computers so they can use Sibelius.

If Troy can do a bit of coding and is brave enough to let some of us
see his rough ideas, we can come up with something very good, I think.

Oh yeeeaaah... I remember an early software that was on DOS and Amiga,
Roger Powell's TEXTURE (stand back, boys, I am naming names here!). It
got some good write-ups in "musiciany" mags; they thought it quite good
for a PC sequencer!

Well it was Type 1 at best - and it needed a MPU401-compatible (Roland/PC)
midi interface to get things rolling. Not Amiga -standard. Pretty much
everything on the AtariST and Mac could run rings around it. But it really
wasn't Roger's fault, he was a musician first (that can be good I realize)
who bought into the PC back when its resources as a GUI/sound/intelligent
computer were virtually nil. And the port was pretty much verbatim.

I hope I pray. Because I haven't seen one piece of sequencer/audio
software for years that wasn't a team effort on the coding. Some of them
might have started as one person in front of a pizza and a sixer of Jolt.

But sustainability and improvement, for ware that is WAY underrated in
complexity and intelligent design (Hey, we're talking about a tool for Art,
commerce, education, AND entertainment here, folks!) - well a team is
necessary. And don't forget how many generations of improvement the truly
good titles of this category have evolved through.

Ah PPaint was great! And will be upgraded again I hear. Cloanto has really
become a class act. Nice site too. I like the structured gaphics, goes with
the structured fonts. ;-) But I wonder about overhead.

Now on the hotlist, thanks Don.

As an aside, and perhaps I even asked you this six months hence: was that
you I saw with Jennif -- I mean, was that you who used to do all that
great stuff for GEnie's Amiga stuff? (sorry, I get sidetracked...)

forward, into the past!

Is this different from the requester you get with the magnifying glass
in B&P? This allows you to type in exact times (very useful for
putting in footsteps at SMPTE times), velocities, etc.

I've always liked it better than the tack-on mag lense in B&P. It is a
full-scrollong window with every single midi event that occurs on that
track, and allows direct-input data entry. Its been awhile, but I
believe it filter/toggles channels different types of data, etc - so that
if you just want to see and edit noteon-duration-velocity events you can.
Global edits were also possible.

In B&P it isn't as integral.

Here is the first aborted attempt at discussing the music program we are
all waiting for. About a month ago (funny it seems longer to an old duffer
like me. Aah, the twilite years...) One spelling has been corrected, other-
wise it is an actual historical documentation.

Ther are some ideas here, so I asked Don to peruse his archives, as mine
have been relegated to Trantor. Any opinions I might decide to change
later - or have already - I'll let you know, Don! Or not.

A colorful 3D program with multi-windowing and a high degree of
interface configurability is the best bet. This would include the
choices of color in the display, windows with movable gadgetry ala MUI
apps (IBrowse, YAM), windows that have expanded and contracted views
for different functional areas (like Nutscrape Messenger, FI).

I prefer different windows for different modes of use, preferably that
could even be promoted to their own public screens. A graphic selector
bar could toggle between screens (or bring sleeping windows to surface).
One of the menu headers could be WORKSTYLE, and would show all currently
saved window/screen configurations including gadget states, collapsed
areas if any, and assignable keyboard setups.

The program would be shipped with a set of these WORKSTYLES that
ntelligently addressed different needs and levels of expertise. The
default WORKSTYLE in the shipped version would allow for a very
fast--as painless as possible--learning curve for all the basic needs.

An ARexx-accessing macro recorder (and editor) along the lines of the
beauties found in ImageFX or PageStream--with logical functions (ADD,
AND, OR, XOR, etc)--available would allow the design and exchange of
plugins.

Of course, common and not so common musical functions such as
arpeggiation, metric manipulation, time-stretch, feel, transpose, and
chord-voicing (love those guitar voicings available in B&P!), centered
and non-centered inversion would also be achievable, and capable of
being chained, and assigned to gadget icons.

An auto-compiler module would be available to make opaque code from that
arexx. The compiled tools would run faster, for situations that
warranted it. This would also allow third-party developers some
additional security.

All midi editing functions would be accessible during playback/
recording. All graphic editing windows would be qualifier-linked to
value-displaying windows of the same data, and would autoscroll and
value-change in synchronization.

Well, that's enough for now.

1. recording of live performance via MIDI input, with matching up of
bar lines to fit the played tempo. Edit using a hybrid display, with a
few stages of undo. Quantisation including swing (and respecting the
varying tempo). Perhaps smooth out tempo changes. Play to MIDI with
tools on
output, such as instrument selection, harmony.  Also use short samples
like
8SVX instrs, but also in 16-bit, via retargetable audio.

2. Pattern editor input for drum rhythms, song structure editor, track
edit display in piano roll, notation, and continuous pitch (marked in
frequencies) format. Snap to key, beat. Spline curve editing for pitch
bend (theremin, or circling helicopter sound). Keyboard tunings for
different temperaments. Animation window, SMPTE lock. Amiga keyboard
input. Notation printing. Vibrato. Different setups for various types
of work. Lots of tools.

3. Very good notation printing; Postscript output. String section with
36 separate string players. Link up to Soundprobe, which by then
should have pitch-to-MIDI. Algorithmic composition. Automatic fugues.

Don 
(who is listening to Heifetz playing a Beethoven violin sonata and
wondering how exactly you could notate the performance).

What, her??? No, that was someone else.

Yes, there is a disk full of genies for Gold Disk products, plus some
scripts for ADPro and others that I tinker with now and then. I'm
never sure whether it is enough for me to call myself a developer!

I see someone is setting up a payment service for shareware, so I
might try it out again. Larry Hickmott at LH Publishing sold the disk
for a while. It made about enough to buy a monitor.

The most recent are a couple of standalone progs, one for sorting
files into directories and one for listing the version numbers of all
the files in a drawer.

Greetings Don,

Absolutely.

Yes, which brings to mind the tempo map in B&P.

>At right angles to the time there are several dimensions: pitch,
>loudness, instrument, effects (echo etc), envelopes of notes, and

This is the minutiae within the big picture of course. These all show up
in the B&P window and I think they were headed in the right direction
with this. Individual timeline parameters for individual tracks.

>I have a sort of vague idea of something like a horizontal rotating

I think B&P does this OK but it could indeed be improved upon.

A window for a window in a window? Yes maybe click on the pitch timeline
in the edit window to bring a decent pitch editor up.

It would be nice to have a "live" drummer setting the tempo for the sequencer.
 One way to do this could be to put a mic in the bass drum connected to the
input of a cheap 8bit sampler.  The software could judge the tempo from the
time between the the "spikes" the sampler was getting from the bass drum.  Of
course you could also use the Sunrize input instead of an 8bit sampler for
this but, you would probably be useing it as part of the sound/show.

Just an idea for any programmers out there.
Or maybe it's a really stupid idea, i don't know.  ;)

Great idea if you substitute a piezo sensor for the mic (too interactive).
The trigger pad could actually interface to available midi solutions
instead of using an audio sampler. (You've probably seen my mentions of
Cakewalk's being able to convert an audio track into a tempo map or
groove template, and this is the purpose it serves as well).

There are two ways to think about the kick drum data. Either you convince
the drummer to play the meter - normally a 4-on-the-floor (shades of
disco!). This would much resemble the tap-tempo feature first seen on
Sequential Circuit's Studio440 drum sequencer/sampler in the late '80s.

Alternately, you design an algorythm that can pull the tempo out of
what kick patterns a drummer actually LIKES to play, perhaps with an
intervention requester, asking for a meter or tap before the song
actually begins (four kicks instead of drumstick clicks to start the
band?). The algorythm then has a context to extrapolate from, what is
actually happening to the tempo without constraining the drummer.

I see hiccups for a design generation or three here though. Even piezos
in a loud, resonating environment false-trigger. Threshold settings can
only do so much. Also, any tap-oriented realtime feature actually needs
several taps in a sample/grouping to see how timing is fluctuating, thus
what it does to midi output is always that much behind.

Similar to the lag-time guitarists have faced on the low strings when
driving midi-rigs, especially when using sounds with sharp ADSRs.

But Midi Mangler should be able to do it, right?

I was just thinking. I have thrown alot of opinion
around here latley and I just thought some of you
might like to hear some of the recordings I've done
with S16 , B&P and Ami to get an ideal of what I do.
Not everyone likes the some type stuff, so you won't
hurt my feelings if you don't like the sytle. As an example,
I don't like most country myself, but I can still appreciate
the work they put in it. If some one has a place I can up
load some large stereo files that others can get to if they
want, I'll put up a couple of working samples. I tried once to 
clip some samples, crunch them from 41khz to 16khz
and make them into 1-2 meg files, but they sounded
like crap after that. I wonder if aminet has a limit? They
have tons of mods. I wonder if samples count?

Hi, Troy! Sounds like a good idea for a website: streaming or downloadable
RealAudio, studio pics, etc.

Not trying to sidetrack anybody, but I really don't care if another
mid-level sequencer is ever built. Partly because this is not what I would
use, but mostly because (for other than those who get some satisfaction
designing it) the marketplace is littered with 'em.

(1) Past Amiga low- and mid-level sequencers have sunk without a trace;
there are still quite a few titles we haven't even mentioned here.

(2) The sequencers that WERE arguably hi-level, like B&P, are now mid-level
anyway (and that is if you have it running in conjunction with Studio16!).

No sense in reinventing the wheel. Unless you are attaching it to a
vehicle that is going to take us, and others, new places. The core/modular
concept needs to be boilerplated around a high-end model in order for the
end-product to be able to meet low-, mid-, and hi- expectations without
gaping design flaws.

And it had better be reach-for-the-sky ambitious about THAT design spec,
because by the time it is done, others will have raised the bar yet again -
and that is true whether we are talking interface or features. One needs
be brutally pragmatic about this at the same time one is dreaming a big
dream - a real balancing act. Head in clouds, feet on ground.

Which brings me around to my next concern: developer's status. Amiga OS
3.5 will be out, probably this summer. Regardless of what you have heard,
this is a new threshold. Even if OS 3.5 seems to be a mild step, it is
part of a larger spec that sets the path for future Amiga OS, hardware,
and software development.

If we are to go beyond pipe-dream play, developer's status is a must.
Personally, I don't want to use a piece of software that is banging the
hardware, not using system software resources (properly), etc.

Last time the world changed, all kinds of hacks like mode-promoters FI,
became necessary clutter on our systems, and added to potential and real
instabilities. All because some developers wouldn't bring their products
up to current standards. Many of them, when confronted, admitted that it
would be no easy task to add these fixes because of their earlier
practices. We don't even need to discuss the orphaned programs.

Even before checking out 3.5, I am not in the least bit interested in
anything that feels it has to support lower than 68020 coding, or 3.1 OS.
Probably any software that is sufficiently advanced is going to crawl on
anything less than an 040, and 3.1 has been around a long time and has
features that are needed for the "Midi Mangler Audio Pro" to NOT BE
obsolescent the moment it comes out.

If the Amiga is to become a desirable platform again, the standards and
visions need rise above the current level, which is for the most part
based on pre-94 titles and technologies. Otherwise what is the point?

I don't pretend to be able to pull this off alone. Hell I'm not
even a good C programmer, YET. I was an ACE 10 years
ago, able to walk on my hands backwards blind folded and
still do code that worked great and baffeled other students,
teachers and programmers, but I have to knock off alot of
rust. In '89 I decided I couldn't sit at a computer and do code
all day so I moved on to other things. (mistake? maybe)
I couldn't know then that a good programmer would pull in
100k+ salary some day.
I also have to learn 2 new things to me, C and the
complete Ami OS. An insane task if I ask myself, but I'm gonna
do it in short order (I hope) One thing I can do with your help
is to start a project inovative enough to attract other resources.
Mean time I'm up to my arse in C and Ami books and on 
programming mailing list and internet sources, while pulling
4-5 hours sleep. I'm a beleiver in prayer, so if you have one,
drop one for me that I don't melt down before I'm through :)
I'f off to start the rough interface layout......

I was born with promark sticks in my hands :)
I later learned other instruments, but the
one thing I struggle with is getting B&P to do
that perfect tempo I'm looking for some times.
Also I would like to be able to play drums strait
in to the sequencer with varing tempo. B&P can't
properly quantize a "live" variable input. No sequencer
I know can do it. Does any one else? The drummer
of the band should be the master here. Not the Click,
Click of the sequencer. Of course you can edit tempo
with B&P, but as soon as you start to try, you have killed
the spontaneous rythm you wanted in the first place.
The perfect tempo many times comes as you play,
not as you're trying to think about how to play. Good
natural tempos often spawn great songs.
Whe you try to map tempos in an editor,
you're out of right brained creativity and into left brain
techno garb with editing. ( do I have my brains right? :)
What you thought might be a silly ideal could be one of the
features I think would sell this to many of those users
and bands that want the human sound of music and
not the techno pop sound from the computers they avoid.
Drummers keep their jobs despite drum machines, and the
ami sequencer finds it's home in the music industry. I think
it's a DAMN GOOD idea. And I'm thinking how to get the
code to respond to it already.

Seen my post on this? Various stand-alone and software seqs have done it,
but the limitations I've stated are tough to bypass.

Dedicated hardware devices like The Russian Dragon (look closer at that
name!) have handled this (introduced NAMM '90 or so). A few years ago
another buzz was the Hotz Controller, that worked with feel. There have
been many ways to do it, but (sorry>) Cakewalk probably is the way to go.
Track the band playing live as digital audio, while recording whichever
part would seem to make the most coherent tempo-track. Then use it to
drive all midi and overdubs.

One reason DA belongs in a sequencer is so we can use live time, and for
styles of music that demand it, acoustic instruments - without making 'em
peg to a click, or a drumbox. Even playing triggered samples with pads in
real time and recording DA is preferable for some material, instead of
recording to sequencer.

>Drummers keep their jobs despite drum machines

I used to laugh in the eighties, when drum machines and synths and
samplers were considered so ominously threatening. In the band scene they
are no more or less than any other instrument now.

I'm probably your worst nightmare on this list, troy.;} You ask a ? and I
come back at you with a do-you-want-to-or-don't-you? You say something
and I say, No, That Won't Do. You see a one-guy-gets-it-out-the-door
project. And I see at least two code-hardened leapers, tacking it out. ;)

And I hope that you have not taken this too personally, as I wish the best
for your future. But let me explain: I have beta-tested and been a power-
user in this field for some time now, and have been frustrated time and
again, as programs on other platforms stole the march.

I was a pain-in-the-ass as a beta tester. I didn't just report bugs, I
demanded features. I watched most of my pleas go unheeded for Amiga
music programs. The Amiga didn't get out of the gate too well with
music to start with either: the first midi sequencers got their clock the
wrong way and were thus deficient in timing accuracy. It didn't help that
the otherwise pathetic AtariST had midiports and was cheaper.

But each time things were needed to go big league, developers in the
sequencer marketplace dropped the ball. More than once I've mentioned
having more than 16 midi channels. At a time when many hobbyist users
needed at least 32 - and even DOS PCs supported more - it was impossible
to get an Amiga developer to commit. (and they could have used existing
hardware - all they had to do was build hooks to it ).

Even if Amiga hadn't gone through The Fire, not ONE of these developers
are around today. I'm sure they blame(d) the Amiga marketplace, piracy,
music-mags, etc. But there were plenty of opportunities to establish
healthier marketshares. They just wouldn't do what was needed.

For quite awhile they competed against similar developers with similar
resources. Midi was still pretty new also; anything was possible. The
developers that excelled on the ST moved on to the Mac. The Mac houses
REALLY believed in excellence - always adding features, improving
interfaces, and expanding their sights.

Many of the early small operations on other platforms are now considered
the GIANTS. They still evolve in ease-of-use, meeting the needs of the
users and practicing innovation. They deserve the success they have won.
The only Amiga sequencer house that was truly progressive (and BTW,
listened to users and beta-testers) was BlueRibbon. They even learned how
to market. And their savvy is why M$ "stole" 'em.

I tell you (and anyone else) these things, so that no unassailable naiveties
or delusions that have killed all Amiga sequencer predecessors will be
fostered. Then you (we) have a chance. Take care.

Interesting, maybe B&P tools could acces the Ad516/Studio16 or via another
sample editor like sound FX, ,Wrench, Soundprobe or maybe the Prostation software.

Some Ideas.

Maybe a sampler tool, use your Ad516 as Sampler with some realtime fx like
Echo, Reverb etc etc.

Send samples via a B&P tool from th AD516 to a Midi Sampler.

A tool for the TB303 Emulator/Tracker.

A tool for a connection with a CD burn program like MasterISO and MakeCD.

Sounds great to me, but is it possible.
