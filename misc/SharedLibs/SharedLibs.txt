  Amiga Shared Libraries now and on future Amiga compatible Systems
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Of course any shared library for the Amiga intends to be compileable
  with any available Amiga C compiler - without any major changes to
  the source code - and maybe in the future also running under any
  Amiga compatible operating system with any CPU.

  The first goal seams to be easily done: nearly any noticeable compiler
  for the Amiga does support generation of libraries with special
  linker commands and pre-generated object files.

  But when looking into the details, one will find out, that these
  linker functionality just reduces the influence of the programmer
  on how his sources are handled, that the pre-generated object
  files just originally were done in Assembler, and that each compiler
  does define its own interface definitions and usage rules.

  But as a programmer, it is important to have control over the _complete_
  source code and to be able to compile it _anywhere_ with only
  minor changes, even better without any changes.

  Since most Amiga system modules - noticeable Libraries, Devices and
  Resources - do have startup-modules and other larger parts completely
  written in Assembler language, the most important task for getting
  inter-compiler and operating system independant sources in my opinion
  is, to completely migrate the interfaces to C language (but different
  to AROS, for example, it is most important, to keep the sources running
  under the current 68k AmigaOS in the _first_ place).

  Well, some work already has been done. Publicly.

  Most goals basically have been reached already, still missing of
  course are some of the less Amiga-native compilers and of course
  tests with any kind "AmigaOS for PowerPC".

  But since Assembler is nearly as portability-hostile as BCPL _today_
  we might be quite close to the goal defined above.

  Translate your 68k-assembler library startup-codes smartly
  to C by simply using this source-code as an advice how to do it:
