This archive contains a text file describing a new DCTV display
mode as well as example images. You must view the images via
any standard IFF viewer (that does not alter an image upon loading)
through your DCTV. The images will NOT load properly into any DCTV
program, so do NOT try to display them in DCTVpaint, convert, etc.
Just load them into a viewer and view them through your DCTV.

I did not include the original image in this archive (considering you may
be downloading this long-distance... and I asssume you already have it on
your DCTV disk #3). The original size and format of the image was 4-bit
109614k (Froggie.dctv). See figure3 for the conversion!

After conversion. The best looking 2-bitplane image ever generated
by an Amiga. Would you believe that this image is really only comprised
of 4 RGB colors! Size; 63734k. A savings of 45880k without compression.
Imagine the possibilities!

Figure 4/5:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Figure 4 (101762k) was created directly within DC-Paint. Figure 5 (48622k)
shows the image after conversion to 2-bit. A savings of 53140k, but you can
see problems with some of the gradient fills.
