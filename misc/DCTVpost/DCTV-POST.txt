OVERVIEW:
 
I'm not a programmer. I'm an "idea" man ;) In other words, most
of the time I don't know what the heck I'm talking about :) BUT,
this time I think I have discovered something of interest (at least to
DCTV owners). I discovered the methods discussed within this text
via unorthodox methods (to say the least). I am offering them as "food
for thought" and "speculation".. hoping that a clever programmer can
indeed put these ideas to use, correcting my mistakes and adding
his/her own ideas along the way. I will update this POST if any
software development occurs, or any new information concerning DCTV
is offered.
 
If you do embark on a software project based on these ideas.. be sure
to e-mail me and I will add the information to these documents.
 
Enjoy! And please feel free to e-mail me your responses, additions and
corrections. Any technical data/info concerning DCTV would also
be welcome.

                       BREAKTHROUGH DCTV DISPLAY MODE!

Roughly 5 years after its introduction DCTV remains a popular Amiga
display board and a viable alternative to 24-bit display devices.
Portability, compatibility with all Amiga systems and the ability
to play high speed million color animations are just a few of the
features that have contributed to its long lasting popularity. Within
the last 5 years there have been many other improvements in Amiga
display technology. The introduction of AGA chips and 24-bit display
devices offering "programmable" resolutions may have left many DCTV
owners feeling a bit limited by there rather sparse selection of
display mode options. In an attempt to add more variety (and
excitement) to the Amiga/DCTV display arsenal, this article will
introduce a NEW DCTV display mode that will allow faster animations
and greatly reduce file sizes. Dust off your DCTV and get ready
to Rock'n Roll!
 
 
DCTV constructs its composite video output from special screen data
contained in an Amiga hi-res, 3 or 4 bitplane display. The 4-bit
mode delivers the highest possible display quality, while the 3-bit
mode sacrifices a small amount of image detail to produce smaller
file sizes and animations that play at a higher frame rate. Since
there are no software options for a 1 or 2 bitplane display mode you
may have assumed that DCTV requires at least an Amiga 3-bitplane
display to function properly. You're in for a pleasant surprise.
I have discovered that DCTV is quite capable of functioning in an
Amiga 2-bit mode while retaining most of its composite color palette
and display quality. Since the 2-bit mode is not supported in any
way by the software, it's currently impossible to directly create a
2-bit DCTV image. To demonstrate the potential of the 2-bit mode we
will need to use a separate program to convert a previously created
image. What follows is an explanation of the conversion process in
the form of a mini-tutorial.
 
For this exercise you'll need DCTV disk#3 (included with DCTV) and
the image processor Pixmate. I have not found another image
processor capable of generating the required results. It's pointless
to use a program that first converts an image into 24-bits (ADPro,
ImageMaster) since DCTV only needs up to 4-bits to comprise an image.
It's also important to note that the Pixmate program has been
discontinued. All descriptions of screens and controls are
representative of version 1.1.
  
Before we begin make sure your DCTV is connected, we'll want to
view how our actions within Pixmate effect the composite image.
When a Pixmate control window opens on the image it may distort or
block the composite display. Holding the right mouse button down
will temporarily remove the window allowing you to view your progress.
A two monitor set-up is ideal, but a single monitor with RGB
switching (such as the 1084s) will suffice.
  
I will describe the conversion process in two major steps. We'll
start by converting the image into its 2-bit form, and then rap
things up by making a few necessary color adjustments. After we
have finished this tutorial I'll discuss the reasons some images do
not convert well and further possibilities for this new display mode.
Let's go!
 
             
                         STEP #1: BITPLANE BUSTING.
 
 
Start Pixmate and then load the picture named froggie.dctv (found in
the images drawer on DCTV disk #3). DCTV will not detect or display a
composite image while the Pixmate menu bar is active. Disable the
menu bar by selecting the "toggle title" item from the EDIT menu.
The froggie.dctv image should now appear in all of its composite
glory. (figure 1.)
  
Choose the DISPLAY item from the "effects" menu to open the display
control panel. Looking at the gadgets that represent image bitplanes
you'll notice that number's 1 through 4 are highlighted (indicating
that we're working with a 4 bitplane image). When working with a 4
bitplane DCTV image you will always want to discard plane numbers 1
and 2 (only plane number 1 for 3-bitplane images). We can't actually
remove the planes at this time, so we will temporarily render them
inactive. De-select the number 1 and 2 gadgets and then close the
display window to exit back to the main screen. Our composite image
should exhibit a noticeable loss of color and a small reduction in
detail.
 
Next, go to the "color" menu and select the PACK COLORS item. Pixmate
will then process the RGB image and re-map the palette. This process
does not generate a viewable difference in the composite image, but
it's a required step before performing any further actions. You can
also use the LESS COLORS item from the "color" menu to achieve the
same results (by inputting a "4" for the number of colors to use) but
the process is slower than simply selecting PACK COLORS.
 
Once again choose the DISPLAY item from the "effects" menu to open
the display control panel. The bitplane gadgets will again indicate
that we're working with a 4-bitplane image. This time de-select plane
numbers 3 and 4 (you should not see a change in the image) and then
select the REFORM gadget. A requester will pop up informing you that
"image bitmap change will permanently discard some bitplanes, reducing
the number of colors." Since we have already processed and re-mapped
the appropriate colors, we have nothing to lose by continuing. Select
CHOP PLANES to remove the unwanted bitplanes and transform our
picture into a 2-bit image (figure 2).
 
Now that we have chopped the unwanted planes and reduced the number
of colors, it's time to proceed to step #2 and do some tricky tweaking
(say that 5 times, fast) of our images' palette.
 
 
                            STEP #2: PALETTE MAGIC.
 
 
Our newly converted 2-bit image has little or no color and an annoying
flicker. Correcting the image is a fairly easy and straight forward
process. Let's get to it.
 
There are two different methods we can use to achieve the results we
desire. The first method offers fairly precise control over color
correction, while the second method offers less control but is an
easier and faster process to perform. Both are capable of excellent
(and practically identical) results.
 
Method  #1:
 
Select the "palette" item from the COLOR menu. A small window will
appear containing a somewhat standard Amiga palette adjuster. You'll
see the familiar RGB sliders and color value information.
 
Before we begin adjusting color levels, it's important for you to
remember that we're working with a DCTV image. The palette controls
will effect our composite display in a vastly different way than an
ordinary RGB display. Also, because of small differences between
certain DCTV equipped Amiga systems the color values given below may
be slightly different from those required on your system. If you
experience problems, experiment to find the most effective values.
 
For this image (and the majority of images you will convert) only the
blue-levels for each color need to be adjusted. We will start with
the last color on the right (color 3) and work left to color 0. I
have listed all 4 setting adjustments below as steps A through D.
 
A. Select color 3 and use the blue-level adjuster to increase the
color value to a setting of 87F (all the way to the right). Checking
your composite display you should immediately notice a considerable
improvement in image color.
 
B. Select color 2 and increase the blue-levels to a value of 87E.
You should notice a massive improvement in the composite image.
 
C. Choose color 1 and increase the blue-levels to a value of 00F
(again, all the way to the right). You may not see a dramatic change
in the composite image, but there is an improvement. (Sliding the
adjuster back and forth to different values will give you an idea
of how this setting effects the display).
 
D. Some areas of the image will still contain small horizontal lines
(most visible on the eye of froggie). Select color 0 and increase the
blue-levels to a value of 00E. You should notice a subtle
"color-smoothing" effect which reduces horizontal lines leaving our
final image (figure 3) closely resembling its original 4-bit quality.
Welcome to the wonderful world of million color 2-bit DCTV images!
 
Before we celebrate our successful conversion and rap up the tutorial,
I'll quickly demonstrate the second method of correcting image color
and detail. You may wish to save this image before we proceed in
order to compare the separate results.
 
Method #2:
 
If you still have the palette window open, close it to return to the
main screen. Select "undo changes" from the EDIT menu to return our
image to its "pre-color-corrected" appearance.
 
Choose The "color bias" option from the COLOR menu. A window will
appear offering a variety of image enhancement controls. Unlike
the RGB sliders offered by the palette window, these controls effect
the entire range of colors, not just one specific color at a time.
 
The only control we need to adjust is the blue-level slider. Simply
increase the value to 57 (the highest setting possible without causing
distortion) and you'll see an immediate and vast improvement in the
composite image. Using this single control you can quickly and easily
achieve results similar to (if not identical to) those obtained using
method #1.
 
By experimenting with the controls on the color bias panel and palette
window you may find that other interesting enhancements or image
effects are possible. It's also worth noting that DCTV is even capable
of displaying composite data from an Amiga 1-bit image.. (although
the display quality is very poor).
 
 
                                 PROOF POSITIVE!
 
 
Our final image (figure 3) does exhibit a small amount of streaking
and color flicker in some areas, but I'm sure you'll agree that it's
the most impressive looking 2-bit image ever generated by a computer.
Considering the methods used to create this display I think the results
are quite remarkable. This image proves that it's possible to display
a DCTV image within 2-bitplanes while retaining a large enough palette
to achieve high quality results. In my opinion, this image rivals any
comparable ECS Amiga generated display. When it comes to file size
and animation speed (I'll get to those in a moment) the HAM6 and HAM8
display modes cannot compete.
 
A reduction in file size is one of the real advantages of generating
a DCTV display within 2-bitplanes. The original file size of the
4-bit froggie.dctv image was 109614 bytes and our 2-bit version
weighs-in at only 63734 bytes. That's a savings of 45880 bytes
without any added file compression! Obviously the results will vary
depending on the image being converted, but I have found that most
images will yield at least a 40-50% reduction in file size, while
in certain instances you may achieve a 50-60% (or greater) reduction. 
 
We have not only achieved a savings in storage space, we have also
gained an increase in display speed. Try viewing the image with a
display utility and you should notice that it appears on screen faster
than the original 4-bit image. Loading the image in to a program such
as Deluxe-Paint and then creating a small animation (using the MOVE
requester) should make the speed increase even more apparent.
 
With such a dramatic reduction in image file size and a visible
increase in display speed, the DCTV 2-bit display mode shows great
potential in the area of animation. Let's take a quick look at what
the requirements are to animate in this new mode.
  
 
                          DECLARATION OF ANIMATION!
 
 
At present, the only way to create a DCTV 2-bit animation is to
perform the conversion on each individual anim frame (something I
wouldn't recommend unless you have plenty of time on your hands).
It's impossible to automate the process within Pixmate due to the
programs lack of an Arexx port, and since I have not found another
image processor capable of the same results the need for an entirely
new program arises.
  
To offer a rough idea of the potential anim file size reductions
and increases in animation speed, I opted to manually convert the
SceneryAnim.anim file found on DCTV disk #4. Not having the luxury
of owning a commercial program capable of splitting and compiling
animations, I relied on two programs available on most good BBS's.
BuildAnim2 (by Christer Sundin), and AnimBuild (by Michael Hartman).
BuildAnim2 can perform both splitting and compiling but had problems
compiling this particular anim. I relied on AnimBuild for animation
compiling.
 
Using BuildAnim2 I split the animation into individual frames. I
then performed the 2-bit conversion on the first anim frame and
saved the results. To speed up the tedious process of palette
adjusting I used the Pixmate "Load Palette" option to load my set
palette for each additional frame. After converting all of the
remaining frames I used AnimBuild to re-compile each 2-bit image
back into an anim file.
 
The original anim file size was 452398 bytes. After conversion the
size was reduced to 276810 bytes, a savings of 175588 bytes without
any added file compression. Compressing the converted anim via
PowerPacker yielded an additional 37% reduction in size, for a
total file size of 175196k. That's nearly 200k savings without
added compression and nearly 300k with compression.
 
Satisfied with the reduction in file size I then proceeded to test
the animation on a variety of popular anim viewers. View3.0
(contained on DCTV disk#4) and PPSHOW3.0 displayed the anim without
any problems. View3.6, Superview3.12 and Viewtek2.1 also displayed
the anim properly but required manual centering of the display via
the arrow keys. For an unknown reason the Viewtek program played
the anim with a "glitch" or color blotch on a few frames. This did
not occur with any other viewer.
 
Whichever player program you use, look for the ability to manually
center the display. An improperly centered screen will prevent DCTV
from detecting and displaying an image or anim correctly. (The
2-bit display mode seems to be a bit more sensitive to centering,
make sure animations are centered correctly when recording to video
tape or you may end up with b/w or distorted output.)
  
As far as gaging an actual increase in animation speed, I relied on
the information provided by the View3.6 program. On my SupraTurbo
(28mhz 68000) enhanced Amiga 2000 the stats were as follows.
Before conversion: 6742 avg DLTA, 44,9982 avg FPS. After
conversion: 4092 avg DLTA, 60,0000 avg FPS. Admittedly not the
most accurate test results, but fairly informative. There is a notable
FPS (frames per second) increase and a reduction in avg DLTA (less
pixel changes in the anim,..  which is not surprising considering we
have chopped two bitplanes).
  
Overall I was very impressed with the results. Any loss of image
quality due to the conversion process is far less noticeable while
an animation is playing. I certainly don't believe that the
SceneryAnim conversion is the most effective example of the quality
of 2-bit DCTV animation, but I believe it does give us a basic idea
of its capabilities. You'll have the ability to play longer, more
complex animations at faster speeds while using less storage space
and less memory.
 
 
                         PROBLEMS and POSSIBILITIES:
 
 
Once you have performed the 2-bit conversion on various images, you'll
notice that some pictures do not convert well at all. Keep in mind that
we're using a standard Amiga image processor on DCTV images (It doesn't
"know" which colors it's actually allowed to remove or remap) and we're
working in a DCTV mode that technically does not exist. The results we
obtained in the tutorial are actually quite incredible considering
those factors. Pixmate was only used to demonstrate that DCTV can
indeed function in an Amiga 2-bit mode while generating acceptable
(even desirable) results.
  
A utility designed specifically for performing the conversion would
not only be more convenient to use but also far more effective. It's
possible that a variety of techniques designed to match, antialias
or dither colors could be implemented to further enhance the quality
of converted images. The results would almost certainly be superior
to what we have achieved using Pixmate.
 
The question then arises, why settle for conversion? Current software
could be updated and new software designed to take full advantage of
this new display mode. Paint and digitize software designed to work
within the limitations of the DCTV 2-bitplane palette may not generate
the image streaking or color distortion that often occurs during
conversion. Imagine being able to directly digitize images equal in
quality to our converted froggie.dctv picture while retaining file
sizes in the range of 50-60k. Sounds good to me!
 
I would urge Digital Creations (or PLAY inc.) to support DCTV with
new and updated software, but looking back at there track-record of
only one update in four years, I don't think that's going to happen
any time soon. If they will not support DCTV they should place all
hardware specs and program code in the public domain to promote
the creation of new software. The P.D. approach certainly worked
for BlackBelt's Ham-E device which enjoyed heavy support by 3rd
parties, including direct support within various frame grabbers,
as well as 3 separate paint programs (2 of which allowed animation).
It would be nice to have those kinds of choices with DCTV.
 
While it's true that this new mode is nothing more than a hack of
sorts and that it's certainly not a professional display, I'm sure
there are plenty of artists and animators who can find many
interesting uses for it. If you're working on a low memory or small
HD system it may give you the extra work space and speed increase
you've been looking for. If there are some clever programmers looking
for a challenge, it's a new frontier just waiting to be conquered.
I hope to hear more about this exciting discovery in the future.
 

CHAPTER 2:
The Future of DCTV display programs.. and a NEW type of display!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
© copyright 1996 Joey McDonald
 
 
PROBLEM:
~~~~~~~
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to scroll around huge 1200x1200 DCTV
displays? The DCTV software does not allow the creation of such
large images, and even if you could create such an image... there
is no way to scroll the image due to the fact that DCTV requires
special data on the top and left sides of the display.
 
SOLUTION:
~~~~~~~~~
I noticed that while using the P.D./Shareware program Rend24 that it is
absolutely possible to create HUGE DCTV displays much larger than the
viewable area (by converting large 24bit/jpeg images to DCTV format).
 
However when you try to load one of these images into a viewer that
allows scrolling, you will encounter problems. When you scroll.. DCTV
will not be able to decode the image data. The reason; DCTV requires the
top scanline which contains special information, as well as the left
"zipper" lines (2 vertical lines on the left side). When that data is
moved off screen, the image will not register with DCTV.
 
While tinkering with a p.d. program called Dswitch (that allows you
to do a few odd things with your DCTV.. such as pass video through,
etc.) I noticed that when you select Dswitch's RGB mode that you
can actually scroll from top to bottom of a LARGE DCTV display with
virtually no problems. I'm not a programmer and I'm not sure what the
Dswitch program does to allow this (it was not designed for that purpose).
But, when I found this out.. it got me thinking about HOW it would be
possible to scroll a HUGE DCTV image without any problems.
 
An idea for a new type of DCTV viewer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a special viewer program that does the following; Upon loading
a DCTV picture.. the viewer "clips" the top line (magic cookie) and
the "zipper" on the left. The data is HELD in position (sort of like
a TOP invisible layer to a parallax scrolling screen). The actual image
is displayed UNDER the HELD lines.. (a 2nd screen) and when you scroll
around.. only THAT screen (the 2nd screen) will scroll, the important
information always remains in the same position on the TOP MOST SCREEN.
The top line is absolutely required for top to bottom (up/down scrolling)
and the left zipper lines are required for sideways (left/right) scrolling.
 
There may be a much simpler approach to this... but I have at least
presented an idea and a starting place for a NEW type of DCTV display.
Imagine the possibilities of Huge 1200x1200 -SCROLLING- DCTV backdrops!
I can see possibilities for incredible DCTV video titlers with "rolling"
backdrops, etc.
 
A utility to create HUGE DCTV displays:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
I have already stated that you can create large DCTV images by
converting large 24-bit/jpeg/gif etc. images in a program such as
Rend24. BUT, it would be nice if we had a utility that would allow
us to actually combine several DCTV images into one large super bit-map.
For instance.. combining 4 640x200 images would result in a 1280x400
super bit-map image with a 640x200 scrolling display area. You could
combine as many as you like within the limits of the Amiga display area
(1280x1280 ?). There are many other resolution/screen size options.
 
I know that this will work. I entered DeluxePaint with two DCTV 640x200
displays and stamped them BOTH down on a 640x400 screen. Both images are
displayable as a single scrolling image (the special viewer would be need
for proper display). I did note that a program that combines many DCTV
images into a super bit-map display might need to clip and remove the top
line (magic cookie) from all images below the first (top image). The zipper
must always be properly aligned upon combining images.
 
It would also be nice to have a PAINT program capable of scrolling
through a DCTV super bit-map image. We see the ability to scroll
within "magnafied" sections of an image in DCTV paint, we need
this scrolling ability for images larger than the display area.
Like the old DigiPaint 3 used to do.

CHAPTER 3:
DCTV TIPS and TRICKS!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
© copyright 1996 Joey McDonald
 
 
If you have any Tips or Tricks of your own to share with DCTV owners send
them to:
 
tron@mclv.net
 
You will be given full credit for your tips/tricks.
 
Tip #1: Solving the DCTV "wipe" problem.... By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So, you have a program such as TV-SHOW that has a huge number of
wipes at your disposal.. but they don't work with your DCTV images.
WRONG! get the program Dswitch (it should be available on any good
BBS) and run it in RGB mode ("dswitch R") and almost every wipe will
now work properly with your DCTV images. The dswitch program was not
designed for this purpose.. but I discovered that it has a very nice
effect on wipes. I'm really not sure why.. perhaps a programmer can
come up with an even better solution. You will EVEN be able to use
wipes that scroll from the BOTTOM > UP or MIDDLE > OUT! as long as
there is a prior DCTV image on screen (one DCTV image wiping to the
next). This tip opens up a HUGE assortment of effects to DCTV owners!
You should be able to find Dswitch on any good BBS or possibly
the aminet.
 
Tip #2: Quick Titles!.... By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
If all you need are one or two color titles (white/black/grey/etc)
over million color backdrops.. try this little trick.
 
This Tip will show you how to save time and create quick
titles for your DCTV productions. The titles created can be
used as a quick preview to get an idea of what your finished
product will look like, or perhaps as low-budget titling!
 
Load your DCTV picture into DeluxePaint or similar paint program. try
a 3-bitplane image.. Some 4-bitplane images seem to have a few problems
handling this trick. De-select the menu bar to see the picture. Go to a
spare page (j) and use one of the available colors to create a title.
 
Now cut-out the title as a brush and hit the J key to return to
the DCTV image. If you check your DCTV output.. you'll see that you
are now actually displaying an RGB brush OVER the dctv composite output.
two of the colors available in the color selector will cause severe
distortion so you'll need to select the correct colors. Try selecting
the "color" option and browsing through the available colors to see
how it appears on the composite output. (you may have problems with
distortion when using very large fonts). From here on.... just create
your title as if you were working with a standard IFF pic.
 
You can use the move requester to flip, rotate, spin... and animate
your title OVER the DCTV backdrop. Because the text is RGB it will
be much more crisp than the text created within the DCTV paint
program. (ALWAYS BE SURE NOT TO LET THE TITLE BLOCK OUT THE TOP Line
or left "zipper" lines.. that will distort the image or cause DCTV to
not display it at all).
 
With a little practice you can get great results. The title cannot
have many colors... usually 2 or 3... (Black and White are always
available). You should use the outline option to outline your titles
with a different color so they'll appear more detailed. (white text
outlined by black, black outlined by white.. and if your really
tricky you can add a grey in there somewhere :) Also as noted above,
some 4-bitplane images seem to distort when titles are placed this
way...especially when using large fonts. But remember, you're doing
something you're really not supposed to be able to do (mixing RGB
with DCTV) so experiment to see the different results.
 
With this approach, you can quickly add RGB titles over a DCTV
image without the use of a genlock or the DCTV RGB converter.
The end result is not perfect, but for many low-budget purposes
it may be just the trick! It's also a good way to preview an idea
you may be working on.
 
Also, if you CUT a portion of the DCTV image and shrink it down
("-" key in Dpaint) .. you can create neat "rainbow" brushes that
you can FILL your title with! It gives kind of a "sparkly" rainbow
effect.
 
You can also add 2 color (black and white outlined) RGB animations
(cartoons) over the DCTV million color display.
 
 
TIP#3: Color Cycling with DCTV...(sort of).. By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Load a DCTV image into a program that can alter the color cycling
information of a picture. Because a DCTV image is really an 8 or 16
color IFF.... you can adjust the cycling info. However, since the
DCTV image data is much different than an ordinary IFF you'll get
a BIG HORRIBLE LOOKING MESS..... unless you experiment. By the way,
it seems that 16 color (4-bitplane images) work best for this... but
you should try it with both formats to see which you prefer.
 
The techniques in this tip are really not very practical, but you
never know, you may want to add a bizarre touch to one of your DCTV
video projects.
 
When adjusting the cycling RANGE do not use the first two colors or
any black colors in a range (this will cause the image to blank-out).
 
Adjust the ranges carefully, experiment a bit and you'll see that
you can get some really weird results.
 
 
Tip #4: Pre-DCTV... By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Ever need to find a DCTV image on disk and you're not sure of the
name, and you don't have your DCTV connected. Displaying the image
with a viewer just gives you a giant mess of grey pixels. Using my
program; "PreDCTV" will allow you to view the contents of any DCTV
image through a rough "preview" display. It is VERY rough and only
a palette trick, but it should allow you to check the contents of
a DCTV picture without the need for a time consuming conversion...
or connecting your DCTV. Available on Aminet soon.
 
 
Tip #5: A DCTV workbench backdrop!... By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Converting a DCTV image into 2-bit mode (as described in Chapter 1)
will allow you to actually use the image as a workbench backdrop
with such programs as "simgen". It is a very bizarre effect, but
with the backdrop in place, your workbench is piped through your
DCTV! Experiment with the effect and you never know what you may
come up with.
 
Also, I haven't tried a DCTV back-drop with WB3.0+ yet. It may
allow you to use a standard 8-16 color DCTV image as a back-drop!

Tip #6: DC-WB... By Joey Mcdonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Connect a cable from your Video out (mono-out for A2000 and A500
owners) to the "Video in" on your DCTV (or run the out to a video
in on whatever device you have connected to your DCTV video in).
Now whenever you issue the command "Dswitch V" using the
Dswitch program... you're workbench will be channeled through
your DCTV. This means that you can simply add the commands
"Dswitch V" and "Dswitch N" to your function keys using a program
such as Fkey. Just hitting a key will do the trick. You'll be
using workbench through a composite display.. but you will no
longer need to use the monitor switch.
 
Tip #7: DCTV brushes and ANIM BRUSHES! by Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you load a DCTV animation into dpaint.. you can pick up a
quarter-screen anim brush from the top left corner of a picture. As
long as you pick up the top line and the side zipper, you should
end up with a million color DCTV anim-brush! You use the brush in
such programs as TV-SHOW and Deluxe Video and actually move it
across the screen while it's playing! There may be some "jitter"
during playing. You can also use the same process to pick up
standard brushes and move them around the screen. If you plan
ahead when creating DCTV anims or pictures.. you can re-size
screens within DCTV paint to fill only the top left section..
so when you are clipping in deluxe paint.. you'll have a complete
picture as an anim-brush or brush.
 
Tip #8: Simple uses for the DCTV 2bit mode: By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Here is a simple example of how the mode in its current form can
be used on a very basic level to achieve excellent results.
 
So, you have always wanted to animate in Hi-Res 16 color mode on
your ECS Amiga, but the animations always play "choppy". Well,
the DCTV 2-bit mode will allow you to play just about any 16 color
Hi-Res animation at 2 or 4 color speeds and chop your old DCTV
file sizes in half!
 
Take a 4096 color HAM (or better) animation and re-render it
to dithered 16 color hi-res. Convert the animation to DCTV 2-bit
mode and there will ussually be NO LOSS in detail between the dithered
16 bit anim and the DCTV 2-bit anim. You can also convert existing 16
color hi-res anims and chances are they will convert without losing
detail.
 
The DCTV 2-bit mode allows you to animate DITHERED 16 color hi-res
animations without the "choppy" playback that ussually accompanies
such animations, while offering incredible savings in storage space
and memory use.
 
Once software appears that will allow you to convert anims
automatically, then there will be much less grunt work involved.
 
I have not tested how well this aproach works on dithered 32, 64
or 4096 color ham animations.. but there may be some loss in the
conversion. We will have to wait for new software to see if there
are ways to get the most out of the DCTV 2-bitplane pallette.
 
Also, for those developing DCTV software, a 2-bit display
can handle the display of "buttons" and "control panels". You
could "float" a 2-bit "control panel" screen in front of your
"work" screen.

Tip#9: Fast Animations using other anim formats: By Joey McDonald
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Since I wrote the original DCTV post.. anim7 and 8 arrived. I have
been told that converting anim 5 DCTV animations into the new formats
will yield faster playback... especially on AGA machines.
 
From my own experiance, the SSA animation format used in the programs
CLariSSA and Adorage is by far the fastest available playback for
standard Amiga and DCTV animations. Clarissa 2.0 and Adorage 2.0
were both offered on CU Amiga coverdisks recently. If you haven't
tried the SSA animation format... you -NEED- to. The only problem
with this format is the lack of direct support within other programs
and p.d. anim players. You do recieve an anim player for SSA.. but
it lacks versatility.
