"Well I'll be!" shouted Katriinaenigmamusirmamagnifazzula. "Look at this: Giant
lizards have broken into an alarm clock factory! It can't be anything other
than..." "No it can't!" shouted XYZ. It was, of course, about our old friend
Norlam the wizard, whose experiments with lizards and alarm clocks have failed
sometimes. It had been announced in the "Daily Universe" newspaper, which
Katriinaenigmamusirmamagnifazzula was holding in his hand (or what to call it,
since he looked a lot like a cyan crossing between an octopus, a locust, and a
goat.)

We all jumped (I, Jeemi Bilisdo, the aliens XYZ and Katriinaenigmamusirma-
magnifazzula, my dog Someone Else, and my little sister Riasi) to the space-
ship and flew towards the planet Lipaem, where the publishing house for "Daily
Universe" was located.
  We told the editor (a funny looking ladybirdoid at that) that it wasn't a
serious case. Our wizard friend's business had just gone wrong. "But what about
them?" asked the ladybirdoid in a panic. I turned to look and saw a gigantic
horde of locustoids demonstrating against the local nuclear power centre
(demonstrating what, was never explained). The poor things thought the lizards
were the creation of nuclear power! XYZ and Riasi explained to the locustoids
that it had just been an unsuccesful experiment on our wizard friend's part to
get lizards eat nothing but alarm clocks to save on the upkeep money (phew!).
  So the locustoids left on their starcruisercarriercombination. "Phew, we got
rid of them at last" sighed Katriinaenigmamusirmamagnifazzula and Someone Else.
We could have left for the planet Zomem, had it not been for our ship's fuel
tanks, which were empty. So we went to buy some fuel. The station had a
discount of 0.00000725 percent so we got our fuel for a measly 12 buckazoids!

Then we headed for Zomem, which loomed in front of us after 1 hour, 17 minutes
and 38.072 seconds. I turned the landing lever, and my ship floated gently
down. We stepped down from the ship (XYZ didn't step, she has the ability to
teleport extremely short distances).
  On our way we were always troubled by beetloids, who were representing the
press. They asked stupid questions about Norlam's experiments all the time.
When we got tired of them Someone Else bit one of them on the wing and they
vanished fearing that Katariinaenigmamusirmamagnifazzula would bite, too.

Then we had a tiny little problem. In front of us gauged a huge chasm, which
even the ping pongs that King Kong of Hong Kong makes wouldn't fill. No plant
grew on the edge of the chasm to allow us to climb down. But we all jumped on
XYZ and let her teleport downwards. But it was a mistake. XYZ got to the other
side, but her teleport power only concerns herself, so we all fell down to the
edge of the chasm.
  But I flew Riasi on my ship and Katariinaenigmamusirmamagnifazzula carried
Someone Else, so we managed to cross the chasm.

Then we reached Norlam. He was dizzy and couldn't help us any more than we
could ourselves. But luckily he owns an Interrealmic phone, with which we
phoned Norlam's friend Merlin to come here from his home dimension.
  With the total strength of all seven of us we gathered all the lizards from
across the universe, shrunk them and canned them.
  So that was the end.
