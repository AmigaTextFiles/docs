It was a warm evening in the space station ZOS 5. The commander yawned, and
woke up from his nap. He put on his blue commanding suit, and entered the
elevator. It took him quickly to the bridge. There he met Jansson, the busy
main investigation officer.
  Jansson was very talkative and reported quickly: "Goodeveningcommander.
Ihavesomethingmostunusualtoreport." The commander played back the message to
himself using his audio recorder at slow speed. Then he said: "What is it
then?" and Jansson said: "OurfriendMaxwellhasactedverystrangelyinthepasttwo-
weeks."
  The commander, after clicking the "Stop" button on his small recorder, asked
"So what did he do?" Jansson answered: "Hestayedonthenewplanetwehavediscovered.
HesaidtomehewillcomebackafterhismeetingwithJones, theofficerwhofollowedastar."
He clicked a button on a remote control, and the huge television screen on the
wall came to life.

Firstly showing Jansson's name and the stardate, it then changed to a view of
the planet. The people seemed like pelicans with orange skin. After scanning
the people's data it showed a very unhappy situation: two races at war with one
another. The beings with a red suit with a mark like an upside-down 4 were
winning the beings with a yellow suit with a mark like a fallen B even though
their commander was not present.
  When the last yellow-suited alien waved the green-and-black flag of
surrender, the commander saw Maxwell. He was following a red-suited alien who
took a video message to its hand. It waved its wings, and started running at at
least 120 mph. The screen then followed Maxwell, jumping into his space scooter
and lining up with the alien. He asked it where it was going and whether it
would like a ride. The alien simply snorted: "To my commander. No thanks."
There they went, scooter and pelican, over at least 200 miles.

When they were there, Maxwell seemed to be sure he could hear sizzing. It came
from the alien who was sweating, but the sweat simply boiled away, because of
their natural body temperature of 120 degrees. But there was no time for that,
because he saw an old alien sitting in his throne. He mumbled something to the
messenger, and took the message. It said that the red-suited aliens had won.
  But, the commander was very surprised that Maxwell, instead of watching the
message, hurried quickly to the messenger. It was sizzing and beeping like mad.
Before Maxwell could touch it, its skin cooled to 40 degrees, it fell to his
side and vaporized. It was dead. The screen closed with a boring blip and
Jansson's video message was over.

The commanded sighed and said: "Well it seems that the aliens in this galaxy
are rather mysterious. Did Maxwell give the planet a name, anyway?" Jansson
replied: "Yes. HecalleditMarathon."
