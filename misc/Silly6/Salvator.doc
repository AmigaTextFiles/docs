                I, a salvator of the Universe


The door was open. The wind was blowing as I stepped in. At first I thought the
wind had forced the door open, but then I realised it was far too faint to do
that. Then I remembered I had left the door open myself. Luckily no thieves
abounded in this region, three hundred miles away from any fellow human
activity.
  As I stepped inside, I took notice of the endo- and exothermometers. The
exothermometer showed minus 25 degrees Celsius, which was no surprise to me.
The endothermometer, yet, showed exactly the same value. That was what
surprised me. For for the two thermometers to show the same value, the door
must have been left open for a long time. So I must have been away for quite a
while. And I had been thinking I'd just been quickly strolling on the seaside.
But alas, such was not the case.
  To take some drastic action in such dramatic conditions, I promptly killed
myself. However, as I was lying dead on the floor, I began to think that that
was a little bit too hasty. So, after brief discussing with the little angel
and devil figures that mysteriously appear whenever I am thinking, I decided to
reanimate myself. And so was it. Feeling wiser, if a little dumbfounded, I shut
the door.
  Standing next to the now-shut door was an elf. The elf had come from a
parallel universe, which was in need of saving. So I saved it.
