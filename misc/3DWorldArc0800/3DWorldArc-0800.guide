Subject: memory and H2
From: DJNick <djnick@ptt.yu>
Date: Tue, 01 Aug 2000 22:20:26 +0100

Hello ppl,

I have a question about GFX card memory. As you know, I have BVision and 060
ppc with 160MB now and CGX4.1.

My Workbench [Os3.5 with ROMs and DOpusMagellan2 installed] is opened at 24bit
1024x768 with large background and when start Heretic2 game [it opens new 16bit
screen] and everything looks & works great.

But. When another [I guess 8bit] screen is opened for playing intro
Animations, I'll ALWAYS get vertical lines over the 8bit screen [!] and it
looks very bad.

This 'effect' will dissapear if I open Workbench in 8bit. Looks like: GFX card
have less memory left, or it is corrupted OR it needs additional coolling.

Do you have any idea how to avoid this? Even with this configuration right
now, I'll have to open WB at 8bit, to be able to watch Heretic2 animations
without graphics errors.

Will CGX4.2 update solve this?

Kind regards

Aha. Oki.

Today I downloaded H2patch, installed it and read FAQ on your site :))) After
installing this patch, CD music in game works now from start :)))

Also today I upgraded to 128MB ram and now I have 160MB :)))))))))

When start H2, I have ~112 MB mem left in Workbench :))))

Oki. Done! AND VIDEO WORKS NOW!!! :))) WOW! I think this is the BEST animation
I saw on Amiga game :)))) [haven't seen WOut intro anim yet]. I love
professional created games! :))

Next question: what exactly AHI output to select? Music unit, Unit 0 or
Unit 1? When start AHI there is by default: music unit selected. It is always to Prelude:HiFi 16bit Stereo++. When set all 3 prefs to Paula8. 22khz and stereo mode, video works
perfectly smooth!!! :)) And full screen!!!

Also, I here have Unit 3 always prepared for Paula: Fast 8 bit stereo ahi
output. Is there any way I can from H2 start icon select AHI output for
intro animations that will Heretic2 use? So every time I start the game, sound
of intro anims will be played via Unit3?

How much buffers? I tried 500 but video starts jerking then :} Should I add
buffers in UserStartUp to CD0: to be always 150 buffers on every boot? I now
have plenty of memory to share :-)

Aha... Hmm. Sounds a little bit complicate :) I'll better leave as it is. I
have 12speed CDRom but no SCSI and without PowerFlyer [it doesn't work with
Prelude1200]...

I have a question about imperfect frame updating during intro animation is
playing: Sometimes video looks like MJPG compression is too big so from time
to time appears a lots of 'blocks' over the screen. Is it because my CDRom is
slow or I need to upgrade to CGX4.2? Will it improve video playing quality?
[sorry for too much questions from me]

Excellent work Hyperion! And your intro anim is also very good :) Excellent
sound in animation. Who did it? And in what program? I also noticed that, when
Hyperion logo appears at the end of anim [from 'Horizontal Blur' effect],
animation starts jerking even when 8bit ahi output is selected.

p.s. Keep up with great work people :)))))))

p.p.s. Did anyone found a code for AlienVsPredator :))) I hope there will be
some Ami-ports soon :) This game is something the best I ever played on PC :))))

Hello ppl. Hi great Hyperion :))

I bought Heretic2 CD [a guy bought for me from Germany] and it arrived to=
day
:))
I was very very happy :)) to have latest original game :)))) and I suppor=
ted
you, the programmers :)))

- After succesfull installation, I started the game. From the beginning I
realized that OpenGL is not looking exactly like REAL OpenGL [as seen in
demo]
so I played around with GL_parameters and found that greatlooking OpenGL =
gfx
can be get only with command GL_Texturemode GL_linear [I think].

The question:

Why GL_texturemode is not set to 'linear' by default? Is it slowing down =
a
game?


Because not everybody has a Permedia 2 board. By default it's safier to
think to people with 2D gfx board first, then let the option for people w=
ith
3D boards.

- Also: why this GL_command isn't documented in H2 little book? I acciden=
tly
remembered it from GLQuake :) After that, ingame graphics started to look
stunning.




For your other questions, please refer to the tweaking guide in the updat=
e
file or on our web site.

Especially with the video replay problems, you will find hints to fix the
problem.

All my ram is 60ns, so I won't have that problem, but mixing edo and fpm maybe.
I suppose it depends on how the PPC cards interface addresses the ram and deals
with different memory types.

Obviously using different speeds would effect it.  Did you try setting you 'bios'
prefs to
70ns instead ?

Cool !

Yes :)) Believe me, I'm happy too ;)

I had problems when earlier this year tried 32MB (60ns) with 16MB (70ns).
Amiga keeps crashing after few mouse movements.

I was lucky to found 60ns 128MB and my old 32MB is also 60ns :) So they work
great together.

The GL renderer will automatically close the workbench if no other windows

Very interesting !, you have the Blizzard PPC card and you gave 160MB (32+128MB) stuffed
in it.  I was trying to find out the max RAM this card would take.  I think it might be 2x128MB.
I thought it was 2x64MB.

This is great news becuase I was dubious about getting more RAM.


Cheers

Andy Barker

p.s. I currently have 2x32MB (FPM, 60ns), can you use FPM/EDO (60ns each) or
will it cause problems using mixed memory types ?

150 should be enough. Sometimes  the defaults of some file systems are
too low, like 20 or 25 buffers, this can get you into trouble...

Well, the  frames are delta-compressed  (IIRC with key  frames), which
means  that only  the  difference between  two  consecutive frames  is
stored in the file. If it misses one frame because it could not decode
it in time, this delta (call it a "patch") is not applied to the frame
onscreen, so up  to the next keyframe (or major  redraw) the screen is
mangled. It does this to keep the audio in sync...

The  music was  done  by  Patrick Ceuppens,  our  webmaster, who  also
storyboarded  the  animation.  The  animation  itself was  done  by  a
professional animator.

I think the code was taken down from their page because they wanted to
add some stuff  (dunno, really). I'm afraid we'll be too  busy to do a
port, though... 

Yes, the game is pretty good, although I always get dizzy when playing
as an Alien - this fisheye effect is really cheezy :)

As  an  aside, you  can  set  the variable  "fov"  in  Heretic II  to
something higher than the default 75.0 to achieve a similar effect.

(Not that anyone would want to play with that :)

Best regards, Hans-Joerg.

Hmm... Yes. It works, but I'm using Magellan2 instead WB [and have OS3.5 with
roms installed], and game can't close Magellan2 screen too [I use cloned
workbench screen]...

Never mind... :] Animations aren't that important but looks nice. I hope in
next game port there will be AHI selection for intro anims and it will be
possible to close Magellan2 too ;-)

I had problems with the wipeout. I had 1200x1024 WB and there was too little
memory to the game so it was a slideshow at 320x200 but when I made 800x600
wb and remowed all the pictures from the backround then wipeout was flying
in 640x480. It took some days for me to find the 'problem'.

It doesn't make any more memory :), but it doesn't make it worse!!!

Mine have 150 now but it can't help much as my CD Player is 12-speed and
without PowerFlyer it acts like 4-speed one... Also PowerFlyer [I had it]
does not work with Prelude1200 so - it is closed circle. I'm forced to use
basic & slow IDE port.

I see. Here it plays very badly, and only because I have 12-speed CD [and

Hehe ;)

Anyway, noone confirmed me that you have problems as me [vertical lines] in
Herertic2 intro animations if start it from 24bit 1024x768 opened
DOpusMagellan, like there is no memory for 8 bit screenmode [used for
animation display]. I heard Ed [World Foundry, right?] had bitmap corruptions,
but he didn't reply so I guess I'm the only having these problems?

I'll try later to add another cooler and see if something changes...

Subject: 32xCD and H2
From: DJNick <djnick@ptt.yu>
Date: Sat, 12 Aug 2000 22:02:59 +0100

Hello ppl.

I'm back, with another brain damage question :(

I upgraded to 32xspeed CDRom Samsung [as u can see from my signature ;)) and
it works great. It reads everything [all disks that my previously Sony 12X
couldn't read with ease].

I did this just to see if there will be any speed increasement in intro
playing, but even 32X speed CDRom didn't help. Heretic2 intro never played
well [when start 'new game' from H2 game menu].

Then I brought my H2 copy to Belgrade to test my Heretic2 game, where I have
a friend who have 060 PPC on 240 MHZ A1200 and 64MB of ram, and started
the game, intro played PERFECTLY SMOOTH! How is that possible? Is my 160 mhz
PPC the slowest even for full screen intro playing?

===================

Now I have the strangest problem in my life with CD I upgraded to: 32X
Samsung.

When inserted a CD full of MP3. and try to COPY any file which filesize is larger
than 1 MB, CDRom will start copying but then system will freeze on 101% and I
can't do nothing but to reboot!! During reboot, I'll get another error [like
'CD0 is not in drive' or 'can't find CD0', so I'll have to reboot again.

Btw, copying smaller files to RAM: for example works great.

I reinstalled again IdeFix and everything regarding CD, setUP again Atapi
device, but now everything works great: [CD music [sample] grabbing, copying
music tracks [from AsimCDFS I use as CD1:] from CD to HD, encoding directly
from CDRom, CD music playing.... etc etc etc.

But ONLY system crashes if I'll try to copy ANY file larger than 1 or 1.5 MB in
size. What it might be??? I have PFS3.0 and 600 buffers [which is maximum] on
all 4 HD partitions...

Geez! Am I damned [?] or every hardware I bought I had to survive
installing and hunt all bugs! :(

Any help, please?

Kind regards

Hello,

I'm wondering, is it possible to play GLQuake with addons, like ATF [After The
Fall]?

For 'normal' QuakePPC [ATF add-on], I use

quake -heapsize 16000 -game atf

But for GLQuake I use

stack 500000
GLQuakeWOS -width 512 -bpp 16 -mem 6 -maxsize 128 >nil:

I tried:

GLQuakeWOS -width 512 -bpp 16 -mem 6 -maxsize 128 -game atf >nil:

but then I get ppc error-window.

Can I use somehow GLQuake to start ATF game?? :) And what will be the
command? ATF is excellent game, and it would be great if it can be pushed into
OpenGL :)

I dont know this special mod, but in general if you downloaded a pc-mod
quake game, make sure after installation to delete the /gl subdirectory
of that game, as it does not seem to be fully compatible. GLquake will
create its own. Most mods did run after that, but showed the same errors
you told, before. Good luck and tell me (privately?) if it works!

I use 16-32 MB for the Zerstoerer mod. QuakeRally also works great with
GLQuake. I only have problems with some special fx (like rain) in some

you can add the command line option

+set in_initjoy 0

to the "add these options" field in the starter to disable joystick 
support.

There is a good chance that the TC will require more heap mem than that.

I've succesfully run Airquake, Team Fortress and a couple of my own additions
with GLQuake

If ATF is so great, why punish it with the Permedia 2 then ? :)

Thanks to help messages I got, I forced -atf Quake addon to play via OpenGL
:))) Looks great! But, you were right... It is slow :( But now very slow. It
goes fast from time to time, but overall it is [imho] ~20% slower than nowmal
GLQuake.

This is the command I use and -ATF works:

GLQuakeWOS -width 512 -bpp 16 -mem 32 -maxsize 128 -game atf >nil:

If you know some GL tips, would be nice to hear about them :)

p.s. In demo mode, when the game shows its preview, there is 5 players running
and fighting all for one :) But in GL mode, the rest 4 players are not shown
'properly'. They look like... hmm... a baloon? :]  Anyway, when the game
starts, enemies looks normal.

Do you have the game installed on a non-FFS partition? Something like=20
PSF3 or SFS? If yes, you should try moving it to a different location,=20
especially if it is a big partition...

Hello,

    I bought Heretic2 and it is a great game with great atmosphere :-D

    but I have a few problems :=B0(

I have 80 MB, a PPC030/SCSI/240 MHz with a 68060 + BVision.
Before heretic 2 is run, there is about 75 MB of memory left and no =
patch.
It doesn't change anything whether the memory is set to 60 or 70 ns.
I reinstalled the game : the same.
I installed the patch: the same.

If there is no solution, perhaps someone has a save game just after the =

"Quick" in this case refers to the fact that you don't have to go 
through a lot of menus to reach the save function. It basically does 
the same thing as saving "for real".

The loading also takes a lot of time because it has to load quite a lot 
of stuff, and the context switching kicks in. The engine loads stuff on 
demand basis, meaning there might be a lot of them. IDE disks don't do 
any good either I'm afraid.

IDE I presume? The problem is the IDE bus' hunger for CPU-Time. Unless 
you have a DMA controller, or SCSI, then the IDE will eat away approx. 
70% of the 68k CPU, which will have problems mixing the sound.

Are these letter pixel-swapped, i.e. two adjacent pixels are swapped? 
This might happen some times and is due to some internal workings of 
the graphics chip resp. CyberGraphX. I've noticed this from time to 
time in Decent... 

Does this go away at the next screen update?

No it's a FFS partition, with a mask of 0xffffffe.

The information tool gave me these informations:
device:  blizzppc.device
handler: fs 45.1 (dos3)
size: 431 901 585 bytes in 6330 files, 642 drawers.
blocksize: 512 bytes

it's a 1GB disk and i use OS3.5
and i use 250 buffers.

Finally the gl_texturecache is set to 8388608 (from the installation tool).
I have the panic message whatever value is set for the gl_texturemode
(gl_linear is my default mode).

Subject: Heretic2 q.
From: DJNick <djnick@ptt.yu>
Date: Wed, 23 Aug 2000 22:06:29 +0100

Hi

When I die, relaoding position takes over 2 minutes! What to do? Even
'quicksave' takes sooo much time... What to do? Do I need some 'cache' program
or something? The same question goes for 'GLQuake'. Reloading quicksave takes
also lots of time...

Any ideas??

Another q.:

I upgraded to 32X CDRom. Intro video still plays 'jerky' on my 060 ppc 160mhz.
Do I need faster PPC just to play normally intro video? I tried this video on
my friend's PPC but on 240mhz, it plays very smoothly, without gfx 'rubbish'
appearing over the screen.

And final question:

When I switch screen with Amiga + M from Heretic2 to Workbench [Magellan,
where now I'm typing this email], and then switch back to game screen, only
letters ['loading game' etc etc] appears corrupted. I snapshotted this screen,
so you can see it if you want].

Any help?

Kind regards

MiniGL is a stripped down OpenGL implementation. It has nothing to do 
with Permedia2 (in fact it also works nicely on ViRGE cards), it uses 
Warp3D and will therefore also use a Voodoo board.

What are 3dfx functions? It will use whatever there is on the Warp3D 
side. Of course this does not include multitexturing since Warp3D does 
not offer this at the moment because of lack of opportunity, but we 
plan on fixing this. However, 3dfx cards are not really a good model 
implementation because there are significant differences. We'll have to 
see.

Unfortunately the Mediator is the first of its kind, so the answer is 
no (for the Amiga). But we're also working on Mac, Linux and Windows...

With regard to all these nice new games from Hyperion, I have a question.

If we get a Mediator PCI and lob a Voodoo 3dfx card in, will the MiniGL
driver
work with it in any way, or was the MiniGL driver a stipped version
especially
for
permedia 2 cards ?

Obviously it won't use the 3dfx functions, but open gl should work,
shouldn't
it ?

Have you guys had any experiences of a 3dfx or similar card on the Amiga,
via
beta testing of the PCI bridge/cards or anything ?

I'm interested to hear your feedback.



We want to support Mediator PCI and we even think it will be the best
solution for the Amiga classic as the Permedia 2 is very limited in memor=
y
and 3D capacity.

We plan to make Heretic II take full advantage of Voodoo 3 boards. Warp3D
and MiniGL are definitely not only dedicated to the Permedia 2.

Don't forget that we're also writing games for Linux, system on which
there're several 3D boards now.

We will also receive a Mediator PCI bus from Elbox to start intensive bet=
a
testing and drivers writing. Of course, we'll be able to tell more as soo=
n
as we have got one in hands.

When you load a saved game its like loading a level, only that the 
entities are not placed at their origin but rather created from the 
data in the file. Other approached would be possible, but this would 
need a tremendous amout of bookkeeping, and most likely be very prone 
to errors.

No, not very likely. The file system on the Amiga really is not the 
fastest thing out there. Linux' ext2 is much faster, and this reflects 
in the loading times. Add to this the context switches when doing 
system stuff. An L2 cache would also need to be flushed, making things 
even slower... What needs to be done is move to PPC exclusively, and 
have the 68k emulated so we can save the context switches.

A SCSI drive will make all the difference. Even if the overhead for AHI 
would be small, it will still slow down the CPU considerably...

This does not sound like what to expect... Do you have your BVision 
overclocked? Maybe it is getting too hot? If you are towerized, try to 
mount a fan over it.

Ah... Ok :( I remember on older QuakePPC ports, reloading saved positon [if it

I would advise to re-install the game. Just leave the savegames (i.e. 
user directory) when uninstalling, and re-install the game and patch. 
This helped cure the problems of some other guy...

In GLQuake I don't get the water effect from normal Quake. It looks as
if there was no water and I'm flying through the air. But as I move,
polygons disappear or move, I can sometimes see through walls. Same
happens when it's raining (in the Zerstoerer TC). This is really
annoying and I'm playing more QuakeWOS than GLQuake now.

Add this command in GLQuakeShell:

gl_polyblend 1

and you'll get normal water effect.

The question is: can this command line be saved as defaults? Each time I start
GLQuake, I have to type 'gl_polyblend 1' to see water effect...

Shouldn't make any difference... I would suspect that the savegame 
itself is damaged, and the only advice I can think of is starting with 
an earlier saved game, or from the beginning altogether...

The problem seems to be with the timing of the Permedia 2's memory. The catch 
is that even textures are corrupted if they are not uploaded in a tile-based

24 (resp 32 bit) seems to be endian-swapped. That's why it doesn't work.

Wipeout doesn't use lightmapping, but both Quake and Heretic 2 do. The blue 
stuff seems to be defective lightmaps, prolly also introduced by texture 
corruption due to timing problems...

It is normal BVision and it works great... but something strange is happening:
I'm working in 1024x768 / 24bit Magellan WB mode. When start another
program on its own 8-bit 1024x768 screen [for example OctaMED SoundStudio or
AudioEvolution music program], and start moving any window around that mode,
there will be a lots of small white dots spreading around, like I used
'airbrush' and draw over the screen. They will dissapear if I 'refresh' window
[if possible, resize it a little] and everything will look normal, until I
again open new window over existing one... and dots will start appearing
again. [This weird effect can be snapshotted, so if you would like to see it,
I can send you small snapshot of 8bit screen to your private email].

But, more interesting, I found a solution: In BVisionPPC driver, when I put
tooltype:

BITMAPCACHE=NO

and reboot, there will be no more white dots in 8bit screen!

But this way, none Warp3D program will work [be displayed]... :(

On the other side, another 'interesting' thing:

Like I said, my system is opened at 24bit 1024x768. When I open another
program [for example ArtEffect4 on its own screen, also 24bit 1024x768] and
then start any other program in 8bit [!] it will have annoying vertical lines
[!!!] These lines also appears when try to watch video in Heretic2 [only if I
start game from 24bit Workbench: It will open Heretic2 map [in 16bit screen]
and then another screen [8bit] for playing .smk video.

Ok. I decided to show you snapshotted pictures. Pleas, click this link [34kb]:

http://www.djnick.com/FW97.iff

or .JPG version [108kb]

http://www.djnick.com/FW97.jpg

and you'll see snapshotted FinalWriter97 which is opened as third program, but
in 8bit screenmode... Take a look at vertical lines.

Then try this link:

http://www.djnick.com/Heretic2.jpg

and you'll see corrupted txt in H2 game when I jump to WorkBench [with Amiga+M]
and then go back to Heretic2 screen. It happens only sometimes.

And final picture:

http://www.djnick.com/GLQuake.jpg

There you'll see GLQuake and weird [but nice, moving] blue-effect when go
into darker corners. This 'blue' thing appears in Heretic2 too, but I didn't notice
it in WipeOut demo... Strange that all those errors can be snapshotted! :)

I have opened BigTower and I'm coolling whole day with big ventilator BVision.

Do you have any ideas? These problems are not big so I couldn't live with

AFAIK there is an autoexec.cfg in the id1 directory that you can use 
for this kind of options, or it might have the possibility to add a 
user.cfg like HereticII...

I agree that it is a less than optimal solution. With the software
renderer the biggest problem (I should think) is the slow bus speed
between the PPC and the BVision. IIRC it's only 20mb/sec, and even a
cheap PCI 2mb video card should get several times that amount available.
I'm not sure about RAM performance either, but that might not be as good
as the PC either.

With the Permidia2 drawing the screen, overdraw can slow it down a fair
bit too. Quake is well known for it's massive overdraw (rendering a
polygon and then drawing over all or part of it with another one,
wasting the effort of drawing it in the first place). The slow bus again
slows things down. On my brothers Cyrix 333 (note that these CPUs are
shite, FPU performance is about the same as a P166 apparently) with a
PCI 32mb RivaTNT 2 GL Quake runs very nicely in 800x600 at around 25-30
fps. Here the limit is obviously the Cyrix and perhaps to some extent
the PCI bus, my friend with the same card but using AGPx4 on a PIII
800mhz gets over 100fps easily on many games. He even gets more out of
Quake III than I do from Quake I!

Perhaps the Mediator will allow greater bus speeds. Personally I'd like
to see PCI/AGP on a PPC only card, or Amiga OS running nativly (even
under 68k emulation) on an IMac which of cource has PCI/AGP available.
MorphOS may provide this but of cource, as it stupidly uses PowerUP, it
won't run Warp3D.

Well, not very true. QuakePPC runs very very smooth in 320x200, but 'jerks' a
little in 640x480 [in GLMode], but all in all is much better resolution and gfx...

We need a better 3D card....

I did it, too. But after exiting the game the config.cfg is rewritten

The gl_polyblend "1" works, but now I get those blue triangles someone
talked about :(

I hate that motherf***ing BVision card and the whole AmigaPPC solution.
When I play Quake (Software Renderer) on a PC with P2/160MHz and a 2MB

What??? How??? Are you SURE it IS commercial version, CandyFactory 'PRO'? Old
CandyPPC works under the emu, but have less options and isn't very stable... I
contacted WOS-emu programmer, and he said he knows about that and can't do
nothing with it. Just new, 'reprogrammed' version of CandyF. is needed to make
emulation work well...

Hi DJNick.

I know. When I first heard about it I was excited, but then I found out
it only used PowerUP and was gutted. MorphOS could have been a new
beginning for AmigaOS, but instead is just an interesting project
without much decent software. I wish they could co-operate with H&P to
make it use WarpUP and maybe even become OS4, but somehow I don't think
it will happen :(

You can set up a dual system if you are clever, then when you boot it
defaults to WarpUP and uses PowerUP if you hold own a mouse button or
something. Perhaps newer versions of WarpUP will support CFP?

That is very interesting. Do you know how this compares with the Voodoo?
Maybe one day I'll be able to test it, but it doesn't seem likely at the

That sounds impressive. A 3D engine that can scale to the hardware and
still look good is an impressive thing indeed.

I really don't know why they bothered with PowerUP. No sensible person
would support it now. Phase 5 is dead anyway, I don't think it will get
much development. Also, Amiga Inc have chosen WarpUp to be part of OS3.5
and any decent software is now written for it I think. It really doesn't
make sense.

When you say it might be possible to port it, what exactly do you mean?
It would be possible to port Warp3D to the Mac running AmigaOS or
possible to port it to MorphOS? With the Mac solution I wouldn't go for
anything other than running AmigaOS only without MacOS at all (no
Shapeshifter like solutions please). It must be possible, in fact IIRC
some Linux/FreeBSD ports work that way.

I had 'timing problems' with Prelude1200 soundcard and my old motherboards
[1.D.4 and 2.B from Commodore] - soundcard won't work at all. But when I
exchanged motherboard[s], and rehoused again [last year] revision 1.D.4 from
Escom (!) - Prelude1200 starts working great!

So - can this 'timing errors' be fixed somehow? Errors aren't VERY bad, but in
OctaMED Sound Studio [which is opened at 8bit screen, 1024x768] spreading
pixels all over the music tracks looks annoying simetimes... [I use OSS very
often]...

hi,

> I haven't tried MorphOs, but it really uses PowerPC?? Not WarpOS?? :((

it uses neither of these...PowerUP and WarpUP are AmigaOS APIs for PPC usage.
MorphOS uses its own API that is based on the same roots as PowerUP

WarpUP stuff could work under MorphOS with the correct work done...but thats
work that people dont have time to do...and shouldnt have to do ;-)

I haven't tried MorphOs, but it really uses PowerPC?? Not WarpOS?? :((

Geez, it will mean - another dividing in PPC vs WarpOS stuff.

I'm still on PowerPC only because I use near every day CandyFactoryPRO ppc
which can't be emulated under the WOS :( and I hate that 'terminate'
requester...

it seems best solution will be AmigaOne hardware and Hyperion converting
their
ports to Ami/Elate ?

Btw..will current Heretic2-WarpUP owners be able to upgrade Ami/Elate

You should also consider that the 603e used in the Blizzard boards isn't very 
fast in itself. It has only one integer unit, and one floating point, and is 
generally much slower than the 604e. Plus, it's sitting on a 32 bit bus, 
which also doesn't help to speed it all up.

The Permedia2's fill rate is ridiculously low for a second-generation 
chip. The problem is even more severe when alpha blending is enabled - 
it goes down by over 50%. Sadly, almost every other polygon in 
Quake-Engines is drawn using Alpha blending - you need that for the 
lightmapping, and every polygon in Quake is lightmapped (Shogo resp. 
LithTech can have gouraud-shaded polies inbetween, and *can* disable 
lightmapping completely and still look good). Plus, starting from 
Quake2 water is transparent, so you may have large areas with big 
alpha-blended polygons...

It might be possible to port it over if certain things are provided by 
the OS... Speaking for myself, I don't have any intentions to do this, 
though...

There are 3rd party PCI G3/G4 cards. I agree that everything that will 
be connected to the slow bus will slow down, however, I also think that 
the Voodoo 3 will provide more power for games. The video memory is 
considerably larger than anything else (twice that of the 
C/BVisionPPC), and the setup stage will reduce the traffic 
significantly. We'll see when the driver is done :-)

LithTech has the big "problem" that is hides a lot of aspects of the 
underlying OS to make games really portable. This means that we have to 
port a considerable amount of stuff like the sound system, threads, 
network and GUI code, and all of them in a very general way. The 
advantage is that after this work is done, the game itself ports quite 
easily...

I'm not too expectant about the Mediator to be honest. It will be faster
that what we have now, and cards with 32mb RAM are very nice, but it
will still but much, much slower than PCI on IBM PCs. An 060 can't
really push a Voodoo 3 class card at all, and even a PPC won't be able
to because it still has to use the slow A1200 CPU bus. The only solution
really is to put PCI on the processor card, which IIRC was the plan with
the Cyberstorm G4 and AmiJOE, both of which seem unlikely to ever appear
now :(

It's interesting to see how well it works in systems that are quite
different from the IBM PC systems that it was developed on. For a start,
no IBM PC suffers from the slow bus speeds that the Amiga has. The OS
works quite differently too.

It is hard for people to admit that they are wrong when it comes to
major creations like PUP. Still, even if it is the better system, Ralph
surely has to admit that it is now not the system of choice by Amiga
Inc, Hyperion, Warp3D, the community in general and so no matter how
much better it is he should really just let things rest. Since he is not
being paid for it anymore, I don't know why he doesn't just let it die.

It would be an exellent OS. All the benefits of being AmigaOS as well as
a fast PPC processor, cheap hardware and the availability of laptop
machines too. I could live with a Mac keyboard I think, or someone could
make an adaptor :)

I don't have any data on this yet, I will be able to run my test 
program on the Voodoo 3 once the driver is finished. Concerning the 
Voodoo addon from Village Tronic, it does not seem very likely at the 
moment, and I hope that the Mediator will be available in a 4000

Yes, actually LithTech has a lot to offer, like model LOD which is IIRC 
not in the Quake2 engine. LithTech also has the ability to switch off 
lightmapping, and if you are not able to compare the lightmapped 
version with the gouraud shaded view, it will be hard to spot the 
difference. Of course, gouraud shading always has the disadvantage of 
not catching highlights and shadows if they don't touch the vertices, 
and its not invariant towards the view angle, so you might see a bit of 
jumping, but overall this will definately make a difference on the 
Permedia2 speedwise...

I think that it would be hard for Ralph to admit that, and he is 
obviously convinced that PowerUP is the better solution (as much as I 
am convinced that Warp3D is better than RAVE :-)

Both of the actually. If we had an AmigaOS-like operating system on the 
Mac, the basic framework would be implemented. Architectually, 
everything a programmer sees from Warp3D is the main API, and that's 
fairly general, like Glide but not so much geared towards the same 
accelerator.

I have the first series motherboard from Escom (that came with the bad

But I'm afraid I bought the BVision too soon, because I often hear that
the new version would be more stable (cooler???).

Is it true that there's a special Permedia2 fan available? Where can I
get it? Fans are really expensive, aren't they?

No, it's the old version. Sorry. But it's very stable IMHO. I never got

PowerUp. Don't know why. But PowerUp is dead anyway.
