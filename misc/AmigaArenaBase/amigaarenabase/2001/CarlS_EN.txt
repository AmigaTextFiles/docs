Amiga Arena Interview
---------------------

with Carl Svensson the developer from mp3Play

*Please Introduce yourself for the Readers!

My name is Carl Svensson. I was born in 1980. I'm a liberal socialst
and I mostly listen to Pixies, VNV Nation and The Breeders for the
moment. I like coffee, beer and the Swedish chewing tobacco variant
called "snuff".

*Since did you start to work with the Amiga?

I started playing games on a friends A500 around 1987. In January
1991 I got my own A500 Plus.

*What Amiga Modell do you own?

I have one towered A1200, 060/50MHz with a CV64/3D and
some other goodies, and a standard A1200 with a 040/40Mhz.

*What Version of the OS is running on your Computer?

AmigaOS 3.1

*Which Software Develope you?

I mostly concentrate on mp3Play right now, but I also
code miscellaneous other utilities in ARexx. I write a lot
of web stuff, too, mostly in PHP, ASP and My/MSSQL.

*Can you tell us what your software is about?

It's a minimalistic GUI for MPEGA.

*What created the idea in you to continue developing your software?

I love the Amiga and wanted to contribute something to the
community. Of course, I like the fame, too :-)

*How long took the development up to now?

Err, not long. I'm not sure but it's a fairly simple script.

*What software are you using?

I use the DevPac text editor when developing. It's fast, small
and simple.

*For what system are you developing?

AmigaOS.

*Would you support the "Amiga One"?

I don't think my software would have that big an impact
on the new Amiga market since a G3 will eat all MP3s for
breakfast.

*What can we expect from future versions?

Hopefully and ID3 tag viewer. Any suggestions from users
are welcome, too.

*Don't you lose the fun and interest in developing when
you see the small amount of feedback and money you get
from the small Amiga market?

I think I get a fair amount of feedback for my development
actually. The ability to do this interview, for example.

*Get you enough Feedback for you Software?

See the previous answer.

*When did you use your Amiga for the last time?

Huh? I used it today, but I sure hope that wasn't the last time
I'll ever use it :-)

* What software have you bought for your Amiga last time?

My last shopping spree included ImageFX 4 and NetConnet 3.

* What software do you use till today?

DOpus 4, ImageFX, DevPac, Voyager, AmIRC, AmiTCP/Genesis,
MPEGA, KingCON, MCP and a bunch of other utilities and programs.

* What soft/-hardware are you planning to buy?

More memory and a bigger hard drive. Maybe an AmigaOne
if AmigaOS 4 becomes cool enough.

* Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?

Not as we know it now. The A1 will probably have a different feel
to it than the current custom hardware with a tightly integrated 
OS in ROM.

*Thank you for your Answer!

Thanks for asking the questions! :)
