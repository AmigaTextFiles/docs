 *Please introduce yourself to the readers!*
 My name is Grzegorz Tanski. I study Computer Engeneering on Warsaw
 University of Technology.

 *When did you start working with the Amiga?*
 I started working with Amiga in 1992. My first Amiga was A500.

 *Which Amiga model do you own*
 Now, I have A1200 with 68030 50 Mhz no PPC even no FPU only 420MB HDD 16MB
 RAM. I'm thinking about an big upgrade as soon as Amiga situation will be
 clear.

 *Which version of the operating system is running on your computer?*
 I'm running AmigaOS 3.0.

 *Which software are you developing?*
 Now I'm developing Kray.

 *Can you tell us what your software is about?*
 Kray is a freeware raytracer with a text interface. You have to create scene
 in a textfile using Kray's own scene describing language. Now Kray can
 render only static pictures (no animations). Since version 0.91 Kray can
 generate pictures using energetic method (not only raytracing).

 *What has created the idea in you to continue developing your software?*
 I was always interested in programming and computer graphics. Before Kray
 all my graphics programs was runing real-time (3d engines,some demo-like
 effects), often written in assembler. When you are writing a time critical
 program such these you have to make a compromise between speed and quality.
 I always wanted to make a program without compromises. A program that
 generates maximus quality. I started to write Kray. It was very exciting
 for me to look at early pictures made with Kray so I developed it.

 *How long has the development taken so far?*
 I have no idea when Kray will look like I want him to look like. It goes
 like this: I have an idea of something add to Kray, I find the time (it's
 sometimes hard) and it's done. The speed of development depends mainly on
 how much spare time I have and how many ideas.

 *Which software are you using for developing?*
 StormC 4 is the compiler I use. Kray is object-oriented. It's written in C++.

 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*
 Only debug version of Kray uses some system routines such opening a window
 or screen. Pure Kray is system independent. It means that it can be
 recompiled on any platform without modifications. There are only versions
 for AmigaOS (and Windoze :-( ) but porting in this case is very easy. I like
 the idea of AmigaDE. I think it's the best way Amiga can go.

 *Which OS will you support in the future?*
 It depends of course on situation. As I said I like AmigeDE. I think Amiga
 OS needs something new and fresh without loosing big Amiga advantages (fast
 light-weight multitasking, reasonable resources consumtion,
 and many many very good things in AmigaOS that are missing in other OS'es)
 I hope there will be such OS. If so I will of course support it.

 *What can we expect of future versions?*
 It's a big "?". I don't know what will come to my mind. If you have any
 ideas write to me.

 *Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the small amount
 of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?*
 I don't do it for many or fame. I do it for pleasure of programming,
 creating something new, checking my own posibilities. I also learn a lot doing
 this. When I decide to do something comercial I will worry about the size of
 market. Of course an e-mail form someone in the world with opinion about my
 work is something very nice and motivating.

 *Do you receive enough feedback for your software?*
 Yes. Even zero feedback is enough for me now becouse doing this is a
 pleasure for me, but feedback of any kind is a very glad to see.

 *When did you last use your Amiga?*
 Today.

 *Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?*
 StormC 4.

 *Which software do you still use?*
 I mailnly use StormC. Rest are programs utilities useful for development. I
 use FileMaster, Personal Paint, CED and many small utilities I don't
 remember now.

 *Which hard/software are you planning to buy?*
 Whole new computer on which I will be able to run new AmigaOS.

 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*
 I belive it will be alive as a coputer for specific people. I hope Amiga
 will survive becouse I don't want to change platform.

 *Your final words for the readers?*
 Greetings to all Amiga Arena readers. Sorry for my poor english.
