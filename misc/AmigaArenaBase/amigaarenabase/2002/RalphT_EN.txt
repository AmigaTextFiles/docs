 *Please introduce yourself to the readers!*
  My name is Ralph (Raffaele) Torchia, I am 30 years old, recently married,
  and by profession I am a dentist in Canada.

 *When did you start working with the Amiga?*
  I bought my first Amiga 1000 in 1987, and I must have been one of the
  first people in the city who purchased one.

 *Which Amiga model do you own*
  I currently own an Amiga 2000 with a 030/882/MMU G-Force board, PicassoII,
  ioExtender, A2320 display enhancer, etc.  I also use WinUAE on my Pentium
  III system.

 *Which version of the operating system is running on your computer?*
  My A2000 runs OS 3.9 and WinUAE has OS 3.5 installed.

 *Which software are you developing?*
  I am currently developing Spitfire, a Palm desktop for the AmigaOS.

 *Can you tell us what your software is about?*
  Spitfire is my second generation application that allows Amiga users who
  have PalmOS devices to HotSync their PDAs with the Amiga.

 *What has created the idea in you to continue developing your software?*
  When I first bought my PalmPilot in 1997 there was only software for
  Windows and MacOS.  I had neither of these computers back then.  After
  realizing that no one was developing any Amiga software to connect to the
  Palm, I set out to develop my own.

 *How long has the development taken so far?*
  I began developing Spitfire in 1998, then in 1999 I switched to developing
  Spitfire, which was the second generation of the software.Spitfire had
  many more features, and was designed to be easier to expand from a developer
  and user standpoint.

 *Which software are you using for developing?*
  Spitfire is written in AmigaE, and I use WinUAE with GoldED as my
  development system.  Testing is carried out on my A2000.

 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*
  Currently only for AmigaOS.

 *Which OS will you support in the future?*
  Probably only for AmigaOS.  This, of course, is not set in stone, and
  anything could happen.

 *What can we expect of future versions?*
  Most likely bug fixes and expansion of the desktop elements, such as more
  import/export options, which has been the biggest feature request by
  registered users.

 *Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the
  small amount of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?*
  You do tend to lose some interest, but that is not the main point of
  programming on the Amiga; that is to get feedback.  Anyone who develops for
  the Amiga knows that you are never going to make enough money to cover any
  costs or get rich (or even enough to buy groceries!).  You do it because you
  enjoy it in some manner.

 *Do you receive enough feedback for your software?*
  I do receive some feedback, and it is great when you do, but not nearly
  enough.  It makes you feel good that there are individuals who appreciate
  your work and are also willing to help out in some manner to improve it.

 *When did you last use your Amiga?*
  Last I used my A2000 was December, 2001.I tend to use WinUAE more often
  as it resides on my PIII, which is the workhorse computer in my home.

 *Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?*
  AmigaOS 3.9

 *Which Amiga software do you still use?*
  I mostly use development tools for my software.  Other than that I will
  use PersonalPaint for editing some graphics, Spitfire to HotSync and look
  up information that is stored on my PDA, and DOpus 5, which runs on my
  WinUAE system.

 *Which hard/software are you planning to buy?*
  None.I currently have a large library of Amiga and PC software, and my
  wife will go ballistic if I purchased any more hardware for my computers.
  ;-)

 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*
  I think it can still grow in popularity, but it will always be eclipsed by
  the Windows juggernaut.  I can see it growing beyond the current state, but
  only if all of the community comes together as a team, with much better
  direction and guidance from Amiga, Inc.

 *Your final words for the readers?*
  Continue to support Amiga developers in any manner you can.  Also, never
  give up hope on the things that matter in your life.  Miracles do still
  ppen today, you just have to learn where to look.

  Sincerely,
  Ralph Torchia, B.Sc., D.D.S.
