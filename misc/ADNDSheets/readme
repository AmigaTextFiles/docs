This archive contains a character record sheet for TSR's advanced Dungeons &
Dragons role playing game. I made this one because all the other sheets I
found on the Internet so far were in postscript format, so I couldn't do
much with them (except printing them, and even that was a hassle).

ADnDCharacterSheet2.FW is the sheet in FinalWriter format
ADnDCharacterSheet2.PS is the file in postscript (tm) format

These files are public domain. So you can do with them whathever you want. ;-)
