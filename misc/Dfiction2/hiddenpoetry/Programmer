Andy J Campbell: PROGRAMMER

Caught beneath his own plastic hood
Fixing the lights that shine in your eyes
Toying with unseen wires
A tiny name behind commercial success
Trademarks, billboards, leaflets.

Paid and packaged, taken for granted
Supplying the updates you need to survive
Feeding the core of your epic business
A wired web you don't understand
Binary, machine code, hex.

Learning from the inside out
Vice versa to the bog standard user
Aware of social condemnation
For working with the future
Manuals, microchips, mice.
