Andy J Campbell: HEY MANDY

You see that lad over there with the white in his hair
And him at the bar with the cuts down his arms
And Joe - that tall, blushing bloke in the corner
(no, not him, the pale one, standing beside Laura)
Oh and that fat git, leaning against the wall,
Oi, Mandy, you listening? - I've shagged them all.

And you see that gorgeous one, there - he thought I cared
And that teenager with the bike - I ruined his life
Oh and look, it's John!
Christ, I didn't half lead that guy on
He's lost his wife now
(don't know why he cares, like, she was a right fucking cow).

And you see that lad over there with the zits 
He's going out with Sarah (you know, her with the flat tits)
And that guy at the table, sipping wine
I heard he's got a dick like a washing line
Didn't Jenny Smith say he was a bit of an arsehole?
Me? I wouldn't touch him with a fucking barge pole.

Him, there - he's from work
I've had him like, but he's a bit of a jerk
If you want a really good fuck, Mandy, right,
Try Paul over there, he'll pork you all night
And I tell you this
He'll lick your arse till it shines
What do you mean how'd I know? I have had him six times.

Let me see, is there anyone I forgot?
Nah, do you know, I think I've had the lot
And you know, out of ten, I reckon they'd all get a six
Except Paul because when he's had his weetabix
He's not bad
I think I'd give him eight-out-of-ten
In fact Mandy, if you'll excuse me, 
I think I'll pop over and shag him again.
