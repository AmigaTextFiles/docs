Andy J Campbell: THIRD EYE

"So what's your name then?" he said
(thinking I don't give a shit)
"Lisa," she replied
(thinking he's quite fit)
"You look gorgeous in that black dress,"
(I wanna rip it off)
"Oh, thanks, it's new."
(I can't get enough)
"Fancy another drink?"
(if I can fuck your brains out, bitch)
"Sure, okay,"
(hey, I wonder if he's rich?)

And then later that night as they drive through the rain
He pulls up outside her house and kisses her again and
Tries to go a bit further slides his hand across a breast
And it flashes through her mind maybe he's just like the
Rest but she leaves it for now because he looks so nice
And besides she's only ever done it twice.

"Do you want to meet tomorrow?"
(thinking you frigid fucking cow)
"I'd love to," she replies
(thinking I've had enough for now)
"I'll pick you up at seven,"
(and you'd better look hot)
"Sure, okay,"
(wow, I like this guy a lot)
"Okay then, have a nice night,"
(without me you slut)
"Thanks bye,"
(the car door slams shut)

So he drives back home to make sure his kids're in bed
And sneaks in beside his wife, kisses her on the 
Forehead and tries to wake her up because he feels so horny.
She moans and rolls over tells him to wait till morning
For God's sake he curses and lies on his side and dreams
Of ripping black dresses open wide.
