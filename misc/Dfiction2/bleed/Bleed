ajc: BLEED

they hate my guts because i write too much they hate my guts because i
don't write enough they hate my guts because i'm inbetween. why don't 
they put pen to paper and write themselves i wonder
  i wonder
  perhaps it's because of this:

Jo Jo help me Jo God help me Jo please help me come back don't leave 
me here with this it can't be happening-
  I stopped breathing and listened to the house. Silence. Just my 
heart-beat, faster than a child's should ever have to go. Thundering 
through the dark like a breakless express train.
  I was sharing the wardrobe with the monsters and ghosts. They were 
nothing anymore. Nothing compared to...
  ***?
  Nodontthinkthat.
  NEVERTHINKTHAT.
  NEVER.
  Just... shhhh, don't... think that. It wasn't ***, it was drink. Jo 
said what it did and I nodded, promised I'd stay away, but I never 
really took her seriously did I?
  Oh God.
  I shuffled around, tried to get cosy. Couldn't. Too many shoes 
underneath my bare feet.
  What did he do, Carl? What...?
  I'd had a bad dream, couldn't remember it now but it was a bad one 
with Jo screaming and tree men and razorblades and Martians and fuck 
knows what else. I'd woken abruptly, a shriek of terror behind my 
lips, sweat pouring down my back. I'd run into the bathroom, *** had 
been peeing in the toilet and stopped and caught me, prevented me 
from screaming and waking up Chris and Mum...
  "Shhhh-"
  "***! ***! The fire! The fire!"
  "Shhh Carl, it's okay, just a dream, just a dream..."
  "But... Jo..."
  "What?"
  "Jo... I mean, nothing, doesn't matter..."
  "Shhh, now... take it easy..."
  I cried a bit in his arms, ridding myself of the imaginary terrors, 
sniffing at his strange just-been-out-with-Uncle-John's smell... what 
was that stuff? Beer? Yes, it had to be beer. God it was so strong...
and he smelt of smoke too.
  He crouched down. I whispered in his ear: "It was so real ***, so
real, like there were aliens in the room and chopping Chris up and I
thought... I thought..."
  I felt suddenly cold. Moved away. He'd pulled my bottoms down to my 
ankles. Touching my knees.
  "What're you doing?" I murmoured.
  "John'sssss daughter..." He slurred and blinked his eyes slowly, 
like he was in slow-motion or something. "Legsss, like yours..."
  He touched my legs and I made a funny noise, not a cry or a scream 
but a croaky sound like a frog. I saw Jo's step-father stood in the 
hallway of her home, recoiling from the actions of his imaginary 
pistols.
  /Howya doin' cowboy?/
  I laughed unsurely as *** stroked my legs and babbled on about 
Uncle John's girl... something about a dress... little lumps, like 
Mum when she was younger... I couldn't understand what he was on 
about.
  "I don't need to pee." I sniggered and reached down for my pants. 
He caught my hands before I got there.
  "Wait, wait, bet she had like... this-" he grabbed hold of my thing
and pushed it right back underneath me so I was flat at the front. I 
started sobbing and whispering "no" because it reminded me of Joanne, 
how she'd touched me there and shown me what hers was like, asked me  
to touch her there too, and she'd giggled and sat on me and made my 
thing go into hers, so warm it had been, and now I felt sick because
that wasn't anything to do with grown-ups, grown-ups didn't know about
stuff like that not in this way, NOT-
  "I'll-go-back-to-sleep-now," I hissed, shuddering.
  *** stopped doing what he was doing and picked me up in a cuddle. At
first I tried to battle him away... but then he was *** again, not 
Weird ***, but ***, and I said, "Okay," and we headed off for the bed-
room, where Mum lay sleeping on her own.
  I fell asleep pretty quick.
  Dreamt of nothing, as far as I can remember.
  Woke up with *** on me, nearly crushing me-
  "***! ***-NO!" but it was a silent cry, because I couldn't speak 
anymore because he was rubbing himself up and down on me and my 
pyjamas were stretched all over and I could hear him whispering with 
his eyes closed how sexy someone was, and he was grabbing the skin on 
my chest, hard, painfully, and I thought maybe, like, he thought 
perhaps I was Mum, or John's Daughter-
  HOWCOULDHETHINKOFDOINGTHATTO-
  -or maybe he was showing me a secret only adults shared but I didn't
like it I didn't like it, so I fought and I cried out for Mum to wake 
up but she didn't hear me, then I fell out of bed backwards and ran 
into my own bedroom and upto Chris's bunk and I shook him and shook 
him-
  "CHRIS! CHRIS PLEASE WAKE UP!"
  -and I kept on shaking him and eventually he did wake up with his 
eyes closed and his hair all one-sided.
  "What do you want, nobber?" he croaked thickly, and I climbed up 
onto his bed, shivering and crying, and he started pushing me away and
calling me names, so I fell back again, fell on the floor, and started
crying into the carpet for Joanne to come back and for us to run away
like she said.
  I saw the wardrobe.
  Jumped in it, closed it, cuddled up to myself, sweating.
  Sometimes
  I think I'm still there.

"-the planets in order. Turn to page eighty six. What's the first
planet in the solar system... erm... let's see... who hasn't spoken
today... ah yes, Lisa."
  "Huh? What miss?"
  The class tittered.
  "Pay attention young lady. What's the first planet in the solar 
system?"
  "Ummm..." the girl flicked pages hurriedly. "Ummm..."
  "Page eighty six for goodness sake! Yes Dianne?"
  "Mercury, miss."
  "Good, excellent. How many of you think-"
  "Miss!"
  "What is it Michael?"
  "Miss it's Carl Roberts! He's cutting himself with a broken test 
tube miss!" 
  I looked up, grinning, and shouted, "MERCURY VENUS EARTH MARS 
JUPITER SATURN URANUS NEPTUNE PLUTO." then looked down again and 
carried on making my arm bleed.

Nurse Wood ran her finger over my Personal Record File, stopped about
half way down, then picked up the phone on her desk. 
  "Don't." I said and she looked at me, wide-eyed.
  "I'm sorry, lovey? What did you say?"
  "It was just an accident." I murmoured. "I smashed it by accident."
  "Carl," she put the phone down again and turned in her seat. "You 
were cutting your own skin. Drawing on it. Do you want to tell me 
why?"
  "Don't ring my mum up," I told her, picking my nails. "She'll get 
ill and have to go to hospital."
  "Alright, I wont," the nurse decided after a moments thought. She 
stood up, scanned my Personal File again, then put it down and walked 
over to me. She crouched, resting her hands on my knees. I didn't
mind, she was okay. Very pretty, too.
 (probably a monster though, like everyone else).
  "Are you being bullied?" she whispered, blinking slowly. "You can 
tell me Carl, I'll help you, I promise I'll make it stop."
  "No teachers can make it stop," I told her gently, hot, thick tears 
gliding down my face. "They always come back, they always remember, no
matter what teachers do. It's just..."
  "What, Carl?" she was almost on my lap now. "What? Tell me?"
  I avoided her eyes and sighed deeply. "Nothing."
  "You can tell me everything-"
  "I can't, you don't understand, you're a girl and you're grown up 
and you don't have to worry-"
  "I have lots of things to worry about. Believe me."
  "Not things like mine."
  "What are your things Carl?"
  I bit my shuddering lips. "I-I-I can't say."
  "Why not?"
  "Cos it.. hurr... hurrrts." I swallowed flem. "It makes me go sick, 
cos it hurts like I've been stabbed."
  "Jesus," she whispered... and then I was pushing her away and 
telling her I didn't want her to touch me. She said she was sorry 
about a million times and I just nodded and kept my mouth firmly 
closed.
  "I know a girl like you," she told me, sat on the floor. The bell 
rang and we waited about three or four minutes for the noise of the 
changing of classes to subside. "She used to dress all scruffy and not
bother what she looked like. She was pale, like you-"
  I shot my head up, breathing quickly. "What was her name? What was 
her name, what was it, what was-"
  "Sandy," said the nurse and my momentarily-repaired heart shattered 
into pieces again. "Sandy Beckworth."
  "Does she still go to this school?" 
  "Yes, but I think she's left now. She was in the fifth form, but she
might be coming in to say goodbye to the teachers. Do you want me to 
ask her if she'll talk to you?"
  I shook my head briskly: fifth formers were evil, they were all sick
bastards and I hated them. "No, no, doesn't matter."
  "If you do have her problem..." said the nurse. "You must, /must/
tell somebody, Carl. If you don't, nobody will ever know and it'll 
just keep going on and on." she sat up, touched my legs again. *** 
flashed through my mind, but I forced his image away. "Carl, God you 
don't have to put up with it-"
  "You don't know nothing," I protested, sniffing up. "You don't know 
what you're on about, nobody does, nobody knows-"
  "You're wrong," she shook her head. "Love, you're so wrong."
  "I'm /not/ wrong! Just fuck off will you."
  She closed her eyes. "Don't swear at me. I'm only trying to help."
  "Sorry," I whispered quickly. The eventual realisation that I'd just
told a virtual teacher to `fuck off' made my stomach go funny.
  "It's alright, let's forget it."
  "You won't give me a detention will you?"
  "Course not," she smiled. "I'm not authorized anyway."
  "Oh," I looked around the nurse's room curiously. It was small and 
narrow, painted pale green with charts and posters stuck on the wall, 
and filing cabinets, and a settee and a chair, and even a sink. I
couldn't see any medical stuff, though.
  "What do you think of my room then?" breathed the nurse.
  "S'okay."
  "Would you like a drink of coffee or something?"
  "Don't like it."
  "Tea?"
  "Not thirsty."
  "Do you want to have a wash?"
  "No." I shook my head: that was a stupid question.
  "Would you like to lie down for a bit?"
  "I'm not tired."
  "How about I take you home?"
  Now that sounded interesting. "Can you drive?"
  "Yes. I've got a car outside in the carpark. A while Volvo, have you
seen it?"
  "No."
  "Do you want to go home?"
  "I... dunno."
  "We could always pretend to your mum you accidently cut yourself. 
Or we could hide a plaster under your sleeve. I can keep checking it 
for you. What do you say?"
  I nodded. The nurse stood up and slid a bunch of keys off her desk.
  "Miss Wood?"
  "My name's Cathy," she smiled. She had a nice, big smile.
  "I'm- sorry for swearing." I said quietly.
  "Hey, fuck it." she sniggered and gave me a pat on the head.

"Stop."
  "What?"
  "Please stop."
  The nurse stopped the car beside the school minibus, pulled up the 
handbrake and switched off the ignition. There was a brief jangle of 
keys, then another sigh, then a silence.
  "She said don't come looking for me."
  "Who did?"
  "My... friend." I shrugged. Calling Jo my girlfriend seemed wrong 
for some reason. Maybe she had been for a short length of time... the 
time in the woods at nightfall, especially... but it wasn't right, it 
just wasn't /right/.
  "Carl, will you tell me about this friend of yours?"
  "Promise you won't say anything to anybody else, not even your 
bestest friend or your mum or dad or /anybody/?"
  "I promise." she crossed her heart with her fingers. Paul James had 
done that, which meant it was a proper method of promising, and I was 
happy with it.
  And so it all came out in a big mess of hysterical words, yelling 
whispering, tears, giggles, coughing, choking, the rush almost made 
me sick. The sheer relief of telling someone, making someone under-
stand how badly it had all fucked me up, it was so good, so deeply 
renewing.
  "-and Paul went and I went back to Jo and Jo said we should just 
forget about Paul and go on our own but I said I couldn't but she 
never really believed me, not ever, until the end when we split up by 
the river, but anyway, we sat on a park bench and she started like, 
coming closer, looking into my eyes and sayin she'd never seen me 
before and all this fuckin weird shit... and she touched my face and 
said allsorts of mad stuff and then we played a game where I had to 
chase her and when I caught her I had to kiss her cheek or maybe her 
arm or what ever she said until it got dark when... when..." I 
started sobbing. "Nothing happened, nothing, it doesn't matter, but 
she's gone now... she-just she's... like, back home and the trees are 
stoppin me goin, they did last Sunday when I tried goin on my bike... 
and... and that's it."
  "Cry," Nurse Wood whispered, leaning over onto my seat and brushing 
my hair lightly with her fingers. "When it hurts, just cry... you're 
going to be okay, Carl."
  "Can we go to your room now?" I sniffled. "I need a drink."
  "Just-" she closed her eyes briefly. "Tell me if what was happening 
to Joanne was... or is... happening to you."
  I swallowed a lump in my throat. "I'm okay."
  "Carl-"
  "I'm okay, alright!" I unclipped the car door, got out, slammed it. 
I stood against the car and stared up at the cloudy sky.
  "I'm sorry." the nurse apologised, locking up. "But you can talk to 
me if you want to. Any time. I can give you my phone number if you 
want so you can ring me, or my address if you want to write letters. 
Carl? Are you listening?"
  "I'm fine." I whispered to myself firmly. "Fine fine fine."

When He came home the next night, and mum was asleep, I got up and 
went to him, like a slave goes to his master. We stood looking at each
other across the tiny hallway, silent, staring.
  Not ***.
  Wasn't ***.
  "Shhhhe's called Josephine, can you belieeeeeve that?" the Demon
swaggered towards me. "S'got your eyes, girl-"
  "I'm not a girl," I said loudly, clearly. "My name's Carl. That's 
not a girl's name. Are you stupid or what?"
  "Got lumpssss.."
  "I haven't got lumps." a warm tear shot down my cheek like a bullet.
  "Too old, meeee-"
  "Yes. You are."
  "Shhhh," he blinked in slow motion before landing on his knees 
beside me. Three seconds later my bottoms were down, and he was 
putting his fingers on me, pushing my thing back like he'd done the 
other night. 
  "No wait nowaitNOWAIT-"
  Up against the wall, pants off, not just down.
  What happened didn't last long. I don't remember it. I don't want 
to remember it. What I do remember is looking up at the roof and 
making faces out of the patterns in the ceiling, and trying to solve 
the riddle of the talking trees...
  Who is the man.
  Who ran.
  To you.
  Did Jo scream?
  I didn't.
  Was it the same for her.
  Different.
  She has lumps. She has no thing.
  Push me back, push me in.
  To the wall.
  That's all.
  Bed.
  Must go to bed.
