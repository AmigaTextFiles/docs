Hi,


Have you ever had a prob like this .....

When using Voyager (v 3 or 2.9xx) I can download a pic or text ,

but when I try to d/l a file it goes through the motions of opening 
a d/l window then shows the d/l rate ect . but when the d/l is complete 
there is no file there .

The file showes up in the cashe as a VViewtemp.00 or a variation 
of such.

I have tried to alter the mime prefs to ' save to disc'

but it makes no difrence 

:-(



Any idears


Ralph

Bye

Greetings All...

Does anyone know the email/url address of Rodrigo Reyes, the author
of GfxLAB24 ?

I've tried  rodrigo.reyes@ramses.fdn.org  from the manual, but it 
was returned to me as a non-existing address.

Any help would be appreciated.

Some files require you to hold down the shift key when you click on it
to download.  Give that a try and see what happens.

Amazing stuff, unfortunatly it has almost zip to do with what
I'm trying to do. 

I'm trying to create an amigaguide doc from a text file I
get sent regularly by email. The point is to make this
text file easyer to read, since only some of it is of
interest to me. It's kinda like giving hyperlinks to
your morning news paper, except my newspaper is sent
by email. It's a free service called Infobeet.

That's because it's using X-Arc that comes with Netconnect.

For LhA and LZX files set up the following in MIMEPrefs for Lha and LZX...

Make sure "Save and view" and "Use class directory" are checked, nothing else
should be checked. 

Also in Voyager's configuration under "hyperlinks" make sure you have a
directory
selected in the "Download to" box. 

Fingers crossed, you should find that clicking on an LZX or LhA file link will
display the contents of the unpacked archive in X-Arc from which you can
select where you want it saved to.

Holding down the shift key when clicking on an archive will simply copy it to
the place you selected in V's setting. If you want to change where the
archive is saved to, open up the download window first and select the
directory.

If you are going to parse the file(s) and create HTML files from
them, you might try downloading Rebol <http://www.rebol.com>
and use it. It involves some programming, but Rebol is a powerful
and easy to use tool.

Hi
I had this problem at one time.
I have a directory called "Work:Incoming/Downloads" which I use for
all incoming files. I can then deal with them as and when I want.
In the "MIME settings" I have "Directory" pointing to
"Work:Incoming/Downloads".
"Use class directory" is unchecked.
"Save to disk" is checked.

In the "Settings" I have "Ignore server sent MIME types" checked.
I think that is all, It does what I want.
All the best 
Terry

Thanks for the above , but if i didn't want it  to unarc every thing by
default 
( yes I know that you said LMB , /bu/t with kids & the misses using the 
computer .....)

I have had another look at the mime prefs in V , I have ticked save to disc 
and deleted the viewer option (x-arc xxxxx) , however if I tick 'use class
directory' the setting   (class)   appears ( in the DIR coloum    should
that be left or untick 
class diectory and use a directory setting ??????

Looking at your original quote above, what I've sent you should be 
exactly what you need. 

Looking at your answer seems to suggest you want something entirely
different to what you asked for in the first place.

The "GuideLinks.guide" will show you exactly how to set this up.
You will have to put some codes in the text files to make them
work as Amigaguides though.

Did you actually look in the directory after you un-arced it?

There was a complete guide on making Amigaguides, plus the dox
for a program that will generate .guides from text files, plus
other goodies.

I'm still not completely sure from your second (and different) 
explanation above what exactly it is you want to do.

If you want to AUTOMATICALLY generate an Amigaguide from a text
file, I'm 99% sure this is not possible. There has to be some work
by you to make this work, otherwise, how would you expect a guides
node to know where to take you next?

Regards... Tony

   I'm sure one of the CD file systems can read video CD's, I can't remember which one though (I think it's one of the pay ones...)

   Anyway, if you've managed to rip the disk as raw data, this extra data is simply the checksum data, which theoretically could be removed, I'm not sure how though...

See ya :)

Hi All,

Does anyone know of a good sample coverter that
will let me convert .iff samples to .wav with
little sound quality loss? something not too
big or anything. I'm just looking for a simple
no hastle program, not something really fancy.

If you can recommend something and know where
to get it i'd appreciate that.

TIA!

Chris Seward

Sox is your friend.  Look for it on Aminet (might be there under the
name "Amisox", I can't remember).  It's a Unix port, and is CLI-based,
but it really is as simple as typing something like

  sox foo.iff foo.wav

If you need any help with it (there are some hairy command line
options if you want them), just give me a shout.

   With little quality loss? WAV files are just raw audio files like IFF, so there is no quality loss anyway :)  

   Anyway, simply search Aminet, there's probably tones of them about. I have a copy of SoundBox, that does the trick and is on aminet, but I bet there are loads of 'em.


PS. If you ment MP3 (which does give some quality loss because it's compressed) then again there are MP3 encoders on aminet (although if you don't have a PPC then it'll be rather slloowwww ;)

See ya :)

 I'm 100% sure it is possible. Infact I think Niel posted the
very script, and I need to go to Onelist and retrieve it now.

Of course it can be done. Arexx simply needs to scan the
text for the article and return the line number on which this
is found, this number is then added into the link. All that
is stopping me doing it myself is that I don't know how to
make Arexx count lines. I think Niel does.

Heya!

Just thought I'd spread the news! Symphony^A51 (Lucy Bayldon) has had an
interview on local BBC Radio Lincolnshire of her band/duo!!

Go to http://www.a51krew.demon.co.uk for full details and to download
the whole interview in mp3 format!!

(Sorry if this is the wrong place to publish this but it is news of what
an Amiga scener is up to)

C yA!

Subject: [AmigaSupportService] A4000/030 Crash problems!  Help!

--- Forwarded message follows ---


From: "Doug Harvey" <dougharvey@lineone.net>

Hi, I caught your ad in Amiga Format and am hoping you can help save
my sanity!

The problem:  It has become increasingly difficult to boot the machine
(I have reverted back to my trusty A1200 at the moment!).

The symptoms:  There are various scenarios:

1)  A number of times I get a yellow screen just before the system
crashes.

2)  The screen shows flickering sections or lines as if the display is
trying to establish itself before crashing.  These may be
yellow/black, grey/black, or white/black.

3)  The led power light sometimes falters.

4)  Sometimes it manages to boot, but very shortly after beginning to
use an application the whole screen judders a bit then tends to loose
consistency in graphic display leaving odd lines of pixels around
before eventually giving in and crashing.

5)  Sometimes it attempts to boot but sends the hard-drive into a
continuous spin instead.

6)  Even holding down the mouse buttons for the options screen isn't
stable, that crashes sometimes too.

SYSTEM:  A4000/030; CPU 68030; FPU 68882; DMA/Gfx Chip AGA Alice -
2Meg;  Display Chip AGA Lisa; CPU Speed - 25Mhz; 18MB Ram

PERIPHERALS: 540Mb hard-drive (data intregrity checks ok); Two
external disk drives (DF2,DF3); 1 internal disk drive (TD1 - no DF0:
due to Bhudda Controller);  CD-ROM; modem; stereo amplifier; parallel
printer; sound surround adapter.

It took two hours the other night to get a successful boot!  Any help
you can give would be MUCH appreciated!

Thanks for your time.

Doug

Your realtime clocks nicad battery is probably leaking all over 
the main board, disolving circuit tracks & shorting stuff out....

Take the lid off & check that first,   
If it is NOT LEAKING AT ALL,  
then boot on a virgin 3.?  WB Disk if that works,  
then remove all the funky hacks installed.

If neither of those are responsible,  ensure your CPU
module is plugged in ALL THE WAY,  they can pop out
a bit & cause havoc.

If all that is not the problem,  take it to Analogic Computers.

Yellow means software failure- the stuff the Guru software couldn't trap.

Fault in graphical-oriented software?

sounding more and more like a software conflict affecting the graphics. 
Check for recent soiftware additions or upgrades- something you've recently
installed might be causing a major conflict.

Three-fingered salute might free it.  There's a bug in the scsi.device in
the 3.1 ROMS that can make A4000's hang (possibly others, but my own
machine happens to be an A4000, so I've seen it myself on that at least)
for inrodinate amounts of time.  A keyboard reset or sometimes a cold-reset
will do it.  The latest OS3.5 update clears this bug BTW, giving me the
fastest reset times I've seen since I swapped my 3.0s out for 3.1s

Same reason as above.

If searching your software and upgrading to 3.5 doesn't do it then there's
one other nastier possibility... the dreaded CIA chips.  Flaky as a
croisant, dirt cheap, but surface mounted onto the A4000 motherboards (and
hence expensive to repair).

Hope this helps.

I'd go for the powersupply or a bad soldering.
Also check the PSUs cable connections.

Hi 

-> I'd go for the powersupply or a bad soldering.
-> Also check the PSUs cable connections.
 
I'd agree with the dodgy PSU thing because it would cause the power
light to flicker/dim, and i've had this problem cause the hard disk
to go into a continuous spin on certain occasions.. It might be that
 the PSU is on its last legs, or simply not powerful enough to cope 
with the bits you have in your system (although i'd have thought
an A4000 PSU would handle a fair load).

Might be worth disconnecting the power from the CD Rom drive and
disconnecting the external floppies if you havent already done it,
see if that changes anything.

Adding to your diagnosis, If the leds are flickering stop using that 
power supply NOW !!!  Danger in death to PSU or computer or both.


If the PSU is an A500, check the solder joints around the main switched 
mode IC (the long one) make sure all joints connect to the copper foil, 
and re-inforce the tracks to the chip.

Also, the solder joints on the conputers power in connector, don't 
over look this problem area too.

A4000 PSU'ds are starting to fall over, I have replaced *8* so far this 
year I replace with a PC 230 or 300 watt unit.
OH, BTW, 19 A4000 PSU last year I replaced to give you an idea, 
also 9 A500's fixed inthe above manner.

 Nice idea, but seriously, is it worth not checking it.

Hello,

I'm not sure it's the right place to ask for this problem?

Since I put my CyberstormPPC in my A3000T the internal scsi is not anymore
usuable. It seems to have lots of errors. Some time even didn't recognise
partitions on the disks.

when switching back to the A3640, every things work fine.

I have patch my motherboard with the int_2 line, but how can I be really
sure it's well working?

Any suggestion welcome.

Thank you et meilleures salutations.

This seems to be a common problem with A3000(T)'s and CSPPC boards. I had
exactly the same problem when I first put the CSPPC in my machine, but I
eventually managed to get it working. Unfortunately I've got absolutely no
idea what I actually did to get it working.

That's not very helpfull to you is it? All I can suggest is that you try
putting your drives in different positions on the chain, perhaps removing all
drives except you boot hard drive and see what happens.
 
> when switching back to the A3640, every things work fine.

Yeah, I'm stuck with one of those atm, I sent my CSPPC back to phase 5 for
repair last year and I haven't seen it since - don't know if I ever will now
either :-(

Cheers.

Can anyone help?

--- Forwarded message follows ---


I am looking for the diagram that will allow me to build an Amiga power
supply from an old (working) PC power supply.  I have 2 200w that are not
doing anything.    If you have that diagram, could you send it my way? 
I don't care what graphic format it is in, but please do not .lha it or anything
like that unless you ZIP is with a PC compatable zip program as that  is all
I have left to use.  
Thanks

He will be using the power supply with an A1200.  I recall seeing this on
the net, so a site address would also be a big help.

Try Aminet hardware (or similar) look for tower building texts.

The diagram for the 1200's supply should be on the case. Cut the connector off of
the PC supply making sure to leave as much wire on the supply as possible. All you
need to do is is use a volt meter to check the out put on the pc lines then just
splice the identical ones together. Volt meter measurement is recommended even if
you have a diagram for both supplies. When you cut the cable from the old 1200
supply leave it as long as possible.

I performed this on my 1200 and the results were great, it would not even boot with
an accelerator attached before I did. If you need more help look for a page on the
web that has information about converting a 1200 to tower, they usually include this
mod.

Ok... I'll bite, where does the Towerhawk come from, and what does

Where does it come from???

I meant, it can't sometimes decide where to put the keys, ie, which key is
Amiga etc...

Dear ALL,

Does anyone have, ever used, know anyone with the
Fujifilm DX-10 digital camera?

I was looking to get the one sold by eyetech but for
certain reasons its gone out of my price range, the
Fujifilm dx-10 is a perfect price for me so I wondered
if anyones used one or knows if is any good/bad,
obviously you get what you pay for an a £200 digital
camera isn't going to be top quality, but does
anyone know if its at least useable? I'm looking for
at least a clear-ish shot, not so you can't tell
who the person or item in the picture is.

Also, it will come with PC cables and software so
what cable will I need to buy, wheres it available
and will that CamControl software support this
camera?

Thanks in advance! 

Toodle Pip!

*18.o2.2ooo*:

*CHRIS SEWARD, EDITOR. LEAVING AIO.*

The last issue that I will be editor of will be issue
33 which is due for release, Sunday, 27 February 2000.

After this issue the current Articles Editor, Mark
Tierno (mark@aio.co.uk) will take over as the full
time editor of Amiga Information Online, carrying
out all editorial tasks, maintaining the website and
everything else associated. He will have full control
over the future of the magazine.

I will still be helping with the magazine when possible
and giving Mark any help he requires.

I am _*NOT*_ leaving the Amiga market and still to this day
am 100% an Amiga user, I do not even own a PC or Mac
and nor do I intend to.

The main reason I am leaving is so that the magazine
I started in May of 1997 will be given a new lease
of life and hopefully taken on to bigger and greater
things.

I feel that I personally have taken the magazine to a
point where I can take it no further and for the sake
of the magazine and you the readers for further
improvements to be made and allowing AIO to become
more popular than it currently is then I think this
is the measure that is needed.

I will ofcourse miss writing AIO but would like to keep
in contact with everyone and no doubt will be annoying
you lot on the mailing list as much as I have done
so far :)

I'm not leaving the list and i'm still moderator so
nothing there has changed. I will be looking to start
other Amiga and maybe some non-amiga/web based ventures
and will keep you informed of whats going on etc.

The last article about me will be in issue 34, if you
have a goodbye message to me, or want to tell people
what you think of me, or think i was totally crap
as editor then please send those to;

goodbye@aio.co.uk

These letters will be printed next issue. I would still
like to keep in contact with people so in future you can
contact me at either of these email addresses.

amiga@fdn.co.uk
chris@aio.co.uk

I just downgrade my A3000T to the original DMAC-02 and ramsey-04 and the
onboard SCSI seems to work corectly again. I was using DMAC-04 & Ramsey-07
for some years without problem!?! till the CyberstormPPC :-(.

I was using an UW disk which works very well on the Cyberstorm's SCSI, so my
A3000T was still fully usable. Was just hoping to use my external ZIP and
perhaps a new SCSI scanner.

Ooups... Very sorry for your card. Have a look on the lawer responsible of
phase5 insolvability at a-news. You seems to have to write her for (perhaps
and later) getting back your CSPPC. I'm really not fluent with deutsch so 
I'm not sure at all to have understand what was written on this page:

Well, if the pixels (definition) look good enough for what you need, you only
have to consider what type of memory this thing uses and how to get the pics
off the memory card. Other than the Sony Mavicas, I think most cameras use the
SmartMedia or Compact Flash cards. This now becomes interesting. I have been
using one of the Mavicas for a couple of years and it is quite handy to simply
pop the floppie into the high density drive and copy the pics over to my hard
drive. Now that the cameras have much higher definition (and prices) I have
become interested in one of the ram card media types also. However with the
flash cards you are going to have to move the pics over with some kind of
serial attachment or whatever. Although these are occasionally usable with the
Amiga, there are readers available in differing formats. I have recently
invested in one of the external SCSI card readers that looks like a small PDA.
Frankly, it simply requires the PCMCIA type adapter for the digital camera ram
media and you simply plug it into the reader. Really a nice setup and
supposedly quite fast, but most of the newer readers are USB and the SCSI
models are becoming somewhat hard to find. Another user mentioned that these
little beasts can also serve as ram drives for even booting from.

The description given is

"Resolution over twice as good as VGA cameras. 850,000
pixels CCD for clear, sharp pictures."

What i wanted to know if anyones had any experience
with this camera and surely it just requires some
serial cable and camcontrol software?

I know someone who has the Sony one and he took a
picture of a person and it was pretty bad, maybe
the lighting was wrong, but thats about £449.00
which is out of my price range.

The pictures are stored on a memory chip, you can
get replacements from 2mb - 32mb etc.

How did you get that thing working with the Amiga? I have a buddy that
has tried everything he can think of to get it working with his A4060T,
all to no avail. He has to use it on his Pentium, then transfer from the
card to a zip, and move that to the Amiga. A bit roundabout, no?

Just never heard the term before and thought it might mean something
I never knew you could do with Amiga keyboards.

Dear All,

I just received an email from the webmaster at
gamestop10.com telling me that AIO is in some Amiga
charts they have.

Personally I'd never heard or visited this site
before.

Go check it out and don't forget to vote for AIO :)

Well, I hope the statement was not premature. I bought the reader and simply
plugged it into thee SCSI chain. However, I do not have the memory card yet
(making the purchase this week) but after booting up, I checked the SCSI
devices and (boink!) there it is listed. I am not overly concerned there
should be any problems except the possible formatting of the media. Will let
you know when I get the media.
