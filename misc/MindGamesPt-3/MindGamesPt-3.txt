1.) For Medical Purposes.
Captain Kirk of the Star Ship Enterprise, brought aboard 28 bottles
of brandy - for mediacl purposes - which he kept in the ship's
"wine cellar", a three-by-three-foot storage bin in his quarters.
Suspecting that some crew members might try to take off with a
bottle or two for recreational purposes, he arraged them in the
bin as shown bellow, so that nine bottles can be counted on each
side. In this way, he felt, he could tell at a glance if any were
missing.
                   
                   -------------
                   | 2 | 5 | 2 |
                   |---|---|---|
                   | 5 |   | 5 |
                   |---|---|---|
                   | 2 | 5 | 2 |
                   -------------

During the next party on C deck, howerver, the first mate snuck
into the storage area and appropriated four of the bottles, then
rearanged the ones that remained so that when the captian next
checked his cache, he would still count nine bottles on each side
of the bin.

A few days late, the navigator decided to pep up a party using the
same technique. He also stole into the secret room and took four
bottles, then rearanged the rest so that when the captain next
checked, there would still be nine bottles visible on each side
of the bin.
How, during their covert operations, did the first mate and the
navigator each arrange the bottles?

2.) The diagram above serves double duty: Use it again for this
puzzle, ignoring the numbers. Now it represents a new building
with eight appartments - four at the sides and four at the corners.
The housing director has received  a complaint from some tenants in
the building: Aparently twice as many people have a southward view
(toward a garbage dump) as look east (toward a sheet-metal factory).
Those who have a view to the west (toward another apartment building)
are only one-third as many as look south, while the lucky tenants
with a northerly view (toward the park) are only half as many as look
east, toward the sheet-metal factory.
There are 20 tenants in the building, all told, and there is at least
one in each apartment. How many people occupy each apartment?

3.) Bong!
When the clock in the bell tower strikes six, it takes 18 seconds
between the first and the last strikes. How many seconds does
it take for a clock to strike 12?

4.) Cout 'Em.
The challenge: Read the card through once only, and count the number
of times the letter F appears.

5.) Twelve Points.
The problem: Given 12 evenly spaced points, how many rectangles
have four of these points as vertices?

    *    *    *    *


    *    *    *    *


    *    *    *    *

6.) Three Squares.
Can you trace the design below-three overlping squares
in one continuous line, without lifting the pen from the
paper and without retracing any line?
       
      ----   
     |    |       
    -|--  |
   | |  | | 
 --|- ---- 
|  | |  |

7.) Target
This design ("see Target.iff or Target.gif") shows three concetric
circles with a line trough the center. It is possible to draw the
figure in one continuous line, without any line crossing another,
and without lifting the pen from the paper. how would you do it?

8.) Circle Sqaured.
This geometrical design ("see CirQube.iff or CirQube.gif")
has four squares at alternating angles inside a circumscribed
circle-can also be drawn in one continuous line, without lifting
the pen from paper, and without going over any line twice.
Can you do it?

9.) Clock Problem.
A clock loses four minutes every hour. It was set correctly
three and a half hours ago. Now the correct correct time is
noon. To the nearest minute, when will this slow clock show noon?

10.) Add Up.
The correct way to write nine thousand nine hundred and nine dollars
is $9,909. What is tyhe correct way to write twelve thousand twelve
hundred and twelve dollars?

11.) Wordies.
Assume that the following pairs of three-letter words are related.

 sly hob
 vow elb
 all zoo

Which of the following four letter word are realated in the same way?

(a) vary (b) glow (c) lose (d) part (e) told (f) come


12.) A Spell down the garden path.
In these puzzles you get some one to spell three or four words,
one at a time, and then you hit them with an innocent question.

	A.) First spell the words coast, roast, and boast.
	    Then answer this question:
	    What do you put in a toaster?

	B.) Spell cop, top, and mop. Then:
	    What do you do at a green light?

	C.) Spell joke, toke and folk. Then:
	    What is the white of an egg called?
	    
	D.) Spell silk and bilk. Then:
	    What do cows drink?
