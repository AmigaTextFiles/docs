@{u}Break up of paper:@{uu}
Part A - 40% of marks - Based on year 11 work and Dynamic Nature of
                        Business
Part B - 60% of marks - 3 Essays (Each 20 marks) - Based on year 12
                        Electives (and supplementary material!)

@{u}Break up of the meaning of marks:@{uu}
Mark:  Comment:
 A     Detailed analysis with sufficent examples (use of terms)
 B     Good description with some examples
 C     Answered the question (60% of students don't!)
 D     Answers question unsatisfactorily
 E     Fails to attempt question properly

These marks will not be seen by students but are how the HSC markers
work out an essays value.

@{u}Break up of an questions worth:@{uu}
Part A - Worth the least but still important to answer
Part B - Worth the most, and therefore should be given extra time
         to answer
Part C - Same as B, so equal time should be given for B and C
Part D - If a part D does exist, it is usually worth equal or
         slightly less than B/C

@{b}QUESTION 7 OF LAST YEARS PAPERS WAS THE WORST ANSWERED QUESTION,
A VARIATION OF THAT QUESTION WILL EXIST IN THE '94 PAPER. 30% OF
STUDENTS GOT THIS RIGHT!@{ub} (Q7 - Multiple Choice)

If you don't know a term/question look it up or ask your teacher
AND write it down!

'....Business Studies students are supposed to answer like Business
studies students.'

While the previous sentence may not make much sense to you, it means
this, Business Studies papers are meant to be answered in Business
forms of writing, not english essay form, or an other subjects way
of writing.

Report style writing is highly recommended when answering essays!
This is NOT the same as English essay styles of writing. A report
style document consists of an introduction, points below fully
explained and supported, and a concluding paragraph; graphs are
also an intregal part of a report style document, but DONT try
to make a graph it is not necessary.

In report style writing if necessary use tables, graphs, diagrams,
underlining, headings, and highlighting.

When answering a question, IF it FULLY answers the question beyond
doubt THEN do any style of answer you wish, even if a diagram is
your whole answer. In thise case words are NOT needed. Other ideas
include a time line, graph or chart.

But MOST IMPORTANTLY - @{b}PLAN FOR ALL POSSIBILITIES!!@{ub}

@{u}Industrial Relations:@{uu}

@{b}INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IS THE STUDY OF HOW PEOPLE IN POWER MAKE
DECISIONS WHICH EFFECT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND
EMPLOYEES@{ub}

Summary:
* Can be the cause of success or failure of business
* IR is effected by the marco environment
* The government and unions play a vital role in IR negociations,
  from these negotiatons laws sometimes are altered.
* Governments have control through legislation to enforce things such
  as working conditions and pay. They generally rely on independant
  tribunals to settle the matters of industrial conflict.
* IRC (@{b}I@{ub}ndustrial @{b}R@{ub}elations @{b}C@{ub}ommission) is responsible for the
  majority of the conciliation and arbitration in this country
* Unions effectiveness depends largely on the number of workers
  in registered unions Vs's the amount which are independant
* Employers like employees don't all have the one union but have
  ones specialised for their particular area
* Different types of trade unions have different policies and practices,
  power and influence
* Larger firms (with generally larger number of employees) have quite
  a lot of people involved with the IR of the business

* @{b}Six Parties in Australian IR:@{ub}

  - State & Federal Government         - Industrial Tribunals
  - Employers                          - Employers associations
  - Trade Unions                       - Employees

* @{b}Business Union Structure:@{ub}

  - Shop Steward - Acts as a union representitive between the union
                   and it's members
                          |
                          |
  - Industrial Officers / Union Organisers - Travel between worksites
                                             settling local disputes
                          |
                          |
  - State Executive - Take care of serious disputes and taks reports
                      by industrial officers
                          |
                          |
  - State Council - Determines long term policies for their state
                    in which unions must obey
                          |
                          |
  - Federal Council / Conference - This is where state unions are
                                   joined at a federal level who
                                   then delegates a Federal Exec.
  - Federal Executive - Decides on national policies of the union

  - Cancelling awards
  - Deregistering a union - Leaving a union powerless eg.BLF
                            (Builders, Labourers Federation)

@{u}History of Industrial Relations:@{uu}

Summary:
* Did not originate in Australia but in Middle Ages
* Australian IR is a @{b}DUAL@{ub} system, Federal and state
* Before the Industrial Revolution production was basically subsistence,
  with any surplus being used for exchange in the local markets
* The Industrial Revolution changed the way production was organised.
  It was broken down so instead of people being multi-skilled and
  finishing a project single handed they were now assigned more simple,
  repetitive tasks
* As the division of labour and mechanisation of production developed
  large sums of money were needed, this money was called Capital.
* The individual craftsman could no longer afford to setup production
* As the economy developed the individual worker became a commodity
  and therefore could be manipulated as well, this did not only occur
  with factory workers but also occured with the 'working class'
* It became harder for the worker to deprive a employer of his services
* @{b}Section 51 of the Australian Constitution@{ub} limits the power of the
  Government to be involved with IR

@{u}Development of unions in Australia:@{uu} - Time Line

1829   - Government brought in '@{i}Masters and Servants Act@{ui}'
         (Setting out wages and conditions)
1840's - Development of craft unions
1880's - Unskilled and semi-skilled unions formed
1890   - South Australian Government passes the first
         Arbitration Bill
1890's - A.L.P. (Australian Labor Party) formed
1904   - Conciliation And Arbitration Act passed
1907   - Harvester case (Sets basic wage)

@{u}Recent 20th Century developments:@{uu}

- Increase in trade unions
- Trade union membership decreases from 55% in the 1980's to less
  than 42% now
- 1980's bring a drop in private sector membership and an
  increase in part time and casual employees
- 1990's introduce @{b}@{i}Enterprise Bargining@{ub}@{ui} into the workplace

@{u}Recent IR Issues:@{uu}

- Wharfies dispute involving the Maritime Union of Australia. It
  involved the retrenchment of 55 employees (2/3rd's union reps)
  for failure to agree to an enterprise agreement. The federal
  government took over mediation of this dispute. Employees
  believe it wasn't a '@{i}just cause@{ui}' for the sackings.
  New enterprise agreements were drawn up, and with much mediation,
  this problem has now been solved, and workers across the country
  have returned to their jobs

- Customs officers strike in April 1994 is another example.
  Australian Customs Service and the Federal Government were the
  two parties involved in the dispute. Went to Federal level to
  try and solve dispute. The Australian Customs Service managed
  through their Trade Union, to gain many of their demands (9/10)
  within the 24 hours the officers striked for. A solution was
  reached to continue talks to discuss factor 10, which was the
  lay off's announced

- Introduction of the recent @{i}@{b}I@{ub}ndustrial @{b}R@{ub}elations Reform Act@{ui},
  and recent laws providing greater equality for women in the
  workforce. The recent IR Reform act takes away most of unions
  legal powers, but keeps some of the old systems as a '@{i}safety
  net@{ui}'

@{u}Reasion for decline in Trade Union membership:@{uu}

Since the 1980's Trade Union membership has declined for four main
reasons:

* Decline in manafacturing and public sectors, which is a traditional
  union area
* Employment growth in Small Business, traditionally less-unionised
* Growth in part-time and casual jobs, traditionally less-unionised
* Increased participation of women, traditionally less-unionised

@{b}@{u}Methods for determining wages:@{ub}@{uu}

@{u}Centralized System:@{uu}

- Not worked out between management and employees, but on a national
  level
- IRC determines national wage case of, (A) Base wage
                                        (B) Wage increases
- Wage increases based (I) Productivity
                      (II) Effeciency of particular industry

@{u}Decentralized System:@{uu}

- Wage increases - Negociated between employees and management
                 - Effects particular company only
- Wages must be at award rate or higher eg. SPC Cannery

@{i}Study Tips:@{ui}
- Know how the Industrial Relations System was established.
- Who/What are the major parties?
- Know how problems/grievances are solved!
- Know if something is a Federal or State award!

      MARKETING IS ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT IS DESIGNED TO:
            PLAN    PRICE     PROMOTE    DISTRIBUTE
WANT SATISFYING PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND IDEAS TO TARGET MARKETS SO THAT
           AN ORGANISATION CAN ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES.

@{b}* IDENTIFY CUSTOMERS
* ATTRACT THEIR ATTENTION
* SATISFY WANTS@{ub}

@{u}Product Marketing:@{uu} - Definition
"The essential element of marketing is customer want satisfaction
 .... the customer's want satisfaction is the economic and social
 reason for an organisations existence."

@{u}The Marketing Plan:@{uu} - Definition
".... a document prepared for the purpose of providing guidelines
 for a business units marketing programmes and allocations over a
 prescribed planning period."

@{u}Marketing Planning Definiton:@{uu}
Is vital for all successful companies because the business environment
is highly complex, dynamic, and competitive. Marketing and market
planning is relevant to large and small organisations in both public
and private sectors.

@{u}The Marketing Plan:@{uu}

@{u}1.Market Research:@{uu} - Situation Analysis

- A situation analysis, is broken down into several different areas.
  These are: SWOT Analysis, Customer Analysis (to establish a target
  market), Competitor Appraisal, and Resource Analysis.

- The business must make a Situational Analysis based on the influences
  of the Macro environment, as well as the proximate environment

- Market Segmentation (target market) involves deviding up groups of
  people into buyers of certain products/services

@{u}A.@{uu} @{b}Customer Analysis:@{ub}
   A target market can be established by looking at the following factors:
   * Where it is accesible (both the product and message)
   * The demography (the population in a group or area(s)) of an
     assortment of places
   * What size should the market be - In numbers (Sizeable)
                                    - And in boundaries (Measurable)
   * What are the identifiable factors of this market (how it differs
     to other target markets)
   * Psychographically - Lifestyle based/image of the target market
   * Geographically - Which regions/areas
   * Benefit - Focus on the benefit the product provides, for this
     target market, not on the customer characteristics
   * Size - Frequency of use/level of demand in the target market,
     being either heavy, medium, or light

   * @{b}Using the above factors in formulating a group which satisfy all
     of the above points, you have now established a target market@{ub}

@{u}B.@{uu} @{b}Competitor Appraisal:@{ub}
   Once a target market has been established you must then analyse
   the competition (if any). There two three types of competition
   a company can have:

   1. @{b}Direct Competition@{ub}  - When one business aproaches the customers of
                            another business and attempts to win them over.
                            This only happens when two or more companies
                            are producing the same product

   2. @{b}Substitute Products@{ub} - Another type of competition which can come
                            from one company producing a substitute
                            product of another companies product line

   @{u}Competitor Monitoring:@{uu}
   This is a vital part of the market research. The best form of
   competitor monitoring, is to calculate their market share by
   estimating the total value of the market. If a competitor is
   gaining a greater market share, it is time for the company to
   re-organise their marketing plan

- Competitive advantage refers to all things an organisation can
  do better than it's competitors

@{u}C.@{uu} @{b}Resource Analysis:@{ub}
   Once you have completed a competitor appraisal you must then do
   a resource analysis. The businesses resources are broken down into
   three areas, these are:

   1. @{b}Staff@{ub}   - The marketing plan should analyse the skills of every
                employee involved in marketing. Your staff should be
                promoting the image you wish the public to think of the
                company. They should be well trained in areas such as
                the art of selling, good customer relations, and more.
                The people should have the following skills: Alertness,
                good knowledge of product, good appearance, good
                communication skills, and dedication to maintain the
                product in a competitive environment

   2. @{b}Finance@{ub} - Finance is needed for different methods of advertising
                or promoting the product. These needs vary according to
                the life cycle of the business. Finance is necessary
                for the promotion or development of new products

   3. @{b}Assets@{ub}  - The fixed assets of a business will determine the
                capacity of the production system. A successful
                product can be stopped from greater production if
                resources are at full usage. The marketing plan
                should recognise: * The availability of assets
                                  * The degree of utilisation of
                                    assets

@{u}D.@{uu} @{b}SWOT Analysis:@{ub}
   This needless to say means an analysis of the:
   @{b}S@{ub}trengths - which areas a business excells compared to it's
                        competitors
   @{b}W@{ub}eaknesses - which areas other businesses has to improve on
                         in relation to it's competitors
   @{b}O@{ub}pportunities - All things which benefit the business
   @{b}T@{ub}hreats - All things which can threaten a businesses
                      survival, or a product's survival

   Aspects which influence a SWOT analysis are:

   - Market share  - Sales        - Profits
   - Competition   - Advertising  - Size of customer base
   - Pricing       - Innovative potential.
   - Product characteristics (company reputation, price, design,
     colour uniqueness, quality, warranty, packaging, sales
     support, and positioning in market)

@{u}2. Objectives and Stratergies:@{uu}

@{u}A.@{uu} @{b}Specific Objectives:@{ub}
   Establishing objectives it is usually thought of as the most important
   in the planning process. The success and failure of a marketing plan
   are determined by how well the marketing objective reflects the
   organisations needs. Therefore it is vital objectives are set based
   around the companies overall goals. This is reflected in the diagram

   4. @{b}Staff Motivation:@{ub} The effectiveness of the companies
      market will depend heavily upon the staff, and their degree
      of motivation.

@{u}C.@{uu} @{b}Cost/Benefit Analysis:@{ub}
   As plans and objectives are developed, statements should be
   produced which should say what the marketing stratergy is to
   accomplish. There are two ways of evaluating the actual
   peformance of these plans, these are sales analysis and cost
   analysis.

   1. @{b}Sales Analysis:@{ub} Sales is usually the best way to measure
                      the performance of a marketing plan. This
                      analysis should be broken down into:
                            - Marketing area (geographical)
                            - Company devision (eg. NSW devision)
                            - Individual/Groups of sales
                              representatives (Quota of sales Vs's
                              Individual/Group's sale)

   2. @{b}Cost Analysis:@{ub} This is a detailed study of the business's
                     operating section of the organisation's
                     profit and loss statement. With cost analysis
                     costs which occured as a result of the
                     marketing sector of a business are declared
                     as profitable or unprofitable. This can be
                     broken down into: (I) Research costs
                                      (II) Order-getting costs
                                           (Promotional costs)
                                     (III) Order-filling costs
                                           (Distribution and
                                            insurance costs)

@NODE Amigaware "What is Amigaware"

         @{b}What is Amigaware?@{ub}
         ------------------

         Amigaware is a new concept, as it has been invented by
         me. What Amigaware is, if you use this program alot,
         or any Amigaware program, you will either go out and
         buy an Amiga product, or instead sell off other non-Amiga
         computer equipment you own (and with the money maybe buy
         an Amiga product). This concept is very similar to
         freeware, as all benefits of this program do not go
         to me, but to you and other Amiga users. It also could
         be described as self-giftware. :-)

         How did this idea come about?
         -----------------------------
         It came about when I was sick of people selling up
         their Amiga's to port over to other lesser machines.
         So I decided hey, do something to support the Amiga,
         which will benefit ALL Amigans. As mentioned above
         Amigaware does NOT benefit me!, it benefits everyone.

         Well, How does anyone know Im a supporter?
         ------------------------------------------
         If you can send me in a receipt with proof of sale of
         a non-Amiga computer product, or Amiga product bought
         as a result of reading this then if you send me a
         disk with your address enclosed I will give you a free
         copy of the code of this program. I normally would
         charge for the code. Also when you send me your proof
         of purchase I will in my next Amigaware program
         include your name in a list of Amigaware supporters.
