## intro

@NODE intro "* Introduction *"

  This guide contains the description of some 'packed' MOD formats. My guess
 is that nobody is interrested anymore in these descriptions, but I've gathered
 them all the same :). I think it's always good to know history. Now, it's not
 that much historical, so I ask for help/advices when it comes to what's already
 described and/or what will be !.
  Dont hesitate to send me Packed MODs, Packers and Trackers !. I'll welcome
 nearly everything.

(about this loop start /4 or /2, I cannot tell for sure bcoz I've
encountered BOTH cases : "Guardian dragon" (/2) & "Guardian dragon II" (/4).
I guess Laxity did a new version of his tracker in between those two demos :).
It's not that hard to check if it's /2 or /4 ... somehow, the hardiest was
to know :).


950            1         Number of pattern to play
(3B6h)
951            1         "noisetracker byte" set to $00
(3B7h)

(3B8h)       (80h)

1080           4         "M.K."  ID string. Gryzor says this ID is not
(438h)                   always present. I've only two Unic files and
                         both have this ID. Now, Marley states there
                         can be the ID "UNIC" instead or even $00-00-00-00.
                         I've just find out that the first music of the demo
                         "desert dream" by Kefrens is a UNIC, has a title and
                         no ID string !. Coool ... thx Laxity :(.
1080/1084      ?         Pattern datas.


 each pattern takes 300h bytes
 row 00 | channel 1 | channel 2 | channel 3 | channel 4 |
 row 01 | channel 1 | channel 2 | channel 3 | channel 4 |
  ...
 row 63 | channel 1 | channel 2 | channel 3 | channel 4 |


 each channel is coded that way :

 0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
 ||\\     /  \\  / \\  /  \\       /

 || note     ||          value
 ||number    ||
 ||          //
 | \\        //
 |  sample number
 |
unused

effect:
  Just note that pattern break effect command (D**) uses HEX value
 in UNIC format (while it is DEC values in PTK). Thus, it has to
 be converted !.

relative note number (PTK):

C-1 to B-1 : 856,808,762,720,678,640,604,570,538,508,480,453

C-3 to B-3 : 214,202,190,180,170,160,151,143,135,127,120,113

the very same tracker with but a few minor changes ... . Someone
knows how to contact Laxity ?)

434 ($1B2)    14         ?!?!?!? Couldn't understand
                         nothing out of these bytes.
                         Though, it's fairly safe to
                         say that there might be the
                         number of pattern in pattern
                         list ... . It's possible to
                         convert without this info, but
                         it's VERY hard !.

448 ($1C0)    512 ($200) pattern list (128 dword)

 it's a table of pointers which points at the adresses
of the pattern data in the "PhaPacked" file. So, the
pattern 0 will be the one starting right after the smp
data. Beware of the unused patterns when converting !.


960 ($3C0)    ??         sample data

 stored the same way as Protracker.


??            ??         pattern data

 Stored like protracker .. meaning:
 row 01: voice 1 | voice 2 | voice 3 | voice 4
 row 02: voice 1 | voice 2 | voice 3 | voice 4
 ...

 each voice is 4 bytes (ot two bytes .. see below).

Two cases depending of first byte:

 0000-0000  0000-0000
 \\       /  \\       /
   $ff        value

 If the first byte is $ff, then the following byte is
the number of times the previous value in THIS row will
be re-used. Well, in fact, it's ($ff-value) number of
times !.
 example :

  01-02-0A-0A  00-00-0F-06  02-00-00-37  FF-F5
  1st four bytes : Sample #1, Note #1, Fx Vol Slide, FxArg $0A.
  2nd four bytes : no sample, no note, Fx Set Speed, FxArg $06.
  3rd four bytes : sample #2, no note, no Fx or arpeggio, FxArg $37.
  4th block : $ff meaning previous block (02-00-00-37) will be repeated
             FF-F5=0A times IN THE VOICE #3 !!!.

(126Ah)                  pattern from $146A. Pattern $00 address, in this
                         list, will be $00000000.


5226          WPS        pattern data. Each pattern is 512 bytes long. Though,
(146Ah)                  that's the theory because some patterns may NOT be
                         that long. In fact, you'll have to check if the note
                         isn't a PATTERN BREAK command or a PATTERN JUMP. If
                         so, the pattern ends and another begins ... therefore,
                         its size is less than the 512 'standard bytes'.
                         Now, whatever the pattern size is, its meaning does
                         not vary :). In fact, those data are some values which
                         refer to a "reference table" (description is right
                         below).

5226+          ?         the "reference table" which contains the standard
WPS                      PTK pattern data. Its size is easy to calculate since
                         it consists of blocks of 4 bytes, knowing that there
                         are 'n' blocks ('n' is the highest value in the
                         pattern data).

                         might be used when playing ...
282h          80h        pointer table

 pointer table contains 64 pointers ( one word each )
pointing at the first pattern data. It starts at 0000h
and goes on adding pattern sizes. As an exemple, if
pattern 0 is 1024 bytes long and pattern 1 is 1000
bytes long, first pointer table will be 0000, second
will be 0400. the rest is filled with 0000h.
 seems unusable to me ...

302h           ?         pattern data

 we get something like

 pattern 0 :
 row 0 | voice 1 | voice 2 | voice 3 | voice 4 |
 row 1 | voice 1 | voice 2 | voice 3 | voice 4 |
 row 2 ...
 row 63| voice 1 | voice 2 | voice 3 | voice 4 |
 pattern 1 :
 ...

 the size of each pattern is variable and is between
100h and 300h bytes. One voice can be 1 or 3 bytes long.
it depends if bit 7 of first byte is set to 1. If so,
the size of this voice is 1 byte. It means there's
nothing at this line. If this bit is set to 0, the size
of this voice is 3 bytes. so we get :

 1000 0000
 |
 if this bit is set, nothing follows and this is an
empty note. it meens for PTK four bytes set to 00h.
 1100 0000
  |
 if both first bits are set to 1, it meens that
previous note IN THIS ROW will be re-used ... .

if first bit is set to 0, follows the description

  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
  ||     ||     | |  |  |       |

| relative sample effect  effect
|   note   number         value
|  number
|------------description bit set to 0

sample number :
  hard to get by this way of coding :( ... anyway, let's try
 tro explain it ...
  first, we agree it's coded on 5 bits.
   0 0 0 0 0   ( in the order of saving )
  I name these bit 0, bit 1, bit 2, bit 3 and bit 4 in the
 same order of saving.
  in fact, all we got to do, is to rol the whole five bits
 by one on the left.
  exemples :
   10000 will become 00001   (sample 1)
   01010 will become 10100   (sample 20)
   00010 will become 00100   (sample 4)
   etc...

249 (F9h)      1         "NoiseTracker" byte (set to 7Fh)
250 (FAh)   512 (200h)   Tracks table. In fact, it's four (4) tables of
                         128 (80h) bytes each, where 128 is the number
                         of pattern position. So, it's four tables for
                         the four voices. These tables contain the numbers
                         of tracks for each voice. (1st value is 0)

762 (2FAh)  128*NOP      Tracks "data". It's 64 values (2 bytes each) which

                         Well, this table contains the real tracks data. It's
                         filled with the standard ptk four bytes description
                         for one note. As an example, let's suppose the Track
                         "data" value is 00-01, then, its real value will be
                         the second block of four bytes in this table.
                         A quick calculation shows that it can be very
                         expensive because there's around 4,5 million
                         possibilities ... (36*31*16*256).

      * Here's a quick description of these four bytes (like ptk ...)

                         Well, this table contains the real tracks data. It's
                         filled with the standard ptk four bytes description
                         for one note. As an example, let's suppose the Track
                         "data" value is 00-01, then, its real value will be
                         the second block of four bytes in this table.
                         A quick calculation shows that it can be very
                         expensive because there's around 4,5 million
                         possibilities ... (36*31*16*256).

      * Here's a quick description of these four bytes (like ptk ...)

         _____byte 1_____   byte2_    _____byte 3_____   byte4_
        /                 /        /                 /        /

896            ?         Pattern data

 we get something like

 pattern 0 :
   all the 64 row of voice 0
   all the 64 row of voice 1
   all the 64 row of voice 2
   all the 64 row of voice 3
 pattern 1 :
 ...

 Each pattern begins with 3 dword. Each is the number of
byte to add to find the voice 1, 2 and 3. (Voice 0 starts
always at 0).

 the size of each pattern is variable. It can be up to
300h bytes. One note can be 1 or 3 bytes long,
or even 0 bytes :).
 The first bit of the first byte is a description bit.
If it is set to 1, it means there wont be any note during
the next (first_byte - $80):


* case 1:

     val
  /      \\
 1000 0000
 |
 if this bit is set, follows 'val' empty in the voice.


* case 2:

 0000 0000  0000 0000
 ||\\     /  \\  / \\  /
/ | note    Smp2  ||
|Smp              ||
|              bin(0111)
|
Description bit set to 0.

 As far as I can tell, it seems Fx Command 7 is not supported
by this packer, and, therefore, is used here for another purpose.
First, about the 'Smp', it is the sample value (max $1f). Next,
the 'bin' value is, in this case, set to 7, meaning there's no
effect command, nor effect value. At least, the Note. It seems
it is the "standard" relative note number as found in many other
packers, save that it supports one more octave. When converting
back to Ptk, just remove $C to this value ... and check below
the correspondance table.


* case 3:

if first bit is set to 0, follows the description

     Sample number
    /         /\\
   |         |  |
  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000

 -|  \\   /         \\/    \\     /
|  relative       effect  effect
|    note         (!$7)   value
|   number
|------------description bit set to 0


 As in case 2 , with the effect command != 7. The only
difference with previous case is the adding of an effect
value.


Note: if the Note value is $3F, it means there no note !.
On another hand, if Note value is $00, it means the note
is C-1 ($358 under Ptk).

(43Ch)                   track for each pattern. Each value is a
                         word. So, first pattern will be defined
                         by the four first tracks (4 first words).

  ?           24         ?!? (no clue !)


  ?            ?         tracks datas. Refer to the track address table
                         upward. All the files I've packed so far DO
                         have the first track address at $850, but ... .


 each track is packed as follow :

766            ?         pattern data. stored like 'almost' like
(2FEh)                   Protracker. The difference remains in the

                         save for the 4 lower bits.


 So, each is stored that way :


   -----Sample Number----

        Note value         effect   effect
                                  parameter

NOTE: Promizer v0.1 (as v1.0c and v1.8a) saves the "finetuned"
     pitch if the sample got a 'not null' finetune. Refer to
     the table below where there are all the possible pitchs
     for each finetune.

(1264h)

4710          512        pattern table. It's the starting address of each
(1266h)                  pattern from $1466. Pattern $00 address, in this
                         list, will be $00000000.


5222          WPS        pattern data. Each pattern is 512 bytes long. Though,
(1466h)                  that's the theory because some patterns may NOT be
                         that long. In fact, you'll have to check if the note
                         isn't a PATTERN BREAK command or a PATTERN JUMP. If
                         so, the pattern ends and another begins ... therefore,
                         its size is less than the 512 'standard bytes'.
                         Now, whatever the pattern size is, its meaning does
                         not vary :). In fact, those data are some values which
                         refer to a "reference table" (description is right
                         below).
                         RMQ: first value is 00h.

5222+          ?         the "reference table" which contains the standard
WPS                      PTK pattern data. Its size is easy to calculate since
                         it consists of blocks of 4 bytes, knowing that there
                         are 'n' blocks ('n' is the highest value in the
                         pattern data).


      * Here's a quick description of these four bytes (like ptk ...)

         _____byte 1_____   byte2_    _____byte 3_____   byte4_
        /                 /        /                 /        /

      * NOTE: This period table is only valid for samples with a finetune
       set to 0 !. Promizer 1.8a saves HERE the fintuned values !. So,
       here follows the lists of the period tables for each tuning, well,
       not HERE :), but at the end of this file ... .
 


5222+WPS       4         Four empty bytes ... . Surely they have a very good
                         reason for beeing here, but, for now, it's beyond
                         my understanding :(.

 (next come the sample datas. We got two ways to find the starting address.)
 (we could follow step by step, as described here, but with a lot of       )

NOTE: It's more or less the same structure as PM18a. The 'only' great
     difference is the repacking of the Notes (no more like ptk). thus,
     all the crap (!) about the finetuned value in PM18a are no more in
     this version. Periods are replaced by relative note numbers. Far
     easier to handle when converting :).

$144E          ?         the "reference table" which contains the standard
+$164E                   PTK pattern data. Its size is easy to calculate since
                         it consists of blocks of 4 bytes, knowing that there
                         are 'n' blocks ('n' is the highest value in the
                         pattern data).
                         The other way to get the size is described upward.


      * Here's a quick description of these four bytes

       0000-0000  0000-0000  0000-0000  0000-0000

       |sample||   relative   \\/ effect  effect
       |      ||   note nbr unused       value
    unused   unused 

 
relative note number (PTK):

C-1 to B-1 : 856,808,762,720,678,640,604,570,538,508,480,453
C-2 to B-2 : 428,404,381,360,339,320,302,285,269,254,240,226
C-3 to B-3 : 214,202,190,180,170,160,151,143,135,127,120,113

becomes (PM20):

C-1 to B-1 : 02,04,06,08,0a,0c,0e,10,12,14,16,18
C-2 to B-2 : 1a,1c,1e,20,22,24,26,28,2a,2c,2e,30
C-3 to B-3 : 32,34,36,38,3a,3c,3e,40,42,44,46,48

 

?              4         Four empty bytes as in PM18a. Still not figured
                         out their meaning !.

$144E          ?         Sample datas.
+$164A


(NOTE: It seems ProWizard adds four empty bytes here when ripping ... .
The original packer, promizer 2.0, doesn't. ).

(105h)                   What's really stored is the number of
                         each track.

 dump exemple:

0110: 0F 00 10 00 11 00 12 00  - 13 00 14 00 15 00 0B 00   ................

 - pattern table size is 20 ($13+1)
 - first pattern tracks are $000b,$000c,$000d and $000e


?              1         ?!? ($00h)

?              ?         track datas. Each track is 256 bytes long
                         (64 rows * 4 bytes).


 So, each note takes 4 bytes and is stored that way :


   -Relative note Nbr    -Unused

          / /  Sample      effect   effect
  Unused----   number             parameter


relative note number (PTK):
