Hi Folks!
This is already my 5th collection I released!

Due to lack of time this collection was made in a hurry, and so
it contains this time "only" some requested unreleased (and maybe a bit old)
stuff.
I hope you like the ASCIIs`n ANSIs, if so (or if not) feel
free to tell me your opinion!

erhm... I really got nothing to say! Just a few greetz toooooo....

.......Mad,Qwert,Enigma,Gunman,Tomahawk,NoS!,Pizza,Phoenix,Mrsed,Dr.Acid,
       Hardball,L.O.g. ... and sorry if I forgot YOU! 8)
                             (I know there`s one missing.. but who??)

That`s all for now, now watch da shit :)
