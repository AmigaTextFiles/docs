<A NAME="INTRO" </A>
Introduction:
<P>
Amiga News Central was a WWW site which operated from early February 1997 to mid December 1997. As time went by visitors increased and the site expanded. Just before it's closure Amiga News Central was achieving record levels of visitors but unfortunately it had to be prematurely closed. 
<P>
Contained in this archive is all the news and articles which appeared on Amiga News Central during it's operation. I decided to upload this to Aminet because it contains comprehensive coverage of all the news and events that occured at a very important yet turbulent stage of the Amiga's existence. I hope you find something that interests you, maybe you will find this extra interesting if you are reading this in the distant future on your top of the line Amiga 8000 and you want to see what things were like back in 1997 ;-).

<A NAME="NOTE" </A>
Notes:
<P>
Compiling this has been nothing short of a logistical nightmare. Amiga News Central underwent 4 very major revisions which made tying this together all the more tougher. On top of that Amiga News Central largely relied on other news servies such as Amiga Flame, The Amiga Web Directory, Amiga.Org etc. to link to for press releases and more information. I couldn't include all this linked material and I cant guarantee that it is still online. However in most cases a sufficient summary is provided and press releases and additional material is available in a minority of cases.

<A NAME="USAGE" </A>
Usage:
<P>
Just load the file "index.html" into any WWW browser. This collection has been tested on the latest publicly available releases of AWeb, IBrowse and VoyagerNG. There shouldn't be any problems viewing this with any other modern PC/Mac/Unix browser as this is almost the exact version of the HTML that appeared on the old website.

<A NAME="BUGS" </A>
Bug Reports:
<P>
Direct all bug reports to NIL: or dev/null, whichever tickles your fancy :-). 
<P>
Seriously, this has been rushed together and resembles what is often termed a kludge. I'm sure there may be one or two minor bugs and I'm almost certain plenty of dead links exist but unless it is a critical error I wont even consider fixing it. I honestly do not have the time or energy. HTML is easy, do it yourself ;-).
<P>
For those persistent few who haven't been discouraged by the above look in the Contact section on how to reach me.
