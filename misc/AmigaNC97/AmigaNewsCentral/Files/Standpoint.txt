A standpoint on the criticism about the PowerUp-Program in German spoken
newsgroups.

Oberursel, 21./04.97: To our suprise, in German newsgroups, a discussion about
our PowerUp UpGrade-Program has arisen, in which partly massive criticism
about the products, e.g. the critisizing of the priceforming ocurred. This
criticism, that seems partially extreme un-businesslike, we have to reject.

Who reads our last years' official announcements can determine that we planned
reductions up to DM 300,-, that is certainly right. It should however not be
disregarded that a) the reductions and prices were nett prices not be used
to base anything on, and b) the reductions were still better than the
originally stated ones. The 200mhz version was announced in the PowerUp-
Program around Dm 1.550, just DM 1.800 including taxes. It is true that the
150 mhz is now somewhat more expensive than announced, and the price difference
between PowerUp-UpGrade and regular buy is small; that is because the Dollar
is around DM1.70 today, so, 12% higher as it was 4 months ago, and that the
product was upgraded  with a Ultra Wide-SCSI-Controller, that alone influences
the price around DM 250,-.

Further we point out that the price forming of the trade isn't controlled by
us. We offer our products only through dealers, that also render service,
thereby offering them a reasonable profit oppurtunity. When a few dealers
with a new product undertake an absurd priceforming, when they go far 
beneath the manufacturers recommended price, where the remaining margin of
profit is only just covering the cost, that is for the customers pleasurable,
but for the Amiga market in general not helpful.
It cannot be blamed on Phase5, when a dealer distances itself and offers at
the expense of the largest part of his profits products that contradict
Phase5's Upgrade-offer, that conforms with Phase5's customers.

As a leading manufacturer of Amiga hardware accessories we at Phase5 Digital
Products feel an obligation to the Amiga-market. In the interest of an
existing infra structure, as far as we are concerned, there is also a certain
responsibility towards the dealers, which we support by not doing direct
selling. The already signatory parts of the PowerUp-UpGrades along with
other products- which we cannot handle satisfactory for our customers-
guarantees for dealers a substantial turnover. Does it serve Amiga users,
when we avoid dealers so that the single customer can save a few Marks, thus
making more dealers leave the business on an averge term, as has happened in
the past? We think not. The Amiga market needs active support and a dealer-
basis that has an attitude of service, like advice, activity and a good
product range. Naturally, also the PowerUp-UpGrades have a price that is
shaped in such a way that both Phase5 Digital Products and dealers can reach a
neccassary profit.

Further, we must ask what the customers acspect of out products. A product
like the CyberVision64/3D was in the discussion circles- by the way mostly
very unobjective and mis-interpreted concerning the relation between the price
and the quality- critisized, because it does not fulfil the high end
acspectations of many people. Until now, around 80% of all icomming orders-
also before the UpGrade statement are orders for the 200mhz top modell of the
CyberStorm PPC. It seems that the best is sufficient for most Amiga users. We
have thought the same and have- instead of forcing the price again to be
around DM 200,-, to include more performance in the Cyberstorm PPC. But
behold, loud criticism arises about the so called too expensive cards and the
imaginary bad UpGrade conditions; there was even a thread with the title:
'Phase5 swindles Users...' Here exists a rude distortion of reality. We offer
a PPC604e-card at 200mhz at a price of DM 1699,- including save option and
Wide Ultra-SCSI-Controller; a 200 MHz-604e-card for Apple MacIntosh without
RAM option and Scsi costs around DM 1300,-, a PPC604e 200 MHz-Barebone-System
(also without Ram, disk and grafics card) around 4500 DM. A PPC604e-
processor, as used on the Cyberstorm PPC, offers depending on time about
50-80% more performance as a PPC603e-Processor, and must not shun comparison
with a Pentium Pro-Processor. He who thinks about this and recalculates will
understand, in the case of the mentioned newsgroup discussions, after the
partially at scoffing bounded statements, we can only answer: Think first,
flame later.

Phase5 Digital Products has with considerable five-numbered figures PowerUp
Developer Boards distributed to leading software developpers around the world
to support the development of software for PowerPC-Amiga-systems. We take on
a leading position and an engagement that in this form and this investment has
not been approximated by other businesses. Who is interested in the
continuing development of tecnology around the Amiga, must face the fact that
development costs money and that this money must be earned. Users, who
address us with criticism, should ask themself where their opinion of new
technology in hardware and software comes from and who should pay for this
progress. We at Phase5 Digital Products have taken up the challenge and
visitors of the actual events around the Amiga (MTT Trier, Amitech '97
Stockholm 25.-27.04. and World Of Amiga 97 London 17.-18.05.97) could and can
verify the performance of the comming PowerUp-Boards.
