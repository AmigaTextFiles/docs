<P>
Thankyou to everybody who has sent me supportive emails over the last
week, I was never aware how highly some people regarded Amiga News
Central. As to the future, I am currently considering a few ideas
which I will announce towards the end of next week when my current
real life commitments drastically reduce. Thankyou once again and
please keep visiting Amiga Central.<BR>

<P>
As some of you may already know it has become quite a struggle updating Amiga News Central. Unfortunately in future this will only get worse as I will have to channel more energy into things outside of Amiga Central. Because of this I'm suspending the updating of Amiga News Central indefinetly (this will not affect the rest of Amiga Central). In the meantime I will reasses Amiga News Central and explore other solutions (if there are any).<BR>
<BR>
Thankyou
