VULCAN SOFTWARE LATEST NEWS
<P>
<BR>
Vulcan Software Ltd is proud to announce the signing of The World
Foundry.
<P>
Vulcan has signed The World Foundry in it`s entirety and will be
publishing all World Foundry titles under the Vulcan Software banner,
beginning with Explorer2260 and Maim & Mangle.
<P>
The World Foundry was formed in September of this year from Digital
Anarchy Software, Deimos Design and Intuition Software with the
intention of pooling knowledge and resources to develop high
specification Amiga titles. Vulcan has been in talks with all the
members of The World Foundry for some time and are very excited about
the prospect of adding their talents and commitment to our organisation.
The World Foundry is a welcome addition to `The Vulcan Army' which
already consists of some 14 development teams and over 100 skilled
individuals.
<P>
The primary aim of The World Foundry is to develop high quality, high
specification games for the Amiga market which will take full advantage
of expanded Amigas and PPC equipped machines. This concentration on
higher spec Amigas falls in perfectly with Vulcan`s current drive to
push the Amiga forward. Vulcan and all it`s developers have made a
commitment to the Amiga and the Amiga Community, through our combined
efforts and enthusiasm we can help shape the future, a future which is
starting to look very bright indeed.
