PISSED SOFTWARE HOUSE
---------------------
The most recent beta tester version of Genetic Species has been leaked
onto the internet and is on illegal BBS boards.

We have invested allot of time, money and love into this project and it
saddens me that trusted testers don`t have any problems about handing it
out freely, which will of course ruin the surprise and sales of our
product.

If I had proof of whom was responsible I would sue there ass off or
otherwise pay them a visit and beat the shit out of them! Harsh I know
but I am so fed up with asswipes killing off this machine, if you knew
for one minute how hard some people try to keep it alive you might think
twice..then again perhaps not eh?

Anyway, as the files were recently tagged it can only be one of the
following 2 people, not blaming either of you as I have no proof of
which one but you know who you are!...

Paul (glum@vszbr.cz) 
Mike (influx@ici.net)

Rot in hell and oh, kind regards.
