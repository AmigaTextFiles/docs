Hello from clickBOOM!

For this edition of clickBOOM news, we have something quite different.

It's called "CLICKBOOM AMIGA WEB RING"!

"What is that?!", you may be asking yourselves. 
No, it's not a new game, as a matter of fact, it has very little to do
with games.

"clickBOOM Amiga web ring" is clickBOOM's non-profit project intended
to connect all (personal and commercial) Amiga web sites on Internet!

It's a brand new plan, and for it to ultimately succeed we need all
Amiga web site owners to join this magnificent way of making the Amiga
web presence stronger and more organized. 

If you have an Amiga-related web site, this absolutely FREE way of
promoting is a must. It will improve traffic on your site, while also
contributing to linking all Amiga web sites in the most efficient way.

We will outline the basic principles and benefits of Amiga web ring
here, but for the complete information and application form, please
visit http://www.clickboom.com .


HOW DOES IT WORK?
-----------------
Imagine for a moment that every Amiga web site on its front page has a
simple control panel, similar in looks to that of a CD player.

A visitor to any site in this "Amiga ring" can simply click on the
"next" button to jump to the next site in the ring. He can then
explore this new site, and at any time use the panel from this site to
go to the next one in the ring. 

Going from one site to another would allow a user to eventually visit
all Amiga web pages and after making a "full circle" he would be back
to the site where he started from. 

In addition to this, the ring allows a user to go in both
"directions", skip, see the next/previous five sites, or jump to a
random site in the ring. 

This might seem like a complicated thing, but once you see it on the
main page of clickboom.com or pxlcomputers.com , you will realize how
simple, yet effective it can be.


BENEFITS FOR WEB SURFERS 
------------------------
clickBOOM Amiga ring is a dream come true for any surfer looking for
Amiga information on the web: 

1. You have a simple uniform control panel with which you easily
"flow" from one Amiga site to another. This will discover for you
hidden Internet Amiga gems - and that's what surfing the Net is about.


2. You will be able to visit all Amiga related sites, no matter how
small or large - from a personal web site of an Amiga user in Alaska
to a manufacturer or retailer carrying Amiga products. 

3. You will never have to use search engines to look for Amiga sites
again. 

4. There are no dead links in Amiga ring, because as soon as any site
is removed from the web, it is also removed from the ring, and panels
on all sites are instantly "informed" not to use that site anymore. 


BENEFITS FOR OWNERS OF PERSONAL HOME PAGES 
------------------------------------------
1. Add traffic to your web site. ANY VISITOR to ANY SITE in the
clickBOOM Amiga ring is a potential visitor to your site, as well! 

2. Your site could be next to a high traffic web site like clickBOOM,
and any surfer to choose "next" from such a site would visit yours, as
well! 

3. No programming, or maintenance necessary. Once you add the HTML
code to your page, it automatically handles traffic from and to your
web site. 

4. It's absolutely, positively FREE! 


BENEFITS FOR COMMERCIAL WEB SITES 
---------------------------------
No matter how popular your site is, you can never have too many users
visiting it. Amiga web ring will increase traffic on your site,
guaranteed. 

1. ANY VISITOR to ANY SITE in Amiga ring is a potential visitor to
your web site! 

2. All surfers to use the ring are Amiga users looking for more 
information on the web, and isn't that what you have your web site
for? 

3. Commercial web sites can even use an alternative panel without a
clickBOOM logo, no questions asked. (contact us first to obtain such
panel) 

4. It's FREE! 

Thanks,
clickBOOM
