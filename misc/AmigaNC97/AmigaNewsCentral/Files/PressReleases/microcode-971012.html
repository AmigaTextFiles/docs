Since I am a PowerPC developer, I would like to make my official stand
about the current war between Phase-5 and Haage & Partner...
<P>
Personally, I don't think H&P should be setting any standards since they
do not manufacture PowerPC boards themselves.  I believe H&P have tried
to set standards because of the speed problem with Phase-5's ppc.library
(namely, AmigaDOS function calls).  For the record, let me state that
the speed problems with Phase-5's ppc.library has been fixed by us.
<P>
The normal overhead taken for an AmigaDOS function call from the PowerPC
processor using Phase-5's routines is 91.5ms (milliseconds).  The H&P
library requires approximately 6ms to do the same.
<P>
The simple patches we make to the Phase-5 ppc.library make AmigaDOS
function call overhead only .215ms, which is ~423 times faster than
Phase-5's original code and ~27 times faster than H&P's solution.  We
are writing a patcher program to fix the library problem.  I have tried
dozens of times to contact Phase-5 reguarding the fix to their library
and have gotten no response (this is my only complaint with Phase-5...
getting ahold of someone is a nightmare).
<P>
With our significant increase in speed, with no change in compatibility,
I see no reason to change from the standards set by Phase-5.  We are
writing a complete replacement exec.library written in native PPC code,
that will use Phase-5's ppc.library.  Given the speed enhancements we
have made, it should outperform H&P's Warp thingy.
<P>
I am not really for or against either side.  There is a standard, it
works, it is included with every board sold, and now it will work like
it is suppose to with our fixes.
<P>
