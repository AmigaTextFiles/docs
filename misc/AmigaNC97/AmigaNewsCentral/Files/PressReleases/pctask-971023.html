Subject: PC-Task 4.30 Released,  Show your support for PPC version
Date: 20 Oct 1997 20:45:19 +1000

PC-Task 4.30 has been released, Quasar's announcements should appear soon
(their posts seem to take forever to come through fromtheir ISP).  Check out
my and their web pages for info.  Demo is on aminet.

I have been working on PPC version for quite some time and would like to get
some sort of an idea of the level of interest in such a release.  Please
register your desire for PPC/PC-Task at the PowerUp page:-

<URL:<A HREF="http://hem.passagen.se/studiox/powerup/">http://hem.passagen.se/studiox/powerup/</A>>

Even if you have emailed Quasar or me in the past, please vote at the above
site to give us a very very rough idea of internet users interested.


If you have any problems with 4.30, please provide _full_ bug reports to
Quasar as per docs/manual.
