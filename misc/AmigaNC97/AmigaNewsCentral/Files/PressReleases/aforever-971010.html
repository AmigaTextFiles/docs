<P>The Amiga Forever emulator promised by <A HREF="http://www.cloanto.com">Cloanto</A> is nothing more than a souped up version of UAE with Amiga ROM's and bundled software packages. The latest public beta of WinUAE (UAE for Windows) has this version information:

<BR>The <A HREF="http://netrunner.com.br/dosuae/uaeboard/">Official UAE Discussion Board</A> currently has a thread "Commercial Amiga Emulator" and under this Brian King and Mathew Battilana both of <B>Cloanto</B> had this to say:
<BR><BR>
<PRE>
Not actually a new emulator. Just UAE. And UAE isn't *really* the
product, since it will still remain publically and freely available. The
product is more just the combination of UAE versions, AmigaOS versions,
and Kickstart ROM-images,(ROM+WB 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.04, 2.1 and
3.0 ,all with minor changes) plus some utilities and games and Cloanto
Software, all on one convenient CD. 
</PRE>
<BR>It is thought that once the Picasso96 driver and AHI drivers have been fully completed UAE will benefit from a massive speed improvement and make it useable on any decent PC system (P166+). And as previously stated Cloanto will be adding networking features and presumably serial and parallel port support making it an almost complete Amiga more than useable on a high end PC system.
