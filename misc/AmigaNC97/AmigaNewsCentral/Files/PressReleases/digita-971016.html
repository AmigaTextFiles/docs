Paul,
<P>
Thanks for your e-mail.
<P>
>What is the future of your Amiga product range?. I see<BR>
>you have announced the release of Wordworth 7 but most<BR>
>of your other products havent been upgraded in a long<BR>
>time. Have they been discontinued?<BR>
<P>
Wordworth is the only product we are currently developing on<BR>
the Amiga, we have not developed out other Amiga products<BR>
for some time, and have no plans to do so at the moment.<BR>
<P>
We are currently working on Wordworth 7 for the Amiga, which<BR>
we plan to release around March/April 1998.<BR>
<P>
Best regards,<BR>
Mark.<BR>
