Kara Collection

It took 10 years of hard work to create the superb art which is contained on
this CD-ROM. The Kara Collection includes all packages previously published
by Kara Computer Graphics for the Amiga, plus many more, in an exclusive and
professional edition reorganized and enhanced by Cloanto. This CD-ROM has
rapidly established itself as a "must have" tool for video professionals and
hobbyists alike.

This CD-ROM contains 80 ColorFonts (including effects like brick, glass,
chrome, chisel, etc.), 5 AnimFonts (handwriting, rotating characters, static
wipes, sparkles, etc.), hundreds of alternate color palettes, Starfields
(moving stars seen from different perspectives), Plaquegrounds (backgrounds
such as granite, marble, sand-stone, wood, etc.), and software for special
effects in pictures, animations, titling and presentations. All items
for solo or combined use. 

The Kara Collection also includes two software packages developed by Cloanto
to manage bitmapped fonts: ColorType for color fonts and the Personal Fonts
Maker for black and white fonts. Both have been acclaimed as the best in
their respective fields. 

To make AnimFonts really easy and enjoyable to use, we created an ARexx
program for Personal Paint, which renders any string of characters into
animated text.
As Kara says, "So long to the laborious task of placing individual letters...
This is the way AnimFonts were meant to be!!!"
*******

Personal Suite

This CD-ROM includes Personal Paint 6.4 and Personal Write 4.1 from Cloanto,
SBase 4 Personal (from Oxxi), Personal Fonts Maker 1 & 2 (Cloanto), 27
professional color fonts, Cloanto's DirDiff (file synchronization and
replication software) and PNG Toolkit, plus half a Gbyte of pictures,
animations, stereograms, stereogram animations, Amiga fonts, printer
downloadable fonts and texts.

The CD-ROM contains no public domain or shareware software. The commercial
titles include full manuals in AmigaGuide format (English and German, with
some titles also in French and Italian).

Famous Amiga artists like Jim Sachs participated with a selection of their
best Amiga art. Also included, a compilation of animations by Eric Schwartz,
for the first time in IFF ANIM format.

The CD-ROM is packaged in an elegant round metal box.
