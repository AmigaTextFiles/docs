 25.10.1997   PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX offers limited shareware discount


 PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX, namely Andreas R. Kleinert, may be known as
 the procucers of some well known Amiga programs, such as SuperView,
 the "ak Datatypes" and various other commercial and non-commercial
 software products and add-on software.

 Since we think, that Amiga - and some upcoming Amiga events in special -
 should gain some more audience and attention, we have decided to offer
 a shareware discount on our products limited until the end of the
 "Computer 97" show, taking place in Cologne from 14th-16th November.

 If your order is sent to us until 16th November (postal stamp's date)
 we will grant you the following discounts on our products:


 Discount range #1

 If you already are a registered user of one of our products (*)
 OR select more than one product from the list below, you get these for
 the discount price instead of the regular one (in brackets).

 Discount range #2
 -----------------
 As you know, you won't receive anything for registering akJFIF-Datatype
 and/or akPNG-Datatype except fame and (usually) some honorable mention
 in the documentation. Nevertheless, these fees have been decreased, too
 - since you may wish to add that value to your "Discount range #1" order:

      Product                                   regular     discount

      * Aminet:util/dtype/akJFIF43x.lha
        - <A HREF="http://www.amigaworld.com/support/akjfif/">http://www.amigaworld.com/support/akjfif/</A>

 ==========================================================================
 Please note (again), that all these offers are limited until 16th November
 1997, the last day of the "Computer 97" in Cologne (for detailed
 information, see <A HREF="http://www.computer97.de">http://www.computer97.de</A>)
 ==========================================================================

 And now to something completely different:


 SuperView-Library related products
 ----------------------------------

 Picture Manager:

 You may have noticed, that Picture Manager professional 4.1 (PMPro) in
 the english version now is being distributed by BlitterSoft in England.
 Since PMPro is making use of SuperView-Library, it may be interesting to
 note, that the price has been lowered, too. It's now 39.95 UKP for
 end-users (see <A HREF="http://blittersoft.wildnet.co.uk/pmpro.htm">http://blittersoft.wildnet.co.uk/pmpro.htm</A> or download
 the demo version from Aminet:biz/demo/pmpdemo.lha)

 Orders have to be addressed to BlitterSoft or your local dealer, please
 don't place any orders to PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX !


 Image Engineer:  (*)

 As the author, Simon Edwards, already stated on his homepage under
 <A HREF="http://yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au/~sbe/">http://yallara.cs.rmit.edu.au/~sbe/</A> , he has moved to the Netherlands,
 and the australian registration site can't accept any registrations
 any longer. Thus, any registration forms should be addressed to the
 european registration site, which in fact is PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX.

 Image Engineer BTW is an image processing program, that makes use
 of SuperView-Library (see AmiNet:gfx/edit/ImEngV3.41p1.lha and
 /ImEngV3.41p2.lha) for loading and saving graphic files, which is
 the reason, why any registered Image Engineer users are allowed to make
 use of the "Discount range #1" and "Discount range #2" offers, too.
 There's no discount on Image Engineer registrations, though
 (the european fee is 55 DM or equivalent in other currencies).


 Please address all orders to:

          PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX
          Andreas R. Kleinert
          Sandstrasse 1         Fax:   +49-271-22869
          D-57072 Siegen        eMail: <A HREF="mailto:Andreas_Kleinert@t-online.de">Andreas_Kleinert@t-online.de</A>
