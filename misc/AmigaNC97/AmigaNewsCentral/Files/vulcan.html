<B>1. When and why did you start Vulcan Software?</B>
<P>
Vulcan Software Ltd was formed in order to commercially publish a title
we had been working on in our spare time, this was Valhalla and The Lord
of Infinity. Vulcan was formed in January 1994 and Valhalla 1 was
published in the June. We enjoyed it so much we decided to stick
around:)
<P>
<B>2. Vulcan has been signing up development groups, how many groups have
you signed?, are there plans to sign more?</B>
<P>
At the last count we had in the region of 14 dedicated teams and around
100 individuals all working for the cause. Teams are signed on the
strength of their talent, commitment and the quality of their projects
and we are always looking for more to join us, it helps bring the future
closer.
<P>
<B>3. The Amiga has always been a source of amazing talent especially in
the games area, is this still so?</B>
<P>
My favourite topic:) yes this is very true despite the difficulties of the
market over these past few years. The quality of talent coming through
never ceases to amaze me. This talent combined with the fierce loyalty
that is charcteristic of the Amiga community as a whole will help shape
the future of the machine. Most developers love creating for creations
sake, they tend not to be terribly interested in market dynamics and
their commitment is an inspiration.
<P>
<B>4. In the past Vulcan software has been criticised for being created
in AMOS and made for relatively low spec Amiga's, why did you change
and begin developing for high end Amiga's?</B>
<P>
When Vulcan first started the majority of people owned an A500 with a
hard drive if you were lucky, many Amiga owners still have that set up.
The games that were released at the time were mostly `works on anything
you don't even need a computer' type games. The market dictated the
software and unfortunately the company that owned the hardware at that
time did not push their machines forward to any great extent. Still,
that's history, but the point is we developed for the machines that made
up the majority of the market. As for the programming language used,
well this is largely irrelevant, and depends on what you want to
achieve, it's true there are certain restrictions in a language like
Amos but then if you're not trying to create a fast paced 3d texture
mapped extravaganza then you'll probably be fine. Any criticsm we have
ever received from producing games in Amos will have fallen on deaf
ears, it doesn't take a great deal of brain power to realise that at the
end of the day the language is just a tool, it's what you do with it
that counts.
<P>
We began developing for high spec Amigas for a number of reasons. We
realised that if the Amiga had a future it would be with the die hard
portion of the market, the upgrade till you drop type people, because
they care about the Amiga enough to invest in it. We are happy to
provide them with the software that finally takes advantage of their
expensive set ups and we are proud to be creating software that stands
up to that which is released on other formats. We can be more
extravangant and imaginitive and through our efforts we are encouarging
other people to join in the fun and upgrade also. It is the only way
forward.
<P>
<B>5. Do you feel this decision will affect sales?</B>
<P>
Probably:)
<P>
<B>6. Vulcan software has grown enormously in a time when other
publishers on the Amiga have struggled to break even. How has this
been possible?</B>
<P>
I can't comment on why other companies are having difficulties as I have
no idea how they run their respective businesses, however Vulcan's
success is largely due to lot's of imagination, belief, commitment and a
great deal of damned hard work :).
<P>
We attract such large quantities of developers because of our strong
philiosiphies, we see ourselves as a rather large family built on
infinite respect for the talent and the machine, when we take on a new
team we are not just interested in the next six months, we aim to form
long term relationships because it is only through cooperation and
combined effort that we will all achieve our goals. Vulcan is not
interested in a quick return, we are somewhat more interested in
investing in the future.
<P>
<B>7. How are sales of games today, compared to when you first started
Vulcan?</B>
<P>
It would be dishonest and unrealistic to claim that all is as it was in
the good old days, the market has been in steady decline but we are
optimistic that this can and will change for the better over the coming
months.
<P>
<B>8. How many copies does a really good, well publicised Amiga game sell
today?</B>
<P>
Sorry, I can't go into specifics.
<P>
<B>9. Do you think piracy has a noticeable effect on sales?</B>
<P>
It is impossible to tell and a subject that is going nowhere, as long as
there are talented people creating things, there will be pirates
leeching off them. Luckily there are enough honest individuals out there
to make our efforts worthwhile.
<P>
<B>10. What interesting titles are in the works, when are we likely to see
them?</B>
<P>
Uropa2 is due for release in a couple of weeks and The Final Oddysey
shortly after. Towards the end of the year is the long awaited Genetic
Species. Early in 1998 will see the launch of Hell Pigs and Wasted
Dreams, followed by Hard Target, Almagica, Scions of a Forgotten World,
Desolate and Valhalla 4. As Vulcan has just signed the World Foundry we
will be publishing all their creations starting with Explorer and Maim
and Mangle although dates for these are not likely to be set for some
time.
<P>
<B>11. Will you be developing for the PowerUP PPC cards?</B>
<P>
Yes, we will be issuing a press release about this very soon.
<P>
<B>12. Have you been in contact with Amiga International?</B>
<P>
Yes, we have been speaking to them for some time.
<P>
<B>13. Are you confident of the Amiga's future?</B>
<P>
I'm a Vulcan, how can I not be :).
