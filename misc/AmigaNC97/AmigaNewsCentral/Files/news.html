<LI>Strong rumours abound that SAS/C, once the Amiga's premier C compiler and still highly regarded will soon support PowerUP.
<LI>On other PowerUP news, it appears the close relationship between <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de">Phase5</A> and <A HREF="http://www.haage-partner.com">Haage & Partner</A> on PPC development has been somewhat damaged. Apparently <A HREf="http://www.haage-partner.com">Haage & Partner</A> are threatening to make all code generated by Storm C++/PPC incompatible with that generated by GCC, which will be bundled with every PowerUP card. In response <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de">Phase5</A> have threatened to alter PowerUP cards making them incompatible with <A HREF="http://www.haage-partner.com">Haage & Partner</A> software.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.niweb.com/dnet/dnetPwic/amiflame.htm">Amiga Flame</A> reports that Alive MediaSoft are on the verge of releasing their first title, called <B>Blade</B>.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.nfinity.com/~amicom/amigaomaha.html">Amiga Users of the Heartland</A> usergroup recently had the pleasure of catching up with Amiga Inc's Darreck Lisle and conducted an interview with him. While there is too much to cover here topics covered in the interview include licensing, Java, OS updates plus much more. The full interview can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/at/auoh970924.html">Amiga Web Directory</A>.
<LI>While in other Amiga news it has recently been revealed that Amiga Inc are yet to start development on a future update to AmigaOS largely because no one as yet has been hired. Programmers in Germany who have extensive Amiga experience and were employed by either Amiga Technologies or Commodore have been told to "wait" when they approached Gateway. Earlier plans to have an OS update out by years end must now be in jeopardy. 
<LI>A little known fact is that <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de">Phase5</A> designers of the the Blizzard PPC accelerator cards for Amiga 1200 have added many new features to the board. Now there are 2 on board SIMM slots and most importantly there is a slot to take expansions. Currently Phase5 are planning on a graphics card called the <B>BVPPC</B> which will utilise Permidia graphics chips. No release date has been announced.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~pospisil/amiga.html">JP Media</A> known in Australia for their Amiga publications and range of imported CD-ROM's are planning on releasing an Amiga magazine in full glossy colour to be distributed throughout newsagents by years end. It will be titled <B>Australian Amiga Annual '98</B>. Also on the website is an unofficial statement from Gateway Australia in regards to the Amiga. While it appears that regional offices know less than knowledgeable Amiga users it was confirmed that a LOT of things are going on beind the scenes. The purchase of Amiga Technologies has also been met positively by Australian staff.

<LI>As well connected Amiga users know, <A HREF="http://www.gw2k.com">Gateway</A> have been in negotiations with a certain organisation with regards to the Amiga's future. An announcement on that is expected very soon. On the other hand we have <A HREF="http://www.next-generation.com">Next Generation</A>, an online magazine telling readers Gateway only purchased the Amiga for it's intellectual property and plan only on supporting the European market. That story can be found at <A HREF="http://www.next-generation.com/asking/081497.chtml">Next Generation</A>. While it seems improbable there is any truth behind this it is time Gateway started publically speaking about their plans or such innuendo and rumours will continue to prosper. Us Amiga users know it isn't true but the average Joe Public does not.
<LI>An 040 based PCI card will soon be released for UAE users. It should increase performance quite a bit but the all important custom chips of the Amiga will not be making an appearance. More information when it comes to hand.
<LI>I've just begun a massive overhaul of Amiga Central. The new Amiga Central isn't likely to appear for a while but it will be worth the wait.

The October issue will be the last. Even in these times of great optimism for the Amiga reality once again bites.
