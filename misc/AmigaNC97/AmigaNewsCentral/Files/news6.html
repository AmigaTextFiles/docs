<LI>The New Strait Times reports that Malaysia now has a new Amiga distributor, Innovations Light and Magic (ILM Malaysia). The company is planning on setting up an extensive dealer network to sell Amiga's to both die hard users and professionals alike. Initially ILM Malaysia will be selling an Amiga 1200 Amiga Magic pack with the Phase5 Blizzard 68030 accelerator card and Amiga 4000T machines in various configurations. By November ILM hope to be selling Amiga clones in particular the Micronik A1200 towers. Also mentioned in the article was that <B>AmigaOS 3.5</B> is due in December of this year though no further details are revealed.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html">The Amiga Web Directory</A> has reported further details on the mystery Chinese Amiga based set top box and the current Amiga situation in China. Though little further light is thrown on the matter what is known is that <A HREF="http://www.lpfc.com">Lotus Pacific</A> have full access and rights to the Amiga patents but only for use within selected parts of Asia. They have been developing new products which are not necessarily in co-ordination with either the now defunct Amiga Technologies or Amiga International. The situation can be traced back as far as 1995 when a small article appeared in Amiga Report confirming there are Chinese Amiga clones. Also an unknown person who has a long history with the Amiga did a few necessary OS modifications.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk">CU Amiga</A> have reported that <B>Champioship Manager 2</B>, the long awaited sequel to Championship Manager is going to be released anyday. Apparently Eidos Interactive want to get it completed as quickly as possibly so as they can work on future titles. Currently they have no future Amiga plans. Also reported are plans by ACT Electronics/Eyetech to produce a 66mhz 68060 accelerator amongst other things.

<LI>Rumours abound within the Australian Amiga scene of actually who IS the Australian distributor for <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">Amiga International</A>. <A HREF="http://www.megatron.com.au">Megatron</A>, who are best known for their use of the Amiga in industrial applications claim they have just accepted reappointment as the Australian distributor and have a letter signed by Petro T. dated June 17 confirming this. Yet there is persistent rumours stating otherwise which <A HREF="http://www.megatron.com.au">Megatron</A> put down to stemming from the dealer network who <I>"want us to spend $100,000's in advertising but they are not prepared to make any commitment to purchase stock!!"</I>. The scathing attack continued with Megatron stating <I>"If the dealers put their money where their mouths are the Amiga would return as a force.."</I>. I'll be sticking with this story as events unfold.
<LI>The full press release dictated by Basil Flinter of TAEN (The Amiga Education Network) at the recently held Australian Amiga Gathering is now online at the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/at/ai970701.html">Amiga Web Directory</A>.
<LI>A reminder that my <A HREF="feedback.html">survey form</A> is now online. I have had a very poor response so far, having only 1%-2% of users replying. It will only take a few moments of your time, and eventually lead to a better <B>AmigaCentral</B>. A big thanks to those who have responded.
<LI>Stay tuned for a couple of big interviews coming in the not too distant future.

<LI>In what can only be seen as a major shock, <B>Direct Software</B> has ceased trading reportedly due to financial difficulties which mainly stem from their failed "Power Amiga" project. Amiga Serious, the Nottingham based Direct Software partner will also cease trading. All is not lost though, a new company has been set up titled <B>Alive Media Soft</B> which has bought all the intellectual property from the old <B>Direct Software</B>. In short this means all projects will continue as is. Both <A HREF="http://www.d-n-a.net/users/dnetPwic/amidsc.htm">AmigaFlame</A> and <A HREF="http://www.pureamiga.co.uk/n00012.html">PureAmiga</A> cover the story.

After a short interruption of services <B>Amiga Central</B> is back. A few slight changes have been made including the discarding/delaying of a few concepts (the price of being too ambitious). These include:
<LI>Press releases will gradually move to be stored locally instead of relying on other news services. I have contacted most dealers/developers, if I have forgotten you please <A HREF="mailto:paulm@comcen.com.au">mail me</A>. 
<LI>A <A HREF="feedback.html">Survey Form</A> is now online, please take the time to fill it out. It will help me immeasurably in improving <B>Amiga Central</B>.
<LI>You may also have noticed the removal of the "Gateway/AT Buyout Watch" page, basically I decided it was in it's current form redundant though a link still exists to it from this page. A new page will appear soon.<BR><BR>
Thankyou for your patience.<BR><BR>
