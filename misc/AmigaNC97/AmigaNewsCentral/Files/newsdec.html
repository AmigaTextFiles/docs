<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Computer97 News</H2></FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.computer97.de">Computer97</A>, the largest annual Amiga exhibition held in Germany last month promised a lot but provided little in the way of hard facts for Amiga users. It was largely believed <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">Amiga International</A> would finally reveal detailed plans for the future of the Amiga but instead users were once again left in the dark. Petro T., president of Amiga International in his speech highlighted the importance of leveraging the Amiga technology and promised more would be revealed when possible. Petro's speech can be read at the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga/aminews/1997/971126-ai.html">Amiga Web Directory</A> while a comprehensive show report is available at <A HREF="http://www.amiga.org/news/1997/1124-computer97.html">Amiga.Org</A>.
<P>
While on another note it was reported in some quarters Petro T. was supporting the idea of further advancing the 68k processors instead of moving to a new architecture like the PPC. While it has received some support, notably from Carl Sassenrath, it has largely been dismissed as heresay and it is highly unlikely Motorola could be convinced to restart development on the 68k line.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Newtek Continue Support</H2></FONT><BR>
Amidst a lot of rumours and speculation <A HREF="http://www.newtek.com">Newtek</A> have reaffirmed their commitment to the Amiga. It was believed that due to the stoppage of development on the Amiga version of Lightwave and the suspension of Flyer development that Newtek were preparing to leave the Amiga scene. But according to Tim Jenison, co-founder of <A HREF="http://www.newtek.com">Newtek</A>, they have merely suspended development pending clarification of Gateway's plans for the Amiga. Currently they are in discussions with Amiga Inc. And despite reports to the contrary Newtek are very excited about <A HREF="http://www.playabletv.com">PlayableTV</A> and especially happy at <A HREF="http://www.quikpak.com">QuikPak</A> being granted a license to produce Amiga's. The full speech can be found at <A HREF="http://www.amiga.org/news/1997/1117-newtek.html">Amiga.Org</A>.
<P>
On another note, it has been rumoured <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de">Phase5</A> have done their bit to entice Newtek back into the fray by offering to make a special multiprocessor PPC board especially for use with Lightwave. The board would essentially be identical to current PPC boards except it will feature 4 or possibly more PPC processors to give optimum speed when rendering. It has even been reported that a very small amount of these boards have been produced with some being sent to Newtek. 
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com">Infoseek</A> have also recently covered <A HREF="http://ww.newtek.com">Newtek</A> and their future plans in which the Amiga is prominently positioned. The full text can be found at <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/Content?arn=ix.ACBJ127708&qt=Amiga&col=IX&kt=A&ak=news1">Infoseek</A>.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>New WWW Browser?</H2></FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://browserwatch.internet.com/">BrowserWatch</A> in it's <A HREF="http://browserwatch.internet.com/stats/stats.html">access stats</A> page shows the existence of a mysterious new web browser titled <B>ARexx Browser</B>, presumably written in ARexx for the Amiga. At the time of writing the browser has a mere 76 hits which would indicate it is used by very few people possibly being beta or alpha tested. Searches of the WWW and newsgroups show no reference to an "Arexx Browser" on any platform and there has been no reference to an "Arexx Browser" in any Amiga news item in the past 12 months. Research indicates a web browser written totally in ARexx is possible if used with certain extensions (such as MUIRexx) but unless compiled it would be very slow. More information when I receive it.

Welcome to the first edition of the restructured and revamped Amiga News Central. A big hello and a warm welcome to everybody reading this, hopefully with this new format I can increase readership and continue to provide comprehensive coverage of the Amiga. This, the first update covers all news that has appeared since the suspension of Amiga News Central back in early November. The SoapBox discussion forum will appear in next weeks update. Finally there may still be a few small problems viewing this site with IBrowse, they are being worked on and will hopefully be rectified soon.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>PowerUP News</H2></FONT><BR>
The <A HREF="http://hem.passagen.se/studiox/powerup/">PowerUP Homepage</A> reports that despite reports to the contrary, pOS from <A HREF="http://www.prodad.de">ProDAD</A> will be ported to PowerUP and should be available in Spring '98. Previously it was rumoured <A HREF="http://www.phase5.de">Phase5</A> were very keen on using pOS in the A/Box but there appears to have been a fallout between the two companies maybe caused by ProDAD wishing to make pOS multiplatform. This put the planned port in jeopardy. So far pOS is being ported to Amiga m68k, Intel, PowerUP and A/Box (???). Further information can be found at the <A HREF="http://hem.passagen.se/studiox/powerup/news_prodad_971203.html">PowerUP Homepage</A>.
<P>
In other PowerUP news, the next PPC CD-ROM update will have AGA drivers for CyberGraphics. The drivers will provide owners of AGA Amiga's with access to all 8bit CyberGFX modes and thus allow them to use <A HREF="http://www.vgr.com/lwshow">LWShow</A>, <A HREF="http://www.vgr.com/isis">Isis</A> and any other CyberGFX program.
<P>
At <A HREF="http://www.computer97.de">Computer97</A>, <A HREF="http://www.haage-partner.com">Haage & Partner</A> held a seminar about their PPC programming tools including StormC and StormASM. To highlight the speed of the compiler and the PPC cards they showed a Quake engine running on a PPC equipped Amiga which reportedly produced quite remarkable results. For all this and more PowerUP news please visit the <A HREF="http://hem.passagen.se/studiox/powerup/">PowerUP HomePage</A>.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>User Group Network Formed</H2></FONT><BR>
In keeping with the philosophy of supporting current Amiga users Amiga International in association with Amiga.Org have formed the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.org/usergroups">Official Amiga User Group Network</A>. A global registry of Amiga user groups will be kept so as news can be easily broadcast to all members. The cornerstone of this will be a regular e-magazine distributed to all members. Currently the UGN is in discussion with the ICOA as to the best way in which it can serve the Amiga community. The official press release can be found at <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/diary/news/971128-e.html">Amiga International</A>.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>New Clone Manufacturers</H2></FONT><BR>
It was announced at <A HREF="http://www.computer97.de">Computer97</A>  that <B>DCE Computer</B>, a long time supporter of the Amiga had been granted approval to produce Amiga based clones. Their first model, the <B>A5000</B> aims to be the new standard in high end Amiga's and is based around the A4000 motherboard.  It will initially be based around a 68030@50mhz. The machine will ship with a large IDE hard drive, CD-ROM and MPEG-1 support as standard, all in a mini tower case. And due out in Spring '98 is the <B>Power A6000</B> which will include many new features including an 060 processor. <A HREF="http://www.powerc.com">Power Computing</A> has been appointed world wide distributor. More information can be found at <A HREF="http://www.powerc.com/products/a5000.html">Power Computing</A>.
<P>
Not to be outdone, <A HREF="http://www.cix.co.uk/~index.html">Index Information</A> has announced the immediate availability of their first Amiga clone, the <B>Access</B>. The machine is built specifically for corporate applications and represents two years of research and development. The Access is a completely new design and is 2.3 times faster than a standard A1200. The full press release can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/amiga/aminews/1997/971126-index.html">Amiga Web Directory</A>.
<P>
In other licensing news, <A HREF="http://www.quikpak.com">Quikpak</A> has been granted a license to produce Amiga computers. <A HREF="http://www.newtek.com">Newtek</A> are reportedly very pleased at this. It is unknown if Quikpak will produce their previously designed portable Amiga, specialist A4000 machine with built in bridgeboard or the mysterious A1630 which they touted earlier in the year while bidding for Amiga Technologies.
<P>
To keep track of all the latest Amiga licensees <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">Amiga International</A> has created a page dedicated to listing current and prospective licensees, it can be found at <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de/diary/license/licensees.html">http://www.amiga.de/diary/license/licensees.html</A>

<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Myst finished!</H2></FONT><BR>
The long awaited Myst has finally been completed by <A HREF="http://www.clickboom.com">ClickBOOM</A> and should be available now. The game achieved record breaking sales on both the PC and Mac and ClickBOOM hope to do the same with the Amiga port. Interestingly Myst has just become available on the Amiga while the sequel to Myst, Riven has just appeared on the PC and Mac. This is the first Amiga port by ClickBOOM with many more planned (see Quake story). For information on the game and purchasing it please visit <A HREF="http://www.clickboom.com">ClickBOOM</A>.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Amiga Quake?</H2></FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.clickboom.com">ClickBOOM</A> have confirmed one of the Amiga's worst kept secrets, that they are negotiating with ID Software with the hope of officially releasing an Amiga version of Quake. Earlier in the year an illegitimate version appeared from Digital Corruption compiled from stolen source code. While the game required mammoth resources it confirmed the Amiga can handle such games. It is thought a "proper" fully Amiga-ized port could see the game running many times faster. ClickBOOM hope to announce the outcome of discussions very soon (positive or negative).
<P>
<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Championship Manager 3</H2></FONT><BR>
A rather poor port of Championship Manager 2 has just been released for the Amiga but development has already begun on Championship Manager 3, for the PC. The development team responsible for both games are keen on an Amiga port but do not have the resources to port the game themselves. It is thought that the game could be licensed to an Amiga developer to port properly. An online survey is now online <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Strasse/3660/">here</A> to gauge support for such a game. If you are interested in CM3 for the Amiga, please take the time to fill it in.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Foundation Demo out!</H2></FONT><BR>
Another long awaited Amiga game is nearing release. This time <A HREF="http://www.sadeness.demon.co.uk/foundation.html">Foundation</A> from Paul Burkey and <A HREF="http://www.sadeness.co.uk">Sadeness Software</A> is on the verge of being released. The game which is best described as a mixture between the Settlers, Megalomania, Warcraft II and Populous is set to ignite the Amiga games scene. A demo highlighting the high quality of the game is available from both <A HREF="http://www.aminet.org">Aminet</A> and Foundation's <A HREF="http://www.sadeness.demon.co.uk/foundation.html">web site</A>. Pre orders are currently being taken. A few months back I did an interview with Paul Burkey creator of Foundation in which he candidly spoke about the game and the future, the interview can be found <A HREF="../Features/foundation.html">here</A>.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE"><H2>Amiga in Wired</H2></FONT><BR>
The Amiga is continuing to make headlines in the mainstream media. This time, <A HREF="http://www.wired.com">Wired</A> magazine has covered the Amiga's resurgence in an article titled "Commodore Amiga computer set for comeback". The article appeared in Wired 5.12, December 1997 on page 56 while the full text of the article can be found at <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/971203/wired/stories/amiga_1.html">Yahoo</A>.
