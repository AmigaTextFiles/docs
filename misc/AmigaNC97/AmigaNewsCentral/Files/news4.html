<LI>Due to various commitments, time contraints and situations occuring that are beyond my control I will be unable to update AmigaNews Central for approximately one week. There may also be a delay in updating the various mirrors. I apologise for any inconvienence.
<LI>I will be attending the <B>Australian Amiga Gathering 1997</B> probably as the ICOA representative. What does this mean to you?, well when I return there will be a comprehensive show report with (hopefully) photos. There will also be a slight adjustment to AmigaNews Central and a few other sections on <B>AmigaCental</B> will either be updated or discarded. 
<LI>See you all in a week!.

You may recall earlier reports on <B>Amiga Central</B> of a mystery low cost accelerator set to break the sound barrier speed wise on Amiga, well this is it. Expected to be priced between 130UKP and 150UKP the accelerator is not a processor upgrade but instead uses an as yet unknown technique to seriously overclock 68k processors to speeds above 100mhz. Whether this is safe or not is anyones guess ;/.

<LI>The World Of Amiga Show in the UK has just finished and reports are beginning to filter through. The <A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/aminew.html">Amiga Web Directory</A> has the most comprehensive list at the moment. Various interesting rumours to come out of the show include <B>TFX</B> appearing on a <A HREF="http://www.cu-amiga.co.uk">CU Amiga</A> coverdisk/CD and a strong rumour is circulating that we may see a new release of <B>AmigaOS</B> by Christmas 97. Also mentioned is that <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">Amiga International</A> is yet to decide upon a future processor for the Amiga, although the PPC is expected to be chosen. Direct Software were also on hand and very open about their <B>Power Amiga</B>, unfortunately no hardware was on show but a video detailing the kind of performance expected was. From all reports it was stunning.
<LI>Swedish Amiga users may soon have their own television program. The show which will be available to a potential audience of 1.2 million people (Swedan's total population is 8.8 million) is still in design stage. At the moment the shows producers are appealing for sponsors, more information can be found at <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~HighLightdesign/AmigaTV.html">http://members.tripod.com/~HighLightdesign/AmigaTV.html</A>.
