<H1>When the Music's over....</H1>
<P>
It pains me to write this but it is all over, Amiga News Central is gone for good. 
<P>
I had hoped to continue in the new weekly format (and work had started on the latest update and the further relaunching of ANC) before I had a reality check. I could have continued, half heartedly with a poor news service but I don't want to cheapen what Amiga News Central once represented and more importantly waste your time.
<P>
I feel I owe you the reasons behind what has just happened, they are reasons not excuses. Basically I thought I could continue with the weekly format, thus taking off the workload and pressure from a daily operation but unfortunately all it did was create many times more pressure towards the deadline. I underestimated what the future would hold for me, work and study wise. I could have continued on for a few more weeks albeit in a crippled form but that would just have been an excercise in futility, I'm a firm believer of being open, direct and upfront. 
<P>
The new year promises to be challenging and at times very difficult. My future is at stake and I would have been kidding myself and wasting a lot of money if I continued with Amiga News Central and not centred all my energies onto my future. 
<P>
I realise I have let a lot of people down and in some cases broken commitments I had previously agreed to. But as I said they are reasons not excuses and I wont hide from your criticisms. After the death and resurrection of Amiga News Central I think it would be fair to say I have lost a lot of credibility. My sole intention in all this was to help forward the Amiga. Helping in my own little way meant a lot to me personally and some of your emails really touched and flattered me, so much so that I deluded myself into believing I could continue. To all those who have loyally stuck by Amiga News Central, I sincerely thank you for providing me with many moments of joy and happiness. And to those who I have been personally involved with through Amiga News Central, again thankyou for your support and my deepest apologies for letting you down.
<P>
The rest of Amiga Central will continue on. The Amiga's future is uncharacteristically bright and I will always be around, if only as an interested observer to one day witness it's revival.
<P>
In my final words I will leave you with a passage from Harlan Ellison which has often been duplicated since it's appearance on the Deathbed Vigil but I feel they summarise every Amigan's feelings about the Amiga:
<P>
<I>"Perfection.  Excellence.  What a passionate lover.<BR>  
But once having tasted the lips of excellence,<BR> 
once having given oneself to its perfection,<BR> 
how dreary and burdensome and filled with anomie are the<BR> 
remainder of one's waking hours trapped in the shackled<BR>
lock-step of the merely ordinary, the barely acceptable,<BR> 
the just okay and not one stroke better."<BR>
</I><BR>
-Harlan Ellison
<P>
Thanks for the memories and long live the Amiga!
<P>
Kind Regards,<BR>
