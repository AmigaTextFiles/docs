<CENTER><H2>Power Amiga Here Soon!</CENTER></H2>
<P>As the World Of Amiga Show 1997 approaches, rumours are persisting as to the existence of a new "Power Amiga" to be released at the show. Direct Software are behind the machine and have adverstised it in the May issue of <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/auimag/">Amiga User International</A>.The advertisement lists the specs as being:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>68060 processor @ 50mhz 
<LI>22mb RAM
<LI>64-bit 3D Graphics Card
<LI>16-bit 8-channel stereo sound 
<LI>1gb Hard Drive
<LI>8x CD-Rom
<LI>Multisync Monitor                                                        
<LI>Kickstart/Workbench 3.1
<LI>5 Zorro2, 5 PCI and 1 video slot (unconfirmed)
</ul><BR>
<P>The most amazing thing is the price, listed as slightly over the expected 1000UKP at 1499UKP. Other details are scant except that it is fully compatible with current Amiga software and able to display a screen resolution of 1280x1024 in 24 bit (!!). For our UK surfers Direct Software provide an order line, call to reserve yours on 01623 455398. Besides that Direct Software say not to discard your current Amiga as they can upgrade it to a Power Amiga spec regardless of your current setup.<BR>
<BR><CENTER><H2>More Aplha Amiga Rumours</CENTER></H2>
<P>More information have become available regarding the possibility of an AmigaOS port to the DEC Alpha processor. Apparently DEC started a port of AmigaOS in C= times but C= refused to license the OS to them. Portions of the attempted port have apparently survived including graphics.library and other important OS components. For more info see the excellent <A HREF="http://users.compassworks.com/~squid/amiga/amiga_articles.html">Squid's Amiga Page and Rumour Mill</A><BR>
<BR><CENTER><H2>Australian Amiga Show Date & Venue Finalised</CENTER></H2>
<P>A date and venue has been announced for the upcoming Australian Amiga Gathering. It will take place on the weekend of the 28th and 29th of June at the Sydney Showgrounds in the Exhibition Village. For our interstate or overseas readers it is situated only a few minutes from Sydney and is about a 10-15 minute walk from Central Train Station. No exhibitors have been announced as yet, most local Amiga dealers and our Amiga distributor <A HREF="http://www.megatron.com.au">Megatron</A> are expected to appear. Hopefully some overseas developers will also appear.<P>This is the first Amiga only show in Australia since World Of Commodore 1993 so please support it!. To subscribe to the mailing list send a mail to <A HREF="mailto:mother@pnc.com.au">mother@pnc.com.au</A> with the subject "Expo-update" (minus the quotations).

<LI>Photogenics will survive the collapse of <A HREF="http://www.almathera.co.uk">Almathera</A> and be picked up by another prominent Amiga developer. Rumours indicate the company has been a prominent Amiga developer for many years and is UK based.  
<LI>The release of <A HREF="http://www.newtek.com/news/pr_970407-1.html">Lightwave 5.5</A> has been announced by <A HREF="http://www.newtek.com">Newtek</A> this week. The new version is a significant upgrade from the previous v5.0 and will sport many new and powerful features. No mention of an Amiga version was made. NewTek's support for the Amiga has been waning, clearly indicated by the very late appearing and disappointing Lightwave 5.0 port, have Newtek dumped us?. 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.asimware.com">Asimware Innovations Inc.</A> have announced updates to both MasterISO, a CD mastering program and the premier Amiga CDFS AsimCDFS. Both updates are free, for more info visit the <A HREF="http://www.asimware.com">Asimware Homepage</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.serv.net/~cshock/main.html">CultureShock Multimedia</A> have announced the release of a new HTML editor promising features unseen on the Amiga before. No HTML knowledge is necessary and many Wizards will be included. Order before July 1997 and pay the special introductory price of $US49.95 instead of the RRP of $US69.95. For more info and system specs visit the CultureShock homepage.
<LI>The buyout issue of Amiga Report has been delayed until the Gateway bid is approved by the German courts.

<CENTER><H2>Commercial Quake?</H2></CENTER>
<P>Recently <A HREF="http://home.ican.net/~clkboom/">ClickBOOM</A> began mailing webmasters of pages who contained downloadable versions of Quake for Amiga stating that the demo is illegal and Amiga Quake would soon be a commercial product. Have ClickBOOM picked up another major title for the Amiga?, it appears to be the only reason for their heavy handed approach. It is unknown if the original authors of Amiga Quake who are members of the cracking group Digital Corruption will continue development of their version. So far only <A HREF="mailto:suicyde@melb.alexia.net.au">Randall Lasini</A> (<A HREF="http://www.eck.net.au/~suicyde/">http://www.eck.net.au/~suicyde/</A>) has gone on record as being told by ClickBOOM to remove Quake by posting a message in <A HREF="news:aus.computers.amiga">aus.computers.amiga</A> including ClickBOOM's reply which is as follows:<BR><BR>
<TT>
Hello,<BR>
<BR>
I am the Producer for PXL computers and clickBOOM, developers and
publishers of Capital Punishment and Myst.
<BR>
I have been advised that your web site contains the demo of
AmigaQuake. I would strongly urge you to remove it immediatelly -
that demo is illegal, as Amiga Quake will become a commercial product.
<BR>
Your propt attention to this matter would be appreciated.
<BR><BR>
Regards,
<BR>
Alexander Petrovic
PXL/clickBOOM Producer
