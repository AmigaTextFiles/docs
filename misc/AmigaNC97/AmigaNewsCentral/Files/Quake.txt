  Hello, this is SHeN_LoNG the leader of DC97'

  I have put out this txt because it is due time the rumors and the cloud of
smoke was lifted from a project DC97' has worked on called 'AmiQUAKE'...

  Yes, we did have a functional port of QUAKE done on the Amiga.  Yes we did
use source code the was not obtained legally.  We wernt the ones to actually
steal the code from crack.com blame some lamer PC group for that blunder, BUT
yes we did use what can be called 'stolen source code'...

  NOW TO PUT AN END TO EVERY RUMOR ABOUT AMIQUAKE COMMING FROM 
 THE WEBPAGES AND NEWGROUPS.

-The last version of AmiQUAKE EVER was v.32 which was for the testers only
and did get 'leaked' out by a tester.

-The rumors about v.32+ like v.47/.49/.50 are false they dont exsist no
matter how bad you would like them to.

-There IS NOT a v.50 in 'internal testing' at all, this version does not 
exsist.

-The versions of AmiQUAKE dubbed v.47/v.49/.50 that started to do there
rounds on the net are just v.32 with a bullshit doc file and doctored up to
show a new version, ANYTHING HIGHER THEN v.32 IS SHIT, it doesnt exsist.

-YES I.D. Software at one time got in touch with DC97' 

-YES I.D. Software gives a shit about our port, they give a VERY BIG SHIT.

-YES AmiQUAKE is now dead, R.I.P., Project terminated.  Its gone, please 
belive this, there will be no more of the port comming from DC97' at all,
it is dead.

-NO we have not and will not give out the Amiga sources to anyone at all.

-NOBODY is picking up from our port or our source code, NO FURTHER 
DEVELOPMENT of AmiQUAKE!

  I hope this cleared the air about AmiQUAKE and squashed alot of the rumors
and crap about AmiQUAKE floating around.

-WHY DEAD?  The lead coder ^MAX^ has a new girlfriend (He found a damned 
hott one at that =)  and he also is enrolled full time at a University, plus
he also has a job, which equals no more time for coding or porting.  To put it
another way, "It was fun while it lasted" and a big THANX for the fun goes out
to ^MAX^.
