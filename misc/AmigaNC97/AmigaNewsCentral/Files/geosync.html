<BR><BR>
<B>1. What exactly is Geosync Media?</B><BR>
<BR>
GeoSync is now a software company, and when I get the capital, it will expand into
film production and multimedia. 
<BR><BR>
<B>2. What motivated you to start GeoSync?</B><BR>
<BR>
I realised the potential of the Internet as a distribution tool, and
thought 'hey now here`s a way for people to check out my work'.  I had
some software that needed evaluation and my local PD library wanted cash
from me to port it to the 'Net.  I didn`t have the cash, and the guy
there wanted to evaluate it(the software), himself before he uploaded
(he put his name to it or something).  Anyway, it was too much control
and not enough publicity, so I chose to go it alone.  That was in 1995. 
I went to the U.K. with software in-hand with the hopes to find a
software house to develop my games into commercial releases.  When I got
there I realised that there was this control element again, and that the
final product would probably bear no resemblance to my original work.
I came back to OZ and worked for a while to build the equipment
infrastructure I needed.  Now my homepage is on the 'Net and things are
looking up!.<BR><BR> 
<B>3. List the members of Geosync and a little bio on each.</B>
<BR><BR>
Well GeoSync Media is basically me with the help of others. At the
moment I have had a lot of help from people on the `net and this has
been great.  The Internet has become my 'office' and since I released
the shareware version of "Star Fighter" I have been inundated (in a good
way) with technical assistance and suggested improvements.
Technically I have a 'cyber' staff of about 15 members now, but I really
need dedicated support for future projects.  
As for my bio,  I was born in Wandsworth, England 1970. I have a
Bachelor of Arts (Media), I`ve been programming since I was 13.  The
type of stuff I developed was based on the fact that I never had the
money for expensive computers. So I made games from other systems that
would work on mine.  It was a good way to learn. "Star Fighter
D'Yammen's Reign" is based on "X-Wing" for the IBM as an example.  
Since I started "Star Fighter..." I have been pushing the Amiga to it`s
limits with some totally original software(no details as yet sorry). 
<BR><BR>
<B>4. Where is geosync based?</B>
<BR><BR>
GeoSync Media`s homepage resides on a server in Sydney at Ozemail, but I
live in Perth, Westerm Australia. <A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geosync">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~geosync</A>.
<BR><BR>
<B>5. Where did the name Geosync come from?</B>
<BR><BR> 
It`s short for geosynchronous media transfer, the process by which my
games are delivered to the public.  Of course geosync satellites aren`t
the only equipment that deliver my software.  As a bit of historical
trivia the sci-fi novellist and futurist designer Arthur C. Clarke
discovered the Clarke`s Ring, a particular distance from Earth where all
satellites orbited the Earth at the same speed as the rotation of the
planet. <BR><BR> 

<B>6. Tell us a bit about your debut release StarFighter.</B>
<BR><BR> 
"Star Fighter D'Yammen's Reign" shareware release vs 1.e is at the
beta-test stage.  It's online so that anyone around the world with an
Amiga on the net can download it and try it.  I ask users to email and
tell me about problems they have had, and then I modify it.  "Star
Fighter..." is now in its 3rd revision and most people can run it. 
I got to a point where I had programmed "Star Fighter D'Yammen`s Reign"
to death!  I had no spring-board of opinions and didn`t know whether it
was worth finishing the game.  So I put it on the 'net as shareware (it
is cut-down, there are heaps of other options that are locked out at the
moment) to get it to a point where it would work on any computer,
bug-free.  
Thanks to the support I have, it has progressed in leaps and bounds and
now I want to finish it, because people are starting to like it
<BR><BR>
<B>7. List some of your planned future releases and there expected release
dates.</B><BR><BR>
 
All games I develop will appear on my homepage when I am ready for them to be beta-tested.  There`s such a wealth of information and talent out there, you can`t go wrong.<BR><BR>

"H.A.R.D.Corps" (a Command & Conquer clone, but for the Amiga) is coming up soon. In a week or so I will have released the basic combat model on the 'net.  I suspect this will be completed by Christmas 1997.<BR><BR>

"Star Fighter D`Yammen`s Reign" is in the final stage of development.  I am working on the cut-scenes at the moment, and it should be ready by July 1997.<BR><BR>

"Fire Mission 3d", an update of my aforementioned project will appear about September 1997.  It will feature 3d rendered graphics, disk-streamed animations & sound, a 'jumble-mode' where, much like Diablo, the game is randomized for each new game, and only the game characters themselves know the true layouts of buildings, spaceships
etc.  But I don`t want to spoil it.  Think Diablo, Doom, Robotron & RebelAssault and you have "Fire Mission 3d".
<BR><BR>
<B>8. Are you dedicated to producing Amiga games in future?</B>
<BR><BR>
Most definitely YES!  I can see many great things for the future of the
Amiga and I want to be known as someone who never gave up on it.  In
1996 I was under the impression the amiga was dying.  But since I`ve
been on the 'Net I have just been encouraged to do more.  Although I get
the feeling that the Amiga only exists in CyberSpace. Which is okay, but
they need to advertise more.
<BR><BR>
<B>9. Do you plan on supporting Phase5's PowerUP PPC standard?</B>
<BR><BR>
Definitely yes.  I plan on buying one of their machines when available. 
It`s a good thing for the Amiga, and with across-the-board compatibility
with Mac`s and IBM`s I believe the Amiga will dominate as the 'ultimate
multimedia workstation'.  I think this is the logical future of the
Amiga.  Let`s IBM have the business apps, and the Mac, well, just fix
those OS bugs and the computer won`t crash as much :)
<BR><BR> 
<B>10. Do you plan on making any of your future titles commercial? / Have you
been contacted by any publishers?</B><BR><BR>

I have had some response from publishers.  I have recently increased my
presence with some well know publishers, but I can`t go into details.  
"Star Fighter..." is planned for July 1997 and will feature an
interactive storyline, and about 50 missions, arcade mode and then later
a mission editor.  This will be my first commercial release.  All my
titles will become commercial, not shareware.  Shareware is killing the
Amiga.<BR><BR>

<B>11. Do you plan on supporting any other platforms in future?</B><BR><BR>

Yes, as a matter of fact I`m working on a cross-platform edutainment
piece for kids, and I`m in discussion with an Australian distributer. 
This will be available first on the Amiga and then on the IBM.  I am
also working on some link-up games which will allow you to connect and
IBM to and Amiga across the 'Net or via Serial link.  Air Warrior does
this, but I have some more interesting games in mind than this.  
"Xwing Vs TieFighter Vs Star Fighter" is a clue as to the future of my
cross-platform work.
Expect to see an arcade version ( the cabinet type ) of "Star
Fighter..." in 1998.  I mean look at Virtual Reality games like
Pterydactyl Nightmare.  The Amiga can do it.  I get a kick every time I
see one of those machines boot up with a Workbench screen :o)
<BR><BR>
<B>12. What kind of Amigas do you use in a) development and b) personal use.</B><BR><BR>
 
I develop my software on an A1200, with a tiny harddrive, 2mb Chip, 4mb
Fast.  I do sound and graphic manipulation with Adobe Photoshop (IBM),
CoolEdit(IBM), DeluxePaint(Amiga), Real3d (Amiga), Perfect Sound(Amiga).
I create music using Sequencer1(Amiga), a Roland U110 sound module, MIDI
keyboard, and Roland VP700 (voice processor).
The final upload uses Netscape(browser), GNNPress (Web Publishing) and
WS_FTP (FTP proggy) to get it on my homepage.
