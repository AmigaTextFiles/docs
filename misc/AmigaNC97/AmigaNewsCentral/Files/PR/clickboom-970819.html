MYST is not available yet, but that won't stop YOU from winning 
a copy of it right now. All you have to do is visit our web site at
www.clickboom.com, and join our weekly MYST hunt. A copy of the game
is hidden somewhere on our site, and you have to find it. The "deeper"

winning. So, go hunting!

September 1st.  It's going, going....gone soon.  This purchase will
automatically make you a CP registered user and entitle you to the 20%
discount, as described below.

Capital Punishment in all modes other than the Epic allows you to
choose only the scenes you reached to while playing in the Epic - life
is hard and cruel...but no more. 
1. Download CP level cheat from our web site 
2. Copy it over the existing menu.code file on your hard drive And 
    from now on you can choose among 6 scenes when playing 
    tournament, league, multiplayer and any other mode.

(4) INTERNET SHOPPING MALL
We opened the mall due to popular demand from Amiga users who wanted a
convenient and accessible way to buy Amiga titles.  The response has
been great, and we would like to thank everyone for their support.  To
show our appreciation we have many prize giveaways and special
discounts for you:

a) We promised to Capital Punishment registered users better deals 
   on Amiga games, and we are keeping our promise with a 20% discount

   Punishment and you too will immediately be entitled to receive a
   20% discount on any other game.

b) In recognition of CUCUG efforts for the Amiga community, all of its
   registered members are entitled to a 10% discount on all products
