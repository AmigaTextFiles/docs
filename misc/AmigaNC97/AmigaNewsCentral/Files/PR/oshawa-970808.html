<CENTER><H3>August 1997 Update & Specials!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
</CENTER></H3>
- The introduction of Epson Stylus Colour Inkjets last month went amazingly
well!  Many of you are now printing out documents in photo-quality colour.  As
a result, we will now be carrying this amazing line of printers on a regular
basis.

- Motorola external modems are coming.  We are finishing working out some
details with our supplier & Motorola... watch your mailbox for more details
real soon!

- Back to school is our focus this month.  Buying new Amiga computer supplies
has never been so affordable!  ;-)

- Online ordering from our web site is in the works as we speak.

- The Netscape problem with our website will be gone shortly.  Thanks to David
Loader for helping us squash that bug.

- Our new Fall 1997 catalogue is in the planning stages.  If there are any
products that you think we should be carrying, please e-mail us at
mjacula@idirect.com and tell us about them!

- It's contest time again!  This time we're giving away a free copy of
TurboPrint v5.02 (a $105.00 value!).  All orders placed totalling over $300.00
(excluding taxes & delivery) will have their names dropped into a hat.  One
lucky winner will win once they have answered this skill testing question:  If
you add up all of the numbers (excluding area code) in Oshawa Amiga's phone
number, what number do you get?  (Easy eh?)  <G>
