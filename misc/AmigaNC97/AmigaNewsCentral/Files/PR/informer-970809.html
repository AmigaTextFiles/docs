<BR>
Holy cow! Issue 9 of The Amiga Informer Magazine is now at the printers
and will be available by the end of August. It's our biggest issue yet and
we've packed all 48 pages with information that will help every Amigan stay
connected and informed.
<P>
Issue 9 has lots of news. We don't just reprint  internet press releases,
but investigate the stories and give you a commentary voice. You'll
find our lead story covers Amiga licencing and the many new clones
becoming available. We have an exclusive discussion with Petro
Tyschtschenko and a synapsis of what it all might mean. There's also an
inside story on the Lotus Pacific licencing flap with Gateway 2000. In
addition, we keep you up to date on the success of the Industry Council of
the Open Amiga and the newly elected steering committee that is working
with Gateway. Finishing up the news is an on-hand accounting of the new
Siamese System, an in-depth report on Aurora Development, the open
house at National Amiga and a whole bunch of informative news bytes.
<P>
Our regular writers once again bring you their insightful columns. Brad
Webb goes in-depth on using WBStartup+ to get your system in shape.
Davis Sprague guides you through "Talk", the real-time terminal to terminal
protocol. Davis also cuts through the confusion of the many available
compression routines and provides a useful cheat sheet on how to make
them all work. Oleg Moskalensky, aka Dr. Amiga, answers several vexing
questions in his new Question and Answer column that will appear in every
future issue.
<P>
We've really gone full speed ahead with the reviews too. You'll find ten
reviews, five summaries and one preview in this issue, including a new
Game Zone section. Among the products reviewed are PC Task v4.20,
Pagemonster, Electrics, MRBackup and Nemac IV: The Directors Cut. Our
reviews are done by independent free-lance writers who evaluate and
grade products without interference from The Informer's editors, so you get
fair appraisals of all tested products.
<P>
In addition to our numerous product announcements, you'll find a
company profile of DKB, information about ShadowWorks Software,
several handy tips, and numerous listings of dealers, user groups and
dynamite Amiga web sites. In the Action section, you'll find contact
information on Amiga International and NewTek and how you can contact
them and help the Amiga cause. To top it all off, you can find great deals
on used Amiga products in our Marketplace section.
<P>
There are several ways you can get your hands on Issue 9 of The Amiga
Informer. You can purchase it at the cover price from one of our many
retailers, hope to get lucky and receive an issue when you buy a product
from one of our few distributors, or you can subscribe. If you choose the
later, you can call toll free 1-888-88-AMIGA to subscribe by Visa or
Mastercard. If you prefer, you can fill out the on-line, no-risk no-obligation
"bill me" form at www.amigainformer.com/subscribe.cgi and we'll send you
an issue.
<P>
Either way, you'll find The Informer to be a great source of useful
information and insights. We've been producing issues for over 18 months
and plan to continue doing so well into the future. I hope you'll give us a try.
<P>
Thanks for your support,
