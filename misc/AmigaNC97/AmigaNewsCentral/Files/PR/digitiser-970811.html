> > Digitizer?
> > He said that 68% of Amiga owners have never had a girl friend and then
> > claimed that the information came from CU and AF. I do not remember
> > being asked that question.
> > Oh and Digitizer called as Amiga users sad little Nerds that only buy
> > shareware games because that's what only gets released.
> > 

> Digitizer have gone too far. They have insulted amiga owners for the
> last time. It's time we took a stand against them.
> In urge everyone to pass this letter on to any amiga owners they know.
> If everyone carries out these instructions we will be heard.
