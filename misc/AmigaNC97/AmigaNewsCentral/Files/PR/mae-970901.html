Originally from : Dave Pearce <dpearce@infinet.com><BR>
Subject ........: *UPDATE* '97 Midwest Ami Expo<BR>
<P>
We've just had a few new developments for the 1997 Midwest Amiga
Exposition:
<P>
1) Petro Tyschtschenko, President of Amiga International, will be
attending our show as a special guest.
<P>
2). An Amiga Developers Conference is scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 1st
(the first day of the show).  Kermit Woodall, of Nova Design, will be the
moderator. The conference is tenatively scheduled for 4:00pm to 6:00pm. All
Amiga developers are encouraged to attend, as this will be an excellent
opportunity to address many of the issues that face current Amiga
development.
<P>
3).  After the conference, a 7:00pm dinner with Petro Tyschtschenko,
as the guest speaker, will be available, at $30.00 per plate (this price
is not final, we're working on getting it lowered!) for all who
wish to attend. Menu selection of the dinner choice is still pending,
however, it will consist of an entree, side dish, salad, dessert, and
beverage. An informal social gathering at the hotel bar will follow.
<P>
4). A grand prize drawing will take place on Sunday, Nov. 2nd, the last
day of the show at approx. 2:00pm.  We currently are in negotiations to
have an Amiga for a grand prize giveaway. The prize will be an Amiga
1200, with configuration yet to be determined. Some vendors may have
discounted software packages just for the event, and like last year, we
will have hourly giveaways of Amiga and non-Amiga related  computer items
such as mouse pads, T-shirts, CD-Roms, and valuable Amiga software.
<P>
5).  Negotiations are pending for Newtek's attendance and possibly a
Video Toaster training session.
<P>
6).  We are negotiating an IRC feed for the show, enabling
Amiga developers from around the globe to attend the conference.
<P>
Thanks to all who have responded, and please keep an eye on

<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
