OSHAWA AMIGA - SEPTEMBER 15th, 1997
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

-The best news so far is that Epson will be helping out Amiga International &
Gateway to develop Amiga-specific drivers for their line of printers!  No
release date has been set for availability and no word on how distribution
will take place.  Follow the link from our web page at
<A HREF="http://web.idirect.com/~oshamiga">web.idirect.com/~oshamiga</A> to read the press release.

-Pagestream 3.3 will be available for purchase by the time you read this.  To
help get as many Amiga users out there using this amazing program, we are
offering 3.3 for an amazing price!  Check out the specials listed further down
in this message.  If you already own version 3.1 or 3.2, please contact
Softlogik directly to order your upgrade.

- *** NEW CONTEST! ***  Win a copy of Quarterback 6.1 in exchange for your
worst hard drive disaster story.   We mean we really want ALL of your sob
stories from when you knew you should have backed up your hard drive but
DIDN'T!   The rules are simple: Keep it under 250 words and in as simple
english as possible.  All stories submitted become the property of Oshawa
Amiga.  Entries can be submitted by FAX, e-mail, or snail mail.  Contest ends
October 6th at 12:00 midnight E.S.T.  The winner and runner-up stories will be
published on our web site at a later date.  Limit of two entries per person. 
The winner will be determined by how much pity they can muster out of our
judges.  <G>

-We have streamlined our online catalogue to make it easier to find what your
are looking for.  BUT, remember that we remain comitted to getting you the
Amiga products you are looking for!  Call, e-mail, or FAX us with your
quotation requests today!

-No new news on MYST yet.  We'll let YOU know when WE know.  ;-)

-Our fall catalogues are in the final stage of editing.  If you would like one
to be mailed to you, please send your mailing address to us ASAP!

-Our new web site design is now in the works.  This huge task is being
handled by a local Oshawa company called "Cl!ck.Com".  If you would like a
fresh look for your web page, e-mail the owner, Mr. James Campbell, at
headshot@tht.net for more info.
