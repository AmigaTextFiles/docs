<PRE> 
Essen, July 9 1997 - CygnusED, the popular Amiga text editor, will soon be
re-released by Stefan Ossowskis Schatztruhe, Gesellschaft für Software mbH. 
In cooperation with Bruce Dawson and Olaf Barthel the editor will
be revised and updated for release, fixing long-standing bugs and problems.

To ensure that CygnusEd will once again take up its leading position among the
Amiga text editors, we want to give the Amiga community the opportunity to
influence development of the product. Please let us know about your ideas
and wishes regarding the editor, what features do you want to see implemented
and which problems need attention. Send your requests and suggestions to the
following address: <<A HREF="mailto:schatztruhe@cww.de">schatztruhe@cww.de</A>> ; every contribution takes part in a
lottery, the price being one of ten copies of the editor.

The new CygnusEd version will be published on CD-ROM before the end of this
year. Attractive update offers and cross-updates for users of other text
editors are in planning.
