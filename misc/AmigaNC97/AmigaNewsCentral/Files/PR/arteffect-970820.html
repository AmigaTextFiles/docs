<P><B><I>Following the recent successful debut of ArtEffect 2 in June,
we are now pleased to introduce two new special effect packages to extend
its' power. PowerEffects 2 offers a variety of outstanding effects like
LensFlares, Lightning and FishEye. The new PowerUP Effects package offers
a great performance boost for users of PowerUp boards by Phase5. This is
also the first commercial Amiga application that takes advantage of the
incredible speed of these RISC based cards.</I></B><BR>

<P><B>Need for Speed: PowerUP Effects</B> </P>

<P>Are you looking for some really fast effects? Then stop here to have
a look at the PowerUP Effects. The speed of the PowerUP Effect is mainly
based on the PowerPC native version of the plugin.library that handles
almost all actions of the plug-ins. So not only the filters of this package
will be faster, there is also an <I>increase in speed of every effect</I>,
because they all will now use the new PPC plugin.library. Besides this,
there are special native versions of the major effects. The PowerUP Effects
are <I>2 to 20 times faster</I> than the normal ones. The PowerUP Effects
are the first application that makes use of the enormous power of the PowerUP
board of Phase 5. </P>
