         A place where developers and users can come together as one
                         to share ideas and comments.


NATW HAS EXPANDED WITH SOME NEW FEATURES

    DEVELOPERS WANTED

    Developers can now use a forum where their needs for development partners
    can be posted to. This forum is freely accessible to anyone and will
    facilitate the creation of perfect development teams.

    MAINTAIN RESERVED IDEAS

    Developers have the possibility to drop the reservation of ideas. The sad
    truth points out that this is a necessity.
    Soon they'll have the ability to give feedback about the development
    status. A special page will be added to each idea. This will be freely
    editable by the developer that has reserved the idea.

    AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION THROUGH EMAIL

    Developers can now choose to be notified daily or weekly about the new
    ideas that were posted to the site. The email contains the full data
    of the new ideas, including a link to the ideapage itself (for those
    that are running HTML enabled email programs).

    GIFANIMS AND BANNERS FOR PROMOTION

    Several promotion graphics have been created for those that stand behind
    NATW and that want to help to make it get known.

EXPANSION POSSIBILITIES

Anyone who wants to create a Amiga development specific site, can contact me.
I've got a fully function virtual server at their disposal
(thunderstorms.org).

AmiBench (<A HREF="http://thunderstorms.org/AmiBench">http://thunderstorms.org/AmiBench</A>) is an example of such a site.

Press Release 1:

A new Amiga site has been created to provide a place where developers and
users can come together as one to share ideas and comments.


DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE'S PURPOSE

Problems

    * A lot of commercial software houses have left the Amiga-scene and less
      'state of the art' programs are released.
    * Inspired and skilled programmers have become rare 'cause a lot moved
      over to other systems.
    * Public Domain authors tend to have a strange habit of 're'-programming
      the same software tools over and over again.

Conclusion

    Make sure that every programming effort provides a final product that is
    useful, original, easy to use and up to date.

Solution

    An online database that collects ideas, comments and wishes of the users.
    The contents can be freely consulted as long as every programmer reports
    what idea he's working on and how the development progresses.
