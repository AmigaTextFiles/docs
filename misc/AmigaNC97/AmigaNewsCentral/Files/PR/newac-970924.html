<H2>A little something first......</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The test site is housed at <A HREF="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</A>. Amiga Central will NOT be moved there, I'm only using it as a test bed.
<BR>
<LI>Due to the (archaic) handling of accounts by Tripod there are a few problems with the site. All the internal links between pages will NOT work (except for the return to menu option). his of course will be rectified in the final release. I could have adjusted everything to work perfectly but it would have taken more time, time better spent elsewhere.
<LI>Because of the above and a few other small things this test site is only meant to give you an idea of what Amiga Central will be like when completed.
<LI>If the new design doesn't agree with your browser PLEASE email me and I'll attempt to sort it out ASAP.
<LI>Time permitting I'm hoping to have the new design implemented sometime next week.
</UL>

<H3>I would appreciate any comments/bug reports/suggestioms, <A HREF="mailto:paulm@comcen.com.au">email me</A>.
