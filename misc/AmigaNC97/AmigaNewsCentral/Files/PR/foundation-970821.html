Hi Folks,

First of all, the official Foundation homepage is at:

<A HREF="http://www.sadeness.demon.co.uk/foundation.html">http://www.sadeness.demon.co.uk/foundation.html</A>

Just to keep you all informed about the latest Foundation news,
I've listed a few of the latest developments, and news:

1) We're still looking for more mugshots! We have several hundred
   now, but there's always room for more! We'll accept mugshots
   from anyone (don't worry if you're a bit ugly) ;), so get
   sending! There's also now a FREE scanning service, so if
   you can't get your face scanned - please feel free to use it.
   We're escpecially eager to get hold of 'Amiga Celebrities'
   mugshots  - Thanks Petro T. and Jason Compton for getting us
   started here!

2) There's some Workbench backdrop stills from Foundation now 
   available on the web site - 800x600 and very pretty - 
   check them out!

3) We've recently added CyberGFX support to the game, and 
   are plannning AHI support. So, your investment in 
   Amiga hardware has been worthwhile! :)

4) There's some NEW Hi-Res screenshots available on the 
   webpage, and as you can imagine - its looking GREAT!

5) ECS support in the game is likely to get dropped at this
   point - though this is open to discussion. What are people's
   thoughts on this? Supporting ECS is possible, but will slow
   development - and cause a lot of restrictions, and may
   even reduce the quality of the AGA/CyberGFX versions. So,
   what do you all think? Drop ECS support or not?

6) Got a sneak-preview of the music mod today - wow, very 
   atmospheric :)

Well, thats it for now I think. If anyone has any questions about
Foundation - we'll be delighted to answer them! Either in email,
or here in this group.

OK - later folks.
