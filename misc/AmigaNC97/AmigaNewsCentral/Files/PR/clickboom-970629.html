Dear Amiga User,

we will be brief and to the point - PXL computers and clickBOOM are
opening an Internet "shopping mall" area at <A HREF="http://www.clickboom.com">http://www.clickboom.com</A> .

If  you are one of the users who had problems obtaining a game from
PXL computers' product line, you may find this option convenient.  You
can purchase any of the following games online with Visa or
Mastercard:

- Capital Punishment regular retail version
- Capital Punishment files only version 
   (for half the price - see below) 
- Nemac IV Director's Cut regular retail version 
- Myst gear (T-shirts, books, calendars, etc.) 


Capital Punishment for half the price !?

We are conducting a time limited experiment: 

- Full version of  Capital Punishment, minus packaging, 
  for half the price! 

-  8 DMS files corresponding to 8 Capital Punishment disks 
   of the retail version will be e-mailed to you.

- Moreover, you will automatically become a registered user!  
  This will entitle you to the privileges that all regular CP
  registered users enjoy (cheats and tricks, Myst lucky draw 
  every month, priority when we are choosing beta testers for 
  our new games).

- You will also receive by mail the original full-colour manual.


For pricing and further information please visit
