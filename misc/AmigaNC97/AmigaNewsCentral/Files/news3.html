Please bear in mind that without Gateway's approval none of the machines can be (legally) released although Index have stated they are keen to talk to GW2000.
<UL>
<LI>The first, titled <A HREF="http://www.compulink.co.uk/~index/access.htm">Access</A> is basically designed for low cost multimedia presentations and includes as standard CD ROM connectivity, an 8 bit ISA bus and many more enhancements. A working model will be on display at the World Of Amiga 97. 
<LI> The other model and most exciting is titled <A HREF="http://www.cix.co.uk/~index/inout.htm">Inside Out</A> and claims to add "RISC performance" and a maximum resolution of 1280x1028 in 24bit color to Amiga's. This model sounds suspiciously like the previously mentioned RISC machine that Direct Software were supposedly involved with. The hardware is said to be complete, Index are only waiting on the software.

<LI>Sales of <STRONG>Worms:The Directors Cut</STRONG> are reportedly very disappointing so much so that <A HREF="http://www.team17.com">Team17</A> has pretty much ruled out any future Amiga titles.

<P>The plot thickens regarding the current status of the Amiga port of Quake. <A HREF="http://home.ican.net/~clkboom/">ClickBOOM</A> continue to email all webmasters who have the DC port available for download from their page declaring it is now an illegal port as there will be a commercial release soon. ClickBOOM though have made no official announcement as to even their intentions to chase an Amiga port. It appears ClickBOOM are in negotiations with ID Software as to the possibility of a commercial port, otherwise the previous statement by ID Software would still stand (the DC port is OK, see <A HREF="news2.html">older news</A>) and ClickBOOM/PXL Computers would have no reason to ask webmasters to remove the port.<BR>
<BR>In other Quake News:
<UL>
<LI>Digital Corruption are rumoured to have scrapped any further updating to Amiga Quake. The current freely available version is 0.31 although there is a version 0.49 of the engine floating around in some circles.
<LI>There is at least one other team working on Quake for the Amiga. Details are scant to say the least, the only information available is that one team is comprised of two Finnish programmers. Theoretically there could be numerous projects underway as the sources could have ended up in anybodies hands and apparently are still available if you know where to look.<BR>
</UL>Could we end up with more than one Amiga port?, if we do the commercial version had want to be very good to beat the illegitimate versions and even then the freely available versions would almost surely severely damage sales of the commercial release..<BR>

<P>When magazines begin dying it really is a sign of waning support for the Amiga. Even though we appear to be in the midst of an Amiga revival of sorts with the PPC cards due to arrive soon and Gateway's buyout of AT we continue to be reminded of reality as one by one dealers, developers, publishers and users abandon the Amiga. If something isn't done soon to make the Amiga attractive and put a plug on the gaping hole thats sucking out Amiga suppport I'm afraid there may not be anything or anyone left. Death for the Amiga is still a long way off but I'm beginning to smell carrion in the air.<BR>
