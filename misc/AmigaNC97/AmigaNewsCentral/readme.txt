Introduction:

Amiga News Central was a WWW site which operated from early February 1997 to
mid December 1997. As time went by visitors increased and the site expanded.
Just before it's closure Amiga News Central was achieving record levels of
visitors but unfortunately it had to be prematurely closed.

Contained in this archive is all the news and articles which appeared on
Amiga News Central during it's operation. I decided to upload this to Aminet
because it contains comprehensive coverage of all the news and events that
occured at a very important yet turbulent stage of the Amiga's existence. I
hope you find something that interests you, maybe you will find this extra
interesting if you are reading this in the distant future on your top of the
line Amiga 8000 and you want to see what things were like back in 1997 ;-).



Distribution & Copyright:

I'm not a lawyer but here goes :).

This compilation and it's contents is © Copyright 1997 Paul Morabito. It may
be freely distributed through online services such as BBS's and the Internet
on the condition that it is distributed in it's entirety and not cut down or
edited without my permission . PD libraries shall not charge any more than a
"reasonable" fee to cover disk duplication and so on, by "reasonable" I mean
less than $AUD5 (Australian dollars).

If you wish to include this archive on a compilation CD or magazine cover
CD/Disk then please do so. But please inform me beforehand.

If you wish to use any of the editorial or content within this archive in any
online publication or print magazine you MUST have my written permission.

The graphics are largely the work of Andreas Alderud or Per Linden
(per-l@algonet.se). They of course retain copyright on their work.



Disclaimer:

To the best of my knowledge everything included in this archive is correct.
If it isn't or somehow your computer dies while reading this it's not my
fault!.



Notes:

Compiling this has been nothing short of a logistical nightmare. Amiga News
Central underwent 4 very major revisions which made tying this together all
the more tougher. On top of that Amiga News Central largely relied on other
news servies such as Amiga Flame, The Amiga Web Directory, Amiga.Org etc. to
link to for press releases and more information. I couldn't include all this
linked material and I cant guarantee that it is still online. However in most
cases a sufficient summary is provided and press releases and additional
material is available in a minority of cases.



Usage:

Just load the file "index.html" into any WWW browser. This collection has
been tested on the latest publicly available releases of AWeb, IBrowse and
VoyagerNG. There shouldn't be any problems viewing this with any other modern
PC/Mac/Unix browser as this is almost the exact version of the HTML that
appeared on the old website.



Bug Reports:

Direct all bug reports to NIL: or dev/null, whichever tickles your fancy :-).

Seriously, this has been rushed together and resembles what is often termed a
kludge. I'm sure there may be one or two minor bugs and I'm almost certain
plenty of dead links exist but unless it is a critical error I wont even
consider fixing it. I honestly do not have the time or energy. HTML is easy,
do it yourself ;-).

For those persistent few who haven't been discouraged by the above look in
the Contact section on how to reach me.



Contacting Me:

My current email address is paulm@comcen.com.au, however I plan on changing
ISP's sometime in '98 so this will almost certainly change.

If I am uncontactable at this address then please try one of these (in order
of preference):
paulmbto@suburbia.com.au
amiga_central@bigfoot.com
rentz@cyberdude.com
paulmbto@hotmail.com
