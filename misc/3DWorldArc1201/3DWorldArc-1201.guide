This is a G-Rex flash, but it works with xVisionPPC, as they use the same pci bridge.
There's just a new cybpci.library in there+new 68k libs to make it work.

nope, you're wrong it contains some bugfixes regarding the blizzppc.device
and other opening/closing stuff
in for instance CDrive, probably blizzppc.device etc.

check the env-vars
PowerPC/Terminator 2 (if not using ppc.library emulation then set it to 0),
 PowerPC/gfxaddr $e0000000
PowerPC/earlyterm  0
PowerPC/force 1
PowerPC/nopatch 1

Warp3D/cybergfx/Disable 0
Warp3D/cybergfx/forbid 1

Warp3D/Permedia2/FColor $FFFFFF /* probably set by a prefs program*/
Warp3D/Permedia2/Fog         0         /* --------------- "

this are my old settings and they worked for me

What I mean is that, for example, you have to take care that no old

It might be related to heat, or it might be that the power supply isn't 
keeping up. I've heard reports that replacing the power supply with a 
stronger one helped a lot with stability...

Leftovers? all the library are only V4 & the env vars are the
same, apart some new options.

I have also a strange problem: all W3D programs ( e.g. WipeOut Demo,
Gear_PPC, WarpTest etc... ) after few minutes freeze. This problem
may be caused by the overheating of the infernal Permedia2...
When I've installed a "MecaCooler" ( TM Dynamic Animation Japan )
in my tower all the problems of instability are vanished...all the
unaspected freeze are stopped and my Amy is stable for hours, but
is possible that some problems can born whit 3D software???
And an another cooler on P2 (Permedia 2 not Penzium 2 !!) can fix it???

Have you re-installed Warp3D ? That might be a good idea...

Do you have the latest Flash-ROM update installed ? Some people had 
troubles with that...

Also, make sure that there are no leftovers from the old CGX 3 
installation...

Hi,

When I have installed CGX V4 ( 4.2 pre11 ) some probelms are born in
congiunction whit Warp3D ( 4.2a ).
I have installed the correct cgx version ( W3D_CyberGfx4.library ), and the
env variables are the same of
CGX V3 ( USESEMAPHORE=1, BITMAPCACHE=YES ); but when i try to run a w3d
program in a window the
progam crash ( gear_ppc, glsokoban...) whit a "Recoverable Error: 0100
000F".
I have tried a old demo of WipeOut 2097, and when i select "Window mode" for
visualization the error requester:
"Mode not supported by any Warp3D driver"; appear. I have a BPPC/BVision,
and I want know if there is a software
incopatibility or there are some env variables that must be activated?

Hmm, you have to declare Warp3DBase somewhere like this:

struct Library *Warp3DBase;

You need it for OpenLibrary, anyway...

proto/Warp3D.h should include clib/warp3d_protos.h, but a second time

The rest of the file's OK...

Hi to all,
I'm new to this list, and I hope this is the correct place to discuss
Warp3d programming... if not, then kick me ;-)

Well, let's start with something simple (I hope :-)): what do I need
to do to start programming with Warp3D support?
I'm not really experienced with C, so my questions will probably look
rather naive, but what files should I include to do anything after
opening the library?

I'm using StormC 3 (from the Developer CD 2.1) and I managed to open
the Warp3d.library, but if I try to do something else (for example a
ULONG flags=W3D_ChechDriver()) when I try to run the program I get a
"the symbol _Warp3DBase is not defined (suggestion _main)" error.
I am linking storm.lib, amiga.lib (if I try with w3d.lib it doesn't
open the Warp3D.library anymore, I think it is because this version of
StormC doesn't support PPC).

The files I'm including are exec/types.h, exec/memory.h,
libraries/asl.h, proto/exec.h, proto/intuition.h, proto/dos.h,
proto/graphics.h, proto/Warp3D.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, math.h,
Warp3d/Warp3d.h and clib/warp3d_protos.h
(what a long list... I hope it makes sense ;-))

Thanks for your attention, and sorry for the longish mail...

Thanks, I solved the problem: I had put the declaration of Warp3DBase
inside the main, and not as a global variable... now everything is ok!

I thought they were ok, as I mostly copied the ones from warptest.c
from the Warp3D developer dir ;-)

BTW congratulations to you and everyone at Hyperion for your excellent

Subject: StormMesa and the "Amiga related API"
From: mark <mark.harman@ntlworld.com>
Date: Wed, 05 Dec 2001 01:01:43 +0000

First off, please let me know if this is the wrong list for StormMesa 
programming, or if there's a more suitable list..

I'm trying to program StormMesa 3.0, using StormC 3.0. I can compile the 
example programs fine, but they all use GLUT and I'm trying to use the 
Amiga specific API. However, when I call AmigaMesaCreateContextTags() it 
always returns NULL.

Is there any example source code anywhere for the Amiga API, or some more 
detailed developer documentation somewhere? It's probably something stupid 
I'm doing, but without examples to look at, I've not really much idea.

Here's an example where it opens a window, but prints out "Failure!" due to 
NULL being returned, when run for me - any ideas? Note that I've tried 
various settings for the tags. I'm running on a 16bit Workbench screen if 
that makes any difference (though it didn't seem to work under 256 colour 
AGA either)..

#include <clib/intuition_protos.h>

#include <GL/gl.h>
#include <GL/glu.h>
#include <GL/Amigamesa.h>

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	const int width=640;
	const int height=480;
	Window *wnd = OpenWindowTags(NULL,
		WA_Width,	width,
		WA_Height,	height,
		TAG_DONE);
	
	amigamesa_context *am = AmigaMesaCreateContextTags(NULL,
		AMA_Left,	0,
		AMA_Width,	width,
		AMA_Bottom,	0,
		AMA_Height, 	height,
		AMA_Window, 	wnd,
		AMA_DoubleBuf,	TRUE,
		AMA_RGBMode,	TRUE,
		TAG_DONE);

	if(am != NULL)
		printf("Success!\n");
	else
		printf("Failure!\n");
	
	if(wnd)
		CloseWindow(wnd);
	return 0;
}

thanks,
mark

Hi,

I have an A1200/BPPC-BVision/OS3.9.

When i try to open a w3d program in a window it crash
whit a "recoverable error: 0100 000F". I have tryed and old
demo of Wipeout 2097 and when I select "window mode" a requester
say "this mode is not supported by any Warp3D driver". I don't
know why, but this problem is not present whit CGX V3.
All the libraries ( cgx and w3d ) are correctly installed.

I have 2 32MB simms, 64 MB total, but Shogo don't work.During the 
loading of the first mission it freeze. I have setted of the fog
in the preference window of Shogo, but not is changed. Is possible that
the problem is caused from the "low" ram ( i have tried to play
in lowerest resolution possible, whit all vars setted off , but
don't work...). When I run the program the total memory free is
55 MB ( 8 MB gone when i terminate P5 ppc.library and 1 when cgx
is activated ), can this cause the Shogo's freeze?
