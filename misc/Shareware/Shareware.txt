Elevate BBS UK Registration Site.
==================================

It always annoys me with Amiga users who say that they would like to
register a program, but don't like the idea of sending money abroad.
I thought it might be a good idea to  have  a  central  point  where
programs which may only be quite small could be registered.

At  present  I  act  as  a  registration  site for Virus Checker II,
Mapplug, Webplug and spot.

I am thinking that it might be ideal to offer only two  prices,  say
5UK  pounds  and 10UK pounds, to keep it simple, 1 registration form
to cover all the programs so the person only needs  to  fill  out  1
form  so  if  say he wanted to register a couple of them at the same
time. I could then pass the money on to the authors of  the  program
as a Eurocheque.

If any people want to add there programs to this scheme  or  have  a
chat about it get in touch and I'll see what I can do.
