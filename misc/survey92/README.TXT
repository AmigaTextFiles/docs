This is my final project for my Cartography class here at UNL.
The subject was a summary of a large survey I posted on USENET in early 
November.  The survey was centered around the Amiga and the opinions of
it's users.

Overall I am very pleased at the results.  I had 250+ responses from all over
the world.  The diversity of the responses made the translation to maps
very easy (and interesting at that!)

Information on the survey categories can be found in SUMMARY.TXT.

Some of the questions I asked could not be portrayed as a map.  I have left 
them in this archive though to show Commodore and the world the wants
and needs of Amiga users.  Looking over the data, I see that video and
music are very popular....could this be that Commodore has listened to their
users by hitting the multimedia market so hard :-)

The parsed data files can be found sorted by countries with the name GEO.XXX
Look for famous Commodore scene names in the list and their responses :-)
Take heart in the data.  Some errors are to be found.  Some due to parsing
problems my program did...some responses seemed to have wrong answers.....
When I calculated the data, I skipped the "false" data to keep the data
integrity.

Data that could be calculated (for averages and deviations) can be found in
APPENDIXA.TXT

The maps were generated on a 33mhz IBM 486 at 800 x 600 256 color resolutions.
The data was digitized using a digitizing tablet with the IBM paint program
COLORIX.  The data files were translated to GIFS....than translated to IFFs
using crossdosad conversion utils.

The total time it took me to complete this entire project was:
9 hours to process data and surveys  <- major boring stuff!
35 hours to do the lay out work, digitizing, drawing, and line clean up

For the final project grade, I received an A- and a rating of Excellent.
This was a good grade for the class.

I hope this survey will be of use to people.
