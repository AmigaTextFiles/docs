 @{b}Introduction@{ub}
 ------------

  People complain that Amiga companies don't know what the Amiga users want,
 well, this file is there to solve just this problem as well as to give
 software/hardware developers future ideas.  Now there is no real
 excuse for any Amiga company to NOT comply with the users' demands.  Some
 people say it's a bit selfish doing this, but what people must realize is
 that the Amiga users left are not stupid, they are professionals when it
 comes to the Amiga and who else knows better what the new Amigas should do 
 but the Amiga public who has been using them for upto 10 - 11 years!
 This guide is basicly a giant wish list for the new Amigas, however it
 also shows what ideas Amiga users have an possibly some new areas for Amiga
 software/hardware to develope in.

  This guide is not a press release, or anything official, it is what users
 want to happen, not what WILL happen.  This was produced separate to Amiga
 Technologies and any other Amiga company.

  This guide assumes that 24bit Graphics and 16bit Sound are standard and
 should not have to be repeated.

 All Hardware and Software is Copyright their makers...

@NODE "Author" "Authors And Who Helped Make This File"

 @{b}Authors@{ub}
 -------

  This guide is compiled with the help of the Undernet #Amiga and
 channel.  I realize that not all of this is accepted by all users,
 that would be impossible to accomplish, but any difference in
 opinion is mentioned and detailed.

  This guide was compiled by Me, Wayne (TB) Martin.  I have been using
 Amigas right from the start back in the mid 80's and have loved them ever
 since.  However, I also have used MACs and PCs as well and even so, I know
 that the idea behind the Amiga is just so far superior.  I started making
 this guide after a few people requested my opinion on the Amigas current
 situation, they liked, I liked, the guide was made.  I was sick and tired
 of not having my say, and this is somewhat of an attempt to correct that.

 If you speak another language apart from 'English' e.g. Deutch, and would
 be interested in translating this... contact me.

  We want @{b}YOUR@{ub} support and ideas to help us make a better example
 of what the Amiga users world-wide want.  If you have any ideas,
 suggestions or comments, please mail them to me at @{b}martinwa@geocities.com@{ub}.
 Please also state if I can add your name/alias to the file to show your
 support.

  Updates can be obtained from the AmigaTNG.guide HomePage:

  http://www.es.co.nz/~kinetik/AmigaTNG.html

  Thanks to Matthew "Kinetik" Gregan for supplying this site.

  The demand for this file has grown to a point where I am releasing this

@NODE "Dont" "What Amiga Users Don't Want"

 @{b}What Amiga Users Don't Want@{ub}
 ---------------------------

  This section is here to show what the average Amiga user does @{b}NOT@{ub}
 want in the new Amigas, no matter who makes them.  Amiga users are smart
 and know what is needed to make the Amiga regain its place in the computing
 world.

 The following is not wanted:

@{b}o@{ub} The DEC Alpha, or other DEC Chips.  The majority of Amiga users
  believe the future is with the PowerPC family of chips, however, if we 
  'HAVE' to use DEC chips, a 'Shapeshifter' like program must be included 
  that will emulate and run older Amiga 3.0x code!

@{b}o@{ub} No p-OS or BeOS, we want AmigaOS.  p-OS is little more than OS 3.1 
  with KingCON, MCP and CyberGFX running.  BeOS may be a fine OS, but it's 
  not OUR OS.

@{b}o@{ub} No PeeCee SVGA Gfx cards, we want a custom chipset that can actually do
  things like scroll 2D smooth unlike SVGA cards.  We shouldn't have to give up 
  our wonderful scrolling abilities for so called progress.

@{b}o@{ub} No Soundblaster!  We know for a fact that the Soundblaster's sound is 
  way to substandard to be used in a machine like the Amiga.

@{b}o@{ub} No Advertising say 'The Amiga is a great games machine', Look
  what happened last time they did that.  Well, not without A lot of
  business advertising to counter act.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "1200" "1200/4000 Re-release"

 @{b}1200/4000 Re-Release@{ub}
 --------------------

  Once Amiga Technologies has been purchased, one quick source of income
 could be the re-release of the 1200 and 4000(T).  If such a thing is
 possible, the machines would have to be released fast but still taking
 as much advantage of the current OS and Architecture.  However, small
 updates could be done to make sure these machines are used to their best
 possible productivity.

 @{b}Updates in OS 3.1@{ub}
 -----------------

  Small changes must be made to 3.1 if it is to be used in the 1200/4000 for
 new production.  These changes should take no more than a month to make so
 would be a benefit to attempt. The majority of code for these changes is
 now in existence and is freely available:

@{b}o@{ub} Setpatch 43.5+ should be included into to OS to fix/add already known
  code.

@{b}o@{ub} Simple things such as 'NoClick' 'Filter off' 'Border Blanker' and 'Wildcard'
  must be added to provide what is thought as standard and yet not in the OS.
  Or, at least added to the SetPatch.  The interface to these functions
  could be added to already existing prefs programs as some users may not want
  these functions as default.

@{b}o@{ub} A collection of datatypes should be included, especially if the machine is
  to be 'internet ready'.  Datatypes such as GIF/JFIF/PNG/WAV/VOC/BMP should
  all be standard.

@{b}o@{ub} A simple sample player supporting datatypes should be included.

@{b}o@{ub} The commands 'LoadWB' 'Assign' 'Copy' 'Dir' should all be added into the
  ROM, with the fall back available if those commands appear in C:.  This
  would increase booting speed and overall usability.  'LoadWB' is a MUST
  to add, it's stupid how you can not load your WB if that small command is
  not there.

@{b}o@{ub} New FFS 43.11+ should come standard.

@{b}o@{ub} A 'Newshell' should be opened on 'Boot With No Start-up-Sequence' in
  stead of the enhanced CLI thus instantly providing 'copy and paste' as well as
  other features.

@{b}o@{ub} Fixes for the problem that occur when using High Density Disks.

@{b}o@{ub} When the menu item 'ROM Wack' is selected, a requestor should appear
  asking if the user wishes to continue.

@{b}o@{ub} Any optimizations to known ROM routines should be added, such as GFX
  routines.  Possibly even total ROM optimization for the CPU the machine
  is provided with, e.g. ROM 020+ for 1200, ROM 040+ 4000.  This would
  allow speed increases where ever possible.

@{b}o@{ub} More printer drivers with OS.

@{b}o@{ub} Bug fixed serial.device.

@{b}o@{ub} Multiple Monitor drivers sorted into monitor types, e.g. a set of monitor
  drivers for the 1942/1940, one set for Generic Multiscan etc etc.

@{b}o@{ub} IPrefs updated to allow PICs to be stored in Fast ram.

@{b}o@{ub} On Booting, the 'Boot Menu' should be able to be accessed via the
  keyboard and not just the mouse, e.g. Space Key.

  @{b}Hardware Updates@{ub}
  -----------------

  Small bugs known to exist in AGAs architecture could be fixed or at least
 tweaked quickly to allow the most use from it's dated architecture.  Most,
 if not all hardware changes exist and are documented.

@{b}o@{ub} Chip ram could be accelerated, even if only by 5%, the faster the
  Chip ram speed, the more benefits higher CPU uses will get, such as
  increased GFX speed.

@{b}o@{ub} At least one SIMM socket on the MB, this would help with cheap upgrading.

@{b}o@{ub} A minimum of 2megs Chip ram, 4mega Fast ram, 8megs Fast ram would 
  be preferred.

@{b}o@{ub} FPU sockets for machines that do not have an FPU on-board.

@{b}o@{ub} A clock, simple as it sounds, the raw 1200 does not have one.

@{b}o@{ub} If possible, a high-density disk drive.

@{b}o@{ub} 3 Button / Hi-res mouse as standard.

@{b}o@{ub} More powerful PSU with the 1200.

 @{b}Misc Suggestions@{ub}
 ----------------

@{b}o@{ub} At least 2 SIMM sockets, possibly even DRAM.

@{b}o@{ub} 1200/4000 should not be slower than 33Mhz 68030, NOT EC!

@ENDNODE

@NODE "NewOS" "Features Of The New OS"

 @{b}Features Of The New OS@{ub}
 ----------------------

@{b}o@{ub} All features mentioned in the @{"1200/4000" Link "1200"} section at least 
  should be added.

@{b}o@{ub} The obvious things such as 'Networking' 'Memory Protection' 'Virtual
  Memory' 'Resource-Tracking' 'Task-Pausing' 'Multi-Threaded' 

@{b}o@{ub} New Narrator and Translator system that uses human smapled speech 
  fragments to produce a human sounding speech effect.  Also, a user
  definable file filled with corrections to make the speech more acurate.
  This has already been done so would be simple to add.

@{b}o@{ub} Total new OS 'Support'.  e.g. New Pic format, New Sample format (Both
  with support for increased bit expansion), New Standard Archiver, New
  AmigaGuide Format, New Set Of OS Compression tools (similar to XPK/XFD),
  New ARexx with support of ARexx 1.x and REXX. New Animation format (Sound
  and Video.)  This allows a general set of formats to be used similar to
  the way the old IFF formats did, but with extended abilities.  The IFF
  format itself could be redone to provide these features.  By re-starting
  this it removes the previous limits on software and makes software more
  powerful.

  (All with dedicated Libs, so support and upgrades can be done externally.
   As well as docs and datatypes for all formats.) 

@{b}o@{ub} KingCON-like features such as name completion, and scroll buffers in
  Shell.  This should also be user configurable via Prefs.

@{b}o@{ub} Standardized 'Locale' file that contains Several 1,000 common words
  allowing programers quick and easy multilanguage support.  e.g. Load,
  Open, Save, Delete, Copy, Paste, Quit.  A file for each main language
  could be released with Workbench allowing instant Locale support.
  Even if there was only 100 words in each file, that would be more than
  enough for a good quick locale support.

@{b}o@{ub} New FileSystem allowing more characters in draw, file, and device names.
  More crash protection for drives and higher partition limits, e.g. 1 terabyte.
  Also, multi-user support possibly via flags.

@{b}o@{ub} The ability to pause tasks, possibly via a gadget.

@{b}o@{ub} Ability to Minimize/Iconify/Menuify windows and screens.

@{b}o@{ub} Ability to move certain windows to other screens. e.g. Shell
  and output windows.

@{b}o@{ub} 2-Way Datatypes, Load and Save.  1-Way Datatypes should also be 
  supported such as only save or only load.

@{b}o@{ub} Ability to read/write MS-DOS disks in ROM.

@{b}o@{ub} Executive/Unix type system management, configurable.

@{b}o@{ub} An MUI 'like' GUI that is configurable as well as functional.
  Auto scaling, re-mapping etc.

@{b}o@{ub} User definable 'Dock' like function, allowing things such as copy,
  delete, unarchive etc.

@{b}o@{ub} System Automatically detects version numbers of files and advises before
  old file is copied over new file.

@{b}o@{ub} The OS delete functions should display more information on the File/Draw
  before you delete it.  Things like File size, Flags, Filetype (Via
  datatypes), Compression type, Current Network Status etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Requestors when doing certain WB functions, such as Copy and Delete.
  e.g. Percentage, estimated time to finish, cps (Useful for Network
  functions).

@{b}o@{ub} Automatic system updating. e.g. File added to HD0:, all things displaying
  the HD0: file list should be updated to show new file.

@{b}o@{ub} Default font not topaz (or other ROM font) but Prefs assigned font.

@{b}o@{ub} Gurus that tell you what happened in English! (or whatever lang you speak
  :)).  Things such as what task, was a file missing?, what drives will be
  effected? Will these drives be unvalidated?

@{b}o@{ub} WB should be configuarable, e.g. hotkeys etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Better WB execute command, name completion, req selection, scroll back
  buffer.

@{b}o@{ub} ARexx integrated Shell/WB.  ARexx should be running ALWAYS.

@{b}o@{ub} ARexx interface to Workbench/Shell e.g. OpenWindow, OpenShell.

@{b}o@{ub} All Maths libs should use external Maths Prefs.  e.g. Prefs set Maths
  libs to use PPC, or if you have a 'FPU accel card' you can select the Maths
  libs to do calculations using that.

@{b}o@{ub} New ASL system, allowing at least all the options of the current Reqtools.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Prefs" "New OS Prefs Features"

 @{b}New OS Prefs Features@{ub}
 ---------------------

  The issue of the TNG Amigas Prefs seem to be great enough to make its own
 section. I believe that all Prefs should be kept in one program or at least
 in a smaller number than we have now.  Also, all Prefs should be accessed
 and running from 'Bootup with no Start-up'.

 (NOTE: I am currently adding form other parts of the guide to this section
  so I apologize for things being repeated.)

@{b}o@{ub} Totally re-done Workbench Serial Prefs.  All programs using Serial should
  use these Prefs instead of having their own interface.  In this new serial
  Prefs, you should be able to pick what driver you want, see some
  statistics on the driver (e.g. Speed, Baud).  Also, this should also
  apply to nullmodem preferences.

@{b}o@{ub} New Font Prefs allowing new attributes to fonts such as outline.  Also new
  formats of Font should be supported.

@{b}o@{ub} Screen Blanking/Mouse Blanking should now be a part of Prefs, complete
  with sun mouse option for those who use them.  Also this should include
  things like Click to front etc etc.

@{b}o@{ub} GUI Prefs should now be included with the OS.  Buttons, menus, Intuition
  gadgets/slider, Window style, Cycle gadgets, cyclemenus, all should be
  configuarable via the GUI Prefs.  Also included into this should be more
  Prefs for backdrops (If 'FastRam' and 'ChipRam' still exist, the option
  of Backgrounds to 'FastRam' should also be there.)

@{b}o@{ub} A New Sound Prefs with the ability to add sounds to any event, such as
  Disk Inserted Window Opened, Boot Up (Its very import that we have this
  free to edit as we wish).  Also included should be the options to turn
  filter on/off and to have samples played from Chip/Fast or from HD.  The
  Prefs should be able to load any datatype sound present, with or without
  compression etc.

@{b}o@{ub} New Pointer Prefs with the ability to have as many colours in the pointer
  as on the screen.  Also, instead of just normal and busy states, the
  pointer should have more states to give the user more of an exact idea of
  what is going on.  These new states can have graphics, or small
  animations.

@{b}o@{ub} A New Palette Prefs with the ability to change ALL colours and not only
  the first 8 etc.  Also the possible addition of 'Transparent colours' to
  allow more powerful GUI looks.  Things such as 'Unselected Window',
  'Shell background' and other should all have selectable colours.

@{b}o@{ub} A New updated Printer Prefs, with new options like Print to FAX or print
  to HD in selectable format (e.g. FAXX, IFF)

@{b}o@{ub} New Time Prefs with alarm, ability to display clock etc on title bar or
  some where selectable on screen.  Also, self correct system using
  international time servers.

@{b}o@{ub} Workbench Windows should display more info on the Drive/Partition they
  are for, e.g. free space, file system, number of files, access 'led'.

@{b}o@{ub} Hardware Prefs program, with possible external system allowing 3rd party
  companies to add new Prefs to the program to configure their 'card'.  This
  would simply blow away Plug'n'play, of course, Fit'n'Forget should still
  be there.

@{b}o@{ub} The startup-sequence and user-startup (If they still exist) should be
  counted as a system pref, so should be able to be edited via Prefs.

@{b}o@{ub} Compression Prefs, based on somewhat of a more advanced XPK/XFD 
  idea.  As some compression methods should be included with the OS, these should be
  selectable via Prefs so they are transparent to the system.  Also,
  actions such as copying from HD0: (compressed) to DF0: should automatically
  be recognized and files should be decompressed.

@{b}o@{ub} Datatype should no be counted as a system pref.  Datatype options should
  be edited via Prefs prog.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "NewWB" "Features Of New Workbench Release"

 @{b}Features Of The New Workbench Release@{ub}
 -------------------------------------

@{b}o@{ub} On CD and/or Disk.

@{b}o@{ub} Many new printer drivers for support of top brands and if not, a better
  generic set of drivers.

@{b}o@{ub} Set of Monitor drivers to match certain Monitors e.g. 1942 etc.

@{b}o@{ub} New set of Datatypes covering main world formats e.g.
  GIF/PNG/JFIF/AIFF/WAV/VOC etc etc.

@{b}o@{ub} HyperText viewer, if not built into multiview via datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} Sound/GFX format converter via datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} Archiving tool like LhA/LZX using the 'new' Amiga archiving format.

@{b}o@{ub} Docs for 'EVERY' command or file present with the Workbench Release.

@{b}o@{ub} New Icons, with at least 16+ colours.  Also, a set of Patterns and Sound
  should also be included. (8bit+ would be best)

@{b}o@{ub} A File Manager similar to DirectoryOPUS with datatype support.

@{b}o@{ub} CDDA Player/Writer as well as CD-I MPEG Software.

@{b}o@{ub} Sound and GFX Editing software that can Load/Save via Datatypes.

@{b}o@{ub} Text Editor that is far more powerful than ED, and of course a
  ARexx Interface.

@{b}o@{ub} Programer Docs, Kernel etc.  This would provide an large developer base
  quickly with the tools and information needed.

@{b}o@{ub} Disk-fixing Utilities, even though basic operations should be built into OS.

@{b}o@{ub} HardDisk Prep utils.

@{b}o@{ub} Stacker with support for the 'new' Amiga compression format(s)

@{b}o@{ub} Blanker with Powersaver support, as well as HDSleep system.

@{b}o@{ub} Exchange with support for 'pause' and other featurees more like
  ARTM etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Terminal, FAX, Voice Mail, Video Phone and TCP software
  (FTP/WWW/IRC/Telnet), including a PCMCIA serial.device.

@{b}o@{ub} System Speed Tester and combination Hardware Config/Checker.

@{b}o@{ub} Possibly a program similar to ShapeShifter and/or PCx as well as an
  Amiga version as this OS most likely wont support OS 3 and below and via
  a Amiga Emulation program, support can remain, and be updated externally.

@{b}o@{ub} Bug-fixes and New OS Software should be released at least every 6 
  months.  Patchs would be the simplest way to do this.  At Setpatch could
  be relased in even less time.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "NewHW" "Features Of New Hardware"

 @{b}Features Of The New Hardware@{ub}
 ----------------------------

@{b}o@{ub} All features mentioned in the @{"1200/4000" Link "1200"} section at least 
  should be added. (Or similar)

@{b}o@{ub} PowerPC, or a combination 680x0 series with PPC.  603e for lowend, 
  604e for highend. 120Mhz Minimum clock rate.  For a bridge machine 0x0 and 60x
  could be used together but new Tech machines should only have 60xs.

@{b}o@{ub} Keyboard buffer, another simple function people take for granted.
  The choice of a Normal/Natural keyboard should also be included. KB Light
  allowing of typing in the dark, sounds silly but is handy for people with
  poor vision such as my self.

@{b}o@{ub} Choice of SCSI(II) or EIDE I/@{b}O@{ub}. No 'Hardware Hitting' allowed.

@{b}o@{ub} Enhanced Parallel and Serial ports as well as option of Hardware
  serial or software serial.

@{b}o@{ub} Detachable / Separate Keyboards. Expanded from the original C= Design,
  e.g. More keys such as new F Keys, 8 Cursor keys etc

@{b}o@{ub} CD-ROM as standard, 'Writable CD' 'Tape Drive' 'Removable Media'
  as an option.

@{b}o@{ub} Support for Extended Density Drives/Disks. e.g. 900k, 1.8m, 3.6m disks.

@{b}o@{ub} Internal port for Internal modems etc that is accessible via small
  removable panel in case, for easy access without having to rip machine
  apart.  Same with RAM.  Similar to the 'Trapdoor' of the 1200 etc.

@{b}o@{ub} PCI, but a new 64/128bit Zorro (IV) would be preferred, possibly compat
  ible with Zorro II/III. PCI is there without question. PCI ports included
  should be PCI multimedia buses.

@{b}o@{ub} An advanced Diagnostics system to detect and 'inform' the user of
  faults and their cause, and this time... In English, not colours.
  Colours are not the standard international language :)

@{b}o@{ub} Drop the idea of Chip / Fast ram and just have a single type.
  Of course, amounts of GFX data and Normal data must also be able to be
  displayed.

@{b}o@{ub} Desktop and Mini / Full Tower cases.  There should no longer be any 
  Wedge machines.  However, Laptops would be a good idea when/if technology allows.

@{b}o@{ub} A SetTop Box machine could be a possibility, but NOT the main focus of
  Amiga, it should be something on the side of normal production and
  development.

@{b}o@{ub} A range of {"expansion cards" Link "Expan"} should be available including, 
  MPEG cards, accelerator cards, ISDN cards, expansion I/@{b}O@{ub} cards, TV/radio tuners,
  MIDI, Network cards etc

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Expan" "Expansion Cards/Options"

 @{b}Expansion@{ub}
 ---------

  With a new machine, is the possibility for new expansions opening new
 areas.  This section lists some possible cards or misc. expansions that
 would benefit the new machine.

@{b}o@{ub} TV/Radio (FM/AM) Tuner. Teletext also.

@{b}o@{ub} Video Toaster and similar tools.  Modular also, if not already in machine.

@{b}o@{ub} MPEG Encoding/Decoding hardware, if not already included.

@{b}o@{ub} FPU Accel, for raytracing etc.

@{b}o@{ub} MIDI Card.

@{b}o@{ub} Digital Video/Normal Camera.

@{b}o@{ub} Internal modems, also ISDN cards.

@{b}o@{ub} Network cards, including Ami - PC networking.

@{b}o@{ub} RAM compression hardware.

@{b}o@{ub} Keyboard scanner.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Misc" "Misc Suggestions"

 @{b}Misc Requests@{ub}
 --------------

@{b}o@{ub} Talks between Amiga and other Amiga-orientated companies such as 
  Phase V should occur often providing the user with the best software/hardware.

@{b}o@{ub} The idea of Aminet should be continued and supported.

@{b}o@{ub} Amiga Software/Hardware prices should be available on the Net in every
  currency where Amigas are used.  As well, ordering via Internet should be
  possible.

@{b}o@{ub} Advertising should be controlled by a group in each country where
  advertising is to be attempted, with close connections to Amiga.
  different countries require different advertising needs.

@{b}o@{ub} Official 'Amiga Approved' licences should be used so that Amigas can be
  cloned but remain under control of Amigas standards thus stopping the
  'PeeCee' problem.

@{b}o@{ub} Close talks between NewTek and Amiga would be wise, possibly offering
  Technology for a deal with future VideoToaster and other technologies.

@{b}o@{ub} Donation of Hardware/Software to Certain companies/services to boost
  coverage and the identity of the Amiga.  e.g. TV companies, ISPs etc.

@{b}o@{ub} Demos should be made and distributed via Internet to stores all over the
  world,  Offers could be made, best demo wins a new Amiga etc etc.
  (Nothing shows off an Amiga better than a good Demo ;) )

@{b}o@{ub} Official User groups should be setup allowing users to communicate to
  Amiga with suggestions/fixes, and support for the users.  Its is common
  to see some Amigas user groups that basically have no idea of what they are
  doing.
