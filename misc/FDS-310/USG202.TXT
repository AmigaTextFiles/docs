                           (The what, why and hows)

                           Version 2.02 release 2.0
                               Updated: 27.9.95



                      --==>> What exactly is USG? <<==--

     USG  is  a  non-profit  organisation  of users and developers who are
    willing to support and aid in the development of high quality software
    and  standards.   As such, USG will help developers with ideas to make
    their  product better, and to encourage them to actually release their
    products.   USG  will  also  help  with  suggestions,  tips, technical
    details, and to provide betatesters for these products.


                  --==>> What are the goals with USG? <<==--

     USG's  goal  is simply to provide a stable base for developers to get
    their products tested and to provide the end-user with a simple way to
    let the developer know what they think of their product.  USG will try
    to  help  developers find suitable betatesters for their product.  USG
    will also act as quality-assurance for products.  Look for things like
    'Endorsed by USG', 'Supported by USG' and similar...


                            --==>> Why USG? <<==--

     Well,  that  is up to you.  If you have ever developed something, you
    might  know  the  amount of work involved.  If you also have been busy
    betatesting  it, you know that there is always one more bug.  USG will
    not  do  all  the  work  for  you,  but should provide you with enough
    suggestions and tips to make it easier from the start.


                    --==>> Why should you join USG? <<==--

     As  a  developer, you should join to gain access to a wide variety of
    users  and  other developers.  Other developers could provide you with
    lots  and  lots of tips on 'how to'.  Betatesters finding that obscure
    bug noone would have found until after release.  Suggestions on how to
    do  certain things.  These things can be the thing that gets a product
    released instead of scrapped.

     As  a user, you should join USG to support the development of quality
    software  and  quality standards.  As a user, you can also take active
    part  in the development of said software and standards.  You could be
    a  betatester  for  someone,  or  maybe do some promotional work for a
    product you like.

     As a member of USG, your knowledge, thoughts and opinions can provide
    invaluable help for others, which is the main goal with USG.


                       --==>> How does USG work? <<==--

     USG  as  an  organisation  works  by the rule that everyone is equal.
    Major  changes  regarding  USG  will be a matter for all members.  For
    single developers, they will still have full control of their product.
    USG  will  serve  as  a  support  organisation for the product, IF the
    developer  wishes  it.   Practically, most contact is through FidoNet,
    InfoNet, AmigaNet or the InterNet.

     At  the time of writing, USG does not handle any registration issues,
    nor  any  distribution of your product, but maybe in the future.  This
    depends  on  the  interest  among  members  to take active part in the
    maintenance of USG as an organisation.


                        --==>> USG on the Net? <<==--

     USG  doesn't  have its own homepage on the WWW yet, but you can still
    find some information about USG on the homepage of one of the members.
    It  should  be updated with the latest info from USG, so why don't you
    check it out?  You'll find it at;
