    @{b}2.1  PURPOSE@{ub}

     The File Description Standard (or FDS, for short) is a new standard for
    adding descriptions to ANY kind of file.  The FDS also contains many new
    features not available in any other description-standards.  For example,
    the ability to use multiple languages in the same description.  The main
    goal with the FDS is to provide a simple, yet powerful, standard for the
    users and bulletin board systems alike.

     The FDS also tries to maintain a flexible style, which will allow us to
    expand and enhance the standard if the need should arise.  This document
    should provide users with enough knowledge to create descriptions.
@endnode

@node 22 "Section 2.2 -- Using the FDS"

    @{b}2.2  USING THE FDS@{ub}

     Users and developers choosing to use/implement this standard MUST, with
    no exceptions, follow the standard.  The standard is this document, plus
    the extended document for developers.  Unless a feature is documented in
    any of these two documents, it is NOT a part of the standard.

@node 31 "Section 3.1 -- Creating the file description"

    @{b}3.1  CREATING THE FILE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     Creating the file description is pretty straightforward actually.  What
    you have to do is to get hold of a text-editor which is able to save the
    description as pure ASCII text.  Then you just type in your description,
    according to the standard of course, save it as FILEDESC.TXT or maybe as
    a temporary file, and it is ready to use.

     Maybe you are lucky enough to have an editor dedicated to the standard?
    In that case, you will only have to input the information needed and the
    editor takes care of saving it correctly.  Some editors actually include
    online help, which means that you won't have to know the entire document
    by heart.  There are, to my knowledge, only two editors available.  Both
    for the Amiga range of computers.  FileDescEditor by Mattias Palsson and
    DescMaker by Robert Bjorn.

     If you are writing it manually, it is highly recommended to be familiar
    with the format of the file description, and to know the keywords really
    well.  I can recommend using a template for your descriptions, where you
    remove the lines you don't want.

@node 32 "Section 3.2 -- Using the file description"

    @{b}3.2  USING THE FILE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     Alright, now you have your file description written and ready.  Next up
    is to add it to the FILE it describes.  While there are three filetypes,
    there are two ways of adding the description.  The first filetype is the
    ARCHIVE file, where the file description is added to the archive with an
    archiver.  The second filetype is the TEXT file, where you simply put it
    as text inside the text file.  The last filetype is the trickiest to use
    as it isn't easily done by hand.  I will explain the details in the next
    sections, 3.3 through 3.5.

        @{" 3.3  Adding the file description to an archive        " link 33}

            This section sheds some light on how to use your favorite

@node 33 "Section 3.3 -- Adding the file description to an archive"

    @{b}3.3  ADDING THE FILE DESCRIPTION TO AN ARCHIVE@{ub}

     This is the most straightforward way to use the description, and you're
    encouraged to ALWAYS archive your files when distributing them.  Not for
    your sake, but for everyone else's.  Anyway, to add the file description
    to an ARCHIVE, you simply use the archiver to add it in the archive with
    the filename FILEDESC.TXT (uppercased if possible).

     Here are a few examples on how to add it;

        .ARJ  [PC]   Arj 2.30       ARJ a {archive file} FILEDESC.TXT
        .LHA  [AM]   LhA 1.50       LHA a {archive file} FILEDESC.TXT
        .LZH  [PC]   LhA 2.13       LHA a {archive file} FILEDESC.TXT
        .LZX  [AM]   Lzx 1.01       LZX a {archive file} FILEDESC.TXT
        .RAR  [PC]   Rar 1.52       RAR a -std {archive file} FILEDESC.TXT
        .ZIP  [PC]   PkZip 4.1v     PKZIP -a {archive file} FILEDESC.TXT

              [PC]   = IBM/PC compatibles.
@endnode

@node 34 "Section 3.4 -- Adding the file description to a text file"

    @{b}3.4  ADDING THE FILE DESCRIPTION TO A TEXT FILE@{ub}

     To add the file description to a TEXT file, you will need to include it
    in the actual FILE.  Due to the fact that it is a pure text file, that's
    not very complicated.  Here is a "step-by-step" instruction;

     Let's say that you've written a text, and saved it as NICETEXT.TXT.  As
    you are about to upload it to your local BBS, you want to create and add
    a description to go with it.  Let's assume you have already created your
    description, and saved it as FILEDESC.TXT.  These files should be merged
    together, either by loading both files into a texteditor and copying the
    file description to the NICETEXT.TXT file, or by using some sort of join
    command to merge them.  Anyway, you'll end up with something like this;

        --- 8< ---------------------------------------------------------
        This is the fantastic text you have written.  Or at least you
        could imagine it.
     -> %DES: Default
     -> This is the actual text for the english/default description.
     -> %END:
        --- 8< ---------------------------------------------------------

     The lines marked with arrows are the file description.  This is not the
    final result though.  To make it possible to know which lines are a part
    of the file description we use two marker-strings, which I will refer to
    as HEADER and FOOTER.  The header string is "@BEGIN USG_FILEDESC", while
    the footer string is "@END USG_FILEDESC".  The header and footer MUST be
    typed in uppercased letters.  What you want to do now, is to use the two
    marker strings like this;

        --- 8< ---------------------------------------------------------
        This is the fantastic text you have written.  Or at least you
        could imagine it.
     -> @BEGIN USG_FILEDESC
        %DES: Default
        This is the actual text for the english/default description.
        %END:
     -> @END USG_FILEDESC
        --- 8< ---------------------------------------------------------

     As you can see by the arrow-marked lines, the markers are inserted just
    before and after the file description.  Isn't it simple?  You could also
    write the file description when you write the text, that doesn't matter,
    just remember to ALWAYS include the marker-strings.

     And if this sounds to complicated for you, keep an eye out for software
    which allows you to do this operation almost automatically.

@node 35 "Section 3.5 -- Adding the file description to a binary file"

    @{b}3.5  ADDING THE FILE DESCRIPTION TO A BINARY FILE@{ub}

     Adding a file description to a BINARY file is done the same way as with
    the TEXT file.  With the notable exception that you can't normally do it
    by yourself.  Most BINARY filetypes are very strictly constructed, which
    means that simply joining the file description to the end of the file is
    NOT recommended.  As a user, you should NOT attempt to add a description
    to a binary file unless you have VERY good knowledge of the fileformat.

     Conclusion; you need specialized software to add file descriptions to a
    binary file.  Be warned, tampering with binary files may destroy them.

     Still, you are probably better off archiving the file instead.  That is
    the only solution if you don't have means to add the file description in
    any other way.

@node 41 "Section 4.1 -- Components of the file description"

    @{b}4.1  COMPONENTS OF THE FILE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     A file description is made up almost entirely of keywords.  The keyword
    concept makes the standard flexible, and expandable if needed.  Keywords
    are used to enter all kinds of information about the FILE.

     All keywords, except %DES:, uses one line each in the file description.
    The format for all one-line keywords is;

        %KEY: {data for this keyword}

     %KEY: does NOT exist, it is just used as an example.  All keyword has a
    percent-sign as the first character and a colon as the fifth.  The chars
    between the % and the : is the keyword identifier.  Everything after the
    colon is data for the keyword.  For example, the keyword for author;

        %AUT: Peter Bornhall

     As I mentioned above, there is one exception to the one-line rule.  The
    %DES: keyword is used for the actual description (do NOT confuse it with
    the FILE description) text.

     Well, how DO you write the actual description text?

     That is where the %DES: keyword comes into action.  First of all, %DES:
    tells us which language is used by the description text that follows the
    keyword.  For example;

        --- 8< -------------------------------------------
        %DES: Default
     -> FilePather 1.3 -- BBS adder/remover/history.
        FP creates a history within an archive or a
        textfile. Each time FilePather processes a file
        it will update the list with one line of text
        which is configurable by the user.
        %AUT: Johan Torin
        %VER: FilePather 1.3
        --- 8< -------------------------------------------

     The first line tells us that this is the DEFAULT description.  The next
    line, marked with an arrow, is the SHORT description, which always comes
    directly after the %DES: keyword line.  The lines following the short is
    the EXTENDED description.  The extended description uses all lines until
    the next keyword, which is %AUT: in this case.  See sections 4.3 through
    4.4 for more info on the short and extended descriptions.  You will also
    find a full explanation of the %DES: keyword in section 4.7.4.

     Descriptions should be written using ordinary ASCII characters, but the
    standard allows the use of different charsets through the %CHR: keyword.
    The default charset is ISO 8859-1, also known as LATIN-1.

     All lines in the file description may be of any length, but try to keep
    the linelength less than 81 characters for practical reasons.

@node 42 "Section 4.2 -- Default description"

    @{b}4.2  THE DEFAULT DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     As you know, the FDS allows multiple languages in the file description.
    One of these is English, which is also known as the DEFAULT description.
    You should ALWAYS have a Default/English description in all descriptions
    you create.  Here is an example of a multi-language file description;

        --- 8< -------------------------------------------
        %DES: Svenska
        {short description in Swedish}
     -> %DES: Default
     -> {short description in English}
        %DES: Espanol
        {short description in Spanish}
        --- 8< -------------------------------------------

     For further examples, see the enclosed example file.
@endnode

@node 43 "Section 4.3 -- Short description"

    @{b}4.3  SHORT DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     The SHORT description is a one-line description of the FILE.  It should
    be a short but informative line.  Remember that some BBS's only use some
    40-50 chars for their one-line descriptions, so please keep it brief.

     The short description always follow the %DES: keyword.  You must have a
    short description in every %DES: description.

     The SHORT description should be something like these examples;

        Phonebill 3.2 - Keeps track of your phonebill.

        GIF 800x600, HQ scan of space shuttle Discovery.

        S3M: Nightfall, atmospheric tune by unknown author.

@node 44 "Section 4.4 -- Extended description"

    @{b}4.4  EXTENDED DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     Just as the title says, the EXTENDED description is an extension to the
    SHORT description.  It's in no way intended to replace the short, but to
    complement it.  You should actually consider the short description to be
    the first line of the extended description.  So please try not to repeat
    yourself in the extended description.  An extended description is ALWAYS
    located directly after a short description.

        --- 8< -------------------------------------------
        %DES: Default
        FilePather 1.3 -- BBS adder/remover/history.
     -> FP creates a history within an archive or a

@node 45 "Section 4.5 -- Sections in an extended description"

    @{b}4.5  SECTIONS IN AN EXTENDED DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     Another feature in the FDS is the possibility of word-wrapping the text
    to any linelength.  This allows a BBS to wrap the description to desired
    linelength.  There is a small sub-feature that is called SECTIONS.

     OK, let us assume you have an EXTENDED description that tells you which
    features a certain software have.  Something like this;

        --- 8< ---------------------------------------------------------
         * This program support the File Description Standard release 2.
         * Works with ALL systems!
         * Source included.
        --- 8< ---------------------------------------------------------

     Three lines, three features.  What would happen if these lines were put
    through a word-wrapping routine?  Probably total chaos.  That's were the
    magic comes to work.  Note how none of the lines begin in the very first
    column, they are all indented one char.  That is the secret used to find
    the SECTIONS.  When a line begins with a whitespace character like space
    or tab, it is considered to be the first line of a new SECTION.

     Each section is then wrapped separately, which would yield this;

        Wrapped for 40 chars                        Wrapped for 20 chars
        --- 8< ---------------------------------    --- 8< -------------
         * This program supports the File            * This program
        Description Standard release 2.             supports the File
         * Works with ALL systems!                  Description Standard
         * Source included.                         release 2.
        --- 8< ---------------------------------     * Works with ALL
                                                    systems!
                                                     * Source included.
                                                    --- 8< -------------

     Of course, the result may look horrible in some cases, but I can almost
    guarantee you that very few boards use 20 chars as maximum linelength.

     Still, it is possible to construct a word-wrapping routine that is more
    advanced.  A routine that could indent wrapped lines properly, like;

        Wrapped for 40 chars
        --- 8< ---------------------------------
         * This program supports the File
           Description Standard release 2.
         * Works with ALL systems!
         * Source included.
        --- 8< ---------------------------------

     Note how the second line is indented correctly.  This isn't a very hard
    thing to accomplish if you have enough programming skill.

    @{b}4.6  KEYWORDS@{ub}

     KEYWORDS are used for entering specific information regarding the FILE,
    the author, charset and similar things.  The keyword concept also ensure
    that the standard is expandable if needed.

     Keywords begin with % (ASCII 37), followed by a three-letter identifier
    and a colon.  With the exception of %DES:, all keywords consists of only
    one line each.  Each keyword line contains a keyword and possibly a line
    of text directly after.  A file description may have unlimited keywords.

     The three-letter identifier is the unique part of the keyword, which is
    used to identify the keyword.  You could actually use a %ABC: keyword if
    you wanted to.  It would be recognized as a keyword, but as it's unknown
    it will simply be ignored.  The three-letter identifier consists only of
    combinations of A-Z and 0-9.

@node 471 "Section 4.7.1 -- %AUT: (Author information)"

    @{b}4.7.1  %AUT: (Author information)@{ub}

     This keyword should reflect the name of the author or development group
    responsible for the software.  You may add some additional info like for
    example email address or similar.  Keep it short though.

        Examples:   %AUT: John Doe, jdoe@nowhere.com

@endnode

@node 472 "Section 4.7.2 -- %CHR: (Charset used in description)"

    @{b}4.7.2  %CHR: (Charset used in description)@{ub}

     This keyword should reflect which charset was used for the description.
    This makes it easier to convert the description to other charsets, like
    IBMPC, or codepage 437.  If this keyword is omitted, LATIN-1 is used as
    default charset.

     Available charsets include:    ASCII       Standard        7-bit
                                    IBMPC       CP437           8-bit

@endnode

@node 473 "Section 4.7.3 -- %DAT: (Releasedate)"

    @{b}4.7.3  %DAT: (Releasedate)@{ub}

     This keyword should reflect the releasedate of the FILE.  In some cases
    it's useful to know when a software was released, for example to know if
    it is outdated or not.  Dates should always be written '<d>.<m>.<y>'.

        Examples:   %DAT: 27.11.95
                    %DAT: 8.1.96
@endnode

@node 474 "Section 4.7.4 -- %DES: (Language-specific descriptions)"

    @{b}4.7.4  %DES: (Language-specific descriptions)@{ub}

     The %DES: keyword could more or less be considered the core of the FDS.
    This keyword allows multiple languages in the same description, and uses
    always at least two lines.  All lines between the %DES: keyword line and
    the next keyword (invalid keywords too) belongs to the same description.
    Please note that "description" in this case does NOT refer to the entire
    file description, just the description part of the %DES: keyword.

     Every %DES: description consists of the keyword and its language, SHORT
    description and optionally an EXTENDED description.  See also chapter 4.

     For example, take a look at this (also from chapter 4);

        --- 8< -------------------------------------------
        %DES: Default
     -> FilePather 1.3 -- BBS adder/remover/history.
        --- 8< -------------------------------------------

     This is a simple but valid description.  The first line, with the %DES:
    keyword, tells the parser that a description will follow, and that it is
    the DEFAULT (English) language.  The line following the %DES: keyword is
    always (unless it is another keyword) the SHORT description.

        --- 8< -------------------------------------------
        %DES: Default
        FilePather 1.3 -- BBS adder/remover/history.
     -> FP creates a history within an archive or a
     -> textfile. Each time FilePather processes a file
     -> it will update the list with one line of text
     -> which is configurable by the user.
        --- 8< -------------------------------------------

     If the line following the SHORT description isn't a keyword, then it is
    the EXTENDED description.  All lines until the next keyword then belongs
    to the DEFAULT (in this case) description.

@node 475 "Section 4.7.5 -- %DIR: (Directory)"

    @{b}4.7.5  %DIR: (Directory)@{ub}

     This  keyword  is  used to sort the file into a specific directory, for
    example  for use on AmiNet.  You should only enter the path, without any
    drive  information.  Directories are separated with a forward slash, and
    a trailing slash is not obligatory.

        Example:    %DIR: docs/misc/
@endnode

@node 476 "Section 4.7.6 -- %END: (Stop parsing)"

    @{b}4.7.6  %END: (Stop parsing)@{ub}

     This keyword is used only to mark the end of a file description.  It is
    not required, but you should use it just to be on the safe side.  Please
    note that this keyword ends the ENTIRE file description.  It is NOT used
    as an end-marker for the %DES: keyword!

        Example:    %END:
@endnode

@node 477 "Section 4.7.7 -- %EXT: (Extension to the %DES: keyword)"

    @{b}4.7.7  %EXT: (Extension to the %DES: keyword)@{ub}

     This keyword is only used in conjunction with the %DES: keyword, and it
    only applies if it is found directly after the description.

        Example:    %DES: Default
                    This is the SHORT description.
                    This is the EXTENDED description.
                    The extension keyword is only valid if it follows
                    directly after the description, like this.
                 -> %EXT: NOWRAP

     This keyword has, currently, only one command; NOWRAP.  If you use this
    command, the description will NOT be wrapped.  Although descriptions are
    supposed to be written with wrapping in mind, this keyword allows you to
    prevent the description from wrapping.

@endnode

@node 478 "Section 4.7.8 -- %FIL: (Original filename)"

    @{b}4.7.8  %FIL: (Original filename)@{ub}

     This keyword should tell the original name of the FILE when it was sent
    into distribution.  Could be used to check for duplicates, which used in
    conjunction with the %REP: keyword could help a sysop keep his HD clean.

     If the filename exceeds the 8+3 limit imposed by MS-DOS, you might want
    to use two filenames, where one of them conforms to the 8+3 standard and
    the other does not.  Separate filenames with space and use quotes if the
    filename contains any spaces.

        Examples:   %FIL: GreatWhite_demo.lha
                    %FIL: MANHATTN.GIF "Manhattan Skyline.gif"

@node 479 "Section 4.7.9 -- %LAN: (Supported languages)"

    @{b}4.7.9  %LAN: (Supported languages)@{ub}

     Do NOT confuse this with the %DES: keyword.  This keyword could be used
    to check if a certain software is of any use to a user.  For example, in
    Germany there are many programmers whose software is German-only.  For a
    person who can't understand German, the software is more or less useless
    to him.  Could save you some hard-earned download credits.  For example,
    IF your software is German-only, add '%LAN: Deutsch'.

     Languages should be entered in the NATIVE tongue, "Deutsch" for German,
    "Svenska" for Swedish and so on.  ALL languages that are supported would
    be entered on the same row, separated by a / (forward slash).

     If the software supports user-changeable languages through the OS, like
    locale on AmigaDOS 2.1 or higher, you should enter the first language as
    'Locale'.  The first language following the locale string should reflect
    the built-in language.  Any languages following after, are supplied with
    the software.

     If this keyword is omitted, the FILE is considered to be international,
    or English.  English is more or less understood by most computer-users.

        Examples:   %LAN: English/Deutsch/Dansk/Svenska
                    %LAN: Locale/English/Deutsch/Espanol

@node 4710 "Section 4.7.10 -- %LEN: (Original filelength)"

    @{b}4.7.10  %LEN: (Original filelength)@{ub}

     This keyword should reflect the original length of the distributed FILE
    in bytes.  Can be used to check if the user has stripped away BBS ads or
    not, for example.  Filelength is the exact number of bytes the FILE plus
    the file description occupies.  For an ARCHIVE, this might be difficult,
    but not impossible.  First sequence of numeric chars should be used.

        Examples:   %LEN: 81962 bytes
                    %LEN: 12281

@node 4711 "Section 4.7.11 -- %OBJ: (Object keyword/category)"

    @{b}4.7.11  %OBJ: (Object keyword/category)@{ub}

     This keyword is used to categorize the FILE, which makes it possible to
    sort the file into different areas, and allows the users to search for a
    certain type of software.  You may use as many categories as you like, a
    file might fit into more than one category, but the FIRST category is to
    be considered the most important category.  Always use the categories in
    the order they are to be sorted by.

        Examples:   %OBJ: Communications Utility
                    %OBJ: Programming Assembler

     You are allowed to use any name for a category, but you should consider
    using one or more of the categories listed below.  If none of them suits
    your particular software, use some simple category name, instead of some
    cryptic category nobody understands.  Or use the Miscellaneous category,
    used for hard-to-categorize files.  If you feel that it might be useful,
    use multiple categories.  Multiple categories can make it easier to find
    files with certain properties.

        Examples:   %OBJ: Programming
                    %OBJ: Programming C

    in general.  The second example is more specific, referring also to "C".

@node 4712 "Section 4.7.12 -- %PID: (Program identity)"

    @{b}4.7.12  %PID: (Program identity)@{ub}

     This keyword should only be used by software that creates or edits this
    kind of descriptions.  As a user, you should not use this keyword.

        Examples:   %PID: FileDescEditor 2.0
                    %PID: DescMaker 1.3

     Format of this string is free, but;

        <name> <version>.<revision>

     ...is the preferred standard.  See %VER: for more information.
@endnode

@node 4713 "Section 4.7.13 -- %REC: (Recommended system setup)"

    @{b}4.7.13  %REC: (Recommended system setup)@{ub}

     This keyword should be used to tell the user what the recommended setup
    for this FILE is.  Many times users download things they cannot use with
    their particular system or have an inadequate system to use the software
    to its full extent.  This keyword should inform the user what the author
    recommends as a minimum to use it effectively.

     For example, a raytracing package will probably work without a FPU, but
    it is RECOMMENDED to have such a processor installed, otherwise you will
    have to wait days instead of hours.  Another example, a C compiler might
    be usable from floppy disk, but a harddrive is highly recommended due to
    the intense read/write operations performed by the compiler.

     Note though that this is a RECOMMENDATION, NOT a requirement.

       Examples:    %REC: 68020+, HD, FPU
                    %REC: 486DX2/66, SVGA/1MB

@node 4714 "Section 4.7.14 -- %REG: (Registration fee)"

    @{b}4.7.14  %REG: (Registration fee)@{ub}

     This keyword is intended for shareware software, where it's supposed to
    let the user know what a registration costs.  If possible, enter the fee
    in US dollars (US$).  That makes it easier for a user to convert the fee
    to his or her own currency.  You may use multiple currencies, but if you
    enter US$, always put it first on the line.  Separate with commas.

        Examples:   %REG: US$40
                    %REG: US$20, 35DM, 100SEK
                    %REG: 150SEK

@node 4715 "Section 4.7.15 -- %REP: (Replace files)"

    @{b}4.7.15  %REP: (Replace files)@{ub}

     This keyword is intended to provide a way to automatically remove older
    versions of a software, or simply notify the sysop that the old versions
    can be removed from the system.  For example you have just finished your
    latest version of your program MyGoodProgram, or MGP for short.  The new
    version is 1.2, and you are just about to start distributing it to local
    BBS's.  This latest version will probably succeed the previous versions,
    let's say you have released v1.0 and v1.1 earlier, which means that they
    are as obsolete as they're gonna get.  To automatically remove the older
    versions, add the following line in your file description;

        %REP: MGP10.ZIP MGP11.ZIP

     This way the author provides a way for a sysop to automatically replace
    the old versions with the new.  And by doing that, keeping his harddrive
    clean from obsolete, old, buggy, and otherwise unwanted files.

     Note also that this keyword allows you to enter multiple filenames with
    one or more spaces between them.  Filenames with spaces should be quoted
    to prevent any mistakes.  See examples.

        Examples:   %REP: WMAN122.ZIP WMAN123.ZIP
                    %REP: CUCUMBER.LZH
                    %REP: "NICE BIRDY.IFF" "NICE BIRD.BMP"

@node 4716 "Section 4.7.16 -- %REQ: (Required system setup)"

    @{b}4.7.16  %REQ: (Required system setup)@{ub}

     This keyword is used to let the user know what the MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
    for this particular FILE is.  If the software requires a particular kind
    of processor, amount of memory or something similar, enter it here.

        Examples:   %REQ: Amiga, 68020, 1 MB FAST RAM
                    %REQ: MSDOS 3.30, 80286, CGA
                    %REQ: Win95, 32MB RAM

@endnode

@node 4717 "Section 4.7.17 -- %REV: (Revision)"

    @{b}4.7.17  %REV: (Revision)@{ub}

     This keyword is a complement to the %VER: keyword.  This keyword should
    tell you the REVISION version, if applicable, of the software.

        Examples:    %VER: Spot 1.3 (16.8.94)
                     %REV: 37.4515

     This example taken from real life, means that this is Spot 1.3.  That's
    what is considered to be the RELEASE version.  In many cases this number
    is the same as the version of the actual software, but in this case it's
    the version of the entire package.  The actual REVISION version, of Spot
    in this case, is 37.4515.

@node 4718 "Section 4.7.18 -- %TYP: (Distribution type)"

    @{b}4.7.18  %TYP: (Distribution type)@{ub}

     This keyword tells the user if the author wants anything in return when
    you use the software.  Some authors wants money (Shareware), some settle
    for a postcard (Cardware) or a gift of some sort (Giftware).  Please try
    to fulfill the demands of the author.  Programs worth using are programs
    worth paying for.

     There are many types of "payment", involving money in some cases;

        ==[ TYPES ]=====================================================
        Public Domain - Free to use/sell/change without restrictions.
        Freeware      - Free to use without any kind of payment.
        Shareware     - You must pay a small fee to use the software.
        Crippleware   - The same as shareware, but less functionality
                        until you have paid for the software.
        Cardware      - The author wants a postcard as payment.
        Callware      - The author wants you to call his BBS as payment.
        Giftware      - The author wants a gift of some kind as payment.
        Charityware   - The author wants you to donate money to charity.
        ================================================================

        Examples:    %TYP: Giftware
                     %TYP: Charityware

@node 4719 "Section 4.7.19 -- %VER: (Version string)"

    @{b}4.7.19  %VER: (Version string)@{ub}

     This keyword should reflect the name, version and date of the software,
    if applicable.  Most programs should make use of this keyword.  You must
    always enter the information according to this format;

        <name> <version>.<revision> (<d>.<m>.<y>)

     Note also that <version>.<revision> must NOT include a leading "v".

        Examples:    %VER: Program 1.4 (6.11.94)
                     %VER: FaceIt 3.37 (12.1.1995)

    @{b}4.8  LIST OF LANGUAGES@{ub}

     This section contains a list of language-strings that you should use in
    the %DES: and %LAN: keywords.  Do NOT use anything else than the strings
    specified here, unless the language isn't IN the list.

        ==[ LANGUAGES ]=================================================
        Default             (English)     Use "Default", not "English"
        Locale                            Only used in the %LAN: keyword
        Dansk               (Danish)
        Deutsch             (German)
        Espanol             (Spanish)
        Francais            (French)
        Italiano            (Italian)
        Nederlands          (Dutch)
        Norsk               (Norwegian)
        Portugues           (Portuguese)
        Suomi               (Finnish)
        Svenska             (Swedish)
        ================================================================

     As you might have noticed, the strings used are the NATIVE form for the
    language.  So instead of "Swedish", use "Svenska".  The only changes are
    that accented characters has been replaced by their non-accented cousin.

     If YOUR native language isn't in the list, please tell me about it, and
    I will include it in the next release.  The listed languages should more
    or less be the most common, though.

     There is also a special language, named Elite, which only purpose is to
    provide a way for people to use ASCII logos and similar descriptions.  I
    also recommend that converted file_id.diz descriptions be placed in this
    "language".  Note that an implied %EXT: NOWRAP is used for this language
    because of its nature.

@node 51 "Section 5.1 -- Creating a file description"

    @{b}5.1  CREATING A FILE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     If your software allows users to create descriptions please inform them
    that they should refrain from using graphic or international characters.
    Not that it is impossible to handle, but translating the graphic borders
    from IBMPC to LATIN-1 is not standardized in any way...

     When saving the description, try to make sure that no single line in it
    exceeds the 80 chars "limit".  There is no limit to the line length, but
    for cosmetic and practical reasons 80 chars is better.  I don't want you
    to discard anything, but simply do not allow the user to enter more than
    80 chars.  Exception; the %DES: keyword, which you should wrap to fit in
    80 chars.  See @{" Section 4.5 " link 45} for more information on wrapping.

     If your software have created a description you should warn the user if
    there is no %DES: Default (DEFAULT description) present.  The DEFAULT is
    optional, but it @{i}should @{ui}really be present.

     When you create a file description, please make sure that you save the
    file in uppercase.  Case sensitive filesystems do exist you know.
@endnode

@node 52 "Section 5.2 -- Adding the description"

    @{b}5.2  ADDING THE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     When you add the description to a file, binary or ASCII, you should try
    to add it in the first or last part, preferably in the first or last 4K.
    This will make it easier to find, and also allow faster scanning on very
    large files.

     When you add a file description to an archive please make sure that the
    file is uppercased before adding it.  Case sensitive filesystems exists,
    so please think carefully about this.
@endnode

@node 53 "Section 5.3 -- Extracting the description"

    @{b}5.3  EXTRACTING THE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     Parsing software, which extracts and parses descriptions, should handle
    all filetypes; i.e. ARCHIVE files, TEXT files and BINARY files.  The two
    latter types are handled in the same manner, while the ARCHIVE type need
    access to the archiver (in most cases at least).

     When you scan a file, binary or ASCII, for a description, you should do
    a case insensitive search which allows your software to find HEADERs and
    FOOTERs which might be written in lowercase.  When writing a description
    to a textfile, ALWAYS write the HEADER and FOOTER in uppercase!

     Also, when adding the HEADER, try to precede it with a newline.  That's
    for making it easier to find, as it will begin fresh on a new line.  The
    newline sequence is CR+LF, or LF alone.

     For more "hands-on" experience, check out the FindDesc source.

     When scanning a file, binary or ASCII, you might want to scan the first
    and last 4K (4096 bytes) before scanning the bit in between.  This could
    be used especially for very large files, which otherwise would take some
    time to scan.  This is optional, but I recommend developers to add their
    descriptions to the first or last part of the file, so...

     Also note that you MUST support CR+LF or LF alone as newline!  FDS take
    other platforms into consideration, so this one is important.
@endnode

@node 54 "Section 5.4 -- Parsing the description"

    @{b}5.4  PARSING THE DESCRIPTION@{ub}

     When you encounter a %DES: keyword which has no language string, ignore
    it completely.  Same thing if the following row is another keyword.  You
    should act as if they weren't even there in these two cases.

     A description consists of a short description and an optional extended.
    In no situation could there be an extended description without the short
    description preceding it.

     Remember that the default charset used is LATIN-1 (ISO 8859-1), and you
    should be aware of the fact that you might have to translate the text in
    the descriptions.  For example, if the description contains %CHR: IBMPC,
    which is codepage 437, and you want the output in LATIN-1, you will have
    to translate any international characters.  I leave this to you...

     If your software is supposed to extract a certain language for a BBS, I
    recommend that you consider having a list of preferred languages that it
    could pick from.  For example in the nordic countries most languages are
    similar, so a Danish sysop might want to have a list of;

        Dansk
        Norsk
        Svenska
        Default
        Deutsch

     ...where he uses the Danish description if it exists.  If not, look for
    a Norwegian description, or a Swedish.  If neither of these exists, he'd
    like to use the default (English) description, or the German, if there's
    no default description either.  If none of the languages in the list are
    found, use the default description.  If there is no description, you are
    on your own...:)

     If you encounter a %DES: Elite, remember that you MUST NOT wordwrap the
    contents of it.  Also, using it for one-line (short) descriptions can be
    problematic, since it probably isn't formatted with FDS in mind.
@endnode

@node 55 "Section 5.5 -- Keywords in general"

    @{b}5.5  KEYWORDS IN GENERAL@{ub}

     Here are some general rules about how to handle the keywords.

        · Always put %DES: keywords at the top of the description.

        · Always put the DEFAULT description at the very top

        · Always write keywords in uppercase.

        · Allow parsing of lowercased keywords.

        · Parse each keyword, except %DES:, only once (first occurrence).

        · Ignore unknown keywords when parsing, but do NOT remove them.

        · End all description parsing when you encounter the %END: keyword.

        · Keywords are global, and applies to all languages.

        @{" %REP: " link 4715}
                     This keyword can be considered a dangerous keyword.  It
                    is intended to allow automatic removal of older versions
                    of a software, and thus it involves deleting files.  You
                    are aware of the potential danger this causes for sysops
                    who are running a BBS?  This means that if your software
                    acts upon this keyword you should provide the sysop with
                    some way to protect certain files.  Two tips;

                      · Don't allow deleting of delete-protected files.

                      · Use a list of files, which should never be deleted.

                     Also, this keyword could simply *NOTIFY* the sysop that
                    there is obsolete software in the system.  That way he'd
                    be able to authorize any automatic deletions.

@node 57 "Section 5.7 -- Keyword recognition"

    @{b}5.7  KEYWORD RECOGNITION@{ub}

     When checking for valid keywords, you should check for both the percent
    sign and the colon.  A keyword line ALWAYS begins with percent, ASCII 37
    decimal, in the first position.  If it doesn't; discard it right away.

     To make sure it really is a keyword though, you should check position 5
    too, where the colon, ASCII 58 decimal, should be.  If there is no colon
    there, discard the line, it doesn't contain a keyword.

@node 58 "Section 5.8 -- Keyword processing"

    @{b}5.8  KEYWORD PROCESSING@{ub}

     When you parse a keyword and its contents, remember that there MIGHT be
    a space between the colon and the contents.  This should be removed from
    the contents before parsing it.  In effect; strip away any leading space
    and tab characters.

     If/when your software writes a keyword line with contents, add a single
    space, ASCII 32 decimal, between the colon and the contents.  This makes
    it easier to read with the human eye.

     If you want to add support for the previous releases of the FDS, please
    take a look at the FDS-206 specifications, available from the author.  I
    don't think there would be too much hassle to incorporate support for it
    but that's up to each and everyone.

    @{b}5.10  CONVERTING FILE_ID.DIZ@{ub}

     If you convert a file_id.diz description, try to examine the percentage
    of actual alphanumeric characters.  If this percentage is below 60%, you
    should convert the description into a %DES: Elite description, and add a
    %EXT: NOWRAP after it.  Otherwise, save it as %DES: Default and skip the
    nowrap option.

@node 511 "Section 5.11 -- Date formatting"

     You should consider the following rules on date formats;

        · Dates always in <d>.<m>.<y> format.

        · Year may be in two- or four-digit format, write two-digit.

        · Allow leading zeros when reading, but do NOT write leading zeros.

    @{b}6.4  LAST WORDS@{ub}

     Finally!!  It has been almost a whole year since I began the rewrite of
    these specifications.  Many changes, and many long periods of time where
    I did absolutely NOTHING creative with it.  With this release I have now
    dropped support for the earlier releases.  FDS-310 is the NEW standard!!
    Well, the format has not changed that much, but some of the old backward
    compatibility is gone, unless developers really WANT to support it.

     Oh, by the way:  Sory four anny speling erorrs...:)


     -Live long and prosper!
