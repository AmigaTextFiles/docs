                              ANNOUNCEMENT

            We're a group of Amiga owners engaged in building the

                        INTERNATIONAL AMIGA SOCIETY (IAS)

           a world-wide association of Amiga practitioners, owners,
             developers, dealers and believers in the ideals and
           future of the Amiga platform. In view of past experiences
              and present-day circumstances we feel it necessary
                        to explore all possible ways
           of protecting our investment in money, time, skills and
            dedication and furthermore use available technologies
           to forge an intelligent and effective form of association
                       between all interested parties.
            Our first aim is to create a world-wide database of all
           existing user groups so we can communicate among ourselves
               with e-mail and/or mailing-lists and other devices.

                           We are herewith inviting
           everyone reading this to communicate our request to their
               user group and to send the following information:

                           1.SnailMail address
                           2.E-mail or BBS address/contact
                           3.Number of members

                       IAS-Register@artworks.apana.org.au

                For your consideration, we will then send you more
             detailed information about the organization and its plans.

             Groups or individuals representing groups who have access
               to internet  web-browsing can use our home-page at

           It is of uppermost importance for this database to be as complete
                    as possible so be so kind and answer ASAP.
