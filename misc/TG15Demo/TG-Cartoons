 giant turns out to be Dr. Keniculus 5, a master at genetics and cloning
 who is also acclaimed as a savior by the populace. With each new

  It is in this episode that we first see the Orion pirates. They've
 raided a Federation ship that happens to carry the drug the USS
 Enterprise needs to save Spock's life. Kirk finds the severely
 ravaged ship and trails the Orions where he makes every effort to 
 regain the drug, Strobolin. He makes a deal with the Orion captain
 to meet on a nearby asteroid and trade dilithium crystals for the 
 Strobolin. As expected, Orion treachery complicates matters and 
 Kirk must go one-on-one with the Orion captain.

 calling into question Bem's nature. It turns out that Bem is a colony
 creature made up of several independently moving parts. He interferes
 with Kirk's mission just enough to get himself captured in order to 
 observe how Kirk handles the situation. Complication matters is the 
 world's protective alien entity that uses the planet as a living 
 laboratory to raise the inhabitants. In the end, a series of mis-
 understandings gives way to fresh knowledge and everyone departs 
 with a lesson learned.

  A mysterious probe studies Earth and then beams a signal into deep
 space and the Enterprise is assigned to track the signal and find out
 what's happening. The alien race populated Earth centuries ago. In 
 fact, they did so in South America and were recorded in Mayan legend
 as Quetzalcoatl and Kukulkan. The crew must find a way to properly 
 communicate with the arrogant race to protect and nuture. 

  Note this episodes similarities to Star Trek IV-The Voyage Home.

  This episode introduces us to Captain Robert April, the first captain
 of the Enterprise. Now nearing retirement age of 75, April and his 
 wife prepare for one final mission to Babel. The crew then encounters
 beings from a negitive universe. As a result, everyone begins growing 
 younger until the heros are babies and the now youthful April must 
 take command once again. The transports save the day again as every-
 one is beamed through them in order to return to their correct age.
