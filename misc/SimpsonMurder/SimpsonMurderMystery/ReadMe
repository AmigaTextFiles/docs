The program and its data (graphics and soundfiles) are Freeware. You may
copy it freely, however you are not allowed to spread any altered version
of it. PD-Distributors are allowed to crunch the package, as long as they
supply all files (including this text).
In adition, I would ask you to notify me when offering this program in your
PD-series. You are not required to do so, but I would like to keep track of
who is distributing it and whom to sent future updates. My address:

"The Simpson Murder Mystery" is an AmigaGuide Document which uses Multiview
to display its graphics and sound-samples, which means you need OS3.0 or
higher to run it.

The program expects Multiview in the Utilities-Drawer of your
boot-disk/partition. (Without a harddrive, boot from your Workbench-Disc.)
The graphics and samples are loaded from the current directory.
So if you launch it from CLI, be sure to enter the correct directory before.

I also might add that in order to display the 8-color graphics correctly,
you should at least use a 16-color Workbench Screen or the the number of
colors will be reduced.
