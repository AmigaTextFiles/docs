@NODE PROFILE "O. J. Simpson Profile"
@{b}Orenthal James Simpson - A Profile@{Ub}

Born in 1947 as the third of four children in a poor neighbourhood of San
Francisco, Simpson soon becomes a member of a local gang, the "Superiours".
When only 15 years old, he even spends some time in jail. But three years
later, he has become one of the most famous football players ever. O, J. -
Number 32. He stays nine years with the Buffalo Bills, then plays for
the San Francisco 49ers. Following his professional football career he
starts a new career as an actor, starring in movies like "Naked Gun",
"Towering Inferno" and "Capricorn One". He also appears in commercials
for "Hertz" and  "True Sweet" Orange Juice. Soon he is known as O. J. -
The Juice.

He and his first wife Marguerite get divorced in 1979, two years after
he first met 18 year old Nicole Brown, who later becomes his second wife.
After their marriage he starts battering her. She @{"calls 911" LINK 911CALL} more than nine
times. In 1992 they get divorced, but still spend considerable time
together. Shortly before the killings, they agree to seperate for a second
time, as O. J. points out in @{"The Letter" LINK LETTER} read by Robert Kardashian.

@NODE MURDER "The Murder"
@{b}The Day of the Murder@{Ub}
Sunday, June 12

Nicole Brown Simpson spends the afternoon with her ex-husband, later dines
at her favourite restaurant "Mezzaluna", where her friend Ronald Goldman
is working as a waiter.

Later this evening, Goldman hears that Nicole´s mother has left behind her
glasses. He volunteers to take them to Nicole.

O. J. Simpson plans to leave on a trip to Chicago this evening. He and a
friend go out for a Hamburger with Simpson´s Rolls-Royce. They return
from Mc Donald´s at 9.40.
The Limousine Driver who is to take O. J. to the airport arrives at
Simpson´s estate at about 10.25. Since no one appears to be home, he
waites till 10.40 before ringing the intercom buzzer. No one answers. At
about the same time, a friend of O. J. who stays at the guest house hears
a strange, scaring noise. In the Preliminary Hearing he describes what he
heared. @{"Play Sample" SYSTEM "Sys:Utilities/Multiview Noise.8SVX"} After a few minutes he graps a flashlight and goes
out to investigate.
At his point the Limousine Driver spots someone inside the compound carrying
a flashlight. Almost simultaniously he sees a black person, about 6 feet 
tall, @{"crossing the driveway" SYSTEM "Sys:Utilities/Multiview SimpsonEstate1.ILBM"} towards the house. Less than a minute later,
O. J. answers the intercom, claiming he has overslept and just got out of
the shower.
Searching for the source of the noise, O. J.´s friend @{"reaches the driveway" SYSTEM "Sys:Utilities/Multiview SimpsonEstate2.ILBM"}
the moment the Limousine is driving in.
Minutes later, O. J. heads for the airport for his long scheduled flight
to Chicago.

At midnight, a neighbour of Nicole Brown Simpson follows a dog which leads
her to a body near a sidewalk leading to Nicole Simpson´s residence.
Police find a second body, both of them lying in a river of blood. Nicole
Simpson suffered knife-wounds on her arms, apperantly from fighting her
attacker. Her black dress is soaped with blood. Paw trails are found,
leading away from her.
Near Ronald Goldman´s body, police find an envelope containing Nicole
Simpson´s mother´s glasses. Also found, a set of keys, a cap, and a single 
leather glove.
Inside the house, still sleeping, Nicole and O. J. Simpson´s small children.
Later, Pablo Fenjves, a neighbour of Nicole, will recall having heared a
dog bark at about 10.15. Another neighbour, Steven Schwab, had even spotted
a lonely dog, noticing that it had blood on its paws.

Police quickly rush to O. J. Simpson´s estate to, as they now claim, notify
him of the killings. Detective Mark Fuhrman spots a small blood-stain on
Simpson´s Ford Bronco. As Police decide to go in without a search warrant,
Fuhrman jumps the wall and opens the hydraulic gate. It is also Fuhrman who
discovers the bloody glove behind the guest house.

When Simpson returns from Chicago the next morning, he is handcuffed and
taken downtown for questioning. Police discover a cut on Simpson´s left
middle finger. He claims he cut his finger on a broken glass in Chicago
after learning of the killings. After three hours he is released.

@NODE CHASE "The Chase"
@{b}O. J. - The Fugitive@{Ub}
Friday, June 17

At about 8 am this morning police notify Simpson Attorney Robert Shapiro
that they are going to file charges and that Simpson has to surrender to
authorities. The time is set for 11 am, later revised to 11.45. As O. J.
does not show up, police want to pick him up at his house - but Simpson
has disappeared.

This afternoon L.A.P.D. is holding a @{"Press Conference" LINK PRESS}. Cmdr. David
Gascon drops the bombshell: He announces that police were now actively
searching for O. J. Simpson. @{"Play Sample" SYSTEM "Sys:Utilities/Multiview Gascon.8SVX"}

The drama continues to unfold as Simpson friend Robert Kardashian reads a
@{"Letter" LINK LETTER} from O. J. before the press.

What follows are more than two and a half hours of high drama. Several
million Americans watch it live as a white Ford Bronco is chased by dozens
of police cars and 14 police and news helicopters. Behind the wheel: Al
Cowlings; in the back of the car: O. J. Simpson. Cowlings makes a 911 call
to police. @{"Play Sample" SYSTEM "Sys:Utilities/Multiview Cowlings.8SVX"} As they arrive at Simpson´s estate in Brentwood,
Simpson demands to speak to his mother. Only then he agrees to surrender
and is taken into custody. Searching the white Ford Bronco, police find
$ 10.000 in O. J.´s pocket, O. J.´s passport, a gun and a false beard.
@ENDNODE CHASE

@NODE LETTER "The Alleged Suicide Note"
@{b}"To Whom It May Concern..."@{Ub}
Friday, June 17

While police are searching for O. J., Simpson friend Robert Kardashian
reads the 700 word long letter Simpson has sent him before disappearing:

To whom it may concern.

First, everyone understand, I have nothing to do with Nicole´s murder.
I loved her, always have, and always will. If we had a problem, it´s
because I loved her so much. Recently we came to the understanding that
for now we were not right for each other. At least for now. Despite
our love we were different, and that´s why we mutually agreed to go
our seperate ways. It was tough splitting for a second time, but we
both knew that it was for the best. Inside I had no doubt that in the
future we would be close friends or more. Unlike what has been written
in the press, Nicole and I had a great relationship for most of our lives
together. Like all long-term relationships, we had a few downs and ups.
... 
I can´t go on. No matter what the outcome, people will look and point.
I can´t take that. I can´t subject my children to that. This way they can
move on and go on with their lives. Please think of the real O. J. and
not this lost person.
Peace and love.
O. J.

@NODE EVIDENCE "The Evidence"
@{b}Some of the Evidence Introduced During the Preliminary Hearing@{Ub}

 @{b}The Cut@{Ub}               Police find a cut on Simpson´s left middle finger
                       which he says he suffered from a broken glass after
                       learning of the killings. There was no matching
                       slice found on the bloody glove found at the
                       crimescene.

 @{b}The Knife@{Ub}             Testifying during the Preliminary Hearing, the
                       owner of "Ross Cutlery", where O. J. Simpson bought
                       a knife six weeks before the killings.

 @{b}The Mystery Envelope@{Ub}  A sealed envelope produced by the defense during
                       the Preliminary Hearing. Its contents is unknown,
                       however it is widely believed that it contains the
                       knife Simpson bought at "Ross Cutlery" six weeks
                       before the murder.

 @{b}The Pair of Gloves@{Ub}    One bloody glove is found at the crimescene, near
                       Ron Goldman´s body. Its right counterpart turns up
                       on Simpson´s property, found by Detective Mark
                       Fuhrman behind the guesthouse, just under the air
                       conditioner.
