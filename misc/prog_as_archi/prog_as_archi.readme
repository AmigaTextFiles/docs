Short: LaTeX: Architect vs. Programmer
Type: text/misc
Uploader: s_walter@irav1.ira.uka.de (Thomas Baetzler)

    Here's the LaTeX'ed version of a short spoof detailing what would
happen if architects were forced to work like programmers.

    Other texts are scheduled to follow as soon as I get around to typeset
them.

Have fun!
