This is my complete log. Unaltered other than editing out my private messages,
reformatting of text to make it readable (ever try reading an AmIRC log?), and
adding html tags top and bottom. I missed the beginning of both days. I started
logging at 1:15pm the 11th and 10:26am the 12th. If anyone has those times logged
I would really appreciate a copy of them.

HMetal    |Hah.  I'll bet..
d         |etherius  saw the same here.. seems to be a dead issue on the 
          |TeamONE ml.
d         |etherius  nobody cares anymore.
_ego      |Seems to me thats a problem PIOS has at the moment
etherius  |I thought maybe AInc would have used it, once.
_ego      |It doesn't seem to have been THAT much of an improvement.
d         |AmigaInc has an os.. same for AROS.. what would you want using 
          |something you don't control.
etherius  |If PIOS seemed like part of the family, I'd care.  They've always 
          |seemed like a bunch of anti Phase5 anti Amiga Intl. whiners.
HMetal    |What's the URL for the cam again?

etherius  |If there weren't so many legal hassles, and i found myself owning 
          |Amiga, then BUYING ProDad, Phase5 and PIOS would have been cool.
HMetal    |good afternoon Mr. Krueger. :)
_ego      |etherius: WEll there are plenty of Amiga people who aren't fond 
          |of P5.  Or Amiga International for that matter
d         |etherius  Haynie also has severe reservations about using 
          |multimedia chips as gen purpose CPUs.  The one's he know anyway.  
          |He's not a party to the NDA.
etherius  |I think many of us wish the market could support all of them, 
          |somehow.

HMetal    |d: If Dave were privy to the NDA/info, then he could make a more 
          |informed analysis.
_ego      |I think that AInc should do whats commercially viable rather than 
          |try to incorporate every fringe element
«Nick»    |Xcal-Tech is now known as Delta.
d         |HMetal  yeah, but he sure blew just about everything we do know 
          |(exists now) out of the water.
tamaron   |yeah for the standard ainc should control but creativity is what 
          |makes the amiga
etherius  |tamaron:  I have a CSPPC, and it's a great piece of hardware, 
          |with software which is steadily improving.  AInc. should find the 
          |best possible use for Phase5 in the Amiga's future.
HMetal    |d: I wouldn't expect less from Mr. H. :)
dave_c    |g'morning Ray
HMetal    |Hey Dave(C) :)
CyberWolf |Hi everybody! I've just joined. So what's the latest AMIAG news

dave_c    |shoot it!
RobSDA    |tamaron:  Don't forget Access Innovations with the Access and

d         |tamaron  I think Pios has be very best PPC sans 68K solution.. 
          |better than macs.  But AmigaInc doesn't want PPC.

Lambertus |Oi... how to get into the queue?  Just a question.
Lambertus |oi
dave_c    |their guest (in amiwest98) is Branko Carija from BrainTech
d         |_ego  hope we don't independence ourselves from a viable system.
etherius  |The market can expand.
d         |etherius  if MMR Amigas fly is may well explode.  And goodie for 
          |that.
etherius  |Hope so.  I still want to see a REAL Amiga portable someday.

redteo    |all: any news?
Lambertus |erm...  The cam seems to show that my question was not 
          |understood...
etherius  |MMC got switched to MMR, I guess. Stands for Multimedia Risc
d         |remember guys.. if MMR is five times faster than a Pentium its 
          |over four times faster than PPC.
Riley     |who's brainchild is this Multimedia Risc chip then?

d         |Havemose said there will probably be some hardware emulation

_ego      |AAlley: No, its predictable.  It broke about 3 times yesterday :)
CyberWolf |d: Can you tell me more about this Multimedia RISC?
AAlley    |It never worked at all for me.
Myste     |So.. Any official news?
_ego      |No
AAlley    |I've rewritten the code, but to no avail.
d         |Riley  not much more to tell.. the same stale numbers 400M

          |high teck consulting firm.. Alphametric, Inc.  (yes they have a 
          |website)
_ego      |Riley: That was the info from AInc last month
RaTTleR   |URL?

          |without AmigaOS.  People don't mention that much.

RMerlin   |*I* mentionned the 1 Ghz bus last night as an example of an 
          |already existing fast bus :)
_ego      |etherius: The sort of things that they are quoting wouldn't be 
          |greatly affected by an OS
tamaron   |i love senarios
_ego      |RMerlin: Well if you said it, it MUST be true ;)
RMerlin   |Keep on rumormonging guys :)
AAlley    |RMer: Well, you know that in the absence of accurate rumors, we 
          |will invent our own:)
d         |Riley Unknown.. they consult with a lot high tech businesses and 
          |with startups.
tamaron   |it is all in fun
d         |RMerlin  I asked last night for clarification and didn't get 
          |that.. thanks for the info.
Riley     |d: so nothing really SOLID came up last night?

d         |Riley  not that we got, Bill McEwen didnt show like he said he 
          |would after the banquet.
etherius  |_ego:  If it is something like ProjectX, which has DVD for less 
          |than the cost of other DVD chipsets, then it will have a nice 
          |market penetration.  Why not have an OS run on such a chip
Riley     |d: argh...i should've known...
tamaron   |he had too much ale
Riley     |d: who mentioned this Alphametric then?
d         |Riley there was also some hinkey thing about none of this info 
          |getting out of the Amiga community.
_ego      |etherius: No reason at all.  My point is that the stats being 
          |quoted would be largely unaffected by an OS.  Since  no OS runs 
          |on the chip currently they can hardly do comparisons

_ego      |laire: The proposed new Amiga isn't intended to be just a desktop 
          |computer
Riley     |d: sounds like some conspiracy...;-))
etherius  |laire:  I know, but if it truly is a scalable design, does it 
          |matter?
laire     |ego: del "just" and you`re correct
«OP»      |AmiPPC gives channel operator status to VideoTeck

Lambertus |hmm...
tamaron   |rotfl
_ego      |RMerlin: The answer then is to pay for development yourself.  If 
          |you don't you won't get something thats specifically for you. ;)

tamaron   |i am typing on thr fridge now

tamaron   |:>
d         |Riley  I think they're dancing dangerously close to an NDA, tring

d         |_ego  the *appearance* of impropriety and all that..

AmigaMMC  |True: Hi Tim, what's up!

Dozer     |sadams: have you ever used it?
TheCat_   |I won't buy another Amiga is it does not support MIDI out of the

Ecyrd     |Plush: Well, it was always intended to be fast and easy to use.

pekr      |OS kernel? Does choosing OS kernel takes so loooong?
JT        |fibbsy: until then someone should work on the Os and know

[X_MaN]   |Onebit:well Squid has rebuilt the Moo Bunny, its much faster 
          |there now, and the JMS now has a version to be used for 
          |Ads/HelpCalls/Support etc... Donated by Squid
[X_MaN]   |JT:It was a joke:)
fibbsy    |question queue is empty in #amiwest98 .. i'm strongly tempted to 
          |ask "which do you prefer.. undies or boxers?" hehe
VideoTech |pekr: you cant just pick a kernal and say "I want that one" ;D
JT        |until november the whole OS should have be done, they said at 
          |woa...
[X_MaN]   |JT:thats being optimistic to say the least, the basic outline 
          |might be done by then, with some small functionality, but whole 
          |os?  No chance...
fibbsy    |pekr: they said they hope to have made the decision on the kernal 
          |by the end of the month. They've got it down to three.. BeOS, 
          |Linux and JavaOS we think. :)
Riley     |the OS4 yes
Zer0      |Riley should be glad I use Netscape 3 and It have crashed about 9
