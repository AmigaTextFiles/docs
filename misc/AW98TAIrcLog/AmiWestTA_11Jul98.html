<CENTER><H1><a href="http://wordbench.com/dfd/">DFDuck's</a> #AmiWestTA IRC Conference Logs 11-Jul-98</H1></CENTER>

This is my complete log. Unaltered other than editing out my private messages,
reformatting of text to make it readable (ever try reading an AmIRC log?), and
adding html tags top and bottom. I missed the beginning of both days. I started
logging at 1:15pm the 11th and 10:26am the 12th. If anyone has those times logged
I would really appreciate a copy of them.

_ego      |TheBarron: Even when they do deny rumours people don't believe 
          |them. ;)
asha      |TheBarron: Bill McEwen and Gary talked about that and he'll tell 
          |you what they know later
Jkay      |well well!
Hawker    |CyborJim: I believe you mean the Somerset design center...
Merko     |CyborJim: But is it ALL the plants, or just this new joint 
          |IBM/Mot one?
Womble    |TheBarron: They probably don't want to dignify it with a response
asha      |Womble: More likely :)
PUNA      |the devil's in the details
asha      |Trying to defuse rumors can be an exercise in futility
CyborJim  |According to the news story I saw even though IBM makes several 
          |servers with the PowerPC CPU they will otherwise get out of the 
          |PowerPC CPU business.

          |any.. so I'll have to get a new one.
asha      |CyborJim: Bet they'll move to another chip as well.  PPC seems

          |did and hasn't heard anything internally about it other than it 
          |is a rumor started on the stock market becuase Gateway looks like

CyborJim  |In May I was working agian on a story I'm trying to write.  In

          |happen, but not this year.
Drool     |_ego: I will be starting on 2.0 this week. Will be MUI. Add 
          |CD-Player support, and some new features.

Womble    |Wizardess: This is intended to be a direct replacement for that.

portnoy   |Man I'd like to have Java, too many web sites demand it
Ratleto   |all I need to know is when the next announcement is coming..
RMerlin   |Ice cream break, brb
Womble    |Wizardess: Is it really possible to have a block size of, say, 
          |1536 bytes?
«Nick»    |RMerlin is now known as RM_Away.
snapper   |NiteFlite: There is absolutely no doubt that Allan Havermose will 
          |build a really neet new Amiga and OS..... what happens after that 
          |is the question
Toast     |Any news?
Wizardess |No - but if some filesystem ever DOES support that RDPrepX will 
          |handle it.
Womble    |Wizardess: Ah, OK ;-)
NiteFlite |snapper: Do you think Allan may just push Jeff out as the force 
          |for the new Amiga, relegating Jeff to purchasing paper clips?
Wizardess |I *think* it will even handle oddball sizes like 180 byte 
          |Burroughs disks.
Wizardess |However, no known filesystem will touch that other than the 
          |Burroughs file systems for obsolete machines.

Toast     |Looks like Havemose is calling the shots now...
Wizardess |Sounds like a plan, snapper.
snapper   |NiteFLite Allan is head of enginering, Jeff is head of Amiga 
          |Inc.... Jeff isnt designing or building anything
fibbs     |Datatypes are great. I like datatypes. Next generation datatypes 
          |in OS 4.0/5.0 woould be cool.
Wizardess |(Havemose is someone I rather admire.)
Wizardess |I bet it gets boring in that room at night.
NiteFlite |Allan is very nice, got to speak to him for 15 minutes in 
          |Toronto.
Womble    |Um, Jeff Schindler is General Manager.... quite a different job 
          |from being a technical manager
Lambertus |Ratleto: an hour and 45 mins
fibbs     |snapper: head of engineering? I thought he was in charge of OS 
          |development
Womble    |I spoke to Allan for a while in London
«Nick»    |RM_Away is now known as RMerlin.
Toast     |Isn't Sassenrath going to have a say on the new os?
Womble    |Toast: Not so far as we know.
Ratleto   |oh shit...then it'll be 6 am here
Womble    |Toast: He's not being paid by AInc
Wizardess |Say probably not. Input I would suspect so.

Ratleto   |oh..ok

          |reason for that, Allan Havermose is head of engineering, he is 
          |solely responsible for the new machine, design, architecture and

Womble    |RMerlin: 1.0, aka "0.1ß"
snapper   |RMerlin by first of the year t shouldbe around 30
RMerlin   |He wanted to go with SMP
Womble    |RMerlin: More like, he didn't like CBM's management
portnoy   |It used to be run on a standard VLab, last I heard
RMerlin   |Womble: Oh, he would have liked them if they had told him "Yes, 
          |go ahead with whatever you're planning" ;)
DFDuck    |portnoy: The above is what Casey told me.
Womble    |RMerlin: I'm interested by your mention of SMP, though. How would 
          |that work?
Wizardess |Email it - what controller do you use? (I'll catch it later 
          |tonite.)
Wizardess |jdow@bix.com
snapper   |Yes well why Carl left the first time has been translated by many 
          |people over the years.... the truth is somewhat subjective at 
          |this point and totally meaningless anyway
RMerlin   |Womble: You'd have to ask him.  He just told us one night that he 
          |figured that now that he had achieved multitasking, next logical 
          |step was multiprocessing.
Zeqk      |I know it's unfashionable for an Amiga user to appreciate C=, but 
          |realistically, they did more for the Amiga (aside from the 
          |creators) than anyone else has!
Wizardess |(Briefly how does RDPrepX fail on your system?)
snapper   |But historically Carl doenlt do the same thing for much more than 
          |3 years at a pass
Womble    |RMerlin: Sounds quite tricky given the highly integrated nature 
          |of the original Amiga architecture.
portnoy   |DFDuck: I thought it was the setup that tekmage did, it was 
          |running on a regular V-Lab
RMerlin   |Womble: During the 1.x days it  would have been easier.
Womble    |Zeqk: That doesn't mean that another company wouldn't have done 
          |better if they'd bough it
RMerlin   |Womble: Less legacy code/hardware to accomodate.
Toast     |Carl ought to get his act toghether and get us out of this mud

RMerlin   |Humm... Some people need to know what Sassenreath REALLY did in 
          |AmigaOS.
Wizardess |Well, Womble, word I heard was that they sorta had but could not 
          |get C= management to market it.
RMerlin   |Do you REALLY think he single-handledly designed and wrote 
          |AmigaOS 1.0?
RMerlin   |All he did was exec
Womble    |Wizardess: In AAA?
Wizardess |RJ was there. So were dozens of others.
RMerlin   |Exactly.
Wizardess |No not AAA. SOmething different.
RMerlin   |Luck and Mical had as much to do with what AmigaOS was.
Womble    |RMerlin: Well, all the rest of it was a bunch of quick hacks ;-)
Toast     |We could need  a guru like Jobs, Petro just doesn't have the 
          |charm :)
Wizardess |THey looked at putting it all on CMOS I hear. Got a prelim but 
          |never went farther.
RMerlin   |Womble: I think Mical did a great job back then with Intuition.
Womble    |Wizardess: Seems to me that CBM must have been crippled by having 
          |those big expensive but outdated factories used for making C64 
          |stuff. is that right?
Jkay      |Toast: the term is "Evangelist"

RMerlin   |NorthWay: The real Amiga DOS that wasn't used?
NorthWay  |rm: yeah
Jkay      |Petro has no charm? He could charm the pants off an Amish

Womble    |Carl said CAOS was done by an outside firm and was a lot like 
          |Unix
RMerlin   |Womble: Put yourself back in the 1984 context.  back then, it was 
          |peeing all over MacOS's stuff.
snapper   |RJ passed intuition on fairly early just like every other module

Womble    |RMerlin: Graphically it was more flexible... but you had to make 
          |everything yourself instead of using something easy like ResEdit
Jkay      |Wizardess: is that legal in your state?
Womble    |Wizardess: Well, isn't that what "Amiga Classic" technology is 
          |now? :-(
RMerlin   |Womble: ToolMaker was supposed to be the answer to that.

Womble    |RMerlin: I heard about that...

NiteFlite |I remember paying $800 for my 500.  Sigh.

Jkay      |Wizardess:  was the the one with Jimi Hendrix?
NorthWay  |Wizardess: got any SeekRat DevCon notes to share? :)
Wizardess |Nope - 1.1 came out somewhat later.
d9090     |Feb 1986 $1299 for 1000...
Womble    |Wizardess: Who exactly got 1.0? Wasn't that basically a developer 
          |release?
Wizardess |(I even managed to corral some 29.x disks. {^_-})
Zeqk      |Bought mine in 87'...i remember people saying...what do you need 
          |that kind of graphic capability for? It's a toy!
NorthWay  |Wizardess: btw, 0.97 is doing the rounds
Wizardess |Nope - came on the first Amigas.
RMerlin   |Wizardess: 1.1's version is nov-85, I guess it got released 
          |around january then
DFDuck    |I started using Amiga in '85 too. But didn't have my own till 
          |'86. And have never looked back.
d9090     |I've got 1.0
RMerlin   |Wizardess: I have v27 stuff here :)
NorthWay  |I mean 29, not 0.97
Ratleto   |hm.. I payed $625 for my A500 in june 88
Womble    |RMerlin: Wow....
RMerlin   |Won't run with UAE - too old
Wizardess |It came out a month or two after I got 1.0. IT was a BIG 
          |improvement. And 1.2 was an even bigger improvement. And 2.04 was 
          |actually stable.
snapper   |Quite a while as long as you didnlt drag a window inside out ;)
Zeqk      |The wedge cases C= was so fond of were silly...and 
          |expensive....C= was a really weird company (but i think, in 
          |hindsight, that was about the only charm they had)
Wizardess |Minutes - hour - depends on what you did.
NorthWay  |rm: heh. that's actually quiet funny
Womble    |Wizardess: YEah, I noticed that it took 5 years to get the damn 
          |thing stable
RMerlin   |NorthWay: Does V27 have the buffered trackdisk.device?
d9090     |I could get an hour out of Graphicraft.. if you stayed away from 
          |the synthesizer section, bout the same in Musicraft
Wizardess |Ah yes - I remember that little trick!
NorthWay  |rm: never could check. UAE crash&burn
RMerlin   |NorthWay: Resource it :)
snapper   |Ya and it;s taken The AT bouys 5 months to make it unstable
Womble    |RMerlin: Any idea why it doesn't work with UAE?

Womble    |snapper: Yes, and so is the 1.3 ROM at the beginning of the A3000 
          |SKS
Zeqk      |Northway: well some people refer to the processor as Mitchie (Jay 
          |Miners Executive Assistant..er dog)

Kreton    |Thr A1000 only has 256k rom ram thingy
Womble    |NorthWay: Ah, well

d9090     |NorthWay that was one of my suggestions in c.s.a.m some time

Womble    |Kreton: Where's the problem?
NorthWay  |the A1000 WOM can be hacked form 256K to 512K
Kreton    |If someone has a kickstart disk for a1000 DMS it and send it to 
          |me
Womble    |NorthWay: Yes, by installing new chips and stuff...
snapper   |Womble I don;tthink so, it has the scsi module which is pretty

Womble    |snapper: No, the 1.3 ROM image doesn't have that - it's the same 
          |as the one used on the A500, which will work on the A1000

Womble    |Zeqk: All A1000s have that, AFAIK.

DFDuck    |I thought they all had it too. Never seen one that didnt'.
NorthWay  |all 1000s had the signatures
Womble    |snapper: I have a disk image I was sent my a helpful IRCer, that 
          |is supposed to be an A3000 SKS disk image, that has both 1.3 and 
          |2.0 (v36) ROM images on it
snapper   |and the 1.3 module HAS to have the scsi module, how do you thing 
          |it reads the scsi hard drive.... tin cans and string ?
Kreton    |My A1000 is a signature one
d9090     |CyborJim.. even better on the 128D with the RAM card.  :-)  
          |Everything but GeoPublish could use the 80 columns.  Very nice on

Zeqk      |I bought a 1080 monitor a while back for $15...i was really proud 
          |of myself...
Womble    |snapper: Possibly if you load the 256K 1.3 image, the scsi module 
          |from the onboard 1.4 ROM is used
d9090     |oops.. all 1000's have signatures in the top case.. even 
          |Mitchie's paw print.
CyborJim  |d9090: I agree.  They said GEOS made the C128 compairable to the 
          |origional Mac, and I agree.
snapper   |The onboard rom doesn;t have a scsi image, it only has a small 
          |amount of code to fine the disk image and not a full scsi driver 
          |or FS
d9090     |FWIW, I have an autograph from Jay Miner on an UltraCard v1.o 
          |disk..
Zeqk      |CyborJim: Better than the original mac if you ask me...

snapper   |The boot rom that is
Womble    |snapper: On the early A3000s, the onboard ROM is a full 1.4 ROM,

          |not sure of the details.
Zeqk      |maybe you hold down both mouse buttons like on an a1200?
DFDuck    |Hold both mouse buttons down I think.

Womble    |RMerlin: Making a web browser compatible with things like Netrape

RMerlin   |Rebbi: I think I'll rather try to betatest Opera, and do my job

Nite_Hawk |None of the other SGIs do anyways, atleast not directly to the

          |Zorro X, afaik.
DFDuck    |d9090: Dunno.. I ignore WoA as much as I possibly could. Been 
          |listing to Amiga rumers so long I just don't listen much anymore.
DFDuck    |I gave up listening to Amiga rumers somewhere around '86 ¦)

ActiveLow |d9090: I mean something proprietary that'll cost more to 
          |develop/build.....I'd like to stick with standard bus'es....I'd 
          |assume this "great cpu" needs a bus with alot of bandwidth 
          |though...

d9090     |I'm presuming there's a difference getween 1.2Gbits (datastream) 
          |and 1.xGHz (bus)  Just want to clarify.

ActiveLow |d9090: hell I'd be happy to have a few working old ISA slots, I 
          |have a ton of good cheap ISA cards I'd like to use, ie network, 
          |etc...
d9090     |The price of the bridge system went up some ($1300 now) but MMC 
          |or MMR systems will still start at something extremely low.. 
          |$500, so the cost of the bus is probably a nonissue.
d9090     |ActiveLow  with a good enough CPU and throughput, you could do 
          |ISA type things in software (modems, networking)

ActiveLow |D9090: True, but if there's no RJ45 jack built in...8-).... I 
          |just looked at a copy of the 3000+ specs, it had a cool 2.5Mbps 
          |Token passing networking interface that ran over telephone cable, 
          |kinda cool...

d9090     |ActiveLow.. there'll be 1394.. an adapter perhaps..  If software 
          |modems are in the cards, so are RJ45 jacks, logically.
