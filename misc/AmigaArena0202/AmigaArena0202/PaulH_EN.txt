 *Please introduce yourself to the readers!*

 Well, I'm a 27 year old full time computer programmer, working for a small
 company just outside of London (UK). I mainly write databases and stand
 alone packages for larger businesses around London.

 *When did you start working with the Amiga?*

 I started with an A500 back when I was about 14 or so, previously I had a
 Commodore 64.

 *Which Amiga model do you own*

 A1200- 68040 PPC240 BVision, Mediator.

 *Which version of the operating system is running on your computer?*

 OS3.9 BB2

 *Which software are you developing?*

 Sid4Amiga (Yes it's in development again)
 MemIcon
 Playsid emulation library
 Various other bits and pieces.

 *Can you tell us what your software is about?*

 Well Sid4Amiga is a commodore 64 sound player, along with the emulation
 library to replace the ageing standard the 'playsid.library'.
 MemIcon is a memory, clock, screen info display for OS3.5 and above.

 *What has created the idea in you to continue developing your software?*

 The simple fact is no matter how much I use my PC at work and home I can
 never get away from using my Amiga. I think the OS, although lacking many
 features, is one of the nicest ever developed. As I still use the machine
 I still have the urge to continue developing.

 *How long has the development taken so far?*

 I've been developing stuff since the beginning. Sid4Amiga really started in
 1999/2000. MemIcon after the Cologne show in 2000. I don't have much time
 these days, so development is a lot slower than I'd like.

 *Which software are you using for developing?*

 StormC V3 (PPC/68K) - best bit of software I've purchased for my machine.

 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*

 AmigaOS and AmigaDE. (VP code in the AmigaDE is great).

 *Which OS will you support in the future?*

 Well most certainly now it will be OS4. I have ordered an Amiga One SE in
 order to continue developing. So, fingers crossed, things will start going
 right in the Amiga Market(?!) now.

 *What can we expect of future versions?*

 I've got some great things already in place for Sid4Amiga - I just need some
 beta testers to help debug the new package (mail me please). A new version
 of MemIcon should also be available soon.

 *Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the small amount
  of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?*

 Not really. I get a buzz out of getting things out of my Amiga even if no
 one else appreciates it!

 *Do you receive enough feedback for your software?*

 Yes I did initially - though lately the feedback has been far between.

 *When did you last use your Amiga?*

 I'm using it now!

 *Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?*

 ermmm.. tricky, it was probably Shogo or Miami DX.

 *Which software do you still use?*

 Storm C, Yam, IBrowse, Voyager, loads of stuff.

 *Which hard/software are you planning to buy?*

 Well I've just ordered a new Amiga One SE - does that count? Software -
 hopefully OS4 to go with it!!!

 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*

 I guess after all this time I've got to say 'yes'. I think the comeback will
 still be slow though. Amiga, Eyetech and Hyperion have a lot of work to do
 in both the classic and DE market.

 *Your final words for the readers?*

 Support your developers, enjoy life and smile! :) Cheers!
