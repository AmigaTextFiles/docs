SPREAD THE WORD:

	"The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet is now available,
	 in a variety of easily convertible formats *and*
	 at your local laser printer."


			-=- * -=-

	* WHAT IS BIG DUMMY'S GUIDE?

   This is still the first Texinfo edition of a book entitled "Big
Dummy's Guide to the Internet" (aka "bdgtti.texi") written by
Adam Gaffin for a joint project of Apple Computer, Inc. and
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

			-=- * -=-

	* WHERE DO I GET THE HYPERCARD STACK?

   Steve Cisler courtesy of the Apple Library, used a Macintosh
computer and converted Adams writing into a so-called HyperCard
stack; this stack, readable by the HyperCard software that comes
bundled with every Mac, is available via anonymous FTP from the EFF's
server "ftp.eff.org" as file "big-dummys-guide.sea.hqx" see under
"pub/Net_info/Big_Dummy". More versions, e.g. AmigaGuide and
GeoWorks Write are also available, the latter by Adam himself (cf.
VERSIONS).

			-=- * -=-

	* AND THE ORIGINAL ASCII?  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

   Also available in the same directory is Adam's original ASCII
version "big-dummys-guide.txt" (currently at version 2.2) that served as the
starting point for this Texinfo based release.

Besides several "bug fixes," witty quotes, corrections, including
some complete rewrites (cf Chapter 8) and the new layout, some more
value has been added; notably, two personal articles from EFFector
Online, the EFF's bi-weekly news magazine (available in comp.org.eff.news
on USENET), now serving as superb afterwords, and some other
contribution of Netizens I found quite worthwhile reading over
the past years:

	* NOW, WHAT'S IN THERE?

   * "A Slice of Life in my Virtual Community" by Howard Rheingold
describes the social life on the Internet from the WELL's point
of view.

   * "A Statement of Principle" by SF author Bruce Sterling
discusses some moral and legal issues you will definitely get to
know when becoming a "cybernaut" on Internet.

   * "Subject: TIME Article on Internet" by Philip Elmer-Dewitt
shows , that even the non-virtual world (aka "reality") finally got
interested in cyberspace, and the cybernauts on Internet.

   * "Subject: A Perspective on NREN" by Grag Chartrand *parodies*
the NSF's proposed US National Education and Research Network.

Moreover a bibliography has been stuffed into this edition:

   * A comprehensive list of Paperware related to the Internet
(This is an updated version of the bibliography section that
comes with the first edition of "Zen and the Art of the
Internet" by Brendan Kehoe, plus part of the reference section of
Henry Edward Hardy's Master's Thesis "The History of the Net"
written at the School of Communications, Grand Valley State
University, Allendale, MI 49401. Version 7.2 was posted to
comp.org.eff.talk on August 28, 1993.)

	* WHY DO YOU WANT THIS?

   Why do you want this? Well, for one thing, it's better than Bloomfield's
"99 more things to do in zero gravity", and then it's free. So what
else do you expect? Ok, for an encore: it definitely saves you some time
and trouble: traditionally users learned by word of mouth, stumbling
upon things, being trapped by dozens of pitfalls, and laughed at by
systems wizards. These times are OVER!

This guide should serve as a first straw to clutch at when you're stranded
in this mindboggling universe called Internet; and are curious about what
else can be done. It also presents the fundamental topics on a "rookie"
level that are all too often assumed and considered trivial by many more
experienced network users/admins/gurus.

			-=- * -=-

	* WHERE DO YOU GET IT?

   It should be available from the EFF's FTP server "ftp.eff.org" in the
"pub/Net_info/Big_Dummy" directory.

Just check out the European edition on "ftp.germany.eu.net" in
"pub/books/big-dummys-guide". See below for instructions on "How to configure
DUMMY's". AND read the SERVERS file that comes with the Texinfo distribution
for more servers than you probably need...

                        |-README.VMS             // help for VMS folks

                        |-bdgtti-2.2-US.ps.gz    // TeX PS US paper

                        |-bdgtti-2.2.tar.gz      // all Texinfo sources

Both sites can uncompress the files "on the fly", i.e., you do not need to
have the GNU gunzip utility. Just get the files with the ".gz" extension:

   get bdgtti-2.2.ps

instead of:

   get bdgtti-2.2.ps.gz


			-=- * -=-

	* WHAT ARE ALL THESE FILES?

   Now, how to read it. The file bdgtti-2.2.dvi is a DVI (DeVice
Independent) file created by the TeX typesetting system. Filters
exist to convert these DVI files into printer-specific files for
a variety of printers. Also included is the file bdgtti-2.2.ps,
a PostScript version. bdgtti-2.2.txt is the plain ASCII version
of bdgtti-2.2.info, ie. the latter can be browsed either using
EMACS in INFO mode, or any GNU info browser, e.g. "info", or
"xinfo". Just type "info -f bdgtti-2.2.info" and there you go.

For the folks who want to print the PS version on a Hewlett-Packard
laser printer with Postscript option, take care. You cannot print
the file double-sided, which results in "0.5in upwards shifted" even pages;
but printing it single-paged is ok. This is obvioulsy due to a bug in the
HP-printer's firmware, and was reported by Ed Moore of HP, using a
LaserJet 4Si (with PostScript option, of course).

Dawn Cooley reported troubles with a Texas Instruments microLaser Turbo.
After downloading Adobe's error handler, DUMMY's printed fine.

The tar file with suffix ".html" contains DUMMY's in some 300 files in
HyperText Markup Language format. They can be thrown into your
system's World-Wide Web directory, and then browsed using the
various WWW tools. E.g. from within xmosaic "Load Local" bdgtti-2.2_toc.html,
and there you go! An alternative is to set the default home page environment
variable with: "setenv WWW_HOME bdgtti-2.2_toc.html" which makes DUMMY's the
HOME page (press the HOME button to get back to the top) on startup.

(Well, at least when xmosaic is installed on your system. If it's
not, BUG YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR! He obviously missed the
leading edge of today's infosystems technologies.)

In the tar file bdgtti-2.2.tar.gz (a gzip'ed tar file---ask
YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR and/or Unix guru how to extract
the files from this), there are a number of files suffixed by
".texi". These are all the Texinfo sources to this guide.
Note again that on the eff.org site, this file will have a .z extension,
not a .gz extension, though it is the same sort of archive.  This is due
to a lousy script, and should be fixed Real Soon Now.

New in the collection is bdgtti-2.2.amiga.lha, an archive containing
the AmigaGuide (cf VERSIONS below) version of the book.

	* FYI: WHAT IS TeX?

   FYI: TeX is a free typesetting system by Don Knuth of Stanford;
the source of which you can FTP or buy on a tape. Texinfo is a
package of macros written on top of TeX by the GNU Project for
easy manual creation. See the FTP Chapter in DUMMY's on how to
obtain TeX.

			-=- * -=-

	* HOW TO CREATE A DVI FILE?

   Well, first you must configure DUMMY's to produce an US letter
size, or a European A4 paper size version: this can easily be done
with the provided "configure" shell script (C-shell), eg.:

   example % configure --letter
Or:
   example % configure --a4

Note, that "example %" represents your system's input prompt, that might look
different for you, eg. on MS-DOS you're used to see something like "C:\DUMMY>".
You might also configure DUMMY's "by hand", e.g. for the letter size version:

   example % cp config/Makefile.us Makefile
   example % cp config/bdgtti.us bdgtti.texi

And for the A4 version:

   example % cp config/Makefile.a4 Makefile
   example % cp config/bdgtti.a4 bdgtti.texi

To create a DVI file of your own (e.g. to produce an A4 paper version),
simply run "texi2dvi" on bdgtti.texi twice; or use the Makefile included;
it does almost *everything* for you (...although "make coffee" doesn't work,
yet). All there is to do is to type:

   example % make dvi

It's really that easy! (If you have the appropriate tools installed, and
a *real* operating system running on your box...)

			-=- * -=-

	* WHAT ABOUT A HYPERTEXT INFO FILE?

   Well, some moons have passed since edition 1.00, and now it's there!
But you need to patch "makeinfo v1.55" with the included "makeinfo-1.55.
patch" file, and compile it with "-DJOKES=1" defined. Then type "make info"
for the Info, and "make txt" for a TEXT/ASCII version.

			-=- * -=-

	* HOW TO CREATE THE HTML FILES?

   Just say "make html" which runs "texi2html" on "bdgtti.texi" and
creates a bunch of HTML files; Note that "texi2html" needs Larry Wall's
"perl" program to be installed on your system. Maybe you need to edit the
first line in the perl script "#!/usr/local/bin/perl" to whatever
directory "perl" is installed on your system.

			-=- * -=-

	* HOW TO HANDLE TYPOS, MISTAKES, AND OTHER BUGS?

   Given, that this is still the first edition, some "bugs" or other
"quirks" are inevitable, that might have been overseen during Texinfo
production. If you find something, drop me an e-mail; if you have any
comments or questions, want to make further addition or corrections,
please send "all-your-stuff" to the address below. I'll probably include
them into future releases of this guide.

   But, please, folks, don't expect an answer on your question until the
weekend following your quest. And thus you might drop me the question
on Fridays. I am currently writing my thesis on something completely
different than the Internet, WWW, Information Retrieval, or something alike,
and thus like to limit the e-mail traffic on this project to the weekends.

   Thanx in advance for your patience!
