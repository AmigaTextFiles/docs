                  Reply to "The Word" #9 + Carnage
                            By BL¡SS/GHD

First of all I would like to stress that other than this article you 
have absolutely no right to print ANYTHING in "The Word" concerning the
members of Grasshopper D or any of our productions. Anything written 
for Mookymoo! is not to be put in "The Word" and any newsfiles etc. 
MUST remain outside as per Eltech's case, and (surprise, surprise) we
MEAN it.

Kei brought up many interesting points in his letter to Wilsh, Wade and
I, though most were biased and almost all were blatantly untrue. I 
wouldn't expect any more of Carnage than to go running crying to a 
magazine such as "The Word" (at last, thank god, it's got the message 
that it's NOT a scene magazine, though at least NFA might do us a 
favour and admit being a company rather than pathetically pretending to
be a scene group) with a distinctly scene problem such as this one. 
However, before I start on about that, below follows, word for word, a
Meridian mail message sent by Kooky/Carnage to Wilsh/Steps of Change:

"Alright Wilsh, it's Kooky here. Now, it seems...I've heard on the 
grapevine that it's actually Eltech that are behind in getting Carnage
down and I think the reason for getting Carnage down is you think we're
lame. You think Carnage is lame, but do you think all the members in 
Carnage are lame? That's the first question. The second question is...
scene wars, right. I've been in a lot of <pause and emphasis on the 
next word> major groups and....scene wars used to be the thing. There 
used to be scene wars all the time but then people decided to grow up 
and don't slag other groups off, right? But that isn't the case, it 
seems here, it's a case of...we think we're the best, therefore we are,
therefore anybody else is lame. So if you'd like to pass this on, I'm 
not gonna mark this as private because I wanna listen to some of the 
other guy's comments. I'm just basically wanting to know what all this
shit's about man, because it's a bit lame, intit? Y'know what I mean?
Yeah? Anyway....hope to hear back soon. See ya mate."

Okay Kooky and all the rest of Carnage, here's one of the other guy's
replies I know you probably didn't get to hear it as we were threatened
off Meridian just after I sent it, but here it is again for you and the
other people to think about.

For a start, you seem to reckon you're a bit of a hot scener. Calling 
Eltech lame in the same message as claiming to have been in some MAJOR
groups...fair enough...any evidence to back it up? Glowing references 
from Scoopex, Virtual Dreams, Melon, hell, any KNOWN groups? None that
I can see. And in oh such a prestigious group now, aren't we? I 
would've only expected this sort of shit from a 12-year old lamer, not
even from Carnage, mind you, you guys never cease to shock me.

Anyway, next point, about scene wars. So scene wars were around in the
old days. Okay, you got that right but even a complete dumbass can see
that the UK scene nowadays is shit. It's stagnant, it's a wasteland, 
there's fuckall coming out except lame little shitty productions and 
even such obviously mighty bottom-bashers as Carnage are producing 
scanned slideshows and cli-based packs. So scene is bad now...why? 
No competition, no rivalry, whatever you want to call it, there ain't
any. At all. Everyone's too goddamned friendly to say what they think
of other groups. Lo and behold, some of us make a stand and we get 
these pathetic little textfiles back from lame groups with all the old
bullshit points about friendship being all and so on. I'm not anti-
friendship, neither is Wilsh or Wade, but what we are is anti-lamer...
there's a fine line between being friendly to those with the right
attitude and being unfriendly to those who don't. Carnage as a group 
does not so there's the reason in fat fucking letters why we're 
campaigning.

Right, onto some little points in Kei's article. About the person in 
Carnage that was causing "problems" on PermVac. Obviously being a 
co-sys on this board I take an interest in what happens and obviously
believe Mic on this point. Mic would not make up a lie about this 
situation just to take a stab at Carnage. Hell knows, there are enough
other things he could have chosen. And Kei didn't explain the incident
well enough. Kooky first logged in as Dooba (left Carnage as they 
didn't use his music) of Steps of Change, and then mistakenly thought 
Dooba knew Mic and paged him and asked for a dizzy and full access etc. 

Mic thought, quite rightly, "Fuck off" and kicked him off and locked him
out. Seconds later the phone rang again, and surprise, surprise, it was
Kooky of Carnage that logged in this time. Now I believe Mic when he 
says it was one and the same person as being a sysop it is quite easy to 
determine who is calling by how fast the modem connects and the quality
of the line. I know that, as an ex-co-sysop on a few PC boards (Genesis
BBS, Subway BBS and Inner Sanctum BBS, see how TRUTH works, Kooky?) that
it is just something that you can pick up from time to time. Twinned 
with the fact that Dooba doesn't have access to a modem, it was utterly
obvious. So Kooky was kicked off and locked out.

This isn't the only occasion which Kooky has pretended to be someone he
isn't however. On Meridian, Kooky tried to persuade many people that he
was a system administrator to try and gain boxes and scare people off 
the system. Even Fireball of (yes!) Carnage agreed that the voice on 
the messages sounded like Kooky's and his conduct was completely lame.
Incidentally, Killit said some time ago now that Kooky is no longer in 
Carnage. Better update that list or admit the truth guys.

Another point, and I quote: "As for Wilsh and friends killing off 
Carnage I'm afraid that just isn't possible. Not because we are so big 
(another reason that pisses Wilsh off) but because the management will 
stay no matter what." Hmmm....I think Kei's standing down as the manager
of Carnage a day after I read this article says it all. We made a stand
and Carnage are either going to have to buck up or crumble.

Also, "several disks" of Fusion Tools...erm...no.....I think only one 
was ever released, so christ knows where you got that from.

"To the friends of Wilsh: ...etc"...what have I to gain. A better scene,
for a start, and to make my opinions on these matters clear to everyone.
The fact that you, Kei, tried to get my address off a member of 
Grasshopper D in order to "contact" me is just plain ridiculous. I was,
at that point, on Meridian, and still on boards, internet mail, IRC, 
basically all the main means of rapid communication and you, if you 
wanted it hard enough, could have fucking well asked ME for it, but the 
backhanded way you went about trying to get it suggests that you were 
up to something else. I dearly hope you didn't take this THAT 
seriously, and I'm sure you didn't, otherwise you'd be deeply sad, but 
as I said earlier, you Carnage guys never cease to shock me.

As for displaying Wilsh to be the impertinent newcomer to the scene, 
that's just bollocks. Do you think groups such as Eltech, Fairlight 
and Royal to be newcomers? What about Swoop/Rebels, Destop/CNCD and 
Horny/Animators? Funny how they pledged their support for the 
destruction of a bunch of lamers like Carnage too then, hmm?

As to your rantings of scene wars etc. take a look at the text file 
written by me in "the word" 9, now excuse me but did I not say "This is
NOT a scene war. This is a turning point"? You must have conveniently 
misheard this passage then. What I'm saying is that okay, Carnage are 
first in line, but with around 40 members and no scene productions due,
don't you think we have a right to get at you?

So sort it out. Big Carnage may be, but big is not always better.

Big is just big.

BL¡SS/GHD

PS If anyone wishes to discuss this matter further, write to a decent
mag, like Deadlock, or send me mail direct, there's no point in 
releasing a load of fucking textfiles to present one side of a story
in which you are clearly utterly wrong and aren't even willing to
try and prove yourselves.
