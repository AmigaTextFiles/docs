Hey! this is mighty good news!


VISCorp has acknowledged that it will be attending the 4th Annual Amiga 
convention in Montreal!

One of the organizers told me VISCorp was bringing new stuff, computers 

                            AND IDEAS!!!


SO IF YOU LIVE   IN   or  NEAR MONTREAL, QUEBEC... and are Amiga Aware or 
would like to ...


                   8-)   PLEASE BE THERE    8-)


The more peolpe there will be, the more fun everybody will have and the 
more Amiga will benefit from the exposure that it might create!


NOTE, Read the Convention's WWW document at AMIGA's Web site !
         (http://www.amiga.de/de/Aktuelles/Index.html)




-Maxim Olivier-Adlhoch,

 Who will definitely have his own table and will be showing 
off Virtuaal...  what is Virtuaal? a completely new OO GUI system 
in design stage... come and see at the show and give opinions or ideas, 


see you next week!
