Not a bad idea but I'm sure Fred Fish would like to have some say about 
that first. :)

It's still fascinating that the PIOS presentation of events is accepted 
for fact.  I don't want to say any more about the situation until I get 
some word from higher up, but our interpretation of events is somewhat 
different.

And yes, we can have talks, and we can listen and invite people to make 
presentations, which we HAVE.  I've got one very interesting 
Amiga-related proposal from a well-known company in my mailbox and 
another is planning a trip down to Chicago to discuss our hardware 
options.  But we cannot commit to anything, and it is a damned weak 
bargaining position when one company present doesn't actually have the 
goods being discussed in hand!

: I've already seen people shouting "PIOS is the only hope for the

: Amiga (my humble opinion) is *VIScorp, PIOS and Phase5 working

: completely new, AmigaOS compatible OS at the same time. VIScorp can't
: afford to develop a new, revamped AmigaOS *and* a porting to the PPC
: *and* the STB line at the same time. PIOS doesn't *want* to develop a
: new (Amiga)OS for their boxes, so they might look elsewhere (God
: forbid! Even if it could be interesting to buy a PPCP machine with
: multiple OSes, BeOS and AmigaOS for instance). If I am wrong, correct
: me: tell me VIScorp has the resources to do all this, and more (how
: about marketing?); but I don't think so.

All along, I've been talking about how much I want everyone to work 
together.  And it really troubles me that PIOS won't even give us the 
time to secure the deal before jumping to conclusions.

It would.

We are continuing to have as many discussions as possible on the RISC 
issue but the hard and fast truth is that these mega-corps do not want to 
have a serious, hard and fast negotiation until we have technology and 
ownership in hand.

: You should have a look at what other STB/NC builders are doing:

For January launch, there's little else we can do.
