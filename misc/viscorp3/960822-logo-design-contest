    VIScorp wants to show the world that it is more than just a set-top
   technology company with three capital letters in its name. We want to
         tell everyone that we own the Amiga, in everything we do.
                                      
     What better way than to incorporate Amiga trademark images in the
          VIScorp logo? We'd like this to be a community project.
                                      
             The specifications of the new logo are as follows.
    1. The Logo MUST be provided in a form that will show up in NTSC and
       PAL broadcast video. (avoid white backgrounds, etc.) We recommend,
       but do not insist upon, a battleship-grey background at 10%
       screen.
    2. The Logo MUST be provided in a form that will be color-separatable
       and printable.
    3. The Logo MUST incorporate the Amiga double-checkmark in the "V" of
       VIScorp.
    4. The Logo SHOULD incorporate the Amiga rainbow color stripes (as
       found on Amiga OS manuals, etc.) in the "o" of VIScorp. If you
       wish, you may ALSO submit a design with the Amiga boing ball as
       the o, but the rainbow "o" should take precedence.
    5. The Logo MUST be designed on an Amiga.
       
       So, whether your bag is DPaint, Brilliance, AdPro, ImageFX, or
    Lightwave, we want to see your vision for the future of VIScorp and
       the Amiga. This will be appearing on all corporate information
                   packages, memos, correspondance, etc.
                                      
    The entries should be submitted to VIScorp. Disks can be provided in
                            any format. VIScorp
                              111 N. Canal St.
                                 Suite 933
                             Chicago, IL 60606
                                    USA
                                      
    The winner will receive our undying gratitude and recognition on the
         inside flap of our official corporate information packet.
                                      
              All entries will become the property of VIScorp.
