     In August, in Montreal, the fourth annual Amiga Convention
will take place!  This convention will gather the Amiga community
together from all across the world to show its support for the
Amiga!  We hope to make this show an event in the long fight to
make the Amiga a well known computer in North America again.







WHY:  We are putting on the Amiga Convention '96 (AC 96) to
      support our favorite computer, the Amiga!  We feel that
      for too long, the Amiga has been ignored, and now that
      the Amiga is owned by people who actually will support
      it well, we want to help them out in any way we can.
      We also want to get a lot of people together to have a
      really cool time!

WHERE: The Howard Johnson Hotel in Montreal, large enough to hold
       over 1,000 people, not including the surrounding rooms.

                          one table of 6' by 3' and chairs.
                          These tables are aimed towards
                          dealers and developers.


FREE TABLES:  We will also have free tables at AC'96, for
              anyone who wishes to BRING THEIR AMIGA, whether
              to show off something cool, or just to help
              someone else who might need one at the time.
              However, at the free tables you get less space
              than the pay tables, it is first-come first-
              serve, and you cannot sell products at the
              tables!  That is strictly for the rented tables.


ACCESABILITY:  The show is easily accesable by bus and subway,
               as well as having lots of parking space in the
               vicinity for cars.


WHY DEALERS SHOULD COME:  At AC'96, we offer tables at an
                          incredibly rate, a price which
                          includes electrical outlets and
                          electricity. You also get the
                          chance to show and sell your
                          wares to a crowd of Amiga owners,
                          all of whom have money to spend
                          and are influenced by how big a
                          prescence you have at the show.

WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME:   AC'96 will have stands from many
                          major dealers and developers. It will
                          also have a lot of friendly Amiga
                          owners there, plus a booming sound
                          system and TV setup that will show
                          crazy demos and products. It will be
                          a wild good time for all!
