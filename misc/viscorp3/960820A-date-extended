PRESS INFORMATION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

30 More Days

   Bensheim 20/08/96
   
   On 20th August 1996, the trustee for the bankruptcy of ESCOM AG and
   AMIGA Technologies GmbH, Bernhard Hembach, extended the closing date
   for VlScorp's purchase of AMIGA for 30 days with the support of ESCOM
   creditors.
   
   While the agreement is firm, one of the financial institutions
   supporting VlScorp in the transaction required more documentation to
   authorize their portion of the funding. Satisfied that VlScorp would
   meet these requirements the closing date was extended.
   
   The closing will not be extended past this date.
