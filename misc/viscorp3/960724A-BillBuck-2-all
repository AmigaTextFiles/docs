An Open Message to the Amiga Community

  from Bill Buck, CEO, VIScorp:
  
     1. Escom AG and Amiga Technologies GmbH are in bankruptcy and will
     cease to exist as corporate entities. VIScorp has reached an
     agreement with the Trustee for the liquidation of these companies
     and with the creditors of these companies for the purchase of
     "Amiga." There were at least eleven different banks or companies
     that had claims to be "owners" of the technology and/or the
     inventory. Escom had liabilities of over $250 million. Imagine the
     confusion...
     
     2. The steps that we had to follow through the last three months
     were painstaking. As the situation at Escom deteriorated, we had to
     continually re-negotiate our purchase contract. We could not
     speed-up the process. Many things we wanted to begin immediately we
     have had to delay. The situation at Amiga and Escom were extremely
     troubled. This was in part because of the difficult financial and
     management situations at Amiga and Escom, but also because of how
     poorly organized the intellectual property had been under
     Commodore. In the course of the Commodore bankruptcy many problems
     developed that were never repaired.
     
     3. The final (and last of three) purchase contract was signed on
     Friday, 19 July. It cannot be changed; it has been executed. The
     intellectual property of the former Commodore and the inventory of
     the former Amiga Technologies will be owned finally by VIScorp. The
     final paperwork will be completed in the next 30 days. During this
     month, VIScorp GmbH will be registered and Amiga Technologies will
     continue to operate temporarily in bankruptcy for VIScorp.
     
     4. Petro Tyschtschenko and his staff will continue to operate from
     Germany. Raquel Velasco and Petro Tyschtschenko will be the new
     General Managers of Amiga, to be known as VIScorp GmbH. Al Duncan,
     a former General Manager of Commodore will join VIScorp to manage
     the sales and distribution of VIScorp and Amiga products in North
     America. Petro will continue to operate from Germany and manage the
     existing business. Raquel is looking for someone from the community
     to manage the re-organization of the sales and distribution in
     Europe. Please contact Raquel if you are the right person for this
     job.
     
     5. The engineering efforts of the former Amiga Technologies and the
     on-going engineering of VIScorp will be combined and professionally
     managed. We intend to begin to implement the plans we outlined in
     Toulouse very shortly.
     
     6. Please excuse our lack of communication with the community over
     the last months. We were severely restricted from communicating our
     activities. Please resend your emails to any of the VIScorp staff
     if they have not been answered by this letter. We simply could not
     answer all the emails.
     
     7. Do not expect miracles from VIScorp, expect slow, but steady
     progress.
     
     Thank you for your continued support.
     
     Best Regards,
     
     Bill Buck
