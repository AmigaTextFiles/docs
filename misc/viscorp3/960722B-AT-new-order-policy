AMIGA relocates Order processing to Braunschweig

  Ladies and Gentlemen, dear AMIGA dealers !
  
   You certainly learned it from the media, last week the events almost
   overtook themselves:
   
   Bensheim 22/07/96
   
   On Thursday, the 18th of July, 1996 the final contract of purchase was
   signed between the bankruptcy trustee solicitor Bernhard Hembach and
   the president and CEO of VISCorp, William Buck, with approval of the
   'pool of banks' for the entire remaining inventory and intellectual
   property.
   
   Until 18th of August 1996 VISCorp has time now to establish the
   necessary companies to carry on with its current businesses.
   
    In the meantime, the business will be run with the approval of the
   bankruptcy trustee Hembach under the name AMIGA Technologies GmbH i.K.
   From the 19th of August, 1996 the business will finally be run under
   the name, control and ownership of VISCorp.
   
    What changes now ?
    
   Order processing, distribution and dealer support are now being
   handled in Braunschweig. Mr. Axel Krämer is now responsible for the
   operations there and the contact persons are Axel Krämer, Margret
   Wiedemann and Andreas Steep. Support, hotline, accounting and company
   management are still located in Bensheim. Just as a reminder the
   Braunschweig-address:

AMIGA Technologies GmbH i.K.
Hansestraße 15
D-38112 Braunschweig

Tel: 0531-31089-0
Fax: 0531-31089-77


   Thank you very much for continued cooperation, we wish you and us all
   the best !
   
   Kind regards,
