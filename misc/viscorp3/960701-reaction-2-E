: Wow, emerson. I've never bouth a single emerson product. Then again,
: I don't buy TV's at Kmart.. but I assume a lot of people do. Is this really
: what VIScorp wants though? The kind of people who shop at Kmart (while it's
: a bad idea to stereotype) probably aren't the highest onthe scale of
: computer literate people..However, this product probably WILL sell tons..

Yes, actually it is a mass market and good place for product recognition.

: Does this mean ALL VIScorp products (like, say, oh, I don't know,
: AMIGAS maybe) will be sold at Kmart? 

Viscorp's setop it seems will be from reading your quoted article, but 
alas, no mention of selling any Amiga :(

I say alas, because Amiga sales at Kmart would sure give the Amiga the 
publicity it could use, and a "household" Amiga at Kmart will survive.

: I dunno if this is such a great idea. I argued against this tooth
: and nail a few months ago. Let's hope that the set-top boxes stay at Kmart
: and Amigas stay at computer shops and high-end video stores.. I always liked
: the idea of the Amiga being the classiest of computers.. (I bought my first
: A500 at a high-end a/v store and probably wouldn't have bought one at Kmart)

Yes, but again, the Amiga needs the boost in sales. No sales=No more Amigas.

: Well hey, it's great exposure at the very least. I've been seeing
: things about VIScorp all over the place, on TV, in the papers, etc. and they
: all mention the Amiga!

Yeah!! just my point.
