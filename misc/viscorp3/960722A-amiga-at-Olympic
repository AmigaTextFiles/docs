Amiga Supports The 1996 Olympic Games

     The 1996 Summer Olympic Games provides a unique opportunity for the
     Amiga to demonstrate its worldwide appeal, especially among news
     and media professionals from Europe and the Americas.
     
     Several US-based Amiga companies have joined forces to provide
     computer support to the press agencies attending the Games. A
     series of high-end Amigas are being placed at the heart of the
     media editing room for use as an onsite editing tool for video
     footage taken by various reporters and media producers. The Amiga
     will be getting some positive media coverage and a chance to
     demonstrate it's prowess handling complex broadcast and video
     graphics.
     
     Special thanks are extended to Keith Cagle, of Virtual Reality
     Productions, who organized the event space.
     
     VIScorp would like to thank the Amiga community for its support in
     this effort, especially the following companies for their
     contribution: Virtual Reality Productions, Keith Cagle
     QuickPak, Dave Zembecki
     New Tek, Bob Hoffman & Daneta Colbach
     Anti-Gravity Products, June Lavenberg
