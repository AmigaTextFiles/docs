  Internet-Access via T-Online-Access with Surfer/Surfware
     * Software available here as a disk-archive
     * Extract Archive on a disk called 'SurferTOnline' entpacken und von
       dort installieren!
     * If not available, here's the required Lha-Extractor
     * Open a Shell, copy the extractor to C:, and unpack the archive
       with `lhex x BTXDisk.lha df0:` or `lha x BTXDisk.lha df0:`

  PPP with Surfer/Surfware
     * Hints for switching to PPP
     * Generic PPP-ipd.login-Skript as an example for 'standard'-provider
     * PPP-ipd.login-Skript for CompuServe
       
   A real big thank you ! must go to Claude Müller from the Amiga User
   Group Switzerland for the two PPP-Skripts !!!
   
  Claude's additional Hints:
  
   The Start-Script is the same for generic PPP as well as Compuserve.
   
   The CompuServe-IPD.LOGIN has to be modified by the User, before it
   works. Its reasonably documented, but soon it will also be further
   explained in a magazine workshop.
   
   Questions ? Just copy over the two scripts (don't forget to backup the
   old ones). Then press "Install for other providers" and after
   completion it should work. As always, Murphy's Law is valid here ;-)
   ...
   
   Greetings, Claude
