EMAILWARE: Although I can lay claim to nothing really new here, I guess this is the first upload to Aminet describing how to connect a SCSI-II SmartMedia/CompactFlash reader/writer to an Amiga so I expect that if it works for you straightup, that I deserve at least an email to make my day.

DISCLAIMER: If it doesn't work, you didn't do it properly. Go slowly, methodically, write things down. Turn the TV off.


Machine used: A4000T Cyberstorm MkII 060 60Mhz. 128mb fast. 
              The SCSI-II PCMCIA SmartMedia/CompactFlash reader/writer is connected to the
              A4000T's external SCSI-II bus with an Iomega Zip drive at the end of the chain.

Requirements: An Amiga with the version of CrossDos that comes with OS3.1
              A SCSI card
              A SCSI PCMCIA reader/writer
              Either a SmartMedia or CompactFlash card.

I recently bought an Olympus C900Z digital camera here in Japan, the equivalent USA model is the D400Z. The camera can download pics via it's serial line but the Olympus only cable costs more tha US$100. the camera can also output content to video. Both of these methods are slow and require the camera to be turned on and if you don't have the AC adaptor then you'll soon be running to the corner store for a box of batteries. (Actually, the C900Z is pretty dammned good concerning battery use).

The camera also makes use of "SmartMedia" PCMCIA cards....

Hmmmmm...I thought, "Didn't I see something in comp.sys.amiga.hardware about this?"

Check, check..check.. looks like there's some people interested in this. "Feels" like it can be done.

So, I whipped down to Kyoto's computer/electrical district (Terramachi) and started prowling around...for several cautious days. After I compiled my findings, analysed, agonised...I finally took the plunge and bought the camera which comes with one 8mb 3.3v SmartMedia card.

Next, I bought an "external" SCSI-II Melco "Buffalo" brand SmartCard/CompactFlash reader/writer.

This unit has everything I could want. I paid a bit more than most Amiga owners would probably want to but I was determined to end up with a solid, reliable system.

The "Buffalo" had the following features:

1. Two female 50 pin SCSI-II connectors
2. A gadget to set the SCSI ID
3. An ON/OFF switch
4. A 3.3v/5v "SmartMedia" adaptor. ( the 3.3v is vitsl for Olypus SmartMedia cards.
5. A male/male SCSI-II cable (a bit short but works )
6. An AC adaptor which plugs into the rear of the unit.

There are apparantly many of these SCSI type reader/writers coming out now, I have seen US$80 units which are merely PCMCIA adaptors stuck on the end of a SCSI cable. I don't guarantee that they will work but then again, SCSI is SCSI. Try having a look at "http://microtechint.com". They specialise in external units, an internal unit should work just as well.

DRIVER

I was all in a panic over how to mount this card. I read and re-read "Illya's" (of c.s.a.hardware fame) posts about using PCMCIA cards and decided to have a go and after a few hairy nights re-learning a whole lot about the Amiga and SCSI I made my personal breakthrough. What a wonderful feeling, especially this far away from a friendly Amiga shop.

You only need OS3.1 supplied CrossDos. If you have CrossDos6 or 7, all the better.

"MountDOS100.lha" by K.P. van Beem is supplied with this archive and is freely distributable. It is available on Aminet. It's straightforward; input the scsi.device name and unit number (You can set the tooltypes in the icon to either mount or generate a mountlist or BOTH.)


eg:

dkbscsi.device unit 1
scsi.device unit 2

etc... Run the program and copy the result into a text editor

IMPORTANT: MountDOS100's generated output file starts with the name "PCC:"  remove this from the file or comment it out OR THE MOUNTLIST WON'T WORK.

Now save your textfile as (whatever you like but keep it short) as  maybe, "SM0" (SmartMedia0)(the name doesn't matter as the mountlist is merely describing the SmartMedia unit to your Amiga, go to Dopus and add an icon. 
Set the tooltypes to:

 "activate=1" 
 "DEVICE=yourscsidevice"
 "UNIT=your unit number"



Now set the default tool in the icon to "c:mount". In fact most dosdriver icons look like this so you could just copy one to ram and rename it as "SM0"

Now copy both the the "SM0" textfile and "SM0.info" to sys:devs/dosdrivers.

Turn off your computer and connect your SCSI SmartMedia/CompactFlash reader/writer to your Amiga and bootup with the card NOT in the drive.

After bootup, inset the card...

Does an icon pop up? Yes? Well done!





I have included my dosdriver but I feel that it would be better for you to take the MountDOS100 route as maybe your particular brand of reader/writer might describe the cards a little differently.

In buying a SCSI/READER go for simplicity and functionality. If you plan to use SmartMedia/CompactFlash a lot then definitely go for an internal model. It will be cheaper and add many "coolness" points to your Amiga won't it. It will certainly impress the shit out of your scoffing PC frineds.

My current mountlist gives me full access to an 8Mb 3.3v SmartMedia card. I can drag the pics to ram: after telling WB to "show all files"..or I can access the card via Dopus by inputting the name of the driver, "SM0:" in the field. I get over 7mbps transfer speed.

One thing though, I cannot see a name to the icon that appears on my WB, this might be because it's in Japanese for all I know or simple ignorance in respect to mountlists on my part.
I suggest that if you get a 16Mb 3.3v SmartMedia card then try MountDOS again (first remove the 8mb mountlist and start from cold boot) and compare the 8mb and 16mb mountlists after using MountDOS.




THINGS I HAVEN'T AND WON'T DO YET :)

1. Snapshotted the icon
2. "MOVE" rather than copy a pic, though that should be pretty safe.
3. Save to the card the HDToolBox settings.

The above are better left to the Einsteins out there.





COMPACTFLASH WOW!

CompactFlash looks like being an incredible leap up in information storage and retrieval. I've heard plans for 200mb CompactFlash disks. Bear in mind that a CompactFlash disk will fit in with your business cards in your wallet (Bye bye ZIp drive.... remains to be seen).
Anyway, I will not be the first volunteer to format a SmartMedia or CompactFlash card to run on an Amiga filesystem. Not til I'm richer or more crazed than I currently am.


THE OLYMPUS C900Z DIGITAL CAMERA:

This camera is astounding, there are 4 image quality settings and I include storage rates for an 3.3v 8mb SmartMedia card.

 SQ                     gives you 122 jpegs (Similar but better than the Sony Mavica quality)
 HQ                     gives you  36 jpegs (Better than you've probably seen so far) 
SHQ                     gives you  16 jpegs (Orgasmic)
Un-compressed TIFF mode gives you   4, huge, fantastic .TIFF pics.

ALWAYS format the SmartMedia card in the camera. THIS IS ESSENTIAL.

The camera takes four alkaline batteries and the life is a lot longer than I expected.
I will be buying a NickelHydride set of eight batteries and a charger. From what I read in searching USENET for "D400Z", these batteries are phenomenol and I can expect 10 days or more without overusing the flash.

The camera has a viewfinder (essential) and a large liquid crystal external screen.
The nicest touch is that the lens retracts and is covered automatically when not in use (no more fingerprints!)

The camera also has a 3 times zoom nad many settings for varying light conditions. 
There is also a "sequencing" setting.
You can preview or "slideshow" all pics on the card.



Enough..... go enjoy some nice technology. Who says the Amiga is dead?
