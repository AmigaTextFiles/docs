 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: What's the difference between JPEG and JFIF ?

 A: There is none, because you are talking about
    completely different things. JFIF is a file
    format, while JPEG is a compression scheme.
    Thus JFIF usually is the appropriate term.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: And what about LJPG ?

 A: Forget LJPG. It means "lossless JPEG" and
    isn't compatible with either one, normal or
    progressive JPEG, on file format level.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Is there a difference between progressive JPEG
    and normal JPEG files (speaking about JFIF) ?

 A: Yes - progressive JPEG files cannot be read and
    written by every application, while JFIF files
    with normal JPEG compression scheme already have
    become a widely used and supported standard.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: So, why has p-JPEG been introduced ?

 A: It allows programs, i.e. WWW browsers, to start
    displaying JPEG files while they're still loading
    these. This is compareable to the interlacing
    compression scheme known from "interlaced GIF"
    or the Adam7 progressive compression method known
    from "interlaced PNG" files.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: So, if a program does not support progressive
    display, will it fail to read p-JPEG ?

 A: Depends on the version of the JPEG loader used.
    As with V6a, the IJG standard library allows
    to transparently load JPEG files of either type,
    so that the reading application does not have to
    care about details.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: What about programs, that do support p-JPEG, will
    they still read normal JPEGs ?

 A: Of course, but they won't be able to provide a
    progressive display for these.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Which programs do allow to write p-JPEG and how
    can this be done ?

 A: Take a look into the documentation of the program,
    whether it does support to write progressive JPEG;
    somewhere it perhaps does explain the necessary options.
    However, almost any JPEG writer perhaps will write
    normal JPEGs by default, so if you demand p-JPEG
    you perhaps will have to mention it explicitely.
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Can you mention some applications for Amiga, that
    can handle (read and write) progressive JPEG ?

 A: Yes, for example:

       akJFIF                  (read)
       SuperView/SViewNG       (read + write)
       Picture Manager prof.   (read + write)
       ImageFX 3.0             (read + write)
       cjpeg/djpeg             (read + write)
       ...
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Q: Some programs see to read that p-JPEG files well,
    while others do seem to fail completely. What
    am I doing wrong ?

 A: Check using the newest djpeg whether the file has been
    written correctly. If no errors do occur, check the
    environment settings done for your reader program, i.e.
    WWW browser or datatypes. Datatypes may require chip
    RAM for the bitmap where the image data has to be
    put into (with CyberGfx fast RAM is possible as
    well), in "interleaved bitmap" mode this may mean
    a contiguous chunk of chip memory !

    Another problem may be, that the decoder has been
    restricted not to utitilize too much memory for
    the decoding process: it may help to set the
    environment variable

            ENV:JPEGMEM

    to a higher value.

    Also make sure, that you did supply the JPEGTMP:
    assign that is required to utilize your harddisk
    for "virtual memory" and storing temporary data.

    With akJFIF this one has been changed to VMEM:,
    so you may wish to try something as follows:

            Assign VMEM: Temporary-Data:
            Assign JPEGTMP: VMEM:
