For the Mankind site: http://tex.mankind.free.fr/ (demos can be found at
"products"). And yes, the Deathtrial demo (Warp-OS, finished first at the
UKONX) is really worth seing and for your information, TEX is also the
author of "Doggy", great LW-object viewer under warp3D/storm-mesa (can also
be found on the MKD site). You should also notice a new warp3D-demo
realised by CdBS at the UKONX: "Enclume". Both groups will members present
at the Amigamania, Amiga-users meeting that will stand in TOULOUSE from 6
to 8 of May.

I fear not much currently... I also did not get any mails... but to add some 
new stuff which some people might not yet have noticed:

- Hyperion released the first progress report for SiN, with first Screenshots
  of both Hardware and Software Renderer of SiN on the Amiga !!!
- The group ManKinD released two really great PPC Demos using WarpUP,
  MKD_DeathTrial and MKD_ViolentDumb, one of them is on the homepage
  of ManKinD (sorry, don't have the URL currently handy), the other
  on ftp.scene.org in the folder for Mekka-Symposium 2000). I also
  heard rumours there will be WarpUP Demos from other groups quite
  soon ("with maybe also Warp3D Support")
- MiniGL has been released (actually already around 2 weeks ago), to
  provide a easy-to-use API to port OpenGL Stuff to the Amiga (with
  still optimal speed). Programmers can download it at the WWW of
  Hyperion Software. Currently supported are StormC PPC - both 3.0 and
  4.0 Beta -, gcc-WarpUP, StormC 68k and gcc-68k. (Anybody interested in
  helping with the vbcc-version ?)
- The new version of WarpSNES is nearly finished, I am currently working on it.
  Basically I am just waiting on a new c2p which a friend of mine is coding, 
  which will speedup the emulator a lot for AGA users. The new version is
  around 30% faster than the old, new stuff are: Move to SNES9x base sources
  V1.29, support for PSX Port using LowLevel Emulation, and added support
  for HAM8 mode for AGA users

BlitterSoft.  They are in the process of making deals
with various retailers, so you might contact BlitterSoft
to see if any German dealers have bought any.

Subject: @{b}[warpup] UAE@{ub}

Hello,

I've found WarpOS UAE really interesting to try out, and am looking forward
to getting more powerful hardware someday so I can play games properly.
Sensi worked, at about 50% speed, but was still playable. Well done Sam! :)

I would like to know if you can use actual 880k floppies instead of
filedisks, 
as generally game disks are copy protected and can't be made into
ADFs easily. 

In the case of SWOS (which I consider THE benchmark Amiga game), I used a
cracked version off the net because I couldn't create ADFs from my original
disks :( I know any kind of condoning of piracy is bad but I just needed to
see for myself how it performed. I used a grab of my actual 40.68 ROM for 
the test.

Alternatively, is there the option to set up a hard drive partition for HD
installable games? Having the original SWOS means I can do a hard drive
install 
easily and it would be faster than filedisks too.

Regards

This is currently not supported. I don't know whether this is likely
to be changed in a reasonable amount of time.

The harddisk mount feature is supported and works fine (at least here).
Check out the documentation which should be in the archive.

I have tow other questions...I got my Blizzard Vision today
and well, there's two problems.

Those who owns the "original" release - did it work like a passthru
as well? Mine does but the PAL screens shown looks really awful.
Set it to use 256 colours and it still looks like there's only
one bitplane. Not that I will be using native modes much but
anyway...

The other problem is regarding Warp3D. What is a good way to see
what it is capable of? Of the examples in the Warp3D-3 archive,
I can only run WarpTest (the others makes the computer freeze)
and that one isn't, well, very impressive...

Get the Warp3D capable version of ADescent.  It works great
on my CV3D, so it should FLY on your BVision.

It patches several system functions, and is not a general passthru/emulation.
And it only uses 3 or 4 bitplanes, can't remember

Permedia is not capable of anything :)
As you don't provide that much information on your problems i cannot say. If
you're loaded with memory, try the Heretic 2 demo, or the WipeOut demo.

That's because it's a test program :) It's only supposed to test the
features, to see if it works. 

You say that the other demos bomb ? What exactly is happening ? And, do
you get a texture map in warptest (i.e. not just a colored square) ?

its not a passthru, per-se. its a promote hack that allows the bootscreen to
be seen on an SVGA monitor. Its designed for 4 colours

why not visit the Warp3D pages at haage-partner - and download some files to
see what it can do.

i recommend you get GLQuake, Wipeout2097 demo and HereticII demo.

thats true - but the PermediaII is  ;-)

I have a stats page that shows that the Amiga version of hereticII on a

PermediaII. strange, but true!!

sounds to me like he's got to set up the cgfx card options in preferences.

disable the 24bit compress mode and enable the bitmap cache.

also, either run the latest cgx v3 (and not PPC version!) or go and get v4 -
it makes a LOT of sense

If the demos are not working, there is a chance that you don't have the latest
cvisionppc monitor, there was a 2.7 beta 1 IIRC. I updated to that version
and everything worked fine. Don't know where you can get it from know though
since I got it from the Phase 5 site. Of course, I can just send it to you.

Yes! As a BVision owner, I can tell that CGX4 is a "must-have" when you have
a BVisionPPC!
And for the "Pass-thru": It's not a passThru but a hack in the Blizzppc
flashRom which perform a copy of the pal output of the Amiga! It's limited
to 4 color and is way slower than the real Aga output! But it's handfull
when"tuning" your system software. (you are able to boot with the original
workbench disk on the BVision!).
And for info: a friend of mine as decided to code a "hack" to redirect the
entire Aga output to the BVision in order to play old non-CGX games and to
see demos! I'm doubtfull but he is very confident and is sure to achieve a
"good" result.

Probably better optimized.  Certainly, the data bandwidth on
the AGP version is better than the PCI version (which is all
the BVPPC or CVPPC is).  Since storing data to the card is
not faster, the data calculation must be where the speed
originates.  Or, it could be that the PII system you used
wasn't setup properly for full-speed... maybe the L2 cache
was turned off. :^}

Ah, that's what it's for. No surprise it didn't work as I thought it to
do at first. Actually, I was surprised that it had such a thing at
all.

Well, that's misinformation for you...I blame the so-called manual
for this...I'm not exactly fluent in German to start with and it's
waay to much on the thin side. I've seen manuals printed on the back
of matchboxes that are better.

>Permedia is not capable of anything :)

Well, maybe not. Hardware accellerated 3D isn't my speciality. And quite
frankly, I'm not that interested. Just wanted to see what it's capable
of (or not...). No gamesplayer, me.

Of course. Just an example of the only Warp3D program I've got running so
far.

Is that for CGFX 4? I tried the pre6 beta for 4.2 and it simply just won't
install.
Spatch complains about something I cannot figure out (not yet anyway).

BTW, is it normal to have both CvisionPPC and BvisionPPC in devs:monitors
straight after install?

I went straight for v4 and it didn't recognise my board. I chose CvisionPPC
since there was no Bvision there. It works albeit it says Cvision in
all screenmode-selectors.

No, there should only be a driver for BVision or CVision. With your BVision
you have to delete the CVision driver or they may collide.

This may be only luck. The problem with both drivers installed came up some
days ago with another guy having them both in Devs:Monitors. I don't
remember if deleting the second driver solved his problems, though.

Mine has no pass-through at all. My tele blew up today. :(
The boot screen hack thing needs a later flash than I have. I hate doing flash
upgrades but I`ll need to do it as I need boot menu to get past the setpatch
crash when first switching on. A bit OT but what is the best flash to go for
now.

The BVision is not supported in V4.0. Get V4.2, get rid of the CVisionPPC, and
install the BVisionPPC monitor

No L2 cache, I'm afraid. I guess that's the only possibility with two

Well, you could, but that would be an AWFULL lot of cache

Belive me, I've tried. So far with no luck. No matter what I do
I end up with one of those symptoms:

1. The workbench-screen never shows up. Either the bootlogo stays in
place all the time or if that one's disabled, a black screen.

2. Just a Cvision entry in Screenmode-prefs and the CGX-prefs
programs.

Maybe, but I doubt it. How different can the two different boards
be? They share the same graphics-chip after all.

I do have V4.2 installed but I have yet to get the BVisionPPC monitor
running.
Maybe I'm unbelivably stupid but I can't figure out how to do so. In my
view, it should be as simple as:

Move the BvisionPPC and BvisionPPC.info into DEVS:Monitors
Remove the CvisionPPC and CvisionPPC.info from Devs:Monitors
Rename the Envarc:Cybergraphx/CvisionPPCmonitor to
Envarc:Cybergraphx/BvisionPPCMonitor
Reboot

Have I missed something?

Now I have...

It seems like Warp3D, PPC and GL doesn't work too well
together here. 

The Warp3D demos with the gear works if I use the 68k
versions, freezes when I use the PPC-versions.

Same with the demos for StormMESA.

Warp3D in itself works since the WarpTEST program
works and the NeonBars plugin for AmigaAMP.

Anyone with a bright idea as for the cause of this?

(not lack of memory though, I have around 70 megs fast
free when the boot-process is complete).

WarpTest and NeonBars are 68k, so it's prolly your PPC configuration. The
best option would be to reinstall Warp3D. The installer gives you the
possibility to delete the original installation, make use of that,
otherwise you may have old version lying around. 

If that doesn't work, check your WarpUp environment variables. If the
gfxaddr is wrong, it may bomb big time. Check the problems.txt file in the
Warp3D archive...

Maybe Overheating of the PPC or Permedia2?
Or bad "memmode" setting: try with 70ns in setmemmode!

Yes... use the installer supplied with the updates.  Some of the 
info files require toltypes to work properly that are set by the
installer.  The last time I installed my CVision3D monitor file
by hand, I had to go thru the installer script to find all the
required tooltypes to set by hand.

Low Stack ? (But should be the same like for the 68k version, normally...) 
ppc.library stuff installed ? 

Also if you run something like Snoopdos in the background while running a 
Warp3D program this can generate a problems AFAIK...

Sorry, forgot to mention that. That was the first thing
I tried. When that failed to fix it, I resorted to
try to fix it by hand. Needless to say, neither
worked and I still have the screenmode-requester
saying I have a Cvision instead of a Bvision.

It turned out to be a bad gfxaddr variable but...
if it had been overheating, wouldn't I have had
problems regardless of Warp3D? My gutfeeling tellls
me I should have had more spontaneus crashes or reboots
if that was the case.

Besides, more cooling than I have is hardly possible.
The fan from the PSU is blowing air around the
PPC and Permedia and the case is open and air can
travel freely around all componets of the computer and
all extensions of it.

Setmemmode? What's that? Have I missed something here?

Nope. I figured it could be that so I tried to increase the stack to
300000 which should be sufficient. Didn't make any difference whatsoever.
But I finally got it to work as it should. Except for one StormMesa
demo. The Skyfly one. It messes up the workbench screen for me.

And as far as stack goes...I'm of the opinion that if a program needs
larger amounts of stack, it should set it itself - not require the user
to do so.

>ppc.library stuff installed ?

The only mesa-files I have downloaded so far, so yes.

And as far as other ppc-stuff concerned, I'm only running WarpOS
and not PowerUP (apart from ppclibemu just in case).

There are a couple of things in the background as on every Amiga-system

Maybe not... the Permedia 2 chip is barely "idling"
if it's not doing a heavy 3D load.  The rendering
engine in the chip probably consumes most of the
power.  It's quite possible to never have a gfx
chip overheat until you try to run 3D programs.

That's a switch for the accelerator, not the gfx card.

Yup. And add to that that the PPC is also idel most of the time, and thus
in power save mode. When running heavy PPC/Warp3D activity, it can get
really hot...

Only if you have not hidden SnoopDos. If it tries to output to the screen
while hardware is locked you`ll get a deadlock. Otherwise SD is fine. I use it

In fact it's a software for intended for the PPC boards to set the memory
parameters. On the BPPC you can set it on the "startup-menu" of the board
(which you access by pressing the "esc" key during reboot). But if you own
memory that don't fully support the 60ns mode, or just temporarily, the
best thing to do is to set the memory parameter for the PPC to 70ns value
(i.e.: PPCread/writewaitstates and precharge on) and to type in a cli
"setmemmode 60ns" just before launching a PPC software in order to test if
your SIMMs support such a speed. Moreover, i've recently discovered that my
SIMMs support 60ns (on an overclocked PPC board, it's not that simple) for
only a limited period of time (from 30' to 2 hours), after the SIMMs are
too hot and crashes occur.
So i was guessing if Jonas was not in a similar case.

Mine's at 0%, power save mode. After boot, that is. If you run an RC5
client, this is of course something different.

Mine got really hot even before I even installed the Bvision card...
according to the WarpStat program I had a cpu-load of an average

That's a thought but if that is the case: shouldn't
the problems come after the 3D program has run
for a while? Not immediately.

Indeed. But I was trying out that approach when the correct approach
failed miserably. CGFX was still working but it most certainly didn't
allow me to have a Bvision monitor instead of a Cvision ditto.

They may do it fine on your system, not on mine. 
Well, they do everything okay apart from the Bvision part.
Anyway, I've decided to let that be and stick with the
Cvision entry. If it ain't broke, don't fix it...

nope. if you want to screw up your system, then this is the fine way of

Just install CGX4, then update it to 4.1 (with the 4.1 floppy if you got

what are your memory speed settings for the PPC? Have you used a bootmenu
or startup-script command to set them up to be faster - 60NS options
for example?

have you tried different memory? The PPC is slightly fussier about its memory.

Are you running an CPU hacks? What version of 68040/60 library are you using?
what PPC.library and powerpc.library versions are you running?

Have you checked the PAL output? Maybe your stuck because a CLI output window

RC5 doesn't use FPU, so the FPU part of the PPC is powered down. So RC5
doesn't make a 100% heat load.

Hi All,

A bit OT but I was just reading the docs with the latest flash update

that later ones may cause problems.
Can anyone confirm or deny this? 

I`m using V43.6 and as I may have mentioned before it crashes when I switch on
and I have to boot-without-startup and execute s:startup-sequence manually.
Is this the cause? 

Should I return to V40.16? What will I loose?

If so where can I get it these days?

My system (604e 233MHz) outpreforms the wintel machine in software mode too.
I did some timerefresh tests on the tutorial level and I got:

320x240 software 53.8
320x240 gl       47.2
640x480 software 18.3
640x480 gl       26.8

Why is software rendering in low resolutions faster than gl rendering?

That's what I thought but the remarks here had led me to believe
otherwise. 

I can't for the life of me understand why the install program (well,
the update...) lets me choose between Cvision and Bvision when
one single radio-button labeled Cvision/Bvision would have sufficed.

Absolutely not! I have use the Setpatch 43.6b for more than a year in
conjunction with various flashUpdates without having to complain about it.
And now with the new OS 3.5, setpatch version number has been promoted to
v44! So don't bother about it! Setpatch 43.6 IS stable and so is setpatch
44.6

Seems like it uses CVision driver for startup display...
The reason is that the OS, IPrefs i suppose, loads the screenmode.prefs, but
if cannot find the CVisionPPC driver it is supposed to...
I had this problem too, all it took was to delete the screenmode.prefs in
envarc:sys/
Then you have to setup the first CGX screenmode on ya TV or other ugly-res
screen. Then reboot and select this mode, you made in CGXMode, in
prefs/screenmode. 
If this doens't work, it might be because of some kind of fuckup in the
installation of the driver, mine did that as well... It fucks up the
monitor's .info and stuff..
Tell me if it does that, an I'll send mine.
BTW: there's more to a BPPC driver than just that file, so it wont run
perfectly with CVisionPPC driver and other software installed and just the
BPPC monitor file...

It will be there when when you boot up without a CVisionPPC monitor file,
and not screenmode.prefs

Good luck

No! It does exactly the same job as the built-in setup-menu of the board!
The difference is that you controll the moment when you enable the maximum
memspeed settings! Before overclocking, my memory support the fastiest
settings (no waitstates, no Precharge!), wich were beyond a real 60ns
access! Now, with a 66Mhz PPC bus, this is not possible anymore! I can set
the ppc mem speed to 60ns, but patch like "bppcfix" or ppcinstall (for
ppclibemulation) have to be done when in "70ns" mode, otherwise a Warp-os
exception occur as soon as I launch a ppc software.
Setmemmode is just more "handy" for me. (And if, as me, you have
warpjpeg.datatype and a jpeg pattern in Iprefs, it's safier to boot with a
70ns setting).
And it can be found in the old flashUpdates archive, from the Phase5 times.

Why are you all talking about this setmemmode sommin, why not just use the
buildin memspeed controller of the BPPC or CSPPC boards! Hold down Esc and
there will come an "early PPC bootup menu" if you didn't know. Here you can
set the memmode...

Yes. No cli-window, no requestor, no nothing there.

For what it's worth, I'm using setpatch 44.6 without

Yes. If I did that I get into a very ugly PAL-screen but it doesn't help
me much. Not at all to be blunt.

The problem is if I do this I haven't got a monitor entry in the CGX-mode
programs so I can't create a display-mode to use.

Yes, but I still don't buy it. The main difference is how they're attached.
Same amount of video-ram, same Permedia2, same everything. If someone
can tell me one difference between the cards apart from how they're attached
I reconsider my view on this.

BTW, for something completely different...well, not entirely.
Is there anyone here but me that is using the Bvision and the
Commodore 1950 together? For some bizarre reason I cannot get
the Bvision to output a stable 800x600 screen on that monitor.
No matter how I try, the screen "scrolls" up/down. I know
the monitor is perfectly capable of it since I had a 800x600x24 bit
on the Cybervision64 previously.

I don't know that but I find it rather far-fetched that you would gain

A small question here. Slightly OT I'm afraid...

How much room is it in one of those towers? Can you fit in the BlizzardPPC
and BlizzardVision with room left for the Zorro-addon? I have a Prelude-card
laying here that I want to use...oh, and I have a PCMCIA-network card too.

Well, there is a difference, because when using Cvision PPC instead of
BVisionPPC you get some really bad buffering errors in 3D games/demos

It is a known problem, and afaik, it mostly happens with BlizzPPC/060. The
only real solution i can remember is to insert a echo "Phase5 SUXX!" >nil:

When i used the CVisionPPC, after installing CGX4.0, before the upgrade, it
made some pretty bad gfx messup in 2D. In fact, i had to switch to PAL while

Well, the BPPC has ppc.library somewhere ROM'ed in it... while on CSPPC
ppc.library is copied to ram from the harddrive...

Seems like the mode you're trying to use is using a too high (could also be
too low) pixel clock for the monitor.... try altering the pixelclock for
that resolution in CGXMode.
Don't change the pixel clock too much at the time, the Blizzard Vision PPC
board is most likely to crash the system in much too low or much too high
frequencies... 

Good luck

I dont have zorro slots, but im quite sure there is plenty space also with
BPPC and BVisionPPC, or someone has made a BIG bummer...

I have PCMCIA card too, AND HAD A HELL LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IT! 
It does not fit in the Power Tower, I had to order a 90° PCMCIA adaptor, and
when it hadn't arrived after 6 months, I destroyed 2 A1200 motherboards
trying to bend the port, and unsolder it and stuff... well, here on my 4'th
board, i got it working, (the 3rd was destroyed when i was playing around
with overclocking of the different things.) NEVER DO THAT! 
Also the PowerTower design is UGLY! Too wide, it looks like some kind of
cooling storage something... eventhough there is no cryostuff in it...

You're better off with a hightower, and they look nice... :)

Maybe you should just wait till Boxer and boxerppc stuff comes out...

I spoke a hell lot about this on this channel until I found out of this

The stuff in wipeout that wasn't redrawn each frame started flashing with

What Illegal version are you suggesting I am using?

This is no CV/PPC vs. BV/PPC issue, more likely a "good CGX installation" vs. 
"bad CGX installation" issue. It sounds to me like Triple-Buffering fails. 
Check if you have all Tooltypes set like demanded in the readme's that come 
with Warp3D, and if you have all required driver/cgxsystem.library's 
correctly. That should be most likely the problem.

There is definitely something wrong with your setup. Even on my setup (150 MHz 
PPC !!! Though it is a 604e PPC) I get even on AGA (!!!) 21 fps. On Graphics 
Board of course I get much higher framerates. The above posted framerates for 
software and gl sound quite realistically. Actually the (not-released, as
considered too slow) 68k version should be able to beat the 7 fps value 
if I remember right :)

The difference (7 fps for 320x240 and 5 fps for 640x480) sounds also quite 
strange. Why should 640x480 be only 2 fps slower ? I guess there goes 
something totally wrong with the Screenrefresh on your system... maybe a CGX 
related problem ? Was this the software or the hardware renderer ?

Thanks to all who answered. The echo line appears to have done the trick but I
had to leave off the >nil: to make it work so I now get a "Phase5 Suxx"
message at boot time. It keeps me smiling. The CLI closes before WB loads so
no problem.

Now to the flash update. I`m still using a realy old flash but everything now
works ok. I`m thinking "If it ain`t broke..." 

Any comments?

perhaps they planned to have PPC support for the two cards. in which case
it'd be 603e for one, 604e for the other.

two words. you cant.

if you run ANY software which activates the Elbox/power Flyer, then APUS
wont work.

you must run NO activation software if you want to use the first port of the
PowerFLyer as a dumb Pio-0 device for LinuxAPUS


also, dont forget, AmigaOS software doesnt exist when your machine turns
into an APUS box. there is no scsi.device or ata.device etc - its all PPC
kernel code - and quite a few things arent supported.  in a wierd twist of
fate, the lowly Blizzard SCSI *is* supported, whereas the big-boy CSPPC SCSI
aint yet!

True enough but I'm not sure there is a relevance to that. Especially
since I'm kicking ppc.library out (as much as is possible) with the
help of ppclibemu.

No, I don't have those problems. Then again, I just got Warp3D up and
running so I won't swear that they're not there. They're not evident
in the "Space" demo or the "Orbit" game at any rate. Just about
all that I've tried so far.

They were, checked it several times, as I had no idea what could be wrong, I
tried everything at least once... And even read the readme's a few times :)

The only way to fix it, apparently was to install the update to CGX 4 that
contained a seperate BVPPC monitor file, not like the first versions of CGX
4 which had a mixed monitor file, with low compatability with BVPPC
boards...

BTW: The installer for the update failed, so I copied it manually, and it
works perfectly!

Yep, but all I've tried have major bugs, besides, running dual ppc

There are others important tooltypes/arguments! Those called
"blizzppcnoprecharge", no68kreadwaitstates", etc...
But the "noprecharge" options allow the memory to wlork at a even higher
speed! That's in this case that >50Mhz bus cause pb with the PPC memory
access. the 60ns option is equivalent to the "noreadwaitstates" and
"nowritewaitstates" options.

On a 604e board I suppose! Don't even think of such a performance on a 603e
board! All I've seen so far shows me that, talking about 3D (and GL/mesa)
rendering, 604 board outperforms the 603 ones in all case! I've seen that
recently running Doggy and H2-demo on a 603e (mine!) and a 604e. The
difference is hardly believable!

Funny, I can run more than one PPC-app at the same time without
a crash. I agree that the PPC-plugins are slightly buggy though
and well, for the most part kinda pointless too. Why waste cpu-power
on that?

But in the latest release of AmigaAMP it seems to be useful for
me again...now I can actually play mp3-files over samba-mounted
devices without hickups in the sound.

>so I stick to 68k plugins

Any programmers around here? Someone that wants to write a plugin
for either AmigaAMP or Amplifier that makes use of the LCDaemon

Hello,

Wee, funny, just lost 10 mails. Anyways, i saw Bo Simmons write about the BPPC
multitaskcrashbugthing. 

Until lately, i've been suffering from this ever since i got my board, but it
seems gone now. Uptimes are normal now(24h+), with both rc5, mpega and ppc
datatypes running. I don't know what changed this. And no, it wasn't heat
problems. I regulary repair/cleanup my heatsink and fan. The heatsink/fan
gets dusty as hell, and the fan starts rotating slower. I use swabs(sp?) to
get the dust out of the fan, and a drop or to of bicycle oil for the fan.
Works great. Anyways, if anyone has just the slightest clue what might be
causing this, please tell. It seems that there are several BPPC owners
suffering this problem.

Kind regards

please can you not spread such untrue information? If this sort of thing

I run many things on my BPPC, with no crash.

8-) I thought someone was already working on one of these - seems kina
neccesary after reading the Miata webpage (look for the 'key cracking Miata'

Sorry, I meant 60 MHz... Just got a bit confused, the original crystal for
my 060 was 50MHz, so I mixed them up, of course not on the board, but just

Well then there's definately something wrong with your setup. I run several
PPC applications all the time and I've never had any problems!

Anyway, where can I find these PPC plugins? Or even better, If someone has
written a plugin for AmigaAMP, send me the source and I will compile it for
PPC if possible.

It's because the 604e is a very fast chip. In fact, the Amiga software
renderer of Shogo sometimes outperforms the PC software renderer. Whenever
much stuff is on screen, the Amiga version is about 1 to 2 FPS faster than
the PC. And that's a 400 MHz K6/2, with an AGP x2 graphics board (a
GeForce, but no hardware acceleration used...)

Yup, it got up to 20 fps on the tutorial level. It was a 66 MHz 060,
though. The problem was that the 060 wasn't able to cope with the
geometry. Whenever two monsters were on screen, the 060 version would
break down dramatically, up to 90 % at some points.

It's about 70 % faster in 320x240, while for the other numbers, it's about
50 %. Given the inaccuracy of the slower rates (the time slices are
bigger), it's comparable.

But, Steffen's right, it's way too slow...

But still, it should not be "freaking slow" on a 603e... even if slower than 
on a 604e...

The difference, BTW, is most likely not the CPU, but the Memory-Access of the 
Board. The Blizzard-Boards have only a 32 Bit Memory Access which slows down a 
lot of applications.

Try http://amigaamp.amiga-softeware.com and hit the plugin links, dunno if
there are some ppc ones there, but I know Stian Strøm has made some ppc

Someone here wrote something about the ppc no precharge stuff... but I've
either lost the mail, or my mind! This happens quite a lot, I'm sure I've
read it, but suddenly it isn't there, either a Yam bug "dissapearing
mails", or I have a wild imagination... :) 

He said that this ppc no precharge meant something importan that I ofcourse
don't remember... :) 
Anyways, tried changing the settings to NO blah blah for the first 68k and
the last 68k to precharge
If this 68k was set to no precharge, I got all sorts of startup errors...
Like "DHO, Program failed, wait for disk activity to stop blahblah" :/
All the PPC I set to NO blah blah... 
Is that the best setting?

Does not allow you to set your own screenmode, and looks very bad on every
system that does not have the exact mode stian used to create this. Stian

· The dirty contact to motherboard is out of the question here, I have
cleaned
  it several times this year.

· Dodgy SIMMs, maybe, but they cost me a lot, (So I expect quality) and they
  don't get hot at all, sommin like 35°c 

· Powerproblems, maybe, but I don't know how to check.. I've checked for
voltage, and it says 4.84 volt on the 5 volt on the 
  BPPC board. I've been told this means nothing... 

· There is no difference when I disconnect the onboard fan, exept less noise
  and a warmer heatsink.

· I have hacked the PPC card, but these problems were there also when the
card was brand new and unhacked... I have also only "hacked" it with the
crystals and the resistors at the multiplier...

· Incorrect WarpUP settings, might be it, but the same problem was here when
I used ppc.library ... :/ Anyways, could someone please post some working
WarpUP settings?

· Old flashrom, nopez, I have the newest... (at least the newest from
DCE.com)

 "no read/write waitstates" = 60ns Mode
"NoPrecharge" = Memory accesses faster than 60ns (as fast as the CPU
involved and the memory can handle).

So The fastest setting is reached by setting all memory parameters to "NO"!
With good Simms, it works fine on a 68040/33Mhz
But for the PPC, it's safe with a 50Mhz Bus, but can cause crash if you
overclock the PPC (since I overclock mine, PPC no Precharge don't function
anymore).

It looks like your SIMMs don't handle such a speed! Perhaps you have 70ns
SIMMs, or if they are 60ns, try 68K&PPC-Precharge (and the others to "NO")
to see if that solve the Pb! Or just activate the 60ns mode, it's easiest!

Me to... but I must say that my A1200 has never been the most

The 603 and 604 have issues about caching that depends on the
screen size.  The same thing occurs in ADoomPPC.  Peter McGavin
and I talked it over and did up a list of resolutions that will
work better on the 603 or the 604.  Get the ADoomPPC archive on
AmiNet and try one of the resolutions marked as faster for the
603.  I made an MMU option for ADoomPPC to disable caching for
the screen buffer for faster rendering; the MMU option doesn't
work in current versions of the emulation ppc.library because
of the way the PPC memory flags are handled.

put the required flashprogram onto a floppy drive. 'install' the floppy
('install df0:')

take out the Harddrive

now, reboot the machine - holding down s and both mouse buttons.

deselect all drives other than df0:  now choose the 'start without

now, run the flash rpogram, with FORCE as a an option, eg

blizz060update force

Subject: @{b}[warpup] WarpUp@{ub}

Hello there

I have some trouble with Warpup and somebody of you might be able to help
me.
About a week ago i ran the program "Frogger.WOS" which worked for about 2
hours. Since then no WarpUp/PPC Application seems to run properly. They all
crash within a few minutes/seconds (which causes your errormessage to
popup: either "illegal mem access" or "illegal instruction"). With the
program SnoopDos i tried to locate the source of the problem and it seems
that it`s either the 68040.lib or the Powerpc.lib. I replaced the 68040
library with the newest lib that`s on the Aminet and tried to run the
programs. With the new library they run a bit longer before they crash but
they still don`t run stable. I even reinstalled the whole OS 3.5 with all
its libraries (after deleting the old ones and formatting the hd properly)
but no success. I only found that the 040 library which comes with the OS
is incompatible to WarpUP (no application runs with that library)

Has anybody an idea what`s causing the problems?

my config: A4000/040 PPC604e/233 128mb ram, picassoII, a GVP scsi
controller.
Versions:
68040.lib   44.2
PowerPC.lib 15.0

thanks a lot

Roman Schaub

p.s. might it be that the trouble is caused by AsimCDFS (i have 2 cd-roms
attached to one bus and switched them, the rom at port 1 to port 2 and
vice-versa, but read/write access to those drives runs properly...)

The biggest problem is that it always uses a screenmodus called 1086455858
and that looks different for what screen settings u use, when u change stuff
in CGX mode the display in WOTF and TTT is most likely to change... Please
add a screenmode requester... This is both for 68k and PPC versions of your
new plugins..

I dont have other HW than 2 HDs and a CDROM (with broken audio out) (all 3
mounted on a Randy Rom IDE thingie),  a PCMCIA Accton netcard, my BPPC and
BVPPC (don't hope those two have problems working togeather ;), and that's
about it...
Cannot see any HW that should cause these problems...

Anyways, please, all BPPC users, send me a list of your complete system
hardware, and add a brief description on how your system performs, and if
there are some things wrong as well.... I'll work out a list with what
hardware that fucks up what...

Hi Stian

I have been checking out alotta old, and newer, demos, and found that there
are alot effects that can be used for plugins for AmigaAMP. 
Forexample I like the coloured lighting effects in I-Surf
The "bug sufing on water" effects and the "action on sound" effect (where
the group names are quoted following the music) in River Horse.

And these apparently don't take too much CPU, as it is running smooth on 060
and AGA.
If someone is interrested in making one big plugin with all these effects,
please contact me, and I will tell you all the effects that I think are
gorgeous...

Simple help:
Change to your AmigaAMP:Plugin directory. There you have for each Plugin (WOTF and
TTT) a directory (trancedata and wavesofthefuturedatadir) with a screenmode.cfg
file. Just delete it and start the Plugin again.
It will pop up a screenmode requester!! So you can choose your screenmode to
run on!

Both NOPRECHARGEs work correctly here with 66MHz bus and overclocked PPC and

one.

No, it does not, I've tried to do that. It did as you said all right in the
previous versions, but in the newest version it just saves its own
resolution without asking, in the file screenmode.cfg (also if you delete
it). I know I'm right on this coz alotta people on the AmigaAMP list have
complained about this too... 

What version of WOTF and TTT are you using? I think the newest are WOTF v3.0
and TTT v2.0

Here NOPRECHARGE works with the PPC only.... The problems with 68k in
NOPRECARGE I blame on my ram modules... (I had to buy 3 sets of 2 x 32MB
EDO Ram to find some that actually think they are 32 MB and not 16 MB.

neh... ;) hehe... Doesn't work on the PPC versions... of some weird
reason it wouldn't compile when I had the screenmode requester in
the code... I had to comment it away and set the ModeID directly
in the source file... which isn't to good... Another problem with
the PPC plugins is that they don't seem to load the config files...
Compiles just fine, but it just doesn't werk... 

But... Jepp, It does work on the 68k plugins... Just delete the

You are right!! :( I`m using also WOTF v3.0 and TTT v2.0 . These version, I
think soo, are compiled using the same source code as the PPC versions, so
the plugin doesn`t open an Screenmode requester!! 
So try downloding an older version of the plugins!! Than you try my trick
with  deleting the screenmode.cfg from its dir and then starting the old
version of the plugin!! The old version will surely (just tried using WOTF
v2.0) popup an screenmoderequester and you can choose your screenmode!!
 And it will save also the screenmode.cfg to its dir. But it doesn`t work with the 
PPC version of the plugin. (as Stian Strom described in his mail)

Well, first of all get rid off those ppc.library and ppcdiss.library to get
a clean non powerup system,
then install the latest warpos distribution available from haage web site
(BTW : when is expected a new version fixing the MMU  problems discovered

installer 44.10 works perfectly! Perharps have you encountered the same bug
as me with the cachecdfs included in the Amiga-OS 3.5: It corrupts most of
the >100Ko files, and as the installer is bigger than 100Ko, it was
corrupted when i first install the OS 3.5. I've tried with asimcdfs, all
was OK. Strange, my cd-rom drive under cachecdfs reacts exactly as a HDD
with a bad maxtransfert rate (for example: maxtor drive do the same if
maxtransfert rate is higher than 0xfffe).

Use asimcdfs or amicdfs to read the OS 3.5 Cd instead of the built-in
cacheCDFS. It's this file system which is broken (or doesn't support some
cdrom-drive?)

Strange, but not all files! Most of them, and some time, if you retry to
read the same datas (for large image files for expl) later, after the CD
cache has been renewed, a corrupted picture could be cleanly read. Strange
but true!

Sounds really weird. That means that all the >100KB programs I've installed
from CD using cachecdfs are buggy like hell?

Anyways, the topic of this mail was originally Amiga AMP plugins...
We're making (or more like, about to make) a plugin for AMP, using parts
from demo source codes (we already have a few deals with a few demo
groups). But we need programmers who can do it for PPC (WarpUP of course).
(68k's too slow for us) :) If there is one WOS programmer out there who
would like to cooperate with us, drop me a line...

That wasn't the problem. It only failed on expert level. It worked in
intermediate level. And the bad english is the fault of AsimCDFS? :)

Hmmm... if you have already the sources as 68k, what is the problem of 
recompiling them to PPC ? Or are they ASM ?

It is ppcamiga.lib and storm603.lib

If these do not exist in your stormc:lib directory, it is very likely that you 
only have the 68k version of StormC. Then you need either to get the update to 
the PowerPC version, or to install one of the two freeware compilers with
