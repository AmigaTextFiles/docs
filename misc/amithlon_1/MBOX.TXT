I think a PPC card emulation is not so important, because a 68K Version
is available from most programs (FusionPPC, Wipeout, Heretic2+Shogo exclude=
d) which are
running much faster under Amithlon like the PPC-versions on CyberstormPPC.

But I think a Warp3D-version with support for the Vooodoo/GForce cards for =
the
amithlon is very impotant (for example Payback, Earth2140, GLQuake and for =
the coming
Descent Freespace which are all available as 68K).=20

We now need 68K's from H2, Shogo and Wipeout :-)

with best regards
Christoph

Hi All,

As a musician I'm interested in the Audio and MIDI 
capabilities of Amithlon.

Could someone elaborate on the abilities of running 
such programs like Bars & Pipes, SFX, Studio16, ect.
on Amithlon.

How will the audio side work??? PCI sound cards???

Any new MIDI progs in the works??????

What of MP3, Wave, IFF ???


Amiga community , what say you ???????? 


Bob

Hello,
Having read the FAQ there are still a few things I am unclear on.

Can Amithlon be running @ the same time as another OS, say Win98 on the sam=
e hardware?
I currently use a 060 A3000T networked to my PC which requires two monitors=
& two keyboards.

I would like to have it all in one machine so that I can run my desired Ami=
ga programs on Amithlon
and still have the PC available.

If they both can be run simutaneously, need they be networked, or are all f=
iles available to both OS's?
Thanks for the help looking forward to the release.
Ron=20

Short answer. No, Amitlhon will not run parallel to windows or any other OS
on the same machine.

This really depends on what you mean by "at the same time". Amithlon
*can* run on a machine that has another OS installed, and another OS
can run on a machine that has Amithlon disks/partitions "installed".

However, both Amithlon and whatever other OS you have in mind take over
the machine, so they cannot be *running* at the same time. I.e. you can't
run Amithlon, and then somehow switch to Windows, without first ending
Amithlon --- and vice versa.

The best bet for exchanging files is to use a FAT prtition somewhere.
AmigaOS is not blessed with drivers for many of the "usual" PC filesystems
(like ext2, reiser, NTFS etc), and in return, most PC OSs cannot really
understand Amiga filesystems (and disks) very well. So a FAT partition
is some sort of "common ground".

P.S.: I hope this one gets through. Yahoo lists seems to really dislike

Hello all,

so I finally joined this list...

I know linux 2.4.6 supports ATA100, but I just wanted to make sure 
and ask if it's supported in Amithlon.

I don't want to rush anyone, but when will there be drivers for 
mainstream cards like the SBLive and realtek network cards?

Now, something completely different: are there plans to port parts of 
the AmigaOS to run on the x86 natively? Would this be possible with 
AROS sources (in a realistic way, without having to rewrite 50% of 
the code).

Also, 150 euros for AmigaOSXL is rather steep. Will there be an 
Amithlon-only version? Think about poor students like me!

Thanks,
Brecht

Hi Brecht,

> so I finally joined this list...

So I see. I expect it get a bit busier around here now that the packages
are actually released.

>I know linux 2.4.6 supports ATA100, but I just wanted to make sure
>and ask if it's supported in Amithlon.

Yes, it most certainly is. There's an incomplete hardware compatibility
list at http://www.alt-woa.org , but I expect a more comprehensive one to be
released soon.

Amithlon is currently built around the 2.4.12ac1 kernel

>I don't want to rush anyone, but when will there be drivers for
>mainstream cards like the SBLive and realtek network cards?

Wealready have drivers for the RTL8029 cards, but I suspect there will be
more in time. Same goes for the SB Live. AFAIK both would just need
Amiga-side drivers at this stage, though I might be wrong about the SB Live.

>Now, something completely different: are there plans to port parts of

I think it's early to talk about "plans". I believe Aaron said that the
Amithlon team have a similar arrangement with the AROS project that the
MorphOS team have, so anything is possible in the future.

>Also, 150 euros for AmigaOSXL is rather steep. Will there be an
>Amithlon-only version? Think about poor students like me!

I don't think so, but I'll let the Amithlon team and H&P clarify that issue.

I asked this a while back, but didn't get a clear answer.

Can I put the Amithlon CD and a Zip disk with some Amiga programs into a
PC and run a demo, without touching the hard drive? Should the Zip disk
be Amiga formatted, or PC formatted?

In other words, use a Zip disk as a 100 Meg hard drive.

Yup --- the release that has just gone on sale is using a (hacked to bits :)
kernel 2.4.12ac1

>I don't want to rush anyone, but when will there be drivers for 
>mainstream cards like the SBLive and realtek network cards?

Realtek network cards _are_ supported. Well, RTL8029 cards are; Not the
RTL8139 (i.e. 10 MBit/s is supported, the 10/100 MBit/s cards aren't yet).

Drivers are a matter of someone writing them..... I know too little about
either of those areas (sound, networking) to actually write a driver; However,
all the info needed for someone who does understand this stuff to write
a driver is available. And looking at Aminet, it often seems only a matter
of getting the documentation.... So the hope is that the community has enough
bright lights to get some more cards on the supported list.

I suspect this is quite possible. I currently don't have any plans of
doing any of this porting myself, but I wouldn't be surprised if some
of the AROS people will soon start replacing AmigaOS 68k with their
code one routine at a time. 
AFAICT (and this is pure speculation, mind you!), Amithlon might just
be what AROS needs, and vice versa. AROS gains a way to combine the
x86 functions they already have with the AmigaOS 68k code for the as-yet
unimplemented code, thus allowing them to use, test and debug that x86 code
so much more easily; And Amithlon, on the other hand, might gain some cool
OS hacks as a result of having AROS code running on/in/under it.

>Also, 150 euros for AmigaOSXL is rather steep. Will there be an 
>Amithlon-only version? Think about poor students like me!

That's up to H&P. If they want to, they can sell Amithlon on its own.
Maybe a polite and friendly email to them might bring your point across...

Note, though, that they are for SB128 (not SBLive!), and RTL8029
(not RTL8139). I have heard about someone working on the 8139 drivers,
but at this point, those cards are not yet supported.

I'm still not sure Don. I'll have to try it out with an LS120 disk next
week. I'm sure there's a way to do it, but I don't know if it works
straight off, or if a little workaround is needed.

I don't know about ZIP disks, sorry --- I don't have one, so I can't
try this out.

What you *can* definitely do is to put your demo stuff on a CD, though.
The boot CD is not needed anynore once things are booted.
If your software needs to write files, most PCs these days tend to have
ram enough so you get a rather sizable ramdisk.

If you (or the people whose machine it is) are paranoid, you could even
get Amithlon into a read-only mode, where writing to actual physical hard
disks is impossible. But as your typical PC doesn't have Amiga-formatted
parttions around in the first place, that really isn't necessary.

Doesn't Amithlon work with RDBs? If so, you should be able to prep a Zip
in HDToolbox, install Workbench and the other software you need and
boot from it, just like with a normal Amiga.

So it is confirmed that Decent Freespace will run with software render in

The problem is more one of "how and where will the ZIP drive show up",
rather than one of "how to find partitions on the ZIP drive once it's
there".

I don't know what the SCSI ZIP drive will show up as (hard disk or CD-ROM,
or something else entirely), but the parallel port one is almost certainly
going to require an Amiga-side driver.

The 100Mb IDE zip drive on my pc shows up as B: 
I always assumed A: & B: were reserved for floppies ?
Go figure...

The ZIP and LS120 IDE drives are treated as removable devices and will use
A: & B: if available. My PC doesn't have a real floppy drive, only an IDE
LS120, and that shows up as A:.

I think Don was specifically asking about the internal IDE devices, rather
than the SCSI or parallel ones. Theoretically, in this scenario it should
work, but I hate giving affirmative answers without testing out the theory.

The points about the SCSI and parallel versions are relavent in those cases,
of course.

The machines I have in mind have IDE Zip drives, I think.

Anyway, my Amiga XL should arrive soon, so I will just have to try it
and see.

I guess even sources to linux drivers might suffise if manufacturers don't

Yes, that is the whole idea I have :)
But, I meant to ask if the Amithlon x86 API makes this easy/hard. Or is it
just a matter of using some sort of cross-compiler?

There is SB128 AHI drivers, and Realtek8029 drivers, no SBlive drivers yet
(dunno if there ever will be)

Paula emulation is removed, but paula sound can be used with the
'PuhDerBear' program (a NallePuh derived Paula to AHI mapper).

I guess it's the 8139 one? :)

Anyway, the 8029 based cards are dirt cheap. Really DIRT cheap. So if
your network can handle a 10 MBit card, you can usually just add one of
them for the price of a nice lunch...

>I guess even sources to linux drivers might suffise if manufacturers don't
>want to release HW specs?

Yes and no. I have used linux kernel driver sources as hardware reference
in the past, and it does have its drawbacks. They don't actually describe
the chip --- they just describe how to do *certain* things with the chip.
In particular, whatever the kernel driver wants to do.
If all you want to do is the same things, great --- just do them the same
way, and chances are pretty good that they will work. If, however, you want
to do something different (like using your S3 Virge card completely in
memory mapped I/O mode without ever touching the legacy registers), then
seeing how to do something else doesn't really help much. 

In effect, you are at least one layer removed from the document you
really want to look at (instead of looking at the spec sheets, you
are looking at the code written by someone who looked at the spec sheets).
In many cases, probably two (looking at the code written by someone who
disassembled the code written by someone who looked at the spec sheets).

>Yes, that is the whole idea I have :)

It certainly helps to have a separate machine to do the x86 compiles, and
a network between them. Otherwise it would currently involve a lot of
rebooting (right now, you need to use linux gcc to compile the x86 parts.
A cross compiler under AmigaOS should be possible, but apparently is hard
to build).

Other than that --- no, it should be fairly easy. Yes, you need to take
endianness issues into consideration, but that's about it. Address spaces
in 68k and x86 space are identical, and calling x86 routines is identical
to calling 68k routines, so replacing even individual library routines with
x86 implementations is quite easy. There is a (rather dirty!) example of
this that should be on the AmigaOS XL CD, in the archive containing all
the sample sources and other GPL sources.

There are native AmigaOS drivers for SB128 and RTL8029 network cards
(i.e. the SB128 driver is an AHI one, and the RTL8029 driver is a SANAII
one).

Paula emulation has been removed; However, Martin Blom has written a great
tool called "NallePUH" for real Amigas that uses the MMU to trap and 
redirect Paula register accesses to AHI... And as he put it under the GPL,
I could change it to work with Amithlon. So while Amithlon does not, in
and by itself, have Paula emulation, it *does* allow to redirect many
Paula-using programs to AHI through an Amiga-side program (called "puhderbaer",
which will only make sense if you understand German and Swedish :)

I think 100Mbit cards are at least as cheap as 10Mbit cards now..

Of course this method should only be used as a last resort :)

I'm have very little experience in programming (C), so go easy on me :)
Say, I want to 'port' an AmigaOS application (68k code) to run natively on
the x86. Do I just have to recompile (and maybe set some compiler options)
or do I need to replace all the used functions by x86-specific versions of
these?
I would guess that a simple recompile would do it, but I just want to be
sure :)
So, basically... old 68k programs wich run on the 68k emulator use the x86
libraries?
And apps wich use the math libs would have a major speed increase without
being recompiled (for the basic mathxxx.lib functions anyways)?

Hi Brecht,

> Ah, thought he was talking about the sblive.

The SB Live! was mentioned, and no, it is not supported at the moment.

> Ah, so an MMU is emulated now?

No, that's why "NallePUH" had to be changed into "puhderbaer".

There should be an easy way booting the Amithlon without
having the CDRom. Actually, my external CDRom acts like
a dongle for Amithlon. Please give me a short description
how to boot my notebook without pulling the drive behind me.

I have been meaning to write such a guide for a while now.... Always
got other catastrophes landing in my lap :(

Today, I should get around to doing the "there must be 50 ways to boot your
Amithlon" experiments (with an old 100MB drive just for testing), and I
will write down exactly what I am doing... So expect this to be up
within 24 hours, together with the boot test images. There, I have given
myself a deadline..... That usually does the trick :)

Bless you!
Great, I hope you will cover how to make solid state Amithlon boot
drives someday soon too:
Sandisk, M-Systems, CompactFlash, etc.
That way a fully loaded Amiga HD (FFS from a 1200, etc) can be
insta-booted on a laptop.
Is a 32 MB IDEflashdrive big enough?
What about an 8 meg disk on chip?

You ROCK man!

I suspect so.... Do you happen to know whether it is supported by the

Yes. It's a very good choice for Amithlon indeed.

Got QNX and Amithlon CD's in yesterday from Softhut. QNX is installed to a
24Gig partition on a Sony VAIO 1GHz Athlon with 256 Ram. Also installed XL
at the same time and it has problem which I'll address separately in another
message.

This is the first of several questions, again which I'll post in subsequent
emails. The first question is: How do I install Amithlon to the PC hard
drive? Within QNX? Or to a new directory? I'm unable to find such info on
the Amithlon CD or, if it's there, I have not found out where it is.

Forget the QNX way of doing things. That's the UAE way, and you can't
install AmigaOS into a directory on another OS for Amithlon use. You don't
really "install" Amithlon as such.

There are two ways to run Amithlon:

(a) with a drive dedicated to AmigaOS/Amithlon use only. In this case, just
connect your drive and use the HDToolBox on the default Amithlon startup to
intialise and partition it. Remember to make one partition bootable with a
priority higher than -2. When you close HDToolBox, click on the new
partitions and format them, then copy all the files from amithlon_rd: to the
bootable partition you made earlier and reset Amithlon. Reset Amithlon, and
you will boot into your new Workbench partition.

(b) on a dedicated partition within a disk shared with other partitions for
other operating systems (such as Windows or QNX). For this, you MUST have
some free unpartitioned space on your hard disk, or know how to make some.
Then comes the tricky bit: you need to make the new partition of type 0x76
(hexadecimal 76). There are a number of tools that allow you to do this,
but most are Linux based. Very few Windows partition utilities will allow
you to create partitions of "unknown" type. Bernie will shortly be
releasing some in-depth info on installation methods, so look out for that.

When starting Amithlon, this partition will be seen as a dedicated Amiga
disk, and you can proceed as in method (a). This virtual disk can be
partitioned in HDToolBox with as many Amiga partitions as you need.

Sorry if it sounds over complicated or too brief an explanation. I would
have thought this would have been covered in the manual, but I guess not.
Does AmigaOS XL even have a manual? Does that have an Amithlon section?

Just curious, as it seems we still have no stocks of AmigaOS XL in the UK
yet, and the WoASE show is only a week away.


Regards,

Bill Hoggett

Hi all !

I just joined this group because I got Amithon
and now I have some questions:

1) I have a GERICOM notebook (K6-2 400 Mhz) and the Amithlon
CD boots till the bouncing ball. The ball keeps bouncing
and nothing happens more. Any idea whats wrong ?

2) I have a desktop (PII MMX 300Mhz) with a Voodoo 3 2000 GFX card.
Everything works fine except that I can only use screen resolution
up to 640x480x8. Picassomode says "maybe not enough grafics mem".

3) On the same PC as above is a creative soundblaster 128 installed, but
the driver refuses to work too ("unable to open AHI.device unit 0")
says Amplifier.

4) The "PCMaus" patch for the Mouse-Wheel support works only if I boot
from the reset-proove Ram-Disk. I have drag&dropped this tool
to my WBStartup but nothing happens.

Btw. Amithon even on a PII 300MHz is much faster (2x-6x) than a 68060 50Mhz.

Ciao,

Thilo

I tried copying the isolinux directory over to a FAT partition on my 
measly 200MHz machine, rebooted into DOS, the typed the following 
commands:

cd d:\isolinux
loadlin @amithlon

Unfortunately, I have no idea if it really works. I'm waiting to pick 
up my new Dell machine tomorrow. :(

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed
From: Douglas McLaughlin <stricq@y...>

Hi,

I got my package from Software Hut today. It is installed on a 20G HD all 
to itself. For now I'm just booting with the CD.
First off, let me say, VERY nice job! I love it. Installed Genesis and 
was on the web in a few minutes. Envoy is installed and talking to my 
other two real Amigas on my LAN. Cool beans!

Now, about my problem. I know you were worried about the ATI driver, so 
here's my feedback. As far as the Workbench goes, I can use any 
resolution/depth I choose and everything works nicely, no 
problems. However, once a program opens its own screen, things go 
screwy. Here is a list of things I noticed:

1. The screen is rotated to the left about 10 pixels. So the first 10 
pixels of the screen are on the right hand side of the screen. The mouse 
won't enter this region, but I can move windows there alright.

2. I cannot screen flip back to the workbench. See 3.

3. Quitting the program that created the new screen works OK, just that the 
screen never disappears. I'm usually left with just a blank grey 
screen. The system is not locked up, I can still manipulate the WB 
blindly. Anyway, only a reboot fixes this.

I'm using an ATI All-In-Wonder 128 Pro, which is the Rage 128 Pro 
chipset. It is 32MB, and AGP, if that matters. The screen resolution used 
was 1280x1024x32, the same for all programs I tested and WB.

So far, this is the only problem I've noticed.

Doug

Try hitting Scroll-Lock before the logo screen comes up (i.e. very early
in the boot process). That should put a "boot:" prompt at the bottom of
that logo screen.
At that prompt, type "debug" and hit enter. You should now get all sorts
of kernel messages; Try and see whether you can see anything that looks
like it's going wrong.... 

This really should be in the manual!

Yep, the V3 is not directly supported, but inly in Vesa mode at this point.
This means you get one resolution, one colour depth. You can choose _which_
mode, but as Vesa does not provide for changing video modes at runtime,
once you have chosen, that's it.

For how to choose, please see the section "kernel options" in the "HD install"
guide on the newly opened http://www.amithlon.net. Of course, this, too,
should have been in the manual. Apologies if it isn't.

Could you do a "pciscan" and have a look for Functions that have the
code "1102/xxxx"? And if there are any, report the value of "xxxx"?

Before you do that, though --- did you change the AHI Prefs? The
default setup on amithlon_hd comes setup for VIA AC97 sound; You'd need
to go through all 5 units (unit 0-3 and "Music unit") and change the
mode to "SB128: 16 bit stereo++"

You might want to get directly in touch with Harald on this one; His mail is

or

Best of luck,

Bernie

Hello everyone,

As it seems everyone really really really wants to boot Amithlon from their
hard disks, rather than from CD, I finally made myself put stuff onto
my Amithlon.net domain.... And one of those things is a detailed instruction
on how to boot Amithlon from HD :)

It also has the latest and greatest bootable test-images for both CD-ROM
and floppy disk, which allow you to check whether your hardware is supported
under Amithlon or not.


So feel free to take a trip to


http://www.amithlon.net/


and sample the goods that are available there.

There are some sections of the site that still need fleshing out, but I
wanted to make what's there available as quickly as possible. So please
excuse anything that still says "soon to be here"....


Cheers,

Bernie 


P.S.: A big big big thankyou has to go to the lovely young lady who stayed
up till 5am to put together the HTML coding on that site. Anything that
looks good is hers, and anything that is bad, or broken, or looks ugly,
is probably me screwing it up. If you like the site, drop her a note
at webmaster@a... :))

Hello Bernie

First of all thanks for your help!

> This really should be in the manual!
Which manual ? Maybe I`m blind but there is NO printed manual and only a
very
very short "manual" (it`s more a readme) in PDF format (which APDF can`t
read
correctly btw). It deals 23 pages about AmigaXL and 1 Page about Amithlon.

I will check out your other hints and will report the result.

Ciao,

Thilo

Hello Bernie

On 27-Ott-01, you wrote:

I've downloaded the test image CD-ROM, and tried it.
It boots and arrives at the Amithlon logo screen, so
I guess it works someway... (BTW nice logo and nice bouncing boing).

BUT...
I have a Matrox G550 graphics card, and in the video mode
section I get only:
VESA VGA
Modes: builtin 640x480@8...

Does this mean that 640x480@8... is the only video mode available?
Wouldn't the G550 be retro-compatible with the G450 (I wanted
to buy the 450 that i know is supported, but it's not available
anymore...)
Any chance there will be support for the g550?

In the Processor section I get 2 messages:

-does not support CMOV
-does not support RAT stall

what does that mean? will this prevent the use of Amithlon
on that PC?? or will it run with some limitation??

I have already ordered AmigaOS XL... well, if that means
that it doesn't work on my system I still get some value
with the bundled ArtEffect and Writer... ;-)
and I can always take into consideration a mother board
upgrade... even if I hope it won't be necessary as
i've just gone through a week of hell with the last
hardware update ;-))

Bye
Francesco

Matrox G550 is not supported with the current Matrox driver, so you will not
have 2d hardware accleration. You should however be able to get other
resolutions and color depths, with the Vesa driver. (HOWTO: explained a
couple of 100 times :).

Will there ever be support for G550?, i don't know.

Ah, now that you mention it --- the G550 is the new one from Matrox, isn't
it? Which is probably _not_ compatible with the G450 driver. Hmm.....

Well, it _will_ work, with the VESA driver. And I would be fairly confident
that a linux framebuffer driver isn't too far off. And as the linux kernel
is GPL'ed, anyway, upgraded kernels for Amithlon can easily be made
available for download.

But not actually available on the web anywhere, afaict.... So it's going
to be on amithlon.net pretty soon. Once I have passed my landlord's
inspection on Tuesday, that is (can you imagine having an inspection in
a geek house. *Eek*!)

Hello to all,

yet testet the amithlon on my AMD K6 500 MHz. I use a extra Harddrive - and
it works fine!

Only my mouse will not work :-((

I tried my USB-Mouse - no USB!
I tried a serial Mouse - nothing!
I tried a PS/2 Mouse - nothing!

Any idea, what I can do?

Thanks for help.

Have you tried the mouse driver located in the Amithlon dir on the boot
image?

the USB mice might work if you enable either 'USB keyboard support', 'Legacy
USB support' or 'USB support in DOS', in your PC's bios setup.

Hello Lasse,

thanks for answer. My USB in the bios is aktivated. There isnt the problem.
Do you mean the "PCMouse" in the Amithlon dir on the Workbench?
I tried to run it, but nothing...

My USB-Mouse (optical) is not on (lights) but the USB-HUB has Power (the
lights are on).
No Problems under Win.

Any other idea?

Thanks.

The bios option im talking about is not to enabling USB, but to enable USB
support under Dos, its offent described as USB legacy support. if this is
enabled the motherboard might route USB cordinates true the PS/2 port, so
AMIthlon will see the mouse as a normal PS/2 mouse.
Also try looking around in your bios for anything PS/2 related, it is
possible in some Bios's to disable PS/2 support

Will do as soon as I get Amithlon. It's the least I can do
to thank you for your kindness ;-) and also for the great idea
you had that les us make good use of that "ugly" PC!!! ;-)


Glad to hear that the processors messages don't prevent me
to use my systeme (yes it's a K6-II 500 Mhz).

I hoped it was that... I've read all the msgs in the ML so
I knew all the things about the VESA mode... only was worried
that the msg meant I was stuck at 640x480 8 bit...
Having only 1 video mode is not a really bad limitation
when "the mode" is 1024x768 32 bit ;-)

Thanks again... I'll let you know when I receive the package
(guess around tuesday)
Bye
Francesco

I can relate on this subject, maybe...
In the past weeks I had very BIG problems trying to install Win98
on my updated pc... the main problem was the mouse, as I
had decided to use a Logitech Itouch desktop (USB radio keyboard+mouse)

I could not make the mouse work (also the old serial mouse)
until I decided to try to enable USB keyboard support and take
out both the old keyboard and serial mouse.
Suddenly win found the keyboard and mouse during installation
and I could go on...

Maybe using USB mouse AND keyboard will do the trick...
I guess there's some bug in the bios which prevent to use
the input devices in mix mode (one USB and the other standard).
Maybe!

-My Amithlon package has still to arrive to me. But my question was 
about the Multitasking of the Emulator.... I use amiga for Background 
Applications, Using Amithlon are there problem with multitasking or 
is there only an advantage over the performance?

-Qnx has particular video driver that can determine with more 
precision the real efficence of the Video Board. I inserted a Sis 
video card that was not directly supported by Qnx but i can arrive to 
1600x1200x32bit without any probz. Is possible to do the same thing 
with AmiThlon?

Hello Marcelo

I will do some in the next few days. From my
feeling I would say Amithlon is about 5-6 times faster 
(on a PII300) than WinUAE, maybe this is slighly different 
on faster machines.
But important is also that the speed is constantly the same,
because there is no underlying Windows, and it is more
similar to a real Amiga. On WinUAE I noticed that things
which are equal on my Amiga are very fast and others very slow
on WinUAE.

Ciao,

Hello all,

maybe it would be possible to modify G-Rex or Mediator drivers to work with
Amithlon? Maybe you could share resources? win-win!
I saw the realtek 8139 is supported by the G-Rex ;) http://vgr.com/g-rex/

Hi,

When trying the boot tester floppy on my machine, the image loads, but I
get no Amithlon logo, only a black screen.

The SCSI/IDE led starts flashing a little bit after I get the black screen.

The machine is a Compaq Proliant 800, dual P3 500 MHz (SMP kernel when?:)
with a Creative PCI 3D Blaster GeForce2MX gfxcard (maybe this is causing
trouble since it's PCI? On the other side, Redhat 7.1 works very well).

I've tried the debug option, but no text output is visible.

Any clue on how I can get Amithlon to work on this machine?

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@y...>

I was wondering if the Amiga 64 bit filesystem patches are loaded
from the CD before it attemps to boot on a harddrive.

As the Amiga uses 32 bit filesystem (4 gig limit) on it's boot
partition under OS3.9 on a cold boot, the "setpatch" command 
has to be executed before it can access drives larger than 4 gig.

So, is the 64 bit stuff loaded from the CD or do we still have
the "Real Amiga" 4 gig limit to employ on boot partitions... ?

Regards

It would almost certainly be trivial, as all it would need is a 
dummy pci.library that thunks the respective calls over to the powerpci.library
(which happens to be rather versatile).

However, this would be dubious from both a legal and an ethical point of
view. Whoever programmed those drivers for the G-Rex did so to add value
to *that* product, not to ours. And Elbox is quite strict about their driver
distribution, so you can't actually *get* their stuff legally for use on
Amithlon (and their hardware is so screwed up that they have to use 
video memory for DMA, anyway --- yuck!)

I am not going to do this sort of thing for the above reasons (and also
because I have no API information whatsoever on the G-Rex or Mediator
pci.library --- intentionally so, so that nobody could possibly claim I
copied anything from it). If someone else were to do it, that wouldn't
be my problem, of course, and I certainly won't jump up and down and
say it's a bad thing :)

>I saw the realtek 8139 is supported by the G-Rex ;) http://vgr.com/g-rex/

Now all you have to do is to get the G-Rex crowd (aka "people associated
with Ralph Schmidt") and Haage&Partnet (aka "the scumbags behind MorphOS",
to heavily paraphrase Ralph Schmidt) to cooperate. And while you are at
it, how about squaring the circle, bringing peace to the Middle East,
and making me richer than Bill Gates? :)

Amithlon behaves just like a real Amiga.

The way I understood it, the problem is not so much one of the 
filesystem (which is stored on the disk along with the partition),
but rather one of the scsi.device which needs to be patched.

Amithlon doesn't use the scsi.device, and amithlon.device is fully
64 bit clean to start with.

However, if you have partitions beyond the 4GB range, it is imperative
that you store the filesystem in the rigid disk block structure (which
you can do by adding it to that disk in HDToolBox). Otherwise, the ROM
based (i.e. 3.1) FFS will be used for FFS partitions.
Having the filesystem alongside the partition is good practice, anyway,
and exactly what the rigid disk block stuff was invented for.

It pretty much does 68040.

>Does it do the 68060 specific instructions for instance..

Nope --- can you actually name some? I have run a lot of "060" software
under Amithlon, and so far, it seems "060 software" does not imply 
060 only instructions...

>How about the obsolete 68000's: MOVE SR,<ea> ?

If the 040 supports it, it should be there. Of course, for those archaic
things the interpretative CPU emulation is used, so they won't be

I believe the PC's floppy drive controller is hard wired to
read 9 blocks / track...

Amiga floppies use 11 blocks / track & the pc's controller 
can't be modified (or switched) to read them...

Both use 79 cylinders, but that's not the problem..

You will have to format 9 blocks / track (MSDOS mode) 
to use the floppy drive on your PC.

Unfortunately, PC hardware doesn't allow for reading of Amiga formatted
floppies (that's the short version... the long version would take a lot
longer, and really in the end say the same thing :( ).

So you won't be able to use those floppies directly. Sorry!

You have a fairly nice Amiga, though --- any chance you might be able
to use it to copy those floppies to MS-DOS formatted floppies using it?
Or how about networking the two machines? Burning stuff to CD?

Or, if you have a hard disk that can be physically used in both machines,
you could put all sorts of stuff onto it in the Amiga, and then move
it over to the Amithlon machine.

Does any of that help?

Actually, the problem is that PC floppies use 3 MFM synchronisation words
at the start of a block, where Amiga floppies typically only use two.

As on the Amiga, the whole decoding thing is really done in software,
anyway, reading PC floppies is not problem.

On the PC, the floppy controller is actually more intelligent and
independent than on the Amiga, and looks for the sync words itself ---
and only ever finds *two* on Amiga formatted floppies, while it is looking
for *three*. Which means it never actually starts transferring data.
Bummer!

Bernie

P.S.: Oh, and let's not speculate about what possessed the original Amiga team
when they decided to go with two sync words instead of three. *sigh*

Hello, 

I just booted the floppy test image. It shows 6 possible modes of 
nVidia TNT. But it seems to recognize only half of the inbuilt
ram memory. Why that?

2. What means: processor 'suffers RAT stall'?

Do you mean half the memory on the TNT? That's *not* what "chip ram" refers
to.... The memory on the TNT is separate from that.

Or do you mean that "fast" inly shows about half your memory? In that case,
please consider that

* chip mem can be used as fast mem (it's exactly the same under Amithlon)
* linux, the emulator, and especially the translation cache take up
some memory. So you won't have all of it available for the emulated
Amiga.

>2. What means: processor 'suffers RAT stall'?

That the JIT compiler has to work around some really really stupid design
decisions by Intel. No problem, just a very annoying "feature" of PII, PIII 
and Celeron CPUs.

>PS: I like the 'amithlon' logo :-)

Kudos to Lasse for that one. I like it, too :)

Hi Bernie,

Where are the installation instructions for Amiga OS XL? I have QNX on
its own hard drive and I thought that the Amiga software was suppose to
be put on the hard drive thus making the machine an Amiga. Right now I
can get it to boot off of a CD. Am I missing some thing?

Should I have the AMIthlon system installed in a file on a Windows 2000
Pro system?

If I install an amiga floppy drive on my PC will it work to download
Amiga programs? My PC has an Athelon 1.4Ghz cpu, 256 Mb DDRSDRAM, 60 Gb
IBM hard drive, Matrox G550 video board, and a CD drive.

The Pioneer DVD drive just got in. Will it work in the AMIthlon?

Thanks for your help.

Arnold

Thanks for the explanation, no-one ever explained it so simply...

btw: I guess the amiga designers liked the idea of getting 880K
from a 720K disk... 
Unformatted of course, but who uses unformatted disks ?

Sorry, I meant the missing 060 instructions that are emulated,
I suspect they will still require the 68060.library in libs: ?

Also, how about the 68060 FPU ?

No, that instruction was dropped on the 68010+

Anything that uses that, probably won't work anyway,
but I thought i'd ask...

The only bit of software I can remember doing that,
was the filerequester on TextCraft Plus....

Hi Christian,

A little?

>But i can't Install some Software from my Floppy Discs because i
>can't mount the DF0: Drive.

OK, I thought this was common knowledge by now, but maybe not. There is no
easy way to read Amiga floppy disks on a PC. There are two possible ways to
do this:

(1) Catweasel ISA. Sadly this is hard to find and is not supported under
Amithlon (there's no ISA support). So far the maker of Catweasel has stated
that he is not interested in making a PCI version.

(2) Disk2FDI. This is also not supported under Amithlon, and needs MSDOS to
run plus two PC floppy drives. See the home page at
http://fast.emuunlim.com/disk2fdi/

By far the best way to do this is to convert Amiga floppies to dms or adf
files, then mount them under Amithlon using fms.device off Aminet.

The 2 vs 3 MFM sync words is not what's responsible for that. They could
have gotten the exact same 880k with 3 sync words. *Sigh*

Hello Lasse, hello Fracesco,

I have checked your Information. In my BIOS is only two points about USB:
1.) USB keyboard support - Enabled
2.) Legacy USB support - Enabled

There is no posibility to change something in PS/2 or other USB things.
Mouse and Keyboard work fine under USB in Win98SE - without problems.
The keyboard under USB and Amithlon dont work. Each key let move the
mousepointer - uncontrolable.
The PS/2 Keyboard works fine under Amithlon.

But every Mouse will not work. I think a serial mouse will ever work, but it
dosnt.

Any other idea?

Thanks.

I can relate on this subject, maybe...
In the past weeks I had very BIG problems trying to install Win98
on my updated pc... the main problem was the mouse, as I
had decided to use a Logitech Itouch desktop (USB radio keyboard+mouse)

I could not make the mouse work (also the old serial mouse)
until I decided to try to enable USB keyboard support and take
out both the old keyboard and serial mouse.
Suddenly win found the keyboard and mouse during installation
and I could go on...

Maybe using USB mouse AND keyboard will do the trick...
I guess there's some bug in the bios which prevent to use
the input devices in mix mode (one USB and the other standard).
Maybe!

Nope --- I really don't see any reason for emulating 68k instructions in
68k, when we have perfectly good emulation of those instructions in x86
code.

>Also, how about the 68060 FPU ?

Same thing --- Amithlon actually emulates a hybrid of 68040 and 68882
FPU. It supports the new 040 FPU instructions, but it *also* directly
supports the FPU instructions dropped in the 040 and handled through
68k side emulation.

It would be silly not to --- why should we calculate a sine (I think that's
one of the dropped ones) using an 68k trap and several other emulated 68k
FPU instructions, when instead we can simply use the x86 "sine" FPU
instruction?

What's your thoughts on the reason they did it ?

I was under the impression it allowed more data density to be 
encoded rather than using the space just for sync purposes..

Try to Disable both of these options, and go with the PS/2 mouse and PS/2
keyboard, the motherboard routing to PS/2 might screw things up?

Ok, here is a crazy idea :-)
Use the serial mouse and one for these drivers for serial mouse
http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminetbin/find?serial+mouse
remember to set the serial device to powercom.device. I have absolutly no
idea if this will work, but i suspect it will.

IF you have a real Amiga, and IF you can network Amithlon with your real 
Amiga using Envoy v3, you can mount the real Amiga's DF0: onto Amithlon. I 
have already installed some floppy based software this way and it works 
perfectly.

Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

Not really. Try to use Disk2FDI utility. It worked for me.
Here's begining of readme file:


Preview Version 0.7 - 14th of July, 2001
Disk2FDI is the utility to read Amiga, Atari ST and PC formatted disks on
your PC computer, without any specific hardware extension, except a second
disk drive unit. It will save them as FDI files which will be supported
in future releases of the Tand-Em and FAST emulators. ADF fileformat is
also supported for Amiga-formatted disks.

Hi,

I did some more testing with Amithlon and this is what I found out:

1. Upon first boot into Amithlon (after going through full BIOS boot) the 
WorkBench screen color palette is messed up. Even the color wheel displays 
strange and contorted color variations, this on a 32bit screen 
depth. After the emulator reboots, the colors are fine.

2. Opening a program on its own 16bit screen works better, but the colors 
are messed up as above and the screen is rotated about 10 pixels to the 
left. When the program quits, this screen will disappear, but it leaves 
the WorkBench screen colors distorted until the next reboot.

3. Opening a program on its own 8bit screen works OK, except that the 
colors are really, really messed up. The screen is NOT rotated at all, and 
it does go away when the program exits. It does leave the WorkBench colors 
messed up as above, though.

Again, this is with a 32bit 1280x1024 WorkBench. All screen sizes were 
also 1280x1024.

Hi,

If/When you make updates to the Linux core stuff, in order to use these 
updates, will it be necessary to use the boot from hard disk method? Seems 
like this would be necessary.

Hi,

Since hearing about and reading up on Amithlon, It disappoints me that so 
much of the Amiga community and websites perceive it as just another emulator 
like UAE. My take on it since the beginning was that it was very much an OS, 
especially once the x86 native porting starts to happen - no different to 
MorphOS or OS4.

Why wasn't it endorsed by Amiga fully, why pass it to H&P to market as an 
emulator? Will they allow it to progress, to grow alongside OS4?

I hope that the Amithlon community will be taken seriously by the PPC users 
and can work together.

Regards,
Chris Moore.

Ok, here is a crazy idea :-)
Use the serial mouse and one for these drivers for serial mouse
http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminetbin/find?serial+mouse
remember to set the serial device to powercom.device. I have absolutly no
idea if this will work, but i suspect it will.

Let's hope so. I have used Amithlon for a couple of days now, and I 
must tell you that the speed is greater with each program than on my 
Cyberstorm PPC. 

The other truly amazing thing is that many, many-- most in fact-- of 
the programs and utilities that I have used for years work perfectly 
with this program.

Someone should clap Bernie on the back for a job well done.

I do have a question, though. Neither the serial nor parallel ports 
(modem and printer) works yet. I am certain that I don't know which 
driver to use. Help me if you would.

Thanks,

RLFrost

Thanks! Now, if someone would come over and clean up the mess I created
in my study while doing the job :], I would have more time to answer questions
right now. As it is (me being stuck with the cleanup :), I will be fairly
busy until tomorrows inspection by the landlord.

That's easy --- you want the "powercom.device" for serial and 
"powerpar.device" for parallel. These in turn might rely on amithlon.resource,
so you should have that on your sys: disk, too (in fact, it's probably a good
idea to copy over the devs: and libs: from the amithlon_hd; Or, if you are
concerned about overwriting existing libs, at least everything that looks
foreign and new to you :).

If it doesn't work, give snoopdos a try. That's a great tool!

Hi,

as many people requested me to send them the Amithlon updates,
I decided to just put them up on amithlon.net after all.
Please understand that these are temporary, and will be superceded
by an official solution in the hopefully rather near future. At that
point, you'll need to back out these fixes and move to the official
solution.

If you still want them, grab the following 20k file:

http://www.amithlon.net/updates/amithlon_updates.lha

It contains two lha archives with the actual updates, and a README
explaining how to apply them from within your emulated Amiga. No need
to mess around outside that environment.

Ah, one last question --- how to get them onto the "Amiga" if you
don't have internet access from it? Well, I'd suggest the easiest way
is to use a DOS-formatted floppy. Download in your internet-enabled OS,
put them onto the floppy, then boot into Amithlon, insert the floppy,
and double-click amithlon_hd:Storage/DosDrivers/PC0:. The floppy should
now show up (note, however, that there is no disk change detection. So
if you swap disks, you need to type "diskchange PC0:" in a shell. Sorry,
PC hardware sucks at this sort of thing!).

Hi Doug,

Would you explain how you were able to change the Amithlon screen to
1280x1024 from the PAL default bootup?

Hello Bernie

I am using Fat95 on my A4000tower, Are these updates for the Fat95 nessary =
for that machine as well or are these Amithlon specific?

DO I need to use them with AmigaXL?

How fast is AmigaXL comparied to Amithlon?

Will AMiga XL run at the same time as Windows NT?

Will it allow me to access all the same hardware and drives and printer/ser=
ial/56k modem/PCMCI/USB etc on my Laptop?

thanks,.

Hi Bernie,

Dunno if you'd consider it important, but I tried the hardware test disk on
VMWare, and it doesn't work at all -- it finds no display modes, saying "You
passed an undefined mode number. Press Return to see modes available/Space
to continue". There's a 30 second countdown, then it says "Uncompressing
Linux... OK, booting the kernel"... then... nothing. I believe VMWare has a
VESA driver as well as its own emulated 'graphics card'.

You can download the 10MB beta from their site (www.vmware.com) if you're
interested. I personally don't desperately need this (especailly since we're
still waiting for AmigaXL to appear in the UK), but it could be handy, as
well as just, well, cool... :)

Just thought I'd report it anyway!

See ya,

Nope. You don't even need them to use FAT95 on Amithlon. It's just so
damn convenient to have Amithlon load the filesystem before it scans
the disks, and have it mount the partitions itself, without any mountlists
or anything :) (and it was so damn easy to add, seeing as I needed to
scan the MBR disks, anyway, looking for virtual drives.... Of course, then
getting the drive letters right was a whole different matter. DOS sucks. :>

>DO I need to use them with AmigaXL?

Nope. Shouldn't do any harm, though --- the amithlon_patcher will simply
say that it isn't running in Amithlon, and quit without doing anything.

>How fast is AmigaXL comparied to Amithlon?

Slower. That's all I will say (last time I said something more definite,
I got rather upset mail....)

>Will AMiga XL run at the same time as Windows NT?

Nope.

>Will it allow me to access all the same hardware and drives and

Nope, it runs on top of QNX 6.1. If QNX 6.1 supports it, your chances
are good.

Bernie,

I just bought a new Dell machine, and I'm excited about getting 
Amithlon running. When I boot the floppy test program, however, I get 
the following errors.

map_mem (f0000000, 08000000, f0000000
DA: Could not map 08000000 bytes at f0000000 to f0000000
Abort in line 3347 of direct_access.c

My machine is a 1.7Ghz Pentium IV machine with an NVIDIA GeForce 2 MX 
AGP card. It has 128MB RAM.

I tried reducing the AGP aperature size to 32 megabytes, and this 
seemed to help (I could see the boing ball in the upper left hand 
corner), but the debug output remains the same.

Thanks,

Greg

Using CrossDOS that came with AmigaOS 2.04 and up makes problems cause of
8+3 filenames. But it should be possible to mount FastFilesystem onto 720KB
floppy disks using "mfm.device". Then you have long filenames and full Amiga
compatibility.

Or you use FAT95.

Silly me, you can ofcause use it with AMIthlon, but only on Vesa2.0
compatiblity mode. So you wont get hardware acceleration.
(on the other hand, a GF3 is WAY overkill for AMIthlon, imho).

True GeForce3 is way overkill for most things. 
But, hey I just threw a new 40GB drive on my system for Amithlon and
AmigaosXL to share and let WinXP and Win2K Server use the other drive.

Just want to say that tests with a bootable RDB-Zip
works perfect using an Adaptec 2940 with external SCSI-Zip.

But...Amithlon doesn't recognize my Teac CD-R56S yet. I can
boot from CD with the CD-Writer and it will be used as a cdrom,
but when I start Amithlon from harddisk, it finds my old
2GB-NEC-SCSI-Harddisk but not the CDWriter. All manual SCSI-Queries
also failed.
My Device-listing looks like this (booted from hd)

device [1] 0 - IDE Harddisk (onepartitioned)
[1] 1 - IDE Harddisk ( "" "" )
[1] 3 - DVD (no ID and Vendor-Text until mounting)
[2] 0 - amithlon boot image
[3] 3 - Amiga formatted SCSI HD
[2] 0 - again the amithlon boot image
[3] 3 - and again the Amiga HD

There seemed to be some query problems with the SCSI-Device ?!?

Mfg,
Thomas Omilian

That's strange. There shouldn't be any difference in device detection no
matter where you boot from. What are you using to do a SCSI query? I
suspect the drive is being seen a CD-ROM device at all times, but you don't
see it when booting from HD because there's no CD inserted. <grin>

All CDROMs should show under cdrom.device, whether they are IDE or SCSI. If
using a cd burning util with a SCSI writer, you should select the
3rd.amithlon.device, and the writer should be seen there.

> My Device-listing looks like this (booted from hd)

> [3] 3 - and again the Amiga HD

This is normal. Remember Bernie said there are two ways of detecting
devices? The first appears under "amithlon.device" and you will see most
devices here. However disk images will also be detected by
"2nd.amithlon.device", hence the duplication for that, and SCSI devices by
"3rd.amithlon.device", therefore the SCSI HD gets duplicated again. Just to
nake things even more interesting, CD-ROM drives are detected by
cdrom.device.

>There seemed to be some query problems with the SCSI-Device ?!?

Possibly, possibly not. Can you see the Teac under 3rd.amithlon.device or
cdrom.device? Don't try to use the scsi.device, as that is completely
redundant under Amithlon.

If not, get the model of your SCSI card and undetected SCSI devices and mail
Bernie a bug report. We testers have tried to cover as much as possible,
but we've only had our own finances to fund the tested equipment, so not
everything is guaranteed to work.

Regards,

Bill Hoggett

The QNX cd dated 09/03/01 that I got in the box today from Software 
Hut from my Amithon order today has missing documentation.

The documentation for the supported network cards ( 
x:\html\support\Supported_Network_Drivers.htm ) is missing :(

The documentation for the supported Platforms/Processors
( x:\html\support\Supported_Platforms_and_Processors.htm ) is also 
missing :(

The documentation for the supported Character I/O ( 
x:\html\support\Supported_CharacterI-ODrivers.htm ) is also missing :(

Hi,

Anyone (Bernie?) could explain us how Amithlon "sees" a modem? Does it look 
for a serial device (/dev/ttySx)? If yes, so is it possible to recompile the 
kernel (after patch it since I think it has no ISA support anymore) used by 
Amithlon to detect an ISA modem (a real one, not those winmodems...)?

I don't want to buy another modem (mine is an expensive :-) USRobotics) just 
because Amithlon doesn't support ISA devices. I think real ISA modems are 
easy to be detected under linux, aren't they? ;-) What's the real limitation 
for that lack of support?

Marcos.

From: Douglas McLaughlin <stricq@y...>

Hi,

Just wanted to mention that I was able to get Amithlon to boot from HD. I 
used PartitionMagic to shrink my C: by 20Meg and then formatted the new 
20Meg partition as FAT16 and then used the instructions on amithlon.net for 
"If you do not have an existing OS". I never did need to boot into any 
Linux mode as the one all-important command: syslinux is also supplied in 
that file as a DOS executable .com file. Very nice. I then used BootMagic 
to either boot into WinXP or Amithlon. It works perfectly.

Bernie, I assume that all I have to do to boot into the small version is 
change the top line in the syslinux.cfg file, yes?

We got the QNX 6.1 CD directly from QSSL. Please report any problems with it
to QSSL directly (http://www.qnx.com). We are not allowed to modify it.

Documentation on supported hardware you can find on their website as well.

Thanks! Now, if someone would come over and clean up the mess I 
created
in my study while doing the job :], I would have more time to answer 
questions
right now. As it is (me being stuck with the cleanup :), I will be 
fairly
busy until tomorrows inspection by the landlord.


Sorry, Bernie. I would help, but the mess I made installing this 
Amithlon has my wife in a state. I'll trade you her response for 
your landlord's.

Congratulations again for a very nice job.

Hi,

So what are some common conditions that would cause a Phase 5: Emulator 
Crash? On a couple of occasions I've had a program crash, and the Software 
Failure window pops up immediately followed by a reboot, however, sometimes 
it doesn't auto-reboot. Just curious.

I've read all the procedure, but I see I have to have it running
from hd before being able to do it. Anyway will do it later
when I have time to resize my hd partitions and after solving the
mouse problem (read ahead).

It works that's sure but there's a BIG BIG problem. 
I can't manage to let it use the mouse whatever I try!!

I tried:

- USB Keyboard+mouse (Logitech cordless desktop) that runs ok
in my win98 setup and was recognized (both keyboard and mouse)
even during the win installation (way before installing the
Logitech drivers), so I guess the system maps them as "standard"
mouse and keyboard.
Results: keyboard works but not the mouse
(always fix in the left upper corner of the screen)

- usb keyboard and a Logitech serial mouse. 
Results: keyboard works but not the mouse

- as before, but disabling USB keyboard support in BIOS
Results: neither keyboard nor mouse work (quite obvious,
but with pc you always have to try... ;-) )

- normal keyboard and a Logitech serial mouse.
Results: keyboard works, but not the mouse!! 

- also tried an OLD OLD Genius serial mouse, and that
doesn't work too (not sure if it worked anyway).

What else could I try???
Anybody can give me advice? An Amiga without mouse support
is quite useless...

Look forward to hear good news! ;-)

hallo,

Is it normal that it takes about 4 to 5 minutes before Amithlon 
boots? The boing ball is showing and then it takes a lot of time.

Perhas it is because i have on the EIDE (2) 2 HD CD rom Zip 
drive. SCSI card 2 network cards.
PC is Amthlon 600 MHZ 128 MB GForce2 MX

Bye,

Sure, you need to tell MiamiDX to use a SANAII device and the device is in 
the default location:

Devs:Networks/powerne2k.device

Hi Jens,

> I wonder howto access the network card(s) under
> Amithlon using MiamiDX ...

You simply need to select the powerne2k.device as the driver. This is a
SANA-II driver and acts just like any other Amiga network driver. I'm
assuming you are using a PCI RTL8029 based card?

> Havent found any documentation for this, yet.

I'm not surprised. :(

Somehow all the important documentation (mostly readmes) included in the
last Amithlon snapshot have disappeared from the release version. This
includes ALL the information about special Amithlon device drivers, and lots
of other stuff.

> I am very sure, that someone has written this somewhere,

Bernie & Harald DID write all this somewhere. It just doesn't seem to have
been included with the CD. Don't know why.

Hi Don,

>Perhaps it could be posted to amithlon.net

I suspect it will be, as soon as Bernie has had a chance to recover from the
Landlord invasion and clean it up a little. In the form I have it in it may
cause more unnecessary confusion, but it also contains vital information
which is otherwise missing from the AmigaOS XL package.

Nor is there a system program *nettrap* mentioned in the help program under 
/network configuration troubleshooting./ 

QNX inc is not good about answering naive questions.

That's why they're not aimed at desktop users; their market is the embedded
developer 'community', for whom they've simply made a nice environment to
work in...

The Soundblaster Live! 1024, is not supported by AMIthlon. (yet)
Dunno about the ISDN adaptor.

That FAQ was meant to be completed today, but circumstances beyond my control
delayed this by (hopefully) a day :)

Ok,

got a SB128 and RTL8029 and *gosh* they both works
really fine. (Ok, Puhderbaer is not working already).
So my system seems to be complete, but...

The TEAC CD-R56S4 does not work. I must disconnect
it from the SCSI-Chain (cut off the power). With that
drive on amithlon won't boot from HD. Perhaps someone
could check my debug-output ???
Doubble-Trouble for me because a) I had that CD-R more
than 2 year now without problems, no bad written CDRs
and using it under different plattforms.
b) I wanted to buy the newer Teac CD-RW in near future
and now I'm not sure if Amithlon can handle it.

Thomas Omilian

Hello, 

this is a first draft of the official AmigaOS XL FAQ. I hope it
helps. Tell me your questions and I will add more answers.


$VER: AmigaOS XL FAQ 45.1 (2.11.2001)
-------------------------------------


Q: How can I install a bootable AmigaOS 3.9 volume under AMIthlon?

A: First you need to make sure that you have sure that AMIthlon has access
to an Amiga harddisk. This can either be a real physical harddisk that is
RDB formatted, a new harddisk that you can initialize with HDToolBox, or a
virtual harddisk partition on a PC (MBR) formatted harddisk.

When you have an old Amiga formatted drive just plug it to the PC and it
should be there when you boot AMIthlon again. When you have a new harddisk
you want to make available to the Amiga only, just plug it to the PC,
restart AMIthlon and use HDToolBox to install it. Just select
"amithlon.device" when HDToolBox asks for a device name. Then select the
harddisk in question and then select to install it. After this you can
create partitions on it.

When you have some spare space on a PC (MBR) formatted hardisk then use
your favorite PC partitioning program to create a new partition with the
type $76 (decimal 118) on it. Note: Not all partitioning programs allow
specifying the type of the partition by its number. Read "How can I
partition my PC harddisk in order to use AMIthlon and AmigaXL?" for
further information. After creating that partition boot into AMIthlon.
When you start HDToolBox you should see a line like "VrtDsk1". This is the
partition you created. To AmigaOS this partition is a complete Amiga
harddisk! It does not know about it being a partition on an PC harddisk.
You can now install and partition this virtual Amiga harddisk.

After you have made available some Amiga partitions you can install
AmigaOS 3.9 to one of them. Just use the AmigaOS 3.9 version that is
supplied on the AmigaOS XL CD. Note: Do not use any other AmigaOS 3.9
version. The version on the AmigaOS XL CD has been specifically adapted
to be immediately bootable under AMIthlon and also AmigaXL. It not only
contains AmigaOS 3.9, but the necessary Picasso 96 system + drivers as
well as the AHI sound system + drivers.

The AmigaOS 3.9 on the AmigaOS XL CD comes in an LhA archive to conserve
Amiga protection bits: In order to create a PC bootable CD to allow
booting AMIthlon from the CD we had to use a burn program that does not
preserve Amiga protection bits. Just click on the "Installation" icon as
it should depack the archive for you. You can also depack it manually and
store it on the harddisk for later use.

After installing AmigaOS 3.9 all you need to do is to make the harddisk
partition you installed it to bootable. Start HDToolBox, select the
harddisk and partition in question. Then make the partition bootable and
choose a priority above "-2". Usually "0" is a good priority to start
with.

After this just hit Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga (well its Ctrl-Windows-Windows on
your PC keyboard) to reboot AMIthlon emulated Amiga.



Q: Does AmigaXL understand Amiga partitions on real or virtual Amiga
harddisks? Can I boot from such a partition just like AMIthlon?

A: Yes, it does. "axlhdd.device" detects all physical Amiga harddisks,
"axlvhdd.device" all virtual Amiga harddisks as partition on a PC (MBR)
formatted harddisk (type $76, decimal 118 just as with AMIthlon).

However AmigaXL does not directly support booting an Amiga harddisk
partition cause they are not mounted when the emulator starts. Amiga
harddisk partitions are mounted at the beginning of "Startup-Sequence" via
the shell command "MountAmigaHDDs".

So you can make a minimum AmigaOS 3.9 system on the QNX side of AmigaXL
and then let it boot into your real Amiga partition. Just have a look at
"AmigaXL/Extras/BootAmigaHDD" on your AmigaXL CD. "BootAmigaHDD" provides
that minimum Amiga system.



Q: How can I partition my harddisk in order to install AmigaOS XL to it?

A: DISCLAIMER: Partitioning on current computer systems is always a
difficult and risky task. Only do it when you are sure what you are doing
and have made a backup before! We reject any responsibility for damages
that might occur on your system.

In order to install AmigaXL you need to install QNX. Although QNX can
be installed under Windows we recommend that you install it onto its own
partition:

The QNX installation routine looks for a non partitioned area on your
harddisks. So in order to let QNX install to an own partition just make
sure you have a free area on your PC harddisks. If you have an older BIOS
you should make sure that the QNX partition is below the first 8.4GB of
your harddisk. Any modern BIOS with LBA mode support should not have this
limit.

QNX can use its own boot loader. The QNX boot loader supports for large
harddisks on LBA enabled BIOS' and harddisks. It supports chain loading of
Operating Systems and thus is able not only to boot QNX but also to boot
Windows or Linux (when you installed LILO into the partition boot block of
the Linux boot partition). See "How do I use the QNX boot loader?".

In order to install AMIthlon to harddisk you need a partition that
contains the AMIthlon emulation environment files (see isolinux-Directory
on your AmigaOS XL CD) as well as a boot manager. Furthermore to you
eventually like to create a virtual Amiga harddisk as partition on a PC
(MBR) formatted hardrive:

To boot into AMIthlon you need a partition that holds the AMIthlon
emulation environment files. This is a heavily modified Linux kernel and
an initial RAM disk file that holds the AMIthlon emulator and a minimum
AmigaOS 3.9 installation. These files are stored in the "isolinux"
directory of the AmigaOS XL CD-ROM and take about 7MB of harddisk space.

Besides that you need a boot loader to load AMIthlon from a harddisk
partition. See "I do not want to place the AmigaOS XL CD into my CD-ROM
drive whenever I want to boot AMIthlon, how can I load AMIthlon directly
from the harddisk?"

We recommend that you use a 50MB FAT16/32 partition in order to boot
AMIthlon. When you use Linux you may also use a ext2fs partition or even a
reiserfs partition.

Aside from this FAT partition you eventually want to create a virtual
Amiga harddisk as partition on a PC (MBR) formatted harddrive: This is a
partition of type $76 (118). AMIthlon as well as AmigaXL will treat this
partition like a real Amiga harddisk: You can use HDToolBox to install it
and create partition on it.

There are several tools available to partition a PC harddisk: Note you can
use HDToolBox only to partition real or virtual Amiga harddisks. To
partition a PC harddisk you need another partitioning tool.

A good comercial partition tool for PC harddisk is "Partion Magic" by
PowerQuest (see http://www.powerquest.com). You should be able to get it
from your local PC dealer. Partition Magic is able to shrink some kind of
partitions like Windows FAT16/32 partitions! So you can create free space
on your harddisk by shrinking an existing partition.

There are several Linux boot disks out there which sport a partitioning
tool. We recommend the Debian Potato Rescue boot disk. From it you could
install a complete Linux distribution. But you can also only simply
partition a hard disk. Just select monochrome or color display and then
the keyboard you are use. Then select "Partition a harddisk". You may also
start the partition tool from a shell by selecting "Execute a shell". In
the shell enter:

cfdisk /dev/hda

"/dev/hda" is the primary master harddisk, "/dev/hdb" primary slave,
"/dev/hdc" secondary master and "/dev/hdd" seconady slave. SCSI disks are
"/dev/sda", "/dev/sdb" and so on.

You can find the boot disk at every Debian FTP site, such as
"ftp.debian.org" or "ftp.de.debian.org" in the directory:

/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/images-1.44/rescue.bin

Write this file out to a disk (see "How can I create all the special boot
disks I need?").

You can find more information in:

/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/README.txt

cfdisk allows you to set any partition type. cfdisk expected partition
types to be entered as hex numbers. Use "76" to install an Amiga virtual
harddisk partition.



Q: My PC harddisk is fully partitioned. How do I create free space on it
in order to install QNX/AmigaXL or AMIthlon?

A: DISCLAIMER: Partitioning on current computer systems is always a
difficult and risky task. Only do it when you are sure what you are doing
and have made a backup before! We reject any responsibility for damages
that might occur on your system.

Well in this case you have to shrink an existing partition, delete an
existing partition or buy a new harddrive. To shrink an existing partition
you can use the commercial partitioning tool Partition Magic from
Powerquest (http://www.powerquest.com).

Also GNU Parted, a freely available partition tool, is able to shrink
Windows FAT16/32 and Linux ext2fs partitions. We included Parted on the
AmigaOS XL CD in the "Contribution/AmigaOS XL/Parted" directory. You need
to write out the "partboot-1.4.20.img" disk image to a floppy disk
(see "How can I create all the special boot disks I need?").

dd if=partboot-1.4.20.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k

You can find more information on Parted and download recent versions
under:

http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html

Once you create the Parted bootdisk, insert it into the floppy drive and
reboot your machine. You should boot into a Linux shell. The boot disk
gives you some instructions. Just start "parted" to partition your
harddisk. As a default it uses "/dev/hda" the primary master
harddisk. Use

parted /dev/hdb for primary slave harddisk
parted /dev/hdc for secondary master harddisk
parted /dev/hdd for secondary slave harddisk
parted /dev/sda
parted /dev/sdb ... for SCSI harddisk

"print" gives you a list of all partitions on your harddisk. You can use
"move" or "resize" to move or resize FAT16/32 and ext2fs partitions.
"mkpart" creates a partition, "mkpartfs" creates a partition at formats it
with a filing system - you can use this command to create the FAT16/32
partition where you can store AMIthlon and boot loader files - and "mkfs"
just formats an existing partition with a file system. Use "help" for more
instructions.



Q: I do not want to place the AmigaOS XL CD into my CD-ROM drive whenever
I want to boot AMIthlon, how can I load AMIthlon directly from the
harddisk?

A: DISCLAIMER: Partitioning on current computer systems is always a
difficult and risky task. Only do it when you are sure what you are doing
and have made a backup before! We reject any responsibility for damages
that might occur on your system.

Create a approx. 50MB big FAT16/32 partition (see "How can I partition my
harddisk in order to install AmigaOS XL to it?"). When you use Linux it
might also be a ext2fs or reiserfs partition. Format it and then create a
directory named "amithlon" on it. You can format it directly under QNX.
Just boot QNX from harddisk or CD-ROM. Log in as "root" and open a
terminal. Type "df" in your terminal. Now you should see a list of mounted
or unmounted partitions:

/dev/fd0 0 0 0 100% 
/dev/cd0 0 0 0 100% (/fs/cd0/) 
/dev/hd1 90069841 90069841 0 100% 
/dev/hd0t14.1 7742720 6784 7735936 1% /fs/hd0-dos/ 
/dev/hd0 29302497 29302497 0 100% /dev/hd0t118 
/dev/hd0t12 1956008 1436952 519056 74% /fs/hd0-dos-2/ 
/dev/hd0t79 17575110 1280857 16294253 8% / 
/dev/hd0t14 96168 96168
/dev/hd0 78177793 78177793 0 100% 

Here you see a Win FAT 32 partition "/dev/hd0t12" - type 12, decimal, is
FAT 32 partition. "/dev/hd0t14" is the not yet mounted, unformatted FAT 16
partition which should store the AMIthlon boot files. If you are unsure,
you can look at the size of the partition. It is given in 512-byte blocks!
When you are still unsure, I suggest you check twice before proceeding.

Then you can use "mkdosfs /dev/hd0t14" (in our case) to format the
partition. Just be careful: It will *immediately* format the partition
without asking back. You should also be able to use "mkdosfs" on your
Debian Linux bootdisk. Or you can use Parted to format a FAT 16/32
partition (see "My PC harddisk is fully partitioned. How do I create free
space on it in order to install QNX/AmigaXL or AMIthlon?").

After formatting the partition just reboot QNX - well you could mount
manually, but QNX boots so fast, so why bother - in order to have your FAT
16/32 partition mounted. It will be mounted under "/fs/hd0-dos",
"/fs/hd0-dos2"... depending whether its the first, second, ... partition.

Open QNX "File Manager" and to into "/fs/hd0-dos" or whatever its called
on your system, create a new folder named "amithlon" and go into that
folder. Then insert the AmigaOS XL CD, open a second "File Manager", go
into "/fs/cd0/isolinux" select all files in there via SHIFT
multiselection, press "Copy", go into the "/fs/hd0-dos" file manager
window, select "Paste". Now you copied all the necessary AMIthlon files
into the "amithlon" directory on your FAT16/32 directory.

Now read on in "How can I use the GRUB bootloader to boot AMIthlon, QNX,
Linux and/or Windows?"

A good instruction on how to install AMIthlon on harddisk is also
available at:

http://www.amithlon.net/



Q: How do I use the QNX bootloader?

You may choose to install the QNX bootloader when you install QNX onto its
own partition. Just boot from the QNX CD in order to do that. Select to
install the QNX boot loader when being asked. The QNX boot loader is able
to boot QNX but also Windows and Linux (provided that you installed LILO
into the partition boot block of your Linux partition).

It is easy to handle: Press F1-F4 to select the harddisk you which to boot
from and press 1-9 to select the partition you which to boot from. If you
want to boot from the first harddisk you do not need to press F1 as it is
default.

You can not use the QNX boot loader to boot into AMIthlon directly as
long as you did not install LILO or GRUB to the AMIthlon boot partition.
We recommend to use GRUB when you want to boot AMIthlon. GRUB can also be
used to boot Windows and QNX (see "How can I use the GRUB bootloader to
boot AMIthlon, QNX, Linux and/or Windows?").


Q: How can I use the GRUB boot loader to boot AMIthlon, QNX, Linux and/or
Windows?

A: DISCLAIMER: Messing around with boot loader issues can make your
harddisks unbootable. Please make backups before doing so. Please install
a new boot loader when you really now what you do. We reject any
responsibility for damages that may occur on your system.

GRUB - the GRand Unified Bootloader - needs to access some files in order
to run. Its best you place them on a small - 50MB is enough - FAT16/32
partition. When you use Linux you can also use a ext2fs or reiserfs
partition.

When you want to boot AMIthlon install the AMIthlon emulation environment
files onto this small partition (see "I do not want to place the AmigaOS
XL CD into my CD-ROM drive whenever I want to boot AMIthlon, how can I
load AMIthlon directly from the harddisk?"). When you want to boot QNX,
install QNX onto some partition. When you want to boot Windows, install
Windows first - before installing GRUB - cause Windows installation might
just overwrite the Master Boot Record effectively disabling GRUB again
anyway.

You can find GRUB 0.90 in the "Contribution/AmigaOS XL/GRUB" directory of
your AmigaOS XL CD. First create a grub boot disk by writing the file
"grub-0.90-i386-pc.ext2fs" onto a floppy drive (see "How can I create all
the special boot disks I need?").

Then you need the GRUB files onto this small partition we already
mentioned. For this you need to depack the "grub-0.90-i386-pc.tar.gz"
archive from the "Contribution/AmigaOS XL/GRUB" directory. Open a shell
under QNX or Linux, go into that directory on the CD and type:

tar -xvzf grub-0.90-i386-pc.tar.gz

Then copy the boot directory from the dearchived "grub-0.90-i386-pc"
directory to your small boot partition in QNX under "/fs/hd0-dos" (or
"/fs/hd0-dos-2" and so on). It contains the "stage1", "*_stage1_5" and
"stage2" files that are needed in order to bootstrap GRUB. They have to
reside in the "boot/grub" directory of the small boot partition.

In order to get a boot menu instead of having to type you should create a
"menu.lst" file in the "boot/grub" directory on your boot partition. This
menu file usually starts with something as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Sample boot menu configuration file
#

# Boot automatically after 10 secs.
timeout 10

# By default, boot the first entry.
default 0

# Fallback to the second entry.
fallback 1

# Farbe
color yellow/red yellow/green
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then you can one of the following entries to allow booting different
operating systems. Note you will have to adapt the partition
specification:

(hd0,0) - (hd0,3) are the four primary partitions on the first harddisk
(hd0,4) - ... are extended partitions
(hd1,0) - (hd1,3) are the four primary partitions on the second harddisks
...

For booting AMIthlon:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For booting AMIthlon
title AMIthlon
root (hd0,3)
kernel /amithlon/emubox.gz console_level=0 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 vga=769 ramdisk_size=12010 leavepages=7400
initrd /amithlon/bigird.gz
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For booting AMIthlon without "amithlon_hd" RAM-Disk thus saving some
memory to the emulated Amiga:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For booting AMIthlon Small
title AMIthlon Small
root (hd0,3)
kernel /amithlon/emubox.gz console_level=0 init=/linuxrc root=/dev/ram0 vga=769 ramdisk_size=2310 leavepages=7400
initrd /amithlon/smallird.gz
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For booting QNX:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For booting QNX
title QNX
rootnoverify (hd0,1)
makeactive
chainloader +1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For booting Debian Linux with initial RAM disk (just as an example, refer
to your Linux distribution manual for further information):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For booting Linux
title Linux
root (hd0,4)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.13-k6 root=/dev/hda5
initrd /boot/initrd-2.4.13-k6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For booting Windows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For booting Windows
title Windows
rootnoverify (hd0,0)
makeactive
chainloader +1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find further information on GRUB under:

http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/


Q: How can I create all the special boot disks I need?

A:You can create the disk by formatting a new disk and then use
"rawrite2.exe" under Windows:

rawrite2 -f your-disk-image-file -d a

You find it in:

/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/dosutils/rawrite2.exe

Under QNX and Linux you can just use "dd" to write out the disk:

dd of=/dev/fd0 if=your-disk-image-file bs=1024

Make sure to use an already formatted disk, tough.



Q: All files from the AmigaOS XL CD are write protected even when I copy
or install them to the harddisk!

This is due to the way the AmigaOS XL CD is made. In order to make a PC
bootable CD so that you can boot AMIthlon from it we had to use a CD ISO
creator program that does not support Amiga protection bits. On Linux, QNX
and Windows all files on a CD are write-protected since a CD is
write-protected. Linux, QNX and Windows do unfortunately not differ
between a write-protected medium or a write-protected file.

For AmigaOS 3.9, StormC we provided work-arounds by packing these packages
into installation LhA archives that will be depacked on the emulated
Amiga. For ArtEffect and AmigaWriter we made a work-around in the
Installer script setting proper protection bits after installation.

For anything else that sits in the "Contribution" directory or elsewhere
you can work around the problem by copying the stuff you want to install
to harddisk first and then set proper protection bits. Just copy the stuff
you are interested in and then open a shell, go into the directory you
just copied onto the harddisk and type:

protect #? +rwed ALL



Q: I installed QNX and AmigaXL, but now when I try to set AHI options or
play sound files via AMPlifier the emulated Amiga tells me it can't find
"ahi.device"!

A: AHI 5.17 is automatically installed when booting AMIthlon and when
installing AmigaOS 3.9 from the AmigaOS XL CD (see "How can I install a
bootable AmigaOS 3.9 volume under AMIthlon?"). However it is not
completely installed on the AmigaOS 3.9 that gets installed via the
AmigaXL QNX package. You can install it from the AmigaOS XL CD. Just click
on the "Install_AHI" icon in the "Contribution/AmigaOS 3.9/AHI5" folder.



Q: I have more questions regarding AMIthlon!

A: You may find more answers in the AMIthlon FAQ by one of the developers
of AMIthlon, Bernie Meyer, at:

Hello Lasse,

again the "Mouse-Problem". :-(

Disable USB (both) and only use PS/2: Nothing.
Disable USB (both) and use PS/2 Keyboard and Serial-Mouse: Nothing.
Disable USB (both) and use PS/2 Keyboard and Serial-Mouse AND a serial
Mousedriver with powercom.device all Units: Nothing.

The Mousepointer will not work :-((. And i dont know why.

Under AMIGA OS XL/QNX the serial mouse works fine, but this is not the way I
want.

Do you have another idea? Or can you tell me, if the trouble causes in the
earlier boot sequence from Amithlon?

Thanks a lot for help.

Greetings from Germany.
Mario Schrder

PS.: The rest works fine AND VERY FAST!

Try to Disable both of these options, and go with the PS/2 mouse and PS/2
keyboard, the motherboard routing to PS/2 might screw things up?

Ok, here is a crazy idea :-)
Use the serial mouse and one for these drivers for serial mouse
http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminetbin/find?serial+mouse
remember to set the serial device to powercom.device. I have absolutly no
idea if this will work, but i suspect it will.

Ok, back to square one.
Does the mouse work, (yes sounds silly). but can you use the mouse to click
anything
what i mean is, is it only the mouse pointer that dont work, eg. does the
buttons work, if yes can you move around (without seeing the actual pointer
move) and click on eg. menu's or other stuff???

And second: what gfxcard do you use in the machine?

does the PS/2 mouse work under QNX?

As i expected :)

The nVidia driver supports Hardware cursor, which as far as i know can have
mixed results. You can disable it by setting the monitor tooltype
"Softsprite" to "Yes".

Hello Lasse,

i have tried your tip. But - no result - the mouse pointer stand in the left
upper corner and only with the keyboard is posible to change the position.

By the way: From with partition boots the amithlon after a softreset? From
my System-Partion on my HD or from the RAM-Disc from Amithlon? I hope from
my Partition cause I've done it all on this part.

Anyway - no mouse, no work with Amithlon :-(

Another idea?

Greeting from Germany
Mario Schrder

The nVidia driver supports Hardware cursor, which as far as i know can have
mixed results. You can disable it by setting the monitor tooltype

Ok, one last idea.
when you softreset, can you access the early boot menu? (pressing both
mouse buttons).
and again, does the mouse work there?

Hello Lasse - and the rest...

another question - for to fix the Mouse-Problem. I have startet the Amithlon
with the option "debug". There are many informations, but they are to fast
to read. Is there a posibility to print them or a logfile to read them after
boot?

Of course this show me a way to let the mouse moving....

Thanks a lot at this point for trying to help.

Yup -- I'm in exactly the same boat -- I also puchased mine from Software
Hut...Basically, what I'm learning is that any posted list, printed or
electronic, is wrong -- look at this group, for example. There were 400
posts the first week about PS/2 mice not working, yet if you ask them
(Amilithon/Amiga OSXL) support, why it isn't working, they say "Check your
com port." So here's what I found, and this, as far as I can tell overrides
anything I've seen on compatibility lists:

Processor: Any processor down to a Pentium-60 will work, however the speed
of the processor will impact speed of the OS/performance. The Macintosh,
running Virtual PC 4.0 or above, also works, as far as CPU goes.
Storage: Any standard IDE controller and Adaptec SCSI controllers work.
Removable disks work.
Floppy: Works, but be aware, that Amiga OS XL does not currently support
720K disks.
PS/2 keyboard: Works, but you will have to get a Windows 95 keyboard (with
additional 3-6 keys). Windows Me/98 Internet keyboards do not work properly.
PS/2 mouse: Doesn't work at all -- any brand...any type -- there simply is
no driver for the PS/2 mouseport.
Serial mouse: Most work, but who still makes serial mice? I tried to buy one
at Fry's last week. They had 50 brands of mice in stock -- only 1 was
available serial -- the Microsoft Intellimouse -- as it turned out, the box
was mismarked -- it was PS/2.
Graphics cards: Believe it or not, just about all work -- they key is
selecting the correct driver if your card isn't directly supported. They've
provided VESA drivers, which work in most cases (and on the Mac).
Network cards: It's my belief that just about all cards work, however, they
provide no information on how to get them to work (like how to bind the
network driver and stop/restart services). I haven't gotten any to work yet,
but I'm still playing with it.
Sound cards: Check their lists BEFORE you buy -- their lists include circa
year-2000 sound cards (nothing newer...nothing older)...

That is not completly true, i use PS/2 mice under both AMIthlon and QNX, so
PS/2 mice is supported.
why on earth some people are having trouble with PS/2 mouse, is very wierd.
I have myself testet AMIthlon on several different types of mainboards, and
never had any trouble getting the PS/2 mouse to work.

Having just tried amithlon for the first time, it detected and used my
PS2 mouse on my desktop PC fine (it didn't even get to the boing ball
stage when I tried it on my laptop, but that's another matter entirely!)

Hello. I have tried four computers with different (inexpensive) cards and
none work.
I`m assuming there is more than the bouncing ball as per the docs.

Looking locally, I see :-

A) Nvidia tnt2 m64 32MB AGP by Jaton
B) geforce 2 mx 200 64MB AGP by Cardex

Has anyone used these cards with amithlon yet ?

Also, what IS supposed to happen after the bouncing ball ?

After the Boing ball, it is supposed to do a 68040 reset and p96 reset. and
boot into AmigaOS right after that.
what other hardware do you have in that machine?
and have you tried pressing capslock when the first boot logo apears and
type Debug?, what error msg does it show?

I have Amithlon running fine on a ASUS A7V133 motherboard with 1.4GHz
Athlon. It really is super fast...

But I have a few issues:

-The floppy drive doesn't work. I have formatted a 720K PC disk and put it
in the floppy drive, mounted PC0: and PC1: and went to a shell and typed
diskchange pc0: but nothing happens. The floppy drive is not even accessed,
nor does any icon for the PC0: device show up on the workbench. Any ideas?

-My Soundblaster 128 works fine with AHI and I tried playing a few MP3's
with it - no problem. However the sound quality is no where near what it is
under Windows. I am using a 16-bit stereo AHI mode. Is there anything else
I can do to get good quality sound?

-HDToolbox recognizes the fact that I have two 20 gig hard disks attached to
my Promise Raid controller, but shows them as separate disks, even though
they are formatted in one big 40 gig drive array. It doesn't seem to see
the partitioning of these existing drives. No problem really, as I have an
old 500 meg drive and formatted it for Amiga OS.

-The speed of this emulator is incredible!! I tried Mand 2000 and it is
super fast...I also ran sysspeed and again it is really fast!! Thanks to the
Amithlon team!!

-I threw in a DLINK 530 PCI network card that I thought was NE2000
compatible but the powerne2k device driver doesn't seem to like it :) So, I
am getting a realtek 8029 based card. But I am finding that these cards are
difficult to find. I have had to get a used one. I can't find any store
that sells the 8029 based card...But I did manage to secure 2 cards. I will
have a spare one just in case :)

-Is there any utility to scan the pci bus to show the available pci cards? I
think the GREX has a utility like this?

-My GeForce 256 graphics card works fine and looks gorgeous on my 18.1" Flat
panel monitor. It is very fast, although I have noticed the the background
re-draw of backdrops is a bit slow. (1280x1024x16-bit).

-When formatting my 500 meg hard disk Amithlon crashed. A quick format
worked fine, however.

Again thanks to the Amithlon team for a great product! I think Amithlon has
ALOT of potential!!

well really, its a link to the config, where you should setup the mp3 player
to use best quality.

in the amithlon dir on the ram image there is a program called pciscan (or

As far as I remember, most of the Promise Raid stuff is actually done in
the windows drivers, not actual hardware, which would explain why it's
seeing it as two drives.

One of the Four machines does change to a screen with a logo and then

also with a permanent

Is this a successfull test ?

I am still interested in getting a better (read faster) compliant graphics

I think I need to get a soundblaster 128 compatable card as well.

Any suggestions from people that have Amithlon working.

I have a PS/2 mouse working OK here under Amithlon. It also works OK
under the original QNX RtP CD release - I haven't tried Amiga XL yet.

Are you using the "PC0" from the amithlon_hd? AFAIK, the one in the OS3.9
install is not set up for Amithlon yet.
Just copy over the one from amithlon_hd:storage/Dosdrivers, and it should
work.

You should use the "SB 128: 16 bit stereo++" mode, and make sure you have it
set to 44,100Hz.
Also, please double-check the settings of your MP3 player --- they often come
with options to decode in lower quality or at lower sample rate to save CPU
time.

This would appear to be _software_ RAID, so the hardware knows absolutely
nothing about them really being one big disk; That is handled by some
sort of low-level DOS or Windows driver.
As Amithlon doesn't know about it, and the hardware doesn't know about
it.... 

>-Is there any utility to scan the pci bus to show the available pci cards? I

Yep, it's called "pciscan", and lives (with other Amithlon-specific stuff)
in c:AmithlonC/

Now, you will find that the output is not exactly, uhm, full of useful
names just yet. Oops! Have a look at "amithlon_hd:s", there is a file called
"pci_vendors.txt". That file should be called "vendors.txt", and needs to be
either in your current directory, or in S:
After you copy it over to S: and rename it, you should get a full and useful
list out of pciscan.

No, this is a pretty badly failed test :((

I have one machine that does this, for no apparent reason. And of course,
as soon as I start trying to debug things, by putting in some sort of 
output, or logging, or something, it stops doing it. *sigh*

Could you have a look at the right hand side of the screen, and mail me how
far it got with printing the info?

My current theory, based on my machine, is that I might have a slightly
broken partition table, because it appears that it crashes while doing the
scan for partitions. But of course (Murphy!), that machine is also Dual-CPU,
and has many other oddities which could be causing it....

Best ones, by far, are GeForce2 cards. The reason being, of course,
that I have a GeForce2 (and a TNT2), and thus can actually really test
stuff with it.

Next best are the older Matrox cards (i.e. *NOT* the G550!); Those are
also supported in all resolutions/bit depths, and with most hardware
accelleration. I have a Millennium card --- Millennium classic, that is,
before "Millennium" stopped being a card and started being a product line.
So I can do *some* testing there.

Then there is a bunch of cards that should be supported at various bit
depths, but without any hardware accelleration, and which at least I can't
test at all, due to not having them.
ATI cards are in that group, and from all I hear, they only work somewhat.
So stay away from them.

Bernie

I was wondering if it was possible for Bernie or whomever
to make a new test disk image with the following functions...

The Video card test modes works fine by pressing the space bar,
but how about including a "beep" noise of a short tune to play,
to tell if your sound card is being recognised. ?

Also, is it possible to enable the mouse to be moved around
the test screen to see if it will work with the real thing.....

Maybe a box to type some keyboard input into as well
to see if it sees your keyboard...?

Comments please.....

The problem is that the sound drivers are AmigaOS native, i.e. 68k.
The test image has no 68k emulation, and no AmigaOS support. So that's
a no-go.
What might be possible would be to at least look for the PCI signature
of the supported hardware, and output a message if anything supported was
found.

That should be fairly easy. To be honest, I am utterly stumped by the number
of people who have trouble with PS/2 mice on Amithlon. *Nothing* like that
ever came up during testing, neither on any of my numerous machines, nor
on any of the beta testers machines.

>to see if it sees your keyboard...?

Of course, after just writing the previous paragraph, this is going to sound
hollow, but: There will be no problems with keyboards (other than lack of
nationalized keymaps). Keyboard hardware in PCs has not changed, from a 
software point of view, since 1984.

As long as something happens when you press keys...
Maybe flash the screen, show the rawkey numbers, whatever.

I think it would be a better way for people to test compatibility.

You may not have the proper PC0 device especially if you installed OS3.9
onto a drive and are booting from it. You can simply try copying the
PC0.device (storage:dosdrivers if you haven't moved it) from the Amithlon
virtual drive (HDH0) to your sys:storage/dosdrivers or sys:devs/dosdrivers.
If you open your file PC0.device in an editor the line /device=/ should be
/floppy.device/ not /mfm.device/. At least this worked for me after a
little frustrating poking around.
ps2 mouse works fine here.

Add this to your list, the ATI Rage Mobility 1 laptop gfx card works only
in vesa mode (ie not even a boing ball on standard boot), and only at
640x480x8

Hope that helps :)

Just a shame the PCI64 soundblaster card isn't supported as well :)

I'm guessing you're trying to copy the boot image onto the disk as a
file, try writing it as an image using the tools provided on the
same web page you got that from.

Thank you, its always nice to have a more complete list.
Is there anyone else who have testet Amithlon to work on a gfxcards which is

Amithlon works in all modes and depths on the ATI Rage 128 Pro chipset, 
however, it is buggy in that 16/32 bit depth screens do not go away when 
the screen is 'closed' and screen flipping does not work. When the 
workbench is at 32bit but all other screens are at 8bit, this 
works. Screens do go away when closed. However 8bit screens are offset by 
10-20 pixels to the left. Also, the color palettes don't always display 
correctly. Just opening an 8 bit screen will screw the palette on the 
32bit Workbench.

Thought this could be of help to somebody else who has problems
with the mouse on AMITHLON.
I've tried various configurations of USB/normal/serial Keyboard/mouse
mix.... and in noway it was possible to make the mouse work...
but reading carefully I noticed that Amithlon does not support
the serial mouse! and that was all.

So I connected a PS2 mouse (borrowe from my brother) and it works
perfectly!!! (guess I'll have to buy a PS2 mouse, but before
doing it I will investigate on the option to installe the=20
serial mouse under AmigaOS, that was very difficult even to try
when I had no mouse to work around... ;-) )

Another thing: on my system work perfectly
-LOGITECH USB cordless keyboard (enabling the usb keyboard support=20
in the PC BIOS)
-LOGITECH USB/PS2 normal mouse (obviously using the USBtoPS2 adapter
provided with it).

I'll do some other tests with other Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard
sets I can have access too...
unfortunately my LOGITECH cordless desktop doesn't work=20
completely (i.e. the keyboard works, but not the mouse)...
I suspect because it connects by a single usb port...
but there are other versions where the radio receiver is
connected to the pc by two adapters, one for the keyboard
and one for the mouse (both can be adapted to connect to=20
USB or PS2 ports), and I'm quite sure that kind of combo
will work well with amithlon.

The Matrox G550 as far as I tried until now works, but only
in 640x480 8bit :-((
Strange as I've read the Matrox documentation and it's stated
that the card support Vesa2.0, so I shoud be able to chose
an higher resolution.
I tried to modify the amithlon file with the new kernel
option for the VGA parameter, but that doesn't seem
to work...
Anyway will make more tests, I've had few time to work on it.

I tried to create an LS120 disk that would boot to Amitholon. I
followed the FAQ instructions to create a linux boot_floppy and I used
its fdisk to partition the LS120 and copy the four Amitholon files into
its 10M FAT32 partition and made the partition bootable. When I tried
to boot from it seemed to be working for a second (i.e. it read from
the LS120) but then it stopped showing:

"Verify DMI Pool Data"

and just hung there. Any suggestions.

from the CD, and the other is on the same PC running FreeBSD. Hope
these prove interesting :)

A 68k running at around a third to a fifth the speed of a PIII isn't too
shabby :)

What speed PIII is it?

I have a KT7-RAID motherboard (on-board Highpoint RAID controller). 
There are twin hard drives on the RAID, plus CDR and DVD drives on 
the standard IDE controller.

There are two Windows partitions on the RAID, and I used Partition 
Magic to shrink the latter to give me some free space at the end. I 
tried to use the boot_fdisk from the support site, but it didn't 
recognize the empty space. It reported a partition #5 with bogus 
sector number entries.

I returned to Partition Magic, and created two unformatted partitions 
in the unused space. Fdisk now saw those partitions as empty, and I 
used 'T' to change the type of the first one to $76. I left the 
second one unformatted in case QNX ever supports the Highpoint 
controller. Fdisk still reported a bogus partition #5 even though 
there was no longer any unallocated space.

Booting Amithlon, I did not get a partition named "VirtDsk". Here's 
what I see in HDToolbox. <abbreviated>

0 0 CDR
2 0 DVD
4 0 IBM hard drive 28.6G
4 1 <blank name> <size unknown>
6 0 IBM hard drive 28.6G
0 0 AmithlonDiskImage

It appears to be recognizing the RAID drives as two separate units.
The blank entry would seem to be the $76 drive. (When I changed both 
extra partitions to $76, I had two blank entries). But I suspect 
these are not usable as such.

Any chance of getting a workable RDB partition on this setup? (I 
already found that I can't run QNX, and thus, Amiga OS/XL).

Thanks,
- John

Hi,

Bernie, please could you explain us how Amithlon "sees" a modem? Does
it look for a serial device (/dev/ttySx)? If yes, so is it possible to
recompile the kernel (after patch it since I think it has no ISA
support anymore) used by Amithlon to detect an ISA modem (a real one,
not those winmodems...)?

Thank you!

Marcos.

Update:

After successfully creating a virtual drive on another machine, I 
found some of what I did wrong, but am still unable to get it working.

In my previous report, I had created the extra partitions as Primary 
rather than Logical partions, which is probably why they didn't work 
correctly with HDToolbox. However, when creating them as Logical 
partitions, they don't show up under fdisk at all, due to being after 
the #5 partition that it can't process correctly.

I found out that partition 5 should have been the Windows D drive in 
the extended DOS partition. But it isn't been reported correctly, 
nor can fdisk process any of the space after this partition. Could 
there be a problem with this partition's size, which is 49 Gig? I 
can't think of what else could be wrong. Partition Magic correctly 
shows the new partitions, but the linux fdisk can't find them. 
Here's what it shows:

start end blocks
hde1 1 382 3068383+
hde2 383 7474 56966490
hde5 264950 262069 2124348941+

Note that the numbers for hde5 are not only out of range, but show 
the start higher than the end.

Any ideas appreciated.

I'm going to try and move the D partition up, so the extra space is 
in front of it. Hopefully that will work.

Thanks,
- John

on my AMD Athlon 1400MHz I am getting 1940 KKeys/sec with the 68k dnet clie=
nt! I checked the amiga benchmarks page and a 604e 200Mhz amiga would get 7=
45 KKeys/sec.

a small tip for Amithlon users:

If you have alot of ram, edit your startup sequence and uncomment the line =
with the JIT cache size..set it to 65536 to get a speed boost :)

You can't use any ISA devices with Amithlon, period. It doesn't matter if
you recompile ISA support into the kernel, because most resources are
controlled from the Amiga side, and there is no ISA support there.

Put simply, the only modems compatible with Amithlon at this stage are
external ones.

Hello,

I bought this weekend a Athlon XP 1700+ moterboard and 256 
MB dimm. and builden in a tower with a 10 GB hd and cd rom.
Amiga Only!
I found out that the long boot (6 min) which I had was because of 
the SCSI card, a Adaptec 2930.
When he finally boots I seen nothing as device in the HDToolbox 
(which first crashes several times) Only amithlon.device and 
amithlonsecond.device, which 1 the primari and the secondari 
IDE interface(?)
But also get everything what is in ram. (ramdisk)

Is there a change that a Adaptec 2930 which be supported?

Bye,

Sjoerd

In preferences under /modules/preview/ make sure you use /windowed CGX/.
This is the setting necessary for ImageFX to use a graphics card (even when
using picasso96 on a real amiga).

another question - for to fix the Mouse-Problem. I have startet the Amithlon
with the option "debug". There are many informations, but they are to fast
to read. Is there a posibility to print them or a logfile to read them after
boot?

Of course this show me a way to let the mouse moving....

Thanks a lot at this point for trying to help.

There is a program in the testprogs.lha archive (located in the Amithlon dir
on the Ram image), the program is called xcat. and should be able to
retrieve the log files from the linux kernel boot.
But i dont know the exact file its supposed to get, so could bernie please
step in here :-)

might be 'xcat /dev/proc/kmsg >Filename.txt'

Hi !

A very interesting problem, Amithlon doesn't boot on my computer setup
which is :

Asus A7V133 Raid, 1.2Ghz AMD ThunderBird, 512Mb RAM,
ATi Radeon 64Mb DDR, Philips Acoustic Edge,
MS Intellimouse Explorer v1 (optical USB), MS Natural Keyboard Pro,
Terratec TValue -tv card, Asuscom 128k ISDN PCI adapter,
Compaq 10/100Mb NIC

On boot-up from CD, the ball just keeps bouncing forever.
With debug on, it scans the first two PCI devices, then states
DOESN'T FIND PCI DEVICE 3 .. or
COULDN'T FIND PCI DEVICE 3
I hope I remember it correctly..

what's the matter ? I've removed all my "extra" PCI -adapters
and it didn't help...

Take care,
- Tony Cavn (www.ferrara.c64.org)

Hi Bill,

Thanks for your explanation.

So, could you tell me how Amithlon access a serial device? Does it
bypass Linux or use /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1? Will I be able to use any
external serial device (already supported by AmigaOS, of course) like
a Palm Pilot?

Best regards!

Marcos.

Amithlon uses a device driver as normal, only in this case it is called
"powercom.device", and you should find it in the DEVS:. If it's not there
copy it from the amithlon_hd:devs directory.

IIRC, you can then choose a unit number to select the required serial port,
depending on the utility or program you are using. (TCP/IP stack, Terminal
program, printer driver etc.)

I think we have allready had a similar problem, try in your bios to 'Load
Default Setup' under the last menu item, (where you save settings and exit).
If that dont help, Disable Onboard Modem (the AMR slot) if you are not
using it, as its proberly set to auto on your bios.

Yep, sure have. My "ELSA Gladiac 920" (Geforce 3, 64 MB DDR) works in
640x480x8 (only that mode).

Hi.

I'm just wondering if there's a Geforce 3 driver planned for Amithlon.

It seems as (what I've read in this forum) quite a few ppl have these GPU's=
, and it would be truly wonderful to have a driver that supported these car=
ds (as I am soon buying myself my 3:rd high-performance computer that will =
be the computer I will use Amithlon on instead of the one I use now).

Ah. BTW, does Amithlon support dual processors, or will it do that in the f=
uture?

R.

It would be 

xcat /proc/kmsg >filename.txt

and you would need to be in the same directory as the executable (so it
can find the xcat.elf part of itself).

However, the kernel doesn't even get to touch keyboard or mouse hardware,
so I doubt there'd be any useful information there.

What might produce some enlightening output could be to run

ps2test

and wiggle the mouse around. Of course, running it without first having 
a mouse working is really tedious (using the cursor-key mouse emulation;
Yuck!), but I don't know what else to do. Never ever had any trouble with
any PS/2 mice on any machine....

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I suspect that's what's causing problems. ATI support is something I am
definitely *not* happy with --- I can't test it, from reports, there are
all sorts of weird and niggly problems, and things are just plain yuck!

Could you try booting with "vesa" rather than "debug"? That would disable
ATI support in the distributed kernel, and force Amithlon to use the
maximum compatibility mode where it just uses the card's own BIOS (and
is thus extremely limited in what it can do, but.... it should come up
at least).

>With debug on, it scans the first two PCI devices, then states
>DOESN'T FIND PCI DEVICE 3 .. or

>I hope I remember it correctly..

Could you find out the precise wording? And possibly include a few lines 
before this error message? Right now, I don't know where it is coming from,
and thus can't really look at what it means and what might be causing
it. Precise text would allow me to search for it in the kernel sources.

Nope, it hits the hardware directly.

If your internal modem is a "real" one, i.e. has an actual serial port
with an actual UART somewhere, you might be able to fudge something.
Please contact harald@a..., as he is the author of the powercom.device,
and would know best how to configure it for specific hardware addresses.

As soon as someone adds GeForce3 framebuffer support to the linux kernel,
we will support it for Amithlon. Each time a new kernel gets released, 
that's the first thing I am looking for (and I don't even have one of those
cards :), but alas, not so far.

>Ah. BTW, does Amithlon support dual processors, or will it do that in the

It doesn't support it now. More importantly, I really can't see what
useful things the second CPU *could* do. Emulating one 68k is not something
that can reasonably be split amongst two CPUs. Emulating two 68k CPUs would
be another matter, of course, but for that, we'd first need an SMP aware
version of AmigaOS.

So seeing as enabling that second CPU would not really be useful, and would
introduce all sorts of concurrency and reentrancy nightmares, I doubt 
we will switch to an SMP aware kernel anytime soon.

I booted off the test disk, got a screen called 
"LILO Boot Menu". It shows NORMAL, DEBUG, VESA.

It says "loading normal" or something at the bottom.
After a few seconds I get a black/blank screen, and 2 led's 
on my keyboard start flashing.

What did I do wrong ???

Hi, you might try runing the debug. Hit the down arrow when the boot menu 
comes up. In debug messages will display that might give some indication as 
to what went wrong.

Nothing. The two flashing LEDs signify a kernel panic, i.e. something
didn't work properly on your hardware.

Here is what you can do to find out what: When the lilo screen comes
up, use the cursor down key to highlight "debug" (you got a few
seconds between the time the screen comes up and the time the default,
"normal", gets loaded), then press return. Hopefully, there will be
some output, and the last few lines before the panic should give a
hint what's at fault.

You could also try the "vesa" option, which might do the trick if it's a
gfx card related problem.

My hope is counting on that to, I haven't got a floppy up running 
yet. PC0: in devs/dosdrivers doesn't help.
It is just for transferring some smal programs, now evetry time I

Just as an experiment, I tried this on my ATI AIW128 Pro. It doesn't work 
at all. All I got was graphic garbage on the screen and no workbench. It 
took a bit, but I finally got the Caps-Lock key hit and used a different 
boot command.

BTW, its: video=vesa

This isn't on the website, either. I did find it in the config file, though.

I have many problems with Amiga Standard screen. For example if try to
use amiga 640 x 512 screen a 640 x 256 screen is showed with the icon
cutted and the mouse is having many many problem. I Clik here and the
mouse clik 3 cm under that point.
With the mouse set up to highres the emulator crashes.
With ForceMonitor to relocate monitor on other resolution (not all
program have the screen-config) the emulator crashes.
I have a Ge-Force 2 MX (why is not possible to use 1600x1200 and
1920x1440 and 2048x1536 Screen? (I use amiga on Brilliance 201P).
The monitor Configuration is impossible to configure i tried to
reconfigure with Picasso96 config but it shows modes at 90Hz and when
i change the resolution with screenmode the Screen remain always to
60ShitHertz.

My Config is:

Gigabyte DualBios DDR MAinboard
Athlon 1400 266
MSI Ge-Force 2 MX 200

I'm remaining in contact

I had that problem at first, then I realised all I had to do is to hold
caps lock down.

I just type vesa and press return, works for me :)

I just realized, you type 'vesa' at the boot prompt, but must add 
'video=vesa' to the config file, which is what I did.

Hi sdevries et al,

Could you explain in a bit more detail about displaying driver Picasso. I
do use windowed CGX but still cannot get IFX4 to open and am also
experiencing the 640x480 preview persistence. I have also tried moving the
default.prefs file to a storage location and reconfiguring IFX4 from startup
with the same results.

Well, as an example, one processor could emulate a 68k and the other one a
PPC? ;)

About some kind of PPC-emulation, is there any plans whatsoever of making a
PPC-emulation for Amithlon/AmigaXL?
Since the 68k emulation is fast and so on, wouldn't a PPC-emulation also be
possible to do (or is it too complex and would use too much CPU-power in
todays x86 computers)?
