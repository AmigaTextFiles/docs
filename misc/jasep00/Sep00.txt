Greetings € ¦Âll...

Just curious. Does anyone know what the "Text DType" is used for?

I've been religiously up-dating it from Aminet and have yet to find
an explanation of what it actually does, or, for that matter, what
actually uses it.  TIA.

Hi all

/me shrugs

Text conversion maybe? I dunno why it would be needed for anything else.

Hello Mark

Well :) what do you think a _*TEXTDATATYPE*_ should do ?
It shows you text and the new Version is superior to
the original because you can mark/search text etc ...

The datatype system is modular so you need for every type
a modul ... And for text it's text dt ... View a text in
multiview and doubleclick a word or triple for the line
or drag for more ... The dt is really cool and still in 
development . The author is really responsive to questions
and bugreports ... Send him a mail just to say you use his 
software :)

Hi all

FFS! All I was saying is that you dont need a datatype to display text. All
that stuff about selecting searching for text can be done byt the program in
particular.

The point I was making is that _maybe_ (thats right _maybe_, cos i have
never used this datatype) it could be used for conversion (eg, it stores
information on the different text formats)

Maybe I read the context of your mail wrong but it seemed very patronising
and like it was taking the piss out of me. If this wasnt intended then I
apologise :-/

Thanks for the explanation anyway :-)

Thanks for the hints, I'll try them. BTW... I did mail him, twice,
about 3 re-placements ago. No answer. I shall try once more.

As an experiment I renamed it, re-booted, and tried Amigaguide and
Multiview (the only things I could think of that might be affected)
and there didn't seem to be any difference. Of course I didn't know
about the use outlined above when I did this. I'm still wondering
about the practical use of this hi-lighting of text in MV, there
is a menu item for doing just this, so, enlighten me.

Regards... Tony

I counted one IIRC :-) Thanks for the backup anyway. Like you said, there
are no docs for it so I didnt know. I aint used my Amiga in 2 months (dont
worry, im on linux not win32 :-) so Ive not heard of half the new things
that are going on for it. I was mearly making a suggestion about what it
could be. Unfortunately some people misunderstood :-)

Yes.  Classic Amiga Software support, and well as legacy file system
support.  Are my multitude of Amiga disk with both programing and data
destined to be worthless on the AmigaNG system?

One of the hallmarks of the Amiga system is the ease at which it adopts
other files systems.  Will that remain.

Will I have the ability to use my current large collection of software I am
familiar with as I adapt and learn new software as it become available?
Having to replace my entire suite of software will certainly slow me down in
acquiring a new AmigaNG.  After all, I have been using the software I have,
and happily for years.  I am willing to accept better, but not all at once.
That would be a lot of learning curve.

Well in that case, would you like to field these questions?  They're still
rather good questions.  Via this Mailing List or in an interview if you
wish :)

Love to but all this Tao/Elate/Linux/Redhat shit is way above my head. I find
my way round wb3.1 well enough, tinker with amod pro but anything deeper and

No, your old software won't be worthless. Your Amiga will not suddenly stop
booting and some form of emulation layer will be available.

The new Amiga is hardware independent and doesn't care what it is hosted on
or it can run stand alone.

Again, your Amiga will not suddenly stop working. And we will provide some
form of emulation.

3.5 is it.  I installed it at the beginning of the year and never regreted the
money spent.  It is just that much more Amiga.

I don't think there will be many people who have much to say 
or ask of  the Tao group at all, other than:  
        "Thanks for the Ami kernal".

However, I can guarantee that most people here are waiting
to hear from Amiga  instead, in detail,  with regard to how their 
existing 68K software base will be handled on the Ami...   
  # (I know Gary..........   Some sort of emulation ? ) # 
eg:    Hardware 68K (a pci card with 68K like coprocessor),  
         Software interpreter / emulation,  
         Magic / Voodoo. ??

The second one:    
Is the  (New)Amiga Machine going to be a shitty old x86 something,  
or are we going get an arse-kicking IBM G3-500 or something
equally arousing...   With extra plug-in  "goodies"   that 
x86 boxes don't have,  like having the OS kernal in flash rom on a
card,  so it is not completely disk based & brain dead if the harddrive 
goes bye-bye's....

The third one:
If  x86 is what will be used in the Ami,  (sigh) 
and if I wanted to get a new x86 box to play with now,
is there any reason to wait for the next 3-6 months so see what
hardware specs the new Ami will prefer,  as my income is
rather low & I can't afford to spend a grand on something that
will be substandard for what I eventually want to do with it...
Is there any advantage in waiting to see what hardware is 
recomended for the Ami,  will Amiga give preferences to,
or advantages for, people who buy an "Ami"  from the Amiga dealers
as a finished box,   or can I put one together myself, from parts... ?? 

And of course:
When is it expected that the Amiga OS be able to run without hosting
as I havn't a clue how to even turn on a machine with linux on it.... 

Not to forget:
Will you have a Workbench that will be recognised by Amigans,  
so that we won't run away screaming at first sight..
 
Finally:
Will the directory structure of the Ami be recognisable by us,
or will it be a linux-like mess  ?
Is there going to be notable similarities to our existing systems.. 


I think that just about does it ....?

Regards

Hi Gary,

> No, your old software won't be worthless. Your Amiga will not suddenly stop
> booting

Mine did. During "mid-boot". But this might have to do something with
the fact that one of my dear kids pulled the power plug while it was
booting. Thanks to a good file-system, nothing was invalided though,
and after a good spanking of the poor kid (still legal in Germany), my
Amiga boots as normal.

Seriously though. We've had the same discussion when the AGA machines
came out. People crying out, because their software all of a sudden
refused to work (well, a small portion of it). I agree that I do not
want to, nor do I have the money to, replace all the software I bought
over the past few ages. But Gary, since you're listening here, don't
let that stop Amiga from building something new. I (and I think some
others as well) want the new Amiga Desktop Computer to be something
better than a 10 year old product. If you can make it such that a lot
of the old programs (old? running PageStream4r8 here, which isn't even
out yet :)), will still work, great. If some software I can't do
without refuses to work on the new Amiga, I'll just keep my (t)rusty
ole A1200 around in case I need to use the old software, and buy the
new Amiga just the same, software will follow as money (and my wife)
allows.

I might be talking to the wrong group of people here, if I am, feel
free to flame me, but I want any new computer to be better than what
we have right now, and if that means some software will not work on
it, so be it!

> and some form of emulation layer will be available.

Meaning probably some programs (who do things not quite legally) will
refuse to work? Tough luck. Those will have to be the first I replace
with other offerings. At least, when (notice I say when, not if) this
new Amiga takes off, there will be developers writing this new
software, which would be a great difference with the "classic" Amiga
market. One day soon I will actually be able to go to a shop and buy
software that will run on an Amiga that is known as the world as a
state of the art computer.

Hi Gary

That's great :-)

I'll be able to run Ami on the VAXstation that's currently in my attic.

And the Siemens box that runs Sinix on an National Semiconductor chip set.

And the Sun SPARCstation, and the Sun Ultra. And my PC laptop that Linux
won't run on (incompatible graphics chipset).

And of course my 060 based A3000!

I expect that was a bit "tounge in cheek" ??
As I understand it, the 68K series has been explicitly
mentioned as *not* being supported by the new OS.

I think Motorola wants to discontinue them & move to PPC
instead, so Amiga has some sort of affiliation with them
so they have to go along with their business strategy...  ??

No one is more disappointed than me, I paid $4200 (AUD) 
for my A4000T plus another $1500 bucks for the Cyberstorm 060.
At the time I decided to (afforded to) go only with an 060 card as
the PPC side of things was dead & H&P / Phase5 fiasco was
in full bloom,  so I bought just the 68060/50 & shoved 128 meg
of ram in it just for the hell of it...  
It was only $43 (AUD) / 32 meg simm at the time, it's now
back up to over $100 again,  that was well timed.... 

I reasoned that the 68K's would always be able to run the
Amiga stuff & any new machines would have to have one
too, or at least a similar chip  68080 ???  /  PPC
that would be arranged to run the legacy stuff seamlessly..
Bummer ehh....  (:/

Now the sh%$t has hit the fan, I am still wondering if I should
persist with my machine or just bite the bullet & wait until
Amiga comes out (or hware affiliates)  with the Ami & go in 
that direction,  whatever it may be,  I strongly suspect a PPC
chip of some kind,  maybe an IBM ATX PPC board for a
mini tower or such like, but I am just guessing here....

My beloved A4000T is not going to cut it in the future
as all the pee-see hardware out there is for things like
AGP & PCI,  neither of which we have. (yet)
Either way, special hardware is what is / has killed the 
Classic Amiga, simply because it is wearing concrete 
boots & can't move with the times. 
 
As a coder, I am dying to try out the new SDK,  
but as the only pee-see I have here is a crappy old
P200 with 32Mb ram that I use to program logic chips
& draw printed circuit boards that I use in my business,
I can't justify (afford to) spending heaps on another x86
box until I know what Amiga is offering (direction)

The second hurdle for me is the learning curve,
I have been an Amiga coder since 1986 in 'C' & 'ASM'
and barely can manage to use W95, as it is.
I find a hideous dose of uncorrelated, illogical & unco-ordinated
mess of directories with mystery files in it that only M$
knows what they're for...
It  "feels"  awfull & foreign to use it & things disappear all
by themselves & the harddrive starts thrashing  with no
interaction by me, in short, it scares the living sh#t out of me....

Now linux,  everyone (pc users) I have spoken to says they 
spent days trying to install red-hat on their machine &
eventually had to give up,  at least W95 went straight on
& worked (sort of)  first go,  so as a virgin to pc's 
I feel even less likely to be able to get it going.
The W95 on the pc is flakey to say the least, I dare not
even think of trying to put another OS on it as every time
I do anything to it, something breaks.
 
What I have seen on the open-amiga list  is so 
foriegn to me that I feel osterosized by the linux-speak
which is mostly incomprehensible even to me,
I was hoping to sit & learn what is happening & get the
"feel" of it before Amiga released the "Ami"  machine,
then I would be fore-armed with some basic knowledge
so that when I eventually bought an "Ami"  I would be a
little bit "at home",  but instead, it has turned out to be a 
linux coders paradise...
AND,  what the hell is an  "ncurses"   anyway...? 

What I need, is a more "Amiga"  centered list for the SDK
may I suggest:    sdkvirgin@amiga.com   (:>

My close circle of coder friends feel much the same way
& feel sort-of  lost & left out,  we understand the great advantage
of having portable executables & modern hardware & stuff,
but none of us feel we are able to participate at the current level.

Just some basic questions need answering that we would feel
"stupid"  asking on the list, but the tallent there is so far removed
from our experiences that we just can't do it in that forum..
Here is not too-bad, as only Amigans (I presume) are here
& there is no pressure to not ask "dumb" questions....

Incase this email actually get read by someone who can supply
some basic info on the SDK, there are a few questions we would 
like to know.......

1:  I believe there is no "Workbench" as we know it yet,
     however, there is a shell environment of some sort... 
     Is it an Amiga shell or a Linux shell used to launch programs from ?

2:  Is there any sort of desktop or "Workbench" type interface yet,
     even a primative one. ?

3:  I believe there is no "Intuition" or "Graphics" libraries yet,
     but people are porting programs with GUI's.
     How do you run a program with a GUI if no gui libs exist yet. ?
     

These are just some "dumb"  questions that seem to have elluded 
being answered by lurking on the open list.... 

Anyhow, as this email is getting too big now, i'm leaving the
rest for later....


Regards

Good on you Col. As an owner of a lowly A1200 with GVPA1230 (serI)
accel., and only 6megs (and not much chance of ever being able to
get more of their bloody proprietry ram) I think these are very 
important Q's.

As you know, we have very strong (grin) discrimination laws here.
Why limit this list to *"virgins"* - won't that automatically rule
the vast *majority* of us out??  8-)

Yes it was tounge in cheek - but the intention was to point out
that Gary's statement:

  "The new Amiga is hardware independent and doesn't care what it is
   hosted on or it can run stand alone."

is being rather generous with the truth.

The truth is that it is limited to the platforms for which Ami is
explicitly released. In exactly the same way as Linux is - except
with Linux you can always port it to a new platform yourself if
necessary.

Ami will never run on any of the platforms I mentioned above. It
does care what it is hosted on, and it will never run stand alone
on any of those platforms.

Slap another 32megs in that and get the gforce gfx card (single header
is all you need) and it will be pleanty to work with.  The SDK does not
have to run on Win95, and if you run it native or on linux, it should
work fine, even on a 200mhz computer.  All is not lost, really.

Hi,

 On Thursday September 07 2000, Colin Wenzel said to All:

 CW> I expect that was a bit "tounge in cheek" ?? As I understand it, the
 CW> 68K series has been explicitly mentioned as *not* being supported by
 CW> the new OS.
 CW> I think Motorola wants to discontinue them & move to PPC instead, so
 CW> Amiga has some sort of affiliation with them so they have to go along
 CW> with their business strategy...  ??

68k is effectively discontinued, but the technology is still progressing in
the form of the ColdFire chips.

 CW> The second hurdle for me is the learning curve, I have been an Amiga
 CW> coder since 1986 in 'C' & 'ASM' and barely can manage to use W95, as it
 CW> is. I find a hideous dose of uncorrelated, illogical & unco-ordinated
 CW> mess of directories with mystery files in it that only M$ knows what

Ho, you'll just /love/ Un*x then.  Linux has inherited all this from Un*x, as
that's what Linux is.

 CW> My close circle of coder friends feel much the same way
 CW> & feel sort-of  lost & left out,  we understand the great advantage of
 CW> having portable executables & modern hardware & stuff, but none of us
 CW> feel we are able to participate at the current level.

The new Amiga isn't really aimed at Amiga owners (what's the new word? 
"Amigans" or something?).  It does appear to be very much grown in the current
Unix revival/Microsoft backlash.

 CW> 1:  I believe there is no "Workbench" as we know it yet,
 CW>      however, there is a shell environment of some sort...
 CW>      Is it an Amiga shell or a Linux shell used to launch programs from
 CW> ?

Unix shell.  The command set is Unix as is its behaviour.

There is no ReadArgs system (yet?) AFAIK, so command line parameters are going
to be similar to what you get from Un*x ports on the Amiga - i.e., a
incomprehensible mess without structure.  But ReadArgs is possible one of the
easier things to port - it's a shame Amiga Inc have said AmigaOS is obsolete
and only "ideas" will be taken from it.

 CW> 2:  Is there any sort of desktop or "Workbench" type interface yet,
 CW>      even a primative one. ?

Doesn't appear so.

 CW> 3:  I believe there is no "Intuition" or "Graphics" libraries yet,
 CW>      but people are porting programs with GUI's.
 CW>      How do you run a program with a GUI if no gui libs exist yet. ?

Remember that the SDK is effectively an OS from Tao.  I don't know at what
point that mess will be replaced with Amiga-like subsystems.

Maybe because:

2) he hit send twice

Anyone can make a mistake :-)

The SDK does not run native - it has to run under Linux. It doesn't
need any specific video card (the libraries that will make use of
the recommended Matrox card aren't available yet) so any PC that
will run RedHat 6.1 or a derivitive will be OK for the SDK.

Hi there

Just a short note to let everyone know that KICKSTART will be attending the
SEAL-O-RAMA show on Sunday September 10 2000.

In addition to being one of the largest Amiga user groups in the UK,
KICKSTART is also proud to be the UK point of registration for a growing
number of Amiga shareware titles. At SEAL-O-RAMA, we will be selling from
our stand (located in the usergroup area) authorised registered versions of
Moovid, the acclaimed Amiga MPEG video player, available in 680x0 and PPC
versions. We are also hoping to preview Frogger and several other titles.

We will also be demonstrating the Ateobus expansion system for the A1200 on
behalf of Ateo Concepts in France. This highly useful and cost effective
expansion system is available direct from Ateo Concepts in France is an
excellent way to expand a towered A1200, allowing the addition or cheap
Graphics, SCSI, Ethernet, Serial/Parallel controllers and other cards to
come. The Ateo guys seldom have the chance to show off this system in the
UK, so come to the KICKSTART stand to see this awesome expansion system at
work.

Also at our stand, you will have the chance to chat to KICKSTART members and
seek advice on software and hardware problems. You'll be able to find our
more about the group and all the benefits membership offers, as well as
being able to join up.

We hope you can come along to see us and to support our good friends at
SEAL.

Cheers
Chris Green
PR Officer
Kickstart Amiga User Group

I have no idea what c.s.a.marketplace is, or how to get there. I don't
think it would be much use as I don't have a credit card, and if I did,
I still wouldn't use it on the 'net. Please, list members, don't bother
sending me reams of mail informing me of the error of my ways, and how 
safe using cc's on the 'net is. I've been through this all b4.

Thanks for your trouble, Mike.

Regards... Tiny

Yeah, right. Have you actually bothered to go there and write an 
email to them? Well, I have. Ten so far, and 2 snail mail letters,
including a replied paid one. Not a single reply. I hope they go
broke. They deserve to for their lack of interest in a paying
customer. I'm not the least bit interested in "*GVP is run by 2*
*men who are holding down full-time jobs*" as was mentioned by another
responder. If you're in busines, and advertising on the WWW, you 
should reply to interested parties. They are useless.

I dumped it into moreHTML here, and it didn't make much more sense that
way than the raw text did.  It was easier to read though.  PITA.

Yeah, when???

If you read the above you will have discovered that I'd attempted
to contact them continuously by various means over a longish period
of time. I failed to mention that numerous phone calls also failed
to get a response. I think you were very, very lucky. Maybe you
live next door.

Just to inform you a little more, I was given a couple of email
addresses from stores handling Amiga stuff in the US. After them
informing me they had no GVP gear, I mailed them again asking if=20
they could contact GVP regarding my sp=EAcific needs. They both
mailed back that GVP failed to answer their queries, and phoning
seemed to be a wate of time as no one was answering.

Regards... Tony

Hi,

I can't figure out where the settings are wrong. Is there a chance
to get some more help? Could I maybe 'export' the settings to have
somebody take a look?

Well hanut c.s.a.marketplace.  I saw some there just a night or two ago.
 You will find them eventually.  In face email Hal Greeenlee of Hal's
Hardrivers, I think they were in his add.  He does answer his email.  I
just got AdPro from him.  mailto:hrgreen@worldnet.att.net.  And
something that small I think he will ship even to Australia.

PC side I take it?

First you need to see if the PC can see the Amiga.  I'll assume you 
have given the PC network card the IP address 192.168.0.10 and the 
Amiga's network card the address 192.168.0.11

On the PC, Start-->Programs-->MS-DOS Prompt

Type:
	ping 192.168.0.11

and press return, you should get something like:

	Pinging 192.168.0.11 with 32 bytes of data:
	Reply from 192.168.0.11: bytes=32 time=9ms TTL=32
	Reply from 192.168.0.11: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=32
	Reply from 192.168.0.11: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=32
	Reply from 192.168.0.11: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=32

If so then you need to configure DNS and Gateway settings on the PC as follows:

In the Start-->Settings-->Control Panel-->Network
Double click TCP/IP or TCP/IP > Network Adapter Model
Click the DNS Configuration tab
Select Enable DNS
Host - Windoze98
Domain - Stefan
DNS Search Order - put in the DNS addresses for your ISP and click 
Add after each
Click the Gateway tab
New gateway - put in the IP address of the Amiga 192.168.0.11 and click Add
Click OK
Click OK
Much chuntering and whirring, demands for Windows CD, yes you want to 
restart your computer. Should work now.

If on the other hand you get:

	Pinging 192.168.0.11 with 32 bytes of data:
	Request timed out.
	Request timed out.
	Request timed out.
	Request timed out.

Then the PC can't see the Amiga, for one of...well lots of reasons 
please e-mail the list and I'll try and think of how to fix them 
"fly-by-wire" style.  If you can, the results from winipcfg.exe with 
the "More Info >>>" button clicked would be handy:

Start-->Run
Type "winipcfg" in the box (without the quotes)
Click OK
Click More Info >>>
Just the information from the boxes that have bits filled in.

As for exporting the settings, no not really, they seem to sit in 
various places in the registry, almost as if somebody had emptied a 
box of needles in the haystack.

Regards,

Mike

I seems like you've got a bad soldering in your FDD.
Insering the FD might give the drive that little internal
bending that fixes the problem.

FYI, I'm running a A1200 w/ WB3.0, 2megs Chip, 
GVP-1230+8megs Fast Ram, Int 40meg HDD, Ext 540meg HDD 
(Dataflyer XDS). Patches, Hacks, and CXs I have running at 
any given time are too many to list here. 

Earlier tonight, when I quit Termite TCP (TTCP) my 
workbench was suddenly filled with busy icons for ALL my 
hard drives and everything locked up tight. A three finger 
salute failed to achieve any effect. So, I did a cold boot 
and everything went back to normal. Still, it's left me 
puzzled as to what might've caused the system to do that. 

More often than not, shutting down TTCP will lead to a 
instruction error or crosslinked memory error that crashes 
the system. As such, most of the time I just leave it up 
once I start the program. Even when it does shut down 
correctly (doing a memory flush and running another program 
before shutting it down usually spares me a crash), I've 
*never* had this particular problem happen before. 

Add to that, over the last week or so, my DF0: has suddenly 
tried to read without any reason. No program I was running 
at the time should've been making read/writes to the FDD. 
I've placed a FD partially in the drive (but not all the 
way in - as it would be after pressing the ejection button) 
and that seemed to stop that problem. 

Still, I'm wondering if these could be warning signs of a 
possible developing hardware problem. The only things I've 
had to replace are the stock power supplies and mice. The 
interior HDD is on it's last legs, and occassionally won't 
spin up right. Still, that was an extremely weird thing to 
happen.

Have you checked for overheating on any of the custom chips? That might
explain DF0: going too.

I'm not really totally sure what would cause those problems, but it sounds
like either something serious to do with software (have you installed any
hacks, or anything at all, recently?), or a hardware problem that could be
a number of things. I'm inclined to think overheating, so try finding out
if any of the chips do get obscenely hot. Also check that all the socketed
ones are still properly located, and that your power and so on is
sufficient.

Please correct me anyone if you disagree; I'm kinda stabbing in the dark
here.

Oh, to try and eliminate software, try booting with so s-s and see if the
FDD thing still happens.


Sooner,

        Sandy, trying to sound knowledgeable

I am having some problems with my High Density floppy in the 4000 along
these lines.  It reads disks write protected when they are not, throws read
errors that are not there, and fails in more formats than it succeeds. I am
hoping it is simply dirt.  However ripping the machine down to clean that
drive is a bear.

Sorry, but I have bad news for you.....

The 4000 desktop boards have a surface mounted buffer chip 
that becomes intermittent,  this chip buffers the diskchange signal
as well as some others.   It will require changing the chip.

I have had 2 other 4000's here with exactly the same fault.
The only other thing that seems to be a common fault is the
buffer chip that drives the HD activity LED on the front panel.

It will flicker or come on & stay on, even if there is no activity.
Needless to say,  same situation is required to fix it.
(it's surface mounted too)

The killer fault is the nicad battery for the RTC,  that one is
fatal to 4000 desktop boards....


Analogic Computers in the UK does a nice reconditioning 
service on 4000's....

hi!

still working with the network problem but another question: some
people from Australia auround here? some German telephone carriers
offer free 'Olympic' calls to Australia - a good opinion to test
if I can connect to a free Australian internet provider :)

Who has the needed information? Is DellNet maybe free earthwide?

regards,
Stefan

Ug, that must of been the most nasty email ever.

PLEASE turn off the HTML, i'm sure there is an option
to do that somewhere on yahoo.fr

Also please remember to edit our everyone elses signatures,
adverts and egroups adverts. It makes the emails slightly

Not as much as I did a few months ago- I gave up on the amigactive and
afb-ot lists when they got more heavy than afb. Still lurking here and
there though, as well as ag-nes or course!


Sooner,

Quick clean of the Drive usually cures the Problem (For Me) But I

Hi Frank,

thanks for the URLs - but after taking a look I'm a bit
disappointed: all those ISP sponsor their service and limit
the use of it or use advertising.
I want/need a provider where one does not need to register and just
pays for phone calls. Any idea where to ask? Another mailing list?

Thanks so far!

Regards,
Stefan

This  is  a long letter, off topic for an Amiga list, but many of you
use both platforms, and it was brought up by Stefan's query, and then
Frank's  answer.  Maybe  someone can point Stefan and me to a PC list
that is as friendly and as helpful as most (all) Amiga lists.

*--- Start Warning ---*

First a warning: Be very, very careful using one of these Free ISP's.

I might point out that none of the above can be used by the Amiga, as
these  "Free"  ISP's need a PC specific app that is sent on CD to set
it  all up. This program allows dozens of adverts to be shown on your
Browsers screen, which is the way these free ISP's seem to work. I've
no idea if this PC software will work with an emulator.

The  Aussie  magazine,  "Net Guide" doesn't seem to be very impressed
with most of them and there have been some horrific stories doing the
rounds about the software causing all sorts of problems with PC's.

*--- End Warning ---*

The  following,  or  similar,  has happened to more than one of my PC
buddies,  (3  actually,  with  totally diverse systems) and should be
taken as a timely warning. NOTE: 2 of the above Free ISP's were used.

BTW...  the Acer in question is at my mates house as I don't have the
room  and I'm only interested in a couple of the apps that don't seem
to be available for the Amiga.

>From  the  very  first day my friend installed "globalfreeway" on our
co-owned,  late model, highly optioned Acer, he had various problems,
despite  a  long phone call to GF regarding any installation or known
usage  problems.  We now believe we were told outright lies about how
many were online with them, and that they had not a single complaint.
They certainly told us lies about their "Helpline", which seems to be
consistantly un-available, off-line or engaged for very long periods,
day or night.

All  the above has now caused our system to crash with the CD-ROM not
being  recognised,  ergo,  he can't re-install the OS (Windows98 OEM)
which came on a CD supplied from Acer. The recovery disk we made also
does  not  work  and the documentation is next to useless, unless one
has  a  degree  on Computer Engineering from MIT. We don't, and don't
know  anyone  who  has  that doesn't want an arm and a leg to fix our
problem. Geez, $90 dollars an hr, or part thereof, with no promises.

Over a period of weeks, before the crash, things slowly went from bad
to  worse,  with  repeated locking up of most of the programs he used
daily,  things  being  altered on his system, ie. half the entries on
his  "Startbar"  mysteriously  vanished  one  day  after one of these
lock-ups.

Getting  online was a pain from day one, some times it would be hours
before  the  'net  could be accessed. And as for email, forget it, it
worked  randomly,  sometimes he could get mail, but not send, or just
the opposite, sometimes not at all.

The  day it went to s..t heaven, all he was trying to do was resize a
graphic  in  iPhoto Express, nothing out of the ordinary, just a .bmp
file  that  came  with the proggie and one he'd used before. Mr. Acer
just  locked  solid.  As  the  average  home PC is not famous for its
blistering  speed  with  this  type of thing, (redrawing a screen) he
waited  some  minutes  before  a safe shutdown and reboot. Nowt, nil,
nothing,  nada.  Bloody  black screen, nothing. After trying a couple
more  safe shutdown and reboots with no success, I went around and we
ran the Acer recovery CD, (it was still working at this stage, though
we  didn't  know  this)  and  let  it  do  its  thing. Removed it and
rebooted. Hooray, the nice Acer and then Windows screens came up, the
ubiquitous  hourglass spun for about 6 or 7 minutes, (not normal) and
eventually,  the Desktop appeared.

Twin  sighs  of  relief.  Hang  on a minute, why are all the icons so
huge, and things missing off the Startbar, and entries missing in the
Startbar menu, and different fonts being used by the Desktop, and the
Canon printer printing oddly with lots of strange artifacts, etc.

We  now  have a very large and colourful paperweight valued at nearly
$4  grand  sitting on its purpose-built desk, with no way of using it
to its full extent.

Any input would be appreciated, and I apologise for being so long.

TIA, to all you friendly folk out there.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Short of going to DOS and repartitioning the disk and re-fdisking it and
reformating it and installing everything over from scratch, the only
suggestion I can make is to take it into a data recovery shop and hope
for the best.  There is something on that disk, I don't know how to
remove otherwise, thanks to your free provider no doubt.

what kind of system have you got...

mpeg conversion is a drama at the best of times, mp3 on the other hand is
fairly easy if you get MPEGA from aminet, it's got a mp3 player using
mpega.library and you can use that to play mp3's in low quality (and 030/50
can do 1/4 sample rate in mono at 8 bit) or use it to stream them out onto
a hard drive or ram disk. note every meg of mp3 equates to an average of 10
meg or more of uncompressed wav file...

Blitzwing

I don't know of any like this that turn up in your e-mail inbox but
there are some newsgroups that I have found that can be very helpful.
Two I know of are:-

  alt.windows98
  alt.windows.98

Note carefully the . between "windows" and "98" in the second but not
the first - they are DIFFERENT groups. There are similar ones for
Windows 95.

The first is far more active than the second but the 2nd is reasonably
active (a lot more than this Amiga list!)

I am sure you would get some helpful hints if you were to post your
problem there.

Howdy Blitzwing

Thanx for your input :) I own an A4000 030 at 27hz, mp3's play in spits and
spats so I would like to convert them to wav and to have control over the
audio quality.
mpegs I can play most formats except that they are like real slow, about 1
frame per second. I have a converter thats shareware but I need to register
to chose a size and I have to convert money and send overseas, but that
sort of thing confuses me. 

thank you for your help I appreciate it very much.

Regards

Converters?  There is free software on Aminet to encode and decode MP3, from
raw data you can convert it to anything you want...

How on earth did you get an a4000 at 27Mhz,
as far as I know, the 030's in 4000's were 33Mhz parts.

You can play mp3's on an 030-33Mhz machine, but you
have to crank the frequency limit back to 20khz or so...
(use mpega)
but don't even think of multi-tasking at the same time.

You could of course get an 040 or 060 board for your machine.
An 060 lets me play MP3's at 44Khz with less than 40% CPU use.

The 040 may be a better avenue as everyone who has a 4000
& bought a Cyberstorm, they now have a spare cpu module...

You may be able to pick an 040 card up quite cheaply,
put an add on  http://amibench.org/

actually 030's came 5 flavours (to my knowledge), 16,25,33,40,50, with the
exception of some peoples overclocking them...

4k's I have seen have had 030 @ 25 and 33...

I wouldn't even try to play mp3's beyond 11025 khz in mono with an 030 (even
at 50MHZ) which is what is in one of my 1200's

the 040's do quite well, 040@40 can do it 44100 / stereo but with very
little cpu to spare... look around, I have seen some boards for the 1200
that have hardware mpeg decoders on them, you might should be able to get
one for the 4k

Just an after thought,  download  "mpega_gui"  too..
It makes playing with it a lot easier,  plus you can tweak
the playback rate until you get it to play continuously 
a bit easier.

I take it that the PC is able to connect to the Internet on it's own and you
want to share the connection to share the phone line?  I think this may be
one problem because the PC will effectively have two gateways to the
Internet, you may have to remove the dial-up adapter, or create a second
hardware profile.

Sounds likely, please see the pretty version I have just e-mailed you, sorry
it is a GIF, the IFF was about 2.5 times the size.

> I send you, Mike, a Miami snapshot - maybe there's another error.

Just one thing - the gateway on the Amiga's PCMCIA card should not be the
PC, the gateway tells the computer where to go if it needs something that is
not on the local network i.e. on the Internet.  Since there is no way to the
Internet through the PC, the gateway for the PCMCIA card should be blank.

Regards,

Mike

Hi all,

Two days ago, out of the blue, STRICQ stopped working.

When I try to log in, it sits there with "Logging in..." in the
status bar, and gets no further.  It's not failing to contact the
server; it seems to be hanging somewhere during the login
process.  I'vw tried several different ICQ servers, all to no
avail.

I don't think it's my settings, as I tried installing STRICQ into
an empty directory with no settings.  Same problem.

This is happening with versions 0.1727 and 0.1732.

Has it happened to anyone else?  If so, how did you fix it?

-Stephen (tearing out hair)

ok, the only thing I have different is the gateway, mine is set to
192.168.0.2 (bbut that is my pc's ip address) aside from that it looks the
same...

from your amiga, run up a shell (cli) and do 
miami:miamiping 127.0.0.1
miami:miamiping 192.168.0.1 (your amiga's ip)
miami:miamiping 192.168.0.98 (your pc's ip)

and see what you get, you could also do the same from the pc end, check for
time out's...

Regards

Blitzwing

MPEGA *is* a converter:

---------------------------------------------

To play MP3 audio on an 030@50:

mpega -d4 -q0 -m <file>

On an 040@40:

mpega -d2 -q0 <file>

To save the audio in an MP3 in Wave format:

mpega -W <mp3 file> <destination file>

To do the above silently:

mpega -s -W <mp3 file> <destination file>

removing the dial-up adapter would be no problem - if I knew how to

Just double click in the title of the song from mpega_gui
& a decode window will open, which will allow you to save it as

Greetings All...

To all those who responded re: Apollo accelerators, thanx. Those that
suggested  I  go to Aminet seem to have got it wrong, unless Aminet's
search engine is absolutely hopeless. I tried "Apollo" and "Blizzard"
and  found  only  1 out of dozens of results pertaining to the Apollo
1230  accelerator,  and  that  was  a  huge file of schematics. Not a
review to be found on either. Is it me or is it Aminet?

A  trawl  of  the  now  defunct  English  Amiga mags confirmed what I
thought,  and  what some of you said, Apollo's up to markII seemed to
have  varied  problems.  One responder said his markIII was OK, but I
think  I  need to find out much more before I make a decision. Thanx,
anyway.

Greetings All...

i-amiga@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu, just-amiga@onelist.com

I  recently  asked  the  list  why I had to constantly sign in on the
eGroups site, despite the fact that I'd ticked "Remember Me".

I was informed that I needed "Download Cookies" on in iBrowse. 

Well, I've got the cookie in my iBrowse cache drawer, but eGroups now
pops  up 4 or 5 requesters asking me to confirm that I want to d/load
a cookie.  Can anyone tell me why?

My question now is, once I've got the cookie in iB's cache, can I now
use  the cycle button in iB to turn off the d/l of same. Exactly what
should  be  my  settings in iBrowse when the cookie resides in the iB
cache, permanently?

TIA.

I'd suggest trying www.cucug.org they used to be the biggest amiga user
group org online in the world. They had massive hardware review's on the
site along with a stack of other stuff. They stopped supporting the Amiga a
few months back but I don't know if they took that section of the site

it's a crossover (twisted pair) cable and yes, the Amiga Fiberline
adaptor has a link light.

another problem: since removing the dialup adaptor and changing some
other settings Windows asks me to enter a network password every
time I start Windows! how can I get rid of it?

Go into network properties and change the default login to 'family
login'.

Unless it's not the network password and just the user passwords, in
which case go into control panel and I think it's 'users' or
something

(I don't have my pc handy to check :)

   You'll have to add it again, I think it's under services or

why create hassles, go into network properties and see what primary network
logon is. I have mine set to windows logon, and when I first logged in, I
didn't enter a pasword, just a username, and it never bothered me again. If
you've already got a password, delete any users you can find. then go into
passwords, enter your old password and then click ok, you should be able to
set a nil password

final suggestion, can you do snapshots of everything. All the network
windows on the pc and all the miamidx windows too. This is not necessary,
but since we can't actually look at your machine it may show up
something...

Hello Stefan,

>>> Go into network properties and change the default login to 'family
>>> login'.

Ummm...there is an easier way and you will still have to click ok at logon
with the Family Logon, try this...

Make sure that in Network Control Panel the "Primary Network Logon" is
"Windows Logon"

Remove all the password list ".pwl" files.  They are in the form:

c:\windows\username.pwl

Where username is the name(s) you log in with.  Remove them all.

Then shut down Windows and when you restart it will ask you for your
username and password.

Put in a username but no password, click ok

It will then ask you to confirm, just click ok

Result - no password required - and no login box

Regards

Mike

Is it lit, and does it go out when you turn the PC off or remove the network
cable from the back of the PC?  Are there any lights on the back of the PC
card?  They may not be marked but what do they do - stay off/stay
on/blink/flash occasionally/flash randomly?  When you switch off the Amiga
or remove the network cable does this change them?

Blitzwing - do we need to worry about duplex and other things that are
auto-configured?  Maybe one of the cards needs something to talk to when it
starts up?  How about setting both cards manually with connection as 10BaseT
Half Duplex and the media type set to Twisted Pair?

Blitzwing - I put snapshots of my suggestion for the PC side on

    http://homepage.ntlworld.com/gompertz/stefan/

Stefan - Snapshots of the adapter settings would be useful, the tabs should
be "Driver Type", "Bindings" and "Advanced".  Also can you check in the
System control panel and the "Device Manager" tab and tell me if there are
any red exclamation marks or yellow triangles against anything, and I mean
anything - even the wrong video drivers can cause system-wide problems in
Win95/98 (and presumably WinME)

Mike

Tony, 

Depends on which version you're using. In IB 1.2, go to 
preferences, network, security. In IB 2.2 go to 
preferences, security. 

There you'll find a a drop down menu gadget where you can 
select how to handle cookies. In 2.2 there's two, one for 
persistent and temporary cookies. Change the settings to 
either "Accept" and won't be bothered with any confirmation 
requesters. Select "Ask on First" and you should only get 
one confirmation requester. If you're the only one using 
your computer, also click on the box "Save Cookies" and you

I saw this on AFB. The problem was he still got the interlaced
flicker.

All I can suggest is ask eyetech (again?) or try it on someone elses
amiga.

What does it say about it in the manual. Actually, has it been
reviewed in AF?

See ya :)

Well the flicker fixer part may just be out.  It is on the built in one
on my old backup A3000, and it was definitely a flicker fixer at one
time.  Now the scandoubler still works, but the flicker in NTSC or PAL
interlace is as bad as on an A1080 or 1084.  At least I can still get
native modes.

I have a couple of the Apollo ones. 
The scan doubler function works all the time,
but if you want the flicker fixer option,  you have to buy 
the pair of static rams seperately if you didn't buy it 
complete with FF in the first place.

The absence of the static field buffer ram means it will only
be a scan doubler.. 

I don't know what yours has, but this may be of help...

Subject: [just-amiga] Freeciv
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi all!

I'm trying to get Freeciv to work on my Ami and I need some help.

1/ Where do I find bsdsocket.library? I've downloaded AmiTCP v2.2 and the
v2.3 update from Aminet but can not find it.

2/ Is it possible to set up Miami (or AmiTCP for that matter) to work as a
local TCP-IP stack?
I've got the OS3.5 version but no modem.

Install Miami, start Miami (no need to be online) and then start the game.
It should work :)

It's not a disk based library.

Miami creates it on the fly,  so when you start up miami
it automagically appears in the library list....

the Amiga Ethernet adapter has to LEDs: one named "LINK", the other
"ACT". LINK is off when the PC is turned off. While booting the PC
is on most of the time while ACT starts to flicker heavily until the
desktop appears.
When I try to ping the Amiga from the PC-DOS-box ACT blinks one time
every time ping reports a time-out!?

There seems to be a LED - but it's never on.

Since I don't have a snapshot tool for the PC (where can I get a
freeware one?) and my 1200 doesn't want to read 720k-disks at the
moment I'll type what I see there:

FE100R II/III Fast Ethernet Adapter:
*Driver Type*
-NDIS-driver for 'extended' mode (32-Bit and 16-Bit)
*Bindings*
-TCP/IP is checked, nothing else there
*Advanced*
-"Early Tx Threshold" is set to "10"
-"Link Speed/Duplex Mode" is set to "Auto Mode" (should I try
"10 Full Mode" or "10 Half Mode" here??)
-"Network Address" is set to "192.168.0.98"

[ later... ] I tried to change the speed settings to "10 Full Mode"
and "10 Half Mode" but with no effect.

no - everything ok there.

thanks for all your help...

I would suggest you try the same place you bought it from,

You don't need one, you press the "Print Screen" key (you might need the
shift key as well but my G4 doesn't have the F13 key to test it)
This will put the screen picture onto the clipboard and you can paste it
into Paint etc. crop as necessary and then save it.

Is there any option on the Amiga side to set 10Mbit/s half or full duplex to
match the PC setting?

It sounds like the PC side is set-up ok.

A few more questions:

Is there any configuration software for the PCMCIA card or does Miami handle
this?
Does the PCMCIA card manual say what settings it defaults to?
Did you buy the crossover cable "shrink wrapped" or did you or someone else
make it up?
If you can, test the cable with a meter - you should find a diagram on
http://www.pin-outs.com/ - if you can't test it you may still be able to see
the colours of the wires in the connectors just to check it is a full
crossover cable.
I've never really had any joy connecting two machines with a crossover cable
- is there any possibility of borrowing a hub?

Regards

Mike

another suggestion, try dropping the NDIS-driver from extended 32 bit to one
of the 16 bit only modes, I have real mode's 16bit NDIS and 16bit ODI,
sometimes you may have to downgrade it to someyhingl ike that so to

Real mode (or DOS) drivers are those that are loaded in config.sys or
autoexec.bat that may allow you to use the hardware in DOS.

Those settings are really to do with Windows networking history where the
client was DOS based and loaded before Windows.  When Win95 came out new
32-bit drivers were not available for some network cards and so they still
had to be loaded in DOS.

It might be that your (Blitzwing's) machine has been upgraded from Win3.1
and may have had the DOS client for Microsoft or Netware networking, or
there is a line in the startup files that changes some settings on the card,
or it is an old network card that is not directly supported by Windows - it
doesn't really matter and as with anything in Windows if it ain't broke
don't fix it.

Stefan's PC on the other hand should be left in the Enhanced mode if that is
what Windows has said it is happy with.

I think the PC is setup ok, I think the Amiga network card is unable to
properly auto configure when talking to the PC network card it may be
judging it from the connections available in the crossover cable (there are
a few different specs for the wiring) and setting 100Mbits/s full duplex or
something.

Does anybody know set the Amiga card manually?  Perhaps in Miami?

Regards,

Mike

actually not entirely accurate, I've never had dos (1-6.22) or anythingless
than win95 now 98 on my machine, some software actually requires it not for
netowkring but for protocol level synchronising, ie the packets don't
correspond and the computer can't see or talk to other machines...

I've have had to drop back off enhanced mode to tlkk to other 95/98 machines
to play games like Red Alert and so forth...

there is nothing one can do, other than use the Amiga driver software for
the netowk card if there is any, or hack the cnet.device I have extensovely
perused miami / miamidx for options as such, and there are none, perhaps we
should submits some request to Holger for these controls and if it's
possible on a windows box, it's possible anywhere..
