Short: Borland Ashton-Tate Dbase file layout and Amiga ODBC proposal.

Why is it that I can't find a single Database application for the Amiga which will read dBaseIV
files.  Here's my proposal.  Kill two birds with the one stone. Produce a "database.datatype"
class and then produce datatypes which can read databases. We would then be in the position of P.C. owners
who can open various databases through O.D.B.C. (Open DataBase Connectivity). So ,for example, an
Xbase datatype could open any dbase file. Existing database applications would only need to be
able to use datatypes to read many new filetypes.

Included in this archive is some documents I've found on the dBase/Xbase file format which may
help somebody as I've been unable to find this information anywhere on Aminet.

Note some of the documents contain slightly different information and there is probably a lot of
overlap but I have included them all for the sake of completeness.
