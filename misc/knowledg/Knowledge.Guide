                                   @{b}@{u}FOREWORD@{ub}@{uu}

This is an insert which does not appear in the printed edition.

I was not raised in the Truth, so I came into the Truth, first studying
the `Live Forever' publication, and then `The Knowledge That Leads to
Everlasting Life', when it was released at the District Convention.

[At the time of writing,] I am currently still studying the book myself,
and I found that since I love computers so much, I thought I would enter
the entire `Knowledge' book into my fantastic Amiga, to aid me in my
learning.

This is, in fact, an exact copy of `The Knowledge That Leads To Everlasting
Life' as published by the WatchTower Bible and Tract Society, of New York,
Inc.  Yep, it is copyrighted, but I don't plan to release this, other than
to any of the other Brothers in the Truth, who happen to have an Amiga!
So, I just hope that the authors will forgive me!

So.... I really hope you enjoy this computerized version, and find it
very helpful.  If you do not know me personally, please don't hesitate
to drop me a line at:   @{b}cmsdloma@livjm.ac.uk@{ub}  and this address is
theoretically valid until 1999, provided Armegeddon hasn't come by then!

  "This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you,
   the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ."

                                                            -- John 17:3

                               ENJOY!!  -- Dave

@node "Intro" "Knowledge That Leads To Everlasting Life - Illustration"

                                @{b}@{u}INTRODUCTION@{ub}@{uu}

[In the printed edition of the book, `Knowledge That Leads To Everlasting
Life', the first few pages show a paradise environment, with many happy
people living in harmony with their animal friends.  The illustration is
based on Isaiah 11:6-9:

"And the wolf will actually reside for a while with the male
 lamb, and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down, and the
 calf and the maned young lion and the well-fed animal all together;
 and a mere little boy will be leader over them.

 And the cow and the bear themselves will feed; together their
 young ones will lie down. And even the lion will eat straw just like
 the bull.

 And the sucking child will certainly play upon the hole of the
 cobra; and upon the light aperture of a poisonous snake will a
 weaned child actually put his own hand.

 They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy
 mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the
 knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea."

And Isaiah 65:25:

"The wolf and the lamb themselves will feed as one, and the
 lion will eat straw just like the bull; and as for the serpent, his
 food will be dust. They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all
 my holy mountain,' Jehovah has said."

Which are both foregleams of the righteous new system of things--
God's Kingdom, which draws nearer and nearer to us every day.

The page has a box, which reads:]


                                  Beautiful
                                surroundings
                              like these can be
                                yours forever!

                                      O

                              do to enjoy them?
                             The answer lies in
                              a special kind of
                                  knowledge.

                                This book will
                                help you gain
                                the knowledge
                                that leads to
                               everlasting life.

@node "Chapter1" "You Can Have A Happy Future!"
@prev "Main"

                        @{b}@{u}YOU CAN HAVE A HAPPY FUTURE!@{ub}@{uu}

1 A WARM embrace from someone you love.  Hearty laughter during a good meal
with dear friends.  The pleasure of watching your children cheerfully at
play.  Moments like these are bright spots in life.  For many, however, life
seems to present one serious problem after another.  If that has been your
experience, take heart.

2 It is God's will that you enjoy lasting hapiness under the best conditions
in wonderful surroundings.  This is no mere dream, for God actually offers
you the key to such a happy future.  That key is knowledge.

3 We are talking about a special kind of knowledge that is far greater than
human wisdom.  It is "the very knowledge of God." (Proverbs 2:5).  Nearly
2,000 years ago, a Bible writer said:  "Every house is constructed by
someone, but he that constructed all things is God." (Hebrews 3:4).  Think
of the knowledge that the Maker of all things must possess!  The Bible says
that God counts and names all the stars.  What a staggering thought, since
there are hundreds of billions of stars in our own galaxy, and astronomers
say that there are about a hundred billion other galaxies! (Psalm 147:4).
God also knows all about @{i}us@{ui}, so who else could provide better answers to
life's important questions? - Matthew 10:30

4 Picture two men trying to repair their cars.  Frustrated, one man throws
down his tools.  The other calmly corrects the problem, turns the ignition
key, and smiles as the engine starts up and runs smoothly.  You would not
have a hard time guessing which of the two men had an instruction manual
from the manufacturer.  Does it not make sense that God would provide
instructions to guide us in life?  As you may know, the Bible claims to be
just that - a book of instruction and guidance from our Creator, designed to
impart the knowledge of God. - 2 Timothy 3:16.

5 If the Bible's claim is true, think of what treasures of knowledge that
book must contain!  At Proverbs 2:1-5, it urges us to seek wisdom, to dig
for it as we would for a hidden treasure - not in the soil of human
thinking, but in God's own Word.  If we search there, we will "find the very
knowledge of God."  Since God understands our limitations and needs, he
gives us instruction that will help us to lead peaceful, happy lives.
(Psalm 103:14; Isaiah 48:17)  Furthermore, the knowledge of God offers us
exciting good news!

                              @{b}EVERLASTING LIFE!@{ub}

6 The well-known historical figure Jesus Christ described this feature of
the knowledge of God in a clear terms.  He said:  "This means @{i}everlasting
life@{ui}, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one
whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ." (John 17:3)  Imagine - knowledge that
leads to everlasting life!

7 Do not quickly dismiss everlasting life as a mere dream.  Instead, look at
the way the human body is made.  It is splendidly designed to taste, hear,
smell, see, and feel.  There is so much on the Earth that delights our
senses - delicious food, pleasant birdsong, fragrant flowers, beautiful
scenery, delightful companionship!  And our amazing brain is far more than a
supercomputer, for it enables us to appreciate and enjoy all such things. Do
you think that our creator wants us to die and lose all of this?  Would it
not be more reasonable to conclude that he wants us to live happily and to
enjoy life forever?  Well, that is what the knowledge of God can mean for
you.

                             @{b}LIFE IN PARADISE@{ub}

8 What the Bible says about the future of Earth and mankind might be summed
up in one word - Paradise!  Jesus Christ spoke of it when he told a dying
man:  "You will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23:43)  The mention of
Paradise no doubt brought to that man's mind the happy state of our first
parents, Adam and Eve.  When God created them, they were perfect and lived
in a gardenlike park that the Creator has designed and planted.  It was
fittingly called the garden of Eden, which name denotes pleasure.

9 How delightful that garden was!  It was a real paradise.  Among its
beautiful trees were those bearing delicious fruit.  As Adam and Eve
explored their domain, drank from its sweet waters, and gathered fruit from
its trees, they had no reason to be anxious or fearful.  Even animals posed
no threat, for God had placed the man and his wife in loving dominion over
all of them.  In addition, the first pair had vibrant health.  As long as
they remained obedient to God, an eternal, happy future lay before them.
They were given the satisfying work of caring for their wonderful Paradise
home.  Further, God gave Adam and Eve the mandate to "fill the Earth and
subdue it."  They and their offspring were to extend the borders of Paradise
until our entire planet became a place of beauty and delight. - Genesis 1:28.

10 When Jesus mentioned Paradise, however, he was not asking a dying man to
think about the distant past.  No, Jesus was speaking about the future!  He
knew that our entire Earthly home would become a Paradise.  God would thus
fulfill his original purpose for mankind and our Earth.  (Isaiah 55:10-11)
Yes, Paradise will be restored!  And what will it be like?  Let God's Word,
The Holy Bible, answer.

                       @{b}LIFE IN THE RESTORED PARADISE@{ub}

11 @{i}Sickness, old age, and death will no longer exist@{ui}.  "At that time the
eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones
will be unstopped.  At that time, the lame one will climb up just as a stag
does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness."
(Isaiah 35:5-6) "God himself will be with [mankind].  And he will wipe out
every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning
nor outcry not pain be anymore.  The former things have passed away."
- Revelation 21:3-4.

12 @{i}Crime, violence, and wickedness will be gone forever@{ui}.  "Evildoers
themselves will be cut off . . . Just a little while longer, and the wicked
one will be no more . . . He will not be.  But the meek ones themselves will
possess the Earth." (Psalm 37:9-11)  "As regards the wicked, they will be
cut off from the very Earth;  As for the treacherous, they will be torn away
from it." - Proverbs 2:22.

13 @{i}Peace will prevail earth wide@{ui}.  "He [God] is making wars cease to the
extremity of the Earth.  The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear into
peaces."  (Psalm 46:9)  "The righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of
peace until the moon is no more." - Psalm 72:7

14 @{i}Housing will be secure and work satisfying@{ui}.  "They will certainly build
houses and have occupancy . . . They will not build and someone else have
occupancy;  they will not plant and someone else do the eating.  For like
the days of a tree will the days of my people be;  and the work of their own
hands my chosen ones will use to the full.  They will not toil for nothing,
nor will they bring to birth for disturbance." - Isaiah 65:21-23

15 @{i}Healthful food will be available in abundance@{ui}.  "There will come to be
plenty of grain on the earth;  On the top of the mountains there will be an
overflow."  (Psalm 72:16)  "The earth itself will certainly give its
produce;  God, our God, will bless us." - Psalm 67:6

16 @{i}Everlasting life on a Paradise Earth will be delightful@{ui}, "The righteous
themselves will possess the earth, And they will reside forever upon it."
(Psalm 37:29) "The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the
desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron." - Isaiah 35:1

                         @{b}KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR FUTURE@{ub}

17 If life in Paradise appeals to you, let nothing hold you back from
gaining the knowledge of God.  He loves mankind and will bring about the
changes needed to make the Earth a Paradise.  After all, if you had the
power to end the misery and injustice so prevalent in the world, would you
not do so?  Would we expect God to do less?  Actually, the Bible speaks in
vivid terms of a time when God will remove this strife-ridden system and
replace it with a perfect, righteous rule.  (Daniel 2:44)  But the Bible
does much more than tell us about all of this.  It shows us how we can
survive into God's promised new world. - 2 Peter 3:13;  1 John 2:17.

18 The knowledge of God can also do much for you right now.  Life's deepest
and most disturbing questions are answered in the Bible.  Accepting its
guidance will help you to develop a friendship with God.  What a grand
privilege!  And this will enable you to enjoy the peace that God alone can
give.  (Romans 15:13, 33)  As you begin to take in this vital knowledge, you
are embarking on the most important and rewarding endeavor of your life. You
will never regret aquiring the knowledge of God that leads to everlasting
life.

19 We have referred to the Bible as the book containing the knowledge of
God.  Yet, how do we know that it is, not a book of human wisdom, but
something far greater?  We will consider this question in the @{"next chapter" link "Chapter2"}.

                                @{b}@{u}REVEALS THE@{ub}@{uu}

1 IT IS reasonable that our loving Creator would provide a book of
instruction and guidance for mankind.  And do you not agree that humans
need guidance?

2 More than 2,500 years ago, a prophet and historian wrote:  "It does not
belong to man who is walking even to direct his step."  (Jeremiah 10:23)
Today, the truthfulness of that statement is more evident than ever.  Thus,
historian William H. McNeill notes:  "The human adventure on the face of
this planet has been an almost uninterupptable series of crises and
disruptions of society's established order."

3 The Bible fills all our needs for wise direction.  True, many are
overwhelmed when they first look through the Bible.  It is a big book, and
some portions of it are not easy to understand.  But if you were given a
legal document outlining what you had to do in order to receive a valuable
inheritance, would you not take the time to study it carefully?  If you
found certain parts of the document hard to understand, likely you would
get the help of someone experienced in such matters.  Why not approach the
Bible with a similar attitude?  (Acts 17:11)  More is at stake than a
material inheritance.  As we learned in the @{"previous chapter" link "Chapter1"}, the knowledge of God
can lead to everlasting life.

4 Let us examine the book that reveals the knowledge of God.  We will first
give a brief overview of the Bible.  Then we will discuss reasons why many
informed people believe that it is the inspired Word of God.

                         @{b}WHAT THE BIBLE CONTAINS@{ub}

5 The Bible contains 66 books in two sections, often called the Old
Testament and the New Testament.  Thirty-nine Bible books were written
mainly in Hebrew and 27 in Greek.  The Hebrew Scriptures, consisting of
Genesis through Malachi, cover creation as well as the first 3,500 years of
human history.  Examing this part of the Bible, we learn about God's
dealings with the Irsaelites - from their birth as a nation in the 16th
Century, @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"} on into 5th Century @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}  The Greek Scriptures,
containing the books of Matthew through Revelation, focus on the teachings
and activities of Jesus Christ and his disciples during the first century
@{"C.E." alink "CE"}

6 Some claim that the "Old Testament" is for Jews and the "New Testament" is
for Christians.  But according to 2 Timothy 3:16, "@{i}all@{ui} Scripture is inspired
of God and beneficial."  Therefore, a proper study of the Scriptures must
include the entire Bible.  Actually, the two parts of the Bible compliment
each other, blending harmoniously to develop an overall theme.

7 Perhaps you have attended religious services for years and have heard some
of the Bible read aloud.  Or you may have read experpts from it yourself.
Did you know that the Bible has a common thread from Genesis through
Revelation?  Yes, a harmonious theme permeates the Bible.  What is that
theme?  It is the vindication of God's right to rule mankind and the
realization of his loving purpose by means of his Kingdom.  Later, we will
see just how God will fulfill this purpose.

8 In addition to outlining God's purpose, the Bible reveals his personality.
For example, from the Bible we learn that God has feelings and that the
choices we make matter to him.  (Psalm 78:40-41;  Proverbs 27:11;
Ezekiel 33:11)  Psalm 103:8-14 says that God is "merciful and gracious,
slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.  He treats us
compassionately, "remembering that we are made of mere dust" and return to
it at death. (Genesis 2:7; 3:19)  What marvelous qualities he displays!
Is this not the kind of God you want to worship?

9 The Bible gives us a clear view of God's standards.  These are sometimes
stated as laws.  More often, however, they are reflected in principles
taught by means of object lessons.  God had certain events in Israelite
history written down for our benefit.  These candid accounts show what
happens when people work in harmony with God's purpose, as well as the sad
outcome when they go their own way.  (1 Kings 5:4;11:4-6; 2 Chronicles
15:8-15)  Reading such real life accounts will undoubtedlt touch our hearts.
If we try to visualize the events recorded, we can identify with the people
involved in them.  Thus, we can benefit from good examples and can avoid the
pitfalls that ensnared wrongdoers.  However, this vital question requires an
answer:  How can we be sure that what we read in the Bible is actually
inspired of God?

                         @{b}CAN YOU TRUST IN THE BIBLE?@{ub}

10 Perhaps you have noticed that many books offering advice become outdated
in just a few years.  What about the Bible?  It is very old, and almost
2,000 years have passed since its last words were penned.  Some therefore
feel that it is not applicable to our modern age.  But if the Bible is
inspired of God, its advice should always be up-to-date despite its great
age.  The Scriptures should still be "beneficial for teaching, for
reproving, for setting things straight, for discipling in righteousness,
that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every
good work." - 2 Timothy 3:16-17.

11 Close examination reveals that Bible principles apply just as much today
as they did when they were first put down in writing.  When it comes to
human nature, for instance, the Bible reflects keen understanding that
applies to every generation of mankind.  We can easily see this in Jesus'
Sermon on the Mount, found in the book of Matthew, chapters 5 to 7.  This
sermon so impressed the late Indian leader Mohandas K. Gandhi that he
reportedly told a British official:  "When your country and mine shall get
together on the teachings laid down by Christ in this Sermon on the Mount,
we shall have solved the problems not only of our countries but those of the
whole world."

12 No wonder people are impressed by Jesus' teachings!  In the Sermon on the
Mount, he showed us the way to true hapiness.  He explained how to settle
disputes.  Jesus provided intructions on how to pray.  He pointed out the
wisest attitude to have toward material needs and gave the Golden Rule for
proper relationships with others.  How to detect religious frauds and how to
have a secure future were also among the points covered in this sermon.

13 In the Sermon on the Mount and throughout the rest of its pages, the
Bible clearly tells us what to do and what to avoid in order to improve our
lot in life.  So practical is its counsel that one educator was moved to
say:  "Although being a high-school counselor with bachelor's and master's
degrees and having read a large number of books on mental health and
psychology, I discovered that the Bible's counsel on such things as having a
successful marriage, preventing juvenile delinquency and how to gain and
keep friends is far superior to anything I have read or studied in college."
In addition to being practical and up-to-date, the Bible is dependable.

                             @{b}ACCURATE AND RELIABLE@{ub}

14 Though the Bible is not a science textbook, it is scientifically
accurate.  For example, at a time when most people believed that the earth
was flat, the prophet Isaiah referred to it as a "circle" (Hebrew, @{i}chugh@{ui},
which here carries the idea of "sphere"). (Isaiah 40:22)  The idea of a
spherical earth was not widely accepted until thousands of years after
Isaiah's day.  Furthermore, Job 26:7 - written more than 3,000 years ago -
states that God is "hanging the earth upon nothing."  Says one Bible
scholar:  "How Job knew the truth, demonstrated by astronomy that the earth
hangs self-poised in empty space, is a question not easily solved by those
who deny the inspiration of Holy Scripture."

15 The style of reporting found in the Bible also strengthens our confidence
in this age-old book.  Unlike myths, the events covered in the Bible are
linked to specific people and dates.  (1 Kings 14:25;  Isaiah 36:1;  Luke
3:1-2)  And wheras ancient historians nearly always engaged the victories of
thier rulers and hid their defeats and mistakes, the Bible writers were
candid and honest - even about their own serious sins, - Numbers 20:7-13; 2
Samuel 12:7-14; 24:10.

                             @{b}A BOOK OF PROPHECY@{ub}

16 Fulfilled prophecy gives conclusive evidence that the Bible is inspired
of God.  The Bible contains many prophecies that have been fulfilled in
detail.  Obviously, mere humans could not be responsible for this.  What,
then, is behind these prophecies?  The Bible itself says that "prophecy was
at no time brought by man's will, but men spoke from God as they were borne
along with holy spirit," or God's active force. (2 Peter 1:21)  Consider
some examples.

17 @{i}The fall of Babylon@{ui}.  Isaiah and Jeremiah both foretold Babylon's fall to
the Medes and the Persians.  Remarkably, Isaiah's prophecy about this event
was recorded some 200 years before Babylon was conquered!  The following
aspects of prophecy are now matters of historical record:  "the drying up of
the Euphrates River by diverting its waters to an artificial lake (Isaiah
44:27;  Jeremiah 50:38); a careless lack of security at Babylon's river
gates (Isaiah 45:1); and the conquest by a ruler named Cyrus. - Isaiah
44:28

18 @{i}The rise and fall of "the king of Greece."@{ui}  In a vision, Daniel saw a
male goat strike down a ram, breaking its two horns.  Then, the goat's great
horn was broken, and four horns came up in its place.  (Daniel 8:1-8)  To
Daniel it was explained:  "The ram that you saw posessing the two horns
stands for the kings of Media and Persia.  And the hairy he-goat stands for
the king of Greece;  and as for the great horn between its eyes, it stands
for the first king.  And that one having been broken, so that there were
four that finally stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms in his
nation that will stand up, but not with his power."  (Daniel 8:20-22). True
to this prophecy, some two centuries later, "the king of Greece,"  Alexander
the Great, overthrew the two-horned Medo-Persian Empire.  Alexander died in
323 @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"} and was eventually replaced by four of his generals.  However,
none of these subsequent kingdoms matched the power of Alexander's empire.

19 @{i}The life of Jesus Christ@{ui}.  The Hebrew Scriptures contain scores of
prophecies fulfilled in the birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of
Jesus.  For example, more than 700 years in advance, Micah foretold that the
Messiah, or Christ, would be born in Bethlehem.  (Micah 5:2;  Luke 2:4-7)
Micah's contemporary Isaiah foretold that the Messiah would be struck and
spit upon.  (Isaiah 50:6;  Matthew 26:67)  Five hundred years in advance,
Zechariah prophesied that the Messiah would be betrayed for 30 pieces of
silver.  (Zechariah 11:12;  Matthew 26:15)  More than a thousand years
beforehand, David foretold circumstances associated with the death of Jesus
the Messiah.  (Psalm 22:7-8,18;  Matthew 27:35,39-43)  And some five
centuries in advance, Daniel's prophecy revealed when the Messiah would
appear as well as length of his ministry and time of his death.  (Daniel
9:24-27)  This is just a sampling of the prophecies fulfilled in Jesus
Christ.  You fill find it rewarding to read much more about him later.

20 Many other long-range Bible prophecies have already been fulfilled.
`But,' You may ask, `How does this affect my life?'  Well, it someone told
you the truth for many years, would you suddenly doubt him when he said
something new?  No!  God has told the truth throughout the Bible.  Should
this now build your trust in what the Bible promises, such as its prophecies
regarding a coming earthly paradise?  Indeed, we can have the same
confidence as did Paul, one of Jesus' first-century disciples, who wrote
that `God cannot lie.'  (Titus 1:2)  Furthermore, when we read the
Scriptures and apply their counsel, we are exercising wisdom that humans
cannot achieve on their own, for the Bible is the book that reveals the
knowledge of God that leads to everlasting life.

                              @{b}"FORM A LONGING"@{ub}
                          @{b}FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD@{ub}

21 As you study the Bible, you are likely to learn things that differ from
what you have been taught in the past.  You may even find that some of your
cherished religious customs do not please God.  You will learn that God has
standards of right and wrong higher than those common in this permissive
world.  This may seem overwhelming at first.  But be patient!  Carefully
examine the Scriptures to find the knowledge of God.  Be open to the
possibility that the Bible's counsel may call for an adjustment in your
thinking and actions.

22 Well-meaning friends and relatives may oppose your study of the Bible,
but Jesus said:  "Everyone, then, that confesses union with me before men, I
will also confess union with him before my Father who is in the heavens; but
whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who
is in the heavens."  (Matthew 10:32-33)  Some may fear that you will become
involved with a cult or it will turn into a finatic.  In reality, however,
you are merely striving to gain accurate knowledge of God and of his truth.
(1 Timothy 2:3-4)  To help others understand this, be reasonable, not
argumentative, when you speak to them about what you are learning.
(Philippians 4:5)  Remember that many are "won without a word" when they see
evidence that Bible knowledge really benefits people. - 1 Peter 3:1-2.

23 The Bible urges us:  "As newborn infants, form a longing for the
unadulterated milk belonging to the word." (1 Peter 2:2).  An infant depends
upon nourishment from its mother and is insistent on having that need met.
Similarly, we are dependent on knowledge from God.  "Form a longing" for his
Word by continuing your study.  Indeed, make it your goal to read the Bible
daily.  (Psalm 1:1-3)  This will bring you rich blessings, for Psalm 19:11
says of God's laws:  "In keeping of them there is a large reward."

@node "Chapter3" "Who Is The True God?"

                           @{b}@{u}WHO IS THE TRUE GOD?@{ub}@{uu}

1 WHEN you look at the sky on a clear night, are you not amazed to see so
many stars?  How do you account for their existence?  And what about the
living things on Earth - colorful flowers, birds with their delightful
songs, powerful whales that leap in the ocean?  The list goes on and on. All
of this could not have come about by chance.   No wonder many agree with the
Bible's opening words:  "In the beginning God created the heavens and the
Earth"! - Genesis 1:1.

2 Mankind is greatly divided on the question of God.  Some think that God is
an impersonal force.  Millions worship dead ancestors, believing that God is
too remote to be approached.  But the Bible reveals that the true God is a
real person who shows a warm interest in us as individuals.  That is why it
encourages us to "seek God," saying:  "He is not far off from each one of
us." - Acts 17:27.

3 What does God look like?  A few of his servants have seen visions of his
glorious presence.  In these he has symbolized himself seated on a throne,
awesome brightness extending from him.  However, those who beheld such
visions never described a distinct face.  (Daniel 7:9-10;  Revelation 4:2-3)
That is because "God is a Spirit"; he does not have a physical body. (John
4:24).  In fact, it is impossible to make an accurate physical image of our
Creator, for "no man has seen God at any time." (John 1:18; Exodus 33:20)
Yet, the Bible teaches us much about God.

                           @{b}THE TRUE GOD HAS A NAME@{ub}

4 In the Bible, the true God is identified by such expressions as "God
Almighty," "the Most High," "Grand Creator," "Grand Instructor," "Sovereign
Lord," and "King of Eternity." (Genesis 17:1;  Psalm 50:14; Ecclesiastes
12:1;  Isaiah 30:20;  Acts 4:24;  1 Timothy 1:17)  Meditating upon such
titles can help us grow in the knowledge of God.

5 However, God has a unique name that appears almost 7,000 times in the
Hebrew Scriptures alone - more often than any of his titles.  Some 1,900
years ago, the Jews superstitiously ceased to pronounce the divine name.
Biblical Hebrew was written without vowels.  Hence, there is no way to be
precise about how Moses, David, or others of ancient times pronounced the
@{"four consonants YHWH or JHVH in Hebrew" system "JW\KL:VT JW\KL:YHWH.IFF"}, that make up the divine name. Some
scholars suggest that God's name may have been pronounced "Yahweh," but they
cannot be sure.  The english pronounciation "Jehovah" has been in use for
centuries, and its equivalent in many languages is widely accepted today. -
See Exodus 6:3 and Isaiah 26:4 in the @{i}King James Version@{ui}.

                       @{b}WHY YOU SHOULD USE GOD'S NAME@{ub}

6 God's unique name, Jehovah, serves to differentiate him from other gods.
That is why that name appears so often in the Bible, especially in its
Hebrew text.  Many translators fail to use the divine name, but Psalm 83:18
clearly says:  "You whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over
all the Earth."  So it is appropriate for us to use God's personal name when
we speak of him.

7 The name of Jehovah is a form of Hebrew verb meaning "to become."  Thus,
God's name means "He Causes to Become."  Jehovah God thereby identifies
himself as the Great Purposer.  He always causes his purposes to become
reality.  Only the true God can rightly bear this name, for humans can never
be sure that their plans will succeed.  (James 4:13-14)  Jehovah alone can
say:  "So my Word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be...  It will
have certain success in that for which I have sent it." - Isaiah 55:11.

8 The Hebrew patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob each "called on the name
of Jehovah,"  but they did not know the full significance of the divine
name.  (Genesis 21:33;  26:35;  32:9;  Exodus 6:3)  When Jehovah later
revealed his purpose to deliver their descendants, the Israelites, from
slavery in Egypt and give them "a land flowing with milk and honey," this
may have seemed impossible.  (Exodus 3:17)  Nevertheless, God emphasized the
everlasting significance of his name by telling his prophet Moses:  "This is
what you are to say to the sons of Israel, `Jehovah the God of your
forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has
sent me to you.'  This is my name to time indefinite, and this is the
memorial of me to generation after generation." - Exodus 3:15.

9 Moses asked Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let the Israelites go to
worship Jehovah in the wilderness.  But Pharaoh, who himself was viewed as a
god and who worshiped other Egyptian gods, replied:  "Who is Jehovah, so
that I should obey his voice to send Israel away?  I do not know Jehovah at
all end, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away." - Exodus 5:1-2.

10 Jehovah then took progressive action to fulfill his purpose, acting in
harmony with the meaning of his name.  He brought ten plagues upon the
ancient Egyptians.  The last plague killed all of Egypt's firstborn,
including proud Pharaoh's son.  Then the Egyptians were eager for Israel to
go.  However, some Egyptians were so impressed by Jehovah's power that they
joined the Israelites in leaving Egypt.  - Exodus 12:35-38.

11 Stubborn Pharaoh and his army, with its 600 war chariots, set out to
recapture his slaves.  As the Egyptians drew near, God miraculously divided
the Red Sea so that the Israelites could cross on dry land.  When the
pursuers entered the seabed, Jehovah "kept taking wheels off their chariots
so that they were driving them with difficulty."  The Egyptian warriors
cried:  "Let us flee from any contact with Israel, because Jehovah certainly
fights for them against the Egyptians."  But it was too late.  The vast
walls of water crashed down and "covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen
belonging to all of Pharaoh's military forces."  (Exodus 14:22-25, 28)
Jehovah thus made a great name for himself, and that event has not been
forgotten to this day.  - Joshua 2:9-11.

12 The name that God has made for himself has great meaning for us today.
His name, Jehovah, stands as a guarantee that all he has purposed he will
cause to come true.  That includes accomplishing his original purpose that
our Earth will become a paradise.  (Genesis 1:28; 2:8)  To that end, God
will eliminate all opposers of his sovereignty today, for he has stated:
"They will have to know that I am Jehovah."  (Ezekiel 38:23)  Then God will
fulfill his promise to deliver his worshipers into a new world of
righteousness.  -  2 Peter 3:13.

13 All who want God's favor must learn to call upon his name in faith.  The
Bible promises:  "Everyone who calls upon the name of Jehovah will be
saved." (Romans 10:13)  Yes, the name Jehovah has rich meaning.  Calling
upon Jehovah as your God and Deliverer can lead you to endless happiness.

                        @{b}QUALITIES OF THE TRUE GOD@{ub}

14 A study of Israel's deliverance from Egypt highlights four basic
qualities that God possesses in perfect balance.  His dealings with Pharaoh
revealed his awesome @{i}power@{ui}.  (Exodus 9:16)  The masterful way God handled
the complex situation showed his matcheless @{i}wisdom@{ui}.  (Romans 11:33)  He
revealed his @{i}justice@{ui} in meting out punishment to stubborn opposers and
oppressors of his people.  (Deuteronomy 32:4)  A preeminent quality of God
is @{i}love@{ui}.  Jehovah showed outstanding love by fulfilling his promise
respecting Abraham's descendants.  (Deuteronomy 7:8)  He also showed love by
allowing some Egyptians to forsake false gods and benefit greatly by taking
their stand for the only true God.

15 As you read the Bible, you will notice that love is God's principle
attribute, and he demonstrates it in many ways.  For instance, it was out of
love that he became a Creator and first shared the joy of life with spirit
creatures.  Those hundreds of millions of angels love God and praise him.
(Job 38:4,7;  Daniel 7:10)  God also showed love in creating the earth and
preparing it for happy human existence. - Genesis 1:1, 26-28;  Psalm
115:16.

16 We benefit from God's love in ways too numerous to mention.  For one
thing, God has lovingly made our bodies in such a marvelous way that we can
enjoy life.  (Psalm 139:14)  His love is shown in that he provides "rains
from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling [our] hearts to the full with food
and good cheer."  (Acts 14:17)  God even "makes his sun rise upon wicked
people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous."
(Matthew 5:45)  Love also moves our Creator to help us gain the knowledge of
God and serve him happily as his worshipers.  Indeed, "God is love." (1 John
4:8) But there is much more to his personality.

                        @{b}"A GOD MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS"@{ub}

17 After the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, they still needed to know God
better.  Moses felt this need and prayed:  "If, please, I have found favor
in your eyes, make me know, please your ways, that I may know you, in order
that I may find favor in your eyes."  (Exodus 33:13)  Moses got to know God
better upon hearing God's own declaration:  "Jehovah, Jehovah, a God
merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and
truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and
transgression and sin, but by no means will he give exemption from
punishment."  (Exodus 34:6-7)  God balances his love with justice, not
shielding willful sinners from the consequences of their wrongdoing.

18 As Moses learned, Jehovah shows mercy.  A merciful person has pity on
those who suffer and tries to bring them relief.  Thus, God has shown
compassion for mankind by making provision for permanent relief from
suffering, sickness and death.  (Revelation 21:3-5)  Worshipers of God may
experience calmities because of conditions in this wicked world, or they may
act unwisely and meet up with trouble.  But if they humbly turn to Jehovah
for assistance, he will comfort and help them.  Why?  Because he mercifully
shows tender regard for his worshipers.  - Psalm 86:15;  1 Peter 5:6-7.

19 Many people in authority treat others harshly.  In contrast, how gracious
Jehovah is toward his humble servants!  Though he is the highest authority
in the universe, he shows outstanding kindness in a general way to all
mankind.  (Psalm 8:3-4;  Luke 6:35)  Jehovah is also gracious to
individuals, answering their specific plea for favor.  (Exodus 22:26-27;
Luke 18:13-14)  Of course, God is not obligated to show favor or mercy to
anyone.  (Exodus 33:19)  Therefore, we need to manifest deep appreciation
for God's mercy and graciousness. - Psalm 145:1,8.

                                 @{b}SLOW TO ANGER,@{ub}
                            @{b}IMPARTIAL, AND RIGHTEOUS@{ub}

20 Jehovah is slow to anger.  Yet, this does not mean that he does not take
action, for he did so in destroying stubborn Pharaoh and his army in the Red
Sea.  Jehovah is also impartial.  Hence, his favored people, the Israelites,
eventually lost his favor because of their persistent wrongdoing.  God
accepts as his worshipers people from all nations, but only those who
conform to his righteous ways. - Acts 10:34-35.

21 The Bible book of Revelation highlights the importance of learning about
God's "righteous decrees."  It tells us that heavenly creatures sing: "Great
and wonderful are your works, Jehovah God, the Almighty.  Righteous and true
are your ways, King of eternity.  Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and
glorify your name, because you alone are loyal?  For all the nations will
come and worship before you, because your righteous decrees have been made
manifest."  (Revelation 15:2-4)  We show wholesome fear of Jehovah, or
reverence for him, by conforming to what he says is right.  This is made
easier by reminding ourselves of God's wisdom and love.  All his commands
are for our good.  - Isaiah 48:17-18.

                            @{b}JEHOVAH OUR GOD IS ONE@{ub}

22 The ancient Egyptians worshiped many gods, but Jehovah is "a God exacting
exclusive devotion." (Exodus 20:5)  Moses reminded the Israelites that
"Jehovah our God is one Jehovah." (Deuteronomy 6:4)  Jesus Christ repeated
those words.  (Mark 12:28-29)  Therefore, those who accept the Bible as
God's Word do not worship a Trinity consisting of three persons or gods in
one.  In fact, the word "Trinity" does not even appear in the Bible.  The
true God is one Person, seperate from Jesus Christ.  (John 14:28; 1
Corinthians 15:28) God's holy spirit is not a person.  It is Jehovah's
active force, used by the Almighty to accomplish his purposes. - Genesis
1:2;  Acts 2:1-4,32,33;  2 Peter 1:20,21.

23 When you consider how wonderful Jehovah is, do you not agree that he
deserves your worship?  As you study his Word, the Bible, you will get to
know him better and will learn what he requires of you for your eternal
welfare and happiness.  (Matthew 5:3,6)  In addition, your love for God will
grow.  That is fitting, for Jesus said:  "You must love Jehovah your God
with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and
with your whole strength."  (Mark 12:30)  Obviously, Jesus had such love for
God.  But what does the Bible reveal about Jesus Christ?  What is his role
in Jehovah's purpose?

                                @{b}@{u}KNOWLEDGE OF GOD@{ub}@{uu}
          
1 YOU are standing at the door, fumbling with your keys.  It is cold and
dark, and you are eager to get inside - but the key does not work.  It looks
right, yet the lock will not budge.  How frustrating!  You look at your keys
again.  Are you using the right one?  Has someone damaged the key?

2 That is a fair picture of what this world's religious confusion has done
with the knowledge of God.  In effect, many have tampered with the key that
opens it up to our understanding - Jesus Christ.  Some religions have
removed the key, ignoring Jesus altogether.  Others have distorted Jesus'
role, worshipping him as Almighty God.  In any case, the knowledge of God is
closed to us without an accurate understanding of this principle figure,
Jesus Christ.

3 You may recall that Jesus said:  "This means everlasting life, their
taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent
forth, Jesus Christ."  (John 17:3)  In this, Jesus was not being boastful.
The Scriptures repeatedly emphasize the need for @{i}accurate@{ui} knowledge of
Christ.  (Ephesians 4:13;  Colossians 2:2;  2 Peter 1:8; 2:20)  "To [Jesus
Christ] all the prophets bear witness," noted the apostle Peter.  (Acts
10:43)  And the Apostle Paul also wrote: "Carefully concealed in [Jesus] are
all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge."  (Colossians 2:3)  Paul even
said that all of Jehovah's promises come true because of Jesus. (2
Corinthians 1:20)  So Jesus Christ is the very key to the knowledge of God.
Our knowledge of Jesus must be free of any distortions as to his nature and
as to his role in God's arrangement.  But why to Jesus' followers consider
him to be central to God's purposes?

                             @{b}THE PROMISED MESSIAH@{ub}

4 From the days of the faithful man Abel, God's servants had eagerly looked
forward to the Seed foretold by Jehovah God himself.  (Genesis 3:15; 4:1-8;
Hebrews 11:4)  It had been revealed that the Seed would serve God's purpose
as the Messiah, meaning "Annointed One."  He would "finish off sin," and the
glories of his Kingdom were foretold in the psalms.  (Daniel 9:24-26;  Psalm
72:1-20)  Who would prove to be the Messiah?

5 Imagine the excitement felt by a young Jew named Andrew when he listened
to the words of Jesus of Nazareth.  Andrew rushed to his brother Simon Peter
and told him:  "We have found the Messiah."  (John 1:41)  Jesus' disciples
were convinced that he was the promised Messiah.  (Matthew 16:16)  And true
Christians have been willing to stake their lives on the belief that Jesus
was indeed the foretold Messiah, or Christ.  What proof have they had?  Let
us consider three lines of evidence.

                     @{b}EVIDENCE THAT JESUS WAS THE MESSIAH@{ub}

6 @{i}Jesus' lineage@{ui} lays the first basis for identifing him as the promised
Messiah.  Jehovah had told His servant Abraham that the promised Seed would
come from his family.  Abraham's son Isaac, Isaac's son Jacob, and Jacob's
son Judah each received a similar promise.  (Genesis 22:18; 26:2-5;
28:12-15; 49:10)  The line of the Messiah's descent was narrowed down
centuries later when King David was told that his family line would produce
this One.  (Psalm 132:11;  Isaiah 11:1,10)  The Gospel accounts of Matthew
and Luke confirm that Jesus came through that family line.  (Matthew 1:1-16;
Luke 3:23-38)  Though Jesus had many bitter enemies, none of them challenged
his well-publicized line of descent.  (Matthew 21:9, 15)  Clearly, then, his
lineage is beyond question.  However, the Jews' family records were
destroyed when the Romans sacked Jerusalem in 70 @{"C.E." alink "CE"}  In later times, no
one could ever prove claim to be the promised Messiah.

7 @{i}Fulfilled prophecy@{ui} is a second line of evidence.  Scores of Hebrew
Scripture prophecies describe various aspects of the Messiah's life course.
In the eighth century @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}, the prophet Micah foretold that this great
ruler would be born in the insignificant town of Bethlehem Ephrathah, where
King David had been born.  (Micah 5:2)  Jesus' parents, Joseph and Mary,
lived in Nazareth, some 90 miles north of Bethlehem.  While Mary was
pregnant, however, the Roman ruler Caesar Augustus ordered all the people to
register in their home cities.@{" * " alink "Registration"}  So Joseph had to take his pregnant wife
to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. - Luke 2:1-7.

8 In the sixth century @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}, the prophet Daniel foretold that "Messiah the
Leader" would appear 69 @{"`weeks'" alink "Weeks"} after the order went forth to restore and
rebuild Jerusalem.  (Daniel 9:24, 25)  Each one of these @{"`weeks'" alink "Weeks"} was seven
years long.@{" * " alink "Weeks"}  According to the Bible and secular history, the order to
rebuild Jerusalem was issued in 455 @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"} (Nehemiah 2:1-8)  So the Messiah
was to appear 483 (69 times 7) years after 455 @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}  That brings us to 29
@{"C.E." alink "CE"}, the very year that Jehovah annointed Jesus with holy spirit.  Jesus
thus became "the Christ" (meaning "Annointed One"), or Messiah. - Luke 3:15,
16, 21, 22.

9 Of course, not everyone accepted Jesus as the promised Messiah, and the
Scriptures had foretold this.  As recorded at Psalm 2:2, King David was
divinely inspired to foretell:  "The kings of the earth take their stand and
high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and
against his annointed one."  This prophecy suggested that leaders from more
than one land would unite in order to attack Jehovah's Annointed One, or
Messiah.  And so it was.  The Jewish religious leaders, King Herod, and the
Roman governor Pontius Pilate all played a part in having Jesus put to
death.  Former enemies Herod and Pilate became fast friends from then on.
(Matthew 27:1, 2;  Luke 23:10-12;  Acts 4:25-28)  For further proof that
Jesus was the Messiah, please see the accompanying chart entitled
@{"`Some Outstanding Messianic Prophecies'" link "MessianicProphecies"}

10 @{i}The testimony of Jehovah God@{ui} is a third line of evidence supporting
Jesus' Messiahship.  Jehovah sent angels to let people know that Jesus was
the promised Messiah.  (Luke 2:10-14)  In fact, during Jesus' earthly life,
Jehovah himself spoke from heaven, expressing his approval of Jesus.
(Matthew 3:16, 17;  17:1-5)  Jehovah God gave Jesus the power to perform
miracles.  Each one of these was further divine proof that Jesus was the
Messiah, for God would never give a fraud power to perform miracles. Jehovah
also used his holy spirit to inspire the Gospel accounts, so that the
evidence of Jesus' Messiahship became part of the Bible, the most widely
translated and distributed book in history. - John 4:25, 26.

11 In all, these categories of evidence include hundreds of facts that
identify Jesus as the promised Messiah.  Clearly, then, true Christians have
rightly viewed him as `the one to whom all the prophets bore witness' and
the key to the knowledge of God.  (Acts 10:43)  But there is more to learn
about Jesus Christ than the fact that he was the Messiah.  Where did he
originate?  What was he like?

                           @{b}JESUS' PREHUMAN EXISTENCE@{ub}

12 Jesus' life course might be divided into three stages.  The first began
long before he was born on the earth.  Micah 5:2 said that the Messiah's
origin was "from early times, from the days of time indefinite."  And Jesus
plainly said that he had come from "the realms above," that is, from heaven.
(John 8:23;  16:28)  How long had he existed in heaven before coming to the
earth?

13 Jesus was called God's "only-begotten Son" because Jehovah created him
directly.  (John 3:16)  As "the first-born of all creation,"  Jesus was then
used by God to create all other things.  (Colossians 1:15;  Revelation 3:14)
John 1:1 says that "the Word" (Jesus in his prehuman existence) was with God
"in the beginning."  So the Word was with Jehovah when "the heavens and the
earth" were created.  God was addressing the Word when He said:  "Let us
make man in our image." (Genesis 1:1, 26)  Likewise, the Word must have been
God's beloved "master worker," described at Proverbs 8:22-31 as wisdom
personified, laboring at Jehovah's side in the making of all things.  After
Jehovah brought him into existence, the Word spent ages with God in heaven
before becoming a man on earth.

14 No wonder Colossians 1:15 calls Jesus "the image of the invisible God"!
Through untold years of close association, the obedient Son came to be just
like his Father, Jehovah.  This is another reson why Jesus is the key to the
life-giving knowledge of God.  Everything Jesus did while on earth is
exactly what Jehovah would have done.  Hence, getting to know Jesus also
means increasing our knowledge of Jehovah.  (John 8:28;  14:8-10)  Clearly,
then, it is vital to learn more about Jesus Christ.

                         @{b}JESUS' LIFE COURSE ON EARTH@{ub}

15 The second stage of Jesus' life course was here on earth.  He willingly
submitted as God transferred his life from heaven to the womb of a faithful
Jewish virgin named Mary.  Jehovah's powerful holy spirit, or active force,
`overshadowed' Mary, causing her to become pregnant and eventually gave
birth to a perfect baby.  (Luke 1:34, 35) Jesus inherited no imperfection,
since his life came from a perfect Source.  He was reared in a humble home
as the adopted son of the carpenter Joseph and was the first of several
children in the family. - Isaiah 7:14;  Matthew 1:22, 23;  Mark 6:3.

16 Jesus' deep devotion to Jehovah God was already evident when he was 12
years old.  (Luke 2:41-49)  After growing up and embarking on his ministry
at the age of 30, Jesus demonstrated his profound love for his fellow
humans.  When God's holy spirit empowered him to perform miracles, he
compassionately healed the sick, the lame, the maimed, the blind, the deaf,
the leprous.  (Matthew 8:2-4;  15:30)  Jesus fed hungry thousands.  (Matthew
15:35-38)  He calmed a storm that threatened the safety of his friends.
(Mark 4:37-39)  In fact, he even resurrected the dead.  (John 11:43, 44)
These miracles are well-established facts of history.  Even Jesus' enemies
acknowledged that he `performed many signs.' - John 11:47, 48.

17 Jesus traveled throughout his homeland, teaching people about God's
Kingdom.  (Matthew 4:17)  He also set a sterling example of patience and
reasonableness.  Even when his disciples failed him, he sympathetically
remarked:  "The spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak."  (Mark
14:37, 38)  Yet, Jesus was courageous and forthright with those who despised
the truth and opressed the helpless.  (Matthew 23:27-33)  Above all, he
perfectly imitated his Father's example of love.  Jesus was even willing to
die so that imperfect mankind would have a hope for the future.  No wonder,
then, that we may well refer to Jesus as the key to the knowledge of God!
Yes, he is the @{i}living@{ui} key!  But why do we say a @{i}living@{ui} key?  This brings us
to the third stage of his life course.

                                @{b}JESUS TODAY@{ub}

18 Though the Bible reports on Jesus' death, he is now alive!  In fact,
hundreds of people living in the first century @{"C.E." alink "CE"} were eyewitnesses of the
fact that he had been resurrected.  (1 Corinthians 15:3-8)  As prophesied,
he thereafter sat at his Father's right hand and waited to receive kingly
power in heaven.  (Psalm 110:1;  Hebrews 10:12,13)  So how should we
envision Jesus today?  Should we think of him as a helpless baby in a
manger?  Or as a suffering man being put to death?  No.  He is a mighty,
reigning King!  And very soon now, he will manifest his rulership over our
troubled earth.

19 At Revelation 19:11-15, the King Jesus Christ is vividly described as
coming with great power to destroy the wicked.  How eager this loving
heavenly Ruler must be to end the suffering that afflicts millions today!
And he is just as eager to help those striving to imitate the perfect
example he set while on earth.  (1 Peter 2:21)  He wants to preserve them
through the rapidly approaching "war of the great day of God the Almighty,"
often called Armageddon, so that they can live forever as earthly subjects
of God's heavenly Kingdom. - Revelation 7:9, 14;  16:14, 16.

20 During Jesus' foretold Thousand Year Reign of peace, he will perform
miracles in behalf of all mankind.  (Isaiah 9:6, 7;  11:1-10;  Revelation
20:6)  Jesus will cure all sickness and will bring an end to death.  He will
resurrect billions so that they too may have an opportunity to live forever
on earth.  (John 5:28, 29)  You will be thrilled to learn more about this
Messianic Kingdom in a @{"later chapter" link "Chapter10"}.  Be assured of this:  We cannot even
imagine how wonderful our lives will be under Kingdom rule.  How important
it is to become better acquainted with Jesus Christ!  Yes, it is essential
that we never lose sight of Jesus, the living key to the knowledge of God
that leads to everlasting life.

@node "Chapter5" "Whose Worship Does God Accept?"
                  
                                 @{b}@{u}WHOSE WORSHIP@{ub}@{uu}
                                @{b}@{u}DOES GOD ACCEPT?@{ub}@{uu}

1 HAVE you ever wondered, `Whose worship does God accept?'  A certain woman
may have had such a question come to her mind when she spoke with Jesus
Christ near Mount Gerizim in Samaria.  Calling attention to a difference
between the worship of the Samaritans and that of the Jews, she said:  "Our
forefathers worshiped in this mountain;  but you people say that in
Jerusalem is the place where persons ought to worship."  (John 4:20)  Did
Jesus tell the Samaritan woman that God accepts all worship?  Or did he say
that specific things are required to please God?

2 Jesus' startling reply was:  "The hour is coming when neither in this
mountain nor in Jerusalem will you people worship the Father."  (John 4:21)
The Samaritans had long feared Jehovah and had worshiped other gods on Mount
Gerizim.  (2 Kings 17:33)  Now Jesus Christ said that neither that place nor
Jerusalem would be important in true worship.

                         @{b}WORSHIP WITH SPIRIT AND TRUTH@{ub}

3 Jesus went on to tell the Samaritan woman:  "You worship what you do not
know;  we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews."
(John 4:22)  The Samaritans had false religious ideas and accepted only the
first five books of the Bible as inspired - and these solely in their own
recension known as the Samaritan Pentateuch.  Therefore, they did not really
know God.  However, the Jews had been entrusted with Scriptural knowledge.
(Romans 3:1,2)  The Scriptures gave faithful Jews and any others who would
listen what they needed in order to know God.

4 Actually, Jesus showed that both Jews and Samaritans would have to adjust
their way of worship so as to please God.  He said:  "The hour is coming,
and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit
and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship
him.  God is a Spirit, and those worshipping him must worship with spirit
and truth."  (John 4:23,24)  We need to worship God "with spirit," motivated
by hearts full of faith and love.  It is possible to worship God `with
truth' by studying his Word, the Bible, and by worshiping him according to
his revealed truth.  Are you eager to do that?

5 Jesus emphasized that God wants @{i}true@{ui} worship.  This shows that there are
forms of worship unacceptable to Jehovah.  To worship God means to give him
reverent honor and to render sacred service to him.  If you wanted to show
honor to a powerful ruler, likely you would be eager to serve him and do
what would please him.  Surely, then, we want to please God.  Rather than
merely say, `My religion suits me,' we therefore need to make sure that our
worship meets God's requirements.

                          @{b}DOING THE WILL OF THE FATHER@{ub}

6 Let us read Matthew 7:21-23 and see if we can isolate a crucial factor
that determines whether all worship is acceptable to God.  Jesus said:  "Not
everyone saying to me, `Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of the
heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.
Many will say to me in that day, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your
name, and expel demons [wicked spirit creatures] in your name, and perform
many powerful works in you name?'  And yet then I will confess to them:  I
never knew you!  Get away from me you workers of lawlessness."

7 Acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord is essential in true worship.  But
something would be missing in the worship of many of those claiming to be
Jesus' desciples.  He said that some would perform "powerful works," such as
supposed miraculous healings.  However, they would fail to do what Jesus
said is vital.  They would not be "doing the will of [his] Father."  If we
want to please God, we must learn what the will of the Father is and then do
it.

                      @{b}ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE - A PROTECTION@{ub}

8 Doing God's will requires an accurate knowledge of both Jehovah God and
Jesus Christ.  Such knowledge leads to everlasting life.  Surely, then, all
of us will want to take seriously the matter of gaining accurate knowledge
from God's Word, the Bible.  Some say that there is no need for concern as
long as we are sincere and zealous in our worship.  Others claim:  `The less
you know, the less is expected of you.'  Yet, the Bible encourages us to
increase in the knowledge of God and his purposes.
 - Ephesians 4:13;  Philippians 1:9;  Colossians 1:9.

9 Such knowledge is a protection against contamination of our worship.  The
apostle Paul spoke of a certain spirit creature who pretends to be "an angel
of light."  (2 Corinthians 11:14)  Thus, disguised, this spirit creature-
Satan- tries to mislead us into doing things contrary to God's will.  Other
spirit creatures associated with Satan have also been polluting people's
worship, for Paul said:  "The things which the nations sacrifice they
sacrifice to demons, and not to God."  (1 Corinthians 10:20)  Likely, many
have thought they were worshiping in the right way, although they were not
doing what God wanted.  They were being misled into unclean false worship.
We will learn more about Satan and the demons later, but these enemies of
God have definitely been polluting mankind's worship.

10 If you knew that someone had deliberately poisoned your water supply,
would you go on drinking from it?  Surely, you would take immediate action
to find a source of safe, pure water.  Well, an accurate knowledge of God's
Word equips us to identify true religion and to reject impurities that make
worship unacceptable to God.

                         @{b}COMMANDS OF MEN AS DOCTRINES@{ub}

11 When Jesus was on earth, many Jews did not act in accord with accurate
knowledge of God.  They therefore lost the opportunity to have a clean
standing before Jehovah.  Concerning them, Paul wrote:  "I bear them witness
that they have a zeal for God;  but not according to accurate knowledge."
(Romans 10:2)  They decided for themselves how to worship God instead of
listening to what he said.

12 The Israelites originally practiced God-given pure religion, but it
became contaminated with teachings and philosophies of men. (Jeremiah 8:8,9;
Malachi 2:8,9;  Luke 11:52)  Although the Jewish religious leaders known as
the Pharisees @{i}thought@{ui} their worship was acceptable to God, Jesus told them:
"Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written, `This
people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.
It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, because they teach as the
doctrines commands of men.'" - Mark 7:6,7.

13 Is it possible that we might do as the Pharisees did?  This could happen
if we followed religious traditions handed down to us instead of examining
what God has said about worship.  Warning of this very real danger, Paul
wrote:  "The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of
time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading
inspired utterences and teachings of demons."  (1 Timothy 4:1)  So it is not
enough merely to assume that our worship pleases God.  Like the Samaritan
woman who met Jesus, we may have inherited our way of worship from our
parents.  But we need to be certain that we are doing things that meet with
God's approval.

                          @{b}GUARD AGAINST OFFENDING GOD@{ub}

14 Unless we are careful, we may do something unacceptable to God.  For
example, the apostle John fell at the feet of an angel "to worship him." But
the angel warned:  "Be careful!  Do not do that!  All I am is a fellow slave
of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing to Jesus.
Worship God."  (Revelation 19:10)  Do you therefore see the need to make
sure that your worship is not contaminated by any kind of idolatry? - 1
Corinthians 10:14.

15 When some Christians began to practice religious customs that did not
please God, Paul asked:  "How is it that you are turning back again to the
weak and beggarly elementary things and want to slave for them over again?
You are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years.  I
fear for you, that somehow I have toiled to no purpose respecting you."
(Galatians 4:8-11)  Those individuals had gained a knowledge of God but
later erred by observing religious customs and holy days that were
unacceptable to Jehovah.  As Paul said, we need to "keep on making sure of
what is acceptable to the Lord." - Ephesians 5:10.

16 We must make sure that we avoid religious holidays and other customs that
violate God's principles.  (1 Thessalonians 5:21)  For instance, Jesus said
of his followers:  "They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of
the world."  (John 17:6)  Is your religion involved in ceremonies and
holidays that violate the principle of neutrality toward this world's
affairs?  Or do adherents of your religion sometimes share in customs and
festivals that may involve conduct matching that described by the apostle
Peter?  He wrote:  "The time that has passed by is sufficient for you to
have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of loose
conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and illegal
idolatries." - 1 Peter 4:3.

17 The apostle John emphasized the need to avoid any practices that reflect
the spirit of the ungodly world around us.  John wrote:  "Do not be loving
either the world or the things in the world.  If anyone loves the world, the
love of the Father is not in him;  because everything in the world - the
desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of
one's meanss of life - does not originate with the Father, but originates
with the world.  Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its
desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever."  (1 John 2:15-17)
Did you notice that those who `do the will of God' will remain forever? Yes,
if we do God's will and avoid activities that reflect this world's spirit,
we can have the hope of everlasting life!

                           @{b}KEEP GOD'S HIGH STANDARDS@{ub}

18 God wants as his worshipers those who comply with his high moral
standards.  Some in ancient Corinth mistakenly thought that God would
tolerate immoral behavior.  We can see how wrong they were by reading 1
Corinthians 6:9,10.  If we are to worship God acceptably, we must please him
in word and deed.  Is your form of worship enabling you to do that? -
Matthew 15:8;  23:1-3.

19 Our dealings with other people should also reflect God's standards. Jesus
Christ encouraged us to treat others as we would like to have them treat us,
for this is part of true worship.  (Matthew 7:12)  Note what he also said
about displaying brotherly love:  "By this all will know that you are my
disciples, if you have love among yourselves."  (John 13:35)  Jesus'
disciples must love one another and do what is good toward fellow worshipers
and others. - Galatians 6:10.

                           @{b}WHOLE - SOULED WORSHIP@{ub}

20 In your heart, you may want to worship God acceptably.  If so, you must
have Jehovah's view of worship.  The disciple James emphasized that it is
God's viewpoint that is important, not ours.  James said:  "The form of
worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and
Father is this:  to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and
to keep oneself without spot from the world."  (James 1:27)  With a desire
to please God, each of us needs to examine our worship to make sure that it
is not contaminated with ungodly practices or that we are not omitting
something that he considers vital. - James 1:26.

21 Only clean, whole-souled worship pleases Jehovah.  (Matthew 22:37;
Colossians 3:23)  When the nation of Israel gave God less than that, he
said:  "A son, for his part, honors a father;  and a servant, his grand
master.  So if I am a father, where is the honor to me?  And if I am a grand
master, where is the fear of me?"  They were offending God by offering him
blind, lame, and sick animals in sacrifice, and he rejected such acts of
worship.  (Malachi 1:6-8)  Jehovah is worthy of the purest form of worship
and accepts nothing less than exclusive devotion. - Exodus 20:5;  Proverbs
3:9;  Revelation 4:11.

22 The Samaritan woman who spoke with Jesus was seemingly interested in
worshiping God in the divinely approved way.  If that is our desire, we will
avoid all contaminating teachings and practices.  (2 Corinthians 6:14-18)
Instead, we will exert ourselves to get an accurate knowledge of God and to
do his will.  We will adhere closely to his requirements for acceptable
worship.  (1 Timothy 2:3,4)  Jehovah's Witnesses are striving to do just
that, and they warmly urge you to share with them in worshiping God "with
spirit and truth." (John 4:24)  Jesus said:  "The Father is looking for
suchlike ones to worship him."  (John 4:23)  It is hoped that you are such a
person.  Like that Samaritan woman, undoubtedly you would like to have
everlasting life.  (John 4:13-15)  But you see people grow old and die.  The

                               @{b}@{u}GROW OLD AND DIE?@{ub}@{uu}

1 SCIENTISTS do not know why humans grow old and die.  It seems that our
cells should keep on being renewed and that we should live forever.  The
book @{i}Hyojun Soshikigaku@{ui} (Standard Histology) says:  "It is a great mystery
how the aging and death of an individual."  Many scientists believe that
there is a "natural, inherent" limit to life.  Do you think they are right?

2 Humans have always yearned for longevity and have even tried to attain
immortality.  Since the fourth century @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}, drugs supposedly designed to
make immortality possible attracted the attention of Chinese nobles. Some
later Chinese emperors tried so called elixirs of life - made from mercury -
and died!  Around the globe, people believe that death is not the end of
their existence.  Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and others all have bright
hopes of a life after death.  In Christendom, many envisage an afterlife of
heavenly bliss.

3 Concepts of happiness after death reflect a longing for eternal life.
"Even time indefinite he has put in their heart," says the Bible concerning
the idea of eternity that God implanted in us.  (Ecclesiastes 3:11)  He
created the first humans with the prospect that they could live forever on
earth.  (Genesis 2:16, 17)  Why, then, do humans die?  How was death
introduced into the world?  The knowledge of God sheds light on these
questions. - Psalm 119:105.

                             @{b}A SINISTER PLOT@{ub}

4 A criminal tries to cover his tracks.  This has also been true of the one
responsible for a crime that has resulted in the death of billions.  He has
maneuvered things to shroud human death in mystery.  Jesus Christ identified
this criminal when He told those seeking to hill Him:  "You are from your
father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father.  That one
was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth,
because truth is not in him." - John 8:31, 40, 44.

5 Yes, the Devil is a malicious "manslayer."  The Bible reveals that he is a
real person, not just the evil in someone's heart.  (Matthew 4:1-11)
Although created as a righteous angel, "he did not stand fast in the truth."
How fitting it is that he is named Satan the Devil!  (Revelation 12:9) He is
called "Satan," or "resister," because he has opposed and resisted Jehovah.
This criminal is also called "Devil," meaning "slanderer," for he has
blasphemously misrepresented God.

6 What motivated Satan to rebel against God?  Greed.  He greedily coveted
the worship Jehovah received from humans.  The Devil did not reject the
desire to receive such worship, which rightly belonged only to the Creator.
(Compare Ezekiel 28:12-19.)  Instead, the angel who became Satan nurtured
this greedy desire until it became fertile and gave birth to sin. - James
1:14, 15.

7 We have identified the culprit whose criminal act has led to the death of
humans.  But what is the specific cause of human death?  The Bible says:
"The sting producing death is sin."  (1 Corinthians 15:56)  And what is sin?
To understand this word, let us consider the meaning it carried in the
original languages of the Bible.  The Hebrew and Greek verbs commonly
translated "to sin" mean "to miss" in the sense of missing a mark or not
reaching a goal.  What mark do all of us miss?  The mark of perfect
obedience to God.  How, though, was sin introduced into the world?

                       @{b}HOW THE PLOT WAS CARRIED OUT@{ub}

8 Satan carefully laid out a plot that he thought would lead to his ruling
all humans and receiving their worship.  He decided to induce the first
human couple, Adam and Eve, to sin against God.  Jehovah had given our first
parents knowledge that would have led to life everlasting.  They knew that
their Creator was good because he had placed them in the beautiful garden of
Eden.  Adam especially felt the goodness of his heavenly Father when God
gave him a beautiful and helpful wife.  (Genesis 1:26, 29;  2:7-9, 18-23)
The continued life of the first human pair depended on obedience to God.

9 God commanded Adam:  "From every tree of the garden you may eat to
satisfaction.  But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must
not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die."
(Genesis 2:16, 17)  As the Creator, Jehovah God had the right to set moral
standards and to define what was good and what was bad for his creatures.
His command was reasonable because Adam and Eve were free to eat fruit from
all the other trees in the garden.  They could show their appreciation for
Jehovah's rightful rulership by obeying this law instead of proudly setting
their own moral standards.

10 The Devil schemed to draw the first humans away from God.  To lure them
into taking his side, Satan lied.  Using a serpent, much as a ventriloquist
uses a dummy, the Devil asked Eve:  "Is it really so that God said you must
not eat from every tree of the garden?"  When Eve cited God's command, Satan
declared:  "You positively will not die."  He then imputed bad motives to
Jehovah by saying:  "God knows that in the very day of your eating from it
your eyes are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad."  (Genesis 3:1-5)
The Devil thus suggested that God was withholding something good.  What a
slanderous assault on the truthful, loving heavenly Father, Jehovah!

11 Eve looked at the tree again, and its fruit now seemed especially
desirable.  So she took the fruit and ate it.  Later, her husband willfully
joined her in this sinful act of disobedience to God.  (Genesis 3:6)
Although Eve was deceived, both she and Adam supported Satan's scheme to
rule the human race.  In effect, they became his accomplices. - Romans 6:16;
1 Timothy 2:14.

12 Adam and Eve had to face the consequences of their actions.  They did not
become like God, with special knowledge.  Instead, they felt ashamed and hid
themselves.  Jehovah called Adam to account and pronounced this sentence:
"In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the
ground, for out of it you were taken.  For dust you are and to dust you will
return."  (Genesis 3:19)  "In the day" that our first parents ate from the
tree of knowledge of good and bad, they were sentenced by God and died from
his standpoint.  Then they were expelled from Paradise and began their
descent into physical death.

                           @{b}HOW SIN AND DEATH SPREAD@{ub}

13 Satan had apparently succeeded in his scheme to receive human veneration.
Yet, he could not keep his worshipers alive.  When sin started to work in
the first human couple, they could no longer pass on perfection to their
offspring.  Like an inscription carved in stone, sin was deeply engraved
into the genes of our first parents.  Thus, they could produce only
imperfect offspring.  Since all their children were conceived after Adam and
Eve sinned, their offspring inherited sin and death. - Psalm 51:5;  Romans
5:12.

14 Today, however, many do not think that they are sinners.  In some parts
of the world, the concept of inherited sin is generally unknown.  But that
is no proof that sin does not exist.  A boy with a dirty face may claim that
he is clean, and may be convinced otherwise only after he looks into a
mirror.  The ancient Israelites were like such a boy when they received
God's Law through His prophet Moses.  The Law made it plain that sin
existed.  "Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for
the Law," explains the apostle Paul.  (Romans 7:7-12)  Like the boy looking
into a mirror, by using the Law to look at themselves, the Israelites could
see that they were unclean in Jehovah's eyes.

15 By looking into the mirror of God's Word and noting it's standards, we
can see that we are imperfect.  (James 1:23-25)  For example, consider what
Jesus Christ told his disciples about loving God and their neighbor, as
recorded at Matthew 22:37-40.  How often humans miss the mark in these
areas!  Many do not feel even a twinge of conscience over failing to show
love for God or for their neighbors. - Luke 10:29-37.

                          @{b}BEWARE OF SATAN'S TACTICS!@{ub}

16 Satan seeks to cause us to practice sin willfully.  (1 John 3:8)  Is
there any way to avoid being a victim of his schemes?  Yes, but this
requires that we fight inclination toward willful sin.  This is not easy
because our inborn tendency to sin is very strong.  (Ephesians 2:3)  Paul
had to put up a real struggle.  Why?  Because sin resided in him.  If we
want God's approval, we too must fight the sinful tendencies within us. -
Romans 7:14-24;  2 Corinthians 5:10.

17 Since Satan constantly looks for opportunities to lure us into breaking
God's laws, our fight against sin is not easy.  (1 Peter 5:8)  Showing
concern for fellow Christians, Paul said:  "I am afraid that somehow, as the
serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, your minds might be corrupted away from
the sincerity and the chastity that are due to the Christ."  (2 Corinthians
11:3)  Satan uses similar tactics today.  He tries to sow seeds of doubt
about Jehovah's goodness and the benefits of obeying God's commands.  The
Devil tries to take advantage of our inherited sinful tendencies and have us
pursue a course of pride, greed, hatred and prejustice.

18 One of the devices that the Devil uses against us is the world, which is
lying in his power.  (1 John 5:19)  If we are not careful, corrupt and
dishonest people in the world around us will pressure us into a sinful
course that violates God's moral standards.  (1 Peter 4:3-5)  Many ignore
God's laws and even brush aside the proddings of their conscience,
eventually rendering it insensitive.  (Romans 2:14, 15;  1 Timothy 4:1,2)
Some gradually adopt a course that even their imperfect conscience formerly
did not permit them to take. - Romans 1:24-32;  Ephesians 4:17-19.

19 Living a clean life is an achievement in this world.  To please our
Creator, however, more is required.  We must also have faith in God and feel
a responsibility toward him.  (Hebrews 11:6)  "If one knows how to do what
is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him," wrote the disciple
James.  (James 4:17)  Yes, deliberately ignoring God and his commandments is
itself a form of sin.

20 Satan is very likely to stimulate opposition to your pursuit of the
knowledge of God through your study of the Bible.  It is sincerely hoped
that you will not let such pressures prevent you from practicing what is
right.  (John 16:2)  Though many rulers put faith in Jesus during his
ministry, they did not confess him because they were fearful of being
shunned in their community.  (John 12:42, 43)  Satan ruthlessly tries to
intimidate anyone seeking the knowledge of God.  However, you should always
remember and appreciate the wonderful things Jehovah has done.  You may even
be able to help opposers to gain the same appreciation.

21 As long as we are imperfect, we will sin.  (1 John 1:8)  Nevertheless, we
have help in fighting this battle.  Yes, it is possible to come off
victorious in our fight against the wicked one, Satan the Devil.  (Romans
5:21)  At the end of Jesus' ministry on earth, he encouraged his followers
with these words:  "In the world you are having tribulation, but take
courage!  I have conquered the world."  (John 16:33)  Even for imperfect
humans, it is possible to conquer the world with God's help.  Satan has no
hold on those who oppose him and `subject themselves to God.'  (James 4:7; 1
John 5:18)  As we shall see, God has provided a way out of bondage to sin
and death.

                               @{b}@{u}TO SAVE MANKIND@{ub}@{uu}

1 ONE spring afternoon nearly 2,000 years ago, a Roman centurion watched
three men die slow, agonizing deaths.  That soldier especially noted one
of them - Jesus Christ.  Jesus had been nailed to a wooden stake.  The
midday sky blackened as the moment of his death approached.  When he died,
the earth shook violently, and the soldier exclaimed: "Certainly this man
was God's Son." - Mark 15:39.

2 God's Son!  That soldier was right.  He had just witnessed the most
important event ever to occur on the earth.  On earlier occasions, God
himself had called Jesus his beloved Son.  (Matthew 3:17; 17:5)  Why had
Jehovah allowed his Son to die?  Because this was God's means of saving
mankind from sin and death.

                          @{b}CHOSEN FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE@{ub}

3 As we have previously learned in this book, Jesus had a prehuman
existence.  He is called God's "only-begotten Son" because Jehovah created
him directly.  God thereafter used Jesus to bring all other things into
existence.  (John 3:18; Colossians 1:16)  Jesus was especially fond of
humankind.  (Proverbs 8:30, 31)  No wonder Jehovah chose his only-begotten
Son to serve a special purpose when mankind came under the condemnation of
death!

4 When pronouncing sentence on Adam, Eve, and Satan in the garden of Eden,
God spoke of the future Rescuer as a "seed."  This Seed, or offspring,
would come to undo the terrible ills that Satan the Devil, "the original
Serpent," had brought about.  In fact, the promised Seed would crush Satan
and all those who followed him. - Genesis 3:15; 1 John 3:8; Revelation 12:9.

5 Over the centuries, God gradually revealed more about the Seed, also
called the Messiah.  As shown in @{"the chart" link "MessianicProphecies"}, numerous prophecies give details
about many aspects of his life on earth.  For instance, he was to endure
terrible mistreatment in order to fulfill his role in God's purpose. -
Isaiah 53:3-5.

                          @{b}WHY THE MESSIAH WOULD DIE@{ub}

6 The prophecy recorded at Daniel 9:24-26 foretold that the Messiah - God's
Annointed One - would fulfill a great purpose.  He would come to earth "to
terminate the transgression, and to finish off sin, and to make atonement
for error, and to bring in righteousness" forever.  The Messiah would remove
the condemnation of death from faithful mankind.  But how would he do this?
The prophecy explains that he would be "cut off," or put to death.

7 The ancient Israelites were familiar with the idea of atonement for error.
In their worship under the Law that God have them through Moses, they
regularly offered up animal sacrifices.  These reminded the people of Israel
that humans need something to atone for, or cover, their sins.  The apostle
Paul summarized the principle in this way:  "Unless blood is poured out no
forgiveness takes place."  (Hebrews 9:22)  Christians are not under the
Mosaic Law with its requirements such as sacrifices.  (Romans 10:4; 
Colossians 2:16, 17)  They also know that animal sacrifices cannot provide
permanent and complete forgiveness of sins.  Instead, these sacraficial
offerings foreshadowed a far more valuable sacrifice - that of the Messiah,
or Christ.  (Hebrews 10:4, 10;  compare Galatians 3:24.)  Yet, you may ask,
`Was it really necessary for the Messiah to die?'

8 Yes, the Messiah had to die if mankind was to be saved.  To understand
why, we must think back to the garden of Eden and try to grasp the enormity
of what Adam and Eve lost when they rebelled against God.  Eternal life had
been set before them!  As children of God, they also enjoyed a direct
relationship with him.  But when they rejected Jehovah's rulership they lost
all of that and brought sin and death upon the human race. - Romans 5:12.

9 It was as though our first parents had squandered a vast fortune, plunging
themselves into a pit of debt.  Adam and Eve passed on that debt on to their
offspring.  Because we were not born perfect and sinless, every one of us
is sinful and dying.  When we get sick or say something hurtful that we
wish we could take back, we are experiencing the effects of our inherited
debt - human imperfection.  (Romans 7:21-25)  Our only hope lies in
regaining what Adam lost.  However, we cannot earn perfect human life. 
Since all imperfect humans commit sin, all of us earn death, not life. -
Romans 6:23.

10 Yet, could something be offered in exchange for the life that Adam
forfeited?  God's standard of justice demands balance, "soul for soul."
(Exodus 21:23)  So a life had to be offered to pay for the life that was
lost.  Not just any life would suffice.  Psalm 49:7,8 says of imperfect
humans:  "Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor
give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so
precious that it has ceased to time indefinite)."  Is the situation
therefore hopeless?  No, indeed.

11 In the Hebrew language, the word "ransom" signifies the sum paid to
redeem a captive and also denotes @{i}equivalency@{ui}.  Only a man with perfect
human life could offer up the equivalent of what Adam lost.  After Adam,
the only perfect man born on earth was Jesus Christ.  Hence, the Bible calls
Jesus "the last Adam" and assures us that Christ "gave himself a
corresponding ransom for all."  (1 Corinthians 15:45;  1 Timothy 2:5,6) 
Whereas Adam passed death on to his children, Jesus' legacy if life eternal.
First Corinthians 15:22 explains:  "Just as in Adam all are dying, so also
in the Christ all will be made alive."  Apropriately, then, Jesus is called
"Eternal Father." - Isaiah 9:6,7.

                            @{b}HOW THE RANSOM WAS PAID@{ub}

12 In the fall (autumn) of 29 @{"C.E." alink "CE"}, Jesus went to his relative John to be
baptized and thereby present himself to carry out God's will.  On that
occasion Jehovah annointed Jesus with holy spirit.  Jesus thus became
the Messiah, or Christ, the one annointed by God.  (Matthew 3:16,17)  Then
Jesus embarked on his three-and-a-half-year ministry.  He traveled
throughout his homeland, preaching about God's Kingdom and gathering
faithful followers.  However, as foretold, opposition to him soon mounted.
- Psalm 118:22;  Acts 4:8-11.

13 Jesus courageously exposed the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, and
they sought his death.  They eventually hatched an ugly plot that involved
betrayal, improper arrest, an illegal trial, and a false charge of sedition.
Jesus was struck, spat upon, ridiculed, and beaten with a whip designed to
tear his flesh.  The Roman governor Pontius Pilate then sentenced him to
death on a torture stake.  He was nailed to a wooden pole and hung there
upright.  Each breath was excruciating, and it took hours for him to die.
Thoughout the ordeal, Jesus maintained perfect integrity to God.

14 Thus, it was on Nisan 14, 33 @{"C.E." alink "CE"}, that Jesus gave his life as "a ransom
in exchange for many."  (Mark 10:45;  1 Timothy 2:5,6)  From heaven, Jehovah
could see his dear Son suffer and die.  Why did God allow such a terrible
thing to happen?  He did so because he loved humankind.  Jesus said:  "God
loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that
everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting
life."  (John 3:16)  The death of Jesus also teaches us that Jehovah is a
God of perfect justice.  (Deuteronomy 32:4)  Some might wonder why God did
not waive his principles of justice that require soul for soul and ignore
the price of Adam's sinful course.  The reason is that Jehovah always abides
by his laws and upholds them, even at great cost to himself.

15 Jehovah's justice also required that Jesus' death have a happy outcome.
After all, would there be justice in allowing faithful Jesus to sleep
forever in death?  Of course not!  The Hebrew Scriptures had prophecised
that God's loyal one would not remain in the grave.  (Psalm 16:10;  Acts
13:35)  He slept in death for parts of three days, and then Jehovah God
resurrected him to life as a mighty spirit being. - 1 Peter 3:18.

16 At his death, Jesus surrendered his human life for all time.  Upon being
raised to life in heaven, he becamea life-giving spirit.  Moreover, when
Jesus ascended to the holiest place in the universe, he was reunited with
his dear Father and formally presented to Him the value of that precious
life could then be applied in behalf of obedient mankind.  What does that
mean for you?

                            @{b}CHRIST'S RANSOM AND YOU@{ub}

17 Consider three ways in which Christ's ransom sacrifice benefits you
even now.  First, it brings @{i}forgiveness of sins@{ui}.  Through faith in the shed
blood of Jesus, we have "the release by ransom," yes, "the forgiveness of
our trespasses."  (Ephesians 1:7)  So even if we have committed a serious
sin, we can ask for God's forgiveness in Jesus' name.  If we are truly
repentant, Jehovah applies to us the value of his Son's ransom sacrifice.
God forgives us, granting us the blessing of a good conscience, instead
of exacting the penalty of death that we incur by sinning - Acts 3:19;
1 Peter 3:21.

18 Second, Christ's ransom sacrifice provides the basis of our @{i}hope for@{ui}
@{i}the future@{ui}.  In vision, the apostle John saw that "a great crowd, which no
man was able to number" would survive the coming cataclysmic end of this
@{"system of things" alink "World"}.  Why will they survive when God destroys so many others?
An angel told John that the great crowd had "washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb," Jesus Christ.  (Revelation 7:9,14)  As
long as we exercise faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ and live in
harmony with divine requirements, we will clean in God's sight and will have
the hope of everlasting life.

19 Third, the ransom sacrifice is the ultimate @{i}proof of Jehovah's love@{ui}.
Christ's death embodied the two greatest acts of love in the history of
the universe: (1) God's love in sending his Son to die in our behalf;  (2)
Jesus' love in willingly offering himself as a ransom.  (John 15:13;  Romans
5:8)  If we truly exercise faith, this love applies to each and every one
of us.  The apostle Paul said:  "The Son of God . . . loved me and handed
himself over for me." - Galatians 2:20;  Hebrews 2:9;  1 John 4:9,10.

20 Therefore, let us show our gratitude for the love displayed by God and
Christ by exercising faith in Jesus' ransom sacrifice.  Doing so leads to
everlasting life.  (John 3:36)  Yet, our salvation is not the most important
reason for Jesus' life and death on earth.  No, his primary concern was an
even greater issue, a universal one.  As we shall see in the @{"next chapter" link "Chapter8"},
that issue touches all of us because it shows why God has allowed wickedness
and suffering to persist so long in this world.

@node "Chapter8" "Why Does God Permit Suffering?"

                               @{u}@{b}WHY DOES GOD@{ub}@{uu}
                            @{u}@{b}PERMIT SUFFERING?@{ub}@{uu}

1 WHEN disasters strike, destroying property and claiming lives, many cannot
understand why such terrible things happen.  Others are troubled by the
extent, cruelty, and wantonness of crime and violence.  You too may have
wondered, 'Why does God permit suffering?'

2 Because they have found no satisfactory answer to this question, many have
lost faith in God.  They feel that he is not interested in mankind.  Others
who accept suffering as a fact of life become embittered and blame God for
all the evil in human society.   If you have had such feelings, doubtless
you will be very interested in the Bible's statements on these matters.

                          @{b}SUFFERING NOT FROM GOD@{ub}

3 The Bible assures us that the suffering we see around us is not caused by
Jehovah God.  For instance, the Christian disciple James wrote:  "When under
trial, let no one say:  'I am being tried by God.'  For with evil things God
cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone."  (James 1:13)  That being
so, God could not have caused the numerous hardships plaguing mankind.  He
does not bring trials upon people to make them fit for life in heaven, nor
does he make people suffer for evil deeds they supposedly committed in a
past life. - Romans 6:7.

4 In addition, even though many terrible things have been done in the name
of God or of Christ, there is nothing in the Bible to suggest that either of
them have ever approved of such actions.  God and Christ have nothing to do
with those who claim to serve them but who cheat and swindle, kill and
plunder, and do many other things that cause human suffering.  In fact, "the
way of the wicked one is something detestable to Jehovah."  God "is far away
from the wicked ones." - Proverbs 15:9, 29.

5 The Bible describes Jehovah as being "very tender in affection and
merciful."  (James 5:11)  It proclaims that "Jehovah is a lover of justice."
(Psalm 37:28;  Isaiah 61:8)  He is not vindictive.  He compassionately cares
for his creatures and gives them all what is best for their well-being. 
(Acts 14:16,17)  Jehovah has done that right from the very origin of life on
earth.

                             @{b}A PERFECT BEGINNING@{ub}

6 All of us are accustomed to seeing and feeling pain and suffering.  It
may therefore be hard to imagine a time without suffering, but that was how
things were at the beginning of human history.  Even the legends of some
nations allude to such a happy start.  In Greek mythology, the first of the
"Five Ages of Man" was called the "Golden Age."  In it humans lived happy
lives, free from toil, pain, and the ravages of old age.  The Chinese say
that during the reign of the mythological Yellow Emperor (Huang-Ti), people
lived in peace, enjoying harmony even with the elements and the wild beasts.
Persians, Egyptians, Tibetians, Peruvians, and Mexicans all have legends
about a time of happiness and perfection at the beginning of mankind's
history.

7 The myths of the nations merely echo the oldest written record of human
history, the Bible.  It informs us that God placed the first human pair,
Adam and Eve, in a paradise called the garden of Eden and commanded them: 
"Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it."  (Genesis
1:28)  Our first human parents enjoyed perfection and had the prospect of
seeing the whole earth become a paradise occupied by a perfect human family
living in lasting peace and happiness.  That was God's purpose in creating
the earth and humankind. - Isaiah 45:18.
      
                            @{b}A MALICIOUS CHALLENGE@{ub}

8 To remain in God's favor, Adam and Eve would have to refrain from eating
from "the tree of the knowledge of good and bad."  (Genesis 2:16, 17)  If
they had obeyed Jehovah's law, there would have been no suffering to mar
human life.  By obeying God's command, they would have demonstrated their
love for Jehovah and their loyalty to him.  (1 John 5:3)  But as we learned
in @{"Chapter 6" link "Chapter6"}, things did not turn out that way.  Urged by Satan, Eve ate the
fruit from that tree.  Later, Adam also partook of the forbidden fruit.

9 Do you see the seriousness of what happened?  Satan was attacking
Jehovah's position as the Most High.  By saying, "You will positively not
die," the Devil contradicted God's words, "You will positively die." 
Satan's further words implied that Jehovah was keeping Adam and Eve ignorant
of the possibility of becoming like God, thus not needing Him to decide what
was good and bad.  Satan's challenge therefore brought into question the
right and validity of Jehovah's position as the Universal Sovereign.
- Genesis 2:17;  3:1-6.

10 Satan the Devil also insinuated that people would remain obedient to
Jehovah only as long as obeying God was to their advantage.  In other words,
human integrity was brought into question.  Satan charged that no human
would voluntarily remain loyal to God.  This malicious claim by Satan is
clearly revealed in the Bible's account of Job, a faithful servant of
Jehovah who underwent a great test sometime before 1600 @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}
When you read the first two chapters of the book of Job, you can gain
insight into the reason for human suffering and why God permits it.

11 Job, "a man blameless and upright," came under Satan's attack.  First,
Satan imputed bad motived to Job by raising the question, "Is it for nothing
that Job has feared God?"  Then, the Devil cunningly maligned both God and
Job by charging that Jehovah had bought Job's loyalty by protecting and
blessing him.  "But, for a change," Satan challenged Jehovah, "thrust out
your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not
curse you to your very face." - Job 1:8-11.

12 Was Job serving Jehovah simply because of all the good that he received
from God?  Could Job's integrity stand up under test?  In turn, did Jehovah
have enough confidence in his servant to allow him to be tested?  These
questions could be answered if Jehovah would permit Satan to bring upon Job
the severest of tests.  Job's faithful course under the test allowed by God,
as narrated in the book of Job, proved to be a thorough vindication of
Jehovah's righteousness and man's integrity. - Job 42:1, 2, 12.

13 What happened in the garden of Eden and to the man Job, however, has a
deeper implication.  The issues Satan raised involve all of mankind,
including us today.  God's name was maligned, and his sovereignty was
challenged.  The uprightness of God's creation, man, was called into
question.  These issues had to be settled.

                           @{b}HOW TO SETTLE THE ISSUES@{ub}

14 For the sake of illustration, let us say that you are a loving parent
with several children in a happy family.  Suppose one of your neighbors
spreads lies, accusing you of being a bad parent.  What if the neighbor
says that your children do not love you, that they stay with you only
because they do not know any better, and that they would leave if someone
showed them the way.  'Preposterous!' you might say.  Yes, but how would you
prove it?  Some parents might react in rage.  Besides creating more
problems, such a violent response would lend support to the lies.  A
satisfying way to deal with such a problem would be to allow opportunity for
your accuser to prove his claim and for your children to testify that they
sincerely love you.

15 Jehovah is like the loving parent.  Adam and Eve may be compared to the
children, and Satan fits the role of the lying neighbor.  God wisely did not
destroy Satan, Adam, and Eve immediately but permitted these wrongdoers to
continue living for a while.  This allowed our first parents time to start
the human family, and it has given the Devil a chance to prove whether his
claim was true so that the issues could be settled.  From the start,
however, God knew that some humans would thus prove Satan a liar.  How
thankful we are that Jehovah has continued to bless and help those who love
him! - 2 Chronicles 16:9;  Proverbs 15:3.

                            @{b}WHAT HAS BEEN PROVED?@{ub}

16 During nearly all of human history, Satan has had a free hand to work out
his schemes of domination over mankind.  Among other things, he has wielded
influence over the political powers and has promoted religions that subtly
direct worship to him rather than to Jehovah.  Thus the Devil has become
"the god of this @{"system of things" alink "World"}," and he is called "the ruler of this
world."  (2 Corinthians 4:4;  John 12:31)  Indeed, "the whole world is lying
in the power of the wicked one."  (1 John 5:19)  Does this mean that Satan
has proved him claim that he could draw all mankind away from Jehovah God?
Certainly not!  While permitting Satan to remain in existence, Jehovah has
proceeded to carry out his own purpose.  What, then, does the Bible reveal
God's permission of wickedness?

17 @{i}Wickedness and suffering are not caused by Jehovah.@{ui}  Since Satan is the
ruler of this world and the god of this @{"system of things" alink "World"}, he and those on
his side are responsible for the present condition of human society and all
the misery that mankind has suffered.  No one can rightly say that God is
the cause of such hardship. - Romans 9:14.

18 Jehovah's permitting wickedness and suffering has proved that
@{i}independence from God has not brought about a better world.@{ui}  Undeniably,
history has been marked by one disaster after another.  The reason for this
is that humans have chosen to pursue their own independent and have shown no
real regard for God's word and will.  When Jehovah's ancient people and
their leaders unfaithfully pursued "the popular course" and rejected his
word, the results were disasterous.  Through his prophet Jeremiah, God told
them:  "The wise ones have become ashamed.  They have become terrified and
will be caught.  Look!  They have rejected the very word of Jehovah, and
what wisdom do they have?"  (Jeremiah 8:5, 6, 9)  Having failed to follow
Jehovah's standards, mankind in general has become like a ship without a
rudder, tossed about in a turbulent sea.

19 God's permission of wickedness and suffering has also proved that @{i}Satan@{ui}
@{i}has not been able to turn all mankind away from Jehovah.@{ui}  History shows
that there have always been individuals who have remained faithful to God no
matter what temptations or adversities were brought upon them.  Over the
centuries, Jehovah's power has been manifested in behalf of his servants
and his name has been declared in all the earth.  (Exodus 9:16;  1 Samuel
12:22)  Hebrews chapter 11 tells us about a long line of faithful ones,
including Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses.  Hebrews 12:1 calls them
'a great cloud of witnesses.'  They were examples of unwavering faith in
Jehovah.  In modern times too, many have given their lives in unbreakable
integrity to God.  By their faith and love, such individuals prove
conclusively that Satan cannot turn all humans against God.

20 Finally, Jehovah's allowing wickedness and suffering to continue has
provided proof that @{i}only Jehovah, the Creator, has the ability and right to@{ui}
@{i}rule over mankind@{ui} for their eternal blessing and happiness.  For centuries,
mankind has tried many forms of government.  But what has been the result?
The complex problems and crises facing the nations today are ample evidence
that truly, as the Bible points out, "man has dominated man to his injury."
(Ecclesiastes 8:9)  Only Jehovah can come to our rescue and fulfill his
original purpose.  How will he do this, and when?

21 Right after Adam and Eve fell victim to Satan's scheme, God announced
His purpose regarding a means of salvation.  This is what Jehovah proclaimed
regarding Satan:  "I shall put emnity between you and the woman and between
your seed and her seed.  He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise
him in the heel."  (Genesis 3:15)  That proclaimation guaranteed that the
Devil would not be allowed to do his evil deeds forever.  As the King of
the Messianic Kingdom, the promised Seed, Jesus Christ, will 'bruise Satan
in the head.'  Yes, "shortly," Jesus will crush the rebel Satan! - Romans
16:20.

                              @{b}WHAT WILL YOU DO?@{ub}

22 Knowing the issues involved, on whose side will you stand?  Will you
prove by your actions that you are a loyal supporter of Jehovah?  Since
Satan knows that his time is short, he will do all he can to vent his wrath
on those who want to keep integrity to God.  (Revelation 12:12)  But you can
look to God for help because "Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly
devotion out of trial."  (2 Peter 2:9)  He will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear, and he will make the way out so that you are able
to endure temptations. - 1 Corinthians 10:13

23 Confidently, let us look forward to the time when the King Jesus Christ
will take action against Satan and all who follow him.  (Revelation 20:1-3)
Jesus will do away with all those who share responsibility for the woes and
turmoil that mankind has suffered.  Until that time, one especially painful
form of suffering if the loss of our loved ones in death.  Read the

1 "ONE suffers when a dead loved one dies because death is a loss to a void
beyond all understanding."  This is what one son said when his father and
shortly thereafter his mother died.  His pain and sense of deep loss made
him feel that he was "drowning emotionally."  Perhaps you have suffered in a
similar way.  You may have wondered where your loved ones are and whether
you will ever see them again.

2 Some grieving parents have been told, "God picks the most beautiful
flowers to take to himself in heaven."  Is this really so?  Have our dead
loved ones gone to a spirit realm?  Is it what some call Nirvana, described
as a blissful state of being free of all pain and desire?  Have those we
love passed through a doorway to immortal life in paradise?  Or as others
claim, is death a fall into neverending torment for those who have offended
God?  Can the dead affect our lives?  To get truthful answers to such
questions, we need to consult God's Word, the Bible.

                        @{b}WHAT IS THE "SPIRIT" IN HUMANS?@{ub}

3 The ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Plato held that there must be
something imherently immortal inside man and woman-  a soul that survives
death and never really dies.  Earth wide, millions believe this today.
This belief often engenders as much fear of the dead as it does concern for
their welfare.  The Bible teaches us something quite different about the
dead.

4 In considering the condition of the dead, we must remember that our
original father, Adam did not @{i}have@{ui} a soul.  He @{i}was@{ui} a soul.  In an
awe-inspiring act of creation, God formed man- the soul- from the basic
elements of the earth and then breathed into him "the breath of life." 
Genesis 2:7 tells us:  "Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust
from the ground and blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man
came to be a living soul."  Adam's life was sustained by breathing.  Yet
more than the blowing of air into man's lungs was involved when God put the
breath of life into Adam.  The Bible speaks of "the force of life" that is
active in earthly living creatures - Genesis 7:22.

5 What is "the force of life"?  It is the vital spark of life that God put
into the lifeless body of Adam.  This force was then sustained by the
breathing process.  But what is the "spirit" referred to as Psalm 146:4?
That verse says of one who dies:  "His spirit goes out, he goes back to his
ground;  in that day his thoughts do perish."  When the Bible writers used
the word "spirit" in this way, they did not have in mind a disembodied soul
that continues living after the body dies.

6 The "spirit" that departs from humans at death is the life force that
originated with our Creator.  (Psalm 36:9; Acts 17:28)  This life force
does not have any of the characteristics of the creature it animates, just
as electricity does not take on the features of the equipment it powers. 
When someone dies, the spirit (life force) ceases to animate the body cells,
much as a light goes out when the electricity is turned off.  When the life
force stops sustaining the human body, man- the soul- dies. - Psalm 104:29;
Ecclesiastes 12:1, 7.

                           @{b}"TO DUST YOU WILL RETURN"@{ub}

7 Jehovah clearly explained what death would mean for the sinner Adam.  God
said:  "In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to
the ground, for out of it you were taken.  For dust you are, and to dust
you will return."  (Genesis 3:19)  Adam would return to where?  To the
ground, to the dust from which he had been created.  At death Adam would
simply cease to exist!

8 In this regard, human death does not differ from that of the animals.
They too are souls, and the same spirit, or life force, energizes them.
(Genesis 1:24)  At Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20, the wise man Solomon tells us:
"As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so
that [in death] there is no superiority of the man over the beast . . . They
have all come to be from the dust, and they are all returning to the dust."
Man was superior to the beasts in that he was created in God's image,
reflecting the qualities of Jehovah.  (Genesis 1:26, 27)  Yet, at death
humans and animals alike return to the dust.

9 Solomon further explained what death means, saying:  "The living are
conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of
nothing at all."  Yes, the dead know absolutely nothing.  In view of this,
Solomon urged:  "All that your hands find to do, do with your very power,
for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the
place to which you are going."  (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10)  Where do the dead
go?  To Sheol (Hebrew, @{i}she'ohl'@{ui}), the common grave of mankind.  Our dead
loved ones are not conscious of anything.  They are not suffering, and they
cannot affect us in any way.

10 Must all of us and our loved ones live only a few years and then cease to
exist forever?  Not according to the Bible.  At the time of Adam's
rebellion, Jehovah God immediately instituted arrangements to reverse the
terrible consequences of human sin.  Death was not part of God's purpose for
mankind.  (Ezekiel 33:11;  2 Peter 3:9)  Hence, death does not have to be
final for us or for our loved ones.

                               @{b}"GONE TO REST"@{ub}

11 It is Jehovah's purpose to rescue us and our dead loved ones from Adamic
death.  Therefore, God's Word refers to the dead as being asleep.  For
example, upon learning that his friend Lazarus died, Jesus Christ told His
disciples:  "Lazarus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying there
to awaken him from sleep."  Since the disciples did not immediately grasp
the meaning of this statement, Jesus said plainly:  "Lazarus has died." 
(John 11:11, 14)  Jesus then went to the town of Bethany, where Lazarus'
sisters Martha and Mary were mourning their brother's death.  When Jesus
told Martha, "Your brother will rise," she expressed her faith in God's
promise to reverse the effects of death on the human family.  She said:  "I
know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day." - John 11:23, 24.

12 Martha expressed no thought about an immortal soul living on elsewhere
after death.  She did not believe that Lazarus had already gone to some
spirit realm to continue his existence.  Martha had faith in the wonderful
hope of a @{i}resurrection@{ui} from the dead.  She understood, not that an immortal
soul had departed from the body of Lazarus, but that her dead brother had
ceased to exist.  The remedy would be the resurrection of her brother.

13 Jesus Christ is the one empowered by Jehovah God to redeem mankind. 
(Hosea 13:14)  Hence, in response to Martha's statement, Jesus said:  "I am
the resurrection and the life.  He that exercises faith in me, even though
he dies, will come to life."  (John 11:25) Jesus demonstrated his God-given
power in this regard when he went to the tomb of Lazarus, who had been dead
for four days, and restored him to life.  (John 11:38-44)  Just imagine the
joy of those who saw this resurrection or others performed by Jesus Christ!
- Mark 5:35-42;  Luke 7:12-16.

14 Pause for a moment to consider this:  Nobody would need to be
resurrected, or brought back to life, if an immortal soul survived death. 
In fact, it would be no kindness to resurrect someone like Lazarus back to
imperfect life on earth if he had already passed on to a wonderful heavenly
reward.  Actually, the Bible never uses the expression "immortal soul." 
Instead, the Scriptures say that the sinning human soul does die.  (Ezekiel
18:4, 20)  So the Bible points to the provision of a resurrection as the
real remedy for death.

                        @{b}"ALL THOSE IN THE MEMORIAL TOMBS"@{ub}

15 The word that Jesus' disciples used for "resurrection" literally means
"raising up" or "standing up."  This is a raising up from the lifeless
condition of death - as it were, a standing up out of the common grave of
mankind.  Jehovah God can easily resurrect a person.  Why?  Because Jehovah
is the Originator of life.  Today, humans can record the voices and images
of men and women on videotape and can replay these recordings after the
individuals die.  Surely, then, our almighty Creator can record the details
of any individual and resurrect the same person, giving him or her a newly
formed body.

16 Jesus Christ said:  "The hour is coming in which all those in the
memorial tombs will hear his [Jesus'] voice and come out, those who did good
things to a resurrection of life, and those who practiced vile things to a
resurrection of judgement."  (John 5:28, 29)  All those in Jehovah's memory
will be resurrected and instructed in his ways.  For those who act in
harmony with the knowledge of God, this will turn out to be a resurrection
of life.  However, it will turn out to be a resurrection of condemnatory
judgement for those who reject God's teachings and rulership.

17 Naturally, those who have pursued a righteous couse as Jehovah's servants
will be resurrected.  In fact, the resurrection hope strengthened many to
face death, even in cases of violent persecution.  They knew that God could
restore them to life.  (Matthew 10:28)  But millions of people have died
without showing whether they would comply with God's righteous standards.
They too will be resurrected.  Confident in Jehovah's purpose in this
regard, the apostly Paul said:  "I have hope toward God . . . that there is
going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous." -
Acts 24:15.

18 The apostle John received a thrilling vision of resurrected ones standing
before God's throne.  John then wrote:  "The sea gave up those dead in it,
and death and Hades gave up those dead in them, and they were judged
individually according to their deeds.  And death and Hades were hurled into
the lake of fire.  This means the second death, the lake of fire." 
(Revelation 20:12-14)  Think of that!  All the dead who are in God's memory
have the prospect of release from Hades (Greek, @{i}hai'des@{ui}), or Sheol,
mankind's common grave.  (Psalm 16:10;  Acts 2:31)  They will have an
opportunity to demonstrate by their deeds whether they will serve God.  Then
"death and Hades" will be hurled into what is called "the lake of fire,"
symbolizing complete destruction, as does the term "Gehenna."  (Luke 12:5)
The common grave of mankind itself will have been emptied and will cease to
exist when the resurrection is completed.  How comforting it is to learn
from the Bible that God does not torture anyone! - Jeremiah 7:30, 31.

                             @{b}RESURRECTION TO WHERE?@{ub}

19 A limited number of men and women will be resurrected to life in heaven.
As kings and priests with Jesus, they will share in undoing all the effects
of death that mankind inherited from the first man, Adam.  (Romans 5:12; 
Revelation 5:9,10)  How many will God take to heaven to rule with Christ?
According to the Bible, only 144,000.  (Revelation 7:4;  14:1)  Jehovah will
give each of these resurrected ones a spirit body so that they can live in
heaven. - 1 Corinthians 15:35, 38, 42-45;  1 Peter 3:18.

20 By far the majority of those who have dies will be resurrected to a
paradise earth.  (Psalm 37:11, 29;  Matthew 6:10)  Part of the reason for
resurrecting some to heaven is to complete God's purpose for the earth. 
Jesus Christ and the 144,000 in heaven will progressively bring obedient
mankind back to the perfection that our original parents threw away.  This
will include resurrected ones, as indicated by Jesus when he told the dying
man impaled next to him:  "You will be with me in Paradise." - Luke 23:42,
43.

21 On the Paradise earth, death, which today produces such futility, will be
removed.  (Romans 8:19-21)  The prophet Isaiah declared that Jehovah God
"will actually swallow up death forever."  (Isaiah 25:8)  The apostle John
was given a vision of the time when obedient mankind will experience freedom
from pain and death.  Yes, "God himself will be with them.  And he will wipe
out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will
mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.  The former things have passed
away." - Revelation 21:1-4.

22 The Bible's clear teachings remove confusion about what happens to the
dead.  The Scriptures plainly state that death is "the last enemy" that will
be destroyed.  (1 Corinthians 15:26)  What strength and comfort we can draw
from the knowledge of the resurrection hope!  And how glad we can be that
our dead loved ones who are in God's memory will awaken from the sleep of
death to enjoy all the good things he has in store for those who love him!
(Psalm 145:16)  Such blessings will be accomplished through God's Kingdom.
But when was it' rule to begin?  Let us see.

@node "Chapter10" "God's Kingdom Rules"

                             @{b}@{u}GOD'S KINGDOM RULES@{ub}@{uu}

1 PERHAPS you have had the experience of buying a piece of equipment, only
to find that it did not work.  Let us say that you called a repairman.
Shortly after he "fixed" the device, however, it broke down.  How
disappointing that was!

2 It is similar with human governments.  Mankind has always desired a
government that would ensure peace and happiness.  Yet, strenuous efforts to
repair the breakdowns in society have not been truly sucessful.  A great
many peace treaties have been made- and then broken.  Moreover, what
government has been able to eradicate poverty, prejustice, crime, disease,
and ecological ruin?  Man's rule is beyond repair.  Even Israel's wise King
Solomon asked:  "As regards earthling man, how can he discern his way?" -
Proverbs 20:24.

3 Do not despair!  A stable world government is not just a dream.  It was
the theme of Jesus' preaching.  He called it "the kingdom of God," and he
taught his followers to pray for it.  (Luke 11:2;  21:31)  Of course, God's
Kingdom is sometimes mentioned in religious circles.  In fact, millions pray
for it daily when they repeat the Lord's Prayer (also called the Our Father
or model prayer).  But people answer in various ways when asked, "What is
God's Kingdom?"  Some say, "It is in your heart."  Others call it heaven.
The Bible gives a clear answer as we shall see.

                          @{b}A KINGDOM WITH A PURPOSE@{ub}

4 Jehovah God has always been King, or Sovereign Ruler, of the universe.
The fact that he created all things elevates him to that exalted position.
(1 Chronicles 29:11;  Psalm 103:19;  Acts 4:24)  But the Kingdom that Jesus
preached about is subsidiary, or secondary, to God's universal sovereignty.
That Messianic Kingdom has a specific purpose, but what is it?

5 As explained in @{"Chapter 6" link "Chapter6"}, the first human pair rebelled against God's
authority.  Because of the issues raised, Jehovah chose to bring about a new
expression of his sovereignty.  God announced his purpose to produce a
"seed" that would crush the Serpent, Satan, and remove the effects of
mankind's inherited sin.  The primary "seed" is Jesus Christ, and "the
kingdom of God" is the agency that will utterly defeat Satan.  By means of
this Kingdom, Jesus Christ will restore rulership over the earth in
Jehovah's name and will vindicate God's rightful sovereignity for all time.
- Genesis 3:15;  Psalm 2:2-9.

6 According to one rendition of Jesus' words to wicked Pharisees, he said:
"The kingdom of God is within you."  (Luke 17:21, @{i}King James Version@{ui})  Did
Jesus mean that the Kingdom was in the wicked hearts of those corrupt men?
No.  A more accurate translation of the original Greek reads:  "The kingdom
of God is in your midst." (New World Translation)  Jesus, who was in their
midst, thus referred to himself as the future King.  Far from being
something that a person has in his heart, God's Kingdom is a real, operating
government having a ruler and subjects.  It is a heavenly government having
a ruler and subjects.  It is a heavenly government, for it is called both
"the kingdom of the heavens" and "the kingdom of God."  (Matthew 13:11; 
Luke 8:10)  In vision, the prophet Daniel beheld its Ruler as "someone like
a son of man" brought before Almighty God and given lasting "rulership and
dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should
all serve even him."  (Daniel 7:13, 14)  Who is this King?  Well, the Bible
calls Jesus Christ "the Son of man."  (Matthew 12:40;  Luke 17:26)  Yes,
Jehovah designated his Son, Jesus Christ, to be King.

7 Jesus does not rule alone.  With him are 144,000 who have been "bought
from the earth" to be his associate kings and priests.  (Revelation 5:9, 10;
14:1, 3;  Luke 22:28-30)  The subjects of God's Kingdom will be a global
family of humans who are submissive to Christ's leadership.  (Psalm 72:7, 8)
How, though, can we be sure that the Kingdom will actually vindicate God's
Sovereignty and restore paradisaic conditions to our earth?

                          @{b}THE REALITY OF GOD'S KINGDOM@{ub}

8 Imagine that a fire has destroyed your home.  Now a friend who has the
means to do so promises to help rebuild your house and provide food for your
family.  If that friend has always told you the truth, would you not believe
him?  Suppose you came home from work the next day and found that workers
were already starting to clean up the debris from the fire and that food
had been brought for your family.  No doubt you would be completely
confident that with the passing of time, things would not only be restored
but would be even better than before.

9 Similarly, Jehovah gives us assurance of the Kingdom's reality.  As shown
in the Bible book of Hebrews, many facets of the Law foreshadowed the
Kingdom arrangement.  (Hebrews 10:1)  Foregleams of God's Kingdom were also
evident in the earthly kingdom of Israel.  That was no ordinary government,
for the rulers sat upon "Jehovah's throne."  (1 Chronicles 29:23)  Moreover,
it had been foretold:  "The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither
the commander's staff from between his feet, until the @{"Shiloh" alink "Shiloh"} comes;  and to
him the obedience of the peoples will belong."  (Genesis 49:10)@{" * " alink "Shiloh"} Yes, it
was into this Judean line of kings that Jesus, the permanent King of God's
government, was to be born. - Luke 1:32, 33.

10 The foundation of God's Messianic Kingdom was laid with the selection of
Jesus' apostles.  (Ephesians 2:19, 20;  Revelation 21:14)  These were the
first of 144,000 who would rule in heaven as associate kings with Jesus
Christ.  While on earth, these prospective corulers would spearhead a
witnessing campaign, in keeping with Jesus' command:  "Go . . . and make
disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit." - Matthew 28:19.

11 The command to make disciples is now being obeyed on an unprecedented
scale.  Jehovah's Witnesses are proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom all
around the globe, in harmony with Jesus prophetic words:  "This good news of
the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all
the nations;  and then the end will come."  (Matthew 24:14)  As one aspect
of the Kingdom-preaching work, a great educational program is being carried
out.  Those who submit to the laws and principles of God's Kingdom are
already experiencing a peace and unity that human goverments cannot achieve.
All of this gives clear evidence that God's Kingdom is a reality!

12 Jehovah even told the Israelites:  "You are my witnesses, . . . even my
servant whom I have chosen."  (Isaiah 43:10-12)  Jesus, "the Faithful
Witness," zealously declared the good news of the Kingdom.  (Revelation 1:5;
Matthew 4:17)  So it is appropriate that present-day Kingdom proclaimers
bear the divinely appointed name Jehovah's Witnesses.  But why do the
Witnesses spend so much time and effort talking to others about God's
Kingdom?  They do this because the Kingdom is mankind's only hope.  Human
governments break down sooner or later, but God's Kingdom never will. 
Isaiah 9:6, 7 calls its Ruler, Jesus, the "Prince of Peace" and adds:  "To
the abundance of peace there will be no end."  God's Kingdom is not like
man's governments - here today and overthrown tomorrow.  Indeed, Daniel 2:44
says:  "The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought
to ruin.  And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people .
. . . It itself will stand to times indefinite."

13 What human king could bring about the elimination of war, crime,
sickness, starvation, and homelessness?  Furthermore, what earthly ruler
could resurrect those who have died?  God's Kingdom and its King will
address these matters.  The Kingdom will not prove defective, like
malfunctioning equipment that continually needs repair.  Rather, God's
Kingdom will succeed, for Jehovah promises:  "My word that goes forth from
my mouth . . . will not return to me without results, but it will certainly
do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that
for which I have sent it."  (Isaiah 55:11)  God's purpose will not fail, but
when was Kingdom rule to begin?

                              @{b}KINGDOM RULE - WHEN?@{ub}

14 "Lord, are you restoring the Kingdom to Israel at this time?"  This
question posed by Jesus' disciples revealed that as yet they did not know
the purpose of God's Kingdom and the appointed time for its rule to begin.
Warning them not to speculate about the matter, Jesus said:  "It does not
belong to you to get knowledge of the times or seasons which the Father has
placed in his own jurisdiction."  Jesus knew that his rulership over the
earth was reserved for the future, long after his resurrection and ascension
to heaven.  (Acts 1:6-11;  Luke 19:11, 12, 15)  The Scriptures had foretold
this.  How so?

15 Prophetically referring to Jesus as "Lord," King David said:  "The
utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: `Sit at my right hand until I place your
enemies as a stool for your feet.'"  (Psalm 110:1;  compare Acts 2:34-36.)
This prophecy indicates that Jesus rulership would not begin immediately
after his ascension to heaven.  Rather, he would wait at God's right hand.
(Hebrews 10:12, 13)  How long would this waiting go on?  When would his
rulership begin?  The Bible helps us to find the answers.

16 The only city in all the earth upon which Jehovah placed his name was
Jerusalem.  (1 Kings 11:36)  It was also the capital of a God-approved
earthly kingdom typical of God's heavenly Kingdom.  Therefore, the
destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 607 @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"} was very
significant.  This event marked the beginning of a lengthy interruption of
God's direct rule over his people on earth.  Some six centuries later, Jesus
indicated that this period of interrupted rule was still in effect, for he
said:  "Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed
times of the nations are fulfilled." - Luke 21:24.

17 During "the appointed times of the nations," worldly governments would be
allowed to interrupt rulership approved by God.  That period began with the
destruction of Jerusalem in 607 @{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}, and Daniel indicated that it would
go on for "seven times."  (Daniel 4:23-25)  How long is that?  The Bible
shows that three and a half "times" equal 1,260 days.  (Revelation 12:6, 14)
Twice that period, or seven times, would be 2,520 days.  But nothing
noteworthy happened at the end of that short period of time.  By applying
"a day for a year" to Daniel's prophecy and counting 2,520 years from 607
@{"B.C.E." alink "CE"}, however, we arrive at the year 1914 @{"C.E." alink "CE"} - Numbers 14:34;  Ezekiel
4:6.

18 Did Jesus begin to reign in heaven at that time?  Scriptural reasons for
saying that he did will be discussed in the @{"next chapter" link "Chapter11"}.  Of course, the
beginning of Jesus' rule would not be marked by immediate peace on earth.
Revelation 12:7-12 shows that just after receiving the Kingdom, Jesus would
oust Satan and the demon angels from heaven.  This would mean woe for the
earth, but it is heartening to read that the Devil has only "a short period
of time" left.  Soon, we will be able to rejoice not only because God's
Kingdom rules but also because it will bring blessings to the earth and
obedient mankind.  (Psalm 72:7, 8)  How do we know that this will happen
soon?

                                @{b}THE LAST DAYS@{ub}

1 HOW did our turbulent world get to this point?  Where are we heading?
Have you ever asked such questions?  Many feel somewhat lost when they look
at the world scene.  Realities such as warefare, disease, and crime leave
people wondering what the future holds.  Government leaders offer little
hope.  However, a reliable explanation of these distressing days is
available from God in his Word.  The Bible reliably helps us to see where we
are in the stream of time.  It shows us that we are in "the last days" of
the present @{"system of things" alink "World"}. - 2 Timothy 3:1.

2 Consider, for example, the answer Jesus gave to some questions raised
by his disciples.  Three days before Jesus died, they asked him:  "What
will be the sign of your presence and the conclusion of the @{"system" alink "World"} of
things?"@{" * " alink "World"} (Matthew 24:3)  In reply, Jesus told of specific world events
and situations that would clearly show that this ungodly @{"system" alink "World"} had
entered its last days.

3 As shown in the @{"preceding chapter" link "Chapter10"}, Bible chronology leads to the
conclusion that God's Kingdom @{i}has@{ui} already begun to rule.  But how can that
be?  Things have become worse not better.  Actually, this is a strong
indication that God's Kingdom has begun ruling.  Why so?  Well, Psalm 110:2
informs us that for a time Jesus would rule `in the midst of his enemies.'
Indeed, his first act as heavenly King was to cast Satan and his demon
angels down to the vicinity of the earth.  (Revelation 12:9)  What was the
effect?  It was just what Revelation 12:12 foretold:  "Woe for the earth
and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger,
knowing he has a short period of time."  We are now living in that "short
period of time."

4 Not surprisingly, therefore, when Jesus was asked what the sign of his
presence and of the conclusion of the @{"system of things" alink "World"} would be, his reply
was sobering.  Various components of the sign are found in @{"the box" link "LastDaysBox"} on page
102.  As you can see, the Christian apostles Paul, Peter, and John provide
us with further details concerning the last days.  True, most features of
the sign and of the last days involve distressing situations.  Yet, the
fulfillment of these prophecies should convince us that this wicked @{"system" alink "World"}
is near its end.  Let us take a close look at some of the principle features
of the last days.

                           FEATURES OF THE LAST DAYS

5 @{i}"Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom."@{ui}
(Matthew 24:7; Revelaton 6:4)  Writer Ernest Hemingway called World War I
"the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that has ever taken
place on earth."  According to the book The World in the Crucible -
1914-1919, this was "a new scope of war, the first total war in the
experience of mankind.  Its duration, intensity, and scale exceeded anything
previously known or generally expected."  Then came World War II, which
proved much more destructive than World War I.  "The twentieth century,"
says professor of high history Hugh Thomas, "has been dominated by the
machine gun, the tank, the B-52, the nuclear bomb and, finally, the missile.
It has been marked by wars more bloody and destructive than those of any
other age."  True, much was said about disarmament after the Cold War ended.
Still, one report estimates that after proposed reductions some 10,000 to
20,000 nuclear warheads will remain - more than 900 times the firepower used
during World War II.

6 @{i}"There will be food shortages."@{ui} (Matthew 24:7;  Revelation 6:5, 6, 8)
Since 1914 there have been at least 20 major famines.  Afflicted areas
include Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Greece, India,
Nigeria, Russia, Rwanda, Somalia, and Sudan.  But famine is not always
caused by a lack of food.  "The world's food supply over recent decades has
grown faster than its population," concluded a group of agricultural
scientists and economists.  "But because at least 800 million people live
in deep poverty, . . . they are unable to purchase enough of the abundance
to lift them out of chronic malnutrition."  Political meddling is involved
in other cases.  Dr. Abdelgalil Elmekki of the University of Toronto cites
two examples in which thousands starved while their countries were exporting
massive amounts of food.  The governments seemed far moe concerned with
raising foreign currency to finance their wars than with feeding their
citizens.  Dr. Elmekki's conclusion?  Famine if often "a matter or
distribution and government policy."

7 @{i}"Pestilences."@{ui} (Luke 21:11;  Revelation 6:8)  The Spanish influenza of
1918-19 claimed at least 21 million lives.  "The world had never in history
been ravaged by a killer that slew so many human beings so quickly," writes
A. A. Howhling in @{i}The Great Epidemic@{ui}.  Today, pestilences rage on.  Each
year, cancer kills five million people, diarrheal diseases claim the lives
of more than three million infants and children, and tuberculosis slays
three million.  Respiratory infections, mainly pneumonia, annually kill 3.5
million youngsters under five years of age.  And a staggering 2.5 billion -
half the world's population - suffer from sicknesses that stem from
insufficient or contaminated water and poor sanitation.  AIDS looms as a
further reminder that man, despite his significant medical accomplishments,
is incapable of eradicating pestilences.

8 @{i}"Men will be . . . lovers of money."@{ui} (2 Timothy 3:2) In lands around the
world, people seem to have an insatiable hunger for great wealth.  "Success"
is often measured by the size of one's paycheck, "accomplishment" by how
much one owns.  "Materialism will continue to be one of the driving forces
in American society . . . and an increasingly important force in other major
markets as well," declared the vice president of an advertising agency.  Is
this happening where you live?

9 @{i}"Disobedient to parents."@{ui} (2 Timothy 3:2) Present-day parents, teachers,
and others have firsthand evidence that many children are disrespectful and
disobedient.  Some of these youngsters are either reacting to or imitating
their parents' misbehavior.  Increasing numbers of children are losing faith
in - and rebelling against school, the law, religion, and their parents.
"As a trend," says one veteran schoolteacher, "they seem to have very little
respect for anything."  Happily, though, many God fearing children are
exemplary in behavior.

10 @{i}"Fierce."@{ui} (2 Timothy 3:3)  The Green word translated "fierce" means
`untamed, wild, lacking human sympathy and feeling.'  How well this fits
many perpetrators of today's violence!  "Life is so traumatic, so bloodied
with horror that it takes a cast-iron stomach to read the daily news," said
one editorial.  A housing-police sergeant noted that many youths seem to
blind themselves to the consequences of their actions.  He said:  "There is
a feeling that, `I don't know about tomorrow.  I'll get what I want today.'"

11 @{i}"Having no natural affection."@{ui} (2 Timothy 3:3) This phrase is translated
from a Greek word meaning "heartless, inhuman" and denoting a "lack of
natural, family affection." (The New International Dictionary of New
Testament Theology)  Yes, affection is often missing in the very environment
in which it should flourish - the home.  Reports of abusive treatment of
marriage mates, children, and even of elderly parents have become
disturbingly common.  One research team commented:  "Human violence - be it
slap or shove, a knifing or a shoot-out - occurs more frequently in the
family circle than any where else in our society."

12 @{i}"Having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power."@{ui}
(2 Timothy 3:5) The Bible has the power to change lives for the better.
(Ephesians 4:22-24)  Yet, many today use their religion as a screen behind
which they carry on unrighteous activities that displease God.  Lying,
stealing, and sexual misconduct are often condoned by religious leaders.
Many religions preach love but support warfare.  "In the name if the Supreme
Creator," observes an editorial in the magazine @{i}India Today@{ui}, "the human
beings have perpetrated the most abominable atrocities against their fellow
creatures."  In fact, the two bloodiest conflicts of recent times - World
Wars I and II - erupted in the heart of Christendom.

13 @{i}"Ruining the earth."@{ui} (Revelation 11:18)  More than 1,600 scientists,
including 104 Nobel laureates, from around the world endorsed a warning,
issued by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), that stated:  "Human
beings and the natural world are on a collision course . . . No more than a
few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats will be lost."
The report said that man's life-threatening practices "may so alter the world
that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know."  Ozone
depletion, water pollution, deforestation, loss of soil productivity, and
the extinction of many animal and plant species were cited as urgent
problems that must be addressed.  "Our tampering with the interdependent web
of life," said the UCS, "could trigger widespread effects, including
collapses of biological systems whose dynamics we imperfectly understand."

14 @{i}"This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited@{ui}
@{i}earth."@{ui}  (Matthew 24:14)  Jesus foretold that the good news of the Kingdom
would be preached earth wide, for a witness to all the nations.  With divine
help and blessing, millions of Jehovah's Witnesses are devoting billions of
hours to this preaching and disciple-making work.  (Matthew 28:19-20)  Yes,
the Witnesses realise that they would be bloodguilty if they did not declare
the good news.  (Ezekiel 3:18-19)  But they are delighted that each year
thousands gratefully respond to the Kingdom message and take their stand as
true Christians, that is, as Witnesses of Jehovah.  It is an enestimable
privilege to serve Jehovah and thus spread the knowledge of God.  And after
this good news is preached in all the inhabited earth, the end of this
wicked @{"system" alink "World"}, will come.

                            RESPOND TO THE EVIDENCE

15 How will this @{"system" alink "World"} end?  The Bible foretells a "great tribulation" that
will begin with an attack by this world's political element upon "Babylon
the Great," the world empire of false religion.  (Matthew 24:21;
Revelaion 17:5, 16)  Jesus said that during this period `the sun would be
darkened, and the moon would not give its light, and the stars would fall
from heaven, and the powers of the heavens would be shaken.'
(Matthew 24:29)  This may denote literal celestial phenomena.  In any case,
the shining lights of the religious world will be exposed and eliminated.
Then Satan, called "Gog of the land of Magog," will use corrupted humans in
making an all-out assualt upon Jehovah's people.  But Satan will not
succeed, for God will come to their rescue.  (Ezekiel 38:1-2; 14-23)  "The
great tribulation" will reach its climax in Armageddon, "the war of the
great day of God the Almighty."  It will clean out every last vestige of
Satan's earthly organisation, opening the way for endless blessings to flow
to surviving mankind. - Revelation 7:9, 14;  11:15;  16:14, 16;  21:3-4.

16 By themselves, some features of the prophecies describing the last days
might seem to apply to other periods of history.  But when combined, the
prophesied evidences pinpoint our day.  To illustrate:  The lines making up
a person's fingerprint form a pattern that cannot belong to any other
individual.  Similarly, the last days have their own pattern of marks, or
happenings.  These form a "fingerprint" that cannot belong to any other time
period.  When considered along with Bible indications that God's heavenly
Kingdom is now ruling, the evidence provides a solid basis for concluding
that these are indeed the last days.  Moreover, there is clear Scriptural
proof that the present wicked @{"system" alink "World"} will soon be destroyed.

17 How will you respond to the evidence that these are the last days? 
Consider this:  If a fiercely destructive storm is impending, we take
precautionary measures without delay.  Well, what the Bible foretells for
this present @{"system" alink "World"} should move us to action.  (Matthew 16:1-3)  We can
clearly see that we are living in the last days of this world @{"system" alink "World"}.  This
should motivate us to make any adjustments necessary to gain God's favor. 
(2 Peter 3:3, 10-12)  Refering to himself as the agent of salvation, Jesus
sounds the urgent call:  "Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never
become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of
life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.  For it will
come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth.  Keep awake,
then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all
these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of
man." - Luke 21:34-36

@node "Chapter12" "Resist Wicked Spirit Forces"

                                @{b}RESIST WICKED@{ub}
                                @{b}SPIRIT FORCES@{ub}

1 RIGHT after his baptism, Jesus Christ went into the Judean wilderness to
pray and meditate.  There Satan the Devil tried to get him to break God's
law.  However, Jesus rejected the Devil's bait and did not get caught in his
trap.  Jesus faced other wicked spirits during his ministry on earth.  Yet,
time and again, he rebuked and resisted them. - Luke 4:1-13; 8:26-34;
9:37-43.

2 Bible accounts describing those encounters should convice us that wicked
spirit forces do exist.  They try to mislead people.  However, we can resist
these evil spirits.  But where do wicked spirits come from?  Why do they try
to deceive humans?  And what methods do they use to try to achieve their
ends?  Finding the answers to such questions as these will help you to
resist wicked spirit forces.

                                 WICKED SPIRITS
                          - THEIR ORIGIN AND TARGET

3 Jehovah God made a multitude of spirit creatures long before he created
humans.  (Job 38:4, 7)  As explained in @{"Chapter 6" link "Chapter6"}, one of these angels
developed a desire to have humans worship him instead of worshipping
Jehovah.  Pursuing that objective, this wicked angel resisted and slandered
the Creator, even suggesting to the first woman that God was a liar. 
Fittingly, then, this rebellious spirit creature became known as Satan
(resister) the Devil (slanderer). - Genesis 3:1-5; Job 1:6.

4 Later, other angels sided with Satan the Devil.  In the days of the
righteous man Noah, some of these abandoned their service in heaven and took
on fleshly bodies to satisfy their lust for sexual relations with earthly
women.  Satan no doubt influenced those angels to take that disobedient
course.  It led to their fathering the hybrid offspring called Nephilim, who
became violent bullies.  When Jehovah caused the great Deluge, it destroyed
corrupted mankind and this unnatural progeny of the disobedient angels.  The
rebellious angels escaped destruction by dematerializing their fleshly
bodies and returning to the spirit realm.  But God restrained these demons
by treating them as outcasts in spiritual darkness.  (Genesis 6:1-7, 17;
Jude 6)  Satan, "the ruler of the demons," and his wicked angels
nevertheless have pushed on with their rebellion.  (Luke 11:15)  What is
their goal?

5 The evil objective of Satan and the demons is to turn people against
Jehovah God.  Hence, these wicked ones have been misleading, frightening,
and assaulting people throughout human history.  (Revelation 12:9) 
Modern-day examples confirm that demon aggression is more vicious now than
it has ever been.  To entrap people, the demons often use spiritism in all
its forms.  How do the demons use this bait, and how can you defend
yourself?

                             @{b}HOW WICKED SPIRITS@{ub}
                             @{b}TRY TO MISLEAD YOU@{ub}

6 What is spiritism?  It is involvement with demons, or wicked spirits,
either directly or through a human medium.  Spiritism does for demons what
bait does for hunters:  It attracts prey.  And just as a hunter uses a
variety of baits to lure animals into his trap, so wicked spirits encourage
various forms of spiritism to bring humans under their control.  (Compare
Psalm 119:110.)  Some of these forms are divination, magic, looking for
omens, sorcery, binding with spells, consulting mediums, and inquiring of
the dead.

7 The bait works, for spiritism attracts people around the world.  Those
living in jungle villages go to medicine men, and city office workers
consult astrologers.  Spiritism flourishes even in so-called Christian
lands.  Research indicates that in the United States alone, some 30
magazines with a combined circulation of over 10,000,000 are devoted to
various forms of spiritism.  Brazilians spend over 500 million dollars on
spiritistic items each year.  Yet, 80 percent of those frequenting
spiritistic centers of worship in that country are baptized Catholics who
also attend Mass.  Inasmuch as some clergymen practice spiritism, many
religious people think that practicing it is acceptable to God.  But is it?

                            @{b}WHY THE BIBLE CONDEMNS@{ub}
                          @{b}THE PRACTICE OF SPIRITISM@{ub}

8 If you have been taught that some forms of spiritism are menas of
contacting good spirits, you may be surprised to learn what the Bible says
about spiritism.  Jehovah's people were warned:  "Do not turn yourselves to
the spirit mediums, and do not consult professional foretellers of events,
so as to become @{i}unclean@{ui} by them."  (Leviticus 19:31; 20:6, 27)  The Bible
book of Revelation gives the warning that "those practicing spiritism" will
end up in "the lake that birns with fire and sulphur.  This means the second
[everlasting] death."  (Revelation 21:8; 22:15)  All forms of spiritism are
disapproved by Jehovah God.  (Deuteronomy 18:10-12)  Why is that the case?

9 Jehovah sent good spirits, or righteous angels, to communicate with some
humans before the Bible was completed.  Since its completion, God's Word has
provided the guidance humans need to serve Jehovah acceptably.
(2 Timothy 3:16, 17;  Hebrews 1:1-2)  He does not bypass his holy Word by
giving messages to mediums.  All such present-day messages fromt he spirit
world come from wicked spirits.  The practice of spiritism can lead to demon
harassment or even possession by wicked spirits.  Therefore, God lovingly
warns us not to get involved in any spiritistic practices.
(Deuteronomy 18:14;  Galatians 5:19-21)  Moreover, if we continued to
practice spiritism after knowing Jehovah's view of it, we would be siding
with the rebellious wicked spirits and would be enemies of God.
- 1 Samuel 15:23;  1 Chronicles 10:13-14;  Psalm 5:4.

10 One popular form of spiritism is divinaion - attempting to find out
about the future or the unknown with the help of spirits.  Some forms of
divination are astrology, crystal-ball gazing, interpretation of dreams,
palmistry, and foretune-telling with the use of tarot cards.  Many view
divination as harmless fun, but the Bible shows that foretune-tellers and
wicked spirits go hand in hand.  For example, Acts 16:16-19 mentions "a
demon of divination" that enabled a certain girl to practice "the art of
prediction."  However, her ability ro foretell the future was lost when then
demon was expelled.  Clearly, divination is a bait used by the demons to
lure people into their trap.

11 If you are grieving over the death of a beloved family member or a close
friend, you could easily be enticed by another bait.  A spirit medium may
give you special information or may speak in a voice that seems to be that
of the dead person.  Beware!  Attempts to communicate with the dead lead
into a trap.  Why?  Because the dead cannot speak.  As you no doubt recall,
God's Word plainly says that at death a person "goes back to his ground;  in
that day his thoughts do perish."  The dead "are conscious of nothing at
all."  (Psalm 146:4;  Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10)  Moreover, it is actually the
demons who have been known to imitate the voice of the deceased and give a
spirit medium information about the one who has died.  (1 Samuel 28:3-19)
So "anyone who inquires of the dead" is being entrapped by wicked spirits
and is acting contrary to the will of Jehovah God. - Deuteronomy 18:11-12;
Isaiah 8:19.

                                FROM ATTRACTING
                                 TO ATTACKING

12 When you comply with the counsel of God's Word regarding spiritism, you
spurn the bait of the demons.  (Compare Psalm 141:9-10;  Romans 12:9.)
Does this mean that wicked spirits will stop trying to capture you?  By no
means!  After tempting Jesus three times, Satan "retired from him until
another convenient time."  (Luke 4:13)  Similarly, obstinate spirits not
only attract people but also attack them.

13 Recall our earlier consideration of Satan's attack on God's servant Job.
The Devil caused the loss of his livestock and the death of most of his
servants.  Satan even killed Job's children.  Next, he struck Job himself
with a painful disease.  But Job kept his integrity to God and was greatly
blessed.  (Job 1:7-19;  2:7-8;  42:12)  Since then, the demons have made
some people speechless or blind and have continued to revel in the suffering
of humans.  (Matthew 9:32-33; 12:22;  Mark 5:2-5)  Today, reports show that
demons sexually harass some and drive others to insanity.  They incite still
others to murder and suicide, which are sins against God.
(Deuteronomy 5:17;  1 John 3:15)  Nonetheless, thousands of people once
ensnared by these wicked spirits have been able to break free.  How has this
been possible for them?  They have done so by taking vital steps.

                         HOW TO RESIST WICKED SPIRITS

14 What is one way that you can resist wicked spirits and protect yourself
and your family from their snares?  First-century Christians in Ephesis who
had practiced spiritism before becoming believers took positive steps.  We
read that "quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their
books together and burned them up before everybody."  (Acts 19:19)  Even if
you have not practiced spiritism, get rid of anything having spiritistic
uses or overtones.  This includes books, magazines, videos, posters, musical
recordings, and objects used for spiritistic purposes.  Also included are
idols, amulets and other items worn for protection, and gifts received from
practicers of spiritism.  (Deuteronomy 7:25-26;  1 Corinthians 10:21)  To
illustrate:  A married couple in Thailand had long been harassed by demons.
Then they got rid of objects associated with spiritism.  What was the
result?  They were relieved of the demonic attacks and thereafter made real
spiritual progress.

15 In order to resist wicked spirits, another necessary step is to apply
the apostle Paul's counsel to put on the complete suit of God-given
spiritual armor.  (Ephesians 6:11-17)  Christians must fortify their
defenses against wicked spirits.  What does this step include?  "Above all
things," said Paul, "take up the large shield of faith, with which you will
be able to quench all the wicked one's burning missiles."  Indeed, the
stronger your faith, the greater will be your ability to resist wicked
spirit forces. - Matthew 17:14-20.

16 How can you strengthen your faith?  By continuing to study the Bible and
apply its counsel in your life.  The strength of one's faith depends
largely on the firmness of its base - the knowledge of God.  Do you not
agree that the accurate knowledge you have gained and taken to heart as you
have studied the Bible has built up your faith?  (Romans 10:10, 17)  No
doubt, therefore, as you continue this study and make it your custom to
attend the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, your faith will be fortified
even more.  (Romans 1:11-12;  Colossians 2:6-7)  It will be a mighty
bulwark against demon attacks. - 1 John 5:5.

17 What further steps might be taken by a person who is determined to
resist wicked spirit forces?  Ephesian Christians needed protection
because they lived in a city infested with demonism.  Hence, Paul told
them:  "Carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit."  (Ephesians 6:18)
Since we live in a demon-infested world, praying intensely for God's
protection is essential in resisting wicked spirits.  (Matthew 6:13) 
Helpful in this regard is the spiritual assistance and prayers of appointed
elders in the Christian congregation. - James 5:13-15.

                            @{b}AGAINST WICKED SPIRITS@{ub}

18 Even after taking these basic steps, however, some have been troubled
by wicked spirits.  For instance, one man in Côte d'Ivoire studied the
Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses and destroyed all his amulets.  Thereafter,
he made fine progress, dedicated his life to Jehovah, and was baptized.
But a week after his baptism, the demons began to trouble him again, and
voices told him to abandon his newfound faith.  If this happened to you,
would it mean that you had lost Jehovah's protection?  Not necessarily.

19 Though the perfect man Jesus Christ had divine protection, he heard the
voice of the wicked spirit creature Satan the Devil.  Jesus showed what to
do in such a case.  He told the Devil:  "Go away, Satan!"  (Matthew 4:3-10)
In like manner, you should refuse to listen to voices from the spirit
world.  Resist wicked spirits by calling on Jehovah for help.  Yes, pray
aloud using God's name.  Proverbs 18:10 says:  "The name of Jehovah is a
strong tower.  Into it the righteous runs and is given protection."  The
Christian man in Côte d'Ivoire did this, and the wicked spirits stopped
harassing him. - Psalm 124:8; 145:18.

20 Jehovah has allowed the wicked spirits to remain in existence, but he
shows his power, particularly in behalf of his people, and his name is
being declared in all the earth.  (Exodus 9:16)  Is you stay close to God,
you need not fear wicked spirits.  (Numbers 23:21, 23;  James 4:7-8;
2 Peter 2:9)  Their power is limited.  They were punished in Noah's day,
were case out of heaven in recent times, and are now awaiting final
judgment.  (Jude 6;  Revelation 12:9; 20:1-3, 7-10, 14)  In face, they,
dread their coming destruction.  (James 2:19)  So whether wicked spirits
try to attract you with some kind of bait or attack you in any way, you
can resist them.  (2 Corinthians 2:11)  Shun every form of spiritism,
apply the counsel of God's Word, and seek Jehovah's approval.  Do this
without delay, for your life depends on your resisting wicked spirit
forces!

@node "Chapter13" "Why Living A Godly Life Brings Happiness"

                             @{b}WHY LIVING A GODLY@{ub}
                           @{b}LIFE BRINGS HAPPINESS@{ub}

1 JEHOVAH is "the happy God," and he wants you to enjoy life.
(1 Timothy 1:11)  By walking in his way, you can benefit yourself and
experience tranquillity that is deep and lasting, like an ever-flowing
river.  Walking in God's way also moves one to perform continuous acts of
righteousness, "like the waves of the sea."  This bring true happiness.
- Isaiah 48:17-18.

2 Some may object, `People sometimes suffer for doing what is right.'
True, and that is what happened to Jesus' apostles.  Although persecuted,
however, they rejoiced and went on "declaring the good news about Christ."
(Acts 5:40-42)  We can learn important lessions from this.  One is that
our living a godly life does not guarantee that we will always be treated
well.  "In fact," wrote the apostle Paul, "all those desiring to live with
godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted."
(2 Timothy 3:12)  The reason for this is that Satan and his world are
opposed to those who live in a godly way.  (John 15:18-19;  1 Peter 5:8)
But genuine happiness is not dependent on external things.  Rather it
comes from a conviction that we are doing what is right and therefore
have God's smile of approval. - Matthew 5:10-12;  James 1:2-3;
1 Peter 4:13-14.

3 There are people who feel that they can earn God's favor through
occasional acts of devotion but can forget about him at other times.
True worship of Jehovah God is not like that.  It affects a person's
conduct throughout all his waking hours, from day to day, year after
year.  That is why it is also called "The Way."  (Acts 19:9;
Isaiah 30:21)  It is a godly way of living that calls upon us to speak
and act in harmony with God's Word.

4 When new students of the Bible see that they need to make some changes
in order to please Jehovah, they may wonder, `Is a godly life really
worth living?'  You can be sure that it is.  Why?  Because "God is love,"
and his ways are therefore meant to benefit us.  (1 John 4:8)  God is
also wise and knows what is best for us.  Since Jehovah God is almighty,
he is able to strengthen us to fulfill our desire to please him by
breaking a bad habit.  (Philippians 4:13)  Let us consider some
principles involved in godly living and see how applying them brings
happiness.

                         HONESTY RESULTS IN HAPPINESS

5 Jehovah is "the God of truth." (Psalm 31:5) No doubt, you desire to
follow his example and be known as a truthful person.  Honesty leads to
self-respect and a feeling of well-being.  Because dishonesty is so
common in this sinful world, however, Christians need this reminder:
"Speak truth each one of you with his neighbor . . . Let the stealer
steal no more, but rather let him do hard work . . . that he may have
something to distribute to someone in need."  (Ephesians 4:25, 28)
Christian employees do an honest day's work.  Unless their employer
gives permission, they do not take things that belong to him.  Whether
at work, in school, or at home, a worshipper of Jehovah must be `honest
in all things.' (Hebrews 13:18)  Anyone who makes it a practice to lie
or steal cannot have God's favor. - Deuteronomy 5:19;  Revelatin 21:8.

6 Being honest results in many blessings.  Selina is a needy African
widow who loves Jehovah God and his righteous principles.  One day, she
found a bag containing a bankbook and a large sum of money.  Using a
telephone directory, she was able to find the owner - a storekeeper who
had been robbed.  The man could not believe his eyes when Selina, though
quite sick, visited him and returned the full contents of the bag.  "Such
honesty must be rewarded," he said and hander her a sum of money.  More
important, this man praised Selina's religion.  Yes, honesty deeds adorn
Bible teaching, glorify Jehovah God, and bring happiness to his honest
worshippers. - Titus 2:10;  1 Peter 2:12.

                         GENEROSITY BRINGS HAPPINESS

7 There is happiness in being generous, whereas greedy persons will not
inherit God's kingdom."  (1 Corinthians 6:10)  A common form of greed is
gambling, which is an attempt to make money through the losses of others.
Jehovah does not approve of those who are "greedy of dishonest gain."
(1 Timothy 3:8)  Even where gambling is legal and a person gambles for
fun, he could become addicted and be promoting a practice that has ruined
many lives.  Gambling often brings hardship to the gambler's family, who
may be left with little money to buy such necessities as food and
clothing. - 1 Timothy 6:10.

8 Because of their loving generosity, Christians find joy in assisting
others, especially needy fellow believers.  (James 2:15-16)  Before Jesus
came to earth, he observed God's generosity toward mankind. (Acts 14:16-17)
Jesus himself gave his time, his talents, and even his life in behalf of
humankind.  Hence, he was well qualified to say:  "There is more happiness
in giving than in receiving."  (Acts 20:35)  Jesus also spoke well of the
poor widow who generously put two small coins in the temple treasure
chest, for she gave "her whole living."  (Mark 12:41-44)  The ancient
Israelites and the first-century Christians provide examples of joyful
generosity in giving material support to the congregation and the kingdom
work.  (1 Chronicles 29:9;  2 Corinthians 9:11-14)  In addition to making
material contributions for these purposes, present-day Christians happily
offer praise to God and use their lives in his service.  (Romans 12:1;
Hebrews 13:15)  Jehovah blesses them for using their time, energy, and
other resources, including their funds, to support true worship and
promote the worldwide work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom.
- Proverbs 3:9-10.

                       @{b}OTHER FACTORS PROMOTING HAPPINESS@{ub}

9 To be happy, Christians must also `guard their thinking abilities.'
(Proverbs 5:1-2)  This requires that they read and meditate on God's Word
and wholesome Bible literature.  But there are things to avoid.  For
instance, excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages can make a person
lose control of his thinking.  In such a state, many people get involved
in immoral behavior, act violently, and cause deadly accidents.  No
wonder the Bible says that drunkards will not inherit God's Kingdom!
(1 Corinthians 6:10)  Determined to stay "sound in mind," true Christians
avoid drunkenness, and this helps to promote happiness among them.
- Titus 2:2-6.

10 A clean body contributes to happiness.  Yet, many become addicted to
harmful substances.  For example, consider the use of tobacco.  The
World Health Organisation reports that smoking "kills three million
people each year."  Breaking the tobacco habit can be difficult because
of temporary withdrawal symptoms.  On the other hand, many ex-smokers
find that they have better health and more money for household needs.
Yes, overcoming the tobacco habit or addiction to other harmful substances
will contribute to a clean body, a clear conscience, and true happiness.
- 2 Corinthians 7:1.

                            HAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE

11 Those living together as husband and wife should make sure that their
marriage had been properly registered with the civil authorities.
(Mark 12:17)  They also need to view wedlock as a serious responsibility.
True, seperation might become necessary in cases of willful nonsupport,
extreme abuse, or the absolute endangerment of spirituality.
(1 Timothy 5:8;  Galatians 5:19-21)  But the apostle Paul's words at
1 Corinthians 7:10-17 encourage marriage mates to stay together.  For
true happiness, of course, they must be faithful to each other.  Paul
wrote:  "Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed
without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers." 
(Hebrews 13:4)  The term "marriage bed" denotes sexual intercourse
between a man and woman legally married to each other.  No other sexual
relationship, such as marriage to more than one wife, can be described as
"honorable among all."  Moreover, the Bible condemns premarital
intercourse and homosexuality. - Romans 1:26-27;  1 Corinthians 6:18.

12 Fornication may bring a few moments of physical pleasure, but it does
not result in true happiness.  It displeases God and can scar the person's
conscience.  (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5)  The sad consequences of illegitimate
sex may be AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  "It has been
estimates that more than 250 million people worldwide are infected
annually with gonorrhoea, and about 50 million with syphilis," states
one medical report.  There is also the problem of unwanted pregnancies.
The International Planned Parenthood Federation reports that, around the
world, more than 15 million girls between the ages of 15 and 19 become
pregnant each year, and a third of them have abortions.  A study showed
they in one African country, abortion complications result in 72 percent
of all deaths among teenage girls.  Some fornicators may escape disease
and pregnancy but not emotional damage.  Many lose their self-respect and
even hate themselves.

13 Although adultery may be forgiven, it is a valid Scriptural basis for
@{"divorce" alink "divorce"} on the part of the innocent mate.  (Matthew 5:32;
compare Hosea 3:1-5.)  When such immorality results in the breakup of a
marriage, this may leave deep emotional scars on the innocent mate and
on the children.  For the good of the human family, God's Word points
out that his adverse judgement will come upon unrepentant fornicators
and adulterers.  Moreover, it clearly shows that those who practice
sexual immorality "will not inherit God's Kingdom." - Galatians 5:19-21.

                            "NO PART OF THE WORLD"

14 Those desiring to please Jehovah and enjoy Kingdom blessings avoid
idolatry in any form.  The Bible shows that it is wrong to make and
worship images, including those of Christ, or Jesus' mother, Mary.
(Exodus 20:4-5;  1 John 5:21)  So, true Christians do not venerate icons,
crosses, and images.  They also avoid more subtle forms of idolatry, such
as acts of devotion to flags and the singing of songs that glorify
nations.  When pressured to perform such acts, they recall Jesus' words
to Satan:  "It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and to him alone
you must render sacred service."  (Matthew 4:8-10)  Jesus said that his
followers are "no part of the world." (John 17:14)  This means being
neutral in political affairs and living peacefully in harmony with
Isaiah 2:4, which says:  "He [Jehovah God] will certainly render
judgement among the nations and set matters straight respecting many
peoples.  And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and
their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, neither will they learn war anymore."

15 Being "no part of the world" also means breaking off all association
with "Babylon the Great," the world empire of false religion.  Unclean
worship spread from ancient Babylon until it held harmful spiritual
dominion over people earth wide.  "Babylon the Great" embraces all
religions whose doctrines and practices are out of harmony with the
knowledge of God.  (Revelation 17:1, 5, 15)  No faithful worshiper of
Jehovah will engage in interfaith activities by sharing in worship with
different religions or by having spiritual fellowship with any part of
Babylon the Great.  (Numbers 25:1-9;  2 Corinthians 6:14)  Consequently,
many new Bible Students send a letter of resignation to the religious
organisation to which they belong.  This has brought them closer to the
true God, as promised:  "Get out from among them, and seperate
yourselves,' says Jehovah, `and quit touching the unclean thing';  `and
I will take you in.'"  (2 Corinthians 6:17;  Revelation 18:4-5)  Is not
such acceptance by our heavenly Father what you keenly desire?

                          WEIGHING ANNUAL OBSERVANCES

16 A godly life frees us from the often burdensome celebrating of worldly
holidays.  For instance, the Bible does not reveal the exact day of
Jesus' birth.  `I thought Jesus was born on December 25!' some may
exclaim.  This is not possible because he died in the @{i}spring@{ui} of 33 @{"C.E." alink "CE"}
at 33 ½ years of age.  Moreoverm at the time of his birth, shepherds were
"living our of doors and keeping watches in the night over their flocks."
(Luke 2:8)  In the land of Israel, late December is cold, rainy season
during which sheep would be kept in shelters overnight to protect them
from the winter weather.  Actually, December 25 was set aside by the
Romans as the birthday of their sun god.  Centuries after Jesus was on
earth, apostate Christians adopted this date for the celebration of
Christ's birth.  Consequently, true Christians do not celebrate Christmas
or any other holiday based on false religious beliefs.  Because they give
Jehovah exclusive devotion, they also do not observe holidays that
idolize sinful humans or nations.

17 The Bible specifically mentions only two birthday observances, both
involving men who did not serve God.  (Genesis 40:20-22;
Matthew 14:6-11)  Since the Scriptures do not reveal the birth date of
the perfect man Jesus Christ, why should we give special attention to
the birthdays of imperfect humans?  (Ecclesiastes 7:1)  Of course, godly
parents do not await a special day to show their children love.  A 13-year
old Christian girl remarked:  "My family and I have lots of fun . . . I'm
very close to my parents, and when other kids ask why I don't celebrate
holidays, I tell them that I celebrate every day."  Said a Christian
youth aged 17:  "In our house, gift giving is all year long."  Greater
happiness results when gifts are given spontaneously.

18 For those pursuing a godly life, there is only one day each year to
be specifically observed.  It is the Lord's Evening Meal, often called
the Memorial of Christ's death.  Concerning it, Jesus commanded his
followers:  "Keep doing this in rememberance of me."  (Luke 22:19-20;
1 Corinthians 11:23-25)  When Jesus instituted this meal on the night of
Nisan 14, 33 @{"C.E." alink "CE"}, he used unleavened bread and red wine, representing
his sinless human body and his perfect blood.  (Matthew 26:26-29)  These
emblems are partaken of only by Christians annointed with God's holy
spirit.  They have been taken into the new covenant and the covenant for
the Kingdom, and they have a heavenly hope.  (Luke 12:32;  22:20, 28-30;
Romans 8:16-17;  Revelation 14:1-5)  Nevertheless, benefits are
experienced by all those present on the evening that corresponds with
Nisan 14 on the ancient Jewish calendar.  They are reminded of the love
shown by Jehovah God and Jesus Christ in the sin-atoning ransom sacrifice
that makes eternal life possible for those having divine favor.
- Matthew 20:28;  John 3:16.

                          EMPLOYMENT AND ENTERTAINMENT

19 True Christians are under obligation to work hard and provide for
their needs.  Accomplishing this brings family heads a feeling of
satisfaction. (1 Thessalonians 4:11-12)  Of course, if a Christian's
employment conflicted with the Bible, this would rob him of happiness.
Yet, it is sometimes difficult for a Christian to find employment that
is in harmony with Bible standards.  For instance, some employees are
required to deceive customers.  On the other hand, many employers will
make concessions to accomodate the conscience of an honest worker, not
wanting to lost a trustworthy employee.  Whatever develops, however,
you can be sure that God will bless your efforts to find employment that
leaves you with a clean conscience. - 2 Corinthians 4:2

20 Since God wants his servants to be happy, we need to balance hard
work with refreshing periods of recreation and rest.  (Mark 6:31;
Ecclesiastes 3:12-13)  Satan's world promotes ungodly entertainment.
But to please God, we must be selective about books we read, radio
programs and music we listen to, and concerts, films, plays, television
programs, and videos we watch.  If the entertainment we chose in the past
conflicts with the warnings in such scriptures such as
Deuteronomy 18:10-12, Psalm 11:5, and Ephesians 5:3-5, we will please
Jehovah and will be happier if we make adjustments.

                          RESPECT FOR LIFE AND BLOOD

21 For true happiness, we need to view human life as sacred, even as
Jehovah does.  His Word forbits us to commit murder.  (Matthew 19:16-18)
In fact, God's Law to Israel shows that he views the fetus as a precious
life - not something to be destroyed.  (Exodus 21:22-23)  For that
matter, we must not treat life as something cheap by using tobacco,
abusing our body with drugs or alcohol, or taking needless risks.
Neither should we engage in any life-threatening pursuits nor should we
ignore safety precautions, which might result in bloodguilt.
- Deuteronomy 22:8

22 Jehovah told Noah and his family that blood represents the soul, or
life.  Therefore, God forbade them to eat any blood.  (Genesis 9:3-4)
Since we are their descendants, that law is binding upon all of us.
Jehovah told the Israelites that blood was to be poured out on the
ground and was not to be used for man's own purposes.
(Deuteronomy 12:15-16)  And God's law on blood was reiterated when first-
century Christians were instructed:  "Keep abstaining . . . from blood."
(Acts 15:28-29)  Out of respect for the sanctity of life, godly people
do not accept blood transfusions, even if others insist that such a
procedure would be lifesaving.  Many medical alternatives acceptable to
Jehovah's Witnesses have proved to be very effective and do not expose
one to the hazards of blood transfusions.  Christians know that only
Jesus' shed blood is truly lifesaving.  Faith in it brings forgiveness
and the prospect of eternal life. - Ephesians 1:7.

23 Clearly, living a godly life requires effort.  It may result in
ridicule from family members or acquaintances, (Matthew 10:32-39;
1 Peter 4:4)  But the rewards of living such a life far outweigh any
trials.  It results in a clean conscience and provides wholesome
companionship with fellow worshippers of Jehovah.  (Matthew 19:27, 29)
Then, too, imagine living forever in God's righteous new world.
(Isaiah 65:17-18)  And what joy there is in complying with Bible counsel
and this making Jehovah's heart rejoice!  (Proverbs 27:11)  No wonder
that living a godly life brings happiness! - Psalm 128:1-2.

@node "Chapter14" "Whose Authority Should You Recognise?"

                               @{b}WHOSE AUTHORITY@{ub}
                                 @{b}SHOULD YOU@{ub}
                                 @{b}RECOGNIZE?@{ub}

1 "AUTHORITY" is a distasteful word to many people.  This is
understandable, for authority if often abused - on the job, in the family,
and by governments.  The Bible realistically says:  "Man has dominated
man to his injury."  (Ecclesiases 8:9)  Yes, many have dominated others by
acting in a tyrannical and self-serving manner.

2 But not all authority is injurious.  For example, it might be said that
our body exercises authority over us.  It "orders" us to breathe, eat,
drink, and sleep.  Is this oppressive?  No.  Compliance with these demands
is for our good.  While submission to our bodily needs may be involuntary,
there are other forms of authority that require our @{i}willing@{ui} subjection.
Consider some examples.

                           THE SUPREME AUTHORITY

3 Over 300 times in the Bible, Jehovah is called "Sovereign Lord."  A
sovereign is one who possesses supreme authority.  What gives Jehovah the
right to this status?  Revelation 4:11 answers:  "You are worthy, Jehovah,
even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because
you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were
created."

4 As our Creator, Jehovah has the right to exercise his authority as he
chooses.  This might seem frightening, especially when we consider that
God has an "abundance of dynamic energy."  He is called "God Almighty"
- a term that in Hebrew conveys the idea of overpowering strength.
(Isaiah 40:26;  Genesis 17:1)  Yet, Jehovah shows his strength in a
benevolent way, for his dominant quality is love. - 1 John 4:16.

5 Although Jehovah warned that he would bring punishment upon unrepentant
wrongdoers, Moses knew him principally as "the true God, the faithful God,
keeping covenant and loving-kindness in the case of those who love him and
those who keep his commandments."  (Deuteronomy 7:9)  Just imagine!  The
Supreme Authority of the universe does not force us to serve him.  Rather,
we are drawn to him because of his love.  (Romans 2:4; 5:8)  Submitting to
Jehovah's authority is even a pleasure, for his laws always work to our
ultimate benefit. - Psalm 19:7-8.

6 Our first parents rejected God's sovereignty.  They wanted to decide
for themselves what was good and what was bad.  (Genesis 3:4-6)  As a
result, they were ousted from their Paradise home.  Jehovah thereafter
allowed humans to create authority structures that would enable them to
live in an orderly, though imperfect, society.  What are some of these
authorities, and to what degree does God expect us to submit to them?

                         "THE SUPERIOR AUTHORITIES"

7 The apostle Paul wrote:  "Let every soul be in subjection to the superior
authorities, for there is no authority except by God."  Who are the
"superior authorities"?  Paul's words in succeeding verses show that they
are human governmental authorities.  (Romans 13:1-7;  Titus 3:1)  Jehovah
did not originate man's governmental authorities, but they exist by his
permission.  So Paul could write:  "The existing authorities stand placed
in their relative positions by God."  What does this indicate about such
earthly authority?  That it is subordinate, or inferior, to God's
authority.  (John 19:10-11)  Therefore, when there is a conflict between
man's law and God's law, Christians must be guided by their Bible-trained
conscience.  They "must obey God as ruler rather than men." - Acts 5:29.

8 Much of the time, however, the governmental superior authorities act as
`God's minister to us for our good.'  (Romans 13:4)  In what ways?  Well,
think of the numerous services that the superior authorities provide, such
as mail delivery, police and fire protection, sanitation, and education. 
"That is why you are also paying taxes," wrote Paul, "for they are God's
public servants constantly serving this very purpose." (Romans 13:6)  With
regard to taxes or any other legal obligation, we should "conduct ourselves
honestly." - Hebrews 13:18.

9 At times, the superior authorities misuse their power.  Does this
absolve us of our responsibility to remain in subjection to them?
No, it does not.  Jehovah sees the misdeeds of these authorities.
(Proverbs 15:3)  His toleration of man's rule does not mean that he winks
at its corruption; nor does he expect us to do so.  Indeed, God will soon
"crush and put an end to all these kingdoms," replacing them with the rule
of his own righteous government.  (Daniel 2:44)  But until this occurs, the
superior authorities serve a useful purpose.

10 Paul explained:  "He who opposes the authority has taken a stand
against the arrangement of God."  (Romans 13:2)  The superior authorities
are God's "arrangement" in that they preserve a measure of order, without
which chaos and anarchy would reign.  Opposing them would be unscriptural
and senseless.  To illustrate:  Imagine that you had undergone surgery and
stitches were securing the wound.  Though the stitches are foreign to the
body, they serve a purpose for a limited time.  Removing them prematurely
could be harmful.  Similarly, human governmental authorities were not part
of God's original purpose.  Until his Kingdom is ruling the earth
completely, however, human governments hold society together, performing a
function that fits in with God's will for the present time.  We should
thus remain in subjection to the superior authorities, while we are giving
priority to God's law and authority.

                            AUTHORITY IN THE FAMILY

11 The family is the basic unit of human society.  Within it a husband
and a wife can find rewarding companionship, and children can be
safeguarded and trained for adulthood. (Proverbs 5:15-21; Ephesians 5:1-4)
Such a notable arrangement needs to be organized in a way that enables
family members to love in peace and harmony.  Jehovah's way of
accomplishing this is through the principle of headship, summed up in
these words, found at 1 Corinthians 11:3:  "The head of every man is the
Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the
Christ is God."

12 The husband is the family head.  However, there is a head above him -
Jesus Christ.  Paul wrote:  "Husbands, continue loving your wives, just
as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for
it."  (Ephesians 5:25)  A husband reflects his subjection to Christ when
he treats his wife in the way that Jesus has always treated the
congregation.  (1 John 2:6)  Great authority has been conferred upon
Jesus, but he exercises it with the utmost gentleness, love, and
reasonableness.  (Matthew 20:25-28)  As a man, Jesus never abused his
position of authority.  He was "mild-tempered and lowly in heart," and he
called his followers "friends" rather than "slaves."  "I will refresh you,"
he promised them, and that is what he did. - Matthew 11:28-29; John 15:15.

13 Jesus' example teaches husbands that Christian headship is not a
position of harsh domination.  Instead, it is one of respect and
self-sacrificing love.  This would clearly rule out mistreating a mate
physically or verbally.  (Ephesians 4:29, 31-32; 5:28-29; Colossians 3:19)
If a Christian man were this to mistreat his wife, his other good works
would be valueless, and his prayers would be hindered.
- 1 Corinthians 13:1-3;  1 Peter 3:7.

14 When a husband imitates Christ's example, it is easier for his wife to
comply with the words of Ephesians 5:22-23:  "Let wives be in subjection
to their husbands as to the Lord, because a husband is head of his wife as
the Christ also is head of the congregation body."  Just as a husband is
to be submissive to Christ, a wife must be in subjection to her husband.
The Bible also makes it clear that capable wives merit honor and praise
for their godly wisdom and industriousness. - Proverbs 31:10-31.

15 A Christian wife's subjection to her husband is relative.  This means
that God rather than man must be obeyed if submitting in a certain matter
would result in violating divine law.  Even then, a wife's firm stand
should be tempered with a "quiet and mild spirit."  It should be evident
that the knowledge of God has made her a better wife.  (1 Peter 3:1-4)
The same would be true of a Christian man whose wife is an unbeliever.
His compliance with Bible principles should make him a better husband.

16 Ephesians 6:1 outlines the role of children, stating:  "Be obedient to
your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous."  Christian
children follow the example of Jesus, who remained subject to his parents
as he grew up.  As an obedient boy, he "went on progressing in wisdom and
in physical growth and in favor with God and men." - Luke 2:51-52.

17 The way parents handle their responsibilities may have a bearing on
whether their children will respect authority or will rebel against it.
(Proverbs 22:6)  So parents might well ask themselves, `Do I exercise my
authority lovingly or harshly?  Am I permissive?'  A godly parent is
expected to be loving and considerate, yet firm in adhering to godly
principles.  Appropriately, Paul wrote:  "Fathers, do not be irritating
your children [literally, `provoking them to wrath'], but go on bringing
them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah."
- Ephesians 6:4;  Colossians 3:21.

18 Parents should scrutinize their training methods, especially if they
desire that their children be obedient and thus bring them joy.
(Proverbs 23:24-25)  In the Bible, discipline is primarily a form of
instruction.  (Proverbs 4:1; 8:33)  It is linked with love and mildness,
not with anger and brutality.  Hence, Christian parents need to act with
wisdom and keep themselves under restraint when disciplining their
children. - Proverbs 1:7.

                         AUTHORITY IN THE CONGREGATION

19 Since Jehovah is an orderly God, it is reasonable that he would provide
authoritative, and well-organised leadership for his people.  Accordingly,
he has appointed Jesus as the Head of the Christian congregation.
(1 Corinthians 14:33, 40;  Ephesians 1:20-23)  Under Christ's invisible
leadership, God has authorized an arrangement by which appointed elders
in each congregation shepherd the flock eagerly, willingly, and lovingly.
(1 Peter 5:2-3)  Ministerial servants assist them in various ways and
render valuable service within the congregation. - Philippians 1:1.

20 Regarding Christian elders, Paul wrote:  "Be obedient to those who are
taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch
over your souls as those who will render an account;  that they may do
this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you."
(Hebrews 13:17)  Wisely, God has entrusted to Christian overseers the
responsibility to care for the spiritual needs of those in the
congregation.  These elders do not constitute a clergy class.  They are
servants and slaves of God, ministering to the needs of their fellow
worshippers, just as our Master, Jesus Christ, did.  (John 10:14-15)
Knowing that Scripturally qualified men take an interest in our progress
and spiritual growth encourages us to be cooperative and submissive.
- 1 Corinthians 16:16.

21 At times, sheep may stray or become endangered by harmful worldly
elements.  Under the leadership of the Chief Shepherd, elders as
undershepherds are alert to the needs of those in their charge and
diligently give them personal attention.  (1 Peter 5:4)  They visit
members of the congregation and offer words of encouragement.  Knowing
that the Devil seeks to disrupt the peace of God's people, elders
exercise the wisdom from above in dealing with any problems.
(James 3:17-18)  They work hard to maintain unity and oneness of faith,
something for which Jesus himself prayed. - John 17:20-22;
1 Corinthians 1:10.

22 What if a Christian suffers some evil or becomes discouraged because
of committing a sin?  Soothing Bible counsel and the elders' heartfelt
prayers in his behalf can help to restore him to spiritual health.
(James 5:13-15)  These men, appointed by holy spirit, also have the
authority to administer discipline and reprove any who pursue a course
of wrongdoing or who pose a danger to the spiritual and moral cleanness
of the congregation.  (Acts 20:28;  Titus 1:9; 2:15)  In order to keep
the congregatin clean, it may be necessary for individuals to report
serious wrongdoing.  (Leviticus 5:1)  If a Christian who has committed
a grave sin accepts Scriptural discipline and reproof and gives evidence
of genuine repentance, he will be helped.  Of course, persistent and
unrepentnt violators of God's law are disfellowshipped.
- 1 Corinthians 5:9-13.

23 The Bible foretold that under Jesus Christ as King, spiritually
mature men would be appointed to provide comfort, protection, and
refreshment for God's people.  (Isaiah 32:1-2)  They would take the lead
as evangelizers, shepherds, and teachers in order to promote spiritual
growth.  (Ephesians 4:11-12, 16)  Although Christian overseers may at
times reprove, reprimand, and exhort fellow believers, application of the
elders' healthful teaching based on God's Word helps to keep all on the
road to life. - Proverbs 3:11-12;  6:23;  Titus 2:1.

                      ACCEPT JEHOVAH'S VIEW OF AUTHORITY

24 The first man and woman were tested over the issue of subjection to
authority.  Not surprisingly, a similar test faces us daily.  Satan the
Devil has promoted a spirit of rebellion among mankind.  (Ephesians 2:2)
The course of independence is made to appear enticingly superior to that
of subjection.

25 We must, however, reject the world's rebellious spirit.  In doing so,
we will find that godly subjection brings rich rewards.  For instance, we
will avoid the anxieties and frustrations common to those who court
trouble with the secular authorities.  We will reduce the friction that is
prevalent in many families.  And we will enjoy the benefits of warm,
loving association with out Christian fellow believers.  Most of all, our
godly subjection will result in a good relationship with Jehovah, the
Supreme Authority.

                              @{b}@{u}BUILDING A FAMILY@{ub}@{uu}
                               @{b}@{u}THAT HONORS GOD@{ub}@{uu}

1 SUPPOSE you plan to build your own home.  You purchase the land.  With
keep anticipation, you see your new house in your mind's eye.  But what
if you have no tools and no building skills?  How frustrating your efforts
would be!

2 Many couples enter marriage envisioning a happy family, yet possess
neither the tools nor the skills needed to build one.  Shortly after the
wedding day, negative patterns develop.  Fighting and bickering become a
daily routine.  When children are born, the new father and mother find
themselves no more skilled at parenthood than they are at marriage.

3 Happily, however, the Bible can help.  Its principles are like tools
that enable you to build a happy family.  (Proverbs 24:3)  Let us see how.

                             TOOLS FOR BUILDING
                              A HAPPY MARRIAGE

4 No matter how well-matched a married couple seem to be, they differ in
emotional makeup, childhood experiences, and family background.
Therefore, some problems are to be expected after marriage.  How will
they be handled?  Well, when builders construct a house, they consult the
plans.  These are guidelines to be followed.  The Bible provides God's
Standards for building a happy family.  Let us now examine a few of these.

5 @{i}Loyalty.@{ui}  Jesus said:  "What God has yoked together let no man
put apart."@{" * " alink "Divorce"} (Matthew 19:6)  The apostle Paul wrote:  "Let marriage be
honorable among all, and the marriage bed without defilement, for God
will judge fornicators and adulterers."  (Hebrews 13:4)  Married persons
should therefore feel an obligation toward Jehovah to remain faithful to
their mates. - Genesis 39:7-9.

6 Loyalty accords the marriage dignity and security.  Loyal spouses know
that, come what may, they will support each other.  (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12)
How different from those who abandon their marriage at the first hint of
trouble!  Such individuals quickly conclude that they `chose the wrong
person,' that they have `fallen out of love,' that a new mate is the
cure.  But this gives neither spouse opportunity to grow.  Instead, such
disloyal ones may carry the same problems to new partners.  When a person
has a fine home but finds that the roof is leaking, surely he tries to
repair it.  He does not just move to another house.  Similarly, changing
a mate is not the way to solve issues that lie beneath the marital strife.
When problems arise, do not try to get out of the marriage, but work very
hard to preserve it.  Such loyalty treats the union as something worth
guarding, maintaining, and cherishing.

7 @{i}Communication.@{ui}  "There is a frustrating of plans where there is no
confidential talk," says a Bible proverb.  (Proverbs 15:22)  Yet,
communicating is difficult for some married couples.  Why is that the case?
Because people have different communication styles.  This is a fact that
often leads to considerable misunderstanding and frustration.  Upbringing
may play a role in this.  For example, some may have been raised in an
atmosphere of parental bickering.  Now as married adults, they may not
know how to speak to their mate in a kind and loving way.  Nevertheless,
your home need not deteriorate into `a house full of quarreling.'
(Proverbs 17:1)  The Bible stresses putting on "the new personality," and
it does not condone malicious bitterness, screaming, and abusive speech.
- Ephesians 4:22-24, 31.

8 What can you do when there are disagreements?  If tempers begin to flare,
you may do well to follow the advice of Proverbs 17:14:  "Before the
quarrel has burst forth, take your leave."  Yes, you might suspend the
discussion until later, when both you and your mate have cooled off.
(Ecclesiastes 3:1, 7)  In any case, endeavor to be "swift about hearing,
slow about speaking, slow about wrath."  (James 1:19)  Your goal should be
to remedy the situation, not to win the argument.  (Genesis 13:8-9)
Choose words and a manner of speaking that will calm you and your mate.
(Proverbs 12:18;  15:1, 4;  29:11)  Above all, do not remain in a provoked
state, but seek help by communicating with God in humble prayer together.
- Ephesians 4:26-27;  6:18.

9 A Bible proverb says:  "The heart of the wise one causes his mouth to
show insight, and to his lips it adds persuasiveness."  (Proverbs 16:23)
Really, then, the key to successful communication is in the heart, not in
the mouth.  What is your attitude toward your mate?  The Bible encourages
Christians to show "fellow feeling."  (1 Peter 3:8)  Can you do this when
your marriage partner experiences distressing anxiety?  If so, it will
help you to know how to answer. - Isaiah 50:4.

10 Honor and Respect.  Christian husbands are told to dwell with their
wives "according to the knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker
vessel, the feminine one."  (1 Peter 3:7)  Honoring one's wife involves
recognizing her value.  A husband who dwells with his wife "according to
the knowledge" has high regard for her feelings, strengths, intelligence
and dignity.  He should also want to learn how Jehovah views women and
wants them to be treated.

11 In your house, let us say that you have a very useful container that
is especially delicate.  Would you not treat it with great care?  Well,
Peter used the term "weaker vessel" in a similar vein, and this should
move a Christian husband to manifest tender regard for his beloved wife.

12 But what counsel does the Bible give a wife?  Paul wrote:  "The wife
should have deep respect for her husband."  (Ephesians 5:33)  Just as a
wife needs to sense that she is honored and dearly loved by her mate, a
husband needs to feel that he is respected by his wife.  A respectful
wife would not thoughtlessly broadcast her husband's faults, whether he
is a Christian or not.  She would no strip him of his dignity by
criticizing and belittling him either privately or publicly.
- 1 Timothy 3:11;  5:13.

13 This does not mean that a wife cannot express her opinions.  If
something disturbs her, she can respectfully give voice to it.
(Genesis 21:9-12)  Conveying an idea to her husband might be likened to
throwing a ball to him.  She can toss it gently so that he can easily
catch it, or she can fling it with such force that it injures him.  How
much better it is when both mates avoid hurling accusations but, rather,
speak in a kind and gentle manner! - Matthew 7:12;  Colossians 4:6;
1 Peter 3:3-4.

14 As we have seen, Bible principles can help you to build a happy
marriage.  But what if your mate shows little interest in what the Bible
has to say?  Much can still be accomplished if you apply the knowledge
of God in @{i}your@{ui} role.  Peter wrote:  "You wives, be in subjection to your
own husbands, in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may
be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having
been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect."
(1 Peter 3:1-2)  Of course, the same would apply to a husband whose wife
is indifferent toward the Bible.  Regardless of what your mate chooses to
do, let Bible principles make @{i}you@{ui} a better spouse.  The knowledge of God
can also make you a better parent.

                          REARING CHILDREN ACCORDING
                           TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

15 Merely possessing a saw or a hammer does not make one a skilled
carpenter.  Likewise, simply having children does not make one a skilled
parent.  Knowingly or unknowingly, parents often bring up their children
the way they themselves were brought up.  Thus, faulty parenting techniques
are sometimes passed on from one generation to the next.  An ancient Hebrew
proverb says:  "Fathers are the ones that eat unripe grapes, but it is the
teeth of the sons that get set on edge."  Yet, the Scriptures show that a
person does not have to follow the course set out by his parents.  He can
choose a different path, one influenced by Jehovah's statutes.
- Ezekiel 18:2, 14, 17.

16 Jehovah expects Christian parents to give their children proper
guidance and care.  Paul wrote:  "Certainly if anyone does not provide for
those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his
household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without
faith."  (1 Timothy 5:8)  What strong words!  Fulfilling your role as a
provider, which includes caring for your children's physical, spiritual,
and emotional needs, is a godly person's privilege and responsibility.
The Bible furnishes principles that can help parents build a happy
environment for their children.  Consider some of these.

17 @{i}Set a fine example.@{ui}  Israelite parents were commanded:  "You
must inculcate [God's words] in your son and speak of them when you sit in
your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when
you get up."  Parents were to teach God's standards to their children.
But this injunction was prefaced by the statement:  "These words that I
am commanding you today must prove to be on @{i}your heart.@{ui}"
(Deuteronomy 6:6-7)  Yes, parents cannot give what they do not have.
God's laws must first be inscribed on your own hearts if you want to have
them written on the hearts of your children. - Proverbs 20:7;
compare Luke 6:40.

18 @{i}Provide assurance of your love.@{ui}  At Jesus' baptism, Jehovah
declared: "You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you." (Luke 3:22)
Jehovah thus acknowledged his Son, freely expressing approval of him and
giving assurance of His love.  Jesus later said to his Father:  "You
loved me before the founding of the world."  (John 17:24)  As godly
parents, then, give your children verbal and physical expressions of
your love for them - and do this often.  Always remember that "love builds
up." - 1 Corinthians 8:1.

19 @{i}Discipline.@{ui}  The Bible stresses the importance of loving
discipline.  (Proverbs 1:8)  Parents who shirk their responsibility to
guide thier children today will almost certainly face heartbreaking
consequences tomorrow.  Yet, parents are also cautioned against going to
the other extreme.  "You fathers," wrote Paul, "do not be exasperating
your children, so as they do not become downhearted."  (Colossians 3:21)
Parents must avoid overcorrecting their children or constantly harping on
their shortcomings and criticizing their efforts.

20 Jehovah God, our heavenly Father, sets the example in providing
discipline.  His correction is never extreme.  "I shall have to chastise
you to the proper degree," God told his people.  (Jeremiah 46:28)
Parents should imitate Jehovah in this regard.  Discipline that exceeds
reasonable limits or that goes beyond the intended purpose of correcting
and teaching is surely exasperating.

21 How can parents determine whether their discipline is effective?  They
might ask themselves, `What does my discipline accomplish?'  It should
teach.  Your child should understand why discipline is being administered.
Parents should also be concerned about the aftereffects of their
correction.  True, almost all children will at first chafe at discipline.
(Hebrews 12:11)  But discipline should never make a child feel frightened
or abandoned or leave him with the impression that he is inherently
wicked.  Before correcting his people, Jehovah said:  "Do not be afraid,
. . . for I am with you."  (Jeremiah 46:28)  Yes, correction should be
administered in such a way that your child senses that you are with him
or her as loving, supportive parents.

                        ACQUIRING "SKILLFUL DIRECTION"

22 We can be grateful that Jehovah has provided the tools we need to
build a happy family.  But simply possessing the tools is not enough.
We must practice using them properly.  For example, a builder may
develop poor habits in the way that he handles his tools.  He may put
some of them to a wrong use altogether.  Under these circumstances, his
methods are very likely to result in an inferior product.  Similarly,
you may now be aware of unhealthy habits that have crept into your
family.  Some may be strongly entrenched and hard to change.  However,
follow the Bible's advice:  "A wise person will listen and take in more
instruction, and a man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful
direction." - Proverbs 1:5.

23 You can acquire skillful direction by continuing to take in the
knowledge of God.  Be alert to Bible principles that apply to family
life, and make adjustments where needed.  Observe mature Christians who
set a fine example as marriage mates and parents.  Talk to them.  Above
all, take your concerns to Jehovah in prayer.  (Psalm 55:22;
Philippians 4:6-7)  He can help you to enjoy a happy family life that
honors him.

@node "Chapter16" "How You Can Draw Close To God"

                                 @{b}@{u}HOW YOU CAN@{ub}@{uu}
                              @{b}DRAW CLOSE TO GOD@{ub}

1 A TOURIST visiting an Oriental country was amazed at the religious
rituals she observed at a Buddhist temple.  Although the images were not
those of Mary or Christ, many of the rituals resembled those of her
church back home.  For instance, she noted the use of rosaries and the
chanting of prayers.  Others too have made such comparisons.  East or
West, the ways in which devotees try to draw close to God or to the
objects of their worship are remarkably similar.

2 Many especially try to draw close to God by praying to him.  Prayer has
been described as "an act of communication by man with the sacred or or
holy - God, the gods, the transcendent realm, or supernatural powers."
(@{i}The New Encyclopædia Britannica@{ui})  When approaching God in
prayer, however, some think only in terms of what they get out of it.  For
example, a man once asked one of Jehovah's Witnesses: "If you pray for me,
will the problems I have in my family, at work, and with my health be
solved?"  Apparently the man thought so, but many pray and find that their
problems persist.  So we might ask, `Just why should we draw close to God?'

                             @{b}@{u}WHY DRAW CLOSE TO GOD@{ub}@{uu}

3 Prayer is not an empty ritual, nor is it merely a means by which to gain
something.  A major reason for approaching God is to have a close
relationship with him.  Our prayers should therefore be directed to Jehovah
God.  "Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him," said the psalmist
David.  (Psalm 145:18)  Jehovah invites us to come into a peaceful
relationship with him.  (Isaiah 1:18)  Those responding to this invitation
agree with the psalmist who said:  "As for me, the drawing near to God is
good for me."  Why?  Because those who draw near to Jehovah God will enjoy
true happiness and peace of mind. - Psalm 73:28.

4 Why pray to God for help if he `knows what we need before we ask him'?
(Matthew 6:8;  Psalm 139:4)  Prayer shows that we have faith in God and
view him as the Source of "every good gift and every perfect present."
(James 1:17;  Hebrews 11:6)  Jehovah takes pleasure in our prayers.
(Proverbs 15:8)  He is glad to hear our meaningful expressions of
appreciation and praise, just as a father rejoices at hearing his young
child speak sincere words of gratitude.  (Psalm 119:108)  Where there is
a good father-child relationship, there is warm communication.  A child
who is loved wants to talk to his father.  The same is true when it comes
to our relationship with God.  If we really appreciate what we are
learning about Jehovah and the love he has shown for us, we will have a
strong desire to express ourselves to him in prayer. - 1 John 4:16-18.

5 When approaching the Most High God, we should be respectful, though
there is not need to worry excessively about the exact words that we use.
(Hebrews 4:16)  We always have access to Jehovah.  And what a privilege it
is that we can `pour our heart' to God in prayer!  (Psalm 62:8) 
Appreciation for Jehovah leads to a warm relationship with him, like the
one that the faithful man Abraham enjoyed as God's friend.  (James 2:23)
But when praying to the Sovereign Lord of the universe, we must comply
with his requirements for approaching him.

                               REQUIREMENTS FOR
                             DRAWING CLOSE TO GOD

6 Is money needed in order to approach God?  Many people pay the clergy
to pray for them.  Some even believe that their prayers will be heard in
proportion to the size of the donation they make.  However, God's Word
does not say that a monetary offering is required for us to approach
Jehovah in prayer.  His spiritual provisions and the blessings of a
relationship with him in prayer are available without price.
- Isaiah 55:1-2.

7 What, then, is required?  A right heart attitude is one essential.
(2 Chronicles 6:29-30;  Proverbs 15:11)  In our heart we must exercise
faith in Jehovah God as the "Hearer of prayer" and "the rewarder of those
earnestly seeking him."  (Psalm 65:2;  Hebrews 11:6)  We must also have a
humble heart.  (2 Kings 22:19;  Psalm 51:17)  In one of his illustrations,
Jesus Christ showed that when approaching God a humble tax collector with
a lowly heart attitude proved more righteous than an arrogant Pharisee.
(Luke 18:10-14)  As we approach God in prayer, let us remember that
"everyone that is proud in heart is something detestable to Jehovah."
- Proverbs 16:5.

8 If we desire to have God answer our prayers, we have to cleanse
ourselves of sinful conduct.  When the disciple James encouraged others
to drawer close to God, he added:  "Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and
purify your hearts, you indecisive ones."  (James 4:8)  Even wrongdoers
can come into a peaceful relationship with Jehovah if they repent and
leave their former way of life.  (Proverbs 28:13)  We cannot have
audience with Jehovah if we merely pretend that we have cleansed our way.
"The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones, and his ears are toward
their supplication;  but the face of Jehovah is against those doing bad
things," says God's Word. - 1 Peter 3:12.

9 The Bible states:  "These is no man righteous in the earth that keeps
doing good and does not sin."  (Ecclesiastes 7:20)  You might therefore
ask:  "How, then, can we approach Jehovah God?"  The Bible answers:  "If
anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ,
a righteous one."  (1 John 2:21)  Though we are sinners, we can approach
God with freeness of speech through Jesus Christ, who died as a ransom for
us.  (Matthew 20:28)  He is the only channel through whom we can approach
Jehovah God.  (John 14:6)  We must not take the mert of Jesus' ransom
sacrifice for granted and deliberately practice sin.  (Hebrews 10:26)
However, if we are doing our best to refrain from what is bad and yet err
at times, we can repend and ask God for forgiveness.  When we approach
him with a humble heart, he will hear us. - Luke 11:4.

                               OPPORTUNITIES TO
                                 TALK TO GOD

10 Jesus Christ valued his relationship with Jehovah very highly. 
Therefore, Jesus made time to talk to God in private prayer.  (Mark 1:35;
Luke 22:40-46)  We do well to imitate Jesus' example and pray to God on a
regular basis.  (Romans 12:12)  It is fitting to start the day off with
words of prayer, and before going to bed, we can rightly thank Jehovah
for the day's activity.  During the day, make it a point to approach God
"on every occasion."  (Ephesians 6:18)  We can even pray silently in our
heart, knowing that Jehovah can hear us.  Privately talking to God helps
us to cement our relationship with him, and praying to Jehovah daily helps
us to draw even closer to him.

11 Jehovah also listens to prayers offered on behalf of groups of people.
(1 Kings 8:22-53)  We can draw close to God as a family, with the head of
the household taking the lead.  This strengthens the family bond, and
Jehovah becomes real to young ones as they hear their parents humbly pray
to God.  What if someone is representing a group in prayer, perhaps at a
meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses?  If we are in audience, let us listen
attentively so that at the end of the prayer, we can wholeheartedly say
"Amen," which means "So be it." - 1 Corinthians 14:16.

                                 PRAYERS THAT
                                JEHOVAH  HEARS

12 Some may feel that God does not answer their prayers even though they
may pray to him through Christ.  However, the apostle John said:
"No matter what it is that we ask according to [God's] will, he hears us."
(1 John 5:14)  So, then we need to ask according to God's will.  Since he
is interested in our spiritual welfare, anything affecting our
spirituality is an appropriate subject for prayer.  We must resist the
temptation to concentrate entirely on physical needs.  For instance,
while it is proper to pray for insight and fortitude to deal with illness,
worries about health should not crowd out spiritual interests.
(Psalm 41:1-3)  Having become aware that she was overly concerned about
her health, one Christian woman asked Jehovah for help to have the proper
view of her illness.  As a result, her health problems became a much
smaller issue, and she felt she was given "power beyond what is normal."
(2 Corinthians 4:7)  Her desire to be of spiritual help to thers
intensified, and she became a full-time Kingdom proclaimer.

13 What may we include in our prayers so that Jehovah will be pleased to
hear them?  Jesus Christ taught his disciples how to pray.  In the model
prayer recorded at Matthew 6:9-13, he set out a pattern of subjects about
which we might rightly pray.  What should be of chief concern in our
prayers?  Jehovah God's name and Kingdom must be the top priority.  Asking
for our material needs is appropriate.  It is also important to ask for
forgiveness of our sins and for deliverence from temptations and the
wicked one, Satan the Devil.  Jesus did not want us to chant this prayer
or to repeat it over and over, reciting it without thinking about its
meaning.  (Matthew 6:7)  What kind of relationship would it be if a child
used the same words every time he spoke to his father?

14 Besides petitions and heartfelt supplications, we should offer prayers
of praise and thanksgiving.  (Psalm 34:1;  92:1;  1 Thessalonians 5:18)
We can also pray for others.  Prayers regarding our spiritual brothers and
sisters who are afflicted or persecuted show our interest in them, and
Jehovah is pleased to hear us express such concern.  (Luke 22:32;
John 17:20;  1 Thessalonians 5:25)  In fact, the aspostle Paul wrote:
"Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and
supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to
God;  and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts
and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus." - Philippians 4:6-7.

                              PERSEVERE IN PRAYER

15 Though you are gaining knowledge about God, you may feel that your
prayers sometimes go unanswered.  This could be the case because it may
not be God's time to answer a specific prayer.  (Ecclesiastes 3:1-9)
Jehovah may allow a situation to continue for a while, but he does
answer prayers and knows the best time to do so. - 2 Corinthians 12:7-9.

16 Our persistence in prayer reveals our heartfelt interest in what we
are saying to God.  (Luke 18:1-8)  For example, we may ask Jehovah to help
us overcome a certain weakness.  By persevering in prayer and acting in
harmony with our petitions, we show are sincerity.  We should be specific
and honest in our petitions.  It is especially important to pray intensely
when we are experiencing a temptation.  (Matthew 6:13)  As we continue to
pray while trying to control our sinful urges, we will see how Jehovah
helps us.  This will build up our faith and strengthen our relationship
with him. - 1 Corinthians 10:13;  Philippians 4:13.

17 By cultivating a prayerful attitude in rendering sacred service to
Jehovah God, we will come to realize that we do not serve him in our
own strength.  It is Jehovah who gets things done.  (1 Corinthians 4:7)
Acknowledging this will help us to be humble and will enrich our
relationship with him.  (1 Peter 5:5-6)  Yes, we have sound reasons to
persevere in prayer.  Our earnest prayers and precious knowledge of how
to draw close to our loving heavenly Father will make our life truly
happy.

                                COMMUNICATION
                          WITH JEHOVAH NOT ONE-SIDED

18 If we want God to hear our prayers, we must listen to what he says.
(Zechariah 7:13)  He no longer sends his messages through divinely
inspired prophets and surely does not use spiritistic means.
(Deuteronomy 18:10-12)  But we can listen to God by studying his Word,
the Bible.  (Romans 15:4;  2 Timothy 3:16-17)  Just as we may need to
acquire a taste for physical food that is good for us, we are urged to
"form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word." 
Cultivate a taste for spiritual food by reading God's Word daily.
- 1 Peter 2:2-3;  Acts 17:11.

19 Meditate on what you read in the Bible.  (Psalm 1:1-3;  77:11-12)
That means to ponder over the material.  You might liken this to
digesting food.  You can digest spiritual food by relating what you are
reading to things you already know.  Consider how the material affects
your life, or reflect on what it reveals about Jehovah's qualities and
dealings.  Thus through personal study, you can take in the spiritual
food that Jehovah provides.  This will draw you closer to God and will
help you to deal with day-to-day problems.

20  You can also draw close to God by listening to his Word discussed at
Christian meetings, just as the Israelites listened attentively when they
gathered to hear the public reading of God's Law.  The instructors of
that time put meaning into their reading of the Law, this helping their
listeners to understand and be moved to apply what they heard.  This led
to great joy.  (Nehemiah 8:8, 12)  So make it your custom to attend the
meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses.  (Hebrews 10:24-25)  This will help you
to understand and then apply the knowledge of God in your life and will
bring you happiness.  Being a part of the worldwide Christian brotherhood
will help you to stay close to Jehovah.  And as we shall see, you can find
true security among God's people.

                             @{b}@{u}AMONG GOD'S PEOPLE@{ub}@{uu}

1 IMAGINE that a violent storm has ravaged the area where you live.  Your
home is destroyed, and all your possessions are lost.  Food is scarce.
The situation seems hopeless.  Then, unexpected relief supplies arrive.
Food and clothing are provided in abundance.  A new house is built for
you.  Surely you would be grateful to the person who made these
provisions available.

2 Something comparable is occurring today.  Like that storm, the
rebellion of Adam and Eve caused great damage to the human race.
Mankind's Paradise home was lost.  Since then, human governments have
failed to shelter people from war, crime, and injustice.  Religion has
left multitudes starving for wholesome spiritual food.  Spiritually
speaking, however, Jehovah God is now furnishing food, clothing, and
shelter.  How is he doing that?

                       "THE FAITHFUL AND DISCREET SLAVE"

3 Relief supplies are generally dispensed through an organized channel,
and Jehovah has similarly made spiritual provision for his people.  For
example, the Israelites were "Jehovah's congregation" for some 1,500
years.  Among them were those who served as God's channel to teach his
Law.  (1 Chronicles 28:8;  2 Chronicles 17:7-9)  In the first century
@{"C.E." alink "CE"}, Jehovah brought forth the Christian organization.  Congregations
were formed, and they functioned under the direction of a governing body
made up of apostles and older men.  (Acts 15:22-31)  Likewise today,
Jehovah deals with his people through an organized body.  How do we know
this?

4 Jesus said that at the time of his presence in Kingdom power, "the
faithful and discreet slave" would be found providing "food at the proper
time" for His followers.  (Matthew 24:45-47)  When Jesus was installed as
heavenly King in 1914, who did this "slave" prove to be?  Certainly not
the clergy of Christendom.  For the most part, they were feeding their
flocks propaganda that backed up their own national governments in World
War I.  But proper and timely spiritual food was being dispensed by the
group of true Christians who were annointed by God's holy spirit and were
a part of what Jesus called "the little flock."  (Luke 12:32)  These
annointed Christians preached God's Kingdom rather than man's governments.
As a result, over the years millions of righteously disposed "other sheep"
have joined the annoined "slave" in practicing true religion. (John 10:16)
Using the `faithful slave' and its present-day Governing Body, God directs
his organized people to make spiritual food, clothing, and shelter
available to all who wish to have these provisions.

                          "FOOD AT THE PROPER TIME"

5 Jesus said:  "Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance
coming forth through Jehovah's mouth."  (Matthew 4:4)  Sadly, though, the
vast majority of people are not paying attention to God's utterances.  As
foretold by Jehovah's prophet Amos, there is "a famine, not for bread, and
a thirst, not for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah." (Amos 8:11)
Even very religious people are spiritually famished.  Nevertheless,
Jehovah's will is that "all sorts of men should be saved and come to an
accurate knowledge of truth."  (1 Timothy 2:3-4)  Accordingly, he is
providing spiritual food in abundance.  But where can it be obtained?

6 Throughout history, Jehovah has dispensed spiritual food to his people
as a group.  (Isaiah 65:13)  For instance, the Israelite priests gathered
men, women, and children for group instruction in God's Law.
(Deuteronomy 31:9, 12)  Under the direction of the governing body,
first-century Christians organized congregations and held meetings for the
instruction and encouragement of all.  (Romans 16:5;  Philimon 1-2)
Jehovah's Witnesses follow this pattern.  You are cordially invited to
attent all their meetings.

7 Of course, you may already have learned much in your personal study of
the Bible.  Perhaps someone has assisted you.  (Acts 8:30-35)  But your
faith might be likened to a plant that will wither and die if it is not
given suitable care.  Hence, you must receive proper spiritual
nourishment.  (1 Timothy 4:6)  Christian meetings provide a continuous
program of instruction designed to nourish you spiritually and help you
to keep on growing in faith as you increase in the knowledge of God.
- Colossians 1:9-10.

8 Meetings serve another vital purpose.  Paul wrote:  "Let us consider
one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering
of ourselves together."  (Hebrews 10:24-25)  The Greek word translated
"to incite" can also mean "to sharpen."  A Bible proverb states:  "By
iron, iron itself is sharpened.  So one man sharpens the face of another."
(Proverbs 27:17)  All of us need continual `sharpening.'  Daily pressures
from the world can dull our faith.  When we attend Christian meetings,
there is an interchange of encouragement.  (Romans 1:11-12)  Members of
the congregation follow the apostle Paul's admonition to "keep comforting
one another and building one another up," and such things sharpen our
faith.  (1 Thessalonians 5:11)  Regular presence at Christian meetings
also indicates that we love God and affords us opportunities to praise
him. - Psalm 35:18.

                              "CLOTHE YOURSELVES
                                   WITH LOVE"

9 Paul wrote:  "Clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of
union."  (Colossians 3:14)  Jehovah has graciously provided this clothing
for us.  In what way?  Christians can display love because it is one of
the God-given fruits of Jehovah's holy spirit.  (Galatians 5:22-23)
Jehovah himself has displayed the greatest love by sending his
only-begotten Son so that we might have everlasting life.  (John 3:16)
This supreme demonstration of love provided a model for us in expressing
this quality.  "If this is how God loved us," wrote the apostle John,
"then we are ourselves under obligation to love one another."- 1 John 4:11.

10 Your attending the meetings at the Kingdom Hall will afford you an
excellent opportunity to show love.  There you will meet a wide variety
of people.  No doubt you will feel drawn to many of them right away.  Of
course, personalities differ even among those serving Jehovah.  Perhaps
in the past you simply avoided people who did not share your interests or
traits.  Christians, though, are to "have love for the @{i}whole@{ui} association
of brothers."  (1 Peter 2:17)  Therefore, make it your aim to become
acquainted with those at the Kingdom Hall - even individuals whose age,
personality, race, or level of education may differ from yours.  Likely
you will find that each one excels in some endearing quality.

11 The diversity of personalities in the congregation need not disturb
you.  To illustrate, imagine that numerous vehicles are traveling
alongside you on a road.  Not all are moving with the same speed, nor are
all in the same condition.  Some have travelled many miles, but like you,
others have just started out.  Regardless of these differences, however,
all are travelling down the road.  It is similar with the individuals
making up a congregation.  Not all develop Christian qualities at the
same speed.  Furthermore, not all are in the same physical or emotional
condition.  Some have been worshipping Jehovah for many years;  others
have just begun.  Yet, all are travelling along the road to everlasting
life, "fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought."
(1 Corinthians 1:10)  Therefore, look for the strengths rather than the
weaknesses of those in the congregation.  Doing that will warm your
heart, for you will realize that God is really among these people.  And
surely this is where you want to be. - 1 Corinthians 14:25.

12 Since all humans are imperfect, at times someone in the congregation
may say or do something that upsets you.  (Romans 3:23)  The disciple
James realistically wrote:  "We all stumble many times.  If anyone does
not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man."  (James 3:2)  How will
you react if someone offends you?  A Bible proverb says:  "The insight
of a man certainly slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part
to pass over transgression."  (Proverbs 19:11)  To have insight means to
see beneath the surface of a situation, to grasp underlying factors that
cause a person to talk or act in a certain way.  Most of us use much
insight in excusing our own mistakes.  Why not also use it to understand
and cover the imperfections of others? - Matthew 7:1-5;  Colossians 3:13.

13 Never forget that we must forgive others if we ourselves are to receive
Jehovah's forgiveness.  (Matthew 6:9, 12, 14-15)  If we are practicing the
truth, we will treat others in a loving way.  (1 John 1:6-7;  3:14-16;
4:20-21)  Therefore, if you encounter a problem with an individual in the
congregation, fight against harboring resentment.  If you are clothed with
love, you will strive to resolve the problem, and you will not hesitate
to apologize if you have caused offence. - Matthew 5:23-24;  18:15-17.

14 Our spiritual clothing should include other qualities closely related
to love.  Paul wrote:  "Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of
compassion, kindness, lowliness of mind, mildness, and long-suffering."
These traits, encompassed by love, are part of the godly "new
personality."  (Colossians 3:10, 12)  Will you make the effort to clothe
yourself in this way?  Especially if you clothe yourself in brotherly love
will you bear an identifying mark of Jesus' disciples, for he said:  "By
this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among
yourselves." - John 13:35.

                              A PLACE OF SECURITY

15 The congregation also serves as a shelter, a protective refuge where
you can feel secure.  In it you will find honesthearted people who are
striving to do what is right in God's eyes.  Many of them have done
away with the same bad practices and attitudes that you may be struggling
to overcome.  (Titus 3:3)  They can help you, for we are told to "go on
carrying the burdens of one another."  (Galatians 6:2)  Naturally,
pursuing a course that leads to everlasting life is ultimately your own
responsibility.  (Galatians 6:5;  Philippians 2:12)  Yet, Jehovah has
provided the Christian congregation as a wonderful means of help and
support.  No matter how distressing your problems may be, you have a
valuable resource available to you - a loving congregation that will
stand by you in times of affliction or deprivation.
- Compare Luke 10:29-37;  Acts 20:35.

16 Among those who would rally to your support are "gifts in men" -
appointed congregation elders, or overseers, who shepherd the flock
willingly and eagerly.  (Ephesians 4:8, 11-12;  Acts 20:28;  1 Peter 5:2-3)
Regarding them, Isaiah prophesied:  "Each one must prove to be like a
hiding place from the wind and a place of concealment from the rainstorm,
like streams of water in a waterless country, like the shadow of a heavy
crag in an exhausted land." - Isaiah 32:2.

17 When Jesus was on earth, loving oversight by the religious leaders was
sadly lacking.  The condition of the people moved him deeply, and he
especially wanted to help them spiritually.  Jesus pitied them because
"they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd."
(Matthew 9:36)  How well this describes the present-day plight of many
who endure heart-wrenching problems with no one to turn to for spiritual
help and comfort.  But Jehovah's people do have spiritual assistance,
for he promised:  "I will raise up over them shepherds who will actually
shepherd them; and they will be afraid no more, neither will they be
struck with any terror, and none will be missing." - Jeremiah 23:4.

18 Get to know the appointed elders in the congregation.  They have much
experience in applying the knowledge of God, for they have met the
qualifications for overseers set forth in the Bible.
(1 Timothy 3:1-7;  Titus 1:5-9)  Do not hesitate to approach one of them
if you need spiritual help to overcome a habit or a trait than conflicts
with God's requirements.  You will find that the elders follow Paul's
admonition:  "Speak consolingly to the depressed souls, support the weak,
be long-suffering toward all." - 1 Thessalonians 2:7-8; 5:14.

                                ENJOY SECURITY
                            WITH JEHOVAH'S PEOPLE

19 Though we now live amid imperfect conditions, Jehovah provides us with
spiritual food, clothing, and shelter.  Of course, we must wait for God's
promised new world in order to experience the benefits of a physical
paradise.  But those who are part of Jehovah's organization are presently
enjoying the security of a spiritual paradise.  Concerning them, Ezekiel
prophesied:  "They will actually dwell in security, with no one to make
them tremble." - Ezekiel 34:28;  Psalm 4:8.

20 How grateful we can be that Jehovah makes loving spiritual provisions
through his Word and organization!  Draw close to God's people.  Do not
hold back in fear of what friends or relatives may think of you for
taking in the knowledge of God.  Some map disapprove because you are
associating with Jehovah's Witnesses and attending meetings at the Kingdom
Hall.  But God will more than compensate for anything you sacrifice for
the sake of his worship.  (Malachi 3:10)  Moreover, Jesus said:  "No one
has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or
fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a
hundredfold now in this period of time, houses and brothers and sisters
and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming
system of things everlasting life."  (Mark 10:29-30)  Yes, no matter what
you have left behind or must endure, you can find delightful companionship
and spiritual security among God's people.

                                 @{b}@{u}TO SERVE GOD@{ub}@{uu}
                                   @{b}@{u}FOREVER@{ub}@{uu}

1 IMAGINE that you are standing before a locked door leading to a room
containing great treasures.  Let us say that an authorized person has
given you the key and has told you to help yourself to these valuable
things.  That key will do you no good unless you use it.  Similarly, you
must use knowledge if it is to benefit you.

2 This is particularly true of the knowledge of God.  Indeed, accurate
knowledge of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ means everlasting life.
(John 17:3)  Yet, that prospect cannot be realized through the mere
possession of knowledge.  As you would use a valued key, you need to
apply the knowledge of God in your life.  Jesus said that those @{i}doing@{ui}
God's will would "enter into the kingdom."  Such individuals would be
privileged to serve God forever! - Matthew 7:21;  1 John 2:17.

3 After learning what God's will is, it is vital to do it.  What do you
think that God's will is for you?  It could well be summed up in these
words:  Imitate Jesus.  First Peter 2:21 tells us:  "To this course you
were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for
you to follow in his steps closely."  To do God's will, then, you need to
follow Jesus' example as closely as possible.  That is how you put to use
the knowledge of God.

                                HOW JESUS USED
                             THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

4 Jesus Christ has a more intimate knowledge of God than others do.  He
lived and worked with Jehovah God in heaven for ages before coming to the
earth.  (Colossians 1:15-16)  And what did Jesus do with all that
knowledge?  He was not satisfied with merely possessing it.  Jesus lived
by it.  That is why he was so kind, patient, and loving in his dealings
with fellow humans.  Jesus was thus imitating his heavenly Father and
acting in harmony with his knowledge of Jehovah's ways and personality.
- John 8:23, 28-29, 38;  1 John 4:8.

5 The knowledge Jesus had also moved him to take a crucial step.  He came
from Galilee to the Jordan River, where John baptized him.
(Matthew 13:13-15)  What did Jesus' baptism symbolize?  As a Jew, he was
born into a nation dedicated to God.  Hence, Jesus had been dedicated from
birth.  (Exodus 19:5-6)  By submitting to baptism, he was @{i}presenting@{ui}
himself to Jehovah to do the divine will for him at that time.
(Hebrews 10:5, 7)  And Jesus lived up to the meaning of his baptism.  He
spent himself in Jehovah's service, sharing the knowledge of God with
people at every opportunity.  Jesus found delight in doing God's will,
even saying that this was like food for him. - John 4:34.

6 Jesus fully realized that doing Jehovah's will would be very costly -
that it would even cost him his life.  Nevertheless, Jesus disowned
himself, putting his personal needs in second place.  Doing God's will
always came first.  In this repect, how can we follow Jesus' perfect
example?

                       STEPS THAT LEAD TO LIFE ETERNAL

7 Unlike Jesus, we are imperfect and can reach the milestone of baptism
only after taking other vital steps.  This begins by taking accurate
knowledge of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ into our heart.  Doing this
causes us to exercise faith and to have profound love for God.
(Matthew 22:37-40;  Romans 10:17;  Hebrews 11:6)  Compliance with God's
laws, principles, and standards should move us to repent, expressing
godly sorrow over our past sins.  This leads to conversion, that is, to
a turning around and abandoning any wrong course we followed when we did
not have the knowledge of God.  (Acts 3:19)  Naturally, if we are still
secretly practicing some sin instead of doing what is righteous, we have
not really turned around, nor have we fooled God.  Jehovah detects all
hypocrisy. - Luke 12:2-3.

8 Now that you have been taking in the knowledge of God, it is not
fitting to consider spiritual matters in a very personal way?  Probably
you are eager to tell your relatives, friends, and others what you are
learning.  In fact, you may already have been doing this, even as Jesus
shared the good news with others in informal settings.  (Luke 10:38-39;
John 4:6-15)  Now you may want to do more.  Christian elders will be
glad to talk with you in order to determine whether you are qualified
and able to have some share in the regular Kingdom-preaching activity
of Jehovah's Witnesses.  If you are, the elders will make arrangements
for you to accompany a Witness in the ministry.  Jesus' disciples
followed his instructions in order to carry out their ministry in an
orderly way.  (Mark 6:7, 30;  Luke 10:1)  You will benefit from
similar help as you share in spreading the Kingdom message from house
to house and in other ways. - Acts 20:20-21.

9 Preaching the good news to all kinds of people in the congregation's
territory is a way to find those who are righteously disposed and is
among the fine works proving that you have faith.  (Acts 10:34-35;
James 2:17-18, 26)  Regular attendance at Christian meetings and having
a meaningful share in the preaching work are also ways to demonstrate
that you have repented and turned around and are now determined to live
in accord with the knowledge of God.  What is the next logical step?
It is to make a dedication to Jehovah God.  This means that in heartfelt
prayer, you tell God that you are willingly and wholeheartedly giving
your life to him to do his will.  This is the way to dedicate yourself
to Jehovah and accept the kindly yoke of Jesus Christ. - Matthew 11:29-30.

                       BAPTISM - WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU

10 According to Jesus, all those who become his disciples must be
baptized.  (Matthew 28:19-20)  Why is this necessary after you have made a
dedication to God?  Since you have dedicated yourself to Jehovah, he knows
that you love him.  But no doubt you will want to take further action in
order to let others know about your love for God.  Well, baptism affords
you an opportunity to make your dedication to Jehovah God known publicly.
- Romans 10:9-10.

11 Baptism is rich in symbolic meaning.  As you are submerged, or
"buried," beneath the water, it is as though you have died to your former
course of life.  When you come up out of the water, it is as if you are
emerging to a new life, one that is governed by God's will and not your
own.  Of course, that does not mean that you will make no more mistakes,
for all of us are imperfect and therefore sin daily.  However, as a
dedicated, baptized servant of Jehovah, you will have entered into a
special relationship with him.  Because of your repentance and your
humble submission to baptism, Jehovah is willing to forgive your sins on
the basis of Jesus' ransom sacrifice.  Baptism thus leads to a clean
conscience before God. - 1 Peter 3:21.

12 Jesus commanded his followers to baptize new disciples "in the name
of he Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit."  (Matthew 28:19)
What did Jesus mean?  Baptism "in the name of the Father" indicates that
the person being baptized wholeheartedly accepts Jehovah God as the
Creator and the rightful Sovereign of the universe.  (Psalm 36:9;  83:18;
Ecclesiastes 12:1)  Being baptized `in the name of the Son' means that
the individual acknowledges Jesus Christ - and particularly His ransom
sacrifice - as the only means of salvation provided by God.  (Acts 4:12)
Baptism `in the name of the holy spirit' signifies that the baptismal
candidate recognizes Jehovah's holy spirit, or active force, as God's
instrument for carrying out His purposes and for empowering His servants
to do His righteous will in association with His spirit-directed
organization. - Genesis 1:2;  Psalm 104:30;  John 14:26;  2 Peter 1:21.

                          ARE YOU READY FOR BAPTISM?

13 Since baptism means so much and is the most important milestone in a
person's life, is it a step that you should fear?  Not at all!  While
the decision to be baptized is not to be taken lightly, it is
unquestionably the wisest one you could possibly make.

14 Baptism gives evidence of your choice to serve Jehovah God.  Think
about people with whom you come in contact.  In one way or another, is
not each one of them serving a master?  Some slave for riches.
(Matthew 6:24)  Others diligently pursue their careers or serve
themselves by making the fulfillment of their own desires paramount in
life.  Still others serve false gods.  But you have chosen to serve the
true God, Jehovah.  No one else shows as much kindness, compassion, and
love.  God dignifies humans with purposeful work that points them to
salvation.  He rewards his servants with everlasting life.  Surely,
following Jesus' example and giving your life to Jehovah is not a course
to fear.  Actually, it is the only one that pleases God and makes
perfect sense. - 1 Kings 18:21.

15 Yet, baptism is not a step to be taken because of pressure.  It is a
personal matter between you and Jehovah.  (Galatians 6:4)  As you have
made spiritual progress, you may have wondered:  "What prevents me from
getting baptized?"  (Acts 8:35-36)  You might ask yourself, `Is family
opposition holding me back?  Am I still involved in some unscriptural
situation or sinful practice?  Could it be that I am afraid of losing
favor in the community?'  These are some of the factors to consider, but
weigh them realistically.

16 It is not realistic to weigh the costs without considering the
benefits of serving Jehovah.  For instance, consider the matter of family
opposition.  Jesus promised that even if his disciples lost their
relatives because of following him, they would gain a larger spiritual
family.  (Mark 10:29-30)  These fellow believers will show you brotherly
love, help you to endure persecution, and support you on the road to life.
(1 Peter 5:9)  Especially can the congregation elders help you to cope
with problems and to meet other challenges successfully.  (James 5:14-16)
As to losing favor in this world, you may well ask yourself, `What can
possibly compare to having the approval of the Creator of the universe,
causing him to rejoice over my chosen life course?' - Proverbs 27:11.

                              LIVING UP TO YOUR
                            DEDICATION AND BAPTISM

17 It is important to remember that baptism is not the end of your
spiritual progress.  It marks the beginning of lifelong service to God as
an ordained minister and one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  Although baptism is
vitally important, it is not a guarantee of salvation.  Jesus did not say
`Everyone baptized will be saved.'  Instead, he said:  "He that has
endured to the end is the one that will be saved."  (Matthew 24:13) 
Therefore, it is vital that you seek God's Kingdom first by making it the
paramount concern in your life. - Matthew 6:25-34.

18 To endure in your service to Jehovah, you will want to set spiritual
goals for yourself.  One worthy goal is to further your knowledge of
God through regular personal study of his Word.  Plan for daily reading
of the Bible.  (Psalm 1:1-2)  Attend Christian meetings regularly, for
the association you find there will help to give you spiritual strength.
For your part, why not make it your goal to comment at congregation
meetings and thus praise Jehovah and seek to upbuild others?
(Romans 1:11-12)  Another goal might be to improve the quality of your
prayers. - Luke 11:2-4.

19 If you are to live up to the meaning of baptism, you need to pay
constant attention to what you dom letting God's holy spirit produce in
you such qualities as love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness,
goodness, faith, mildness, and self-control.  (Galatians 5:22-23;
2 Peter 3:11)  Remember, Jehovah gives his holy spirit to all who pray
for it and obey him as his faithful servants.  (Luke 11:13;  Acts 5:32)
So pray to God for his spirit and ask him for help in displaying
qualities that please him.  Such qualities will become more evident in
your speech and conduct as you respond to the influence of God's spirit.
Of course, every individual in the Christian congregation is striving to
develop "the new personality" so as to become more like Christ.
(Colossians 3:9-14)  Each one of us faces different challenges in doing
this because we are at varying stages of spiritual progress.  Since you
are imperfect, you must work hard to have a Christlike personality.  But
never despair in this regard, for it is possible with God's help.

20 Among your spiritual goals should be that of imitating Jesus' joyful
example more  closely.  (Hebrews 12:1-3)  He loved the ministry.  If you
are privileged to share in the Kingdom-preaching activity, then, do not
let it become mere routine.  Seek to find satisfaction in teaching others
about God's Kingdom as Jesus did.  Put to use the instruction that the
congregation provides to help you improve as a teacher.  And be assured
that Jehovah can give you the strength to carry out your ministry.
- 1 Corinthians 9:19-23.

21 A dedicated, baptized person faithfully endeavoring to follow Jesus
is special to God.  Jehovah examines all the billions of human hearts and
knows how rare such individuals are.  He considers them to be treasures,
"desirable things."  (Haggai 2:7)  Bible prophecies show that God views
such ones as marked to survive the execution of his judgement soon to
come on this wicked @{"system of things" alink "World"}.  (Ezekiel 9:1-6;  Malachi 3:16, 18)
Are you "rightly disposed for everlasting life"?  (Acts 13:48)  Is it
your earnest desire to be marked as one serving God?  Dedication and
baptism are part of that mark, and they are essential for survival.

22 After the global Flood, Noah and his family came out of the ark into
a cleansed earth.  Similarly today, "a great crowd" who apply the
knowledge of God in their lives gain Jehovah's approval have the prospect
of surviving the end of this wicked @{"system of things" alink "World"} and enjoying
everlasting life on a permanently cleansed earth.  (Revelation 7:9, 14)
What will that life be like?

1 SUPPOSE a great artist has just completed a splendid painting.  He
rightfully considers it to be very good - a masterpiece!  But overnight
a jealous rival defaces it.  Understandably, this causes the artist
great pain.  How eager he is to see the vandal locked up!  And you can
imagine how the artist yearns to have his creation restored to its
former beauty.

2 Like that artist, Jehovah created a masterpiece in preparing the earth
and putting mankind upon it.  After creating man and woman, he pronounced
all his earthly work "very good."  (Genesis 1:31)  Adam and Eve were
God's own children, and he loved them.  He envisioned a happy, glorious
future for them.  True, Satan led them into rebellion, but God's wonderful
creation was not damaged beyond repair. - Genesis 3:23-24;  6:11-12.

3 God has determined to set things straight.  He dearly wants to see us
live the way he originally purposed.  Our short and troubled existence is
not "the real life," for it is far inferior to what Jehovah had in mind.
"The real life" that God wants for us is "everlasting life" under perfect
conditions. - 1 Timothy 6:12, 19.

4 The knowledge of God brings responsibility before Jehovah.  (James 4:17)
But think of the blessings you will enjoy if you apply that knowledge and
reach out for everlasting life.  In his Word, the Bible, Jehovah God has
painted a beautiful picture of what life will be like in the the Paradise
earth so near at hand.  Of course, as Jehovah's people we do not serve God
solely out of a desire for a reward.  We serve God because we love him.
(Mark 12:29-30)  Moreover, we do not @{i}earn@{ui} life by serving Jehovah.
Everlasting life is a gift of God.  (Romans 6:23)  It will do us good to
meditate on such a life because the Paradise hope reminds us of the kind
of God Jehovah is - the loving "rewarder of those earnestly seeking him."
(Hebrews 11:6)  A hope that burns brightly in our minds and hearts will
enable us to endure hardships in Satan's world. - Jeremiah 23:20.

5 Let us now focus our attention on the Bible-based hope of everlasting
life in the future earthly Paradise.  What will life be like when then
knowledge of God fills the earth?

                     AFTER ARMAGEDDON - A PARADISE EARTH

6 As shown earlier, Jehovah God will soon destroy the present wicked @{"system" alink "World"}
of things.  The world is rapidly approaching what the Bible calls
Har-Magedon, or Armageddon.  That word may make some people think of a
nuclear holocaust brought about by warring nations, but Armageddon is
nothing of the kind.  As Revelation 16:14-16 shows, Armageddon is "the
war of the great day of God the Almighty."  It is a war involving "the
kings of the entire inhabited earth," or the nations.  Jehovah God's Son,
the appointed King, will soon ride forth into battle.  The outcome is
absolutely sure.  All who oppose God's Kingdom and who are a part of
Satan's wicked @{"system" alink "World"} will be eliminated.  Only those loyal to Jehovah
will survive. - Revelation 7:9, 14;  19:11-21.

7 Imagine that @{i}you@{ui} have survived that cataclysm.  What would life be like
on earth in God's promised new world?  (2 Peter 3:13)  We need not
speculate, for the Bible tells us, and what it says is thrilling.  We
learn that Satan and his demons will be put out of commission, locked
away in an abyss of inactivity during the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus
Christ.  No longer will those wicked, malicious creatures be lurking
behind the scenes, fomenting trouble and trying to goad us into acts of
unfaithfulness against God.  What a relief! - Revelation 20:1-3.

8 In time, all forms of sickness will vanish.  (Isaiah 33:24)  The lame
will then stand, walk, run, and dance on sound, strong legs.  After
years of life in their world of silence, the deaf will hear the joyous
sounds around them.  The blind will gasp in awe as a rich world of color
and form takes shape before their eyes.  (Isaiah 35:5-6)  At last, they
will see the faces of their loved ones!  Perhaps then their vision will
blur just momentarily with tears of joy.

9 Just think!  No more eyeglasses, no more crutches and canes, no more
medicines, no more dental clinics or hospitals!  Never again will
emotional illness and depression rob people of happiness.  No childhood
will be blighted by disease.  The ravages of aging will be reversed.
(Job 33:25)  We will become healthier, stronger.  Each morning we will
wake from a refreshing night's sleep with renewed energy, filled with
vigor and eager for a new day of vibrant life and satisfying work.

10 There will be plenty of enjoyable work to be done by Armageddon
survivors.  They will transform the earth into a paradise.  Any vestiges
of the polluted old @{"system" alink "World"} will be cleared away.  Parks and gardens will
emerge in place of slums and ruined land.  All will enjoy comfortable,
pleasant housing.  (Isaiah 65:21)  As time passes, those paradisaic parts
of the earth will grow and merge until the entire globe meets the standard
of beauty set by the Creator back in the garden of Eden.  How satisfying
it will be to share in that work of restoration!

11 All of this will be done under divine guidance so that the environment
will not be harmed.  Humans will be at peace with the animals.  Instead of
wantonly slaughtering them, man will resume responsible stewardship over
the earth, taking good care of them.  Visualize wolves and lambs, lions
and calves, feeding together - and the domestic animals are totally safe.
Even a child will have nothing to fear from wild beasts, nor will the
transquillity of the new world be disrupted by cruel, ferocious people.
(Isaiah 11:6-8)  What a peaceful new world that will be!

                             MANKIND TRANSFORMED

12 Isaiah 11:9 tells us why no harm will be done in all the earth.  It
says:  "The earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah
as the waters are covering the very sea."  This pertains to people
because animals cannot take in "the knowledge of Jehovah" and make
changes, since they are governed by instinct.  But the knowledge of our
Creator @{i}does@{ui} change people.  No doubt you have already made some changes
yourself as a result of applying the knowledge of God in your life. 
Millions have done so.  Therefore, this prophecy has already begun to be
fulfilled in those serving Jehovah.  Yet, it also points to a time when
people the world over will shed any animalistic or violent traits and
become peaceable forever.

13 How grand it will be when the knowledge of God fills the earth!  There
will be an extensive educational program under the direction of the King
Jesus Christ and his 144,000 corulers.  New "scrolls" will then come into
use.  Evidently these are God's written instructions that will serve as a
basis for educating earth's inhabitants.  (Revelation 20:12)  Mankind will
learn not war, but peace.  All destructive weapons will be gone forever.
(Psalm 46:9)  Inhabitants of the new world will be taught to treat their
fellow humans with love, respect, and dignity.

14 Mankind will become one united family.  There will be no barriers to
unity and brotherhood.  (Psalm 133:1-3)  No one's home will have to be
locked to keep thieves out.  Peace will reign in every heart, in every
house, in every part of the earth. - Micah 4:4.

                           THE JOYOUS RESURRECTION

15 During the Millennium, the resurrection will take place.  Those who
willfully sinned against God's holy spirit, or active force, by
unrepentantly acting contrary to its manifestation or leadings will not
be resurrected.  (Matthew 23:15, 33;  Hebrews 6:4-6)  Of course, God will
decide who sinned in that way.  But two distinct groups will be
resurrected - "the righteous and the unrighteous."  (Acts 24:15)  Since
there will be proper order, it is reasonable to conclude that the first
to be welcomed back to life on earth will be the righteous, those who
served Jehovah loyally. - Hebrews 11:35-39.

16 Instead of hearing news about wars, disasters, and death, Jehovah's
servants will receive wonderful reports of the resurrection.  It will be
exciting to learn about the return of such faithful men and women as Abel,
Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Job, Moses, Rahab, Ruth, David, Elijah,
Esther.  What stirring historical facts they will present as they give
background details of many Bible accounts!  No doubt they and righteous
ones who have died in more recent times will be just as eager to learn
about the end of Satan's @{"system" alink "World"} and how Jehovah sanctified his holy name
and vindicated his sovereignty.

17 How helpful these faithful ones will be during the next phase of the
resurrection, when billions of "the unrighteous" are released from the
bonds of death!  Most of mankind never had a chance to know Jehovah,
Satan was `blinding their minds.' (2 Corinthians 4:4)  But the Devil's
work will be undone.  The unrighteous will come back to a beautiful and
peaceful earth.  They will be welcomed by a people well organized to
teach them about Jehovah and his reigning Son, Jesus Christ.  As billions
of resurrected ones come to know and love their Creator, the knowledge of
Jehovah will fill the earth in an unprecedented way.

18 What joy the resurrection will bring to our hearts!  Who has not
suffered because of our enemy death?  Indeed, who has not felt utterly
shattered when some bond of love or friendship was torn apart as sickness,
old age, accident, or violence claimed the life of a loved one?  Imagine,
then, the joy of reunions in Paradise.  Mothers and fathers, sons and
daughters, friends and relatives, will run into one another's arms,
laughing and crying for joy.

                             PERFECTION AT LAST!

19 Throughout the Millenium, a wonderful miracle willl be taking place.
For mankind, it will be perhaps the most thrilling aspect of Christ's
Thousand Year Reign.  Jehovah will direct his Son to apply the benefits
of the ransom sacrifice to each and every faithful and obedient man and
woman.  By that means, all sin will be removed and mankind will be raised
to perfection. - 1 John 2:2;  Revelation 21:1-4.

20 Perfection!  What will it mean?  It will mean a return to life the way
Adam and Eve enjoyed it before they sinned against Jehovah God.
Physically, mentally, emotionally, morally, spiritually - in every way
imaginable - perfect humans wil fully meet God's standards.  But will
all people then be identical?  Far from it!  Jehovah's creations - trees,
flowers, animals - all teach us that he loves variety.  Perfect humans
will have different personalities and talents.  Each one will enjoy life
as God meant it to be.  Revelation 20:5 says:  "The rest of the dead did
not come to life until the thousand years were ended."  Like the great
crowd of Armageddon survivors, the resurrected ones will become fully
alive when they reach sinless perfection.

21 Perfect humans will face one final test.  At the end of the Millennium,
Satan and his demons will be released from the abyss for a short time and
will be permitted to make a final effort to turn people away from Jehovah.
Some will put wrong desires above love of God, but this rebellion will be
cut short.  Jehovah will execute these selfish ones along with Satan and
all his demons.  All wrongdoers will then be gone forever.
- Revelation 20:7-10.

                              WHAT WILL YOU DO?

22 Eternity will stretch out before those who love Jehovah God and will
dwell in the Paradise earth.  We can hardly imagine their joy, and you
too can share in this.  Music, art, crafts - why, perfect mankind's
achievements will surpass the finest works of the greatest masters in
the old world!  After all, humans will be perfect and will have
limitless time before them.  Imagine what you will be able to do as a
perfect human.  Think, too, of what you and fellow humans will learn
about Jehovah's creation - from the billions of galaxies across the
universe to the tiniest subatomic particles.  Everything that mankind
achieves will further delight the heart of our loving heavenly Father,
Jehovah. - Psalm 150:1-6.

23 Life then will not be boring.  It will get more and more interesting
as time goes on.  You see, there is no end to the knowledge of God.
(Romans 11:33)  Throughout eternity, there will always be more to learn
and new horizons to explore.  (Ecclesiastes 3:11)  And as you continue
to learn about Jehovah God, you will keep on living - not just a few
years but forever! - Psalm 22:26.

24 Is not a delightful future on a paradise earth worth any effort or
sacrifice you make?  Of course it is!  Well, Jehovah has extended to
you the key to that splendid future.  That key is the knowledge of God.
Will you use it?

25 If you love Jehovah, you will find delight in doing his will.
(1 John 5:3)  As you pursue that course, what blessings you will
experience!  If you apply the knowledge of God, it can bring you a
happier life even in this troubled world.  And the future rewards are
immense for this is the knowledge that leads to everlasting life!  Now
is the favorable time for you to act.  Be determined to live in harmony
with the knowledge of God.  Demonstrate your love for Jehovah.  Honor
his holy name and prove Satan a liar.  In turn, Jehovah God, the Source
of true wisdom and knowledge, will rejoice over you in his great and
loving heart.   (Jeremiah 31:3;  Zephaniah 3:17)  And he will love you
forever!

Becoming familiar with the Bible need not be difficult.  Use its table of
contents to learn the order and location of Bible books.

The books of the Bible have chapters and verses for easy reference.  The
chapter divisions were added during the 13th century, and a 16th century
French printer apparently divided the Greek scriptures into the present-day
verses.  The first complete Bible to have both chapter and verse numbers was
a French edition, published in 1553.
        
When Scriptures are cited in this book, the first number indicates the
chapter, and the next denotes the verse.  For example, the citation
"Proverbs 2:5" means the book of Proverbs, chapter 2, verse 5.  By looking
up the cited scriptures, you will soon feel at ease locating Bible texts.

The best way to become familiar with the Bible is to read it daily.  At
first, this may seem challenging.  But if you read from three to five
chapters a day, depending on their length, you will complete the reading of
the entire Bible in a year.  Why not start today?

   Through their public preaching activity, Jehovah's Witnesses point to
God's Kingdom as mankind's only hope for true peace and security.  But
these zealous proclaimers of God's Kingdom are by no means subversive to
the governments under which they live.  On the contrary, the Witnesses
are among the most respectful and law-abiding of citizens.  "If all the
religious denominations were like Jehovah's witnesses," said an official
in one African country, "we would have no murders, burglaries,
delinquencies, prisoners and atomic bombs.  Doors would not be locked day
in and day out."

   Recognising this, officials in mnay lands have allowed the preaching
work of the Witnesses to proceed unhindered.  In other lands, bans or
restrictions have been lifted when the authorities realized that Jehovah's
Witnesses are an influence for the good.  It is as the apostle Paul wrote
about obeying the superior authorities:  "Keep doing good, and you will
have praise from it." - Romans 13:1, 3.

@node "CE" "B.C.E. & C.E. - Their meaning"
@{b}@{u}B.C.E.  and  C.E.@{ub}@{uu}

   B.C.E. means "before the Common Era,"
   which is more accurate than B.C. ("before Christ").
   
   C.E. denotes "Common Era," often called A.D.,
   for anno Domini, meaning "in the year of our Lord."

@node "Registration"
@{b}@{u}Registration@{ub}@{uu}

This registration better enabled the Roman Empire to exact taxes.

Hence, Augustus unwittingly helped to fulfill a prophecy about a ruler who
would `cause an exactor to pass through the kingdom.'  The same prophecy
foretold that "the Leader of the covenant," or Messiah, would be "broken"
in the days of this ruler's successor.

Jesus was killed during the reign of Augustus' successor, Tiberius.
- Daniel 11:20-22.

@node "Weeks" "How the ancient Jews used the term `weeks'"
@{b}@{u}How the ancient Jews used the term `weeks'@{ub}@{uu}

The ancient Jews commonly thought in terms of weeks of years.

For instance, just as every seventh day was a Sabbath day, every seventh
year, was a Sabbath year. - Exodus 20:8-11;  23:10, 11.
@endnode

@node "Shiloh"
@{b}@{u}Shiloh@{ub}@{uu}

The name Shiloh means "He Whose It Is;  He to Whom It Belongs."  In time,
it became evident that "Shiloh" was Jesus Christ, "the Lion that is of the
tribe of Judah."  (Revelation 5:5)  Some of the Jewish Targums simply
replaced the word "Shiloh" with "the Messiah" or "the king Messiah."
@endnode

@node "World" "System of Things"
@{b}@{u}System of Things@{ub}@{uu}

Some Bibles use the word "world" instead of "system of things."
W. E. Vine's @{i}Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words@{ui} says that
the Greek word @{i}ai-on'@{ui} "signifies a period of indefinite duration,
or time viewed in relation to what takes place un the period."
Parkhurst's @{i}Greek and English Lexicon to the New Testament@{ui} (page 17)
includes the expression "this system of things" in discussing the
use of @{i}ai-o'nes@{ui} (plural) at Hebrews 1:2.  So the rendering
"system of things" is in harmony with the original Greek text.

@{b}@{u}Divorce@{ub}@{uu}

The only Scriptural ground for divorce allowing for remarriage is
"fornicaton" - sex relations outside the marriage. - Matthew 19:9

@node "Requirements" "Requirements for using `Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life'"
@toc "Help"
@{b}@{u}System Requirements@{ub}@{uu}

  Hardware requirements
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  An Amiga! 1Mb RAM (+ mouse!)

    o  Kickstart 2.04 (or higher)

  Software requirements
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  An "AmigaGuide" file viewer (supplied)

    o  An "IFF" file viewer (supplied)

    o  Bible files, if you wish to use the cross-references

    o  ONLY IF INSTALLING TO SEPARATE DISK,  (EG HARD DISK):

          -  400 Kb free space
          -  Commodore's Installer program
@endnode

@node "Installation"
@toc "Help"
@{b}@{u}Installation@{ub}@{uu}

  Running from floppy
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  You can just run the Knowledge book from this floppy disk,
       by double clicking it's icon - if you don't want to install it.

  Automatic Installation         (You need 465 Kb of free disk space)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  Double-click on the Install icon.

    o  Follow the on-screen instructions.

  Manual Installation
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  Drag the `Knowledge.Guide' file, to the destination directory
       on your hard disk, using the Workbench `drag' feature as explained
       in your instruction manual.  You do have one.... don't you? :)

    o  Drag the `MakeAssign' file into the same directory as above.

    o  Double click on the new `MakeAssign'.

    o  If you don't want to have to run `MakeAssign' all the time,
       then add this line to your S:User-startup file:

          -  Assign JW\KL: DESTINATION-DIRECTORY

       (Replacing DESTINATION-DIRECTORY, with the full path to
        the directory in which you placed `Knowledge.Guide')

  Warnings
  ~~~~~~~~
    o  When you install `Knowledge.Guide', you may crunch it if you
       wish, but if you do, you MUST ensure that the viewer you are
       using is capable of decompressing it, otherwise you will get
       rubbish!

    o  If you forget to make the assign `JW\KL:' to the directory in
       which `Knowledge.Guide' is in, you will get errors.
@endnode

@node "Problems" "Trouble-shooting - possible causes for errors"
@toc "Help"
@{b}@{u}Common Problems@{ub}@{uu}

  A requester is asking for JW\KL:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  You need to make an `assign' to the directory in which you have
       installed your `Knowledge.Guide' file.

    o  To do this, make sure that the file `MakeAssign' is in the same
       place, and double click it.  To make that assign permanent, see
       `Installation'.

  The contents of `Knowledge.Guide' seem scrambled
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    o  Did you compress the file?  If you did, you need to ensure that
       either:

           (a)  The file is successfully decompressed, or
           (b)  The file is uncompressed

    o  If not, try the version on the original install disk, and, if
       necessary, re-install it.

  It seems to contain funny codes, and there are no cross references
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    o  Sounds like you are using a text viewer, instead of a `Guide' one.

    o  Check that the default tool of `Knowledge.Guide' is set to
       `AmigaGuide', by clicking it's icon once, and choosing `Info' from
       the `Icon' menu.

    o  If you are without success, try the version on the original
       install disk, and re-install if necessary.

@{b}@{u}Using the Knowledge book@{ub}@{uu}

  Installed correctly?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  If you have everything installed correctly, then you should get
       the contents page of the book `The Knowledge That Leads to
       Everlasting Life', when you double-click on `Knowledge.Guide'.

    o  If the above is not the case, please refer to @{"Troubleshooting" link "Problems"}

  Main pages
  ~~~~~~~~~~
    o  Pages in this book are not always `turned', but have a scrolling
       mechanism with which you are probably already familar.

    o  To scroll the display, you can either:

          -  Press the UP/DOWN arrow keys on the keyboard.

          -  Click on the UP/DOWN arrow buttons with the left mouse
             button, that are on the right hand side of the display.

          -  Try it now!

    o  Sometimes pages may, for some reason, not have their full width
       displayed.  To `overcome' this, use the LEFT/RIGHT arrows in the
       same way as you used the up/down ones, either on the keyboard or
       with the mouse.

  Cross-reference buttons
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  Some pages contain cross references, like this --->  @{"A cross-ref!" link "Nowhere"}

       (The above is a dummy reference, and doesn't actually work!)

    o  These can (normally) be clicked with the left mousebutton, and
       they will take you to your cross-reference.

    o  When you have read the cross-reference, and wish to return to where
       you were, click on `Retrace' at the top of the screen.

  The Menu bar
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  You have likely noticed the numerous buttons at the top of the
       screen.  Here is an explanation of each:

    o  Contents:

          -  This returns you to the local table of contents.

          -  Each time you press it, you will go `up a level', and
             will soon be at the main Contents page, at the front of
             the book.

    o  Index:

          -  This normally takes you to an index of keywords, which,
             in turn, link to specific documents inside the book.

          -  Currently not in use, however!

    o  Help:

          -  This brings you to the help index, at any time.

    o  Retrace:

          -  As explained above, if you have clicked on multiple buttons,
             you can `retrace' your steps- to go back the way you came.

    o  Browse <:  (Browse with a `previous' arrow)

          -  This takes you to the document preceeding the one you are
             currently viewing.  Usually the previous chapter.

    o  Browse >:  (Browse with a `next' arrow)

          -  This takes you to the document suceeding the one you are
             currently viewing.  Usually the next chapter.

@{b}@{u}Using the Bible cross-references@{ub}@{uu}

  Requirements
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o  You need to have already installed the Bible, which I have also
       made available for the Amiga.  If you have not done so, you
       cannot take advantage of these references.

  Problems
  ~~~~~~~~
    o  If you have the Bible installed, (New World Translation as I have
       provided) then it needs to be installed correctly.  What is the
       problem?

          -  A requester is asking for `JW\Bible:'

             If you have installed it correctly, then there should be an
             assign provided already!  Look in your Bible directory, near
             Bible.Guide, and find `MakeAssign'.  Double-click on it, and
             this will solve the problem.

          -  It cannot locate the file, even though `JW\Bible:'
             is assigned.

             Hmmm... did you change the filenames?  Check the documentation
             for `Bible.Guide' and check that the filenames are correct,
             and in the right place.  IE:  In `JW\Bible:'

          -  The cross reference is not taking me to the exact location
             of the Scripture

             Ah.. yes.  This isn't YET supported.  In fact, I haven't YET
             added all cross-references, but when I do, I hope to make them
             display the page in the Bible containing the cited verse.

             For now, you'll have to use it manually!

The future of this book  (Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life kl-E)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  At present, I really need to add some finishing touches to this book.
For example, the cross-references are not yet complete.  This version does
not actually have the cross-references installed, but hopefully the next
version will.  Incidentally, this is Version 1.0.

  Then again, I might not.  I realise I cannot distribute this file [too
much!] because it is a Copyrighted publication by The Watch Tower Bible
and Tract Society.  Please let me know, if you want me to bother
furthering the detail in which this book has been electronically
re-produced.

Errors / spelling mistakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I haven't checked all this for spelling mistakes, but if you do find any,
please check with the printed edition, and inform me about it!  You may
modify this file for your own use only, and if you correct any mistakes,
I'd appreciate a copy of the corrected version!

Other publications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I am currently working on both the Bible (bi12-E) and the Insight books,
so please keep contacting me, asking me when I shall release it.  It'll
take a while yet though..... how would YOU like to do it..? :)

Author
~~~~~~
  Anyhow please keep me informed, and mail me any suggestions, or
corrections, as the case may be.
