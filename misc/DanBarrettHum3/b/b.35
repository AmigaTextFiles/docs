	Howdy, graphics fans.  Are you having trouble deciding which of the
many 24-bit boards to purchase?  Well, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED would like
to make a brief, honest, and polite comment on the recent debates in
c.s.a.graphics.

		****	GET REAL, YOU LOSERS!!!!   ****
	 	**** THERE'S A NEW BOARD IN TOWN!! ****

	Yes, it's time to wave "goodbye" to OPIUM-VISION, PICASS-HOLE,
CRETIN-A, PICKLE-O, HURLIN', and EGGHEAD-28!  Get lost, VIDEO TOAST-BURNER!
It's time to move over to the NEWEST and MOST EXCITING board around!!  It's
got the FEATURES!  It's got the SPEED!!  It's got FOUR THOUSAND BLITTERS!!!
And it's got one HELL of an ATTITUDE!!!!!!!  Please welcome the latest
addition to our ViolentWare series:

			    ** BLAZE-24 **

the LIGHTNING-FASTEST, HIGHEST RESOLUTION, MOST COLOR-RIDDEN graphics
enhancer available for ANY COMPUTER PLATFORM or plumbing fixture.

	Are you fed up with RIDICULOUS RESOLUTION RESTRICTIONS like 800x600
or 2048x1600?  Then let BLAZE-24 satisfy your INNERMOST FANTASIES with its
UNLIMITED, TOTALLY PROGRAMMABLE resolutions and depths!  Don't be FOOLED by
the name:  BLAZE-24 is NOT limited to 24 bits.  (The "24" refers to the
number of CENTURIES it would take for any other WIMPY company to come out
with a board this GREAT.)  Would you like a few billion bitplanes?  How
about a 1048576 x 3 screen for rendering poisonous snakes or FRACTAL GARDEN
HOSES??  NO PROBLEM!  BLAZE-24 DOES IT ALL!!!

	So, is BLAZE-24 flicker-free?  YOU BET!  Not only does it completely
eliminate flicker in all graphics modes on ANY display device, but its
POWERFUL ANTI-FLICKER RAYS radiate outward in ALL DIRECTIONS and DESTROY
FLICKER on ALL Amigas in a 100-kilometer radius!!!  Watch in amazement as
your LOVING NEIGHBORS show up at your home with LOVING CROWBARS because you
have unwittingly deinterlaced their television during the last ten seconds
of the Super Bowl!!  WHAT FUN!!!
		
	Those other USELESS boards may have you wondering:  "Zorro II or
Zorro III?"  Well, WONDER NO MORE.  BLAZE-24 bypasses the whole issue by
installing DIRECTLY INSIDE YOUR MONITOR for the ultimate in SPEED!  Never
more must you wait for slowpoke signals to LIMP and STAGGER from the Amiga
bus all the way up to the screen... BLAZE-24 IS RIGHT THERE WHERE IT COUNTS!!

	"But does it have a monitor pass-thru switch for compatibility?" you
snivel.  GET A LIFE!!!  REAL graphics boards don't NEED such WIMP-OUT
COMPROMISES.  That's why BLAZE-24 comes complete with a pass-thru for the
ENTIRE AMIGA MOTHERBOARD!!  Using our patented SNAGMONGER (TM) cabling
system, BLAZE-24 becomes such an "integrated" part of your computer that
you'll NEVER remove it, even if you WANTED TO!!

	So much for hardware... what about software??  Our Workbench
emulator, WEIRDBENCH, is 100% compatible with all software under all
versions of AmigaDOS.  Even copy-protected, hardware-banging games will run
on the board with NO PROBLEMS.  And trust me, you have NEVER experienced
ANYTHING IN LIFE that compares to seeing "BLAZEMONGER" itself running on the
BLAZE-24.  If you thought it was fast BEFORE, you are in for a BIIIIIIG
surprise.  BLAZEMONGER and BLAZE-24 are such a perfect combination that
you'd be an IDIOT not to buy BOTH!  In fact, even if you DO buy them, you're
probably STILL an idiot.  Hey, it's not OUR problem.

	BLAZE-24 has been EXTENSIVELY tested and shown to work on:

	o	All Amiga models
	o	Pocket calculators
	o	Etch-A-Sketch (TM)
	o	Most brands of contact lenses
	o	The Sun

	By now, you should be COMPLETELY CONVINCED that BLAZE-24 is the
ULTIMATE graphics board on the market today, far beyond those other HARDWARE
JOKES being discussed in this newsgroup.  If you don't believe me, try
BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's new "try before you buy" plan.  Put a BLAZE-24
and any of our competitors' boards into your machine simultaneously and run
a few programs.  If the other graphics board isn't reduced to a PILE of
ASHES within MINUTES, then return your BLAZE-24 (assuming you can uninstall
it :-)) to our "Customer Service" department for a full refund.  And for
your benefit, be sure to include a detailed note explaining why "Customer
Service" should not try to "convince" you to reconsider your decision.

	So try BLAZE-24 today!  It costs only $24.95 for the board, plus a
mere $89,999.99 for cabling.  We GUARANTEE that you will enjoy your new
BLAZE-24... or else!!
