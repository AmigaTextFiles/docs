	Lawrence Bishop is a WEENIE who obviously doesn't even have the
strength to hold down his SHIFT KEY and capitalize BLAZEMONGER correctly.

	Anyway, to dispel all rumors, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is NOT the
mysterious financial backer.  Sad to say, in 1992 our net profits were down
because we poured over 5000% of our earnings back into R&D, in preparation
for the next generation of BLAZEMONGER-type games.  So we don't have the
ready cash available to bail out CBM.

	Despite what people may think, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is not a
wealthy company.  We are a small-time operation with fewer than 20
employees, all working in a reconditioned gorilla slaughterhouse in
Chickenmilk, Wisconsin.  Our annual net income for sales of BLAZEMONGER and
related products is under $600,000 (US), mainly because our software is so
inexpensive; for example, BLAZEMONGER itself is only $9.95.  Luckily, many
of our customers send in voluntary donations to help us stay afloat, thanks
largely to the efforts of our legendary "Customer Service" department.

	Since most of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's employees maintain a fairly
low profile (due to shyness, legal reasons, etc.), here's a brief overview
of the people who bring BLAZEMONGER to your door!

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
====================

	The heart and soul of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED are the people who
actually build the programs.  We maintain a staff of 3 software engineers,
headed by the charismatic and genocidal Bobby Blazebleeder.  Bobby, who was
interviewed in c.s.a.advocacy a few months ago (e-mail me for a copy if you
didn't see it), uses his unique combination of programming brilliance,
senseless violence, and European fashion modeling to create unparalleled
games that are mindblowing, self-destructive, and yet strangely beautiful.
Bobby handles a lot of the low-level programming (3 or 4 levels lower than
machine code) and does all of the graphics.  And they are VERY graphic
indeed. :-)

	Next, we have Ivan "The Terrible" Knackerthrasher who specializes in
databases and data compression/encryption.  Ivan's the guy who managed to
fit all those millions of game levels onto a single disk for quick and
efficient access.  He's also our copy protection whiz.  Ivan takes delight
in designing ever more difficult and outlandish protection schemes to
frustrate the WIMPY crackers who attempt to deprotect our products.  At the
moment, he's developing a new system which is top-secret, but I can tell you
that it has its roots in voodoo and human sacrifice.  Crackers, you have
been warned!

	Finally, there's Snortygord "The Even More Terrible Than Ivan But
Still A Baby Lamb Compared To Bobby" Zonkerdoodle.  Snorty, who hails from a
little-known European country -- so little-known, in fact, that even Snorty
herself doesn't remember the name -- is responsible for gameplay and user
interfaces, and her skills are obvious to even the most novice BLAZEMONGER
player.  It is her brilliant design that allows 26 players to compete
simultaneously using only 1 joystick.

SALES & MARKETING
=================

	We employ 4 people in Sales & Marketing, or "S&M" as we call it.
Direct sales (products purchased directly from us by end-users) are handled
by Tina "Electro-Prod" Zazzer, and our dealer contact is Ben Pontoon.  Tina
and Ben work together frequently to spread the word about BLAZEMONGER.  In
fact, last year, they went so far as to rent Carnegie Hall in New York City
and singlehandedly perform an original opera based on our products.
Newspaper reviews of "BLAZE ON, DOODZ" reportedly were "mixed", but you have
to admire Tina and Ben for their effort and creativity, if not their sheer
tastelessness.

	Since BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED loves to attend trade shows, we have
an employee specifically for this purpose.  By a COMPLETELY bizarre
coincidence, his name happens to be "Irving Gould."  (I must emphasize that
this is NOT the same Irving Gould who is CEO of Commodore.)  Those of you
who have visited our famous "Wall Of Flames" booth at conferences and shows
will no doubt remember Irving as the 8-foot-tall Sumo wrestler wearing a
string bikini and mirrored sunglasses, handing out leaflets, answering
questions, and posing for photographs.

	Finally, there's our advertising guru, Stan Slan.  Stan does ad
layout and package design, gets our ads into magazines, and contracts out to
local mental institutions for new marketing ideas.  He's also our subliminal
advertising (BUY BLAZEMONGER) expert who never misses a chance to push our
product.

	The S&M department also works closely with our "Customer Service"
department to help, um, "convince" prospective buyers that they need our
wares.

"LEGAL" DEPARTMENT
==================

	Ron Nibbly, our "legal" guy, handles sensitive issues and keeps the
company out of trouble.  Ron received his law degree from the Harvard
Stanford School of Advanced Psychosis here in Chickenmilk, Wisconsin,
specializing in computer game law, weapons law, monster rights, and (in his
words) "post-nuclear-holocaust gameshow custody battles."  No, I don't know
what that is either; but if it ever happens, we're prepared.

	Ron is also the genius behind capitalizing "BLAZEMONGER", an idea
which has really paid off.  Not only does it make the name easier to
recognize, but also it lets us sue anybody who capitalizes it incorrectly.
(Watch it, Gregg. :-))

"CUSTOMER SERVICE"
==================

	By now, EVERYBODY has heard about our "Customer Service" department,
so I'm sure it needs no introduction.  It is common knowledge on USENET and
beyond that all customer problems are, um, "dealt with" quickly,
efficiently, and with as little mess as possible.  Nobody *ever* complains
twice.

	"Customer Service" is populated by "Vito", "Bruno", "Mad Marvin",
"Really Mad Raymond", "Helpful Henrietta", and "Interstellar Stella."  These
are not their real names, of course -- those are kept secret, in case any of
our customers want to "thank" them for being "too helpful."

ADMINISTRATIVE
==============

	BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED would fall to pieces and burn if it weren't
for the tireless efforts of our administrative duo, Pip and Zip.  Pip and
Zip -- who are inseparable, never going anywhere without each other -- are a
super-efficient team who keep the office running smoothly.  If you ever call
us on the phone, chances are that you'll speak first with Pip and Zip.
Probably simultaneously.

	(Frankly, I haven't the slightest idea where the fuck Pip and Zip
came from.  They just showed up one day and started filing papers.  They
have never asked for any money, even though they work hard practically 24
hours a day, so we said "what the hell" and let them stay.)

	Finally, there's me, of course. :-)  I am President and Chief
Propgandist, as well as the USENET liaison for the company.  From me, you
get the press releases, product announcements, and general lies, smoke, and
mirrors. :-)

	I hope that this little glimpse into the inner workings of
BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED was interesting!  I don't know how typical we are
of small-time Amiga software companies, but we all get along pretty well
in our "warm and homey" atmosphere.  At least when Bobby is heavily sedated.

	BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is an equal-opportunity employer and does
not discriminate on the basis of age, race, gender, nor sexual orientation
(horizontal or vertical), and complies with most of the terms of the Geneva
Convention.
