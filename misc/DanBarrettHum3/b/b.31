	With so many prominent Amiga WEENIE-HEADS talking about "jumping
ship" recently, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED has decided to do something about
the problem.

	Something unusual.

	Something drastic.

	Something just plain WEIRD.

	As of May 15, 1993, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED itself will be
officially "jumping ship" too!!  Yes, we've been with you all these years,
producing ViolentWare in our secret headquarters in Chickenmilk,
Wisconsin... but it is time for a change.  Time for a little... heh heh...
"ship-jumping."

	And so, on May 15, at exactly midnight our time, the entire "crew"
of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED will cast off from shore in our brand new luxury
yacht, "The Flesh-Hacker."  We will proceed at VERY high velocity, straight
out to the middle of the ocean, until we reach an as-of-yet undisclosed
location.  Donning our custom, pressure-resistant SCUBA gear, we will then --
officially, literally, and with mind-blowing SOUND EFFECTS -- jump ship.

	Moments later, "The Flesh-Hacker" will explode in an awe-inspiring
display of highly illegal pyrotechnics.  And BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's
devoted staff will swim downward into the murky depths... to our brand new
corporate headquarters!!

	Yes, it's true.  For the past year and a half, we've been secretly
building a new, truly high-tech installation at the bottom of the ocean.  We
have many happy memories of Rancho Destructo, our old hangout in Chickenmilk,
and we hate to see it go.  But these are Troubled Times, and drastic measures
are called for.  Only in our new underwater think-tank can we complete
development of the latest game in our ViolentWare series:

			BLAZEMONGER LXXVI:
			The Atlantis/Bronchitis Connection
				or
			"Bloody Lungs of Steel"

	I can't give away too many details of the new game yet.  But one of
the more deadly levels requires you to toss thousands of cheap '486 clones
off a ravine into a river of boiling saliva.  Each PC has a well-known
Amigan's name on it, and it's your goal to destroy them before each Amigan
"jumps ship" and trades in his/her Amiga for a clone.  Some of the PC's are
booby-traps, though, so watch out!  (The one monogrammed "-MB-" is
particularly nasty.)  Watch for "BM LXXVI" late in the 5th Quarter of 1993.

	Finally, in honor of our new aquatic enterprise, BLAZEMONGER's
"Customer Service" department would like to announce that the following
types of USENET jokes are now punishable by death (see your manual, volume
91, section 584):

		"BLAZEMONGER is all wet..."
		"BLAZEMONGER has sunk to new depths..."
		"BLAZEMONGER is all washed up..."
		"BLAZEMONGER bails out..."

and any other WATERY and SLANDEROUS references.  So unless you enjoy having
your private parts fed to rabid woodchucks:  DON'T MESS.

	Tickets for our yacht launch and the subsequent "mushroom cloud"
party will be on sale at finer Amiga dealers around the world.  (Though
transportation may be tricky. :-)) See you there, maybe?

                                                        Dan
