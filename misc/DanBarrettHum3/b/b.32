	Another year has passed, and another BLAZE-FEST has come and gone!
"What is a 'BLAZE-FEST'," I hear you cry?  Oh, just the ULTIMATE, SECRET,
BY-INVITATION-ONLY social experience on the PLANET!!  The most recent one
was held in May in California's DECADENT South Bay area, and gossip
columnists worldwide are speculating on what happened.  Now, YOU can know
the UNBELIEVABLE truth!!

	The TOP-SECRET meeting place for this year's BLAZE-FEST was Fontana's
Italian Restaurant in Cupertino.  The Amigans in attendance were:

		Dan Barrett (wearing the legendary BLAZEMONGER T-shirt)
		Jonathan Cano
		Bob Cosby & Marsha Kohl	
		Andy Finkel
		Gleeep
		Dale Luck
		David Masterson
		Mike Meyer
		Leo Schwab
		Mike Schwartz
		Dan Zerkle

plus a few of my other friends from the music world:

		Ranjit Padmanabhan
		Rob Rosen

A few SNIVELING INFIDELS were RUDE enough to miss the BLAZE-FEST at the last
minute due to incredible stupidity or car trouble:

		Mike Haas
		Mike Smithwick

and they have both been beaten senseless with concrete slabs and "Nerf"
weapons.

	And now the tale begins....  Even before the dinner started, there
were signs that trouble was brewing.  First, Bob and Marsha mysteriously
vanished, leaving behind only a barely legible, handwritten note saying
something about "boiled walrus."  Next, when Leo and I DARED to ask the
waiters for separate food and alcohol checks, this was greeted with icy
stares, mad laughter, and a flying cleaver from the kitchen, barely missing
Gleeep's jugular vein.  Undaunted, we ordered appetizers.

	Against everyone's better judgement, the trio of 3DO Amigans (Andy,
Dale, and Leo) got ahold of a few gallons of wine, and then things REALLY
started happening.  Andy LEAPED up onto the table, brandishing a sharpened
CD-ROM disc, and demanded pasta IMMEDIATELY.  As the shocked serving crew
tried to accommodate his urgent desires, Dale started covering the windows
of the restaurant with toilet tissue and duct tape, and Leo whipped out a
full-scale model of the Starship Enterprise and fired photon torpedoes at
random diners.

	Somehow, the restaurant staff managed to notify the police, but
Mike Schwartz kept them baffled and at bay with sordid tales of the GNU
C compiler and assembly optimizations.  A few officers nearly reached our
table, but David Masterson was there with his "Amiga" hat, fooling them
into thinking this was a DevCon and they had reached the wrong place.

	In the midst of this confusion, the main courses arrived, and
Jonathan wasted no time in swapping everybody's food around, while Dan Zerkle
began a maniacal speech on the state of Californian politics.  (Soon to be
posted in c.s.a.announce!)  Ranjit and Rob tried in vain to keep order, but
they were thwarted as Mike Meyer, swinging a wrecking ball above his head,
laid waste to half of the restaurant.

	Needless to say, we skipped dessert.

	The final bill was nothing short of astronomical (not to mention
gastronomical), but we sent a few "Customer Service" representatives to
"discuss" the matter, and it was quickly resolved.

	Not content to end the evening so early -- it was only 4:00am at
this point -- about half of the partygoers went out for ice cream at a local
establishment called "The Meltdown."  There, we learned the finer points of
how to stand on both ends of the serving line simultaneously.  Afterwards, we
descended on an innocent bookstore, read everything in the shop, and shook
the place to its foundation.  Best book of the evening:  "Goat Mascara, My
Way" by Spiro Agnew.

	Finally, we parted ways, tears in our eyes, swearing eternal
friendship and fire-branding "Amiga" logos on each others' butt cheeks.

	Yes, it was history in the making, Amiga fans!  Sites of the
previous BLAZE-FESTS have been:

		March  1993:	Vancouver, British Columbia
		August 1992:	San Francisco, California

WHO KNOWS when a BLAZE-FEST may show up in your hometown?  Heh heh heh....

                                                        Dan
