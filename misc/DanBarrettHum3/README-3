INTRODUCTION

	By popular demand, here is a collection of humorous articles about
the Commodore Amiga that I wrote and posted in the USENET comp.sys.amiga
newsgroups during 1993.  These continue the subjects found in my first two
compilations, DanBarrettHumor.lzh and DanBarrettHumor2.lzh.  I recommend
that you get the originals before you read these articles.

	The articles in the "b" subdirectory are about BLAZEMONGER, the
fastest and most amazing computer game ever created.  The articles in the
"j" ("joke") subdirectory are about other important Amiga topics that were
discussed on USENET. :-)

	Have fun... and BLAZE ON, DOODZ!!


*** WARNING ***

	Recent psychological studies at the Harvard Stanford University of
	Advanced Psychosis have shown that these articles may cause the
	reader to believe he/she is a duck.  Symptoms may include:  a sudden
	desire to jump into a pond, growth of feathers, and a mysterious
	"quacking" noise that seems to come from all directions at once.
	Anyone experiencing these symptoms should telephone local law
	enforcement officials who will promptly call you a nut and hang up.
	YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
