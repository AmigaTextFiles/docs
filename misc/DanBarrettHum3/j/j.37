	Poor Marc.  Because we insist on being so clueless, he's forced
to post over and over, preventing him from having an actual life.  <sniff>
Makes me weepy just thinking about it.

	But he's right about worshipping the Amiga religiously.  Personally,
I have a fifty-meter-high fire-burning altar in my backyard, and I perform
daily ritual sacrifices to the gods Ur-Ving and Hae-Nee, proclaiming their
awesome majesty.  Once a week, the local Amiga group comes over and we all
set our nostril hairs aflame and ride around in our "Only Amiga" go-karts.

>It has been shown over and over again that the Amiga is inferior....
>But you just REFUSE to accept it.

	My gosh... HE'S RIGHT!!!  And all these years, somehow I missed it.
Yes, I've been doing serious work on Amigas for six years now, and somehow I
never noticed the zillions of problems that plague Marc's nightmares.  Well,
I guess I'll just have to trade in my Amigas now.  Maybe I'll buy some
baseball cards instead.  Or become a monk.  Or maybe become a monk baseball
player.  Just call me Brother Homer....

	(I still think Marc is going to make a great politician someday.
Notice the phrase "it has been shown."  Notice that it really means,
"I have said repeatedly."  Isn't the passive voice FUN??? :-)  Remove
the nouns and you have *instant* authority!!)

>heavily in denial over it, is the day I will stop posting to the Amiga
>newsgroups.

	Oooh, I just LOVE a man with a MISSION!!  He's so SEXY!!!  Does he
wear a colorful COSTUME with a big red "MB" emblazoned on the chest, as
he seeks out wrongthinkers and bravely SETS THEM STRAIGHT??  Hmmm... this
is a good idea for a song, don't you think???

	(Sung to the tune of "Brave Sir Robin" from the movie "Monty Python
	and the Holy Grail")

		Bravely brave Marc Barrett
		Came forth from Iowa.
		He was not afraid to flame,
		No, brave Marc Barrett!
		He was not at all afraid to tell all of us we're wrong!
		Brave, brave, brave, brave Marc Barrett!

		He was not in the least bit scared to predict Amiga's death.
		Nor the death of CDTV, and the Video Toaster!
		He'll post and post until poor Commodore is burned away,
		And its product line demolished, brave Marc Barrett!
		When Ramsey's dead, and Denise is gone,
		And Agnus bleeding and Portia cracked
		And Paula exploded and Gary melted
		Oh, then......

		Brave Marc will run away.
		Bravely run away away.
		When Commodore is finally dead
		He'll bravely leave and go to bed.
		Yes Brave Sir Marc will turn about
		And no more garbage he will spout.
		Bravely taking to his feat
		He'll beat a very brave retreat!
		Bravest of the brave... Marc Barrett!!!

	Hey, what prize do you win when you're done?  The Holy Grail?
The admiration of the masses?  (Hint: if you think it's the latter,
then you might want to consider a different quest....)
