	When Sergio Ruocco kindly asked me to contribute an article for these
proceedings, I was very excited.  You see, I am an Amiga programmer too, and
I have always dreamed of sharing my favorite programming tips at a
conference full of experts!  The following article explains the ten most
effective secrets for writing the ultimate Amiga program.

	For years, I've been reading millions of "programmer tips" articles
in magazines, and personally, they make me sick.  No matter how clever the
suggestions are, the authors always forget one very important point: if you
are the programmer, then YOU ARE IN CHARGE.  Who CARES what the users think?
If they don't like the way your program works, then let the ignorant fools
write their own.

	With this in mind, I hereby present 10 programmer tips for the real
world.  These are GUARANTEED to triple your productivity within 24 hours!
Well, at least double it.  Or maybe cut it in half.  I forget.  But they will
DEFINITELY help you; and if they don't, then you have my permission to throw
these conference proceedings off a cliff and go join a religious cult.

(1) Don't plan your program in advance.

	Seriously, now... planning your program in advance is a total waste
of time, and you know it.  Programming is an art form; and as sensitive
artists, we must not be rushed into making decisions.  Will your program
have a command-line or a graphic interface?  An ARexx port?  Will it be a
database or a shoot-em-up game?  IT DOESN'T MATTER.  Just start coding, and
worry about these insignificant details later.

	Even better, just start COMPILING... even before you have decided
what your program is going to be.  Running the compiler or assembler a lot
before you write any code will "warm up" your computer, and your software
will have fewer bugs.  Trust me.  I ran my compiler 50 times last night
without writing a single line of code, and so far my program has no bugs.

(2) Don't use the standard libraries.

	No real Amiga programmers use the stuff in LIBS:, or even Kickstart.
It is FAR better to do all the work yourself and create an entire operating
system from scratch.  This is REALLY impressive.  Your users will be stunned,
and beautiful, sexy movie stars from around the world will travel thousands
of miles to ask you out on dates.  Believe me, it's true.  I have a hot date
with Cindy Crawford tonight because she loves my custom Exec list structures.

(3) Don't use "Make".

	Face it:  "Make" is for wimps.  REAL programmers KNOW which files
are compiled and which ones aren't.

(4) Keep your user interface inconsistent.

	Who needs standards?  It is much better if every programmer invents
his/her/its own user interface style, for three reasons.  First, it lets
programmers be creative and helps to relieve stress.  Second, by making your
program harder to use, it gives users valuable practice in working with
difficult software.  Finally, we know that users are incredibly lazy
creatures, and a little suspense keeps them in shape.  It's for their own
good.

	So, don't be afraid to take some chances and make your interface
really unique!  Instead of the right mouse button, use double-clicks to bring
up menus.  Make your window resize gadgets act like close gadgets, and
vice-versa.  Fix your text color and background color to be the same.  Be
inventive, and your users will thank you for it.

(5) Hard-code your fonts.

	Why waste time making your program font-sensitive?  Hey, if "Topaz 8"
is good enough for Commodore, it's good enough for everyone.  Or to make your
programs look truly unique, I recommend using a really obscure third-party
font (e.g., "WalrusBreath 91-point").  If the font isn't found in the user's
FONTS: directory, then your program should put up a polite, friendly
requestor and then crash.

(6) Hard-wire all your screens to 320x256 PAL (or 320x71 in NTSC).

	Some users will complain if programs don't take advantage of
overscan, but they are just whiners.  YOU wrote the program, so YOU will
know which screen sizes are best.  And while you are at it, you should also
hard-code the palette and number of bitplanes.  That will teach those pesky
users a lesson.

(7) Use heavy copy protection.

	Especially for freeware, where dongle protection is a must.

(8) Ignore playability.

	Hey, if the users can't play your game, they're wimps.  Let them
go play checkers instead.

(9) Write all of your documentation at the last minute.

	If you want complete freedom in your programming, it simply is not
practical to write your manuals early.  Wait until later:  say, after the
program has been shipping for a few months.  By then, you will have a good
idea of what the program can do, and you're reading to create the docs.

	If possible, avoid paper manuals entirely and document the whole
program in a "README" file on the program disk.  I know that some users don't
like README files because the information often isn't presented in a natural
order.  So, if you feel obligated to please your users, I recommend running
your README file through C:Sort.

	Another option is to use Commodore's AmigaGuide format.  This is an
excellent idea, but many programs do not take full advantage of this
hypermedium.  In most AmigaGuide documents I've seen, fewer than 10% of the
words appear as buttons.  For maximum benefit, EVERY word should be a
button... even the AmigaGuide window title bar.

	If you do decide to use on-line documentation, you might consider
putting it on a BBS instead of on disk, so you can make changes to it easily.
If you are feeling nice, you can even tell your users the BBS telephone
number, but this is not required.  (To make things easier, put the phone
number in the documentation file.)

(10) Don't use the Commodore Installer.

	When it was introduced, the Commodore Installer was a significant
advance over manual installation.  Instead of forcing the user to make
Assigns and execute obscure "Copy" commands, the Installer guides the user
through a friendly set of easy-to-understand prompts, such as "Please insert
directory 'READ/WRITE_ERROR' in any drive."

	Nowadays, however, the Installer has been replaced by more powerful
utilities.  The best one available today is called BLAZE-INSTALL, created by
those ultimate programmers at BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED.  BLAZE-INSTALL is so
easy to use that you don't even need a single mouse-click to install the
software.  Heck, you don't even have to insert the installation disk!  Just
unwrap the package, and BLAZE-INSTALL does the rest.  If a file is missing,
BLAZE-INSTALL automatically generates it... even complete programs!  In
fact, BLAZE-INSTALL is the last program you (or anybody) will ever need to
buy, since it can create any other piece of software in existence.  So I
guess we programmers should all just go home and find other jobs.


	Well, those are my 10 most useful Amiga programming tips.  I hope
that you found them useful, or at least mildly destructive.  If you'd like
further information on Amiga programming, I strongly recommend the books
"Amiga Tips, Tricks, and Terrorism" by Ira Sadist, and "Kicking the Hell out
of Kickstart" by Pal Booter.  Have fun!
