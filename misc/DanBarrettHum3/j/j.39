	Hey, assembly programmers!!!!!!!!!

	Are you TIRED of the SAME OLD, BORING programming tools??

	Do you crave something more EXCITING???

	BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED, makers of the well-known "ViolentWare"
software series for the Amiga, is very proud to announce the availability of
its latest product:  a new assembly language programming environment for the
Amiga!  Yes... after examining all the of current crop of TOTALLY WIMPY,
DEAD SLOW assembly products, we have finally decided to release our own,
entitled...

				OrgASM!!!!!!

	OrgASM is the FASTEST, most INTENSE, and most USER-FRIENDLY
assembler EVER created!  Watch your hard disk SHAKE with DESIRE as you
create AMAZING code EFFORTLESSLY!!  We guarantee that our users will
experience nothing but PURE PLEASURE from our OrgASM.

	Over the years, many of you programmers have complained that you
can't create programs that run as fast as BLAZEMONGER, our flagship
product.  Now, we are putting the power directly into your hands!!  If you
have the NEED for SPEED, you'll LOVE OrgASM -- it gives the term "hardware
banging" a WHOLE NEW MEANING!!!

	OrgASM is a versatile, multi-level programming environment which can
be used in several ways, depending on the programmer's mood.  Our special
"Quickie Mode" gives instant satisfaction for people without much free time
or patience.  Alternatively, if you're a programmer who really likes to get
your hands dirty, "Master Mode" lets you get a real feel for your programs,
with pleasant and surprising results.

	Perhaps the most exciting part of OrgASM is its extended instruction
set.  Check out these new language features!!

o	The MOV (move) instruction has been replaced by the more powerful and
	explicit WGL (wiggle), UND (undulate), and THR (thrust) instructions!

o	You have NEVER seen LOOPS like the ones supported by OrgASM!  Watch
	in AWE as your loops repeat over, and over, and OVER, and *OVER*,
	increasing in intensity, until they EXPLODE in an uninhibited
	PASSION FRENZY!!!

But that's not all!!  OrgASM also gives you:

***	SpASM, our INCREDIBLE register allocation OPTIMIZER!!  SpASM causes
	the stack pointer (sp) to WRITHE and LEAP all over the address space
	in pure, unadulterated ECSTACY!

***	HangBang, our UNBELIEVABLE crash recovery tool!!  Guaranteed to
	un-hang ANY computer, no matter HOW well hung it is!!!

***	COP-U-L8R, the ULTIMATE utility for coding those SCROLLING COPPER
	LIST DEMOS, D00DZ!!!

***	Programs with multiple threads of control are created EFFORTLESSLY
	with the help of our unique programmer's tool, Multi-OrgASM!!  Four
	out of five programmers surveyed called Multi-OrgASM "the greatest
	invention EVER!"  (The fifth programmer was found unconscious and
	smiling in a puddle of drool, and could not be revived in time to
	comment.)  Try Multi-OrgASM and find out why people everywhere are
	saying, "It's great!!!  Every programmer should have one!  Or
	several!"

	What about copy protection, you ask?  Of COURSE!!  In the true
BLAZEMONGER tradition, OrgASM is HEAVILY copy protected.  Believe me, you
have NEVER seen a dongle that looks like THIS before!!!!

	It should be OBVIOUS now that OrgASM is the ULTIMATE handy
programmer's tool!!!  But don't just take OUR word for it!  Listen to what
the EXPERTS have to say!!!

o	"Nothing else even comes [sic] close!!!"

				An anonymous SAS/C representative

o	"OrgASM opens the gates to new levels of productivity... and even
	reproductivity!"

				Dr. Ruth Westheimer

o	"Multi-OrgASM is, without a doubt, the most intense programming
	experience of my career!  I don't know how I got along without it!"

				M. Sinz

o	"If our students knew how much fun OrgASM is to use, our Computer
	Science Department would be overrun with applications!"

				C. McDoofus, Chairperson
				Computer Science Department
				Harvard Stanford School of Advanced Psychosis
				Chickenmilk, Wisconsin

o	"Buy OrgASM, or we will tie your nookers together with razor wire!"

				"Vinnie"
				BLAZEMONGER "Customer Service"

	But wait!  There's more!!!  Buy OrgASM before October 1, 1993, and
you will receive a FREE COPY of our brand new disk optimizer, ReOrgASM!!!

	So try OrgASM today!!!  Use it regularly, and you'll create a whole
FAMILY of products in no time!!!  OrgASM is available at finer Amiga vendors
everywhere.  We close with some WORDS OF WISDOM from the infamous Bobby
Blazebleeder, ULTIMATE programmer and creator of OrgASM:

	"Remember, young programmers -- the length of your
	 code is not NEARLY as important as its WIDTH!"

                                                        Dan
