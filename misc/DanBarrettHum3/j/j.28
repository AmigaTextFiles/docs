	Oooh... oh great and powerful Swami, bestow upon us your eternal
wisdom so we may achieve inner elightenment and realize what mere worms we
are in your presence.  Our eyes look up, but we see not.  Our ears stick
out, but we hear not.  Our tongues hang down, but we taste not.  And yet, in
the name of the Holy Cumquat of SEEDY RAHM, God of Unexploited Multimedia
Opportunities, we praise thy name and ask for your humble forgiveness and
back-issues of National Geographic featuring remote tribes who build statues
of you and make hourly sacrifices to your omniscient omnipresence.  Fear
not, simple people, for the true savior of Planet Earth, and maybe even
Iowa, walks among us and graces our unworthy souls with the true wisdom of
experience and strong hallucinogenics.  Bow, mortal, and lick the
all-knowning toenails of his Extreme Regressiveness, lest ye be damned to
eternal torture and forced to read all of his postings all over again, in
triplicate.  So join me in everlasting prayer to the master of marketing,
the genius of ingenuousness, the most holy of hypocrites, THE ALL-FATHER OF
AMIGA FATE:

		"Our father, who art in Iowa,
		Hollow be thy head,
		Thy ideas run,
		Thy will be done,
		At Commodore as it is at Apple.
		Give us this day our daily stupid postings
		And lead us not into forbidden pastry shops
		Where we may discover cheese-filled tibits of dubious origin.
		Amen."

>what needs to be done.

	Gee, gang... Marc used to be a developer!  One who never produced any
products, to my knowledge.  And he made a lot of, uh, "friends" at Commodore
too, from what I have heard.
