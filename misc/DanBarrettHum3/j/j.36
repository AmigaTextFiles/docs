REVIEW

	I'd been reading for years on USENET about Kickstart 1.3 ROM chips,
so I finally decided to get one myself and try it out!  My dealer wanted $25
for it, which is more than I can afford on my meager salary, so I managed to
talk him down to $10.  Whew!

	Full of excitement, I rushed home to play with my new toy!!  I
ripped open the packaging,

opened the static-protective bag, and took a close look at the chip.  As
expected, it looks just like a rectangular thingy with little legs sticking
out of the bottom.  Sorta like a huge bug.  I've heard some people say that
Kickstart 1.3 was a huge bug, but that's another story.

	Strangely, the thing came with absolutely no instructions for its
use.  What was I supposed to do?  I tried plugging it into the parallel port,
but that just produced a big cloud of smoke from inside the tower case.
Well, no matter.  I've got Gold Service.

	Still puzzled, I tried sticking the little chip legs into my
forehead.  With a little patience and a large hammer, I eventually got
the pesky little chip to stay in place.  Success!!  Then I lay back in
my chair and waited for something to happen.

	For a time, there was no effect, and I began to wonder if my
purchase had been a mistake.  But then... I heard something!  Nine quick
little musical notes which sounded tantalizingly familiar....  Wagner,
perhaps?  My face suddenly began to heat up.  I rushed to the mirror, only
to see that my eyes had turned a dark grey!!  I watched in stark amazement
as the color shifted to light gray, and then white.  Words began to flash
past my eyes.  I heard a mysterious voice shout, "Amiga: Born A Champion!"

	Panicking now, I clamped my hands down over my eyes and ears.  BAD
mistake!!  This evidently caused a reboot and the whole thing happened
AGAIN.  Oh, my aching head!  I grabbed the ROM chip and pulled as hard as I
could, ripping the little legs out of my flesh and scattering tiny pieces of
skull on the carpet.  Suddenly, quiet.  I breathed a sigh of relief.

	Totally intense, man!


LIKES AND DISLIKES

	My favorite part is definitely the little legs.  They are so cute!
My only dislike is that there should be a warning on the packaging stating
that installing the chip in your forehead is a bad idea.


COMPARISON TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS

	It doesn't word-process as well as Final Copy II.  But it is
physically much smaller than a Video Toaster.


CONCLUSIONS

	The Kickstart 1.3 ROM is a unique product; there's nothing else
on the market exactly like it.  I highly recommend it as a mind-expanding
experience.  Alternatively, you can use it for practical jokes by leaving
it on fat people's chairs with the sharp little legs sticking upward.
