	Yes, I am selling a mint-condition copy of Fish Disk number 1, the
very first Amiga freeware disk in the famous Fred Fish collection.  It
features programs by people whose names have become synonymous with "Amiga"
-- Charlie Heath (of MicroSmiths and ARP), Perry Kivolowitz (of ASDG),
Michael Mountier (now at Moonlighter Software), Dale Luck (of GfxBase), Eric
Lavitsky, and many others!

	You can own this priceless collector's item for a mere $350.00 (US).
Only Fools would turn down a price like this!!  I'll even throw in overnight
shipping for free.

	I really like this disk, but I have decided it's time to upgrade to
Fish Disk number 2.

	Serious replies only.  Thanks!

                                                        Dan
