Subject: Marc Barrett's first C program?
Date: 8 Jan 93 21:25:32 GMT


	Over the years, Marc Barrett has made a number (17,948) of negative
statements about the Amiga, as well as some suggestions of how to change
it.  And yet we have seen no programs written by him.  What do Marc's
programs look like?  The following is my best guess.

	Please note the credits, since the original idea was not mine.

/* MB.c:	A fantasy about Marc Barrett's first C program.
 *		Inspired by a posting by Paul Theodoropoulos.  (The printf.)
 *		Code by Dan "No Relation" Barrett.
 *		Spurred into reality by Marc "No Relation Either" Atkin.
 *
 * Created in Wordperfect 4.1:  the ultimate programmer's editor.
 * Anything else simply is not productivity software.
 *
 * This code is copyrighted and in the public domain.  You can give
 * out copies as long as you send in the shareware fee.  I hope that
 * Commodore will use this code in the next release of the pathetic,
 * useless, primitive Amiga operating system.
