	Guess what, Net doodz?  I WAS RIGHT!!  HA HA HA HA HAAAA!!!!

	Yes, with the recent announcement of the A4000/030 at $2395 MSRP
(Manufacturer's Suggested Ridiculous Price), I have been PROVEN RIGHT in the
AMAZING PREDICTIONS I made in this newsgroup.  I am so PROUD of myself.
Aren't you?  I mean, why not just KNEEL DOWN RIGHT NOW and LICK MY TOES??
Whatsmatter... CHICKEN??  (Well, actually, they taste more like fish.)

	In case you have forgotten my AMAZING PREDICTIONS, I will remind
you of them, you silly, worthless worm...

Prediction:	Commodore will announce an Amiga 4000 with a 68030 CPU.
Result:		YES!  AMAZING!!!

Prediction:	Commodore will price the new machine higher than $1.95 (US).
Result:		YUP!  ASTOUNDING!!

Prediction:	The A4000/030 will have 5 zeroes in its name.
Result:		WOW!!  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!?

Prediction:	The A8000 won't be released in 1992.
Result:		OOPS!!  Violated my NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT!!  <blush>

Prediction:	Hillary Clinton will be discovered naked in a Carribean love
		nest with Dan Quayle, Rodney Dangerfield, Elmer Fudd, and
		three dozen trained attack-hamsters.
Result:		See today's newspaper, page 19!

Prediction:	Marc Barrett will post an "I was right!" article every
		time he guesses correctly, but he will never post an
		"I was wrong!" article.
Result:		Well HECK... I guess he's ALWAYS RIGHT, THEN!!

Prediction:	Marc Barrett will not seek therapy this year.
Result:		Isn't it OBVIOUS?

Prediction:	My KILL file for comp.sys.amiga.advocacy will reach 150
		lines by mid-year.
Result:		Looking truer all the time....

Prediction:	April Fools' Day will be "interesting" this year.
Result:		Wait and see!!

                                                        Dan
