  Welcome to the first Amiga Full Motion Video FAQ. This FAQ is fully
 consentrated on full motion video (from now on known as FMV) on Amiga 
 computers. As the FMV side on Amiga is still very small I will update this
 FAQ always when something new will pop out! All kinds of comments and 
 information for this FAQ is highly appreciated. See the 
 @{"Contacing the Author" link contact} part for more details.

 NOTE: At the moment this FAQ is mainly meant for full motion video games
       and demos. No other software will be included as I don't have time
       nor the interest to keep track on these.

 Larger Scale Introduction to the Subject:
 -----------------------------------------

 Full Motion Video games, movies and clips have been already a while in 
 use on the PC market and are finally (but slowly) moving to Amigas too.
 As everyone probably knows, Amiga is also very capable of doing FMV (and 
 many other things too ;)) very well. The only disadvantages on FMV specially 
 on Amiga computers has been the often very big size of the games as CD-Roms 
 aren't yet very popular and also a lousy playability (Well, it's a question 
 of taste). 

 What is full motion video then? Well, it's basicly pure video picture,
 animation and sound. One might have a picture already from the name 
 "Full Motion Video". The games that use FMV are usually full of animated
 video clips and speech (like Phantasmagoria and many others on PC). 
 Everything in the game is made by following the playing animation sequences
 and that is the reason why the players part usually isn't so great - the 
 games are more like interactive movies. 
 The FMV clips are very often taken from some films or TV programs or even 
 selfmade (if someone has the equipment!).
 
 Probably one of the reasons why FMV has become so popular is just that 
 it's more fun to watch and hear real picture and speech instead of some 
 hand-drawn looking cartoon animation stuff.  

 The reason for why I started writing this FAQ is that I think this kind of 
 a new technology, if I may call it so, needs to be supported to become more
 popular. I'm also a great fan of FMV games (well, fan of everything new on
 Amiga nowdays) and as I bought a CD-Rom, I realized that there were 
 actually NO cd-rom games only for Amiga (No CD32) and these FMV games 
 usually are on CD's due their big sizes.

 The next part @{"Full Motion Video on Amigas" link AmigaFMV} will tell more about FMV on
 Amiga and how is it made etc. 

 In case some FMV programmer is interested in explaining a bit more about 
 the coding of such games, I'm sure to include it in this FAQ.

 Full Motion Video on Amigas
 ---------------------------

 In this section we'll take a look at how can full motion video be done on 
 Amiga computers. I'm still ready to include details from  any coder who's 
 willing to tell me some. 

 @{"Kenneth Isley's way" link kifmv} - The way Murder is done!

 Kenneth Isley's (Murder) Way
 ----------------------------

 Probably, the most interesting thing is to see that Murder was made with 
 Amiga 500 equipped with a turbo. This means that the machines speed isn't 
 actually the MOST important thing when talking about full motion video.
 The speed of the drive where the game is installed to is much more affective
 The other hardware conserning the making of the digitizing were Vidi Amiga 
 24bit graphic digitizer, a homemade sampler for the sounds, a Samsung 4 head 
 VCR and a Panasonic CamCorder.  

 The software side of Murder was partly made with C language, DeckBrowser and
 with CanDo. The video is read into a film making program as individual Ham 
 images in a numbered sequence, and associated with a sound file.  
 This data is then writen out to one long file as a series of picture data, 
 interleaved with sound data for that frame.  The films in murder play at
 10 Frames/Sec, so each image has 1/10 of a second of sound data that
 plays while it's on the screen.

 This is the part where all the reviewed games and demos can be found.
 I think there's no need to explain the reviewing system - it's kind of a
 self explainary.

 Tomcat was the first FMV game appearing to Amiga. In TomCat you take the
 part of a pilot of F-14 fighter jet and fly different missions like P.O.W.
 rescues, escorts and air-to-air combats with enemy Migs. I still don't
 have the full version of it so I can only review the demo version. The full
 version promises lots of more (The demo is only about 6MB's and the full game
 12MB's). In the demo, there's only one waypoint with its missions which gives
 a good picture of the game. 

 About the system. The game is seems to be made with AMOS as it can be quitted
 by pressing CTRL-C. It runs smoothly without any bigger pauses depending on 
 the speed of a harddisk (Well, mine seems to be fast enough ;)). Optimizing 
 ones harddisk will help, if the game is too slow. TomCat plays in a 1/4 
 screen and the graphics are only black and white which makes it possible to 
 run on an ECS machine. Also voices and sounds are synchronized with the 
 animations. 

 For some reason, the demo crashes on my machine on every second target. Don't
 know for sure if the bug is also in the final version. The CD-version is said
 to be available soon. There's also a kind of a sequel to TomCat which is 
 called Desert Apache. It uses the new DVE (Digital Video Engine) system from 
 Dark Unicorn Productions. I'm not sure if it's already used in Tomcat so 
 better be quiet ;). More about the DVE system in @{"Desert Apache" link da}.

 Now this is some real FMV here ;). In Murder you take the role of a private
 detective whose case is to solve a murder (Have I seen this before?). 
 The game play happens so that you question the people, make phone calls and
 go from place to place. There's a time limit left to make the game more 
 difficult. I only have the unregistered version, so I couldn't play it very
 far. 

 The game itself takes 45mb and consists of lots of animation clips and 
 speech and sound. It would be very nice to have it on a CD, but so far it's
 not possible unless you do it your self (Zip Disks are available!). There's
 a CD version coming out on March on some German Amiga magazine. 
 Murder rolls on HAM mode (4096 colors). Despite the fact that the docs say 
 Murder plays on 1/4 screen, the version I have is in NTSC full screen which 
 looks pretty strange (any reason for that??). The frame rate is 10 fps which 
 makes it run smoothly depending of harddrives speed. The lowest transfer 
 rate for Murder is around 140k/sec but that shouldn't be any problem nowdays.

 Due to the interest of the Amiga community Murder will be ported to Macintosh
 and if no interest is found after the CD release of Murder, the whole
 project will be dropped from Amiga ;((.. So, all you people with CD-Roms and
 big hard disks; order it now! :)

@toc reviews

 =========================================================================
 Name................ Rocko
 Archive on Aminet... rocko.lha (game/misc)
 Author.............. Daniel Clinton (DM9200@appstate.edu)
 Requirements........ Any Amiga with 1MB Chip
 Type................ PD 
 Score............... **
 =========================================================================
 

 Rocko isn't actually a "real FMV game". First of all, it's made with AMOS,
 which as a matter of fact doesn't mean a thing ;). The source code is 
 included in the archive so that anyone can use or edit it.

 The game is made is made only by viewing digitized screens quickly after
 each other and that fakes the animation from being full motion. It's only
 quickly displayed ham6 frames. It doesn't actually even look like FMV but
 I think I will still include it here as it's near it :). The game rolls 
 pretty smoothly although the small amout of frams makes it look a bit  
 sticky.  

 Rocko itself is a boxing game where you tried to beat the opponent by 
 hitting him untill he loses his energy (OOH!). Fighting is made via key-
 board and there are some guide arrows in the screen. Despite that, I think 
 the game's pretty hard and messy (might be my skills). It still goes for a
 "poor-mans-fmv-game" ;)

 About the future of Rocko. Daniel said he hadn't planned anything yet for
 sure but there might be some small improvements around like better pictures
 and digitizations, more frames and even real life boxers.

 =========================================================================
 Name................ Karate Babe
 Archive on Aminet... sknight.lha (game/demo)
 Author.............. Travis Riggs (travis@axsamer.org)
 Requirements........ An anim player ;)
 Type................ The anim is PD and the full game will be commercial
 Score............... - (looks promising)
 =========================================================================


 The demo of Karate Babe is only a short animation which can be viewed by 
 any up-to-date animation viewer. It won't actually give any kind of picture
 of the full game. 

 This is what the info file says about it:

 ---

       The animation sknight.anim was produced by Travis Riggs, the author of
 Composite Studio Pro, a Video Toaster utility.  It requires a 68000 and 1
 meg of RAM to play, and although a faster CPU and more RAM are reccomended,
 they are by no means neccesary.

      This demo is but a shade of what the complete game, Karate Babes, will
 be.  The full game will have full-screen Full Motion Video, will be in
 color, with both AGA and non-AGA versions, will have a kicking soundtrack,
 and will have some of the best gameplay that you've ever seen in a fighting
 game.  Look for the game Karate Babes coming your way soon!
 
 ---

  For me, it seemed like the project would have bemmen dead for a long time now
 untill I emailed Travis and asked if anything is going to happen to this 
 demo. For my surprise he told me that the project is still running well. 
 The game will be out only on a CD-Rom and is planned also for multiple 
 platforms, such as Sony Playstation. The planned release date is sometimes 
 next summer. He also told that the characters of the game will be the world 
 & national champions in martial arts!! ;) The animations should be nothing 
 compared to the final game. So, let's be on a look out for this one.
