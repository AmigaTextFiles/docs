Location:
  body of water between Africa, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica
Map references:
  Southeast Asia, Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
 total area:
  73.6 million km2
 comparative area:
  slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
  (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Arctic
  Ocean)
 note:
  includes Arabian Sea, Bass Straight, Bay of Bengal, Java Sea, Persian Gulf,
  Red Sea, Straight of Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Coastline:
  66,526 km
International disputes:
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
  northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October);
  tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the north
  Indian Ocean and January/February in the south Indian Ocean
Terrain:
  surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of
  currents) in the south Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents in
  the north Indian Ocean, low atmospheric pressure over southwest Asia from
  hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest monsoon and
  southwest-to-northeast winds and currents, while high pressure over northern
  Asia from cold, falling, winter air results in the northeast monsoon and
  northeast-to-southwest winds and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the
  Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge,
  Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninety East Ridge; maximum depth is 7,258
  meters in the Java Trench
Natural resources:
  oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
  deposits, polymetallic nodules
Environment:
  endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales;
  oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea
Note:
  major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
  Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait; ships
  subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica from May to
  October

Overview:
  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
  Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a
  particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil
  fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing
  importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export.
  Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
  Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being
  tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western
  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes
  from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore
  placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly
  India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
  based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
  minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
  placer deposits
