Overview:
  The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been
  the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for
  85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
  industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third
  of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
  extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
  Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
  population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
  suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
  African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991
  illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
  well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
  France.
