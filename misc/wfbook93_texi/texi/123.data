Overview:
  The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
  tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
  important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
  cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
  products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
  overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the
  island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
  industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
  has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
  material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
  Jersey's food needs.
