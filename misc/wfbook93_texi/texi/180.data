Overview:
  The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US.
  The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues
  have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to
  $228 million for capital development, government operations, and special
  programs. A rapidly growing major source of income is the tourist industry,
  which now employs about 50% of the work force. Japanese tourists
  predominate. The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small
  farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Industry is
  small scale, mostly handicrafts and light manufacturing.
