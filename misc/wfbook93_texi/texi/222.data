Overview:
  Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing; proximity to nearby oil-
  and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential for oil and gas
  deposits, but the region is largely unexplored, and there are no reliable
  estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to be
  developed.
Industries:
  none
