Location:
  body of water between the Western Hemisphere and Europe/Africa
Map references:   Africa, Antarctic Region, Arctic Region, Central America and the Caribbean,
  Europe, North America, South America, Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
 total area:
  82.217 million km2
 comparative area:
  slightly less than nine times the size of the US; second-largest of the
  world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than Indian Ocean
  or Arctic Ocean)
 note:
  includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait,
  Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea,
  Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Coastline:
  111,866 km
International disputes:
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
  tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near Cape
  Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can occur from
  May to December, but are most frequent from August to November
Terrain:
  surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and
  Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad, circular
  system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise warm water gyre
  in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic
  Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin;
  maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench
Natural resources:
  oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and gravel
  aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, precious stones
Environment:
  endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles,
  and whales; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil, and
  eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake
  Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and municipal
  sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea; icebergs
  common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern Atlantic from
  February to August and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda and the
  Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in the extreme southern
  Atlantic
Note:
  ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic from October
  to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October; persistent fog can be
  a hazard to shipping from May to September; major choke points include the
  Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals;
  strategic straits include the Dover Strait, Straits of Florida, Mona
  Passage, The Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; north Atlantic shipping
  lanes subject to icebergs from February to August; the Equator divides the
  Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean
