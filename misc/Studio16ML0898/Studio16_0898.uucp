What would the chances be of someone or a group taking on the rights for the hardware and software development? How dificult would this be? I do believe the interest is still there for this wonderfuld product.

In regards to AHI

How about "Bribes" to the people with the API knowledge to break their agreements and everyone chips in the money for any pending lawsuit??

Sincerely,

Nearly impossible. There was a discussion earlier on this ML on this. We
have a small indication on who owns the stuff, but we're not 100% sure. Ben
knows, but he said he would be "killed" if he told us. To me it tells me
that the owner isn't very willing to hand over the stuff to anyone no matter
what.

>I do believe the interest is still there for this wonderfuld product.

Agreed, but the others are catching up on us.

You could always try, but I doubt it will work :)

API means Application Programming Interface.  It's a spec on how one piece
of software talks to another.

AHI originally meant Audio Hardware Interface, although the author has
since disowned that meaning and prefers that you treat it as a word.  It's
a retargetable audio system that supports different add-on audio cards as
well as the native audio, in a similar manner to the way CyberGraphX and
Picasso96 support a variety of display cards.  The general concept is
sometimes labeled RTA for ReTargetable Audio, just as RTG is used to refer
to things like CGX and P96.  There's at least one other RTA system - ARTAS
from A.C.T.

Hi Greg,

API is short for Applications Program Interface
AHI is short for Audio Hardware Interface

API is for developers. It tells the programmer how he can interact with a
system or software. Studio 16's API is only defined for the library
meaning you can only interact with it though here. As the other modules
don't have defined APIs you can't interact with those.

AHI is a system that provides an API so the developer doesn't need to think
of what audio card a computer has. You just put in a driver for your audio
card and the program written for AHI will work with the card. To create a
driver for an audio card you will need to know its API.

I was wondering the same thing. It has been very quite in 
all mailing list lately. I am recording some demo projects
with studio16/B&P so though I'm quiet here, I am making 
lots of noise with my amiga.

Iam another that was wondering I thought I got kicked off the list for not
talking or something. Hey I was
just wondering if it wouldnt be any trouble to tell me how you have your
studio16 hooked up. you know what
mixing board you use to record mics cables the mix down and is it for full
bands? Iam primarly a bass player
but play drums to in a band and we want to make a demo. I have two make 1202
one is a 1202 VlZ which is much nicer
than the older one. The mics I have are Shure beta58s 5 of those shure57,some
shure dynamic mics and two AKG mics
a bass drum one the cool one and another that is pretty exspensive. I use the
58s for recording everything but
have yet to get a really good recording. i know the room acoustics has a lot
to do with it but figured you
might know a little more about it after reading your post. also do you get any
noise from other boards in your
computer I have an IO card Pic2 Opalcard and will have a Vlab capture card.

Thanks

Anyone ever try and put two Studio16's in a machine for 16 channels?

 I tried it once, but had no luck. I even think we set the jumpers properly...

i've got two in my a2k.  they should just plug right in.  you need two
ad516 handlers in the handlers drawer.

Greg Ham of "Men at Work" uses this kind of a setup, but I understand
that you have to make a modification or have a certain rev board
for it to work. Some one else on the list probably knows more about it.

I've done it with my 2 AD516s. It worked in both an A2500 25mhz 030 and
an A3000 w/25mhz 040. The software can support more cards as well (up to
4, I think). No hardware modifications or jumper changes were needed.
The trick is to have an AD516handler for each card. They then show up as
AD516-1 and AD516-2 in Studio16. On the A3000 I managed to get 12 tracks
to play at once and I believe that's the limit. I saw someone else on this
list say that theirs topped out at that same number of tracks. I think
this is more a limit of data I/O (SCSI, CPU, etc.) than a limitation of
the cards/software. I bought a second card mainly for 4 tracks of
simultaneous recording (which worke great!). More separate audio I/O
would be the only reason to exceed 2 cards since the multitracking tops
out at 12 tracks.

I use two boards in my system. It works very easily......

First of all, you don't have to change any jumpers... those jumpers on the
boards were for diagnostics(AFAIK).

Secondly, you don't actually get 16 channels, you get 12.... after the
second board, you get 4 additional channels for each board you install up
to 4. So, if you had 4 boards installed, you would get 20 channels. But of
course your HD throughput would have to be able to handle this.

Thirdly, you have to have an additional copy of the AD516 handler for each
additional board. All you have to do is copy it with a new name.... that is
sufficient.

Now when you load Studio16, it sees two AD516 drivers installed, so it
looks for two boards.... that easy!

I thought the Zorro bus can only handle 12 channels max? This would be cool if
it is true I would buy two extra boards
if I could find them cheap of coarse. then I would have 16 channels,that would
be nice.

That was certainly a quick response....  Thanks to all who replied to the
 2 boards in one machine question. I'll have to go try it out. 

  Does anyone out there have a SoundStage board (Digital Micronics/Applied
Magic)?

I've been busy teaching on a Summer College, and working on an

My AD516 only has one jumper on it, which selects the interrupt priority
level.  I don't know whether it can be changed without confusing the
software.

Really? For what reason?

Seems unlikely unless something really crappy is going on.  But it dends
on a number of things.  The best-case scenario would be a fast accelerator
with local RAM and SCSI (e.g. CSPPC).  Here all the CPU RAM accesses and
all the SCSI transfers are purely within the card, and only the actual
data output needs to go over the Zorro bus.  If the card is Z2-only (I
think it is) then the absolute maximum data rate would be 3.58Mb/s,
although I'm not sure how close you can come to that in practice.  Each
channel at CD audio rate needs 88.2Kb/s, so you might be able to get up to
around 32 channels or so.

Some of the advertised limits may predate modern accelerators.

If decompression could be done on the DSP the Zorro bus would be less of a
limitation.  This may not be possible on the current card, though.

Mine has one as well.... but there is no need to change it! Even with
multiple cards.

I believe it's a limitation of hardware interaction between the boards....
you get 8 on the first board and 4 on every board after it! I really don't
know why!

Still here. It's been an extremely busy summer. 

Used the AD516 last weekend to create a solo piano CD for 
a friend. He recorded it elsewhere, and we transferred it to 
the Amiga. Trimmed the start and end of each movement in 
Studio 16. We burned the CD with Master ISO.

Hello everyone!

Not much summer to enjoy anyway (no sun and lots of work..) - I'm back behind
the keys, but not for long. I have got a new job as a pro photographer and am
loaded with work, and it will get worse later this autum and by christmas
time. In addition we're gonna install a brand new digital lab during the next
half year so that means I have not much time left to program anything for
the Amiga.

My list of projects will be however:

 - AHI (if "possible") for Studio 16
 - A new mixer module for Studio 16
 - A new modular sample editor with direct interface to Studio 16.


regards,
- Kenny

Wow! It seems amazing to me that you will have time to even think
about it. I'm sure most members on this list tremble with excitement
( or at least smile in anticipation ;) at the thought of these projects
actually happening! Your efforts make life with Studio16 better for
us all.

Thank you, thank you (and thank you)!

I treid as hard as any one I have met to do the same thing.
I did manage to contact Ben Fuller and he lent some help
and expertise to ken and this group, but made it pretty clear
that the holders of this technology had no intention or desire
to release or license it to any one else at this time. I beleive
Ben still monitors the list. He may answer your question with
more authority than I. But unless some thing out there in california
has changed the heatrs and minds of those with the technology
since the last time we spoke, I think you will get a very similar
answer....
"No." You can forward mail and address to the other list if you like.
I can also tell them what microsoft said about releasing bars and pipes.

Wow, did I miss something, was kidnapped by aliens or something?  This
isn't at all my impression of Kenny's stand on this.  I'm sure he'll reply
to this, but I remember him offering to whoever wanted it!

Thanks for the info. Hopefully the Studio 16 copyright holders are
keeping their options open for a future return to developing on the
Amiga. What I really wanted to do was port the program over to the PC
which I am sure that some Amiga aficionados have expressed interest in
already. Licensing the rights to use the technology can be used in many
ways and depends on many factors that need to be negotiated depending on
the goals of the owners. I am sure that if MicroSoft came around looking
for the the rights that those Sunrise guys would pop up in a second. In
that regard there has got to be a deal able to be made for the right
price.
Can Ben Fuller provide a contact to the owners so that we can talk?

Ciao,
dupont

Not true. I also have the information. I'm just not any where near the
progammer kenny is to do any thing about. And the information 
given by Ben was absolutly bare. All the necessary additional 
information it takes to produce some thing useful with the
awesome 3 pages offered by Ben, is kenny's skill and knowledge
of programming amiga and studio16 added to the 1.0 dev docs.
Sounds as if you're not a happy camper. I can mail you or any one else
the same 3 pages from Ben. I promise it would do you little to no good.
3 pages of nothing but the C function proto types for the handler lib.
Nothing
else. No code to go with the protos, no docs, no notes. If you're a
exsperienced
C programmer it will be usefull. I understand the information, but cannot
program well 
enough to matter. I hate the fact that he has no time to program.
And hate more the problem that I am such an enept programmer at the
moment. I hope to change that soon as I continue to program ( and screw
up )
my amiga. I don't know if I can get there fast enough to make any
difference
to AHI though. If some one else who is a programmer, interested and
willing
to take this on, I would gladly send them all the same info.
And if there were such big bucks involved in writting this, I would think
kenny
would be busy doing it instead of photography. I once estimated about
$3500US might be made. This based on a survey I did long before kenny's,
and his info added to that. That divided by a huge amount of time,
is not much per hour. ( 90 days * 2-4 hours a day maybe )
If I were a good enough programmer to pull it off, I would do it for
free.
But I don't fault kenny for wanting to make some thing for his effort. So
far all the other utils he has done have been shareware.
The other thing is that there was no information offered by ben on the
hardware at all. I can't say, but I got the impression that the ex-prez
of sunrize was sitting on this info and was never going to give it up.
Ah well, I have rambled enough. I honestly have lost most of my
fire for the revival of S16 and Bars and Pipes. I think by the time we
have more for the S16 cards, we will be buying a new amigaOS5 and
some newer, more awesome pci based sound card. Pity.

Really interested to see how AHI would work with Studio16.  Nicer
still to work with the AD516.  Oh well.  Starting to think we will not
see this.

Why not release this information publicly on the Aminet or something,
so anyone who cares could have a go?

I would be very surprised if it was as much as that now. AHI for AD516
would be a public service much appreciated by a small group of users,
not a source of income.
The best bet if Kenny is really too busy would be to spread this info
around and hope it gets picked up by a good programmer.

I am inclined to think the time has come to start on a new program
with the same modular approach as B&P but written for OS5, and
probably in Java. There are of course some very good programs out
there already (Cubase etc), but B&P has a special attitude and meshes
well with video and multimedia. 
Audio in Java seems to be fairly embryonic at the moment but it is
being worked on. Structures such as linked lists (which B&P uses
throughout) are well supported.
In the same way as OS5 is planned as a new OS with the traditional
Amiga spirit, we need a new music program with the spirit of B&P.

A core program which makes use of plug in modules gives various
authors a chance to make a bit of money writing plugins, as happens
with Photoshop or Lightwave. From what I have seen of Java it seems
well suited to this modular approach. Its main disadvantage is that it
is still under construction.
An obvious advantage is that porting to several OSs is fairly easy
(the claim that Java applications just work on any OS is probably
exaggerated).

What do people think?

I have no problem with that in support of all things amiga.
I would like to support kenny and his efforts in every way.
But if he is unable to do his work because of his other
obligations, then there is no reason others could not explore
this. I had no Ideal the small tempest I may have unleashed
with my response to these recent messages. My private mail
has lit up with some interesting plots I was not aware of.
I have no reason or desire to hurt kenny's efforts. He has my
support. But if it is obvious that he will not be able to complete
his projects, then someone else should have the opportunity.
I'm holding up while waiting to hear from kenny about this.
I want to do the best I can for amiga, S16, kenny and everyone
else. All of a sudden, that may be in slight conflict. I hope not.

More soon.

Perhaps it would be more appropriate to put it on the Young Monkey

After the posts I have decided to release the info I have to Aminet. I'm not
sure exactly when, but in near future. The info is limited, but it's
possible to figure it out by spending some time with it..

I _was_ hoping to gain a small compensation for the effort. Troy mentioned
some numbers and is what I have figured out too, a USD 3300,- _optimally_
for an AHI driver, /if/ Martin accept a "commercial" driver for his freeware
system (he must add a MODE-ID number for his system) !

Now, my last year of purly idealistical effort to study the Studio 16 env.
has prevented me to earn my usual income. The loss is many times bigger than
the number above. In fact, I have payed to carry on with this. I didn't have
to start the study, I didn't have to start this mailinglist, I didn't have
to create any tools for Studio - I didn't have to bother at all. I don't
blame anyone, but Sunrize stopped their business three years ago and you
shouldn't really expect something at all. I know I didn't.

I have gotten many motivating posts, but I have also gotten critical posts,
childish posts and manipulating posts. Some seem to think of me as a large
company with a hotline for angry customers. I am a PRIVATE person and doing
this of before mentioned, idealistical reasons.

Oh btw, my shareware stuff: I have sold two copies of QMaster and two copies
of SmpteCTRL. My programs probably sucks, but I don't want to put more
effort to program anything else (FYI: there exists freeware stuff too..), I
neither have the time to finish the projects.

Are you happy now trenn ?

Kenny, and all,

I could see this coming. Someone gets frustrated because they can't get
something when they want it, or feel they need it. They speak up, but
use a negative tone to express their frustration. Sometimes it's accusations,
sometimes it's nasty comments or names. It's the end result that's always
the same. They cause a process to collapse, often not getting what they
sought, and even more often, ending up with less than they had to begin
with.

Kenny may put the docs on Aminet, but his implied withdrawal from the process
that is this list, his programming efforts, his pursuit of the necessary
knowledge, his negotiations with Ben Fuller, is a loss much greater than
the gain. He has put much unselfish effort into all of this. He has asked for
very little. The least he deserves is some courtesy concerning his changing
personal life. I'm as anxious as the next person to see AHI happen, but
cannot do it myself (no matter how good the docs are). I reluctantly have
to be patient and wait, but cannot fault someone because of changing
circumstances. I can only say "Thank you for your continued efforts, please
continue to do what you can". It's not only the "right thing to say", it's
what I honestly feel.

>Are you happy now trenn ?

I certainly am not. Please reconsider Kenny. If anything, please see this
as a challenge instead of a criticism. I'm sure most readers of this list
could use AHI immediately. I'll gladly pay upfront but I know this won't
buy you more actual time to do it (which looks to be your scarcest resource).

Here's hoping this thread takes an upward turn from here...

Well, I wasn't going to say anything, since -- as I've mentioned
previously, I sold my AD516. But I am sad to see angry little boy
attitudes in some quarters -trenn- (but I've sniffed that action
before, and it left a bad smell for awhile).

I am also sorry to hear that your shareware experiences were not more
renumerative, Kenny. Actually I'm quite shocked that people were not
more forthcoming, but I suppose it was the typical Amiga wait-and-see.
I wish you well in your future endeavors, Kenny.

Troy, good luck in your quests. Seems that it must be frustrating to
know what must be done, and be able to do nothing -- for all of us for
that matter. But it has been a educational goad for you I suppose. We
can both look forward to future glories I'm sure.

If I were to find fault anywhere it would be with the obstructionists
responsible for what I believe are vindictive actions in not releasing
their stranglehold on Sunrize code and docs, as this intellectual
property is probably not worth a fig on another platform. The name
Sunrize is probably forgotten except on the Amiga as well. Just bundles
of opportunistic goodwill, one thinks at times. But it is not ours to
say...

Don Cox, no more polling. Go forth and multiply! (and ADD, DIVIDE,
MOVETO, etc.) OF COURSE we need a cool Amiga sequencer, especially on
the 5.x OS. It's a given.

Maybe this list can permutate to a more general topic, perhaps moving
out of Kenny's hair. I'll continue to lurk. It has been a pleasure to
share space, and duel with everyone here, and try to light a few fires.
Hope to see all that individualism and energy move on to the 5.x
Mitchie machine, where I plan to be in nn months.

No we are not happy. I don't know the mail you receive and
all the good and bad it contains. I can only imagine. I have stated
before and still support kenny. He is the only one of two (young monkeys)
who has added ANY thing valuable to S16 since sunrizeand I for one
appreciate it. Untill this latest round of mail, I had no ideal of the
under
currents that have been going on here. And I unintentionally just made it
worse,
though it seemed that it was coming on it's own anyway.
He mentioned also his invisible shareware sales. I for one had not
bought one. On my schedule, I only got to DL them and have never
even had the chance to use them. But I suspect that with the current
state of amiga markets, that an AHI driver would only do slightly better.
If kenny or anyone else takes this on it will almost have to be for free,
and probably done in secret as far as I can tell from some of the 
responses I have seen. Just to avoid the B.S. mail. 
Kenny I can't blame you for wanting to toss it in, but I hope you
can find a way to stay. Releasing the dev info to aminet will not help
if no one understands it, can't program and doesn't care anyway. If some
out
there was interested, I think we may have already  heard back from some
one
given the usenet and many amiga news postings on amiga.org and AWD.
If kenny's calling it quits, will the last one out of the list please
turn out
the lights? And maybe we will see you all again on OS5.

No one knows really. I will explain the strategic of the AHI driver I was
planning so anyone interrested can have a go when I release the info.

To allow AHI and Studio 16 to interchange there must be a interface to
"convert" between the two as they use different methods of getting data
(for the API of it atleast). Studio 16 uses disk buffering (memory buffering
internal, but as we don't have access to this we're stuck with disk
buffering). AHI uses memory buffering. After looking at several options I
found the best way, together with Martin (author of AHI), to do this
interfacing is to create a dos handler (the one put in the L: drawer).

The handler would look like this:

  Studio 16 disk read/write <-->  HANDLER  <--> AHI memory read/write
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                   \|/

   Dynamical allocated buffer set by global prefs controlled by user with
   counters. Resource handling.

To achieve double buffering a counter must trace the memory copying from
every single read or write. The trigger points will occure every buffer/2.
When counter=buffer/2 or counter=buffer a message is sent to AHI to change
buffers. This way you will have complete control on where Studio 16 is in
writing or reading the files and you will get true double buffering. A small
overhead is also present and will probably reduce number of channels in work
simultainously on a semi system. There should be no problem whatsoever to
use stereo (two channels) in and out though.

Problems to work around:

        - Studio 16 uses two files for stereo. How to allocate and trigger
          them in sync from within the handler.
        - How to alloc resources for Studio 16 fast enough for programs
          using AHI. You might expect instant play, but you won't get that
          with an AHI driver for Studio 16. That's just how it is..
        - How to communicate with the handler to share datas for buffers and
          other resources. How to track the resources.
        - How to stop playing/recording fast enough for AHI.
        - Studio 16 deallocates some resources after stopping (a small bug
          when multi-triggering samples). How can the resources be re-used
          when AHI for example request a freeing of the already freed
          resources..
        - Rule of the tumb - there will always be more problems during
          development...

You also need to write a complete new dos-handler.

Of course, a few limitations such as only allow two channels beeing
allocated etc. would make it a bit easier. Preallocated channels that got
inited with the new file(s) is one solution, but here bugs strikes.

Every problem here within could be avoided if the knowledge about how to
directly interface the DSP in co-operation with Studio 16 were available.
Ok, I have a hardware map Ben was so kind to give me on the DSP addresses
etc. (I was told that there doesn't exist any other info), but the
information is to short and partly cryptic and I have no experience with
DSP programming so I'm unable to dechiffer it completly. Hopefully,
someone else is able to.

You also have to understand that the Studio 16 environment is full of small
bugs. They aren't usually noticed when used with the specialized program
Studio 16 and modules, but you notice them well when using the environment
from external programs. This will also include an AHI driver. A particular
bug will make things frustrating. Studio 16 allow you to select auto_close
for file and auto_dealloc for channel when allocating a channel. However,
when /not/ choosing any of these options Studio 16 still deallocates. This
is sometimes noticed using the arexx interface. I also had some headace to
work around this with the NewPlay program.

An AHI driver written for the Studio 16 API will work with both AD516 and
AD1012; just to clear that up btw.

Personally I would rather create a complete new and good sample editor and
include direct interface to Studio 16 with own drivers capable of memory-
and diskbuffering. This would allow future/other cards to use the sample
editor as well. Effects and functions would be added with plugins etc. I
would add envelope editor for filters and every other effects (in fact I
have already created lo/mid/high/notch pass filters with variable cutoff
freq. and a phase/flanger with variable delay - all in realtime controlled
by moving the mouse up and down, but no friendly interface). I really want
to create something like this all-in-one thingy, plugin based, but I'm
behind - way behind. I program 68k asm and I don't know PPC asm or C well
enough to work structured and continously.

I would sure appreciate Kenny posting the developer docs and Studio 16
3.0 code on Aminet . I think you have to give much respect to Kenny for
what he has done for the Studio16 system so far.
I would like to know why is it that Kenny is the only one who understands
the Studio 16 material? Are there other programmers out there that can do
it? If so who are they?
Thank you for your reply.

Ciao,
dupont

Hello.

I am a studio16 owner and user. I have been reading this list for about 6
months (I think) . I have always enjoyed the inofrmation and felt lucky that
there was still people working to better this great product.  I have never
written because I haven't had a good question yet.  But with all the bad
comments passing by in the last couple days I felt it time to speak up. 

It's true that the negative voice is usually the most often heard, and the
postitive one is missed.

How to help?

I was honestly suprised that the new Utilities written by our host have not
sold to many (appranently only 2 copies or something like that.)  I have
downloaded them, but also have not tried them.  I'm sure there great.  And
what's more they symbolize continued support.

I would bet there are a lot of people like me who read this list but don't
speak up.  I would like to pose a affirmitive action (If it would help). 
for everyone who would like to see continued support of these utilities and
possibly more to register and buy them all now.  If we could all write in
our commitments, and then send a check, I bet our positive actions would
speak louder then some negative words.

So I'll start it.  I don't even know who many util's you've written for the
A516 or how much they are.  AND NO I'M NOT RICH, but you all I both know we
can come up with a bit when we need it.

I hope this helps set the future in a better direction.  I hearby pledge to
buy a copy of all the util's Kenny has written thus far.  Please send me
mailing information and I'll send it today.

If you are like me, please step forward now and put a little money where our
thoughts are, and lets make this go in a positive direction instead of a
negative one.

Sincerely,

Daniel W. Schallock

There is a world wide shortage of good professional
programmers. In the US, with 2 years of average exsperience
you can start at a salary of $60-65k/year US funds. And a good amiga
programmer that is not already programming windows
programs for about $100US and hour, is about as rare as
a white tiger. Now find a white tiger that has spent his time
studying only studio16. On planet earth you find only one so far.
Named Kenny. The only others who could do it are the original
S16 programmers, but they are now working for mac and windows
projects making too much to think about coming back to amiga.
Except for a brief and suprising visit by ben fuller, none other will
talk
to us. I am the only other person I know who is trying to program amiga
AND is interested in S16 and B&P. If kenny is a college level 
programmer, then that would put me at about 5th grade. I'm just
not good enough yet to do it. I've spent the last 8 months learning
C and amiga, and I predict another year of work to be productive
on any kind of a professional level. Too little to late maybe, but it
will put me in demand for amigaOS5 projects I hope.

That should about cover the question I hope :)

Most excellently spoken. Count me in. Kenny mail me directly or
post your information on the list once more and I will pay the 
registration for Qmaster and I'll even pay the same price for
Newplay. I don't even think you ask for a registration on Newplay,
but I'm paying it any way. At this point I have not gotten to use
either, and even if I never do, I think you deserve the support.
An amiga project may wither and die, but it won't be said that
I didn't do as much as I could to help. Send the info once more please.
And how does someone in norway get paid from the USA any way?

troy

I would say, keep them on the market, because it can be a long time
between when one says "I could use that" and actually sending the
money off. Certainly I usually have a long list of software and
shareware to work through.

I did sell a few dozen copies of my Pro Page Arexx scripts, but that
was back in the days when Amigas were popular, and the price was very
low. The hourly rate would be tiny. The reason for writing Amiga
software cannot be to make money: I think it is to help your friends.

Of course there are idiots around who have no idea of the economics
and think programmers are all big corporations.

SMPTEcontrol is good. Thanks.

Hey we just finished a 17.5 minute master mix on the AD512 with Horita
SMPTE. After setting the record level of the SMPTE to -8db all worked
very well. Then sent it over to the MAC G3 and married it up with the
Picture in Radius EDIT DV. All worked as advertised.

Kenny,
Sounds great the pro-photographer thingy. AS one who has shot 7UP ads
etc for 25 years, then graduating to films, I can only wish you well.
All your programming skills will come in mighty handy.

Yes, and yes. I'm concentrating on learning Java. I can use it at
work, and hopefully for the Amiga. A lot of progress needs to be made
in the audio area, but in a platform independant way.

I hope I'm right in saying that the momentum for Java is increasing.
The 'classic' AND any new Amigas have to take advantage of this. I
certainly wish the Merapi (and other) Java efforts would move quicker.
We need to be able to do serious Java programming NOW.

I don't think it's exaggerated. Having written my first serious Java
program just recently, and doing lots of reading, platform/OS
independance is a reality.  It really is built into the
language. 
Keeping it that way with M$ trying to infect the language
with Windows specific 'features' is another matter. If few Java
programs come out for non-Windows platforms, there will be little
'weight' behind the effort to keep Java independant.

If Kenny says he can do more with S16 and AHI that is usefull, 
then I'll do what I can to support him as I would any amiga project.
I have already bought software I barely need or use, just to support
good amiga efforts for the future.
I tried to move my recording work to PC and it was a joke. 
B&P and S16 does the job so much more reliably. I don't want to,
and don't intend to leave them for a long time.
AHI would still be very useful for two things on classic amiga.
1.) It would allow me to edit my samples using a more powerfull
     sample editors that supports AHI. I already have a big need for
this.
2.) You could still use it as playback for the latest games supporting
AHI.
I would pay, no problem, to add these features to my 516.
So what's the verdict? Can we get this done, or is it time to go?

I found the address in the qmaster.guide in my help dir on my ami.
It tells where to send it, but little on how. These international
exchanges are a  pain. When I figure out the best way, I'll
let those who are interested know.

I can envisage software that works on any platform but demonstrably works
best on an MMC Amiga - or even an Amiga with a G3 PPC processor and the AA+
chipset.

It is very sad to hear that Kenny only sold 2 copies of both SMTEControl and Qmaster.
I bought them both and i like them both.
I would have bought them even when i would not have any purpose for these programs just
to support Kenny, the Ad516/Studio16 and the Amiga.

All those people on this list who said they buy these programs are i think
the same people who has send those critical,childish and manipulating post to
Kenny.
I think they suck and not Kenny.

If you all want to keep The Amiga Alive and this harware (Ad516) we all use you
all must support kenny and his software.
If you do not like his software or parts of it you should have mentioned this on
this list, so Kenny could make some improvement to the software.
Togheter we can make this software better.
That's how it works in the real world.

I think we must continue this list and all together start thinking how to
make our Studio16/Ad516 combo better and more suitable for the future.
And also talk and do something about the Amiga (Audio/music.Midi/MultiMedia) future.

So first all buy SMPTECTRL and Qmaster so Kenny will be motivated to make the
all be wished AHI driver for studio16.

Horita is the US maker of external SMPTE box that reads and generates
SMPTE code.
We transfered the MAster Mix via ethernet as an AIFF (MM recorded as
AIFF in S16) file which the MAC likes. Radius EditDV vs 1.5 works great.
They have a big update due this fall which adds batch capture and ????

Oh no, another victim of Javamania. :-) Java makes sense for things where
transparent cross-platform use is important, such as browser plugins, but
it's performance won't match decent C code compiled for the target system.
Unless you anticipate the number of different CPUs being used on new
Amigas being so large that multiple compilations is impractical, Java
would just be a CPU sink.

An *interface* to Java to permit modules in Java for people who really
want to do it that way would be OK, but I wouldn't actually write the
core program in Java.

Exactly. How else would you write a program that could work on old Amigas,
PPC Amigas, MMC Amigas (if they appear), Macs, etc?
There is so much uncertainty as to what platform a program might be used on
that code needs to be very portable, unless you write for Windows only,
which I am not interested in doing.

It would be madness to write a program for Amigas at this point: you could
work for 2 or 3 years and sell two hundred copies. This would only be
practical if you charge workstation prices of a couple of thousand dollars
per copy, with expensive dongles.

Allan Havemose assured me that Java code would run at 90% of the speed of
c++ code. I think on fast PPCs or on the MMC this should be fast enough. 
Although nobody at AmigaInc has suggested this, I think it's quite likely
that the MMC can offer some hardware support for Java.

Another reason, not unimportant, is that Java looks like a language I would
enjoy using. Obviously tastes differ.

Just thought everyone would like to know that the latest release of
SoundFX supports both LOADING and SAVING of Studio16 format
sounds.  So, you now have access to THE BEST sample editor on the
Amiga.  Tons of effects and other great features for a very low
registration fee.  Grab this new version from Stefan's website:

http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/~kost/SoundFX.html


Of course you can't audition sounds in SoundFX on the AD516 cards
YET; but, you can use the Amiga's internal audio which is just fine for
auditioning while working in SoundFX.
