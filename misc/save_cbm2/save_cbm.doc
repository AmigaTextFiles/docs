    0001    What is the Amiga?

        The Commodore Amiga, or shall I say, the Amiga by Commodore,
    is seen worldwide as the leading system for graphics, sound, and
    productivity, as well as cost effectiveness. The Amiga is marketed
    heavily as the ultimate multimedia computer, and is well ahead in
    both the multimedia market as well as home and professional video
    markets. For sound, nothing beats Soundtracker modules. And for
    animation, Deluxe Paint IV rivals many other paint packages. Of
    course, this also includes 3D animation packages such as Imagine,
    Lightwave, and Caligari, all of whom have lifted eyebrows across
    the industry. Imagine is a big hit for the average 3D user, soon to
    release version 3.0 for the Amiga and the IBM PC. Lightwave has
    received acknowledgement as the best rendering software, with NewTek's
    slick packaging as well as user friendliness. And Caligari makes the
    grade with the best designed interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    0002    How does CBM stack up compared to CBM?

        Okay, we all know what the Amiga is and how great it is. Or do we?
    In Germany, the Amiga is the computer of choice. It is even considered
    a business computer by many Germans. Remember Commodore BUSINESS
    Machines - CBM? In England (UK), the Amiga is also a hit, with
    excellent sales figures for the A500 and now a stronghold for the CDTV
    with the new CDTV PowerUp program. In Australia (Oz?), once again the
    Amiga is a big winner. Numerous high end packages are from Australia,
    such as OpalVision (ColorBurst) and Directory Opus. And Canada has
    large sales of Amigas also...even more in some respects than in the
    United States from figures I have seen posted on USENET. Isn't it odd
    that the US has a poor image of the Amiga while the rest of the world
    enjoys it so much?

        There were once rumors that CBM would move headquarters from
    North America to Europe. Many Amiga models are designed in the United
    States, and I would assume that they are done in West Chester,
    Pennsylvania. I have heard that the new Amiga 600 may have been
    designed in Europe, but am not sure. But it is clear that the Amiga 600
    does not yet exist in the US due to the stock of Amiga 500's. Why would
    CBM want to move to Europe? Simply stated, they are a much stronger
    company as far as European sales go. CBM is the 11th largest computer
    manufacturer. And in the United States, dominated by PC clones and
    some Macintoshes, they have a very small market share of about 6%,
    compared to 13% to 21% in Europe. CBM is tied for first with IBM in
    Europe. With all this data, it might seem obvious that CBM should move
    to Europe. I think not.
        With a lack of sales in the US, and the shear fact that the US is
    such a large market, it would make more sense for CBM to actually
    invest more in the US market! They have already taken lead in Europe;
    all they have to do is hang on to that lead. But ignoring the US will
    lead to a decline in developers, since 80% of the Amiga developers are
    in fact in the US. It is a very good marketing strategy to focus
    resources on markets where the Amiga does not have a strong share.
    It would be stupid for CBM to ignore the US market and let it die,
    since the loss of developers would also lead to a worldwide loss of
    sales.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    0003    What has already been lost?

        CBM used to have a good share of the educational market. They
    had about 800,000 units in US schools. Recently it has declined to
    about 600,000. Apple had about 1,200,000 units, although recently it
    has been updated to about 1,400,000 units or more. Why did this happen?
    Because while CBM ignored the educational market, Apple focused
    resources on that market. Hence sales rose. In my schools, I see
    posters and advertisements in the school papers for IBM clones,
    Macintoshes, and even UNIX machines. But I have yet to see CBM put
    an ad in the school paper or even hang posters on the wall, like
    Apple and IBM do. I have not seen a university computer store with
    anything other than Macintoshes and IBM's. I have met very few
    people who even know what the Amiga is.
        CBM recently released UNIX 2.1 in the US. But not in Australia,
    or in parts of Europe, where it would be most welcome, since UNIX
    has not yet caught on in those markets. And CBM is a respected company
    who could surely do something right in those markets. In fact people
    often praise Commodore in those parts of the world for service. But
    not in the US, although Gold Service is a great asset that we all
    welcome. CBM lost many UNIX programmers last fall. And they are
    having trouble getting some UNIX applications ported to Amiga UNIX
    simply because they have not proven that CBM is serious about UNIX.
    And CBM blundered by sending a beta SVR4 release to a popular UNIX
    magazine, which hence received bad reviews. But that can all be changed.
        CBM makes IBM clones, which sell very well in Europe. They make
    486 towers, laptops, and other clone products. They do have a very wide
    range of IBM machines, unlike they do with the Amiga line. They do
    however sell IBM Bridgeboards in three versions; an XT, a 286, and a
    recently released 386. Note that I said recently released 386. Why
    not a 486? Isn't it logical that a 486 should have been released
    since it is the next big processor in the Intel family? Do we have
    to rely on Vortex to release a 386 Bridgeboard and hopefully a 486
    Bridgeboard? 386 and even 486 machines have been out for years now.
        CDTV is a new generation of computer consoles. It is directly
    competing with CD-I, and is showing healthy sales, although not to
    the expectations of earlier projections. But it is currently
    outselling CD-I, although that may change. CD-I has a larger
    consortium of supporters; there are lots of companies hoping to
    release CD-I products such as Phillips, Nintendo, Panasonic, Tandy,
    etc. There is only one CDTV manufacturer and only one model. CD-I
    also has better screen resolution at 24 bits, while CDTV has only
    4-6 bits with HAM mode in limited 12 bits. Other than that, CDTV is
    in every way better. It has thousands of programs that work with
    it since it is Amiga compatible. It can emulate IBM and Macintosh
    software, just as the Amiga can. It can potentially even run UNIX.
    It can be expanded with a keyboard, mouse, modem, and hard drives.
    It can receive video upgrades and uses PCMIA flash-ram cards, although
    this needs to be improved with the new PCMIA standards. It has CDXL
    on the way for partial video. It can potentially read Photo CD, which
    CD-I will soon also read. What does CDTV need to be the clear winner
    ahead of CD-I? It needs 24 bit graphics, Photo CD licensing from
    Kodak, and more manufacturers to build CDTV machines. But the last
    would mean licensing out the custom chip set, which is a no-no
    according to CBM, although it has been done before for Arcade games
    and flight simulators. But not for Amiga third party laptops or for
    Pheonix motherboards to upgrade an A1000 to an A3000.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    0004    What should Commodore do in the US?

        CBM should start marketing the Amiga. Begin with magazine ads.
    In the past year, I would occasionally see a CBM ad. In the last month
    I have seen about 10 ads in Compute, the late Info, InfoWorld, Computer
    Graphics World, Computer Pictures, Videomaker, another PC magazine
    (PC Week? PC Magazine?), along with some CDTV ads. But the current
    issues do not have these ads. In order for an ad campaign to be
    effective, there should be ads in either every issue or every other
    issue. That would be a campaign blitz. And the ads could stand for
    some improvement.
        For example, the Computer Graphics World ad has been reused a few
    times. That is the one with the director's chair and the Amiga 3000,
    along with 6 or 8 pictures of applications or clip art. First of all,
    put more color into those mostly black and white ads. Second, use
    three dimensional pictures instead of two dimensional clip art, such
    as the trumpet used in that ad. Next, get rid of that blocky Old West
    font and use something more like Cooper or even some color fonts. And
    add more three dimensional graphics such as a 3d logo similar to the
    one I made and uploaded to larc.nasa.gov before the great meltdown.
    It is called cbm_logo.lzh, and should be on a mirror site. Simply
    put, open up the same magazine you put the ad in, and flip around the
    pages and look at ads for other companies. You will notice a difference.
    I did. I even ran a test once. I knew that a certain PC magazine had
    a CBM ad in it. I decided to read the magazine as I normally would
    scan it when I first get it. I went through the whole magazine and
    missed the CBM ad. When I went back and found it, I was not too
    impressed by the lack of color and three dimensional images. For heavens
    sake, get NewTek or GVP to do some ads for you! And check out the
    recent Digital Creations ads for DCTV...they put some very hot
    pictures in there...even better than the NewTek screen shots. NewTek
    has focused more on video shots rather than three dimensional graphics,
    but some of their ads have been good. I don't like the current ones,
    but I like their logo, along with the GVP ImpactVision logo of the
    eyeball. And check out some NeXT ads...also done in good taste. The
    Pagestream HotLink ads with the old car on them also look nice.
        Remember the CDTV ads with the Groucho Marx eyeglasses? They look
    bad...no color at all, no perspective in the CDTV view, poor choice of
    fonts, and poor arrangement on the page. All CBM ads have those
    wierd borders around them...they are not that bad, but you could use
    a little variation once in a while. That is valuable space that you are
    using. The CDTV Demo Tape ads are done well, although still not in
    color...and I think they also have the Old West boxy font. But it is
    good that a CDTV demo does exist...hopefully CBM showed some animations
    similar to the NewTek Revolution demo tape. Along with the Amiga line
    of computers. And remeber, it should be easy for customers to get the
    tape; otherwise, they won't even bother. Provide an 800 toll-free
    number where names and shipping addresses can be taken down, ship tapes
    out for free, and put as much on the tape as you can...don't wimp out
    with a 15 minute tape when you can make it an hour. And don't be afraid
    to use long play vcr modes or update the tape regularly. I have yet
    to see the CDTV demo tape. I hope you're working on an Amiga demo tape.
        UNIX ads were so long ago I don't remember much about them. But
    here are some more tips:

            don't advertise 4096 colors;
                say 12bit graphics upgradeable to 24 bits since IBM users
                are getting used to numbers like 262,000

            don't advertise IBM compatibility as if it is a feature;
                say the Amiga offers an IBM 386 Bridgeboard for
                Windows 3.1 applications and MS-DOS, on an expansion
                card - there is no need to mention that it is available
                separately because you did not mention the cost of the
                Amiga in the ad, which makes the Amiga a base unit

            don't use a mostly black and white page;
                use lots of colors with three dimensional images,
                complex floorplans, ray-traced images, a three dimensional
                CBM logo, a perspective view of the Amiga with both
                floppy bays exposed instead of just df0:, no more
                borders in the edges, and stack VCR's and laser disk
                players next to the Amiga, along with high end stereo
                equipment and large speakers (not the Amiga detachable
                speakers)

            don't show external Amiga peripherals;
                it looks kludgy to see an external modem or floppy
                drive...people want those things inside the computer,
                but of course CDTV peripherals are the exception.

                Show a nice layout of the custom chips, and next
                to each chip explain the name of the chip (big letters)
                along with a nice description of what it does...and
                make sure the photos of the custom chips are perspective
                views and not side views or bird's eye views...take
                a look at the current July 1992 Amiga World ad for
                SunRize Industries audio card to see how they displayed
                their logic chip.

                the new Amiga mouse is very good; don't put the old one
                in the ads...redo the ads that recirculate with the old
                mouse and old monitors...use 1960 or 1950 monitors

            don't print specifications in paragraph form (use outlines);

    0011    How should CBM promote the Amiga at low cost?

        Yesterday I called a local shopping mall here in Long Island.


        HER:    SmithHaven Mall...

        ME:     I would like information on holding an exhibit at the mall.

        HER:    What kind of product do you have?

        ME:     Electronics equipment.

        HER:    Oh, that would be the Energy Show in August.

        ME:     How much would it cost to lease a site?

        HER:    It depends on where it is located; the main galley costs
                more.

        ME:     What might I expect to pay?

        HER:    Eight hundred dollars.

        ME:     Eight hundred a day?

        HER:    No, eight hundred for the whole show.

        ME:     And how long is the show?

        HER:    About two weeks long, starting the last weekend
                in August into early September.

        ME:     (Not clear if she meant two weekends or two weeks)
                Okay, thankyou.



            Well, $800 isn't that bad of a price to pay to lease a site
        where you could potentially reach a few thousand potential
        consumers. Plus the cost of hired help...but is that really a
        considerable cost? CBM only has to send down one representative!
        They don't even have to send any equipment if they can get local
        Amiga delears and video businesses to donate time and equipment.
        I would surely donate my equipment and time to demonstrate Amiga
        equipment for two weeks! I am sure that many other people would
        love to also. And it is important that all staff members actually
        know something about the computer that they are demonstrating.
        And they should have lots of demos, such as Eurodemos, the
        Revolution tape, local cable TV projects, and graphics slideshows
        (I have 20 megs of pictures even though I deleted lots of them),
        along with lots of good Soundtracker modules (again I have 30 megs
        of compressed modules, of which 10 megs or so are very good).

            I often suggested similar ideas to CBM via their USENET email
        address, suggestions@cbmvax.cbm.commodore.com. I told them that
        it would be cost effective and very productive to send out one
        representative on a tour of the US. All he needs is a van, some
        demo machines, and lots of demo software that he knows how to use,
        such as pictures, music, 3d programs, business programs, and
        multimedia programs. Appointments should be made with schools,
        small businesses, and corporations to view the product. I can
        imagine 4 or so demonstrations a day, 5 days a week in major
        cities across the US. Hotel accomidations? Sleep in the van or
        use a camper! Or look for budget motels. I slept in my van with
        2 or 3 other people for two weeks, and I have a mini van. It wasn't
        crowded because we each had our own cars and jobs during the day.
        But of course we just recently moved into our house, so it isn't
        going to happen until we go on vacation...but it wasn't that bad
        if you know where to find utilities such as a shower. There are
        showers on beaches and in gymnasiums (we parked on campus). We
        also occasionally stopped by friend's apartments who invited us
        to use their utilities.
            This week on the USENET I heard something like my above idea.
        To paraphrase, I read:

                "The plan to sell Amigas via home demonstrations has
                been scrapped."

        At least someone considered the idea. But it is a good way to
        reach customers.

            What next? The Home Shopping Network! Where any item is
        top of the line! Even people who won't buy it will at least
        see it and hear about it, and it doesn't cost CBM any money
        to market them!
            How about local cable TV classified ads? Many of those
        places are cheap for advertising especially if you make a long
        term agreement. And many of them are even running on the Amiga!
        And how about TV commercials in the Preview Guide on some cable
        networks? Ours diplays TV listing on the bottom half of the screen
        and has TV ads in the top half...I usually watch the TV ads and
        miss reading the TV listings! And make new commercials with lots
        of graphics...I'd rather see the Revolution tape than the Stevie
        ads...but none the less, the Stevie ads are somewhat entertaining,
        I must agree, and they do have recognition from TV personalities
        such as Tip O'Neill.
            Make a wham bang TV multimedia ad, showing the Amiga in
        action. Show how easy it is to make a presentation. And put that
        commercial on CNN or Headline News. Keep on using these key words
        often in the ad:

            multimedia
            multitasking
            high resolution graphics
            Super VGA compatible
            custom chips
            24 bit graphics             (don't mention additional hardware
                                         I'll explain this better later)
            IBM 386, UNIX, and Macintosh compatible
            Motorola 68030 and 68040
            cd quality sound
            virtual reality
            interactive media
            cd rom compatible
            laserdisc compatible
            kiosk
            interlaced video
            business applications
            word processing
            data bases
            spreadsheets
            Video Toaster


            "The leader in multimedia"
            "Fully multitasking system"
            "Integrated custom chip set"
            "One gigabyte ram address space - no 640k limit"
            "Thousands of software applications"
            "Large user installed base"
            "Leader in interactive media"
            "Video Toaster compatible"
            "Three dimensional graphics"
            "CD quality sound"


            Why is it not necessary to keep mentioning additonal
        hardware is necessary? After all, CBM has yet to announce a
        68040 processor for the Amiga (25 June 1992)...but they are
        available from third party sources. And why not mention that
        a 24 bit board is necessary even though the University of Lowell
        Board does not work with AmigaDOS? Because 24 bit boards are
        available from third party sources. Think of it this way. When
        you buy an IBM clone, they put in game cards, SVGA cards, Sound
        Blasters, and Windows 3.1, but the clone manufacturer itself does
        not in fact manufacturer them...they are third party peripherals.
        Just don't say in the ads that 24 bits and IBM emulation comes
        standard with the Amiga and you'll do fine!

        CBM should make their print ads (good ones) into posters, and
    distribute them freely to schools and businesses. I see lots of
    Macintosh and IBM posters although they all look boring anyway,
    but they are there, and people know what an IBM is and what a
    Macintosh is. And put nice 3d logos, such as the CDTV logo, on the
    ad. How about Amiga t-shirts? I would buy one other than the one
    I bought at the World of Amiga in NYC. I admit that the shirt sucks,
    but that was the only one they had in the April 1991 show. It says
    AMIGA in different colors on a collared shirt, right where you
    would expect to find an alligator. The AMIGA is way to small. People
    don't see it. It is too subtle. CBM should start making Amiga shirts
    with AMIGA in big black bold print on the front and back, along
    with "The Multimedia Computer" and "The Computer for the Creative
    Mind". And last of all, make Amiga bumper stickers! As soon as I
    get one, I am putting it on my van (but my van is another story).
    Hell, I'd put a huge Amiga logo on that thing if I could get my
    hands on one.

        Offer Amiga and CDTV units as prizes for TV game shows such
    as Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, etc. Advertise on TV for children's
    shows, such as cartoons on Saturday. Nothing sells itself more than
    a 10 year old saying 'Mommy, Daddy, I want an Amiga 500'. Have
    commercials with kids using the computer to play games, saying
    things like 'way cool', 'to the max', 'radical', and 'awesome' a lot.
    You have to emplant it into their minds. Have the parents later
    standing next to each other (with their arms around each other - family
    stuff), say something like, "Look Harv, our Jimmy drew a picture!",
    and the mother laysher hand on the head of the boy in a gentle way.


    "But David, we have been telling that to CBM for years. And also,
    David, if I had been on USENET recently I would know what you were
    talking about in the second half of the last paragraph! It was a good
    joke!"

        Right. And has CBM listened? Sure they have. But there are some
    people somewhere in CBM who think that everything is a failure just
    because one magazine ad didn't increase sales 200% over the last
    quarter. I knew that CDTV wouldn't sell well...it cost $1200! When
    it gets down to $500 it will sell...when it gets down to $300 it will
    be a sales boom!

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    0012    What can we do to help out CBM?

        Wear an Amiga t-shirt everywhere you go in public. Put an Amiga
    bumper sticker on your car. Stop in at computer stores and ask if they
    sell Amiga computers - you heard it was a great computer. Argue with
    your IBM friends about how great your computer is. Hang up signs that
    have IBM with a big X crossing it out. Make pictures of apples with
    worms coming out of them. Put an Amiga checkmark in your USENET
    .signature file. Join a users group and talk constantly about the
    Amiga. Bring demo disks to stores that sell the Amiga and give them
    to the salesperson. Eurodemos are good. Write letters to magazines
    such as Videomaker, Video Review, CD, Audio Review, Byte, Computer
    Shopper, etc, and mention that the Amiga is perfect for your work
    and that you hope to see more coverage. Write an article about the
    CDTV and about how bad the CD-I is and send it to magazines for
    publishing. Make sure you look up the specificatiosn on both machines
    first so you can be fair when you bash the other machine. Send in
    pictures you drew or raytraced into CBM and give them rights to use
    your work for advertising and demos. Also send CBM music modules
    that you personally have written. Make a full page ad with PageStream
    or ProPage and send it in to CBM and tell them they are free to use
    it. Make animations and put them on VHS tape or floppy disk, and also
    send those to CBM. Think of ways to improve the operating system
    and send them to CBM. Buy Commodore stock (currently at $10 per share
    down from $14 in recent months and $11 in recent weeks). Hope that
    IBM clone makers will start making IBM Bridgeboards for the Amiga.

    What can CBM do to help CBM?

        CBM ought to make an Amiga demo tape. How should they get demos
    for this tape? Hold a contest like the Amiga World contest. Prizes
    should be a choice of certain CBM products or gift certificates, and
    consolation prizes of t-shirts and bumper stickers. Commodore doesn't
    even need to advertise that the contest exists; just post details on
    USENET, GEnie, BIX, and Portal. Word will get around. Give four
    months until the contest ends. No wait, make it a super long contest
    where a new demo tape is made every four month period.

        CBM's loss: a few Amiga units and staff time,
                    plus a few thousand VHS tapes.

        CBM's gain: sales up the wazoo.


        CBM ought to hold a desktop publishing contest for the best print
    ads. I know people who have offered to do things for CBM for free, so
    I am sure they could receive lots of good ads this way. Then publish
    the ads in magazines.

        CBM's loss: a few Amiga units and staff time,
                    plus printing and advertising space.

        CBM's gain: national recognition.


        CBM ought to make an infomercial that seems like a news report
    about a grounds breaking new multimedia machine, and send it through
    the Associated Press or whatever news feeds. And don't forget to also
    put your address and contact number in the infomercial.

        CBM's loss: staff time, video editing costs.

        CBM's gain: free advertising.


        CBM ought to give free A500's to be raffled off by local groups,
    such as little league baseball teams, boy and girl scout troops,
    enemy user groups (clones, macs, and generic groups), and small shops
    such as a pizza shop or a local restaurant. Or even for school fund
    raising (marching band, sports, chess club, Amiga club, etc).

        CBM's loss: some staff time, long distance phone bills,
                    a few hundred A500 units, raffle ticket printing.

        CBM's gain: lots of kids will learn of the machine, and will go
                    door to door selling raffle tickets to win an Amiga.


        CBM ought to send demo tapes to specific places, including but
    not limited to:

            TV station news departments
            CNN and Headline News
            local cable TV operators
            small businesses
            libraries
            school districts
            museums
            colleges and universities
            art schools
            small video shops
            MTV and other music video production houses
            politicians who are running for president (H Ross Perot)
            local governemt officials (they have lots of spending power)
            big software houses
            big hardware houses
            Amiga developers, such as GVP, Supra, etc.
            photo shops, video stores, IBM clone dealers
            university computer centers
            foreign ex-communist governments - for TV production

    0013    What hardware should CBM develop to better itself?

        Sell the cheapest Amiga you can (currently Amiga 500) to
    developing nations at super low prices...once they are hooked on
    a machine they will stick to it...and buy high end models...and buy
    software. Move in the Amiga 600 as soon as possible so that you
    can bring lower prices (through the surface mounted design) and the
    highly valuable PCMIA slot. Give a few free ones and encourage them
    to buy more at regular prices or whatever. But if you take a loss
    now, you will earn much more money in the future.

        We need a 25 mHz 486 Bridgeboard or a 50 mHz 386 Bridgeboard, and
    we need it yesterday. So get moving, CBM! And offer a SVGA card for
    under $200...you don't have to make it yourself, just OEM one, okay?

        We need a CD ROM drive that works with an external SCSI port.
    Imagine if instantly all Amiga users started buying CDTV applications,
    hence boosting CDTV development. The A570 is still not available even
    though it is long overdue. And it only works with the A500.

        Get some cheap networking on the new Amigas, or at least make
    an expansion card. Schools won't buy anything now days unless it is
    networked.

        Get working on releasing the new chip set. And release the new
    Workbench as soon as the software is ready; I am not going to read
    the manuals anyway. Why can't I be entitled to a new operating system
    any sooner? I know that the manual publishing causes much delay.

        Release a 68040 board, and do another A2500 thingy with an A3000
    and a 68040 in the co-processor slot. If you can't make your own
    Bridgeboard, OEM one from Progressive or GVP!

        If all it takes to make an A3000 50 mHz is to exchange the old
    68030 and 68882 with faster ones, then do it now and stop wasting
    time!

        Start selling a reduced cost version of the A3000 so we can fill
    the gap in the mid range systems...or did the price of the A2000 drop
    to realistic levels recently?

        How about a laptop, eh?

        We need a 24 bit CDTV before CD-I sales pick up! Remember that
    CD-I has a large backbone so crack it before it gets into swing. And
    get CDXL finished if it isn't already, and fight for Photo CD licensing
    from Kodak. Make CDTV ads that tell the truth about how it was out
    before CD-I and about how it can be made Photo CD compatible with the
    DCTV trick, if it is even available.

        How about CDTV II? Here are some more ideas:

            upgrade the PCMIA to the latest version
            put in an internal floppy drive
            get rid of the disk caddies
            get a better style for the case
            put in real mouse ports and joystick ports
            add a bay for an internal hard disk
            add some more expansion slots so multiple devices can be used
            add 24 bit graphics
            add ECS chips or whatever new things you have
            add 16 mHz or 25 mHz 68030's
            make it Video Toaster compatible
            hey, while your at it, how about a few Bridgeboard slots too?

        We need a new low end Amiga. How low? I'll tell you. An Amiga 300
    with no keyboard. Just a PCMIA slot, an external floppy drive port,
    an internal IDE port for those dinky little 2.5 inch drives, a keyboard
    port (but no keyboard) and two mouse ports. Call it the Amiga games
    console. It would sell like wildfire in Europe and markets where the
    Commodore 64 is still selling hundreds of thousands of units a year.
    Remember that those markets have yet to catch on to games consoles.
    In a few years Sega and Nintendo will be blitzing over there...they
    have already announced plans to hit the European market. Don't lose
    it, okay?

        Hi. I was wondering why it is so hard to advertise something. I
    don't understand what is so complicated about picking up a phone
    and reserving space in a magazine issue, and then sending over the
    print that they would use. Remember when I emailed cbmvax with some
    magazine addresses and phone numbers? Well, try calling them. And
    for each magazine, focus on the topic. Put educational ads in the
    educational magazines. Put video related ads in video magazines. And
    start publishing your own magazine with CBM products, uses, and third
    party support. Obviously it would help if you got third party companies
    to advertise too.
        I strongly urge you to hold a publishing contest for the best ad.
    It is cheap labor and you are more likely to find ads that have been
    professionally done by Amiga enthusiasts. So give it a try. Remember,
    people don't buy things if they don't know it exists.
        Why do you bother advertising in Amiga magazines? Isn't that kind of
    stupid? Amiga owners already know that the Amiga exists, and they will
    hear about new Amigas as they are released or sooner (remember how Amiga
    World had a premature release of the A3000T and the CDTV). Don't advertise
    in Amiga magazines!
        Is is better to advertise every other month for a year than every month
    for six months. You will reach a larger time span, albeit with a few
    possible omissions.
        I saw a quick glimse of a CDTV ad on the Prevue Guide today. I am
    waiting for the next run and have been taping the Prevue Guide for the
    past three hours. I have seen other ads repeated, but not the CDTV ad yet.
    I wonder why.

        A funny thing just happened. My new housemate just walked in and
    asked me what I was doing. I explained. He then asked what kind of
    computer I have. When I said an Amiga, he said he never heard of it.
    Funny to hear that coming from an Information Systems major.

        Hello. I was wondering something. Did you ever hear that in order
    to make money you have to make an investment first? Well, usually, the
    more you invest, the more you earn. And the more you invest, the
    better your product becomes. And the better your product becomes, the
    more sales you have. And sales now make sales later as the product line
    expands.
        I hear that you only invest 2.5% of your total sales on research
    and development. That is funny, because most computer companies spend
    three or four times as much on research and development. And many of
    these companies are constantly releasing hot new products in limited
    time. I was thinking that maybe CBM should invest more in research
    and development.
        You might think that it is not necessary. But I disagree. CBM has
    yet to market a laptop Amiga. There is no 486 Bridgeboard. There is
    no CD ROM drive for any Amiga, although the A570 is supposedly
    imminent. In Europe. There is no true mid-range Amiga system. The
    CDTV has not been upgraded since its release, and improvements are
    direly needed for such a new product. There seem to be great lags
    in software development. There is no 68040 Amiga. There is no new
    chip set. Research should be increased; there are many people out
    there looking for jobs with a large company. I see a perfect match.
    Most companies that do not develop new products merely die away.

        With my luck there will be a hundred Irving Goulds in the world,
    so I hope this gets to the real one. Basically, I noticed that you
    seem to own a small portion of CBM stock. One thing about that stock
    that you may not have known; the value of it changes depending on the
    performance of the company that it represents. For example, if you
    buy $11 shares for $1 each, and you buy one million shares, you have
    earned ten million dollars. But if that stock value decreases to
    five dollars per share, you have gained only four million dollars.
    Ten million is greater than four million. Likewise, if the value of
    that stock grows to $21 per share, you have earned twenty million
    dollars, which is more than four million and ten million. Therefor
    you make more money. And believe me, that stock value is dependant
    on the value of the company. If a company does not do well, you lose.
    If it does do well, you win. I understand that you may need to make
    two million dollars per year in salary in order to put food on the
    table, just like I who make a cool six thousand a year at Burger King.
    But maybe if some of that two million you make every year went towards
    improving the company stock value, you might make that twenty million
    I was talking about before. Actually, you could still be the fifth
    highest paid CEO of a computer company and increase the research and
    development budget, which increases your sales and market share, which
    increases your stock value and hence increaes your salary. Kind of
    like some investments I made. I bought a pair of black shoes for $30
    so I could work at Burger King, and have turned that $30 a year
    investment into a whoppering six thousand dollar investment, which is
    a two hundred percent increase on my initial investment.

        Hi. I just wanted to let you know that there are some things in
    your country that people wanted to buy but cannot because you do not
    sell them. For example, Amiga UNIX exists in the United States. But
    does it exist in your country? Same with the 386 Bridgeboard. And the
    Amiga 600. And the 2.04 roms, which should be easy to provide on
    floppy disks. And the A570 CD ROM drive. And rumor has it that in
    some countries it is hard to find an Amiga 3000. Or a tower A3000.
    And worst of all, I hear that some Amiga 3000's cost up to three times
    more than in the US. I also hear people claim that they have to
    actually leave the country in order to buy Amiga computers or hardware.
    Very interesting. If you want to make the world a better place, take
    a look at yourself and make that change. You got to get it right while
    you get the chance. You might end up losing your mind and plastic
    surgery won't help that. Hurry up before some enemy computer company
    moonwalks all up and down you.

        Hi. I have an Amiga. And lately I have seen many improvements
    in other computer systems that have yet to arrive on the Amiga
    platform. Many people are abandoning their Amigas in favor of these
    other systems. They know that things are becoming cost effective over
    there, and that the competition has caught up to and in some ways
    surpassed the Amiga development.
        You argue that the SoundBlaster has better audio support than
    the Amiga. Sure the specs are great, but I have yet to hear that a
    SoundBlaster has the proper quality. But it definitely has an
    advantage, even though the majority of music development has been
    popularized on the Amiga.
        You also claim that SVGA is the best graphics standard. I have
    heard this also, since it is very nice. But I have heard that some
    SVGA cards do lack in quality, but you still can't beat the price
    for the performance.
        Ah, and you like your Windows 3.1 software, even though it
    doesn't have true multitasking and is extremely slow. It does not
    run on the slower IBM machines. But software support is steadily
    growing. Yes, another reason to abandon the Amiga. But the Amiga
    can still catch up. It has potential, and it has one of the cleanest
    designed operating systems of all the personal computers.

        The SVGA and audio is nice, but it is still not user friendly
    enough for me. Nor is it productive enough. You must not have seen
    multiple screens on the Amiga before. It is great, especially with
    a fast 16 mHz 68030 processor. I am not yet ready to abandon the
    Amiga. It still has potential, and it is very fun. Maybe in a few
    more months I will be ready to dump it, but that would only be if
    CBM doesn't get it's act together once and for all.

        Hi. My name is David Tiberio. I live in Long Island, New York,
    which is in the United States of America, on a small bit plane called
    6 Lodge Lane. I want to tell you that since you care about your Amiga
    I would like for you to take on a mission of gathering information.
    And of being productive. And of having fun and enjoying your Amiga.
    Because it may not be around for long. But you can do something about
    it without spending a significant amount of money. If you want to
    help the Amiga, your investment in a computer, you may want to
    consider my proposition.

        If you are on USENET, BIX, GEnie, Portal, CompuServe, BITNET,
    American People Link (that would be a tough one though), etc, could
    you please find out if it offers the following services for me?

        Does it have customer support from third party Amiga developers?
        Does it have customer support for Commodore?

        Are people satisfied with the Amiga?
        Are people generally happy or sad with Commodore?

        Does the Amiga appear to be a growing platform or a dieing one?
        Does Commodore appear to be a growing company or a dieing one?

        Do you have access to freely distributable Amiga software?
        Do you have access to software updates from Commodore?
        Does Commodore update software frequently enough?


        After answering these questions, could you do me one simple
    favor? All I ask is that you send email to Commodore and tell them
    if you are happy or sad with them. And if you have any ideas for
    upgrades to the operating system, could you please tell them? Also,
    if you have ideas for marketing Amiga hardware, please feel free to
    explain away. And last of all, if you would be willing to donate
    some artwork that you created yourself, or some sample magazine ads,
    or places where CBM could place an advertisement, could you please
    let them know? Or if you want, let me know. I can't do much other
    than send email to CBM, but maybe someday that will change. My email
    address is at the top of this article. Note that for the summer of
    1992 I have been having trouble with receiving and sending email...
    absolutely nothing has appeared to get through recently, but I am
    regularly on usenet in comp.sys.amiga.advocacy, and would be glad to
    discuss it there.

    is at the top of this page.]

    tilted towards enemy computers? Such as how a magazine such as MPC
    World does not like the CDTV, and never really mentions all of its
    strong points that make it so valuable? Ever notice how Byte makes
    claims that the Amiga is not the best choice for video? Well, this
    can be changed. We need people knowledgable on the Amiga and the
    enemy computer systems to write well informed articles that match
    the best with the best. All strong points should be mentioned so that
    the reader can get an unbiased view. And be very thorough and concise;
    don't be too wordy. Give all of the specifications. Write up a storm,
    and send them to magazine publishers. We need comparative essays
    and not just letters of complaint. Show concern. Show intelligence.
    Show rationality. Show something. If I were CBM, I would have hired
    a group of people to do this a long time ago. CBM should publish its
    own magazine and distribute it. They should have bought Info magazine,
    which was entirely produced on Amigas, and was very critical to the
    welfare of the Amiga. Yes they gave CBM bad press. But maybe that
    was an appropriate action.

        Oh, and if anyone happens to see an Amiga logo decal suitable for
    adhering to an acrylic eurathane surface, please let me know . I'd stick
    it right on the back door of my Chevrolet Astro van.
