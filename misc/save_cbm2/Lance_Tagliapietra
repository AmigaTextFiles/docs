         An Amiga User Responds to Robinson by Lance Tagliapietra

I read that article when it was posted on comp.sys.amiga.misc (I get get bitnet
echo of that newsgroup) and found it full of half-truths then and even more
so two weeks later.  I am definetly looking forward to Commodores reply when
it gets posted.  Here are a few comments of my own.

First,  he present an interesting history of the Amiga, one that is not
totally correct.  Unfortunately I can't locate my file on the conception of
the Amiga.

And 8 years later, it is still the only computer that can make the boast of
a true multitasking operating system.

And still have not got it right. PC Computing did a readers survey on what
commercial software have you purchased and shelved. Windows ranked first.
OS/2 was first in the operating systems group.

And without additional (non standard) hardware, the pc can still only beep
or buzz.  I have not seen a clone yet with any d/a audio channels on the
motherboard.

I believe he is referencing a recent issue of COMPUTER MONTHLY, a magazine
that is somewhat like the early days of computer shopper.  The columnist did
not want to do the column anymore, and his last column was not very pro-amiga.
I wonder if the magazine cut the column to give more space for pc support.
When I read that column I thought of writing the editor and asking if another
person could continue it.  I haven't followed up on that idea yet, but I
challenge you to do so.

Funny, I don't have a toaster.  I see people fighting with Windows all day
at work, where I have to suffer with a 12MHz 286 machine that is only 1/8 as
useful as my 7.14 Mhz Amiga 2000 because of its multitasking OS in rom. Every
day about 30 seconds after booting my pc at work, I miss my Amiga.

Funny, the more people I show my amiga too, the more awe it brings out in
them.  I don't consider the amiga to be a pc, it is my Personal Workstation.
This writer doesn't seem to understand that there are many parts to a computer
system, the pc's have a very fast cpu if you want to pay for a 486/33 machine.
But it still only does one task at a time.  A multitasking os in ROM is one
specification that the pc's will NEVER be able to beat.
