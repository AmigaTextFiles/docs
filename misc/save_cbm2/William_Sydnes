    Well, it isn't a matter of what percentage of your R&D goes to Amiga
development. It is what percentage of your budget goes to R&D.

    Tell the rest of the world who doesn't already know about it.

    And you did. I am very pleased by both the A1200 and the A4000.

    *YAWN* It's been 7 or 8 months already and nothing new has appeared.
Meanwhile Apple has announced and released 10 or so new models.

    But not of my computer, the A3000. I guess I will have to sell it
if I want AGA as opposed to buying a non-existant AGA expansion board.

    You mean like the RUMORED digital sound processor? And the RUMORED
Alpha CPU support (samples already shipping)? And the RUMORED floptical
drives?

    Wish I could say the same about software developers and dealers.
