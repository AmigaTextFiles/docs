            Amiga Coverage in a Video Magazine by Brian Bowles


            Hey fellow Amigoids, If your down in the dumps about the
        lack of press for the Amiga cheer up!  You'll never guess
        what's on the cover of "Videography, the magazine of
        proffessional video production, technology, and
        applications"(Well maybe you will).  Amiga video 1992 a
        special report.  This is a count'em 28 page special report
        on the current state of Amiga video graphics.  Here is a
        small excerpt from the article:

           "Amiga Video users exhibit a unique spirit not often found
          among their IBM and Mac counterparts.  They support one
          another adamantly in the face of increasing competition and
          the occasional doubting Thomas who still doesn't think that
          the Amiga can handle tough jobs.  Many in the community have
          expressed frustration that the Amiga has yet to advance
          beyond it's basic internal configuration of a 16-bit buss
          and custom graphics chips that are now nearly five years
          old.  Nevertheless, Amigians stand wholly determined to
          prove to the computer graphics and video production worlds
          that their computer of choice can produce work to rival
          anyone's."

            I would like to point out that this is a fairly major
        industry magazine and this is one of the biggest articles
        for anything I have ever found in Videography.  I hope this
        makes all my fellow Amiga addicts feel a lot better about
        the current state of the industry.  And for all the IBM/Mac
        wannabe whiners out there, EAT THIS!
