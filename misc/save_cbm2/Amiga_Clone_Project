                An Amiga Clone Project by Thomas Leavitt


    Yo, Amiga people!  If you're serious about wanting the Amiga of your
dreams, the $700 machine from hell, then put up or shut up:

    An authoritative source tells me that development costs to the prototype
stage should run under $50,000 if we work it correctly, and perhaps half that
if we are careful.

    So, that means that 100 people have to put up $500, or 200 $250, or 400
$125.

    I think $100,000 should give us a comfortable margin of operating capital.  I'm looking around for a designer right now, any of you
incredibly literate computer design people that know enough to put SCSI on a
motherboard for less than $10 care to volunteer in exchange for a chunk of
speculative stock, or want to enter cash bids?
