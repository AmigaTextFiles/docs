Do a FIND for it off the German site, Wustl doesn't seem to have it by the

The reason computers boot so slowly is that there is lots of
processing to do between each item that is loaded. fastboot simply
grabs all the ram in use, copies it to your hd (about 2-3 megs) and
whenever you boot it simply copies it back. perfect bootup in 5
seconds flat!

Hi Andy

There's only two "fixes" that I know of and niether are what you
could call transformative.

Aki Laukkanen's TKGPatch (available on aminet) which is a speed up
patch, basically better C2P routines and an optional frame counter.
Definitely worth having, but you'll still be cursing the speed.

The other fix is for the Editor and was released by Andy Clitheroe.
Also on Aminet.

I have 030@50 AGA and consider most of my levels playable in 1x1 small
screen, reduced rendering quality + TKGPatch, but some of the more
complex ones I have to go down to 2x1. And when I say playable I mean
playable not smooth. Others would doubtless disagree with "playable".

If you come across AB3D1, get it. That IS smooth on 030 and though
blocky its a great game. Getting totally hooked on that one is the
reason I'm very tolerant of AB3d2's shortcomings - I just love the
atmos. :)

Also AB3D1 has a much more sensible difficulty curve and playing that
gives you a big (skill) advantage when you start the next game.

If you really do find AB3d2 too difficult the best thing to do is edit
the TEST.LNK file with the GAMELINKER programme, and just increase the
amount of life medipacs give you. To do this you will need SBUnpack
(from Aminet) to unpack TEST.LNK and you will need to know to delete
the .LNK from the load requester of GAMELINKER or it refuses to load
it... (one of the many things Jens put right..)

Oh dear, far too much waffling on about a 2 year old game...

Regards
Mike Child

Hi!

Finally, after months of waiting AI announced the OS partner: QNX.

I didn't know of that system until now, but it seems pretty cool, and much
like the AmigaOS. You can read up on QNX at <http://www.qnx.com>, but don't
expect to find any mention of the Amga on that site yet.

                       THE NEW PARTNERSHIP...

 At Computer '98, currently being held in Cologne, Germany, Amiga
Incorporated has kept their promise and revealed (November 13) the
company which will be their partner in developing Amiga OS 5.0 for the
next generation machines. That company is the Canadian firm QNX
Software Systems Ltd., makers of the realtime operating system QNX.
What follows is information on QSSL, obtained from their website
*_(http://www.qnx.com/,*_ and more in depth information direct from
 on-line question and answer sessions involving key Amiga Incorporated
personnel in Cologne.

                          A LOOK AT QSSL

QSSL (QNX Software Systems Ltd.)
Corporate Headquarters
175 Terence Matthews Crescent
Kanata, Ontario
Canada, K2M 1W8

QNX® RTOS

 QNX is a realtime, extensible POSIX-certified OS with a lean
microkernel and a team of optional cooperating processes. This
flexible architecture lets you scale QNX down for lean embedded
systems, or scale it out to create a virtual super-computer
orchestrating hundreds of processors.

QNX®/Neutrino®

 QNX/Neutrino is a POSIX microkernel that can be scaled to a
standalone system as small as 32K or as large as 4G. A subset of the
modules available for our full OS are now available for QNX/Neutrino -
with more being added every day. Currently QNX/Neutrino is being
designed into deeply embedded applications such as telecom/datacom
devices, industrial controllers, office equipment, and consumer
electronics. We've also recently announced QNX/Neutrino with support
for symmetric multiprocessing. This allows the same code base used in
tiny embedded devices to be easily scaled up to large distributed
networks of SMP clusters.

QSSL COMPANY OVERVIEW

 QNX Software Systems Ltd. was founded in 1980 by Gordon Bell and Dan
Dodge to develop, maintain, and market the QNX realtime operating
system. Privately owned and self-financed, our company has been
profitable each and every year. It has also enjoyed exceptional
growth. In fact, over the past decade, we've expanded our corporate
headquarters four times to handle increases in staff and production.
We have over 40 distribution partners that serve almost 100 countries
worldwide. To support our thriving distribution network in the
European Community, we have a division, QNX Europe, located near
London, England. Our corporate headquarters, which houses facilities
for R&D, sales and marketing, and customer training, is located in
"Silicon Valley North" just outside Ottawa, Canada. Business
Philosophy

 Our approach to business is based on the firm belief that all
dealings with us should be simple and convenient. For instance, we
make our software modular from a technical as well as a pricing
standpoint so that customers can keep costs to a minimum by ordering
only those modules their target application needs. We strive to make
our service and support the best in the business. We offer a 24-hour
online conferencing and update system, a third-party solutions
directory, and an international technology conference. We deliver
three levels of technical support with varying degrees of phone, fax,
and email support. And finally, we offer hands-on training as well as
consulting services. Product Strategy

in the text. Brad}

FROM JEFF SCHINDLER, AMIGA INC'S GENERAL MANAGER

 JSchindl 

 I want you all to understand that Dr. Allan Havemose is head and VP
of devlopment So Allan will be working with QNX as our next generation
foundation OS we will be building the next Amiga architecture on top
of QNX low level OS

 The QNX OS is a microkernel RTOS that is fully protected. It is
network\Internet centric supporing distributed processing. We will be
adding information to our website amiga.com coving the QNX soon.

 We have many months of work ahead to add things like a gaming kit,
multimedia, gui, ... to the foundation os ... we are planning a 24bit
true color object oriented architecture ... we have many things
in the definition stage at this point as we work with QNX.

 As many are aware we have been looking for a partner for the last 9
months. Dr. Havemose has been evaluating all the os possiblities for
the best technology to fit the next amiga. I have been evaluting the
companies to see if they would make the best working relationship and
business partner. QNX was the winner in our minds by a long long way,
then we had to negotiate how we would best work together. Most of the
QNX engineers are Amiga people and have owned Amigas and many still
use them, so they are very excited for this new opportunity. Both QNX
presidents first home computers were Amigas

 We will be building on top of the QNX foundation and QNX is working
on adding many low level features to support our plans for the new
architecture. It will take several months to have the development
platform ready to start programing apps to then months following this
we will release our first version


MARKETING DIRECTOR BILL MCEWEN ON QNX AND THE FUTURE

 Last night we announced the OS foundation partner. QNX!

 We were able to give breakdown of the OS, and see a demonstration of
its capabilities.
 
 We will be placing the presentation and information on the web site
by the end of the month.
 
 The team for the NGAmiga, will be announced soon, again we are in
final specification stage with our partner, and we need to make sure
that the teams can accomplish their tasks.
 
 We have spent over 18 months on market research, the target market is
still Gaming/Internet. According to IDC this market will see 96%
growth over the next 10 years, while PC growth will stall in the next
two years and decline.

DEVELOPMENT'S DR. ALAN HAVERMOSE SPEAKS

Question: What advantage will QNX give us?

Dr. Havermose:
 Several. most importantly it is a fully protected OS with processes
and threads. Also the networking capabilities are very impressive. For
instance, qnx supports transparent networking. where you can move an
applications from one computer to another one without any special
programming. Full support for TCP/IP, with java enabled browser.
Microkenel architecture,where all device drivers run in user space
havemose scalable from 100k rom with no disk to 100s for SMP systems
networked. Powerful ... 

 The classic OS upgrade is scheduled for release in the first half if
99. We have not given a real schedule for the new Amigas. We will first
create a "development system" this will be followed systems.
My focus right now is on the development system. 

 {In OS 5.0} Networking is standard. Browser is standard. java is
standard.

 Question: how many people will you/amiga inc hire for development ?

Dr. Havermose:
 Outside the QNX development group I will probably initially hire
under 20. More later.


 Question: Will amiga os 5 have the same structur as older amiga os
version! I mean C: libs: startup-sequnce and so on? and the same
device names and so :)

Dr. Havermose:
 We haven't made those decisions yet. QNX's layout is different but
very logical, so it will likely be somewhere in between 

 We did a quick survey at qnx. More tna 60% of all engineers have or
had amigas! They fully understand what Amiga is, was and what I want
to do ! Very importnat to me. 

..

 Some confusion here. People often use the words kernel and OS as
synomyms. That is not the case. We will use must of the qnx as our
FOUNDATION. Amiga will add OpenGL, multimedia, user interfaces
configuration and lots of the user experience stuff. 

..

Question: 
 With recent chip anouncments and developments, is the MMC still a
good option? TB GA 


Dr Havermose:
 Assuming the MMC means the "mystery" chip. Yes, but we have multiple
choice of of chips. havemose QNX works on both intel, PPC, mips, and
several risk processors. So we do not have to make a choice yet and we
havent.

 We are working on an "amiga on a PCI card". We plan to use that for
the development system. We are investigating an emulatin option as
well, even though I personally think that the AmigaPCI should havemose
be sufficient.

Question: 
 Do you intend to use the X Window System, as QNX seems to support it
now? 

Dr. Havermose
 no. 

Question:
 What exactly is an "OS partner"? What parts of the QNX OS do you find
interesting? What parts of Classic AmigaOS can we expect to show up in
AOS 5? Eh, ARexx? :) 


Dr. Havermose:
 qnx will provide kernel, file system, device drivers etc. Amiga will
provide ui, graphics, 3d, multimedia, video etc.

Question:
 Realtime OS means that now my multitrack audio/midi project will not
loose sync?!?

Dr. Havermose:
 Exactly. We can do a context switch will full context save/restore in
less than 1 micro second. havemose This allows us and you to use the
OS to synchronize video and audio.


Question:
 Since the writer of glowicons works for SGI too, does this imply any
further implication between SGI and Amiga?

Dr. Havermose:
 no.

Question:
 What functionality did you show in your demo last night of QNX-OS?

Dr. Havermose:
 We moved an application from one computer to another live. It was
running on PC1 and at the press of a button, it began running on a
second system. We played doom running with 1/2 of doom on one PC and
the other half on the other PC. This was doom on QNX, not Windows.
Showed the multiple languages. Booted the entire OS with internet
support, browser, word processor and an animation off a 1.4 MB floppy.

 qnx is mostly in embedded applications. They are in cisco routers,
IBM's pervasive computing initiative, nucelear powerplants, the space
shuttle, etc. Stuff that cannot crash ! Very impressive customer
based.

 We will introduce new UI technologies which combined with the new OS
and networking will put the havemose Amiga back in the lead again.
 
 The sysem can boot from a 100k rom without disks. It can boot using a
bootrom plus a HD, every config is posisble. Graphics memory has no
limitations,other than to do 1208x1024 in 24bits with double buffering
you will need 4 to 8 MB.

Subject: [just-amiga] Bug in ReadArgs() ?

From: Mikolaj Calusinski <bloelle@polbox.com>

Hi,

It seems I found a long standing bug in ReadArgs routine of dos.library. It
shows up when you try to supply a parameter (filename) which spells the
same as in template and when the current path and parameter file are both in
the same directory. To give it a try let's take, say, Multiview. Now,
Multiview first parameter is 'FILE' - so copy any text file to RAM: and
rename it as 'FILE'. Finally cd in shell to RAM: and type 'Multiview file'
and see what happens...
Are there any AmigaOS-Gurus on this list who could comment on this? Is this
really a bug? If so, maybe someone could report this to AI, to make new
release of SetPatch? (Personally I have no idea who's now responsible for
Classic Amiga updates/development so I decided to report it here.)

Regards,

 Try multiview FILE=file and it works fine. OK you maybe shouldn't 
need to do that. However, it says in the Autodocs (which is pretty 
useless for non-programmers) that the ReadArgs function will remove 
parameters from the /M type to fill up the other keywords.

 And is it me or has there been a lack of postings recently?

This is known behaviour.  Try       Multiview "file"

If a file happens to have the same name as a keyword you have to make
it explicit just what you want. You can do this easily by putting the
filename in quotes. You can also use wildcards.

As for reporting problems - like most developers I have no idea
where to send them. Apparently Haage & Partners are now entirely
responsible for OS3.5 (Amiga Inc have sacked their OS3.5 project
manager!), but there has been no formal announcement. I don't
expect Amiga Inc to release any more Setpatch versions, but I
guess H&P might.

Anyway, in this case it isn't a bug, so the problem of where to
send a bug report doesn't arise.

Well, I wouldn't claim Guru status, but I'll comment anyway. I
wouldn't exactly call this a bug, as it is a virtually unavoidable
side effect of the parsing. The response seems appropriate, as
it basically stops in face of an ambiguious condition, which is
probably much stronger than trying to press on. By presenting a
key word as the argument, you put ReadArgs in the position of
determining what the program expects to do with the argument,
which is a job it was not intended to do. It just sorts whatever
the command line supplies into an order defined by the program.
Although it seems 'wrong' in this case, imagine a potentially
destructive command jumping to a conclusion that just because a
file with the same name as a key word exists, choose to treat it
as an argument rather than a key word. No protection, no safety
net, no more file . . .

The 'fix' is quite simple, just fully specify your arguments
when such ambiguity exists, as in 'multiview file file'. That
seems safer than any other alternative.

Subject: [just-amiga] I need a Monitor! Recommendations?

From: "95LHSC" <95LHSC@saltash.cornwall.sch.uk>

Hi, I am thinking of getting a monitor for Christmas, but I need some
recommendations of good ones to buy. I have a budget of about £150, and it
would be great if I could use it if I got a PC to play GTA on!!

From: Mikolaj Calusinski <bloelle@polbox.com>

Greets to all recipients,

Thanks to those who replied for enlightening me. It's just like I suspected
- this strange behaviour is known; I would argue whether it's 100% proper
though. I considered myself quite experienced Amiga user; even coding
little proggies in assembly from time to time. Two days ago I assembled a
small util for my Apollo turboboard and it (in its early test version) had
only one argument (filename). While testing, I assemble always to ram:, so
imagine my surprise when it refused to process the file just because I
copied it to ramdisk. (Accidentally the filename sounded exactly like
keyword of course). Usually in cases like this I suspect my fault and start
to debug - but then there were not really much to investigate; short code
with simple template. I started to check other commands and it seemed to me
I found a bug in Kickstart. That's the story - I knew how to deal with
this; I just wondered if the reaction of dos is normal. So thanks again you
let me now.

Encouraged by this positive response :) I'd like to ask someone to be a
betatester. I need to check one short routine on 060 processor; it would be
ideal for a candidate to owe an A1200 Apollo/060 but not necessarily. The
routine is a special, embedded version of access error traphandler I must
use in my program. As techies know 040 and 060 differ seriously when it
comes to exception stack frames, so I need to know whether my theoretically
developed approach (God bless Motorola for providing free manuals! If C=
has ever had a support like this... ;) actually works in hardware. So, are
there any volunteers?

Regards,
--

AmigaHeaven PD is to revolutionise the way Amiga PD is run. In
the past I have found a few good PD librarys but alot of the
programs they carry are old or out-of-date. This is not such a
bad thing but if you are always looking for the latest programs
then it can become a pain.

AmigaHeaven PD is aimed at people without a modem and access to
the great Aminet resource. We will ONLY be dealing in aminet pd
from the latest and most recent downloads (updated weekly) this
way you know you are getting the latest software and most of it
cannot be found in other PD librarys.

The price of each disk will be #1.50 including p&p and other
charges. You decide which programs/files you want upto 800k and
it will cost you no more than #1.50 you can ofcourse choose 
over 800k which will be spread across two disks and so on. Each
additional disk is also #1.50.

As well as the normal disk prices we also have some other offers
available. 

Order 10+ disks and choose 1 free (800k)
Order 25+ disks and choose 3 free (800k each)
Order 50+ disks and choose 10 free (800k each)

Single files over 800k will NOT be split and therefore can only

Report From Computer 98

Well, I've been there - and I really don't regret it!!!

Since still nobody else did, I'll give you a few infos about the press
conference - but there's no warranty all I'll mention is correct,
especially because the conference was not held in my native language.

(Btw: Since I'll have to write this quick, the result will be horrible
German-English; but I think you'll understand it anyway and since there's
no other report yet in this NG this seems to be better than nothing.)

Already just from having met the people of AI and the one of the two
QNX-presidents who was there as well has reassured me. I'm quite certain we
will get what we want.

The conference was delayed. It was planned to make one exclusive first for
the press, later the one for the public. But because of technical problems
with the demonstration - at least I suppose this was the reason - this
delayed. Therefore we were waiting
before the room.

Bill came out, said that it would be delayed, thanked us for our interest
and patience and said in return to the delay he would let come some drinks
for us: "Is this okay?" - Well, we didn't refused very much to accept
this... =)

Some time later he came again, said that it would delay a little bit more.
He told us that it was originally planned to have that separate exclusive
press-conference first, than the one for the public. So we sighed,
expecting that we would have to wait
even longer. But unexpectedly Bill offered that we could combine them,
making just one conference for all, because of the delay. He asked us just
to leave the first rows of seats in the room for the press. - Well, when
the doors finally opened some minute
later, and the crowd of Amiga-Fanatics stormed into the room, the "let
first
the press into the room" was no longer valid... :)

At the conference were Jeff, Allan, Bill and Darreck of AI and of course
Petro of AII. Additional there was one of the two presidents of QNX, but in
the beginning he was sitting in the auditorium.

In the auditorium was also someone from the german TV-channel ZDF.
Therefore
we can expect that the big news of the Amiga-QNX-cooperation will be
reported correctly by them.

At first Petro was speaking. The only new thing was that he confirmed that
AII will build further A4000T using the parts from Quikpak, Mr. Hembach
gave his okay. Petro said Mr.Hembach would be a nice guy, but the
auditorium made clear it thought different
about him... :) The Amiga-parts from Quikpak are currently shipping on the
ocean, he told us.

Then Bill spoke some introducing sentences and gave the word to Jeff, than
spoke Allan. Some details about OS3.5 and OS5 were told, but nothing really
new.

And then the big news - the OS-Kernel-partner is QNX. A murmur went through
the auditorium, many were disappointed in the beginning, because they did
not know QNX and had expected a better known company like Be or Sun. But
after the demonstrations they
were certainly all as convinced as I that QNX is the best possible choice.

Although it was already said in this NG that QNX is the partner and that
their homepage is www.qnx.com, nobody told you that they are big Amigans!
Many of their (IMHO 16) developers have an Amiga, and this even includes
both presidents of QNX. The
president told that the first computers he and his co-founder bought for
the
company (that was 1981) were PCs - but the first computers both they bought
for private use at home were A1000s!

He told us that he got due to the cooperation with AI spots of coffee in
their office - because when they told this to their employees and asked
them who of them would own an Amiga, some of them were currently standing
at the coffee-machine... =)

So you see we do not only have a very good Kernel-partner but even one who
knows the Amiga - and loves it and is therefore excited to cooperate with
AI for a comeback of Amiga. Corresponding were his words about Microsoft...
:) Again we were told at the
show that Amiga will be as much ahead the competitors when it's
re-introduced as it was the first time.

QNX architecture is very stable (as it has to, being even used in the Space
Shuttle; wouldn't like to see Windows installed there, if I were an
astronaut) and very compact. Those who were already on their homepage may
have found their demo disk - surf the
web not from HD but only from a small 1.44MB-disk. The disk was
demonstrated
as well.

The new AmigaOS microkernel will be QNX' "Neutrino". It is extremely
modular, so it fits the needs of AI's DC-plans: from settop-box to
workstation you'll have the same kernel core and add as much components as
needed for the specific device. Something
new in computing is their GUI "Photon" - it's the first microGUI. For
details please look at their Homepage.

They demonstrated QNX RTOS and the auditorium was impressed. Demonstrating
the abilities of the GUI, he showed us a window not only as used from it's
"front", but also from it's side - i.e. just a vertical line, because the
window was 2D, of course.

Then he demonstrated how a programm running in a window on one computer was
retargeted to another computer without any delay and easily back by
clicking on a button on the window-border for this purpose.

Also it was shown that the demo-programm was on both computers at the same
time, so that any action (for example mouse-movement to press a button in
this demo-program, a card-game) could be done from each computer.

Because of the QNX-architecture it is very easy to spread the tasks for
example of a Raytracer to many other computers to speed it up.

But most impressive was the following. He started Doom in a window and
moved
the window around while Doom was running without any impairments. No, this
wasn't what I meant to be impressive. Very impressive was what happened
when he moved the doom-window
to the right border of the screen: as much as it got beyond the
screenborder
of the first computer, it appeared at the left border of the second
computer's screen! So he moved the window from the one computer's screen
step by step on the other's one. Then
he drew it back a bit, so that the left half of the still running Doom was
on the one computer's screen, the other one on the other's.

After the conference we had half an hour to speak individually with Petro,
Jeff, Allan and the president of QWX (a very nice man, like the AI-crew).

Regarding the Sober Analysis-Thread it seems I were wrong. I thought the
OS-partner would be "BIG" in the meaning of well-known, rich and with
certain influence. (But the reality is much better in my opinion, too.) But
now it seems that the whole project
is really something AI has initiated, therefor I admit my speculations were
wrong. Looking at AI, QNX and - maybe - Transmeta, we have three small
companies that fit very good together, being "BIG" in quality but not in
quantity and complementing each
other.

I did not ask Jeff about my former speculation regarding AI may not be the
initiator of this project, because I talked to others before, and when I
came to Jeff again the time was already more than over and he was already
talking with a woman (I suppose
it was his wife) about other stuff, the computers were already removed and
I
was already the last user who was there, so I decided not to disturb him.
But looking at the facts as they are now, it's very likely this was
initiated by AI, especially being
aware that they were at first thinking about another OS-partner. Obviously
they heard about Transmeta (or whoever the MMC-maker is, but the details
and the time of the patent (because it was said they'll tell us MMC-maker's
name around this time, i.e. in
January) make it somewhat likely) due to their GW-relationship and found
later QNX; as they told due to the WOA-announcement - maybe due to it the
QNX-Amigans heard about AI and their plans and contacted them then.

Instead of this I asked the QNX-president about another topic - because
they
licence their technology to many third parties I wanted to know if it could
happen that they licence it to a competitor of AI as well or if Amiga would
have exclusive access to
their technology.

But now I notice that I didn't tell yet something about the very big
question that rose out of their cooperation: Why did they cooperate with AI
instead of doing it all at their own since they already have a running
RT-OS? What's their benefit? Well, AI's
work will mainly be to implement the APIs. As Jeff told us they'll use
standard APIs like OpenGL where standards are and that they'll implement
new ones where necessary - there he sees a chance for AI setting new
standards. The QNX-president told IMHO (I
did not understand all, and the bit I heard had still to be translated)
that
the reason why they cooperate with AI is that they want to concentrate on
their kernel, while AI has to make a full OS out of it for the DC-market.
QNX is small regarding
employees but of a good quality because they focus on this core and care
there about every detail, he told us.

And regarding the question if AI has to fear competition licencing the same
technology the president told me that he could not tell me more about this
topic due to contracts but he gave me the impression that this would not be
their aim - their licenced
partner for the market-segment of Digital Convergence is Amiga Inc.

All in all I have to say that I'm very satisfied with what I've heard and
seen at Cologne and that I'm sure AI do their work very well and therefore
will have a certain chance. Anyway I doubt very much that it will be easy
to be successful, because since
the partner is no "BIG" company in the definition I gave above it will be
harder to get a foot into the markets. And, to add this, I wouldn't count
that much on GW's money regarding this. After the official part of the
conference Jeff stressed again on
the question about the relationship GW-AI that GW keeps AI very separate;
GW
does it's PC-business, AI does it's Amiga-business.

So far about my memories of the press conference. Hope I could tell some
users a little bit new.

Subject: [just-amiga] Saving dirs?

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Does anyone know how you can save the list of files when you
'list' in cli? I need to save out the list of files with the sizes
so is it possible to save the list? otherwise it just goes shooting
off and you can't save it. Any ideas?

Kind Regards!

Greetings,

I bought AB3D when it hit the shelves all those moons ago. I completed
level 1, got totaly hammered everytime I tried level2 and the goddam
menu was buggy as hell. Crashed rather frequently. Oh yes.

Basically, I havn't touched it since. So, Is there a bunch of fixes
out there? I'd like to get my monies worth out of it one day 8)

Baring in mind I have a rather pathetic 030@40 and AGA, could someone
point me toward some good stuff that will make it a pleasure rather
than veritable torture to play...

Andy.

Subject: [just-amiga] I need some graphics! Help?

From: Wrecker98 <wrecker98@geocities.com>

Hi,
 There are about 150 of you on this mailing list, and I think at least one
of you fellow Amigians could help me.
 I am thinking of making a web site called Amiga Gamer. I already have 20mb
web space thanks to Fortune City, I have some HTML knowledge and all I need
is some quality graphics. I need your help!!
 Can you do graphics?? To start with I need a logo about 100x100 pixels in
size, in hi-res interlaced. I need it to say Amiga Gamer, orif you like you
can shorten Amiga Gamer to AG.
 I would be grateful if anyone can help me? If you can please EMail me
personally, with you ideas, name, and examples??

Thanks again,
-

Right i'm now up to £40 of donations including some of my money and
still looking for help, it would only take 20 more people sending £10
to raise enough money to beable to buy the site. You can send in
any major currency, just add a bit extra as they charge to convert
money, i'll get it changed. With Christmas around the corner see if
you have any spare change you can donate, the address is :-

Subject: [just-amiga] UK FREE INTERNET...

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Right, for those of you who havn't heard of this yet i'm just letting
you know the basics. In the UK you can now get a free internet
account. How it works...

Goto Dixons and ask for there free internet package
Goto a PC owning friend and setup the software, login etc.
Take the username and password from the account and
stick it into your Miami or whatever.

There you go a free internet account, no £10 a month internet
charge, you get email addresses and web space, an example
for just-amiga might be :-

Email : *@justamiga.freeserver.co.uk (* can be anything)
Web : www.justamiga.freeserver.co.uk

Simple, wondering how they make thier money? the helpline is
£1 a minuite, so aslong as you don't phone the helpline its
free internet.

Note : I take no responsibility for mis typed or errors,
incorrect information.

^^ thats just incase but it worked fine for me and others.

Kind Regards!

And it's not just this list. This was half the mail I got this morning...

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: fastboot, get it now, I mean it!

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

> Everyone: goto the aminet and download fastboot.lha NOW!!!

> It is amazing!!! It cut my boot time from 50 seconds down to 5 !! and
> it worked first time. I urge you to all at least try it, it's the best
> piece of software I have

   Ok, I've had a look at the contents of fastboot archive, and it seems
to be a simple extention of the action replay's save state command.

   I will definatly NOT be using this on my amiga, I know how unstable
these hacks can be. The author even give a riminder to refresh your
memory grab every time you add/remove new hardware (like if I disable my
PPC board with "2") or your harddrive'll get trashed. 

   Anyway, my bootup time is only 30 seconds.

   If you have a stable amiga config, and arn't likely to change
anything on the fly, then it /should/ be safe to use this.

See ya.

Subject: [just-amiga] Who wants to port a full 386 emu. (in C) that runs win95?

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   C'mon guys, I have the source of a full 386 emulator in C. It can run
win95 etc.

   I can't do a port myself, but I'm sure there's someone out there who can
do a PPC/68k port of it.

   So, if anyone wants the source then I have a copy, just ask ;)

See ya.

IIRC someone on another list mentioned that FCI's cable had been damaged or
something like that. I think it's just gone down rather than gone away.

Just a quick note to say (1) thanks to Jens for his work on the editor,
please accept my apologies for not sending you an email before, I've been
meaning to for ages. I've used the original, your versions 2.01, 2.13 and to
a lesser extent the 3.xx ones, which brings me to (2)...

I have very nearly completed a full 16 level replacement game for AB3D2
including such delights as a mini rocket launcher that doesn't block your
view (killing wasps in confined spaces with this is actually fun!), a flare
laser to light up dark areas, my fave monsters from AB3D1, some new aliens
and game features not exploited in the original, and an OTT 
going-insane-with-terror story line...

I'm doing a final (hopefully) play through now and hope to have the archive
on Aminet in time for Christmas :)

Regards

Mike Child

PS. If anyone happens to know how to change the text of the end game scrolly
(which must be embedded in the executable and packed) then please let me
know!

I think they can indeed make a G3 dual or quad board fairly fast, since they
have already done all the hard work. They already have a complete system
ready for more CPU's, so that shouldn't pose a big problem.

I do however have a few problems with Escena's board (am I the only one who
have never heard of that company? And did people really expect me to not
have something to say about this board? :-). The first rather big problem is
that it is a ZIII board, that means it won't be able to get full access to
the hardware. If it was a CPU slot board instead it would. But that would
cause problems, since it would be pretty hard to boot without a real 68k, at
least without too much hacking. So from that POV it makes sense to make it a
ZIII board.

The next problem I have with it is that it dosen't have any local
diskcontrollers or expansion buses. Everything happens across the ZIII bus.

So what we have is a very simple board compared to the PowerUp's. It is
bascially just two G3's, a bunch of memory, and a ZIII interface. This means
four things: It should be cheaper than the PowerUp's, it should be lightning
fast, it should crawl on disk I/O and gfx operations, and it won't be as
compatible.

The fact that there is a clean PPC system, complete with L2 cache, SDRAM
etc., means that the PPC's will be able to run at full speed, as long as
they use the local RAM. So this board will be able to render Quake screens
at blazing speed. The problem is that you won't be able to take advantage of
the high speed, as the ZIII bus limits the gfx speed. Same problem with disk
I/O.

Compared to this the PowerUp's are much more complex with their 68k/PPC
multiprocessing, onboard gfx bus and onboard SCSI controller. So for
normal system usage that includes lots of gfx output and disk I/O a PowerUp
board will probably have the edge, since it dosen't use the Zorro bus for
anything really speedcritical. Add to that that the PowerUp will run any 68k
programs without any
problems, and that the board has full control over the machine.

The Escena board on the other hand will be a killer rendering engine. Just
throw all your data etc. into the local RAM and let the PPC's do their job.
But don't expect it to have the same general improvements as the PowerUp
range.

I would say that the PowerUp boards are a much more impressive system due to
the way it interfaces to the existing machine and because of the extras it
provides. The Escena board OTOH seems more like a PPC reference design glued
onto a ZIII board.

Hi DCWILSON99@aol.com,

> all I got from this website was a graphic :(

The site isn't online yet :)

There are only two pages, the title page (probably the one you tried?)
and the update page:

http://www.mystcorp.com/update-081198.html

The title page doesn'tlink to this page.


All the best...

Hi Chris,

I thought AIO was supposed to be informed :)
 
We're the leading developers of children's software for the Amiga. 
Full details about our product and the plan for the coming year for
our Made For KiDS campaign will be made available when the new website
is released so keep them eyes open ;)

All the best...

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,


> Btw, there is a portable PC-emulator available, anyone? It runs in X
but I
> guess it would be easy to port it to use Intuition. I just can't
recall
> the damn emulator name.. 

   A quick look through EmuNews links and I think I've found it:

http://www.bochs.com/

"What is Bochs? 
Bochs is a portable x86 PC emulation software package that emulates
enough of the x86 CPU, related AT hardware, and BIOS to run DOS, Windows
'95, Minix 2.0, and other OS's, all on your workstation."

   So, what are we waiting for?

   Every one should now go straight to there homepage and ask for an
Amiga version, or volenteer to compile one yourself!

  It could at least be a stop-gap until PPC versions of PC-Task and PCx,
maybe even better, although its only 386 emulator w/ VGA.


   There is also Softwindows and RealPC (PowerMac versions) which
probably /could/ be ported to Amiga, but I doubt they would.
   (Could be used with a PPC PowerMac emulator though)

If everybody emails them asking for an Amiga Version, then who knows ;)
  http://www.insignia.com/SoftWindows/



   So, any good programers want to have a go at porting Bochs?


See ya.

I think that now a lot more people are accepting that the Classic is pretty
much a very dead end. AI don't care any more, development is slowly grinding
to a halt, and there isn't really much hope for revival.

Personally I'll stick with my Amiga until something truely better turns up.
I'll probably install Linux on both my machines, run my modem through the PC
running Linux (because it's got a faster serial port than my miggy), and run
my miggy through that...

Anyone want to provide some tips on how to actually impliment that? :)

Regards

Tom

If it's worth anything to you, I've used it for the past one and a half
years with no problems what so ever!

Could, possibly, in the worst event scenario, trash your HD. But the chances
of this happening are as big as you winning the lottery. =)

The worst thing that has ever happened to me is that a system partion went invalidated and at the time I was doing some pretty serious hacking inside my
computer. Anyway, It's not documented, but if Fastboot detects something
different it doesn't boot the computer at all, it just stands there. If this
happens, you just Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga it and hold down any mouse button to
start WB as if though FastBoot never was installed. 

What can I say, the program rules!

>   Anyway, my bootup time is only 30 seconds.

I just figured out a way to squeeze another 3 seconds of my boot-up. Now it
only takes 3 seconds to boot my amiga.

One Warning though. Do not attempt to install this program if you don't know
your way around DOS-scripts. And don't be calling a friend that knows all
about Amiga to install it for you, you're gonna need him at your house a lot
the first week. 

And one more last thing. Don't put "execut s:grab.com", or whatever you
choose to name the command it uses to grab memmory, in startup-sequence.
Execute it from the menu "Workbench/Execute command" instead after all disk
activity has stopped and you should have no probs!

Lo there,

I know you'll probably be annoyed at the cross post, but It's worth
it.

Everyone: goto the aminet and download fastboot.lha NOW!!!

It is amazing!!! It cut my boot time from 50 seconds down to 5 !! and
it worked first time. I urge you to all at least try it, it's the best
piece of software I have

If you need help, just ask :))

again, sorry 'bout the cross post

on irc etc. Wouldn't it be good to have free evening local calls
and free local weekend calls? America and Japan have had them
for years and we have been charged great amounts of money.

Help get free calls by visiting :-

*www.unmetered.org*

and sign your name up in the petition for free local calls.

Please spread this message far and wide.

P.s. Does anyone know the address for Oftel, the government
organisation that regulates telephone companys, the b'stards
that won't let us have free calls, I would be interested in
writing to them if anyones got the address.

Kind Regards!

Yes, I believe that Neil is considering setting up a replacement on
a different server as the current "problems" seem to be related to
the current provider. I've no idea what's causing the problem though.

Yeah, me too.  It seemed to go quieter than normal a few days ago, and now
it's completely gone :(

Don't suppose there's much point in looking at the status on the CU
website any more :(

Anyone mailed Eden Akhavi yet?

Well there are quite litle difference in the sizes of MPEG-II compared to
MPEG-III but the CPU power required for the layer 3 decoding is bigger than
the size difference. So if you have slower machine I recommend using layer
2 MPEGs. Oh and my machine will do layer 2 mpeg in the time of 3*n where
the n is the length of the song. :) So its much faster than anything else.
Oh and it supports batching so just read CD to HD and let it roll. :)

From: "Andy Kinsella" <andy.k2@ukonline.co.uk>

Greetings;

I'd normally throw my technical questions into the cu-list, but it
seems to be buggered atm 8)

Can I add multiple filters to a folder in 0.198 of Microdot? I want to
filter a folder so that two pepes mail gets shuffles into it.
currently it's filtered with "#?@q#?, but one of the guys keeps
pissing around with his email address Grrr...(you know who you are!)

Anyways, I thought something like "#?(#?|ross#?|#?oondy#?)" would do
the business, but when I did that, my md kept jamming on random mails,
prolly wondering where to put stuff...So I changed it back to what it
was, and all is well, apart from one geezers mail not landing in the
right box.

Any clues? An update is in order meethinks 8)

Andy.

That wildcard would match everything, since it's "#?(#?|...|...)".

The DB9 goes to the Amiga RGB, and the HD15 is a VGA style monitor
connector. The DB9 allows Amiga display modes to be passed through
to the monitor (assuming it will work with whatever Amiga mode you're
using) without swapping cables.

It seems not :-)



An email from Andrew korn,

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I would like to invite you to join the cu-list mailing list.

The description of this mailing list is:

The current incarnation of CU-list, the CU Amiga magazine mailing list. Of
course there is no CU-Amiga magazine anymore, but CU-List remains a meeting
place for ex readers of CU to shoot the breeze with each other and various ex
CU-Amiga staff. There will also be some interesting hints and announcements...
;^) 

You can join this list by going to the following web page:

     #http://www.onelist.com/subscribe.cgi/cu-list#

If you do not wish to join this list, please ignore this message.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++



The mailing list address has just changed after recent problems with the
last server, that is all :-)



Regards,

Bill.

IIRC you just put a comma (,) between the addresses.

eg. bill@gates.net, mr@big.man.com

Subject: [just-amiga] C question

From: Mark Tierno <drstrange@usa.net>

SAS/C C/C++ question here.
Is there a SAS/C or DOS function that allows you toc ount the number of
lines in a file (ie: number of carriage returns)?  If so, is there also
another function that will allow you to start reading from a specified line
number (instead of byte count) of a file?  If so, it's make a little
program I have in mind a bit easier.
  Thanx in advance.
  -DrStrange

Later.

Nor this.  The signup procedure can be completed on an Amiga, with
Miami or whatever.  I won't bother repeating the instructions here,
so take a look at:

   http://www.amiga.de/diary/1998/981118.html

Simple enough.  Worked fine for me.

They also take a cut from the calls to the 0845 dialup number, seeing
as it's provided by one of the new Telco companies (ie not BT).

FYI, Freeserve now fully support V.90 and offer 15Mb free webspace (it was
5Mb).

What type of Zip Drive is it?  Is it parralel, or SCSI, as if it's a
parallel drive I think you'll run into some problems trying to run it on the
miggy..

No chance... £40 will just about cover my debt once I get my phone bill :(

Are you sure you can't get the name cheaper? Why not go for something like a
V3 URL? If you're after a free, easy to remember URL, you have these to
choose from (off the top if my head):

http://welcome.to/aio
http://surf.to/aio
http://come.to/aio
http://fly.to/aio
http://aio.amiga.tm/
http://aio.amiga.to/

aio can be anything you want, and you can get them at http://come.to/ and
http://www.amiga.tm/, and that's how I got my URL http://surf.to/amisite

To be honest, I can't see a domain name making AIO more populour - a V3 URL
is £243 UKP cheaper, as easy, if not easier to remember, and then you have
£40 with which to buy review material etc.

To get it free, you do have to have a banner on your site (what I do), have
a redirection page diplayed every so often, with an ad on, or something else
I can't remember right now.

If you don't want any of that, £10 p.a. will pay for the URL, at least at
come.to.

Regards

Tom

Oftel are not preventing free local calls - they are keeping BT's prices
high, but anyone else who wants to can provide free calls.

The thing is, the current system is set up for metered calls - ISP's get
money off telecos for providing business, take that away and a lot of ISP's
would go down the tubes.

BT only promise speeds of 9,600 bps...

What do you mean by "use graphics on my Amiga"? Please be more specific.

As for the ZIP drive, buy another (SCSI) ZIP for the miggy, and get
CrossMAC from Consultron. Works like a charm. You can format the
"exchange" ZIPs on the MAC and use them on the miggy as well.

I'm sorry I meant to get a program to get graphics from the internet.

All you have to do is connect to the aminet with some PC or Mac
ftp software depending on what computer your using. Copy the
file to a 720k (I think thats the size?!) disk and then bung it
into your amiga and mount pc0: or pc1: whichever suits.

Why are they keeping BT's prices high? anyway I don't use BT because
they are are a slightly over priced company, I'm now using Cable&
Wireless. If your telling me that they are allowed to offer free local
calls then why hasn't anyone written to them as they are probably the
second biggest phone company in the UK or at least England at the
moment.

I'd rather see a few isps go down than see my bank balance go down :)
We pay 'standing charge' each month so that could have a cut to the
isps, they could charge like £20 a month and your local calls are free,
that way phone companys make a reasonable profit and isps can
stay secure, plus the biggest bonus is customers are happy with a
service.

BT are still using copper wire phone lines.

You need to be more specific, how do you mean use graphics? do you
mean a prograam to view them, convert them, edit them, apply effects
to them......?
I'm guessing that you've never heard of the aminet. It's the world's
largest collection of free software for any computer, but it's only
for amiga :)) I'm not sure of the address, have a look for aminet.
There are many many mirrors out there.

What type of zip drive is it? parralel, scsi, ide ?

In that case then, it should be easy.  Once you have the zip drive connected
to a SCSI interface, download Zip Tools from aminet (youll have to do a
search for the freeware version) and then format a disk via that.

'Twas the night before 28-Nov-98, and all through the net,
 not a creature was stirring, except for Mattias, who whispered ominously:

>Well, I built an interface for the parralel drive with great success. Easy
>to make and works just fine. Search on Aminet for it.

I searched (not because I need it, I'm just curious <g>) and found a file
with some stuff created by someone in New Zealand. Haven't looked at it
yet but unless you moved and changed your name I guess that's someone
else's work...
How about being a bit less cryptic and just giving us the path/filename?
"Search for it on Aminet" is a bit like saying you live somewhere downtown...
