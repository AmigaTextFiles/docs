On this site, there should also be a set of html and man pages, outlining all 
OpenGL function. I use these as a reference most of the time...

Uh, they are projected with exactly the same functions as anything else, so 
this sounds very strange... Do you have a small test case that demonstrates 
that, or can you make a screen shot ?

If you're using glVertex4f, the w component is the homogenous w. Before using 
a homogenous vector, x, y, z and w are devided by w (resulting in w == 1). 
This w is not used for texture mapping. In full OpenGL, you could use 
glTexCoord4f, but that's not yet in MiniGL... at least not in the version on 
our web page.

Hmm, this should work. Fog coordinates are given in world coordinates, so 1.0 
or 0.0 shouldn't make any difference at all because normally, your z range is 
much higher...

Hi All,

I have a couple of problems with fogging in mgl.

Quads that run a long distance along the z axis seem to be fogged wrongly.
Some are fogged too much at the front and too little at the back; others the
other way round. 
I`m using glVertex3F(). Should I be using glVertex4f(). If so, how do I
calculate the w value?

The other problem is that I can`t get the fog to start near enough. I`d like
fogging to start right at the front of the screen. If I set fog start to a
value <= 1.0 I loose all fogging.

Any help appreciated.


BTW Thanks to all who answered my question on GL documentation. I found a load
of html autodoc style things at:

--BOUNDARY.1714620256.2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-2

Hello,

    I tried to display a fullscreen picture (or a clipart) using warp3d.
I decided to use a set of smaller textures tiled on the screen.
. It worked, but a not everything. When drawing a tile i should 
 calculate a coords this way:

for (column=0;column<columns;column++)
{
   for (row=0;row<rows;row++)
   {
     x1=row*tilesize;
     y1=column*tilesize;
     x2=(row+1)*tilesize-1;
     y2=(row+1)*tilesize;
 
     u1=0;
     v1=0;
     v1=tilesize-1;
     v2=tilesize=1;

     drawit
   }
}

 But when using this I get a grid (not painted pixels) on the screen.
 I managed to get rid of this by eliminating -1's. But now the image with
 for example narrow horizontal/vertical lines is a bit distorted and 
 sometimes some lines disapear. How can I get rid of this?

 I thought that it's because when drawing transparent faces GFX chip 
 have to cut a one pixel from the right to eliminate everleaping faces
 (its it done this way?) so this is from the grid comes. But When
 a tile is even 0% transparent (blending disabled) this grid apears.
 

 Because this code is quite small I decoded to post it here. Hope You could
 help me. 

PS. In version with scaling possibility I also get some distortions where
 tiles join (looks like texture is wraping).

Regards.

    Do You mean face color alpha, or texture alpha?

    I have also noticed some problems with fogging and additive blending.
 But for now I hadn't time to investigate this (probably another bug in my
  engine)

    Yes, I have seen this. But I have found a strange behaviour. In new
 warp4.2 You can't disable dithering. I had it disabled all the time
 and after instalation of new driver it was turned on.

Yeah, that additive blending can add a lot of atmosphere :)

The alpha value you give in the vertex structure... the texture alpha isn't 
interpolated, anyway...

Uh, it should work with fogging. It did with Heretic 2... Can you send me a 
screenshot of this effect ?

Nothing's changed with the dithering... very strange... I'll check it out.

You need to subtract 0.5 from the width and height, i.e. instead of using 
width-1 you should use width-0.5. This is a common problem, also on DirectX 
and openGL...

The same applies here...

Oups, you already have a cgxpermedia2.resource ? I thought it wasn't released

The reason for this code is to find Permedia 2 boards plugged into the G-REX. 
This doesn't work yet, but as the resource wasn't supposed to be out yet....

Hello,

I recently installed the new V4.2, to use the new HetericII patch. But after
the installation Warp3D did not worked.
Every time, I started a warp3D program, my ramlib crashed with "illegal
instruction" exception. I used SnoopDos, to look, what's wrong. The last
thing, that was done by ramlib, was "GetRes cgxpermedia2.resource". But
that was promted as "OK". 
Warp3D V4.0 worked flawless. Tried to switch from 60ns RAM to 70ns, but no
effect. CGX is set to "USESEMAPHORES" and "BITMAPCACHE".
Config:

BlizzardPPC, BVision
cgx V42 Release 2 Pre 10
powerpc.library 16.0

Any hints?

Ah, no, you misunderstood me. You need to substract from v1 and v2, i.e.

     v1=tilesize-0.5;
     v2=tilesize-0.5;

Here it is. The error is surely mine but I don`t know what. It`s probably
related to the fact that I have to put the z coords in the negative range to
see any drawing.

I`ve now got it to work with fogging values below 1.0 but I still cant get the

No I don't think it's done that way. Since 3D hardware renders with subpixel
accuracy there is no overlaping.

Consider two triangles that share one edge. If the x value of that edge at
one scanline is for example 10.3 the triangle to the left will render 'till
x = 10 and the triangle to the right will start rendering at x = 11. 

So only pixels that are "inside" the triangle gets drawn, since a pixel only
can be at one side of an edge it will only get drawn for one of the
triangles that share the edge. 

Hmm I hope that makes some sense :) if not, have a look at this article.

I suspect that the surfaces in question are very close together. The problem 
then is that the ZBuffer is not a floating point buffer but an integer 
buffer. Although the Z range of [0..1] is scaled to the interval [0...327676] 
or [0..65535] there is still a quantization effect, more so since most of the 
time Z coordinates tend to "cluster", that is, they tend to only use a 
fraction of the actual zbuffer range... The reason for this is that most of 
the time you will be using the untransformed Z from camera space to save 
yourself the hassle of transforming Z beyond clip space.

The result of this is that you get jagged "saw-tooth" edges where surfaces 
penetrate each other.

There are two possible solutions for this problem, depending on the 
environment you're using.

Under MiniGL, use a smaller depth range. When you specify the front and back 
clip plane, use values that are closer together. This spreads the surfaces in 
Z space.

Under Warp3D directly (i.e. if you have direct access to the W3D_Vertex 
structure) you can use a different Z value. One possible course of action is 
to directly use the w value for the z value and reverse the ZCompare 
function, i.e. instead of e.g. Z_LESS use Z_GEQUAL. 
Alternatively you can use different Z calculation. The difference between W 
and Z is that usually W is linear while Z is not, so what you could do is do 
your perspective divide for Z too, thus making it linear. This counters the 
above mentioned clustering of Z values, making it less prone to the 
inaccuracies...

I hope this helps.

Hi,

    Does V3 can handle nonrectangular textures?

    And one question about it's speed. Is it really 
 that much faster than Permedia? I'm asking because
 recently I wrote a small intro that displays 20 spinning
 additive fullscreen planes and it was SLOOOW (10fps?).
 Is it going to be faster on V3? And How much?

BTW. Have anyone on this list (Frieden bros?) seen
 my demo from ASM01? On permedia it was quite slow
 in some parts (slower than in others;). How was is on V3?

PS. I don't know if I made this clear in my last response: From a programmers 
point of view you do not need to take care of the aspect ratio of textures - 
the driver will do that automatically. Of course you will get a (slight) 
performance hit when you use out-of-aspect textures, therefore its worth 
mentioning.

I think it was SPECIAL 73 in the Fd2Pragma that comes with StormGCC. I can't

Yes, to a certain degree. All Warp3D drivers up to now support it, but the 
Permedia2 is the only chip that fully implements it. The Voodoo has some 
trouble, since it requires textures to adhere to certain aspect ratios (8x1, 
4x1, 1x1, 1x4 and 1x8).

This essentially means that a 16x2 texture works, but a 32x2 texture doesn't 
and needs to be software emulated by replicating the image.

Yes, it's generally vastly superior to the Permedia2. In your case, this 
means that there is alpha blending and fill rate involved. Alpha blending 
requires a framebuffer readback per pixel. In the P2's case this slows down 
the chip to 50%. The Voodoo's fill rate is much higher. If you want you can 
send me that demo and I will run it on the voodoo.

hey, excellent demo! :) I just downloaded it & watched. great design, I like it. pity it is slow (on my bog-slow 166mhz) but anyway it works great.

I suppose it does not support Warp3D, right? because some textures looks "blocky" when are close to the "camera"...

    This version was quite slow, because of some engine bugs. In some
 days we will release fixed version. Especialy particles will be about
 3-4 times faster (VERY nasty bug). Also MP3 replayer is "quite" slow.

    Some cliparts are bugged, but its only my fault. Only textures
 without bilinear filtering are in tunels part, but it was done by
 purpose. Bilineared looked much worse. And yes, it's Warp3D.

    Yep, that's this one. But I don't know wht there was no sound.
 I will have to check it out because mp3 player was quite buggy
 (but it worked at all amigas I heard about).

 But how do You like it? ;)

Hi all,

I still haven`t sorted out the fogging error in my current project. Enclosed
is a screenshot of the problem. The two "seperate" quads are infact in the
same plane and next to each other but one is longer than the other. I still do
not know why there should be a difference in the amount of fogging on them. 
I sent the source code a while back. 

Any ideas welcome.
Thx in advance.
