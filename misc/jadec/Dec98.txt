G'day Everyone and Seasons greetings,
                                                                 I have a
delema. Can any one set me in the right direction to formating an IDE HD so
that I can read it on PC and Amiga ? Ive set up the drive in HD tool box as
a custom MS dos filing system . When I reboot I get no Icons ? Thats where
I come unstuck. Do I have to tell CrossDos via a Dosdriver at startup that
its there ?

Please help.

Kind regards

Well use Miami (will shut down after 30 mins) as your TCP software and YAM
as your mailer and IBrowse demo version all this is free from Aminet. And
is bloody good as well also you will need MUI as well with this stuff.

Once you have all this up and running Pay for it (except YAM which is
free) This is all good software and the blokes deserve being paid for it

                  Cheers all the best

Hi!

They are keeping BT's prices high because otherwise BT would make them
really low and kill all competition - they were actually talking about
making all national calls free, but Oftel stopped it because it was
anti-competetive.

C&W used to offer free local calls, but apparantly they stopped because they
weren't making enough money.

BTW - can you give a short run down on C&W's pricing structure? I want to
know if it's worth switching...

Economists, the Government, ISP's and I would disagree.

Then ISP's find tens of thousands of people staying online 24/7, doing very
little, taking up a phone line, and more people=more bandwidth used, meaning
they have to invest in more modem racks, more phone lines, and more high
speed connections to other ISP's, lest their service go through the floor.

ISP's like FreeServ and Free Online immediately die, along with many other
marginal ISP's (of which there are many; ISP's don't make a lot of
money...), because they are no longer getting money from telecos, and they
cannot afford the high cost of upgrading their already stressed network.

If a lot of ISP's go down, other ISP's have to invest more, because many of
their network links will be peering to these smaller ISP's, further
increasing costs and decreasing the quality of service.

Alternatively, telecos can charge by the minute, ISP's get their money,
people actually hang up and stop eating so much bandwidth, and everyone
remains pretty happy.

Which do you think is most likely?

>> BT only promise speeds of 9,600 bps...
>> 
> BT are still using copper wire phone lines.

BT only promise speeds of 9,600 bps - if they provide that, then they have
fulfilled their service.... I get connections of 50667, and I'm happy :)

Regards

Tom

Easy, the other share holder of FreeServ is Engises (Which uses
the electricity power line across UK land scape for phone calles). 
You probley call a Engsis number now when log on, Demon use them as
well U-Net and most of the other ISP in UK.

Yep you guess it , there is money in that small  amount when you dail
them to log on (30 days re-log on or you off isn't there for no
reall reasion)

I have NEVER paid for a local call here in America in my 40 plus years.

Hi Thomas,

Except that they're not all happy.

The current system sucks, if the average Joe would just take a look round
them and see the possibilities we'd have fibre-optic cables running into
every home within a year.

Think of it, no bandwidth problems, you could download aminet in just a few
hours, you could REALLY use digital TV in the way it was meant to be used,
video-phones would actually become incredibly useful, you could collaborate
on projects with people from the other side of the globe (you can already,
to a reasonable extent, but there's so much more that could be done) etc.
etc.

What has this got to do with phones?  Simple, this is what the telecos would
be extending their services to if they got the chance, but too many people
are bored by technology for this to happen anytime soon, it takes years for
things to filter through people's closed-minded brains. :(  (All this
technology is old news now).

Ah, well...  gues I'll just have to win the lottery and buy a satellite or
summat...  alternatively, anyone know the address of a badly guarded bank?
<grin> :)

All the best...

the three browsers on the Amiga just don't " cut the mustard"

I think therfore I cock up.????

I may have the url wrong, no time to check but you get the general
Idea.


Windows 95: 32 bit extensions and a graphical shell for a 16 bit patch to an
8 bit operating system originally coded for a 4 bit microprocessor, written
by a 2 bit company that can't stand 1 bit of competition.

The telco's do have a problem with fast-changing technology.  Most telco
equipment is spec'ed to have a 50 year life. There's $billions invested
in exchange equipment and cables - replacing it all with newer stuff
before its planned lifetime is up ruins their business plans...

I used to have a friend who's father was the manager of a bank with a
thatched roof - that presented fairly unique security problems ;-)

There should be an announcement on the Opera Software site in
the next day or so.

The last you heard was rather a long time ago then ;-)

Work was put on hold a couple of months ago, due to the poor
state of the Amiga market.

The state of the Amiga market, I feel, can be put down to one thing,
and one thing only ------ THE INTERNET !!!!!!!!!!!!


Let Me explain :-
How many of us got "Webbed up", only to find ourselves in a silent
world, downloading stuff that can't be used, or run on our beloved
machines ---- Rm, and Ra files, the newer Avi codecs to name a few.
I have some Mpeg video files that I d/loaded a while back, that, when
I try to play, open a window that says "this is not an mpg video
stream" when it obviously *IS* (it played O.K. on the PC at work)
We have been left behind for too long --- hopefuly, Opera will go some
way to re - dress this imbalance (From what I've just read about it,
albeit in a PC mag. It has "The Gates of hell" and Netscape "shotting"
themselves --- Opera's that good !!! Well worth a fiver, or maybe 
/even/ a Tenner!!!!!!! :-)

Least of all me, with my phone bill that exceeds my income :(

Exactly - the solution isn't to complain about how expensive the phone
system is (even if it is...), but to just stop using phone lines for a
purpurse they were never designed for...

Think of it; all the bandwidth problems of downloading all of Aminet - it's
bad enough when everyone has 4K/sec, once everyone has 250k/sec, well...

Of course, outlawing spam would get rid of this problem ;)

Well, if you do, save some money for me, I'm seriously running short :(((

Subject: [just-amiga] DKB 3128 Memory board.

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>


Does anyone have a DKB 3128 memory board that they want to sell,
I have an A4000 desktop that is crying out for more memory.

I have tried everywhere for one, but they are as rare as duck teeth.
The only one I found, they wanted $250 US,  $400 AUD  for it.
With 'No' memory.....

If anyone has one that they would sell for a 'reasonable' price,
could you please email me privately....

Or if anyone knows how to just add another 64 megs of memory 
to an A4000 desktop,  by any other method,  please let me know.

Thanks for your time....

I seriously doubt this, BT prices have been high from the start and the
point that BT want to charge low calls really doesn't wash with me, I
mean have you seen their adverts, "come back to BT for 9.99" they
are obviously running scared and now they EXPECT you to pay to
come back?! whoever thought that idea up must be a dollymixture short
of a quarter.

>

That was when they first started out and the whole country didn't have
access to them, now I think it would be more possible.

> 
> BTW - can you give a short run down on C&W's pricing structure? I want
to

Well the calls are all cheaper than BT's by about 1p depending on
what type of call it is, local calls are just under 1p I think, and until
december you can call all staurday for 50p long distance, this has
been put forwards every 3 months so its likely to be extended
again. All you do is call your internets provider long distance number
and stay on all saturday.

> Economists, the Government, ISP's and I would disagree.

Maybe, but I am sure I would like free calls, if America can do it
why can't we? as someone said in the other email in australia they
have to pay for 1 call as long as they want. Something similar wouldn't
go amiss.

Not exactly, just free evening local calls and weekend not daytime,
everyone
would be happy. £10 a month what most ISP's charge is quite a big sum
also,
I can't honestly see the world ending just because we get some free local
calls.

People don't really remain happy to be honest, I'm not really
sure where you have been living for the past 20 years but i'm
sure alot of people would like to see free local phone calls. The
internet is meant to be a place you can do what you want and
find what you want, not checking the clock every second to see if
your over your limit or can't afford anymore.

If ISDN and other methods where implanted then we could all
get fast connections, its really up to the phone companys no
matter what they say.

Matter closed :)

Kind Regards!

Greetings, Chris.

I dont know how many people know the reason that America doesn't charge
for local calls - so here's an explanation (simplified a bit)...

Once upon a time, telephone changes used electromechanical switches.
These were expensive to build. The charging circuits were also electromechanical,
and expensive to build and to read (needed a man with a clipboard).

While the British and other European state owned phone companies paid for
these on local exchanges (it wasn't their money they were spending after all)
the American phone companies (i.e. Bell) decided it wasn't economic for
local calls, and the charging circuits would only be fitted to trunk exchanges
(i.e. for long distance calls).

Of course, times change. The exchanges are now electronic, and the charging
is calculated by computer. There is no difference in the calculations between
types of calls. The American companies (now Bell is split up) would love to
introduce local charges (they do charge for them in the form of line rental).

In the UK data calls (i.e. calls to ISPs) have overtaken voice calls.
Few people would use a voice circuit for hours at a time, but lots of
people would use a data circuit for as long as it is free (or capped).
Not even BT can afford to offer free calls (if local calls to ISPs
were free, most people would use Internet Phones for long distance
voice calls, and BT wouldn't earn a penny).

If you use the various discount schemes, it is possible to get the weekend
charges down to under 50p an hour. Once the price dropped to less than the
cost of the can of beer I drink while I'm on-line I stopped worrying about
the cost of calls.

ISDN in the UK is too expensive (I have an ISDN line, and I have no
problem with the cost of calls, but the line rental is too high).
Personally I'd prefer a system where there was no line rental, but
charges for all calls. People who don't use their phone much wouldn't
pay much, people who use their phone a lot would. Seems fairer to me.

Whoops :-/

ISP's work on tiny margins - £10 a month isn't much for getting 20MB of web
space, using expensive high bandwidth lines. Without kickbacks from telecos
many marginal ISP's would go down the tubes and the rest would charge more
because of the xtra investment in bandwidth they would need

Being into IRC and online Quake while having next to no money, believe me, I
want unmetered calls to, it's just unlikely to happen.

Oh, and 20 years ago I wasn't living at all :)

Each ISDN line costs the same for call charges as normal calls, with higher
rental charges.

> Matter closed :)

I think not :)

'course, you're the list admin, so if that's what you want...

From: "SCUBIDU" <scubidu@netcomuk.co.uk>

Just a *LITTLE* query (:-)) I would like to ask :-
What, with all the talk regarding free internet access, and stuff, I
was wondering (in one of My sad Bas*%ard moments) just what would it
entail to start up an ISP? I have always imagined an "ISP" to be just
a big room, full of hard drives connected to each other, and all
connected up to a load of phone lines, but realise it can't be *THAT*
simple.

Anyone care to enlighten Me ?

I don't know where you guys get your info from, but local calls in the US
are NOT free... We have to pay twenty-five cents per call also. We find
this out everytime the bill comes in.....

Hmmmm, thats interesting because in Australia we are under the 
same impression that you only pay for toll calls in the U.S. 
& that local calls are free.

How about the costs at a phone box versus a private (domestic) service.  

In Australia it is a bit of a rip-off, 
because it is 25c on a private phone, but you need 40c for a phone box.

"They" say it is to cover maintainance....   

Yehhh.....And I like Microsoft....... Pigs Bum.!!!!!

Big deal - spending 8 hours online in the US will still cost you 25 cents,
but in the UK on weekends that will cost UKP4.80.

In general discussion I think free calls=unmetered calls - i.e. a one off
connection charge.

If you have two telephone lines, you can call your ISP on one of them and
then someone else can call you on your other line. If you then have the
appropriate software you could act as that person's ISP.

So somebody is providing your ISP, and whoever that is also has an ISP (or
many). This chain goes all the way back to the arpa computers in the american
defense, BUT (and this is what confuses people about what an isp really is)
if arpanet goes down, you would still have access to the rest of the
internet.

Subject: [just-amiga] System Partition

From: gerald.hobbs@wago.de

     
     After many years on my Amigas, - am at last moving over from being a 
     multiple floppy drive user (only on the Amiga makes this possible!) to 
     a multiple SCSI hard drive user (WB 3.1). 
     
     Precautions I am considering include the plan to keep the system 
     partition backed up both to floppies and to a "mirror" system 
     partition on another SCSI hard drive.
     
     Of course this will be as well as my doing file backups - to a 
     partition on a separate hard disk - even SCSI hds can be had on the 
     cheap now ;-).
     
     The "mirror" system partition will have a different partition name to 
     the usual boot partition.
     I thought of making the "mirror" bootable but with a lower priority:
     Boot priority of the usual partition is 2, and of "mirror" will be 1.
     
     The problem is what to name the "mirror" VOLUME.
     I have tried giving it the SAME volume name, <OS>, as the normal 
     system partition.
     
     However this causes me confusion because it generates two icons 
     labelled OS.
     Should I differentiate between them in some way?
     
     Also Dopus4 has been confused and has produced a listing according to 
     the wrong OS partition selected.
     
     Alternatively I could give them DIFFERENT VOLUME names, but might this 
     not void all the paths set up -- for running software installed on the 
     various OTHER partitions, and so preventing them from working in 
     association with the "mirror" -> on "that day" the usual system 
     partition gets garbled :-(  ???
     
     Can anybody give me the benefit of their experience please?
     
     Gerald.  (of Devon)

   Don't bother fafing about with HD mirroring, just create a backup
partition and copy every thing from your other hd's every week or so.

If you want to save space you could acutally archive everything to your
backup partition, but that would take longer (you could leave it
over-night to do like I do with RC5 ;).


   If your really keen on mirroring, theres a program on Aminet that
says it mirrors partitions. Mirroring would slow your HD down a lot
though.


See ya.

Use different names. Although DOS and other well-coded stuff (coders: spot
the satire) will work all right with multiple volumes with the same name,
some other applications, and your own looking at the workbench, will NOT work
in the long run. You would also need to use DH0: instead of OS: to be certain
that you're accessing the right volume.

My suggestion is that you call them OS and OS_mirror (or something) and when
"that day" occurs, you simply rename OS_mirror to OS (workbench 'rename' or
shell 'relabel').

A serious mater is over 700 internet login and passwords have been
stolen by someone who is unknown, Holger Kruse has released a text
about it and it can be found on the NordicGlobal site. They have been
stolen by using a fake version of the datatypes.lib. I don't have the
full details but anyone who is unsure is advised to change their
password, the list is known to be doing the rounds on some BBS's.

Merry Christmas!

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: System Partition - get PFS2 NOW!

From: Conor Kerr <ck@mystcorp.com>

Hi gerald.hobbs@wago.de,

>     Can anybody give me the benefit of their experience please?

To tell you the truth I wouldn't bother using floppies to back up your boot
partition - stuff on the boot partition rarely changes and a mirrored copy
should be sufficient.

In the event that something goes wrong with your computer, it is highly
unlikely that you would be writing to the boot partition of the mirror
drive at the same time as the boot partition of your main drive.  (that
holds as long as you use the mirror boot partition as a backup and a backup
only.)

Because it is an amiga you are using, it's almost unheard of that if
something really bad happens to your mirror hd all partitions will be lost,
only the partition being accessed at the time is in any danger (unlike on a
PC).

Also, while we're on the topic I must recommend that you get PFS2.  With
this software it is very very unlikely that you'll ever need to use the
backup and while I won't recommend not having a backup (it's good to have)
I think that backing up to floppies as well as a mirror hard-drive really
isn't worth the effort in the long run as the odds of both your drives
being wrecked are so minute when using PFS2.  (I'm trying to save you some
time here :-p) ).

In case you don't know about PFS2, check out:

http://www.ramjam.u-net.com

and buy it TODAY!  It's on special offer at the minute.  

FYI, I'm not affiliated in any way with the makers of PFS2 (hopefully I
haven't made myself outto be ;) ), I was just amazed when I installed the
software - it was like getting a system/processor upgrade!!

All the best...

    Can anybody give me the benefit of their experience please?

It will be the best thing you have ever done. I have an internal 850 Mb
IDE HD and a 1Gb scsi HD My Workbench is a 50Mb partition with the rest
of the IDE in 3 other partitions. My scsi HD is just one big partition
and which I have just dragged all my other IDE partitions (4 of 'em) on
to it to back them all up. Then just made draws for what else I need. You
could if you want break this scsi HD up in to several partitions if you
want but I some times have very large files on so like to have all the
spare space when and if needed!

You can then just back up the partion you want every now and then don't
bother with floppies it will do your head in. If you have some special
file that you want back it up on disk if you want.

If your sys' Hd goes down just put your Workbench disk in and boot on that
make a boot disk so you can see your scsi HD (if squirrel scsi, it will
make a boot disk for you if you ask)

I now use AFS you could get PFS as your file sys it will make your HD
faster (and less likely to bugger up) 

                  Cheers all the best

Well If you want that mirror to boot as your normal system, you just can do
litle modification to your mirro partitions startup.

At the first line put 
relabel >NIL: "osmirrordevicename:" "normalosvolumename"

This will just modify the volume name of your mirror sys if it is the SYS:
partition.

Well after repairing remember to change the name back so that it wont
interfere the next "normal" boot.

There is also a better solution. USE SYS: if you refer to boot partition!!!!
Oh and I have taked this system further and I have every system assigned using
assigns so if i have text related proggy or drawer which needs an assign. I
will just assign it to relate to text: so if i move my text stuff to else
where
i just need to change one assign!!!!
the main assign which tells where the text stuff can be found.

Don't bother, just get a second drive the same size or bigger than the
sum of your other drives/partitions, for backing up on. 
 (maybe an ide drive -  if you have an ide bus on your amiga, you didnt say.) 


On my home page, there is a program:   'BackItAllUp'   It's free &
it is made to mirror the current state of files on your working drives.

I use a removable 2.1Gig SCSI drive in my A4000T to back up to.

From: gerald.hobbs@wago.de

     
Thanks to Conor Kerr <ck@mystcorp.com>
     You have advised:
     
"In the event that something goes wrong with your computer, it is highly 
unlikely that you would be writing to the boot partition of the mirror 
drive at the same time as the boot partition of your main drive.  (that 
holds as long as you use the mirror boot partition as a backup and a backup 
only.)"
     
        So, *yes* I will just hold the mirror of my system partition in 
reserve backup only as suggested.
     
        You went on to say:
     
     "Also, while we're on the topic, I must recommend that you get PFS2."
     
     Indeed *yes*, ....I have already got pfs2!!
     However with pfs2 called up for the system partition, it boots O.K. 
     from switch-on, BUT from a soft reset (with Ctl-Amiga-Amiga) all I 
     got was a CLI prompt. So have reverted to FFS DOS5 for the system 
     partition which then DOES boot from a soft reset. I guess pfs2 is not 
     so important on the system partition as it is seldom written to. On 
     all the other partitions I am definitely calling for pfs2 on my RDBs.
     
     
     And thanks everyone else for advice :-)

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: System Partition

From: Nano <syzygy@sunlink.net>

Sounds like I have a similar setup. Because I [currently] don't have an
easy method of backing up I use a small hard drive to 'mirror' my boot
drive -which I copy over about once a week or with major software changes.
I do the backups manually when I feel they warrant, however I've seen
programs out there that will do this automatically.

Here's a quick layout.

DH0: is main boot drive              - label Nano:
DH1: storage for utils and such      - label Pico:
DH2: storage for mp3/anim/etc        - label Deka:
DH3: download and testing new things - label Micro:
DH9: this is my mirror of dh0:       - label Alpha:

NOTE: DH0: through DH2: are all physically the same drive. DH3: is another
and DH9: is also its own entity. At least if the entire first drive which
contains 0 through 2 is lost, I have another drive with my boot backup.
I've gone through all kinds of crashes and data loss through the years, so
you can see I've learned to take good precautions. MP3's and videos can
always be replaced, but years of customizing your Workbench to your
personal perfection is NOT something I want to lose.

If DH0: takes a dive on me for some reason I can fall back on DH9: and use
that to easily revive or format/copy back my usual setup.

Yes, give them different names. Whatever you want. i.e. Boot: and Mirror:

Exactly what I have. Both are bootable with different boot priorities.

Yup, see above.

Yes and no. Both of my drives have different names and labels but as long
as you do one simple thing it should all work out -at least it does for me.

Go through your startup-sequence and user-startup [and possibly other
places depending on your setup] and make sure anything that points to your
main boot drive is changed to SYS:. Many programs use the label name when
installing so I always make sure to check for and change that to SYS:

This way, no matter what drive you boot from it should work flawlessly
since whatever drive you boot from will automatically be SYS:. Essentially
make sure there are no label names used, instead things like C: and S: and
DEVS: are what you want.

All your other paths should be fine if they are on different drives or
partitions because those won't be affected. i.e.

Assign >NIL: Icons:     DH2:Visual/Icons

This is in my startup-sequence and is fine when booting from any drive
because it is always the same, unlike dh0 and dh9 which may swap places.


OK. I've probably said more than enough. If you have further questions, let
me know.

Subject: [just-amiga] VGA Monitors

From: "David Mcminn" <D.McMinn@eee.rgu.ac.uk>

I've been using an old SVGA monitor on my Amiga for a while now (when nobody's 
been using the PC anyway) and it worked fine. I was using the AMI2VGA buffered 
adapter and the dblntsc31 monitor from aminet.

 I just bought a new SVGA monitor and I was wondering if anyone could suggest a 
solution/place to find a solution to this problem. As soon as I switch the 
whole lot on, the power saving mode kicks in. If I disconnect my Amiga, then it 
goes on (not power saving). The monitor's got the two DDC lines, so I checked 
the PC and found that one was 5V and the other was ground, rewired the adapter, 
but the same thing. Any offerings?

 Thanks in advance.

It would appear that the monitor does not like 15KHz sync,
which is what every amiga start up in...

Your best bet would be to get hold of an Apollo MV1200  
Scan doubler & Flicker-Fixer module,  that way, no matter what you
output on the amiga, it will be vga+ mode sync.

Also, the Interlaced modes won't flicker anymore either.

You can get one from:

I've been trying to subscribe to it for *months*. All mail to the
list server seems to be delayed, and eventually cancelled.

I have been able to send a couple of mails to it, but have never got 
any back, however, I sent a mail requiring a private reply,
I received 3 replies back,  so someone is getting mail from the list.

I sent a 'subscribe teamamiga'  mail to refresh my subscription,
just in case....

But nothing happened.. !!!    I even asked garry peak to look into it
but he never replied....

I attempted to access the mailing list from the thule.no site, 
but the cgi scripting is broken & the mailing list pages are broken too.
 
So whats happening ---  I dunno....!!

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: System Partition - get PFS2 NOW!

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>


All this talk of duplicate boot partitions & mirrored drives
are in my opinion, totally redundant.

As long as you have file backups ( a copy of all your partitions )
& you update them regularly, you have nothing to loose.

ALL failures of hard drive media on Amigas fall into 4 catagories...
In order of the most common....


1:  The MaxTransfer is setup incorrectly, resulting in transfer write
    errors,  this is NOT repairable by the validator.
    Large files become corrupt & the directory structure can also
    become insane, resulting in 2 files of the same name in the same dir,
    directories disappearing, files vanishing or the drive just becomming
    a NDOS disk for no reason.

    After fixing the MaxTransfer value & rebooting, A full format
    of that partition will be required to restore sanity.

2:  The drive is corrupted by bad software writing & then crashing.
    Not allowing the drive write to complete before the reboot.
    (As the drive is validated afterwards, this is not usually a problem.)

3:  The user reboots the machine during or too soon after a write.
    (This too will validate afterwards, this is not usually a problem.)

4:  The drive itself dies.....  Shit happens !!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE,  EVEN IF THE HDTOOLBOX
PROGRAM (or whatever tool you use) THAT WANTS TO SET IT UP DIFFERENTLY.

                **** FORGET IT  !!!! ****


The ONLY values that guarantees safe operation on ALL Amigas 
& various controllers with or without a wierd drive are:

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: VGA Monitor

From: "David Mcminn" <D.McMinn@eee.rgu.ac.uk>

Hi Colin,

 I don't think its a problem with the monitor not liking the 15kHz modes on 
bootup, as even if I switch the monitor off, wait for my DBLNTSC workbench to 
boot and then switch on, I get the same thing.

 I've done some rooting around for info on DDC and VESA DPMS (the power saving 
part). DDC is a serial thing for getting device characteristics, and would be 
initiated by the computer. VESA DPMS works by keeping the sync lines at 
constant voltages (again initiated by computer), so either my adapter or sync 
outs are buggered. Or maybe even then RGB outs, as some monitors have an extra 
feature that they will go into standby mode if nothing is detected on the RGB 
lines for a long enough time.

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: System Partition - get PFS2 NOW!

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>


All this talk of duplicate boot partitions & mirrored drives
are in my opinion, totally redundant.

As long as you have file backups ( a copy of all your partitions )
& you update them regularly, you have nothing to loose.

ALL failures of hard drive media on Amigas fall into 4 catagories...
In order of the most common....


1:  The MaxTransfer is setup incorrectly, resulting in transfer write
    errors,  this is NOT repairable by the validator.
    Large files become corrupt & the directory structure can also
    become insane, resulting in 2 files of the same name in the same dir,
    directories disappearing, files vanishing or the drive just becomming
    a NDOS disk for no reason.

    After fixing the MaxTransfer value & rebooting, A full format
    of that partition will be required to restore sanity.

2:  The drive is corrupted by bad software writing & then crashing.
    Not allowing the drive write to complete before the reboot.
    (As the drive is validated afterwards, this is not usually a problem.)

3:  The user reboots the machine during or too soon after a write.
    (This too will validate afterwards, this is not usually a problem.)

4:  The drive itself dies.....  Bad luck !!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE,  EVEN IF THE HDTOOLBOX
PROGRAM (or whatever tool you use) THAT WANTS TO SET IT UP DIFFERENTLY.

                **** FORGET IT  !!!! ****


The ONLY values that guarantees safe operation on ALL Amigas 
& various controllers with or without a wierd drive are:

ALL SCSI DRIVES:    MaxTransfer =  0xffffff      Zero, x, (6 f's)
ALL IDE  DRIVES:    MaxTransfer =  0x1fe00       Zero,x,1,f,e,Zero,Zero

You have been told,  use any other values at your own peril......

If you don't believe me, that's your problem...   

If you really want to know the technical reasons for this, 
and if I get enough enquiries, then I may elaborate further.

Subject: [just-amiga] Mobile Phone -> Modem cable anyone?

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Does anyone know anything about using a modem with a mobile phone?
I have an Ericsson GA628 phone which is data and fax compatible and
an external 33600bps Dynalink modem connected to my Amiga, I want
to use the mobile phone with the external modem on my amiga and the
computer you are using I should expect won't make a difference but
I need to find somewhere that will sell a cable to connect the GA628 to
the dynalink, in theory this should be a simple cable, the mobile phone 
connector then some phone cable with a UK phone plug to go in the
back of the modem, a simple cable but does it exist? or can someone make
me one? I have seen infrared ones that have credit card size modems
built into the cable but they are over £150 and all I want is a simple
connector. This is really important and if anyone can help at all
please reply!

Merry Christmas!

Please do - I, for one, am very interested.  My IDE HD is and always has
been 0xffffff and I have never had any problems.

You've got me worried.....I'm scared.....

Please put me out of my misery ;-)

5. You use partitions beyond the 4 GB barrier, and for some reason the 
correct filesystem and/or the correct device driver are not or not 
correctly installed (e.g. you have a TD64 filesystem with DosType DOS\1 in 
the RDB, but use a partition with DosType DOS\3).

6. The 64 Bit FileSystem and/or device drivers WERE installed, but because 
of some stupid hack you tried from AmiNet the reset resident device 
drivers are kicked out of memory.

7. You use Format without "Quick" option beyond the 4GB barrier. (BTW, my 
HDInstTool is capable to DOS format partition "non-Quick" beyond the 4GB 
barrier)

8. You use (fill your faviourite PC or MAC Emulator here) partitions 
beyond the 4GB barrier.

This may be already too big for certain old drives!
Better use 0x10000 (or less) for IDE drives! 64kByte was the page size of 
the old 86x processors, so in the early days drives were never tested to 
work with bigger transfers.

BTW, in case you use Oktapussy or IDE-fix '97 RESET RESIDENT (with the 
LoadIDE command) you can set mask and maxtransfer to whatever you like 
(e.g. the most conservative settings) as the driver - once active - 
ignores these values completely.

Subject: [just-amiga] Mr Max Transfer.

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>


OK, Ive had a few people wanting more info, so here goes....

To give you the abridged version....

Firstly, MAXTRANSFER has *nothing* to do with how fast your drive 
transfers data.   This fairytale has caused a lot of the trouble
we have, because the speed-freaks love BIG numbers without knowing
what they are for...

Some very old IDE drives don't work to their rated specification 
because Windows &/or MSDos never used it.
Therfore it was never tested in manufacture.

The IDE spec states that the MaxTransfer cannot exceed 
256 x 512 bytes  ( 0x20000 )
With the 512 bytes being the sector size.

With the old (door-stop) IDE drives a Maxtransfer Value of
128 x 512 bytes  ( 0x10000 ) may need to be used before the drive 
will work at all.


So the optimum value that *modern* drives will work well at is:

( 256 x SectorSize ) - (1 x SectorSize) for safety.

 255 x 512  = 130560 ( 0x1fe00 )



If you have any boat anchors still around, a value of 0xfe00 
would be the safest to use...

( 128 x SectorSize ) - (1 x SectorSize) for safety.

 127 x 512  = 65024 ( 0xfe00 )



---------------

Now as far as the SCSI drives,  when using Commodore controllers such as
the ones in the A1200 & A4000,   there have been problems with some drives
being recognized by workbench if the maxtransfer exceeds 0xffffff  (6 f's)

The drive will appear in HDToolbox & will allow you to partition it,
but when you reboot to format it, the drive will not be recognized 
& will not be available for format.

Even though it still appears in HDToolbox.

Other controllers may set this value to 0x7ffffffe  or whatever,  they may
work fine, but as soon as that drive gets moved around onto another 
controller, you are going to have trouble.

So the quickest way to avoid software or controller problems is to set
your SCSI MaxTransfer to 0xFFFFFF   (6 f's) 
there will be no noticable change in your drives performance...

Thanks Oliver.....   Very obvious, but it slipped my mind....


EASY RULE #5:     DO NOT HAVE ANY PARTITION OVER 2047 Mb.


They are already too-hard to maintain at that size....
You will never find anything in a bottomless pit.



Personally, until the 64 bit stuff is in the ROM, it is never safe to 
assume that any patch is installed.

The problem is that you have to startup initially without any
patches installed,  because they are read from the drive during boot.

There is always the chance that the file system will not be in an
ideal or even a stable state to run without them.

NEW PRODUCT: MICROSOFT CONTRACEPTIVES

Microsoft Corporation has taken another step toward dominating every
aspect of American life with the introduction of Contraceptive98, a
suite of applications designed for users who engage in sex.

Microsoft has been a pioneer in peer-to-peer connectivity and plug and
play. It believes these technologies will give it substantial leverage
in penetrating  the copulation enhancement market.

The product addresses two important user concerns: the need for virus
protection and the need for a firewall to ensure the non-propagation of
human beings.


The Contraceptive98 suite consists of three products: Condom98, DeFetus
1.0 (from Sementec), and AIDScan 2.1 (from Norton Utilities). A free
copy
of Intercourse Explorer 4.0 is bundled in the package.


The suite also comes in two expanded versions. Contraceptive98 
Professional
is the Client/Server edition, for professionals in the sexual services
sector. Contraceptive98 Small Business Edition is a package for
start-ups,
aimed at the  housewife and gigolo niches.

While Contraceptive98 does not address non-traditional copulatory 
channels,
future plug-ins are planned for next year. They will be known as
BackDoor,
AuraLee, TitElation, and JerkOff.

OPERATION - Only one node in a peer-to-peer connection needs to install
the package. At installation, the Condom98 software checks for minimum
hardware.

If the  user meets the requirements, the product installs and is
sufficiently scaleable to meet most requirements.

After installation, operation commences. One caution is that the user
must
have sufficient RAM to complete the session.

When the session is complete, a disconnect is initiated, and the user
gets
the  message, It is now safe to turn off your partner.

DRAWBACKS - Usability testers report that frequent failures were a major
concern during beta testing. General Protection Fault was the most
serious
error encountered.

Early versions had numerous bugs, but most of these have been
eliminated.
The  product needs to be installed each time its used.

CONCLUSION - Contraceptive98 is a robust product. Despite its drawbacks,
it is a reasonably good value for its $49.95 price tag, and is far
superior to its shareware version. Hopefully, future releases (of the
software, that is) will add missing functionality, such as Backout and
Restore, Uninterruptible Power Supply, and Onboard Camera.

Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is optimistic about Contraceptive98s potential.
He recently said, "Our contraceptive products will help users do to each
other what we've been doing to our customers for years."

Subject: [just-amiga] Hard drive space

From: "Terry Davis" <Terry@fuchsia.prestel.co.uk>

Hi
I am a relative novice with computers, so this is probably a silly
question but here goes.
I only have a 170meg hard drive of which 10meg is devoted to Workbench
DH0. This partition is almost completely full. I have been moving
cirtain files out of DH0 to a draw  in DH1 in order to create more
space in DH0. This so far has caused no problems.
I see that I have nearly 2meg of fonts in DH0. If I could move them to
DH1 this would give me a lot of breathing space.
My question is does the computer look in the fonts draw at it needs
fonts or are they just stored there to bring into programms as I
require them. If I moved them out of DH0 would the computer crash and
not start up. I thought I had better ask before I did something I
would regret.
Thanks in anticipation.
Terry

Assign >NIL: Fonts: DH1:Fonts

Copy the whole of the fonts drawer to HD1: Edit your startup-sequence where is
says assign FONTS SYS:fonts to: Assign FONTS: DH1:fonts
Either remove assign and re-assign by hand, or easier: Reboot computer.
Then you will be able to delete the whole of thw SYS:fonts drawer (DH0)
without complaints about "Object in use" etc.

No need for reboot, in cli type :
##assign fonts:remove#
then edit startup-sequence,
then move the fonts drawer,
then just reassign it again,
#assign fonts dh1:fonts#

Well well.. isn't it a crazy, PC-dominated world we're living in. =) I mean,
one of the great things about Amiga according to me is the fact that they
still work without a harddisk, without software (except what's in ROM), and
without helplines.

Off topic? Perhaps.. =)

Don't worry i've asked worse. I know this has been answered so your OK but
when if you ever repartition (or get bigger HD) make that SYS: bigger as
your finding out It don't half fill up. I started out with 10Mb then
moved to 20 then 25 now its 54Mb.

Sorry Chris, but the data rate that digital mobile phones use
is about 9600 bd.

Thats why they sound so terrible...

Analogue phones however, might afford some better results...  
But I have no idea how to do it other than an accoustic coupler.

Well a bigger drive would help him alot..

ahh come on!, you're trying to sell him something by telling him it's not
worth the risk?? There is no risk! Just change the name of the directory in
the startup-sequence and it works fine!. Even if he gets it wrong then he
won't be frying anything!

I sold my analogue phone because the reception was terible, 
I can't see how they would work at all on a modem. The signal is
to poor with analogue phones, surely digital is much better?

Regardless of whether you are on this list or not, change your passwords
anyway - it is unlikely to be the only list.

In fact, really, you should change your password monthsly - breakins to ISP
servers are more common than you might think.

I don't know what the situation is like in the UK, but Australia is
REAL BIG !!!!     The Analogue system is rock solid here,  only recently
the digital system has been introduced,  

I could urinate further than the range those phones afford,
plus, they break up & give you:    bl-dy hor-ble so-nding pho-e cal-s.

The analogue system may get a bit crackly when you are pushing the range
but you can still use it....


As I said on a previous email...  
The digital system uses 9600 bd data rate.  (In OZ, I believe.)

Sound so terrible? did i miss something or did you just completely
cock up :)? Digital are the better, clearer reception phones, the new
technology, Analogue ones are old with terrible connections?

Am I right or did i just make a bigger cock up :)?

My apologies if this has already been posted.

This caught my eye and gave me a small smile. I know C|Net have covered the
Amiga in the past, but seeing another little article lit up my eyes.

It's an article called Where Are They Now. It ranks the top 10 products /
names of yesteryear. We didn't make #1, but hey, we are in there. =)

Well obviously it is a completely different situation, the digital system
is far advanced and the analogue is terible really. On digital you can
phone other countrys with a good signal, i phoned canada, only 55p
a min and great quality :)

I suppose if you stand underneath a 200 watt cell tower they
would be clearer, but that is just not going to happen in reality.

In OZ, the system they use here sucks !! big-time,

The analogue system is still running in tandem right now, but they are
going to phase it out by 2000+?...

The analogue phones might not be 'hi-fi'  but you can be 80km from
a cell tower & you can still get service,  it might be a bit crackly
but it works....

On the other hand, the digital system is being advertised as:

"Better,Stronger,Faster,Higher,Lower,Cheaper,Dearer,Wonderfuller,Betterer"


Plus any other superlatives you can think of or make up...
But OZ is a BiiiiiiG  country,  to can drive for 100km just to get a
packet of cigarettes & some milk ...   And thats IN TOWN....

The digital phones: break up, mute up, drop out, make burping noises,
hang up, squeel & sound like you're talking in the channel tunnel.
(with your head in a bucket.)

I don't think the infrastructure is setup for digital in this country,
it is fine in the cities, but there are only a few of them.

As soon as you get out in 'The Sticks'  you might as well set fire
to the damn phone & use it for smoke signals....

Or as a projectile to kill lunch....

It was taken care of for you and I did send you a reply when I got
back into town a couple of days ago. If you still have not gotten any

On 08-Dec-98, Chris Seward set out across the seas with this message:

->A serious mater is over 700 internet login and passwords have been
->stolen by someone who is unknown, Holger Kruse has released a text

The datatypes.library is version 45.5 I think (it's 45.something anyway)

It contains a trojan which uses miami to send your details to an account on
hotmail.

If you have d/led a datatypes.library v45.x from a BBS inform the SysOp to
take it offline!  I think the datatype also made its way onto AmiNet.

It's also a pretty good idea to use an older version ;]

From: bill.eaves@zetnet.co.uk

Hi,

There has been a lot mentioned recently about the false version of 
datatypes libraries.

I am still using the original one. What would be the advantage of using 
v45 over v39 ? Is there any ?

I tried using the proper Aminet version of v45 - the size is the OK one - 
but when I boot up I get the error message "Cannot find datatypes.library 
v39.x". 

So the question is what would v45 give me that v39 does not and if it is 
worth changing how do I get rid of the initial error message that insists I 
use v39 ?


Regards,

Bill.

Just because everyone is running around saying "woo, look it's digital,
therefore it must be better!!" don't listen to it! Which is clearer, a sond

anologue, the comp is digital

I'll say nothing..

Moving fonts is not a major problem as workbench mainly uses 1 or 2 fonts,
usually courier. Most times a program will throw up a requester box asking for
the font and you usually can just press cancel and the system uses a default
font.

I had the same problem while I was using TermiteTCP. For some reason it
demanded V39. If you are using TTCP that could be the problem. After I
switched to Miami this message was gone.

That's one good reason for using digital 8)

Positive, I checked the size. I think that something in my startup must 
be demanding a specific version of the library, I will try and find out what 
it is.

The question is, what does v 45 have that v39 doesn't and is it worth 
changing anyway ?

It must be some application that is demanding that version 
then. I will
check my commodoties and user startup as it happens during 
boot up.

It is not TermiteTCP as I have never used it, I always use 
Miami.

Subject: [just-amiga] Hard Drive Space

From: "95LHSC" <95LHSC@saltash.cornwall.sch.uk>

In refrence to Terry Davis' post about hard drive space, is there any way
to enlarge the size of a partition without having to delete another
partition. I haven't tried englarging a partion, but it would be usefull to
know.

Hello,

Just a warning!!! 
There is a trojan in a version of the datatypes library that was released on
Aminet (version 45.5).

This trojan sends your IP data (including password and DNS server) to the
boys
of digital corruption.

Here's a translation of a message posted here in Portugal:

You will get that message if you are running v3.0 of the OS as
versions of Datatypes.library newer than 39x require 3.1.

If you are running 3.1, then something is f*cked up. and you should
install the version off your WB disk.

NO.  is the short answer.  If the 'boundary' for a partition is moved
by even one cylinder, then BOTH partitions either side of the 'boundary'
will become invalid.

Any further partitions on the drive will remain valid.
So technically, if you have only one drive & it is big enough, you could 
move the files around...  For example:  You have DH0: DH1: DH2:

If it was a 1 Gig drive....... and.......

DH0: = 50Mb   (Workbench)  100% full
DH1: = 300Mb  (stuff)       70% full
DH2: = 650Mb  (more stuff)  30% full

If there is 350mb free on DH2:  then just make directories:

makedir dh2:-dh0    
makedir dh2:-dh1

from a cli.......

copy dh0: dh2:-dh0/ all clone
copy dh1: dh2:-dh1/ all clone

when they are copied over, then you can move the boundary between dh0 & dh1.

for instance...   
    DH0: = 100Mb  (now)
    DH1: = 250Mb  (now)
After making changes with HDtoolbox,  boot up on a WB floppy disk.
Re-format dh0: & dh1:

then copy all the files back.....   then Reboot & come back up on DH0....

I assume it's because they haven't completed more than 11% of the

It's encrypted all right.

However, it wouldn't be a very successful trojan if it were requiring an
older version of the library to work. That older version would have to be
stored as LIBS:datatypes.library, and so would the trojan. =)

Ok. this email reply maybe slightly late but heres my reply anyway :)

It would depend on what you want, if you where making a whole new
isp then it would take alot of money, probably into millions of pounds
for the type of system people would want, transatlantic connections
for fast web access etc would cost quite alot.

Although on the other hand alot of isps use 'other' isps to run the
actual whole thing, with Wirenet (Uk amiga only isp) they use u-net
which handle all the computer and dialups etc so it would cost less
because Neil Botherwick (owner of wirenet) doesn't have to bother
with all the dialup lines and other computer hardware so that would
cost less.

You also get other companys, i think FreeDotNet (which i use) are
run from the Microsoft network uk internet company but i'm unsure,
if they are then grrr. But for £30 for two years i'm not complaning :)

Merry Christmas!!!

That will explain it, I only have the 3.0 ROMs.
Seems as if I will continue to use v39 of the libaray.

Thanks for the info.

Well, I've just seen AI's new site - not bad, but now the indicator has
gone completely - maybe because it was meaningless and they couldn't
pinpoint development to a percentage?

Subject: [just-amiga] Install Prog.

From: Don and Lynn Benson <dlbenson@psnw.com>

Hello,

I have a problem, occasionally, with the Installer program. For instance
when I try to install the Epic Encyclopedia the program goes part way
through the script and just quits. Several other times I have had the
program come up with very strange errors, such as a bad command and
a bad line in the script. In some cases I have been able to modify
the script and get it to run, but most times it will not work.

I have tried several different Installer programs, including versions
43.3 and 1.24. I am using KS 40.68 and WB 40.42 and an A-4000/040
with 16 megs.

Does anybody have any ideas of the actual problem?

What version of Epic's opus are you trying to install?
Last years version had an update to the install file as it took
an hour on my machine to complete!
1998 version only took a few minutes though and is much better IMHO.
It never quit on me though with any version.
Installer version 43.3 rom 3.0

First off, use the configdisk tool in crossdos to set up the drive, it will
create a dosdriver for you to put in the devs:dosdrivers directory. I've found
that its better not to automount PC drives (which is set up in HDTools), but to
let the dosdriver mount it.

Secondly, make sure that the information in HDTools matches that in the
dosdriver. If there are any differences, then change the HDTools settings to
match the dosdriver settings, i.e., filesystem, etc. Also make sure that you
increase the buffers from the default setting which is pretty low, or copying
will be slow. I use 200 buffers here.

Then you can then format the drive using the format command which crossdos
should have patched when you installed it. It will automatically recognise the
drive as a MSDOS HD, and format it accordingly.

Now, the problem I've found with the above, which is the way you're supposed to
do it, is that while it works fine for PCTask partitions and the like, you can't
read the drive from a PC :( The way I got around this is to follow the steps
above, with the following changes.

Don't set the drive up in HDTools at all. DOn't even use HDTools to add the
drive to the system, change drive type etc.

First, format the drive on a PC using the standard MSDOS format command, no
fancy FAT filesystems or NTFS, just bog standard DOS.

When the drive is formatted, use crossdos and configdisk to create the
Dosdriver, and put it in DEvs:Dosdrivers, check the buffers settings and thats
it. When you reboot, the drive should appear on the Workbench, can be
written/read by the Amiga and by a PC. :))

By the way, if the miggy is towered, look at buying a couple of removable
harddrive bays and put one in the miggy and one in the PC. Install the drive in
one of the caddies, and switching it between computers is a piece of p*ss :))

From: "Dave Le Huray" <dave@lehuray.freeserve.co.uk>

Hi Chris,

My apologies in advance for typing this slowly but I haven't learnt to
use more than one finger on each hand yet ;-)

However, on Wed, 09 Dec 1998 18:22:58 +0100 you talked about [just-amiga] Mobile Phone -> Modem cable anyone? and said:

< big snip>

I work for Guernsey Telecoms, the telephone network provider for the
Island (the local equivalent to BT only a lot cheaper ;-P), and I have
spoken to our GSM Development department who are currently actively
marketing mobile Fax and Data.

They deal almost exclusively with Ericsson products have told me that
they are unaware of any such cable and therefore one would have to be
constructed, as a one-off, for you. Imagine the cost of that :-/

They also asked why you would want to connect an external modem to a
mobile phone ?

Surely it would be megatimes (I like that word don't you :-)) cheaper
to use a standard fixed network line. Even considering the cost of
having an extra line installed.

I emailed VodaFone and they said that the cable could be bought
from my local VodaFone retailer :)

Why would they make a data port on the phone if no cable was
available?

Anyway doesn't matter now as i'm off to purchase it :)

Merry Christmas!

From: Cold Spring <coldspring@thenet.co.uk>

Hello amiga guys,

I'm using an A1200, 540 mb HDD, and have not connected any new hardware to the
machine.

But recently, when I press A,A & Ctrl when booting to access the harddrive, it
comes up with the black screen and red box 'software error', this happens two
or three times until it eventually accesses the HDD.

Today, it took 5 attempts and then it crashed while accessing the HDD, so on
the sixth attempt the work: drive had to be validated.

So, the problem is getting worse everyday....anyone have any idea what's
happening? Is my HDD damaged? 

Best Wishes,


Justin / COLD SPRING

*** PLEASE NOTE - If anyone has been attempting to email COLD SPRING in the
past 18 days, our internet provider had a fibre optic cable split which needed
replacing and knocked the entire net out for that time. Sorry for any
inconvenience, we're happy to say everything is back to normal now. PLEASE
SEND ANY EMAILS AGAIN. THANK YOU. ***

Besides the fact that you have just said what computer & HD you have,
you neglected to mention the power supply....

If you are still running with the A1200 brick, 
then that may be the main culprit....

Change your power supply...   If you have an old A500 power supply,
use it, they have a better current rating. (4.5a @ 5v)  Vs  (3a @ 5v)  

Also, try just booting on a floppy WB disk.   
It will probably still crash, virtually eliminating the HD as a problem.

Another problem: I've had a serial port connector detach itself from the

Why do you have to press the reset option (Ctrl, Amiga, Amiga) to boot
the harddrive? - Your HD should automatically kick in, if not then I
suggest
you check the connections of everything from the HD to all cables
attached
to your computer.

There are a number of reasons that all have to be checked, firstly as
I suggest above make sure everything is in its place and is pressed
in securely. Second have you installed any new software to the boot
of your HD ?? it could be a certain program infering if it is near the
start of your HD boot. Has your computer come into contact with any
magnets or any magnetic hardware or applications near to the computer,
speakers, radios etc. I would suggest moving them all away.

I don't actually think they would cause the problems but I suggest
trying either of them just to check.

Merry Christmas All!

Alot of todays installer scripts are badly made, usually people want
a professional installer so they snip bits from proper install
scripts and add it together to get a shaky install script for the
program of choice.

This is a common problem for me especially when using PD software,
commercial software shouldn't suffer from this although again if
it is badly put together then it is the fault of the company.

PD software on the other hand is done by non-professionals
and they don't have the power/time or money to spend countless
hours testing software. Usually people are so eagar to release
their software that they forget to test small details like if the
installer works correctly. They leave stupid things out like wanting
to install from their own HD name, usually I will get errors like

Cannot find MY_WAY_COOL_GAMES:

Because the author has forgotten that not everyone is going to
have a directory called MY_WAY_COOL_GAMES: so then this has to
be changed manually. Another problem you might come accross
is sometimes it will exit with a message Fault or Error leaving no
clue to what is wrong, my tip is......

just give up, its the authors fault.

Subject: [just-amiga] The mobile phone saga ends...

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Right, if anyone else is wondering, you can purchase the required
cable for the Ericsson GA628 from your local VodaFone dealer in
the UK.

Thanks for everyones 'help' if you can call it that :) It was quicker
for me to email VodaFone directly, now why didn't I think of that?

Oh and yes.. AIO issue 19 out :-

Merry Christmas!

What - did you want it to ring bells or send you an email first !!!!

The same light bulb in your kitchen never blew out more than once either.

I have been in the electronics repair industry for 25 years, 
I am constantly amused by the absurd statements customers make
regarding their appliances.

I still cannot understand the psychology behind them......


EG:  "The tv was working fine last night, so there can't be much wrong".

     "It was smoking for only about 25 minutes !!!"

     "It must be just a loose wire or a fuse..."

     "But you fixed it 3 years ago..."

     "I paid $2000 for it, so it can't be faulty..."

     "It never did that before...."

     "It always does that, but it never stopped totally."

     "The sparking noises go away after 10 minutes..."

     "After I accidently tipped the water in it,  
            I turned it on to see if it would still work...."

     "If I get it fixed, it won't break down again, will it. ?"

     "I didn't really want to spend any money on it..."
     (what are you doing in my shop then, we don't accept chickens.)

     "I only wanted a quote..." 
     (After customer authorized repair, then was rung up to collect it.)
 
     "It used to work again if I hit it on the side of the case.."
         (re: enquiring about cabinet damage, entire side of case crushed in)

     (Sorry, the parts are not available anymore for that model.)
     "That's not good enough, what are you going to do about it then..."
     (Give it back to you & tell you to go & annoy the manufacturer.)

     The video records if I do it manually by just pressing the red button,
     but it won't 'timer record' past midnight.... 
     So the clock must be faulty somehow ?

     What will I do if lightning hits my antenna......
     ( spontaneously combust !!! )



>also, when the machine seems to warm up, it doesn't do it
>again....hmmmm....

Hmmmm,....
  Would you believe an intermittent fault that goes away when it is hot."


>Thanks for the advice....
Sorry about the roasting......  You're probably still young & i'm 
just turning into an old synical fart...

My appologies ....

Because like me, and many thousands of other people, we brought cheap drives
which take about 5 seconds to spin up. Only thing is the amiga has already
booted, so the amiga thinks there is no drive because it isn't at full
speed yet. Once you reboot, the amiga boot, while the drive is at full
speed. Annoying really..

Very high chance of having something dogey in the startup somewhere

Failing this, wrap the harddrive in a couple of layers of paper to make sure
nothing is shorting out, like it was in mine....

If you load 50 people in a lifr designed to hold 40 people, then it will
still work for a while, but will enevitably fail soon, like my supply. Once
I got my 3.5" drive and accelerator the power worked for 3 weeks, then it
would cut out every 2 hours, then ever hour then ever 30 minutes..... Time
for a goliath power supply?

Check you memory expansion.  It isn't your HD at all.

Take your accelerator board out of your Amiga.  Clean the connections,
_DO NOT USE ANY CLEANING SUBTANCES, OR ALCHOL_ by blowing them.
Take you ram out of you accelerator and do say here as well.  Then
reisert these back in to you Amiga.

If that dosn't work it probley PSU problem.  Are you using a Tower if
so check all cabbles as there are know to be able sometimes to come
lose (PC's suffer from this problem as well).

Call me biased or something (haven't checked that program) but...
I really think MultiUserFileSystem together with a hardware lock
would make for a better security (not that an Amiga can be entirely
safe).

Hello Chris,

>Why do you have to press the reset option (Ctrl, Amiga, Amiga) to boot

Well, when I tunr the 1200 on - it gives the purple screen with the animated
floppy into drive picture....then I pres A/A/ctrl and hdd loads in....

Actually, its stopped doing it the last two days....however there's a new
problem:

The serial connector from a ribbon cable from my Clarity 16 has fallen off -
is there any way of reliably re-connecting it?

Best Wishes,


Justin / COLD SPRING

*** PLEASE NOTE - If anyone has been attempting to email COLD SPRING in the
past 18 days, our internet provider had a fibre optic cable split which needed
replacing and knocked the entire net out for that time. Sorry for any
inconvenience, we're happy to say everything is back to normal now. PLEASE
SEND ANY EMAILS AGAIN. THANK YOU. ***

I think so. I've just d/l'd multiuserfilesystem offa Aminet. It
patches FFS, so booting with no startup probably won't give you access
because the thingo is written to the filesystem and atteched to the
partitions via some kind of keyfile. This would mean you can only
access this way if you are the system admin' and have the passwords
for the keyfiles.

I think I will buy another Harddrive so I can back this one up in it's
current state, just incase I f*ck things up when I intall the MUFS ;)

I'm not a tech' head so I could of got it wrong, and I did read the
doc's at 3am 8)

Subject: [just-amiga] ARG WHAT to do now?

From: uLf "iTl" Seemann <iTl@nWn.dE>

Hallo all!
I`ve got an big prob: When I copied a relatively large file (mov/~3M) onto
my scsi-HD, the system suddenly hung and the babe was born: after rebooting
there were no validating-errors and the file was not in the destination
dir. I tried again and the guru returned once more. I couldn`t acces any
files in that directory without errors like checksum errors..
So I did the following:
    I started AmiBack-Tools and had the device analyzed.
    Analyst found that the root-block was corrupt and
    suggested to install a new (empty) one. And I did
    that, aaarggh!

    From then on, the drive was suddenly named "Lazarus"
    and I got tons of read/write errors.

    DiskSalv was able to put the 20.000+ files of that
    drive onto another, but without the directory names
    (the higher levelled) and everything in a mess!

Can ANYONE out there provide some help? There a 700M of important dataon it
and I don`t know what to do! How can I re-create the proper, original
root-block or what is needed for the disk being fine again?
    pLeaZe HeLP!

Regardz, uLf

You don't  !!! - Once you've written over it you're history...
There is nothing there anymore to restore...

But !!!,  
Keep safe, what files you have managed to extract, 
that may be all you get....

You can re-create the directories & re-install software again, 
as long as you have your data files to put back in there...

Maybe someone out there can do miracles or suggest a course of action
other than my (not to helpfull now)  usefull suggestion...
