<p align="center"><font size="6">Foundation - Prologue</font><font size="7"><br>
</font><i>Written by: Jason Hayman</i></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">It was an uninteresting chamber, dark and
unassuming, as common as any other lawyers room. Books filled the
shelves that reached to the ceiling and rolls of parchment,
yellow with age, pointed awkwardly out of dark corners, a select
few placed uncomfortably inside an umbrella stand fashion in the
shape of an elephants foot.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A desk was placed at the far end of the room;
dark wood riddled with cracks and creases like the old man who
sat behind it. A single electric lamp illuminated his desk
shedding its flickering, electric glow across the paper that the
gaunt old man was furiously scribbling across. The hard light
gave the old man a haunted, hallow look to his weathered face.
Behind the writing man, framed by more towering book shelves that
seemed ready to topple over under the weight, was a rather boring
door that could easily lead to a toilet, or even worse, an
accountant's office.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Footsteps from the corridor caused a momentary
flicker in the old man's writing. He paused for a twinkling
of a heart beat, looked up briefly at the door in front of him,
then returned to his agitated writing. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The door opened a crack; a ray of white light
filled half the room illuminating the far side of the study and
making the old, dusty books cower deeper into the shadows of
their shelves for safety.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Please close the door behind you,
Gibbons,&quot; the old man said, a hint of annoyance in his
morose voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The door creaked shut. The lithe figure of a
slim, skeletal man seemed to glide over to the desk. &quot;Good
news, sir!&quot; the figure tried to say in a cheery, but
tortuously bothersome voice. To the old man sat behind the desk,
the voice always reminded him of a cat trapped in a washing
machine during the spin-cycle. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">There was no answer as the man continued his
manic writing. Gibbons looked around awkwardly, the whites of his
eyes the only feature discernible in the dark, oppressive gloom
of the room. He hated it when his master ignored him and he
self-consciously started to ring his hands together.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Get on with it, Gibbons. Time is
wasting.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Sir, I believe I have found the remaining
people you asked for.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The writing stopped and the pen was put down
gently to rest over the paper, then he looked up into
Gibbons' darting eyes. The old man arched an eyebrow.
&quot;All of them?&quot; he inquired sceptically, as if he could
not believe that the task was possible. The tall, shadowy figure
nodded energetically. It was always happy to please his master.
&quot;Well?&quot; the old man prompted impatiently after a moment
of silence.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Gibbons looked blankly at his master until he
realised what he wanted. &quot;Ah! I shall show them in shall
I?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes Gibbons. Please do,&quot; came his
masters wry answer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Bowing profusely, the tall figure ambled
backwards to the door then left the room. After a few moments
there was a hollow knock.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Come in!&quot; the old man called in a
slightly warmer tone of voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The door opened and a tall, well built man with
a stone like structure to his face walked into the room. Long,
curly ginger hair trailed over his shoulders, a grey robe etched
in a zig-zap pattern along the cuff of the sleeves and the run of
the hem showed a finery to his clothes that some of the other
&quot;patrons&quot; that had visited this room in past had not.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Please, take a seat,&quot; the old man
offered to the handsome stranger without rising from his own
seat. The man seemed sceptical at first but then pulled out the
seat from under the the desk and sat down slowly, his sharp, blue
eyes not leaving the old mans for a moment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I was offered a holiday?&quot; the
ginger haired man stated as a half-question. He still sounded
suspicious and looked ill at ease. &quot;A <i>special</i>
holiday?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed, sir!&quot; the old man behind the
desk said in well rehearsed, buoyant voice. &quot;A holiday
unlike any other you have taken before!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The well built man gave him a long, hard stare
before he asked his next question. &quot;And it is for
free?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man smiled a winning smile. &quot;Yes,
sir. For people such as yourself.&quot; The man still did not
look convinced. &quot;See it as a game. When you lose, the
holiday is over and you will be returned to where Mr. Gibbons
found you.&quot; The old man could see that some of the hard
resolve was draining from the strangers face. &quot;It will be
like living another life, starting all over again in a world
ruled my magic and gods.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Gods! Hah!&quot; The big man bellowed.
&quot;I have had enough of the Church! They're nothing but
bullies and late payers!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man smiled. &quot;I assure you, sir, no
one in this world will bully you. In this world all your dreams
will come true.&quot; The hardness suddenly drained away from the
big mans face.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Dreams. Yes! I have plenty of
dreams,&quot; the big man smiled broadly. &quot;You know, I have
this idea for a balloon filled with hot air. Hot air rises you
see, lifting you off the ground!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed it does sir. I can guarantee you
that in this holiday, that dream will come true.&quot; The old
man leaned over his desk. &quot;That is why we want you sir. You
are an inventor, a dreamer, those are the sort of people this
world is catered for.&quot; He saw that he had the stranger on
the proverbial, hook, line and sinker. &quot;Of course, you can
say `no' and none of this would have happened.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The large man snapped out of his day dreaming.
&quot;I would like to take the holiday!&quot; He said in a firm,
determined voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Excellent!&quot; the old man beamed. He
opened a draw and pulled out a piece of paper. &quot;I just need
to take some details, sir.&quot; The old man scribbled across the
page then without looking up he asked, &quot;Name please
sir.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Da Vinci.&quot; The large man answered.
&quot;Leonardo Da Vinci.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Occupation?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Artist, sculptor, inventor&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Thank you sir. If you just sign this
declaration here at the bottom.&quot; He handed the artist the
sheet of paper he had been scribbling across. &quot;Here
sir,&quot; the old man pointed out, &quot;where the dotted line
is.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Flamboyantly, Leonardo Da Vinci signed his
name.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Now sir, if you walk this way,&quot; the
old man rose majestically from his seat gesturing to the artist
to walk towards the plan wooden door behind the desk. Taking the
handle, the old man opened the door and beckoned Leonardo inside.
&quot;If would kindly walk inside sir, you can enter the last
phase of the contract.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The room beyond was dark and foreboding.
Leonardo looked to the old man who smiled warmly like the cat who
had just got the milk. &quot;Are you sure? It looks rather dark
in there.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;All will be revealed soon, sir.&quot;
Again the old man beckoned the artist inside. Gingerly, Leonardo
took the few hesitant steps that led him into the darkness. He
looked around and gave the old man an apprehensive look.
&quot;Please be calm sir, all is fine.&quot; Suddenly light
started to the fill the room. Leonardo looked around, alarmed at
the brilliant glare. &quot;Be at ease sir. Your holiday begins in
earnest.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man closed the door and walked back to
the desk. Rays of light streamed out of the gaps between the door
and it's frame. Quite unperturbed, the old man continued his
writing on the sheet of paper then placed it carefully back into
his desk. His room was now filled with rays or rotating light,
books harshly illuminated giving the effect of faces etched along
their spines and covers. The books seemed to be smirking.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Wwwwwaaaaaahhhhhhhh &quot; <i>POP!
Fiiizzzzzz! </i>Leonardo's wail was suddenly cut off in mid
stroke and the brilliant rays of light seeping in from the
concealed room vanished.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Calmly, the old man closed the draw of his desk
then leaned over to a box lined with buttons. He pressed one of
them and the box hissed. &quot;Send in the next one,
Gibbons.&quot; He spoke woodenly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After a few moments, there was another knock.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Come!&quot; the old man called.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The door was swung open and the broad <i>short</i>
figure of a man stood in the doorway. Light slowly seeped
into the office, the old man began to make out features. The
short, stocky man wore metallic shoulder plates, a breastplate
moulded in the shape of a powerful mans chest. Underneath his
armour, he wore a while tunic, the sleeves ending at his elbows
and gold trim around their edges. Another man of wealth, the old
man mused. Surprisingly, the short man in the doorway was wearing
a skirt and knee high boots strapped up his hairy calves. A sword
was strapped to his waist and the stocky man had his hand resting
comfortably on the hilt like a man at ease with killing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Take a seat, please,&quot; the old man
offered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The soldier looked about the room then
forcefully pulled out the chair and sat down. &quot;I was told to
come here!&quot; the man bellowed. He cocked his head to the side
and glared at the old man with his fierce blue eyes. &quot;For
a <i>game</i>.&quot; He leaned over the desk.
&quot;A war game devised by the gods,&quot; he said ominously
with a wink.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed, sir! And a grand game it is
too!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The military man looked about the room.
&quot;Books!&quot; he shouted in contempt. &quot;Nothing good
comes from books!&quot; He returned his icy stare to the old man.
&quot;Where's your swords and shields and heads stuck on
poles?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man sat back into his chair easily
brushing aside the stray comment from the stranger. &quot;This is
a gateway, sir. Beyond that door,&quot; the old man turned
slightly in his chair and pointed at the boring looking and now
intimidated door, &quot;lays a word full of violence and war,
pestilence and famine. Beyond there, sir, lies your dreams.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Women?&quot; the solider asked, squinting
suspiciously at the old man.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed, sir. And alcohol,&quot; he said
sweetly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The soldier smiled, a broad smile showing his
white teeth. The old man could not fail to see the gaps.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;And if I die, I do not die?&quot; The
stranger seemed puzzled at this sentence, as if he was repeating
it from a mind that did not understand.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;If you die in <i>that</i> world, sir, you
will be returned to this one, to where Mr. Gibbons found
you,&quot; the old man replied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The weasely man with the runny eyes who
can't seem to focus on one point?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, sir! I see you know him quite
well.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Damn girlie he is, man! First sign of
trouble, he wee's himself!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;He has been known to do that,&quot; the
old man said apologetically. &quot;Something to do with his
upbringing I believe.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Well, man! Can I go to this New World or
not? I have the need to conquer something!&quot; he barked with a
roguish laugh. &quot;A good woman perhaps!&quot; he jeered with a
wink.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed you can, sir!&quot; The old man
interrupted quickly. &quot;You are just what we are looking
for,&quot; the old man made a point of looking for his desk draw,
&quot; brutish&quot;, he added to himself as he
opened the small compartment and took out another piece of paper.
&quot;You name, please sir. For the records you understand.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Alexander the Great!&quot; the man
shouted and he jumped to his feet and planted his fists on his
hips. &quot;Conqueror of the know world and chosen of the
Gods!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Quite so, sir, and how well they need you
too,&quot; the old man leaned closer to his desk as he wrote.
&quot;They'll love you over there,&quot; he added in a
quieter voice. &quot;Occupation sir?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;God,&quot; Alexander said lovingly to
himself. He brushed some imaginary specks of dust from his
breastplate then inspected his manicured nails. &quot;Women fall
at my feet and offer themselves to me. What would you call
that?&quot; the man asked, obviously puzzled at his own question.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Desperate?&quot; the old man offered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alexander the Great shot him an acid stare,
then a slow smile spread across his face. &quot;Hah! I like you,
man! You have guts!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed I do, and they are staying right
where they are!&quot; Alexander let out a huge bellow of
laughter. &quot;So then, sir. Shall I add to your occupation,
womaniser and raving alcoholic?&quot; Alexander laughed even
louder.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I like you!&quot; he bellowed. &quot;You
have more backbone than any of my commanders!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Thank you, sir, I will remember
that.&quot; He rose from his seat. &quot;Now if you would enter
that door, the final part of the contract will be
completed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alexander tried to stand taller, and nearly
succeed despite the only fact that he was three feet shorter than
the old man. As the warrior walked towards the door, it opened on
its own accord. Alexander shot the old man an alarmed look.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The Gods are only eager for you to
enter,&quot; the old man suggested. &quot;Their realm awaits
you.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Alexander beamed and confidently walked into
the dark room beyond. The door immediately slammed shut behind
the warrior.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thumping sounded from the other side.
&quot;What trickery is this!&quot; Alexander bellowed.
&quot;There is nothing here but darkness&quot; Suddenly
light streamed into the office from around the doorframe.
&quot;Witchcraft! I have been betrayed!&quot; More thumping, more
urgent this time. &quot;I'll - !&quot; Suddenly his voice
was cut off. &quot;Aarrgghhhhhhh - !&quot; <i>POP!</i> <i>Fiiizzzzzz!</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The light vanished and the old man returned to
his seat. He pressed the button on his intercom and it hissed
into life. &quot;Next!&quot; he commanded gruffly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After a short time, there was a knock at the
door.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Enter!&quot; the old man bid.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A head peeked in though the doorway. Well,
technically it was head, but it looked like someone had placed a
spiky, frazzled brush on their head. Even the old man seemed
surprised.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Please, come in.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Is dis the room for the vacation?&quot;
the heavily accented voice asked. The old man rummaged around his
memory trying to place the speakers accent. <i>Jewish, with a
hint of American</i>, the old man mused.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Take a seat, please,&quot; the old man
offered. What entered was comical. The man wore a grey suite that
was just to short for him, a brown tie only loosely knotted about
his neck and a white shirt covered in criss-crossing lines to
form squares. Long, grey-white hair somehow lifted off his scalp
like the old man had recently had an electric shock was a
prominent feature that the eye and mind found hard to ignore. A
thick moustache, somehow also looking comical, sat like an
overweight caterpillar on his lip. Definitely the mad scientist
look.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Ah, good!&quot; the stranger said. He
meandered up to the desk, his attention fixed upon the rows and
rows of books before he bumped into the seat and sat down in the
chair. &quot;The strange man with the runny eyes, waz a bit
erratic with his directions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I will need to have a word with
him,&quot; the old man behind the desk answered, feeling an
afirmity with the new stranger.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yez, indeed, but logic dedicated that dis
would be the right room.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Is that so?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yez, there waz a big sign outside you
door saying, `vacation room'.&quot; The stranger smiled
slyly, the old man could not help himself from chuckling.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Do you understand the terms and
conditions of the contract?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yez. Mr. Gibbons explained it
explicitly.&quot; The stranger leaned over the desk and looked
around secretively. &quot;Is it a parallel world?&quot; He
whispered and looked around again. &quot;Dis is one of my current
theories I am trying to prove. Our universe has become so boring
recently since I discovered it.&quot; He smiled at the old man.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The details are scarce at the
moment,&quot; the old man replied. &quot;But then you can find
out for yourself. Isn't that what you want?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Indeed!&quot; The man answered. &quot;You
know me well, yez?&quot; He looked around again to check that
they were not being watched, which of course they were not so
long as you did not count the curious stares of the books, that
is. &quot;I've been told there is magic in this New World.
Is that true? I would like that, yez? I am so bored with proving
the conventional. I would like to have some fun for a change!
Being a wizard would be much fun, yez?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;There is more magic in this world than
you can shake a stick at!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Wonderful!&quot; The stranger said,
clapping his hands together excitedly. &quot;Where do I sign
up?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Right here,&quot; the old man said
pulling out a piece of paper. &quot;Albert Einstein isn't
it?&quot; the old man asked although he had already written his
name down. For occupation he wrote `Genius' and
`Party animal'. &quot;If you would sign your name right
here&quot; Albert did so, quite excitedly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It is like signing you soul away to the
devil, yez?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Not quite,&quot; the old man replied.
&quot;There's more red tape involved with the devil. He gets
fed up with people breaking their contracts all the time.&quot;
The old man rose from his seat. &quot;Now if you please walk this
way, through this door.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As Albert Einstein got to his feet, the old man
opened the door. Albert quite calmly, with a smile on his face,
walked straight into the darkness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Dark in here, yez?&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;That will soon change, Albert,&quot; the
old man said then closed the door quietly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Oh!&quot; Albert exclaimed &quot;A bright
light. Like the big bang, yez?&quot; There was silence for
awhile. &quot;Oh my! Wwwaaahhhhh - !&quot; <i>POP! Fiiizzzzzz!</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Silence.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man sat down, a warm smile on his face.
&quot;Next, please Gibbons,&quot; he said in a cheerful voice
after feeling buoyant from his encounter with Albert.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There was not even a knock, the door just
opened and someone walked in, hidden in the shadow cast by the
door. The old man narrowed his eyes angrily at the impatience of
this new stranger.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You Hawkins?&quot; the figure asked,
still cloaked in the shadow. It was a young voice, younger than
his last three visitors.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; the old man replied irritably.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Oh. Good.&quot; The voice answered then
seemed at a loss at what to do next.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Close the door,&quot; the old man said
tiresomely with a wave of his hand as he turned his attention
back to the papers on his desk. From the corners of his eyes he
noticed the stranger hesitate then close the door. When he saw
that the newcomer had not moved, he looked up. &quot;Take a
seat,&quot; he offered in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stranger did as he was told and as he
walked into the little light there was in the room, the old man
scrutinised him carefully. He had light coloured hair with a
centre parting that left it hanging over his face like a pair of
curtains. He wore a sort of shirt come jumper decorated in bright
colours, a confusing mixture that was beginning to make the old
man go cross-eyed as he stared at the garment. He noticed that
the newcomer was wearing dark jeans and as he watched the boy sit
down in the seat, noticed a hint of green in their colour.
Gibbons had said that he had found all of the people needed to
fill the four vacant slots. What was Gibbons doing hiring the
last slot to this <i>boy</i>?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Taking the seat, the stranger looked
apprehensively to the old man who slowly leant back to the
accompanying nose of creaking leather as he glared at the young
man. &quot;Tell me. What do you do for a living?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stranger shrugged his shoulders.
&quot;Nothing. I'm unemployed.&quot; He looked a bit
sheepish sat there with his shoulders slightly bunched up. He
looked around the room. &quot;Books. Cool. Lots of
`em.&quot; He was never very good at small talk.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; the old man replied
leaving an awkward silence hovering above the table. The stranger
nodded his head absently sucking at his teeth as he struggled to
think of something else to say.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;That secretary of yours, the ugly one
with broken teeth, wheezy breath and a foul tongue dragged me in
here and told me you were giving away free holidays.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Mr. Gibbons?&quot; the old man
questioned.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It's a man?&quot; the stranger asked
shocked. &quot;Then why is he wearing a dress?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man waved aside the ominous question.
&quot;His parents got confused when he was born and that has left
him with a mental scar. Don't worry, he's quite
harmless.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stranger nodded sheepishly and looked about
the room once more. He caught himself just before he mentioned
how &quot;cool&quot; the books were again. He continued nodding
his head like a fool.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Any future aspirations?&quot; the old man
asked putting his hands into a steeple position.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stranger shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I
wouldn't mind getting a job in the computer industry.&quot;
The stranger replied in a firmer tone of voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Really?&quot; the old man said, a glimmer
of hope in his voice. &quot;Are you qualified?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Not really, well, not for the area I want
to go into.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man nodded and found his hand wandering
towards his desk draw. &quot;And what's your area?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Game programming,&quot; the young man
replied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Hhmmm, really?&quot; the old man found
that he had opened his draw and was already fumbling around for a
contract. &quot;Creative is it?&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yeah, but I'm lacking a good idea at
the moment. I need a game that'll set people alight!
Something to make them buy it in their droves. But I just
can't think&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man pulled out the contract and put it
on his desk. &quot;Well, we have one vacancy left. Do you want to
take it?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I'm not even sure what I'm here
for.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;If I was to tell you that I could take
you to a place that could inspire you, may even give you an idea
for a game. Would you go?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Don't know. How many over people are
going.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Oh, hundreds. Thousands,&quot; the old
man said dismissively. &quot;All like you, creative people
although there are a few there who are not and prefer to destroy
things or just let other people do things for them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Hhmmm. I don't know.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;There's really nothing to fear. We
give you a life insurance, everything. If anything happens to you
then we return you back to the point where you started, perfectly
intact with nothing but a distant memory left of your
experience.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Memory?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes. Like a dream. A dream that may
inspire you into creating that lucrative game you were telling me
about.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I dunno.&quot; The stranger said.
&quot;How long is the holiday?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;As long as you make it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I only popped out to get some milk. My
girlfriend'll get worried if I'm not back soon.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Nothing to fear, I assure you. You can
even bring her along if you like.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;A free holiday? Sounds too good to be
true.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;No obligation I assure you. Just tell me
your name and sign the contract and the rest of the details can
be sorted out behind that door there to the rear of me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Contract?&quot; the stranger, asked
suspiciously.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes. Nothing legally binding, just your
signature to say that I approve of you and you approve of
me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Well&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man smiled. &quot;Trust me, sir. Your
name please?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Paul,&quot; the stranger answered
hesitantly. &quot;Paul.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; the old man said
filling in the rest of the details. &quot;If you just sign
there&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Paul took the pen slowly and looked at the
paper in front of him. He saw the words, yet he did not see the
words. It was hard to explain. He clearly saw where he had to
sign and he clearly saw his name printed in block capitals by the
old man. Impulsively, he quickly signed the contract and handed
the pen back.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Well done,&quot; the old man said
clapping his hands together. &quot;Are you a religious man?
&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Not really, why?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Oh, just asking,&quot; the old man
answered absently. He stood up. &quot;Now, if you follow
me,&quot; he briefly pressed the button on the intercom and spoke
sharply. &quot;Gibbons! Here! Now!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Y-yes, sir!&quot; the wheezy voice
stammered back.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The old man stood up and opened the door that
lead into the mysterious chamber. Just then Gibbons came running
into the room wearing a pink dress with frills on the ends.
&quot;Coming sir! Don't forget me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Er,&quot; Paul said. &quot;It's a
bit dark in here isn't it?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;All will be revealed soon.&quot; The old
man replied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The door closed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Uh now what?&quot; Paul asked,
feeling a little bit intimidated by the tall old man and the
ugly, whort ridden, cross-dresser who started to sign a little
childish song to himself that started to unnerve Paul.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Just wait a moment,&quot; the voice of
the old man replied from the darkness near Paul's side somewhere.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Hehehehehe,&quot; Gibbon's chuckled
shrilly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;I think I want to leave now, thank
you,&quot; Paul said resolutely, feeling out of ease and suddenly
very, very afraid.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Now, now. There's nothing to be
afraid of.&quot; The old man assured him sweetly.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Going home, master!&quot; Gibbons shirked
like a child.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Yes, Gibbons. Home.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Light streamed into the room and Paul found
himself in the centre of it. &quot;Uh!&quot; Paul exclaimed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Not to worry. It's all part of the
contract,&quot; the old man said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Paul had to block out the brilliant light from
his eyes by raising his arm to cover his face. When he was able
to peek over his arm he noticed a long white tunnel with a
swrilly mass of clouds rotaing around its centre. Suddenly he
felt himself drawn into it like his whole body was being drained
down a plughole. &quot;Wwwwwaaaaahhhhh&quot; The world
simply <i>popped</i> around him. His ears tingled from the
explosion - or was it an implosion? - and when he opened them
again he saw a vast landscape of islands and islets stretched out
as far as the eye could see. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">As he somehow travelled across the landscape,
fields swept past him. People worked those fields, roamed them
ploughing up the land. Stone buildings whizzed under him. He came
across a wooden fence that zoomed past he vision. When he looked
back to the direction he was facing, he saw a windmill; its
blades rotating in the wind with a <i>whop-whop</i> sound that
seemed to beat in time with is heart.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Suddenly he was sucked downwards; the windmill
shot past him at neck-breaking speed and the world <em>fizzled</em>
out of his mind. As he lost unconscious, and the world as he had
known it slipped from his mind like a stray thought, he could
have sworn he had seen a sign posted on one of the faces of the
windmill's structure that read in a child like script,
&quot;Welcome to the land of <i>Foundation!!!!!!!!!</i>&quot;
There were more exlamation marks but at that point his mind
exploded and his eyes closed.</font></p>
