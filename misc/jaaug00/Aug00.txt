Hello,
As the school season nears, some of our editors ae finding growing conflicts
with workload.  So, to make a long story short (too late) AIO is in need of
two new Editors.  If you think you can handle our GAMES or UTILS sections,
then please email me at:
 ICanWrite@aio.co.uk
and we'll see what we can work out.

I've received more!

There is an email address at the bottom.

I've emailed this, its probably like my 4th or 5th email
so if they don't remove me i'll have to take more actions.

It is hosted by FreeNetNames, so I could email them but
should I be responsible for the closure of their
account?

I really want them to stop bombarding me with all their
rubbish.

Also, i didn't know anything about them closing down
due to piracy et al. Any place where I can read more
about it?

Kindest Regards

As it's hosted there, they probably don't bother to collect mail (which will

himself.  IIRC, it's quite hard to look things up..  www.realdreams.cz/amiga/
covered it too, without user comments, same at www.amiga.org.

Perhaps next months AIO will have an unbiased report too :)

Thats why i've not read anything about it. I hate website

a nice paper magazine that doesn't cost about =A36 (Amiga

It's been mentioned in AA, as well as being extensively debated on other
mailing lists such as AFB and the AA list for at least the last few months -
I find it very difficult to see how you could be unaware of the situation.

Subject: [just-amiga] Desiderata
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings All...

Not  really  a  subject for any of these lists, but I'm getting a bit
desperate, so, here goes...

I'm  trying  to find the text of a piece of prose called *"Desiderata"*
written by Max Ehrmann in 1927.

The  3 versions I have are all different, either in the odd word here
or there, or in the punctuation, even the layout is different in each
one.

My  local library has not helped, the 2 versions found there have the
same problems mentioned above.

Can anyone send me the definitive words of the above?

Thanks to all in advance.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Hi Tony
I have a copy that I thought was original but if you go to
www.amazon.co.uk get into the book section and put Max Ehrmann in the
search engine you will see a number of books by M.E.
Havn't tried them myself yet. I thought Desiderata was originally
found on an old grave stone. Well you live and learn.
All the best.
Terry

Going along with this off topic subject...and speaking of Desiderata, I too
wouldn't mind having a good copy of that thing.  I have a hilarious audio
tape with a take off on Desiderata entitled, "Deteriorata"  with lines like:
"Fall not in love therefore, it will stick to your face...know yourself, if
you need help call the FBI...let not the sands of time get into your lunch."

Would love to have the original, and the spin-off put side by side..

Don't ask then! :)

BTW, is this possibly a non-English work?  When you find various copies which
have differences it's quite likely to have been translated by various
different people over the years.

Would you rather wave your card details in the faces of a dozen people in a

Why "certainly not online"? It a pretty safe place, especially with a big
beast like Amazon.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi All,

I installed Sensible World of Soccer '96/'97 (The last
official update) a while ago.

I've updated it with the World Cup 1998 unofficial update
and everytime I finish a season under careerer it just goes
black when going round the worlds tables, ALWAYS after
the Faroe Islands league or cup results.

It does this with the official '96/'97 when installed, so
I can never progress past the first season, which was
annoying since i'd just taken Hull City from the third
devision into the second and was about to move to some
swedish team.

Any ideas how I can stop it doing this?

Also, someone knicked my SWOS '96/'97 disks a while ago
and I never got them back. Does anyone have just the disk
they would sell me? I have the box and other bits so just
disks one and two are needed, anyone?

Toodle Pip!

Safe, maybe, but I prefer to support my local bookstore when possible,

Me too. And I don't need a whole book, nor do I have a CCard.

Hi Chris (Excellent name <Grin> ), 

On 06-Aug-00, you wrote:

I am not on AFB or AA due to the huge amounts of emails that
I would never bother to read anyhow.

The fact that I have not seen anything about it means that
there is an inbalance in Amiga magazines, print, web and
other which needs to be re-addressed.

I find the problem with web based sites is you are constantly
needing to visit them to find out the latest news, or in
some cases, find no new news which is slightly disappointed.

You also have to constantly visit these sites which for a
self-confessed lazy person like myself is quite a chore
and one i'd rather not do.

I was a big fan of paper/print magazines as they deliver
a monthly round up of news/articles etc. Unfortunately
due to the closure of many of these the market of readers
like myself are without a magazine, this is where my aim
and goal of AIO (Amiga Information Online) came about.

It is something I have yet not achieved and although I
am not Editor anymore, I will in future hopefully working
closely with the Editor to help it reach its full market
share.

I'd also like to add that i'm totally happy that Caroline
has been kicked out the Bigbrother (UK) house hold! <G>

Kindest Regards

Hello,
ame subject, second post.  Amiga Information Online needs new Editors.  Two
of our present editors will iminently be leaving us due to schedualing
conflicts (ie: school), leaving us with a couple of vacancies.  So, if you
can do either reviews of software Utilities or computer Games, then please

I have smart filesystem installed, and it recently
crashed very violently. There's no way to get the data
back with any sfs tools, but I have managed to get the
block numbers of the most important files with Diskmontools.
However, in diskmontools, there's no option to save blocks back
to other media, and to my big surprise I couldn't find any proper
sw from the aminet. Does anyone know ANY program that can
read blocks and save them?

I'm reasonably sure Dave Haynie's DiskSALV will.

Subject: [just-amiga] network Amiga+PC with Samba
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


Hi,

today I ordered a PCMCIA-network-card for my 1200 (master) to
connect it to my new PC (slave ;). Bevor I have the parts here I
want to make things clear. I took a look at Samba and have some
questions:

Where do I get the SMB-software for the Windows98? Where a manual
what to do with it?

In the INSTALL.AMIGA-readme from the Samba-archive I read the
below-cited - but don't understand it fully. Do I have to include
this in every Miami-Config-file (I have one for every provider I
use) to have Amiga and PC permanently connected *and* to have the
possibility to use different providers? (the PC should access the
Internet over the Amiga)

Could I solve this with Miami or do I need Miami Deluxe? I already
obtained the Upgrade-Code but did not upgrade due to recent lack of
time. Isn't it a lot of work to get the provider-settings from
Miami to Miami Deluxe?

What else should I think of?

-------------------------snip-------------------------
4. Configuring Miami and Miami Deluxe
-------------------------------------
We need to add a few entries to the Miami database, so click on the button
labeled "Database" to make the "database" section visible. Next, click on the
button that appears at the top of the window until it reads "services". Click
on the "Add" button and enter the following:

       Name: netbios-ns
         ID: 137
   Protocol: udp

Repeat this procedure for the following entries:

       Name: netbios-dgm

-------------------------snip-------------------------

Thanks for hints...

Stefan

THAT'S IT! thanks alot! listing devs:clipboards showed:

the "0"-file contains the lines I wanted to get rid of. pretty old
stuff eh? seems to be an Amiga-only problem - Windows-users had to
install the OS several times in between! ;))

   No chance, although DiskSalv is very good (I've found), it can only
recognise OFS/FFS files on a damaged drive, not any other type of

It depends whether you want your Windows98 PC to be a client or server.
Either way, the software comes from your Windows98 CD and is installed via
the network control panel.  Look for "Client for Microsoft Networks" and
"File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks."

How well does Miami handle multiple interfaces?  Ideally it should only run
over your ethernet interface and hopefully you won't be sharing your
resources to the rest of the world over you ppp interface.

You might want to check out the Amiga Samba mailing list.  I don't remember
how I signed up for it exactly but poking around on the Samba web pages may
provide a clue.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello Stefan,

We have a small network of Mac's a couple of PC's and a Linux server 
all of which can connect to the Internet (we also have B2000, 3xA500, 
2xA1200 but none of them are connected to the network)  I can help 
with the PC side at least.



>Where do I get the SMB-software for the Windows98? Where a manual
>what to do with it?

SMB is included with every version of Windows that modern man is 
going to meet, including 95/98/NT  If you can connect to the Internet 
with the PC then it is already enabled and you only need to make a 
few adjustments.

I'll assume you have a network card in the PC that has the drivers 
installed and you can physically connect the two machines together 
with network cable(s)


In the Start->Settings->Control Panel->Network

============================
"Configuration" tab
============================
you should have at least:

   Client for Microsoft Networks (this is the SMB software)
   Network Adapter (i.e. the model e.g. NE2000 or EtherlinkIII or DEC203...)
   TCP/IP (if you have a modem or another network card you will see an 
entry for each one)

If anything is missing use the "Add..." button and choose it from the 
lists.  Now you need to configure the parts, for each one 
double-click it or click it once and click "Properties"

---Client for Microsoft Networks---
Log on to Windows NT domain - unticked
Windows NT Domain - blank
Quick logon - selected

---Network Adapter---
"Bindings" tab make sure TCP/IP is ticked
It's unlikely, but you may have settings under the "Advanced" tab 
that need changing, they relate to the model of network card itself 
so I cannot be specific.  Most modern cards will automatically sense 
the cable type and network speed - don't fiddle if you don't know and 
take a note of the original settings if you think you need to make a 
change.

---TCP/IP--- or TCP/IP > Network Adapter Model (Do NOT configure 
TCP/IP>Dial-up Adapter)
"Bindings" tab
Make sure Client for Microsoft Networks is ticked
"IP Address" tab
Specify an IP address - selected
IP Address - 192.168.0.10 - The last number can be anything between 2 
and 254 (I know you can use 0,1 and 255 but these are often used for 
other things like gateways and broadcasts...)  The IP Address for the 
Amiga network card will be 192.168.0.11 - the first three numbers 
will be the same but the last must be different.
Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0
"WINS Configuration" tab
Disable WINS Resolution - selected
"Gateway" tab
Blank (if you get routing software for the Amiga then this will be 
the Amiga's IP Address)
"DNS Configuration"
Disable DNS - selected (if you get routing software for the Amiga 
then this will need to be enabled)

============================
"Identification" tab
============================
All these settings are up to you, avoid long names and spaces in the 
first two, I don't know the specifications of Amiga Samba, it may be 
based on the old Windows for Workgroups specification and you may not 
be able to connect to the shares easily if they are too long - keep 
it simple first, you can always break it later!

Computer name - Windoze98
Workgroup - Workgroup
Computer Description - A boring PC

============================
"Access Control" tab
============================
Share-level access control - selected


Now go back to:
============================
"Configuration" tab
============================
Primary Network Logon - Windows Logon (if you use the Microsoft 
Family Logon and are happy with it then use that)
Click the "File and Print Sharing" button:
I want to be able to give others access to my files - selected
I want to be able to allow others to print to my printers - selected 
(if you have a printer attached to the PC and Amiga Samba supports 
this - very useful why waste your Amiga's time waiting for a slow 
printer give the task to the dumb PC)

Almost done - click "OK" - lots of clunking and whirring noises a 
possible demanding of the Windows98 CD, and a definite demanding of a 
restart.

After the restart you need to share a folder, and I'll pass you to 
the built-in help:

Start->Help->Search tab and put "to share a folder" (including the quotes)

The Amiga Samba documentation should tell you how to connect to the 
share from the Amiga.

If you get stuck with my instructions use the help with "local area 
network" and/or repost to the list



>the PC should access the Internet over the Amiga

This is going to be a problem because you need to turn the Amiga into 
a router or some sort of proxy server, I don't know what is available 
for the Amiga software wise.  I've tried many options over the years 
but the only one that we've got to work properly is a hardware option 
made by NetGear called a Modem Router.

Windows98 now includes Internet Sharing which is enabled in the 
Network control panel but I have no experience of this in a 
multi-platform environment.

Sorry I can't help with the Amiga side.

Regards

Mike

Hi,
 On Wednesday August 16 2000, Stefan Schulz said to All:

 SS> Where do I get the SMB-software for the Windows98? Where a manual what
 SS> to do with it?

SaMBa is a clone of the Microsoft Server Message Block networking system, so
it's built into Windows 98.

 SS> below-cited - but don't understand it fully. Do I have to include this

Yes, you need it in every config.  An easier method would be to use MiamiDx,
and have each provider configured as a new interface.

 SS> have Amiga and PC permanently connected *and* to have the possibility
 SS> to use different providers? (the PC should access the Internet over the
 SS> Amiga)

 SS> Could I solve this with Miami or do I need Miami Deluxe? I already

This needs MiamiDx - Miami only handles one interface, and you need at least
two (ethernet for LAN and serial for PPP link).

 SS> obtained the Upgrade-Code but did not upgrade due to recent lack of
 SS> time.

Well, just go get the keyfile then! :)

It won't stop you using Miami.  Both can even be installed in the same
directory.

IIRC, it takes about 20 seconds to complete the keyfile generation anyway...

 SS> Isn't it a lot of work to get the provider-settings from Miami to
 SS> Miami Deluxe?

You can import one provider straight away, as MiamiDx's "Load Settings" will
import a Miami.config file.  It's not difficult to then import the rest
manually (write down the settings from Miami, load MiamiDx, create a new
Dialler and Interface).

MiamiDx includes both IP-NAT and a SocksD.  One click to enable each (and

In comparision all the software solutions for Windows and linux are hell to

I installed MiamiDx today but have *severe* problems with
MiamiRegister... :(
I tried everything but could NOT generate a keyfile... MiamiRegister
wants an *email* which includes the Upgrade-Code - but I obtained it
online! Another option reported that the "MiamiDxRegistration"
already has been sent bla bla... any idea?

thanks for the other answers so far...

If only all software was made this way.  I'm afraid I don't have it 
in my heart to give such a menial task to an Amiga.

We didn't find the Windows stuff difficult to set up, just unreliable 
and even with NT they tended to take the whole machine down with them.

Hello Amigans,

site that loads tells me or if it is dead.

 On Thursday August 17 2000, Stefan Schulz said to Neil Williams:

 SS> I installed MiamiDx today but have *severe* problems with
 SS> MiamiRegister... :(

I have thought of something: Holger Kruse's entire computer network has been
damaged, although it should be okay for registering by now.  See the text on
www.nordicglobal.com for more info.

 SS> I tried everything but could NOT generate a
 SS> keyfile... MiamiRegister wants an *email* which includes the
 SS> Upgrade-Code - but I obtained it online! Another option reported that

Hmm..

Starting MiamiRegister, you go to:
 Register Miami(Dx) or create keyfiles from email.
 Submit Miami Deluxe registration.
  -> For this you need the license code you got when you upgraded - the long
number prefixed with XF.

You should soon get an email back.  Save this to disk as-is and then choose
the "Create keyfile from Miami(Dx) Registration".  Select the saved message
when asked and your keyfiles should be generated.

NordicGlobal's registration procedure is difficult and longwinded, but works
eventually.  Let me know if this helps, or doesn't, as the case may be.

I didn't used a tool (dd.lzh) I found from Aminet. Now I have 0.5G of my
broken 3G partition saved to other partition in 20MB blocks.
At least I'm able to restore all my sources, guides etc.

I bought the upgrade code *online* so I didn't get an email! :(
It's XU****************** but can nothing do with it.

Perhaps *somebody who already registered* could send me this email he
got, I replace the upgrade code (which could have altered due to
security reasons :)) with mine and - BINGO (perhaps).

yes?? "please send"!

I felt it necessary to jump in here, I don't use samba at all, in fact you
only need it if you want to do file sharing, and there's even a way around
that....

I've got my a1200 dialed up, a nic hanging from the pc slot, crossover cable
to the pc (win98), all I use is miamidx, for all the net connections (pc
can do web, mail, icq, irc, ftp) if you want to do file sharing in a basic
way, use a ftp server on the pc, and ftpmount on the amiga... Also, don't
forget you'll probably want cnet for the 1200's nic

took me about an hour to get set up the first time, now I reckon I could do
it in abut 7 minutes... big advantage of having the amiga as the gateway,
they're way harder to hack, and I average 2 weeks plus uptime and I use the
amiga nott just as a gateway, but for mail, browsing, ftp, irc, icq,
ftpserver, editing webpages, photogenics all while it's online with 0
hassles...

Regards

Blitzwing

No!  You input that into MiamiRegister, /then/ you get an email.

Open MiamiRegister.  Now.

Click on "Upgrade a Miami [...]"

Follow the instructions on screen.  It will ask you for that XU code
eventually.

After you've entered this code, you get an email, from which you generate your
keyfiles.

I think we're having a language problem here :-(

Erm, no.  The email effectively *is* your keyfile in encoded form; it's not
the upgrade code which you already have.

If someone does send you the email, you can generate *their* keyfiles.  Have
fun.

This is of course the reason why the Amiga didn't make it into 
mainstream office environments...

The people who are paid to support the computers in a company, 
generally specify the hardware and software that is bought for a 
company.  If the software and hardware work, are easy to support and 
easy to set up, then you don't need the support people, so the Amiga 
was never specified.

Cheers,

Mike

Anywhere BUT London suits me :) Not all the Amiga users of
the UK are southeners. Birmingham or even Manchester would
suit me :) Plus i'm sure venues are slightly cheaper.

Something has to be done!

Subject: [just-amiga] Giddy Trilogy ;)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Heya!

Does anyone remember a game called Wibble World Giddy on the Amiga?? If
was a spoof of a certain ovoid character we won't mention ;))

Well, Phil Ruston has just finished Giddy 3 after months of hard
work.... Unfortunately it is on the PC this time but it might be of
interest to any PC and Amiga owners (most of us these days I think
though).... You can download a playable demo from the official site at
http://www.giddy3.co.uk

Amiga only owners cheer up though because we can download the previous
two Amiga games from the site for free... Giddy 2 was previously
Licenseware!

C yA!

Alan

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello all,

Just getting the REMLINES printed, so some may not be getting their copy
until Thursday.  Wanted to remind everyone that there is NOT AN AMIGA SIG
meeting this month as the library room is not available to us.  Mike Bryant
has offered to open his home for a workshop.  You need to call him in
advance (he can be reached through this group) so he knows who to expect and
can give you directions.  If you have a sick Amiga, need some individual help or just
want to spend an afternoon doing Amiga things, this is the ticket.  It is
this Saturday afternoon.  The Amiga SIG for September will be earlier in the
month -- it's all in the newsletter.

Kind regards
JIm

hi,

next problem :((

as soon as the PCMCIA-network-card is connectoed to my 1200er the
whole system runs *extremely* slow! for example YAM takes 10 times
as long to start!

what could this be? is it because I didn't install any driver yet?

Without seeing what MiamiRegister says exactly (I've never upgraded a
registration), I can only suggest that you email Holger Kruse and after
explaining what's happening, ask when the registration system will be working
properly again :(

Same problem here.  The cause is the A1200 not having a working Reset line in
the PCMCIA port, though I don't know why it sometimes causes a gradual
slowdown.  You have several solutions:

1. Get your A1200 "reset line" fixed, as described in the archive for
cnet.device or on Aminet.  There is also a clip-on device sold for this so you
don't need to solder or send your machine away..

2. Reinsert the PCMCIA card after every reset.

3. Load Miami in your user-startup and put it *online* automatically.  This
will cure the slowdown, but isn't an ideal solution -- if Miami doesn't load
fast enough the machine might slow down too much to actually load it...

Subject: [just-amiga] Rollover buttons
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

If anyone has a couple of mins to spare, would you mind having a look at
something I have tried out?

I had a go with Rogobox to generate some JS code to use on my web site. I have
put together 2 pages with rollover buttons, and have tested with Voyager
3.13, AWeb SE and IBrowse 2.2, all seem to understand it.

Now if you folks could just have a look and tell me what you think, especially
anyone *#NOT using a graphics card#*, in case it eats all their memory :)

You will find other images on the pages may not be found, but thats ok.

My site is #http://www.lordofchaos.co.uk/jstest#

This will be the first page, and if you click on the gravesend link, that is
the second one I am testing.

Sorry if you have seen this on other ml's but I havn't had much response yet.



Best Wishes,

Well some do because I didn't get the text in exactly the same place every
time, must do them again.

> but they don't do much when i click on them :(

Some on the Chaos Corner page in the jstest dir will fail, because that dir
dosn't contain all of the other bits needed, but that's no problem. The
Gravesend link should have taken you to the other page with the rollover
buttons, and they should have worked, though again some parts of the
individual pages might no be there.

When I put this onto my main public site they will all work :)

Thanks :)

The rollover images were made from some graphics that I had on a .net magine
cd, these were edited in TVPaint, where I resized them and added the text.

Then I created the JS code with a nice little program by James L Boyd called
Rogobox. This takes most of the work out of it.

If you are interested, Rogobox can be found at Aminet/comm/www/Rogobox.lha.

Replied directly also.

I just received an Amiga 4000 without a keyboard, mouse and (very

replace the lock on the Amiga 4000? I'm also looking for an Amiga 4000
keyboard if anyone knows where to get them.
Thank You.

hi, me again :)

everything (so I hope) had been configured on both the Amiga and PC
side, but a ping showed "100% packet loss" :(

In MiamiDx/Interfaces Ethernet is "Offline" - is this the problem?
I tried to set it "Online" but got:

"Miami Deluxe is unable to open
SANA-II device 'DEVS:Networks/cnet.device' unit 0."

what's the problem?

devs:networks/cnet.device exists...

regards,
Stefan

Hi all

Heh, blowtorch or a hammer and chisel?
:-)

Nah, I aint heard of anyone selling replacement locks for them. in fact if i
owned a computer shop i wonder replace them, cos it kinda looks suss when a
guy comes in with a locked computer and wants a new lock :-)

Maybe a proper locksmith could help you get into it, cos they dont tend to
bother wtf they are unlocking, they just do it :-)

Good luck anyway

 SS> devs:networks/cnet.device exists...

First, reinsert the Ethernet card *with* the machine switched on (it's a
hotplug interface, so no problems doing that).

If it doesn't work then, try a reboot (ensure you have NO Squirrel interface
software on the machine).

Still nothing?  Go back to Hardware->CNet->Parameters and ensure you've hit
Query.

Nothing?  Come back with useful information! ;)

Is the machine locked?  You've tested that it is with an existing keyboard?

If it isn't you can probably make do without the keys... unless you like
banging randomly on the keyboard with the machine switched on.  If it is
locked, open the machine and short out the wires.  Or pick the lock, it uses
the simplest single latch mechanism.

You can buy A4000 keyboards online from www.powerc.com in the UK, or nearly
any Amiga dealer.

1200's, can't they be dumb somwtimes... try this, offline the ethernet,
physically remove the card, plug it back in and try online again, without
rebooting the 1200...

Hi Everybody,

   It's locked? simply open it up, follow the wires from the lock to
the connector on the motherboard, and unplug the lock.
   
   IIRC it's unlocked when the circuit is broken, so that should fix
it. If it's still locked, plug it back in, cut the wires half way and
then join them together.

   If it's /still/ locked then you have a busted A4000, or a busted
keyboard and mouse, probably :( 

See ya :)

    You can just take the case off and the front  bezel has some
plastic snap locks that will let you take it off. Just squeeze the snap
locks and it will come free.  Then all you have to do is remove the
wires from the lock and splice them together. Just leave the lock where
it is. All this switch does is locks the mouse movement . If you can
find a 3000 keyboard, I think it is the same.
    When you get a keyboard and mouse, be sure and check to see if you
have mouse movement or not before you tear into the case.
Regards,
Kenneth

The A4000 has the same keyboard as the A3000, except for one small detail.
Small being the connector. The A3000 uses a standard DIN connector, as seen
on PC/XT/AT keyboards. The A4000, however, uses a mini din connector,
similar to the PS/2 style PC connector. There are adapters available from
Amiga dealers (http://www.merlancia.com) that allow the use of Amiga 3000
keyboards on Amiga 4000 systems. To order a keyboard for your system,
please visit http://www.merlancia.com/amiga/ . The Online Amiga Catalogue
currently lists the Amiga 4000 keyboard as well as others. Other keyboard
alternatives will also be available shortly, including the RedBoard, an
infrared keyboard for Amiga systems. Hope all this helps. BTW: Your
friendly locksmith can help you get a key for the KB lock. It is an ACE
lock key. If you take your system into any Locksmith that handles ACE
locks, he can fabricate a key for it. it it is not locked, forget about it.
Never lock it unless you absolutely positively have to! You might lock it
and loose the key yet! Hope this has ben helpful.

Cheers,
 Ryan E. A. Czerwinski

that works!! I still get a "100% packet loss" *BUT* I recognized
that - as soon as I start MiamiPing - the *BNC* LED on the
adapter starts to flicker, *not* the *Twisted Pair* LED!
(I only use Twisted Pair).

How can this be changed to make use of the Twisted Pair connection?
The LED is ON as soon as I connect the TP-cable to it.

Stefan

Can't help ya there.

mouse 
I have an extra.  This is extrem , but if you want it for free I'll send it to ya (you'd pay for shipping)

> importantly) no key to unlock it.
I have my 4000 open at present and starring at it I ponder in theory.  If the lock dis-connects two wires to lock it then just pull the black and red and replace with a jumper.  But if versa the just pull and leave.

I'm not suggesting you try this but it might work.

On the matter of replacing it, there is a nut on the back of the lock so I see no reason it could not be replaced with one you have the key for.

not sure exactly, as my card auto switch's... make sure there's nothing on
the BNC at all, no terminator or cabling, aside from that it should auto
select, but read whatever manual you have and see if ti tells you anything
about connection selection (ie coax / tp)

I see :)
this works by now, no problem going online with it. btw: could this
be done automatically as MiamiDx is started? Or with ARexx?

ok, I did miss this in the first place. Now I've done it but with no
more success.

Does anything has to be 'started' on the PC side after booting? All
settings should have been made...

ok, I misinterpreted the meaning of the LEDs... there seems to be
no problem there.

Yup. Interfaces-><interface>->Events->Auto-Online.

You can also Auto-Online on the Events page (in the main window) which puts
online whatever is your "default" interface - not recommended though, this is
more a hang-back from Miami.

As long as you have TCP/IP installed and configured on the PC, there shouldn't
be a problem.  Well, I say "shouldn't" but we are talking Microsoft here...

What happens if you try pinging from the PC?  Does the Amiga's net activity
LED flash?

easy, interfaces - go into the ethernet card settings - click events - there

Subject: [just-amiga] Ethernet  Speeds
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi

Recently I installed an X Surf Ethernet card to connect my standard A3000
to a recently purchased 166Mhz PC , 
They are both talking together ok through TCP/IP but transfer speeds
aren't exactly light speed. A 50 Meg file take about 10 minutes to copy
from the p.c. to amiga, according to the P.C I'm copying at 110kb/s which
is too slow. 
 I've tried using Miami with both the X-Surf device and the relevant MNI
driver but not much difference in speed.
I have noticed a reduction in speed if I used an FFS partition instead of
a PFS partition so I assume the slow down is due to the Amiga. Any ideas
please.

The X-Surf card has indeed very varying speed on diffrent setup's
when i first installed my x-surf i used miami+sana2 drivers, got
around 80kb/s :(.. the fastest setting sofar is Genesis+Sana2.
around 6-700kb/s when resiving files, (using miami with MNI i get
450-500kb) But there has been some rummors that you could
get ~800kb/s with MiamiDELUX+MNI and some 'Magic' setting,
duno if they are true thou'

I'm afraid the Amiga is the problem.  My PCMCIA A1200's ethernet ran at
150KB/s on an 030/50, and my A2000 030/25 ran at about the same with an
AriadneII.

I'm not entirely sure where the problem is (the machine should be able to cope
with faster transfers than that) but upgrading to an 040 or 060 gets you up to
the maximum 10baseX speed.

Yep, that was the problem, I think I have sorted it now, in the js source
was..

onClick="return false;"

and I was told it should have been..

onClick="return true;"

So I have changed it all, and I think that has sorted the problem.

If you would like to test it again and let me know the results I will be
grateful for that.

Also corrected a couple of very silly but small errors as well. :)

i also got about 400KB/s on my 030/50 with the Cnet card/drivers so there must be something that's wrong. If you're using the cnetdrivers for that card it should achive more speed than 110KB/s but if you're not using cnetdrivers the software/hardware is probably badly made.

Stupid question: Have you installed fastmem for the turbo card? Otherwise i guess 110-150KB/s is normal.

Is that a PCMCIA card?  They should get around 600KB/s with FTP at /least/.  A
Zorro2 card can deliver upto 900KB/s, depending on what card it is.

My A1200 with 040/40 and PCMCIA runs at 250-300KB/s sustained with Samba and
400-500KB/s with something like FTP or ping (ping -f -s 8100 <fast host>)..

Subject: [just-amiga] BurnIt
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello All,

I am using BurnIt successfully in creating Audio CD's from a single audio
cd source.  Now I'd like to try creating an Audio CD from, let's say, two
or three different audio cd's.  For one example, I want to select various
movements fron the Beethoven symphonies and combine these to create one
audio cd containing these selected movements.

I looked through the rather sparse BurnIt guide but couldn't find any clues
on how to do this.  I have some ideas of my own but I thought I'd ask for
help first rather than try to reinvent the wheel, so to speak.  Anyone on
the list done this?

Harry

Certainly a lot faster than mine, Genisis seems a bit faster than Miami,
but that's a pathetic 160-180 kb/s, Excuse my ignorance on the subject but
I'm copying files through workbench/opus, can I use an FTP program to copy
files directly and if so how do I set it up ?

Greetings All...

I need some help finding a firm named "Totem Graphicsm Inc."

They  supplied  the colour EPS images that came with FinalWriter, but
no address was given in the manual. (At least, I couldn't find one)

These coloured structured images print magnificently and the disk I'm
looking for is "Borders and Accents". I haven't been able to find any
coloured,  fancy, structured border images anywhere, other than a few
(very few) on CD.

I don't have a CD-ROM so they are out of the question for me.

Can anyone help, either with the address or the borders themselves in
EPS format.  TIA

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello everybody,

I am using MUI3.8. But I am  unable to launch many
applications requiring MUI. I get the erro message,
unable to launch mui application.

What may be the cause and the solution ?

   Prehaps it isn't installed right, try re-installing it.

Failing that, get a copy of SnoopDos and then see what error messages
the applications that aren't running give...

See ya :)

Could be anything.  What applications are you launching?  Do they /all/ fail?

Many need seperate MUI modules (called MCCs) installed, check the
documentation to see which.  They're available on Aminet.

Hi,

ISO elements have been on Zeus's to-do list for about 5 months now.. hohum. 
Then again, I'm supposed to be adding background images to the AIO GUI too.

"Spare Time"?  Isn't that mythical? :)

Hello, 

I have many *.mcc installed, at least those required
by the software I use or try to use.

Some software work fine some other not. For example :
MUIexchange, Zoom, Enote, Visualguide, ... Are fine.
But MUIFreeCell, Mahjongtiles, ... don't. Two kinds of
reactions : the first one is a loading, the icon
appear and dissapear, then nothing. the one is the
message saying that it can create a MUI application.

I'd check the version numbers of the .mcc's as some software doesn't check
when overwriting. Also the size of screen could affect things. I had problems
with a 640x256 screen in IB2 prefs. Altered to 640x512 it worked fine.

eGroups spammed us with one URL. You spammed us with three (3) www addresses,
one icq number, one fido address and one email address. =)

(But you, OTOH, didn't shove them all at the beginning of the mail, in CAPS,
with commercial overtones.)

Parts of the Internet are commercialised. Avoid them, and you shall find peace.
