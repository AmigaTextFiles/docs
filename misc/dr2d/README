The files in this archive support the reading and writing
of DR2D, a 2-dimensional structured drawing IFF FORM.  They
are intended to reside in the standard IFF directory structure
created by Commodore.  The new files added are:

	iffp/dr2d.h			DR2D chunks/records
	iffp/obj2d.h			DR2D data structures
	modules/dr2dr.c			Read a DR2D FORM
	modules/dr2dw.c			Write a DR2D FORM
	modules/dr2dutil.c		Needed by dr2dr and dr2dw
	apps/DR2DDemo/DR2DDemo.c	Copies a DR2D file to a
					new name, verifying its
					structure

The changed files are:

	Makefile.SAS
	Makefile.Manx

You will need to replace the standard Commodore makefiles with
these if you want to build.

Note: these files have not been tested with Manx, so be careful.
Note also that these files make heavy use of function prototypes
without any #ifdefs around them; this is my little way of encouraging
people to upgrade their compilers :-)  Besides, I think that those
#ifdefs completely defeat the purpose of function prototypes.

The file apps/DR2DDemo/DR2DDemo is the compiled version of DR2DDemo.c.
Note that it was compiled with the FLT_COORD #ifdef turned OFF; that
means that it converts IEEE single-precision floats to scaled integers
when it reads, and converts them back before it writes.  This is done
without using any floating point libraries: see ieee2flt and flt2ieee
in dr2dutil.c.  If you don't want to do this, just #define FLT_COORD
and rebuild everything (you will need to add a -Lm or -lm to the
Makefile for this to work).
