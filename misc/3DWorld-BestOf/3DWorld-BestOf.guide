Hi!

Talking about LOD reduction I'd like to know where to get more information
about that topic. I'm especially interested in automatic reduction of big
landscapes.

Yeah, this would be fine, just to see how it works. I already tried it, but
there where a lot of warnings and the program did show nothing except the
AmigaScreen and -window.  :/

You could mail it me privately, if you want or post it to the list. Thanks!

But will it get improved/reworked?

No, I think I can wait. It's no problem.

Not in near future, but I think, that sometimes a rework will be done.

Take a look on my web site in the 'Papers' section. There is a paper on
doing real time LOD reduction for displaying landscapes using a system
called ROAM. The site is at www.mc68k.demon.co.uk. Hope it helps.

Subject: PSXPort
From: "benjamin yoris" <byoris@fr.infogrames.com>
Date: Wed, 5 Jan 2000 10:03:04 +0100


Hello,

I received a PSX port (hardware to plug a Playstation paddle on the parralel
port) and tried it with Wipeout. Great !

A 9 Volt adaptor is furnished to plug a 9V battery to supply power to the
DualShock motor for rumbling. All the necessary documentation is provided.

Blittersoft is distributing it and I think programmers should have a look at
it. Imagine Shogo making your pad rumbling when you're hurt !

The software is a psxlowlevel.library which emulate the CD32 pad and patch
the lowlevel library, so you need to use it to be able to play with PSX pad.
For example it's impossible to use the PSX pad for Turrican or other oldies
adressing directly to the hardware.

Frieden Bros, Sam Jordan and other coders : what do you think about this
idea ?

Regards,

Ben Yoris

Subject: StormC vs. VBCC
From: AHippauf@t-online.de (Andreas Hippauf)
Date: Wed, 08 Dec 1999 13:34:50 +0100

Hi,

Our game LightForce progressed well. Now we want to transfer it from
VBCC-developing to stormc. But the linker of stormc
tells the following:
linker fehler (means error)
symbol "_glppcBase" not defined (Hint "_glCopyTextSubImage3D").
...rmesa_ppc.lib symbol _glppcBase hint _glCopyTexSubImage3D

linker error: Symbol "_gluppcBase" not defined (Hint "_glGetString").
...rmmesa_ppc.lib symbol _gluppcBase hint _gluGetString

linker error: Symbol "_glutppcBase" not defined (Hint
"_glutPostWindowOverlayRedisplay").
...rmmesa_ppc.lib symbol _glutppcBase hint
_glutPostWindowOverlayRedisplay

I already added the following libraries to the project:
storm603.lib
ppcamiga.lib
Mesa_PPC.lib
MesaGLU_PPC.lib
stormmesa_ppc.lib

Our game uses glut, but I can not find a specifc glutlibrary in the
stormmesa-developer archive. I read the docs, that came along with it
and copied all the includes and lib-files to stormc-directories, but it
still does produce those 3 errors... Why? What is missing?
Can anyone help me?

Thanx in advance,

I guess that you have downloaded the stone-aged StormMesa 2.0
distribution, which even doesn't support Warp3D. Please visit
the 3DWorld pages and download the dev package there.

I just went to H&P Site and downloaded it from there again. But seems I
already have this archive installed. Sadly, dev-packages itself does not
tell, which version it is...
Which URL should I use instead?

You seem to have both dev packages and have mixed all libraries of
both packages together as it seems.

All you need to do is adding 'stormmesa_ppc.lib' to the project
(as you have already done) plus the standard libs which are always
included. The stubs for GLUT are included in stormmesa_ppc.lib.
The actual implementation of GL, GLU and GLUT are shared libraries,
which are in LIBS: (aglppc.library, algluppc.library, aglutppc.library).

And furthermore, make sure to select the 'indirect data' model in
the compiler menu. As far as I remember there is no support for
small data model and StormMesa currently available.

Yes, they are there and work fine with vbcc during compiling and
run-time.

Thanks! That was the problem! Now it compiles well with stormc!
But it crashes immediatly after starting. I tried some demos that 
came along with the archives, those compile and run well.
Very strange. I cant see any difference in configuration of those demos
and my programmes (compiler, linker and all other settings in stormc).

Funny or better very very strange thing:

my game now crashes with vbcc, too! 
But not at once, but while initializing and setting up the displaylists
for the objects! It took me some time, to find this out.
Funniest (strangest?) thing:
it only crashes with vbcc when hardware-acceleration is on!
On my CV64-3D it runs (but ugly and slow!) in any 8Bit or 16Bit mode.
15Bit crashes when creating displaylist.

As I have not changed the part of the programm concerning the
displaylists, I am somehow confused. 

I now guess, it is somehow affected by the wipeout installation!
Can that be? As far as I remember the crashes and the installation where
at the same time... Do I need an other linklibrary for warp3D now?

 Andreas

having a 4 dimensional matrix allows you to not only specify the attitude=
 of
coord system, but also its translation. I personally do rotation and
transformation conversions separately as at the start I didnt understand
it. element(4,4)=3D1 is so because (i think) it acts transparently when
multiplying matrices together.

If i now understand it corrently w will translate coords in a vector sort=
 of
way.

not sure, check against this

note that  the rules of matrix math is not the same as everyday math. for
example A=D7B!=3DB=D7A

in a two 2d matrix:
A=3D|a b|   B=3D| e f |=20
     |c d |       | g h|


C=3DA=D7B you multiple the rows on the left with the columns on the right=
. thats
the rule. and its looks like this.
   =3D|ae+bg  af+bh|
   =3D|ce+dg  cf+dh|

                             (if it was C=3DB=D7A the first element would=
 be
(ea+fc) ie different)

the method is similar with other dimension matrices ie an element is like
some row.column

> 4.But my most important question is: how I calculate the co-

you have some matrix M which will rotate a vertex, v1 (a single column
matrix). The new vertex is u1=3DM=D7v1=20

       |a|
   v=3D|b|
       |c|

The matrix M can be reused without modification to rotate any other verte=
xes
in whatever shape you wish to rotate.

you talk about an object matrix - perhaps this describes its view point. =
To
rotate it you do NewObjectMatrix=3DM =D7 ObjMatrix you can then obtain a =
vertex
by doing this:
u=3DNewObjectMatrix=D7v

iteration should continue the rotation.

I hope that helps. if interested I could send you some matrix maths code.=
 it
only works with 3=D73 matrices though, not 4=D74.

something about matrices which might be baffling to beginners:
a b c
d e f
g h i     h is element (3,2) not (2,3) or (2,1) as you might have expecte=
d -
that used to confuse me.

The special version of W3D should be backward compatible in theory.
I have no explanation for problems which only pop up with the special
version.

Well, do all those StormMesa demos work? There are quite a few which
use display lists. If anyone finds a GL demo not working anymore with
the special W3D version, please let me know.

Yes, sorry. I should have wrote 3.0. My mistake!

Practically, it seems to have problems. But most demos did still compile
and run with stormc. I will have to search for some which use
displaylists.

- Calculate the spectrum of matrix A (get all eigenvalues and eigenvector=
s)
- Calculate the eigenvalues of matrix B with lambdaBi=3DlambdaAi^n
- Construct matrix B from the eigenvectors of matrix A and LambdaBi ..

Of course it is assumed that matrix A is regular.

Well, usually university projections stop after the v->y assignment. The
projection of the x and y coordinates is a simple division by z (or a
multiplication by 1/z in this case).

A normalisation of Z Coordinates in a very obfuscated, from-the-book way.
kzen is the Center of the Z range. It basically brings z into the range
+/- 1 around the center.

I would rather have a look at the engine demo, the code is much cleaner.

The homogenous coordinate W that is usually used in 3D graphics does not
have too much to do with that used in Warp3D. You should simply set the W
coordinate to something like n/z, where n can be almost anything greater
than 1 (say, n=10.0), but you have to make sure this is the Z from the
camera space, i.e. before perspective projection.

If you are thinking OpenGL'ish, you can actually use 1/w as the W
coordinate.

If you still have problems, you might want to wait for the Release of
MiniGL, this encapsulates all the dirty stuff like transformation, texture
management, double/triplebuffering, perspective-corrected mapping, and a
few other things. It will probably be released this months...

No, there is no camera involved, so the view vector is basically always
(0,0,1)'

It doesn't allocate any colors in the sense of obtaining a pen or so.
Textures are almost always RGB true color, either 15, 16, 24 or 32 bits.
Currently no driver uses paletted textures (the virge because it doesn't
support them, the Permedia because you would have to reload the entire
palette each time). You can pass in paletted data, but that will get
converted by Warp3D...

In my course we used a 4x4 unit(?) matrix with m34=1/d, and m44=0.  I've
been finding it hard to relate from what you've done in warptest to what I
did at university.

I'll take your word for it on that one :)

Okay.  What difference does the value of n make then?

I've never used OpenGL :)

There may be a slight problem with waiting.  The project I'm working on is
for university and I need to work on it all the time.  I've done all the
fairly easy foundation work, now I need to get on with the 3d gfx side of
it.  My deadline is around about May or so, so every second counts.  I'll
definately look at your MiniGl when it's released as I'm sure it'll be
infinitely better than anything I can come up with, but in the mean time, I
need some concrete work done.  Of course, if you want to send me a 'beta'
distribution of MiniGL I won't complain ;)

Nope, what I meant was that at the moment, no matter how I define my
shapes, I only get to see one surface of it.  For example, I've defined a
cube, but can only see one face.  I assumed that this is because I haven't
done any perspective projections on it yet.  Now you've mentioned lathe and
sweep I'll have a look for them as they may be useful :)

Essentially what I'm getting at here, is what happens when I want to draw
graphics on the screen that aren't done with Warp3D, is there a way of
making sure it doesn't 'steal' all the pens or is that pretty unlikely
anyway?

Thanks for the help so far,

Tom

Well, you will basically have to write down the
matrix-vector-multiplication to get to about the same thing... Well,
similar :)

None, it is more or less a relative value. You will have to make sure that
the n is always the same, then everything will be fine... Of course, the
choice of n will affect fogging...

You really should, it's *such* a neat API :)

It currently does not completely compile since I am adding stuff for the
Shogo renderer...

Do you do backface culling? It might be that you are doing something wrong
there, or your Z range is so small that the object collapsed to just a
plane...?

Warp3D does not allocate any pen. It works on a 8 bit display, but only
uses the palette it finds. Most of the neat effects, like shading, will
not work on 8 bit anyway... You should use 15/16 bits where possible...

The matrix is regular, I think I'll be able to consult textbooks from here

Date: 12 Jan 2000 2:5:31 +0000

Hi there,

Well things are progressing slowly on my 3d project.  I discovered that my
code kept crashing when I called lock hardware as my OS3.5 install had
screwed up both my WarpUP installation and Warp3D.  Now I've sorted that
out I've actuallt managed to get to the point where I can draw something to
the screen.  Yay!!!!

The only problem is that any shapes I define are getting viewed flat. I'm
sure that this is due to a complete and utter lack of a 3d perspective
projection on my behalf so I delved into the warptest.c file for the 100th
time to get a quick and dirty solution.  Not so it seems.

I'm very confused by some of the funtions it uses, not least is the
Project() call which is as follows:

void Project(Vector3 *v)
{
    if (v->z == 0.f) v->z+=0.0001;
    v->iz = 1.0/v->z;
    v->x = 320+SCALE*v->x*(v->iz);
    v->y = 240-SCALE*v->y*(v->iz);
    v->z = ((kzen/v->z)+z0)/65536.f;
}

This doesn't seem to a projection as I've learnt it at Uni.  The most
confusing part is the v->z assignment which is based on the somewhat
bizarre constants kzen & z0 which are defined as:

const float Back  = 40.0;
const float Front = 0.5;

#define kzen (-65535.0*(Back*Front)/(Back-Front))
#define z0   ( 65535.0*Back/(Back-Front))

What on earth is this doing?

Other strangeness is that it would seem that the homogenous coordinate 
system I was taught isn't being used.  If I did a 3d engine using
homogenous coordinates how would this reflect on Warp3D?

Additionally, I presume that there is no view vector normalisation as we
are looking straight at the object.  Is this correct?

Has anyone got any pointers as to how I can turn my somewhat flat shapes
into glorious 3d-o-vision??

On a slightly different tack - how does Warp3D allocate it's texture colours?
Is it up to the user to do so?  If not, is there a way of restricting the
colours it allocates?

Cheers for any info,

Tom

Hi there,

Can anyone tell me why if a enable perspective mapping in my Warp3d
program the textures don't get displayed as they should (most of the time
they don't get displayed at all!).  Everything works fine without
perspective mapping enabled.

Oh and BTW - I just got the Wipeout2097 demo on the latest AFCD.
Congratulations to all those involved as I was pretty bowled over.
I'm afraid I won't be buying it though as I played it to death on the psx.
I was particularly impressed by the fact that there is no popup!!

I'm looking forward to Heretic 2 now which I *haven't* played at all!  I
may have to get more memory though if the posts I've been reading are true.
I though 50meg would do me fore anything :)

Hi, me again :)

So does the BVision support zbuffering or what?

When I call W3D_AllocateZBuffer() it returns with a success, but no matter
what value I put in ZCompareMode it still draws absolutely nothing when I
enable the ZBuffer state!  This is also very apparent in WarpTest as
whichever mode I select the shape doesn't get drawn.  I'm also somewhat
confused as to the necessity of the various read & write zpixel functions.
Does warp3d actually do all the calculations for you or not?

I would guess your w coordinates are wrong. You should try setting them
all to 1, this will look like linear mapping; if it doesn't, then there's
some other problem which would be hard to solve without looking at your
source code...

I'm afraid to say that Heretic II requires at least 64 Megs. The original
version only ran in about 100 MB, since the PC programmers tend to be fond
of virtual memory, but the current Amiga version was optimized for 64
megabyte machines...

Normally, you'll have to do two things to use the Z-Buffer: Allocate it
(you did that), and clear it to an appropriate value. For "normal"
Z-Buffer operation, you would clear to 1.0 (which is the far plane), and
set the compare mode to LESS or LEQUAL. Then, off course, the Z
coordinates you put into your vertex structure msut be sane, or you won't
see anything.

Concerning WarpTest: You can push the Z-Buffer clear value around with
some keys (was it +/- on the num-pad ?). If you set it to around 0.7, you
should be able to see the effect by rotating and moving the plane. If not:
Oups!

The Z-Buffer read/write functions, btw, are only used to manually access
the Z-Buffer or write stuff into it. You can for instance use the
information to find the z-depth of a pixel on screen. Some ego-shooters
use this (Half-Life, IIRC).

PopUp is an unwanted effect on the PSX, when a polygon get drawed that you can

No, it's also possible with other hardware, even in software rendering.
The problem pops up (so to speak :) when you do not draw "deep" enough.
Normally, you would draw far-away polygons only if they cover a certain
pixel-area on the screen. In racing games, you draw everything up to a
certain distance. But, if polygons beyond this distance are already very
large when they come into view, they appear to pup up suddenly. This is
not only related to the playstation. Many games try to hide that by
fogging, to reduce the viewing distance, or (to stick to racing games) by
making the tracks very curvy, so you don't see far ahead.

All the vector/matrix/triangle code is ripped straight out of warptest I'm
afraid.  I.e. w=v.iz=1/v->z so I don't really know what's happening.  I've
tried changing it to 1 and it did /something/ i.e. most of the textures
seemed to be a few pixels stretched over the surface instead of displaying
the whole texture like it did before.

Done and done (now).  Very peculiar behaviour now.

I basically have a pyramid revolving around the origin.  Values for the
vertices are set at -1,0 or 1 depending where it is, scaled as per
warptest.  With the zbuffer allocated and cleared to 1 the first triangle
gets drawn, then as it revolves all the faces disappear and only the actual
edges connecting each vertex gets drawn.  All the z values are scaled
between 1 & 0 as per warptest also (I've done checks for this), infact,
after further tests they range between 0.76 & 0.86 so everything is in order
there!

Very peculiar!

Oh, hang on, does warp3d's z buffer algorithm only tell you what surfaces
are partially hidden/hidden and leave it up to you to draw the triangle or
not?  My understanding of it is that it actually deals with surfaces on a
pixel by pixel basis and does the correct surface rasterisation for you.
Is this correct?  Coz that ain't happening!

I think that's an 'oups' then :) Doesn't matter what value I set for the

Urm.  Well, to be honest comparing the psx version to how it appears on my
system, I'ld have to say I prefer the psx version.  That's only because 
it's faster.  Technically I'ld say the amiga version was better.  In
640*480 it looks so much nicer than the psx version.  You have to bear in
mind that I have the bottom of the heap ppc system so I don't think it's
fair to say!  On a top speed 604 it would rock and as for G3/G4 - OH MY
GOD!!!

>> I was particularly impressed by the fact that there is no popup!!

>What is "popup"????

Popup basically, is when shapes just appear from nowhere.  It's to do with
how far you can see ahead of you (draw depth).  A very shallow draw depth
would mean that parts of buildings or whatever get drawn visibly later than
nearer parts.  I think that's it anyway.  Basically, it's one of those
things that if you see it, you know it :)  Perhaps someone else could
explain better :)

G'day all,
           I have been looking at the OpenGL Tutorial at

great if someone could make the source code Amiga friendly.  I know all the

i am sure many other amatures) would find this a great tutorial to learn

Just a beginners thought.

Here is a little aritice that is based on an interview with John
Carmack, coder of the Doom and Quake series amoung others. I finally got
some OCR software for my miggy and so scanned it in.

BTW, anyone wondering about copyright: it's okay to copy stuff if it's
for educational/discussion purposes (as this is) and you don't copy too
much. This was taken from Edge magazine:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Future Of 3D: John Carmack's Theory of Everything

*The holy grail of theoretical physics is the Grand Unifying Theory*

   lnslead of today's rag bag of equations explaining the behaviour of
sub atomic particles, gravity, relativity and magnetism, physicists are
searching, seemingly in vain, for an elegant solution for describing
them all. Simple solutions to complicated problems appeal to
anyone with a mathematical mind. And John Carmack is
proposing his own unifying theory to sort out the potential
nightmare of the upcoming shift to new graphical technologies. But
it is politics rather than practicalities that stand in his way. What he
called 'the golden age of triangle rendering' is rapidly
drawing to a close. Success so far has come by apeing a Silicon
Graphics machine on a ten quid chip. Carmack recalls that early
critics of the texture-mapping polygons taken from Silicon Graphics
said it would make every game look the same. "What saved
creativity was blended effects," he says "lnstead of relying on the
APl to do every effect, you composite multiple times through the
APl." For example, you might texture a car model then apply a light
map then bump mapping and specular effects By combining
simple operations you can make a more complex, attractive visual.

   Some upcoming improvements in 3D graphics rely on these
methods. Fully dynamic lighting systems with shadows and stencil
buffers are already achievable if one targets the best cards alone.
And full texture coverage, enabling artists to forego the crude
texture compression of repeated textures for full creative freedom
will come with widespread adoption of DVD. "The geometric
extension of that is a voxel based setup where you're dealing with
surfaces and analytical definitions," says Carmack "you say 'I want
a hole in that wall' chip, chip, chip or 'I want to bevel off this
edge'." Carmack explains that it's harder to innovate with geometry
"When all we cared about was the CPU, we had complete freedom
to choose whatever algorithms we wanted. But now, if you do
brilliant CPU code but you leave 2GigaOps sitting on the table
because you're not utilising the 3D accelerator, that's not a good
engineering decision." Break away from the existing CPU does
polygons/card-does-textures partnership, say with voxels, and you
throw away almost all your filtering capabilities. But worse still, the
CPU/3D-card combo itself is running out of steam because the
CPU's bus can't shuffle data into main memory fast enough to
keep up with the accelerators' polygon handling or even the CPU's
own floating point processors. "On hardware coming out later this
year, you could get a four times improvement in your triangle rate if
you could avoid pumping any vertexes through the CPU," Carmack
estimates. Geometry acceleration is therefore a 'no brainer' and it
seems the 3D card vendors agree. The trouble is it will produce the
biggest upheaval in PC graphics since 3D cards first arrived on lhe
scene. "My current crusade is setting things up for when geometry
accelerators are the primary factor," says Carmack "Instead of
pumping polygons through the CPU, you're going to want to de-
couple all surfaces from touching it, just the way we have textures
now. No current API, not D3D or OpenGL has what you need
to decouple everything. Vertex buffers or display lists are fine for
dealing with static geometry, but in games we've got obvious cases
where the geometry cannot currently be accelerated." But what
worries him isn't so much what other programmers decide is best
NURBS, skeletal systems, voxels or whatever but that by trying
to cater for everyone, any APl will be fundamentally hamstrung.
3D graphics in games could be set back years. Carmack says his
research led him to realise that all new techniques are special
cases of what he terms "a general compositing architecture for
vertexes." In other words, just as almost anything can be done with
textures, so programmers should be able to implement their
preferred engines through multiple API calls. "All of these things
people are talking about - curved surfaces, subdivision surfaces,
morphed frames, higher goal skeletal models - You can synthesise
them if this one simple operation, the act of compositing on the
vertex path, can be added to the API. The current geometry
pipelines do not have any way to composite operations," he
says. "They're fixed function. You feed it in one end and you get
it out the other, and there's no chance for looping or modifying
through there. I just wish I had more time on all these things
because this is important," he adds quickly "The nice thing is
that everyone who is presented with it understands it, but it's in
kind of a different direction. I really need to sell Microsoft on it.
Everybody listens to John Carmack's advice, but it's another thing
to make a scary hardware architectural decision for the future
based on what one game developer thinks."

I already have the Developer V1.1. Pretty old isn't it? I have to order

Currently I am studying the AutoDocs of the NDK_3.1, because my information

I think it's down to cost, you can have massive 3D performance from a
custom chipset rather than a more general CPU. I think Carmack has the
right idea, you need to build decent geometry processing into chips.

Yes, that's the current situation.  I just wonder how long the
"massive 3D performance" advantage will last, given the exponential
rate at which general purpose CPU performance is improving.  It took
about 5 or 6 years for general purpose CPUs to overtake 2D custom
chipsets.

>I think Carmack has the
>right idea, you need to build decent geometry processing into chips.

Maybe that's what will happen.  The custom chipset could fulfil a
different role.  But does geometry processing really require more

Hello,

Here I am again, with a few questions.

1.I have for a matrixfor an object, in the beginning similar to
the identity matrix:
     x      y      z      w   
    1.0    0.0    0.0    0.0
    0.0    1.0    0.0    0.0
    0.0    0.0    1.0    0.0
    0.0    0.0    0.0    1.0

BTW, when it is necessary to add that w-value? What exactly
represents the w-value .I still don't got it...:/

2.Now I have a rotation-matrix, e.g. for a rotation around y:

     x      y      z      w
   cos(a)  0.0   -sin(a) 0.0
    0.0    1.0    0.0    0.0
   sin(a)  0.0    cos(a) 0.0
    0.0    0.0    0.0    1.0

'a' is the rotation-angle in degrees(right?)

3.Now I have multiply the objects-matrix with the rotation-
matrix. Every single value with his companion(?) in the other
matrix, i.e. objmatrix.m[0][0] with rotmatrix.m[0][0] etc.
(right?)

4.But my most important question is: how I calculate the co-
ordinates of a single vertex of a cube (example!) out of the
resulting object-matrix?

But first I have to know, if my assumptions are right.

Thanks in advance...

Regards,

     Micha

It's the homogenous value (yeah, that explains it all :/ ) This is a
rather complex matter, and you'd be best off if you look at some text on
homogenous coordinates at some web site. Basically, it's used because you
can't describe translation or projection with a 3x3 matrix, so you use 4x4
(which can describe both), and project back to 3D by dividing by w...

No, it's radiants (a full circle is 2*pi). You cen get from degrees to
radiants by r = a * 180 / pi-

No, unfortunately, it's not that easy. Given matrices A and B, you
calclate M = A*B by

	m[i][j] = A[i][0]*B[0][j] 
                + A[i][1]*B[1][j]
                + A[i][2]*B[2][j]
                + A[i][3]*B[3][j];

You multiply the vertices by the matrix you get. This is done by assuming
that the vector is a one-column matrix, and calulating M*v (just drop the
[j] above, and assume A=M, B=v, and m is your result).

Of course, you still have to project the resulting vertices to the screen
(usually by dividing throug z and multiplying with a distance value).

Have a look at the engine source code, it has most of the stuff in it:
in vecmat.c, ther function vm_mat_x_mat multiplies to matrices, and the
stuff in 3d.c is basically what you need to build a viewing pipeline
(including clipping...)

Or I just a book about 3D-programming. In the 3D-World-FAQ are named three
books. But they are a bit expensive, so what is the best one?

This formula I already needed some time ago in POVRay...

My brain hurts! ;)
No it's ok, although I am a bit scared about this part of 3D-programming ;)

I have missed this! It's indeed a great idea.

But the way I thougt is right?? I mean to use AllocBitmap() of gfx.lib?
Dunno whether i should use BFM_DISPLAYABLE or not (or is that AGA crap..??)

Fine..! Thought so, but i had to ask ;)

Ok, i do a lock before all rendering and unlock after finishing the frame to
avoid unnessecary context swiches, although i read that i should do just a
few polys... but i can't see any problems with my engine until now
(rendering objects with more than 20000 polys.. 8)

Yes, here's the point were I cancel my project ;) (until u find a way..
maybe u read my ideas in the reply to the Mark Olson mail...)

I have my own experience with this... I know that 3-4 context-switches more
or less aren't real problem, but i've written funny effect with a 'bout
1000poly-scene which i redisplayed in a factor 4 smaller moving window (by
multiplying all vertex coordinates by 0.25..)... The problem was that i
wanted to save cpu-time by drawing every poly and the change the scissor to
the smaller window, rendering it's pendant into the small window, and
rechange the scissor to the old values... framerate dropped from 30fps to
less than 1fps (because i didn't knew that scissor-change needs a context
swich to tell the 68k-side the changes (i think!)) So i rewrite the routine
to render the whole scene and the recalculate it completly (ppc is soo fast
;) to draw it again to the little window 8). So i just get 2fps lower
('bout 28..) for the drawing overhead, what i could accept..... now
everything workx well 8))

Bah, better than the permedia... ok, there r better ones today, what I just
wanted to tell is that the fillrate of the permedia really isn't high
enough to what the ppc could handle and in polys and even bring over that
slow bus, i mean put another gfx chip with more mem on the bus we have, and
we could have capable 3d-environment... (surely, just as long as there is
no need for massive texture swaps...)
Shame, that there is no plan to bring better gfx-boards to the
cyberstormppc/blizzardppc... I don't need G4 card ATM and i even got no
money for it, but I would give 300$ for real capable gfx-board in my
cyberstorm slot 8)

Hi,

could ne1 here tell me how to alloc a bitmap and make sure that it is
located in gfx-mem to render a scene into it and then use this bitmap as an
envmap... which steps have to be performed in which way...

my idea is:

1st use AllocBitmap() of gfx.lib with flag BMF_DISPLAYABLE (is this enough
to be sure that it's in video mem) to allocate the bitmap to render in...)

2nd Create a seperate context with W3D_CreateContext() with that bitmap as
parameter (is it possible to keep 2 W3D_Context's in W3D?)...

3rd Render the scene into the bitmap (has the bitmap to be locked for
that?)...

4th use W3D_AllocTexObj() with tag W3D_ATO_IMAGE containing pointer to the
bitmap to get a valid texture-object to render with.. (main question: if
this is possible, will Warp3D recognise that the bitmap is already in
video-mem, will Warp3D just create a W3D_Texture struct containing a
pointer to the original bitmap, or will it be copied to another place in
Video-mem (maybe with a new format (i wanna use ARGB1555)) and if so, will
Warp3D be 'intelligent' enough to use on chip blitter to copy or does the
processor??)

5th Render the main scene with the former created texture as envmap...

I know I could test that all alone, but i'm lazy, and I don't wanna spend
day's of testing things just to see that the things i wanna do don't work
or give a too massive performance lost... 8)

So my question to the experts is: Is it possible to do what i described
above, and if: how and what speed loss do i have to expect (in fact how
many context switches does it take and how will Warp3D handle the fact that
the bitmap to be used as envmap is already present in video mem)

Hope for help to get my demo-project interesting ;)
Everything is useful, even if u could tell me where to find code-fragments
of for e.g. rendering in a window, whatever... 

Thx,

You can't be really sure about it, that's one major flaw of the current
way bitmaps are handled. At least it should be guaranteed for P96
and with CGFX 4 if the bitmap cache feature is enabled (the latter case
should also apply to CGFX V3 CVPPC/BVPPC).

You can have multiple contexts.

Sure, every drawing operation must be executed inside locked state.

Now it seems as we have a problem. I currently don't see how to do this
in a clean way, because texture uploads are always done with the CPU.

Some 3D devices also have separate texture and framebuffer memory, such
an operation simply wouldn't work then. Therefore it would be necessary
to draw the texture into an existing texture object, but currently
there is no such mechanism present. Might be worth to think about
adding such a feature in future.

Don't overestimate context switches, it still seems that most people
see these switches as main performance problem, but usually they aren't.
The problems here are different.

I think that would put it in Chipmem (see fx. The Morning Trip by
Loonies(lns-tmt.lha), with cgfx planes2fast it sure shows some funny things as
it is an aga intro.)

Sure, it is possible.

I think a call to W3D_LockHardware is enough.

Just make sure that W3D texture auto handling(or whatever it is called) is
turned off, and you free and reupload the texture after each rerender.
Also, ofcourse render the scene and have all textures in same pixelformat, as
converting else would take too much cpu-time.

>5th Render the main scene with the former created texture as envmap...

Go ahead :)

Uploading a texture to the gfxboard each frame IS slow. Thats the price you
will have to pay. Or wait till P5 can finally manage to make a gfxboard bus
that is just a little fast.

Hmm, maybe i'm wrong here,but I heard the reason why not render-direct to
the textures image-data (using processor for e.g. to render sorta plasma
effect or whatever..) is that textures could be stored in another format
than the original in video-mem... btw. I wrote effect that renders
prozessor-plasma in 128x128 texture in fastmem and upload it each frame,
there's no need to turn auto-texmanagment off, coz it just means that
texture is not uploaded directly after a W3D_AllocTexObj() call... W3D just
swaps textures during the rendering of one frame which makes no problems in
this case... but that was not my question... I'm interested in W3D's
behavior if the texture is already in video-mem which offers sum special
possibilities (which in fact mustn't work with actual W3D, that's what I
wanna know..) for e.g. it would be nicest if W3D recognises the fact that
texture is in vidmem and just sorta 'wrap' texobject structure around the
existing texture by using pointer to it... or also nice if it uses the
onboard-blitter of permedia chip (if thingy got such..) to put it another
place in vidmem (which should be MUCH faster because it avoids processor
double bus-accesses ;)

Yes, uploading a texture from fastmem over fu**in p5 bus IS crap, i did my
experiments with this... In fact i spent 2 days with my nice plasm-routine
just to see that it just workx with one 64x64 texture without significant
speed decreases... (where the plasma routine itself derived from an older
ppc-effect of mine could fill at least a 320x240 screen in realtime
(640x480 workx too at 'bout 20fps... and ppc itself should have no problem
doing a plain fastram-fill of 800x600 in descent speed... ))

when will p5 hear our scream for accurate bus speeds and 3d-chips with much
higher fillrates... 604e+agp+32megVoodoo2 could be such nice
opengl-environment... 8(

Usually W3D_Triangle fails, if the destination bitmap has been swapped out
of video memory. Might indicate video memory shortage or some dirty programs
running in the background. Try reducing your workbench size/depth, try
reducing texture memory, try removing background programs.

If you still can't solve the problem, please reply privately.

Try www.gamasutra.com, and look through the archives, they had an article
about lightmaps. A very good article can be found on
http://members.home.com/milod, under game tech (in Color and lighting).


Basically, it's a second texture that is applied to the
same triangle in a special way, namely the texture values are multiplied.
A special blending mode is normally needed, which isn't available on any
Amiga board, but the "normal" alpha blending (source, 1-source) can also
be used with monochrome lightmaps. The topic is very complex, but the
Gamasutra article explains it rather well..

Normally, lightmaps are precalculated (and in QMap, you don't have dynamic
lights). You'll either draw them in a second pass, or you can build the
textures in a cache. There are other difficulties involved here, for
instance a texture may repeat on a polygon, but a lightmap is always
intended to be stretched over the whole polygon. Look at this Color and
lighting stuff, it even has some code in it..

Ok, let's assume i've understand this lightmap-crap... and let's assume i've
got a way to precalculate the lightmap's in QMap (what the original source
does in any way...) but i see no possibility to draw bigger surfaces with
repeated textures and steched light(alpha-)maps in one pass i.e. give the
texture and the alphamap different u/v-coordinates... u know help (a second

I just noticed some lightofs(offset?) entry in the readbsp.c module but
that's not my problem here...
that's why i said let's assume i have a way deriving the lightmap's out of
the .bsp file (and store them as chunky8 in an let's say alpha_buffer for
the normal texture (that's what i planned because i've understood u'r last
mail as it's possible to use alphamapping for monocrome faked
lightmapping...)).
And that's my Question: Is it (or is it not) possible to stretch the
alphamap exactly fitting a poly (better rectangle) by using repeated normal
textures. Could be we should discuss this problem in german, cause i didn't
really know if i could make my point of view clear here...

What's KAGE? And i haven't yet understand how this texture caching should
work an what's the advantage...
Maybe this is what i have to understand...

That's what i saw very early when i did my own experiments on warp3d, since
the permedia isn't capable to do rather uncomplex scenes in 640x480 at
acceptable speed (35fps+) what a shame looking for my pc/voodoo2 pal's....

I don't really understand this question. Since none of the current Amiga
chips supports multitexturing, the only chance you have is either two-pass
rendering or some surface caching like KAGE does it.

There is no chance for multi-texturing in one pass if you only have one
on-chip texturing unit. With a chip like the Savage 4 which has two
pipelines, you also have two u/v-registers for each vertex, one for each
texturing unit. 

I'm afraid Amiga 3D hardware is lagging behind the current
state-of-the-art...

For the Virge, you can use linear interpolation for the lightmaps, which
is a lot faster than perspective corrected mapping. The Permedia should be
able to handle Quake maps even with a second pass...

You have to repeat the texture in the cache. For instance, you hava a
texture cache with 256x256 textures. If the texture you want to use (the
one that is repeated) is, say 64x64, you just copy it into the texture
cache multiple times, mix in the lightmap, and use the u/v coordinates of
the lightmap when drawing the polygon. If the texture doesn't fit multiple
times, you have to scale it down, or, even better, use a mimap for that
purpose. The problem here is that you have to limit the texture cache
size, for speed reasons, and because you can pre-allocate the texture
objects in Warp3D, and use W3D_UpdateTexImage to move a cache entry to the
graphics board.

You can also use one texture cache entry for multiple textures, as the
resulting textures (with lightmaps) aren't repeated anymore. 

It's a very complex subject, and something that's hard to find any good
information on. I remember a paper (don't know the URL, sorry) that was
called "The KAGE surface caching algorithm", that describes surface
caching in detail..... I'll see if I have the URL somewhere, and post it
here...

For Quake you could theoretically split all surface polygons along the grid
lines of the lightmap and use vertex lighting for the resulting polys. But
this algorithm would be very complex (could be precalculated though).

The main problem is that this would also increase the per frame polygon count
tremendously. For most modern chips the polygon throughput is more critical
than fillrate (on Amiga both aspects are critical :().
But a low fillrate can be compensated by using lower resolutions, a high
polygon count can't.

The QMap software renderer uses a surface cache (sourcecode is included in 
the QMap archive on Aminet). But I doubt it makes sense to use this for 
hardware rendering, the VRAM uploads will kill the performance.
So I fear two-pass rendering is the only feasible solution.

Kind Regards

Well, the point seems to be that you want to have, say, a 128x128 texture
for "graphics" and a say 32x32 texture for lightmapping (they are usually
much smaller). You have to use different texture coordinates, but
otherwise there is no problem (assuming two-pass rendering is used...)

KAGE is a 3D engine. There was some web page about it, but I can't
remember the URL... It was a quite well-known company that did it,
though...

Surface caching works thus: A "surface" (also in Quake terms) is the
one single polygon in the scene plus its texture map plus its lightmap.
Many polygons may share the same texture map, and even share the same
lightmap, but usually this isn't the case. surface caching works by
"manually" (i.e. with the CPU) applying the lightmap to the texture map in
the appropriate way (i.e. with proper u/v coordniates) so that the
resulting texture map can be applied to the polygon in the scene. This
resulting map is of course more or less unique to this specific polygon,
so basically quite a lot of texture maps might be required/get created
this way. Since the video ram usually is not big enough to hold them all,
they are cached, much like "normal" textures are cached...

It depends on what you do. Descent works quite reasonably on
640x480/Permedia2. Of course, the Voodoo2 has a much higher fill rate. The
P2 is quite capable, but you should make sure you don't swap too many
textures - this might slow the whole thing down *considerably*...

To be honest, that's exactly the problem I currently have with Heretic II
- too much swapping, it uses really big textures sometimes...

Hi. I would like to make a request to anyone who can write Warp3D

as 3DFx have now decided to make the specs of their cards and the source
of Glide open and public, a direct Warp3D driver should be possible for
the PIV Voodoo add-on.

This could save the Paraglide. It has been delayed so far because the
software is not done, but if someone did a Warp3D driver no software
would be required from VT. Of cource, whoever wrote the driver would
need to find out exactly how the board works with the PIV and there
would need to be some additions to the PIV software, but IIRC this part
has already been done.
