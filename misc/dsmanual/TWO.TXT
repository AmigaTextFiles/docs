OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

      The Courier modem has minimal
      operational requirements.  Be sure to
      read the information in the front of
      this manual about radio and television
      interference and connecting to the phone
      company.  In addition, you should be
      aware of the following conditions.

         ù Follow the operating instructions
           in Appendix E, Dedicated Line and
           Leased Line Operation, if your
           phone line is user-installed or if
           it is leased from the telephone
           company.  Also referred to as
           private, these lines are used for a
           direct, continuous connection
           between two modems.  The connection
           is made without dialing.
         ù If your modem is installed in a
           Hewlett Packard system that uses
           the Ack/Enq communications
           protocol, be sure to follow the
           instructions at the end of Appendix
           E.
         ù If the modem is attached to a
           computer instead of a terminal, you
           need communications software.  The
           software uses the modem's AT
           command set to control many
           communications functions, including
           configuring the modem, dialing, and
           answering calls, and also enables
           the transfer of files and other
           operations.
           Some users prefer their communica-
           tions software to take control of
           the modem, and are more comfortable
           with a program that makes the modem
           almost transparent.   Others prefer
           a program that allows them to use
           the modem's AT command set some-
           times, and their software at other
           times, depending on the task at
           hand.  Whichever you prefer, review
           at least the Quick Start (Chapter
           3) so that you have a basic
           understanding of the modem's
           requirements and operation.

RS-232 Requirements

      You'll need an RS-232 cable to connect
      the modem to your computer or terminal.
      Use a shielded cable to ensure minimal
      interference with radio and television
      reception.

      The modem takes a DB-25P (25-pin plug,
      or male) connector at one end of the
      cable.  Computer equipment varies,
      however.  Check the serial port at the
      rear of your machine, which may be
      labeled SERIAL, COMM PORT, or some other
      term (e.g., RS-232).  If there are no
      labels, review your machine
      documentation to find out which is the
      serial port.  (There may be more than
      one.)  Don't use a port marked PARALLEL,
      PRINTER or AUX.

      The physical serial port on the computer
      or terminal will be either a socket
      (female) or plug (male) that typically
      accommodates 25 or 9 pins.  For example,
      the port on the IBM PC, PC/XT and most
      compatibles requires a DB-25S (socket)
      connector, while the port on the IBM
      PC/AT and some compatibles requires a
      DB-9S connector.  Apple computers
      require a DB-25P, DB-9P or, more
      typically, an 8-pin round plug
      connector.  Check your computer
      documentation or with your computer
      dealer.

      NOTE:  Appendix B includes a listing of
      RS-232 pin assignments required to
      operate the modem.  Be sure to check the
      appendix if you're not sure what type of
      cable you need, or if you're building
      your own.  If your machine has other
      than a 25- or 9-pin port, check your
      computer documentation or consult your
      dealer to find out what type of RS-232
      connector is required.

      WARNING:  If you're planning to use the
      high speed computer-to-modem rates of
      57.6K or 38.4K bps, follow the
      instructions concerning the RS-232 cable
      in Appendix B.  The guidelines there
      will help you to avoid signal
      degradation at very high speeds.


FRONT PANEL SWITCHES

   Voice/Data

      This pushbutton switch is used primarily
      to switch between voice and data
      communications during a call.  Detailed
      instructions are in Appendix E,
      Voice/Data Calls.  The switch has
      multiple functions, however.  Options
      are as follows:

         Disable the switch
         Force the modem off hook in Originate
           mode (default)
         Force the modem off hook in Answer
           mode
         Have the modem redial the last dialed
           number
         Have the modem dial the first number
           you've stored in nonvolatile memory
         Toggle Auto Answer on and off
         Reset the modem to its defaults
         Initiate Remote Digital Loopback
         testing
         Busy out the phone line
   Volume Control

      This is a rotary switch under the front
      panel, near the right corner.  Turning
      it clockwise increases the volume of the
      modem's speaker.  Turning it counter-
      clockwise decreases the volume.


FRONT PANEL INDICATORS

      Below is a list of the modem's twelve
      status lights, or LEDs.  See Appendix B
      for descriptions of their operations.

      HS  High Speed TR   Data Terminal Ready
      AA  Auto Answer     MR  Modem Ready

INSTALLING THE MODEM

      1. Turn off the computer or terminal and
         its peripheral devices.

      2. Examine the label on the bottom of
         the modem.  In addition to the
         summaries and other information, the
         label contains icons to aid in modem
         assembly.  Check the interfaces at
         the back of the modem, shown in the
         following photograph.















      Figure 2.2êInterface End, Courier Modem
      3. Now review the attached interfaces in
         Figure 2.3.




















         Figure 2.3êConnected Courier Modem


      4. Check to make sure that the power
         switch is OFF; press it towards the
         zero in the 0/1 icon on the bottom
         label.  Plug the power supply
         adapter's small connector into the
         power jack at the back of the modem.
         Plug the adapter into a standard 115-
         volt AC wall socket.

         Disconnect your present phone cable
         from the wall jack.  Plug one end of
         the phone cable that came with the
         modem into the modem's phone jack
         that is near the wall-jack icon on
         the bottom label.  Plug the other end
         into the wall jack.
         NOTE:  Older telephone installations
         may not have the appropriate modular
         wall jack and plug.  Adapters and
         RJ11C connectors are available from
         your telephone company or computer
         dealer.

         If you want to keep your telephone
         connected for conventional calls,
         plug its cord into the jack at the
         rear of the modem near the phone
         icon.  You can also use both your
         telephone and modem in one call,
         although not at the same time.
         Voice/Data, in Appendix E, explains
         how to switch control of the phone
         line between the phone and the modem.

      5. Next, check the positions of the bank
         of Dual In-Line Package (DIP)
         Switches located in the well at the
         bottom of the modem.  These switches
         are set at the factory to the
         positions most users require.

.G.





       Figure 2.4êDIP Switch Factory Settings


         The quick-configuration guide that
         came with the manual shows
         recommended switch settings for many
         widely-used communications software
         products.  If your communications
         software is not listed, check your
         software documentation for its
         requirements, particularly for DIP
         switches 1, 4, 5
         and 6.  You'll also find descriptions
         of switch functions and options in
         Appendix B.

         If you already know your
         requirements, use the guide on the
         bottom of the modem or the summary in
         the Quick Reference Card to verify
         the switch positions.

         NOTE:  If you have built your own RS-
         232 cable and it does not support
         Data Terminal Ready (DTR), set DIP
         switch 1 DOWN, for the DTR override.
         The override causes the modem to
         operate as if the DTR signal is
         always ON, and enables the modem to
         accept commands.  Most purchased
         communications software, however,
         requires DTR.

         DIP switch 10 is explained under
         Setting/Using Defaults in Chapter 5.
         Most users will want to leave this
         switch OFF, write their own defaults
         to nonvolatile memory (NVRAM), and
         have those defaults loaded at power
         on.

         The wider Quad switch on the right of
         the numbered switches should be left
         UP unless you know your equipment
         reverses the transmit and receive
         pins at the RS-232 interface (see
         Appendix B, DIP Switch Summary).

      6. The final step is to connect the
         modem to the computer's or terminal's
         serial port with the RS-232 cable
         described earlier in this chapter.
         Attach the appropriate connectors to
         the modem and to the serial port.

      NOTE:  To prevent overheating, do not
      cover the vents on the top of the modem
      case.

      The modem is now ready to be tested and
      operated.


TESTING THE INSTALLATION

      Use the following procedures to verify
      that your modem is working properly.
      1. Turn on your computer or terminal and
         clear the screen.  Then turn the
         Courier's power switch ON.  The
         following front panel indicators, or
         LEDs, will light up.

         CD Carrier Detect, if you have set
            DIP switch 6 DOWN, enabling the CD
            override
         MR Modem Ready/Power ON
         CS Clear to Send
         TR Data Terminal Ready, if you have
            set DIP switch 1 DOWN, enabling
            the DTR override

         For more information on the front
         panel indicators, see Appendix B.

      2. Set your terminal or software to
         19.2K bps or 9600 bps.  In addition,
         set a word length of either 7 bits
         plus 1 parity bit, or 8 bits with no
         parityêit doesn't matter which
         nowêand 1 Stop bit.

      3. If you're using a personal computer,
         load your communications software.
         If your software allows, perform the
         function that lets you send AT
         commands to the modem, that is, puts
         the computer in Terminal Mode.  Some
         communications programs do this
         automatically upon loading.  Others
         require you to display a
         communications or terminal screen,
         type a Function key, or perform some
         other operation.

         If necessary, refer to your
         communications software documentation
         for instructions.
      4. Check to see if your computer or
         terminal and modem are communicating
         with each other by sending the
         following attention command.  Type
         either upper or lower case letters,
         not a combination, and then press the
         Enter (Carriage Return) key, shown in
         the example below between angle
         brackets.  (Don't type the angle
         brackets.)

             AT <Enter>

         If everything is correct, the modem
         responds as follows:

             OK

         NOTE:  The modem is shipped with DIP
         switch 4 UP, causing the modem to
         display (echo) your keyboard
         commands.  If your entered command is
         not displayed, your local echo is
         OFF.  To turn the local echo ON, send
         the modem the following command.

             ATE1 <Enter>

         If double characters appear on the
         screen, both your modem and software
         are set to local echo ON.  Either set
         your software to local echo OFF, or
         turn the modem's echo OFF with the
         following command.

             ATE0 <Enter>

   Troubleshooting

      If no OK appears on your screen, review
      the following checkpoints.
      a. Make sure you type all upper or lower
         case letters and press <Enter>.

      b. Check to see that you set your
         communications software to the
         correct serial port.

      c. Make sure your software has put the
         computer in Terminal mode, so that
         you can send the modem commands.
         Then review Step 4, above.
      d. Be sure that DIP switches 1 and 6 are
         set ON or OFF according to your
         terminal or software requirements.
         The table in Appendix B explains each
         function, and you may also need to
         review the quick-configuration guide
         or your terminal or communications
         software documentation .

      e. The Quad switch on the right should
         be in the UP position.

      f. If you set DIP switch 8 UP, for Dumb
         mode, reset the modem to Smart mode:
         set DIP switch 8 DOWN, power off the
         modem, and power it on again.

      g. DIP switch 3 controls the display of
         the modem's result codes, including
         the OK result.  The modem is shipped
         with DIP switch 3 DOWN, enabling the
         result codes.  If DIP switch 3 is UP,
         reset it to the DOWN position.  Then
         initiate the new switch setting with
         the following reset command.

             ATZ <Enter>

      5. A final check of the modem is to see
         that it gets a dial tone.  Type the
         following manual Dial command:

             ATD <Enter>

         On receipt of the command, the modem
         goes off hook and waits for a dial
         tone.  The OH indicator lights, and
         you'll hear the dial tone from the
         modem's speaker.  To cancel the
         operation, press any key.

         If you don't hear the dial tone,
         first increase the volume by sliding
         the volume control switch towards the
         front of the modem.  If that doesn't
         work, check to see that the phone
         cable from the wall jack is connected
         to the correct jack on the modem.
         The correct connection is to the jack
         identified by the wall jack icon on
         the bottom label of the modem case,
         not the phone icon.  If necessary,
         reconnect the phone cable correctly.
         Then try the manual Dial command
         again, ATD <Enter>.
