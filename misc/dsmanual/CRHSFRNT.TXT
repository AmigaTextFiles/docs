HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL

      This manual contains operating
      instructions for Courier V.32 bis,
      Courier HST, and Courier HST Dual
      Standard modems.  These modems have
      identical features except for the
      signaling they use to connect with
      remote modems at high speeds:  V.32/V.32
      bis or HST.  Courier HST Dual Standard
      modems use either type of signaling, de-
      pending on the type of remote modem.

      As you use the manual, keep the
      following guidelines in mind.

         ˘ The modem is shipped ready for most
           dial-up applications except for its
           flow control setting, which depends
           on the type of software and machine
           you're using.  After you've set up
           the modem and tested its operation
           (Chapter 2) review the Quick-Start
           instructions in Chapter 3 for brief
           configuration guidelines.
         ˘ If you've purchased a Courier V.32
           bis modem, disregard the
           instructions in this manual
           concerning HST operations.
           Conversely, if you've purchased a
           Courier HST modem, disregard the
           instructions concerning V.32/V.32
           bis operations.
         ˘ All Courier high speed modems
           connect automatically with remote
           modems operating at 14.4K/12K/9600/
           7200/4800/2400/1200/300/110 bps, as
           long as the remote modems observe
           the standards listed under
           Compatibility in Chapter 1.
           Courier HST modems also connect
           with other Courier HST modems at
           16.8K bps.

A NOTE ON COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE

      If you're using a computer rather than a
      terminal, you need communications
      software.  Many brands are available,
      all of which are based on the modem's AT
      command set.

      Some users prefer their communications
      software to take control of the modem,
      and are more comfortable with a program
      that makes the modem almost transparent.
      Others prefer a program that allows them
      to use the modem's AT command set some-
      times, and their software at other
      times, depending on the task at hand.
      Whichever you prefer, review at least
      the Quick Start (Chapter 3) so that you
      have a basic understanding of the
      modem's requirements and operation.
USER PATHS

      The paths shown in the diagram are
      suggestions only, designed for new and
      experienced users.  Note that there is
      no separate path for HST-mode or V.32
      bis-mode operation.

      Most users will be making asynchronous
      calls.  If you'll be making synchronous
      calls to a mainframe, you'll find all
      essential information in Chapter 7.
      However, you may find it helpful to
      review the more detailed operating
      instructions in other chapters as well.

CONNECTING TO THE TELEPHONE COMPANY

      It is not necessary to notify the
      telephone company before installing the
      modem.  However, the telephone company
      may request the telephone number(s) to
      which the Courier is connected and the
      FCC information printed above.

      If the telephone company has any
      questions or raises problems, ask them
      to call the Technical Support
      Department, USRobotics, Inc., 800/982-
      5151.

      If the modem is malfunctioning, it may
      affect the telephone lines.  In this
      case, disconnect the modem until the

      source of the difficulty is traced.  Do

RADIO AND TELEVISION INTERFERENCE

      This equipment generates and uses radio
      frequency energy and if not installed
      and used properly, in strict accordance
      with the  manufacturer's instructions,
      may cause interference to radio and
      television reception.  Courier high
      speed modems have been tested and found
      to comply with the limits for a Class B
      computing device in accordance with the
      specifications in Part 15 of FCC rules,
      which are designed to provide reasonable
      protection against such interference in
      a residential installation.

      However, there is no guarantee that
      interference will not occur in a
      particular installation.  If this device
      does cause interference to radio or
      television reception, which you can
      determine by monitoring reception when
      the modem is on and off, try to correct
      the problem with one or more of the
      following measures.

         Reorient the receiving antenna.
         Relocate the computer with respect to
           the
           receiver.
         Relocate the computer and/or the
           receiver so
           that they are on separate branch
           circuits.

      If necessary, consult your dealer or an
      experienced radio/television technician
      for additional suggestions.  You may
      find the following booklet, prepared by
      the Federal Communications Commission,

FOR CANADIAN MODEM USERS

      The Canadian Department of
      Communications (DOC) label identifies
      certified equipment.  This certification
      means that the equipment meets certain
      telecommunications network protective,
      operational, and safety requirements.
      The department does not guarantee the
      equipment will operate to a user's
      satisfaction.

      Before installing this equipment, make
      sure you are permitted to connect it to
      the facilities of the local
      telecommunications company.  You must
      also install the equipment using an
      acceptable method of connection.  In
      some cases, you may also extend the
      company's inside wiring for single line
      individual service by means of a
      certified connector assembly (telephone
      extension cord).  You should be aware,
      however, that compliance with the above
      conditions may not prevent degradation
      of service in some situations.

      Repairs to certified equipment should be
      made by an authorized Canadian
      maintenance facility designated by the
      supplier.  Any repairs or alterations
      made by a user to this equipment, or
      equipment malfunctions, may give the
      telecommunications company cause to
      request the user to disconnect the
      equipment.

      For your own protection, make sure that
      the electrical ground connections of the
      power utility, telephone lines, and
      internal metallic water pipe system, if
      present, are connected together.  This

      precaution may be particularly important
      in rural areas.

      CAUTION:  Do not attempt to make such
      connections yourself; contact the
      appropriate electric inspection
      authority or electrician.

           Courier High Speed Modems Load
           Number:  41B

      The Load Number (LN) assigned to each
      terminal device denotes the percentage
      of the total load to be connected to the
      telephone loop used by the device,
      without overloading.  The  termination
      on a loop may consist of any combination
      of devices, subject only to the
      requirement that the total of the Load
      Numbers of all the devices not exceed
      100.  An alphabetic suffix is also
      specified in the Load Number for the
      appropriate ringing type (A or B), if
      applicable.  For example, LN = 41B
      designates a Load Number of 41 and a B-
      type ringer.
