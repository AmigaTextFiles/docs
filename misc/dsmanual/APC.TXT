     APPENDIX C.  ALPHABETICAL COMMAND SUMMARY

      

      Additional command summaries are on the
      bottom panel of the modem and in the
      Quick-Reference Card.

REQUIREMENTS

         1.    Type commands in either upper
           or lower case, not a combination.
         2.    All commands except A/, A> and
           +++ are preceded by the AT prefix
           and are executed with the
           Enter/Carriage Return key
           (<Enter>).
         3.    Command length = 40 characters
           maximum.  The modem doesn't count
           the AT prefix, Carriage Return
           character, or spaces.  It counts
           but doesn't act on punctuation such
           as hyphens and parentheses.
         4.    A missing numeric parameter is
           assumed to be zero, as in the
           command to hang up:  ATH <Enter> is
           the equivalent of ATH0 <Enter>.
         

BASIC COMMAND SET

      follows this Basic Set.

%     See the Percent Command Summary that
      follows the Extended Command Summary.

A     Force Answer mode when the modem hasn't
      received an incoming call.

A/    Re-execute the last issued command one
      time.  A/ doesn't take the AT prefix or
      a Carriage Return.
A>    Re-execute the last issued command
      continuously until canceled by pressing
      <any key>.  Dial strings are re-executed
      ten times, after which execution

      Use &A2 to add HST or V.32 modulation
      indicators, as well as ARQ and non-ARQ
      status, to the result codes.

      Use &A3 to add error control protocol
      indicators (LAPM, HST, MNP, SYNC, or
      NONE) and data compression type (V42BIS
      or MNP5) to the result codes.

Z     Software reset to NVRAM settings if DIP
      switch 10 is UP, to factory settings if
      DIP switch 10 is DOWN.  Also initiates
      new settings of DIP switches 2-5, 7 and
      9.

+++   Escape code, preceded and followed by a
      guard time of at least one second of no
      data transmission.  The modem responds
      to +++ by returning to Command mode and
      doing the following:

      DIP switch 9 UP (OFF, Factory setting):
      Hangs up and sends NO CARRIER result
      code

      DIP switch 9 DOWN (ON):  Retains phone
      line connection and sends OK result code

      canceled by pressing <any key>.  If used
      in a Dial string, automated redialing
      terminates after ten attempts.

      sent immediately to the remote system.
      Under data compression, destructive
      Breaks cause both modems to reset their
      compression tables.

      &Y0 Destructive, don't send Break.
