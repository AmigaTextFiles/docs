Date: Mon, 05 Nov 2001 16:24:01 +0200

Yellow,

    Some time ago I have been asking for proper implementation of
zbuffering.
 Now when I have it working I have another question: Why it doesn't work the
 way as it should? I mean I'm getting very innacurate results with even
 relatively small zbuffer ranges. So I have lookd into minigl sources, and
 saw some strange formulas;) They are not using the way warptest uses
 but some others. Could someone explain it to me step by step, hot it should
 be done because I'm out of ideas (Even tried double for zbuffering, but
only small
 improvement).

Regards.

Subject: 3D engine hanging
From: Alexander Weber <alexwe@alexwe.de>
Date: Sun, 11 Nov 2001 23:11:59 +0100

Hello.

I have written a little 3D engine that is directly using Warp 3D. It is
working fine, except that it hangs after a while, especially in higher
resolutions (in 640x480 after ca. 2 minutes, in 800x600 in less that a
minute). I wonder if this is a known problem, because when new Warp3D programs
are released, they often also tend to hang after a while and after an update
they are working fine (this was for example the case with Payback).
I don't want to post the source code of my engine here, because I think it's
too complicated, but I can send an executable example to anybody who wants it.

Could the problem have something to do with drawing over the screen border?
When I started experimenting with Warp3D, I used no clipping and the computer
crashed very often. Now I'm using clipping, but there could still be cases
where graphics are drawn a little bit over the border because of rounding
errors.

Bye,

Alexander.

I doubt that. The chip can only draw in it's own memory, it can not even 
overwrite the registers...

The driver will never write outside the draw region when you enable 
scissoring. Unfortunately, scissoring is no replacement for clipping (I 
should add that future version of Warp3D will have clipping... but 
that's for the next version, which will have a major redesign, anyway...)

Regarding the hangups: The higher the resolution, the slower the 
rendering, thus the lock is held longer. The longer the lock is held, 
the higher the propability that something can go wrong.

Unfortunately, the whole problem with bitmap locking is unavoidable. In 
the future, we might have more interoperability between 2D driver and 3D 
system, but for now, it's a basic concept...

Thank you. I think this was my problem. I actually did all the calculations
during the locking. I have rewritten my engine now, so that the vector
transformations are done outside the locking period and at least a simple demo
is now working very stable, even at 1024x768. Unfortunately it doesn't draw
outside the screen, so I don't know if the engine is also as stable when
clipping is used (until I write a more complex example).

By the way, you can download the small demo from

http://www.alexwe.de/facedemo.lha
(98035 Bytes, requires PPC)

It is very simple and the engine can do much more, but I think it's rather
funny.
Just unpack the archive and start it from the Shell with "face3d". Control
with the cursor keys and quit with Esc.
It would be nice if anybody could tell me if it works on other hardware than
mine, especially on Voodoo :-) (I have a BVison).

Bye,

Alex.

Are you sure?

The only HIDE15BIT I know of is a ENV-setting (ENV:CyberGraphX/HIDE15BIT).

I checked the monitor icon too just to be sure but I couldn't find one.

Also if you start the program CyberGraphX (in Prefs) there are two register
cards. One with the ENV-Vars (where HIDE15BIT is listed) and one with the
tool-types (where HIDE15BIT is not listed).

As already written, this solved the problem and Shogo is working now.
Strange, because fogging in HereticII looks great (in the Swamps).

Everything except Payback which runs silky smooth.

Not that big of a problem as long as I can play it in window mode.

Since I already preordered/prepaid Freespace at the fair in Cologne, any idea
with what I can spend my money now. 8)

I guess, you mean the ENV-setting.

I listed all the important system setting in my original mail (and checked it
again just to be sure). It is set to 0.

Shouldn't really happen, but can't be ruled out. This is probably due to 
the Avenger core logic bug that requires a reset of the chip - chances 
are that there are differences between revision.

Engine requires 15 bit modes. That's not available on the Voodoo.

Yes, I've heard about that. I don't know the reason, but since we're 
about to update the Mesa port to 4.0 for OS 4 anyway, it wasn't high 
priority.

Wipeout looks for big endian screenmodes. AFAIK the CyberGraphX Voodoo

Hi everyone,


Having bought a G-REX 4000D and a Voodoo3 at the fair in Cologne last weekend
I now have some questions/problems.

WarpTest, gears and glsokoban work fine (except when using window mode and
stretching the size to about 1024x768 then the computer freezes.

Engine doesn't work at all (No ModeID found).

Every StormMesa demo gives me a WarpOS exception when using 16bit mode (or
using window mode on a 16bit Workbench).
If they work they don't use the hardware accelerator.


Shogo locks after starting the first mission (when the camera scrolls above
the area to the starting point) however the demo works (at least 640x480).
Unfortunately after installind Warp3D I can't select a software renderer any
more so I can't play it at all.

HereticII works in up to (800x600). It locks if I use 1024x768 in
hardwaremode.

Freespace demo works (haven't tried much with it though).

Wipeout2097 is only playable in Window-mode (if the Workbench has 16 bit). I
can't select a screenmode (guess it is looking for a 15bit mode which I don't
have). If I enlarge the window to something between 800x600 and 1024x768 it
also locks.

Payback works flawlessly (even in 1024x768 with very impressiv speed).

GLQuake68K and GLQuakeWOS work (have only tried in 640x480).

Using CGXMode I can create screens with depth 8, 15/16 or 24 bit.
In the ScreenMode-requester of the WB I can only get 8, 16 and 24 bit modes
does the Voodoo3 not support 15 bit modes?


I'm having a A4000, Cyberstorm 060/50 and 604e/200 with 128 MB RAM (plus 16

For the Voodoo 3, yes. The PPC version uses the command FIFO. I guess

The problem is that the Voodoo 3's core logic, in some versions, 
exhibits a strange behaviour that can hang the 3D engine. In that case, 
the 2D part doesn't switch back to idle again. We currently solve that 
by issuing a RESET to the chip, which will cancel all ongoing operations 
(therefore your impression that the clipping is wrong- polygons will 
simply vanish or be cut off in the middle).

For the 68k, this also means that the 68k blocks. The PPC runs 
independent of the 68k, so it doesn't block the PPC, and it can still 
issue the RESET.

Apparently, the reset goes wrong sometimes, that's why the games hang in 
that resolution. I'm afraid there is no ad-hoc solution for this 
problem, though.

Hi everyone,


Concerning the problem with the locks of all Warp3D programms (except Payback)
in 1024x768.

I found out, that glquake68k works fine with this resolution whereas
glquakewos also locks the computer.

Are there any bigger differences between the 68K and PPC versions of Warp3D?

I might be wrong but it appears that the programms have some troubles with
clipping in this resolution.

Not that this would be an emergency, as I normally use 640x480 which gives me
a nice resolution and fine speed anyway.

That variable name is actually misspelt. It should read 
"Warp3D/Mediator/MemSize", and is used to restrict the size of the 
memory used by Warp3D to allow soundblaster drivers to use part of the 
memory. Read the V4_RELEASENOTES in the Mediator Warp3D archive for that.

Hello,

what vars are there for the mediator+voodoo card
there is a mentioning on the lists of a 
Warp3D/Mediator/VoodooMem env-var
what does that do? and what should it be set to

and is there any others
for the voodoo specificly (Avenger), Picasso96
