Short: LaTeX: Who's on first? (sketch)
Type: text/misc
Uploader: s_walter@irav1.ira.uka.de (Thomas Baetzler)

    This is Abbott & Costello's famous 'Who's on first' sketch. I found
this thing floating around on Usenet, original source unknown.

    Other texts are scheduled to follow as soon as I get around to typeset
them.

    Have fun!
