@NODE PREFACE "PREFACE"

	As  yet,  I have been unable to find a FAQ for Mosaic on the Amiga, so
this  is my response.  It will probably be put on Demon's ftp site in the near
future, however I will post it whenever I get something new for it.

	First  of  all  though,  a  warning.   I  have  assumed  that  you are
intelligent  BUT  new to comms/amiga etc.  so some of the following advice may
seem a tad condescending to some :) Sorry about that, but this is aimed mainly
AT  beginners.   Since  v1.0  of  this FAQ, I have decided to produce ONLY the
AmigaGuide  version.  If  enough people @{"shout" LINK EPILOGUE} I will consider putting out the
text version.  :)

	Also  I  shall  be  concentrating  on  the @{"AmiTCP" LINK PRATCP}  version, the other
versions,  for DNet, NoNet and AS225R2 should operationally be the same.  Only
the  installation  MAY  be  different  (consult  relevent docs).  So the basic
assumption of this FAQ is that you are currently running @{"AmiTCP" LINK PRATCP}and are either
just starting with Mosaic or thinking about it.  Have fun ;)

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE WHAT "WHAT IS IT?"

Screen shot@{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow AMosaic.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK AMosaic.iff/main}
	A better question is what is'nt it?  It plays movies (@{"mpegs" LINK MPEGS}),@{"sounds" LINK SOUNDS},
shows @{"pictures" LINK PICTURES},  displays  text.   If you have never seen it before, it looks
like  an  AmigaGuide  type utility, except you can go anywhere in the world to
find out anything you want, you can hunt down a program and download it or you
can  even order and pay for a pizza!  It's one of those things you really have
to  try  to  get a true 'feeling' for.  But be careful, if you thought netting
was addictive, try this and you will never sleep.  :)

Important -->> @{" VERSIONS " LINK VERSIONS} <<--

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE VERSIONS "What's you WorkBench?"

There are now three versions of Amosaic!

v1.2     - This is the LAST an ONLY available version that can be used with WB
2.xx!!!   You MUST turn off inline images.  WHY?  Because WB2.xx does not have
DataType support that WB3.xx has.  Also this version is not that stable!

v1.2.1   - This  needs  WB 3.xx by "accident". This was mainly a bug-fix, with
improved stability.

v1.3beta - From  here on, ONLY WB 3.xx will be supported.
	It now supports @{"proxy servers" LINK PROXY}.
	It has improved the handling of telnet URLs.
	The  'busy' button (lower right, it flashes while downloading data) is
now a 'clock'.  Neat huh?

		-->> MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE LATEST AVAILABLE <<--
		-->>     VERSION SUITABLE FOR YOUR WORKBENCH     <<--

				you have been warned

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PROXY "Proxy HTTP Servers"

	Amosaic,  from v1.3beta, now supports @{"proxy" LINK WPROXY} servers.  By using one you
will  be able to download documents a lot faster as they are cached locally by
your  IP  Provider.   In  order to use it you must put a couple of setenv's in
your Startnet file as follows:

	setenv WWW_http_GATEWAY "proxy"
	setenv http_proxy	"proxy"

where  "proxy"  is  your  IP  Provider's http server.  So ask locally if it is
supported.   For  example  if you are on Demon Internet Services in England it
would be:

	setenv WWW_http_GATEWAY "http://www.demon.co.uk:8000/"
	setenv http_proxy	"http://www.demon.co.uk:8080/"

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE WPROXY "What's a Proxy?"

	A  recent  email from Greg Block put this oh so nicely.  So here it is
verbatim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: Winter@oubliette.COM (Greg Block)
Subject: Re: AMosaic 1.3b

> Now what is proxy?

For  many  reasons,  some  networks  choose  to  run the CERN httpd program in
"proxy"  mode; basically, that means that instead of your program fetching the
HTML  directly,  it  proxies  the request to the httpd that is set up in proxy
mode.   It  asks  the  httpd  to  get  the file FOR it.  The httpd then either
proxies  or  fetches,  depending on how it is configured, and returns with the
page.

Sometimes, it is done because of a firewall, preventing the local network from
outside  access.   Many  times,  however,  it is done simply because httpd can
create  a "global cache" of all files that it grabs; creating a cache that all
of  the  users in the local network share, rather than one local to a specific
user.

Dat answer da question?  Someone make this FAQ.  :)

@NODE WHERE "WHERE IS IT"

version 1.2:
	Aminet:	comm/net/Mosaic1.2AmiTCP.lha
	Demon:	pub/amiga/mosaic/Mosaic_1.2_AmiTCP.lha

version 1.3beta:
	The  only  place  I  have  been able to find it is from the Amiga Home
Page.   To  get it, download and install v1.2, log on, run mosaic and click on
'ftp here' on the 1st page you see.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PREREQ "PREREQUISITES"

	Unfortunately,  you  cannot  just download and run mosaic.  You need a
few other things to nudge it into life.

	@{"*" LINK PRWB} WorkBench

	@{"*" LINK PRMUI} MagicUser Interface

	@{"*" LINK PRATCP} AmiTCP

	@{"*" LINK PRMEM} Memory

	@{"*" LINK PRIL} Internet Link

	@{"*" LINK PRSUM} Summary

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PRWB "WORKBENCH"

	WorkBench  3.0  or  better  is  needed  to get the most out of Mosaic,
because it uses @{"DataTypes" LINK ADDT} for almost everything you see and hear. You can use
WB  2.xx  but  you  will  miss  out  on  an  awful lot of pictures sounds etc,
virtually reduces Mosaic to an AmigaGuide from what I hear.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PRMUI "MAGIC USER INTERFACE"

	This  is  a  very good, if somewhat slow (on a 'basic' Amiga) GUI.  It
allows you to change everything about the visual presentation of a program and
the  Desktop.   Also all MUI-using programs will have a uniform look and feel.
Keyboard  shortcuts  can be setup and ALL MUI-progs can have an Arexx port.  I
know Mosaic will work on MUI2.0 onwards, the latest version is @{"2.3" LINK MUICR}  available
from:

Aminet:	pub/aminet/dev/gui/mui23usr.lha
Demon:	pub/amiga/mosaic/mui23usr.lha

in  the same place is mui23dev.lha BUT you only need this if you want to write
your  own  applications.  Also please Register and get the keyfile.  It really
makes  a difference.  You can save everything in the MUI-prefs prog.  It's one
of  those  add-ons  that causes strong emotions in some.  ie Some love it some
loathe it, however if you want mosaic you MUST have it.

MUI  is  an object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user
interfaces.  From  a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a lot of
time  and  makes life much easier. Thinking about complicated terms like
window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

On  the  other hand, users of MUI based applications have the ability to
customize  nearly every pixel of a programs interface according to their
personal taste.

This distribution is interesting for both, users and programmers. Please
have  a  look  at the supplied demo programs and at the documentation to
see what MUI has to offer.

MUI  ist  ein  objektorientiertes System zum Erstellen und Verwalten von
grafischen  Benutzeroberflächen. Vom Standpunkt eines Programmierers aus
gesehen  spart  man mit MUI viel Zeit und Arbeit. Es ist nicht nötig, an
sonst  so  komplizierte Dinge wie Font-Sensitivität oder Window-Resizing
auch nur einen Gedanken zu verschwenden.

Auf  der  anderen  Seite  hat man als Benutzer einer auf MUI basierenden
Applikation die Möglichkeit, nahezu jedes Pixel der Oberfläche an seinen
ganz persönlichen Geschmack anzupassen.

Diese  Distribution  ist  sowohl für Programmierer als auch für Benutzer
interessant.  Die  mitgelieferten  Demo-Programme  sollen  einen kleinen
Einblick in die Leistungsfähigkeit von MUI vermitteln.

@NODE PRATCP "AMITCP"

	You  must  have  v3.0b2  or  better  (Anyone  bought v4.0 yet?) to run
Mosaic1.2.  Because it has now gone commercial, v4.0, the author has wiped all
previous versions from most sites, but it is still available from Demon:

	pub/amiga/amitcp/installer/AmiTCP-DISr10.lha
AND	pub/amiga/amitcp/installer/R10-Update1.lha

NOTE:  You need both bits, th 'R10' bit is as it says an update.  RTFM ALL the
@{"docs" LINK APDOCS} and then re-RTFM, then install.  This is about the easiest of the AmiTCP
versions  to  install  as  Demon have done a sterling job putting together the
distribution.

	Also,  as hinted above, AmiTCP has now gone commercial in V4.0.  There
is a  demo  version  available.  For more info about it @{"README.FIRST" LINK RAMITCP} from the
distribution. It's available from:


Aminet: pub/aminet/comm/tcp/AmiTCP-demo-40.lha

@NODE APDOCS "Required Reading for Installing AmiTCP"

	Once the AmiTCP-DISr10.lha file has been unarced READ the following
files BEFORE going any further:

	a) ReadME.First

	b) ReadMe

	c) README.Updates

and then @{b}RTFM AGAIN!@{ub}

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PRMEM "MEMORY"

	It  can  run in 2MB, JUST.  It's better with 4MB more, BUT give it 8MB
and  it  will be a lot better.  Also a 68030 helps move things along!  This is
because  of  MUI which is a tad slow, and also you are running AmiTCP, MUI and
Mosaic - all of which help to slow things down.

	If  you are feeling adventurous ;) you could assign T:  to a directory
on  your  HardDrive.   It would be slightly slower, the only danger is that if
mosaic  crashes will writing a file it will probably invalidate your drive :(.
Try this one at your own risk!!!

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PRSUM "SUMMARY"

For optimum use you need:
1> A 1200 or 4000 with 4MB or more and an accel.card.
2> AmiTCP30b
3> MagicUser Interface v2.x
4> A Hard Drive! Obvious really, if you're serious about comms or the Amiga 8)
5> Strong will-power and/or a large wallet ;)

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PRIL "Internet where are you?"

	Obvious  really, but I thought I'd better put this in, in case someone
who has'nt got a link is reading this.  There are several Providers popping up
all  over the place recently.  I use @{"Demon" LINK DEMON} at the moment, but shop around see
what  there  is.  If possible try to sign-up with someone who provides a local
phone number, in order to keep the phonebill down.


@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE DEMON "Demon Internet"

	This  is  a shameful plug ;) For a tenner a month you can get onto the
Internet NOW.  Demon provide both a connection to the Net AND some software to
get you going.  Currently, AmigaNOS is provided.  There is a beta-test version
of @{"AmiTCP" LINK PRATCP} available, but at the moment unsupported offically! Now that AmiTCP
v4.0  is  out,  I  don't  know if Demon's package will be supported.  However,
don't  worry!   The  package  is  fairly reliable ;) and NEEDED if you want to
access the joys of mosaic.

@NODE V13 "Amosaic v1.3beta"

@{b}NOTE@{ub}
	As  I  have said a few times already, v1.3beta is for WB 3.0 and above
	ONLY!  If you have anything less go back and install v1.2

@{b}Installation@{ub}

	a)  First of all you have to have mosaic running in order to get v1.3.
	  So if you have'nt got mosaic yet go back and get v1.2 installed and
	running.

	b)  Reboot,  get onto the net and run mosaic, once you have got to the
	Amiga Home Page download v1.3beta.  Quit mosaic and log off the 'net.

	c) De-arc the downloaded file.

	d)  Rename  v1.2  mosaic  binary  as  old.mosaic,  and  copy v1.3 into
	AmiTCP:bin, just in case :)

	e)  The  format of the 'ENVARC:mosaic/prefs' file has changed slightly
	in v1.3beta for hotlist operation, they are no longer 'RexMacro1 or 2'
	Delete the entries and use the following instead.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	AddToHotlist         "address command 'run <>NIL: amhotlist quickadd'"
	JumpToHotlist        "address command 'run <>NIL: amhotlist'"
	----------------------------------------------------------------------

	f)  Also if your IP provider supports @{"proxy" LINK WPROXY} put the @{"setenv's" LINK PROXY} in your
	Startnet file.

	g) Now go to @{"Testing...1,2,3" LINK INTEST} and make sure everything still works.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE INUNP "UNPACKING"

This is very simple, just seven steps to Mosaic-heaven:

1> This is only a FAQ! Please RTFM!!!! for the full story.

2>  The  main binary 'Mosaic-AmiTCP'.  I've renamed this as 'mosaic' merely to
ease the typing in the Shell.  A probably safer way is to put an Alias in your
User-Startup file in s:  such as:

	Alias mosaic Mosaic-AmiTCP

I STRONGLY recommend you put it in AmiTCP:bin for two reasons:

	i)  You can then type 'mosaic' in the Shell to execute it.
	ii) I am in the process of modifying @{"Plink2.1" LINK ADP}so you can boot directly
into mosaic by typing 'plink up mosaic'.

3>  The  ENVARC:   directory.   Copy it's contents to your ENVARC:  directory,
usually in Workbench:prefs.  The Envarc:mosaic/prefs file WILL be @{"modified" LINK MPMOD} by
you at a latter date, but not just now.

4>  The REXX: directory. Copy it's contents to your s: directory.

5>  The  DOCS:   directory.   For  ease  of  use  I've put this in the AmiTCP:
directory so it's easy to get to later.

6>  As  a minimum I would suggest that you also install @{"ZGIF" LINK ADDT} again it is very
simple to install so RTFM :)

7>  That's  it you're all done now, all that remains is.....  Sit back, have a
cuppa and relax....  until...

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node MPMOD "Customisation"

@{b}Modifying files in ENVARC:mosaic@{ub}
	Once  the basic setup is up and working, you may/will want to add your
favorite   picture   viewer  or  whatever.   If  you  do  then  the  files  in
ENVARC:mosaic WILL have to be altered!

@{b}mime-types@{ub}
	This sorts out that type the file is, ie a jpeg or sample, and sends
on a type format to the mailcap.

Example entry:	audio/x-8svx	8svx 8SVX
	This alots type x-8svx to any file *.8svx or *.8SVX.

@{b}mailcap@{ub}
	This matches up a file to it's relevant viewer etc.

Example entry:	audio/*; SYS:Utilities/Multiview %s PUBSCREEN=AMosaic

	This  says  to  use Multiview, it will popup on the AMosaic screen and
enable  you to hear any (the '*') audio file that you have a datatype for.  If
you want to view amigaguide files with multiview but any other text files thru
ppmore then one way would be:

text/x-aguide; sys:Utilities/MultiView %s PUBSCREEN=AMosaic
text/*; sys:utilities/PPMore %s

@{b}prefs@{ub}
	This sets up some basic prefs of mosaic, such as:

		a) download directory.

		b) RexxMacro menu entries.
			NOTE:   The  format  of  this  has changed slightly in
		v1.3beta for hotlist operation.  they are no longer 'RexMacro1
		or 2'.  Use the following instead.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     AddToHotlist         "address command 'run <>NIL: amhotlist quickadd'"
     JumpToHotlist        "address command 'run <>NIL: amhotlist'"
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

		c) Cache size for images

		d) Wether to download 'icon' images or not.

		e) What 'Home Page' to use.

	There  are more, but RTFM.  @{"AMprefs" LINK ADAMP} is a useful way of modifying this
file.
				
@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE INTEST "TESTING..1,2,3"

1> Reboot you're Amiga, just in case, and open a Shell

2>  Type  'mosaic'.   The  mosaic  window  should open on top of the WorkBench
screen, drag it out to cover the whole screen.

3> It should be displaying an error message, don't worry, this is normal.

4>  Go  to  the Project menu and activate 'Open local'.  A file requester will
pop  up.   Type  'Amitcp:docs' into the drawer and 'index.html' into the file.
This will open the 'Amiga Mosaic Home Page'@{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow Amosaic.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK Amosaic.iff/main}. Now play to your hearts
content :)

5>  If  you  did'nt get this far, take a break, and go through the above steps
again CAREFULLY!  and RTFM!

6>  If  all  was  a success, now click on the close-gadget, this will save the
mosaic window's size for next time.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE INSCR "Screen of it's own?"

	Once  installed  AMosaic  will open on the WorkBench,  using the Prefs
program  for  MUI  you  can have it open on it's own screen with more than the
eight colors associated with MWB.  Here's how:

1>  Open  a  Shell  and  run Mosaic and then Quit it and close the Shell, this
enters Mosaic into the MUI Prefs list.

2>  Run  the  MUI Prefs prog @{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow MUI.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK MUI.iff/main},  click  on  the  popup  gadget to the
right  of  <<Global>>,  find  the  entry 'AmigaMosaic' and double click on it.
This should put it in the top window.

3>  Select  the  'System  Page'  from  the cycle gadget and click on the popup
gadget for 'Public Screen'.  Select 'New' from the bottom of the popup window,
and  then 'Edit'.  (Alternatively press 'p' then 'n' and lastly 'e') The 'Edit
window will be displayed.

4>  Enter  'AMosaic'  in  both  'Public  Screen'  and  'Public  Name'  in  the
'Attributes' page, also tick 'Interleaved' in the Flag section below.

5>  Select  the  'Display  Mode'  page and enter the Screen size and number of
colors you want for Mosaic.

6> Click on Okay.  You should now have AmigaMosaic displayed in the top window
and AMosaic displayed in the 'Public Screen' window.

7> Click on the cycle-gadget for 'Window refresh' until 'Simple' is displayed.

8> Click on the cycle-gadget for 'Redraw' until 'fast/ugly' is displayed.

9> Prefs should now appear like this @{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow MUI.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK MUI.iff/main}.
9> Click on 'Save' at the bottom of the Prefs window.

10>   Finally   the @{"Mailcap" LINK MPMOD}  needs  editing.   Open  a  Shell  and  type  'cd
envarc:mosaic'  hit  <RET>  and  then  type  'ed mailcap'.  This will run your
editor  and  load  in the mailcap file.  Wherever you see 'PUBSCREEN' you will
see  it  followed  by 'Mosaic'.  Change 'Mosaic' to 'AMosaic' (or whatever you
have called your Mosaic Screen!).

11> Once all done, save the file and re-boot your Amiga.

12>  TEST  it!   open  a  Shell  cd  to the directory where Mosaic is and type
'Mosaic'.   The  screen should flick to a new screen called AMosaic and mosaic
will  be  displayed showing an error that the default page could not be found.
This is normal do NOT worry, have kittens etc.

but  you have a general idea of what to do, but no idea of where it will lead.
You  feel  both  nervous  but excited by all the hype you've heard.  So you've
done  your  best,  got all the bits together that you need and you work up the
courage and decide to go for it!

	You  turn  on  your Amiga and startup AmiTCP with 'link up' or, if you
have  phil's @{"plink" LINK ADP} utility, 'plink up nospeak nomailkick'.  Once you have got
your  shell  prompt type 'mosaic'<RET>.  The screen should swap to the AMosaic
screen  and  mosaic  will be displayed.  Size it to whatever you want (usually
the  full  screen).  There should be a 'flashing' button in the lower right of
the  window,  showing  that things are working.  It is actually making contact
with the Home Page @{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow Amosaic.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK Amosaic.iff/main}. This is your springboard into the world of Mosaic.

	Once  loaded  you  will be presented with the latest 'Home page', this
will tell you of the latest version of Mosaic (v1.2.1 more of this in the next
editionof  this  FAQ),  and will provide all manner of choices of where to go,
what  to  see  and hear.  There is a test-suite to exercise your mosaic.  Some
will  work,  other  bits  won't  as  you  only have the basic DataTypes at the
moment.  See Useful add-ons for others.  For now though explore it!  That, I'm
afraid  is  the best way....  At the end of this FAQ I've included some @{"pages" LINK PAGES}
you may like to visit, @{"send me" LINK EPILOGUE} your fav page for inclusion here.

@NODE ADDONS "USEFUL ADD-ONS"

	In  general  if  you are looking for something for mosaic, then have a
look in:

	Demon:	/pub/amiga/mosaic

As  always,  after  downloading  and unpacking, RTFM FIRST!!  I'm as guilty as
anyone  else,  but try to get into the habit if you don't want to be flamed on
the Net.  Here are some of my favorite extras:

	@{"*" LINK ADAMP} AMPrefs

	@{"*" LINK ADAHL} Hotlist

	@{"*" LINK ADMSH} Mosaic Shunt

	@{"*" LINK ADMS} MosaicSave

	@{"*" LINK ADDT} DataTypes

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADUU "UUhtml_09b"

Location:
	Demon:	pub/amiga/amitcp/util/UUhtml_09b.lha

Use:
	While  you  can  read  news from within mosaic, until now, if you were
reading  one  of  binary.picture groups and tried to get a picture it would be
corrupted  because  mosaic  adds @{"html" LINK HTMLINFO} 'bits. Well phil produced this 'bit' of
Arexx code to restore the picture to it's former glory ;)

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADAMP "AMPrefs"

Screenshot@{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow AMosaic-AMprefs.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK AMosaic-AMprefs.iff/main}

Location:
	The  only  place I could find this was on the Amiga Home Page when you
first  load  up Mosaic.  To download it just click on 'here', where AMprefs is
mentioned,  this will take you to the 'FTP Page', then click on the file name.
It  will be downloaded, a requester will then popup asking for a directory and
a filename.  Type in the path of your download directory and 'AMprefs.lha' for
a filename.

Use:
	With it you can change all kinds of things that affect mosaic, such as
the  Home  Document, Download Dir, what fonts to use and the entries under the
Arexx menu.  Very useful.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADAHL "HOTLIST"

Screenshot @{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow AMosaic-hotlist.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK AMosaic-hotlist.iff/main}

Location:
	Aminet	comm/tcp/AMHotlistV1.50.lha
	Demon	pub/amiga/mosaic/AMHotlistV1.50.lha
Use:
	While 'on' the Web:

i)  If  you've  found  a page you like you can save it's location by selecting
'Addto Hotlist' under the Arrex Menu.

ii)  To  goto a fav page select 'Hotlist' under the Arrex menu.  A window will
pop up with a list of pages, double-click on one to goto it.  IF a window does
NOT popup see the hint below.

HINT:   Hotlist  should be made to run on Mosaic's screen, just like Mosaic :)
as follows:
	a) Perform point 12> from 'A screen of it's own' above.

	b)  Select Hotlist from the Arrex Menu.  Hotlist will probably open on
Workbench, so goto the Workbench screen and click the Hotlist close gadget, go
back to Mosaic's screen and quit mosaic.

	c) Start MUi's prefs prog ( does this sound familiar ;) ? )

	d)  Goto  the  'System' page, Click the popup gadget at the Top of the
window and double-click on 'Amigamosaic-Hotlist'.

	e)  Click  on the popup-gadget for 'Public Screen' and double-click on
the AMosaic entry.

	f)  Finally click on 'Save' and TEST it by performing steps a) and b),
you  should  be rewarded by seeing the Hotlist window displayed on the Amosaic
creen.  8)

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADMSH "Mosaic Shunt"

Location:
	Supplied with Mosaic1.2
Use:
	Once  you  have seen a picture or heard a sound you have the option of
saving  it  to  your  HD  for  seeing/hearing or generally playing around with
later. See @{"MosaicSave" LINK ADMS}.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADMS "MOSAICSAVE"

Location:
	Demon	pub/amiga/mosaic/MosaicSave.lha
Use:
	This  is  an  alternative to @{"Mosaic Shunt" LINK ADMSH}.  After spawning an external
viewer, the picture/sound can be saved for later manipulation/viewing.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADDT "DATATYPES"

i) @{b}ZGIF@{ub}

Location:
	Demon	pub/amiga/mosaic/ZGIFDataType39.7.lha
Use:
	It  is a very fast GIF picture viewer.  Useful in that most if not all
pictures/icons etc that you see in Mosaic are actually GIF pictures of various
sizes.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADP "Plink 2.1"

Location:
	Demon	pub/amiga/amitcp/extras/plink21.lha
Use:
	Not  Absolutely  needed,  but  makes  AmiTCP  a lot easier to control.
Definatively  recommended,  phil's  done  a  nice  job here and it takes up so
little  room it should really be included in the distribution.  (End of grovel
:),  honest  I'm not on commission...).  BTW, this is a newer version with all
kinds  of  things  added,  and yes!  ANOTHER update is clawing it's way out of
phil's overworked 1200...

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADTM "TOOLMANAGER" 

Screenshot @{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow MyWorkbench.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK MyWorkbench.iff/main}

Location:
	Aminet:	util/boot/ToolManager21bin.lha
Use:
	Again,  not  needed,  but very useful.  You can use dock-icons to run,
not  only  mosaic  but  AmiTCP  and any other prog you use regularily.  If you
don't  know  what a dock-icon is...  basically if you drag a program icon onto
the  WorkBench,  that is a dock-icon in it's simplest form!  The dock-icon can
also  run  a  script to unarc files, show pictures, play sounds or perform any
other  action  you would want.  You can also 'drop' files onto it, ie pictures
onto  a  DPaint dock-icon, this will boot up DPaint and load the pic.  Try it,
you'll like it!

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADMWB "MAGIC WORKBENCH"

Screenshot @{"2.x" System "SYS:c/PPShow MyWorkbench.iff"}/@{"3.x" LINK MyWorkbench.iff/main}

Location:
	Aminet:	biz/demo/MagicWB20d.lha
Use:
	This  is  a luxury, but well needed!  Basically it's 'just' a bunch of
fancy  icons  and  backdrops.  BUT it makes WorkBench far more pleasurable and
easy  on the eye.  It's currently up to v2.0 On Aminet, this is the demo ONLY,
to  use it again, you must register.  Combine this with @{"ToolManager" LINK ADTM} for a good
looking and useful WorkBench.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADASX "AmiSOX"

Location:
	Aminet: mus/edit/AmiSOX33.lha
Use:
	It is a global audio file converter for listening to samples/sounds.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADEPL "EdPlayer"

Location:
	Aminet:	mus/play/EdPlyr21.lha
Use:
	This enables you to listen to songs. ie MODs and MEDs.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADOP "Oplay"

Location:
	Aminet:	mus/play/oplay1231.lha
Use:
	A  multi-format  sampled sound player.  This is preffered by many over
@{"AmiSOX" LINK ADASX}.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADMPEG "Mp103"

Location:
	Aminet:	gfx/show/mp103.lha
Use:
	Enables  viewing  of  @{"MPEG" LINK MPEGS}  files, compatible with AGA Amigas, needs a
68020 at least and min of 2MEG of memory to flex it's muscles.
	
@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADPP "PPShow"

Location:
	Aminet:	gfx/show/PPShow40.lha
Use:
	This  is  a  very handy viewer.  It can display most formats, ie IFFs,
JPEGs, GIFs and also ANIMs.  It can also display them if they are PowerPacked.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADJP "jpegAGA"

Location:
	Aminet:	gfx/show/jpegAGA11.lha
Use:
	VERY  high  quality  JPEG  viewer.   Please  note this is ONLY for AGA
machines.There  are  two versions, one for 68020s and one for 68040s plus FPU.
Also the sources are vailable for all you hackers.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE MPEGS "A nite at the movies"

	Basically,  these are anim files that are highly compressed using JPEG
methods.   There  are  several versions of Amiga-compatible players available.
On my 1200 I use @{"mp103" LINK ADMPEG}.

	Have  a  look  in  Aminet:gfx/show  for  other  players  and  also  in
Aminet:gfx/conv if you want to mess around and make your own Mpegs.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE SOUNDS "I can't hear you"

	In  order  to playback a sound you need a soundplayer.  ;) Several are
recommended, such as @{"AmiSOX" LINK ADASX}, @{"EdPlayer" LINK ADEPL} and @{"oplay" LINK ADOP}.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PICTURES "Viewing Pictures"

	Pictures  for the Amiga come in several formats, the main ones you are
likely to come across are @{"IFF" LINK ADPP},@{"JPEG" LINK ADJP} and @{"GIF" LINK ADPP}.

@{b}IFF@{ub}
	Originally  formulated  by  the writers of DPaint, I believe.  The IFF
format has been expanded to include other filetypes such as text.

@{b}JPEG@{ub}
	This  is  a format that allows high compaction rates on picture files,
it is almost a universal format for xchange of picture files between different
machines. It is capable of holding full 24-bit 16 million colour pictures.

@{b}GIF@{ub}
	A  file format popular on the PC [spit!  spit :{] it is limited to 256
colours.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE KINGCON "KingCON"

	This is a replacement for CON:  It has a scrollback review buffer, you
can  "drop" files into it instead of typing them, file completion etc.  If you
use  the  Shell/cli a lot then you can't really do without it.  you'll find it
on Aminet in:

	pub/aminet/util/shell/KingCON_1.3.lha

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PAGES "INTERESTING PAGES"

	When  you  first run mosaic, you will be taken to what is known as the
AMosaic  Home Page.  This page will tell you about the latest version, various
utilities  and  you will find a number of Pages that are like a springboard to
start  you  of exploring the World Wide Web.  Just watch your phone bill :( In
the mean time I have found this page:

	a) @{"*" LINK IPY} Yello

	b) @{"*" LINK HTMLINFO} HTML info

Yes,  I  know this might look boring to you...  only two pages :( Send me your
pages, I don't care what the subject is.  If you like it, it SHOULD be here.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE IPY "YELLO"

@{b}http://yello.space.net/yello@{ub}

	If  you  like Yello (the Music Group!), you will love this page.  It's
full  of  info,  samples  etc.  There's even an Mpeg file of part of their new
video  from  Zebra, their new Album.  However, be warned it is 1.1MB long.  It
takes  a  good  10  mins to download, and if you want to play it within Mosaic
make  sure  you  have enough memory ( I've got 6MB and could'nt run it!  :( ).
Please note a certain magazine (no names no pack-drill) forgot to put 'net' in
the URL!  tut tut....

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CWIND "Close that window!"

	Just  a  little hintette for those that are really tight on memory and
have to watch every byte/word.  Close ALL windows and folders on the WorkBench
screen  that are not needed.  ie The only window open should be the Shell that
you are running AmiTCP from.  Also turn off and clear the Buffer review if you
are using @{"KingCON" LINK KINGCON}.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE RNEWS "This is the nine o'clock News"

	Nahhh.. not really. But if you want to read a NewsGroup while online,
simply do the following:

	a) Add 'setenv NNTPSERVER 158.152.254.254' in the Startnet script that
resides  in  AmiTCP:bin/  NOTE  this number is for Demon, replace it with your
local provider's number.

	b) Once you've logged on and run mosaic, open a URL (from the menu) in
the form of <news://newsgroup> for example news://demon.ip.support.amiga.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE STPAGES "Stop the pages"

	Clicked  on  a  Page  by  mistake?   Wanna  stop it?  Simply click the
flashing gadget at the lower-right part of your screen. It's either a flashing
button (v1.2) or a 'clock' (v1.3).

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE FORMS "Where's the form?"

	Some  Web-sites  ask  me  to  enter  some text, how?  These are called
forms,  which  is  something Amosaic will PROBABLY never have.  However, there
are two "solutions".

	a)  Some  sites  ask  only  for  a  simple string input, in which case
Amosaic  will  open  a string gadget.  An example of this is the Cardiff Movie
Database at http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/

	b) Use Emacs and some Arexx!  I have not tried it yet, this was posted
on the  @{"Amosaic Mailing-List" LINK AMLIST}.  IF  you are feeling brave @{"CLICK HERE" LINK FORMSEXP} and see
what's needed.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE TGIF "Transparent GIF's"

	What is it?
		It  is a picture format (GIF!) that allows a background colour
to be transparent.  Much like when you are in DPaint and hit b (for brush) and
cut  a section of the picture.  when you move that brush over you picture, you
can 'see through' the background colour.  For more info check out:

	http://dragon.jpl.nasa.gov/~adam/transparent.html
	http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html#transparent

GifTool (from Home Pages, Inc.) has been ported to the Amiga by (I believe)
Jeff Thieleke. It supports transparent GIFs.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CICONIFY "Iconify?"

	In  a  word  DON'T!  Sometimes it will work, sometimes it won't and it
will crash your Amiga!  It is a recognised bug and will hopefully be killed in
a future release.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE WPRINT "Where's the text?"

	When  you download a page, if text headings do not print to the screen
properly (ie all letters are printed in one space!) then before running mosaic
run  the  Amosaic  prefs program and explicitly state the fonts to be used.  I
use:

------- ENVARC:mosaic/prefs  START -----------------------
Font                 times/13
ItalicFont           times/13/italic
BoldFont             times/13/bold
FixedFont            courier/13
AddressFont          courier/13

H2Font               times/18
H3Font               times/15
H4Font               times/13
H5Font               times/11
H6Font               times/11
------- ENVARC:mosaic/prefs  END -------------------------

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE PDISP "Paths and Pictures"

	"I  use  Multiview  to display pixs, I have set the SCREEN tooltype so
that  it  will  display on it's own screen.  But in mosaic, it shows up on the
workbench in a window."

	For  some  reason  if  you  don't specify the FULL path multiview will
ignore it's tooltypes, so use the following:

------------------------------------------------------
image/*;  sys:Utilities/MultiView %s PUBSCREEN=AMosaic
------------------------------------------------------

	Actually, this should be followed for all progs in the mailcap.

@ENDNODE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE BUGREP "A Bug-Report"

	The following was posted on the mosaic mail-list, I'll say no more,
just read and remember it when you start changing your mailcap file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: mjw@alfonz.boltz.cs.cmu.edu
Subject: A bug report and explaination

A  correspondant has sent me the following bug report (automatically generated
by some debug code I put in amosaic.  I am sending it to the mailing list too,
so  the  general amosaic using public knows what to do if they hit this "bug".
(It's not actually a bug, as you will see below).

----report --------

 Please  send email to witbrock@cs.cmu.edu telling him that you passed through
the  unsupported  pipe  code  and  which  URL  it  happened  on.   say  '((cat
T:3ZAT3.0010.jpeg | egs:egsshow); /bin/rm -f T:3ZAT3.0 010.jpeg) &'Also say:

   file HTFWriter.c:HTSaveAndExecute line 480 compiled Oct 10 1994 01:27:08


---- end -----

OK,  I  finally found out what causes this about a month ago.  It happens when
people mis-configure their mailcap files by putting e.g.

     image/jpeg  egs:egsshow

instead of

     image/jpeg  egs:egsshow %s

in  the  former  case, mosaic doesn't know what to do with the file it got, so
it,  thinking that it belongs on unix, tries to pipe it into the viewer.  In a
future  version,  I  will probably just have it assume that it should make the
file  the  first  argument to the viewer program.  In the meantime, if you get
this bug, or one of your mates does, check that your mailcap file is correct.

(something is about to happen.... something wonderful)

	Here's  the obligatory 'not my fault' clause.  Though I have taken all
due  care  in putting this FAQ together, I cannot/will not be held responsible
for  any damage,loss of data,typos or any other inconveinience caused directly

	Having  said that, this FAQ is a 'History' of my experiences, and I've
had no problems except actually finding out what to do in the first place.


@{b}THE FUTURE@{ub}
	Well,  we have three versions of mosaic now, though I suggest only 1.2
or 1.3beta should be used.  There are rumours of 'IBrowse' from the developers
of  Amosaic,  and  that should support forms finally.  There are also at least
THREE  other readers that are in the alpha/beta stage and ALMOST ready for the
hungry hordes to devour.

	Above all, have fun and watch the phone-bills.
