The Sam Report
Tuesday, June 13, 1995


It now appears that CEI may play an important role afterall in the
Amiga future in the Americas!   No contract has been signed, and
many details have yet to be worked out, but Escom has told Alex Amor
that they want CEI on the Amiga Technologies team.   A top-level
meeting is to be held within the next two weeks in Norristown for
discussions on future responsibilities and the terms of the
alliance.   Alex is cautiously hopeful that any conditions
offered by Escom will be sufficiently attractive to warrant his
signing a contractual agreement with the German firm.

Meanwhile, Alex is proceeding with plans to open a new CEI
operation in ... Toronto!   It was not clear from our conversation
whether this is predicated on an alliance with Escom becoming a
reality, or "other" CEI plans, or both.   At any rate, the CEI
corporate aircraft is about to go into service and new de-icing
gear has been installed for frequent trips North from Miami.

For the first time in a while, I can sense that maybe ... just
maybe, things are starting to come together at last for the
future of our Amiga in this hemisphere.

This has been the Sam Report from Miami for Genie.
