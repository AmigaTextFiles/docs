Subject: @{b}[warpup] weird behaviour of warpup-emu@{ub}

Yesterday i tried out the Softcinema movieplayer but all i got was
a "not executable" error. Since i use the powerup-emu very rarely (most
programs important to me are available as Warpup versions) i never
met this problem before. So i looked into the WarpUp drawer for
helpfiles or something and fiddled around with the programs in the
/powerupemu/tests/ drawer. All the .ELF programs refused to execute.
Then i run objattr_demo (I guess its an 68k executable) and guess
what: Afterwards all the .ELF including Softcinema executed just
fine. After a reboot my amiga showed the old behaviour again until
running that objattr_demo a second time. Strange, isn't it?
Can somebody explain this?
Im running warpup4 and the 0.8d powerup emu. I dont know the ENV-var
values at the moment, only that "terminator" is 1. If they are of 
interest i have to look them up on my amiga at home.

Regards, Walter Heinitz.

And you do this because PUP programs expect the ppc.library to be resident in ram, the reason why all programs run after that demo of yours is because it loads the ppc.library into ram (something which all the newer PUP progs should do - but then again, if you are making a PPC program why not use WOS ?)

Hello ,

Does anyone knows why WarpOS on my system works only if
mmu.library is loaded in memory?
(I have BlizzPPC 040/25Mh 603/200Mh , AGA ,OS 3.5)
I have tried many other 68040 libraries , and the one from OS3.5
but the problem persists , if mmu.library is not loaded
I get :
* Task  : 779E62B8 "ramlib"*
* Error : 80000002 (DEADEND)*
* By    : System*
* Cause : Hardware bus fault/access error*
from MCP GURU requester.
I have tried even a clean startup (no user , no wbstartup)
but same error
The only way i can run WarpOS is by using mmu.library!
Any ideas?

regards
                  jm

do you use blizkick ? if so do you use the module bppcfix040 module if so
this module
removes the 68040/68060 libraries from memory and therefore it requires the
mmu.library 680x0 libraries (IF you are using a blizzppc)

With kind regards,

Yes I am using Blitzkick but not the bppcfix/bppcfix040 module (cause by
using the extresbuf feature of blitzkick my memory fragmentize like hell).
I am using BPPCFix from a line on startup-sequence before setpatch,
so there is not sign of rom  resident ppc/68040 libraries..
But in case you want to know, I have tried to boot without startup without
even blitzkick (from cold) but again WarpOS only likes mmu.library.

Well I am using RomFixes module with Blitzkick, which does the same thing ,

I think also that ramlib stack problem is fixed with SetPatch.

I know an easy solution to reduce ramlib crashes ... OS3.9...

Before (3.5) I had similar problems ...
It showed usefull on my system (603-200 040-25) to remove
some of the envarc:sys/#?.prefs like wbpattern.

When executed later it's never crashed. Usefull ,too was to execute
Rexxmast really early ... somewhere in startup-sequence.

I've even removed my beloved akDT's and replaced them by WarpDT's.

From: Paul Heams <paul@heams.freeserve.co.uk>
Date: 02-16-01 18:47:01
Subject: @{b}[warpup] Morph into Warp@{ub}

Hello All,

Well things on this mailing list appear a little quiet as of late. So I
thought I'd mail a copy of some notes I found about WarpOS emulation in
MorphOS. - Thats right, for those of you that don't already know the
latest version of MorphOS contains WOS emulation.

Unfortuantely, I was unable to test the emulation as the latest version
of MorphOS refuses to run on my machine (previous versions of MOS have run
without problems). So instead I looked through the "wosemulation" notes and
came accross the following which may be interesting for some (especially the
creators of WarpOS), and may also add a bit of discussion here:

Extract below taken from "wosemuppc.notes" in the latest MorphOS archive.

BFN,

Paul.

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **

Some general notes about emu and warpos in general.. During the programming
i found some annoyances in wos design, which i try to list here. This is
not ment to be "wos bashing", just some things which warpos developers will
face too if they ever plan to have 68k emulation and/or native OS. Also
this could be interesting reading for all wos developers.

 - Memory system is weird.. If you have a shell and launch ppcprog1 which
   allocates mem and doesn't release it, then run ppcprog2 which calls
   FreeAllMem() also the memory allocated by ppcprog1 is freed. :) This
   is duplicated in the emu.

 - First wos program launched in a shell allocates signals and never
   releases them. This confuses for example WShell. Not emulated.

 - All internal structures are public! User shouldn't need to know about 
   the internal new fields in msgport and semaphore structures... Luckily, 
   most software seem to ignore them, so i just used the exec equivalents
   without the extra fields.

 - Above is much worse with TaskPPC.. TaskPPC is an exec task with some
   new fields appended. Sounds nice, but how can i call dos.library with a
   task? Wosemu allocates TaskPPC for each warpos process, and tries to
   keep that in sync with the real process struct.. Would be a lot easier
   if we could just define struct TaskPPC == struct Process. I tried that
   actually, it was quite ok but showtasks and similar programs show funny
   values.. :) and taskid's are random. So it's not a very good solution,
   but might be in the future when we have native dos.library..

 - According to wos history.txt, it is possible to signal a ppc task by
   using exec/Signal().. What's the point in this? Now, if wos tasks were 
   processes, this would work automatically, but with the current system
   it requires an exec patch. Real wos does this patch, wosemu doesn't. No 
   software seems to use it and imho it's dirty.

 - WOS is documented as using PowerOpen ABI, yet even some wos example
   programs (WarpRace) violates this by expecting library functions to
   preserve CTR register.. I had to add CTR store/restore to each library
   function to make it work properly. Annoyance and unnecessary slowdown.

 - WarpOS allows user programs to enter supervisor mode and access MMU
   tables. This is a big no-no in any modern os, and is not (can't be
   and shouldn't be and won't be) emulated. Most software doesn't use
   these anyway.

 - Run68k and RunPPC have way too many methods to pass arguments.. Float
   arguments are almost never used, yet they take a lot of time to
   initialize. Also stack arguments are useless, user can pass a pointer
   to stack in some register if that's needed.. Currently, wosemu supports
   all argument types in RunPPC, and only integer/stack in Run68k. I doubt
   that ppc code calls 68k fpu code very often..

 - Run68k autodoc doesn't specify if you are supposed to initialize A6
   or not, when calling OS functions. And of course some programs don't
   initialize it. So I just copy the base to A6 before calling..

 - WOS gcc startup code relocates the code, then calls RunPPC. This is ok
   in real wos because RunPPC always flushes all caches, but in wosemu
   i had to add extra (unnecessary) cache flush there. That's why RunPPC
   results in WarpRace are not so brilliant as you might expect.

 - WOS has some PPC library functions that are documented to preserve all
   registers.. Weird stuff.

 - WOS has alignment emulation for FPU. PPC can only access longword
   aligned memory when loading/storing float registers. If unaligned memory
   is addressed, an "illegal alignment exception" is thrown. In warpos, the
   exception handler then does the memory access, and returns back to the
   program.. This gives the programmer the impression that everything is
   working fine, which really isn't the case.. Emulated access is probably
   over 100 times slower than regular mem access, so by simply fixing the 
   alignment the program could be much faster. This is similar to using 
   the 64bit math instructions in 060, they are emulated too and clever
   programmers avoid them. 
   Morphos currently doesn't have alignment emulation, so any program that
   uses this will fail. Even in the future when alignment emulation
   probably is implemented, it will still output a full debug dump so the
   programmer can immediately notice that something is wrong.
   So far, only program affected this is the "DeathTrial" demo by Mankind.
   However, they have already created a fixed version.

I only realised this while working on Sid4Amiga some time ago. I couldn't
understand why a new version was so much slower than the previous release.
After retracing my steps I reverted a STRUCT and BANG - fast again. (It would
have been nice for Storm C to mention it as a warning).

Agreed. I think that WarpOS emulation in MorphOs is a very good thing. (It
will be even better once I've worked out why it isn't running on my system
anymore). I will also continue coding in WarpOS.

There is a new environment variable in WOS V5: powerpc/EnAlignExc.
Set it to "1" and you will get rid of the annoying floating point
alignment exception handler forever.

 True !
just one routine (metaball init at start and metaballs themselves)
used a struct with word+float. I wasn't aware about that emulation,
now I am and will never spread progs with non-4bytes aligned float/doubles.

but I don't really agree on the *100 speeder without emulation,
the ppc cache masks that kind of things.
(to my mind maybe 1.5 times slower that's all. maybe wrong.)

 I don't assume to be the only one with trouble. Anyone using
ShowHALInfo , tool provided with warpos , can notice that
other wos executable generates fpuemus. (some dataypes and 
some mp3 encoder, i've been told.)  
it's easy to generate one,just use:

struct  iwanttobothertimu
{
    short        iamshort;
    float        iamfloat;
}

 As I'm a very insane person, I 'm craving for what will come next
in the mailing list; It's always funny to see people hating each others,
and throwing stones. Morphos team seemed to have done a very good job,
and a wos emu is exactly what they needed to make the wos team very angry,
since it's the same blow than with "powerup" emu on warpos.
Will AmigaDE have a morphos emu ? well, at least amigaDE will be an "amiga".

 For myself I don't mind !!  i will continue coding under warpos, 
aligning my floats, and my future demos will run on both warpos and
morphos. G4 will came, we will have G4 with both morphos and warpos,
and it will work.

 I will just sit and look at the war h&p and amiga against morphos. 
ah ah ah ... and both are too stupid to unify their effort !!!

Hi folks,

I have tried this ENV-variable (set to "1") with the result, that it ENABLES
the exception-handler (lots of proggies using floating-calculations
freeze).
I suppose we better leave this ENV-variable untouched (deleted or set to
"0").

I want to say : release it for CyberstormPPC now and release a fixed version
(+patch available through microcode website) for BlizzardPPC later : we are

whats the issue then? they should release it for CSPPC owners and keep
plugging away at the BPPC version for BPPC owners. that'd not only ease
the minds of the 'big box people' but allow info/news to flow which'd ,
hopefully, increase sales

Well according to drew H&P doesn't have any A1200's with BPPC's so therefore
most stuff
that is released might not have been tested (internally) as much as it
should have been on the most sold hardware, case in point WarpUp V5,
ArtEffect (which crashes during certain circumstances -but v4 is a lot
better than v1-) the worst case is WarpUp V5 (but that's not H&P's strictly
speaking -I think-) since it makes several programs apparently crash
without any real reason.
GLQuakeWOS (actually all Quake's compiled for WOS)  is one culprit (even
though one probably argue whose fault that is), haven't tried Heretic-II
but I excpect that one to fall over too.

most probably the usual reason, programmers taking shortcuts or making

Setting EnAlignExc to a "1" is supposed to pass the alignment exception
on to the program like other exceptions instead of trying to handle
it itself.  It doesn't quite work that way in the current release of
Warp; I'm using a newer version with changes made to that.  iFUSION
will require EnAlignExc set, so if you find any software that fails
when EnAlignExc is set, report it to the author and to Sam Jordan
at H&P.  If it fails with that set, it means the program isn't properly
aligning data, either integer and/or floating point.  This is bad in
that it degrades performance of the program, and although WarpOS
has handled the fault it generates, it won't when iFUSION is running.

I can say that the problem drew describes happens to me when I try & do lotsa multi-tasking (Memory intensive stuff ya know).  So is this true then, that BPPC's aren't actually testing while WarpOS is being coded ?

None. It can cause errors, or better: alignment exceptions. :)

Any program which fails after setting this variable wastes per-
formance by badly aligned data (mostly floating point data).

No. It disables the alignment exception handler. Now misaligned
data accesses will cause an exception.

As a developer I would set it to "1", to make sure that your
programs don't cause any exception. Otherwise there is no way to
find this out. Your programs will only show a small performance
degradation.

more likely the problems are caused by many coders having 604e's and not
realising the problems that the 603e's may have - and also this
data-alignment thing is really a very much hidden problem.
(one that rears its ugly head when you set the correct env variable to
show the problematic programs)

Bullshit! Microcode suxxs! Are two years that they said "FusionPPC is
completed! It runs fast and stable" and so on. Joe and Jim are simply
thief.
If they want to show that Ifusion is reality (and not a simply ALPHA idea),
they can release a test version with BIG limitations (NO HD support, NO
audio, NO ethernet, serial and parallel support etc).

Is Ifusion Super-Vaporware?

PS
I remember a note of one year ago (december 1999) by Jim Drew:" Ifusion is
near ... we hope for a January release" ... 
...(yes, January 2000!!!!)

Hello Jesper

Hi there,

The first problem happens on all the four machines which we tested it on.
After modifying the tooltype of PlayCD (selecting the device and unit) a
requester says "SCSI Error". The program then exits. This happens also on
Plextor drives. Anybody?

Finally, AMPlifier often crashes at the end of a file when a block is not
completely downloaded (although there were no crashes using the
MAS-player). The programs hangs at that time.

Best regards,

Hi

Since I installed WarpOs from the OS3.9 CD there are several programs that
throws some kind of error message and hangs. For example YAM says this
while creating user interface:

PowerPC Data access exception (load operation)
Page fault - Access to FFFFFFFD
The excepting instruction is located at 760C3004
Task name: 'YAM_PPC'  Task address: 7685BE28  Task I

And a couple of registers etc...

Other programs do the same thing, Scout for instance. I didn't even think
Scout had a ppc-task and for yam I have never installed the morphos ppc
version.

I assume this is not the fault of either Yam nor warpos (unless it's
somehow related to the EnAlignExc thing), but it worked before and now it
don't. What can be wrong with my installation/setup?

I don't know what kind of info that would help nailing down the problem,
I'm not using any patches not found on the aos3.9 CD except for the 
eide'99 controller.

I would agree.


> I don't know what kind of info that would help nailing down the problem,

Perhaps you are using ppclibemu V0.8c and there are some programs
(a datatype?) which open ppc.library during startup? YAM might use
PPC datatypes too.

Get ppclibemu V0.8f and try again. The V0.8c which comes with
WarpOS V5 has a bug.

Sure, if you like ultrahigh latencies and slow file I/O, go ahead, do it.
If there was an 68k emulator for WarpOS, things would be different, but
there isn't.

I don't think I use ppclibemu (maybe I should...?). I have a Blizzard 603e
board and the folowing is in my startup-sequense:

(first line:) bppcfix >nil: install
some assigns...
loadlib libs:ppc.library
...

I read somewhere that loadlib was a more system friendly way of putting
the correct version of ppc.library in memory than different patches etc.

Where can I find ppclibemu 0.8f? I only found 0.8d on aminet.

How should I set the settings in the preferences? I have tried most
combinations and can't see any difference no matter what.. (yes I have
rebooted in between...)

You initialized ppc.library although you said above that you don't
use the ppc.library emulation? Makes not much sense...

I think you have ppclibemu installed. If it were the original li-
brary, you would have bigger problems. ;)


> I read somewhere that loadlib was a more system friendly way of putting

Better use PPCInstall. LoadLib will not increase the OpenCnt of
the library, so it might get removed from memory on the next memo-
ry flush.


> Where can I find ppclibemu 0.8f? I only found 0.8d on aminet.

Sorry... I looked into my history file for the most recent version,
but 0.8f was not yet released. :)

Get the 0.8e from my home page (this is the first version which
supports Voyager's VFlash plugin).


> How should I set the settings in the preferences?

I don't know what's best for BPPC owners, but I have the following:

Terminator = 1
EnAlignExc = 1
NoPatch = 1
SegInfo = 64

If you look on the bottom of Frank's Email in his sig there is his homepage which has the latest (e) version.  I downloaded it & then went to a Flash enabled website with Voyager - WOW !

i never was able to use ppc.library (0.8e) and vflash without a crash

so maybe it should work ok but it definitely does not here.

the first three lines are:

If I add REBOOT to bppcfix I will have three reboots before the system comes
up.. I rather find a way to skip the reboot in setpatch or the eide driver
to make things a bit faster.
But of course the main thing is to have a stable system, so if you say it's
beter with the extra boot, I will try it.

Uh.. Sorry, I thought ppclibemu was a program...
So I am using it, version 0.8d as it seems (now updated to 0.8e)

I found where I read it: In your README-file in the ppclibemu-package: 

    "Please remove PPCInstall from your startup-sequence. You will get
    the same effect by using "loadlib path:ppc.library", but don't
    place the call before "C:Copy >NIL: ENVARC: RAM:ENV ALL NOREQ" !"

Never read the readme's ;-)

So where do I find ppcinstall? I can't find it on your homepage (though I
found some other very impressive stuff). It's not on Aminet nor in the WOS
package and a search on Google only gave me 8 pages teling me NOT to use
ppcinstall...

My current status is:
I have reinstalled MUI and removed all datatypes, no difference.
After trying mostly everything I have came to the conclution that Yam (and
the other programs) work if I:

* Remove bppcfix from startup-sequence (which results in a milion 'Warning
blah, blah, Terminate / Cancel'-messages where I press cancel) OR

* Run snoopdos first... (what?!)
The only thing that have to be monitored is the LoadSeg-calls (since it's
one of them that goes wrong...) Once I have started Yam once, I can close
it and SnoopDos and then run all programs without problems.

So now my question is: What is Snoopdos doing that obviously heals all
broken parts of the system?

I wonder if this may be related to that picture.datatype bug that existed
once. What version of picture.datatype and ilbm.datatype are safe to use?

With those reboots after it I wouldn't be sure.
Best way is to test it:

Allow it to do all reboots & then bring up the boot-menu, select boot without startup-sequence.  Try typing 'C:Version ppc.library FULL'
It should report an error as the emulation library won't have been loaded into memory & as far as I know it won't touch the libs diiectory unless you are in that directory (cd libs/) which would bring up the following response:
ppc.library 46.33 (16/12/00)
Emulation v0.8e by Frank Wille <frank@phoenix.owl.de>

Theres really no stable/non-stable way of removing the ppc.library from memory.
It either works or it dosn't.

You don't need an extra boot.
The one who give you this advice has probably forgotten that with OS 3.5+
setpatch do the reboot, so the reboot option becoma useless in the BPPCfix
command.

I use ppcinstall for months and it works fine.
PPCINSTALL is on phase5 archives: I've found it on my first flashrom update

loadseg calls? so there are Power-up apps called when you launch YAM?
AkDT???

Are you using akdatatypes? In that case, your problems come from the call of
the datatypes by MUI... For my part I use warpdatatypes and each time I
desactivate warp-os I encounter problem with some 68K apps such as
Stricq... etc..
So I guess it could be that.

If you read my email you would see I wasn't sure about this so suggested a test to prove it.  As you have confirmed that it does substitute the REBOOT command then a test isn't needed :-)  (There, are we all smiley now?)

I changed my mind. I always used LoadLib and had no problems. But
now I found a few ones where it's better to use a utility which
really opens the library, instead of only loading it into memory.


> So where do I find ppcinstall?

Part of PowerUp. Or take Sebastian Jedruszkiewicz's ppcInstall-
clone (I forgot the name). The next ppclibemu release will come
with an own utility, which is a bit more flexible.

I hate it to have to put ppc.library into LIBS: to be able to
use PPCInstall, so I never used it.

Then you have original PowerUp running, and WarpOS tries to ter-
minate it! Ouch! ;)

This is definitely no solution!

I have no idea.

Check all your datatypes for PowerUp versions! Eliminate them all
and replace them with M68k or WOS-versions.

I'm using this picture datatype:
  picture.datatype 44.19 (01.10.99)

Maybe you should avoid the OS3.9 one. I heard about some problems.

If you use WarpUp (and maybe PowerUp under emulation) get mmulib.lha from
Aminet. It's pretty good.

cyberguard is for 68k (it's phase5's enforcer clone)
use mmu.library's muforce instead

KS > Should i use another one as i am a WarpUp user or stick with the

is there a enforcer clone for warpup (or pup or mos for that matter) don't
think so.

Hello WarpUP user,
can help their me, some time ago I already once these problems much
described (that is for a very long time ago). Ok one, therefore my
configuration: A4K, CS/CVPPC, CGX 4.Rel.7, OS39, power subroutine in the
current (Voyager) version. PowerUP subroutine programs operate under this
environment very well. Only WarpUP does not say any words, I have already
very much tried out however nothing help. Have their desire me me the
problem (again) to concern??

PS. SAM Jordan, hello SAM, had given me up damalig after hundred :) Mails

Hallo WarpUP Anwender,

vieleicht koennt Ihr mir ja helfen, vor einiger Zeit habe ich schon einmal
diese
Probleme geschildert (das ist sehr lange her).

Ok, also meine Konfiguration : A4K, CS/CVPPC, CGX 4.Rel.7, OS39, PowerUP in
der aktuellen
(Voyager) Version. PowerUP-Programme arbeiten unter dieser Umgebung sehr
gut.
Nur WarpUP sagt kein Mucks, ich habe schon sehr viel ausprobiert aber nichts
hilft.

Habt Ihr Lust mir mir das Problem (noch einmal) anzugehen ??

PS. Sam Jordan, hallo Sam, hatte damalig nach hunderten Mails aufgegeben und

Well, for most purposes were you use enforcer on 68k (for example tracking 
down crashes/illegal memory accesses...) you can use the PPC Crash Requester 
instead (together with tools like memowner and findhit).
