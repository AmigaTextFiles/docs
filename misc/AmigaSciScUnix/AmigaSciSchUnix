|$VER: Amiga_Science/School/UNIX_FAQ 4.03 (29.09.93)

|This document supersedes AmigaSciSchool version 4.02, and before.

 This FAQ is cross-posted around the middle of each month to
 comp.sys.amiga.applications, comp.unix.amiga, comp.answers and news.answers

|also available on AmiNet sites: text/doc/AmigaSciSchUnix.lha

 The news.answers automatic archiving software will store a copy of this
 posting, available by anonymous FTP on

|rtfm.mit.edu [18.20.0.224]: /pub/usenet/news.answers/amiga/science-faq

 The rtfm site also provides an automated FAQ mailserver, send email to
 mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "help" in the body of your message.

 This document is a summary of info I have on hand about Science/School/UNIX
 software.  It is designed to answer the questions I have seen most
 frequently about such software on USENET.  It's a combination of things I
 have found out myself (I use most of these programs), information posted on
 USENET newsgroups (sometimes uncredited, sorry), and responses I got to
 questions I send to commercial product representatives.  I have tried to
 make the information herein as detailed and accurate as possible; please
 email me with any corrections, additional information	or comments.

 Appendix A.   UNIX versions of archiving programs (lha, zoo, unzip).
 Appendix B.   Amiga archiving programs.
 Appendix C.   FTPmail
 Appendix D.   Fish Disk databases
 Appendix E.   Sources of programs

 NOTE: some of these files/archives are very large.  Often they contain
 source or other files you may not need.  If you are sending the files to
 yourself over the phone lines, or other slow medium for which you may have
 to pay, use the appropriate archiver on your UNIX system beforehand to
 delete all unneeded files in the archive.  The most common archiving format
 is .lzh and .lha, use the lha program for these.
 See Appendix A for UNIX versions of archiving programs (lha, zoo, unzip, ...)
 See Appendix B about Amiga archiving programs.

 There is a nice review of science software in the March 1992 (#48) _.info_,
 a magazine whose demise is much lamented.

 There is a nice review of programming languages in August 1993 issue of
 Amiga World, "A Command of Languages" by Dave Haynie.

 This FAQ will use the notation sitename: instead of the full hostname.

 3a.2.	Automatic filename/directory completion
	Various UNIX shells will complete a filename for you, so you just have
	to type the first letter or two and then hit a key and it will cycle
	through the possible filenames or directories.	There are a number of
	Amiga shells that will do this, but the easiest way I have found is to
	use the GMC-Handler, a CON: replacement.  Version 9.18
	Available - aminet: util/shell/GMC_9.18.lha

 3a.3	Shell scrollbar
	UNIX Xwindows shells like xterm offer the ability to scroll back up

	Available - aminet: util/shell/cb1.1.lha

 3a.4	UNIX-like pipe (|)
	UNIX shells offer a way to "pipe" information from the standard output

		pipe grep -i foo Barfile | more

	shell output).

 8.	TeX ===================================================================
 8a.	AmigaTeX is a commercial program available from Radical Eye.  Comes

	install a minimum or full system.

	It has a special font loading system so you don't need all of them on
	your hard disk; it will request the font disks as needed.

 8b.	PasTeX 1.3
	There is also a Freely Distributable TeX called PasTeX.
|	Available - wustl:/systems/amiga/boing/utilities/text/utils/pastex-1.3/
	Disk #1 has DVIprint (3c), ShowDVI and SpecialHost in its bin directory
	The files are full disks compressed with Zoom, from Fish 682

	MetaFont and the Previewer fonts are separate from this distribution.

 8c.	DVIprint
	If you have AmigaTeX but no printer drivers, you can try using DVIprint
	from the PasTeX distribution.	It works remarkably well, just make a
	tex:config dir and put DVIprint.printers in it.
	Available - athene: /pcsoft/amiga/tex/pastex/dviprint.lha

 8e.	Pictures and Graphics in Tex
 8e.1	fig - Also for TeX you may want the "fig" package, for structured
	drawing.
|	Available - wustl: /systems/amiga/boing/utilities/text/utils/fig.zom
 8e.2	For pictures will simple straight and angled lines, I recommend the
	EEPIC macros (LaTeX: epic.sty, eepic.sty).  In order to print documents
	with EEPIC macros and DVIprint (3c) you will need SpecialHost running;
	in order to preview with ShowDVI you will also need to run SpecialHost 
	in the background.
 8e.3	For more complicated pictures, especially with curves, the PiCTeX
	macros (LaTeX: piclatex.sty; TeX: prepictex.tex, pictex.tex,
	postpictex.tex) are better but very slow on a 68000.  SpecialHost is
	not required for these.

 9a.	MAPLE V
	MAPLE V, a commercial "Mathematica"-like program is available for the
	Amiga.	There is a review of Maple V in the _.info_ article mentioned
	near the beginning of the FAQ, pp. 35-36.  There is a more recent
	review of Maple V in the January 1993 (Vol. 8, #1)
	_Amazing Computing_, pp. 69-71.
	I received a very detailed response to my questions from Maplesoft 
	(specifically, from Joyce Brennan, Communications Manager).  Here it
	is, with several screens of additional promotional information removed
	at the end, and some of the other descriptive portions summarized.

	   * will produce LaTeX formatted output
	   * will produce FORTRAN and C code]

 9b.	Schoonschip
	A pioneering algebraic manipulation program which has been used in
	particle physics and continuously developed since late 1963. Not as
	friendly as Mathematica or Maple, with no graphics or intuition
	interface and not as much built in, but still a general purpose
	algebraic manipulation language. Written in machine language to run
	fast and be memory efficient. Capable of handling large problems.
	Includes large and small workspace versions, tutorial examples, sample 
	programs, and a comprehensive manual. Version 5-Oct-91,
	binary only. Author: Martinus J. G. Veltman and David N. Williams
