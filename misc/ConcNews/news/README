This is a selection of News I've dumped in the period between
January 1993 and November, 1994.  The selection is very subjective;
I only saved things that interested me or were new for me.

Also, I can't guarantee the correctness in any of this.  Much of the postings
are of the kind where one guy asks a question, another answers and everybody
else shouts: WRONG! Do like this instead...

amiga.applications
	Information on useage and 'hidden features' of
	well-known Amiga applications.  Practically empty.
amiga.arexx
	Programming in Rexx on the Amiga, hints and help.

I hope I've not offended anyone by releasing their articles in this
somewhat more stable form.  I'm following the general rule that
things released as Usenet news is redistributable unless otherwise
noticed.  I've encountered one case where text actually wasn't
'freeware', and I deleted it (a programming tutorial by Udo "Kingfisher").
