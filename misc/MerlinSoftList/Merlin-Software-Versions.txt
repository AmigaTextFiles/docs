                       Merlin Graphics Board Software
                       ==============================

                 $VER: 1.8 (16.09.96) (© by Ulrich Flegel)

                            All rights reserved

Motivation:
-----------

This  document  hopefully  lists  all  versions  of  currently available and
functional  software  written  to  perform on Merlin graphics boards with or
without X-Calibur digitizer.

If  there  are  known  programs  written for the Merlin board but not listed
here, please contact the list maintainer so he can actualize the list.


General information:
--------------------

The  display  capabilities  of  the  Merlin  graphics  board  with  possibly
piggibacked  X-Calibur  realtime digitizer are handled using a collection of
dynamic  shared  libraries.   The  integration  of the graphics functions of
these  libraries  into  the Amiga system is implemented via a system monitor
driver.

ProBench  comprises  all  of  these  components, libraries and monitor.  The
library  need  for digitizer support is supplied with ProDig.  The currently
available versions of both packages are:

-ProBench 3
-ProDig   2

Both  are  commercial  products  of ProDev.  For further information contact
ProDev.

Currently  available  are  the  first  eight  free  updates of ProBench 3 at
ProDev's BBS.  The latest update is found on Aminet, too.


Software availability:
----------------------

Programs  in  this list are found at the source indicated.

If  the  source  is  "X-Pert", you should already have the programs, because
they came with the Merlin board.

If the source is "ProDev" there are several possibilities:

-The  program  is part of a commercial distribution.  You'd have to purchase
the  appropriate  software  package  to  obtain the program.  Please contact
ProDev for further information.

-The  program  is  included in one of the free update packages on Aminet.

-The  program  is  not  commercial  and  may be downloaded for free from the
ProDev BBS.

When  the  program  is  found  on "AmiNet", just use the find feature of the
AminetDownloadTool to locate the desired file.

Remarks:
--------

Several  of  the  drivers  and  programs  mentioned  come  in  a new version
distributed  with  ProBench 3 and ProDig 2.  You should not be confused that
some  of  the  version  numbers  have  not been bumped up.  Nevertheless you
should  install  all  the  new  drivers over the old ones, because otherwise
misfunctions  may  occur.   New  Drivers  without  bumped version number are
marked with a "#".

As a matter of fact, though not exactly what one might expect, several older
programs  relying  on  HRG functions are broken under ProBench 3.  Those are
therefore marked with a "*".

Since  the  introduction  of  ProBench  3  and  ProDig  2  some of the older
utilities  supplied  with ProBench 2 and ProDig 1 are obsolete and should be
removed from the installation.  You identify them by a "%" remark.
