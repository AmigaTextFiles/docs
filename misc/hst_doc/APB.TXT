          APPENDIX B-1
          THE RS-232C INTERFACE, WITH PIN DEFINITIONS
          

          DESCRIPTION

          The RS-232C interface (often referred to without the C) is a
          standard developed by the Electronic Industries Association
          (EIA).  It defines the signals and voltages used when data is
          exchanged between a computer or terminal and a modem or serial
          printer.  Data is transmitted between the devices via a cable
          with 25-pin, 9-pin or custom-built connectors.

          PIN ASSIGNMENTS

          The entire standard covers many more functions than are used in
          most data communications applications.  Pin assignments are
          factory set in the Courier 2400e to match the standard DB-25
          assignments in the following table.  DB-9 connectors at the
          computer/terminal end of the cable should be wired to reflect the
          pin assingments in the DB-9 column.

          MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

          Some computer/terminal equipment supports only a few of the RS-
          232C signal functions set in the Courier.  The minimum required
          for the modem to operate are as follows:

                                                                        B-2

          * Required only if you have set the Data Terminal Ready (DTR)
          Override switch (DIP switch 1) OFF (UP).

          If your computer and software support Clear to Send and you wish
          to use Transmit Data hardware flow control (&H1), Pin 5 (DB-25)
          or Pin 8 (DB-9) is required.  If your computer and software
          support Request to Send and you wish to use Received Data
          hardware flow control (&R2), Pin 4 (DB-25) or Pin 7 (DB-9) is
          required.

          APPENDIX B-3
          DIP SWITCH SUMMARY

          PURPOSE

          The Courier's DIP switches, located at the rear of the modem, are
          for adapting the modem to your equipment and personal
          requirements.  You may also want to experiment and review your
          computer or terminal documentation as necessary.

          Some users are able to move a single switch with a finger tip.
          If this doesn't work for you, use a toothpick or other small
          instrument.

          OPERATIONS

          The DIP switch settings are power-on defaults, read by the
          Courier when it is turned on.  If changed when the modem is on,
          switches 2-5 and 9 require the ATZ (software reset) command to
          initiate the new settings.  The remaining (hardware) switches are
          automatically operative when set UP or DOWN.
          

                 DIP SWITCHES:  UP = OFF (OPEN), DOWN = ON (CLOSED)

          DEFAULT SETTINGS

          USER-PROGRAMMABLE DEFAULTS

          You can create your own default configuration and store it in
          nonvolatile random access memory (NRAM) using the &W command
          described in Chapter 5.  Your defaults are then loaded into
          random access memory (RAM) as long as DIP switch 10 is UP when
          you power on the modem.  To view your NRAM settings at any time,
          use the ATI5 command.

          The following table lists the options stored in NRAM.  If DIP
          switch 10 is DOWN at power on, the factory settings listed in the
          table are loaded instead.  The first time the modem is turned on,
          the NRAM settings are the same as the factory settings.

          APPENDIX B-5
          S-REGISTER SUMMARY

          USAGE

          The default values are those users typically require.  Change the
          settings with the ATSr=n command, where r is the register and n
          is a decimal value from 0-255:

                    ATS13=8 <Enter>

          The modem does not perform a value-range check.  Some values may
          not work with some equipment, and you'll have to readjust the
          settings.

          To display the contents of a register, use ATSr? as in this
          example:

                    ATS20? <Enter>

          
          Register  Default   Function

            S0 See DIPSets the number of rings on which to answer
                                                 Switch 5   when in Auto
          Answer Mode.  Default = 1, equivalent of DIP switch 5 UP.  S0=0
          or DIP switch 5 DOWN (factory setting) suppresses Auto Answer.
          
            S1                                          0   Counts and
          stores the number of rings from an incoming call.
          
            S2        43      Stores the ASCII decimal code for the escape
          code character.  Default character is "+".  A value of 128-255
          disables the escape code.
          
            S3        13      Stores the ASCII decimal code for the
          Carriage Return character.
          
            S4        10      Stores the ASCII decimal code for the Line
          Feed character.
          
            S5         8      Stores the ASCII decimal code for the
          Backspace character.  A value of 128-255 disables the Backspace
          key's delete function.
          
            S6         2      Sets the number of seconds the modem waits
          before dialing.  If set to X2, X4, X6, or X7, the modem ignores
          this register and dials as soon as it detects a dial tone (fast
          dials).
          


                                                                        B-11

            S7        30Sets the number of seconds the modem waits  for a
          carrier.  May be set for much longer  duration if, for example,
          the modem is  originating an international connection.
          
            S8         2      Sets the duration, in seconds, for the pause
          (,) option in the Dial command and the pause between command re-
          executions (> and A> commands).
          
            S9         6      Sets the required duration, in tenths of a
          second, of the remote modem's carrier signal before recognition
          by the Courier (Carrier Detect Time).
          
            S10        7      Sets the duration, in tenths of a second,
          that the modem waits after loss of carrier  before hanging up.
          
            S11       70Sets the duration and spacing, in milliseconds, of
          dialed Touch-Tones.
          
            S12       50Sets the duration, in fiftieths of a second, of the
          guard time for the escape code sequence.

          register.  Select the bit(s) you want on, and set S13 to the
          total of the values in the Value column.  For example, ATS13=20
          enables bits 2 (value = 4) and 4 (value = 16).
