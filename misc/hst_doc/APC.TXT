                                                                 APPENDIX C
                                               ALPHABETICAL COMMAND SUMMARY


          Additional command summaries are on the bottom panel of the modem
          and in the Quick-Reference Card.

          Requirements

          1.   Type commands in either upper or lower case.

          2.   All commands except A/, A> and +++ are preceded by the AT
               prefix and are executed with the Enter/Carriage Return key
               (<Enter>).

          3.   Command length = 40 characters maximum.  The modem doesn't
               count the AT prefix, Carriage Return character, or spaces.
               It counts but doesn't act on punctuation such as hyphens and
               parentheses.

          4.   A missing numeric parameter is assumed to be zero, as in the
               command to hang up:  ATH <Enter> is the equivalent of ATH0
               <Enter>.

                                  BASIC COMMAND SET


          Command/Options     Function

          &    See the Extended Command Summary that follows this Basic
               Set.

          A    Force Answer Mode when the modem hasn't received an incoming
               call.

          A/   Re-execute the last issued command one time.  A/ doesn't
               take the AT prefix or a Carriage Return.

          A>   Re-execute the last issued command continuously until
               canceled by pressing <any key>.  Dial strings are re-
               executed ten times after which execution terminates.  A>
               doesn't take the AT prefix or a Carriage Return.

          <Any key> Terminate current dialing operation resulting from an
               issued Dial command; terminate Repeat mode (> or A>).

          AT   Attention:  lets the modem know commands are being issued to
               it.  Must precede all other commands except A/, A> and +++.
