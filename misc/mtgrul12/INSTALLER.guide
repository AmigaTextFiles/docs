                        Installation is rather simple.

             Just unpack the file @{b}MTGRULES.LHA@{ub} into one directory.
           Keep all files in one directory, otherwise it won't work.

        To read the contents, simply doubleclick on the provided icon.
     You might have to change the path to either Multiview or Amigaguide.
                             Do whatever you like.

        @{b}UPDATE@{ub}: All existing files from version 2.6 or earlier versions
         will be replaced by the files in this archive. There are also
                             some new Guide files.

                                Happy reading.
