@NODE Intro "Introduction to Human Resource Management"
Introduction to HRM:
--------------------
* Organisations depend on people to operate
* Current problems, challenges and opportunities come from shifting
  character of Labour force over last 30 years:
  a. Younger workers
  b. Working women risen
  c. Average employee is better educated
  d. Minorities recieve equal opportunities
  e. Increase in woman who are married and working
  f. More white-collared people
* History: Emerged in late 1930's, during WWII
* Effectiveness of the HRM department is measured in terms of employee
  productivity, turnover, absenteeism and job satisfaction

@ENDNODE

@NODE HRP "Human Resource Planning"
Human Resource Planning:
------------------------
* Process which an organisation ensures it has the right number and
  kinds of people, at the right places, at the right time, capable
  of effectively and efficiently completing those tasks that will
  aid the organisation in achieving its overall objectives
* First step in assessing current status of organisations objectives:
  a. A human resource inventory describes skills available within
     the organisation
  b. Job Analysis provides information about jobs being currently
     done, the information is critical input for @{"job descriptions" LINK Definitions},
     @{"job specifications" LINK Definitions} and job evaluations
* Second step is to review the organisations overall objectives
  and revenue projections
* Third step changes revenue projections to a forecast of demand
  for Human Resources
* Fourth Step is an assessment and forecast of internal and external
  supply sources
* The last step is matching the forecasts of future demand and supply.
  This will highlight shortages and overstaffed positions.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Recruitment "Recruitment"
Recruitment:
------------
* Recruitment is the discovering of potential people for current or
  possible future jobs
* Certain influences constrain managers:
  - Companies image
  - Attractiveness of Job
  - Internal policies
  - Union Requirements
  - Government Requirements
* Popular sources for recruitment include:
  - Internal 'customers' search
  - Advertisements
  - Employee referrals
  - Employment agencies
  - Temporary employment agencies
  - Schools, colledges, and Universities
  - Professional organisations
  - Casual or un-asked for applicants
* Afirmative Action - Minority recruitment: (since 1975)
  They can not descriminate by law in their recruitment practices.
  Legislations are now in order which prevent people hiring people
  based on a prejudice of their own, or a pre-set rule of the company.
  People who have previously descriminated against include: ethinic
  groups, a persons marital status, sexual preference, sex, and more.
  These prejudices in the past have caused for these groups not to be
  employed generally only on these facts alone, even if they were
  superior to other contenders for a position. Acts such as the
  'Sexual Descrimination Act' prevent this sort of thing from occuring
  legally and especially the 'Equal Opportunities legislation'. Except
  in the case of GENUINE characteristics which are un-acceptable
  (eg.criminal record)
* Recruitment methods vary by economic conditions and the type of
  job

@ENDNODE

@NODE Selection "The Selection Process"
The Selection Process:
----------------------
* Proper selection can minimise the costs of replacement and training,
  reduce legal challenges and result in a more productive workforce
* The main purpose is to predict which person will be successful if
  hired. During this process, the possible candidates are informed
  of what the job entails and things about the company
* The typical process selection would include:
  - Initial screening interview
  - Completion of application form
  - Employment tests
  - Comprehensive interview
  - Background investigation
  - Physical Examination (Sometimes)
  - Final Employment Decision
* An unsuccessful result at any stage will result in immediate rejection
* Alternate to discrete method of selection is the comprehensive approach,
  where all applicants go through every step in the selection process
  and the final decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of the
  results of each stage
* To be an effective predictor,a @{"selection device" LINK Devices} should:
  a. be reliable
  b. be valid
  c. have a favourable ratio
  d. have a favourable base rate
  e. predict a relevant standard/test/measure/principle/gauge/rule

@ENDNODE

@NODE Devices "Selection Devices"
Selection Devices:
------------------
* Selection devices provide managers with information that will help
  them predict whether an applicant will proove to be a successful
  job performer
* Application form is effective for aquiring hard biographical data;
  the weighted application can provide relevant information for
  predicting job success
* Traditional tests assess intelligence, abilities, and personal
  traits can help predict these things but aren't often that relevant
* Interviews rate very low on being able to accurately tell if a
  person can complete their job and is generally invalid
* Reference checks are only valid once the hard facts have been
  checked, they offer very little in predictions
* Medical examinations are valid when the job requires certain physical
  characteristics are essential to do the job

@ENDNODE

@NODE Training "Employee Training"
Employee training:
------------------
* Employee training has become increasingly important as jobs have
  become more sophisticated and influenced by technological changes
* Training is a learning experience that seeks a relatively
  permanent change in an individual that will improve his/her ability
  to perform on the job
* FACT: Until July '94 it was COMPULSARY to train all your staff
  With the New Industrial Relations Reform Act this is no longer
  compulsary
* An effective training program should be on the lines of these
  principles:
  - Learning is enhanced when they are motivated
  - Effective learning requires feedback (constant)
  - Reinforcement will most likely make them repeat the task
  - Practise increases the learners performance
  - Learning begings rapidly then evens off
  - Learning must relate to the job
* An organisations training needs will be based on the following
  questions:
  - What are the companies goals?
  - How will they be achieved?
  - What behaviour is needed for people to do their job properly?
  - What deficincies, if any, do people have in skills, knowledge
    or attitudes required to perform the necessary behaviours?
* Formal Training methods are either @{"on-the-job" LINK Definitions} training or
  @{"off-the-job" LINK Definitions} training
* Critical Success Factors to any training activity is effective
  evaluations. Evaluation methods can be classified as:
  a. reactions of participants or managers
  b. test-retest method
  c. pre-post performance method
  d. experience-control method
* Social training programs may be needed to fill the unique requirements
  of minorities and the disadvantaged

@NODE MainPoints "Main Points on International Business"
International Business
----------------------

Reasons for a business to invest overseas:
* Cheaper¹ - raw materials
           - labour
           - marketing costs
           - transport costs
           - tax payable (from tax discounts)
* Government incentives (including tax discounts as mentioned)
* Greater market share (Australia has a limited market)
  (Increased sales -> greater profit)
* If needs direct constant communication with overseas suppliers,etc
* To establish greater Economies of Scale (greater buying power =
  cheaper costs per unit)
* Need to be setup overseas to penetrate market (or due to legalities)
* Legalities (eg. protection policies) and tariff's imposed

Reasons why the Australian Government promotes Australian Businesses
in Eastern Europe:
* Increase exports -> increased balance of payments
* Larger poluations -> increased world market share
* Increase production of consumer goods
* Attractive product -> International demand
* Sets grounds for companies to diversify over there once set-up
* Good for the economy and jobs

Overseas expansion forms:
* Domestic business *export*
* Merger (agreed takeover of setup company)
         (not full control)
* Takeover (forcefull takeover/buyout of setup company)
           (full control)
* Offshore product units (Wholly owned)
  Either - Vertical Intergration
           (eg. For wholesaler buying their/a supplier or retailer)
  Or     - Horizontal Intergration
           (eg. For wholesaler buying another wholesaler in same
                business)

Problems associated with setting up overseas markets:
* Language/Cultural barriers/differences eg. Ettiquette, customs
  (eg. Commodore International in Japan)
* Fluctuating exchange rates
* Laws and regulations of country eg. Tariffs, crimes
* More difficult to manage (distance), most likely means delegating
  power O/S, harder to control/manage
* Political/Economic insatability of some foreign countries,
  place a greater risk in setting up O/S
* Bad feelings towards a 'foreign' company
* Methods of payment

Increased importance of International Business:
-----------------------------------------------
- From mid 1980's increase in exports and imports, therefore a
  decrease in tariffs', deregulation, microeconomy reforms
- Encouraged by governments, therefore a reduction in unemployment,
  but an increase in St. of h.

Normally Australia has a _defecit_ on it's Current Account
(IE. CAD), caused by: - (i) decreased terms of trade
                            therefore decreased P of rural
                            therefore increased price of
                            imports as decreased price of Exports
                       (ii) decreased international competitiveness
                            therefore increased cash, low productivity,
                            decreased australian dollar
                      (iii) Increased imports therefore fast growth

@NODE Amigaware "What is Amigaware"

         @{b}What is Amigaware?@{ub}
         ------------------

         Amigaware is a new concept, as it has been invented by
         me. What Amigaware is, if you use this program alot,
         or any Amigaware program, you will either go out and
         buy an Amiga product, or instead sell off other non-Amiga
         computer equipment you own (and with the money maybe buy
         an Amiga product). This concept is very similar to
         freeware, as all benefits of this program do not go
         to me, but to you and other Amiga users. It also could
         be described as self-giftware. :-)

         How did this idea come about?
         -----------------------------
         It came about when I was sick of people selling up
         their Amiga's to port over to other lesser machines.
         So I decided hey, do something to support the Amiga,
         which will benefit ALL Amigans. As mentioned above
         Amigaware does NOT benefit me!, it benefits everyone.

         Well, How does anyone know Im a supporter?
         ------------------------------------------
         If you can send me in a receipt with proof of sale of
         a non-Amiga computer product, or Amiga product bought
         as a result of reading this then if you send me a
         disk with your address enclosed I will give you a free
         copy of the code of this program. I normally would
         charge for the code. Also when you send me your proof
         of purchase I will in my next Amigaware program
         include your name in a list of Amigaware supporters.
