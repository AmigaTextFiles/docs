   How big is the file 'Studdy.lha'.

It looks like the entire archive has been scrubbed, probably by a) an evil
program or b) a disk error.


  Anyway, If you like you can send it over here and I'll have a butchers at
it ;)

See ya.

VMS in AmigaOS? Where?

Well, call me thick but I don't see the difference between the documents
flapping between folders and a progress bar. They are both intended to give
visual feedback to what's going on. How it looks is of minor concern as long
as it can give a good estimate of how long it's going to take.

        Sounds good.  Hopefully, they have already thought of this or have been
told this.  Considering their clone experience I would think they had already
thought of this.

        Yes, but...   They shouldn't have to learn to change the clutch, repair
the tranny, adjust the ignition timing, replace the mains, replace the cam,
adjust/repair the injectors, etc.  unless they *want* to.  None of which is
required to drive a car, transport ppl or stuff, get to a destination, etc. 
However, if they want to hot rod the car, improve gas mileage or performance,
handling, traction, etc.  then the option should be available to tweek thangs as
desired.

> Does it have room to take in both markets?

 SW> Yes!  See (my) above paragraph.

        I hope so.  The Amiga did, so if they stay with the spirit of the Amiga
then the NG should also.  While the correct terms might be best to use for both
expert and novice (neo/tyro), I don't think they should be forced to learn
(shades of Unix) or they're liable to be chased away.  Not everyone wants to be
a geek.  I see no reason to force ppl to "get their hands dirty" just to run the
aps that they need.  Just because they don't want to learn the details of the
computer or OS (OE) doesn't make them stupid.  Their interest/expertise may lie
elsewhere.  As far as computers are concerned, they shouldn't have to be experts
to do real work.  Like a car, they should be able to operate the computer well
enuff to run it.  Would you like to be required to take a mechanics course b4
you were allowed to drive?  Should you have a race driver certificate or
mechanics training certificate b4 you are allowed to drive?  Don't you think
your "novice" level of training (high school drivers ed training or equivalent) is
sufficient for you to drive?

        Driving a car isn't rocket science or brain surgery.  Most should be
able to operate a computer without knowing the nitty gritty of the computer or
OS (OE).  It sounds like you're advocating a computer science coarse for all
that use a computer.  They shouldn't have to learn more than the basics.  Just
like you rely on the mechanic to fix or maintain your car, they can use an IT
expert, ISP professional, or programmer/sys operator to help them with the
details.  They shouldn't have to know the details of TCP/IP, PPP, ftp, http, bus
speeds, memory types, cpu differences, SCSI/EIDE protocols, etc., anymore than
you should be required to know about compression ratios, injector pressures,
ignition lead timing, fuel/air mixture, or the diff between roller, hydraulic,
or solid cams.

        Altho, they should have the option if they have the interest or desire.

 SW> Does anyone else think someone should let Jim Collas or Allen Havemose
 SW> know about this stuff?

        As said above,  I would hope they had already thought of this, or been
told.  Might be a good idea to tell them tho, just in case.  Perhaps, for our
own psychological re-assurance, if nothing else.

        So who gets elected?  Or perhaps we *all* should tell them?  Or is a
rep reading this ML?

Just because you don't want it to be that simple, doesn't mean it wont. When
the original miggy was released, the first time user was one of the major

Logical devices are apparently a VMS-ism.  The way the shell runs
processes is as well.  Unix shells run commands as separate processes.
VMS shells apparently load the code and run it in their own process.
The Amiga shell does this too (using dos.library's RunCommand() if
anybody's interested).  The disadvantage of doing things this way
is that if the loaded program crashes, so does the parent shell.

BTW - I've never used VMS; this stuff is based on things that others
have told me.  (Although I know for a fact how the Amiga shell loads
things).

Ooh, thanks; will make a mental note of that.  I hate when I spell
people's names incorrectly.  It happens a lot to me as well; people
often spell my name "Steven".

Dont I remember reading that you must put a "/" or a ":" at the end of the
extract path? 
So, to extract the file "studdy.lha" thats in "Ricks:Junkdraw/Delete_me/"
you need to say, 
lha x Ricks:Junkdraw/Delete_me/studdy.lha  Ram:T/ (or somewhere else ending
with a /).

I use DOPUS to extract archives, much easier.

I have been using Virtual Icons by Steve Matty for a while now. It creates a
snapshot of CD icons on your HD, so that whenever you put that same CD in
the drive its
icon is in the place that you saved it. I have made it do the same with the
Ram icon.

Hi ya,
            Is it possible to connect a hd from a PC to an Amiga & read from
it? The reason I ask is that I have just been given a PC tower that has a
motherboard, hd & cd-rom drive but it will not boot-up. The tower is complete
but I just get a blank screen the hd make a noise then switches off. I would
like to connect the PC's hd to my Amiga & see if there any files on there. Is
it possible?
 
See ya

Depends. If it's formatted with plain old FAT-filesystem, it's no problem.
Download Mountdos from Aminet (I think that's the name) and attach the drive. Follow the
instructions in the archive and you should have access to it. If my memory
failed me and the file is called something else, sorry. On the other hand,
just found it:

disk/misc/MountDos100.lha

If the drive uses any other filesystem (FAT12, FAT32, HPFS, NTFS) then I don't
really think it's doable.

HD only or the entire system? If the first, the HD is probably dead. If the latter,
check the power supply.

It's simply incredible what Neil Ives wrote on 01-Jun-99:

I've never tryed using an extract path before, oddly enough. 
Somehow I got the idea that it couldn't be done so I always
just put the file in a directory of its own.
 (Grammer Check: should "its" be "it's"??)
So, thanks for that tip.

Yes, I use dopus too. But in this case it's important to use
shell because the archive is damaged and I'm using a special
option to try to salvage it.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

I believe it's like this:
  it's = it is / it has
  its  - when something "own" something (eg.: Here's a dog. Its paw smells
terrible! :-)

So according to me you're right in both cases (its own & it's important).
(I've got my English exams next week, so please tell me if I'm wrong... :)
BTW: to try is tried in past tense...(I wonder Y... :)

Hi Jonas,

> Depends. 

No, it is 100% possible using CrossDOS 7, £40 from Wierd Science.  It's a
bit expensive but it means that you can use PC Hard disks and floppies as
if they were the Amiga's own, there's full support for the latest PC
filesystems, removable disks, long filenmae support etc etc.

If you transfer lots of information from PC to Amiga or viceversa it's worth
it's weight in gold (especially whe using sometinh as easy to
connect/disconnect as a Jaz Drive :) )

> If the drive uses any other filesystem (FAT12, FAT32, HPFS, NTFS) then I

It is, I have no problems attaching any PC drive to the Amiga. with the lon
filenames support it's just like any other Amiga drive mounted on the
system.  Yay! :-)

You can even format/prep PC drives with CD7!

And not having to rename files allt he time as you transfer them (especially
if transferring small files via floppy) is bliss! :)

You can get CD7 cheaper direct form the authors.  Search for "CrossDOS 7" on
altavista to get their website.

Hope that helps.

All the best...

Probably the official site :)

AFAIK GoldED 6 is coming out soon - it'd not the cheapest but it is the best
text editor on the planet, you may consider it an invaluable purchase!

I'm not sure if I remember the full URL off hand (something like
http://members.tripod.com/~GoldED/ ) but you shoiuld be able to find it
easilt enough by searching for "GoldED" on Altavista or by reading the
readme .txt file for GoldED on Aminet.

Hope that helps.

All the best...

It's is not, it isn't ain't, and it's it's, not its, if you
mean it is.  If you don't, it's its.  Then too, it's hers.
It isn't her's.  It isn't our's either.  It's ours, and
likewise yours and theirs.

Hi all

I've just installed my A1200 into a Power Tower. Has anyone had a problem
where the system hangs as soon as you select a CGfx screenmode. The system
is nice and stable in AGA with the PPC running so I don't think there is a
heat/power problem. I've flashed the ROM on the 603e.

Thanks

Without doubt the only editor to use I would say, some say over kill

X-UIDL: 3d5189e4b29e41f45e653fe16a1e8973

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hello,

Sticking to the topic of liking to do things via the shell, i'm also like
Stephen who likes to do alot through shell.

Anyway i'm looking for a shell based FTP program so you can
connect, send and receive, nothing major. Just as long as its
controlled via shell, has send and receive, a bit like the Linux
FTP program that comes with the package. Any ideas?

If anyone knows where I can get one please let me know or if you
have one send it to,

chris@aio.co.uk

TIA!

Toodle Pip!

I saw a couple programs on Aminet a few days ago which work with
sending/receiving files and hide the actual FTP commands being sent. If
you prefer a more direct approach, try NCFTP (comes with AmiTCP). It
works great and you can just about everything there is to do with FTP
via the shell.

I saw that in the docs but it looked like I would be asking Dietmar directly
and I didn't want to bother him with beginner questions if there was an
alternative.

Yeah - version 6 was released a few days after I got the one before it.  It
is available from the web site.

Yes it did and I appreciate it.

amiga? I have a parallel connecting one (which can also plug into the
serial port) and I wanna use it!

Have you looked at MiamiDeluxe? It has a nice shell based ftp,
along with MANY other useful features. See:

There's also ncftp, which was supplied with AmiTCP and is still supplied
with Genesis too.  It doesn't require a registered version of Genesis -
it'll work with Miami too.  ncftp is probably the most UNIX-alike ftp
client on the Amiga (it was originally made for UNIX), although it
doesn't have new support like ftp resume (which Miami does), AFAIK.

On 04-Jun-99, Matthew O'Neill is alleged to have said...

>Hi Martin
>On 04-Jun-99, you wrote

>> I believe it's like this:
>>  it's = it is / it has

It's = it is, not "it has". If you were to say. "It has 3 legs", you
could not say, "It's 3 legs" without changing the meaning.

>>  its  - when something "own" something (eg.: Here's a dog. Its paw smells
>> terrible! :-)

>you also use the ' when something belong to someone,

>was: the professor his hat
>now: the professor's hat

>so....

>was: that is not it his jog
>now: that's not it's job

This is one of those many exceptions in the English language. "It's"
is always a contraction for "it is". When you are using the possessive
it is ALWAYS "Its". This is similar to "who's" which is always a 
contraction for "who is". When you are using the pronoun, it is "whose".

I.e. "Who's the man whose hat I stole"

Hilda

It's simply incredible what Matthew O'Neill wrote on 05-Jun-99:

|>you also use the ' when something belong to someone,
|> the professor's hat
|> that's not it's job

|> its  - when something "own" something (eg.: Here's a dog. 
|> Its paw smells

You can't have it both ways. "It is", we've all got that one
covered.
 I'm very confident that if you're talking about a professors
hat collection that you say: professor's hats
 Or to talk about a group of men:  professors' hats collection

So when it comes to 'it', the ownership of said it must
also be shown. 

A program and it's directory.

 Even though this seems out of place. Which is why I ask.
This grammer obeys the rule as I understand it. But if this
is true then there would never be any case for writing 'its'.
And we've seen it done by those who should know.
 ie Oxford University Press say it's either "it's" for "it is"
or "its" eternally. So, the ownership issue. Before your test.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

From: "Gavin Williams" <gavin@micro-media.demon.co.uk>

Hi all

Hurrah! Thankyou to all who helped me with my BVision problem. Strike up
another victim of the dreaded power supply feed (or lack thereof). I've
unplugged the LED adapter form my Power Tower and plugged the 5 volt floppy
connector in instead and voila. Only problem now is to get a better air flow
in there as the fan I've got obviously isn't man enough as the system hangs
after a while. Wherein lies my problem...

Has anyone found a workaround for the adapter/floppy connector so that I can
directly feed the motherboard AND use the LED adapter. I like to see
flashing lights for my HD. Is it possible to plug the 5 volt feed onto the
adapter (scream!).

Incidentally I rang Power Computing who reckoned the power fix was utter
rubbish and has never worked. Ho hum.

Thanks.

Gavin

I tried Shapeshifter V3.0 with the same 512Kb ROM but FUSION was very
faster.
Perhaps I tried a wrong displaymode for the PicassoIV ?

Hallo folks,

Sorry, I'm sure, this topic has been discused many times before, but I can't
remember anymore !
I'm using FUSION V2.0 (is this version the latest free version ?) to get my
Amiga working with MAC-Software, so can you tell me which of the different
screenmodes available for PicassoIV/P96 is the best in speed? An RGB mode
or PC mode ?

Does it make a big difference if I run the Emulator in 8 bit/15bit /24bit ?

Where is the diference between a 512Kb Rom and an 1024Kb rom ?

By the way: "Don't you know Jack" runs perfectly on my configuration !!!! 

Best wishes,
Pearl

Okay first...  just to clarify, "it's" means "it is" or "it has"....  "its" means
"belonging to it".

Next...  Since "it" is not a noun adding the  's  (and meaning belonging to it) is
wrong.
"It" is a pronoun like he, she, they, etc.

When you say "she's" what do you mean?  Or when you say "he's", do you mean
belonging to him???  You'd better not...

The above sentence "A program and it's directory"  clearly states
"A program and it is directory"  which of course makes absolutely no sense.

btw.  you'd say "the professors' hat collections" or "the hat collections of the
professors"
not "the professors' hats collection".

Hey, everyone this is my first letter to the onelist so don't laugh.  I can't
get
my files uploaded on aminet, I know all about the file requirements (specific
'txt' file layout, lha compression etc.) and all that.

I even get an automatic reply when I send my file the only thing is it doesn't
get put on aminet even after a month of waiting.  Does anyone know whats going
on?  The address

I've never uploaded by email myself, but via FTP I found out that they're *very*
strict about cases; *.lha has to be *.lha and not *.LhA or such. Furthermore the
file XyZZiY.lha has to have the readme file XyZZiY.readme along it (case
sensitive! :).
Try FTP'ing to 128.252.135.4/pub/aminet/new - it should be in recent in a couple
of days

btw: *why* do you think we would laugh?? :-D ... don't worry be happy!

It's simply incredible what Stephen Lopes wrote on 09-Jun-99:

|>"It" is a pronoun like he, she, they, etc.

Ah ha. So things cannot belong to pronouns! That's totally sorted
that one out then.
 Mans' noses
 Mans nose
 Stephen's nose

Now we can stop this damn its/it's discussion.

   Apart from around 512k of memory, the 1/2 meg rom is VERY VERY slow on an
040 and you *shouldn't* use it.

See ya.

If I where you I would send it using ftp instead of using mail! Lets say
that you use the american aminet site (http://us.aminet-net) if you where to
upload to this site then use an ftp program and log on to
(ftp://us.aminet.net) go into pub/aminet/new/ and upload your .lha and
.readme files..... That should work just fine, it does for me so..

no that would be the "professor's hat collections"....

"professors' hat collections" with the apostrophe after the s means there are
many
professors and many collections of hats...  (granted that could mean that each

professor has 1 or more hat collections but that wasn't the issue, I was
trying to
say that the pluralization should be on the collections, not on the hats.)
The collection
needs to be pluralized because if not then it would imply that many professors
had
gotten together and formed one hat collection.

Question for you, how many hats does it take to form a collection???

btw.  to keep this discussion remotely amiga orineted, what was your favorite
amiga
game of all time...  If you like you can split them into categories...
Favorite side scroller,
rpg, shoot 'em up, simulation, etc.

Steve....

I don't know, but unless it contains a policewoman's hat it's not
a proper collection ;-)

Aaaah I see what you mean...  It's not the quantity of the hats but the
quality that matters...

   Yep, you should download the propper P96 display driver (I think I have a
copy if you want it.)

   Its slow because the 512k image doesn't work with the data cache, so it
has to be turned off resulting in a huuuuge speed loss.

   If you're after then 1meg image then I could send you mine ;)

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>


Hi folks, I hope you can help me with your experiences.
As you can see by my sig,  I have a reasonable setup,
I dont have any problem playing MP3's flat-out on her.

However, a lot of friends want to play MP3's on the miggy too,
but they usually have only a 1200 with ram board or
at best, a 68030 / 33-40  card + 8 mb ram (min).

Although the docs say it can be done,  The question is:

HAS ANYONE HERE _ACTUALLY_  PLAYED MP3 FILES
ON AN A1200 WITH NO ACCELLERATOR.

I mean  _played them_   not making some buzzing noise 
that sounds like Darth-Vader swallowed a vibrator.

At least at 20Khz playback quality... 

I have tried a bunch of players, but the simplest
(& most effective that I can tell of)  seems to be
'mpega'   with the  'mpega_gui'   interface...

Can anyone help with their experiences, please....

Yo. Some time ago I had A1200 with only memory expansion (8mb).As you wrote
MPEGA is best tool, and I agree, but you have to use version which doesn't
use FPU!! MP3 are little harder to play around on 68020/14Mhz, but you can
play MP2. I did it like this :
Booted with NOSTARTUP, wrote Setpatch, then installed some speedup patches
(APatch, IPatch - they can be found on Aminet) and then ran MPEGA WITHOUT
GUI!!!. You must give options for MPEGA for LARGE buffer in ms (let it
decode ~30s) and then play with quality (MEDIUM, WORSE) and Khz (22050,
11000). BTW as playing output *don't use AHI*. You can experiment with
setting on 68030 CPU (you shoud be able to play MP3 ;)

*I wish your friends a lot of pattience !!!*

Vytas

P.S. you CAN TRY to play MP3 on Fast ram only  A1200, but I don't guarantie
that you'll like that 'sound'

Hi Colin

Get your friends to try Amipeg, it works for me on my unexpanded A4000.
They will have to use the lowest quality setting but still.

Try SongPlayer by Stephane Tavenard (I have v1.3), I seem to remember
playing that on a
4mb 020 28 b4 I got my 040 40. I'm not sure where to get it, but I think
it's been on the AFCD a few times.

(Oh no... woz that an "it's" in that sentence?) 

> I mean  _played them_   not making some buzzing noise

No promises, but it sounded OK on the 020 28; a bog standard A1200 with no
mem may be pushing it a little, but it's worth a try.

        Regards

Now _that_ is funny :-)

This is cheating, but I decompress the whole thing into one massive
.AIFF and then play it with Play16.  If your buddies have some free
hard drive/Zip disk/whatever space, they might try doing the same.
For a five minute track, I have seven to eight minutes decoding time
first.

THanX, but that just a GUI for MPEGA. It doesn't give any speedup over MPEGA
itself.
And other thing > *#unexpanded A4000 is WAY MORE FASTER THAN FASTRAM ONLY

Thanx for reading

you can use MPEGA in silent mode and tell it to wrfite output file.

P.S. decoding time in IMHO in FULL quality takes more time than written
above.

Your best and only chance is mpega (not the library, thats slow!) and a cli
screen. in mono with x4 divisions in low quality

Stephane Tavenard's MPEGA.  I don't know whether it's the best or
fastest, but it's very reliable and I did giftware register it, so
I'm sticking with it :-)

[seven or eight minutes]

It probably does; I haven't listened to any of my MP3s for a while, so
can't remember.  I have an 030 at 50MHz, by the way.

Hi Everybody,

> ON AN A1200 WITH NO ACCELLERATOR.

   MP3, on an UNACCELLERATED A1200?  A-HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!

I mean 'comon, my A1200 with a 25mhz 040 can't even play them full quality;
I have to use 22050hz in mono or suffer terible sound skiping (Of course,
as I have a nice PPC in there as well AmigaAMP playes'em full quality no
prob).

   The only hope in hell you have of listening to MP3 on an unexpanded A1200
is to first convert then into an AIFF sample with mpega or something. It'd
use a lot of HD space and take a while though. 

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

A small local shop recently moved its last few Amiga items into storage
but I've bought the last few copies of each of the products they were
selling. I'm offering this at the same price I bought them for and no

I'm guessing you live in the USA because of your email address and
the internet company you use, i could be wrong but....

How can you tell people about the 'English' language when surely
you speak American-English :) It is a well known fact or should be
a well known fact that alot of American people like to call what they
speak American-English, funny that.

Real English      American English

Through            Thru
Colour              Color

This list goes on.... 

It is very strange to see that alot of European people apart from the
UK itself spell Colour as Color. When they get taught this common
language
we speak are you taught that it is spelt Color? and when you get
taught this is the lesson called English or American-English? maybe
someone could clear this up.

Toddle Pip!

Thanks everyone for your help but something that is very weird.

I asked for this on Saturday morning then I check the Aminet
saturday night and there lies :-

GetClient13 - "FTP Get client (FTP files from a shell prompt or script)" 
PutClient10 - "FTP put client (shell exe to send files to remote system)"

They can be both found in *comm/tcp* if anyone else is looking for
them.

Is that not strange or is that not strange?

Maybe if i post a message to the list asking for next weeks lottery
numbers a few hours later a text will be on the Aminet with next
weeks lottery numbers :) who knows (?!)

Regards

Hiya all!

OK, ok, some of you may remember a while back 
Alan Gryniewicz <alan@a51krew.demon.co.uk> posted a message about
FreeCall UK being a scam and giving the postal and phone/fax number.

Well my studies into this have found the following.

The fax line is not dedicated, they do not have a check then either
answer with fax or phone, you send a fax, some picks up and says
"Hello, FreeCall", click click, my modem is waiting to send the fax,
5 seconds later, their phone goes down, fax picks up and fax is
sent.

Seems a bit cheap to have a fax machine in that way, a proper
company working like that? I think not...

Also some email addresses for the people or person in question
running this. I think the only person running this is a guy called
Richard Jay, at present I don't know of anyone else working
there, so he is our one man band for now, email address for
him and freecall-uk :-

Emails :

r-jay@saqnet.co.uk (dialup137-17.saqnet.co.uk)
r-jay@freecall-uk.com
support@freecall-uk.co.uk

Web :

http://www.freecall-uk.com
http://www.freecall-uk.co.uk

The .com website is to do with hostingeurope.hostingeurope.com
but the most interesting thing is if Richard Jay is running an internet
company why has he a dialup account with SaqNet, ie his email came
to me from his dialup email address r-jay@saqnet.co.uk and at the
time of him sending it his IP was, dialup137-17.saqnet.co.uk

Surely he'd want to take full advantage of his own free 0800 numbers
:)? or hasn't he found 4 friends to recommend him yet ;) *<G>*

Attached are the total of three emails I have received from them
in order of,

Thank_you,_Freecall-UK.msg
re_fax.msg
Re_Questions.msg

Its funny that you'll see, that re_fax.msg is the second one when
he delt personally with me and then when i questioned him with
some questions about it all he palmed me off with Re_Questions.msg
which comes from support@freecall-uk.co.uk

If anyone turns anything up else with this or their own venturing
let us know.

Toodle Pip!

Subject: [just-amiga] AIO : Today I am a little annoyed!
X-UIDL: b93b3638c48ee5a2e7dbe42905c60aaf

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hello everyone,

You may be wondering what the subject means? well today I went out to
buy my monthly issue of Amiga Format, July 1999 - Issue 125.

Aha! I notice a review of AIO issue 22. Well, after reading this less
than pleasing review I felt quite disgraced. AIO has been reviewed
3 times in AF and had a little slip of information in CU Amiga before
it sadly closed. CU Amiga took a small look at issue 1 in which I
think AIO was its worst issue, although CU Amiga liked it. The last
two reviews of AIO in Amiga Format done by *Dave Cusick* where, I
thought very nice and a good way to keep the spirit of the AIO team
alive making us know that our work is appreciated. Quotes taken
from those two reviews like,

"thoroughly absorbing reading...", "fascinating reading..."

and

"interesting and often informative articles"

Then we come to the new guy at Amiga Format, *Richard Drummond*
who SADLY has taken over Dave Cusick and in my opinion ruined
the PD section and a part of the magazine. Quotes like "I'm
sure they would save themselves a lot of effort by using HTML
instead" talking about the wonderful work Linus Akesson has done
for us. Why should we cut corners and use HTML just because
it exists? we have a unique GUI that I am very thankful to Linus
Akesson for making solely for us. 

Another one that made me laugh was "They've obviously tried
hard to mimic the layout of print magazines such as Amiga
Format as everything is nicely divided into subjects"

I really am so pleased that Amiga Format is around so I could
rip-off the idea of putting utilities with utilities and games
with games, etc. otherwise I'd have just thrown them in one
big list, lucky me! <sarcasim off>

"much has just been leached from other Amiga websites"

Well sorry for this, i didn't know we couldn't use other peoples
work, what did he want us to do change a cucug.org Jim Collas
and Jeff Schindler interview to our own writing or work? what
is the point of re-writing something that is already written, just
where did he pluck his ideas from?

I honestly could go on. Let me firstly explain that I am not
saying that AIO should have gotten a good review and I
know we have to take the highs with the lows but I think the way
*Richard Drummond* has worded his whole review was terrible
and it is a sad day when a main stream magazine like AF
can put down user-run magazines. After all we aren't getting
paid for what we do and it is all in our spare time. I
think Richard Drummond needs to re-think his ideas
because without many great user-run magazines like ACI,
World of Amiga, The Ripper, Amiga Survivor, Amiga Energy
plus many hundreds more the Amiga would not be the same
today. Not everyone can afford the expensive price of
£5.99 every month and alot of people do not think it is
worth the money, so please Richard give us some credit.

I'd like to appolgise to all Amiga Format staff as this
is not intended towards them but just Richard Drummond.

My final words are to Richard Drummond himself who I would
like to say, why don't you try doing this without it being your
actual job, I think you will re-think your strange ideas.

I would also like to thank all you readers and supporters
of AIO for making us what we are today, our spirit will live
on because of your great words to our team and about
our magazine. The spirit of the global Amiga community is
surely alive and I thank everyone of you for keeping
the Amiga alive.

Issue 25 of Amiga Information Online will be available 26th
June 1999. For this issue i'd like to see all you loyal
readers writing in with your ideas on this matter, show us
your support all and everyone of you and show that you want
us to stay alive. Your help is much appreciated.

Send mails to,

*letters@aio.co.uk*

The future of AIO depends on you!

Maybe Mr. Dumbond is trying to say how professional we are? Me, I'd just
think that organized layouts is a common-sense thing you learn before your
baby teeth fall out.  Must be news to him.

I apologize, Mr. Dummer, that as Articles Editor, I have tryedg to keep the
Amiga Community informed with any interview and open letter that comes my
way. I realize now that I broke the Cardinal Rule of keeping the Community
in the dark and will try better in the future to revael as little
information as possible.  Thank-you for showing me the light (that little
flickering 2-watt light bulb waaay over in the corner)

Now can we review Mr. Druling? (Pleeeease?!)

You have to understand, economics being what they are, they have to cut
corners where they can.  Hence the thoughtful Mr. Dripmond (and its also
nice of the AF staff to pick up strays like that, otherwise he'd just be
back on the street bumming pennies)

Maybe Mr. Dumblond wanted his money back :)

Ditto.

And I would like to thank Mr. Ricky Dumpster.  I haven't had a chance to go
into Scathing Commentary mode in quite a long time.

Hi Everybody,

   I know this isn't very Amiga related, but does anyone have a copy of
QBasic 4.5 for PC? It's just that my copy of Windows, um, you know what
Windows does, and I lost a few files, that included :(

   I'd be very greatful if anyone could email it to me, or point me to a
place I can download it from.

See ya.

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   I may be getting a 4.3 gig hard drive soon, and I'm just wondering:

I know FFS only works up to the 4.1 gig margin, but would it work if say I
made the last few hundred megs my shapeshifter partition?

   Would MacOS overwrite the RDB like FFS would or is it totally safe to use
those last few hundred megs for another format?


See ya.

We'd also save a lot of effort by not making the magazine.  The fact is, HTML

doubt.  But since we're not, we can use the freedom a custom written interface
gives us.

Hoho.. Perhaps we should put stuff in randomly.  Good god. I can't really think
of a good response to this - it's just not something you'd ever expect to hear.

Perhaps Amiga Format makes up press releases.  In the news section was my big

cry.

I have heard of British English speakers being corrected by
Europeans for not speaking American English :-)

The lessons which are taught in European schools are referred to
as "English", but the dialect taught is _usually_ (not always)
American English, according to a friend of mine who is something
of a linguist.

I tend to treat the term "English" as a general term encompassing
both British and American Englishes.  If I want to be precise, I
specify "British" or "American" English.

All: don't get bees in your bonnets about this topic.  I meet a
lot of British English speakers who get really upset about American
English being different, and I'm not really sure why.  I actually
use American spellings myself when I prefer them :-)  For example,
I spell words like "standardize" with the American "-ize" ending,
because I prefer it, and it's purer English anyhow (apparently it
was us who changed to "-ise").

Unless you use 64 bit filesystem,  you CANNOT exceed 4096 Mb for any disk.
With 2048Mb as the largest partition...

NOT 1 byte more !!!

If you partition the disk for say...  4Gig as AmigaDOS partitions & use 
the last 300Mb for shapeshifter,  that would work PROVIDED
shapeshifter uses 64 bit filesystem,  that I can't answer.... ???
I suppose you could try it & see if the drive turns to mush...

Just remember to have your boot partition within the first 4 gig of
 the drive  & that it is no larger than 2048Mb.

Even with OS3.5 I expect you will be required to have the above
setup,  simply because the 64 bit filesystems that 3.5 will employ
will have to load from disk before they take effect,  thereby requiring
a valid 32 bit filesystem  disk to boot from first.

Maybe OS 3.6 will come with ROMS, that way the 64 bit patches
will be in before you need to boot....    We'll just have to wait & see....

Very of-topic but I can't help myself...it's been a while since I went
to school but back then, if you used an american spelling or word
i.e. chose lift instead of elevator (or was it the other way around?)
in a written test, it was considered wrong!

You have to remember that a kb is 1024, so 4Mb is 4294967296 bytes, which is the
fs's max capacity, and that the HW-producer often says that their 4Mb harddrive
is a 4.3Mb one.

btw: I haven't had problems with my "4.3Mb" drive (yet! ;-)

Normally, here in Sweden, we learn English. Both the spelling, the choice of
words and the pronounciation. One day or another, there would be a lesson or
chapter that deals with the differences between English and American.

BUT! What if the teacher has spent several years in the US, and speaks fluent
American? Obviously it's better to learn perfect American than to learn some
kind of mixture between English spelling and American pronounciation
(especially since most young people tend to learn American anyway, due to the
massive amount of American movies, computer terminology etc.).

This is the case with my current "English teacher". She's teaching American,
but when we get a new word that doesn't exist, or isn't spelled in the same
way in English, she also tells us the English version.

Yeah, convert them to aiffs. That's what I do on my 030@28MHz. I also halve
the sampling frequency, to make the files smaller, but I usually end up with
a file that's 10 times bigger than the original mp3. Mp3s with a low bitrate
I can play if I don't multitask too heavily at the same time. =)

 AC>   I may be getting a 4.3 gig hard drive soon, and I'm just wondering:

It's likely to be 4.007 GB actually.  Hard disk manufacturers seem to forget
that 1GB is 1024MB when it comes to selling them.

 AC> I know FFS only works up to the 4.1 gig margin, but would it work if say
 AC> I made the last few hundred megs my shapeshifter partition?

I don't know if ShapeShifter/MacOS will work with a partition - it will with a
hard file but they're useless :)

I use FFS over the 4GB mark anyway; all you have to remember is NOT to use a
/full/ format - the format command is broken.  Always use "Format QUICK" or
you'll overwrite the beginning of the rigid disk block.

Also, don't make a partition over 2GB. It should be fine upto 4GB (sizes start
looping around past that) but 2GB is wiser as some programs use signed longs
(!) to measure size.

HDToolBox will also loop values around after 4GB, so when you start it up with
a "4.3GB" hard disk, HDToolBox will tell you it's a 7 /MB/ hard disk.  Shrink
the default partition and watch it jump to 4GB.  Ignore this, and all will be
fine.

Finally, install NSDPatch - it'll make life much easier by providing a 64bit
interface to scsi.device!

 AC>   Would MacOS overwrite the RDB like FFS would or is it totally safe to
 AC> use those last few hundred megs for another format?

I recommend you experiment with it before you install anything else.  Remember,
the thing *will* be blank when you get it ;)

I'm a bit of a trainee linguist.  English (old,middle,modern), French, German
(oldhigher,modern), Welsh.  I'm not exactly fluent in any but English though.

English varies around the UK, so do you say `English English' too? :)

South and north Welsh has a fair few differences [1] and we seem to handle it.

But all the various spellings of English makes it extremely difficult to
standardise on pronounciation - case in point, Kosovo - "kos-ov-o" as per 70%
of Europe, or "ko-so-vo" as per northern America, or even "kos-o-va" ?

 SW> I actually use American spellings myself when I prefer them :-)

Heathen!

 SW> For example, I spell

Should "says" change to "sayz" then?  Hmm?  What about "is?" :)
The letter "s" changes pronounciation depending on where it is, hence why it's
valid (pronounciation-wise) to use "standardise."  The same thing happens in
reverse in German (Sie = zee).


[1] mostly due to the big changes in accent - whywhyWHY in Coronation Street is
north Wales full of people with south Wales accents?  Eh?  Not that I watch
Coronation Street, you understand!

The thing that annoys me about American English when using a spell checker
with
Final Writer as it keeps coming up with numerous errors on my spelling.

Hi there, This is Alan's son, Dean aka Kludge

As long as you HDD partitioning software (IE HDToolbox or HDInstTools)
recognises the extra space on your hard-drive, you should be ok, but ONLY if
you are using the CrossMAC software, ie NOT using hardfiles ;) hope this
helps,

Personally, I agree with Richard on this one. I rarely read AIO,
because downloading it, de-archiving it, and running it is too
much hassle. Once it is running, it scrolls painfully slowly,
and some aspects of its layout annoys me - such as the index which
lists all the articles, but doesn't let you click to go directly
to them, which is just what I want an index for!

I find the on-line web sites much easier to access, and faster to
read. Judging by the number of registered readers, other people
do too. Is it really worth all your effort just for just 140 readers?
If you had more readers, you might find it easier to attract advertisers
or sponsors. From a potential advertisers point of view there aren't
enough readers to make it worthwhile. If a product might appeal to
say 5% of Amiga owners (a popular product!), then with 140 readers you
have potential sales of only 7 (assuming they haven't already bought it).

Sorry, I don't want to sound too negative, but I'd like to see your
effort being rewarded by a greater readership than AIO currently
enjoys.

  Tim

Hehehe. This also made me laugh.

You obviously know very little about the shareware situation
on the Amiga.

An author makes a great piece of software and leaves his mailbox
for 2 years, he comes to find 2 mails saying sometimes it doesn't
work or good work. It is a known fact that people just do not
spend the time to reward the authors, they get one or two replies,
ask alot of people who upload to the aminet.

150 registered readers is not our reader base, we are sold
in walk-in shops in 4 countries, known to be read in 31
countries and uploaded to many bbses around the world.

150 people have actually bothered to fill in the form and inform
us, this is NO indication of how many people read it, that is
what is so mis-guided about your point. This is why your letter
made me laugh.

I constantly get emails needed help or other various emails
from people who havn't registered.

Just because people don't register doesn't mean they don't
read it.

Regards

Forgot one point, we have an advetiser lined up called Access
Technology who points out that are readers are quality readers
and that is why he will be sponsoring us soon in the very near
future. This will bring competitions, the first being something
along the line of a few 56k modems, but i'll say no more for now,
its under cover, I ain't even told the other editors yet :) but
they will know all very soon.

One last thing, I think it is much harder for AIO because we actually
have to do some work to get people to read it, AF take for
granted that people buy it, i buy it without even looking in
it so thats my point, coupled with the fact that the readership
of AF drops about 5000 every time they publish the new figures,
AIO readership is on the way up all the time.

I am more disappointed by AF every month. 

Regards

Hi Vytautas,

Because you could very well NEED it with SFS :)

PFS2 is so stable that the mere idea of data-salvaging makes me laugh!  It's
not something I'll ever have to do again! :)

All the best...

Of course....I'm on the AF list as well and I have noticed that Richard does

IMHO anyone deserves credit who try to do anything for the current Amiga
users. Besides I _like_ AIO....so sod 'im!

No, I don't sell shareware, I sell commercial programs. I also give

OK. Maybe somebody will show interest in PFS2 that was reviewed
in AIO? So far interest from AIO readers has been zero. Which is
a little strange because I've had a good response from adverts
and reviews in other Amiga fanzines.

I guess if you're happy with your circulation, that's all that matters.

Subject: [just-amiga] Bit annoyed myself actually
X-UIDL: 31269422b8a558d42abe2f8d7027addf

From: Just Amiga <ja49@rapid.co.uk>

All

The reason I joined this list was to have some contact with other amigans,
people with some common interest and a desire to help and support each
other.
I joined so I could hear peoples opinions and share mine.

I'm becoming a little tired of the negativity towards some people who are
trying to do something positive for us, the amiga community.
Imho there is enough of that from elsewhere.

I read AIO and sometimes I think it's great and sometimes it could be
better. I _always_ think that Chris and co should be applauded for the 
effort they make.I think the gui could be improved but 
that is /my/ opinion,that's all.

I buy AF because it is the only amiga mag on the shelf nowadays and it
isn't that great anymore, I buy out of loyalty, naively doing my bit etc,
etc.
I say I buy it but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
If AF don't think AIO is up to scratch then fair enough, up to them.
I hope AF is still around in a year to review future editions of AIO, I
truly do.

I only know one other amiga user outside of this list so I take it a little
personally when someone who is trying hard to do something good gets
slagged off when we should be sticking together.

Ok spleen vented.

btw don't bother to reply if all you can say is that I spelt a word wrong
orI put a comma or apostraphe in the wrong place because 
I already know that my grammar isn't perfect that isn't why I'm here.

Keep it up Chris you do a great job

I read you are getting 4.3 gig HDD. It's good 4 you. I have same thing and I
have a suggestion for you: 

            _/*#DON'T INSTALL FFS*/_.

Install PFS-II or if you prefer Freeware SmartFilesystem. SFS is good and
don't be scared with BETA label. It works good for me. FFS will give you
PAIN with validating, slow dir reading and so on... SFS is one of the best
choices (if you have money you can get PFS-II)
you can get SFS from *http://www.xs4all.nl/~hjohn/SFS*

There are grammatical differences too.

eg. "Write to me"-english
     "Write me"-american (ugh!)

Surely it's only spoken english that varies? Someone may use the odd
dialectic word if writting to a friend or something, but I would think
written English across the UK is pretty Standard.

I could be wrong though :)

Heh. It sounds funny to me when I hear Billy Boy say Ko so vo.

The one ending in "va" is really "var" isn't it? i.e. "Kosovar" Which is
the term applied to someone from that region, in the same way Mancunian
is applied to someone from Manchester. . .probably.

American spelling makes me want to heave :)

Why Why Why is Corronation street full of people with Yorkshire accents!?
It's supposed to be in the Mmanchester area, but the only one I can think
of with a Manc accent is Kevin webster (not that I watch it much either
;))

I bought PFS-II and I /was /very happy with it. It is particularly good for
zip disks, their access speeds up a lot with PFS-II.  My karma was recenlty
shaken when one of my zip disks became unreadable. The repair tool provided
with PFS-II did not help and as *there is no other disk utility for this
system*, (that I know of) I had to reformat the disk and lose the contents.
The problem may well be the known fault with Iomega zip drives (Click Of
Death). Iomega have agreed to change my drive, even though it is out of
warrantee. 
I am hoping that my HD will continue to work, cos I will be seriously cross
if it crashes and I cant recover anything from it.

 If you use it safelly <<<how this word spells ??) it will work good.
My friend uses PFS-II *without any problems*. I prefer freeware ;) so I'm
using SFS ;)

P.S. may all AMIGA HDD's *NEVER* break ;)

^^^^^^ Nice one^^^^^^  My Amiga went bang 2 weeks ago so I decided to get a

Oh... I appear to be a little uninformed.

Is SFSSalv freeware, and is there a similar program for PFS? {Suddenly I
feel much more supportive of ditching FFS :-)   }

   I think it probably is a 4.3 gig hd. If its not then I won't have a
problem will I?

   Funny, I could have swarn that I have a 300meg mac partition on my 2.1
gig harddrive ;)

   Yeah, but surly once you'd filled it to 4.1 gig then it would write over
the RDB with a file wouldn't it?

   Will do.

   I thought that it went in to negative figures?

   I'll look out for that,

   I think when I copy all the stuff to the new HD I'll do the mac first ;)

I can't say I totally agree with this. I've owned PCs and Amigas since
the early 90s and I'm still amazed how bad Microsoft software is. Poorly
thought out with terrible coding. I would have thought Windows 98 would
be lightning fast doing practically all tasks considering the power of
my PC but it still chugs along at times. Its still amazing that on a
32MEG PC its needs to use a swap file/virtual memory so much. Personally
I think PCs would be great if Microsoft had nothing to do with them. I
still find that if my PC is going to crash its most likely to be using
the desktop rather than a third party application or game. PCs are such
huge computers that take over a corner of a room. Amigas are such tiny
things in comparison which I like. I'm not going to say Amigas are
better than PCs its not realistic as spec wise the PC wins. However in
use PCs lack a certain charm or logic which I find annoying.

I've had similar "issues" with PFS2 on Zip disks.  It tends to happen
on relatively new disks.  A (full) reformat fixed it, and I had no
further troubles.  It's a newish drive with no "click of death"
symptoms.

I only use PFS2 on my "day to day" Zip disks.  My "archival" Zips are
formatted with FFS, as I trust this filesystem 100%.  Archival disks
don't need to be fast.

I have had _no_ problems with PFS2 on my hard drive.

Which OS are you running on the PC?  If it's a Unix-type system I
might be forced to agree.  If it's Windows then I don't.  I'm not
speaking as a whinging Amiga fan, as I use Windows, AmigaOS and Unix
frequently, and Windows just doesn't cut it as the professional
quality OS it's marketed as.  AmigaOS may be old and unstable, but it
has a simplicity and elegance that Windows doesn't have.

Hardware-wise, you're right of course :-(  though I tend to judge
computers by the quality of their OSes, not by their whizz-bang
graphics and sound.

All this IMHO, flames to /dev/null.

I agree wholeheartedly.  At work, I use a Windows NT machine with 96Mb
of silicon and another 100Mb or so of swap.  It can't do anything
without touching the swap file.  Launch a new app?  We'll page
everything out just to make sure we've got room for the new program.
Context switch?  Hold on while I check the swap file for leaks.  Click
on _anything_ in Outlook 97?  Go and get a cup of tea while I swap
_that_ monster!

I know that AmigaNG will support virtual memory.  I hope it's done
orders of magnitude better than this.  AmigaOS feels like a realtime
OS compared with Windows NT :-)

I didn't heard about this kind of program for PFS-II.
And yes it's freeware.
One more thing : *YOU DON'T NEED THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS ON SFS or PFS-II*.
It's made just to be 10000000000% sure ;)

Don't ever say that...I had my PFSII equipped harddisk making me
extremely nervous yesterday. It had lost it's partition info
so it showed up as unknown in hdtoolbox. Lucky I had it in
just one partition so I could easily recreate the RDB and getting
access to all data again. I would not have particularily liked
loosing 5 gig of data.

Are you a masochist or something...Win98 and just 32 meg does not
mix. I find it more annoying that my Win98 machine has gobbled
up approx. half of my physical mem just by booting. And there's
128 megs in it.

From: Noel Gadd <ngadd@southcom.com.au>

G'day Readers ,
                          Don't supose there's too many out there that use
caller ID or have a modem that supports it ? 

    But I cant seem to get the right config for trapdoor to log the caller
ID info from my modem. Yeah I know its #CID=1. When I use it with my fax
detection on there seems to be some conflict and the Fax program wont pick
up.

    Is there anyone out there that has it right ? Maybe I could get the
vitals from your config ? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
Kind regards

I don't know about SFS, but PFS-2 has a directory on each partition
which contains the last 31 files you've deleted (unless the disk
fills up and it needs to reuse the space). That makes recovering
files you've just accidentally deleted rather easy :-)

Topic for today:

The PC- "Around the end of last century, these computers were the vogue for
many users around the world. Despite its many drawbacks, the
megacorporations who owned it managed to force it into nearly every home...

These days were before the Amiga Revolution, though, and can you imagine,
children, just what space travel, school, or even your homes would be like
without the Amiga OE? Stone age... Just imagine driving cars, or reading by
yourself. That is today's lesson. See you tomorrow when you'll learn about
another part of history... the computer crash."

Hello Martin

On 13-Jun-99, you wrote:

Hmm. Look at Office97; "The ultimate integrated package, " but even the
requestors vary throughout. In one app it's "OK", another "ok", and another
"Okay".

I mean, if you're going to use however many thousand programmers they use on
the same app, you'd have at least thought they'd try to co- ordinate their
ideas of a front end.

And why does things like "Internet options" on IE4 come under the view menu?
No logic, that's M$.

When my accelerator board crashed, I was quite pissed, because vanilla a1200
is not powerful enough to play mp3's directly.
However, playback is possible, if you decode first and play after that.
mpega has option for this (-w)
So, with 5kHz sampling rate, low quality and mono I could after all get about 28
seconds of music, but decoding took 3-5 mins...
If I wanted to stereo instead, the decoding time would have been the same, but
I could only get 14 seconds.

It really doesn't matter if you use Mpega_gui, Amplifier, AmigaAmp or
SongPlayer, bacause they all use mpega.library for playback.
Stephane Tavenard's mpega(.library) is *very* fast indeed, so there's
no reason to search any faster.
Someone said that the mpega.library would be slower than mpega executable.
Why would that be? I haven't noticed any big speed differences.
I have 040/33MHz, and maximum quality I can get with both exe and lib, is
22kHz/stereo/medium(*with or without AHI*).

Yeah - I agree with all that although I must admit I do my internetting
on a PC.

If you had a competition for the worst designed operating system then
Windoze would win hands down! - I just can't believe the complexity of
the registry system - surely each program having its (not it's) own
preferences file is far better than the registry!!

I seriously doubt its as bad as my 1200-S (S stands for server tower case by
the way ;))

Its amazing what you can do with a decommisioned server, velcro, soldering
iron and meccano heheh. Although I seem to have blown the power light in
the case? do I need to use a  resistor of some sort??

Hello again. Only me!

PC vs Amiga.

Surely the way to look at this is purely from a users point of view. After
all a personal computer is only a (wonderfully powerful) tool. If you
picked up a screwdriver that felt uncomfortable compared to another you
wouldnt use it, unless you didn't know any better. When computers moved
from a console interface to a graphical user interface they were moving in
an inevitable path toward complete user friendliness which may well have a
speech only interface at some stage (what about a neural implant?). The
problem for many newcomers is that computers are dauntingly complicated. A
friendly, obvious, straight forward user interface means more people are
comfortable using your computer. The very name of the Amigas GUI,
'Intuition' says it all. It is intuitive, it represents the actual filing
structure. It is instantly obvious what is installed on your computer. It
doesn't need to be learned. Surely this is not true of the Wintel OS. I
know you can learn how to use it, but you shouldn't
have to learn it! 
As the Amiga has now been around for, what 15 years (?), I guess we are
entitled to criticise this much plugged Wintel GUI that still isn't a patch
on Intuition.

It's more difficult to change the subject; so fairly easily.

The problem is that Windows treats the swapfile as somewhere to place program
that aren't in use. It's a hang over (not in code, but in the way PC people
think) from MS-DOS where programs have to be moved in and out of the bottom
640KB.

VMM on the Amiga makes the swapfile look like low priority memory - it'll only
be used when it's needed.  Which is How It Should Be.

Use:

And have TrapDoor launch the Fax program, don't have them sharing the device.

You're insane, or joking.

How long have you had it?  Give it 3 hours and you'll smash it up, like I've
done to countless numbers of the little buggers.

I have to agree. The worst thing about this is that the registry is
ALWAYS in memory so the bigger it gets the less physical memory is
avilable. The more software there is the slower it gets. M$ should
learn something from the Amiga here - seperate prefences files are far
more efficient.

There is a version of QBasic on the Windows CD. I forget the exact path
but it is in a directory called "oldmsdos".

Was it PFS2 that messed up, or the ZIP drive having a funny turn?

Not even PFS2 can protect against hardware failure - backups are
always advisable.

Amiga's method isn't the greatest either. All prefs files have different
formats and are difficult to edit without running the prefs program
or RTFM. The files are not very well sorted (hierarchially) in many
instances and really bog the filesystem down.

The registry tree would of course be more efficient, were its storage
and retrieval facilities more streamlined and less intensive.

I hate to say it, but M$ has the right idea with a centralized system
like that. Just got a sufficient amount of it wrong to make it a hassle...

But _always_ make backups....SFS is a BETA and does crash.
Also when it does,you can end up with the entire drive not booting!
Download SFS-Salve as well :)

Indeed. The registry makes life easier for us poor NT system

Guess.... Aminet :)

winguide.lha misc/emu  194K  68+Win95 prog to display AmigaGuide Files.

I don't know how good it is, but at least it's worth a try.

    This I agree with.


I own a 6.4Gb Hard disk and have had no problems so far.

I know about the 4.2/4.3 Gb Barrier that Amiga OS just does not agree with,
as I was unfortunate enough to find out the hard way.
If you have the cash buy the biggest HD you can. You may have to partition a
bit of it so that it is not mounted automatically, but the speed differnence
is incredible. Another thing to remember is that most 6.4Gb hard disks have
at least a 512K cache on them (just as much memory as the original A500),
which boosts performance further.

With regards,

    James Jaffrey

Call that a magazine? I thought it was a wrapper for a CD :) I sometimes
wonder why I continue to buy it.

OK, FWIW here's my opinion on the points you've raised here. 

I must admit from what I've seen of Richard's writing in both CU and AF
that I don't think he's one of the best writers around. He seems to
either talk in techno bable without explaining it clearly for those without
such knowledge, or as in this article and most cases insults the
intelligence of a 2 year old. IMHO one of the best writers is/was Andrew
Korn.

On the point of using HTML instead of the custom frontend I feel
to some extent he does have a fair point. While I appreciate you like the
frontend viewer, which the author has obviously spent a lot of time and
hard work on. Personally I feel that the magazine could look a lot better
using HTML. An example of this is the fixed use of the times font, I
much prefer to use something like Helvetica, IMO it's easier to read.
Another example is the links to to other WWW sites, which would work
perfectly from the start. Using snoopdos I notice that clicking on a link
attemps to use the openurl.library, but there's nothing in the distribution
to explain this or how it should be used/setup. For ol' hands with the
Amiga it's no problem to work out. However, for a lot of others they'll
have no clue. He does say... 

"I suppose, that the whole thing, browser and copy, will easily onto a
single floppy" 

Maybe not the nicest way of putting it, but it is there.

Yeah, a bit of a throwaway comment wasn't it. Amiga format is the only
publication that uses an index? hah I think not.

Hmmm, Looking for Games under .... err..... Games? That's a really good
idea that Amiga Format came up with. Oh boy :( Yep, I have to agree another
throwaway comment from Richard Dumbass :)

Isn't that what Amiga Format do too ?

I wonder :)

Maybe he thinks you have the time and resources to get unique interviews
with all the Amiga people, just like they do...... they do??? I don't think
so somehow.

Just an idea Chris and I'm not taking the Pi** here, but have you
considered emailing Richard Drummond himself to see what he says? I think
that in the above paragraphs you've explained your points very well.
Allturnativly why not post a message to the [afb] Amiga Format mailing
list? Then at least 600+ others would see it as well. 

Perhaps you should consider sending a copy of AIO to the forthcoming
AmigActive magazine. Details at Http://www.amigactive.com

Ohhhh that's got you rattled hasn't it? :)

IKWYM considering that he's being paid to write this article it seems IMHO
to have been chucked together without much effort or thought.

Forget the few negatives they'll just disscourage you. If they have a valid
point fair enough, otherwise forget them, they're not worth it.

Just one final minor thing I'd like to mention Chris. How about a decent
icon for AIO? I think you'll agree the current one is crap.

Hi Chris,
 In a message dated 12 Jun 99 Chris wrote to All:

I've been able to get this issue now, and to be honest, it's not
that bad a review of AIO at all.  He even refers to it as `one of the better
electronic magazines around.'

Next time, count to ten and relax :)

Hi!

    I recommend the use of PC2Amiga.  With a null modem connected between an
Amiga and a PC, PC2Amiga allows you to access the PC and all its files as if
it was an Amiga device.

NT don't stop at programs that aren't in use, even programs in use gets
swapped many times. This is due to that NT is designed to kill for physical
memory. It doesn't matter if you got 10000GB of free memory, NT will still
swap out all memory that it thinks is unused for this perticular microsecond
to the swapfile. This is why people use for example QNX as an realtime OS
instead of NT..

I was a masochist I suppose but I have 96MEG now and the PC has improved
in this respect. Its still amazing to me that for a simple desktop 32MEG
cant' suffice. I know someone who has 16MEG the bare minimum Windows 98
requirement I believe and all it does is crash really. Yet to me 16MEG
is still a lot of memory. What the hell is Microsoft doing with it all?

I think the bulk of Amigas sold could be considered compact but of
course Commodore did venture into the big box market. I may be wrong but
I always considered them to be a small part sales wise of Amigas out
there.

I know very little about Windows NT. Some people say its a big
improvement but as I use my PC a lot for games I  presume its a complete
non starter. Many games especially older ones don't mention NT at all.

You know I even put a second hard drive in my PC a 210MEG one dedicated
to Virtual Memory only and it made a big difference but having to do
this seems a bit pathetic to be frank.

Hi  Andy
I got Final Writer versions 4 & 97 when I bought another guys system as a
backup for mine. Both final writer versions only have American English
lexicons so I spell check with Wordworth and tart the script up with
final writer 97.

Roger

   PC's are fine, it's just Windows that/ I/ have a problem with (*my* copy
to be
presice). It went wacko when I installed a Voodoo2 and I had to re-install
it. Now it doesn't detect its internal modem or video caputer card, and
can't play audio CD's any more.  Typical, just typical. And I can't get
thought to tech support!  Pah.

   I suppose the N64 emulator (almost) makes up for it ;)

See ya.

Subject: [just-amiga] For the last time, TOODLE PIP, FAQ.
X-UIDL: c774ff42a2465d2e7abbfe646caa7787

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hmmm, i've been getting alot of emails about what is toodle pip and what
does it mean, etc.

Well here you go, Toodle Pip FAQ, for the last time :) no more asking,
please :)?!

1. What is Toodle Pip?

Toodle Pip is a typical English sounding word. The likes used in
WWI and maybe WWII. I bet everyone outside of england or the UK
thinks words like Tally Ho and Chops Away in a posh english
voice are still used, well actually they aren't. Toodle Pip
just sounds similar, its less well known but sounds good so I
use it.

2. What does it mean?

Bye, Goodbye, Cya, l8r, bibi.

Tally Ho!

*very late response -busy, sorry*

I use Fusion. I don't recall the version number. I'm sure it's at least
2.0. I'd have to check when I get home (at work now, no miggies here). I
also use Fusion (PC version) at work on an old beat up PC for fun.

You should be able to choose any screenmode you'd like. I find 1024x768
15bit PC preferable. I'd like higher but the available screenmodes (in Mac)
are a tad too flickery.


>Does it make a big difference if I run the Emulator in 8 bit/15bit /24bit ?

There might be a difference but none that I've noticed. It may be dependant
on your particular hardware setup too.


>Where is the diference between a 512Kb Rom and an 1024Kb rom ?

1mb ROMs are prefered -they were mostly used with 68040 Macs. the 512k ROMs
were used primarily in 68030 and older Macs. A 1mb ROM is required if you'd
like to use MacOS8.x.


>By the way: "Don't you know Jack" runs perfectly on my configuration !!!! 

Same here. =) I have a few snapshots of my emulation if you're interested.
It works quite well and surprisingly fast.


I've found that I have to use both SS and Fusion depending on what I need
to do. I could not, for the life of me get MacOS to even install with
Fusion so I had to do that with SS. Once everything was installed I then
switched to Fusion. Now that I've got 8.1 going smoothly it won't boot up
using SS (yes, I have the MacOS8 setting enabled and other odds and ends
checked out). Ohwell. It works great how I have it and am happy with that.

Are you trying to tell me they used to use chunks of meat to stop aircraft
rolling away? :)

"Chocks away" is what you meant, methinks.

Actually hear folks say "toodle pip" faerly often around here (lancs).
Mainly Old folks though.
