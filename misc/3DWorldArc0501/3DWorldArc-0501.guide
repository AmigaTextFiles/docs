Hi,

If I have any luck, some people here should be familiar with StormMesa
programming.
I'm trying to create a Mesa context inside a window opened by intuition.
I use AmigaMesaCreateContextTags(....)
and then AmigaMesaMakeCurrent(...) as described in the Amigamesa.h header
file.
The problem is:
1) The rendering doesen't appear to be done by the 3D hardware.
2) It's quite unstable.


What are the needed parameters to give AmigaMesaCreateContextTags to get 
HW accelerated rendering ?
If anyone have a working example showing how this is done, it would be nice
if you could send it to me :-)

Yes, we'll put it in the first FAQ for Shogo.

I guess you should add a warning to first Shogo update about these ENV
settings..

A mac emulator is something different, that's for sure. However, these 
variables will severely interfer with a lot of programs (almost everything 
that uses networks will use unaligned access). I don't know if it does this, 
since I don't have iFusion, but the installer should definately tell the user 
that these variables might cause problems with other programs. 

When I write an installer, I either ask the user "do you want to modify these 
settings", or tell him to do it himself. I never change another package's 
settings without notice.

The memprot envvar is needed if you wish to use the PPC's MMU.
The EnAlignExc envvar is needed to pass alignment errors
to the Mac. Both are VITAL to the emulation. What Sam needs
to do is make it where these things are not envvars that are
either OFF or ON, they need to be controlled on the fly by
the running programs.

Installed iFusion lately ? :-)

This is actually easy to fix. You need to delete this variable:
     EnAlignExc

from ENVARC:PowerPC and set this variable
     memprot
to 0, then reboot.

iFusion installs these for reasons that are beyond me, since the EnAlignExc 
is only useful for developers for tuning programs, and will usually not make 
your system any better. Shogo needs unaligned access, though, since it wants 
to stay compatible with Windows/Linux/Mac servers.

memprot should always be set to 0 for Warp3D programs.

Okay,

Here's my machines specs:

http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/~as0aba/MyAmiga/MyAmiga.html

You can also see my various variables that are set, I will improve them
as I collate the data.

My problem is, that I can select a BVision screen, and get all the way
up to the menu and
start a new game.  However it loads for ages.  SnoopDOS shows that it's
loading various textures
but after a while it stop and gives me the following Warp-OS Exception:

Any ideas, or solutions as to why it doesn't work on my setup, don't I
have enough memory (64 MB) ?
Do you need more info like my library versions ?

I've tried to find a developper archive for V4.0, but it seems it
doesn't exist. Is it normal ?

Well, it wouldn't be normal if you found it, because I haven't done it yet. I 
wanted to brush up the documentation a bit, but I found out that I don't get 
the time to do that, anyway. I'm going to pack it together ASAP, keep bugging
