Got some GREAT news for all you ppc dudes, I just went to the amiga.org website & saw that a new expansion card is coming out for the PPC cards (It plugs into where the BVision/CVision would).  We get 3x PCI connectors & 1x AGP plus a PC100 Memory connector !!
This thing whips the Mediator by far (see amiga.org article to find out why), best of all the first driver they're working on is a Voodoo 5 3D driver !!  I bet all you 3D performance loving guys are opening up the champagne .

Would I be correct in saying that a lot of people on this list are probably very happy right now ???? Cause I sure am !

what about the Bvision expantion port only being 25mhz
??
dosent that bottle neck with memory gfx card 3D card &
all that stuff.

I still want one but what dose this mean for us
at-the-FPS-Quake-World-end-of-the-day?

They seem to think it's 66mhz (Read the article at amiga.org before we start getting confused)

It's kick arss compared to the Mediator as it has the full 4GB address space or whatever it's called.  It also has DIRECT access to the PPC so CPU2GFX copying would be speedy.

It probably means that with a Voodoo 5 you're amiga's gonna kick arss with nice resolution & great FPS ratings.

They'll sort something out probably, maybe a new flash update would add extra features like generic AGP output for boot-menu,etc ??

I've heard that it can also make coffee. Is it true, or it is another
rumour to make people wait until it's out rather than buy a new coffee
machine right now ?

I'd wait for a while to see if this is true...it could be justa  joke, or
vaporware to stop another Amiga company succeeding with its plans (after
all, this would REALLY damage sales of Mediator)

perhaps they have the *idea* but wont be able to make it for a couple of
years...and this would be bad news for the support we DO have forthcoming
from companies.

anyway, that connector on the PCP cards is small and flimsey...i wouldnt
like to hang a big busboard off it! AND its only got <23MB/s xfer rates....
its useless to have (and pay for) and AGP connector. a decent PCI card would
almost be a waste too

Subject: @{b}[warpup] WarpUp crashing frequently@{ub}


Recently my GL programs would cause crashes on my BVision. For instance 
I would be playing GLQuake and the computer would just crash instantly. 
It would then refuse to reboot until you either turned it off or 
performed a soft-reset for about 20 seconds. I've not had problems in 
the past but it has decided to do this now. To make matters worse my 
WarpUp programs are also crashing the entire computer in the same way. 
I'm pretty certain that it couldn't be anything to do with the heat 
since I've lived in some very cold and hot places this year. Could 
someone post some details of what their settings are and what version 
of the PPCLibEmu they are using so that I can reinstall WarpUp and 
Warp3D from stratch. My computer's been very stable up until now.

Thanks

What about the Violator (From EyeBox), then? It gives you PCI, AGP
_and_ USB slots and connects to the PCMCIA slot! Amazing, right?
They're even considering making a version for the A500 trapdoor
expansion.

The CGFX team are already hard at work creating Voodoo9 drivers
for this card.

And it would be impossible to install it in a A3000D. The CVPPC is
an incredible tight fit, with the 'A3000 isolator pappe' and all
:-)

Yes but.... the mediator already exists (some "devellopers" already own one)
and a first shipment of 1000 card is nrea shipment...
When will the predator card be available? I don't expect it before January
2001, or even in six months.... before that, as soon as i will have my
mediator i will bye a voodoo3-3000 card and if the predator arrive at
least, i could always re-sell the mediator to a non-PPC amiga user.

Bye,

The Mediator works on all A1200 Tower systems, regardless of accelerator so that gives people with 68k only PCI while the Predator gives us PPC owners speedier PCI & an AGP so Mediator won't get squashed. The Predator only works on A4k's with a CPCC probably to do with the layout & also the A1200 tower (I wonder if it has to be a certain tower case ??). 

> When will the predator card be available? I don't expect it before January
Well they promise within a month (Have you read the amiga.org article yet? come on !)

Sounds like a good plan, I'm sure ther 68k'ers out their will want to play with PCI.

The PCI-Bridge for CyberstormPPC is for real. I know that Martin Schueler from 
Escena is working since some time on it. I did not know it under the name 
"Predator", but the hardware itselves is for real. I did not hear about that 
AGP-stuff (Martin always talked about a Addon to be able to put up to 3 PCI 
Cards into an Amiga, he never mentioned AGP, neither SDRAM-on-Board). The 
stuff about Drivers for Voodoo 5 already in developement is as to my knowledge 
not true. I think it will make most sense to do Voodoo 3 Drivers for the 
thing, so that Drivers from Mediator can be "recycled". This would also make 
more sense, as the Voodoo 5 is very expensive, while the Voodoo 3 has a much 
more reasonable pricing and is still MUCH more powerful than everything we 
ever had...

I do not know for sure 
how far Martin is with the Board (how much after the Mediator it's release 
will be), nor what the state of the A1200 version is (up to now - but I did 
not talk with him for quite some time - it was about a CyberstormPPC-Addon, 
but possible that a BlizzardPPC addon will also come, it would make sense). 
Also as Elbox does Mediator for A1200 (and A4000 later) and DCE a Board for 
A4000 (and A1200 later I guess
) this would mean less concurrence between the two, if Elbox cares for the 
A1200 market first, and DCE for the A4000 market first.

ow> perhaps they have the *idea* but wont be able to make it for a couple of

I think it is quite close to release. But Mediator is already THERE on the 
other hand (not to the end customer, okay, but I *do* know people who have a 
Board already...)

Forgive me if I`m wrong but if you`re using W3D doesn`t the bus speed only
apply to the number of polys your passing to the onboard hardware? or does
the bus speed effect the speed of the 3D chip?

IIRC (please correct me if I'm wrong) that connector is a custom (25 MHz I
think) 68k bus. That is why CVPPC can be used with both the CS Mk III and
the CSPPC. As for the 66MHz: that is the speed of the bus on the Predator.

Limited by the expansion port. The transfer speeds of it are slow, not much
faster than Zorro III (ask Pavel Narozny; he seems to have done some
tests).

Probably not; actually by Amiga standards I guess it would be "great". You
still need (aside from a fast bus) a fast CPU to feed that 3D accelerator
the data it needs to generate the scene. Sure it would probably be better
than anything we've had so far but a 233 MHz PPC won't come close to
saturating something like a VooDoo 5 and a VooDoo 3 is cheaper.

Besides all this the timing of this (mis?)information is very curious. Just
as the Mediator is about to hit the market... (fill in the gaps).

Yep, it still is. The problem was the fan on my PSU. It had blown a few 
weeks ago and I took it out and removed the build up of dust and other 
rubbish from the vents. When I put it back in it started working again, 
but not as well it seems. I now have a new fan and Warp3D doesn't seem 
to be crashing anymore. Which is nice.

You were. We don't make it happen. The only two RTG systems there is have
closed devkits. So doing a driver would require a new RTG system. Something
like a GPL'ed RTG system.

They don't care about Amiga. All they care about is Amiga.

That sounded confusing, ehh ?

Well, they don't care about the *REAL* Amiga. All they care about is the Elate

It is 0% AmigaOS. But still, it's name is AmigaOS. So, AmigaOS and AmigaOS

If I'm not mistaken, Elate is the name of the kernel only. The full OS is called
AmigaOE (for Amiga Operating Environment) - Amie for short.

It can emulate 68k Amiga Programs 100% & they are building it with many of the ideas that built the amiga OS you know today - so I wouldn't say that it's 100% not amiga os.

Yep Thats Right, By the way who here will run the AmigaOE on their PPC Amiga Classic's.  I'm still deciding but I might leave my A1200 a total classic & get a PC with an AMD K7@1Ghz (YEAH!) which would give me plenty of performance from the new OS & Windows which is what I'll have to run under it for compatibility reasons but the rule will apply that applies to all my computers - NO ADDITIONAL MS CRAP ALLOWED (e.g. MsWord, MS IE&OE, etc)..

Well, it's something completely different, and since when have it been able to

It would rather have a PPC native AmigaOS, the real AmigaOS. If it will ever
come.
And a G4 would be nice, if just Motorola could be arsed to get rid of their
problems.
Oh well, dreaming as always.

And add an "if the AmigaOE will run on PPC Amiga's".

It's part of their plans, so classic owners can switch over to the latest technology while still being able use their current software I guess.

Nah, it's IBM's POP-board. And some faster G4's. And a PPC native AmigaOS.

Really ??  Well that'll be a priority to get it going since the "emulation layer" is supposed to be a significant piece of the AmigaOE.

I have a RBM Towerhawk ex 1200. And the Mediator will NOT fit into it

You might make it work, but then you would have to disable the PPC. No RISC,
no fun.

Or you could code a 68k/PPC synchronized VMM system, if you like :)

I have the same probleme with my 060+603, and I couldn't make it work on my
previous Blizzard 1260 neither. I guess that VMM 3 is just plain obsolete. Get
rid of it and give a try to MuLib.

In the past, i achieved to have it running on my previous Blizzard 1230-IV
system.... but not on my PPC card.
But it's possible that the MMUs are used in order to permit the memory
sharing between 68K or PPC (or it could be used for another purpose where
the ppc is concerned... don't know exactly). If there is no available MMU
able to run on the PPC side, then VMM wouldn't be able to run.

Hi!

I have a small problem. Most of my PPC programs hangs after a few minutes
except AmigaAMP 2.8b6 which works fine for hours. But if i try rc5, Heretic
II, (GL)Quake(WOS/PPC) or any other ppc-programs I get a 
WarpOS-Exception after a few minutes or the computer reboots by itself.
 
Anyone have an idea what could be wrong? 
 
I'm running WarpOS v4 (powerpc.library v15) and OS 3.5.
I don't think it's a cooling problem as i have one fan on the PPC and one
fan on the 040 and one fan blowing at the CVPPC and the memory on the CSPPC.


Kind regards

Maybe. Sounds familiar.

Check the fault address in your WarpOS exception windows for the
following:

1. The first digit of LR is either '4' or '8'.
2. SRR0 (the program counter) is equal to LR.

When you can confirm the two points above, then it is. All 233
MHz CSPPCs have a cooling problem (simply misdesigned by P5).
Before searching for a stronger PPC fan, you might also try
CSPPCFix233.lha from Aminet, which fixes those exceptions as
long as the card doesn't get too hot.

I have to run it too, when playing Quake for longer than some
minutes... :)

I think the PPC chip itself is the problem. It's still the
original fan, isn't it?

But isn't the GUI's fixing that?

I run both from their GUI's. And GLQuke dosn't start at all if i forget to
start without and stack at all. When i run from shell i use 500000 for
Quake and it starts fine but then i hangs after a few minutes.

I tried ppc programs a couple of times now and got:

RC5:   " LR:  28BC64D0", "LR:  887BFECC", "LR:  887CE364".
GLQuake: there all of them started with "LR:   083......"

...and the SRR0 is the same as the LR.
So sometimes it's a LR-bug and somtimes it's not. Yesterday when i checked
some of the exceptions from RC5 they started with "08.....".

Where and what command should I start it with?
I have tried start it with "c:CSPPCFix233_wos >NIL:" and 
"c:run c:CSPPCFix233 >NIL:" in the Startup-Sequence but the 
computer refuses to start both times.

No... it's a new PC 486 fan... and the old PPC fan is on the 040 now. And
the the one that blows on the CVPPC/memory is a 60*60mm fan.

Maybe I should add an 80*80mm fan too blowing at CSPPC.

Sorry, it was '2' not '4' (on my system, and on yours too as it
seems).

Yes, this is the CSPPC/233MHz heat problem - also called "LR-bug".
The register contents is still correct, only a single bit (the
2 or 8 at the beginning) has changed from 0 to 1.

Maybe it has something to do with the design of the 604e chip,
that the heat first affects those bits? I don't know.

Correct. Then you have two problems. What's with normal Quake?
I heard that GLQuake is a bit more unstable?

Hmm...  Also when running from a fresh rebooted system?

Not in the startup-sequence. This might be too early. Make a
simple test: Just open a shell and type "C:CSPPCFix233_wos" (for
the WarpOS-version). Does that freeze your system too?

Then run your RC5 client and watch for the fixed LR-bugs which
are reported in this shell. When playin Quake for hours I some-
times have thousands of fixed LR-bugs showing up.

Oh, that's bad. Does a 486 fan fit onto the small PPC?

You can try it, but there is not guarantee. More cooling helped in
many cases, but not in all.

Hello,

A friend of mine give me 2 16MB EDO simms's (60ns,single sided)
to replace my 2 8MB 70ns simms,
but when i installed them on my BlizzPPC/200Mh 040/25Mh ,
I still had 16MB (15.5 actually) ram....
Does Blizzard  has any limmitation on the type of simm it can use?
With the new simms my 040 works fine but the PPC/Warpos doesnt work at
all...
It seems strange! The simms on PC are 16MB ,like expected, but my amiga
sees them as 8MB...
What is going on?

Regards

               Giannis M.

I had this problem when my miggy thought my 32 mb modules only 
was 16 mb. There seems to be no solution to this, but to get some 
other modules. They have to be of a type that does not support, eh, 
i dont remember, but it is a mode of some kind, i even think it had 
"mode" in it's name. These modules are a little more expensive :/ 
I'm afraid you wont be able to use those 16 MB modules as more 
than 8 MB.

I had the same problem : It's a question of having the parity bit on the
chip or not.  If there is not, the simm only give half of it's content as it
uses the second half for parity (DON'T KNOW DETAILS BUT ASK A HARDWARE
SPECIALIST).

The Blizzard Card doosn't give a damn about Parity, it says in the manual that if Parity RAM is used then the additional bits (4 bits on top of the 32 = 36) are simply ignored.  Therefore using Parity or non-parity has the same affect.  Have both SIMMS in this problem being checked to make sure they are working (so when one 16mb card gets pulled out does the RAM go down to 8mb, try this with BOTH SIMMS) ??

I have checked the simm's with every combination (alone or both of them)
even using the new 16MB together with the old 8Mb but with no help..
I seems like my Blizz dislikes them....

Hi Bo,

I'm contacting you through this mailing list since my A1200 is out of action
because I had just received the crystal you sent me &  was installing it.

I installed the crystal on the opposite side if the card that the original
crystal had been mounted, booted up the computer with it all opened up &
was very impressed with the speedup.  I then went to do everything up &
found that the crystal was pushing the RAM card up, which was jamming up
against the Keyboard.  I then decided to remotely mount the crystal
elsewhere, I was soldering the wires onto the crystal when as I was
straightening a pin it fell off :-( :-( :-(

How quickly can you get me another one ??
I suppose  this time you will charge so how much ??

Thanks

what crystal are you using? As time goes on I get more tempted to 'uprade'

This can have two reasons:

1. There are real software bugs causing this exception (either RC5
   itself, or a sideeffect of another faulty program).

2. Your PPC gets far too hot. So hot, that not only the LR register
   is affected, but also other parts of the chip which lead to
   those crashes.

NO NO NO!  It has nothing to do with parity, it is because of the 
pagesize.  Most SIMMs are now made with a 4k pagesize but many amiga 
accelerators only support 2k, therefore it only sees half of the 
memory.  The only solution is to get new SIMMs I'm afraid, try to find 
someone who can guarantee the pagesize of the ram.

It was only a simple download page for the beta versions. Some
weeks ago the (more or less) stable versions have been released to
Aminet, so there was no more need for those pages.

BTW, the current version, which implements all "ProQuake"
enhancements, is directly downloadable from the server (without
html interface) since some weeks:

http://home.owl.de/~frank/quakeWOS.lha
http://home.owl.de/~frank/quakePPC.lha
http://home.owl.de/~frank/quake68k.lha

I rather wanted to make a new Aminet release immediately, but I'm
hunting a nasty bug since this time now which prevents that
(the bug is not included in the versions above, BTW).

No! In fact you have to connect a connector from your PSU straight on the
Motherboard, by the connector intended for floppy drive power supply. Then
you will need another connector from the PSU to be plug directly on the
Floppy drive to feed him with power.

 I'm interested in this too. I have a 2nd hand Bvision coming soon,
and the seller is throwing in a power feed adapter as well. I've never
seen a Bvision "in the flesh" so to speak. I can only think that
perhaps the lead connects in parallel with the PPC fan on the blizzard

Just don't add power from two different sources, or you'll experience crashes

the extra power lead to the BVision connects onto the floppy-header on the
A1200 motherboard. therefore you have to have a secondary lead that will
convert the HD power to a HD + FD. This takes the load off the Trapdoor slot
power lines (which arent that good)

I don't think it's software bugs... at least not with rc5 as i had it
running for days on my A1200. AmigaAMP might have some problems but it 
is 99.9% stable on my brothers computer. He can run rc5+AAMP as long as he
wants without problems.

The PPC is not near as hot as i was in my Desktop. There i could burn my

Hmm... seems like it didn't help much. If i run one ppc-program it runs much
better than before but if I for example run rc5 and AAMP 2.8b6 I get about
3-4 LR fixes in the cli-window every second. Then after about 100 LR fixes it
comes an WarpOS exception.
Can it still be overheated? I have one 60*60mm fan blowing on the
040+permedia2 and one 80*80mm blowing on the PPC+040+memory.

There should be problem in contact between PPC and heatsink. You should try
to buy thermal paste (I`m not sure if its the correct name).

Thanks I think I'm already doing this as my Eyetech EZtower has a
floppy connector from the PSU connected to the motherboard floppy

In the middle of all this power talk, I found out that the cable connecting the motherboard on my PSU for 5 volt is getting extremely 
hot in the junction. This is prolly of a not too good connection in the 
junction. Do you people suggest that I solder the two ends 
togeather, instead of using this standard connector? Or should I 
find somewhere on the A1200 motherboard to place an extra cable 
to the 5 volt supply? I already have 5 volt coming in at the BPPC 
fans connector on the PPC board.
BTW I have the power tower.
I suppose when I get my Mediator which i ordered long time ago, 
and some voodoo III board, I'll have to solder 5 volt directly to the 
Voodoo board to help the motherboard?

When is the next version of WarpOS due? I know some things have changed

we see a new version released and what features/bugfixes? ;-)

It sounds like there is to much Current through this 5Volt cable... Try to
place an extra cable on another location on the Motherboard.

No, the mediator card for example is intended to be powered directly and it
accept P8 and P9 connector that you always find on standard PSU from the
"PC" world.

Subject: @{b}[warpup] PowerPC problems@{ub}

Hello everyone:

When it comes to running PPC-programs it seems to me that there may be some
problems running more than one program at the same time. (Program hangs)
-I wonder if this could be the problem for some users.


A second solution came from a friend of mine. He used a Blizzard PPC card
for some time without any problems, -until he bought the BlizzardVision.
It turned out that one of the small chips "hiding" underneath the PPC's
heatsink was getting too hot. Apparently this chip is not in contact with
the PPC's heatsink whitch it probably should be. A combination of thermal
paste and a small piece of metal should do the trick.


My BlizzardPPC owning friend has also, like suggested by others on this list
connected a power-lead to the disk-drive's power connector to ensure
reliable
operation.

A release is planned in about 1-2 weeks. There won't be any breathtaking
features. Things were done requested by developers and, as always, some
bugs have been removed. I will introduce the new release by sending a
post to this mailing list, before the official news on the homepage will
appear.

Possible. The desktop case should never get so hot. Mine (A3k)
gets a bit warmer, but it's nearly not noticeable when comparing
with a cold, switched off, system.

Every second? This is a lot. I also had situations where I got
a hit every 2-3 seconds (average) - but 3-4 *per* second?

I would guess so. But when you say you already installed monster-
fans and the PPC stays cool then I fear it is indeed damaged... :(

Subject: @{b}[warpup] Annoying BlizzardVision problem@{ub}


First off, sorry that I mail this to two mailing-lists.

Due to a harddisk that died on me I have had to reinstall
my system and now I just can't seem to get my BlizzardVision
to work correctly again. The only picture I can get is
the emergency-pass-through picture so I can see what I'm
doing and the CybergraphX boot-logo. Nothing more.

What I have done is:

1. Install Workbench 3.1
2. Upgrade to Workbench 3.5
3. Installed CyberGraphX 4.

If I reboot at that point I get the
CybergraphX logo and nothing more
happens. If I remove/rename the cgxbootpic.library
I just get a black screen, otherwise the same symptoms.
The only way I can get the computer to boot into the workbench
is by removing the monitor-drivers from Devs:monitors.

4. I've also applied the latest upgrade I could find (cgx42pre7)
which didn't make any difference whatsoever.

I can't remember having had this kind of problem when I installed
it the first time so...what am I missing?

I`ve used the first and have no complaints. There was a rumour that the second
caused problems with WOS but it seems to have been bs.

Do you have anything connected to the PAL output? Praps your Workbench is
going out through there if you have not set Screenmode.prefs.

perhaps check your list of available CGX _4_ screenmodes, I remember
when I installed CGX4 for my BVision it radically killed all previously
defined CGX3 (yes, the patched one) screenmodes and I had about the same
symptoms when booting my Amiga. But just an idea .....

Thank you! That was indeed it. Silly of me not to think of that...
Still, I can't recall that I had to do that before. But hey,
