                       (A small presentation of USG-Net)

                             Version 1.5, release 1
                                Updated: 19.5.95



                         --==>> What is USG-Net? <<==--

     USG-Net is a network aimed at development of standards, specifications
    and software.  This means that USG-Net will provide a good base for
    software developers, development of new standards and other
    development-related issues.  USG-Net is a net dedicated to computers,
    and the people who work with them.  This means that the net will not
    carry any off-topic echos, concerning for example politics or religion.


                 --==>> What type of network is USG-Net? <<==--

     USG-Net makes use of the Fido(tm) technology, therefore it is a 'FTN'
    (Fido Technology Network).  To join USG-Net, your software has to
    support at least the technical matters described in the current
    revisions of the 'FTS' (FidoNet Technical Standard) documents as
    supplied by the 'FSC' (FidoNet Standards Commitee).  Your software
    should also be able to distribute files using a TICK-compatible
    fileprocessor.


                           --==>> Why USG-Net? <<==--

     Why was USG-Net started?  Well, it began with the birth of the file
    description standard invented by the Users Standards Group.  At first,
    USG discussed the development of the standard through netmail, but this
    didn't allow members to discuss every small idea between themselves,
    which made the development slow and cumbersome.  This led to the
    proposal of starting our own echomail area, and FidoNet was suggested as
    the net to use.  However, after several attempts at setting up a FidoNet
    area, the suggestion of setting up our own net surfaced.  While still
    attempting a FidoNet solution, Micke Persson began research on WHY a
    USG-Net would be a better solution.  The members of USG then voted on a
    FidoNet echo or our own net, USG-Net, and the voters chose USG-Net for
    reasons I will explain below.


                      --==>> Why start another net? <<==--

     Why didn't we go for an existing net, like FidoNet for our echo?  Well,
    since most of the members knew FidoNet to be rather slow and cumbersome,
    we agreed not to use FidoNet.  We wanted the echomail to be fast, not
    taking over a week to reach the majority of the readers.  For
    developers, this means that delaytimes will be as small as possible.


                   --==>> Why not use an existing net? <<==--

     Then why not use other existing nets?  Most other nets are somewhat
    limited, AmigaNet for example, is mainly for Amiga users.  Of course,
    there are nets that could have been used, but they are somewhat
    anonymous and tend to be as slow (or slower) than FidoNet.  This wasn't
    what we were looking for either.


               --==>> What are the main goals for USG-Net? <<==--

     USG-Net will be a net fully dedicated to COMPUTERS.  USG-Net will also
    be directed towards development of programs and specifications, as well
    as discussions regarding computers, hardware and software.  USG-Net
    should also be the perfect "playground" for betatesting software, with
    quick responses from betatesters.  USG-Net will probably also aim a
    little higher regarding computer-knowledge.  Quality, not quantity.


                  --==>> Who will benefit from USG-Net? <<==--

     For example, developers will benefit by having a betatesting echo where
    the responses are significantly faster than what other nets provide.
    Also, developers are given the opportunity to coordinate with other
    developers, as well as share experiences, tips and hints.


                --==>> How do I become a part of UGSNet? <<==--

     To become a node in USG-Net, fill out the form appended at the end of
    this document, and send it to your nearest USG-Net administrator.
    Ability to receive crashmail during 24hours per day is a small basic
    concept your system has to support to get a node number.  If you can't
    fulfil this criteria, the only way to join USG-Net is to become a point
    under an existing node.  In that case, you might want to contact your
    nearest HUB or HOST, to see where the nearest node is located.


                      --==>> Who should I contact? <<==--

     USG-Net Main Administrators:

    RC SWEDEN 8:10/1   Disaster Team's BBS +46-418-36999 (2:200/430@fidonet)
    Host West 8:101/1  Wedlock             +46-35-186514 (2:203/807@fidonet)
    Host East 8:102/1  The Beast 2         +46-171-67673 (2:206/115@fidonet)
    RC NORWAY 8:11/1   Alpha Centauri      +47-31-288542 (39:220/1@amiganet)

     From anyone of these, you can FILEREQUEST the latest nodelist, by using
    the magic name "USGNODES", and in the nodelist you can find your nearest
    node or administrator (RC/HOST/HUB) to contact for more information.

     You can also get the latest version of any textfile concerning USG-Net,
    (such as rules and specifications) from any node in the nodelist.
