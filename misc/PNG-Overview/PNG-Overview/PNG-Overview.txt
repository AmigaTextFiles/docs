 PNG-Overview (3.8.97)
 ---------------------
 As you might have noticed, the PNG file format is more and more
 widely accepted, although a complete migration from GIF to PNG
 often is not possible completely or right now for some reasons.

 But it is desirable nevertheless. This is a rather complicated
 topic and cannot be explained in a few words, thus you may
 visit the PNG homepage (maintained by Greg Roelofs) at

   http://www.wco.com/~png/

 ...take a look at Michael C. Battalina's good article available at

   http://www.cloanto.com/users/mcb/19950127giflzw.html

 ...or refer to Philippe Duchenne's Amiga guide version of the PNG
 specification under Aminet:docs/hyper/PNG-guide.lha

 Just to mention a few details out of there: PNG is an international
 attempt to replace Compuserve's GIF file format, which is subject
 to Unisys' LZW patents, by a better and patent-claim free graphics
 file format. PNG is not intended to replace any pseudo-animation
 facilities of GIF (soon there may be an multi-image file format based
 on PNG as well, though) but instead offers upto 48 Bits per pixel
 and introduces alpha channel facilities, etc.

 Of course no one can say "stop using GIF, now only PNG counts",
 since there are still thousands of GIF images floating around on
 CD-ROMs, some programs still cannot handle PNG, some people
 simply don't want to replace GIF with PNG - and last'n'least this of
 course all is a democratic and public process, where everyone's
 opinion does count.

 But if you want to support small software developers, like most
 of the companies, shareware and freeware software developers on
 the Amiga are, there is need to help them avoiding any unnecessary
 difficulties - remember why you are prefering an alternative system
 like the Amiga...

 Included in this directory you find a list of Amiga software currently
 supporting PNG - perhaps it is not complete, but it is just to show,
 that there's something happening.

 Note: This document only does express my personal opinion, and
       nothing else.

 Last not least:

 As decided by the WCO, PNG now is the new standard file format
 for web graphics.
