I hadn't had time to work on it lately, due to OS4, but we're currently

Hi,

Hope this isn't too OT, but I just noticed that the Quake II sourcecode was
made available under GPL towards the end of last year.  

Is anyone aware of any Amiga ports in progress ?  If I had any free time, I
would certainly look at working on a port myself - this is one game I would
very much enjoy playing on the Amiga.  If anyone's interested in looking at
it, it is downloadable from
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/quake2.zip

Subject: WipeOut 2097 and PSXPort
From: Wolfgang Krause <wkrause@vossnet.de>
Date: 09 Feb 2002 23:34:58 +0100

Hi!

Now that I got the PSXPort hardware I wanted to play WipeOut2097 using a PSX
joypad. But that doesn't seem to work. In the guide for PSXPort it is
written that WipeOut 2097 v1.1 can directly use the PSXPort. But I only have
v1.0 dated 6.9.99 and using the program JoypadEmu slows WipeOut down very
much.
I didn't even know that there was a version 1.1 of this game for the Amiga.
So where can I get this v1.1 to play with a PSX joypad? Does anybody on the
list have a clue?


Kind regards,
Wolfgang

Already had a look at it. It seems to be pretty complete, including 
D3DX, but restricted to the DX8 interfaces. Most of the code you will 
encounter during porting is DX6 or DX7, which is completely incompatible.

It seems however that the platform-dependent part is really tiny, so 
porting this to MiniGL or Mesa should be fairly straightforward. The 
performance is still a question, though... A rewrite from DX to 
OpenGL/Warp3D will invariably be faster.

Hi all.

I spotted this interesting bit of news on Slashdot. You can find
information on an open source DirectX to OpenGL wrapped here:

http://www.v3x.net/directx/

The creators are asking for help in porting to Linux and MacOS, although
I don't think an Amiga port is out of the question! It could be useful
to some people, and helpful when porting games. I'm not sure about the
licencing terms for commercial use (hi Hyperion :)

Well, the next generation of Warp3D will most likely have an 
incompatible API with a compatibility wrapper thrown in. There are some 
things in Warp3D that do not translate too well to T&L hardware, so 
there needs to be some basic changes...

Yes, DX8 is more or less incompatible (rather more than less :-) with 
its predecessors, but all for the better IMO. I remember when I moved 
some of my own DX7 code to DX8 I had to remove almost 50% of the code 
because initialization has become much cleaner and easier and much 
functionality was completely cleaned up. Generally, the DX8 upgrade was 
long overdue and well done.

Really? I guess that is why you are trying to ensure an open ended
future for the Warp3D API... but they must have got seriously off track
if they had to start over with an incompatable API.

Yes. Either that, or if you can live with it, the driver uses 1-z when 
fogging is enabled without a vaild texture coord array...

Hey Alan...

   I've been trying to install Warp3D and the Software driver, but I cannot get it working.  I do not have a 3D gfx card, so I would love to give this a shot.  

   I tried installing the Ward3D V4.0, Warp3D V4.2 and Warp3D V4.2.  Each time, I selected to uninstall the previous version before installing and selectin CV64, like the site said.  I removed the drivers and inserted the CPU driver.  I then set ENV varia
ble like the site said and when I run WarpTest, it flashes a window which says "PANIC: no driver available!!!"

   Any one else having similar problems?

Yes.  If I install hardward drivers, it says that it has found drivers, but the screen mode requester pops up blank.  

I e-mailed the author to see if he knows what might be the matter, just waiting to hear back from him.

    But it doesn't work. It doesnt work also with gouraud shading.
 Everything is coloursed with fog color (solid). It works with tmapping.
 Do You have it working, or it is just supposed to work?

    It doesn't work with either valid or invalid (NULL passed) textcoord

Hi,

Simple question...

in makefile.vbccwos there is this line:

LIBNAME = vlibwos:mgl.lib

with the version of make I have here (3.77) it creates this error:

makefile.vbccwos:35: *** target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.

It looks like the ':' in $(LIBNAME) is interpreted, which is quite
stupid IMO.

My question is: does it work at someone's place ? With which version of
Make ?

I have to use "/vlibwos/mgl.lib" to make the makefile work. (but of
course the join command still requires the "vlibwos:mgl.lib" form,
which sort of complicates the makefile for nothing...)


Also, why does "make install" copy the includes to vincludewos: ? They
are not compiler dependant.. I copied them to my main include directory
(with the OS includes and stuff like CGX etc.).


And erm, BTW, does anyone know what "-no-trigraphs" is for in VBCC ?

The installation instructions on the site do not say to remove the

You should normally release the context, then the bitmap. If you don't 
lock it anymore, it shouldn't cause any trouble, but of course, you can 
never tell what future version might do...

As my Amiga is now capable of running Warp3D applications at a half-decent
speed (060/Voodoo 3), I have started experimenting with Warp3D development. I
intend to write freeware games, most likely a first person shoot 'em up
eventually.

While I have done a little 3D programming (all in 68k asm for AGA. Things like
texure mapped object renderers), and so know how to do things like rotate
points in 3 dimensions, map textures to planes etc. I've only rendered
objects in FRONT of the camera, not created rooms that can be explored etc.

I was wondering if anyone could point me to some nice tutorials or sourcecodes
that could help with taking the steps from writing simple object render
routines to world rendering routines.

Also, I've noted that when writing Warp3D apps, once I have run my program a
few times, I end up without enough RAM for a Z-Buffer! I know this is
probably not my own fault as I wrote a program that did nothing more than
open a screen, get a W3D context, allocate a Z-Buffer, then free everything
before quitting, and eventually after running this program a few times, it
failed reporting not enough ram for a Z-Buffer.

GLSokoban68k has the same problem. Is this a known memory leakage of Warp3D?

The H2 update is on our website, i just checked, in order to be able to DL
it you have register the game, the serial number can be found on the Heretic
II CD box. I assume you already have a user account and only registered for

doubt there is any 'real' optimization for altivec more like deciding what
runs best on altivec and then running it on that one :-) (and if I remember
correctly the altivec support is rather new)

this is also dependant on the actual code, I think there is some special
cases which wreaks havoc on the 68k.

Well, you could probably debate about that for hours. In the end I think 
it is important what *you* think yourself is the best principle, 
anything else will only result in bad code.

Yes, I know :-) Fortunately those that make the loudest noise are a 
minority. Just look at all the AmigaOne threads, people *will* find 
something to bitch about even if they need to pick something like "the 
other mainboard looks better"...

Been there, done that :-)

There is a patch available for gcc to support altivec. It works by 
providing a new __attribute__ tag for inlining altivec stuff. I don't 
think that it does it automatically.

Yes, Altivec is a vector processing unit. IIRC it can operate on 16 
bytes at a time, either as 16 bytes, 8 words, 4 longs or 4 floats.

The -O3 optimization does not work. It is supposed to work for -O2 but I 
had problems even with that. Sometimes the compiler optimizes more than 
he should, the result is disappearing code. Add a printf, suddenly it 
works. Remove it again, crash.

I don't know how it works, I never looked at it, due to lack of hardware...

Yeah, as soon as you use -O3 for optimization. I guess it's the inlining...

Although this is of course rather OT, I'd like to say that you don't 
have to be OO oriented to like C++. As soon as you're juggling around 
with lot's of pointers or complex data structures, you'll be thankful 
for the constructor/destructor concept. Plus, stuff like STL will make 
your life *a lot* easier.

Of course, I also like OO. It's a way of thinking, I assume, but I 
personally wouldn't touch plain C anymore for any large scale project 
(saying that, OS4 will of course be C .... and lots of Assembler)

Only GCC supports altivec, and I think it generally produces good code. 
I personally use GCC all the time, and I'm content with it's quality. 
I've been told that vbcc comes very close, sometimes surpassing it (so

It's better than SAS or StromC3, at any rate. I think there's a problem 
with the 68k backend of GCC, though, it's not been updated for a long 
time, and it produces wrong code. For example, you can forget about 
heavy optimization with gcc in 68k (PPC is fine).

So how does Altivec work in GCC? I must admit I'm no expert, but from
what I understand it's basically a highly optimised vector processing
system. It must be hugely complex to decide to optimise code for Altivec
in that case...

You mean the code does not work? That's interesting, and well worth
knowing as I'm sure many people would simply set all optimisations to
maximum when compiling a final release version of their code.

GCC seems to be the holy grail of C compatability, the benchmark by
which everything else is measured. Time to upgrade to StormC 4 I
think...

For 68k, yes, sort of. I would rather go to SAS/C for 68k code. The only 
problem you might run into with SAS is that the code might not compile 
out-of-the-box on gcc for PowerPC.

For PPC I'd always choose gcc. VBCC supposedly creates good code too,

Hi.

I was having a debate with a friend about which compiler produces the
best 68k and PPC executables in terms of pure speed optimisation. The
main contenders are GCC, VBCC, StormC V3 and SAS/C. What about support
for things like Altivec, or optimisation of vector math routines?

I seem to remember someone said that GCC doesn't have very good
optimisation for 68k. Is that true?

Sorry if it's a bit off topic, but I think it is kind of relevant to 3D
stuff since optimisation is very important in that area.
