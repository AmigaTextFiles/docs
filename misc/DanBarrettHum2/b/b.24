	During the last few weeks, this newsgroup has seen a long
discussion on the merits of "hardware banging" versus programming using the
operating system.  Should Commodore release the AGA internal specs?  Is
hardware banging good or bad?  What secret messages are found, encrypted,
at hardware address $00B8D666?  (I'm not telling!)

	Since I'm, uh..., "associated" with a company that makes its living
banging the heck out of the Amiga hardware -- BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED, for
all you USELESS DWEEBS who don't know yet -- I made copies of all the recent
postings and mailed them to the ULTIMATE PROGRAMMERS who live deep in the
fiery bowels of the company.  (Hmmm... "fiery bowels"... I like the sound
of that.)

	Anyway, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's chief programmer was *very*
amused by all this, and he has some tips and insights to share with you
all.  I was lucky enough to catch him between hacking sessions and do a
brief interview which is presented below.  But first, a little history.

	Bobby Blazebleeder has been with the company since waaaaay back
when it first crawled up from the slime, and he's been hacking for longer
than anyone else I know -- a real child prodigy.  Even before he was born,
Bobby cleverly convinced his pregnant mother to swallow an entire UNIVAC
mainframe so he could code demos.  This bizarre yet admirable act was no
doubt a major factor in Bobby's unique ability to merge unbelievable
programming with extreme violence.

	At age 3, Bobby received his Ph.D. in Nuclear Computation from the
Harvard Stanford School of Advanced Psychosis in Chickenmilk, Wisconsin.
A bored child, Bobby floated from job to job, amazing and terrifying
people wherever he went.  It was common for him to write an entire
operating system before breakfast.  He turned out computer games by the
thousand, most of which have now sadly vanished into obscurity:  "Killer
Prunes from Neptune", "Lesbian Babysitter's Revenge", "Bunny Blaster",
"Drink My Urine Or Else", and other lost classics.

	Bobby's work did not go unnoticed.  Just before he turned fourteen,
Bobby was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless contributions to
the art of computer programming.  Unfortunately, the prize was later
revoked when the Nobel panel discovered that Bobby liked to pry off the
heads of live goats with a spoon.  Disillusioned, Bobby swore off
programming forever, moved to Europe, and became one of the continent's top
fashion models.  Old-timers on USENET might remember the controversial
issue of ENGLISH SOPHISTICATE which featured Bobby on the cover, wearing
nothing but a floppy disk, covered with mutilated weasels, bearing the
caption "The Next Pope?" The issue was quickly banned in 97 countries, but
copies can still occasionally be found circulating in the underground, or
in the hands of collectors.

	Bobby might have stayed in modeling forever, if it had not been
for a classified advertisement he saw in an obscure newsletter:

		+-------------------------------------------------------+
		| "Ultimate hacker needed immediately.  Must have	|
		| superior coding skills and violent personality.	|
		| Fashion experience a plus.  NO DWEEBS.  No telephone	|
		| calls nor resumes accepted.  REAL programmers KNOW	|
		| where to find us."					|
		+-------------------------------------------------------+

	Needless to say, Bobby had no trouble tracking us down.  We were
impressed with his astounding programming ability and unstable character.
He was impressed with our goals:  to create the FASTEST and most
MIND-BLOWING computer game ever.  Oh, and violent. VERY violent.  As you
might guess by his name, Bobby Blazebleeder was one of the driving forces
that made this dream a reality:  BLAZEMONGER.  The rest is history.

	So, now that you know all about Bobby -- his life, his loves, and
his lunacy -- here is the text of a brief interview I did last week to find
out his opinions on the Amiga hardware banging controversy.

========
Dan:	Bobby, thanks for taking the time to talk to the folks from USENET.

Bobby:	Hey, my pleasure.

Dan:	Bobby, what do you think of all this hardware-banging talk?  Why
	is everyone suddenly so interested?

Bobby:	Well, Dan, it's very simple.  You see it's AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH
	HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <KKRASH>

Dan:	Bobby, please put down that crowbar... please...

Bobby:	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!  [smashes the lamp]

Dan:	Um, perhaps a different question...

Bobby:	[demolishes a nearby brick wall]  CONSTANTINOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHY
	IS EVERYONE FROM CONSTANTINOPLE?!?!?!??!  IN WHALES????!??!???
	HUNGA HUNGA HUNGA HUNGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Dan:	Er...

Bobby:	RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
	RRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGG mainly because Commodore has released the new
	"AGA" machines without providing full documentation on how they
	work internally.  [Wipes some brick particles and drool off his
	3-piece suit.] 	Until now, the hacker community had CBM's "Hardware
	Reference Manual", but now they feel lost.

Dan:	What do you think of Commodore's decision not to release an AGA
	Hardware Manual to the general public?

Bobby:	I think it's a good decision for several reasons.  First of all,
	REAL programmer's don't need Commodore's WIMPY manuals in the
	first place, so it doesn't hurt us at all.  Hell, we don't even
	need the COMPUTERS.  Lock ANYONE from our team in a closet with no
	manuals, no computer, and no equipment of any kind, and in 15
	minutes or less he or she will have a COMPLETE spec document
	written about the whole system, just by sheer HACKING POWER.
	Of course, the other team members don't NEED this document at
	all anyway, but it's fun to do it just for laughs.

	Second, having no manuals means less competition for us.  All those
	PSEUDO-HACKHEADS with their WORTHLESS disassemblers and INSIPID
	programming skills will CRY FOR MOMMY and quit the market.  Poor
	babies.

	But the final, BEST reason that it's good is because the hardware
	manuals are all WRONG, or at least MISLEADING.  They tell you to
	poke a value in a particular address -- say, $FFC0 -- when it's
	almost always faster to poke a different address.  I'm not saying
	that Commodore is keeping things secret from us; rather, they don't
	realize the power of their own machine.  I mean, did you know that
	if you apply exactly 935.778 volts onto pin 5 of the serial port,
	the VBSTOP and SPR0PTH registers exchange their data, and standing
	waves are produced in the joystick cable?  Do you think this kind
	of crap is documented in the manual?  Forget it!

Dan:	Yow... how the heck do you discover things like that??

Bobby:	Well, Dan, I don't want to brag or anything, but this kind of
	stuff is child's play for people who have been in the business
	as long as I have.  I mean, I discovered that particular trick
	years ago.  It was obvious from the way the Amiga is constructed.
	I mean... look at the outer casing.  Lick the CIA chips.  You can
	just FEEL this stuff.  You know?

Dan:	What do you think about the AGA chipset?  Are you impressed?

Bobby:	Yeah, they're great!  It's the coolest chipset on the planet!
	Especially all the hidden modes.

Dan:	Hidden modes?

Bobby:	Yeah, hidden modes.

	[silence]

Dan:	I, uh, take it you're not going to tell our readers about the hidden
	modes.

Bobby:	You're a smart guy.

Dan:	OK, next topic.  Is it true that assembly language is faster than
	C, in general?

Bobby:	I'm not going to answer that because the whole argument is pointless.
	BOTH languages are DEAD SLOW as far as I'm concerned.  It's like
	the choice between a dead snail and a snail that's merely maimed.
	Back at	Rancho Destructo [the programmers' nickname for the basement
	of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's headquarters] we have created our own
	specialized languages for the ULTIMATE in speed.  We now have
	languages so efficient that we can get several hundred instructions
	executing in the same time as *one* assembly language instruction.

Dan:	That's pretty impressive.

Bobby:	Yeah, well, some professor guy from a nearby university didn't
	believe us about it and wanted to see our implementation.  We
	referred him to BLAZEMONGER "Customer Service" and he stopped
	calling.

Dan:	Do you have any advice for up-and-coming programmers who want
	to be just like you?

Bobby:	Sure.  First, try EVERYTHING.  I mean EVERYTHING.  Make a program
	that writes every conceivable combination of values into all of
	memory, and watch what happens.  Connect your ports to your other
	ports.  Rip the computer apart and put it back together backwards.
	Insert unusual objects into the disk drive.  This is the ONLY way
	to get to know your machine... and you've GOT to know it INSIDE
	AND OUT before you write ANYTHING non-trivial.

	Second, no matter how busy you are, spend a lot of time daydreaming.
	You can think about anything:  sex, video games, sexy video games,
	chainsaws, nuclear explosions, funerals, knitting needles stuck
	into your eyeballs, headless goats, or whatever.  Anything!  The
	important thing is to KEEP YOUR IMAGINATION ACTIVE so you stay
	creative.

	And third:  work as a fashion model for a few years.  Modeling
	opens up ideas and worlds that you would otherwise never know
	existed.  I don't think I could have written BLAZEMONGER's low-level
	monster scheduling routines without a firm background in men's
	undergarments.

Dan:	Bobby, thanks for your time.

Bobby:	Blaze on, dood.

	There it is, directly from the source... our own Bobby Blazebleeder
and his thoughts on programming excellence.  I hope you enjoyed the
interview and learned something from it.  I know I sure did:  to stand
farther back when interviewing a psychotic superhacker!
