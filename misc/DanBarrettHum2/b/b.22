	I'm happy to announce that BLAZEMONGER has *exactly* the scene
Eric describes above.  Unlike 99.9% of the computer games on the market
today, BLAZEMONGER is COMPLETELY non-gender-biased.  We have male
monsters, female monsters, NEUTERED monsters, HERMAPHRODITE monsters,
TWO-HEADED monsters in ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS, and giant, DROOLING,
CARNIVOROUS, DISEMBODIED GENITALS that chase your character RELENTLESSLY
from SCREEN TO SCREEN!!!!

	In addition, the user is free to choose between "hero" characters of
all sexes, heights, weights, SPECIES, and POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS.  Want
to see Ross Perot MESSILY DEVOURED by ANIMATED MUTANT TOILET PLUNGERS??
This is the GAME FOR YOU!!

	Now, some of you are probably wondering where Eric's "man in a
G-string" scene appears in BLAZEMONGER, not to mention what the HECK it's
DOING there.  <SPOILER ALERT!!>  On level 74,209, just before you dive naked
down the giant sandpaper slide (oooeeee, that hurts!!), pull the 64th metal
lever.  A pit opens up below you, and you fall into a rather
ordinary-looking New York office building.  This is where "Mr. G-String" and
his female boss attack you with bent paper clips and poison white-out.
("Tipex" for you Europeans. :-))  SHE has a Ph.D. in Management Science from
Harvard; HE bought HIS graduation diploma by MAIL ORDER.  (Look closely at
the lettering, and you'll see his degree is in "Body Lint Construction.")

	Watch in 1993 for "BLAZEMONGER: THE POLITICALLY CORRECT VERSION",
in which we feed babies and televangelists to rabid weasels.

                                                        Dan
