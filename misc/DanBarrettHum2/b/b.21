	Due to massive public demand, BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is proud
to present the all-new FAMILY-VALUES EDITION of BLAZEMONGER.

	"BLAZEMONGER, THE FAMILY-VALUES EDITION" sports the Good Gamekeeping
Seal of Approval and contains none of the swear words, vulgarities,
innuendos, disembowelings, amputations, nude pygmies, rabid housepets,
enormous genitals, and other RUDE and DIRTY objects that you have come to
love and expect in the original BLAZEMONGER.

	"BLAZEMONGER, THE FAMILY-VALUES EDITION" is now shitting, um, I mean
SHIPPING.... oops!  (Sorry about that, FV-fans!)  Butt you can breast assured
that no such errors will crap up in the program disk!

                                                        Dan
