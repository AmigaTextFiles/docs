		     THE  BLAZEMONGER  APPLICATION  LIST
		       (for Commodore Amiga computers)

		   Maintained by BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's

INTRODUCTION

	This is a list of third-party products for the Commodore Amiga that
have direct support for communicating with BLAZEMONGER, the FASTEST and MOST
AWESOME computer game ever invented!!  Using these programs, you can
interact with BLAZEMONGER in ways that you never dreamed possible.  New
MONSTERS!  New CAPABILITIES!  New PERSONAL INJURY!  It gets better and
better.

	Of course, REAL BLAZEMONGER PLAYERS don't NEED any STUPID interface
programs.  They can make BLAZEMONGER do WHATEVER THEY WANT almost
EFFORTLESSLY.  But for the REST of you DWEEBS, here are your CRUTCHES.

	The BLAZEMONGER Application List is *not* to be considered commercial
advertising for BLAZEMONGER.  We provide this information as a public service
for the billions of registered BLAZEMONGER users on USENET.  So when you see
the game described as INCREDIBLE, AMAZING, MIND-BLOWING, and all for the
low, low price of just $9.95 (US), you can rest assured that these are
simply FACTS and not marketing hype.

	If you have never heard of BLAZEMONGER before, you may safely 
skip the rest of this article.  In fact, don't even read the stuff above.
Hell, you might as well just go home for the day and play whatever INFERIOR,
WIMPO GAMES on which you are wasting your precious life.
