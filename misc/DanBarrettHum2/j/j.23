	By now, everybody has heard of Commodore US's "4000 Reasons"
contest.  Everyone is invited to describe, in 25 words or less, why
he/she/it owns an Amiga, and 1 lucky person will win a free A4000!
(Personally, I don't see how anybody can list 4000 reasons in only 25 words,
but I never was much of a math whiz.)

	Anyway, thanks to SECRET ESPIONAGE TACTICS, I have been able to tap
into Commodore's private files and discover who's going to win!  Thus,
BLAZEMONGER INCORPOATED loudly presents:

			The Top Ten Entries In The
			 "4000 Reasons" Contest!!

In 25 words or less, MY REASON FOR OWNING AN AMIGA IS...

(10)	What's an "Omega?"

(9)	...because it's great.  I love it!  It's really great!  The best!  I
	don't know a greater computer; the Amiga is totally, totally great!
	No, really!

(8)	...multitasking!  I need a computer that can do raytracing in the
	background.  I don't *want* to run a raytracer, but my friends say
	it's required.

(7)	...because the Atari Falcon is too expensive.

(6)	...I am attempting singlehandedly to drive IBM and Apple out
	of business by spending my money elsewhere.

(5)	Packed with processors, Amiga really satisfies.  It's not just for
	hacking anymore.  It's the real thing.  Amiga is it.  The Computer
	for the Cremated Mind! (TM)

(4)	...because Commodore is doomed.  If they don't have at least a 23.7%
	increase in R&D, their rumored 32-bit graphics chipset will never be
	competitive with
	[this entry was cut off after 25 words]

(3)	...so I can read comp.sys.amiga.advocacy and feel qualified to
	point out the logical flaws in other people's arguments.
	Politely, of course.  Not!

(2)	...it brings in the babes, man.  Thousands of them, like, flocking
	to my monitor.  I just type "sys:utilities/Display Girlz/#?" and,
	like, there they are.  Ahhhhhh....


And the number 1 reason is...!

(1)	...because BLAZEMONGER runs on it, of COURSE!  All those other
	PSEUDO-TRASH MACHINES cannot APPROACH the MIND-BLOWING GRAPHICS and
	EARDRUM-PIERCING SOUND BOLTS that EXPLODE from the Amiga, SHATTERING
	nearby CONCRETE WALLS and DESTROYING all DECIBEL WORLD RECORDS.  And
	BLAZEMONGER CANNOT be restricted by any WIMPY 25-word limit, EITHER!

                                                        Dan
