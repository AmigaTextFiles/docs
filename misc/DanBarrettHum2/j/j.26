	There has been a lot of confusion recently about the A4000, the AGA
chipset, and interlaced (flickering) graphics.  Don't worry -- help is
here!  The whole issue is really VERY SIMPLE, so I've decided to explain it
all very simply, using very simple words, for all you very simple people.
Simple, simple, simple.  OK?  So pay attention, you morons.

	In the beginning, there was the original graphics chipset.  It
consisted of 3 chips, called Agnostic, Dense, and Polio.  Agnostic and Dense
handled the graphics.  Unfortunately, Agnostic was always doubting whether
or not it was doing the right thing, so it would occasionally get into
terrible arguments with Dense.  As a result, the video display would
"flicker" as the two chips fought it out.

	To help prevent this problem, two solutions appeared.  The first was
the MicroWay flickerFixer, a device that plugged into the A2000 video
expansion slot.  It eliminated flicker by sending huge, electronic
shockwaves into the custom chips, frying Agnostic and Dense until they were
forced to agree and produce a stable picture.  This method of causing pain
in electronic components is known as the "Hurt" system, and you will usually
see a "Hurts" rating in the specifications of any display hardware.  It is a
measure of the amount of pain required to force the hardware to do what you
want.  If the hardware is particularly nasty, it needs a pain rating way up
in the "Kill-Or-Hurt" range.  But I digress.

	The second solution was that Commodore introduced the Enhanced Chip
Set, or "ECS".  This new chipset improved upon the original in numerous
ways, including the ability to produce high-resolution, non-interlaced
graphics.  In order to do this, they had to ridicule the poor graphics
chips, calling them insulting names like "Fat Agnostic" and
"Only-Half-Bright Dense", until they agreed to work harder.

	Unfortunately, even Commodore's feared Department of Punishing
Custom Chips could not force the little ECS to produce the graphics that
some Amiga users were demanding.  So, it was time to create a whole new
chipset!  One that could display 8-bit graphics, an enhanced HAM mode, and
satisfy Amiga users everywhere!  YES!!  It's... THE AA CHIPSET!!!!

	[Excuse me?  Oh!  I'll tell them.]

	Um, the name is now officially the "AGA" (Advanced Graphic
Architecture) chipset.  Sorry about that!

	Anyway, the AGA chipset had the capabilities of... [What?  Oh....]
Sorry folks, but Commodore has just renamed the chipset again!  It is now
called the "RAGA" (Really Advanced Graphic Architecture) chipset.

	So where was I... oh yes.  The RAGA chipset... [What NOW?  Oh, you
are kidding me.]  Folks, you won't believe it, but Commodore has just
changed the name of the chipset.  The new and final name is the "AGAIN"
chipset (Advanced Graphic Architecture, Infinite Names), or "AGA" for
short.  I'm glad we finally have that clear.

	Well, by now, I don't remember at ALL what I was talking about,
so I'll switch topics to the Amiga 4000 and flickering graphics.  Here
is where the confusion lies.  Or maybe I should say, "Here is where we
find confusion and lies."  Here are some of the current rumors:

RUMOR					IS IT TRUE?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The A4000 has no flicker fixer.		YES

The AGA chipset always "promotes" any
non-interlaced screen to interlaced
mode.					MAYBE

The A4000 has no flicker fixer.		NO

in an Ethopian "love nest" with 35
rabid opossums and a jar of 
mayonnaise.				E-MAIL Mr-X@blackmail.com FOR PHOTOS


But rumors, as the saying goes, are "just rumors."  Here are the VERY SIMPLE
FACTS about interlaced video on the Amiga 4000.  The following eleven steps
will explain the TRUTH and tell you how to combat ANY video problem on this
machine.

(1)	First of all, on the A4000, ALL video modes flicker.  Yes, ALL of
	them -- every single one.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is
	either lying or a total dweeb.

(2)	However, Commodore's system software "promotes" these modes to be
	non-interlaced, so you don't see the flickering.  Yay!!

(3)	Even so, a program can SPECIFICALLY ASK to flicker, by calling
	the new OS 3.0 PleaseFlicker() function.  This is the system
	friendly way to force an interlaced screen for video compatibility.

(4)	But the user can easily override the PleaseFlicker() function by
	using the IControl program and selecting the "Please Don't Flicker"
	gadget.

(5)	However, even if the user has used IControl to eliminate flicker,
	there still exists ANOTHER system function buried deep in the
	heart of the operating system.  It is called ReallyFlickerAnyway()
	and it LAUGHS at the user's puny attempts to deinterlace the screen.
	This function exists not for "video compatibility", but	simply to
	make life miserable for everyone.

	NOTE:  Developers should NEVER use the ReallyFlickerAnyway()
	function unless they ABSOLUTELY MUST or if they just feel like it.

(6)	Happily, users can STILL get around the deadly ReallyFlickerAnyway()
	function by running any of the 3,857,294 freely distributable
	anti-flicker programs, such as Marc Barrett's "FlickerSucks"
	utility.  These little programs "patch" the operating system to
	detect flickering screens and take an appropriate action.  For
	example, whenever Marc's program notices that a "bad" screen will
	be opened, it cleverly displays a gigantic requester complaining
	about the flicker. (Curiously, the program doesn't FIX the screen
	-- it just complains.)
	
	In any case, there are other utilities around if Marc's doesn't fit
	your needs.

(7)	Unfortunately, Marc has a split personality, and his evil twin
	wrote an awful program called "The_A4000_Is_A_Kludge", which
	defeats those nice flicker-fixing utilities mentioned in step (6).
	Oh no!!  And to make things worse, Marc somehow managed to get
	this program onto the A4000 Install disk so it automatically runs
	on every A4000 shipped!
	
	But don't panic -- just delete the program (it's in the WBStartup
	drawer) and your worries will go away.

(8)	But even now, some programs break the programming rules, bypass the
	Amiga operating system, and go straight to the hardware, stuffing
	values directly into the GR_FLKR register and causing the fatal
	flicker.  Once again, your little anti-flicker utilities can't help.

(9)	To solve the problem of these hardware-banging programs, simply buy
	a Commodore A2320 or other deinterlacer and install it in the A4000
	processor slot or joystick port or wherever the hell it goes.  Now,
	even those illegally-programmed games and demos will look wonderful.

(10)	However, some A4000 video modes have too many bitplanes to work with
	the A2320, so these can't be deinterlaced so easily.  Oh no!  Can
	anything be done about this??

(11)	Don't worry!  As stated above, Commodore's system software promotes
	these modes to be non-interlaced.  Go to step (3).

	So, there you have the complete information!  These steps should
explain EVERYTHING you need to know about the Amiga 4000 and flickering
screens.  If you have any further questions, please post them in alt.flicker
or rec.arts.birdpoop because you are obviously very stupid, and even I
can't help you.
