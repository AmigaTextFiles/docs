Subject: Are you looking for Amiga pirate ftp sites?  Read this!

	Earlier this week, somebody posted in comp.sys.amiga.games and asked
if there are any ftp sites where pirated, commercial Amiga software can be
obtained.  Hmmm.  In response, I posted a description of the pirate FTP site
"etarip.uoy.ffo.kcuf" which I said contained commercial games.

	Now, everybody take a CAREFUL look at the name of that ftp site.
Does it look... perhaps... suspicious?  I thought so, but obviously some
people didn't look closely.  I was sure that the domain name "kcuf" was
unusual enough to attract attention, and that people would read the hostname
backwards and realize that this was a joke.  But NOOOOOO... people believed
it!!

	I would like to thank all the pirates who wrote to me and asked for
more information, especially those who said "I can't seem to contact this
machine -- my computer says 'unknown host.' Can you help?"  Thanks for a
good laugh, folks!  I can't believe you took this seriously.  I mean, one
guy DID read the hostname backwards, said "Hey, that's cute", but STILL
asked me for the IP number of the machine so he could connect to it!!

	OK folks... when you post a question about illegal activities, and
somebody answers by saying:

	(1)  There is a machine whose name backwards spells out "fuck off
	     you pirate"; AND,

	(2)  You have to log in using the name "DAEHKCID" (read it
	     backwards); AND,

	(3)  He claims that the machine is run by a group called
	     "Software Crackers United METHODISTS" (yeah, right); AND,

	(4)  Information can be found in a file called "README.SCUM"; AND,

	(5)  The poster is widely known for his jokes in c.s.a.advocacy,

then you MIGHT want to think for a minute before believing it. :-)

	Sheesh.  There are no limits to human stupidity, but I wanted to see
how far these people would go.  So to everyone who wrote for "more
information", here is what I sent them:

They wrote:
>[Help, I cannot reach the machine, etc.]

I responded:
|	That's strange.  My computer has no problem at all reaching it.
|(See Below.)  I'm afraid I don't know the IP number, so I suggest you send
|e-mail to your systems administrator asking specifically about the machine
|etarip.uoy.ffo.kcuf.  He/she has probably heard of it; it's pretty famous on
|the Internet.

	Some of the pirates believed this reply, too!  They wrote back for
help when they STILL couldn't reach the machine!  So for these people, I
told them that the IP number was 12.84.987.16 (or something similar) which
is an illegal Internet address.  But "etarip.uoy.ffo.kcuf" has illegal
software on it, so it's only fair. :-)  I'm sure these people tried it
anyway, got "network is unreachable" error messages, and wondered what the
problem was.  Heh.

	Anyway, to teach these people a lesson, I have reported all of their
names and e-mail addresses to the anti-piracy organization, the Software
Publisher's Association ("SPA") at 800-388-PIR8.

	WAIT, before you flame me.  The previous sentence is a JOKE.  I DID
NOT report anybody to the SPA.  I am KIDDING.  But I wanted to give these
pirates a little scare and teach them three things:

	o	USENET is not the place to ask about "pirate ftp sites."
	o	Don't believe stories like mine so easily!
	o	Admitting you are a pirate to a total stranger might be a
		bad idea.

Followups are directed to comp.sys.amiga.advocacy, since this has nothing
to do with games.  Please respect the "Followup-To" line.

                                                        Dan
