Subject: Pirate ftp site explodes... film at eleven
Date: 14 Oct 92 23:26:01 GMT


	I have some bad news for all you pirates out there.  The famous
pirate ftp site "etarip.uoy.ffo.kcuf" suffered a massive explosion last
week.  It seems that over eleven million Internet users tried to log in
simultaneously, using the formerly-secret "DAEHKCID" username.  This
seriously overloaded the incoming telnet modem pool, and the rest is history.
The disk drive was seriously ruptured, shattering the /pub/games/commercial
directory into "/pub", "games/comm", and "ercial" directories... a classic
case of disk fragmentation.  In addition, the fried network connections were
responsible for the big News blackout that many sites experienced over the
weekend, as USENET postings reached "etarip" and fell out of the broken
Ethernet cable onto the floor.  Cleaning crews have only recently finished
stuffing those articles back into the cables and sending them on their way.

	Since I am the person who announced the existence of this site to
the world, I feel partially responsible for this loss to the well-respected
Amiga pirate community.  I would also like to apologize to everyone in
c.s.a.games for all the people who posted false, misleading followups to my
article and claimed it was a joke.  It was a totally serious article, and I
am shocked that all those stupid people thought it was funny.  Get a life,
folks!  The destruction of an Internet site is no laughing matter.

	Anyway, to make up for my mistakes, I have contacted the systems
administrators of several other machines who have agreed to take over
etarip.uoy.ffo.kcuf's job.  You can find the files on the following sites:

		siht.eveileb.uoy.fi		(Finland)
		bmud.yrev.era.uoy		(Uruguay)
		eb.dluohs.setarip.lla		(Llamaland)
		erunam.esroh.ni.deppid		(Middle Earth)

If you try to reach these and your computer says "unknown host", keep
trying.  I advise that you try at least 4 times an hour for several
weeks.  Yes, this is hard work, but the rewards will be great.

	For people without ftp access, it is now also possible to receive
this pirated software on disk.  I think you'll be impressed:  the disk even
comes with documentation and the original packaging!  Simply pick up the
telephone and call any Amiga dealer or mailorder warehouse, ask for any
Amiga program, and it will be sent to you for free!  You don't even have to
ask for the special "pirated" version -- the person on the phone will know
what you want.

	Beware, though... even though the software is free, some of these
places will charge you outrageous shipping fees.  For example, when I
ordered my free copy of Deluxe Paint IV, they charged me $99.50 for
"handling"!  But at least I got the program for free.

	[Followups to c.s.a.advocacy since it's such a fun place.]

                                                        Dan
