INTRODUCTION

	By popular demand, here is a collection of humorous articles about
the Commodore Amiga that I wrote and posted in the USENET comp.sys.amiga
newsgroups during 1992.  These continue the subjects found in my first
compilation, DanBarrettHumor.lzh.  I recommend that you get the original
before you read these articles.

	The articles in the "b" subdirectory are about BLAZEMONGER, the
fastest and most amazing computer game ever created.  The articles in the
"j" ("joke") subdirectory are about other important Amiga topics that were
discussed on USENET. :-)

	Have fun... and BLAZE ON, DOODZ!!


*** WARNING ***

	These articles have been declared officially "hazardous" by the
	Dental Pain Fan Club of Chickenmilk, Wisconsin.  They have been
	known to melt holes in concrete at a distance of 100 meters.  If you
	must read them, it is recommended that you close your eyes, or at
	least wear dark glasses, and maybe a funny hat.  You have been
	warned!!
