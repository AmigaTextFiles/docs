.RZ "BABKA Z RODZYNKAMI" "Baba with raisins"
Easter is one of the happiest days of the year in Poland.  The Poles have 
strictly observed the forty-day penitential season of Lent and by the time
Easter comes they are more than ready for a feast.   On Good Friday night
hard-cooked eggs have been coloured and decorated with traditional designs;
on Easter Saturday baskets filled with salt, hard-cooked eggs, butter, and 
other foods have been brought to the church for the priest to bless.  The
feasting begins with the favorite breakfast of the year, called Swiecone.
Then the table is set with the best family linen and decorated with branches
of pussy willow and garlands of green leaves.  Set in the center is the
Paschal lamb, made of sugar or butter or, at times, baba dough. 
.PP
Then the buffet is laid out.  Succulent cold meats\(emroast beef, baked ham,
sausage, roast veal, roast turkey, roast goose\(emsurround the highlight of
the feast: a roast suckling pig. 
.PP
The meats are supported by hard-cooked eggs, sauces, and relishes, especially
the traditional Easter relish of beets and horseradish called in Polish
cwikla.
.PP
Pastries and sweets are also included on the Easter table, with special rich
babas and a cheese cake with raisins always featured.  Then, as a final,
glorious touch, honey-flavoured, spiced vodka (krupnik) and other sweet
liqueurs are served.
.PP
As might be expected, there is quite a bit of meat left over from the Easter
buffet.  This is easily taken care of on Easter Monday in a very good
sew called bigos.
