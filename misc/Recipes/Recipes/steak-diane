.RZ "STEAK DIANE" "Steak in chive sauce"
This is from Pierre Franey's 
. 60-Minute Gourmet,
one of the two or three cookbooks I use the most.
This recipe is not for people who think that well-done steak is edible.

.PH
.SK 1
Pound the steaks (try using the bottom of your cast-iron skillet)
until they're about
.AB "\(14 inch" "\(12 cm"
thick.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, to taste.
.SK 2
Heat a large, preferably cast-iron, skillet over high heat.  When
very hot, add the olive oil and some butter.
.SK 3
Add two of the steaks, cooking 90 seconds on one side and 30 seconds
on the other.  Do not overcook!  Transfer the two steaks to a platter
and cook the other two the same way.
.SK 4
Remove pan from heat, add the chives, return to heat, and cook 10 seconds.
.SK 5
Add, while stirring, the
cognac, parsley, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce, and broth.
.SK 6
Stir in the remaining butter.
.SK 7
Sprinkle steaks with pepper to taste, and cover them with the sauce.
Serve immediately.
.NX
You can use boneless sirloin instead of the filet mignon.
.PP
If you cook fewer or smaller steaks, don't reduce the quantities for
the sauce ingredients, since it's hard to keep the sauce from burning
if there isn't enough of it.
.SH RATING
