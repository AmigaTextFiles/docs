.RZ "SWEET POTATO SOUP" "Mushroom cheese sweet potato soup"
Here is a recipe for sweet potato soup.  It is very good and very
filling.  I adapted it from a recipe in
.I
The Blue Strawberry Cookbook.
(I deleted some ingredients and figured out the 
right proportions, since the original recipe contained no
measurements.)
.PP
This is an excellent Sunday supper recipe for two people who can't
quite finish a bottle of wine.  It can safely be served to people
who do not care for the texture of sweet potato.

.PH
.SK 1
Preheat broiler.
Peel the sweet potatoes and slice them as thinly as you can manage.
Slice the leeks.
.SK 2
Fry the potatoes and leeks in the butter until both are cooked. If
multiplying the recipe for additional people, do this in small batches.
.SK 3
Puree the potato and leeks with the chardonnay.
.SK 4
Put the potato mixture into a soup pot.  Add milk until it is thin enough to
be called soup, instead of a vegetable puree.
Add the mushrooms.  Cook until the mushrooms are done, about 15 minutes.
.SK 5
Ladle the soup into large oven-proof soup bowls.  Place slices of 
cheese on top of soup.  Broil until cheese is melted and bubbling.  
.SK 6
Serve with fresh bread, green salad, and chardonnay.
.SH RATING
.I Difficulty:
easy.
.I Time:
30 to 60 minutes, depending on how thinly you slice the potato (thinner
slices cook faster).
.I Precision:
Approximate measurement OK.
