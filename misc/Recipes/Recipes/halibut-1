.RZ "GRILLED HALIBUT NICOISE" "Marinated grilled halibut in the Provence style"
My favorite style of cooking is that of Provence, in the south of France.
Recently we had a "cooking of Provence" party at which we 
devised this recipe from our combined memories of fish restaurants in Nice.
The French would grill it over dried rosemary branches; we used charcoal
with mesquite chips.

It is important to use fresh lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil in the
marinade for authentic flavor. 
.PP
This recipe is nice to try if
you have a lot of tarragon growing.
We had a really vigorous early crop
this year.  My Dad's trick for wintering it over
works in New England window boxes as well.  (We just
covered the plant with about five inches of newspaper
wrapped in a trash bag.)
