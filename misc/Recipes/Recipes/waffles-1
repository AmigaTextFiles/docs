.SK 2
Separate the eggs; beat whites until stiff. Set aside.
Mix milk, egg yolks, yogurt, and oil; beat well.
.SK 3
In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients; blend well.
.SK 4
Mix dry ingredients into wet, stir once or twice.

Beat the mixture until it is uniform. The less you beat the better the
texture of the waffles will be.

Measure batter for each waffle. Cook 5 minutes, or until done. 
.NX
When cooking these for children, I leave the sugar out and fold in colored
candy sprinkles that are sold for decorating cookies and cakes. They dissolve
during the cooking and leave little colored bursts in the otherwise-white
waffle.
.PP
Learn the cooking time for your waffle iron and then write it down. Mine is 5
minutes and 30 seconds for each waffle.
.PP
Substitute buckwheat flour for up to half of the flour for a richer, darker
waffle.
