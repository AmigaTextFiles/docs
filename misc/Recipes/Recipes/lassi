.RZ "LASSI" "Indian yoghurt drink"
This is a recipe I got from my brother-in-law,
who got it from an Indian friend of his.
It is a perfect cool drink to have with those hot
Indian curries, and delicious by itself too!

Rosewater essence is not something easily picked off a supermarket shelf.
We get ours from the Chemist (Pharmacist); they use it to flavour
their Mixtures. One bottle lasts a long time.
If you like Turkish Delight, one uses it for that, too.
