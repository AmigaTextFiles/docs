.SK 1
Wash fish fillets and cut into pieces.
.SK 2
Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Fry onion, garlic, and
mint, stirring until the onions turn soft and golden.
.SK 3
Add cumin, turmeric, and chili powder.  Stir until well-mixed and cook for a
few minutes.
.SK 4
Add tomatoes, salt, and garam masala.  Fry until the tomatoes are cooked to
a pulp.
.SK 5           
Turn heat to low.  Add fish and lemon juice.  Spoon sauce over the fish and
let simmer 10 minutes.  Stir carefully during this period to avoid breaking
up the fish.
.SK 6
Serve over rice.
.NX
Don't use a delicate fish.  Not only will it break up in cooking, but the
flavor of the sauce will be too overpowering.
.PP
The chili powder referred to in this recipe is Asian chili powder.  For a
milder taste, something like a U.S. pasilla chili powder can be used.
