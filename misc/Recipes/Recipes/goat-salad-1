.RZ "GOAT-SALAD" "A delicious goat cheese salad"
This salad is slightly expensive to make (pricey materials),
but it is a very nice, tasty salad to start off a dinner.
It is also very decorative, especially if you use a bright
green lettuce.
I patched it together out of several "nouveau cuisine" 
cookbooks, with a fair amount of ad-libbing.
It is both pretty to look at and really delicious,
especially if you are a goat cheese fanatic.

.SK 1
Marinate goat cheese rounds in mixture of oil, thyme, sage, oregano,
cumin & what ever else you enjoy. Let cheese soak for at least 
half an hour.
.SK 2
For each serving, layout 3 or 4 beautiful green lettuce leaves, and
half a sliced mushroom.
.SK 3
Prepare marinated goat cheese by covering bread crumbs and baking at
.TE 350 175
until slightly melted (about 7 minutes).
.SK 4
Saut\z\(aae pine nuts in walnut oil until golden brown (about 4\-5 minutes.)
Remove nuts from oil.  Do not pour out the oil. Let it cool.
.SK 5
Arrange lettuce, half sliced mushroom, and goat cheese nicely on each
serving plate.
Add 2 Tbsp toasted pine nuts.  Garnish with sliced sun-dried
tomato.  The color contrasts should be especially nice between the
bright green lettuce and red sun dried tomato.
.SK 6
Prepare dressing by adding raspberry vinegar to the cooled walnut oil.
Add sugar, salt, and pepper to taste.  Spoon 3\-4 spoons of this
dressing over each salad. Serve.
.NX
Modify the marinating spice mixture to suit your own tastes and supplies.
.PP
Use any type of goat cheese that comes in a round shape.  A common
good one is Montrachet (with or without ash).  I use one
made in Vermont, called "Vermont Chevre"
.PP
Mushrooms can be of any large variety, but they must be fresh.
.PP
I find that the hydroponic lettuce available where I live
is best for this, but any leafy green will do.
