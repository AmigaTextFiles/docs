Telnet? Well.. when two programs on the internet decide to communicate with
each other, they make a connection. They can then send and recieve
characters. A web browser for example will connect to the web server, where
another program (whose only purpose is to wait for a connection) will answer.
Your web browser sends some characters that, rather complexly, mean something
like "load index.html and give me the result". The two programs can thus
communicate with complex transfer protocols.

But if all you want to transfer IS characters, you don't need any protocol.
How about a program that displays all characters it recieves on the screen,
and that sends all characters you enter at the keyboard? That's what a Telnet
client does. You can use it to e.g. remote login to a unix computer, play
text based adventure games, chat 1-to-1 or whatever.

You can get one at aminet, just search for telnet.

Oh, and congratulations to a great choice of computer! I hope/suppose you
will find nothing but friends among us other amiga users!

The wads I am trying were made for Doom2.  They are not actually real
Wolfenstein wads.  When I find the website again I'll send it along to the
list to see if anyone else has tried these.  I did get one to work sort of. 
It worked for about two or three minute and then is froze.  I'll have to try
some others.

I am using Adoom 1.2 with a registered Doom2 wad.

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga 2 PC

From: Loki <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello,

   Does anybody know a way I can copy some files to the PC that
are bigger than 720K? A program to split and join, or a backup
program that works? (Like PCBackup) Or maybe something like
the SpanDisks option in ZIP?

I just wanna try out some Emulators :)

Thanks!

Cya,..

    I recommend hooking your Amiga and PC together with a null modem cable and
using PC2Amiga.  It allows you to access any directory on the PC as if it were
an Amiga directory.  Find it on Aminet as comm/misc/PC2Am308.lha.

Thanks.  You remembered the correct level.  Guess this will give me
something to mess aorund with until I get the other wads sorted out.

In case you or anyone else is interested here is the web site that I got the
Wolfenstein (for Doom2) wads from.

Welcom. I am known as the "list technical idiot" on another Amiga mailing 
list - Pure Amiga - so let me try to explain this to you in my own simple-
minded way. 

When you go on the internet, you use a program to log onto another computer 
- your internet service provider, or ISP. Then you use a browser to go onto 
the internet. Before the popularity of the internet, there used to be a lot 
of computer bulletin boards - or BBS's -(there still are a few, but they are 
not as popular now). To access a BBS, you would use a program called a 
"dial-up" program that would connect you by phone to the computer that the 
BBS was on. If the BBS was not local, you would have to pay for the long 
distance phone call.

A "telnet" progam allows you to go directly into another computer. If the
other computer is a BBS, you are going directly there without the long
distance phone charge as you can go through your ISP. You can, if your ISP
allows it, log on to a friend's ISP and then telnet to your ISP. I do this 
when I stay with my father in Texas. I log onto his ISP then telnet to 
mine to read my e-mail. This is because my ISP has no phone numbers in 
Texas and I save the long distance phone charge by having his ISP, in 
effect, call my ISP.

IF you work for a company that has a computer and you want to work from 
home, it may be possible to telnet into the computer at work. You can
also do this with some computers at universities or libraries. It can be 
set up so that you are actually logged onto another computer thousands
of miles away from your own home computer. My husband used to telnet into 
the mainframe computer his company had across the country and write 
programs for it from home. Hundreds of programmers could all be telnetting
into this computer at once.

This is not something MANY computer users know about. I would venture
to say that your average person on the Web today has never even heard
of a telnet program, so it may not be something that you really need 
to know about.

What  was it that you were trying to do that you thought a telnet 
program would do for you?

Hildy

Hi Everybody,

   Zip them first.

   Split them with MUIjoin. (on aminet)


   This should create a load of files called

FILENAME.JAA
FILENAME.JAB
FILENAME.JAC
FILENAME.JAD
FILENAME.JAE

etc.


Make sure you copy them in the right order to the pc


then goto the directory on the PC where you copied them and type into
MS-DOS 

COPY FILENAME.*/B FILENAME.ZIP

it should then print out:

FILENAME.JAA
FILENAME.JAB
FILENAME.JAC
FILENAME.JAD
FILENAME.JAE

Opperation sucsessful.

if it does the filenames in the wrong order and/or PKunzip won't unzip
it, you have to do

COPY FILENAME.JAA/B&FILENAME.JAB/B&FILENAME.JAC/B FILENAME.ZIP
      etc.
   
   (don't quote me on that last one though)



See ya.

I used to run a BBS :)

And what do you mean, `There still are a */few/*'? There are litterally
1000s!! You just gotta look for them, ever seen a Fido Node-List?
Granted, there are probably only about 10% of what there used to be,
but there are still lots about :))), and I still log-onto some from time
to time to chat with the SysOps' :)

If you want to try out TelNet, get a hold of AmTelNet which was with
the Lite version of NetConnect2 (There`s probably a demo on AmiNet, maybe)
which was on CUCD26. Then open your browser, point it to altavista
(www.altavista.com) and just search `TelNet'.. If you have the Lite/Full
version of NetConnect2 installed you will be presented with a set of
links that when clicked on will automatically fire-up AmTelNet for you,
and start the login procedure :) If you dont have the full instalation,
It can be setup in all the Amiga Browsers to automatically load AmTelNet.
But you could just get the Location and import it to AmTelNet manually :)

I dont think anybody else has said anything about getting onto a TelNet
sites on the Amiga, have they?

H>> This is not something MANY computer users know about. I would venture

Erm, I can tell you *al*l the people I used (still do) know from
my BBS`in days know about TelNet, 1 person I know was actually going
to set one up :) But I agree, not that many pll know a lot about TelNet
and that definalty includes *me*, ehehehehe :)

   I belive that DoomII actually has 2 secret levels in Wolfenstein
style (level 31&2 I think)

Use 'IDCLEV31' etc.(dont quote me on that cheat though, havn't played it
for ages!)   As for the fact that these custom wads crash, well, um, I
have no idea. I'd email the author if I was you.

YAM 1.3.4 is the one I have which is good, YAM 1.3.5 is the new one
which seems the same. Niether will filter.
 It seems most likely to me that I'm doing it wrong.

All I do is goto 'config' and select the filter part. I create
a new filtering 'trick' with name and pattern, tell it to delete
it if it's in the subject and then from main yam I click 'filter'.
 No go.

 It's a pest alright.

internal? on a 1200? you can't. Where would you put it? do you see anywhere
that it would fit? You have 2 options. 

External : you can either buy a pcmia slot one (hole on the left) or buy a
scsi interface and then add one. this will be faster and give you a scsi
chain. the surfsquirrle will also give you a faster serial port.

internal: put your 1200 in a tower, like me. this way you can add loads
more, cd drives, zips, more harddrives and it looks neater

> (2) Where does an external CD ROM plug into an A1200? 

in the pcmia slot, on the left. or if the 1200 is in a tower, it can go onto
the ide socket (like your harddrive)

buy the latest amiga format magazine and have a look

www.powerc.com (or may be .co.uk ?)
www.eyetech.co.uk

I too would like to know

If you are new to computers, you do not want to be playing with telnet.

it is a piece of software which allows you to connect to bbs (bulliten board
systems) these are pretty old, and there are not many left now.

It only shows up when you have a certain number of emails (usually about
60). You might also find different accounts go to different POP3 servers.

Ok.

> What is it?

Telnet allow you to use a remote server as if you are
really on the keyboard of this computer (but you aren't).

> Where and how to I get it?

You can use a program like AmTelnet 1.3.
It's available a shareware version on the Vaporware site at the
URL http://www.vapor.com

> How do I use it?

You insert the domain where you want to connect, and the port
that you want to use.

Noooo. That's wrong. BBSs is only _one_ thing you can do with telnet, you can
play on MUDs, remote login to unix-like (and many more) systems, use archie,
query internic, send (fake) email, read email (if you have a shell account
somewhere) etc. etc. etc.

If the ISP theory is true then why do I have a problem with release 6 and my
brother who is using the same internet provider and mail server (although a
different account) has no problem with it?

yeah, filtering happens offline, after the download is complete. unless you
mean the type where it happens server side, like spam filtering etc.

that works on freeserve :)

I downloaded the "Second Encounter" .WAD; it works for me.  I use the
latest version of DoomAttack.

Unzip the .WAD, and use adeusf from Aminet to patch it with your Doom
II .WAD thusly:
  adeusf doom2.wad 2nd_enc.wad 2nd_enc_patched.wad

Stick the patched .WAD and the .DEH file into your Doom directory.
You should be able to start the game using:
  doomattack -wad doom2.wad -file 2nd_enc_patched.wad -deh 2nd_enc.deh

I haven't extensively playtested this, mind you; I've got onto the
third level so far (boy, this is difficult!) and it works up to this
point.

I do get a lot more e-mails than he does.  Usually 150 to 175 per day. 
However according to our prefs we both have the same mail server.  That is
unless mail gets redirected on the server side.

Didn't know this. I use JR Comm daily and always heard it referred to as 
a "dial up" program.  I use JR Comm to log-on to my shell account and use
the ISP's telnet client or TIN for usenet.

I don't know about fido-nodes, but around here, there is one semi-amiga BBS
for 300 miles...

There used to be 6-8 within a local calling area...

You can also fit an external IDE device, as long as you have a buffered 
interface and a long enough cable. Both of which you'd need if you put your 
Amiga into a tower. (Unless you wnet SCSI.)

Go into a PC hardware store, and buy an ATAPI/(E)IDE CD ROM. Or a SCSI one 
which suits the interface you have. It's all the same, just Amiga suppliers 
charge more.

 I recommened LG (Goldstar) CD ROMs. I've used them in many PCs and my Amiga, 
and have never had any trouble with them. Very robust, quite nice looking (as 
far as a CD ROM can look nice:). They even read CDRWs. And they're as cheap as 
all the other makes of CD ROM out there.
 I've got a 16 speed IDE LG CDROM connected through a buffered 4-way interface 
and using IDEFix97.

If you can find them, get a TEAC (e.g. the 532E). They do nice things like 
CDDA extraction, reading raw Subchannels, etc.

Subject: [just-amiga] Terminus Script

From: Rick Giles <rickgiles@clear.net.nz>


 Here's a chance to be useful!

I have created a terminus script to count rings on the phone, but I want to
log them so I can see it for later.
 Unfortunatly the logfile will not accept INTEGER VARIABLES, ie I can't
say:

log RingNumbers

but it's fine to say

log RingNumber$

because that would be a STRING VARIABLE.

 So what I need to know is how to convert an integer to a string.

      Cool Enough, TTFN!

I just got rid of two other onlists because they're too big. Even
with this one I wish yam's filter would work.
 This size is comfortable enough to keep.

 I wonder if you could tell me just briefly what it's going to do?

Internal? Impossible.
You can buy a Squirrel or a Surf Squirrel, plug it in the PCMCIA port, and
connect a SCSI CD ROM to it.
I did this with a Plextor 6x, and worked very well.
I _strongly_ suggest you to buy a tower for your Amiga.
I've bought a Power Tower and is a good tower, with a lot of space.

Read above.

I don't know, sorry.

Now I use a Samsung 32x CD ROM IDE in my Tower.
Is very cheap, works very well with data CDs and is excellent also with
the Audio CDs (CDDA).
Also Plextor and Creative are good.

Subject: [just-amiga] Filters in YAM...

From: Loki <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello,

   I only joined the list a while ago, and there has been a lot of mails
posted about using Filters in YAM. I`m using YAMP6 here, and
every single one of my filters works beautifully. I did have
some problems with a Remote filler I made to remove mail off my
server from me to mailing lists, to save downloading my own mails.
But I sorted that too!

Have I missed something?, Or are you all actually having probs with
the Filters?

Cya,..

Splitz&Jointz. There are versions both for PC and Amiga. Search the aminet,
or give me a shout and I'll throw them your way...

As opposed to...? If it's less than about 60 then that'll be why.

It's possible, but I don't really know enough about them to say that much.

I have an A1200 OS3.1 with 68030/68882 8mb fast but I still find it is
nowhere near the performance on the web as the PC PentiumII 300 64mb
that I have access to for web surfing. My Amiga set up just cannot get
any where near the performance of the PC.

Maybe I could spend money as you suggest but I don't see any
justification until the new Amigas come out. And prices in Australia are
a lot higher than in UK or USA so what may be cheapish for you is rather
expensive for us.

The percentage of web pages use all the "fancy stuff" would depend on
what sort of web surfing you do. I agree that nearly all Amiga related
pages are designed for what the Amiga can handle but there is an awful
lot of non computer related web pages that can be surfed that are
designed for the latest Explorer and Netscape browsers.

I agree entirely with this comment. What would we do without Aminet and
all the mailing lists? And what would we do without all the faithful
developers who keep updating things like Directory Opus?

Spot on! And if the current Amigas can't let us keep up with progress
then unfortunately we have to use PC until the Amiga catches up. And a
lot of that "fancy stuff" can be very useful in some situations. For
instance, how else could I enter my tips in the weekly Australian Rules
Football tipping competition at http://www.afltips.com/ ??  (Come on the
Dons!!)

BTW a quick glance through the headers of e-mails in a couple of Amiga
mailing lists (not so much on this list but on others) shows quite a few
using PC mailing programs so come on, hands up all those who are using
PCs for the web!!.


Another area in which PC is far ahead of Amiga at the moment is the vast
amount of children's educational software on CD-ROM. I haven't seen
anything like it for Amiga in Australia. Is there much Amiga stuff
available in UK and USA? Some of the PC stuff is really fantastic for
kids.

Matthew O'Neill says:-

> It's called the Ami*NET* because stuff is uploaded every minute

And I never cease to be amazed at just how much new stuff is appearing
every day! Shows just how dedicated the Amiga user base is!

I think the Amiga windows system is STILL far superior to that (ugghh!)
PC Windows junk in many ways.

So come on Amiga - get a new one out soon and let us update to something
that will leave the PCs for dead!

Probably due to a licensing problem.  Unisys hold patents on the
compression code used in GIF, and tend to demand large amounts of money
from anyone who publishes commercial software using the routines.
Cloanto tried to get round the problem by making the PPaint GIF plugin
free; I suspect that Unisys are clamping down on it.

I have this plugin (for PPaint 6.x) and can send it to you if you want.

I use a small paint brush (about 1/2 inch wide) with a dab of
methylated spirits here, works wonders. :)

Those mini Vacuum cleaners IMHO are a waste of time. They're really
not powerfull enough to do anything useful.

Don't bother buying on of those small computer vacuums as a large vacuum
with a hose attachment does just as well, and you can use it to do other
cleaning.

Someone care to enlighten me to why this happens (nothing to do with
HDinsttools though):

I'm using a Buddha IDE-interface in my A3000 and am trying to use two things
on it, on separate IDE-channels. One 500 meg harddisk and one CD-changer.
So far, no problem. I can access one or the other but not at the same time!
If the CD-changer is attached to the Buddha, the harddisk is invisible to
every program that inquires the bus to what devices it has. Remove the
changer and I can do whatever I please to the harddisk. I really don't
understand this since both channels seem to work just fine.

I installed it but it doesn't recognize the image.  I get an unknown
filetype message.  The docs mention the program is able to convert to EPS
but the list of types that can be read in doesn't include EPS.  Were you
able to get it to work for you?

I live in a very dusty area and have to frequently turn the keyboard 
upside down and give it a hard shake to knock out the bread crumbs etc. I 
then use a Q-tip & rubbing alcohol or just a soft cloth damp with dish 
soap to mop up the remains. It looks like most of the grim on keyboards 
is a combination of human finger oils and hot dog splatters.

When in real trouble... (I have to pull the key cap up... ) I use one of 
those IC chip removers and gently pry all the caps off... work each key 
until it looks brand new, Qtips usually do the rest.. and light wax for 
the sticky key. Disassembling a keyboard to clean out the dust bunnies 
once in a blue moon should be seen as a long term investment. 

Of course all of this is moot if you have a wedge designed keyboard:)

I use cotton wool and an alcohol solution. Works a treat. 

I once bought a used Amiga that was filthy. I had to completely strip
it down and take off all the keys and throw the lot in the bathtub and
get scrubbing 8]

With no developement for the past 6 years the amiga would be in trouble with
or without the internet. It is a tribute to the machine's greatness that
there is any user base at all. If anything the intermet saved the amiga  because
it kept a small core community of users together. Without the internet that
community may not have existed at the time of the Gateway purchase and
Gateway may have opted to take the patents and do nothing.

Yeh, that's the one I was reading about. The instigator was someone
who was fed up paying 700 quid per quarter for his web calls -- right?

A few things spring to mind here :-
1/ He should try to get out more --- it's a BIG world out there.

2/ His intentions may well be sound, but the methods? Nah, not a
chance!! All that will happen, is people will "double up" the next
Sunday, or even worse, go on - line the following day (at peak time!!)
When will we Brits learn that the Internet is a tool, AND NOT a
substitute for a social life ? BT will laugh all the way to the bank,
until some PROPER competition comes along.

3/ If an American phone company charged the ammounts BT charged, do
You think the Yanks would call a one day Internet strike? NO they
would be laying Capitol Hill to siege !!! and banging on Billy boys'
door (WITHOUT the "kneepads on :-)) If it happened in France, there
would be riots in the streets, and barricades at the ports -- In
Britain ---- a one day strike (yawn!!!)

A far better approach, in My opinoin would be to unplug the modem from
the computer for, not just a day ---BUT FOR *AT LEAST* THREE MONTHS!!
THEN see BT come up with a better deal for us all --- they've gotten
away with it for far too long now. It may seem a bit of a drastic
measure, but, as the saying goes "No pain -- no gain" But, I honestly
can't see it happening, at least not for a while, and not by what the
people of Britain are prepared to do about it.

Just a few comments to "keep the pot boiling" :-)

Probably because GIF is a proprietary format which is now being enforced by
the copyright owners; you can't use it in a program anymore unless you pay
a fee.  A lot of programs have been taking out their GIF support because of
this and going to PNG.  I'm surprised that it wasn't removed from Aminet
earlier.

Ermm excuse me mr.mistake but how do you think aminet is produced?
it is an online source, people upload, so how to you suggest the
Aminet CD is produced if we all hadn't got online like you think would
have been better for the Amiga? Right people buy the CD and don't
have internet connection, but who is providing the files to ONLINE
aminet?

You are crazy!

Subject: [just-amiga] How to submit to Yahoo?

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Ok. Ok. this isn't really Amiga related but does anyone know how to
submit sites to Yahoo? the .com site, I can't seem to find any option
except help on submitting but that doesn't actually say where to
go or click.

I need to sumbit the AIO site as soon as i get the registered domain
and another -secret- site that i'm working on ;) shhhh. nudge, nudge,
wink, wink :) You'll find out soon enough.....

Any help is greatly welcome!

Toodle Pip!

I can't find it at all! a few years ago there wa a link called submit which
took you straight to the form, but no more. I recommend doing a search on
"submit" you will get a couple of dodgey ones, but the rest will be free
sites where you enter the details and it will submit your site to every
search engine going. beware of the ones which charge you!

Ah... but the thing is we're all gaga now 'cos Hildy describes herself
as 'A single redhead with an Amiga' - funny though 'cos I could have
sworn that you said your husband had a passion for his mainframe a
couple of mails back Hildy!?

Nick - a scruffy brown-hair bloke with an Amiga...

BTW EricB you're not my long lost brother of the same name?

Hello

To submit on Yahoo! you need to first be in a category that relates to the submission.  Then you will see the infamous Add URL button.

If you need any help, let me know.

I have submitted our business sites to many, many search engines.  The best/quickest/easiest appears to be Alta Vista.


Bye for now

Paul

I can't find it at all! a few years ago there wa a link called submit which
took you straight to the form, but no more. I recommend doing a search on
"submit" you will get a couple of dodgey ones, but the rest will be free
sites where you enter the details and it will submit your site to every
search engine going. beware of the ones which charge you!

Subject: [just-amiga] 4.5gigs

From: ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

Is anyone using a 4.5 gig Quantum HD on their a3k ? I just picked one up
today, but had no idea 4 gig was the max. I ran across something called
giga.device on aminet, says the big drive needs to be dev 0. Thats all fine
and good, but my a3k looks at dev0 to boot from. I've tried hooking a system
up to a floppy, a 100 meg hd, and a 1.3 gig (almost shot Quantum HD). 
The 100 is dev 6, the 1.3 gig also is dev 6. giga device (until registered can
only access as dev/unit 0..

Anyone else hooked up with a gig drive over 4 gigs ?

You can register your site with ukplus really easy,
just click on the Add A Site button and fill in the form
also you get the option to register with many other search 
engines at the same time.

Also Yahoo is quite straightforward just make sure that
you are in the catagory which best fits your site then
click Add Url.

Good Luck

   What are you using? Disk copy?

It is a DOS disk your trying to copy isn't it?


   Have you tried copying all the files from one disk to your harddrive,
and then copying them all back onto a blank disk?

See ya.

It's simply incredible what Loki wrote on 04-Feb-99:

Thomas Hurst just sent me an interesting message in our list that
might change this one to you I'd already written. It seems possible
that the filtering does happen on the server and that there is no
way of knowing it worked without outside help.
 The filter button on main screen dosn't do anything. Time will tell
me if it's true.

I've only been joined one or maybe two weeks myself and the first
thing I remember doing is bringing up this question. Even though
I've grabed the latest aminet YAM13_5.lha (YAM 1.3.5) it just
dosn't work.
 But it's really easy to operate!

Well that sounds even better! 
 You've missed nothing, if you wouldn't mind telling me how to
remove them directly then I'm in business.

ps Does your yam deal with over 60 messages? I think it was when I got
170 one day that I first tryed using it. Could be wrong, but now I
have 10/20 it sure dosn't work.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Thomas Hurst suggests that yam tells the server to do it.
Yam suggests that it does it, by the press of its button. Except
 it never acts.
I suggest that my filters have been working since the deselected
 subjects havn't appeared in the amiga mail list recently.

You swing things back again. If it is indeed done offline and so
isn't working at all I don't really care. The object of my plan
is now to have what you call 'spam filtering' because I really
care about wasting online time and it would be better not to have
to retrieve something in order to destroy it.

So if you can help there, please do. Or is it something you have
to pay the isp to do?

When? Server side filtering is very simple, and mainly designed for killing
spam, irritating posts from people you don't like etc. It does this by using
the TOP command to download headers and deciding what to do with the mail
depending on what your filter does.

> Yam suggests that it does it, by the press of its button. Except

It won't work if your POP3 server doesn't support the TOP command. moving
mail won't work, either, as stated in the docs.

Filtering into different folders occurs after disconnecting from the server,
yes.

> So if you can help there, please do. Or is it something you have
> to pay the isp to do?

If it doesn't work, chances are your POP3 server doesn't support the TOP
command - bug your ISP about it. Some ISP's support automatic server-side
filtering, which is handy for killing posts from irritating people.

Subject: [just-amiga] Filtering In Secret

From: Rick Giles <rickgiles@clear.net.nz>

It's simply incredible what Thomas Hurst wrote on 03-Feb-99:

|>Yeah, like most things I write ;)

I might have to agree...

|>> But dosn't the filtering happen offline? The isp dosn't actually
|>> do it, so it seems.
|>Nothing to do with filtering, but when Yam connects and says "Getting
|>statistics"

If that's true then how do I know it's not working, maybe it has
been. I'll just have to see if any declined message subjects
are through and let you know!

I do know that there is a filter button on the main screen and that
it never does anything to the current messages.


I can see no trace of towerization or of DTP suggestions since
my last mail run on 2nd of feb.
 It might be working after all! You'll have to tell me if this
is a fact though.

))Ummm, I'll complete that - it crashes on some POP3 servers.

Uhh, now I understand what you dudes were talking about.
 Can't blame me for not knowing how it works, yam docs don't tell.

Yeah, I do think it might be working for me after all.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

I'm sorry if I have missed somewhat here; but why would you want to filter
out those subjects?

Subjects often change without people actually changing the subject line;
and you could be missing something usefull. . .

What's the phrase I am looking for here ? --- Ah yes ---" There are
none so blind as those who will not see" If You look at the subject
line above, it reads "controversy & *debate" Now, I won't insult Your

REAL SOON !!!!!!!!!!!!! (Entitled C & D PART 3) You won't like

The main reason one needs telnet is because many providers require it to
upload webpages for websites.

Subject: [just-amiga] Microsoft Outlook Express HTML off?

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

A friend has really started to annoy me with his stupid
Microsoft Outlook Express program, it sends a copy of his message
in HTML like Gavin Williams, anyway looking through the past 
JUST-AMiGA archives I can't seem to find the message that told
him how to turn it off, I'd appreciate it if someone could email
me privately to let me know what menu etc it is in so I can get him
to turn it off. 

Don't want to rubbish the list with PC trash so email me at
*amiga@thefree.net*

Toodle Pip!

I don't really see where you are basing your facts. The internet is
a savour for the Amiga, firstly, things like Team *Amiga* along with
many mailing lists etc would not run. Amiga users would still be sending
off a few quid in a piece of card to PD librarys to get less files for
more money than they could from the internet. Online magazine would
not exist which would only leave Amiga format and the odd other printed
mail order mags. You could not meet Amiga buffs on irc, post costs
alot more in the long run and takes alot longer. You can get beta
testers and have a reply within days instead of weeks or months.

They are just a very few... sor first before you open your mouth check
that what your saying is at least a bit correct.

Hmm, doesn't this paragraph always end up in Amiga format? I think
Mr.Shankey/Sharkey has been doing a bit of copying. Sly.

Moan over!

This question has already been answer but i'll put it in my words :)

Telnet is a form of connecting two computer terminals over the internet,
when logging onto the internet you are given an IP address, this
can be Static (same each time you logon) or dynamic (Changes each
time) - It is sort of like a telephone number which locates you on the
internet and where all things you do and request are sent to.

With telnet you would connect to another computer terminal at
their IP address, eg 64.222.531.224 - Telnetting has many uses,
but really you should only use it if you have a certain purpose for
doing so, this is usually access to Bulletin Board Systems etc
to gain files, these are open to anyone but it is rare to find a 
BBS connected 24hours. You can also connect to other terminals
like Shells. These are usually PC or Unix based systems.

Unless you have a reason for connecting to some other computer
on the internet then this isn't really an important part of the
internet.

Regards!

From: Loki <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello Rick
     Hiya, Rick... ,on 06-Feb-99 you wrote me about [just-amiga] Re: Filters in YAM...! :)

RG>> Well that sounds even better! 
RG>> You've missed nothing, if you wouldn't mind telling me how to
RG>> remove them directly then I'm in business.

Ok, here I`m going to explain it simply for those of you having problems
or those who dont know how to use filters in YAM.
(Please ignore all this if you know what ya doing :) eheheheh, this is for
the newbies and the people who cant get the filters working.)

B4 I start, I`m using YAM2.0Preview6 (thats what it says in the About req.)
If you are using an earlier version, I suggest you d/l this version, cus
it`s cool! If you are using a later version (I think this is the latest tho,
maybe not? Then thats even better.)

Now, the way I see it, the filters get executed in order down the filters
list, so you have to be careful with them.

<tsb>Creating filters for mailing lists and similar:

o Open the preferences. Goto the `Folders' section.

o Click the new button and type a directory name in the requester.
  This will be the name of the dir in your YAM: assign. When you press
  enter, it should come up as the `Path', you can then change the `Name'
  to anything you want, and it wont affect things, the name is what you
  will see in the folders section of the main window. :)
  But for example, lets do a JustAmiga filter, so put `JustAmiga' for the
  /Path/ and `Just Amiga' for the /Name/.

o Leave all of the options as they are, unless you want the folder to
  be encrypted? (Maybe it`s personal and you dont want anybody else
  to be able to read it?) This option is esspecially cool for those of
  you who share the email account with other family members' IE, say
  your brother was: john@thehouse.demon.co.uk, and you are
  bob@thehouse.demon.co.uk, you could have mail to your address encrypt
  and filter to your own folder, and he would have to put in a password
  to be able to read it. To do this, change the `Mode' to `Compressed with
  password.'. But as it`s JustAmiga, you dont need to change it.

o Now, if this IS a mailing-list filter we are creating,.(hyperthetically) in
  the `To: address' field, you can put the address of the mailing list in
  here, then if you have the list name highlighted in the main-window, when
  you hit the `Write' message button, the message will automatically have
  the To: field filled in. But as this is the JustAmiga we are doing, put
  `JustAmiga <just-amiga@onelist.com>' in the field.

o Now goto the `Filters' section, and hit the `New' button. Change
  the name to `JustAmiga' and make sure only `Apply to new mail' and
  `Apply on request' are selected. Then click the `Comparison' tab.
  this is where you tell YAM what messages will be affected by this
  filter. For the JustAmiga filter, change the `Search in' cycle to:
  `To field' (this is because, all mail sent TO the Just Amiga list, will
  have just-amiga@onelist.com in the To: header.).
  So put `just-amiga@onelist.com' in the feild. `Substring search'
  will check the entire field for the string. For example: if you
  were doing a Subject search. and you put `Amiga' in the field,
  something like `The *Amiga* is cool' for the Subject of the message
  would be affected, where as without `Substring search' enabled,
  only the subject `Amiga' would get affected. But as this is the 
  JustAmiga filter, leave it unselected. `Address' checks the address
  for the string (So make sure it is selected for mailing lists). `Name'
  will check the actual name of the person who sent the message,
  (IE this one would be `Loki') :).__
  _SO:_ make sure we have: `Search in'=`To field' the type to `=' the
  string as `just-amiga@onelist.com' and `address' selected.
  Oh and `don`t combine'

o Ok, now click the `Action' tab, This is where you have to figure 
  what will happen to mails of this filter! For mailing lists you
  will want the `Move' button checked, and then click the pop gadget
  next to it and select the folder you want it moved to. That`s
  `JustAmiga' for this filter,.. From here, you can do loads of different
  things to your mail,. such as, auto reply with a text, or file.
  execute a command, etc. NOTE: if you select `Delete' with this type
  of filter, the message will be downloaded and then moved you your
  `Deleted' trashcan.

o Oh yeah, you can save now :)

<tsb>Filters to delete mail remotly off the server:

o Open the preferences and goto the `Filters' section.

o Click the `New' button and hit the `Options' tab. Give your filter
  a name (lets do one to delete the just-amiga mail, ehehehe, just as
  an example). So give it the name `Just Amiga Delete' and click the
  `Remote filter' button. This should blank out all the rest of the options.

o Goto the `Comparison' tab and set all the options in it the same as
  the example above. 

o Now click the `Action' tab and you will have a limited range of options
  availible. But click the `delete' option to automatically delete off the
  server, without downloading.

o If you were to select the `Don`t download' option, you would not get the
  mails, but they would build up on the server, and when you finally did
  download them, you would get them all in one go, IYSWIM :)

o Now, lastly, move your filter to the top of the filters list (drag and
  drop to make sure it`s executed first), then save your prefs.

(The `Delete' maybe a feature the Mail server has to support for you to
be able to use it,.)

<tsb>

Finally, the `Filter' button in the main-window does work! What it does
is applys your `Local' filters to the `Incoming' directory,. IE,
switch off your filters, download mails that are to lists, put your
filters back on and then click it. If you have filters that move your
list mails to individual folders, it will sort your `Inbound' directory
out. :) It`s not for remote filter (I dont think.)

WOW!,. took me ages to write that, perhaps I should do a FAQ :)
Maybe not :)

If anybody has any other questions I`d be happy to help, if I can
of course :)

RG>> ps Does your yam deal with over 60 messages? I think it was when I got
RG>> 170 one day that I first tryed using it. Could be wrong, but now I
RG>> have 10/20 it sure dosn't work.

I`ve never had over 60 mails,. I poll my mail 4 times a day usually :),
and still get about 30 everytime, other wise I`d have a little too 
many to take in, in one go :)

But yeah, I heard something about a 60 mail limit. And people having
problems downloading more :(

I must disagree with You, on a couple of points, here :-
All Commodore were doing 6 years ago were "box shifting"
stuff they had developed a year, to 18 months previously, so
it's about 8 years we have been left in limbo. *BUT, STILL* the
user base was holding up, until about 2 years ago, about the same time
as the Internet exploded onto (into?) the scene, in a big way.
Looking through the back issues of My Amiga magazines, I noticed they
all had  good circulation figures *until* they started "talking up"
the internet, and sales plummeted --- coincidence ? I don't think so.

I agree with You about the Amigas'  greatness, but where's the
greatness in browsers that have more crashes than Stevie Wonders'
Caddilac ? More hangs than a vigalante group ?

I think, it's just a case of "soldiering on" with what We have, and
hope that this is the nadir, and that, soon, once again, We will be
able to say to all those doubters --- "*TOLD YOU SO!!*"

Sankey

PS

Why is it, that now there is talk of an upturn in the Amigas'
fortunes, all the gamesplayers come out of the woodwork, and start
rattling on about how great it will be to be able to play the
"bestest" games ever ? Ain't that where Commodore fu*&ud up. by
selling the Amiga as a games machine. (contoversy & debate (part 2)

Oh, but it *does* get very quiet here, for most of the time -- I've
been here before changing My ISP account details, so have decided to
inject a little input of a "cage - rattling" nature ;-) (hope that's
OK with everyone !!!!!)

Let's just hope there will be sufficiant confidence, to enable the
development of all the things (*AND MORE!!!!!) that the PC has, that
are sadly lacking in current Amiga IT software

*ROLL ON, 2000 !!!!!!!!!!

I should have been more clear. I agree that commodore was not doing much.
In fact you could make a good argument that in all the years that commodore
owned the amiga they only made slight improvements to an original design
that they had nothing to do with. In my comment I was refering to serious
development from third parties. I know there were some companies who
supported the amiga after commodores demise, but not many. And even 
the companies that did not desert the platform, were much more cautious
in their development. I certainly do not blame the companies, after all they 
have a buisness to run. On the issue of the user base holding up untill about 
two years ago. I think that depends on where you live. The user base in the 
US was very small even in the last days of Commodore. When commodore
 went under it quickly got worse. In fact the name recongnition of the amiga
 in the US is almost down to zero, if you are talking about "normal", noncomputer
 types. I imagine things were diffrent in Europe where the amiga had always been
a more "popular" machine.

Don't complain about current amiga software. Ibrowse is basicly developed by
one person in his spare time. Yet amiga users want all the features of IE
and Netscape. These programs have hundreds of people in the development.
It's not that I wouldn't like a better browser, I just think until the
amiga's position improves you have to be realistic.

You could not be more right. Amiga Inc should build a great computer. If
that computer has great games fine, but that should never be the focus you
can't compete with the consoles.

A couple of thoughts.

I assume you have tried copying to more than one disk and get the same
with each destination disk?

Are you copying to a DSDD disk or a DSHD disk?

Amiga disk drives will not handle high density disks very well - they
may seem to format OK but some will end up with errors on them. Best to
stick with double density if you can still get them!

I have a disk drive that suddenly started creating errors every time I
wrote to it. I can read OK from it but not write to it. So maybe your
drive has had it?  :-(

From: Frank Bunton <bunton@acay.com.au>

Does any one know of a printer driver that will work on an Amiga 1200
OS3.1 for a Canon BJC-4200?

I went to their web site but BJC-4200 not mentioned in Amiga drivers -
closest was BJC-4000
Does anyone know if this will work on BJC-4200?

This has been planned for weeks, maybe months. An organisation called
unmetred.org trying to get rid of all the per minute charges, like most
american phone companies have

From: Loki <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello Hilda
     Hiya, Hilda... ,on 08-Feb-99 you mailed me about: [just-amiga] Re: help with Telnet! So I`ma reply`in...

FB>> I went to their web site but BJC-4200 not mentioned in Amiga drivers -
FB>> closest was BJC-4000
FB>> Does anyone know if this will work on BJC-4200?

I`ve got a Canon BJC-4300, but I suggest you get Turbo Print,
It totally bypasses the crappy old printer.device. And gives some
STUNNING print outs, that when you compare with the printer.device
versions. The difference is amazing! You can also spool from
any program that prints with the printer.device. And it improves
the quaility of those too, for example, WordsWorth and FW.

And I`m sure it has a driver for the BJC-4200, it has drivers for
just about every printer in existance.

From: Loki <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello,

      Has anybody ever managed to rip that cool module out of
the Big Time Sensuality Demo? All I get is binary. I think that`s
due to some weird compression on the samples tho? 

Just wondering. Peeps on the Satanic List didn`t know, so I thought
I`d ask you lot :)

Cya,..

Actually a chocolate teapot would sound yummy right about now.  Suggest that
around Hollywood and there'll probably be a bakery that'll come out with it

Yeah. Although the Internet does do the amiga harm, it also does it more
good. If there was no internet, we wouldn't have all these MLs, all the
newsgroups, and above all, the one thing which keeps the amiga going, the
Aminet and all it's contrubuters. Remember that

It's simply incredible what Andy Kinsella wrote on 07-Feb-99:

Yes. Perhaps it dosn't work for a while because the recent ones I
entered still got through this time. They might not next time.

Probably I'll just remove the ones like that after a while, when
the thread has died off.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Thing is, most of us that want this also can't live without the 'net for too
long, so a longer strike would probably prove impossible :)

Studio has a BJC-4200 driver.  I've been using it for some time and it works
very well.  There is a demo of it on Aminet.  You will probably have to
download one or more of the upgrades to get the 4200 driver as the program
is older than this printer.

I think this driver should also work but I'm not really sure.

Have you tried searching on AmiNet? There's also a canondriver-set there (I
use it with my BJC240).

Probably, but that doesn't really matter anyway. I had the same problem when
Iw as trying tp find drivers for my printer the 250. All i found was 200.
Then I downloaded it and Caboom! 200, 220, 240, 280 and 250. Cannon packed
them in series...

Yes, lots of us :-)

You basically have two choices:

1) download the latest TD64 and FFS stuff from http://www.amiga.de/

   These allow you to use FFS with drives > 4GB

2) Buy PFS2. It copes with drives up to 2TG (= 2000GB!), and is much
   faster than FFS.

   I prefer PFS2 because I sell it  ;-)

  Tim

Subject: [just-amiga] Dust

From: Stephen Williams <sw@nysa.u-net.com>

Hi y'all

Does anyone know of a good way of shifting all that dust that collects
on the sides of keycaps?  I keep my keyboard dustcovered when my
Amiga isn't in use, but it gets dusty 'coz it's in use so often :-)
I wondered about buying a little vacuum cleaner, but I don't know how
effective they are, or if they're worth the money.

-Stephen

Why? only about 1% of web pages use all the fancy stuff, so why not?

We have the best mailer and IRC program on any platform, and even PC users
are jeleous of them. YAM and AMIRC, they cannot be beaten.

As for hardware, an 030 card with 16megs cost about 100 quid

Well actually I think this info would be welcomed by many Amiga users
and should be posted publicly here! I think we all have this problem
with html 'garbage' posted to us by PC users and... I for one would
love to explain to them exactly how to stop it.
BTW I've found that Amiga mailing lists generally use perfect
'netiquette'. Whenever I've subscribed to more general lists the
ineptitude in mailing skills is horrific! I get multiple copies,
PC viruses, the HTML repetition of messages, blank messages, replies
of "Yes - I agree" added to huge messages, massive pointless
attachments of the same message in 'Word' format, etc, etc. 

Sometimes subscribing to some of these (non-Amiga) mailing lists is
like strolling sober into a bar full of people in advanced states of
intoxification...

I don't half feel good to get that little rant off my chest... ;-)

From: Nano <syzygy@sunlink.net>

Yes, you can do that. Two of the most popular *nix programs for email would
be Elm and Pine. I prefer Pine and still use that over any PC/Mac/Amiga
email client to date (for this account anyhow =)).

You can also use Lynx via telnet which is a non-graphical web browser which
I use if I just need to grab something quick, no hassles. You can telnet
from a telnet to another account, fun fun. How about zipping/unzipping or
taring files in your shell from telnet. Moving files around and so on.

To me, my account which I access via telnet is just an extension of my hard
drive where I store files, email, web pages, etc. I keep backups there and
store things there for others to access. I use Telnet more than any other
internet application out there ... but I'm a freak. =) I love a shell.

PS: MUDs are still very popular. We get many new users all the time and
have a very large user base of regulars. Telnet required. =)

I don't know that you can up/download via a telnet session. I recall seeing
a function like that in AmTelnet but haven't tried it. You can in a
non-slip/ppp dial up terminal session into your account. Anyhow, yes, you
can use telnet to EDIT web pages. If you're like me you prefer to telnet to
your account and create your pages on the server they reside on rather than
on your computer then uploading them...

Subject: [just-amiga] A3k problem

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is, where software hut's current 
repairman didn't...

Basically here's what did happen in case someone has suggestions. I can still 
access onelist from the library computer so mail will be small to non-existant
till I get the ami back up to par.

Couple weeks back, had to do a guru reset, ami didn't come back up . just sat 
there with the green screen. Eventually much fiddling and resets later it did 
come back up.

Later on in the week repeated this process only it never came back. Off to 
software hut. 1 week and I'm told the hard drive about a year old maybe, bit 
the big one ? HUH ??? I just ran hdtools 'check data' option and it came back 
with ZERO errors. Hasn't been a bad sector on this drive since I got it.

So Software hut says they got it back to booting (NOT !). I don't consider a 
machine that runs when cool and fails hot as repaired because it's been off 
long enough to cool down and run.
So after $90+ and a week, it's now up to me to trace the prob down.

The hard drive is full of hard sector errors. It takes maybe 30 minutes to 
format a 200 meg partition now. And the sectors are still shot.

I still have the 'when it heats up it dies' problem. Which makes me think 
several things, but if we have any ami mechs here , maybe you have some input.

Anyways my thoughts on what the prob is start with the power supply voltages, 
then go to the scsi controller. Those are my two ideas on what the problem is.

Has anyone else seen this ? Then there's the other thing that makes me think 
huh ? how can it be scsi when the CD drive works fine ? I don't expect any 
hard sector errors on the cd, but if it's the scsi controller (which would be 
#2 in the troubleshooting) why isn't it also affecting the CD ?

Oh why I don't think the problem is the hard drive. 
1st Like I said I ran HDTOOLS just a few days before this all this went south,
    and came up with NO ERRORS..
2nd I also completely removed the 1.3 gig hd and stuck the original 100 meg
in.    heating problem kept it from booting. So until I can get the heating 
    problem to repeat and then stick the 100 meg back in, I really have no 
    idea if the 1.3 gig hd is dead or not. It has lost almost all data. 
    including all my ace work directories. But like I said before this thing 
    died, I already have every single piece backed up..
3rd I'm using the amiga right now after an overnight cooldown. Trouble is the 
    hard sector errors have migrated to the whole drive 

I wonder if a virus could have caused all this ? Other than the aminet CD's I 
can't think where the virus came from..

Anyways if anyone else has seen this same problem and came up with a fix, I'd 
like all suggestions.

OK let me read this right...   

1: You went to software hut to get the machine repaired. 
2: You paid then $90.00 after a week & took it home.
3: You found that it still has problems.
4: You now want to find the hardware fault yourself, without any technical
   knowledge or experience with thermal intermittents.  



OK, Now here is something obvious,  How about complaining - or      
take it back & explicitly mention that it only fails when hot.

It's your $90.00,  if they want it, tell them to fix it or get a refund
& take it elsewhere to be fixed..

If you're getting green screens & such,  you have problems, it is NOT
funky hard drives or CD roms or any other minor (consumer) stuff.

Get a _professional_ to fix it,  screw around with the circuitry & you
will finish up having an expensive mobile to hang from your ceiling.....

You are not crazy. I went through the same/similar thing with an
A-3000. My only solution was to get another computer. It is
definitely a heat problem, but it HAS to be on the mother board

At the time I suspected the fluctuating power in the house we
lived in. I got a UPS after finding out the power was
fluctuating, down mostly, from 10 to 12 volts.

I replaced all kinds of chips that could be taken out and
re-socketed everything. I tried blowing heat on the board with a
heat gun and could not find ANYTHING that would cause it except 
that after it ran long enough to get hot it quit! I hope you 
find a solution other than mine.

BTW, I sure love my A-4000 and I HIGHLY recommend geting a UPS to
everyone.     ----- Don

Subject: [just-amiga] hard drive

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

I'm pretty sure this means a controller error, but can't find any info 
anywhere to verify or deny it. It would seem my Quantum Fireball tm1280s
300j  has decided to all of a sudden quit, or maybe the scsi controller 
itself...

Using hdtools, and marking bad blocks,(since it would seem something has gone 
drastically wrong) I get hardware error 2!. Can't find diddly in any of the 
amiga books I have, all of which I had to hunt up 2nd hand as nothing really 
came with my used amiga.

Does anyone have any idea what would make a hard drive seemingly go from 
working perfectly not a scratch on any sector (I actually ran hdtools verify 
data option just days before this happened, I have no idea why..) To it's 
current state of hard booting if at all, and bad sectors from one end of the 
drive to the other.

I suspect the controller but have no way to check it. And software hut wasn't 
any real help. They just said the HD is shot. Makes no sense one day perfect 
next day looks like it was at Hiroshima.

Well not entirely true, as I spent 8 years AF repairing radios. My eyes are no

longer good enough to trace down the small stuff without a huge magnifying
glass in the way.

I had trouble just getting a cable in the right pins. It's simpler to let 
somone with 20/20 eyes repair it. But I can if pressed. I'm now pressed.

Which still didn't answer my questions...

Have you seen what I described, and have some useful input on it ?
I got the freeze spray in case it was a faulty chip. But I need it to fail to 
use the spray which gave me time to think whats actually happening.

HDTools says I have a hardware error 2!. I have no troubleshooting books that 
even tell me what hardware error numbers mean. That makes me think SCSI 
controller or maybe a fluctuating power supply.

Well I had an a3k 16. That board went out, and got this a3k 25mhz from 
software hut just last year sometime. I'm not saying it isn't on the board, 
it's just too deep to be just a faulty chip on the motherboard.

1 minute I have a VERY GOOD - EXCELLENT 1.3 gig HD.

Gurus on me, then has an impossible time coming back up.
Software hut runs it (after cooling down) and they find the HD is shot..
Actually I've been running it all day myself now with guruing and other than 
the shoddy hd, it's been fairly well behaved. A watched pot never boils...

Hello Ken
     This is about the third letter that I have read about hard driver
problems this as I my self am getting similar problems. I totally just
lost my seagate 2 gig hard drive the boot block became bad and I can
not write to them. This was for no reason that I could find. 

Is thier a Virus going around? I don't know But i am starting to think so.
Before the scsi HD went down my main 1.3gig (IDE) went down total loss
could not recover any files with AMI-Tools (which is strange).

 How do we check for a current virus?
I have ran most of the software from aminet. They say nothing found.

Being a Tech myself, I would just say:  Be carefull using freeze spray,
apply it slooooooowly to semiconductors, as the sudden cold shock can 
damage the device itself...

Also, a hair dryer is required too...

However, it will ultimately show up the thermal intermittent, providing
that you can establish a 'reliably faulty' condition to base your tests on.

The other thing that is important is:

1: Remove all sundry cards & periferals that are not needed for the test.
2: If you suspect a device, (eg: HardDrive) Change it with another one first. 
3: Remove all but the chip ram, if you can, just incase it's a funky zip.
4: Use the logic:  "If you don't know what it is, find out what it isn't."

I would suggest that you took it out and tested if on someone elses   
controller, to make sure what is really faulty (the controller of the   
hdd).

Just a thought, and I may be totally off base here, but it seems I remember
reading somewhere that a green screen indicated a memory problem (although I
would think Software Hut would know this).  Still, reseating the memory
chips would be worth a try.

Subject: [just-amiga] EPS images

From: jack york <jyork@voyager.net>

Hello,

I just got a CD with hundreds of EPS images on it and the only way I know of
to display them is to load each one into PageStream.  Is there a viewer that
will quickly display an EPS image like there are for JPEGS, GIFS and the
like?

try metaview - I think you have to register it to batch convert stuff, but
it does handle eps's.

      I prefer SFS because it is better than 1) and free :-)

Yes, but surely, most companies still made money, and thought of the
Amiga as a still viable platform, even after Commodore's demise (at
least that appeared to be the case in the UK). I'm basing My case on
reading through back issues of the UK Amiga press. Three to four years
ago there were lots of advertisers in the mags, of which we had five
or six here --- all with a healthy circulation figure. Then along
comes the IT revolution *AND BANG!!!* a downward spiral 'til only one
title is available, and it's circulation is such, that, if not for the
other titles the group has it would go out of circulation also.

I would NEVER knock the people who write for the Amiga -- if only I
were half as talented. But let Me make My point, in a different manner
Let's, just for a minute leave aside all internet soft, and hardware.
Then look at Your computer --- what do You see? a brilliant, super
efficient machine more than adequate for Your needs? probably
(no -- definately!!). Now do it the other way, and evaluate Your
machine with only the internet in mind. Not quite the same glow of
satisfaction there is there? I know there are valid reasons why the
software isn't up to scratch, even the hadware is a bit "flakey" , in
as much as You need to bolt things on, in a heath robinsonesque way.
But, giving reasons why, doesn't alter the fact that the internet (I
feel) has done more harm, than good to the amiga community. It's a bit
like a drug, this internet --- You always want more, and more. You
don't get it from an Amiga, so You leave the platform, and go
somewhere where it's "happening", ------ no?

 Glad You agree with Me on that one that could "rattle a few cages"

PS
 
Talking of the Amiga community, does it annoy anyone else when You see
an article in the Amiga press that goes along the lines of "I have
this A500, with 1meg ram, and a broken mouse, and dirty keyboard. I am
writing to complain that all Your pages are full of stuff I can't use.
Please see to it that next month's coverdisk is filled to the brim
with stuff written for w/b 1.3 ------ OR ELSE! ?

I can't help, but feel sad at Your comment about "fancy stuff". For
one thing, the "fancy stuff" is what is being written NOW, and is what
is called progress --- something we Amigans were at the forefront of.
In fact we still are, in areas /other/ than the internet. For another
thing --- 1% ?  even if that figure were correct (and I must say, I
doubt it) then by the time You read this, it's at least gone up to 1
1/2%, and by the morning, possibly 2%. Most of the commercial sites
use Java applets, and such-like, and to access them only to have One's
computer crash, when using the 2 non Javascript browsers we have, or
to spend most of the time on-line clicking error requesters, or save
windows closed, using the one that does,does not enhance one's time
on-line.

Can't comment on AMIRC --- don't use it that much. As to YAM, I had a
BIG problem with it, when I installed v 6. It just dropped the files
anywhere it wanted. after getting it all together it worked fine for a
while, then just ceased to work, for some reason. I use Microdot now,
until I can sort Yam out

What should be said here is :- ANOTHER 100 quid --- and You still
won't be able to use any of the latest AVI's, or RM/RA files. that
might drop into Your cache.
Do You now see, why I made My original statement ?

Are you sure that is possible to run a port of Doom with Doom2 and a
Wolfenstein wad?
I remember when I used ADoom 1.2 with the commercial wad of Doom2
and a custom wad, and worked perfectly.
Maybe a corrupted wad?
The Wolfenstein 3D wad aren't compatible with Doom2?
You're using the Doom2 main wad of the shareware version?

Subject: [just-amiga] CD Rom Questions

From: "Dral" <peter@hard.u-net.com>


Hi Folks,

I'm finally being forced into a corner! After fighting the
inevitable for a year or so I'm now beginning to find it very hard to
get certain software on floppy. For the first time I'm seriously
thinking about buying a CD ROM.

(I have an Amiga 1200 with Blizzard 1230 accelerator including 8
megs of extra ram. Internal HD and two external floppy drives). 

Questions...
(1) What needs to be done to fit an internal CD ROM? Can *anybody* do
it or should only /experts/ do it?

(2) Where does an external CD ROM plug into an A1200? 

(3) Most of all, does anybody have a list (or URL) which has a
selection of CD ROMs, UK retailers and UK prices? 

(4) Those who have a CD ROM already, what do you have and would you
recommend it?

Thanks in advance, Dral

That's a matter of opinion. AmIRC may be about the best IRC client on Earth,
but Yam is far from being the perfect mailer. Users of other OS's would be
hard pressed to beat NewsRog, though, so I'm told...

I have a.. humm.. wait... "CyberDrive"? Yeah, that's what it says. Okay, so
it works OK but it's a bit peculiar when it comes to playing audio cds.
Sometimes you can hear some ticks & tacks or something while playing. And it
goes through the audio lines, it's not just the cd player humming.

But it works fine for data cds. 24x, connects as an IDE drive (i.e. if you
only have an internal harddrive it might be difficult to fix all the cables
and stuff yourself). It's actually an internal cd drive but I have it on the
table (with my harddrive on top).

I've never kept my keyboard covered and .... I smoke...so little bits
of ash get everywhere - and then there's cat hair...

I used canned air. My computer is in my art studio and I have a 
small air brush that I use to blow out the keyboard every once in a 
while. You can buy cannned air at any computer store, though.

I also blew out the inside of the Amiga case one time, the only time 
I got the Dreaded Green Screen. It worked.

Have you tried dropping it on the floor?  I did that to a PC keyboard once
and all the keys flew off.  Not only could I clean all the grot from the
keys, I could also replace them (the keys, not the grot) to form some rude
words!  Of course it was a works machine so any damage caused was
incidental and the owner was an American officer so there was no harm done.

One important point to note is that this will only be effective with an
A1000/1500/2000/2500/3000/4000 keyboard.  For other machines, it may be a
good idea to remove the mother board, hard drive, floppy drive, power
supply, etc, etc, before subjecting it to a collision with a concrete floor!

You forgot to tell him to make sure that with the new FFS from amiga.de,
you have to make sure the 'InterNational Mode' is ON in HDToolbox
& when you format the drive.

Also Note: He MUST NOT long format the partitions.

'Format' has a bug:-  
     Use Format with the QUICK option ONLY, on drives over 4 gig.  

But don't forget to setup the SCSI_IDE-43.24 patches first.

-snip-


In Australia we have a product called 'Windex' a blue liquid in a spray
bottle for cleaning windows, smells a bit like weak ammonia.

Pop off your key tops & put them in an ice-cream bucket & spray
window cleaner on them,  add a little cold water & slosh them around,
then tip out the stuff & rinse in cold water.....

Just like new....   No rubbing either....


PS:  I would avoid using any solvents like methylated spirits or such,
     it may melt the plastic or the letters....

[..]

Here in Europe most civilised folk have been getting used to a
remarkable device known as a 'plate' for some time. It seems to cope
well with the spillage of most food items although some have to be
transferred to a version with upturned sides known as a 'bowl'. Having
said this, these contraptions cause their own problems in that we now
need three hands: one to move the mouse/type, one to eat with and one
to hold this plate thing. BTW isn't bread crumbs a little on the large
side to be considered as dust?

Yours helpfully,

Nick Bergquist

I remember at the UK DevCon where they announced the A1200 to the
UK developers, the first question from the floor was "is the case
dishwasher safe?" which wasn't a question they were expecting!

Incidentally, it is ;-)

2 methods i use.

1: get some cotton buds on small sticks (come in packs of 200 or so) and
just use a little water on them. press the key next to it and wipe,
simple.

2: unscrew the amiga and disconnect the keyboard. you can now use whatever
method you like, very easy to do

Obviously I missed the mark... a little humour and I'm swamped with 
definations of 'bread crumbs'. Lighten up peons... not to mention devices 
that try to replace hotdog buns and taco shells. Way off topic...

Get back to 'how to get that dirty mark off my Amiga case' and 'The 
easiest ways to freshen and clean plastic cases'. I personally use soap & 
water on a cloth (just dampened) for the most part (downtown dust does 
not dislodge with a feather brush anymore), rubbing alchol does a good 
job with finger grease, and white gas (Coleman Stove Fuel) does a 
marvious job at really severe cases, beyond that; acetone melts plastic.. 
use it in a well ventilated area and you can sculpt with it:) (that's 
another bit of humour.. for those that thought it was advice).

No, only 2 hands needed. I heard rumours that someone had invented a portble
version which can actually fold up into your pocket and doesn't need
holding! Most romours have confirmed the production name as "bib" but you
didn't hear this from me, wink wink, mums the word...

This is weird, to say the least. I haven't seen this happen before.

Not necessarily. You may load ffs by LoadV43Module (just like the new scsi)
so the new version will completely replace filesystem from ROM (also on
floppies and in OFS mode). But one should have fast memory with KICK
attribute set for this method to be efficient or ffs will operate from chip
ram.

I have. No answer yet though.

Thing is, it used to work the way it's meant to. With an ordinary
CD-ROM attached as well. Not the same harddisk though.

BTW, how do you turn off/on reselection and last unit and so on for things that
are not harddisks? HDinsttools let me do it for HD's but not CD's and streamers.

You can't. These flags are stored on the RigisDisk block of an harddisk. 
As a CD-Rom/Streamer/Scanner.... doesn't have a RDB, you can't store it 
anywhere!

That's why some controllers had Jumpers (ALF-3) or nonvolatile memory 
(Oktagon).
The Buddha has neither. But this doesn't hurt much, as

1) The Buddha is an IDE controller, so you shouldn't worry about Sync bits 
and Reselection
2) AFAIR it completely ignores the "last lun/drive/controller" bits in any 
RDB. IDEfix does for sure, I am not 100% sure with the Buddha. (BTW, 
IDEFix uses its own executable as nonvolatile memory)
