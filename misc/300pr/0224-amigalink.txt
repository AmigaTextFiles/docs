          The Amiga-Link 2.0 / Envoy 2.0 Networking Package
          -------------------------------------------------

AmiTrix Development announced today that they will now be distributing
the Amiga-Link/Envoy networking package for all Amigas.  Arrangements
have been made with Intangible Assets Manufacturing (IAM), and with
ABF Computer GbR, that will see "Envoy 2.0" bundled together with an
updated, fully translated version of "Amiga-Link", to be assembled and
distributed by AmiTrix.


Amiga-Link is a complete solution to your Amiga peer-to-peer networking
needs. With the included software and hardware, you can share your hard
drives and printers, as well as run other network applications.  This
package is compatible with all Amiga models, using the floppy port for
maximum compatibility across models, and keeping other ports available
for their intended uses.  Low cost "rendering farms" are now possible.

The Amiga-Link package comes with both the standard AmigaLink software
and also the Amiga Envoy software.  The Amigalink software's advantage
is that it works with AmigaOS1.3, providing compatibility with older
machines, whereas Amiga Envoy requires 2.04 or higher, but provides
superior performance and device sharing.


Amiga-Link provides a less expensive method of peer to peer networking
using compact modules connected to the external floppy port and linked
together with BNC connectors and coaxial cables.  The SANA-II device
driver allows all Amiga's (including those without Zorro-II expansion
slots), to be connected in a network of up to 20 machines, within a
distance of 330 feet (100m).  DMA data transfer, at 450,000 bps from
network to memory, avoids CPU contention common to the parallel/serial
port networks, and leaves these ports free for normal use.  This is
roughly equivalent to ArcNet speed, and although slower than ethernet,
is less than half the cost.

The AmigaLink software has GUI tools for Workbench control of Import &
Export functions, network Statistics & Diagnostics tools for testing
and troubleshooting both hardware & software, while a Printer Spooler
program allows for network printer sharing.  It's SANA-II compatibility
allows other software to be run concurrently such as AmiTCP, providing
great flexibility when networking various Amiga's together.  A new
revised English manual is included.


Amiga Envoy is the standard Amiga peer-to-peer networking software that
was developed by Commodore's Amiga Networking Group.  Its performance,
user-interface and API are consistent with the philosophy of the Amiga
Operating System.  Amiga Envoy provides a simple messaging interface
for the easy development of reliable network applications.  Included
applications enable connected Amiga computers to share their hard disks,
CD-ROMs, and printers transparently.  Third-party applications can also
provide extra functionality such as electronic mail, remote computer
access, multi-user databases and multi-player games.

New features for Envoy 2.0 include support of AmigaOS 2.04 DOS packet
types (including notification and record locking), support for removable
media, enhanced reliability & robust recovery, localization, AmigaGuide
documentation, and more.


MSRP for the basic 2 unit package is $299.00 US, or $379.00 CAN.
Expansion kits, cable options and accesories are also available.
