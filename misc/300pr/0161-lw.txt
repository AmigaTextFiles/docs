This isn't a press release but it is confirmed:

As of June 15, 1994, NewTek will unbundle LightWave (version
3.2 with bux fixes and some new features (I don't know what
is fixed and what is added) and market it for $695.00.
Toaster dealers were FAXed this info on Friday May 20, 1994.

If any dealers read this and have the actual FAX handy and
feel like typing it in, please do so.
