LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, U.S.A., 1993 APR 21 (NB) -- In two booths,
one in the main show hall and one in the adjoining Multimedia
World center, NewTek announced a new version of its famed
Video Toaster, the Video Toaster 4000.

The new model is based on the new Commodore Amiga 4000, but
company spokesmen ranging from vice president Paul Montgomery
to product demonstrators including former "Star Trek: The Next
Generation" actor Wil Wheaton emphasized that the software has
been completely updated.

The new Toaster has a switcher with four video inputs and three
internal digital sources, close to 300 video effects, an integrated
graphics loader, a 24-bit character generator, and a new paint
system.

The Toaster also runs LightWave 3D, a three-dimensional modeling,
rendering and animation system, and ToasterPaint, a video paint
system. The company announced that Lightwave will be used to
create graphic effects for Steven Spielberg's "seaQuest DSV,"
debuting this fall on NBC. The Toaster also works with local area
networks, including Novell NetWare, meaning it can be the video
element in a corporate network.

Huge crowds and big talk have become something of a tradition
with NewTek since it introduced the Toaster in 1990. This year
was no exception. At Multimedia World, a host of small companies
offered Toaster enhancement software, harder, and training,
amidst hand-painted signs seldom seen at major shows since the
1970s. Said Montgomery. "Since 1990 we've formed a new
industry - Personal Video Production. What we represent is
the end of this show."
