   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
      
               New Upgrade of PEGGER Image Compression Software
 
 
Columbia, MO -- February 11, 1994
 
 
 
     Heifner Communications Inc. is proud to announce the availability of
 
v1.3 of their product, PEGGER, an automated image compression system for
 
Commodore Amiga computers.  PEGGER v1.3 brings drastically improved support
 
for the NewTek Framestore format used in the popular Video Toaster product.
 
"We are pleased to offer the finest support of NewTek's Framestore format
 
found in any 3rd party software currently on the market", said Heifner
 
Communications President, Greg Heifner.  "We have become well aware over
 
the past months that many of our customers are Toaster owners and we felt
 
that improving the product's performance for them was an important goal."
 
Not only is PEGGER v1.3 much faster when compressing and decompressing
 
Framestore images but also provides incredible broadcast quality while
 
maintaining high compression levels. 
 
     PEGGER v1.3 also provides support for compression of pre-buffered
 
Toaster CG Framestore pages as well as automatic support for compression and
 
decompression of IFF and JPEG images from the Macintosh.  In addition, we
 
have listened to our users and implemented some of their suggestions to
 
improve the software.
 
     This upgrade of PEGGER is so important that we have decided to provide
 
a free upgrade to all currently registered owners of the product.  If you
 
have already sent in your PEGGER registration card you will automatically
 
receive PEGGER v1.3.  In addition, a patch file to upgrade either PEGGER
 
v1.1 or PEGGER v1.2 to v1.3 will be placed on all electronic services,
 
including Internet, for the benefit of those PEGGER owners who have access
 
to these services.
 
 
     ATTENTION DEALERS/DISTRIBUTORS:  We will be providing dealers and
 
distributors a demonstration video tape explaining PEGGER and showing
 
off its capabilities as well as some cool animations that were originally
 
compressed using PEGGER.  You can share the video tape with your customers
 
and use it as a point of sale tool for PEGGER.  The video tape will be
 
shipping in approximately 2-3 weeks.  If you do not receive a video tape,
 
please call Heifner Communications to request one!
 
 
Availability:   February 15, 1994.

PRESS RELEASE
 
 
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   
   
             PEGGER, Automated JPEG Image Compression Software
 
 
Columbia, MO -- September 10, 1993
 
 
     Heifner Communications is now shipping a new software utility for
 
the Amiga line of personal computers and Video Toaster workstations.
 
PEGGER is a fully integrated JPEG utility based on the compression
 
algorithm from the Joint Photographic Experts Group.  PEGGER allows
 
programs that don't support JPEG images to work automatically with
 
them.  Everything from 3D animation systems to graphic and multi-media
 
programs greatly benefit from the enormous savings in hard drive space
 
PEGGER's JPEG compression provides.
 
     PEGGER's Snoop capability automates the JPEG processing for programs
 
that don't support JPEG, such as Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint AGA,
 
the NewTek Video Toaster, so they can load or save JPEG files. Literally
 
any program on the Amiga that supports the loading and saving of images
 
in the IFF 24 bit, DCTV, HAM8, or NewTek Framestore formats will now be
 
able to transparently load and save JPEG format images using PEGGER.
 
PEGGER runs seamlessly in the background, compressing and decompressing
 
files as needed.  Your 100 MB 24-bit or HAM8 library can be compressed
 
to under 10 MB and your applications won't even know it. A 50 MB hard
 
drive can now hold more than 1000 frames of high resolution 24-bit
 
files instead of just 60 or 70 frames.
 
     PEGGER does its job in just seconds.  We have optimized the JPEG
 
code for the Amiga.  The JPEG compress, decompress, and selection of
 
files to process run completely independent of each other.  This
 
allows both compression and decompression of files at the same time,
 
with the ability to adjust the priority of each.  A cue list of files
 
awaiting processing is maintained so that you can select additional
 
files to process while PEGGER is busy in the background processing
 
your previous selections.  In addition to selecting individual files
 
to process, entire directories of files can be set up to be batch
 
processed.
 
     You can have PEGGER execute an ARexx script prior and/or after JPEG
 
processing of a file.  This allows the integration of PEGGER's powerful
 
batch processing capabilities with other applications which support
 
ARexx.  For example, using an ARexx script to load a frame buffer
 
and activate a single frame recorder after JPEG decompression of an
 
image.
 
     The JPEG processing is performed on a small portion of the file at a
 
time, so PEGGER doesn't need megabytes of RAM to hold the entire image
 
before processing can begin. A 2000 by 3000 pixel 24 bit image takes
 
almost 30 MB of system RAM to JPEG compress or decompress with current
 
Amiga programs.  With PEGGER, less than 1 MB of system RAM is needed.
 
     Designed to run in the background, and when idle, uses few system
 
resources.  Even if your computer were to crash while PEGGER was
 
processing files, when restarted, PEGGER will continue processing
 
the files where it was interrupted.
 
 
   Features:
 
      ARexx support.
 
      Support for NewTek Framestore, 24-bit IFF, DCTV, and HAM8 images.
      
      PEGGER can process images up to 32000 pixels wide using less than
      4 MB of system RAM.
 
      AmigaDOS 2.0 & 3.0 compatible.
      
      Follows all AmigaDOS programming guidelines.
      
      Adjustable priority for JPEG compression and decompression.
      
      PEGGER is designed to multi task in the background using minimal
      system resources so a 3D rendering or graphics program can also
      run at the same time.
 
      Snoop feature allows PEGGER to compress the output of your 3D
      rendering or graphics program into a JPEG file automatically.
 
      JPEG code has been optimized for speed.
 
      PEGGER can be used with the appropriate ARexx script to single
      frame record images directly from JPEGed sequential files.
      
      
   PEGGER is a low cost alternative to a new expensive large capacity
   hard drive for animation or color graphic workstations.
