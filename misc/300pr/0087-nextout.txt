REDWOOD CITY, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 FEB 11 (NB) -- It's
official -- Next has announced it is dropping out of the
hardware game and will only market Nextstep, its graphical,
object-oriented software environment. What is new is that 
founder Steve Jobs claims the company is racing Taligent, the 
joint venture of Apple and IBM, and Microsoft for dominance of 
the next generation graphical user interface market.

Next says it will release an Intel processor version of the
Nextstep operating system on May 25, 1993. Microsoft's next
generation graphical user interface, or Windows 4.0 as some
call it, is code named "Cairo" and is expected within a year.

Taligent, which is developing a graphical user interface of the
same name, has announced it will double its work force by this
summer and is on a tight production schedule with product
expected "in the mid 1990's."

Jobs, who originally co-founded Apple Computer, said neither
Taligent or Cairo will ship until the end of 1994 and Next can
beat both companies to the punch.

In dropping the workstation hardware line introduced in 1988,
Next is reorganizing and is laying off 280 employees, leaving a
work force of 200. Canon, who owns 17.9 percent of Next, has
reportedly invested $165 million and will take over manufacture
of the Nextstep hardware. Next said it will fill the orders it
has until release of the Intel version of the Nextstep
operating system.

Next says it has a 50,000 user lead over Taligent who has yet
to release any product, but Microsoft Windows has literally
millions of users. The Intel version of the Nextstep operating
system will be released in conjunction with Nextworld Expo, 
which is set for May 25-27 in San Francisco. The new product 
will run on Intel 486- and Pentium-based personal computers 
(PCs). Intel has not yet released its next generation Pentium 
chip, but is expected to do so this year.
