FRESHFISH
=========

With new releases approximately every two months, the FreshFish CD-ROM is
designed to meet the needs of users who want copies of new releases of
material as soon as practical with a CD-ROM distribution.  Now a 2-CD set,
the FreshFish CD's are compilations of the newest programs, libraries,
documentation, animations, pictures, etc, in both archived and unarchived
(ready to run) form.

A unique feature of this CD is the extensive set of GNU and non-GNU
utilities that are included, all with full source and binaries built
directly from that source, that are ready to run directly off the CD without
having to consume hundreds of megabytes of precious disk space to install
them.

new submissions included on the first 7 volumes of the FreshFish CD series,

media.  From now on you will be able to treat CD-ROM's like any other media,
writing or deleting files, moving and snapshoting windows and icons,
changing the icon tooltype fields, replacing icons with your favorite ones,
rearranging directories, changing the default configurations of programs run
directly from the CD-ROM, saving game high scores, etc.  Minimum system
requirements: Amiga 500, A600, A1000, A1200, A1500, A2000, A2500, A3000, or

========
Guru-ROM
========

A new device driver for all GVP Series-II SCSI host adapters and all turbo
cards with a GVP SCSI host adapter.

Increasing requirements and a larger variety of available SCSI devices made
it necessary to rewrite the original GVP device driver.  The new
OMNISCSI.DEVICE driver is a portable driver for all Amigas and is first
being made available for the most widely used SCSI host adapter on the
Amiga: the GVP Series-II. It is faster and more reliable than all previous
standard SCSI device drivers, but nevertheless fully compatible to all
previously supported SCSI devices and then some.

With all of these extensions, however, the new device driver no longer fits
into the existing ROM area provided by the Series-II. It was therefore
combined with a ROM adapter that allows up to four times as much address
space as before to be addressed.

Supports series-II SCSI host adapters with and without RAM option for the
A2000/A3000/A4000, Series-II SCSI host adapter for the A500, A530 turbo card
for the A500, Combo030 turbo cards for the A2000, G-Force030 turbo cards for
the A2000, G-Force040 turbo card for the A2000, and A1208 SCSI host adapter
for the A1200.

Guru-ROM:  $79.95	(Available about 5/1/95)
