Amiga passes the test as a Web browser

By SANDY McMURRAY

 Months ago, I got e-mail from a guy named Dan Robinson. He asked when I was
going to write something about the Amiga computer. My answer was simple:
"Probably never."
 I didn't have an Amiga, and I didn't know anyone with an Amiga. Besides,
what does the Amiga have to do with the Internet?
 I remembered the Amiga as a game machine with fantastic sounds and graphics.
And somewhere in the fuzzy back of my head, I seemed to remember that
Commodore had gone out of business. Dan gave me a quick history lesson. Yes,
Commodore went out of business in 1994, but it was not the end of the Amiga.
A German company called Escom bought the Amiga and announced plans for an
affordable new Amiga called the Walker that was to debut this year. (Amiga
has been sold again since. See below.)

 HONEST REVIEW
 I was interested. Dan arranged for me to have the use of a new Amiga 1200,
supplied by Amiga retailers Comspec and National Amiga. Dan asked me to use
the machine, then write a simple, honest review of it. "If you think it's
terrible, I want you to say that it's terrible," he said. "If you think it's
great, I want you to say that."
 So here I am.
 The Amiga has always been an engineer's dream machine. Like the Macintosh,
the Amiga was years ahead of PC technology.
 When the Amiga 1000 debuted in 1985, the industry was impressed by its
custom chip set, and its excellent sound and graphics capabilities. The 1000
shipped with four-channel stereo sound and a 4096 colour output (better than
the 16 colours most computers used at the time). Years after the Amiga did
it, PC manufacturers are finally figuring out that consumers might want
stereo output (RCA plugs) from their computer.
 The Amiga was also the first computer with a true "preemptive multitasking"
operating system, which allowed it to do several things at once -- something
a Pentium running Windows 95 still can't do as well as an Amiga. And the
Amiga 1000 cost about US$2,000 when its competition -- a "singletasking" 286
PC -- cost about $4,000.
 These days, many Amiga users are into complicated image processing, 3D
modeling, etc. This is possible on the Amiga using inexpensive software and
very little memory or hard disk space.
 But my interest is the Internet connection. The Amiga 1200 is a relatively
inexpensive way to browse the World Wide Web in all its graphical glory. The
latest "IBrowse" and "AWeb" software supports HTML 3.2 commands, so you won't
feel like a second-class Web citizen. And e-mail software like YAM (short for
"Yet Another Mailer") works as well as anything I've used for the PC or Mac.
 As PC manufacturers slowly catch up with the Amiga's multimedia power, Amiga
owners bitterly lament the marketing and business mistakes that have made the
Amiga an artifact rather than Everybody's Computer. I know this is an
overused analogy, but the Amiga is like the Betamax video machine:
Technically superior, but a loser in the marketplace.
 Amiga evangelists will be pleased to know that Chicago-based Visual
Information Service Corporation (VIScorp) hopes to bring Amiga technology
into every home. VIScorp has just purchased the Amiga from Escom, and they
plan to build and market a sort of Internet appliance using Amiga technology.
See (www.vistv.com) for more information.

 NOT EASY TO USE
 My quick review would be that the Amiga 1200 is powerful, but not especially
easy to use. My parents, who are just getting used to their Macintosh, would
not be comfortable at all with the Amiga, but I think anyone with a mind for
programming or engineering would learn to love it.
 If you're interested, the Amiga is an inexpensive and powerful computer that
can get you on the Web. See (www.amigasupport.com) or call me at (416)
947-2416 for more information. I'll write more about the Amiga as I continue
to use it.
 How's that, Dan?
