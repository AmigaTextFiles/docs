Sept. 20, 1996

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

THE AMIGA ZONE MOVES FROM PORTAL TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES
------------------------------------------------------------

For over ten years the Amiga Zone has been an online resource, home,
community, oasis, for Amiga owners.

For over ten years I've made my living running the Zone and supporting Amiga
users all over the USA, Canada, and the world. 

Five years ago when American People/Link pulled their own plug, we had to
find the Zone a new home and we found a good one on the Portal Online
System. 

Well, it's happened again.. Portal has informed all of its customers that
its ten year history as an online service and Internet provider is coming to
an end on Sept. 30, 1996.  This is very sad, it's short-notice, and the
decision is completely out of my control, but it's also irreversible.  

Portal is changing its entire business plan from being an ISP to selling a
business accounting system to other online services.  

So be it. It's sad, but like I said, the Zone went through this before and
now we'll go through it again, and come out the other side better and wiser.

=====================================================
THE AMIGA ZONE IS MOVING TO CALWEB INTERNET SERVICES.
=====================================================

CalWeb (http://www.calweb.com) is a two year old Internet provider located
in Sacramento, CA.  It has a good sized customer base, and very
knowledgeable support staff. 

It's also run by a long time Amiga owner who has been a friend of mine for
many years.

The world of modeming has changed much in the last ten years. In 1985 you
had very few choices and you had 1200 baud. These days, everyone and his dog
has an ISP running and a web page

But the vast majority of them don't know an Amiga from a hole in the
ground, and could care less about Amiga owners.

CalWeb is different because it's the new home of the Amiga Zone.

In October 1996, a new custom front-end menued system will be added to
CalWeb to host the Zone. It'll have features for Zone users that neither
Plink nor Portal ever had nor were they willing to add.

The tradition of a friendly online Amiga community, run by long time Amiga
owners, users and lovers will continue.  Message bases, huge file libraries
(we plan to move over the 20,000+ files we have on the Zone on Portal to
CalWeb, MANY of which you'll never see on Aminet or anywhere else), live
nightly chats, vendor support and our famous prize contests will continue.

We've given away tens of thousands of dollars worth of Amiga prizes in the
last ten years. No one else even comes close.  

I urge any and all of you who were on Plink, or who are now on Portal or who
may have left Portal.. or even if you were never on either but used or still
use another online service to join CalWeb for the Amiga Zone.  I personally
promise you the best online Amiga community we can possibly build.  You will
not be disappointed.

I hope to see lots of you join CalWeb.  You can telnet into it from anywhere
for no hourly charges at all. Your $19.95/mo fee covers everything and also
gets you ten meg of storage which includes hosting your own personal web
page.  Naturally, when the Zone opens there, you'll have unlimited use of
all of its features and areas. Never a "money meter" clock to worry about.

Your personal or business CalWeb Web pages are maintained by you via FTP. 
It's pretty slick.  You can make a net connection to the server with any
Amiga FTP client, put your files onto it, the permissions are automatically
set (no "chmod-ing" required!) and flip to your running browser and see the
changes instantly.

The Amiga Zone's new page is already up at:
