COMMODORE ANNOUNCES AMIGA 2000 POWER UP PROGRAM
Special savings for Amiga 2000 owners on purchase of an Amiga 4000 

(West Chester, PA - May 14, 1993) Commodore Business Machines, Inc.
today announced it is offering promotional pricing on Amiga (R) 4000
series computers to owners of Amiga 2000 series computers. This Power
Up program applies to purchases of an Amiga 4000-040/120 or Amiga
4000-030/120 between May 10 and June 30, 1993. The promotional pricing
is $2349* for the A4000-040/120 and $1599 for the A4000-030/120,
representing substantial savings of $1350 and $800 respectively, based on
Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices. 

"The Power Up program is designed to position the Amiga 4000 as the
new base platform for development of future Amiga products," commented
James Dionne, Commodore President and General Manager. "By not
requiring users to trade in their A2000 computers, the promotion
protects the user's investment in software and add-on hardware while
offering advanced Amiga 4000 features at a substantial discount."

The high performance A4000-040/120 and A4000-030/120 both feature
Commodore's Advanced Graphics Architecture TM (AGA) chip set, enabling
users to display and animate graphics in multiple resolutions at up to
256,000 colors from a palette of 16.8 million. Both systems include
AmigaDOS TM Release 3, Commodore's multitasking operating system that
takes advantage of AGA features while maintaining backward compatibility
with most software developed for earlier versions of AmigaDOS. Backward
compatibility is also maintained for most peripheral products originally
designed for the Amiga 2000 or 3000 computers. 

Amiga 2000 Power Up program participants can continue to use
accelerated Amiga 2000s as rendering engines or as front-end systems for
more sophisticated A4000 applications. With the number of Video Toasters
installed in A2000s, the system becomes a profitable enhancement in
linked Video Toaster TM 4000 environments.
 
To receive the promotional pricing purchasers must provide the front
cover of their A2000 owners manual and their A2000 system serial
number. Power Up program pricing is available at the time of purchase
through a participating Commodore Authorized Reseller in the United
States.
