SYDNEY, HONGKONG, 1992 JUN 15 (NB) -- The Sydney World of Commodore show 
has grown to more than 65 Australian and international exhibitors, 
including Microsoft. It will be held on July 3, 4, and 5 at Darling 
Harbour Exhibition Centre.

Last year's high point was CDTV and this year a new Amiga model will be 
unveiled at the show. A number of manufacturers also plan to release new 
products at the show.

Opal Technology is a new company (it wasn't even in business a year ago) 
that has a range of video processing equipment for use in budget-priced 
but full-featured video special effects systems for production 
houses and TV stations. It claims a full system, including Amiga, can be 
assembled for around US$6000.

The seminar sessions include new users, education, desktop publishing, 
desktop video, electronic art and future directions of computing. There 
is no extra charge for these sessions (entrance to the show is AUS$9 per 
adult).

Following the success last year where one vendor sold almost half a 
million dollars worth of product at a "shop within a show," a number 
of retailers will be at this show with "specials."
