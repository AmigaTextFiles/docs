             "Amigan" Amiga(r) Computer Embroidered Crests

     These gorgeous 6-color embroidered crests on a black background
pay tribute to our favorite computer.  Sized at 3.75" x 4.75", they
can fit on a t-shirt, a jacket, gym bag, duffle bag, suitcase,
computer carrying case, anywhere you want to add a little color and
publicize the Amiga.

     If people ask you how they were done, you can tell them they were
designed with Deluxe Paint(tm) IV on an Amiga 2000 computer!

     Created by Computer Artist Julie Petersen, we hope these crests
(besides being neat) will heighten awareness of the Amiga and give an
attractive, professional image of the machine.

     Looking for a fund-raising idea for your users' group?  We can
print a special batch with your user group initials just above the
'm' in Amigan, or to the left and just below the checkmark.  Call us
about custom orders on quantities of 50 or more.

     Want to see what they look like?  Well, we tried getting a good
picture with a digitizer, but even in HAM, the photo didn't begin to
do the embroidery justice.  The colors are much cleaner and 'snappier'
than the enclosed ILBM file indicates, but at least you can get an
idea of what they look like.

     Place your order soon, the first run is disappearing fast and
there will be a bit of a wait to get the second printing (the place
that does them emphasizes quality, not speed).

     The price for individual orders is $7.95 ($6.95 + $1.00 S&H)
available through select dealers or from:
