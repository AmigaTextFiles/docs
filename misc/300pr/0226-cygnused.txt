CygnusEd now available directly from Cygnus Software!

Effective Aug 1 1995 Cygnus Software is now selling and supporting
CygnusEd directly.  CygnusEd, the speed-standard in Amiga text editors
was originally sold by Cygnus Software, back in 1987-1988.  Then, in
1988 ASDG took over distribution, and continued selling CygnusEd for
the next seven years.  We've now come full circle, and the very
latest version, 3.5 is available again, after a short break.

With the change in distribution comes a change in the manual.  Instead
of the printed manual, all CygnusEd documentation now comes in a
comprehensive AmigaGuide document, for easy hypertext locating of the
information that you need.

With the change in distribution also comes a change in price.  Because
we are now selling direct, and because we no longer have the overhead
of printing a manual, CygnusEd is now available for $49.95, shipping
included.

CygnusEd has long been known for having probably the fastest scrolling
and text update on the Amiga - scrolling speeds of sixty frames per
second and text output speeds of 25,000 or more characters per second
are quite common on 68000 based Amigas.  CygnusEd also has a powerful
ARexx interface, full public screen support, makes full use of all of
the standard ASL requesters (standard file, font and screen mode
requesters) which also allows CygnusEd to run on all screen modes,
including AGA and most third party graphics boards.
