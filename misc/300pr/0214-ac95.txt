     In August, in Montreal, the third annual Amiga Convention will take
place!  This convention will gather the Amiga community together from all
across the world to show its support for the Amiga!  We hope to make this
show the first event in the long fight to make the Amiga a well known
computer in North America again.  


WHY:  We are putting on the Amiga Convention '95 (AC 95) to support our
      favorite computer, the Amiga!  We feel that for too long, the Amiga
      has been ignored, and now that the Amiga is owned by people who
      actually will support it well, we want to help them out in any way we
      can.  We also want to get a lot of people together to have a really
      cool time!

COST FOR RENTING TABLES : $100 - 1 day,  $150 - 2 days, for one table of 
                          6' by 3' and chairs.  
                          You may do whatever you want to at the rented
                          tables.  These tables are aimed towards dealers
                          and developers.
                          
FREE TABLES:  We will also have free tables at AC'95, for anyone who wishes
              to bring their Amiga, whether to show off something cool, or
              just to help someone else who might need one at the time.
              However, at the free tables you get less space than the pay
              tables, it is first-come first-serve, and you cannot sell
              products at the tables!  That is strictly for the rented
              tables.

                          
ACCESABILITY:  The show is easily accesable by bus and train, as well as
               having lots of parking space in the vicinity for cars.

WHY DEALERS SHOULD COME:  At AC'95, we offer tables at an incredibly cheap
                          price, a price which includes electrical outlets.
                          You also get the chance to show and sell your
                          wares to a crowd of Amiga owners, all of whom
                          have money to spend and are influenced by how big
                          a prescence you have at the show.

WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME:   AC'95 will have stands from many major dealers
                          and developers.  It will also have a lot of
                          friendly Amiga owners there, plus a booming sound
                          system and TV setup that will show crazy demos
                          and products.  It will be a wild good time for
                          all!
