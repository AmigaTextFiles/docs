AmiTrix                   PRESS RELEASE                January 02, 1996
=======================================================================

          Amiga-Link/Envoy Networking Package Price Reduction
          ---------------------------------------------------

AmiTrix Development is pleased to announced they have just reduced the
price of their Amiga-Link/Envoy networking package for all Amigas.


Amiga-Link is a complete solution to your Amiga peer-to-peer networking
needs. With the included software and hardware, you can share your hard
drives, printers, and also run other network applications as well. The
package is compatible with all Amigas, using the external floppy port
for maximum compatibility across all models, while keeping the rest of
the ports available for their intended uses.

The Amiga-Link package comes with both the standard AmigaLink software
and also the Amiga Envoy software.  The Amigalink software's advantage
is that it works with Amiga WB 1.3, providing compatibility with older
machines.  Amiga Envoy requires 2.04 or higher, but provides superior
reliability, device sharing, and an API that allows for the development
of third-party networking applications, with many already available.


New MSRP for the basic 2 unit package is $275.00 US, or $350.00 CAN.


Expansion kits, floppy port splitters, cable options and accesories 
are also available.

Dealer and Educational Institution inquiries welcomed.
