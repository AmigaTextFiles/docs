I noticed that the Dutch Escom pages were updated. The list of shops
selling Amigas has been expanded and some new products have been listed.
Since these products have as yet been little more than rumours, I'll
present a translation of the newspage below.
 
Please note that:
-things between [] are my comments
-these pages can be found somewhere at http://www.escom.nl/
-prices are in guilders (Hfl)
-a guilder is something of US$ .62, AUS$ .83, DM .90 and UK# .40.
-prices in the US will be probably a little higher and in those in Germany
   a little lower because of shipping costs and taxes

   at least two sockets for SIMM modules, a 68030 processor (speed and

   The new Amiga will probably be available in the 3rd quarter of 1996.

Amiga 4000T with Motorola 68060 processor /50 Mhz

   1996 including Mac roms and the Emplant emulation software.
 
The Amiga set top box
   A set top box based on Amiga technology is planned for fall 1996. This
   set top box is meant for in the living room, so that the video recorder

   keyboard with built-in mouse will be controlled using infra red.
   More news to follow.

   The Power Amiga, a new Amiga series, is expected in the second quarter
   of 1997. Prices and specs will follow as soon as they're known.

I have undoubtedly made some mistakes when translating, so feel free
to question me about anything doubtful.
