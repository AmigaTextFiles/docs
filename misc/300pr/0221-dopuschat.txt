On August 27, 1995, Amiga Report Magazine will be holding an IRC 
conference with Jon Potter, author of the expansive DirOpus 5 directory
organizer/Workbench replacement program.

The conference is scheduled to begin at 5:30 PM EST (8:00 AM August 28th
for those in Potter's neck of Australia) on EFNet IRC.

All participants should meet in IRC channel #amiga.  The name of the
conference channel will be announced there.

[This conference replaces the one cancelled for July 30th.]
