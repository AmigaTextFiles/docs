Mand2000 CD-ROM now available from Micro R&D!

	Mand2000 was widely hailed as having an innovative interface that
combined raw speed with real time zooming and multi-pass updating to make
fractal exploration easier, faster and more fun than ever before.  Double
click on an interesting area and it animates out towards you - real time
zoom, even on 68000 based Amigas.

	And that was just version 1.0!  Version 2.0 added direct Anim5
support and added displaying of 24-bit fractals on ALL Amigas.  Yes,
with Mand2000 2.0, an Amiga 1000 with a 7Mhz 68000 can do real time
animated zooms on 24-bit fractals (displayed in HAM, HAM8, or dithered
256 colours).

	Mand2000 also takes full advantage of 68020, '030 and '040
processors, with special code optimized for each of these processors.
Mand2000 also has a full complement of asynchronous requesters for
controlling Mand2000 while it continues calculating, and can be used to
create julia seed animations, 'morph' animations, iteration animations,
and zoom animations, either calculating every frame, or calculating key
frames, to be tweened on playback.  Mand2000 also supports just about
every graphics board out there, has full online help, and is just
generally cool

	But this posting isn't about Mand2000.  This is about a new
product, the Mand2000 CD-ROM.  This CD-ROM for the Amiga comes with the
full release copy of Mand2000 of course.  But that's just the beginning.
We also put over 200MBytes of still images, and over 30,000 frames of
spectacular animations, all in a wide variety of resolutions, on this
CD-ROM.  600+MBytes of IFF data, ANIM5 animations and fractal locations.

	A project like this might not have been practical on any other
platform.  Working together with the people at Micro R&D we put
Mand2000's powerful ARexx interface and the Amiga's flawless
multitasking to work.  Just one ARexx script might calculate ten
separate animations, each render at six different resolutions, and each
consisting of hundreds of different frames.  While our Amiga 4000's
powerful 68040 chip was churning through these calculations, we'd be
creating and testing new scripts in another copy of Mand2000.  As each
script was finished it would be tacked onto the list of chores, so that
the CPU didn't get to take a break for weeks.  Tens of trillions of
floating point operations were required for this CD-ROM.  One image
alone took over five weeks of Amiga 4000 compute time to calculate.

	All of this, including the actual scripts used to create it,
can be yours for $59.95.  Contact Micro R&D or Cygnus Software for
ordering information.
