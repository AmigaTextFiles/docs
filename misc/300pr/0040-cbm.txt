A few days ago, someone posted some proprietary Commodore copyrighted
files meant only for the eyes of registered Amiga developers, to 
the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.amiga.advocacy.  It was illegal to
post these files but the person did it anyway with full knowledge
of what he was doing, even admitting what he was doing.  This morning,
(6 Aug) a plea from CATS/Commodore was posted to that group asking that
all systems which had those articles posted to them delete them and
that anyone finding them on any other systems notify CATS of same.
Here is CATS' posting.

                 NOTICE TO THE READERS OF THIS CONFERENCE

                   REGARDING MATERIALS WHICH WERE POSTED


Documents which appear to contain copyrighted confidential Amiga developer
information were posted to comp.sys.amiga.advocacy on 03-Aug-1992 and
04-Aug-1992, apparently by:

    rutgers!mcdhup!pdnfido!mikeh (mikeh@pdnfido.fidonet.org) (Mike Herzog)
and rutgers!psuvax1!uxa.ecn.bgu.edu!garrot.DMI.USherb.CA!vailm00
    (vailm00@DMI.USherb.CA) (MARC VAILLANCOURT).

The posted documents display Commodore copyright notices and are also
marked preliminary and confidential.  The distribution of copyrighted
materials is a violation of copyright laws.  Persons who distribute
such materials may also be responsible for such damages as are incurred
by Commodore as a result of this unlawful distribution.

To the extent that such documents might contain actual confidential
and preliminary developer information, please be aware that improper
or unlawful distribution of such information could severely limit
our ability to provide timely preliminary and confidential information
to our registered developers in the future.


If you see these documents or any other documents or files which appear
to be unauthorized copies of copyrighted or confidential Commodore
materials posted anywhere, please do the following:


1. Please forward copies of any text files and all header lines to:

   UUCP: davidm@cbmvax.commodore.com (uunet!cbmvax!davidm)
     or  BIX: david.miller

   (Please do not send copies of executables - just send any
   header or description lines describing their origin or poster.
   Also, please do not send us copies of the Herzog and Vaillancourt
   postings in comp.sys.amiga.advocacy - we already have those).

   Please also provide a full path to the system and directory
   (if applicable).  If it is on an ftp site, please provide the fully
   qualified name (such as cbmvax.commodore.com) and a full path and
   filename for the files.  If the files are found on a dial-in bulletin
   board, please also provide name and location of the board, dial-in
   phone number, and voice information phone number if possible.
   Please also provide the name of the sysop, moderator, or system
   administrator.

2. Please delete the files and/or messages containing the files,
   and ensure that they are not distributed to other systems.
   If you do not have authority to delete the files or messages,
   please contact the sysop, moderator, or system administrator of
   the system, inform them that there are illegally distributed
   files on their system, and ask them to please remove them and
   prevent their further distribution.



         Thank you

Upon reading this I immediately contacted Portal and had them delete
the subject illegal postings. They are no longer on The Portal System.
Please clip out Carolyn's article and spread it as far and wide as
you can... put it on all your local BBSes and in your user group
newsletters. If you see the offending files posted to other systems
(and believe me, you will know when you see them) get them removed.

Do NOT ask me to show you the deleted postings and do NOT post or
circulate them anywhere on Portal if you possess them, and if you
possess them and you are not a registered Amiga developer, then
get rid of them please.

The totally irresponsible action by one fool who posted these texts
to Usenet has the potential to radically alter the way CBM treats
developers and in fact, WHO they let BE developers.
It isn't going to do anyone any good. 

Please help do what you can. Thanks, 
Harv
