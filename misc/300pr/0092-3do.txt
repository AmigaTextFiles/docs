SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 MAR 10 (NB) -- 3DO, the new
company started by Tripp Hawkins, founder of computer game
company Electronic Arts, is planning to go public. Company
officials confirmed to Newsbytes the filing has been made, but
the actual prospectus information on the offering won't be
available until next week.

3DO received the spotlight at the Winter Consumer Electronics
show with its introduction of a new digital consumer format
which it plans to offer to manufacturers and software
engineers. The company already has AT&T, Panasonic, Matsushita,
MCA, and Time Warner signed up for producing products for the
new "Interactive Multiplayer" which is expected to be the home
entertainment center for the 90s.

Company officials say the plans for the Interactive Multiplayer
are on schedule, but are not saying much more. At last check,
Panasonic was waiting for FCC approval in order to release the
first Interactive Multiplayers this summer. The Multiplayers
are based on a 32-bit reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
chip from Los Gatos, California-based Advanced RISC Machines
(ARM) and use a compact disc (CD) format.

Capable of workstation-like graphics manipulation, the
Multiplayers are capable of movie playback, play of Kodak Photo
CDs, and of course, entertainment titles.

When asked why 3DO chose now to file for an IPO, representative
Diane Hunt told Newsbytes the company needs funds and raising
funds in the public market is the appropriate course at this
time.
