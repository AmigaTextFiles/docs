           NEW PRODUCT ALLOWS EASY MAC/AMIGA FILE TRANSFERS


Media4 Productions has announced the release of MacDOS(TM), a new

software package for the Commodore(R) Amiga(R).  MacDOS is a

complete software-only system which allows Amiga users to easily

and transparently access Apple(R) Macintosh(R) formatted hard drives

and high-density floppies.  This software is of tremendous benefit

to anyone moving data between Mac and Amiga platforms--perfect for

video, graphics, database, publishing, audio, word processing, and

more.  According to Brian Landwehr, president of Media4 Productions,

"...this sort of product is long overdue.  Amigas and Macs complement

each another nicely, but, until now, the only common ground for data

transfer has been IBM formatted floppies.  MacDOS even makes sharing

a hard drive painless, and it works with any Amiga software."



Data manageable enough to fit on Mac high-density floppies can be

read and written by any Amiga high-density floppy drive.  Large

volumes of data can be shared by simply unplugging an external hard,

optical, floptical, or other standard SCSI drive from one machine's

SCSI port and plugging it into the other.  A Mac formatted disk that

appears as "Macintosh HD" on the Mac's desktop will also appear as

"Macintosh HD" on the Amiga's Workbench(R) and in Amiga file requesters.



Also, there's no need for tedious manual creation of mountlist files

in order to describe the specifications of the Mac drive to the Amiga's

operating system, because the MacDOS package includes MacDOS Mounter,

which will automatically search a specified SCSI drive and offer to

mount any Mac partitions found--no editing of configuration files is

necessary.  MacDOS Mounter will even allow access to A-Max(TM) and

Emplant(TM) partitions on Amiga formatted hard drives.



MacDOS requires any model of Amiga with Workbench 2.04 or higher, and

either a high-density floppy drive or a SCSI port, depending on the

type of media to be shared.  MacDOS will work with any typical Mac

formatted hard drive, optical, floptical, CD-ROM, Bernoulli or SyQuest.



Media4 Productions is based in West Des Moines, Iowa, and has been

developing software for personal computers for more than ten years.

Much of their development is centered around tools for film and video

production.
