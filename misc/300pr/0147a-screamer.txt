Here's another of NewTek's NAB/Vegas press releases. By the way, today
the exhibit halls opened and at the Video Toaster User magazine
booth they were handing out a 16 page glossy mini magazine called
"VTU Special Report" which goes into mucho detail about NT's
NAB showing, the Flyer, and an interview with Jenison in which
he discusses the departure of Paul Montgomery and the others who
left just a few weeks ago, so this little issue is very current -
I suppose (tho I'm not sure) that VTU Subscribers will be getting
a copy of this in the mail - I don't know how non subbers will
get it unless it shows up at Toaster/Amiga dealers or you call
VTU and ask for a copy (they're at 1-800-322-2843). 

(By the way - you don't have to read between the lines to 
realize that the Screamer, as a hardware product, is now
no more... after its splashy introduction at SIGGRAPH just
last August. Things change fast in this biz!)

NewTek Press Release
NEWTEK, INC ANNOUNCES SCREAMERNET RENDERING SOFTWARE FOR
LIGHTWAVE 3D PROFESSIONALS

Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 - NewTek, Inc., the company that brought
professional video and animation production to the masses with the
Video Toaster introduces ScreamerNet for LightWave 3D users.

ScreamerNet is the evolution of the Screamer rendering hardware
announced last August. "As we pursued development of the Screamer
hardware it became evident that high speed processors were
quickly becoming commodity items," said NewTek President Tim
Jenison.  "Rather than NewTek trying to keep up with the 
hardware wars we decided to release software that will allow
LightWave users to select the rendering machine of their
choice."

ScreamerNet is a rendering software package that allows LightWave 3D
users to take advantage of the rendering power offered by
workstations from a variety of vendors.  The software is Windows NT
compatible and will support hardware that utilizes Intel, MIPS, and
DEC Alpha processor chips.  ScreamerNet's suggested retail price is
$1995 and will support up to eight machines.

LightWave 3D has become the animation package of choice for most
of the cutting edge action shows in Hollywood," stated Jenison.
"Television programs such as seaQuest DSV, Star Trek: The 
Next Generation, Babylon 5 and RoboCop are using the Video
Toaster and LightWave 3D to push the envelope of visual effects.
With the introduction of ScreamerNet they will have access to
the rendering power they need to completely redefine the
standards for effects in television and film production."

"As the makers of revolutionary products like Video Toaster
and the new Video Toaster Flyer, NewTek means high technology
at an unbelievably low price point," said NewTek's Marketing
Director Donetta Colboch.  "While ScreamerNet represents a
dramatic breakthrough in 3D rendering price/performance, it's
designed and priced for the professional animation facility."

NewTek will be showcasing the ScreamerNet software at the 
National Association of Broadcasters Convention, March 21-24
in Booth #11050.
