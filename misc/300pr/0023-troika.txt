Comments: I received a copy of this CDTV title from Troika today.
You can look forward to seeing a full review of it in my column
in an upcoming issue of .info Magazine.  It's VERY well done
and the low price makes it extremely attractive. 

This is the first actual release CDXL CDTV title I've seen.
Interesting stuff.
