	MegaBall4

Drexel Hill, PA (26 October, 1995) Intangible Assets Manufacturing today
announced that it is shipping the new Amiga game MegaBall4.

MegaBall4 is classic Amiga brick-busting action in a brand new commercial
package.  The Mackey Brothers (famous authors of Ball and MegaBall) dazzle
you with exploding blocks, plus poofing, growing, locking, unlocking, and
green-sliming bricks as well. The fast-paced play and devious
interactions will challenge your mind as well as your mouse.  Experience
the thrill that has kept Amiga users glued to their monitors for more than
half a decade. Includes three disks packed full of new action and new
music!  Includes board editor. Compatible with all Amigas (requires 1.3),
enhanced when used with AGA. Requires 1mb RAM. List Price $30.


Includes special free fourth bonus disk: Ami-FileSafe Floppy.

	Upgrades

MegaBall4 is the first commercial release of this product, and games
aren't typically upgradeable anyway.  Still, we at IAM want to give
something to those who made the effort to register earlier shareware
versions with Ed and Al. In North America, you can receive 10% off your
total of an order of any IAM products directly from IAM.  To be fair to
our dealers, such orders must include proof of MegaBall registration, and
must be received by mail, email or fax at IAM no later than November 20,
1995. (Sorry, but we can't make such an offer outside North America
because of our exclusive distribution arrangements.)
