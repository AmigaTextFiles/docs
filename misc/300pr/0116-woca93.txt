Here is the official schedule of Seminars for the World of Commodore
Amiga Show, put on by Ramige Management Group, to be held

Where:
The Pasadena Center
300 East Green Street
Pasadena, CA USA 91101

When:
Sept. 10-12, 1993

Note: I'm posting this in the public interest. I'm not involved with
Ramige Management Group.  I plan to attend all three days of this show
and hope to see/meet you there if you are too.  Portal won't have a
booth.  Just me and a few of my fellow Sysops wandering around with
glazed looks. 

This article is *NOT* reprinted by permission of anyone's "4 minute
news". User Group newsletter editors take note: typing in someone else's
press releases and then claiming ownership of them and demanding reprint
credits is, at best, an odious act. 

This schedule was mailed to me. I scanned it with my Epson ES300C flatbed
scanner using ASDG's ADPro Epson driver, then imported the saved IFF
monochorme scans into MiGraph's OCR software and let it chew on them and
spit out ASCII text. Spellchecking and reformatting were then done with
WordPerfect for the Amiga, that horrible & obsolete software that's still
(IMHO) the best all-around workhorse Amiga word processor :-) 

Any errors or miSpiLlenGZ are purely unintentional.

Not responsible. Park and lock it.
