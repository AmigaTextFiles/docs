IAM is proud to announce that MRBackup has been sold by Mark Rinfret
and it is now published by IAM. Robert Hardy will be supporting and
continuing the development of the product. It is no longer available as
shareware. We've already made a few improvements, and are now shipping
MRBackup 2.5 to customers.

If you need a backup program that is still supported and developed on
the Amiga, we urge you to consider purchasing MRBackup. Buy DiskSalv4 at
the same time and save! PLEASE spread the word. It's hard for Amiga
companies to get the message out about new products these days...

MRBackup 2.5 sells for US$60 + s/h (or US$10 + s/h for upgrades from
previous registered versions). It is also available in a special package
deal with DiskSalv4 (shipping now) for only US$80 -- a savings of $20 on
the two products!

For more information, see below. You can also write to mrbackup@iam.com,
see our web pages at http://www.iam.com/, or download our AmigaGuide
catalog file via anon FTP to file://ftp.iam.com/biz/iam/

IAM publishes "Connect Your Amiga! A Guide to the Internet, LANs, BBSs
and Online Services" (second printing, revised for 1996, shipping now),
"Eight Freely Redistributable Disks to Connect Your Amiga!",
"MegaBall4", "The Deathbed Vigil", and "Amiga Envoy 2.0b."  It also
distributes DICE in North America.

[If you maintain a BBS or other archive of freely redistributable
software, please remove any old versions of MRBackup -- they are no
longer freely redistributable. We plan to release a demo version of 2.5
soon.]

Details follow:

--

MRBackup is an Amiga hard disk backup program with friendly graphical
interface and extensive ARexx support. You need a backup program to:

  *   Protect your valuable files against loss
  *   Remove rarely-used files from your harddrive, freeing up needed
      harddrive space
  *   Transfer larger-than-fits-on-one-floppy files between systems

MRBackup provides a wide range of services to support Amiga file
management and backup/restore of files to/from hard disk. Files can be
backed
up to:

  *   Floppy disk, in AmigaDOS format
  *   Floppy disk, in a special "fast" format
  *   Any sequential file or device (local or networked) in "fast"
      format
  *   SCSI streaming tape

MRBackup was originally written by Mark Rinfret nearly ten years ago.
During the program's long history, with the suggestions of many
thousands of Amiga users, it has evolved a great deal of stability,
functionality, and ease-of-use. As of June, 1996, MRBackup is published
by IAM, who is proud to add MRBackup to its fine line of Amiga products,
and to add to its stable of outstanding Amiga authors Mr. Robert Hardy
of HardKore Software. Bob is the new owner of the source code for
MRBackup, and will be providing support for new and existing customers,
bug fixes and future development. He has already produced version 2.5
and started work on version 3.

MRBackup is designed to behave well in your Amiga's multi-tasking
environment. It does not "take over the machine" and will allow you to
use your Amiga for other activities while backups are being performed.
MRBackup is controlled by a flexible set of user-configurable parameters
and offers a wide range of backup and restore options. Its
Intuition-based user interface is designed for a pleasing appearance and
ease of operation.

MRBackup provides a complete and powerful ARexx interface through which
you can access most operating parameters and features. Automate
complex backup procedures through relatively simple rexx macros. Launch
ARexx macros separately or from the Macros Menu. Run multiple
"copies" of MRBackup, with a unique ARexx port name for each instance of
MRBackup.

MRBackup uses the Amiga's speech capabilities to provide an effective
means for presenting prompts, error conditions and requests for floppy
disk insertions, etc. While DEVS:narrator.device and
LIBS:translator.library are no longer shipped with the Amiga operating
system, you can copy them from your older copies of the AmigaDOS
installation disks and they will work just fine.

MRBackup provides optional data compression which will reduce the number
of diskettes (or other media) required for a backup. A saveset catalog
file is created for each saveset, allowing quick retrieval of individual
files when necessary. Should the catalog file become damaged or lost,
MRBackup can recreate it by scanning the saveset.

Requirements

The following minimum requirements should be met in order to assure
proper operation of MRBackup:

  *   any Amiga system with at least 1 MB memory and AmigaDOS 2.04 or
      higher
  *   1 floppy disk drive or SCSI streaming tape drive (Archive Viper,
      Wangtek 50XX, TEAC 36XX, Sony DAT, etc.)
  *   MRBackup will work with any hard drive supported by the AmigaDOS
      operating system
