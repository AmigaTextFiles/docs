PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 SEP 10 (NB) -- Commodore
Business Machines will announce its new 32-bit game console,
the Amiga Compact Disc 32 (CD32) at the Amiga World Show today
in Pasadena, California. The Amiga CD32 offers a double-speed
compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) drive, Commodore's
Advanced Graphics Architecture chip set, and can display and
animate graphics in 256,000 colors, according to reports from
the company.

The unit is designed for connection to a television set and
offers a hand-held 11-button controller as well as connectors
for standard Amiga peripherals such as mouse, joystick, and
keyboard. Commodore claims titles from its previous game
system, CDTV, can be played on the CD32 as well as new titles,
some of which are expected as early as October.

Acclaim's Mortal Kombat, Ocean Software's Jurassic Park,
Gremlin Graphics' Zool 2, and Psygnosis' Microcosm games are a
few of the many titles Commodore listed as already in
development for CD32. The company says it encourages
development for its hardware without the requirement of
official licenses, unlike cartridge-based systems. The company
claims 50 to 100 titles are expected for the system by the
holiday season this year.
