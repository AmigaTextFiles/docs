Here's some interesting/ugly (choose one) news about Creative
Computers. 

1. Their half Mac/half Amiga "superstore" in Lawndale CA is now
 about 7/8 Mac and 1/8 Amiga. They have two A4000 demo units
 on display but none to sell. In fact,
2. They have NO Amigas in stock to sell at all, according to 
 one of their sales guys. If you walked into their shop today,
 right now, with money falling out of your pockets, and wanted
 to buy an Amiga you would walk out empty handed.
3. Their other "superstores" mentioned in their ads have been
 100% Mac for three months.
4. They are not ordering any merchandise from distributors on
 which they don't get a guaranteed return policy.
5. They are not restocking the remaining shelves of the Amiga
 fraction of the Lawndale shop at all, anymore.
6. On the day the C= liquidation article appeared in the L.A. Times,
 one of the Creative sales guys brought it into the store and
 showed it to the service manager who said "Holy Shit!" and called
 up Frank, the owner, who, half an hour later, called back the
 store manager and told him to shut down the Amiga side of the
 store and reassign all the salesguys to the mail order dept
 (in another building about 5 miles away). Some of them went.
 One of them said "forget it" and stayed at the store. Then the
 decision was made to leave the store open but not re-stock it
 and to scale it down to its tiny fraction of square footage and
 move MacStuff into the rest of it.

So the end result is that due to the owner's/beancounter's panic
reaction to the C= liquidation notice, Creative, which has for
years done everything they could to undercut and put other Amiga
dealers out of business, is now a heartbeat away from selling
no Amigas at all themselves, and just as close to dropping all
Amiga-related sales.

My one wish is that a strong co. buys out Commodore, revvs up
Amiga production, and Creative is left with egg on its face - they
don't deserve any better.
