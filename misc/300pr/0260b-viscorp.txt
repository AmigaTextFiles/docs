related to this thread so..

What I have been telling people is not to worry.  We are all
Amiga lovers here.  Unlike ESCOM or even Commodore, VIScorp
does not have a single IBM PC person in the development group.  
We are all solid Amigans from the very beginning.  Personally
speaking, I don't plan on killing the Amiga.  In fact, I'm
hoping to build one killer Amiga!

PS: Please feel free to post or forward this anywhere and
everywhere, as I am getting swamped with the same email
question from so many dedicated Amigans.  Keep the faith!
This is for the better!
