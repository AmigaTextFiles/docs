GENERAL COMMENTS:


Hope to see you at the show.  Don't forget to bring your computer
items you wish to sell.  G.A.C. will have a consignment table.
You can place your items at this table, after you tag them with
our tags.  Items sold will be assessed a 10% fee on the selling price.  
Items not sold, will have no charge.  This is another great deal, as most 
companiers charge 20% and a fee to even place things there

This years show is bigger and better than last years, and it was
enjoyed by all.  This show involved six months of hard work, and I know 
you will be happy with it.

Sincerely,

Bob Scharp
Chairman
