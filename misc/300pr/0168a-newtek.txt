NewTek, Inc. announces ScreamerNet rendering 
software for LightWave 3D professionals

Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 - NewTek, Inc., the company that brought 
professional video and animation production to the masses with the Video 
Toaster introduces ScreamerNet for LightWave 3D users.

ScreamerNet is the evolution of the Screamer rendering hardware 
announced last August.  "As we pursued development of the Screamer 
hardware it became evident that high speed processors were quickly becoming  
commodity items."  said NewTek President Tim Jenison.  "Rather than 
NewTek trying to keep up with the hardware wars we decided to release 
software that will allow LightWave users to select the rendering machine of 
their choice."

ScreamerNet is a rendering software package that allows LightWave 3D users 
to take advantage of the rendering power offered by workstations from a 
variety of vendors. The software is Windows NT compatible and will support 
hardware that utilizes Intel, MIPS and DEC Alpha processor chips. 
ScreamerNet's suggested retail price is $1995 and will support up to eight 
machines.

"LightWave 3D has become the animation package of choice for most of the 
cutting edge action shows in Hollywood," stated Jenison. "Television 
programs such as seaQuest DSV, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5 
and RoboCop are using the Video Toaster and LightWave 3D to push the 
envelope of visual effects. With the introduction of ScreamerNet they will 
have access to the rendering power they need to completely redefine the 
standards for effects in television and film production."

"As the makers of revolutionary products like Video Toaster and the new 
Video Toaster Flyer,  NewTek means high technology at an unbelievably low 
price point," said NewTek's Marketing Director Donetta Colboch. "While 
ScreamerNet represents a dramatic breakthrough in 3D rendering 
price/performance, it's designed and priced for the professional animation 
facility."

NewTek will be showcasing the ScreamerNet software at the National 
Association of Broadcasters Convention, March 21-24 in Booth #11050.
