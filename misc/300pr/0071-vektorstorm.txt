You can't travel through a Black Hole and survive, according to Stephen
Hawking, the Cambride University astrophysicist. But if you could "come out"
on the other side, what kind of a universe would you find? That's the premise
of Vektor Storm, the first Amiga entertainment software title from the new
INOVAgames division at INOVAtronics.

Vektor Storm makes you commander of a small space exploration fleet that
accidentally falls through a Black Hole. On the other side, reality is turned
upside down as you discover an alternate, fragmented universe where truth is
false and right is wrong. Even the very laws of physics have changed. Lurking
in the infinite darkness, an army of nasty alien life forms waits to destroy
you and your fleet.

To return to this universe, you and your ships must first meet the challenge
set before you by your alien adversaries -- beat them at their own game. Your
four ships must fight against an arsenal of intelligent weapons on a series
of battlegrids. The rules are simple; the stakes are life and death itself!

Vektor Storm is fast-paced action with dizzying perspectives, graphics,
animation and impressive stereophonic sound. Priced at $39.95, Vektor Storm
is available now and runs on any Amiga computer with at least 512K RAM,
running Kickstart version 1.3 or higher, including machines running AmigaDOS
2.0.
