To All Amiga Desktop Publishers and Mr William Callis

In reply to a posting by William Callis about the availablity of
ProPage.

In August 1995, LH Publishing, an Amiga based business in the UK,
took over the publishing under licence of Gold Disk's premier desktop
publishing program, Professional Page.  

ProPage 4.1 is now selling for fourty nine pounds and ninty five pence
(49.95) with new manuals,  written by Larry Hickmott (yours truly).
Anyone wanting further information can email me at the following
address;

	larry@em.powernet.co.uk

Anyone worried about ProPage  working on the new Amigas (Workbench
3.1), the good news is, it works fine. You can also see a review of it
in Amiga Shopper (December Issue) along with reviews of other word
processors and desktop publishing programs. 

For those that subscribe to Em (Amiga DTP magazine), more details are
in issue 7 and 8 (coming soon)

Those reading this wanting me to post full details in
Amiga.applications, let us know and we will do so.

Larry Hickmott
Head Honcho at of LH Publishing
