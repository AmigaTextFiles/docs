This is not a press release, per se, but this seemed like an appropriate
place to put it since there may not only be interested job seekers here
who qualify, but it also indicates an upturn in optimism if Commodore
is actually hiring new engineers :)

       =====================================================
       | Amiga Graphics Software Development	- Permanent |
       =====================================================
 
 
Commodore Amiga Software Engineering has several full time software
engineering openings in the area of Amiga graphics:
 
The ideal candidate has a background as a developer of graphics
intensive applications on the Amiga or other platforms. Experience
with Amiga graphics (graphics.library) and Amiga chipsets (ECS and AA)
is a plus, but not a requirement.
 
The candidate should have a strong background in raster graphics,
including up-to-date understanding, and preferably experience with,
current popular graphics architectures and devices in the personal
computer market. Working knowledge of 3D graphics and video standards
and issues is a definite plus.
 
C language and/or 68k assembly experience is required, and Amiga
or multitasking OS development experience is strongly desired.
Experience with low-level system programming is desired.
 
As a member of the graphics team the individual will:
 - develop next generation graphics.library for new chipsets.
 - contribute to new chip design
 - participate in architecting new OS's.
 
If your skill set and experience doesn't exactly match the lists above,
feel free to forward your resume anyway, since I will be looking for
other types of software engineers in the near future.
 
The successful applicant will be hard working, self-motivated and able
to work well with peers. Writing and communications skills are a definite
plus.
 
As a member of a small entrepreneurial team, each engineer is a
significant contributor through the actual market introduction of
his/her product. As a member of a large international corporation,
each engineer benefits from the resources that Commodore can provide.
 
			AND
 
you're working with the Amiga, a pioneer in multitasking, GUI and
multimedia. Become a member of the strong, innovative team wich
developed AmigaOS.
 
For immediate consideration, please send resume, including applicable
experience and salary history, to:
