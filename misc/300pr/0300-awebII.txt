            AWeb-II, v2.1 to be released in October!
            ----------------------------------------

AmiTrix Development is pleased to announce the release of version 2.1 of
the popular WWW Browser "AWeb" by Yvon Rozijn.  This update, which is free
to customers that have purchased the current v2.0 AWeb-II package, will be
available in October.  A final date will be announced in a following press
release, and registered owners of v2.0 will be notified by email when the
update is ready and how to obtain it.

We would also like to correct some misunderstanding due to the release of
v1.5 of AWeb to registered users of the previous shareware version.  That
was in fact, still a beta version of the program which was made available
to them for further testing before the commercial release was finalized.
There was no intent to keep our commercial customers waiting, rather we
wish to insure that the update is as reliable as possible.

Version 2.1 of AWeb-II will include the following additions:

- Full HTML 3.2 support including tables, fully configurable cache with
  browser, configuration/settings window re-designed and split into three
  sections for improved access, separate control of image and backgrounds
  display, support for client side maps and floating images, access to 
  ClassAct prefs, text search function, graphical print function, more 
  ARexx commands, additional mime types, replaceable button images and
  transfer animation, greyscale palette support, improved speed and memory
  usage, added compatibility for non-standard HTML code, and many other
  improvements.

- Revised and improved ARexx plug-ins.

                          Piracy Warning!!!
                          =================

It has come to our attention that pirated versions of both the current
shareware and commercial versions of AWeb are being spread on some BBS's.
In addition, some have even offered these for sale as alleged registered
versions of the program.  

Customers should beware of such scams and be advised that AWeb-II is only
available from authorized dealers, or directly from us.  If in doubt,
contact us at any of the addresses below for further information.  Only
customers with a valid copy registered with AmiTrix will be eligible for
technical support and future upgrades.

We urge everyone to support the remaining Amiga developers and dealers by
buying Amiga products.
