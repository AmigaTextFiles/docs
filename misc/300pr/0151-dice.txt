    Well, it's finally ready!  It's only taken a few years more then
    I expected :-), but we finally got the commercial DICE together
    and are now shipping it.  Turnaround time should be much better
    then the registered release since the whole O.I.C. crew is involved
    rather then just me.

    So as not to take up too much bandwidth, and because some people get
    rather rabid about 'commercial' postings, our official press release
    is available through an automatic server response if you send mail
    to 'info@oic.COM', see below.  Pay special attention to the pricing
    and mailing address for O.I.C., orders no longer go to my home address.

    It is unfortunate that Commodore has seemingly begun to crumble, but 
    that does not change the fact that the Amiga has a large user and,
    comparitively, huge developer base.  We are committed to that base,
    not to Commodore.  Whether the gainsayers are right or wrong, the Amiga
    is likely to have a good market for many years to come.

    I, personally, have always been dedicated to writing software and 
    basically giving it away, and although that doesn't work when you are 
    trying to build a company, our dedication at O.I.C. will always be to
    our customers and to the developer community in general for all 
    platforms we eventually create products for.

Thank you for your interest in DICE.  This is an automated response that
we hope answers the most common questions.  If you need a personal reply,
an email address is given below.

DICE is currently undergoing the transition to a full commercial release,
complete with 450 page manual.  The new DICE compiler is part of an
integrated "system" of programming tools -- DICE now seamlessly integrates
with your favorite text editor, offering tools and information at the touch
of a button.  Many exciting upgrades and fixes are in the commercial
release.

A limited "freeware" edition of DICE will continue to be available at no
cost.  Owners of the registered version of DICE will be offered a $75.00
discount on upgrades to the commercial version.  Special prices are also
available for students and owners of the SAS/C compiler.

Send email to "info@oic.COM" for the latest information about DICE, updated
weekly.  Send email to "sales@oic.COM" if you have specific questions, but
be aware it may take several days to get a response.

This has been a recording.  Beep!
