The Amiga A4000T units have shipped.

The first shipment of A4000T systems are on their way to dealers. 
Volume supplies should ramp up very quickly.

Please note:  Not all dealers who claim to have ordered systems have 
placed orders.  If you intend to purchase a systems BE CAREFUL.  We 
have had reports of customers prepaying unauthorized dealers for 
systems.  Dealer lists are posted daily.  If you cannot locate an
