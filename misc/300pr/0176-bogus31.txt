Attention Amiga Users.

It seems that after all our hard work, there are already pirate versions
of the 3.1 operating system surfacing.  We have had folks call us for
support that have purchased 3.1 kits from dealers.  As of this date, we
have not shipped to any dealers.  After further investigation, it appears
that the bogus kits include 6 disks with plain white labels with black
text, and the necessary Eprom(s).  No manuals, no printed box, etc.

The OFFICIAL, LICENSED version includes the following;

Box with printed sleeve detailing 3.1 enhancements, photos, etc..

6 disks with professional labels (colored, commodore logos, etc)

1 or 2 Eproms with official labels

3 Printed manuals, bound, glossy covers -
    a) AREXX manual
    b) Workbench 3.1 manual
    c) DOS 3.1 manual


If your upgrade kit does not look like this or contain the above
mentioned items, you do not have a legitimate version, and we WILL NOT
offer any support.

If you have received a version that does not seem "official", please call
Expert Services at (606) 371-9690.

Thanks for your support...
