                 ********************************

Professional Frame-Based, Distributive Render Farm Software
for ENLAN-DFS and LightWave 3D.


FEATURES
--------

T-Net  is  the  first  professional  distributive render farm software
available  for  LightWave  3D.   T-Net allows easy loading of multiple
scenes,  modifications  of settings such as frames, resolution, saves,
etc., and rendering across an ENLAN-DFS network on every Amiga running
LightWave  3D.   By  queueing  up  multiple scenes, you can be free to
perform other tasks, instead of having to constantly come back to your
systems  and  load  new  scenes.   T-Net also has alpha-numeric paging
support  so  it  can  keep  you posted on what is goin on `back at the
farm.'

7  Add multiple scenes to T-Net's Scene Queue, allowing longer term,
   unattended rendering

7  Modify scene settings, such as resolution, antialiasing, image save
   paths, etc.

7  Select ANY specific frame, group, or range of frames for rendering
   Perfect for professional story-boarding

7  Efficiently delegate and manage frame-based distributive rendering
   to any or all systems on the network

7  Graphically monitor the status of every system in your render farm
   (percent complete, scene name, frame number, etc.)

7  Intelligently locate opjects, images, motions etc., from any system
   on the network, saving valuable hard disk space

7  Save information to any system on the network

   farms' status directly to you, no matter where you are!

I-Net 225 is a professional, SANA-II compliant, TCP/IP networking
software package for the Amiga.  TCP/IP is an internationally accepted
network protocol which exists on virtually all computer platforms.  This
gives different systems a common means by which to exchange data.
Finally the Amiga can communicate with everyone else!  (i.e.  Mac, PC,
SGI, WindowsNT etc.)

Utilities which were written for AS225R2, should be fully compatible
with I-Net 225.  There are quite a number of these utilities available
on BBS's and FTP sites around the world.


FEATURES

I-Net 225 comes with a full host of clients and servers allowing the
Amiga to not only connect with remote hosts, but also be a host to other
systems on the network.

any other SANA-II compliant networking package, like ENLAN-DFS.
