MAIDENHEAD, BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND, 1991 JUL 3 (NB) -- In what 
many view as an attempt to breath fresh life into the Amiga CDTV project,
Commodore has announced several new features for its new multimedia
computer. All of the new features enhance the unit's video capabilities.

One new feature, CDXL, lets developers display video images from a 
CD-ROM disk on screen. CDXL can display about 12 frames per second, 
or half the number of frames normally used for full-motion video films.
The effect is reported by observers to be satisfactory until objects
move at high speed across the screen.

According to Commodore, no additional hardware or software is needed
to use the CDXL features - software developers simply need the
specifications from Commodore to know how it all works. According
sources close to Commodore, very early users of older models of the
CDTV will be able to upgrade their operating system software by
slotting in new chips.
