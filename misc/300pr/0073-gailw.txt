OptImage Interactive Services Co. L.P. Wednesday announced that Gail
Wellington has joined the company as vice president of marketing and sales.

Wellington will be responsible for expanding the successful sales and
marketing programs for OptImage's line of Compact Disc Interactive (CD-I)

"We are extremely pleased to have someone of Gail Wellington's caliber join
us at OptImage," said Tim Wahlers, president of OptImage. "Gail's experience
with multimedia product introductions and developer programs will compliment
OptImage's commitment to the CD-I developer community."

Wellington comes to OptImage from Commodore International Services Company

managing the team which brought CDTV to market.

During Wellington's twelve years at Commodore she was responsible for the
development of the AmigaVision authoring system, the Commodore Applications

"I'm looking forward to bringing OptImage's powerful and creative
multi-platform CD-I development tools to market," said Wellington. "The
advent of full screen/full motion video makes this an especially exciting
opportunity that will ensure OptImage's position as the world leader in CD-I
development solutions."

OptImage Interactive Services Co. L.P. was formed by N.V. Philips, of the
Netherlands, and Microware Systems Corp., of Des Moines, to provide leading
edge authoring solutions for developers of CD-I software titles for the
consumer and professional markets.
