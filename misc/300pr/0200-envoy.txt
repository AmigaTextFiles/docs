Drexel Hill, PA (December 29, 1994) The least expensive and most tightly
integrated commercial peer-to-peer networking software for the Amiga just got
better.  IAM software engineers Heinz Wrobel and Dale L. Larson spent months
adding features and perfecting the release.

New features include support of AmigaOS 2.04 DOS packet types (including
notification and record locking), support for removable media, enhanced
reliability and robust recovery, localization, AmigaGuide documentation, and
more.

Amiga Envoy 2.0 is available as an upgrade to any Amiga Envoy user, regardless
of where they purchased their original Envoy.  The upgrade price is US$25,
which includes shipping.  To upgrade in the US, send proof of purchase (or
developer number, for those who obtained Envoy as a beta from Commodore) with
check, money order, or Visa/MC number to IAM. Elsewhere, contact your local
distributor.  The list price of Amiga Envoy remains US$59.95.

Requires Workbench 2.04, Kickstart 2.04, 512k RAM, SANA-II compatible
