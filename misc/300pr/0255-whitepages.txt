Have you ever wondered how to get in touch with an Amiga user, but did
not have a phone number, address, or any way to reach them.  Or, have
you ever obtained or changed your email address, and you wished there
was a way you could let others know about it?  To address these
situations, further communication between Amiga users world-wide, and
contribute to the Amiga presence on the Internet SoftWood has created
a new web site named Amiga Net.  

The Amiga Net site is intended as a white pages for Amiga users.  It
consists of an alphabetical list of names, email addresses, and
possibly links of Amiga users. This site differs from normal links
type pages in that email addresses are included.  Therefore, it is not
necessary to have a web site to be a part of this list.  Anyone can
have a free entry in the site.  An entry will contain live links to
email addresses as well as a personal or business page where
applicable.

The URL for this site is: http://www.amiganet.com.  Send your entry in
the form of your name, email address, and a URL (if you have one) to:
hello@amiganet.com.

Any comments?
