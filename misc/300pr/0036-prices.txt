Commodore Enhanced Product Line and Significantly Reduces List Prices

June 1, 1992 -- Commodore Business Machines, Inc. today announced it has
significantly reduced the U.S. Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price on 
selected models of its Amiga (tm) series multimedia computers by up to 25%.
In addition, the company introduced several new system configurations and the
new A2386SX Bridgeboard (tm), which enables the Amiga 2000 and 3000 series
computers to run MS-DOS (tm) compatible software.

Commodore announced special promotional pricing to its dealers in March. The
success of this promotional effort resulted in the company's decision to
permanently adopt the lower prices, establishing new dealer and Manufacturers
Suggested Retail Pricing (MSRP). One example of the substantial price
reductions is the Amiga 2000 with 1084S color monitor, previously available
at an MSRP of $1986. Its new MSRP is $1539, representing a 23% reduction.

The pricing moves are also part of Commodore's aggressive multimedia marketing
campaign. This campaign is focused on the professional multimedia user 
involved in videographics, dynamic presentations, interactive training or 
point-of-information kiosks. According to Commodore Vice President of 
Professional Sales Geoffrey Stilley, "We have long been recognized as a price
performance leader in the multimedia marketplace and these new systems
configurations and prices will keep us at the forefront. We believe the Amiga
offers the most comprehensive and affordable solutions addressing the 
demanding needs of the multimedia professional.

One new system configuration specifically aimed at the video professional is
an Amiga 2000-based system with at 100MB hard drive, Motorola (tm) 68030
processor, 5MB of RAM and a 1084S monitor with an MSRP of $2699. In addition,
the user can purchase the same system with an A3070 tape drive allowing for
magnetic tape storage of 150MB of information at an MSRP of $3159.

Two additional configurations available through September 30, 1992 are an
Amiga 3000-25/50 with a 50MB hard drive, 2MB of RAM and the new 20mHz
A2386 Bridgeboard for an MSRP of $3399, and an Amiga 3000T-25/200 multimedia
workstation with a 200MB hard drive, 5MB of RAM and a 1950 or 1960 VGA
color monitor for an MSRP of $4499. Commodore Director of Business Marketing
David Archambault stated, "The A3000-25/50 with the new Bridgeboard is 
targeted at the multimedia professional who requires the video, audio and
animation capabilities of the Amiga, as well as the ability to run and 
communicate with an MS-DOS environment. Also, the A3000T-25/200 is ideal for
the multimedia applications developer who requires lots of expandability and
processing power at an affordable price."

Commodore's 386SX bridgeboard gives an Amiga system MS-DOS compatibility by
allowing PC application software to run within a window under AmigaDOS(tm).
MS-DOS files can be transferred back and forth between Amiga disks and MS-DOS
disks, giving users the capabilities of an Amiga and MS-DOS compatibility in
one computer for one low price. The new 386SX bridgeboard is accompanied by
MS-DOS 5.0 software and can be used with all Amiga 2000 and 3000 series 
computers. It has a processor clock speed of 20 MHz and will support a
maximum of two floppy drives while sharing a hard drive with the Amiga side.
