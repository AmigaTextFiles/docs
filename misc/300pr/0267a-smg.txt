Okay.. most of you by now have probably seen SMG's rambling,
nonsensical posting about leaving the Amiga market. Here is some
more info for you to chew on, presented as two text files..
the first is from Kevin Hisel, Webmaster of the Amiga Web
Directory at http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html (THE single best
Amiga resource on the Web). He called SMG and attempted to find
out the truth.

The second is from Sam Johnson ("unclesam" here) who posted this
to usenet and also emailed it to me. Sam's good friend in Idaho,
Marv Birkenbine, is an Amiga Dealer.

You can judge for yourself without me guiding you. Where the
exact truth is, is hard to say. 

However I still personally think that any 1200s brought into the
USA would sell. After all, practially all the 1200s that Commodore
ever made sold, didn't they?

More About the SMG Story - Did they quit or were they fired?

04-May-96 - The Service Management Group (SMG) did not entirely
voluntarily leave the Amiga market as might be inferred from a recent,
rambling press release distributed widely on the Internet by SMG.
According to brief comments made by Amiga Technologies' Company
Spokesman, Gilles Bourdin to CUCUG, "The contract with SMG was indeed
resigned to the 31st of March 1996." CUCUG has received a copy of the
actual letter to SMG dated May 25, 1996 and signed by AT president
Petro Tyschtschenko terminating the SMG contract. 

However, SMG's president, Paul Bielski said in an interview with CUCUG
today that the decision was not entirely one-sided on AT's part,
either. Bielski told us, "During many phone calls in the final weeks,
Gilles, Petro Tyschtschenko, and others asked us to stay. There were
'many ways' acceptable to AT Germany, we could continue to participate
in the Amiga marketplace. We chose not to continue." 

"The termination of the SMG contract was simply not a factor in our
decision. The role the SMG would play in the North American market was
agreed to by the SMG, Amiga Technologies and QuikPak more than a month
earlier. The SMG continued to purchase systems from QuikPak and
directly from Amiga Technologies, Germany, well into mid-April,"
Bielski noted. 

In the meantime, AT has named QuikPak of Norristown, Pennsylvania as
the exclusive sales source of Amiga product in North America. QuikPak
is also the manufacturer/assembler of the Amiga A4000T line of
computers. Another company, Zober Industries, a contract manufacturer
in Croydon, Pennsylvania, makes many of the PC boards and other
components of the A4000T. 

CUCUG has also received a copy of a FAX dated April 3, 1996 addressed
to SMG from Quikpak declining SMG's request to purchase Amiga product
at distributor pricing. This would severely hinder SMG's ability to
continue to distribute Amiga products to dealers since they would be
forced to buy merchandise at the same prices their customers already
pay. Bielski said, "The QuikPak letter...was authored AFTER the SMG
notified the 400+ NA dealers that we would sell single units for
dealers for $2400. Our dealer letter was release at the close of
business on April 2, 1996. This was a unilateral action on our part to
reduce the price dealers pay for the Amiga 4000T. It was our sincere
hope this action would result in more Amiga sales as well as reduced
dealer and consumer prices." 

A few Amiga pundits have questioned the authenticity of the
now-infamous SMG press release, however after much hoopla surrounding
its publication on the Internet, SMG did not deny its authorship. 

Another charge against SMG making the rounds on the Internet, was that
SMG refused to import the popular, low-priced Amiga A1200 computer
into North America. Bielski's response to that was, "This is simply
not true. We polled every dealer asking if they wanted them. Amiga
Tech told us their minimum order quantity was 5,000 units. Despite
repeated dealer queries, we never could amass a a six month forecast
larger that 500-700 units. Despite all of this, the SMG formally
presented Amiga Technologies with a purchase order for 5,000 A1200
units in January '96 and again in March'96. For reasons Petro
Tyschtschenko may want to provide, Amiga Technologies could not
deliver the systems. When those efforts failed, we asked AT to sell us
the pieces of the A1200. The SMG would do the PAL to NTSC conversion
and repackage the systems with more memory, bigger disk and faster
modem, all at our own expense. Again, AT would not sell us the units.
Finally, we asked AT to simply license the technology to us. The SMG
would build the units itself, paying AT a license fee, and assuming
all of the risk on our own. Still, no sale." 

"The SMG made every effort, and fully accepted the financial risk, of
bring the A1200 to North America. The reason the A1200 is not in North
America does not rest with the SMG," Bielski said.

Dear Paul,
                I have just received notification from Amiga Technologies that
SMG's contract with Amiga Technologies has been terminated as of March 31, 1996
.
Specifically, I have received copies of both Amiga's U.S. legal counsel's
termination to you of March 22 and Amiga's confirmatory termination notice to
you of March 25.  Therefore I must tell you that I am puzzled by SMG's
communications to me this week seeking additional product.  As you know, QuikPa
k
is not only the exclusive North American manufacturer of the Amiga products but
now, with your termination, the only authorized North American sales source for
Amiga products.  To provide a level playing field and to assure that all of the
distributors in the Amiga market demonstrate a significant commitment to that
market, QuikPak has established specific volume levels for distributors to
purchase product from us.

                Unfortunately, SMG does not qualify as a distributor based on
both current and historic shipments to date.  For your convenience I have liste
d
the current authorized distributors in North America.  I recommend that you
contact and establish SMG as a dealer with one of these distributors, and place
your 7 piece order with one of these 3, all of whom inform us that they maintai
n
a constant inventory of Amiga Products for immediate shipment.

                Thank you for your interest in Amiga products.  There are many
new products and programs in the works and over the next few weeks we are
planning several major announcements.  We hope to see you continue to
participate in this market.  If I can be of any further assistance, please feel
free to contact me.


                                                Best regards,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Usually Reliable Source informed me some months ago that the true reason SMG
claimed there was insufficient demand for the A1200 in North America was that
they did not have sufficient funds to pay for an NTSC production run.  Also,
that they used funds sent with dealer orders for A4000T's for each order they
sent QuikPak, rather than having them built in reasonable quantity in
advance.

Seen against this background, SMG's recent open letter seems even more
bizarrely mendacious.  Those who read it and wept, weep no more!.
