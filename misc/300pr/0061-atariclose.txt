SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1992 SEP 30 (NB) -- On the
heels of the company's announcement of its newest multimedia
home computer, the Falcon030, Atari says it is closing
research and development facilities in Dallas and Chicago.

While the company, which has about 500 employees worldwide,
says no employees will be laid off, but they will all have
to move to the company headquarters in Sunnyvale to keep
their jobs, according reports from the Associated Press. The
total number of employees in both facilities is about 60,
the company said.

Reports are a Taiwan office for Atari that serves as a
liaison with subcontractors is also being shut down and ten
to 12 people will be laid off. Operations performed there
will be absorbed by the Sunnyvale and Hong Kong offices.

Atari said it would be restructuring and revaluing its
inventory to the tune $34.1 million. The company reported
losses of $39.8 million for its second quarter ending June
30, 1992 that included the restructuring and inventory
charge. The company reported sales for the quarter totaled
less than half of sales for the similar quarter last year,
or $23.3 million compared to sales of $49.2 million in 1991.

Atari is pinning hopes on the Falcon030, the new multimedia home
computer that it plans to introduce in November. Atari says
the Falcon will offer "print to video" capability to home
users. Atari said with software such as Chronos, Prism
Paint, or a shareware program called Ray Shade, home users
who have a video camera, a $120 adapter, and a video
cassette recorder (VCR) can record from the Falcon on to
video tape titles and computer generated animation on top of
pre-recorded video.

Two models of the Falcon will be offered in November A $799
model will offer 1 MB of memory and a single 3.5-inch disk
drive. A $1,399 model will include 4 MB of memory and a 65
MB 2.5-inch IDE hard disk drive.
