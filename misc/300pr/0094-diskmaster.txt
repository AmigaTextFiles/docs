Below is an edited "Programme_Changes" file enclosed on the DiskMaster II
V2.1a release disk I received in the mail.  The only part edited is the
listing of the new commands and how to use them.  Since I don't represent
Progressive outside of being a happy DiskMaster II owner, I figured they'd
prefer not handing out the command syntax.  The upgrade cost from V2.0 cost
$17.00 total and I had to send them my original.  If you haven't received
an update notice, give PPI a call.

  Thank you for upgrading to DiskMaster II.  We're now at version 2.1, and
  have fixed a few small things since the manual was written.  Please
  choose "PrintFiles.." under the TOOLS menu in DiskMaster to print a
  permanant copy of this file.

DISKMASTER 2.00 -> 2.03 CHANGES:

· Title bar clock update under 2.0

· Archive files with spaces (uses quotes)

· Multiple sources with 'unmark off' commands (i.e. SizeCheck)

· 'Read %s SEARCH' automatically starts, and skips to next file when it
    reaches the end.

· Default Arc extract menu item was missing a space. "Arc <*x %s"

· Doesn't assume device names are null terminated.

· In batch files, ";" as the first character can be used to comment out a
  line.

· Fixed startup lock stuff:
    OpenWindow
    Lock S
    OpenWindow
    Lock D
  This was not locking the source window.

· Single and double quotes can be intermixed in batch like ARexx.

· Additions/changes:

  About and other requesters will show the version/revision number in the
    title.
  Added "Copy %s %d RENAME" (asks for new filename while copying)
  Added %P (source path without filename)
        %R (requester string)

· Reader now accepts 'M' key (mode change) switches between hex/ascii, menu
    button exits the reader, added line/lines page/pages.


DISKMASTER 2.03 -> 2.04 CHANGES:

· Added %V (version) to Barformat so title will show current version.

· Superbitmap scrolling in ShowPic is faster.

· Fixed Size Check for correct calculations between FFS and non-FFS.

· Now syncronous rexx.  "REXX command %s" will now be given each filename
    as before, but DM now waits for the command to return before continuing
    on to the next.


DISKMASTER 2.04 -> 2.1 CHANGES:

· Added FFS to format.

· Added HD formatting, but not tested.

· Added Backdrop pattern/picture for custom screens.

· Diskchange and directory modification detect enhanced.

· 2.0 pens are saved in the config.

· Fixed crash when deleting files when sorting by date.

· Project icon DefaultTool path is expanded so it will always find DM.

· Fixed font selection problem in printer setup.


DISKMASTER 2.1 -> 2.1a CHANGES:

· Fixed S<->D swap bug; now no longer crashes machine.

· Fixed the addition of Hex information when saving a STARTUP.DM file;
  this bug especially noticable on floppy-based systems.

· Fixed Progressive logo.

· Fixed CHKsize bug; When a SOURCE device was checked, if there wasn't a
  DESTINATION chosen, the programme would bomb.
