  EXECUTIVES TO DISCUSS PENDING ACQUISITION OF AMIGA, ITV OPPORTUNITIES
  
   
   
   Chicago IL, May 9, 1996 - Visual Information Service Corp. (Nasdaq
   VICP, Bulletin Board), a developer of Interactive TV (ITV) set-top
   boxes to enhance television use and viewing by providing Internet
   access and electronic communications functions, will host a meeting
   for Amiga computer users, vendors, retailers, software and hardware
   developers. The meeting will be held in Toulouse, France on Sunday,
   May 19, 1996 and is intended to encourage dialogue between the Amiga
   community and VIScorp, which announced on April 11, 1996, a letter of
   understanding with Escom AG to acquire the assets and intellectual
   property of Amiga Technologies and the former Commodore Business
   Machines.
   
   "The Amiga community is a large, established and dedicated one, and I
   believe this is the first time that an owner or prospective owner has
   gone to this vast community to ask for its opinions," said Raquel
   Velasco, VIScorp's Director of Sales and Marketing - Europe. "We are
   excited about the opportunity to tell people about VIScorp and our
   vision for the future of Amiga Technologies.
   
   "We have asked for proposals and suggestions from the Amiga community.
   With the `anticipated acquisition of Amiga, we see limitless
   opportunities. We welcome ideas and are coming to France to listen, as
   much as to share our own vision."
   
   The meeting will feature VIScorp Chief Executive Officer William Buck,
   Chief Technical Officer Don Gilbreath, Vice President - Business
   Development David Rosen, Ms. Velasco, and Chief Software Engineer Carl
   Sassenrath.
   
   The company asks that all proposals be sent by May 12, 1996 via email
   to VIScorp Manager of Technical Development for Amiga, Eric Laffont,
   at: elaffont@vistv.com or via facsimile at: 33-61-538-656.
   
   VIScorp has announced that it intends to begin marketing its first
   set-top box with full Internet and Web capabilities, called the
   Universal Internet Television Interface(r), (UITI(r)) in the fourth
   quarter of 1996. The company says an enhanced set-top device, the
   Electronic Device(r) (ED(r)) is scheduled for roll out in 1997, and
   will feature capabilities such as telephone reception and dial-up,
   facsimile, pay-per-view options, electronic mail, access to on-line
   services, including the Internet, and more. Both devices utilize the
   Amiga operating system and chip sets. Information about VIScorp can be
