Dear Commodore Customer and Shareholder,
 
The CSM will be at the Commodore Shareholder Meeting in Nassau,
Bahamas this March 2nd.  
 
Only surprise and delight can describe our reactions as we reviewed
the many proxies and letters.  The premise upon which the shareholder
movement was based is true;  Commodore users can be motivated to act
as a unified force.  We are determined in our cause to save Commodore
from self-destruction, and we are buying stock.  Given enough time,
this alone would achieve our purpose.
 
But time is critical and we are rapidly approaching a crossroads
where the situation will take a turn for the better or a fatal turn
for the worse.  Like in the October 1991 Meeting, the Commodore
Shareholder Movement will play Paul Revere, but we will not make the
mistake we made in 1991 of allowing our dialogue with top Commodore
management to discontinue.  If Commodore does want to survive, they
will listen.  We would not be going if we didn't think there was a
chance.
 
Thank you to the shareholders who entrusted us with their proxy
ballots, and thank you to the thousands of users who have written us
with their opinions and offers of help.  If all goes well, your
chance to help will occur soon.  
 
Listen for our March 2nd announcement.
 
Sincerely,
Michael Levin
