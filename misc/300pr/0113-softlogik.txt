Soft-Logik Translates Professional Page Document Format!

St. Louis, Missouri (August 10, 1993)  Soft-Logik Publishing Corporation
today announced a change to the feature set of the upcoming PageStream
3.0, a completely new version of the #1 Amiga desktop publishing
program. PageStream 3.0 will have the ability to load Professional Page
documents directly. It will also be able to load PageStream2 documents
and the new IFF DOC format documents.

"Document formats have been dark and secret for too long," said Deron
Kazmaier, the president of Soft-Logik Publishing. "Customers want the
freedom to move their documents between programs, and we are going to
give them that freedom."

For the first time, users of Gold Disk's Professional Page desktop
publishing program will be able to make the transition to PageStream
painlessly. They have been able to use their fonts with PageStream since
version 2.0, and Soft-Logik added the ability to load and edit
Professional Draw illustrations in 1992. Adding support for another
program's documents is an industry first and simplifies switching from
Professional Page to PageStream.

Converting a Professional Page document for use in PageStream is a
simple task. Just choose the Open command from the Project menu and
don't worry if it is a PageStream or Professional Page file. The
Professional Page document conversion module is included free of charge
with PageStream 3.0.

PageStream 3.0 will be available in early fall for $395. Customers who
purchase a full copy of PageStream 2.2 after March 15, 1993 are eligible
for a free upgrade to version 3.0 by mailing their registration card,
proof of purchase and $5 for shipping and handling, to Soft-Logik.
Previous purchasers can upgrade for $125 if they own PageStream 2.0 or
higher, or for only $95 if they own PageStream 2 and HotLinks Editions.

Professional Page users can upgrade to PageStream 2.2 now for only $175
plus shipping and handling, and receive a free upgrade to PageStream 3.0
when it's released.


PageStream 3.0 will change the way you think about publishing.
