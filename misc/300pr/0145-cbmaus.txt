SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, 1994 MAR 11 (NB) -- Commodore Business Machines 
(Australia), the one-time big shot of mass market personal 
computing, has gone into liquidation following a creditor's meeting 
last week. Accountant firm Ferrier-Hodgson confirmed the company 
was put into liquidation last Friday.

Hodgson's Max Donnely was called in last month to act as 
administrator when it became insolvent after Westpac Bank 
indicated it would not roll over CBM's bills. The total debt 
is believed to be around AUS$3M (US$2M) with a similar amount 
owed to Commodore International.

In mid-February Commodore Australia was put up for sale although 
the Australian distribution rights for Commodore computers were 
not included in the offer. Ferrier-Hodgson said there were 
potential takers but the decision was made to liquidate the 
company. Most of the warehouse stock has been sold off.

From now on distribution of Commodore Amiga computers will be 
handled by Commodore Asia Pacific, headed by Pat Byrne who was 
MD of the failed Commodore Australia. He said he has no financial 
interest in Commodore Asia Pacific, Commodore Australia, or the 
company which will service Commodore machines from now on,
Compu-Aid.

Industry observers say the new company appears to have obtained 
the stock of the failed company, so supply should not be a 
problem. They also noted that during the past few weeks there 
have been stories of dealers receiving Commodore computers 
without insides, or even boxes without computers.
