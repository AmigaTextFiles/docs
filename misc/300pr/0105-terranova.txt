FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Terra Nova Development Releases "Diner" Object Set for Imagine

July 2, 1993

Terra Nova Development of Ventura, California has released Volume One of
its Designer Objects series of 3D models.  This first volume, "DINER", is
a three disk set of objects for Impulse, Inc.'s Imagine software for
Amiga computers.

The Diner set includes a variety of objects that together build a
complete diner of the early 1950's, including a jukebox, counter, booths,
a pay telephone, dishes, cups, silverware, and other items for place
settings.  In many cases there are both `hi-res' and `lo-res' versions
versions of objects so that artists can optimize their scenes for either
image quality or speedy rendering.

In addition to the objects and image maps there are two Imagine projects
on the disks.  One, with scenes that can be rendered on five megabyte
systems, offers fairly simple scenes; the other features more complex
scenes that require up to fourteen megabytes to render.  A manual is
included.

The Designer Objects series is intended to showcase the talents of gifted
3D artists by making available affordable collections of their 3D
objects.  The Diner objects were created by award-winning computer artist
Bradley W. Schenck, whose work should be familiar to the Amiga community
through articles and artworks including wins in the BADGE Killer Demo
Contests of 1988 and 1989.

Terra Nova Development, based on the California coast, is a
ground-breaking multimedia development company hard at work on
entertainment and application titles for several computer platforms.
