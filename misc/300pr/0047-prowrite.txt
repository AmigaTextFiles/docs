New Horizons is pleased to announce a new upgrade to ProWrite, the
best selling Amiga word processor. ProWrite version 3.3 adds a number
of enhancements over version 3.2; these enhancements include:

*  HotLinks
ProWrite 3.3 supports the HotLinks dynamic data exchange system
developed by Soft-Logik Publishing.  This gives you a very close
integration between ProWrite and other HotLinks-capable programs; you
can edit text in ProWrite and have it automatically incorporated into
your desktop publishing system, or change graphics in a drawing or
painting program and have the changes automatically brought into
ProWrite!

*  Automatic Text Wrap Around Pictures
You can now have text automatically wrap around pictures, either
block-style or following the picture's curves, and with an adjustable
offset.

*  Picture Enhancements
There are a great many enhancements to picture handling in ProWrite
3.3, including the ability to name pictures and search for them in
your documents, and precise control over a picture's location and
size.

*  Print Preview
Now you can get a reduced view of the each page of your document, to
see on the screen how your final layout looks.

*  Improved Font Handling
You can specify any font size for your text, not just those that are
installed on your system.  This gives you complete creative control
over your text's appearance, and is especially useful if you are using
outline fonts or printing on PostScript printers.

*  System Clipboard Support
ProWrite 3.3 can exchange text and pictures with other Amiga programs
through the Amiga's system clipboard.

*  Macro and AREXX Enhancements
ProWrite 3.3 adds a very large number of new macro commands, giving
you virtually complete control over ProWriteUs operation through
AREXX.

*  Kickstart 3.0 and New Amiga Graphics Chips Support
ProWrite 3.3 includes support for new features in Kickstart 3.0, as
well as allowing you to open up to 256 color screens on machines with
the new Amiga graphics chips.

*  And Much More!
There are many more improvements throughout the program; things like
document password protection, an optional vertical ruler, and much
faster PostScript picture printing.

ProWrite 3.3 will be shipping in September 1992, with a new suggested
retail price of $99.95 US.
