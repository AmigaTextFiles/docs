PRESS INFORMATION FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

"VISCORP agreement complete"

Bensheim 23/01/96

Chicago - January 12, 1996 - Visual Information Service Corp. (VISCORP), an
INTERACTIVE TV  developer headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and AMIGA
Technologies GmbH, headquartered in  Bensheim, Germany, have finalized an
international license agreement to adapt, utilize, license  and distribute
the AMIGA technology within VISCORP's interactive intelligent set-top TV
appliance - Electronic Device (ED). The license authorizes VISCORP the right
to use, re-license and  distribute the AMIGA operating system and compatible
parts of current versions of the  technologies where the AMIGA products are 
used as, or as part of, interactive television devices.

In 1995, ESCOM AG acquired all Commodore and AMIGA licenses, patents and
trademarks.  Amiga is an acknowledged leader in the computer industry in the
area of providing high-quality  graphics for monitors and television
broadcasts through their sophisticated chip sets. The  combination of the
AMIGA hardware/software technologies and intuitive operating system makes 
them a viable contender in the development of high-speed delivery for
complex graphic  programming. The AMIGA technology can import and adapt
software to the set-top box  with  minimal changes. 

By employing the sophisticated AMIGA chip set, VISCORP will have the ability
to provide a  complex set-top appliance with multitasking functions to
integrate affordably the TV set, phone line,  and network service providers.
This ability has not yet been offered or available through existing 
systems" said Jerome Greenberg, VISCORP's chairman of the board. "By
utilizing our unique set  top appliance and incorporating the AMIGA
technology, VISCORP is able to provide a complete  practical solution for
interactive TV-services, and now the ability to access the Internet through
a standard TV set with pricing that makes sense for the average TV viewer".


The integration of the AMIGA system with the VISCORP set-top appliance will
allow access to the  Internet, on-line services and voice "chat" programs
through the TV set. As planned, ED will  access any on-line services and any
address on the Internet's superhighway. Access can be  though a TV remote, a
computer keyboard, a touch-sensitive pen or the microphone in the ED. 
Additional plans will enable consumers to play games (e.g., individually,
against a networked  opponent), or enable home shopping, electronic banking,
and enable a subscriber to gain access  to information services through a TV
set.

About VISCORP

VISCORP develops and markets a brand of cost effective set-top appliances
for the home,  business, government and educational users of interactive TV
devices. VISCORP's set-top device  integrates the television and telephone
line to access on-line services, interactive applications and  direct
Internet service through the TV set. Through blending of the existing
VISCORP set-top TV  appliance and the AMIGA technology, VISCORP will be able
to provide a gateway for every  household to enter into the age of
interactive services at a cost-effective price and user friendly 
environment.
