			RAMBRANDT PRODUCT PREVIEW

		Video and Graphics System For Amiga 2000
                      and 3000 series computers


  Rambrandt Amiga offers workstation power for desktop video, multimedia,
Industrial and scientific applications.  For video and graphic profess-
ionals, and industries demanding high-performance graphics and video
workstations, the Rambrandt Amiga system offers features and performance
at a revolutionary price.

  Rambrandt has two framebuffers with adjustable resolutions of up to
1024 x 1024 pixels per buffer in 32-bit color.  The Rambrandt twin-board
graphics system is based on the Texas Instruments TMS34020 40 MHz 32-bit
graphics processor, with 34082 graphics/math coprocessor.

  For video and graphics applications, Rambrandt has composite and RGB
video input, and composite and genlockable RGB video output.  Through
Rambrandt's RGB and composite video output, displays of 16.7 million
colors are possible in resolutions up to 1024 x 1024. Rambrandt can
digitize video from a variety of sources in 16.7 million colors in
real time - 1/30th of a second.  The dual buffers can be linked for a
contiguous, scrollable work area of up to 1024 x 2048 pixels.

  Rambrandt's standard configuration is two four-megabyte banks of fast
video RAM (VRAM)and eight megabytes of RAM (DRAM) for resident application
software.  NTSC and PAL versions are available to support video and
graphics applications world wide.

  Rambrandt is an ideal system for video and graphics work, multimedia,
computer aided design, medical industry, industrial and scientific
simulations, and entertainment industry applications.

  For film and video production work, Rambrandt is capable of an unlmited
variety of digital video effects such as flipping, page turns, coloriz-
ation, solarization, polarization, up to 8:1 zoom, rotations, picture-in-
picture (PIP), live resizing, digital graphic overlay, and many real-time
24-bit animation and digital video effects. 

  For graphic work, Rambrandt is a star performer.  Its high-resolution,
double-buffer architecture with true 24-bit color and 16-color overlay
makes interactive 24-bit painting easy.  Pixel level control and 8:1
real-time hardware zoom give graphic artists capabilities to create
stunning images in 2-D and 3-D.  Rambrandt's coprocessor with built-in
3D functions will render three-dimensional scenes and animations with
incredible speed and clarity.  Rambrandt's abilities to compress and 
display images make it the ideal host for a graphics database. Rambrandt
can provide 3-D Modeling and graphics software power found previously on
workstations costing tens of thousands of dollars more.

  Desktop publishing in high resolution, black and white or 24-bit color,
is fast and efficient with Rambrandt.  With scrollable work areas of up to
1024 x 2048, Rambrandt offers desktop publishing capabilities going far
beyond those currently available in the personal computer market. 
Computer-aided design software can take advantage of Rambrandt's high
speed, built-in drawing and calculation abilities.  For architectural
and engineering design, Rambrandt offers CAD muscle to finish projects
faster.  Screen redraws and object calculations are virtually instant-
aneous, translating ideas in to visual images in fractions of a second.

  Rambrandt's blinding graphic processing speed offers tremendous
potential to the industrial and medical market.  For graphic and 
scientific simulations, Rambrandt has the power to process hundreds of
thousands of variables and calculate complex simulation systems, producing
high-quality visual results.  Simulations can be displayed in real-time
on monitors and recorded to tape for presentations.  Medical applications
such as magnetic resonant imaging (MRI), chemical and molecular modeling,
biological simulations, and many more are possible with Rambrandt.

  Hundreds of image processing functions are built-in to Rambrandt's 
Hardware.  Image enhancement, image recognition, histography, and many
other functions can be processed with blinding speed.  Application
software for scientific work, such as geology, seismology, astronomy and
other branches of science can take advantage of Rambrandt's image
processing engine.

  Rambrandt is a landmark for the entertainment industry.  Interactive
simulations can be run in 24-bit color and high resolution, creating
realism and excitement, taking entertainment software to the limits of
game designer's creativity.  Real-time flight simulators, fast paced three
dimensional action/adventure games, and other spectacular software can
tap into Rambrandt's resources to create stunning new video games.
Multiple Rambrandt boards can be linked to create exceptional virtual
reality systems.  Rambrandt opens doors for new concepts in entertainment,
at a relvolutionary performance vs cost factor.

  Simply stated, Rambrandt represents the state of the art in Multimedia
and graphic workstation power.  The multifaceted Rambrandt intergrates
professional desktop video, graphics production, desktop publishing, CAD
and many other functions.  No other single product offers such a elegant
and powerful solution to such diverse applicatications.  Rambrandt's
visionary design will satisfy the increasing demands of many industries.
Several man-years of professional hardware software engineering have gone
into Rambrandt, to assure that Rambrandt will meet the demands of not only
users, but also application developers.  Rambrandt's not only to use, its
easy to develop for.

  Rambrandt offers unique software compatibility to the development
community through its Standard Amiga Graphics Extension (SAGE).  PP&S and
Digital Micronics Inc. (DMI), with Commodore's cooperation, established
this standard at the Amiga Developer's Conference in Denver. SAGE provides
a simple and efficient way for developing applications which are
compatible with Rambrandt, DMI's Resolver, and other 340x0 hardware
products.  SAGE libraries are available to other manufacturers who wish
to enter the market.  SAGE has been enthusiastically received by the
Amiga Developer's Association, and a number of major Amiga software
development companies have expressed commitment to SAGE.  Developers
interested in SAGE can obtain the professional developer's kit, which
includes manual, SAGE libraries, and source code examples.  This complete
kit is available for the nominal fee of $300.

Rambrandt will be available in December 1991.  The standard configuration
board with a 40MHz 34020 processor, 34082 coprocessor, 8MB of VRAM, and
8MB code RAM, is expected to be released at a manufacturer's suggested
list price of $3995.  Rambrandt is compatible with Amiga 2000 and 
Amiga 3000 series computers, AmigaDos 1.3 and 2.0, in NTSC and PAL
versions.
