      PORTAL COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY ANNOUNCES
         LOW COST INTERNET ACCESS

CUPERTINO, CA (June 29, 1992) --Portal Communications Company announced today
the addition of a family of new services to its popular Online System. These
new services allow Portal customers to interact directly with the Internet in
a number of ways.

Portal customers have access to FTP, a protocol for transferring files
at high speeds over the Internet; Telnet, a program that allows users
to "log in" to a machine connected to the Internet, and Internet Relay
Chat, a real-time conferencing system with as many as 700 people
logged in at once, world-wide.

Portal is the only world-wide information system to offer flat-rate
access to the Internet.  For the low monthly price of $13.95, anyone with
a computer and a modem can become a Portal subscriber.  Internet access
is an additional $5 monthly.  Portal can be reached around the
world via Sprintnet and Tymnet, direct dial, and the Internet with the
Telnet protocol.

Portal is waiving the $5 Internet Services fee during the month of July.

In the communications business since 1986, Portal is well-established
on the networks providing commercial UUCP connections and newsfeeds.
Portal recently acquired a 5-gigabyte archive, the world's largest.  In
addition, Portal is home to the AmigaZone, over 700 megs of Amiga files and
the entire Fred Fish disk collection.
