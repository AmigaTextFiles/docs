 

The following is information is about the vortex worldwide 80386SX 
PC/AT Emulator  specifications for the Amiga 2000/3000/3000T and 
4000 computers.





386SX Emulation with mighty power.

Convert your Amiga into a 386SX PC/AT compatible computer with 
multi processor and multi  operating system capabilities.  vortex 
Golden Gate is more than a 25 MHz 80386SX PC/AT  emulator for 
the Amiga 2000, Amiga 3000, Amiga 3000T and Amiga 4000.



vortex worldwide Golden Gate offers versatility and transparency 
within the PC/AT emulation  unknown up to now.  As a bridge-slot, 
vortex Golden Gate closes the gap between the Amiga's  Zorro slots 
and the PC/AT (ISA) slots.  ISA expansion boards like EGA/VGA 
graphics cards,  LAN controllers of SCSI host adapters are all 
accessible under MS-DOS.  vortex Golden Gate  also supports the 
PC/AT IDE hard disk and PC/AT floppy disk drives under 
AmigaDOS.



vortex Golden Gate is the 25 MHz 836SX PC/AT emulator with 
integrated PC/AT RAM  expansion.  The default configuration 
supplied with vortex Golden Gate consists of 512 KB RAM.   In 
addition, 4 SIMM sockets for standard 256 KB, 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs 
can be upgraded up to a  maximum of 16 MB.  A maximum of 4 MB 
of this RAM can be configured as an autoconfiguring  FAST RAM 
expansion for use under AmigaDOS.  In a standard Amiga with a 
total memory of 1  MB vortex Golden Gate makes 640 KB of DOS 
base memory available.  All memory above 1 MB  can be used as 
Extended and/or Expanded Memory.  Individual assignment of MS-
DOS partitions  can be configured either as a file within an 
AmigaDOS partition or as a MS-DOS partition using a  complete 
AmigaDOS partition.     Up to 24 MS-DOS partitions can be installed 
and MS-DOS can  be booted directly from any of these.



vortex Golden Gate is more than an emulator with RAM expansion.  
vortex Golden Gate includes  a PC/AT IDE hard disk controller and 
optionally an onboard PC/AT floppy disk controller for HD  floppy 
disk drives up to 2.88 MB.  vortex Golden Gate can use Amiga RAM 
expansions and  Commodore compatible hard disk subsystems in the 
Zorro slot.  vortex Golden Gate's IDE hard  disk interface supports 
one PC/AT IDE hard disk under MS-DOS which can contain 1  
AmigaDOS partition.  vortex Golden Gate integrates the internal and 
external Amiga floppy disk  drives (DFO: ...DF3:) in the standard 
MS-DOS formats with 360 KB and 720 KB.  With the  optional 
onboard 82077AA floppy disk controller, vortex Golden Gate can use 
up to three (2  internal; 1 external) HD floppy disk drives with 1.2 MB; 
1.44 MB; 2.88 MB under MS-DOS and up  to two of these under 
AmigaDOS.



vortex Golden Gate also contains a free socket for an optional 
80C387SX arithmetic co- processor to increase the numeric 
performance of Golden Gate.  vortex Golden Gate supports  flicker 
fixing cards and 68020/68030/68040 accelerators.



With a standard analog RGB monitor (e.g. 1084S) the following MS-
DOS video emulations are  available:



		

			- CGA with 16 colors

			- EGA/VGA monochrome graphics

			- Hercules

			- Olivetti

			- ToshibaT3100.



You can obtain a full VGA video output under MS-DOS if you install 
a VGA graphics card into  one of the Amiga PC/AT slots and connect 
a suitable monitor.



vortex Golden Gates integrates a standard 386SX chip set and AT 
compatible BIOS with  enhanced 386 functions.  Windows 3.0/3.1 runs 
unrestrictedly in the enhanced 386 mode and the  protected mode.  
vortex Golden Gate runs as a process within the multitasking 
environment of the  Amiga.  You can work simultaneously with 
AmigaDOS and MS-DOS switching between the two  operating 
systems.  vortex Golden Gate is compatible with Kickstart 1.3 and 2.0.  
The Amiga  mouse is emulated as a serial Microsoft mouse and the 
Amiga keyboard works as a PC keyboard.   The serial interface can be 
used as COM1/COM2 and the parallel interface as LPT1 under MS- 
DOS.  vortex Golden Gate contains its own speaker, real time clock 
(RTC) and CMOS RAM.







An external option connector for future expansions has been 
integrated onboard.  All MS-DOS  versions from 3.2 up to 5.0 as well 
as DR-DOS 5.0 and 6.0 have been tested successfully.  MS- DOS is 
not included.  The two 3.5" system disks contain emulation and 
installation software and  other useful tools.  The menu driven setup 
program allows a simple system configuration.   Installation and 
operation of vortex Golden Gate are described in detail in the user's 
manual.
