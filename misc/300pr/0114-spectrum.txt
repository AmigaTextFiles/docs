I went to my local amiga dealer last week and he had just received info
on a new graphics board from GVP.  He gave me a photocopy of the release
information which I have transcribed below.  The dealer said the board
would be available in the fall and would be priced at around $600. For
those interested in the EGS libraries, I found a demo of them on
aminet in the dev/misc area: egs.lha and egslibs.lha.

EGS-28/24 SPECTRUM PRODUCT INFO  --Preliminary Specs subject to change

DESCRIPTION

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum -- the second member of GVP's EGS family of graphics
boards -- is a high-performance, high-resolution, 24-bit graphics board that
will take any Amiga 2000, 3000, or 4000 beyond AGA!  Following the same
philosophy as the first member of the EGS family, the powerhouse EGS-110/24,
this entry level graphics board provides power and performance at an affordable
 
price.

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum is capable of displaying video resolutions (NTSC, PAL,
and SECAM) as well as workstation-like high resolutions like Next (1120x832).
It also adapts automatically to either a Zorro-II (15-bit A2000) or Zorro-III
(32-bit A3000/A4000) bus and supports Workbench 2.04, 2.1, and 3.0 to take
maximum advantage of its environment. ( Capable of supporting Commodore's RTG
graphics standard when it becomes available.)

For the ultimate in convenience and functionality, the EGS-28/24 Spectrum has
a built-in pass through for the native Amiga RGB display.  When working with a
native Amiga screen, the EGS-28/24 Spectrum simply passes the Amiga display out
to the monitor!  While others may claim to be a one-monitor solution, there
will always be incompatible software that requires the use of a second monitor-
__the_EGS-28/24_Spectrum_is_truly_a_one_monitor_solution__!

As if that weren't enough, our unique MultiGFX(tm) technology allows multiple
EGS-28/24 Spectrum boards to be installed in the same machine, and the device
libraries handle all of the necessary details. Multiple applications can be
running on multiple EGS-28/24 Spectrum boards, each visible on a separate
monitor simultaneously in stunning full 24-bit color at any resolution.  This i
s
a blessing for those who need to see a lot of different things all at the same
time.  For example, consider the 3D animator who needs to see a high-resolution
wireframe display of the scene being edited, an NTSC (or PAL) color preview
of the animation in progress, and a control panel screen with all of the needed
commands available at the click of a mouse!

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum system uses the new Enhanced Graphics System (EGS) devic
e
libraries.  These device independent libraries allow high-resolution, 24-bit
software to be written for ANY graphics board that supports these libraries.
To date, a number of graphics boards on the market already support the EGS
libraries, and all software written for those boards will run on the EGS-28/24
Spectrum.  Likewise, any software written to support the EGS-28/24 Spectrum wil
l
run on any of the other display boards that support the EGS libraries.  Program
mers
are no longer committed to a single graphics board; by programming for the EGS
system, programs can run _unmodified_ on any display board that supports the
libraries!

The EGS libraries were painstakingly checked and rechecked by programmers aroun
d
the world to make them as close as possible to existing Amiga graphics calls,
differing only when necessary to support new features.  This effort was taken t
o
make porting applications as easy as possible for programmers.  (Some function
calls were make so identical that the only difference is the addition of an E_
in front of the function name, with all parameters and return values the same!)

The EGS libraries also provide some new and very useful additions to the basic
array of graphics programming features that native Amiga programmers are used
to, for example: Tear-Off menus, Menu gadgets, and more.

However, realizing that good software takes time, GVP has provided a Workbench
driver for the EGS-28/24 Spectrum.  This driver allows Workbench to run on the
EGS-28/24 Spectrum board in any supported resolution, with up to 256 colors --
Workbench limits the color depth to 256 colors for itself and Workbench-complia
nt
software.  Any software that opens its display on Workbench will automatically
run on any EGS-28/24 Spectrum Workbench.  The only restriction is that no direc
t
Amiga Blitter operations be performed by programs running on the EGS-28/24
Spectrum display, since the Amiga Blitter operates on Chip RAM and the EGS-28/2
4
Spectrum has its own blitter that operates on the display maintained entirely
in its own DRAM. (By the way, this means that ALL Chip RAM normally used by
Workbench is free for other use.)

It is also important to realize that the EGS display subsystem is entirely
separate from the normal Amiga display.  A two-monitor configuration allows
the EGS-28/24 Spectrum monitor to display a high-resolution display (from a
CAD system for example) on the EGS monitor and the native Amiga output system
to display something completely different, and even from a completely different
program!  An interesting and extremely useful example would be running a high-
resolution paint program in the EGS display while a video application (like the
IV24(tm), the Video Toaster(tm), or OpalVision(tm)) runs on the native Amiga
display.  As pictures are framegrabbed and saved, an EGS Paint system can load
them in for touchup, while the video framegrabbing continues--maximum 
productivity and efficiency!

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum hardware and the EGS system software take the Amiga
platform beyond AGA and into the true-color world of high-end graphics
workstations.  The already installed base of A2000 and A3000 owners, and the
fresh new base of A4000 owners can leap past the limitations of AGA and enter
a new world of high-resolution, true-color, hardware-independent graphics.
Keep in mind that when writing applications for the EGS system, they are not
just for a single graphics board, they will run on any current and future
graphics boards that support the EGS system libraries!

             Developers interested in porting applications
             to the EGS system should contact GVP for

FEATURES AND BENEFITS

The EGS-28/24 Spectrum Hardware

FEATURE		BENEFITS

Zorro II /      The EGS-28/Spectrum takes full advantage of whatever Amiga it i

Blitter	        move chunks of data from one area of memory to another.  This 
                makes the EGS-28/24 Spectrum the perfect tool for real-time
                animations and 24-bit paint applications.  Fills, brush pastes,
                region operations, image manipulation can all be performed by t
he
                blitter leaving the processor free to perform other work.

Amiga RGB       Other graphics boards often require two monitors (one for the 
Pass-Through    Amiga display and one for the custom graphics display), and som
e
Single	        others like the Video Toaster(tm) require three monitors.  The
monitor         EGS-28/24 Spectrum has special circuitry that takes the Amiga

                Amiga or the EGS screen is displayed.  It is truly a one-monito
r
                solution.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
MultiGFX(tm)    Other graphics boards often expect to be the only graphics
device sharing  board in the system, and if more than one is installed, the
technology      controlling software may become confused.  EGS' device sharing
                allows multiple EGS-28/24 Spectrum boards to function independ-
                ently while the libraries handle all of the work to keep things
                running smoothly.

2MB of onboard  This allows for high-resolution 24-bit displays that are rock-

                ing 4MB or more of 24-bit display memory often flicker because
                the graphics chip is not capable of displaying 4MB of data fast
                enough to be flicker-free. Other graphics boards may claim that
                the extra memory is used to keep multiple screens open at the 
                same time. The EGS-28/24 Spectrum uses a smarter technique that
                swaps out non-visible display data to standard system RAM to
                conserve display memory for crisp, stunning displays. Adding
                memory beyond 2MB is inefficient and needlessly expensive.

Complete        All graphics applications in the EGS libraries are treated as
true-color,     24-bit, true-color applications, even if the display device can
't
24 bit          support 24-bit. Editing and painting in 8-bit, 16-bit, or any
environment     other mode will still maintain the quality and clarity of a 24-

ng
current         to open. The EGS libraries automatically dither the 24-bit
color depth     display using extremely fast and accurate dithering algorithms 
to
                provide a crisp display and allow the 24-bit application to
                continue working in 24-bit (ie. all actions occur in 24-bit and
                are only displayed in 8bit).  If a 24-bit screen is used later,
                all of the quality and clarity of the 24-bit application is
                preserved.

                controllable.
