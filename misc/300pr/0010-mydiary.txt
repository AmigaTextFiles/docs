M.V.Micro releases MyDiary v1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wheat Ridge, Colorado - M.V.Micro has announced the release of their
latest product, MyDiary.


MyDiary -- An Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MyDiary is the first Personal Information Manager (PIM) available for
the Amiga line of computers.  Designed to be the most versatile and
easy to use PIM available for any computer platform, MyDiary can
easily handle all of your personal information needs.

The basis of the MyDiary system, is the concept of a pop-up note pad.
You simply press ALT-F1, type your note, then press CTRL-q.  MyDiary
automatically files your note for later retrieval.  This alone is an
extremely useful feature, however, MyDiary has much more to offer.

MyDiary allows you to organize your notes into four groups.  The four
primary groups are, Note, Book, Appointment, and Name.  Each group
offers its own special features.

The Note group features an 'Auto-Delete' function allowing notes in
this group to be temporary.  With this feature enabled, your notes
will be automatically deleted when they reach your specified age.  You
may also have MyDiary notify you when it is about to delete a note.
You may then choose to keep specific notes.

The Book group is intended for storage of permanent notes.  This is
the only group which accepts past dated notes.  Both the Note and Book
groups may be divided into sub-groups by using the first line of the
note as a 'Key'.

The Appointment group is automatically divided into three sub-groups
based on the amount of information you supply.  The three appointment
sub-groups are, To-do, Reminder, and Appointment.  Simply storing a
note in the Appointment group creates a 'To-do' note.  To-do notes
have a special report and are excluded from your normal schedule.  By
specifying a particular date or 'Repeat' value for the note, you
create a 'Reminder'.  Reminders are included in your schedule but do
not have individual alarms.  When a specific time is set, the note
becomes an appointment and has a separate alarm.  Appointment alarms
may be offset.  For example, the alarm can sound ten minutes before
the appointment.

The final primary group, Names, keeps notes on people you commonly
associate with.  The Name group has several special features including
a 'Find Name' search and the ability to dial the phone.

MyDiary provides three avenues for accessing this vast array of
information, Calendar mode, Search mode, and Report mode.

Calendar mode offers a perpetual calendar.  The calendar displays note
indicators and schedule summaries.  You may also name specific dates.
Calendar mode is also the primary 'Date Selector'.  When changing to a
different mode, from Calendar mode, the currently selected date is
used.

Search mode is used for direct access to your notes.  'Search Filters'
are used throughout MyDiary to limit access.  When a 'Search Filter'
is active, only notes meeting the set criteria will be available.
Notes may be modified, duplicated, and deleted.  To-do notes may be
flagged as complete, without deletion, preserving history.
Information can be marked and copied to the Clipboard for use in other
programs.

Report mode provides formatted output of your notes.  Special reports
include; Pocket schedule, To-do list, Phone book, and Label.  A
general report allows extraction of selected information in several
formats.

MyDiary alarms include, eight programmable 'System Alarms', a 'Daily
Reminder', and individual appointment alarms.  Two sampled sounds
provide instant recognition of the alarm's source and are user
selected.  Appointment and 'Daily Reminder' alarms include visual
notification.

Description and limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Crippleware version of the soon to be released, personal information
manager, MyDiary.  This demo includes many sample notes describing the
operation of MyDiary, and can be effectively used as a pop-up note
pad.

Intended as a demonstration, all advanced features have been disabled
and the Report mode removed.  Basic note pad features remain intact
and Calendar mode is nearly fully operational.  The available working
features enable the demo to be a very useful pop-up note pad,
therefore, the number of notes is limited to a reasonable amount.
