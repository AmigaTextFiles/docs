ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1993 AUG 6 (NB) -- Actor and
comedian Sinbad picked up the tab to bring a group of inner-
city kids in Washington, DC, who had created an award-winning
computer animation project, but couldn't afford to get to the
SIGGRAPH conference in Anaheim, California, to show off their
work. A special portion of the show floor was dedicated to the
computer work of elementary through high-school age kids and
dubbed SIGKids.

The Washington group is composed of four eleventh graders who
created a computer animation that visually depicts violence in
their neighborhood. The kids made accurate replicas of city
storefronts and rendered scenes with animations added that
included gun chases and other real life threats.

Coco Conn, head of the SIGKids project, said traditionally the
nitty-gritty has been hidden from kids so all that's seen is
nice neat computers and software programs already set up. She's
attempted to change that so that kids have to work together and
actually get involved in plugging in the components and
handling the hardware just as you would in any real project. In
fact, one computer had a sign posted on the back on top of the
cabling protruding out that said, "You touch these cables, you
die."

Forty students from across the United States demonstrated their
computer skills and got to see the latest in computer graphics
technology at the SIGGRAPH show.
