{{{Note!... I apologize for the lateness with which this is posted.
Previously, Sue West at Commodore, West Chester, sent me paper copies
of CBM press releases AND she posted them to comp.sys.amiga.announce
on Usenet AND she emailed them to me. Well, Sue is no longer with 
CBM (a victim of the recent layoffs) and I only learned this fact
a couple days ago. I had had the paper copies of this and the previous
press release sitting on my desk for the last week or so waiting to
see if she was going to post/email them before I bothered to take the
time to type them in.  

Well today I received a new version of MiGraph's OCR software and it
is very fast and quite reliable, and so this and the previous press
release posted here were from the paper copies I received from CBM,
scanned into my 2500 with my Epson ES300C scanner, and then processed
into text with the MiGraph OCR software I just received. Only a little
bit of post-scan-OCR-editing was required.

Offers The Program Savings To Amiga 3000 Owners

today announced it is extending the Amiga 2000 Power Up program, offering
special savings for Amiga 2000 owners on the purchase of an Amiga 4000
series computer, through July 31, 1993. The company is also expanding the
Power Up program to include owners of Amiga 3000 series computers.
Promotional pricing is $2349* for the A4000-040/1 20 and $1 599* for
the A4000-030/1 20, representing substantial savings of $1 350 and $800
respectively, based on Manufacturer.s Suggested Retail Prices.

"The success of the Amiga 2000 Power Up program and feedback from our
established Amiga 3000 customer base encouraged us to expand the program
to include A3000 owners," commented James Dionne, president and general
manager of Commodore Business Machines, Inc. "Extending the promotion
through the end of July will allow A3000 owners to take advantage of the
substantial Power Up savings and enable us to meet the growing demand for
Amiga 4000 products."

The Power Up program is designed to position the Amiga 4000 computer as
the new base platform for development of future Amiga products. The
promotion provides current Amiga 2000 and 3000 computer owners the
opportunity to purchase an Amiga 4000 at a substantial cost savings. By
not requiring current users to trade-in their A2000 and 3000 systems the
program also protects their investment in software and add-on hardware.

cover of their Amiga 2000 or 3000 owners manual and the system serial
number. Power Up program pricing is available at the time of purchase
through participating Commodore Authorized Resellers in the United

takes advantage of AGA features while maintaining backward compatibility
with most software developed for earlier versions of AmigaDOS. Backward
compatibility is also maintained for most peripheral products originally
designed for the Amiga 2000 or 3000 computers.
