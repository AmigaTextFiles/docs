Commodore Announces New Lower Cost Amiga 4000 

(West Chester, PA -- March 19, 1993)  Commodore Business Machines,Inc.
(U.S.) today announced it is expanding its Advanced Graphics Architecture
(AGA) product line with the addition of the new Amiga (R) 4000-030
desktop computer.  The Amiga 4000-030 is a lower cost version of the
company's Amiga 4000-040 that was introduced in September 1992.  The
system is expected to be available at Commodore authorized resellers by
the end of the month at a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of
$2399.00.

Like the A4000-040 and A1200, the A4000-030 contains Commodore's AGA
custom co-processor chip set which enables users to display and animate
graphics in multiple resolutions at up to 256,000 colors from a palette of
16.8 million.  Powered by a 25MHz Motorola (R) EC68030 processor the
new system comes standard with 2MB of chip RAM, 2MB of fast RAM and
a 120MB IDE hard drive. The unit also ships with AmigaDOS TM Release
3, the latest version of Commodore's multitasking operating system. 
AmigaDOS Release 3 takes advantage of the new AGA features while
maintaining backward compatibility with Amiga software not written
specifically for AGA machines. 

"Commodore is committed to expanding its AGA line of computers to meet
the computing requirements and budgets of all multimedia users,"

commented Geoffrey Stilley, vice president of sales for Commodore
Business Machines, Inc. "The Amiga 4000-030 is proof of this commitment. 
It provides users the capabilities and performance enhancements of the
AGA chip set at a considerable cost savings."   

Commodore Business Machines,Inc., based in West Chester, PA, is the U.S.
subsidiary of Commodore International Limited.  The company
manufactures and markets a complete line of Amiga computers and
peripherals for the business, consumer, education and government markets. 
The company's worldwide installed user base of Amiga computers is
presently nearly four million.
