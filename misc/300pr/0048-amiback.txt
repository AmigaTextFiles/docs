ORLANDO, FLORIDA 1992 SEP 9 (NB) -- Moonlighter Software 
Development Inc., is now shipping its new disk utilities 
product for the Commodore Amiga. Ami-Back Tools is designed 
to keep hard disks and diskettes in top condition.

One utility is GP, a disk optimizer that ensures data is efficiently 
stored on the disk. Data Analyst examines disks looking for 
potential problems and repairs them if necessary. 911-Recovery 
allows the user to recover files that have been deleted and may 
also be able to recover files from corrupted disks. Antiseptic is a 
disk-wipe program that wipes the disk clear, rather than just mark 
it as clear. LabTest calculates and compares checksums on disks 
and files, ensuring that they haven't been altered by viruses or 
sabotage. All of these programs run under The Administrator, 
allowing users to set up, schedule, and perform any or all of the 
tests easily, and as required.

Gary Holland, president of Moonlighter said, "Ever since we 
released Ami-Back, Amiga users have been clamoring for a 
professional disk utilities package with the same high quality. 
Ami-Back Tools is our answer to all these users, and we are 
certain they will find this package unmatched by any other 
utilities package available for the Amiga."

He said the product was the result of over a year of development, 
taking into account the wish lists of hundreds of Amiga users. 
"High quality was always a high priority, and we're certain Amiga 
users will find it a professional and elegant package."

Ami-Back Tools will run on any Amiga with at least 512 
kilobytes of memory, and has a suggested retail of $79.95.
