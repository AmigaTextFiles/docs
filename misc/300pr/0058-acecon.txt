  
                    Announcing the first annual ACECON
  
                 (Amiga Computer Enthusiasts Convention)
  
             Saturday November 7th, 1992   9:00 AM to 9:00 PM
  
  The  first annual ACECON will be held in Columbia Missouri at the
Stephens  College  ball room.  ACECON is organized like a super all
day  Amiga  User  Group  meeting,  not  an Amiga Vendor Exposition.
(Although  there will be some participation by Amiga vendors) There
will  be  three  areas  of interest.  A Video Theater showing Amiga
related  videos  all day long, scheduled formal demonstrations, and
dozens  of  Amigas  set  up on the convention floor for users.  The
floor  area  will  be segregated into interest sigs; such as games,
productivity,  music & midi, graphics, and video.  Arrangements are
being  made  to  demonstrate  the new Amiga A600, A600HD, and A4000
computers; as well as the A570 CD-ROM and the CDTV.  Dozens of door
prizes  will  be  given away during the day.  Participating vendors
will  either  be  attending  and/or  providing door prizes for this
event.  Refreshments will be available at the convention, and there
is a cafeteria nearby for meals.  There is a $1.00 registration fee
at  the door to help offset the expense of hosting this event.  The
first 500 people will receive a copy of Amiga News.
