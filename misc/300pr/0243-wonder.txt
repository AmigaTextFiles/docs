POWERMANAGER SCREEN SAVER DESIGN CONTEST

WCi Lazarus Engineering Division is pleased to announce it's first
PowerManager screen saver contest.


WHAT IS POWERMANAGER

During the Calgary AmiJam Amiga show in July 1995, Lazarus Engineering
revealed a special edition of it's PowerManger software complete with a
flaming AmiJam logo screen saver.  The software never went into full
production and is a rare commodity currently owned by only a few select
people.  The PowerManager software contains the following:

* A DPMS monitor controlling module.  DPMS stands for Display Power
Management System and is a standard defined by the EPA (Environmental
Protection Agency) in the U.S.  DPMS allows a computer to control the
amount of power a monitor is using through video signals.  Most monitors
displaying the "Energy Star" logo have DPMS ability (there are over 500
models currently available with this ability)

* A screen saver controlling module.  Included with PowerManger in
Calgary were five screen savers and their source code.  Two of them
displayed a logo and then burst it into flame, one was a multi-coloured
star field (with accurate star colors), something called curvo which
has to be seen, and a simple black-screen module for shutting down
older monitors which looked for this before they would go into power-
saving mode.

* A disk cacheing module.  Lazarus Engineering purchased the cacheing
engine found in Steve Tibbett's CacheX software, enhanced it to work
with all amiga disk devices including removable media like CD-ROM drives,
iomega ZIP drives, floppies, etc., added support for multiple devices,
and a stats window that lets you know how useful it's been.

* A hard drive power management module.  During a period of inactivity
you can let PowerManager spin down your hard drive(s).  The internal
IDE hard drive controllers found in A4000s, A1200s, and A600s are
supported as well as any SCSI HD controller which supports the SCSI
spin-down command (most new controllers do).


CONTEST DETAILS

Lazarus Engineering is looking for interesting, entertaining, and
functional screen saver modules for it's upcoming (Q1 1996) release of
PowerManager 2.0.  A total of 30 entries will be chosen and included
(without source).  Entries will be judged on the following criteria:

- Compatibility (systems and display adapters)
- Originality
- Entertainment value (coolness factor)

The following rules apply to entries received:

- Code must be original and free from any copyrights
- Source code must be provided with entry
- Code must conform to the spec outlined at the bottom of this doc.
- Entry must be received before January 7, 1996 at 11:59pm
- Employees of WCi and it's divisions (Wonder Computers,  WCi Distribution,
Lazarus Engineering, Information Technology) are not eligible


PRIZES

PowerManager Compliant Screen Savers
------------------------------------

        The control system for a screen blanker is fairly simple.  PowerManager
will send one of four signals to the blanker process.  The signals tell the
screen blanker to quit, start blanking, stop blanking, or show it's
interface for preferences.  Since only four operations are needed the DOS
signals CTRL-C, CTRL-D, CTRL-E, and CTRL-F are used.  The means you don't need
to allocate any signals, and the programs can be tested as standalone programs
from a CLI window, pressing CTRL-keys to switch from mode to mode.

        Upon startup, PowerManager will need to know if the blanker module was
able to launch and initialize correctly.  This is done by sending a message
to the public PowerManagerBlank port.  The message should have the node name
field pointing to the task base of your blanker.  If you must quit at some
time, sending a message with a name of null will inform the PowerManager that
this blanker process has exited.  You do not need a reply port.  The mn_length
field should contain the correct size of the message and PowerManager will
free the RAM for the message once it is received.  This of course means you
cannot place the message as a structure inside your code, as freeing that
will cause problems when you try to quit the blanker.


Quick Overview of steps required:
---------------------------------

- Initialize everything you need

- Find Port "PowerManagerBlank"

- Send a message to the port with mn_Length set up, and ln_Name is your
  task base. (FindTask(NULL))

- Wait for four DOS signals plus any internal signals you need
  On CTRL-C, QUIT
  On CTRL-D, Start Blanking
  On CTRL-E, Stop Blanking
  On CTRL-F, Set preferences

- On exit, Send a message to the PowerManagerBlank port with ln_Name as null.
