Bensheim 22.01.96

Amiga Surfer available!

The "AMIGA Surfer" pack will hit the shelves at the end of January 1996.

The "AMIGA Surfer" consists of an Amiga A1200HD multimedia system fitted 
with 260MB hard drive and two megabytes of RAM, together with a complete 
suite of Internet software and a 14,400bps modem.  The package will be 
priced at approximately USD 720 (exclusive of VAT).  This complete 
solution from Amiga Technologies is the cheapest available plug&play 
Internet bundle.

The Amiga A1200 is video-compatible and can be easily connected to a 
Television set, saving the additional cost of a monitor.

Other Internet options soon to be available from Amiga Technologies 
include: the "Surfkit", a package consisting of the Internet software 
suite and modem, at an approximate price of USD 190 (excluding VAT).  A 
package call "Surfware" is also being planned which will provide the 
Internet software alone.

All packs will include an option to connect to the IBM Internet Link and 
get 100 hours free connection.

About the Internet Software:

MUI3.2: Magic User Interface is an Amiga-OS extension that makes 
dedicated applications more ergonomic with a friendlier user interface. 
With MUI, the user can also customise and configure their applications 
individually.

AS 225 R2: A new and completely reworked version of the original AMIGA 
TCP/IP software is provided.  This software handles the connection 
between the Amiga and the network.

Mindwalker: The WWW Browser with MUI-support: A full featured graphical 
World Wide Web Browser that can handle forms, bookmarks, search 
functions, hotlinks and many more.

AMIRC: The IRC Client with elegant MUI interface, gives access to the 
"Internet Relay Chat", where one can participate on-line and in 
real-time to discussion forums.  Several thousands of users meet here 
daily to discuss various topics.  Binary files can also be sent among 
users using AMIRC.

AMFTP: The FTP Client also uses the MUI-extension.  The graphical 
interface of AMFTP makes the handling of files and directories from 
distant servers very effective and comfortable.  The program works as a 
file-manager and gives access to tremendous amounts of Amiga software 
available on the Internet.

Voodoo: The included E-mail manager is a fully new development and 
supports the "Mime-standard" to send, receive and view graphics and 
other binary files easily.  UU-Encoded binary files are also supported. 
The advanced user interface of Voodoo helps to handle electronic mail 
quickly and easily.

The Surfer pack also includes the popular Amiga Magic Bundle's 
productivity software of a wordprocessor, spreadsheet, database, 
organiser and graphic tools.
