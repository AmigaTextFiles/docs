Here's New Horizons press release on Quarterback 5.0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Coast Software is pleased to announce a new version of 
Quarterback, the best selling hard disk backup program for the Amiga.  
Quarterback 5.0 adds several new features and enhancements, including:



~  Integrated streaming tape support.  Quarterback has built-in 
support for streaming tape drives, no additional software or device 
drivers are necessary.



~  Compression.  Quarterback can optionally compress the data being 
backed up, requiring fewer floppies (or smaller tapes) for the backup.



~  Backup and restore to a file.  Rather than doing direct-access to 
floppy or tape drives, Quarterback can optionally backup to an 
AmigaDOS file, so you can use Quarterback as a general-purpose 
archiving tool.



~  Password protection and encryption.  You can optionally protect 
your backups with a password -- the data will be encrypted and 
unusable by anyone but the password owner.



~  New "3-D" user interface.  Quarterback has a completely revamped 3-
D user interface, and now is even easier to use than before.



~  Increased performance.  Unbelievably, Quarterback is now even 
faster!



~  AREXX and Workbench 2.0 support.  Quarterback now has an AREXX port 
and can be fully controlled through the AREXX system.  Additionally, 
Quarterback supports a number of new features in Workbench 2.0.



Several other improvements have been made to Quarterback, such as 
support for up to four floppy drives, increased file selection 
versatility, and more.



Quarterback 5.0 will be available in January 1992, and will have a 
suggested retail price of $75.00.  Upgrades from previous versions 
will be made available at a reasonable cost, details on upgrading will 
be made available at a later date.
