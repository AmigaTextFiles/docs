Commodore Announces the Availability of AmigaVision Professional

(West Chester, PA --- December 21, 1992) --- Commodore Business
Machines, Inc. today announced it is now shipping AmigaVision (TM)
Professional, a new implementation of the Commodore icon-based
authoring tool. 

AmigaVision Professional builds and expands on the visual programming
environment used in earlier versions of AmigaVision. One of the many
new product features is the ability to display Advanced Graphics
Architecture (TM) (AGA) based screens, which is key to users of the new
Amiga (R) 4000 and Amiga 1200 AGA computers. 

Among other new features are full support for the CDTV (R) player,
including playback of CD-ROM based CD-XL motion video files; speed and
memory improvements; and enhancements to the authoring environment. In
addition, a freely redistributable Runtime Module has been included,
enabling flows created in AmigaVision to be played back without loading
AmigaVision.

AmigaVision Professional has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of
$399.00. The product is an attractive option as an authoring and
presentation package for interactive courseware designers and developers;
educators for classroom, administrative and interactive learning
applications; kiosk and point-of-information displays; user friendly
front-end interfaces to complex data processing networks; as well as
business, government and educational presentations.
