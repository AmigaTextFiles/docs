Video Toaster Developers' Conference


	
Las Vegas, March 20, 1994 P NewTek Inc., developers of the Video Toaster and 
the new Video Toaster Flyer, today announced plans for a national Video 
Toaster Developers' Conference. The Conference will be held in Los Angeles 
this fall as part of Avid Publications' Video Toaster Expo. Avid Publications is 
the publisher of Video Toaster User magazine.

RItUs the right time for a developers' conference.S according to NewTek 
President Tim Jenison.  RWith the upcoming release of our D2 quality non-
linear editor, the Video Toaster Flyer, the Toaster really becomes a complete 
video production studio that fits on a desktop.  We see great opportunities for 
third-party development of additional tools for the system.  Professional 
producers can expect to have the FlyerUs lossless D2 quality output working in 
conjunction with the edit controllers, decks, and effects devices they already 
use." 

RThe conference is an important milestone for the Toaster,S said Jim Plant, 
President of Avid Publications. RAn entire industry has exploded around the 
Toaster since its release three years ago, and with new products like the Video 
Toaster Flyer, the growth in this market will accelerate even faster than 
analysts have predicted.S
