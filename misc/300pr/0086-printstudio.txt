This isn't really a press release but it's a reply to a letter I
sent to Wolf Faust in Germany after seeing him post to Usenet about
a new printer product he will be releasing soon. What follows is
his reply.

Well, what is the "Studio Printer Software"?

Studio includes Workbench printer drivers for most of the current
printers.  These printer drivers have many features and offer a
dramatic increase in print quality and speed compared to normal WB
drivers.  Also included is a 24 Bit picture printing program (from
disk).  This program is very similar to TruePrint from ASDG, but
of course offers more features and works with every printer
driver. All programs have a nice KS2/3 user interface. A nice 150
page manual is included.

Two reviews appeared this week in german magazines. Both are
extremly good ("You must add the price of Studio to your printer's
price..."). From the returned registartion cards:

             Good     Ok   Worse

Software      23      1      0    (two people added "very" good)

Manual        18      6      0    (some people noted that the manual
                                   is "techy")


Here are the features of the programs included on one disk. I will
add the new Canon driver disk with Studio for free.

Studio
------
- prints IFF ILBM pictures from disk
- supports most of the known IFF ILBM formats, including HAM8,
  IFF24, HAM, EHB and color palettes up to 256 colors.
- does not require $&%$ MBytes memory!
- Allows you to print poster size images spread over multiple
  pages.
- number of copies can be defined
- Using  Studio you  can  print 24 bit-planes of color accuracy
  on  a  color  printer  (for  instance CanonBJC800).  If you have a
  black and white only printer, then you can print with 8 bit-planes
  of grey scale accuracy.
- multiple jobs can be defined and printed in background
  (estimated print time and more will be displayed)
- ink compensation does correct ink impurities
- color adjustment (gamma, contrast, brightnes, weights,...)
- Free defineable ordered dither routines. Following ordered
  dither matrices are already included:
  Haltone-A, Halftone-B, Ordered-A, Ordered-B, Spiral, Horizontal,
  Vertical, Bck-Brick, Fwd-Brick
- Three error diffusion dither routines:
  Floyd Steinberg, Jarvis, Stucki
- Two serpentine blue noise dither routines are included:
  30% random weight, 50% random weight
- ARexx Interface
- font independent user interface (KS 2.04 style)
- works with most printer drivers
- automatic use of improved code on 68020/30/40 processors
- supports multiinterface cards

Laserjet-Studio
---------------
- supports all PCL 3-5 laser printers (including HP 4 with 600dpi!)
- 16 point greyscale adjustment with 8 bit accuracy.
  Easy control over gamma correction, brightness,
  contrast and more...
- includes PageStream 2.xx PCL 5 (600 dpi) driver
- supports PJL (printer job language)
  for automatic PostScript/PCL switching (IIIsi)
- supports autosensing Language Cartridges (HP/Pacific)
- 256 greyshades (printer drivers are normaly limited to 16!)
- paper input and output tray selectable
- number of copies definable
- compressed graphics (mode 0,2,3,0+2+3 and 5 compression supported!)
  offer a dramatic speed increase (usualy 2-5 times faster!)
- supports Roman 8 and ECMA 94 symbol sets
- landscape mode/mirror modes selectable
- free definable dither routines (many included... for instance:
  Ordered, Halftone, Vertical, Horizontal, Spiral,...)
- Job end signal
- arXon switchbox support
- timeout  can  be defined, avoiding this nasty "printer trouble"
  requester.
- control  over typeface (the "LaserPref" preferences program does
  contains a database of the latest typeface base values, allowing you to
  calculate a typeface family)
- total control over page size and margins
- and many more features...

Deskjet-Studio:
---------------
- drives all Deskjet printers (including 550 with real 4-color
  graphics!)
- 256 greyshades (printer drivers are normaly limited to 16!)
- color adjustment with 24 bit accuracy and 256 shades per color
  component. Easy control over gamma correction, brightness,
  contrast and more...
- ink compensation correcting ink impurities
- control  over  depletion (not really needed because of the better
  color adjustment of the driver)
- control  over typeface (the "DeskPref" preferences program does
  contains a database of the latest typeface base values, allowing you to
  calculate a typeface family)
- total control over page size and margins, line wrap, printer
  direction, quality, landscape....
- includes a nice font independent preferences program
- free definable dither routines. Allready included:
  Ordered-A, Ordered-B (a adopted ordered dither curing dot gain
  problems), Halftone-A, Halftone-B, Line, Spiral and more...
- mirror function for T-Shirt printings...
- timeout  can  be defined, avoiding this nasty "printer trouble"
  requester.
- full control over shingling and depletion
- Job end signal
- arXon switchbox support
- automatic use of improved code on 68020/30/40 processors
- compressed graphic output does improve the speed (2-10times faster)
- and many more features...

PinStudio
---------
- Emulations supported: Oki, Citizen, Seikosha, Epson (24 and 48 pin),
  Fujitsu, Panasonic, Nec and Star (24 and 48 pin)

  component. Easy control over gamma corection, brightness,
  contrast and more...
- ink compensation correcting ink impurities
- total control over page size and margins
- includes a nice font independent preferences program

- full control over typefaces
- supports "quit" mode
- Job end signal
- arXon switchbox support
- timeout  can  be defined, avoiding this nasty "printer trouble"
