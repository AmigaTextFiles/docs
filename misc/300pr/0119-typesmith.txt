Soft-Logik announces TypeSmith version 2.0

TypeSmith is described in the new August 1993 issue of DTP World.

Version 2.0 of the font creator and editor adds these new features:

   1. Create Bitmap fonts for both Adobe Type I fonts, Soft-Logik
      DMF fonts, Amiga Bitmap and Windows PostScript (.FON). You can
      also load in bitmap pictures and save them as bitmap fonts.

   2. Automatic hinting. TypeSmith will load hints created by other
      programs and will save them without changing them.

   3. Auto Tracing. Just select a picture and TypeSmith will autotrace
      it quickly turning in into an outline font.

   4. Screen redraws are up to 100% faster.

   5. Rulers, draggable guides, improved Print Preview, clipboard
      support, version tracking and more ARexx commands.

Upgrade for existing TypeSmith customers is $50. TypeSmith 2.0 Retail
price is $199.95. Available September, 1993.

Requires AmigaDOS 2.0, 2 MB Ram and Hard Drive or 2 floppy drives.

TypeSmith supports Adobe Type I, Soft-Logik, CompuGraphic intellifont
and Amiga Bitmap font formats.
