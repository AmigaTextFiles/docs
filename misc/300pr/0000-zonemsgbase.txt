This is the Amiga Zone's message base dedicated to official press
releases of new products of interest to Amiga Zone users. If you are
a commercial vendor or shareware author or have a product or service
that you think would be of interest to the Zone membership, this
message base is the place to put it. I often receive press releases
from companies in the mail and many of those posted here were
typed up or scanned/OCRd by me and put here for your information.
More recently I get them by email and grab them off the World Wide
Web.

A very good source of press releases is the Amiga Web Directory
at http://www.cucug.org/amiga.html in the "New links" link.

Press releases posted here are NEVER deleted. The messages DON'T
scroll off with time. This helps us maintain a sense of history
as you can go back and read press releases for well-known products
from the time they were first released a couple years ago.

Get as commercial as you want here - leave your company name,
address, phone, fax, email, Web address, shoe size, SAT scores,
and any other relevant information concerning your company and
your product.
