Amiga Technology GmbH and Eagle Computer Products GmbH have arranged a
mutual licensing agreement, allowing Eagle Computer Products to immediately
offer customers the EAGLE 4000 TE computer with the original A4000T

The product will display the quality brand "AMIGA Based", whereby the
customer is insured the quality standard of a genuine Amiga OEM product. 

The product will be marketed by Eagle Computers Products in the very popular
XENON design Tower casing. The interesting part of the agreement is that the
customer can determine the equipment within the Tower itself.

The agreement is solely for the Tower casing (with 230 W power supply),
Mouse, Keyboard, System Disks, Manuals, Motherboard, Floppy Drive, 2MB
ChipRAM and 4 MB FastRAM. The announced price totals 2720 DM.

Graphic cards etc. can be integrated for the customer of Eagle Computers if
desired.

In addition Eagle Computer Products offer customers the possibility, to part
exchange an A1200 against the purchase a new Eagle 4000 TE.
