AmigaWorld Ceases Publication Readers Offered Choice of Options 

Peterborough, NH (March 2, 1995) - TechMedia Publishing announced today that
it will cease publication of AmigaWorld, the leading magazine serving users
of the Commodore Amiga computer, as of its April 1995 issue. 

"TechMedia will offer current readers two positive options to replace
AmigaWorld", commented Dale Strang, TechMedia President. "We feel it is
important to offer our customers the editorial quality they have become
accustomed to from AmigaWorld over the past ten years. The offer will
consist of two other IDG publications, both of which contain editorial in
line with the needs of Amiga users." 

Strang explained that this difficult business decision was a result of the
deteriorating state of the Amiga market. "Becasue of the
Commodore liquidation there has been no new Amiga technology developed
in the last year, which translates into no new vendors or readers entering
the marketplace. The Amiga platform has lost considerable position in the
highly competitivie digital video/multimeida niche in which it was a major
player," commented Strang. 

AmigaWorld was first published in July 1985 to coincide with the launch of
the original Amiga 1000 computer. Universally recognzed as the leading
authority in the Amiga market, AmigaWorld chronicled the phenomenal rise of
the Amiga as the platform of choice for those creating animation,
desktop video and multimedia. With an ABC-audited circulation in excess of
100,000 for many years, AmigaWorld introduced many users to some of the most
innovative developments in the personal computer field over the last decade
- including a fully multitasking operating system, 24-bit graphics
architecture and the Video Toaster. 

Summing up the magazine's ten-year history, AmigaWorld Editor-in-Chief
Daniel Sullivan commented, "We were fortunate to be in on the ground floor
of what proved to be a revolution in desktop computing tehcnology. We are
proud to have served the users of that technology over the past
decade." 

TechMedia Publishing, Inc., an IDG Compnay, also publishes Digital Video,
which covers video and multimedia production, Planet Stidio, a monthly
newsletter for users of Autodesk's multimedia products and DV Finance
Report, a newsletter which provides financial insight for multimedia
developers and financiers. Internatinal Data Group is the leading global
provider of information services on information technology with 233
newspapers and magazines in 65 countries.
