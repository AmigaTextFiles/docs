Commodore's bankruptcy will not have an effect on our Amiga development.
We are concentrating on PageStream 3.0 for the Amiga. We will continue to
develop PageStream, and while we hope in the future that it will be
available for other platforms, we are too busy with our Amiga products to
consider that now. Remember that just because Commodore is out of business
does not mean that your Amiga will stop working. We think that PageStream
3.0 will breathe years of life into your Amiga.

Cheers,

Michael @ Soft-Logik Publishing Corp.
