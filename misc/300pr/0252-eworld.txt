This has absoutely nothing to do with Amigas, but y'see I bought
a Newton message pad last summer, and I enjoy using it, and built
into its ROM is email software called NewtonMail that operates
thru Apple's eWorld online service. So when I got the Mac
emulator "shapeshifter" running onmy 1200, I called eWorld and got
the disks for the full interface version of eWorld which I've
been using in the emulation.

I don't spend much time on eWorld - maybe a couple hours a month
for the last 3 months, mainly downloading Newton software. 

Today I learned that yesterday, eWorld announced they were shutting
down the service at the end of March and moving it to the Web.
I just logged into eWorld and there are already hundreds of
messages posted,as you would expect, by outraged eWorld "citizens"
about Apple's decision.  This reminded me of Plink's closing down
five years ago, except that Plink's owners didn't even have the
guts, nevermind the common courtesy, to announce closure. They just
up and pulled the plug one Friday afternoon at 5pm in May of 1991.
(As the Amiga Zone sysop on Plink, and a contracted, salaried
outside "employee" I had been given a whole two-days of unofficial
notice that they were closing, and then there was the nasty matter
of the thousands of $$ worth of paychecks they screwed me out of,
but that's an entirely different story that's too depressing to
even think about...)

At any rate, here is the official posting on eWorld describing
Apple's plans. 

eWorld is less than two years old. They claimed membership of
around 200,000.  Access was via Mac software (the service software
was, I'm told, written by AOL so in some ways it operated 
similarly to that service), and, as an email-only service for
Newton owners. 

If you follow the news of Apple recently, you know what's been
going on with that company.  You know that they got a new
Chairman of the Board just a couple weeks ago.  My hunch isthat
this is one of his first cost-cutting measures, as scuttlebutt
has it that eWorld has always operated in the red. 

Anyway, so much for a sense of "community" eh?
