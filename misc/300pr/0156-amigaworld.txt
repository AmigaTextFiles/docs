            AmigaWorld--The Leading Amiga Publication--
          Reinforces Position of Strong Support in Market

Peterborough, NH (May 3, 1994)  AmigaWorld, the independent, monthly
consumer publication for users of Amiga personal computers, has announced
today that recent events at Commodore Business Machines in no way affect
AmigaWorld's commitment to the market.

Responding to news on Friday, April 29, that Commodore was going out of
business, AmigaWorld Editor-in-Chief Daniel Sullivan stated, "Regardless of
any change in the status of Commodore's operations, AmigaWorld will
continue to provide coverage of the Amiga market for its readership.  We
believe there are sound reasons to remain in the Amiga market -- namely, an
installed base of five million Amiga computers worldwide; a dedicated
AmigaWorld readership of loyal, enthusiastic users; and an innovative,
proactive group of third-party developers."

Sullivan added, "We also feel certain that the technology will survive the
liquidation of Commodore through licensing agreements with interested third
parties -- of which there appear to be many. This is an excellent
opportunity for the Amiga community to take charge of its own destiny and
set a direction for further development that Commodore has not been able to
provide."

The AmigaWorld staff views this situation as an opportunity to provide an
even greater level of service to its readers and advertisers. With
Commodore's departure from the market, customer service will become an even
greater priority at AmigaWorld.  The staff will continue to support
everyone involved in the market through such means as phone support and
on-line feedback. By providing strong customer service and up-to-date
market coverage for readers, AmigaWorld hopes to be the catalyst for future
growth and development in the Amiga community. 

AmigaWorld Magazine is published by TechMedia Publishing, Inc., an
International Data Group company. IDG is the world's foremost publisher of
computer-related information and the leading global provider of information
services on information technology, with over 194 computer publications in
62 countries.
