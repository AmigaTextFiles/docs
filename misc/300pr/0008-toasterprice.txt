TOPEKA, KANSAS, U.S.A., 1991 OCT 21 (NB) -- NewTek intends 
to raise the price of its Video Toaster more than 50 percent, from 
$1,595 to $2,495, effective with the release of version 2.0 of the 
software on December 15.

The Toaster is a combination genlock, stillstore, character 
generator, and special effects device for the Commodore Amiga 
which has caused great excitement among broadcasters who can 
spend over $100,000 on a simple editing suite. At Comdex, the 
company is expected to release a version of its software for the 
IBM PC under Microsoft Windows, and demonstrate the new 
software.

Buyers can beat most of the price increase by buying their 
Toaster immediately. All cards shipped between now and the 
release of the new software can upgrade for free. Other users of 
version 1.0 can upgrade their software for $395.

NewTek claims that over 11,000 hours of work was devoted to the 
new software, which is over twice the size of the original and 
contains 50 percent more effects, including such things as real-
time warping, soft-edge transitions, and organic effects like 
clouds, pouring liquid, fire, tearing paper, and breaking glass. 

"Many of these effects have never been possible on any 
equipment, no matter what the price," said president Tim 
Jenison in a press statement.

The new Toaster also features a modeling program called Light 
Wave, file compression to conserve hard disk space, faster frame 
loading, and the ability to share files with Apple Macintoshes, 
IBM PCs, and Unix-based workstations. 

DXF files from AutoCAD release 11, 3D Studio, ParaComp's Swivel 
3D, Wavefront OBJ, and even Macintosh PICT files can also be 
handled by the new Toaster, and the new modular file system will 
let other file formats be added at any time.
