Dear Amiga Developers,

Concerning the recent announcements by Commodore, I wanted to let you
know that SAS Institute, Inc. intends to continue selling and providing
technical support for the SAS/C Development System with C++ as long as
there is a viable market.  However, due to the uncertainty of the
market, the Institute's management has decided to suspend new
development on the Amiga-specific parts of the product.  This policy
will remain in effect until changes in the market warrant
reconsideration.

Development will continue on those portions of the product that are used
on other platforms, including the code generator, the global and
peephole optimizers, the C++ translator, and the debugger.  If we see a
viable Amiga market in the future, we will be in a good position to
produce a new release for it with a minimum of lost time.

Also in response to the Commodore announcements and many user
suggestions, SAS Institute Inc. announces the following new prices for
the SAS/C Development System with C++, effective immediately:

                Version 6.50...................$199.00
                Upgrade from Version 6...........59.00
                Upgrade from Version 5...........99.50
                Upgrade from Version 4...........99.50
                Academic discount................99.50
                Manx trade-in offer..............99.50

These prices are in US dollars and do not include shipping charges.
Customers outside the US, please contact your local SAS Institute
office or your nearest Amiga distributor for prices in your area.
We do not plan to send a mailing to registered users, so please
take the initiative to contact SAS Institute if you would like
to take advantage of the new upgrade price.

If you have comments or suggestions about our development policy, please
send email to "ts4sasca@unx.sas.com" or write to

      Amiga C Marketing
      SAS Institute Inc.
      SAS Campus Drive
      Cary, NC 27513

Please do NOT send email to me, Jim Cooper, Steve Krueger, Khristi
Tomlinson, Diane Gomez, or Gerlinde Schuster with suggestions for future
development plans or product offerings.  We will just ask you to go 
through one of the above channels.

On a personal note, I'd like to add that I plan on keeping my Amiga
and supporting the Amiga community in any way possible.  I've been an
Amiga developer since March of 1986, and I'd hate to see it go.  Look
for a new release of parnet soon 8^)
