Amiga Technologies and Giunti Multimedia Welcome back the Amiga in Italy
------------------------------------------------------------------------
	    Press Conference - Milano (SMAU) - 21/9/95

           report from Marco Dufour - Computer Gazette

Today (21/9/95) at 11:30 AM, in the C Conference hall of the SMAU 
computer fair in Milano (Italy), Amiga Technologies and Giunti Multimedia
revealed their strategies for the future of the Amiga in Italy and the rest 
of the world.
	There were more than 30 journalists from various magazines (Amiga 
Magazine, Enigma Amiga Run, Amiga Byte, Computer Gazette, PC Magazine, 
MicroComputer etc.); they all waited for the good news: THE AMIGA IS BACK!

Ok, who is Giunti Multimedia?
Giunti is one of the oldest Editorial group here in Italy. Three years ago 
Giunti and Albino Bertoletti (Ex CEO of Commodore Italiana) founded 
Giunti Multimedia. Since then they published more than 42 CD titles for 
CDTV, CD32, CDI, CD-Rom.

During the first week of September Giunti Multimedia agreed to be the 
exclusive italian distributor for the Amiga range products. They also 
distribute the spectacular I-glasses, the new Virtual Reality 
experience by Escom.
 The meeting was a success and everybody seemed satisfied (... the 
prices... a bit too high ...)

Amiga in Italy:

 Obviously this was the most important subject of the meeting.
 The production is on the way and we should see the "new" Amiga 1200 and 
A4000 Tower very soon. Petro Tyschtschenko confirmed that on the 11th of 
september the first NEW Amiga was born in Bordeaux. That's a good news 
because it means they found all the pieces to make it, and be sure it 
hasn't been a simple task! By the way this means that the product will 
be on the shelves in the very near future (firt week of october, they 
say).
 The "new" Amiga 1200 has the same specs of the old one produced by 
Commodore. They had to do that because they wanted to get the Christmas 
sales. The good news is that it will have a serious Bundle wiht 
Wordworth 4, Personal Paint, Scala MM 300 and other good stuff. The bad 
news is that it will have a mere two MB of memory. Well, you can buy the 
new Blizzard 1260 (Phase 5) and have a truly workstation for less than 
3000 Dmarks!
 The A1200 + kit costs 1.150.000 Lires VAT incl.
 The A1200 + kit + 170 HD costs 1.450.000 Lires VAT incl.
 The new A4000 Tower costs 5.890.000 Lires VAT incl. (68040/25MHz, 6 MB 
of ram and 1 giga HD - SCSI II)

Amiga Technologies also showed the new Multisynch monitor. It's the 
Microvitec, a good monitor compatible with 15 KHz and 31 KHz frequences. 
This means it's compatible with A500 and A1200 too. The price of the 
monitor is set to 750.000 Lires VAT incl.

I-glasses!

During the meeting were introduced in Italy the fantastic I-glasses! The 
speaker, Denis Premiski, told that there are planned 25.000 units for 
Europe. He claimed it's the Virtual Reality tool for the masses. There 
will be a special Amiga bundle with specific Amiga drivers.

NEWS:

 NewTek is back on the Amiga! They were undecided where to produce only 
the PC version of the Video Toaster and LightWave but then Amiga 
Technologies convinced them to continue supporting the Amiga. That's 
good, expecially for american users
 The new monitor from Amiga Tech. is the old but good MicroVitec.
On october the 10th, Amiga Technology will have a party to welcome the 
new Amigas on the market. It will take place in Bordeaux, France.
There will be an Internet Package, with Modem and programs. More news 
about that in the near future.
The next generation Amigas (faster processor and better graphics) will be 
introduced at CeBit (Hannover fair, March 1996).

Comment:

Like in Frankfurt, last May, I felt Escom and Amiga Technologies are 
doing the best they can to bring back the Amiga. We, as users and fan of 
the Amiga, should let them know our support and our thinking of what 
future Amigas and current should be.

Why not, for example, put an High Density drive inside the A1200?
It's not a technical problem and the advantages are great!

In my humble opinion I can't tell what's right and what's wrong, 
expecially before I see the final product (weren't we expecting a greeny 
Tower?).
Let's hope all the promises will be mantained and the prices lowered.
