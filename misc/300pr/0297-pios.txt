-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PIOS Computer AG, Hildesheim, Germany, 24th August 1996.

New Product announcements from PIOS Computer AG has been eagerly awaited by
both the visitors to our Web-Page (over 46000 since May '96) and the
marketplace throughout Europe and the USA.

Unfortunately this delay has been caused by the inability to secure a working
agreement with Viscorp over the rights to the AMIGA patents and licenses.

Despite repeated efforts by PIOS managent Viscorp have discontinued
discussion, without giving any reasons or otherwise. This is despite initial
talks and drawing up an agreements early June of this year.

In order for PIOS to meets its business goals of providing RISC products for
both the AMIGA community and other computer users, we feel that the time has
now come to provide an new impetus into the marketplace. We can no longer
accept the Viscorp vision for AMIGA as being based on reality and will
immediately announce a range of products designed to give the AMIGA and other
computer user the power and performance they need for the next decade. (

PIOS is committed to providing high performance, affordable products through
the year 2000 and beyond.
