FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Directory Opus 5.5 is now available! 

GPSoftware demonstrates  its continuing  support for the Amiga with the
release of the new version the Amiga world's most popular directory and
file  management   utility.  After   more  than   12  months  of  extra
development, Directory Opus 5.5 is more  of a  new version  than just a
simple  update  and  contains  many  changes  and enhancements over the
original product.

After receiving many comments and useful  suggestions from  Opus users,
almost every  facet of  the new program has been examined and subjected
to user scrutiny,  backed  up  by  extensive  field  testing  from very
persistent  Beta  testers.  This  release  extends  the original Opus 5
concepts and provides many significant improvements in both operational
power and  usability.  From the feedback we have received so far we are
confident that you will enjoy this new product more than ever! 

Take a look at the following enhancements to  see why  an upgrade  is a
must!

     . A  new Icon Action Mode gives all the power of name mode Listers
     but with icons. 

     . Button banks and Listers need  no longer  be activated  first in
     order to see right and middle mouse button clicks.  

     . WorkBench  Replacement Mode has been enhanced. Use Opus 5.5 with
     complete confidence to replace the standard Workbench.

     . An integrated OpusFTP capability lets you access remote Internet
     sites directly from standard Opus Listers.

     . Button  banks can now be borderless with a sleek minimal dragbar
     instead of a full window border.

     . New Filetype-specific pop-up menus allow special menus for icons
     and files.   Use Filetypes to add custom menus for different types
     of files and icons. 

     . Custom buttons have a pop-up menu giving  access to  an extended
     selection of commands.

     . New independent HotKeys are now supported.

     . New  Scripts system  allows functions  to be  executed upon most
     system events. 

     . Custom menus have  been improved  with multiple  user menus with
     sub items.  

     . New  Automatic Filetype  Creator allows  you to  create and test
     Filetypes with ease.

     . A font viewer is now included.  Just double-click  on a  font to
     view it.

     .  Listers  now  have  field  titles,  single-click  re-sorting by
     fields, plus a new version field which reads  the internal version
     information from each file.

     . New  colour remapping of button and icon images with support for
     'Magic Workbench' and similar systems.

     . Cybergraphics RTG now supported.

     . You can now selectively hide unwanted drive icons from  the Opus
     main window.

     . Enhanced  clipboard support provides full cut, copy and paste in
     gadgets and file Listers. 

     . Listers are no longer blocked while busy  - you  can now resize,
     iconify, and scroll busy Listers.

     .  Icon  and  Lister  snapshots  are  now  stored  separately from
     Workbench.

     . Listers can now display a background picture or pattern.

     . A new internal  Opus CLI  allows you  quickly test  commands and
     ARexx scripts.

     . Several  new internal  commands and many new ARexx commands have
     been added or extended with new features. You can now even add you
     own internal commands with ARexx.
