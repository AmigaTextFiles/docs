TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA, 1993 DEC 10 (NB) -- Commodore Business
Machines Ltd., is turning over all manufacturing and sales of its
DOS personal computers in Canada to 3D Microcomputers Wholesale
and Distribution (Canada) Inc., of Markham, Ontario.
 
Doug MacGregor, president of Commodore in Canada, said his
company took the decision so it could focus on its proprietary
hardware: the Amiga personal computer and the newly introduced
CD32 game machine.
 
"We're finding it very difficult to compete in the MS-DOS
marketplace right now and make money," he said. "We have to put
our emphasis and focus on the Amiga, and that's the way that
Commodore can be successful."
 
MacGregor said Commodore's Canadian subsidiary is not the only
unit of the company turning over the PC clone business to outside
manufacturers. "That's happening in a number of countries around
the world. It's not a decision that Canada's made alone."
 
In fact, 3D and other third parties in Canada have built some of
Commodore's DOS machines here in the past. Others were supplied
to the Canadian unit by its parent company in the United States,
and MacGregor said these were largely made for the company by
others as well.
 
The real change is not the manufacturing but the distribution of
the machines. Essentially, MacGregor said, Commodore's only
involvement with most sales of the DOS line now will be its name
on the boxes.
 
The company will keep only the role of marketing to government,
education, and institutions.
 
While Commodore's DOS PCs have never gained much attention in the
United States, the company has done better in this segment of the
market in Canada and parts of Europe.
