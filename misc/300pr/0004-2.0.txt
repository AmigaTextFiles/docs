The following is a statement from Bill Sydnes, Commodore's VP of engineering,
regarding the status of the 2.0 operating system:


	As part of Commodore's ongoing commitment to our customers, I am pleased
	to announce completion of Release 2 of the Amiga Operating System.

	Today's Amiga Release 2 is very different from the Release 2 first
	shipped with the Amiga 3000.  Many additional man-years of effort have
	been invested to create a polished, stable, compatible, tested
	release that Commodore will build on for the future.  Several hundred
	official beta testers provided feedback, resulting in the best tested,
	most trouble-free and reliable operating system for the Amiga ever.

	For existing Amiga 3000 owners, Commodore plans to release a five disk
	update set.  For A500/A2000 owners, Commodore will make available a Release 2
	Enhancer Kit, with new ROM, diskettes and full documentation.  Installation
	will be through an Authorized Commodore Service Center.  Release 2 Enhancer
	Kits will be available beginning in October.  Pricing will be announced
	shortly.

	Following shipment of Release 2 Enhancer Kits, Commodore will gradually
	phase Release 2 into new unit production.

	Release 2 is a major step forward in software technology, and is part
	of Commodore's commitment to keeping the Amiga competitive, and looking
	to the future.

	William Sydnes
	Vice President - Engineering, Commodore International Limited
