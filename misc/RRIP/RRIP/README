The anxiously awaited new, 1.12 versions of the System Use Sharing 
Protocol and the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol are now available
for review and comment.

The documents are available through anonymous ftp at:

        ftp.ossi.com in /pub

The documents are available in both MS Word 6 format (*.doc) and
Postscript format (*.ps).  Otherwise, the file names should be
self-explanatory.  The files are called:

        rrip112.doc, rrip112.ps, susp112.doc, susp112.ps        

If you have comments or constructive criticism of these new 
versions of the specifications, please feel free to respond to:

        cdfdf@ymi.com

We are trying to get these documents to ballot as an IEEE standard
soon, so we would appreciate prompt response.  We hope to review
all the responses at the next working group meeting on August 26,
1994, so any responses we gather by end of business of August 24
will be considered at that meeting.

Thank you for your interest and consideration.

Sincerely,

Andrew Young
CDFSF WG Chair
President, Young Minds, Inc.

P.S.  Please feel free to post this notice to any appropriate
newgroups, or to forward it to other interested parties.
