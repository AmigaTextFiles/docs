                BertLand - the sequel to ÅkeBertLand
                ====================================
         Original Idea © by Sören Olsson & Anders Jacobsson


It had now been three months since ÅkeBertLand had last been in action. The
project had not hit off correctly, since the boys were not interested in it,
and no girls would join the club.
  So Åke, Bert, Lill-Erik and all the other boys that had sometime been there
had left it and nobody cared for it any more.

Until one day Bert had an idea. He would restore ÅkeBertLand to its former
glory - just for himself! He decided not to tell Åke and Lill-Erik anything
about it.
  He refurnished ÅkeBertLand and redubbed it BertLand, since Åke would not be
there any more. He even changed one rule, the most important rule of all - the
girl rule. The old rule of ÅkeBertLand had said that all girls who will enter
the club must only have panties on.
  Bert's new rule said that all girls who will enter the club mustn't even have
panties on.

Bert lived in BertLand for a few days, alone, until someone knocked on his
door. He opened it.
  It was Louise, one of his former girlfriends. She had something to say to
him. "Hello, Bert", said Louise. "Umm, hello, Louise", said Bert. "I'm sorry
for what I thought about you", said Louise, "and want to join your club."
  "Remember the rules", said Bert. "Sure", said Louise, and took off her coat,
dress, undershirt and bra. She stood in front of bert clad only in her panties
and high-heeled shoes.
  "According to the new rules, that is not enough", said Bert. He showed her
the rules. Louise obeyed and took off her panties. She entered the club and
closed the door behind her.

Once Louise was inside, Bert began to think of new rules. He invented three
rules in addition to the first rule about girls entering the club.
  The first rule was that no boys (apart from Bert of course) would be allowed
to join the club - it was for Bert and girls only.
  The second rule stated that no girl who had entered the club would be allowed
to leave it.
  The third rule was quite fun for Bert. It said that all girls would have to
be tied all the time - that was their hands must be tied behind their backs and
their legs must be tied together. Bert had already acquired several pieces of
strong rope to aid him in this.

Bert explained the rules to Louise, and she agreed with him. She sat on his bed
and he fetched two pieces of rope, with one of which he tied her hands, and
with another he tied her legs.
  Louise lay on the bed, and Bert lay on top of her, kissing her and licking
her bare breasts. Louise lay completely defenceless under Bert, and was
actually enjoying her current situation.
  Bert had put all her clothes in a box and locked it, so she could not get at
them. He had the key in his pocket - she could not put her hands there without
his knowing.

After a few days Bert had grown tired of living in his club with just Louise
there to keep him company. He decided to go to the town's new swimming hall,
and leave Louise to lie on his bed, naked and tied.
  So Bert left and entered the swimming hall. After he had changed into his
swimming trunks in the cloakroom, he went to the pools.
  He had a favourite pool in the hall - it was the little heart-shaped one
which was only allowed for girls. A notice stood next to it, saying "Girls
only - no boys allowed!".
  Bert looked around until he saw the hall's guard looking in the opposite
direction from him and the swimming pool. Then he swiftly dived into the warm,
clear water. He was secure swimming, as long as he held his entire body from
the neck down under water - the guard could not spot his gender from just his
head.

Bert swam a little in the girls' pool, among the girls. They, contrary to the
guard, knew his true gender, but were not alarmed of it, and did not tell the
hall crew about it - the simple reason was that they were normal, boy-loving
girls who had gone to the pool either unwillingly or because they had nothing
better to do. So they liked to have a boy amongst them.
  Bert noticed a cave in the pool's side. He swam there, because he thought he
would be safer from the guard's eye there. Beautiful girls swam past him as he
moved in the water.
  In the cave he remained stationary until he heard two girl voices from the
other side of the cave. They were strangely familiar to him. He turned to face
the other side and saw two of his former girlfriends - Nadja and Rebecka.
  Both girls were clad in tight-fitting rubber swimsuits and were embracing
each other. At times they kissed each other or rubbed their breasts. They were
obviously in love with each other.

"I love you so much", said Nadja. "So do I", said Rebecka, and added, "You,
that is."
  "But there is one person whom I still long after", said Nadja. "Do you mean
Bert?" asked Rebecka. "Yes", said Nadja and Rebecka also admitted her love for
him.
  Bert swam in front of the girls and showed himself to them. "Bert", they
whispered. "Yes, it is truly me", said Bert. The girls quickly swam to him and
embraced him.
  "We have missed you so long", said Nadja, "where do you think we could go?"
"We could go to my club, BertLand", said Bert. "But how do I get out of this
pool unnoticed?" "Leave that to us", said Rebecka.

The three people swam out of the cave and stood by the stairs. "Wait here",
said the girls, "we will distract the guard on the other side and you can climb
out here." So the girls swam to the other side, and ascended the stairs. The
guard noted that they had somehow neglected to cover their tender breasts, and
as he was interested in girls, he continued watched them.
  Meanwhile Bert slipped out of the pool unnoticed by him. Bert changed into
his normal clothes in the boys' cloakroom and the girls did so in the girls'
one. They met each other outside the swimming hall.
  "Now we shall go to my club", said Bert. They went there. Outside the door
Bert informed the girls about the new rules, and they agreed to all four of
them. After they had undressed, Bert took their clothes with him and opened the
door. They went inside, and Bert tied the girls' hands and legs with some
rope.

After Bert had introduced Louise to Nadja and Rebecka and vice versa, all three
girls lay on the bed and slowly and tenderly caressed each other's naked
bodies. Bert watched with interest, until he too joined the fun.
  It was very fun to Bert to lick the girls' naked breasts. He would have done
it all night, were it not for the door, which someone had just knocked on. He
opened it. Behind the ajar door stood his friend Åke and his little sister,
Doris. Doris had a very pretty dress on.
  "We came here to take a look at your new club", said Åke. "I hear it is doing
very well." "Oh, you. Åke and Doris", said Bert. "Well, then, Doris, do come
in!" And she did.
  When Åke was about to come in too, Bert intercepted him and informed him of
the new rules, to which they were forced to agree. Åke and Doris bid farewell
to each other. As Åke left the club, Bert noted that Doris was not sad for his
brother, but happy to see what Bert had in store for her.
  Doris undressed herself and Bert tied her up. Then she, too, lay on his bed.

Bert had a little game for the three teenage girls. He fetched three icecubes
from his refridgerator and explained the rules to the girls. "I will place one
icecube between each of you's breasts. They will start to melt and leave a
trail of cold water. The one of you whose water trail reaches her navel first
shall win."
  He placed the icecubes between the girls' breasts. They soon started to melt
due to the girls' body temperature. He watched the little water trails run
along the girls' naked bodies and heard the quiet plop as a drop of water fell
into Louise's navel.
  "Louise is the winner!" exclaimed Bert. "Here's her prize: We will all caress
her with the best of our love. Nadja, you take her left breast, and Rebecka
will take the right one. Doris can kiss her and I will just lick the rest of
her beautiful body."
  So they did just that. Nadja and Rebecka lovingly licked Louise's breasts,
while she and Doris kissed each other and Bert just licked her legs, stomach
and other places.

They slept the night at the club and were very happy. In the morning Bert had a
plan.
  He would visit the girls' homes, possibly with the girls accompanying him,
and collect their possessions. The girls would ensure their parents that Bert
was indeed operating with their permission.
  He already had all of his own possessions in the club and was about to fetch
the girls' possessions too. That way the could all live permanently in the club
without ever leaving it.
  The girls too approved of his plan, and it was set in action the same day.
