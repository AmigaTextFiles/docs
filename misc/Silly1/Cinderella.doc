A Different Cinderella
by JIPsoft 27. February 1992

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess named Cinderella. Unlike most
princesses, she wasn't a slave of a handsome prince nor chained forever into a
dungeon. She lived in a cottage with her step-mother and two step-sisters. They
treated her almost like a slave, but not exactly like a slave, which she would
rather want.
  One day, an envoy of the king came and said that the prince wants to have
slaves. Every beautiful maiden was to come to the palace where there would be a
contest of selecting the best slave material. Of course, the step-sisters
wanted to be the prince's slaves, so they dressed in their most beautiful
dresses and the step-mother chained, gagged and harnessed them to a carriage in
which they pulled her to the palace.

Poor Cinderella was left alone in her room, with her housework to do. She began
to sob, because she was true of heart and more suitable for a slave. Just that
moment, her fairy godmother appeared. She summoned a lovely dress, which was
made of rubber and had cloth stripes all over and an area of transparent
plastic which showed through her breasts. While she put it on, the godmother
summoned the strongest chains and gag, and used them on Cinderella.
  "Ah, and now for the transport.", said the godmother as she summoned a fine
carriage and an envoy. He harnessed Cinderella to the carriage and got in.
Cinderella began to pull it into the palace.
  When they got there palace, the envoy stepped out. Unharnessing Cinderella, he
said "the girl's codenamed Ashie." and left. Cinderella walked inside the
palace to be greeted by several other young girls also chained and gagged. The
prince said "I will hold four tests for you. The winner will be my personal
slave, and the runner-ups will do the housework of the palace. The rest of you
will be thrown to special dungeons at the bottom of the sea."

The first test began. The prince's assistent opened the girls' leg chains and
they were ordered to dance. While her step-sisters were clumsy and fell over
time after time, Cinderella herself danced light and fast as a feather. The
prince said, "'Ashie' is the winner."
  Then came the second test. The girls were leg chained again and were ordered
to clean the floor which was dirtied before. In the time the step-sisters had
cleaned a quarter of their area, 'Ashie' had cleaned her whole area and a half
of her neighbour's. She won again.

The third test was the most surprising. Firstly, the prince ordered some armed
guards to stand on the balcony surrounding the ball-room. Then, his assistant
opened the girls' leg and arm chains. "Ladies," the prince spoke, "perhaps you
have wondered why I have freed you from your chains. The reason is simple: You
now have to strip yourselves naked. The one who strips the most temptingly and
looks the prettiest naked wins."
  At that instant, every girl was mumbling, chaning her position and undressing
herself. The step-sisters simply took all their clothes off while standing
still. They were not even looked upon by the prince. But when Cinderella's turn
came, she undressed herself with such lure that the prince almost drooled as he
claimed 'Ashie' the winner.

The girls put their clothes back on and were chained. The fourth test was about
to begin. The prince said that it was a test of intelligence. Each girl was
given a pen and had her arm chains opened for writing purposes. An assistant
wrote several riddles on a blackboard. At the prince's command, every girl
turned away, revealed her breasts, and wrote the answers on them. Then, they
put their shirts back on.
  At the sound of a bell, the girls turned to face the prince, and each was in
turn to re-reveal her breasts so the prince could see the answers. The
step-sisters had got all the answers wrong, but Cinderella had them all right.

Just when the prince was about to enslave her, the clock began to strike
midnight. To everybody's amazement, Cinderella opened her leg chains and ran
away. She only left a shoe which was made of fur. Back home, her beautiful
dress vanished with her chains and gag, and she was left with her ordinary work
clothes. She thought that now she would never be a slave.
  The prince found the shoe and commenced a search for the girl to whom it
would fit. He had tried every single pretty girl in town, including the
step-sisters, who in fact were the most certainly not the shoe's owner, when
his eyes met Cinderella.
  Her step-mother and step-sisters began to laugh, but it was cut short when
the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly. At that instant, Cinderella stood in front
of the prince in her beatiful dress, chained and gagged.
  The prince was most delighted and walked to his palace with her. There she
would be his slave eternally.
  And they all lived happily ever after.

Nota bene: The shoe was indeed made of fur instead of glass. In the original
French story (without slavery) it was of vair, which means fur. It was later
confused with verre, which meant glass. They both sound the same (English
pronouncation veh-are).
