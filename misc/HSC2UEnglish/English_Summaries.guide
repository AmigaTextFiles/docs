@NODE JohnFoulcher "Poetry - John Foulcher - Study Guide"

@{u}John Foulcher:@{uu} - General Study Guide and analysis of 2 poems

@{b}@{u}For the Fire:@{ub}@{uu}
@{b}Narrator:@{ub} Either - Man walking by
                 - Man collecting twigs
                 - Fulcher himself

@{b}Attitude & Tone:@{ub} - Report style
                 - No emotions shown, except one of mystery
                   when he hears 'thuds'

@{b}Choice of words:@{ub} - Chosen for its simplicity. This comes from it's
                   6, 2 line stanzas. It is also seen from the fact
                   one thought is used per stanza
                 - Use of sentual words. Sounds are used to express
                   to the reader emotions and visuals for the reader
                   to visualize.
                 - Use of harsh words to show violence. The use of
                   things such as 'thud' (line 2) would give one
                   the impression of a person walking, but it is
                   actually a Kookaburra beating to death a lizard.
                   Other words depicting violence in this poem are
                   words such as 'hacks' and 'axe-blade'. Also the
                   use of 'a@{u}x@{uu}e-@{u}b@{uu}lade @{u}b@{uu}eak' gives the reader a
                   feeling of harshness

@{b}Use of violence@{ub}  - Shown in the poem through use of the following
@{b}and horror:@{ub}        words: 'sparse', 'dead','hacks', 'axe-blade',
                   'stunned open', 'pouting blood', clutching',
                   'bones are smashed', 'flays' and 'cold air
                   congealing'.

@{b}Purpose of Peom:@{ub} - To display several aspects of society, nature and
                   exploitation. Society is displayed like nature,
                   survival of the fitest. It also portrays man's
                   exploitation of many situations. (eg.press and
                   michael jacksons/royal family)

@{u}@{b}Martin and the Hand Grenades:@{ub}@{uu}
@{b}Narrator:@{ub}          Teacher
@{b}Scene:@{ub}             Class room (History lesson)
@{b}Meanings of@{ub}      - '@{i}..the class pauses/for history..@{ui}' has two
@{b}Specific Quotes:@{ub}   meanings/definitions. The first, more literal one
                   means the class is stopping to listen to a history
                   class. The second, more deeper meaning, is one
                   where the class stops to experience the past
                 - The word '@{b}bleak@{ub}' in the sentence, '@{i}his father's
                   bleak skill@{ui}' means somber or dull. It's also
                   a sign of negetivity
                 - The use of '@{i}...he fingers the serations...@{ui}' suggests
                   a sensual,sexual mood. This is in reference to how
                   the boy is handling the grenade. It is like he is
                   being taken to another world
                 - The word '@{b}bristles@{ub}' in the phrase '@{u}@{i}bristles@{uu}
                   with shrapnel/possibilities@{ui}', is an example of
                   a word which shows the anger of the narrator. He
                   talks about how the boy plays with an object which
                   can kill, or badly injure a person
                 - The line '@{i}...the spread/became too loose to catch a
                   man's mortality...@{ui}', means after a certain distance
                   it is no longer powerful enough to kill someone. The
                   effect of this line is one of sarcasm, questioning
                   sarcastically, why it only kills people that far away
                   and not futher
Additional Notes:  The classroom is a battle zone due to the way each
                   student is '@{i}wounded@{ui}' every time they hold the
                   grenade. The classes reaction to the grenade is one
                   of great excitment. This is a contrast to the
                   narrators views, who is in fact disgraced. This can
                   be seen as the teacher describes the experience
                   using the words, '@{i}tears the heart ahead@{ui}'.
                   This shows how each student is getting more than
                   excitment from the grenade, but is actually being
                   mentally effected by it

Only 2 poems are anaylised here, although 6 poems from each Poet should be
studied. An enourmous IFF (243k - 2480x3300x1) has been included which
contains summaries of 6 of his poems broken down into Narrator, Structure,
Attitude and Tone, and Purpose (for the poems: Summer Rain, Harry Wood,
Martin and the hand grenade, Loch Ard Gorge, For the Fire, and Bradman's
Last Innings).

@NODE Maestro "Maestro - 2U General English Study Guide"

@{u}Maestro:@{uu} - By Peter Goldsworthy - Study Guide

@{b}@{u}Background information on the writer - Peter Goldsworthy@{ub}@{uu}
This is his first book. Prior to writing this he had been writing
peotry. These days Peter Goldsworthy has been said to think of
this book as an immature attempt at writing.

@{b}Main themes:@{ub} 1. Exploration of Human Relationships
                @{b}Between@{ub} - Age and Youth
                        - Child and Parent
                        - Husband and Wife
                        - Adolescent Boys and Girls
                        - The members of the schoolyard sub-cultures
                        - People generally and their physical environment
                Relationships are linked and overlap each other

             2. - Love
                - Learning
                - Quest for perfection (Success/Failure)
                - Music
                - Culture

@{b}@{u}Background on book's settings:@{ub}@{uu}
- Darwin is remote and traditionally a non-cultural society
- Late 19th Century Vienna was the centre of European cultural
  life (also early 20th Century). Most talent at that time
  came from Vienna, and of those most were Jewish. With the
  arrival of Hitler, and the Holocaust, many of Vienna's
  talented people lost their jobs and were sent off to
  concentration camps
- Keller didn't flee Vienna as he thought if he became important
  enough (which he became very important and came to play for
  Hitler), his Jewish wife and son would be safe. This was not
  to be the case

@{u}                                                                  @{uu}

@{u}@{b}Maestro@{ub}@{uu}
(Eduard Keller)

He is: * Talented
       * Keeps himself remote/removed from others by not showing
         - certain feelings or acting kindly
       * Lacks the ability to compliment/praise and encourage others
       * An obscure, mysterious character (enigmatic)
       * An alcoholic
       * Cultured (contrast to Darwin)

- Keller's white clothing may indicate his @{u}real@{uu}, but hidden
  goodness. This "whiteness" is like holiness. This is a total contrast
  though to his self-perception
- Keller constantly collects clippings of newspaper articles. It seems
  he liked to study the behaviour of others to help him understand him
  self
- He believed that being a famous german citizen would save his jewish
  wife and child from the Nazi's. But this was not to be the case.
  How could this mistake occured?
- From this rigid, unhappy character Paul managed to find something
  there, which he came to love. What nature of love did Paul feel for
  Keller?

@{u}                                                                  @{uu}

@{u}@{b}Paul Crabbe@{ub}@{uu}

He is: * Adaptable
       * Witty
       * And for an Australian Teenager, quick and clever with the
         rhetoric
       * Talented (But not to the degree his parent's think he is)
       * At time he is arrogant
       * Cultured

- Paul doesn't accept Bennie Reid, at the same time Reggie Lim
  doesn't accept him till Paul shows how he can adapt to @{b}their@{ub}
  style of music and contribute to it. From Paul adapting, him and
  the others gain something in common ground, but this is at paul's
  convenience. This contrast adds a different dimension to the
  story, and is evident till the end

- When the novel starts he is 15 years old, arrogant and self-centered
  at times. He comes from a well educated family. This is a contrast
  considering the place they are living in is Darwin. Darwin is considered
  as '@{b}low-culture@{ub}' place, while Paul's family is '@{b}high culture@{ub}'

- The people in the Band Paul joins are not the type of people he would
  naturally hang around

- He is very aware of others and their games, such as the ones his
  parent's play with him, but he is not very self-perceptive though
  It can also be seen in Paul's understanding of Keller, from getting
  an incomplete picture of Keller, from what he does.

@{b}@{u}Summary of Plot:@{ub}@{uu}
@{u}1968:@{uu}
* Development of Paul to Adult
* Shows more involvement in friends and Darwin, School and life
* Paul <-> Keller - Change in Relationship
   |         |
   |       Becomes less secretive - shows emotional side

                                      Keller
* Paul asks questions about Vienna from intrest in performing there
* Keller's response about Vienna - "... a city of show veneer" (pg.65)
                                 - "The experimental Labratory for
                                    the end of the World"
* Keller reads fascinating, horrorfying, grotesque, ugly in his
  scrapbook - deals with human suffering. With these books he
  hopes to learn from others mistakes. His inner reasons for
  this are probably to gain some sort of relief, or find some
  clues about his wife
* "If only at your age I had such text books" - reference to books
  given to Paul showing him the horror of war, something keller wish
  he saw at Paul's age
* Kellers behaviour at concert: - Keller openely betray's grief
                                - Loss of self-control
                                - Shows emotional side
* On going to one lesson, as Paul is walking up the stairs to Keller's
  room for his lesson, he hears Keller playing. Paul is moved by the
  beauty of the music. But this reminds Keller of his wife, as he
  plays it, which causes him grief
* "@{i}Dont trust the beautiful@{ui}" - Keller
* Relationship with Rosie
* '@{i}Sexual relationship@{ui}' with Megan

@{u}Adelaide:@{uu}
* Paul joins the school band '@{i}Ruff Stuff@{ui}' to annoy Keller.
  In this Paul has control over band members more popular than him.
  In the band is: Jimmy Pappas (popular), Scott (megan's boyfriend)
* Enters his first piano competition - doesn't succeed (comes 3rd)
* "Paul is my best student, yes. One in a thousand, but a concert
  Pianst one in a million." - Keller thinks of Paul as a promising
  student, so Keller didn't want Paul to leave yet
* Stage of final meeting between Keller and Paul (in which Keller
  has planned earlier, and in preperation re-aranges his house/room).
* Paul is at the beginning of adult life
* In this final meeting, Keller is ready to open up, and say all
  his secrets. This is also the last time Rosie is to be in Darwin.
  Paul's aroused sexual preference overwealms him and he leaves Keller
  before Keller can open up - at the point Keller was FINALLY ready,
  he left to go to Rosie.

@{u}Last Section - 1974 - Vienna, 1975, 1977:@{uu}
(Coda - Completed / End)

* No light relief (serious)
* End of book is an anticlimax (in some people's opinion)
* Nothing new discovered
* Paul will never ever be the genius he wanted to be. Reflects
  back on his life of a wasted ambition of perfection, a musical
  perfection he never achieved, only a technical one.

@NODE Amigaware "What is Amigaware?"

         @{b}What is Amigaware?@{ub}
         ------------------

         Amigaware is a new concept, as it has been invented by
         me. What Amigaware is, if you use this program alot,
         or any Amigaware program, you will either go out and
         buy an Amiga product, or instead sell off other non-Amiga
         computer equipment you own (and with the money maybe buy
         an Amiga product). This concept is very similar to
         freeware, as all benefits of this program do not go
         to me, but to you and other Amiga users. It also could
         be described as self-giftware. :-)

         How did this idea come about?
         -----------------------------
         It came about when I was sick of people selling up
         their Amiga's to port over to other lesser machines.
         So I decided hey, do something to support the Amiga,
         which will benefit ALL Amigans. As mentioned above
         Amigaware does NOT benefit me!, it benefits everyone.

         Well, How does anyone know Im a supporter?
         ------------------------------------------
         If you can send me in a receipt with proof of sale of
         a non-Amiga computer product, or Amiga product bought
         as a result of reading this then if you send me a
         disk with your address enclosed I will give you a free
         copy of the code of this program. I normally would
         charge for the code. Also when you send me your proof
         of purchase I will in my next Amigaware program
         include your name in a list of Amigaware supporters.
