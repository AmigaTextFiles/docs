The Jokin' Around Disk. Choc-a-block with jokes of all descriptions. As you
already know, some of these jokes are rude, crude, vulgar, stupid, gross,
ridiculous, insane, and generally good for a giggle. We take NO responsibility
for any offence taken by reading these jokes. They have been collected from
many sources over a period of about one year and quite a number of them have
been transferred from other operating systems. So, we didn't write them, we 
just spent an incredible amount of time collecting, compiling and sorting 
them out. 
   As far as we're concerned, you can do whatever you like with these files,
just be aware that someone else typed the text and although there may not be
a copyright notice with each file, the text is still copyrighted by the
original writer (whoever that may be - copyright usually expires 50 years 
after the death of the author). If you want to use the text in any commercial
way, you can simply read a joke, then type it in your own words!! Easy ain't
it!! 

   All of the text files were obtained from Public Domain or Freely
Distributable Sources and may be freely copied.

   Now go for it, forget the mortgage payments, don't worry about tomorrow,
warm up your laughing gear and have a bloody good laugh!!!!
