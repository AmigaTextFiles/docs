Quiet...

Still...

You feel there's nothing going on
Until you release
The space behind your eyes
Is filling up with something like peace
Your thoughts seize
Pleasure grows in your soul

Your thoughts seize
Pleasure grows in your soul

NOT ENUFF LOVE

[Chorus]
Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round

Now when you climb [fade]
And when you lock [fade]
Just think of those
out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round.

[Maxi Jazz]
Until you wake up
You people need a shake up
You take up so much time
Worrying, Scurrying,
Here, there,
Losing your hair
No money to spare
No love to share
No wonder you appear under pressure from here
You look fresh, yeah
But all I got is dirt in my hair
My nightmares manifest,
But I can escape
Yours is in your chest
With no form or shape
The tape is running
I push the button to send
Upon each other we all depend
Message end

Whoever asks my name
Or where I came from
People fear contamination
If they chary too long
I carry a strong
Sin of despair
It's in the air
I'm broken and hard to repair
I may mistaken be
But I patiently wait
On the path to humanity
I sit at the gates

[Chorus]
Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round

Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round

[Maxi Jazz]
Dirty, Cold, Hurting, Soul,
Down the river
My liver in bad condition
Like my skin
Rain falling, once again
I'm in my bed
Hurt the time in
I'm gonna struggle for air
There's hair in my food
When I get it usually someone already half ate it
Touch it, not to let it
Get me down
But my head starting to pound
People go round, and round and round

From one I get a cigarette
A little more love found
But the ground is still wet
My teeth are chattering
And there's a spattering of seeds
I sometimes lose all feeling in my feet
When I sleep I'll do my deep in the mainstream
But unaccountably my heart was growing
Small and mean
A hurry past
Wretched people I pretend I haven't seen
But there's money in my pocket
And my clothes are clean?

[Maxi Jazz 4x]
I said money in my pocket
But I just can't give no love
Money in my pocket
But I just can't give no love

[Chorus]
Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round
'Cause there is not enough love to go round

@NODE WeCome1 "We Come 1"

WE COME 1

All the subtle flavors of my life
Are become bitter seeds
And poisoned leaves
Without you

You represent what's true
I drain the color from the sky
And turn blue
Without you

These arms lack a purpose
Flapping like a humming-bird
I'm nervous cause
I'm the left eye
You're the right

Would it not be madness to fight
We come 1

In you the song which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now, in you

We come 1

I'm unafraid
Never never scared
Worries washed
Pressed air
I am the left eye
You're the right
Would it not be madness to fight

We come 1

@NODE CreazyEnglishSummer "Creazy English Summer"

CRAZY ENGLISH SUMMER

Fields of fire that passed the train
The sky is victorious but here comes the rain
Friday is taking me home again,
And I've nothing but you on my mind.

Grass is greener without the pain,
I think that I'm changing but I'm just the same
My sun is a ascending again
And I've nothing but you on my mind

Sometimes I feel like I'm glad to be free,
Sometimes I still want your arms around me
Sometimes I'm glad to have left you behind,
The crazy english summer has put you back on my mind.
Life's a riot a lover a friend,
Pity the day that it has to end
Friday come speed me home again,
I've nothing but you on my mind.

Sometimes I feel like I'm fine on my own,
Fifty thousand miles from home.
Sometimes I'm weak and the past is my guide,
Summer returns and puts you back on my mind

@NODE MuhammadAli "Muhammad Ali"

MUHAMMAD ALI

If all you keep hearing it so long you will see me as a super star
And you'll have time to waste with your minions and tink
I see your face in front of me,
Still grainy from that old black and white tv
My whole family silenced,
Watching you shape destiny with your 2 hands,
Faster than the eye can see.

Mesmerizing

You know what skinny little me started to struggle,
10 years old suddenly bold
Cause I resolved to live like my hero in the ring,
Be smart never give an inch,
No retreat when I'm wrapped up
Respect from teachers, red necks
And creatures who attack in a pack
Like incensed never seen the light not before or
Since a young prince
And I remain convinced of his invincibility
Athletic agility, virility,
Seen your free spirit for every through eternity stings
Like a bee mr muhammed ali

I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!

Your achievements defy belief from the belly of the beast rising like yeast,
My release from low self esteem
Came when I saw you rapping on my tv screen.
Float like a butterfly,
That describes my walk to school after fight night
I felt so cool cause I was at place too,
Love myself born slippy
Outta love for you,
And I knew that someday people would love me too.
None of that heckling about my black skin got through,
I would walk bare foot through hell for you,
It was how I felt back then I would still do for you,
So accept these humble words of praise,
And my gratitude for those glorious days
And your victorious ways,
Instilled in the young minds,
Skill sublime yours to mine!

I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!
I want to know who you are!

ONE STEP TOO FAR

[dido]
You can sleep forever, but still you will be tired
You can stay as cold as stone, but still you won't find peace
With you I feel I'm the meek leading the blind
With you I feel I'm just spending wasting time

I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm with you (with you)
It's always one step too far
One step too far

You can walk too far but still you won't be found
You can look down on the world but still you won't find love
You won't find love

[maxi jazz]
Only with mellow
Are you thin enough to slide through,
Don't let nothin' ride u,
If the sun or the moon would give way to doubt,
They would immediately go out.
Only one swallow doesn't make a summer
But u gotta start somewhere (maxi's bit)

[dido]
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm with you (with you)
It's always one step too far
One step too far

I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm with you (with you)
It's always one step too far
One step too far

@NODE Tarantula "Tarantula"

TARANTULA

Down in the shadows of your deepest secrets
I sleep next to the precepts you hold most dear
Your heart is in my province jour upon hour
I shiver when you feel the cold,
Everything you say I hear
Like a bomb and it's fuse,
We bring bright light
But I could be a devil to you
I could bite like a tarantula
Right through the skin
And leave my poison dream
Deliciously unsuspecting
Protecting you from all harm
Except perhaps from reasoning

@NODE GivingMyselfAway "Giving Myself Away"

GIVING MYSELF AWAY

In background - "do what I have to"
Remember emily?
[in background - "that's a long time" 2x]
In a long dress one summers day she said yes
Now every special requests requires another
So many times it feels endless, a big yes
Branded red on each breast
But she selfless out there
Doing her best strangest scene
Nobody seemed to be impressed.
The more she do for this fool
The more she behind schedule
Had no fun for so long
Old records turned her onto high school flings
And she was full of daring

Colorful hair used to wear thirteen rings
Now she staring gludgery
Full in the face and accepts it as her place
And just incase there's anything she missed,
She recheck the list
Does it over again,
To make sure it's spotless.

Jimmy longed for how it used to be,
She was viscous and volatile
She was feisty, iced tea was the tipple never asked nicely
Her lips used to curl down ever so slightly, impolite,
Fire burned bright behind the oakley,
We just had to get to grips.

After a few long sipped juice begin to lose flavour,
She no longer gets to savor being consumed.
Jimmy sleeps drunk in the other room still in his shoes escaping head long into the booze,
The whole house vibrating with the changes of moods.

From feisty she turned into being nice to me
In the old days he'd of been wearing ice t,
Jimmy cradles times return,
She was fine and so beautifully unconcerned.

Jimmy told her on the day he quit
You don't love me you love the relationship

Me?
I'm the prodeney product of misogheny,
Jimmy and emily harmogeny
They promised me nothing but honesty,
And that's all I got,
I could never be the cement in their destiny,
They still haven't forgiven me,
You know my own woman is leaving me
Said she stopped believing me,
Cant even see what she saw in me,
I told my woman she was beautiful,
She didn't believe,
Convinced herself I was preparing to leave,
So she took my son and left the world free.

I told my woman she was beautiful ten times a day,
Ten times a day she would smile, and look away.

I end up throwing my love down a bottomless pit.
And giving myself away...

@NODE Evergreen "Evergreen"

EVERGREEN

Running with my rain face on
Today I woke up feeling sad
I know that you said,
That one day I would be glad
Hold the choirs of winter,

The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves I came to love are falling
Ribbons on evergreen, owls that pull them apart
I can hear you singing my funny valentine
Oh you know that breaks my heart
Hold the choirs of winter,
The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves I came to love

Oh you know that breaks my heart
Oh you know that breaks my heart

Running with my rain face on
No idea of what to say
No idea of who to do
In this fear that never goes
Waiting for all my dreams
Oh you know it breaks my heart
Hold the choirs of winter,
The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves I came to love

Oh you know it breaks my heart
Oh you know it breaks my heart
Oh you know that breaks my heart

@NODE Liontamer "Liontamer"

LIONTAMER

[maxi jazz]
If you place a thing into the center of your life
That lacks the power to nourish
It will eventually poison everything that you are
And destroy you

A simple a thing as an idea
Or your perspective on yourself of the world
No one can be the source of your contempt,
It lies within, in the center.
Only with mellow while your thin enough to slide through
Only with mellow while your thin enough to slide through

Don't let nothing ride you.

If the sun or the moon should keel away to die,
They would immediately go out .

One.

Swallow don't make a sound,
But tomorrow has to start somewhere.

Newspapers entertain,
Lion tamers die in pain
This child wise beyond words
Whose tears flow without seize

Newspapers entertain,
Lion tamers die in pain
This child wise beyond words
Whose tears flow without seize

[zo? johnston]
When there's no where, left to run to
Let me come to you, let me help you down
For when the world, gives you tomorrow
Your gonna learn to live again

We can learn to go,
Oh learn as we go

Just to live, for the day
I know it's hard, to live for the moment
Just try, anyway

[maxi jazz]
Newspapers, lion tamers, this child,

@NODE TheGarden "The Garden"

THE GARDEN

Beg you listen me, don't be kissing me 'til I'm done
Unsung champion, reason, like seasoning
Pepper your thoughts with spice, and entice you to a space
Where I dwell with bass players and layers and loops
Think what I think with my prayers. It's nice. My world is everything I've become
Contained in the hum between voice and drum
I'm coming from the same place I'm still running from
But even sitting in the garden one can still get stung

@NODE BringMyFamilyBack "Bring My Family Back"

BRING MY FAMILY BACK

I'm on lonely street age nearly three
Recently Mama's crying all the time
is it because of me or my younger sister,
even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister,
crying like he missed her.
Since we moved away from the house,
where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it,
Mama never say nothing about it.
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling,
maybe I'm to blame. So I strain to listen,
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile,
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave
she took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours.
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
[??]. Wanted to make the cash
quick so I had to work real late.
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
making tea for the bosses.
Making free with me,
and I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three,
this doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely,
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen
on my computer display.
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track
if I don't get my family back.

I want my family back

I'm on Lonely Street, number fifty three.
Boarded up property,
I'll probably get pulled down.
Litter all around inside there's
no sound and no light.
But yo it gets busy at night, People creeping.
Derelicts sneaking to fix. Speaking.
On the way my timbers creaking,
Roof leaking. And bricks coming loose,
knee high in refuse.
But even though I'm a slum,
I'm still of some use.
There was a time when my walls where decorated.
And under my roof children where educated.
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed,
a crash in the economy robbed me of my family.
And no strategy, combats negative equity,
so that's it. Like violence it's drastic.
I'm freaking, and seeking to be
more than just a house for crack.
Somebody bring my family back.

HOUR OF NEED

You know that I'm foolish, playing king for a day
I hang with my people whenever I can.
You say that I'm scruffy, misguided and blue,
like a fly on a string.
There's a web that surrounds you, but I will
find a way in.
Yeah, in your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will.
Yeah, in your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will.

You lay a place at your table, let me sleep in your bed
Yeah you hurt and confused me, but your my queen for a
day

I know I'm foolish, harsh and unfair
'Cause in my hour of need, I know you've always been
there

And in your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will
In your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will
I'll be there, yes I will
In you hour of need I'll be there, yes I will (3x)

POSTCARDS

Dido:
My love has gone
His boots no longer by my door
He left at dawn and as I slept, I felt him go
[Loop of Erik Satie, as in Pet Shop Boys' Jack The Lad]

Maxi Jazz:
New York, New York, temperature's droppin'
The band's out shoppin', not stoppin' 'til ears pop
Cops protect shops, lots of yellow cabs and bellhops
And it never stops
I'm waitin' to do an interview, so much to tell you
Today I feel close enough to smell you
Additional dates they were plannin' just fell through
Florida's out
We fly September 22 to Heathrow,
but there's not really long to go
Tonight will be a brilliant show
Lettin' you know I miss you
More than four hits the floor at a party
Send my love to everybody
Please, send my love to everybody
(everybody everybody everybody...)
Send my love to everybody
(everybody everybody everybody...)

Honey, I'm writin' from D.C., feelin' queasy
Stayin' healthy on the road isn't easy
The TM recommends an antigen
One of them could resist again
I miss you like a lock in the door
What's more, I go to sleep with my Walkman
'cause half the crew snored
Don't mean to be a bore, everybody's been great,
But there's fifteen of us in a bus state-to-state
So I stay up late with a tape, or meditate
My bed is travellin' at fifty-five m.p.h.
When we make it to LA, I'll still be miles away
It's not my best day
I'm a get some rest, God bless

Dido:
My love has gone
(wo wo)
My love has gone
(has has has ...)
(wo wo)

Maxi Jazz:
We just stopped a diner so I'm takin' time to write a few lines
I'm fine, sunshine, the bus driver's
reclinin' by the grass as the trucks pass
Gleamin' with the flash of sunlight from the glass on the windscreen
As for us, there's too much to relate
We've done five gigs, yet we're only in our third state
America's big, you'd love how they pile up your plate
Only place in the world even I can gain weight
Our next date is Wilmington, Delaware
Open air, there's a rumor Melle Mel'll be there
Anyway, all my love, God bless, I'm yawning
I really miss watching you get dressed in the morning

Dido:
My love has gone
(wo wo)
My love has gone
(wo wo)
My love has gone
No earthly ships will ever
Bring him home

WHY GO?

Don't go
I didn't know you'd be here, and I wasn't meant to come.
I'd be sitting watching TV if there was anything decent on,
if I'd missed the taxi or found nothing good to wear.
But for some uncertain reason, some strange uncertain reason,
this is how it all it all began.

(Why go?) Why go, (when you could stay awhile)?
(Why go?) Why go, (when you could stay awhile)?

If I made some coffee, would you sit and talk some more?
I know words are usually pointless when you've used them all before.
The way your smile fills the room --
Stay awhile. Kick off your shoes. Don't go. Please stay. --
It always happened this way.

(Why go?) Why go, (when you could stay awhile)?
(Why go?) Why go, (when you could stay awhile)?
The way your smile fills the room --
Stay awhile. What's there to lose? --
The way you laugh, when I say, Don't go. Please stay.
Why go? Why go, when you could stay awhile?
Why go? Why go, when you could stay awhile,
when you could stay with me tonight?
Tonight?

SHE'S MY BABY

Maxi Jazz:
Mmm, come to papa
I see you working,
through the beat curtain in the kitchen.
Switchin, leavin' me twitchin',
I'm itchin' to be kissin' you
But discipline is the rule,
so I sit my own juicy [??] in that cool sheet
Irresistible
We fool around twice a week, she make me weak
Nice when she put her tongue in my cheek
Not petite, baby got a large physique
She take charge, take me where I dare not repeat
I go ... like a hi-hat, plantin' kisses on your back
You like that, Mrs. X, reputation intact
Nobody in my block know we're like down like that
And the next flat, one down from where I live with my mum
And Uncle John, he ain't my uncle when it's been far too long
But me and she been going strong, almost a year
Wait 'til the coast is clear, I don't bolt for fear of getting caught
Maybe we ought to start, maybe not
For now, my baby gets all I got
Boom, how come we always trash the room?
Grab your coat 'cause you know someone'll be home soon
And now you see there be a need to explain gently
Why this mother of three is playin' games with me
She's my baby
(yeah)
She's my baby

Chorus:
she's my baby (2x), sweets my baby
she's my baby (2x), sweets my baby

Maxi Jazz:
I'm a slave to your outrage
Rocket rocks give shocks, and a row cage
Color-coded alloys, much noise, [??] poise
Exalt enough to know the roots of old age
Yes yes. Who got the keys to my R?
As we goin' on a road test, hit the M4 and head west
Forever impressed, with the sound of my two-liter
We cover ground, engine singin' like Anita Baker
And if I take a corner too quick you get sick, when I do my handbrake
trick
Watch me ride, me broadside's wide like a battleship
Side slip, push, only hip, stick it in gear and get the gas uplift
It never failed to bring a grin to the limb
Baby's equipped
me and she gone clear
I got quick reduction on my understeer
I been fairly and squarely described as hairy
People say my baby is scary
Look, you pays your money and you takes your choice
I just love to hear my baby's voice
She's my baby

Chorus:
She's my baby (2x), sweets my baby
She's my baby (2x), sweets my baby

Maxi Jazz:
I roll up her position, everything's in position
my friend's demonstrating [??]
I listen for a minute before taking sides
Sleep the eyes, on the limit, sit down and spin it like we do
Every Friday, 'round my way where I play before we..
No alcohol is a rule
My baby gets passed around I don't frown
I love to see my friends getting down
When it's just me and she you know it's never precarious
But sharing with your buddies is hilarious
Variously we argue and
Disagree and get heated
Have to tell my people that we see it and we start the anti-stress process
'Til there's a big mess of twigs and seeds to meet your needs
[??] hello: clarity, mellow
She's my baby

Chorus:
She's my baby (2x), sweets my baby
She's my baby (2x), sweets my baby

This is where I heal my hurt
It's in the world I become
Content in the hum
Between voice and drum
It's in change

Respect, love, compassion
This is my church
This is where I heal my hurt

Why should such violence, such pain hang between you and me
When love should be a queen on her throne looking after her own
I wish I could be touched by the hem of his garment
Two chairs, this table, one leg, in this house
Seriously, I think we could be,
Feel we could be, touched by the hem of his garment

@NODE Killer'sLullaby "Killer's Lullaby"

KILLER'S LULLABY

I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home,
conceding defeat with a low moan
Hangin' in A sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone
I bought him coffee and a snack,
settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes,
try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach 'll burst,
feel like I've been cursed.
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock,
this place is like a padlock
You look shocked.
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust,
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys
Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near,
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part
That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found,
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges at the thought
of syringes

J (as in Jerome), I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows,
oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
cage
And write another stage into a new age,
it's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Jerome took me home under steel skies
Knowing I'm prone to dramatize but unknown for telling lies
And what I verbalize he can see behind my eyes
The why oh why's that identify killer lullabies
And he surmised
No surprise couldn't hear that
Closed my eyes as he steered that old black BM home again
Not knowing how and not knowing when.

@NODE Insomnia "Insomnia"

INSOMNIA

Deep in the buzzem of the gentle night
Is where I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle a fight
Dark forces in the clear moonlight without fear
Insomnia.

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stress, making access,
Mess in darkness, no electricity
Something's all over me
Greasy Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I often return without sees
Like a curse
Open my eyes and rise like yeas

At least.
A couple of weeks since I last slept
Kept, taking sleepers,
But now I keep myself pep
Deeper still
The night, I write by candle light
I find inside
Fundamental movement

So when it's black
This insomniac
Take an original tack
Take the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep

I can't get no sleep

REVERENCE

Watch me ride...
Take the words and the bass,
Taste, and then swallow me,
You're chasing the devil
Cos you're level if you follow me
For quality, and I make no apology
For linking my thinking with computer technology.
Cos this is like a modern day hymn
For the new church,
I search for the truth,
I've got a hole in my tooth,
I'm uncouth, yes sir,
I'm from the street university
Where we learn to earn even in times of adversity.
And I will find it a easy when you're out a hard time,
Petite crime sometimes,
But now I'm inclined to find
A fresh direction, kiss me neck,
Check out the funky section.
Cos this is the part where I start to rip up words,
A comfort coming straight from my heart,
I'm not a mystic,
My views are realistic, simplistic,
One special brew I get pissed quick,
And get sick so I don't do it no more,
I won't find peace of mind
Rolling around on the floor.
The point I want to make,
The mistake is to take without giving,
From within,
You know how I'm living,
I'm cool, I'm looking after myself,
And I could never place wealth before my spirit,
I feel it's unhealthy,
The devil creep around you so stealthy, stealthy
'Till you get bold, rush the gold,
And before you're much older,
You're soul is sold, where's it getting ya,
Competition starts swearing ya,
Gold - diggers setting you up,
Soon be forgetting your existence,
Do you need a for instance,
I have to admire your persistence
In sticking to a game plan,
That brings you pain man,
And at the end of the day nothing is gained,
So listen to the voice within,
I'll see ya later,
Pay heed to the Grand Oral Disseminator.
Quite still you feel there's nothing going on
Until you realize the space behind your
Eyes is filling up with something like peace
As your thoughts cease some pleasure grows in your soul.
I aint a Christian
Sometimes I feel like diss'in em
But listen I'm just trying to tell you what I know
If you would once relax, chill to the max
These words on wax will cause sweet bells to ring in your soul.
If I say God is alive I know you'll want to know why babies die, food don't grow. Why?
Trains smash, plans crash,
Situation mash and slam bam
Your fellow man - money's in fashion
It aint rational, because dammit, he didn't just give us the planet
And its wealth, inside your soul he left a piece of himself, his voice is small
I keep lying and trying,
Denying the call from inside
You can't hide responsibility
So decide from today just who it's going to be,
Thou shalt have no other God but me,
So set you free see,
But you'll have to listen,
And who's that false idol
I see you kissing?
Money, success and untold wealth, good health
And all you have to do is love yourself.
It's a fact you'll attract all the things that you lack,
So just chill
And get off the race track
And take a pace back, face facts,
It's your decision,
You don't need eyes to see,
You need vision,
Continue to view the lord as being separated
And you'll be living a lie that's being perpetrated,
For many centuries, I'm on a mission I want to mention these facts,
These facts in my rap,
I don't sing,
But I want to share the peace that they bring,
My name is G. O. D.
The Grand Oral Disseminator.

DON'T LEAVE

Packing your bags like people in the movies do,
All severe, and not saying a word,
And I'm sitting down here just watching you,
And I'm thinking:
Where is all the love gone?
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave,
You got me hurting,
Don't leave
You know it's never been easy to love someone like me,
Oh, don't leave.
Hanging with friends like we used to do,
I didn't know anything was wrong,
And last night while I was thinking it through,
Trying to find who am I and what do you need me to do?
Don't leave.
There's a record you used to play,
There's Joannie (as in Mitchel??) singing
'best to be without you',
And I know just what she's singing for,
Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave.
You got me hurting,
Don't leave.
You know it's never been easy to love someone like me,
Oh, don't leave.
Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave.
We'll fly around the world, give you what you're giving me,
I should have dressed you up in pearl,
Finest silk to touch your skin,
Don't know how to write a love song,
But Don't leave.
You got me hurting,
Don't leave.
You know it's never been easy to love someone like me,
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
Don't leave.

SALVA MEA

How can I change the world if I can't even change myself?
I cannot change the way I am?
I don't know, I don't know.
I take a look at the world behind these eyes,
Every nook, every cranny reorganize,
Realize my face don't fit the way I feel.
What's real?
I need a mirror to check my face is in place,
Incase of upheaval, fundamental movement below,
What's really going on I want to know,
But yo, we don't show on the outside, so slide.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...
I need a mirror for my spirit,
Yeah, can you feel it?
When I get deep, want to hear myself sleep,
Not drowning, tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud,
I wonder what it's like to be dead,
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot,
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...
I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep,
The pills ain't cheep but the bills are steep,
So I {?} with a booze and a spiff,
Try to snooze,
But who's dreaming, this is win or loose,
Put down the drink, try not to think,
Let it go, fundamental movement below,
And yo, reality is dreaming,
Just below my skin I'm screaming...

IF LOVIN' YOU IS WRONG

Watch me ride:
I'm a sexual animal, eat you like a cannibal,
Crammed full of energy,
I'm inflammable,
Yeah, I finish my beer
So come here and get nice while I lick you here,
Put your legs over there and kind of swing on the chair,
I swear you look wicked with your panties in your hair,
Eyes half closed,
Cute little nose,
And like a pound of self - raising I just rose and rose,
Stepped out of my clothes started doing the right thing,
I was pumping and she was biting,
Yeah, lightning flashed and thunder roared,
The girl had her finger on my keyboard,
Oh lord, this is gonna last all night,
If lovin' you is wrong I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
If I come first well that's the worse scenario,
I push you harder than Sanchez Vicario,
I mean it, 20th Century Fox on the screening,
One take like an earthquake make the bed brake,
We be famous worldwide overnight
And get tired of magazine articles we're forced to write.
I take a delight in making the bed springs sing all night,
If lovin' you is wrong I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
I give a massage,
Skin supercharge,
Imagination on turbo situation large,
Sometimes you handle me kinda course,
Like a horse, the bed {??}
{??} keep from flying.
I got my teeth in her neck...
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.
If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

ANGELINE

You've been out on the tiles,
Winning the smiles of men of low persuasion,
But I know you drink yourself crawling in the street until dawn,
Girl you look like a bad dream,
You've been places I've never been.
Come home, come home Angeline.
Come home, come home Angeline.
You've been places I've never been.
You took the small change from the job in the hall,
Be back in an hour but you're not back at all.
The children are crying, the flowers are dying,
There's no food on the table,
I don't think I'm able to cope,
You've been places I've never been.
Come home, come home Angeline.
Come home, come home Angeline.
You've been places I've never been.
Cheap perfume and alcohol, dancing on tables,
With kissing for strangers all laughing and howling,
And jokes and tall tales that ain't funny at all,
Bluffers and smugglers, boozers and gamblers,
Jump old queens and tarts at the babbled bar.
Oh, they've been pushing you too far.
Come home, come home Angeline.
Come home, come home Angeline.
You've been places I've never been.
Come home, come home Angeline.
Come home, come home Angeline.
You've been places I've never been.

DIRTY OL' MAN

He's a dirty old man,
And a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
I'm a dirty old man
The mean streets are home,
My life is cold,
I'll chill you to the bone,
Heart of stone, Have a care,
I carry traces of death in my hair,
You know my breath stinks,
I leave shit everywhere,
So be aware
I'm unfeeling
Don't you dare try appealing to my better nature,
You better wait,
you're missinformed,
Ain't nothing warm about me,
Cold and gray,
concrete clay and steel,
And what else is real?
I mean the actual deal,
People seem to love living under my hair,
Some of them call me London,
I'm also known as New York.
Anywhere in the world you find me I talk the same bad talk,
Walk the same walk from side to side,
You're transparent to me,
There ain't a thing you can hide,
Derive glamour from the stamina it takes to survive.
You think I didn't know it's over with your face like a rat
Now give me your cash and go
Before you're heart brakes,
You're living under my wing
And all you got I'm gonna take,
I'm a dirty old man.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
I'm a rough old man beyond heart ache,
To improve my mood I could use an earthquake,
I sit awake for my people to release the pain,
So I can know peace again
In my skin, sin diceit and mistrust soaked in,
I think I might just fuss
Often drops of woe, streets flow with tears,
I fall down all around your ears.
If I could, if I was made of wood start a fire, no lie,
I can afford to smoke sacred fire,
Cos I wouldn't bet on people changing just yet
My eyes are wet and my heart is full of fear and regret,
So you're catching the rough edge of my tongue,
I started young, I got teenagers carrying guns.
I hear you wanna hold me to blame, but we're the same,
So for me win society and feel the shame, I'm a rough old man.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
I'm a rough old man, this is who I am.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.

Dido:
'Bout a month ago, I've never seen your face -
I've never heard your voice. 'Bout a month ago.
I'm a careful hunter and I have to say -
Before I found your love. 'Bout a month ago.

Are you my boy or the flowerstand man -
You bought such color to this place.
Are you my boy or the flowerstand man -
With you I'm laid back.

I don't care if every river runs so dry.
I don't care if every species were to die.
I don't care about the Ozone layer -
I wouldn't notice if it wasn't there, oh no.

I don't care if we sell - coke to Africa.
I don't care about apartheid.
I wouldn't notice if it all get better.
I don't care about the starving who've died.

You're my boy when, the way you live and breathe -
I don't care about anything but you.
You're my boy when, the way you live and breathe -
I don't care about anything but you.

BASEBALL CAP

Oh, smack, there goes my baseball cap I'm on the floor,
I think I took a burse to my jaw,
Jumped me from behind at least three, maybe four,
I never see my hat no more.
Oh, smash. There goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
14 years old and hard to the core,
I'm walking home making plans for war,
My hands was cut, my uncle says 'what's up?'
Let me guess, your clothes are in a mess, you're in distress,
Sit down, take five and let me look at your knees,
Your still alive son, please take it easy
Sometimes you have to let the world know you're not bluffing,
But enough is enough, don't loose your life over nothing,
Scuffling in the street is no way to die,
And I don't want to have to meet your mama's eye,
So try and listen hard before you fall into the trap
Of making war over a baseball cap.
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap,
It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
I can't get it back.
