                My Roots


"Now's the time for a little sugar juice", I thought. And so I went to my
sugarbeet farm. I would take a sugarbeet and put it into the root juice
loosener I had just bought from Japan.
  But alas! As I bent down to take the root, I noticed that it was stolen. And
not just it, but all of my delicious sugarbeet roots had been stolen. I was
very furious, because this meant that I wouldn't have any sugar juice left to
drink.

I wondered who would have committed this theft. It could be any of my
relatives, for all of them had access to my sugarbeet farm. Then I began to
sort the relatives out in my mind. It could not have been my aunt Ada, for she
is allergic to sugar. It could neither have been my uncle Benjamin, for he was
in hospital after a crash with the missile carrier vehicle he had been driving.
  The choice narrowed to two: my aunt Cecilia and my uncle David. Since uncle
David lived right next door to me, he was the obvious suspect. But, I thought,
he was too obvious: he would have taken notice of this, and leave the theft
uncommitted, because he knew I would first think of this. But I was smarter
than him. I would leave him in peace and trace aunt Cecilia instead.

The beginning of the chase was not easy. I hurried down twenty-eight floors to
aunt Cecilia's apartment, only to find it locked. I destroyed the door with my
flamethrower and found a notice in the hall. It said: "To all who have
destroyed the door with a flamethrower: I'm vacationing in the Antarctic."
  So I bought her a new door, and went to the travel agency she favoured the
most. The clerk told me she had indeed gone to the Antarctic. The flight had
left a week ago, and was now landing onto the Antarctic.
  I booked another flight to the Antarctic. After two and a half hours, the
plane took off. Since I was flying a Lockheed fighter, and aunt Cecilia had
flown a Fokker biplane, I beat her flying time by six days eighteen hours. So I
landed on the Antarctic too.
  I saw aunt Cecilia, apprehended her and searched her body throughout. Nothing
unusual was found. Then I searched her luggage. Nothing there either. I
searched her igloo. Nothing. I searched the whole of the Antarctic. Still no
sign of my lovely, juicy sugarbeet roots.

When I began to cry, aunt Cecilia rid herself of my bounds and began to speak.
"Why did you trace, apprehend and search me?" she said. "I don't know what is
going on." I told her about the sugarbeet, and she answered: "Oh. I saw my
brother David take them from your farm while you were not looking."
  "Can I trust you?" I asked her. "Of course you can trust me, because I have a
pipe", she said. And indeed she had one. So I flew back to Europe again, and
walked to uncle David's apartment. He was home, and immediately when I turned
to face him, he covered his desk with the whole of his body. I knocked him out
onto the floor and examined the desk.
  To my utter delight I found all my lovely sugarbeet roots neatly preserved in
little deep-freezed plastic bags. I took them all back and got them to my farm,
where I planted them again.
  Three days later I sent aunt Cecilia an apology postcard.
