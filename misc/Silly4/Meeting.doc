                A Meeting in the Park
                        (a play)


The scene is the Kaisaniemi park in Helsinki. A hot-dog stand is visible,
whose owner is busy kicking bacilli out of his ears. The hot-dogs are
chanting "15 Men on the Dead Man's Chest, etc". The trees are constantly and
seemingly endlessly dropping their leaves. Mairiam arrives on the scene with
Sven the Hen.

Mairiam: Ooh, isn't it such a lovely day? (glances at watch) I mean night.
Sven the Hen (amiably): #*+@
Hot-dog vendor: Greetings, my dear lady.
Harlequin Harry appears out of a bus, which suddenly explodes in a massive
nuclear blast.
Harlequin Harry: Heellee, Meereem eend Sveen thee Heen.
Mairiam: Ooh, it's Harlequin Harry, I've read SO much about you.
Sven the Hen (bored): +*@#
Harlequin Harry: Heev yee eendeed? Theet's streeng, beecees neetheeng hees
been wreetn eebeet mee.
Mairiam: Ooh, but that's just a phrase, isn't it?
Sven the Hen (dumbly): *#+@

The Sun sets, and the Moon rises. The luminance level of the park decreases
drastically.
Mairiam: Ooh, it's cold here.
A bunch of Neo-Nazis arrive. They seem to be kicking invisible noses and
shouting vulgarities in Hindi.
Harlequin Harry: Wee'd beetteer deeg ee heel heer, see wee ceen bee seef
freem thees Nee-Neezees.
Sven the Hen (excited): #+@*
Mairiam, Harlequin Harry and Sven the Hen dig a hole. As they do so, the
Kaisaniemi park changes to le Place Dauphine in Paris.
Neo-Nazi one: Punar vadatiti kanya apagacchati.
Neo-Nazi two: Nrpasya asvodattam.

Mairiam: Ooh, but that didn't help, did it? The park's changed.
Sven the Hen (frustrated): +@*#
Harlequin Harry urinates into a small cavity one of his hairs has created.
The urine disrupts the delicate structure of space-time and causes the Dark
Emperor to appear.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Mairiam: Ooh, if it isn't the Dark Emperor. I've read SO much about you.
Harlequin Harry: Deen't leek nee, beet eet's thee Deek Eempeereer.
Sven the Hen (gaily): #+@*

The Dark Emperor and Harlequin Harry are having tea together in the hole.
Ottoman Ibn bounces into the hole and smashes the teacups.
Harlequin Harry: Nee jeest leek eet wheet yee'v deen.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Sven the Hen (idiotically): +#*@
Ottoman Ibn: Oh, I'm sorry. (scrubs a finger. The teacups dance a wild dance,
and mysteriously turn intact again.)
Mairiam: Ooh, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but shouldn't we get out of this
hole?
Ottoman Ibn: Well, yes.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Ottoman Ibn lifts a finger, and the hole fills with dirt. The Place Dauphine
changes to Olympos Mons on Mars.

Mairiam begins to grow peas on the Martian surface. The peas grow happily
enough, save for a vivid cyan colour.
Mairiam: Ooh, aren't these peas just lovely? (Eats a pea) Mmm... aah!
Ottoman Ibn: Let me try some. (Eats another pea) Well, yes, they're good.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Sven the Hen (jollily): +#@*
Harlequin Harry: Wheet eer wee deeng een Meers? Sheeldn't wee geet beeck tee
Eerth?
Mairiam: Ooh, I would say so, yes.
Ottoman Ibn: I'll fix that.
Ottoman Ibn twirls his hair backwards, and the Olympos Mons changes to Hyde
Park in London.

Ottoman Ibn: Well that fixes that.
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Sven the Hen (lovingly): #*+@
Mairiam kicks the Dark Emperor in the knee. The Dark Emperor remains intact
but the act causes the fake Dark Emperor to appear.

Fake Dark Emperor: Hullo, wee laddies and lassies.
Mairiam: Ooh, but who is he? The Dark Emperor is by my side.
Ottoman Ibn: That is the fake Dark Emperor.
Fake Dark Emperor: What are ye a-doing in these parts, me hearties? (pours
honey out of his bagpipe)
Mairiam: Ooh, we're just visiting here.
Harlequin Harry: Yees, eendeed wee eer.
Sven the Hen (musingly): +#@*
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Fake Dark Emperor: Will ye shut up? (Points to the Dark Emperor) I be
a-conversating with these here English people.
Ottoman Ibn: I'm not English, I'm from Turkey.
Mairiam: Ooh, and I'm not English either, I'm French.
Harlequin Harry: Ee eem neet Eengleesh. Beet ee deen't knee mee
neeteeneeleetee.
Sven the Hen (nauseatingly): #+*@

Ottoman Ibn: Hey, you there! (Points to the Fake Dark Emperor) Is there a
way out of this mad place?
Fake Dark Emperor: Aye, indeed thar be one. Would ye like to use it?
Ottoman Ibn: Well, we'll have to vote on that.
Mairiam: Ooh, I want to get out of here.
Harlequin Harry: Mee tee.
Sven the Hen (oppressively): +#@*
Dark Emperor: I am the Dark Emperor. I shall conquer all.
Fake Dark Emperor: Fine then, me lad. We shall get out of this here place
and back to the good auld Highlands.
The Fake Dark Emperor waves a finger, and Mairiam, Sven the Hen, Harlequin
Harry, Ottoman Ibn, the Dark Emperor and the fake Dark Emperor all disappear
in a fluff of smoke. The hot-dog vendor and the Neo-Nazis come back.
Hot-dog vendor: Well that sure was mysterious. But now I shall go to bed.
Neo-Nazi one: Yatha vrksastatha phalam.
Neo-Nazi two: Na gardabo gayati siksito 'pi.

The End.
