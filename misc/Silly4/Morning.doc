The sky illuminated with the light of the newly-rosen sun. Along with it,
several other areas were illuminated, among them a house.
  Inside the house, the being awoke. Eyes were opened, and soon murmuring and
yawning could be heard. When the noises stopped, the blanket was thrown off the
bed, and two weary feet were put on a cold floor. The being quickly got
dressed, and left for the kitchen.

Food was prepared, and soon eaten. The being felt nourished. The food had been
good. The same feet, which had been put on a cold floor, soon found themselves
in some shoes. Their shoelaces were tied, and soon the shoes were used to step
outside the house.
  Before that, the being decided that it would be foolish to step outside
without opening the door, so it was opened. Soon the door was also closed. For
a moment, the being neglected the whereabouts of the workplace, but after some
brief seeking, the workplace was located.

The being's shoes were used some more, this time on some asphalt, and soon the
being entered the workplace, where work was done by some beings, among which
the being was included.
  But at this time, someone decided that it wasn't morning any more, so the
story was put to an end.
