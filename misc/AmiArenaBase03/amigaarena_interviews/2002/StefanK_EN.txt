 *Please introduce yourself to the readers!*
 
  My name is Stefan Kleinheinrich, and I am 29 years of age.
  
 *When did you start working with the Amiga?*
 
  I bought my A500 in 1991 and started programming shortly after that 
  (Amiga-Basic from MS - that couldn't amount to anything :)).
  
 *Which Amiga model do you own*
 
  An A2000/060, regrettably faulty and only lots of cajoling can persuade
  it to cooperate, and a 1.4 GHz Amithlon machine.
  
 *Which version of the operating system is running on your computer?*
 
  Amithlon comes with 3.9, on the A2000 still 3.5.
  
 *Which software are you developing?*
 
  At the moment only AmiDraw. Some time ago a couple of small tools for TGV-Haupt
  (MonitorSwitch) and a couple of things for domestic use.
  
 *Can you tell us what your software is about?*
 
  AmiDraw is a 2D vector graphics program which has been particularly optimized
  for a (later) modular structure.
  
 *What has created the idea in you to continue developing your software?*
 
  The actual idea came about in 1995 because back then there didn't exist anything 
  comparable. After several misconceptions, HD crashes etc., the first executable
  version was developed in pure C. In 1999 the Amiga was put into the corner
  "for good". In mid-2001 I wanted to port the whole thing to Linux (QT) but had to
  realize that I had to get the source code to C++ first, and then got "reinfected".
  
 *How long has the development taken so far?*
 
  Since last summer for the nearly complete rewrite.
  
 *Which software are you using?*
 
  StormC4, TP7, AmigaWriter etc.
  
 *For which system (AmigaOS, AmigaDE, MorphOS) are you developing?*
 
  Initially only 3.x, and then the port to PPC.
  
 *Which OS will you support in the future?*
 
  Depending on the efficiency AOS4 or MorphOS or maybe even both.
  
 *What can we expect of future versions?*
 
  Fills using 24bit picture objects and combined objects will probably be there
  end of January. Modular structure and a better frontend (locale, font sensitive)
  will come later.
  
 *Don't you lose the fun and the interest in programming if you see the small amount
  of feedback you get from the small Amiga market?*
  
  Programming keeps the spirit young, that has to suffice.
  
 *Do you receive enough feedback for your software?*
  
  Up to now few but detailed bug reports.
  
 *When did you last use your Amiga?*
 
  The real one? Tried yesterday, no success. Amithlon nearly every day.
  
 *Which software did you last buy for your Amiga?*
 
  Amithlon, Update to StormC4, Turboprint - all in Cologne.
  
 *Which software do you still use?*
 
  see above.
  
 *Which hard/software are you planning to buy?*
 
  Pegasos.
  
 *Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?*
 
  I was amazed to still find that much of the community, and if now, after 8 or 9
  years, there will finally be new machines, these will still be around in 10 years.
  
 *Your final words for the readers?*
 
  Depending on the publishing date of this interview it may be that there will
  still be version 0.04 in Aminet which regrettably causes a few enforcer hits.
  I will upload the cleaned-up version 0.05 on 5th or 6th of January.
  So, don't give up on the home stretch - the future begins in spring.
