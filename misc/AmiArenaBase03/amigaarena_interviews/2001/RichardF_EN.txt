Amiga Arena Interview
---------------------

With Richard Fhager - BabeAnoid
(18.07.2001)



*Please Introduce yourself for the Readers!

My name is Richard Fhager, my handle since `89 is DawnBringer.
I'm live on an island called Donsö, outside Gothenburg, Sweden.
I turned 30 this June.

*Since did you start to work with the Amiga?

Fall 1990.

*What Amiga Modell do you own?

A1200,Blizzard060 ,16MB Ram,2.1GB HD 

*What Version of the OS is running on your Computer?

3.0, i busted my 3.1 roms by misstake.

*Which Software Develope you?

BabeAnoid - Breakout clone
DawnVideoPoker - Poker machine simulation
SpaceBall2000 - Pong/Arkanoid/Speedball cross
Fnurr2000 - Avoid homing enemies,  a 26 pixel game!
Simon2001 - Remake of the classic "repeat the sequences" game.
SeaHaven2001 - Patience game, inspired by the SGI version.
D-Flip - Tile-flipping puzzler

*Can you tell us what BabeAnoid is about?

It`s a BreakOut like game, but with a great amount of effects
and features, most of which can take place at the same time or in any
combination -- That`s what makes it so avanced.

*What created the idea in you to continue developing the game?

BabeAnoid started as many other of my projects, by testing
some routines, in this case a ball-angle and a zone-detection
routine -- and what better way is there to do that but
a simple BreakOut game?

It all took place at a Virtual Reality education I attended in `95.
I brought my Amiga1200 to class, because the Silicon Graphics we used
didn`t have any good raytracers or paint-programs.
I was sitting around with some cool game-coders and we were just
brainstorming about ideas...and in 4 days i wrote the backbone of
BabeAnoid...

*How long took the development up to now?

6 years! But I didn`t work on it every month, and I wrote many other 
games and programs during those years.

*What software are you using?

AMOS 2.0, Brilliance, ADPro, ProTracker and AudioMaster

*For what system are you developing?
Amiga Classic.

*What can we expect from future versions?

I`m going to fix the final version of BabeAnoid, I also
have an update of DawnVideoPoker in the pipe.

*Don't you lose the fun and interest in developing when
you see the small amount of feedback and money you get
from the small Amiga market?

It`s true that the Amiga userbase has declined and that feedback can be
slow, but I wouldn`t do it if I didn`t love programming and the Amiga.
Money is no problem - I never got a penny! ;)

*Get you enough Feedback for you Software?

No! You can never get too much. with BabeAnoid I`ve got near 30
mails - all VERY positive , but still, it isn`t much!
(my main mail account went down shortly after the release of the demo, so
I guess there is a few mails wating there too).
With some games I hardly got any feedback, I guess many pepole think
that the next guy will do it! 

*When did you use your Amiga for the last time?
Doing this interview!

* What software have you bought for your Amiga last time?
I think it was the game Colonization.

* What software do you use till today?

YAM,  Dopus4.12, MCP and about a million patches etc. found on
Aminet. I used to do some raytracing with Imagine but not so much
anymore.

* What soft/-hardware are you planning to buy?

I might buy a new A1200, and a new harddisk. Then when i have 3.1
roms i might upgrade my OS.

* Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?
Well, it looks better now than during the last 5 years .
It could make a comeback, but not in the way as we knew Amiga before.
I`m a strictly "classic"Amiga user so I don`t think there is much in it for
me. But if AmigaOS can steal any marketshares from Windows or Linux
etc. that would be great.
An Amiga in any shape is better than no Amiga at all!
