Amiga Arena Interview
---------------------

with Rafal Kaczmarczyk, developer from Xbaze!


*Please Introduce yourself for the Readers!

My name is Rafal Kaczmarczyk. I'm 22 years old, and I'm living and working in
Wroclaw. My hobbies: Amiga, music (rock and harder music) and film. Right
now I'm working in software service.

*Since did you start to work with the Amiga?

I've got Amiga since 1991 year. It was "naked" (that means unexpanded)
A500.

*What Amiga Modell do you own?

Since 1994 I use A1200.

*What Version of the OS is running on your Computer?

Right now this is AmigaOS 3.0.

*Which Software Develope you?

Only XBaze to this time.

*Can you tell us what your software is about?

XBaze is a simple databases editor.

*How long took the development up to now?

I develop XBaze since 1995.

*What software are you using?

AmiTekst Pro, XBaze:), YAM. DOpus 4 and many others.

*For what system are you developing?

As I said before, actually I develop only XBaze for AmigaOS.

*Would you support the "Amiga One"?

That depends what new possibilities AmigaOS 4.0 will offers.

*What can we expect from future versions?

Less bugs:) And implementation of more features suggested by users.

*Don't you lose the fun and interest in developing when
you see the small amount of feedback and money you get
from the small Amiga market?

Development of XBaze is my hobby, so this is really not important to me
that now amount of Amiga users is small. XBaze is cardware, so I don't risk
that I don't earn enough amount of money on that programme.

*Get you enough Feedback for you Software?

I've got enough feedback to further development of XBaze, but if more users will
be interested with this programme, frequency of new versions will be
higher:)))

*When did you use your Amiga for the last time?

I use my Amiga during writing answer to this question:)

* What software have you bought for your Amiga last time?

Amilopedia, but this was long time ago:(.

* What software do you use till today?

Text editors, compilers.

* What soft/-hardware are you planning to buy?

Amithlon, and next will be MorphOS working on Pegasos from BPlan.

* Do you believe in a comeback of Amiga?

Amiga is probably sentence to being nicheable system, but I don't see
anything wrong in that.

Thank you for your Answer!
