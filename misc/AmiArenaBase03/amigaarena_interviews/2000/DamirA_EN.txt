Amiga Arena Interview

*Please introduce yourself to the readers!

I am Damir Arh from Slovenia.
I study computer and information sience.
In my spare time I develop some software for the Amiga
and recently also for Java/Windows.

*When did you start to work with the Amiga?

I don't remember exactly anymore.
I got my first Amiga 500 in the early 1990's.

*Which Amiga modell have you got?

A1200 with 68030/50.

*Which Amiga OS version are you using?

OS 3.5

*Which software do you develop?

I publicly released BallMaster,
StopMenu (continued work from Tomasz Wojcik) and TV-Logo.

*Will you continue developing your software?

As long as I still receive registrations.
At the moment this means further development
for StopMenu and TV-Logo, but I've abandoned BallMaster.

*Do you get enough feedback and registrations for you software?

Not as much as I'd like.
But I guess I couldn't expect more in the current Amiga situation.

*Will you port your software to the AmigaOne?

My current programs certainly not.
Future programs yes, as long as I see it as a viable platform.

*Will you buy the new Amiga?

As a hardware device probably not,
as an operating environment yes if it brings what it promises.

*When was the last time you used your Amiga?

Just yesterday when I did some work on the TV-Logo and I'll turn it on
later today to continue that work.

*Which was your last software/hardware product you bought?

It must have been a game from Clickboom or an Aminet CD from Schatztruhe.

*Which applications/games do you use on your Amiga?

I mainly use things I need for development: text editors, compilers etc.
I don't use it for playing games anymore.

*Which software/hardware will you buy in the future?

For my current Amiga probably none.

*Do you belive in the Amiga comeback?

I'd like to see a comeback but after all that waiting I don't know
what to believe anymore.
We'll see what will happen.
