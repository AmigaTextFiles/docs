A friend of mine's just belatedly discovered you can use Amigas for more
than just games.He wants to run e-mail, but he's only got a bogstandard 2
meg 1200. Is this possible? Are there low memory alternatives to Miami and
Yam? The other thing that puzzles me is how he could sign up to Freeserve
without being able to run a browser. Can you do that bit from a PC?
Cheers.

Tony, who's only got 4 meg fast and wants more dammit.

>From what I know, Miami is the smallest but it does take up quite a bit if
memory.  If it does work on 2meg it will not be stable especially when
coupled with an email program like the great yam we all use! - I suggest he
tries a Miami demo and see what happens.  I'm pretty certain he would need
more than 2 meg though, maybe you could find him an expansion card cheaply
on the web.

About signing up for Freeserve you could do that for him online @ the FS
website and then give him his user ID and password to get online or he could
use another computer somewhere.

Wayne

just Miami.

The Amiga dealer I bought the card from added a sheet saying:
"just copy the 'networks' drawer to you devs: directory and you can
use Miami to set everything up."

yes.

I told the dealer I bought the cable from that I want to use it for
a network of two computers without a hub and he said *this* cable
should be perfectly ok for me.

I guess no :(

Hi Anybody,

Does anyone use NTL for their internet access. It is meant
to be =A310 pr month for internet access 24/7. I dont want to
know if you use it on your PC. I know you have to sign up
with your PC but has anyone tried to take the number, pass
word, login etc and then use it with Miami on the Amiga?

Any help or comments on this would be appreciated.

Also does anyone have any documents on producing WAP
pages?

In theory, once you have your login name and password you should be able
to just use it on your Amiga in Miami. NTL installs a load of crap on
the PC from it's CD but you just uninstall that anywayz and use the
normal Dial Up Networking. So it should work fine on the miggy too :)

Chris I've done just that.  It isn't £10 a month at all its completely FREE
you just pay your line rental to NTL as normal and sign up for the Ntlworld
FREE service.

You are right about the PC bit you HAVE to sign up using one as it uses java
but don't use the disk they send you !! - you can cock up your PC big time
with that, you do however need the pin number on the CD which is unique to
each customer.
I'll give you a better way to do it once you have the pin if you want ?.

I use it on Miami and have no probs at all.  Don't tell NTL you are using a
miggy though just say its for a PC, they don't need to know :)

Well, if you are using a BT line you DO have to spend £10 a month on
normal voice calls via NTL's system but, in effect, the internet is
still FREE. Incidentally, NTL's call charges are a lot better value than
BT.

I don't know what it is up to but NTL's system does try to contact it's
client on your machine from time to time! I'm just using NTL's via a
normal dialup login/pass (instead of all their overbloated software on
the CD) and I've noticed my firewall blocks an access from NTL every so
often. Strange huh!

I've been using NTL for about 5 months but I didn't know that you 
could get rid of that crappy, annoying, memory-hogging software they 
use - how do you disable it?

Would I be right in saying that once you have disabled it you 
just "Add an internet connection" to your computer with the NTL 
number, username and password?

Also, you say you use a firewall, what software do you use for this?

lastly, do you think that once you have signed up you can access the 
internet via the freephone NTL number from a different phone line 
(i.e. not the NTL cable line)?  It would be fantastic if you could as 
my mobile has free 0800 calls - I could use the internet anywhere for 
free!

Please tell me that I can!  (But be honest if I can't :) )

All the best...

Conor

Yes thats it, you don't even need to install the CD Software in the 1st
place though, I found out a while back all you need is the PIN number from
the CD & the website http://autoreg.autoregister.net/cgi/candy - the site
does need a PC to run it though a it uses full JAVA. The number is 0800
5190100.

I just put a Firewall up on our PC yesterday, It is nice & simple and FREE -
its called Zonealarm or Alarmzone and is from Zone Labs ?  (.com ?) - I got it
from a PC Format DVD.  You can test the security of your computers safely by
going to http://grc.com and looking for the "shields up" button.

Sorry but that bit you can't do ! - apparently the phone numbers only exist
on the NTL network, tbey are invisible to outsiders, crafty eh !

On 02-Oct-00, you wrote:

Ahhh, thanks for informing me of this. I hadnt seen it
advertised or anything i was just talking to the very
helpful bloke, Alan Gryniewicz, he must be on a BT line
as he says as he has to make =A310 in calls through NTL.

I am an NTL customer so am i right in saying once i have
the CD my internet calls will be free 24/7 and i dont
have to make a certain amount of calls or anything? Is
it an 0800 number then?

Lastly does it have first or even second time connection?
does it log u off after a certain time or could u in
theory have a 24/7 connection. If you left it on for
24/7 are you likely to be not allowed to use it anymore.
How fast and reliable is it? Is it worth bothering with
or is to so slow you cant get anything done?

Do you get a pop3 email addreSS? and in what format?

The website says it takes about three months to get the
CD, uggg, is that realistic??? Looks like i wont have
free internet until early December :(((

Maybe something that old NTL customers wont be aware
of... Cable and Wireless merged into NTL and now it is
all NTL, C&W used to have a 50p all saturday deal for
long distance numbers and for me an ex-c&w customer and
now an NTL customer the 50p all day long distance call
still exists so theres no reason why all NTL customers
cant call all day for 50p. Dont blame me if it doesnt
stop at 50p though ;)

Any other catches or things to be aware of?

TIA, Thanks!

Hello, ppl

Does anyone know a CLI tool to convert pictures (for example from 256 colors
to 16 or rescale, etc.) No need for fancy gui (better without gui) ?
Free/postcard/share/mailware would be best :)


 Kind regards, Vytas

Well I just used the program's own uninstall option and, true to most PC
applications, it doesn't uninstall completely... It leaves the handy
dial up networking connection :)

Of course, make a note of the phone number, username and password just
in case yours decides to delete it anywayz!

> Also, you say you use a firewall, what software do you use for this?

I use a program called ZoneAlarm from Zonelabs
(http://www.zonelabs.com). It is free and unrestricted for personal use,
and you only need to register and pay up if you are using the program
commercially. Although, even then, the prices are very reasonable :))

Nope.... NTL's 0800 number seems to ONLY exist on the NTL network!! Try
dialling it from BT and it`ll say the number isn`t recognised! Clever
huh!

gfxcon, and it's an independent package, though it may have been
included in your thumbnail thing.

Thats right, there are some restrictions though.  You get disconnected
automatically every 2 hours, you can hang up and redial straight away though
if you like.  The other thing is after you have been doing nothing on the
'net for 5 minutes it also disconnects. Its on an 0800 number which I
havenever ever had the engaged tone from.

See above
I have found the service fine.  I was really expecting it to be absolutely
crap, slow as anything and permanantly engaged so I was quite surprised
really.

Yes you do and webspace, you can have a maximum of 5 pop3 email addresses

I'm afraid so !! - I signed up for it on the 1st day you could way back in
April and we only got the disk in August !!!! - a mate of mine though has
just had cable installed and he has been told about 2 weeks so the wait
might not be too bad now. The number for registering is 0800 952 4343.

Good luck :)

Wayne

just Miami.

The Amiga dealer I bought the card from added a sheet saying:
"just copy the 'networks' drawer to you devs: directory and you can
use Miami to set everything up."

yes.

I told the dealer I bought the cable from that I want to use it for
a network of two computers without a hub and he said *this* cable
should be perfectly ok for me.

I guess no :(

There's no point asking all the list members,
the list manager may not even be here..

Just go to    http://www.egroups.com/

Hi everyone,

Just wondered if there is any life out there?, I thought my daily 
digest had cocked up ;)

Just a thought on the amount of ADF disk images on the web. Have all 
these software companies given permission for these to be freely 
distributed?  If some companies have, then why are cracked copies 
being distributed instead of legal ones?

Just a thought on a lonely afternoon...

Yo, life.  I just haven't had anything of substance to add.

I have noticed that the majority of the list seen to be on the East side of
the Atlantic.  While there area lot of us on the west side that have Amigas,
we are bound to spread a little thinner.

I have often considered the question of networks as regards the Amiga, and
have been following that thread with some interest.  However, the difficulty
and expense of getting the LAN card for the Amiga has been a stumbling block
to attempting it myself.  I do have a number of the awful PC things as
well.  Having them all hooked up would be nice.

More to my interest would be any discussion of Desk Top Publishing, and
graphics, of the still kind.  I get funny looks from people when they learn
my Amiga is mainly used for DTP, not for video.

Well, mosy ex amiga companies don't have the un-protected versions of
their games anymore, so the only way they can release the games free
on the net is to use hacked versions.

As for other games that don't have permission, they're basically the
same as all the other old console roms that are available on the net,
so it's up to you whether you agree with that or not. Most people
think that it's the only way to keep a lot of old games alive, as
otherwise they'd just disappear (which is fair enough if you ask me
:). 

See ya :)

Do you want something to write about?
What about http://www.amiga.com/products/one/ or
http://www.amiga.com/products/one/pr.shtml ?
They seem to be the biggest discussion at the aos35 list... (way to big...
(sigh... (but it's still great news! :·)))

Hi, Garry,

You could go to egroups and look up SoftLogik to get on the SoftLogik
mailing list(s). There are, of course, a couple of DTPers there. ;)

Let's give them something to talk about indeed.  I'm having hot flashes.  A
new Amiga and I get to keep the OLD Amiga.  I need to sit down a while.
suddenly having the Old Girlfriend taken down and spiffied up with some new
chips looks like a good idea.

I have the lead article for the next Random Remarks newsletter.

I am like so hopping HAPPY about computers for the first time in a good long
time.  Me andthe Old Girl (AKA Baby Monster AKA That Thing, etc.) have hung
together through thick and thin for 5 years.  I bought the 4000 on pure
faith.  Commodore was dead as a doornail long before I got it.  But I wanted
the best Amiga I could get my hands on.  I have hung in, and now it's starting
to pay off.

Work around? I'm not having any trouble using my squirrel on my BlizzardPPC
166/040 system.

My 56k modem runs at 115200 fine.

What sort of problems are you having?

I can't get my Squirrel serial port to work when the PPC card is attached

It works ok when the PPC is removed and if it is used with a 030 or 040 card

The Squirrel scsi works ok all the time

The point of the link however was that the page is being served by the

What this says to me is the voters were mostly Amiga users or ex Amiga
users, and it does reflect the best of the Classic Amiga software.  I
wonder, though, if a wider audience would have made the same choices.  I'm
amused that CyagnusED and GoldED finished in a dead heat, and that YAM was
the only mailer mentioned.

It (no point in personifying the thing) is called a "troll" in netspeak.
Someone that joins lists or newsgroups for the simple reason to do waht it
did, and rile up the list and disrupt the procedings.  I have no doubt the
troll will be delt with.

In any case.  Anyone know a good place to send a A4000 motherboard for a
general overhaul?  Someplace I can get it back, done right within a week or
so instead of a month, and sending it back twice.

It's not much trouble,  i'm in Australia !!!
We send our's there.......

But i'm sure there are other places in the US that 
would be closer to home....  

Maybe someone here can recommend some places
in the US,  maybe you have specified your state ?..

Have you tried PSI Industries?  Their number is 215-443-8330.  I think
they're in the PA area.  I've never tried them, but NewTek recommends them.

Also, I got this mail in Sep. '99:

If you need your Amiga Repaired see Rich Hermann

Well, if you ask me, he's more newbe. A couple of days ago he asked to
be unsubscribed from this list (probably subscribed by accident).
There was a reply, he probably missed it or sommin.

Anyway, after he got annoyed I sent him a simple message saying

No need to swear, simply send an email to=20
just-amiga-unsubscribe@egroups.com if you want out.


Anyway he seems to be gone now.

See ya :)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Okay, some people might have seen me ask this on afb, but I've had no 
answer yet, so I''l try here instead. I just got Turboprint 7.15 in 
anticipation of an Epson Stylus Colour 760, but I have a feeling that 
things might get a bit slow. Does anyone know if there are any 
upgrades or plugins for Turboprint that would let it use my PPC? Or 
is this just wishful thinking? I'm sure I've heard of such a thing 
somewhere...

Sooner,

        Sandy, thinking the parallel port will be too slow too
