Subject: [AmILC] Own pictures in Gadtools buttons and boxes

Is there any easier way to add my own GFX into windows which I have created
in GadTools2, and converted over to an AMOS listing?

I want to add a few nice GFX buttons of my own but unsure how to go about
it easily.

Thanks in advance

Subject: [AmILC] Amiga browsers and AREXX

Hi there. I have a question I would like to put to everyone out there. Any
help much appreciated.

I have added a feature to the program which will paste to one of your
favourite Amiga web browsers via an AREXX port, and im in dire need of some
assistance. If you can help in any of these questions, please post the
answers to the list.

I have the following browsers supported:

 AWEB - Is the V2 the same AREXX as V3. Could someone send me the docs from
        the fully registered version please.

Ibrowse - I would also like full documentation for this browser, especially
          the later released versions.

Voyager and Voyager NG

Any info much appreciated, as are other comments/suggestions etc.

All the best

Hmmm. My demo of Ibrowse doesnt have any kind of documentation with it. What I
wouldnt mind seeing is the documentation, especially for the AREXX part, of
the registered versions of all these browsers so I can get the latest info on
what to include. Anyone with these docs, I would be gratefull if you sent them
personally to mushypd@redrose.net

I want to make the only available screenmode for the program just on the WB
screen. Someone suggested that I make it have the option to open on a
public screen, but i want your opinions.

Please remember that the program iconifies to just an icon when in use (and
you select iconify) and new messages can be made to pop up alert boxes etc.

You could use the SA_LikeWorkbench tag and only have a single
"Workbench/PublicScreen" option in your program. Like a menu item
or a tooltype or something. (Id prefer menu item myself)

Alternatively, you could set the ASLSM_PropertyFlags, ASLSM_PropertyMask
on your asl screenmodereq to allow only screenmodes which support workbench.

In the welcome message of joining this mailing list, I put a bit in where I
said I wanted to know if you had any kind of ideas which will make this
program better than the PC version.

I am interested in hearing any ideas that you have, no metter how bizarre or
insane they may sound, that you think would be a good thing to put in an
online application such as this. One chap I was talking to on IRC said I
should have a net-game of tank in the ACTIONS menu, so you can play a game
with your mate whilst a file is sending.

Any suggestions, please feel free to post them to the list.

Yes, I want to add my own images. At the moment, I am using boring-looking
text buttons, which could be spiced up in the future towards a release time
with nice looking pictures on them.

Please briefly explain how it can be done. I looked at some BOOPSI docs. Is
this how it is to be done?

How do you mean by menu item, within the actual program itself when it's
uniconified?

Rather than a menu, I would rather put it in the preferences section and
have a gadget to have either WB or Publicscreen selected.

Tooltypes methos of doing it is a good way. Ill see about adding it.

I can now.  Try something like:

  LoadShape 42,"data/ocr.iff"
  GTShape 0,6,152,6,0,42,42

..probably best if you change the filenames and shape sizes ;-)

With this thing being a pager an' all, a nice feature would be a small
box on the operations window with a photo of the person paging you. It
adds to the sense of identity.. know what I mean? :)

Thought it might be a good idea, that's all :)

Public screens are ok...  In Blitz, it's fairly easy to use both.  I think
you'll use, ooh, about 4 or 5 extra lines of code.
 
> Please remember that the program iconifies to just an icon when in use (and

With this sort of proggie, I'd prefer if it started iconified, and popped up
boxes when required, on whichever screen I'd told it to use.  Here's a quick
idea for you - open the stuff on the current public screen, that'd work for
whatever you use, but if you do that, make sure you've got a thing to click
on that sends it back to it's own screen.

...also, with the notify option, something like amirc's notify would be
good, optional window, sound player so you know somethings happened.

The direct chat is less important if we have talk/chat/voicemail daemons
online. 

..actually, getting it working is more important.

Agima matey, nice to see your typing. hehe

One of the original features I stated in my ol' jotting book (and I think
it was on one of the files) was to have some kind of picture ID like on
VDOPhone. The big question, is should I just keep the pics stored on my WWW
for use on the pager, or send them about a bit when you request a chat.

If I send them out to each time you get messaged, the bandwidth is going to
be killer, especially for someone who is heavily lagged.

Let me know your comments

Hmmm.... see what you mean 'bout the bandwidth. A good idea about the website
storage though. You could also make it an option to view user photo, some of
us are just far too ugly for an Amiga screen ;)

...how about the remote client checking for a file on the hard drive,
somethinng like mush.pic, and if its not there (assuming pic option turned
on) requesting it from the server...

...Also the obvious 'pic not available' pic.  The client should also support
a request for the users picture if possible.

There are just so many things a system like this can do.

This could be done by simply adding proprietary CTCP commands such as
CTCP PICTURE URLtoPicture
CTCP Game hostmachine sockettoconnect

etc. Worth looking at would be how the DCC protocol works

As to paging, you could plug this into a simple startup. I for one would
more likely use a multiple of disparate programs to a single large one.

Jolly good idea. That way, you only need have to grab an image once and
never need it again.

The reason I am concerned with bandwidth, especially with graphics, is the
page space I am going to be renting is currently 10 Mb for 30 dollars, with
CGI and 200Mb/Month bandwidth maximum. The next peg up (if I exceed 200Mb)
gets classed as a business page (unlike the small busuness i'll be paying
for now) and that immediately shoots the cost up to 60 dollars a month,
which I just cannot afford to do, unless I charge yearly subscriptions to
the program, which I am not prepared to do at all, and will not do.

Unlike John Major and Tony blair, I mean what I say!!

Hmmm... this seems like an idea at first, but it eliminates the beauty of
mush's system.  I for one, would load amirc (grapevine, whatever) when
required or when I feel like irc, but wouldn't have it running all the time,
taking up all that screen and bandwidth space.

Fair enuf.  The suite of proggies is a good idea, keeps the loading time

My program wouldnt use up much more bandwidth than everything put together,
running at once. The system would compile at maybe 10-15K more executable
size to have a DCC client running?

Think about it. Run a couple of hundred K to start AmIRC, have a couple of
windows storing buffer, have MUI kicking in doing its stuff, saves you a
hell of a lot of memory.

One function to overcome this is for me to code some kind of definable chat
room, in which users can be invited to join. Im still trying to think of
different methods, so its good to hear this kind of critisism.

My server wont handle any conferenceing. Like a DCC, the chat will be
entirely private and linked between the 2 copies of AmILC running, so you
get the best possible speed when it comes to transmiting.

Yes, I agree. It keeps the loading time down, but also, if they are all in
one suite, just think of the huge amount of memory you are saving!!

Email the author of amirc perhaps ?  He'll probably know where the docs are.

Yah, but having said program running would take up memory, and would have to
run all the time... If for example, you've seen how Amislate etc. works, I'ld
like something like that, but based around a central registry.

Of course, everybody has different ideas to everybody else :)

However, unlike how PCs work, I'm more in favour of the modular approach
The Amiga is the very embodiment of this. When I send this message it'll be
placed in a single store. When I connect a very small application would send it

I'ld be mucho pissed off to start up the whole mailer just to send a mail. As I
would be annoyed to start up a whole paging program just to flag that I'm online.

But think of what you lose in terms of memory if you just want to appear to
be online to somebody?

If somebody wants to talk to you via AmiLC it would be great, but if this
happens only once every ten days, than running AmiLC every time I logged on
as opposed to a small tracking application, would appear to be a horrendous
waste of memory on the bounds of it. Also a tracking application would allow
easy extension and plugins to be written.

I think mush has it sorted on his server.  The leave a message bit is way
easy, normal email, and the idea for pics would be primarily for people on
line.  It's a really cute idea for a system, one that should have been
written ages ago.

I agree as a matter of fact most software makers in the U.S. are staying away
from
the Gif format because of Compuserves legal stand point on the issue it seems
that
they are now after all these years enforcing their copyright claims.
It is best to stay away from the Gif format.
PNG is a good choice and tho it is gaining acceptance Jpg maybe the better
way to
go around as if this is an Amiga only proggy then I would say stay with the
ILBM
but if you are going to interface with PeeCee's then I would say JPG and
perhaps
PNG maybe it would be better to let the user determine their preference using

datatypes that has been the strong hole of Amiga Technology is that it lets
the user
decide and customize it's interface to maximize its strengths/weeknesses.

Messages will be stored in a data file on the WWW server, so when you first

I had a snoop around and found a rather large RFC file collection. It was
over 85 megs in docs altogether, so should be a good supply of them should
I ever need them.

Subject: [AmILC] Project Progress

Just a brief report on whats going on with the project so far. I have
decided to split the system up from just one large file, into several
modules. These will be (at the moment) :

    Notifier/People online/Receive messages
    Send Message
    Chat
    Prefs

All Amiga browsers will be supported via AREXX commands. Current browsers
enlisted are :

    Ibrowse
    AWEB
    Voyager

For the moment, images of other users will be using GIF format until I work
out how to incorporate PNG into blitz. Image sizes are limited to 80x100
and no more than 256 colours. Images will be cached on the users HD to save
having to keep transferring them via the net each time.

The program (for now) will only open on a WB screen and use a minimum of 8
colours on the screen. A screenmode of its own will be added later on.

Erm, thats all I can think of from the top of my head. Please post anything
you would like to see added.

Subject: [AmILC] UUxT files

Anyone object to me sending UUxT mails to the list when it comes to small
executables and GFX examples? The files will be no more than 50K in size
(if anywhere near that)

If no-one posts to the list about it, then I will presume it is ok.

To unsubscribe, simply put UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject header. You'll also
see all the other commands etc. if you read the welcome file you received
when you joined. To refresh you, sending a HELP in the topic will send you
the help file.

I do want other Amiga user to help me in this project by sending me ideas
and support the production. When I finish it, I hope it will be a major
Amiga project!!

I'd never even heard of PNG till I installed err, ppaint on that cover CD.
..never really seen it, never used it.  What does it stand for ?

I know mush's development system supports iff files, and we all got amiga's.
If there is time, certainly.

Cool.  I also have 2 CD32's, but one doesn't work, and neither have video
cards.

The following UUxT code can be decoded to a GIF file, of which I grabbed
from the project so far. I have started working on small modules for the
system, which also gives the opportunity for other writers to add their own
modules to the system.

If you have any kind of suggestion as to the actual way the setup is layed
out, please email me on the list. Its in eary stages yet, so everything can
be altered and changed.

I registered Ibrowse, and got some docs (not sure if there ARE what you seem
to be looking for) but they are not PD, and therefore illegal to send.

NO NO NO! Most people I talk to (myself included :) HATE apps on the wb
screen, and NOBODY uses 640x200 (or 256) anymore! YUK. Use the display
database!

I don't want to recieve any files from a list. My time is limited and you
could just as easily make them available from a webpage for only the people
who WANT them.

They pretty much should be. Ill obviously provide the option of having any
large files put up on a WWW page for download, probbably the official AmILC
homepage.

Fair enough. Would you be objectibve towards files of say, less than 15K?

This is easier for me, or anyone else that way.We can send small files to
and fro, and anything over 15K can be downloaded from the WWW.

Hmm. Will keep it in mind. For now, I am using an own 8 colour screen in
640x400 mode. This way, I can set everything up to work on such a screen.

I think it should be on its own screen as default, that way it can be
tucked out of sight quite easily, and have it notify you when anything
happens.

Nothing worse than trying to open an 'Execute Command' window to find that
all the stuff in the WB display takes up the space and wont let you get to
the WB background...

I only need the parts which tell me of the AREXX commands so that I can
incorporate the latest registered commands into the program.

I think its only illegal to distribute if you intend to spread it to lots
of people, and its usualy the program itself thats copyright.

Yep, PNG is a known datatype, has been for a while, but not may people
support it on their webpages, mainly cos the PC browsers dontt recognize
it, so its kind of a good thing for us Amiga users eh? hehe

I'll think about incorporating it, but GIF or IFF is more easily used.

Subject: [AmILC] Restrictions

What kind of restrictions should I place in the program when it comes to
releasing a demo?

I dont want to cut too much out of it, rensering it useless, and I dont
want to leave too much in it causing people to not register. Here are a few
of the things which I would like to restrict in it. Please mail me at the
list if you have any comments/suggestions:


 * No pictures of other users being sent via the net.
 * Limited to sending 5 messages within any 24 hour period.
 * Limit of 10 people allowed in the notify database
 * Auto shutdown of program after 30 minutes
 * Annoying requesters (!)
 * Server will only allow X number of connections a day

Some of the things I have thought of for the registered version to combat
piracy are to make the system cancel any keyfile access to both machines,
if a keyfile is found to be in use by another host, by checking variables
etc. from the system to make sure the user didnt disconnect and connect
back without the server knowing.

Ideas and comments appreciated.
