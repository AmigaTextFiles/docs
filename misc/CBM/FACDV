First Annual Commodore Deathbed Vigil Party T-Shirts Available


    We're writing to you from the site of the Commodore Deathbed Vigil
party, April 30, 1994.  People are driving in from all over the east
coast, some are flying in, AmigaWorld is sending a reporter, Dave
Haynie, Gail Wellington, Intuition Guru Peter Cherna, Carolyn Scheppner,
Jeff Porter, Andy Finkel, Bryce Nesbitt and dozens more are all here.
The flag at the Commodore plant is flying at half-mast.

    We ask you to dim your monitors to half-brightness in respect for
the passing of Commodore.  Today is a day of world-wide
mourning for the Amiga, and a day for prayers for a quick sale
of the Amiga technology to one of the several interested bidders.
As hard as this is for all of us, we realize that only by cycling
through bankruptcy could the technology be sold.



    In the spirit of the great Amiga wake parties of the past we've just
designed a Deathbed Vigil T-Shirt. It plays on the NewTek spin-off
"Play" button, and Scala's "Fast Forward" shirt.  Ours has an eject
button with the words "Commodore Deathbed Vigil April 30, 1994."  The
back will be signed by members of the Commodore development team, most
of the original Amiga design team, Commodore employees as of the last
week and people of the party.

    The shirt is $15 for partygoers, and $19 for anyone else. $4 shipping
in the USA and Canada, $8 international.  We're using Obvious
Implementation's order processing facilities (OIC is also offering a
discount on the brand new DICE compiler 3.0, just released last week).

    Call 1-800-761-2042 to order by phone.  Send email to "info@oic.COM"
for an electronic mail order form.  Or send check or money order to:

        Obvious Implementations Corporation
        PO Box 4487
        Cary, NC 27519-4487

                And the remaining staff of Commodore-Amiga
    Writing to you from the Commodore Deathbed Vigil, April 30 1994.
