     Although Commodore International has filed for voluntary liquidation 
     and production of new Amiga's has essentially stopped, that does not 
     mean the entire installed base will disappear overnight.
     
     GVP will continue to support the Amiga market, it's products, and even 
     one or two new releases.  It is natural to expect a decline in the 
     third-party Amiga market, but it would be foolish to ignore the 
     potential market that exists in the installed base.
     
     It's been a rough road, and it will get rougher, but it's not time to 
     jump ship just yet...
