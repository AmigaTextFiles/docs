The following is a paraphrased fax sent to amiga dealers yesterday(sat.) from
Creative Equipment International. I have no idea what this means for the long
run...
Begin;
  Dear CEI Dealer:
As we have been expecting, Commadore International filed for liquidation in
order to be proteced from its creditors Friday April 29, 1994, at 4:10 P.M.
Commadore's official statement follows: 
   "Commodore International Limited announded today that its Board of
Directors hasa authorized the transfer of assets to trustees for the benefit
of its creditor and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore Electronics
Limited, into voluntary liquidation. This is the intial phase of an orderly
liquidation of bothe companies, which are incorporated in the Bahmas, by the
Bahamas Supreme Court."
   This action does not affect the wholly-owned subsidiaries which include
Commodor Buisiness Machines (USA), Commodore Buisiness machines LTD (Canada),
Commodore/Amiga (UK), Commodore Germany, etc. Operations will continue
normally. 
   CEI has been working closely with Commodore's management and major
investors to find a resolution to the current financial crisis. Commodore's
actions now clear the way for PROGRESS to be made.
   In the next few weeks CEI will be making a number of important
announcements.
   CEI currently has suffcient Amiga inventory to meet expected demand until
manufacturing can be resumed. All our policies remain in tact, fullservice and
support will continue. If you have any questions or concerns please contact
your CEI representative.
   Please assure your customers that this event should be seen in the positive
light. What if...better support, better products, better marketing, better
prices, better margins all arose from the ashes. Stay tuned...
   Sincerely,
    Alex Amor
     President
END:
Spelling mistakes are mine BTW. I don't know if this gives reason for hope or
if its just a way to run a fire sale. Either way I'm expecting a pc in my
future. Since this post is not strictly imagine related I suggest those
heartbroken amiga users like me who want to share insights keep it personal
email or make the subject specific so pc Imagine users may skip over our sob
stories. 
regards, paul wehner usr9110a@tso.uc.edu
