Go back about ten years and you'll find what were then extremely highend
"micros", based on the 68000, made by a company called "Sage".

I just pulled out a benchmark comparison from Australian Personal Computer,
February 1986, where they compare all the machines they benchmarked in 1985.
Top of the table was the "Sage II".  They say, "For all the advances of the
year, nobody has been able to better the Sage II for speed".  In case anyone
is interested, the top five micros of the time were (speedwise):

  Sage II
  HP Vectra
  Compaq Deskpro 286
  Commodore Amiga
  Kaypro 286i

In reference to the Amiga, they say "Also beating [the IBM AT] was the
great Commodore hope, the Amiga.  This is as much a home as a business
micro, so takes the prize from Challenger in the home category, being
over twice as fast.  It is a good deal faster than other business micros
too.  Note that it runs a 68000 processor".

Fascinating, eh?  How times have changed, and all that...  :-(

Anyway, the point is that Sage used to be a name associated with 68k
systems, so it's not inconceivable that they have been laying low these
last eight years and now for some strange reason want to buy Commodore.
Who knows?
