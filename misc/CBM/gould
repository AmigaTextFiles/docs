        What consensus? Liquidation means that the debtors sell off the
assetts for whatever they can get towards what they are owed. It is
possible for someone to buy the intellectual assetts (even the physical
assetts) out of a liquidation sale and start business again with all
the debts erased. This has happened before.
        As a matter of fact, Gould (oh no!) is a SECURED creditor of
Commodore International Limited. What is his security? I don't know,
but he is personally a creditor of the corporate entity. (Adam Smith
was opposed to incorporation of companies, by the way) Gould could
easily bid for the intellectual and some tangible assetts of the
company in a liquidation sale. So could anyone else who is interested.
Newtek/Scala are the only ones who come to mind who would find the
intellectual assetts of interest.
        This is quite possibly a manuever by Gould to wipe out the
debts and start again.
        Then again.....
