| I guess we knew it was coming, but it's still a shock.
|
| Today, April 27, 1994 Commodore Business Machines closed their US operations.
| The West Chester facility has been closed down and the employees there have
| been terminated.

Further info:

The company has kept a skeleton crew to wrap up operations.  They expect to be
pink-slipped in a few weeks.  Terminated employees received no severence pay.
(That really sucks!)  More details as they become available.
