    This guide was originally created because i was bored one night and had just read Bradmans old
    AmigaGuide bradlysmith.guide and thought it was quite kewl!. The first version was my very 
    first ever attempt at AmigaGuide. Version 2 has been improved, almost completely rewritten. 
    The most noticable difference is that i have dropped the kEWL lETTERiNG because of comlaints 
    that ppl couldn`t read it. They must be getting old! There are a few other differences, see 
    @{"History" link future} fore more details.
  
    Also when i did the first Guide iNFERN0^bBS wasn`t open, it is now tho. See @{"iNFERN0^bBS aDVERT" link add}
    for details.

    iNFERN0^bBS is finally here... but i hear you ask.."how EXACTLY did it get here?" well oki you
    want to know exactly.. i`ll tell you EXACTLY!

    It all started way back in 1993, when i was just an ickle 11 year old kid. I was given this 
    big black box, and told to plug it into my brand new unexpanded a1200. I did and then found a 
    program called EZ-Comm. I dialed a number and after a load of funny noises saw CONNECT 2400!
    Wow, i thougt.. i`m on someones computer!.. WOW.. And it was from that moment that i was 
    hooked. I began to call every BBS i could find the number to and loved every minute of it.
    Then one morning, a white envelope with the words British Telecom printed in yellow changed 
    all that. Well they tried, but they failed. Yeah £300 is pretty hard for an 11 year old to find
    but i was let of just this once.. it was put down to excitement and decided that it wouldn`t
    happen again. And for the next phonebill it didn`t. £100 seemed prett resonable. But then a 
    few months later, early `94 came the first of the `big uns' £504!.. And my big black box was
    cruelly taken away. But after a few months of persuasion, i was purchased a new, smaller and 
    this time white box. With the words USRobotics Sportster 14.4. I had somehow managed to explain
    that the phonebill was so high because i was using slow modem. So off i went again. This time
    calling wasn`t enough. I wanted MY own bbs. And after playing with a copy of MAX`s BBS 1.52
    P.C.I BBS was born. After a few weeks of waiting for an occasional caller, and gathering 
    information and ideas. I closed down for 2 months.. and then reopened with a revamped BBS
    pSYCHOS!s bBs. Wow i thought, as i was recieving 5+ calls a day. Then after a year of 5+ calls
    i got bored, and started the calling again.. this time Red Rum and Amiga Web etc.. wasn`t
    enough for me. So i began to call boards in Ozz (missed you glen! :() and America. I was also
    calling out thru peak times. Then THE phonebill came. £1270!! There was no way i`d get out of
    that 1. So again, the modem was taken away and pSYCHOS!s bBs was no more. 

    But there was no way i could manage without a bbs... so i gradually payed off the debt.. which 
    took longer than i thought,.. like 3 years longer. But then in April 98 I returned. And the BBS
    was all set to open July 1st, but then another delay. The 100% full 1.3gig HD which as well as
    containing the whole 7000+ filebase contained the rest of the bbs as well. After losing 
    everything, i considered staying closed for good. But a few people changed my mind, although
    i`m sure i`d have returned sooner or later anyway.
 
    So iNFERN0^bBS was born on 04/08/98. And is now getting towards 1 months old. For more details

           iNFERN0^dESiGN is a design group. Various files are released under the name
           iNFERN0^dESiGN. Such as Ansi/Ascii collections, BBS Doors, Utilities, Text

           Past releases include a Maxs BBS Mail Box, 2 Ascii Collections, An Ansi
           Collection, Guide to iNFERN0^bBS and many more.

           Future releases planned by the leader fLAMe include new maxs bbs mail box,
           door which will allow different mail boxs (in maxs) to be shown randomly

           in Development and will be released in the future. Also all past releases

		Ways to contact fLAMe. (Reliability given)

		[1] iNFERN0^bBS - [01204] 4oo459 - 24 Hours (Most Reliable!)
		[2] Fluffy-Net - Mail to fLAMe from ANY Fluffy Net BBS (Next Reliable!)
		[3] E-Mail - flame_id@hotmail.com (Not checked very often)
		[4] FidoNet - 2:257/137.23 (NOT RELiABLE!, Only polled once in a year :) )
		[5] Fax - [01204] 400459 (Sometimes set up for Fax. Fairly Reliable!)
		[6] Pager - 07666 723872 - (VERY RELiABLE)

		Obviously the best way is to call iNFERN0^bBS!
