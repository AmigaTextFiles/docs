     
This document is a survey for current and prospective AMIGA users. The 
authors of this document want to find out what AMIGA users expect from
their computing systems. For those who were Commodore computer users from
the days of the CBM Pet to the heyday of the AMIGA 4000, they will remember
that Commodore produced a variety of high quality computers, but they
were products usually devoid of user input. For example, the A600, was
designed to be a niche replacement for the A500, and although it was based
on an integrated component set making chips less likely to unseat, and
included a PCMCIA slot, it was not what the low end user wanted.

The one complaint that most users have in common with the defunct CBM
customer support was that there was almost none for many people. Even with
the launch of the Commodore Gold Express service, most users still had to
resort to other means of support. The goal of this survey is to compile as
many users as possible and get as much input as possible. Imagine what
might have happened with the AMIGA in the late 1980's if Commodore had
listened to its users and "ADVERTISED"? Also imagine what would have
happened if they had listened to A500 users, and had figured out how to
make a ECS or AGA drop in add on to upgrade their computers? The time
wasted on the A600 could have been more efficiently invested.

This survey has three parts. Part one is a "wish list" for what users want
from the next AMIGA, assuming ESCOM continues development of this product
line. Each question is rated on a scale of importance from 1 to 10. 1
indicates low user interest 10 indicates high user interest. Part 2
contains yes/no questions about how you have used your computer and items
related to current AMIGA equipment. The third part is for you to describe
yourself and indicate items of specific concern to you about the AMIGA.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURVEY

 1. READ THE COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. THIS
    WILL SAVE US FROM MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND WRONGLY COMPILED REPLIES.

 2. USE A WORD PROCESSOR/ EDITOR TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.

 3. SAVE YOUR ANSWERS AS PLAIN ASCII TEXT.

 4. PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS OR ALTERNATE MEANS OF CONTACT.

 5. TO COMPILE THE ANSWERS OF YOUR CLUB SIMPLY FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE BELOW
    ("HOW TO PREPARE YOUR ANSWERS").

 6. SEND THE ANSWERS BACK TO US...THIS WON'T WORK IF WE DON'T GET IT BACK,
    THE OUTCOME IS UP TO YOU.

 7. FOR EMAIL, MAKE THE HEADER READ "(SURVEY REPLY)" SO WE CAN SORT OUT
    PERSONAL MAIL FROM SURVEY RESPONSES.

  User clubs are encouraged to compile the results of parts one and two.
  Individuals are encouraged to team up and compile the answers to reduce
  the load on the few people that are compiling the survey results.

HOW TO PREPARE YOUR ANSWERS

If you are an individual just list the question number and your answer for
each one. Arrange the answers in rows so we can tabulate them. For part one
of the survey your answers would look something like this:

EXAMPLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SURVEY ANSWER SHEET PART ONE NEXT

-------top of response page-----
(Your name would go here.)
Question/Answer           Question/Answer         Question/Answer
1- 10                     20- 2                   30- 5
2- 4                      21- 3                   31- 6
3- 0                      22- 10                  32- 0
4- 3                      24- 7                   33- 4

ETC. until the bottom of the page is reached.

There are a bunch of questions, but list all the questions that you
answered. For any question numbers that you do not list we will assume that
they do not apply to you.

If you are a person from a user group compiling the answers for the members
of your group, the task is a bit more daunting. You need to construct a
table of questions with the responses of your group marked on it. See the
example:

EXAMPLE FOR A GROUP SURVEY ANSWER SHEET PART ONE NEXT

-------Top of the response page-----
(Your group name would go here.)
(The number of people in your group would go here.)
(Voluntarily, list the names of all people like this: Last Name, First Name)

question                                                  Total
---------------------------------------------------------------
       (responses are listed below top line from 1 to 10)
        -1-  -2-  -3-  -4-  -5-  -6-  -7-  -8-  -9-  -10-
---------------------------------------------------------------
Q  1.    2    1    0    5    3    12   15   10   7     2   57
U  2.                <----ANSWERS---->
E  3.    (Your group results go here. In the example for question)
S  4.    (one, a total of 57 people answered the question. Under )
T  5     (each responce is total of people who answered. For eaxmple)
I        (no one in this group selected 3 for question one, but 15)
O        (people chose number seven. The total may differ from question)
N        (to question due to people not having opinions which is why)
S        (we have included the TOTAL row.)



For part two the format is almost like part one if your an individual, but 
if you're a person completing it for a group you have another table to make.

        3.N                32.Y                62.DNA

 O  7.    (questions that either don't apply to a person)
 N  8.    (or because they just did not answer.)
 S  9.


For PART THREE just include the information requested in part three of the
survey. If you are compiling the results of a group, attach all of the part
three answers of your members to a single copy of parts one and two of the
survey with the tables of responses for all the members. This will make for
some big EMAIL files but your time spent organizing your group's answers
will help us a great deal and will shorten the time it takes before ESCOM
receives this.

The goal of this survey is to compile as many users as possible and
present the results to ESCOM as soon as possible. The reasons for this are
many. Firstly, we believe that AMIGA users finally deserve to be heard by
the company making AMIGAs. Secondly, we belive that AMIGA users will
support and buy only those AMIGA products which we need. If ESCOM follows
Commodore's policy of ignoring the users, we will be given what ESCOM
thinks we want, but not what we really need or want. Thirdly, ESCOM will
not invest in AMIGA development if they are under the impression that AMIGA
users are too few to warrant new AMIGA products. So please fill this out,
think of it as a vote for the AMIGA's future.

Please remember, we expect hundreds of responses to this survey so please
do keep it short, but also don't be afraid to express you thoughts. This
might be the only chance to do that...

The survey you return to us should simply be a listing of question numbers
followed by your answers. DO NOT INCLUDE THE QUESTIONS THEMSELVES.
Attached to the first two parts should also be part 3, which contains
some or none of the 6 topics in that part. Even if you have no comments
at least include your name and how to contact you in the event of an
ESCOM emergency or in case we decide to contact the participants.

    Thank you
