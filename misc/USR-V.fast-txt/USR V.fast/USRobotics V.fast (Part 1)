Well, here is the U.S.R. announcement, in, I think, it's entirety,
courtesy of the Internet:

Following the anouncment is a discuession with US Robotics, Dale Walsh,
one of the committee members of the CCITT study group developing the
CCITT V.Fast Standard.
  

           U.S. ROBOTICS ANNOUNCES THE LAST MODEM YOU'LL EVER BUY
        Provides Migration Path to Forthcoming CCITT 28.8 Kbps Standard
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

     SKOKIE, Ill. -- June 8, 1992 -- U.S. Robotics today announced an upgrade
program for the CCITT-proposed standard of 28.8 Kbps, previously referred to
as V.FAST.  The Courier V.32bis, Courier HST Dual Standard and Shared Access
Modem Sharing Kits are the products currently included in the program. Field
upgrades will be available for $299 as soon as the CCITT 28.8 Kbps draft
recommendation is completed. Official approval of the standard is not
expected until January, 1994.
     "The CCITT-proposed 28.8 Kbps standard won't be a reality for most
manufacturers until 1994," said Jonathan Zakin, U.S. Robotics executive vice
president, sales and marketing.  "By offering modems ready for 28.8 Kbps now,
we're providing insurance against technical obsolescence.  Customers can
purchase a Courier high-speed modem or Shared Access Modem Sharing Kit now
and take advantage of the most updated technology available. When the 28.8
Kbps standard becomes available later, they'll already have a cost-effective
upgrade option and won't have to re-invest in new equipment."
     "Key to the 28.8 Kbps program is the fact that the upgrade to the
Courier high-speed modems and Shared Access Modem Sharing Kits can be
completed by the end user at their worksite, which reduces their `down' time
and eliminates excess costs like shipping and handling," continued Zakin.
"You may hear about other 28.8 Kbps modems that are available now, but until
the standard is defined, no one knows what hardware will be needed to comply.
Our unique modem architecture makes future `field' upgrades a realistic and
simple procedure."
     Because of U. S. Robotics' advanced modular modem architecture, the
company's Courier V.32bis, Courier HST Dual Standard, and Shared Access
modems
are readily upgradable to 28.8Kbps. The modems are made up of a motherboard
and
a smaller daughterboard, which holds the modems' microprocessors and
firmware.
The current, high-speed daughterboard can easily be replaced with a new board
containing the 28.8 Kbps CCITT standard.  U.S. Robotics is the only modem
manufacturer to implement this kind of flexible design.
     "In the CClTT, the previously called `V.FAST' standard has gained
universal support at the 28.8Kbps speed," said Dale Walsh, U.S. Robotics vice
president, advanced development and participant in the CCITT committee on the
28.8 Kbps standard, "This is how our modular architecture works. The data
pump (which executes the modulation and demodulation of the data), and the
key controller functions (which perform the data compression, error control
and the AT command set) are on one board, making upgrades simple. We can
easily make the data pump faster and upgrade the controller functions to keep
up with the new speed. It's all in just one small plug-in card."
     Because compatibility with CCITT standards is crucial, U.S. Robotics'
availability and implementation of the 28.8Kbps standard will depend on the
CClTT's progress.  At this time, the standard is expected to define a connect
speed of 28.8 Kbps, two times faster than V.32bis, the fastest CCITT
standard now available.
     U.S. Robotics is one of the first vendors to announce a program for
28.8Kbps compatibility.  The company has a history of industry "firsts,"
including the first CCITT V.32bis modem from a major manufacturer, the first
self-managing modem management system and the first portable CCITT V.32
modem.
     U.S. Robotics will upgrade any Modem Sharing Kit to 28.8Kbps. Current
Courier models, which have the smaller footprint and a higher, 57.6 Kbps DCE
to DTE (modem-to-computer) interface speed, are also upgradable. The
company's upgrade program does not include WorldPort and Sportster modems.
     U. S. Robotics Courier modems offer a wide range of features, including
fax, remote configuration, and synchronous capabilities. The Shared Access
Modem Sharing Kits, which began shipping in March, 1992, allow for the
pooling of modems on a LAN so that a LAN user can access them for dial-in or
dial-out communications.
     The following products will be upgradable to 28.8 Kbps:

  Courier V.32 bis, internal and external          (57,600 bps versions only)
  Courier HST Dual Standard, internal and external (57,600 bps versions only)
  Courier V.32 bis FAX, internal and external
  Courier HST Dual Standard FAX, internal and external
  Shared Access Modem Sharing Kit Single Port and Dual Port
