-- DCTV DEMOS ------------------------------------------------------------

Pointles.LZH  Pointless! My premiere DCTV animation. And what a premiere
              it is!  This is still my favorite of all of them, but I
              vow to out-do it!  Done in FULL TRACE mode.

              SLICE feature that deals with something other than 3-D text.

              glass-type refraction.  Done in FULL TRACE mode.

              (no pun intended) of view.  Done in FULL TRACE mode.
