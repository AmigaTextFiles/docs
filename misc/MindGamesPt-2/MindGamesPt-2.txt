but can you do it by changing the position of only
two matches? (The dog must keep his tail upturned.)

About 20 minutes later, you reach an intersection where five roads meet at one
spot. Unfortunately, the road sign has been knocked over and damaged, so much
so that you can't tell how it originally pointed. You can identify the five
arrows pointing to Boondock, Crockville, Hicksburg, Resume Speed, and
Kalamazoo. You are alone at the crossroads; there's no one to ask. How
do you find out which of the roads leads to Kalamazoo, your destination.
