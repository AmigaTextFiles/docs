I think you would boot as usual vie 68k and then the first command in
the startup-sequence would initialize the 68k-emulation on the ppc,
maybe set up some functions for interrupt-serving on the 68k (if
necessary) and then make a soft-reset where the whole boot-procedure is
repeated - but with an emulated 68k.

I think that there are a lot of people out there that have misconfigured 
their systems for some reason or another. I keep hearing from people that get 
significantly higher frame rates than others with the same setup... It might 
be some patches/hacks or different SIMM modules, CD-ROM drives or whatever... 

Plus, some people expect too much from the low end. Playing in 320x240 isn't 
that bad really.

On the other hand, piracy is the prime factor for low sales.

No, that would take too long. We *are* an Amiga company, and we'll continue 
in spite of the drawbacks, as long as we can.

When we started, 5 companies announced G3 board. I'm now about to

No, the mediator connects to the A1200 expansion port. There's no Zorro III 
in the A1200...

I heared that there should be an A4000 version. Plus, there's DCE's G-Rex.

Yeah, this rumor was spread some time ago. But, we are an Amiga company,
and we'll always be as long as there's an Amiga, old or new. It's just
that we also have to make a livinf somehow, so we have to get something

I'm more than interested to see performance with voodoo3 and Heretic2 for example :)

Let's bet that H2 will in 1024x768 16bit run ~30fps :)

Although I have a sound card (Prelude1200), I agree that they're
very expensive. I bought it mainly because I wanted to sample 16bit
sound for my CD recorder and MP3s. If I was a gamer only, I wouldn't
have bought it. But who uses an Amiga only to play games?

A PPC-only card is more than required. We would have needed them two or
three years ago already, to keep developers from moving to Windows and
Linux. If Phase5 had left the 68k CPU away, we would be in the same lap
as Macintosh. But we aren't even in the same race :(

Those who think that an A1200 or A4000 motherboard is enough also think
that the world is a disc. We need a whole new computer!

You can get one from Hi-Soft and Power Computing in the UK to mention two.
I bought one originally when I got my 2xSpeed CD-ROM, I now
use my PPC card with scsi for my ZIP drive and have an internal
IDE CD-ROM.

> If it plugs into pcmcia port [I mean, Mediator], what about scsi scanner?

Na, it's not that expansion port, its the one located underneath in the trapdoor, if
you still have it in the original case.

The other cause, has to be the unavailability of PPC and Permedia 2 cards.

Indeed, but how much would they cost.  I folked out =A3550 for my PPC car=

It's a sad thing to hear, but as soon as we get one of the PCI add-ons, the
sales
may go up (fingers crossed).

I was thinking about buying Heretic 2, but I'm not really into that type of 3D
game.
I like Quake 2 etc, but I have it already on the PC using my Voodoo 2 card.

Also, by the time there are Amiga versions of some games, it's available on the
PC for
around half the price.

I wish I could have voodoo etc on my Amiga and support the Amiga better, We'll
have
to see.

I'm VERY happy that you are giving the option of these games, but its the usual
vicious circle.
If we don't buy something for the sake of it, then products will be removed
from the shelves, and
if there isn't anything available from software houses we have nothing to buy.

I bought wipeout 2079, but even on my PPC240/BVision I wasn't overwhealmed,
becuase I'm
used to 3dfx/open GL and Voodoo gfx output.

What I hope to do is get a voodoo 3 card and Mediator board, a sound card,
ethernet and maybe
a USB card for it (ooh, all 4 slots used already)

It's the form factor size, hence the different versions.

OT: Interestingly Phase 5's equivelant GFX card to the BVision on the Mac was
called
the G-Rex.

Do you have any info about Mediator supported PCI sound cards for Amiga ?

Sound is another big problem in Amiga for games these days...

With the coming of the Vood boards, there will be a new Warp3D driver
for these boards soon. As soon as this one's done, we'll think about a
new version of Warp3D to make use of the new features of the Voodoo,
like the multitexturing.

no!!!! that would be too slow. the Mediator plugs into the trapdoor
expansion port - you need a tower to give it the room it requires. - there
are pictures of it all over the Web now.  the PPC accel card then plugs into
its through-port.

its very neat, very compact and looks gorgeous. I've also seen it operating
(but only on a 2D VirgeDX screen in 16bit, so cant state 3D performance yet)

there are already PCI PPC solutions - just requires the software drivers and

no, MediatorPCI with decent 3D cards supported and a PPC-only card (with 68k
emulation) is whats required.

certainly, AMIE and AmigaONE are not Amiga, despite what is in the names,
they will be different beasts altogther (and require a whole new computer to

imho a A1200 with BlizzardPPC, with Mediator/Voodoo3 + PCI sound card
isn't really a Amiga too...Original Amiga died 1993...

What I have now is a custom-PPC-68k hardware running AmigaOS, Linux and
MorphOS...Day by day original Amiga features are disappearing in our
systems..

Since there are no plans for Amiga OS 4.0 PPC (MorphOS can be a AmigaOS4,
but it isn't official), we'll have to create and find a new Amiga someday
soon..

Is it connecting in PCMCIA slot? I'm these days trying to see how to buy [and where]
ScsiSquirrel [or SurfSquirrel?] that connects to PCMCIA port of my A1200. I desperatelly

around 150 :( ? (Nightlong PPC from Clickboom had also 110 orders) :(((

I think biggest cause for low sales is 603 and Permedia2 (of course after
piracy)
Some of my friends were very disappointed when they saw Heretic2 running
(although
they were expecting it slow on 603 and Permedia2)..

It`s not Hyperion`s fault really...PPC market isn`t strong enough for the=

games
imho..I mean a high-end Amiga doesn`t exist for these games..

Maybe Hyperion should put Amiga ports on hold and wait for PPC G3 boards =

we
need PPC G3/G4 boards...

Agreed. I`ve wondered if it would be possible for someone with the know-how to
write a WOS interface for Paula. ATM AHIWOS looks to be a dead end. 
I`m guessing (probly wrongly) that a WOS native DoIO and WaitIO would speed
things up as the audio.device could run on 68k asynchronously.

Any comments?

I found ScsiSquirrel here!!! for just 50 DM!!! It is 3 years old but as that friend does
not want it anymore [ScsiCD is broken and also ScsiHD is], I'll pick it up [when
protests are over]. I'll just need that 90degree [or 180degree?] adapter to be able
to connect ScsiSquirrel into my tower :))))

Indeed, I hope so, if we can get access to PCI cards, then hopefully people will

It uses one of those white connectors as found in a Power Tower.
Issue 13 of Amiga Active shows you this board, but not a full review until next
month.
I presume the power goes through the Mediator into the Amiga mobo, hmmm
I haven't looked into my Tower for ages, maybe I'll look.

All I wan't to know, is if the Mediator will fit my Power Tower and if there
will be enough space
to fit my Blizzard PPC card too.

..the main question is why has it taken until 2000 until we get these PCI
cards. Why couldnt they have been made in 1994/5 after the A1200 release
when towers first appeared for the A1200. Before the expense of custom small
hardware bits inside the A1200

in terms of hardware, i have no problems with Paula's output - it still
compares favourably even to a SoundBlaster 128.

however, until we either have fast sound access (re PCI soundcard) or PPC
native access to sound without 68k context switching etc etc, then sound
will slow applications down

after Voodoo3 drivers, driver software for SB and Yamaha soundcards,

The only card that has been announced is based on a Yamaha 744 chipset, I

Maybe, I don't know, although the graphics board is not the only
limiting factor. The bus speed is one, too, and we don'T know how good
the Mediator will be at that...

Mediator has one big advantage - its available. Until the others are there, 
you cannot say wether one is better than the mediator, due to the lack of 
comparison. 

Concerning the Predator, I find the idea of plugging a PCI bridge onto a PPC 
card and then putting a G3 on that a bit... "strange".

Yes, but the whole memory is separated in 8mb-windows which have to be
switched first before you can access an other window than the actual one.

Right. It is 90-degree adapter. I have plenty of space in tower. I measured. Just to

Porting is not the problem. Sharing between 68K and PPC is the problem.
Before someone starts porting anything to PPC he has to analyse
seriously how to make sure, that both parts (AOS/68K, AOS/WOS/PPC)
can use the device both without interfering themselves. This involves
shared resource allocation, semaphores etc. I don't know how to solve
this cleanly without using any context-switches.

The 8mb memory window is a myth. 
If you read carefully Elbox' reply to a certain other company's
accusations, you'll see that the Mediator can take advantage of far
more memory than any current graphics card has!

Hi

Will your Warp3D Voodoo drivers will work (in theory) with
other BlizzardPPC based G-REX and Predator PCI
boards ?

I think that 8mb memory window on Mediator will be a problem
for Voodoo cards...To be honest I don't expect better performances from
Voodoo3 on Mediator bus than a Permedia2 .


What make you think so ? Is it this problem of bank switching ? Elbox cla=

it's not a problem, other (Ralph Schmidt not to mention him) think it wil=

Not an interface for Paula, but something like AHI should be done. Paula is
old and dusty. Someone should port the device access functions of
exec.library
for WarpOS. But I don't know if it's possible to use the Amiga hardware
without context switching. Proove me wrong :)

Definitely. And even if there was no context-switch it wouldn't be
*that* much faster. It's not something computing-intensive.

which doesnt take long at all (less than 3 calls I guess) and you'd only
need to do when uploading textures into the 2nd 8Mb of the voodoo3 (for
example)

...when playing the game low 8Mb access to the voodoo3 would be fine for
just sending polygon commands etc

Will those context-switches make the port slower than the original?
If not, will some more exec.library functions be ported for the next
powerpc.library release (especially device I/O)?

Well, I think it will not be too problematic. For a Warp3D driver, the
window would be set to the Voodoo's register area with the
LockHardware-call. The Voodoo also has a "texture upload port", which,
if I got it right, is just a 2 MB memory area where you can put a
texture, and upload it to somewhere in memory with some register
writes... That should also limit the bank switching.

We'll see.... :)

At least I'll wait for Mediator reviews and performance tests..

Hello,

Intel uses this too. Just in a larger scale. How else do you think that i386
servers with more than 4GB ram is possible ?

So I guess that it will work fine with the Mediator too.

Kind regards

How could we tell? We never saw anything from G-Rex or Predator. They will 
obviously not work without modifications, the details must be worked out.

There might be ways around this problem. The Voodoo 3 has a transfer area for 
textures close to the register area, so it might not be that much of a 
problem. It all depends on the way CyberGraphX uses the board - the video ram 
need not be mapped when the chip tries to access it.

Fill rate will be at least 5-10 times faster than the Permedia 2. It remains 
to be seen how much impact the rest has

Unfortunately this wait-and-see attitude is what is causing a lot of 
standstill on the Amiga market. We haven't seen anything from the Predator at 
all...

Yes, but why would this lead to a significant performance problem?  The
BVisions only have 8Mb, so I assume everyone is used to using screenmodes
which fit well within 8MB -- so there's no problem fitting all of the
memory for a screen in the one 8MB page.  Isn't a generous 1600x1200x24
screenmode less than 6MB?

And surely it isn't a big problem transferring textures to the card, which
you should be able to do in chunks?

Everything I've heard suggests that you just need one extra write
operation every time you want to access a different 8MB.  Maybe it
might uses less than 8MB per block of memory for compatibility with
PCMCIA, etc., but I still can't see it being too bad.

I expect I'll want a Mediator, since it looks like coming out first, and
even if the Predetor turns out to be somehow vastly superior, the Mediator
has greater resell/pass-on-to-ppc-less-family-computer value, because you
don't need the PPC.  There's no way my father is going to buy a
PPC+BVision for his A1200, but he really needs a graphics card.

I can, however, see it as being more of a pain to write Warp3D drivers to
make sure the 8MB limitations don't slow things down significantly.

Hi all.

Just thought I'd let any interested coders know that you can download
the source to Tuxracer at tuxracer.sourceforge.net. It's a penguin
racing game for OpenGl featuring Tux the Linux penguin :)

Hi All,

Just thought I`d let you know I`ve uploaded a simple "pairs" card game for
children to aminet. It was sent today so should be there by say wednesday.
It`s in the game/think drawer as pairsw3d.lha. Sorry about the archive size. 
It`s fairly OT to mention it here but it does use W3D for the graphics.
As always comments (such as why did you bother) to the usual address.
