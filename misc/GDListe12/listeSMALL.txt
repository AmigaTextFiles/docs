Hi!

This is a very special sort of "mailing list". No real mailing list, because
asides from this file, no mailing list stuff is done. So what for is this list?
If you are a coder and need help with some Amiga Texturemapping stuff or
you are looking for new Team members for your latest project, maybe you will find
somebody on this list... and his email...

To the person who got this list : Please fill in something in the section about
yourself on this list or if you do not want to be on this list, remove your entry
and tell me to kill you of the list.

This list is also a list of what standards people are supporting on Amiga,
and what wishes they have from Amiga Technologies.

Note: I will give the information on this list to Amiga Technologies, Phase 5
and the developpers of CyberGraphX, but not now... i will do this as soon
as some more people are on the list !!!

Coders/graphicians/musicians for Amiga games/demo that are up to now not on the
list, please send me mail !!! If that list will grow BIG soon, i will be able the
information to Amiga Technologies and Phase 5 soon... but only people who
are serious about supporting Amiga, please !!!

By the way, the order in which the different people appear on that list is only
the order in which i GOT the replies to my questions... nothing else :)

This list may also be interested for developpers of GFX Boards who want to
contact people that could write games/demos/low level support libraries for
their boards...

____________________________________________________________________________

Amiga Demo/Game coders/graphicians/musicians/sound guys "Mailing List" V 1.2

1. Why this list ?

2. emails and comments

3. How to get on this list

4. Next Amiga Texturemapping conference

5. Up to date "open questions".

6. List of coders/graphicians/musicians

7. Some statistics...

8. THE AMIGA THE GUYS ON THIS LIST WANT !!!

NOTE : On ever case, be sure to read chapters 1,3,4,5, 7 and 8... there is a
short version of this list available without this LONG text chapter 2.

____________________________________________________________________________

1. Why this list

As time went by, the Amiga Texturemapping FAQ got very huge, interesting
if you want to inform yourselves about a LOT of things, but if you are
for example a developper and want to reach certain people, then it is
a bit complicated to look in that huge FAQ for the correct people...

So i created this list. It only features a list of emails, and some comments
from this people where they may state, what they are doing about Amiga
Texturemapping. Developpers on
the list will receive updates of the list by email, and other interesting
infos (New Engines, new graphics hardware, new graphics software, that
has to be taken into account, together with the email of the authors, if
those are willing to give them to me for the list.

Announcements about the Amiga Texturemapping conference (TM by MagicSN, no,
no Trade mark, just joking :) ) will be made on this list too. From now on
i won't send any longer personal invitations to the Conference by email.
I will only release public information on comp.sys.amiga.games and on
this mailing list. (Okay, that statement is : Beginning after the
31th October conference... one time i will send personal invitations...
the last time...)

Later i changed this to a general demo/game list instead of a list for
only Texturemapping coders (even if it sometimes looks that "game coder"
and "texturemapping coder" is the same in these days. The list is
open for graphicians and sound/music guys too... or people doing game
design or people from software firms...

2. emails and comments

Answers to those question list only in the BIG version of the list...

*** I already finished my first Shareware game "Diamond Caves", it can be found
*** on AmiNet. I'm currently working on a Breakout clone (with options like 2

*** it *very* important to not only support ECS *or* AGA *or* gfx-boards but
*** to write programs that work on every configuration. To achieve this, I offer
*** an option to choose a different gfx-file for different gfx-chips (like 32
*** color gfx for ECS, 256 colors for AGA/gfx-boards). OD-routines are a must
*** if you want to support gfx-boards.

*** Remember: They are a lot of poeple who upgraded their A2000/3000 with a
*** gfx-board (inlcuding me) but we are *not* able to run hardcoded AGA-games.

3. How to get on this list

As this is no real mailing list, no automatic SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE.
Simply give me the same information like the others gave me for this list.
My email is haeuser@tick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de

I will mail the latest version of this list to the people on the list
every few weeks or months (if you do not want this, tell me). I will
post it to the news and similar stuff too. And i will give the answers
i got to Amiga Technologies, Phase 5 and the developpers of CyberGraphX.

4. Next Amiga Texturemapping conference

The next Amiga Texturemapping conference will be on 1st December,
on irc channel #amitmap, 17:00 GMT

5. Open Questions

A. Attic Software is looking for a guy who could do the DSA III 3D Engine
   for an Amiga Version.

   Contact address :

   Attic Entertainment Software
   Mr. Hamma
   Sigmaringer Strasse 84
   D-72458 Albstadt

   If you want to do it using the net, you could contact (using FIDO)

   Wolfgang Schulz 2:246/8010.9

   He is not exactly the guy whom you will have to contact, he is only
   some guy working at Attic Software (but maybe he can give you an email
   to reach Mr. Hamma).

B. Many people need now developper support for future Amigas or want to
   know what is going on.

   Contact addresses at Amiga Technologies and Phase 5 for them :

   Amiga Technologies :

   gbo@amiga.de  (PR and announcement stuff)
   rudi@amiga.de (Developper support)

   Look at http://www.amiga.de too...

   Phase 5 :

   phase 5 digital products
   POWERUP-Programm
   In der Au 27
   D-61440 Oberursel
   Germany

   NOTE : You are able to order now :

   - Information about POWERUP
   - Information of the Powerup Developper Support Program
   - Information about the PowerUP Evaluation Boards for
     Developpers (shipping in January...)

   Phase 5 is interested in commercial, PD and Shareware
   developpers for PowerUP Boards *NOW*. And they work
   together with Amiga Technologies. So probably the
   Board will be at least mainly compatible with Power Amigas
   (at the Computer 95 they said "fully compatible", but
   they did not know up to then what Amiga Technologies
   is doing with the Graphics Hardware)

C. What is most urgent for demos/games on GFX Boards seems to
   be the low level support (direct access of the VRAM, Double Buffering,
   maybe scrolling... even more important than 3D stuff implemented !!!)
   It may even be a urgent thing if CyberGraphX/rtgmaster.library throw
   AGA out of business as to demos/games...

   So... if you are the manufacturer of a Graphics Board, the writer
   of graphics board drivers or something like that and you happen to know
   how to access the VGA chips of a certain Board DIRECTLY, please send
   me a mail (for rtgmaster.library...). The manufacturers that i was
   contacting up to now refused to tell me how to do this and i had
   to deal with the libraries (and mostly Double Buffering was not
   supported... :( ) Of course i know of MoveScreen and such things...
   but that is not the perfect solution... and it seems to me that some
   things (WB-Emulations, NetBSD drivers, Shapeshifter/Emplant drivers,
   Animation show programs) probably HAVE to access those VGA chips for
   DBuffering... or am i wrong ?

   And, for example for EGS Boards... if i asked them about the Board interna
   they REFUSED and simply sent me a EGS developper disk containing Autodocs
   for the egs.library (The manufacturer of the Piccolo Board was this :) )
   Probably there was some misunderstanding :(((

6. List of Coders/Graphicians/Musicians

List of Coders and official guys from software firms :

- myself
- Oskar Sundberg
- Thore Bjerklund Karlsen
- Chris Mair
- Matthew Waters of Weathermine Software
- John Hendrikx

  the guy written down by myself)
- Marcus Dyson of Team 17 (only something written down by myself what
  he stated on comp.sys.amiga.games)
- Timo Suoranta
- Steven Rennocks of OTM
- Kevin Picone
- Björn Fogelberg

List of Graphicians :

- Alex Grasso

List of Musicians :

- No one, up to now ... :(

7. Some statistics :

(Not everybody gave absolutely clear answers to every question, mostly
on things that are not 100% to overlook up to now... so numbers may
differ as to different questions...) Note about that special handling
of TEAM 17 in these numbers... as Mr.Dyson said it is not sure, if Team 17
will stay with Amiga... if they stay, they will probably support a lot,
if not... nothing...

Sorry that i miscounted in the first release some times ... i hope this
numbers are correct now... but even if i miscounted one or two votes,
the tendency still will be correct... :) And sometimes there were answers
were it was difficult to say about how to interpret them (all that "Maybe"s,
or stuff like "Low price and AGA compatibility", what as far as i know is
a contradiction...

Number of Coders/guys of software firms :
(only those counted that replied the questions...)

24

Number of Graphicians :

1

Number of Musicians :

0

Number of coders supporting High-End :

20 (+ Team 17 unsure + 1 answer "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting Graphics Boards :

15 (+ 4 answers "Maybe")

Number of Coders interested in doing Power Amiga games/demos :

14 (+ Team 17 unsure + 7 others "Maybe")

Number of developpers interested in a much better developper
support system (or thinking support currently sucks...) :

22

Number of coders that will probably continue to support Amiga :

15 (+ Team 17 and 6 others depending on success of Amiga Technology, on
    developper support, on existing market or such things...)

Number of coders supporting Graffiti :

4 (+ Team 17 and 9 others "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting ECS :

13 (+ Team 17 + 2 others "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting AGA :

20 (+ Team 17 + 1 other "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting CyberGraphX (and NOT supporting it using rtgmaster.library) :

11 (+ Team 17 + 2 others "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting rtgmaster.library :

(Note: rtgmaster.library runs on an installed CyberGraphX system too... popularity
will probably depend on what CyberGraphX 3.0 will be able to do...)

9 (+ Team 17 + 7 others "Maybe")

Number of coders interested in 3D library functions :

18

Number of coders interested in Low Level library functions :

18

As to this stuff, mostly Direct Video access and Double/Triple Buffering
was considered a "must", and 3D functions would be great, but the most
urgent thing... these low-level things...

Future Amiga GfxBoard : Custom Chips :

17 : 8

Some people stated "Both". I counted this as vote for Amiga Gfx Boards
AND as vote for Custom Chips...

Is Compatibility between Power Amiga and PowerUP needed : not needed ?

21:2 (with some people indicating that it will be a hard job "that one
is not holding back the other and if it would be inpossible to do
current Zorro III systems 100% compatible with future PCI systems,
compatibility would not be the main issue... but most stated, compatibility
would be an issue that HAS to be at all cost...)

Faster Bus systems : Stay with Zorro III ?

20:2 (+2 "possibly","if it is affordable for the user")

I think, these numbers give something to think over...

Should future Amigas contain AGA : Contain NO AGA AT ALL (price issue...)

2 (AGA) : 19 (Scrap AGA)

As to Low price vs. AGA i counted an answer "Low price" as an indication
to count the answer as "Scrap AGA". To get the exact comments, read this
list :))) Some guys mentioned the possibility of an AGA (or maybe AAA ?)
PCI Board...


8. THE AMIGA THE GUYS ON THIS LIST WANT

I tried to read a bit "between the lines". Sometimes people said
different things... but the following is what most people want :) !!!
Of course i am not 100% objective, but i really tried only to count
numbers... PLEASE READ THIS VERY CAREFUL, AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES AND
PHASE 5 !!! Of course this is a dream and not everything may come this way...
but this is what coders *HOPE*...

This Amiga has a Power PC inside. It uses a Graphics Board (that
possibly has some 3D functions in hardware, possibly not). This Board
is connected with PCI to the system. There are Amigas with Power PC
603e and others with Power PC 604 around (and in 1997 maybe even faster
ones, using the Power PC 620 or what else is coming after the 604...)

On this Amiga runs an Amiga DOS in Power PC Native code (or at least
a partially ported Amiga DOS). There is a 68k Emulation available.

A "normal" Amiga with a PowerUP Power PC of Phase 5 and a CyberGraphics
Board is 100% compatible to this system (!!!), even as to what graphics goes.
CyberGraphics is a part of the OS. The system is no longer AGA compatible
to make it cheaper to build, but AGA is available on a PCI Board (with
drivers for CyberGraphics). Zorro III is available on some sort of
PCI Bridge Board, but it is no longer built into the system by Default.

As to games, all games are playable on a ECS+PowerUP+CyberGraphics
system. Of course, maybe an old graphics Board will slow things down.
Also, a Zorro II only system will slow things down (but maybe there
will be a board with direct connection to the PowerUP ?)
The Graphics Board that comes with the official Power Amiga is very
fast. And its CyberGraphics drivers are very good optimized. There
is no longer an "A1200 style model".

There are 3D supporting Boards available, and the latest version of
CyberGraphX supports a very easy to use interface for Double/Triplebuffering,
scrolling, sprites, direct access to the VRAM (or maybe CyberGraphX
has swallowed up rtgmaster.library and included it to the system...
here my crystal ball to see to the future is a bit foggy... :) )
This code directly accesses the registers of the VGA chips, but it
provides a standard interface for doing this... this library is
what demo/gamecoders appreciate the MOST of all this phantastic
new CyberGraphX release... :) CyberGraphX comes with every Amiga...

There is a standard library collection for 3D effects, sound and
picture loading and such stuff... some nice highlevel functions and
all that... partially this library is done by former members of
the Demo scene, who provided their own private code for it...

At Amiga Technologies there are several guys doing Developper-Support
stuff, and there are printed manuals and documentation of the Amiga
DOS 4.0 available with Autodocs, Includes and explanations.

It is possible to reach the Developper-Support, using email, Compuserve,
FAX and Phone (FAX and Phone at least reachable in Germany, where Amiga
Technology is sitting).

9. How to get more info about Graphics Boards...

In the same lha as this file there is a readme "Graph.txt" giving more
information about Graphics Boards, including emails of the guys to contact
to get developper information...
