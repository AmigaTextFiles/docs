Hi!

This is a very special sort of "mailing list". No real mailing list, because
asides from this file, no mailing list stuff is done. So what for is this list?
If you are a coder and need help with some Amiga Texturemapping stuff or
you are looking for new Team members for your latest project, maybe you will find
somebody on this list... and his email...

To the person who got this list : Please fill in something in the section about
yourself on this list or if you do not want to be on this list, remove your entry
and tell me to kill you of the list.

This list is also a list of what standards people are supporting on Amiga,
and what wishes they have from Amiga Technologies.

Note: I will give the information on this list to Amiga Technologies, Phase 5
and the developpers of CyberGraphX, but not now... i will do this as soon
as some more people are on the list !!!

Coders/graphicians/musicians for Amiga games/demo that are up to now not on the
list, please send me mail !!! If that list will grow BIG soon, i will be able the
information to Amiga Technologies and Phase 5 soon... but only people who
are serious about supporting Amiga, please !!!

By the way, the order in which the different people appear on that list is only
the order in which i GOT the replies to my questions... nothing else :)

This list may also be interested for developpers of GFX Boards who want to
contact people that could write games/demos/low level support libraries for
their boards...

____________________________________________________________________________

Amiga Demo/Game coders/graphicians/musicians/sound guys "Mailing List" V 1.2

1. Why this list ?

2. emails and comments

3. How to get on this list

4. Next Amiga Texturemapping conference

5. Up to date "open questions".

6. List of coders/graphicians/musicians

7. Some statistics...

8. THE AMIGA THE GUYS ON THIS LIST WANT !!!

9. How to get more info about Graphics Boards...

NOTE : On ever case, be sure to read chapters 1,3,4,5,7,8 and 9... there is a
short version of this list available without this LONG text chapter 2.

____________________________________________________________________________

1. Why this list

As time went by, the Amiga Texturemapping FAQ got very huge, interesting
if you want to inform yourselves about a LOT of things, but if you are
for example a developper and want to reach certain people, then it is
a bit complicated to look in that huge FAQ for the correct people...

So i created this list. It only features a list of emails, and some comments
from this people where they may state, what they are doing about Amiga
Texturemapping. Developpers on
the list will receive updates of the list by email, and other interesting
infos (New Engines, new graphics hardware, new graphics software, that
has to be taken into account, together with the email of the authors, if
those are willing to give them to me for the list.

Announcements about the Amiga Texturemapping conference (TM by MagicSN, no,
no Trade mark, just joking :) ) will be made on this list too. From now on
i won't send any longer personal invitations to the Conference by email.
I will only release public information on comp.sys.amiga.games and on
this mailing list. (Okay, that statement is : Beginning after the
31th October conference... one time i will send personal invitations...
the last time...)

Later i changed this to a general demo/game list instead of a list for
only Texturemapping coders (even if it sometimes looks that "game coder"
and "texturemapping coder" is the same in these days. The list is
open for graphicians and sound/music guys too... or people doing game
design or people from software firms...

2. emails and comments

Comment about currently running projects :

I am the keeper of the Amiga Texturemapping FAQ and the keeper of the
Amiga game/demo coder list. I am also in with the rtg.library
project, programming the EGS version of the library. I am also very
interested in bringing people together who maybe are interested in
creating an Amiga Texturemapping Game together. As system i own an
expanded A4000/040 and i am a "030/040+Graphics Board" advocate.
(Soon Power Amiga advocate :))) ) I just recently restarted coding that
256 color Dungeonmaster clone of mine, now basing it on rtgmaster.library,
and it will probably use 640x480 screens now... I am doing some
graphics Board support code (EGS+CyberGraphX) for Nemac 4, too...
Now, let's talk a bit to myself, asking me questions... :)

* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

Yes.

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Yes.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Yes.

* Will you do commercial projects ?

No, probably not.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD prohects ?

Yes.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

No.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Hobbyist.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

No (only Texturemapping FAQ and some graphics Board support stuff)

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

No

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

No

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Maybe

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

No

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

Yes (using rtgmaster.library)

* Will you support EGS ?

Yes (using rtgmaster.library)

* Will you support Picasso II ?

Yes (using rtgmaster.library)

* Will you support the Draco ?

Yes (using rtgmaster.library)

* Will you support Retina ?

If rtgmaster.library will support it...

* Will you support Merlin ?

If rtgmaster.library will support it...

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

Yes (using rtgmaster.library)

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

Yes !!!

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Yes. (Please... Double/triple buffering support !!!)

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes. (Now i allowed myself to give these answers to them... :) )

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes. How it is done up to now, really sucks... they (Amiga Tech.) will have
to change this, if they want a lot of developpers for their machines.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes !!!

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them

After i am finished with studying, yes.

* Will you support ECS ?

Maybe (using rtgmaster.library)

* Will you support AGA ?

Maybe (using rtgmaster.library)

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Yes. New graphics of Power Amiga using CyberGFX
like the Power UP systems would be fine.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

GFX Boards with 3D support (or, MAYBE, a high end
Custom Chipset, but *ONLY* if it comes with CyberGraphX support !!! But
this is dangerous for compatibility... so GFX Board would probably be
better...)

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

PCI in Power Amigas in connection with a PCI subsystem with the Phase 5
Power UP Boards would be fine.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

rtgmaster.library or CyberGraphX (if they add equivalent features as in
the rtgmaster.library and make low level things more easier to use like
in rtgmaster.library - I am talking about VRAM access and Multibuffering
here !!!).

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

68040 or a cheap PowerPC(601 or 603e). (Both with a fast memory
interface, no slow Chip RAM or slow memory interface like from the
A4000 anymore !!! I think a 68030 for spring release in a A1200
case is too slow... but it would be an enhancement, as to the
current situation, till the Power PC arrives, okay... maybe they
should do this thing and bundle it with the cheapest Power UP
as soon as this is available.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

As Phase 5 started to port the OS, release a minimum ported version for
68k Emulation first and continue porting later, until the whole OS is
ported. Amiga Technologies, do the port together with Phase 5.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

I would start supporting CyberGraphX. The other system... maybe, but not
sure (probably, if they turn out incompatible, the best way, to solve
the problem would be doing CyberGraphX and rtgmaster.library drivers
for the new chipset)

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Difficult question. Systems using Power UP Boards in fact HAVE it (sometimes),
for the others crap AGA. Use CyberGraphX for the OS. AGA compatibility
could make the cost for building the systems too high, probably. (Maybe
as an add on for extra $50-$75, if that is possible ? Or some sort of
emulation ?) As to the Bus... Crap Zorro III, as it is too expensive
in manufacturing, use PCI. (You could do a Zorro III add on, if it is
really that urgently needed...)

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

To Amiga Tech. : Don't let stay the A4000 users in the rain. Make CyberGraphX part
of the OS.
To Phase 5 : Support these low level things.
To Both : Do a 3D supporting graphics Board (maybe as add on to the Power UP for
Phase 5 Boards, as PCI Board or custom chips with CyberGraphX support for Amiga
Technology). Do a developper support that is finally worth this name. Current
support sucks. Provide support for Power PC Amigas *before* the actual systems
appear, so games can be completely done, before the system is finished (here
Phase 5 is doing a *great* job, after what i heard...)

***************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

I own one :)

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

I am no coder :)

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Again, I am no coder.

* Will you do commercial projects ?

I am already doing graphics for Nemac 4, so probably yes is the correct answer.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD projects ?

Yes.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

No.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Semi-Professional.

No (But soon).

* Will you support other platforms ? Which ?

My Graphics is absolutely forbidden to use on any other computer than the Amiga :)

* Will you support the Graffiti board ?

I AM NO CODER.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

NO CODER !!! (sigh...)

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

No coder...

* Will you support EGS ?

No coder...

* Will you support Picasso II ?

No coder...

* Will you support the Draco ?

No coder...

* Will you support Retina ?

No coder...

* Will you support Merlin ?

No coder... (but i hope i will get my upgraded Merlin
soon... one YEAR after i sent it in...)

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

No coder...

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

No coder...

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

I really would enjoy PLAYING the games using this library. But as i am
no coder (you know ? :) ) i can't use the library myself !!!

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

No coder.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

I will continue to paint GFX for Amiga games. (And even if i and the coder of
the game end up to be the only ones to play this game... :) )

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

Yes.

* Will you support ECS ?

I usually start with 256 colors at least...

* Will you support AGA ?

Yes. Probably.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
completely compatible ?

Yes. As i have an A4000 where maybe someday a "Power UP" will be in.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

GFX Boards with 3D support.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

PCI.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be :

Fast 640x480 8 Bit graphics at least. Chunky Graphics. If possible,
3D in hardware and fast 15/16 Bit graphics too...

* What do you think the low end for Amigas should be in the future ?

Low end sucks. :)

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

Port in combination with 68k Emulation.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

As i am the graphician, my graphics probably will go where the coder
wants them to go. But they probably will be 640x480 8 Bit at least,
those graphics...

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

If it does not end up the thing to be too expensive, provide AGA. Else
crap AGA. Use PCI-Bus. ZIII only if not to expensive.

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

To Amiga Tech: Create a system with a PCI GFX Board and a Power PC that
strikes dead all that PCs :)))

**************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

I'm not sure if I understand this question. My game will be faster on a high-
end amiga, yes. :)

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

I already do. Kinda. :)

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Yes, when I buy a PPC Amiga.

* Will you do commercial projects ?

That's what I'm doing right now, yes. :)

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD prohects ?

I've got a shareware utility out on aminet any day now.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Well, yeah, though I've worked a lot with PC's. And I wouldn't mind if someone
converted my game to the PC, since there's a lot of money over there. But I'll
always program on my Amiga, yes.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

Not anymore, no.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

Sorry, can't say anything.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

The same.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Nope.

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

It doesn't look so right now. A PMac conversion in the future, maybe?

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Not specifically, no. (A quick explanation here: ToH adapts to any screenmode
that is capable of 32 colours, and fills that resolution and overscan nicely.
With the screenmode requester, you can choose any screenmode you have
available. So, CGfx-users for example can easily run ToH on a 800x600 screen.
It adapts and resizes. :) I only use OS stuff for graphics, so it should
really be compatible with everything. (Note from me : Not to Graffiti, because
of the real special screen format of the Graffiti, but for all other Boards
he is probably right...)

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

Not specifically, no.

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

The same.

* Will you support EGS ?

The same.

* Will you support Picasso II ?

Well, more of the same.

* Will you support the Draco ?

Samesame.

* Will you support Retina ?

Stop this. ;)

* Will you support Merlin ?

Hey, I told you! :)

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

Huh?

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

Huh? :)

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

I'm not into 3D stuff, maybe in the future, yes.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes, it is.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Would be great, yes.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

As long as there's a market, yes. And there is quite a market right now. :)

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

Depends on the project, if it's a game I like on another platform, and I'm not
busy on projects of my own (I usually am)

* Will you support ECS ?

ToH does (Only playable in lowres). Other stuff only works with a minimum of
256 colour screens.

* Will you support AGA ?

Probably, yes.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Nope, only with nice stuff. :)

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

GFX boards.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

PCI? :)

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

The minimum standard should be a SVGA capable gfx-card or AGA.

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

PPC604 will probably be quite lowend when the PAmigas arrive.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

A native OS with 68k emulation.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
 chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

I only support standard stuff.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

The best things should have the highest priority (PCI/AGA compatibility) If
the performance suffer with AGA compatibility (hardware wise, OS compatibility
is a MUST) then get rid of that old stuff. :)

As much as possible.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

YES!

* Will you do commercial projects ?

If I get the chance, yes.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD projects ?

Yes.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes!   I  have  tried almost all kinds of computers, but none can equal
the Amiga.  It's the only computer which is fun working with.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

Yes.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

No.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Hobbyist.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Major and major.. It's been a while since my last release.

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

Hopefully not.  Mac is out of the question, I hope I never have go over
to the PC.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Depends on it's popularity.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

I couldn't afford them anyway, so I can't test anything with them.

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

Perhaps.  I need more info about it.

* Will you support EGS ?

Perhaps, depends on it's popularity.

* Will you support Picasso II ?

Perhaps.  Need info.

* Will you support the Draco ?

Perhaps, if I get any info on how to make things compatible with it.

* Will you support Retina ?

Perhaps.  Need info.

* Will you support Merlin ?

Haven't heard anything about this?

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

What is this?  Old CBM?  Doubtfully.

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

Don't know what it is, but if it's not dead slow I might support it.

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Only if it is *fast*.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes!  Absolutely, I want to see the Amiga live again!

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes, I will never sell my Amigas.

Could be nice, depends on what they want.

* Will you support ECS ?

Doubtfully.

* Will you support AGA ?

Yes, if nothing miraculously better comes along.

 completely compatible ?

Yes,  although  I  don't  need  too  much compatibility between the old
Amigas and the new PowerPC ones.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

FAST Custom chipsets, with GFX-board specs.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga

Yes!

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

Don't know if I understand your question..

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

At  LEAST  68030/50  should  be  the  LOW  end.   It's  not a very fast
processor by todays standards.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

Fast.  It should take advantage of the processor.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

Don't know, time will tell.  If it's not too much work I would probably
support both, depends on CyberGraphX' popularity.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibili
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Low price, definitely.  I'm not a very rich guy!

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

I just want to see something happening with the Amiga!

*** Comments about currently running projects ?

*** Our current/recent Amiga projects are Alien Breed 3D, a Doom Stlye game for
*** all AGA Amigas, Speris Legacy, a Zelda style game for all 1Mb Amigas,
*** Worms, the best game ever! and Alien Bred 3D Special Edition, a high-res,
*** high end version of Aline Breed 3D.

******************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas :

It is not clear how long the Amiga market can support larger developers
like Team 17, but we are supporting high-end machines ith Alien Breed
Special Edition

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

With Alien Breed 3D, certainly.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Here Mr.Dyson referred to an article he wrote in comp.sys.amiga.games.
In this article he said, it depends on how Amiga Technology deals this
stuff. He is *VERY* disappointed with what they call developper support,
and developper support will be one of the things that will decide, if
Team 17 will support Power Amigas. He is very disappointed that nobody
at Amiga Technologies contacted Team 17 at all, too. But it is still
possible...

* Will you do commercial projects :

Again, much depends on the performance of the Amiga and the support of
Amiga Technologies over the coming months.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD projects ?

No

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Amiga Freak - yes! Amiga only - no were can't afford to be that narrow minded.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

No, but our comapny has many who came from the demo scene.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

Team 17 Software Limited

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Pro

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Yes

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

Playstation, PC, Saturn, Mac, and to a lesser extent 3D0, CDi, Jaguar,
SNES, Megadrive.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under
review.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under
review.

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under
review.

* Will you support EGS ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under
review.

* Will you support Picasso II ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a

Yes, this would be very interesting.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

At presnt, it is very difficult to make a decision on this. The company had
taken the decision that Worms would be our last Amiga game, but we have
since announced Alien Breed 3D Special Edition. We will keep an eye on the
market, and see what support the machine receives from the customers, and
what support the developers receive from AT, then we will make our
decision. We will not turn our backs on a profitable market.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

Possibly.

* Will you support ECS ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under
review.


* Will you support AGA ?

At present, this is not clear. Our continued support for the Amiga is under
review.


* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Yes, there is no point in fracturing the market with incompatible standards
at this point.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

Not necessarily, an OEM defined standard would be nice. A standardised
retargetable graphics standard would be nice too!

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

Possibly.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

CyberGraphX looks fairly good. A standard this good at least.

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

040 min. HD standard.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

Seamless, with backwards compatibility for OS legal software.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

The market can probably only bear support for the manufacturer standard. It
would be nice if CyberGraphX hardware were standard, but if it weren't,
support would need to be for whatever was.


* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Low Price, PCI. Fuck AGA, it's too slow. (Comment from the author of this
list :  The man is talking about what i am thinking...  :)))) )

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

To AT - Do something, do something drastic, do it now!

*** Comment about currently running projects :
*** - Did not get one as i forgot to ask - But this is Shade, the
*** game with the Textdemo engine, as i know...

*****************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas :

Yes. Without the Amiga games pushing for continued advancement of the
platform the Amiga is prone to standing still (as it did with the ideology
that any new game must work on an unexpanded Amiga 500 with no hard drive)
and therefore we may lose out on the newest games because they are not
considered portable to our platform.

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code :

Yes. Our lead programmer (John Hendrikx) has already started a grass roots
movement to make an Amiga standard library for retargetable graphics
(rtgmaster.library). This library will allow the Amiga not only to use the
latest gfx boards but also allow unexpanded Amiga's to continue displaying
the newest games.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future :

YES!! More that anything the Amiga needed to step into the "Next Generation"
of computing. The movement to this processor is exactly what we needed. We
would be foolish not to aim for the PPC Amiga as soon as it is available.
Our games ahave already been structured to port to a newer system (flexable
code that is easily converted).

* Will you do commercial projects :

Yes. We are a small and new company. We are also all Amiga enthusiasts who
wanted to continue with the Amiga rather than jumping platform to an OS with
"more power" so we could execute our ideas.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD prohects :

Yes. We like the idea of controlling our product without outside influence.
This doesn't mean we will turn away distribution.. but we will market and
distribute our products through Shareware methods if there is nobody else
interested in publishing us at the time.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Well we all are very much addicted to our Amiga's :). We constantly hang
around Comp.Sys.Amiga.Games, #Amiga (IRC) and other Amiga outlets.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene :

Not really. We release demos but we try to focus on delivering finished
products.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) :

We are called Fusion Productions.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist :

Right now semi-professional as our first game (SHADE) has not been released.
If you ask me this question in a month hopefully this will read professional :).

* Did you already release major stuff :

No... but we are very close :).

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

This is a difficult question. Right now the answer is no.... but we may
consider doing ports to BeBox or other interesting platforms.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Probably.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

I would love too :).

* Will you support CyberGraphX :

Already do.

* Will you support EGS :

Yes.

* Will you support Picasso II :

Yes.

* Will you support the Draco :

Probably.

* Will you support Retina :

Yes.

* Will you support Merlin :

Yes.

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board :

Probably. (Annotation from me, Steffen Haeuser : There is now CyberGraphX
           available, and my rtgEGS.library (sublibrary of rtgmaster.library
           for EGS) supports the A2410 if EGS is installed for this Board)

* Will you support rtgmaster.library :

Oh yes!!!!

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
* games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
* direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
* new version of CyberGraphX) :

Yes :).

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 :

Please do. We want to be a part of a new generation of Amiga companies.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 :

As soon as we can get it. It would be great if we could ship our games
immediately when the new Amiga's hit the market. This would draw user
interest back to the platform.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future :

Yes! If the move o PowerPc is any indication (and a standard HD/CD Rom comes
along) then there is great hope in the Amiga.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them

Well it depends on the stuff :)... But we are always open to suggestions.

* Will you support ECS :

As long as we can. Although the gfx may not look the best on ECS our games
right now will not abandon ECS users. (We believe playability surpases
visual appearance)

* Will you support AGA :

Yes ... again as long as we can. We don't see AGA any differently than
ECS... both systems are dying but we cannot abandon them quite yet.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible :

Well compatibility would be a nice thing but all we are concerned with is a
solid platform (Good OS, Powerful processor, flexable graphics and Amiga's
history of determination).

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards :

Well ideally a move to 3rd party gfx cards would allow for continual
updating with current technology. GFX chipsets should be easily replaced and
not set as a standard such as AGA or ECS were.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga :

Yes :).

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be :

Well a fast 24bit mode would be nice.

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future:

Low end Amiga's should be a small step below high end Amiga's. They can go
without math co-processors and the fastest processor if structurally they
run exactly the same as their older siblings... and they can still be
expanded to full potental. Lack of expandability is a major draw back.
People enter a market low and if they want they should be able to climb to
the top. Poor designs (such as a virtually unexpandable A600) prevent users
from continuing with Amiga.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion :

Emulation of 680x0 for a while with an exentual move to 100% new systems.
AmigaDos with the needed upgrades (without losing the Amiga feel.. ease of
use and friendly enviroment).

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

Depends on the ease of supporting both. If i were not possible hopefully
there would be an equal and cheap solution (similar mode to CyberGraphX for
the new standard gfx).

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

I don't think AGA or ECS comptibility are required if we push for
retargetable gfx... this way the newer and older systems can take advantage
of whatever hardware is available.

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

We would love to be notified of AT's intentions and we are willing to help
use our products to push the Amiga back to a position of power in the
computing community.

*******************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

Yes, and I will not hesitate to create products which REQUIRE a high-end Amiga.

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Yes.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Yes.

* Will you do commercial projects ?

Working on one at the moment.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD projects ?

Yes (FastView)

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes, although I wouldn't mind if some of the philopsophy of PC clones would be
adopted.  (Everything on a card and as little as possible standard stuff on the
motherboard).

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene :

No.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) :

Not really, we've formed a group named Fusion but we haven't released anything
yet.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Hobbyist.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Only FastView and TextDemo 5.7.  I also wrote the xpkSQSH.library

* Will you support other platforms? Which ?

Not sure, if possible I would like to keep my products Amiga only.  However
porting some of my stuff to the BeBox has crossed my mind, but that really
depends on how well AT is doing and how fast the PowerAmiga's will be
available.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Unknown at the moment, it also depends on what product we're talking about
here.  FastView for example will never have Graffiti support.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

Unknown. 

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

Yes, especially since AT seems willing to adopt this standard.

* Will you support EGS ?

Not directly, only thru somekind of layer (CyberGfx, rtgmaster.library or
built-in OS RTG).

* Will you support Picasso II ?

See EGS

* Will you support the Draco ?

That depends, I haven't had a good look at the Draco up until now.
(Comment from the author of that list : With CyberGraphX you automatically
support DraCo... at least for graphics...)

* Will you support Retina ?

See EGS

* Will you support Merlin ?

See EGS

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

See EGS

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

Very likely :)

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Of course.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Be my guest.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

That would be nice, I hope they will give developer support via the Internet.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Depends on the situation at AT, up until now they seem to have made the right
decisions.  However if the PowerAmiga is just another rerun of old Amiga
technology or has serious flaws which are likely to lead to similiar problems
we are experiencing now with our current Amiga's then I might just consider
buying another platform (although that doesn't mean I will never sell my
Amiga).  Serious flaws would include: Hardware 040 support, forcing AGA
compatibity, using custom PPC chips, not having PCI slots, having new-gfx chips
(if they will be available) on the motherboard without the option to upgrade
them, etcetera...  I doubt AT will make any of these mistakes though as they
seem totally ridiculous to me.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

Not at the moment, I'm very busy as it is.

* Will you support ECS?

Yes, for now, once the PowerAmiga's arrive however I will not support ECS
anymore to encourage Amiga users to upgrade.  Stuff specifically aimed at PPC
machines won't run on old Amiga's anyway so I see no problems with this.

* Will you support AGA?

See above.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

That would be preferable, but I can see that this is going to be very hard,
especially if the new PowerAmiga's break away from the old Amiga stuff (and I
sincerely hope they will).  I hope the PowerUp boards will PCI graphics
optionally or included as otherwise having a PPC chip limited by AGA and
ChipRAM speed would be quite stupid.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

GFX Boards definately.  Custom Chipsets will often be 'standard' and hardware
which is 'standard' on all Amiga's will often be accessed directly by Games and
Demos.  This must be avoided at all costs, so I'm a bit sceptical when it comes
to Custom Chipsets specifically designed to enhance the Amiga.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

PCI has to be provided with the new PowerAmiga's, if not I seriously doubt
PowerAmiga's can be a success.  PCI support on PPC accelerator cards would be a
big plus.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

Similair to the clones at minimum, including the PCI bus and having a PCI
graphics card installed standard in all new Amiga's would be preferable.  The
user should be allowed the option though to use different PCI cards and/or not
having a PCI card installed but buying one themselves.  Preferably the system
should not be able to run without a gfx-card installed (so NO standard gfx
chipset PLEASE!!)

* What do you think the low end for Amigas should be in the future ?

I would prefer not to have a low-end at all, but if they must have a low-end
then make sure it is fully capable of being extended to high-end level (to
avoid Games to be targetted only at the low-end).  That means the low-end
should come in a tower-case, or provisions should be made to put a low-end
motherboard in such a case without any hacks.  The low-end however MUST make
use of PCI gfx's and should avoid a standard chipset at all costs.  The lowend
should atleast have a PPC601/66 and PCI graphics.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

Preferably with 680x0 emulation, keep in mind that 680x0 emulation on a 604/100
can reach speeds of a 68040 clocked at 40-50 MHz which should be enough to keep
even the power-users happy for a while.  The OS should be heavily extended to
include mem-protection, virtual memory, better GUI and built-in GUI layout
library.  It should also be able to use multiple processors ala BeBox, as PPC
chips are very cheap it would be a shame not to take advantage of multiple PPC
chips.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

I couldn't care less if new Amiga's are incompatible with the old ones, as long
as the new Amiga's are future-minded and aren't limited or held back by either
CPU power, standard gfx-chips or unprofessional OS.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

 priorities:
 - getting rid of AGA and any other standard hardware and provide
   decent OS layers to access any of the new hardware.  Don't ever let
   Programmers get the idea that a specific piece of hardware is gonna
   be standard in all Amiga's, also don't ever allow them to access
   the hardware directly.  All Gfx-output should go via a gfx-card, not
   via a standard gfx-chipset.
 - adding PCI slots, if -really- needed in combination with Z-III or
   Z-II slots.
 - raise the standard of the low-end and raise the price accordingly.
   I'd rather see a low-end be $1000 and come in a MiniTower box an the
   potential to become as good as the high-end than seeing a $500 low-end
   machine which cannot be decently upgraded and misses some of the bare
   essentials to also use it as a productivity machine (this includes PCI,
   CD-ROM, IDE or SCSI).

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

I think I made my point quite clear :-)

All of 'em given the chance.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

Certainly.

Probably exclusively.

* Will you support EGS :

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
 direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a

I'd like direct access to VRAM if possible, but I'd rather leave double
buffering/Vram location to OS or library.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 :

Sure thing.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 :

Silly question.

As long as it keeps up with us.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them

They can try.

* Will you support ECS :

Yes.

* Will you support AGA :

Yo.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
 completely compatible :

As long as one doesn't hold the other back...I'd rather see the 2 working
together on the same thing.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards :

Custom chipsets. I want the Amiga to remain as cheap as possible - kind of
like a PSX with a keyboard and the basic Amiga I/O. Surely replacing 3 cards
for gfx/sound/IO with a couple of ASICs is cheaper?

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga :

If it's affordable to the user.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be :

Chunky pixels - 8/16/32 bit - palette look up or RGB. A 16 bit mode with a
byte for colour and a byte for intensity (please, please, please!).

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future:

A one PPC system with new custom chipset - upgradable to several PPCs. Bring
back parallel processing!

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion :

Start by rewriting AmigaDos 1.2 functions (not many of them) in house to get
a functional system going, then fire it out to developers who can add the rest.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

Depends on which is better.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
 ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Low price + PCI bus. Or is that an oxymoron?

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

New chipset please. Stick with A1200 casing design, but paint it black and
put the expansion slot out back so a 'box full' of slots can be added via a
cable. KEEP IT CHEAP!

**************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

Already do to some extent.

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Any future Amiga product will support the Cybergfx library, as long
as I can get my hands on an A4000 that is not way overpriced that is.
GFX boards and the A4000 is 2-3 times the price they should be.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

As long as At do a good job of the PPC Amiga, and of porting exec,
then of course :)

* Will you do commercial projects ?

Yes

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD prohects ?

Unlikely, but not impossible.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes and no! Yes I am, and I really hate the PC. And no, because I
won`t stay working on the Amiga if I can`t see a bright future for
myself financially because of the Amiga`s problems. I have to make a
living! At the moment exactly what we do in the new year depends on
how AT deal with developers getting PPC boards.

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

Used to, in a lamer kind of way :)

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

Yep - our own - Silltunna Software. We are currently releasing
software under the well known Black Magic label, and we hope this
partnership will continue.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Professional .....now :)

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Just about to (Xmas 95)

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

PC & PS-X most likely, but it all depends on the Power Amiga.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

No

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

If we did a suitable game then yes - Gloom already does :)

* Will you support CyberGraphX :

Yes.

* Will you support rtgmaster.library :

Possibly

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions
  for games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

3D functions are difficult - there are always specific optimisations
that can be made. But if the routines are really very very good then
yes. Direct access to Video Ram I really feel is a must.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and
  Phase 5 ?

Of course. Currently I know of hardware developers who have gotton no
help from AT and this is not right. They simply want to know a couple
of things, and they have reversed engineered almost everything. But
everyone seems to busy to bother because they are understaffed. This
is not right, and could be more widespread, I do not know. I am very
disappointed with this. Also, good things are not thought of a
certain person at AT in the UK. This part of the old C= is still
hardly any better for the majority of us.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Hopefully.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff
  for them ?

Absolutely. We will do original products, conversions of major games,
and so on.

* Will you support ECS ?

No

* Will you support AGA ?

Yes

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Phase5 Power PC systems? Do you mean their upgrades? If so, then yes,
they *must* be.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

Gfx boards of some sort, but not quite like on the PC where everyone
has different ones. I would rather have 1-2 depending how `high-end`
you go, and release a new `set` of gfx boards when needed. 3D
hardware is needed - there are 2-3 systems about to be released on
the PC that could/should be used.  The current problem is that AGA
chipset is not easily upgradeable in 95% of Amigas, and as for chip
ram!

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

Yes - go for the future rather than the present. Afterall, that was
what the Amiga was all about.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

All I can say is *good* with 3d hardware support, and for cost
reasons the lower end must support TVs and doesn`t need some of the
higher resolution options. Should be upgradeable though.

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

See above. Must have a CD-ROM. Stops a lot of `small town` piracy.
Should have an HD, should use HD(not DD) disks at least. It depends
if you want an Amiga console or not.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

All code native in PPC, improve all memory and resource
protection/tracking. Full network support.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support
  both?

Not sure. Depends on the situation.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA
  compatibility? ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Low Price. If the PPC was handled right then developers would be able
to get things out for the machine. But maybe you can add AGA compat
for an extra 100 quid or something. Fast bus - low-end and high-end
can be slightly different.

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

AT should give support to every half decent developer out there. That
means getting staff in to deal with us. That means money. But the
return would be worthwhile.

Somewhere between. We are a grpoup of four people now. Up to now we worked
more like hobbyists, but therefore that all of us study computer sciences
and we want to work together in future we *will* work professional.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

I did some commercial work before, but nothing major.

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

Maybe. If we do, most probably PowerMac.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

We do at this time.

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

Code is inserted. If we, as we should some weeks ago, get the package,
we could get the code running :-(

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

Yes.

* Will you support EGS ?

Yes. :-)

* Will you support Picasso II ?

Yes.

* Will you support the Draco ?

No.

* Will you support Retina ?

Maybe.

* Will you support Merlin ?

No.

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

No.

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

No. Not at this time.

Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Yes, of course, but only, of the system is professionally planned and
supported by AT just like QuickDraw 3D of Apple. It *has* to be a
professional and professional supported 3D system.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

YES!!! *VERY INTERESTED!!*

* Will you support ECS ?

Now we do, in future not for sure.

* Will you support AGA ?

At this time we do ...

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
completely compatible ?

Of course, they *must* be completely compatible. If there will be
compatibility using any future RTG standard, it doesn't matter, but
I have got enough of programming for different gfx boards with completely
different concepts. My gfx subsystem in my game stole me a lot of time ...

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

NO CUSTOM CHIPS!
If anyone wants to know why, I can write a detailled answer ...
Use standard bus systems, like PCI or anything else, but NO custom
chips anymore! Please consider, why Apple uses a PCI bus with standard
gfx boards in PowerMacs!

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

It is *absolutely* necessary to use faster busses. PCI maybe.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

A RTG system, that is fully transparent to the graphics.library.
I have not especially thought how it should be built ...

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

---

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

Like Apple did it. Try to rewrite most of the OS in native code.
Add a memory protection system.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

I can't tell at this time, but I think I would support Power Amiga, if
that should happen. But I don't think that this will happen.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Low Price.
PCI.

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

I can just say the same like Steffen Haeuser :-) with following addition:
The Future Amiga needs Memory Protection. That would IMHO prevent badly
coded software that crashes from time to time without a cause (I have enough
of that :-(( ). And, it will help programmers/software developers.
A universal Gfx system, where Gfx boards can easily be installed and used
like std output.

*** Comments about currently running projects :

***  Underware Design, presently has two major projects on the desk top, so to
***  speak.


***  a) Reality 3D,

***     Reality 3D, is actually the base first person 3d technology behind a
***     still undefined game project. Basically it's a hybrid of ID softwares
***     popular Wolf 3D / Balde Stone engine technologies, while also
***     introducing some new features to this engine standard.


***  b) Metal Combat, (pet name)

***     Metal Combat, is the basis for a virtua figther styled beat'em up
***     engine. At this point the 3d rendering system is still early in it's
***     development.


***  Underware Design, is a collection of young Amiga die hards based in
***  Australia... (ie. Down under ;)

****************************************************************************

* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

Yes

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Yes

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Yes

* Will you do commercial projects ?

Yes

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD prohects ?

Probably as time goes we'll do even less PD/shareware
stuff than we do now.. (which isn't much....)

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes, Absolutely


* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

No

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

Not formally, but at this very time we are trying to
get "Underware Design" into a position to turn
professional.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

At this point Hobbyist.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Major No, although i did write a fairly popular
shareware shootem up called "Thesius XII".


* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

Unfortunately, i doubt we'll be able to survive
at this time, completely based around the Amiga.

Obviously our main other interest will be the PC.
Now having said that, we won't actually be
designing projects for the PC, just Amiga.


* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Yes

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

No

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

Yes

* Will you support EGS ?

Yes

* Will you support Picasso II ?

Probably/Yes

* Will you support the Draco ?

No, well that is too say we won't be designing projects that require
the Draco System, but we will try and make sure our projects are
draco friendly were possible.

* Will you support Retina ?

Possibly, would need dev info & test Hardware.

* Will you support Merlin ?

Same as Above

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

Same as Above

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

Yes

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Yes, Personally i believe for the Amiga to push forward somewhat in terms
of 3D, we'll need to focus less upon our unique 3d technologies and more
upon standized (off the shelf) systems. hence, allowing for quick
development of a range of products.

The PC world is a classic example of this, developers can simply select
which 3d technology they'd like to use license it and then their away,
no drawn out initial development times and no hence no or less loss
of developer focus.


* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?


Yes, I would hope they both offer actual Game Developer support also,
be it, coming to grips with RTG systems 3D systems etc etc.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes, well as long as it stay viable.. Personally we'll have a much
better picture about this in another 2-3 months , ie after X-mas.
(amiga's have only just started to go on sale here in australia)


* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

Absolutely..

* Will you support ECS ?

No, well thats not entirely true. If we develop projects in the future
that are able to run on the native ECD chipset without any great loss
in GFX quality or performance, then we'll port it, otherwise no.

* Will you support AGA ?

Yes.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Yes, personally this is an absolute must, as this will create a sence
of conflict within amiga ranks... Ie. what machine or version OS to
run ...

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

In what regards ?, for 3D styled environments I don't see a great
deal of use in custom hardware,(there is some) so in this situation a
dumb frame buffer styled videocard would probably suit best.


* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

Yes

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

Hmmm, personally i like commodores first plans for the infamous AAA
spec's, although now i don't believe that those chips could cut it
as well as the currect and next wave of PC video hardware (speed
wise), but i'd like to see the next logical progression of the
AAA chipset ideal..

Features i'd like to see included, would obviously be a MUCH MUCH
faster blitter, which has true polygon ability, even texture mapping
ability. etc etc

Or perhaps the simplest route would be to include a 3rd party 3d
chip such as the  'Glint' sx by reality labs ( i think ;)

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future:

AGA+  (commodore's infamous half way chipset, basically AGA +
       inbuilt chunky pixel screen modes)

      If this doesn't prove to be viable, I'd like to see
      something like the 'graffiti' card be included !

      040 25mhz Or at LEAST 50mhz 030ec

      2meg chip + at least 2 megs 32bit fastram

      Inbuilt double speed CDron with an expansion for MPEG.


* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

  I've honestly no idea, I'd assume the quicker PPC based amiga's
  can be on show, the better this will be for the systems overall
  comeback. Hence, i guess i'm saying that even if the say 80% of
  of the OS is still native 680x0 running via 68k emulation, we at
  least these can then be shipped in some shape or form..

  Actually, if the Phase 5 are able to built A1200 suited ppc603e's
  at say 75mhz or above at a good enought price, well i'd assume
  that even while the machines is running 95-99% native 680x0 os
  and app's/entertinament the speed increase will still be quite
  impressive.. just in the short term...

  Many those users could register there card with phase five/amiga tech
  and get monthly -> bi monthly system software up grades at a
  small fee.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

  Well, I believe we have no option, we'll simply have to support
  both. The last thing i won't too see happen is this turning into
  a battle against compatibility... Ie. PC's ;)

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

  Low price is unfortunately a Must..

  I'd rather PCI, as then it should allow us to cash in on the
  expanding 3rd party PCI hardware market.

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

  Well i'd just like to state, that we as developers need to open up
  more, give more support to each other and Amiga Tech, with the final
  goal being hopefully the rebirth of the Amiga Games Industry. (it's not
  dead, but it's not well either...)

****************************************************************************

*  Will you support high-end Amigas ?

I am trying to support *all* Amigas from A500 to A4000/060 if it is
possible.

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Well, it depends. I am going to utilize rtg.library to maintain gfx board
compatibility if it appears necessary. Also I have heard of Graffiti
chunky card and one other (sorry, but I don't think I have crossed the
name of it yet) card.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

I can not say, because I do not know what PPC Amigas will be like -
hopefully yes - possibly not.

* Will you do commercial projects ?

Well, I am more into PD, really.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD prohects ?

_yes_! ;)

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Well, I consider myself as Amiga Freak still not directly hating PCs and
what could be crosslinked with that. Mostly yes however ;)

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

Not really. I am a lone wolf ;)

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

No.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Hobbyist.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Well, DamageWolf2.0 has been released and I have got some nice reception
from it.

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

...etc. Let's say I am multisupportive ;)  About gfx+rtgmaster my answer
is supportive.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Well, it is.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

If there is any use of it, yes.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes, definitely!

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?


I am not dead keen to commercial software and I am also not coding for
free (for companies) so probably not.

* Will you support ECS ?

Yes, I own OCS/ECS only machine.

* Will you support AGA ?

As long as it is possible with humane effort. I can not see the AGA of
course so I _have_ certain problems.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Compatibility rules.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

GFX Boards are better for compatibility. Depends on fast processors
and rtg - or similar systems - general support of course.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

Yep. The faster the better ;)

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

AGA++ ;)  Just this AGA looks fantastical enough but chunky is really needed!

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future?

Very turbo-boosted ;)   Perhaps this question deals with what is the
low-level Amiga standard in the future - my answer is A1200+Fast.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

No switch, AmigaDOS rules ;)  Well, I really don't know - perhaps
multiprocessor machines or something to maintain support for both. I
understand this is very difficult solution however. The PowerPC should
have 68040+FPU emulation I think.

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

Well, I would primarly support the one I had. Most likely I would try to
support the both of them.

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

I do not want fast+crudy solutions so I would be prepared to pay a little
more for a better machine.

* Will you support Merlin :

No.

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board :

No.

* Will you support rtgmaster.library :

Maybe.
What I want is:
- support for as much gfx-boards as possible
- get lowlevel-access through this library
- or at least get high-speed routines for
copying/filling/double-buffering/scrolling/...

direct gfx-board-memory access would be great

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) :

Yes, definitly!
(Although 3D-functions are not very important. The important thing is fast
and OS-compliant access to the gfx-baords memory.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 :

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 :

Yes.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future :

Yes.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them:

Yes, feel free to ask.

* Will you support ECS :

I'm writing os-compatible games. Most of my games are supporting different
kinds of gfx-sets. This means that you can play the game in 32 colors as
well as in 256 colors. So the answer is: Yes, although the games will be
faster on AGA/gfx-boards.

* Will you support AGA :

see ECS.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible :

As far as I know the phase5 PPC will become the new PowerAmiga.
If not: Yes.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards :

Gfx-Boards definitly. They are fast and they are cheap (because of the
cheap SuperVGA chips). New custom chips (like AAA)
1) would be too expensive
2) would take too much time to develope
3) can't compete with current PC-gfx-chips

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga :

Yes.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be :

CyberGfx.

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future:

future low-end Amigas should look like the old A4000/030 with new gfx-chips:

desktop-Amiga
68030/25 (or faster)
2MB chip/2MB fast
cheap gfx-baord instead of slow AGA chipset

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion :

Make it possible for old Amiga-Users to upgrade their Amigas
(like PPC-boards for A3000/4000)

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

This should not happen.
We don't need another gfx-standard (ECS/AGA/gfx-boards is already too much)

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

forget AGA-compatibilly!
The only thing you loose with AGA-incompatibility is games!
But you will gain a lot of speed, a lower price and lots of gfx-power to
compete with PC/Mac.

I consider this the most important issue.

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?)

To AT: *Don't* develop gfx-chips on your own, we *don't* need AGA-compatibility!
Use standard gfx-boards instead!

****************************************************************************


* Will you support high-end Amigas ?

Yes, if I someday can buy one. Currently high-end Amiga (A4000/40+) are
really too expensive. At the moment I've A1200+Blizzard'030 (50mhz).

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Not yet, because I have very little information about the cards (I know
they can be somehow programmed via the libraries) and I don't have one.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future :

Hard to say yet. 

* Will you do commercial projects ?

Sure.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD projects ?

I've realeased some pd games, and I'm working on 3 shareware games at the
moment.

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes, I definitely am an "Amiga Freak"... Amiga rules! 8-)

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

I've written 2 demos, but I don't feel belonging to the scene yet.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

No, thought we have a six member group of coders & graphicians.

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Something in the between. I'm looking for companies which could release
my games in the future.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Depends, what you mean by "major" stuff. If you mean commercial then no.

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

I don't want to! But if the situation of Amiga's don't get better in the
future (that's about after 2-3 years), I see no other option.

*  Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

Maybe. It seems to be an interesting thing. 

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

Why not? 8-) Would be fun for wolf style shoot'em ups and 3d adventures.

* Will you support CyberGraphX ?

Don't know yet.

* Will you support EGS ?

same as above.

* Will you support Picasso II ?

same as above.

* Will you support the Draco ?
I think not. (little hint from me: If you support CyberGraphX, you automatically
support DraCo too... :) )

*  Will you support Retina ?

Don't know.

* Will you support Merlin ?

Don't know.

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

It's hard to say.

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

I'm not a OS coder, but maybe if it's fast.

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Yes but only for gfx cards coding, with the current cpus and chipset it's 
too slow.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Of course!

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes, as long as Amiga is the best machine in the world!


* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

YES!

* Will you support ECS ?

I don't think so. ECS is history

* Will you support AGA ?

Yes.

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Compability is nowadays really important, so yes.

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

Definitely gfx boards. Fixed chipset always get old.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

Yes.

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

Resolutions 320*256 to 1600*1200 with 2 colors to 16.7 millions colors 
with every screen mode. And no interlace! A real truecolor mode to
all modes! 8-16 megabytes of chip memory. 32-bit blitter. 32-bit copper.
I know this is going to cost much, but other models (PCs, Macs) 
have 'em already. 

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future?

25 mhz 68040, 2+4 megs memory, no compact (a500&a1200) models at all.

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

PowerPC's should be 100% AmigaDOS compatible but I know that's
not realistic. (Comment from the author of this list : According to what
i know, you ARE realistic with that...)

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

I would consider it an end to this all. That kind of machine would not
be an amiga anymore. I'm not asking for 100% compatibility (which would
be nice) but that most OS friendly software would run ok... and faster!

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

Faster CPU's and chipset to every model! Don't put the graphic chips
on the board but insert a gfx card which can be replaced anytime!
Low price is important too to get new users and get people more optimistic
about the future of Amiga's.

I think that expansion boards with PowerPC for current Amigas are a good
idea. A shareware or cheap commercial C compiler and assembler for
PowerPC should be available as soon as possible.

  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

Power Amiga chipsets

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?

Use current AGA chips in future Amigas for compatibility, but do not support
AGA in new code. I think it would be very hard to make RTG work with AGA
chipset.

Drop Zorro III and support PCI.

Could this be the nice library?

* Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
  games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
  direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
  new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Yup, direct vram access definitely - 3D functions would be nice, but
most would be specific to the game/demo I would think.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Nop, I like the crap support ;)

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

As long as it supports me

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them

Yup, although I'd like to finish my game before I take on anything else...

* Will you support ECS ?

As long as there is demand

* Will you support AGA ?

Yes

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?

Of course

* Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

Tricky one - I can't see AT developing a new GFX chip when they could
just use SVGA ones, and I can't see them doing low end machines with
slots, so I have a nasty feeling we will see cheap Amigas with SVGA
chips and maybe AGA for backward compatibility on the motherboard. The
trick will be to not let these become a standard for hardware bangers
by having CyberGraphX support, and hopefully a mid range Amiga that
has PCI slots and takes GFX cards. This would hopefully be cheap enough
for a 50/50 split between low and mid range Amigas, so the higher market
cannot be ignored.

* Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

Yup, with a connector to optional "slot box" in low end Amigas

* What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

I think CyberGraphX sounds good, but to be honest I don't have experience
of it myself so can't really comment at the moment - As long as I can get
direct access to the screen's memory I'm happy...

* What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?

I think the low end should stay cheap as this is a very significant part
of the Amiga market, but it should be more expandable, and there should
be a mid range machine, not significantly more expensive. The present
situation where there is a choice between 400 A1200, and 2000+ A4000 is
crazy.

In the immediate future the low-end should be 040 based or fast 030 at a
push, and fast-mem is a necessity (even software switchable between 2meg
chip / 1m chip& 1m fast would be ok). Case needs redesigning to take 3.5
inch hard disks, and a hard disk should be supplied (although this should
be done by the dealer so you have greater choice of size).

Then we need to go PowerPC crazy as soon as possible...

* How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

As quick as possible - get the bare necessity of AmigaDOS & emulation
ported, and do the rest later...

* What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
  chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?

Depends which has the biggest market share - maybe both, or I'm sure
CyberGraphX would soon support the new chipset...

* Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
  ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

I think AGA can probably go - It's not as if there is stacks of stuff for it,
and it should only be games that have problems. Most current games have/will
be upgraded if there is still demand for them. eg Gloom Deluxe, AB3DSE etc

Probably same with ZIII - I should think most cards are for gfx, and it
would probably be cheaper to get a PCI one, and those with emplant can move
to Shapeshifter (PowerMac emulation? ;)

* Any comments of your own (1 or 2 lines?) or 8?

AT - Make sure you support developers, and let them know what is going on
and what is coming so there is software for new machines when they appear.
I'm sure the likes of Team17 would be a lot more emphusiastic if they had
been contacted directly much sooner...

Other than that they seem to be heading in the right direction and saying
the right things when they do talk... At least there is a future to look
forward to now , which is more than there was a year ago :) Oh and spread
the word - don't just rely on the users like CBM did.

Yes, of course, but no highend-only.

* Will you support GFX Boards in your code ?

Maybe through a library.

* Will you support Power PC Amigas in your code in the future ?

Yes. I can already code PowerPC assembler. I hope people there
will be a few compilers soon after PowerAmiga's release.

* Will you do commercial projects ?

I do not know how the state of my company will be in a year, but I
suppose we will make native code for PowerAmiga.

* Will you do Shareware and/or PD projects ?

Yes

* Do you consider yourself an "Amiga Freak". Amiga only and that stuff ?

Yes

* Do you consider yourself belonging to the demo scene ?

Yes. My handle: Misagn/Eternal.

* Do you belong to a software firm (if yes, to which firm) ?

Yes. Obsession Development, http://www.canit.se/~ola/obsession

* Are you a professional game developper or a hobbyist ?

Hobbyist, as are most employees of Obsession Development originally.

* Did you already release major stuff ?

Not yet. I am co-working with some people on a few projects.

* Will you support other platforms? If yes, Which ?

We want to make games for Sony PlayStation-X, and maybe PC.
But we will not stop using the Amiga as our main development platform.

* Will you support the Graffiti Board ?

No

* Will you support I-Glasses ?

Maybe. If we will make a 3D game for Amiga, we will.

Maybe

No

* Will you support Retina ?

No (Comment from the author of this list : The same as to the DraCo...)

* Will you support A2410 GFX Board ?

No (Comment from the author of this list : The same as to the DraCo...)

* Will you support rtgmaster.library ?

Maybe. If we will make a 3D game for Amiga, we will.

*  Would you be interested in a library system supporting 3D functions for
   games/demos as to graphics board support and low level support like
   direct access to video RAM (anyways if it is rtgmaster.library or a
   new version of CyberGraphX) ?

Yes. It would be the best choice at the moment. But i hope
Amiga Technologies will come up with _true_ RTG truly integrated into
the Amiga system, and better support for fast graphics on Amiga.
That would be a better choice.

* Is it okay for you to give your answers to Amiga Tech. and Phase 5 ?

Yes. I would really like them to know my opinions.

* Do you want a great developper support system by Amiga Tech. and Phase 5?

Yes. I would like to be informed of any development in OS and hardware.

* Will you continue supporting Amiga in the future ?

Yes. If my company doesn't, I will still make PD stuff.

* Would you be interested in companies asking you to do Amiga stuff for them ?

Yes, I would.

* Will you support ECS ?
No, not for games.
 
* Will you support AGA ?
Yes

* Would you want Amiga Tech systems and Phase 5 Power PC systems being
  completely compatible ?
   
   Yes, I want them to be compatible with eachother, of course =3D)
   Compatibility should be retained for existing OS-compliant programs,
   but not for games/demos using the hardware directly.

   The problem with the Amiga system and games now, as I see it,
   is that there is bad support for good use of the hardware in the OS.
   That is why so many developers bang the hardware directly with the
   OS shut down.
   AT need to remake some of the functions in graphics.library for
   RTG and _speed_. With more support for double-buffered screens and
   bobs, chunky bitmaps and means of disabling OS functions legally.
   AT should also publish some good example code for developers
   to use as guidelines.

*  Do you want future Amigas using Custom Chipsets or GFX Boards ?

   In my opinion, it should be completelly RTG, whatever the gfx
   chips may be. I would of course really like to see the AAA and
   hombre chipsets in silicon.

*  Do you want the possibility of using faster busses to the Amiga ?

   Yes. I would prefer the PCI bus.

*  What do you think the Amiga Graphics standard should be ?

   It should be a RTG standard, with drivers.
   User applications should interface these drivers through
   graphics.library. Several pixelmodes should be standardized, which
   would make direct access to video memory possible.

*  What do you think should the low end for Amigas be in the future ?
   
   Minitower or pizzabox case. 2 PCI slots. CHRP
   Cheap PowerPC cpu or fast 680x0 in a slot. Should be possible to upgrade=
.
   2 70pin SIMM-slots. Filled with at least a 4Mb SIMM as standard.
   AAA single chipset on motherboard. 2Mb slotted DRAM.
   3.5" IDE Harddrive as standard. >400Mb.
   2Mb 3.5" diskdrive. Extra slot for second HD, CD-ROM etc.
   VGA port, Microphone input. Headphone output. Better mouse.

   AAA offers so much more than just graphics and audio.
   It has 2 highspeed serial ports, sound sampler, mouse controller
   and diskdrive controllers. If AAA would be situated on a PCI card,
   it would be impossible to remove it anyway.

*  How should the switch for AmigaDOS to PowerPC be in your opinion ?

   Since it's already such a big step, there is room to add
   more features into the system. Memory protection, realtime
   compression of virtual memory, etc..

   There will be some difficulties mixing a PowerPC core, and
   680x0 shared libraries. But it should be possible.
   PowerPC should call library functions through traps, which enables
   the system to start an emulator for the 680x0 libraries.

   I want AT to work with CEI with the emulator. I believe they
   already have made a very good emulator for Mac, and have at least
   made outlines of an Amiga emulator.
   Since 680x0 already has to be emulated anyway, some hardware
   registers could be emulated aswell. (mouse button for instance)

*  What will be your priorities if CyberGraphX and future Power Amiga
   chipsets would turn out incompatible? Or would you even support both?
   
   I strongly hope, that AT will go for RTG.
   If they wont, they would be sucking bigtime, and I would of course
   use CyberGraphX, and encourage its programmers to make drivers for
   PowerAmiga.

*  Some thoughts about what to give priority? Low price or AGA compatibility?
   ZIII Bus compatibility or Fast PCI Bus?

   Low price is most important.
   PCI bus is the way of the future.
   ZIII can possibly be emulated on PCI through a bridge.

He did not answer to my mail up to now, but what i know for sure :

- He is the coder of Breathless.
- He will support High-end Amigas.
- Up to now he won't support GFX Boards, but he is thinking over a
  special version for a spring release (AGA version : December),
  if i got it right.
- Amiga is not the only platform for that he is coding (PC the
  other, if i got it right).
- He does commercial games.

3. How to get on this list

As this is no real mailing list, no automatic SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE.
Simply give me the same information like the others gave me for this list.
My email is haeuser@tick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de

I will mail the latest version of this list to the people on the list
every few weeks or months (if you do not want this, tell me). I will
post it to the news and similar stuff too. And i will give the answers
i got to Amiga Technologies, Phase 5 and the developpers of CyberGraphX.

4. Next Amiga Texturemapping conference

The next Amiga Texturemapping conference will be on 1st December,
on irc channel #amitmap, 17:00 GMT

5. Open Questions

A. Attic Software is looking for a guy who could do the DSA III 3D Engine
   for an Amiga Version.

   Contact address :

   Attic Entertainment Software
   Mr. Hamma
   Sigmaringer Strasse 84
   D-72458 Albstadt

   If you want to do it using the net, you could contact (using FIDO)

   Wolfgang Schulz 2:246/8010.9

   He is not exactly the guy whom you will have to contact, he is only
   some guy working at Attic Software (but maybe he can give you an email
   to reach Mr. Hamma).

B. Many people need now developper support for future Amigas or want to
   know what is going on.

   Contact addresses at Amiga Technologies and Phase 5 for them :

   Amiga Technologies :

   gbo@amiga.de  (PR and announcement stuff)
   rudi@amiga.de (Developper support)

   Look at http://www.amiga.de too...

   Phase 5 :

   phase 5 digital products
   POWERUP-Programm
   In der Au 27
   D-61440 Oberursel
   Germany

   NOTE : You are able to order now :

   - Information about POWERUP
   - Information of the Powerup Developper Support Program
   - Information about the PowerUP Evaluation Boards for
     Developpers (shipping in January...)

   Phase 5 is interested in commercial, PD and Shareware
   developpers for PowerUP Boards *NOW*. And they work
   together with Amiga Technologies. So probably the
   Board will be at least mainly compatible with Power Amigas
   (at the Computer 95 they said "fully compatible", but
   they did not know up to then what Amiga Technologies
   is doing with the Graphics Hardware)

C. What is most urgent for demos/games on GFX Boards seems to
   be the low level support (direct access of the VRAM, Double Buffering,
   maybe scrolling... even more important than 3D stuff implemented !!!)
   It may even be a urgent thing if CyberGraphX/rtgmaster.library throw
   AGA out of business as to demos/games...

   So... if you are the manufacturer of a Graphics Board, the writer
   of graphics board drivers or something like that and you happen to know
   how to access the VGA chips of a certain Board DIRECTLY, please send
   me a mail (for rtgmaster.library...). The manufacturers that i was
   contacting up to now refused to tell me how to do this and i had
   to deal with the libraries (and mostly Double Buffering was not
   supported... :( ) Of course i know of MoveScreen and such things...
   but that is not the perfect solution... and it seems to me that some
   things (WB-Emulations, NetBSD drivers, Shapeshifter/Emplant drivers,
   Animation show programs) probably HAVE to access those VGA chips for
   DBuffering... or am i wrong ?

   And, for example for EGS Boards... if i asked them about the Board interna
   they REFUSED and simply sent me a EGS developper disk containing Autodocs
   for the egs.library (The manufacturer of the Piccolo Board was this :) )
   Probably there was some misunderstanding :(((

6. List of Coders/Graphicians/Musicians

List of Coders and official guys from software firms :

List of Graphicians :

- Alex Grasso

List of Musicians :

- No one, up to now ... :(

7. Some statistics :

(Not everybody gave absolutely clear answers to every question, mostly
on things that are not 100% to overlook up to now... so numbers may
differ as to different questions...) Note about that special handling
of TEAM 17 in these numbers... as Mr.Dyson said it is not sure, if Team 17
will stay with Amiga... if they stay, they will probably support a lot,
if not... nothing...

Sorry that i miscounted in the first release some times ... i hope this
numbers are correct now... but even if i miscounted one or two votes,
the tendency still will be correct... :) And sometimes there were answers
were it was difficult to say about how to interpret them (all that "Maybe"s,
or stuff like "Low price and AGA compatibility", what as far as i know is
a contradiction...

Number of Coders/guys of software firms :
(only those counted that replied the questions...)

24

Number of Graphicians :

1

Number of Musicians :

0

Number of coders supporting High-End :

20 (+ Team 17 unsure + 1 answer "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting Graphics Boards :

15 (+ 4 answers "Maybe")

Number of Coders interested in doing Power Amiga games/demos :

14 (+ Team 17 unsure + 7 others "Maybe")

Number of developpers interested in a much better developper
support system (or thinking support currently sucks...) :

22

Number of coders that will probably continue to support Amiga :

15 (+ Team 17 and 6 others depending on success of Amiga Technology, on
    developper support, on existing market or such things...)

Number of coders supporting Graffiti :

4 (+ Team 17 and 9 others "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting ECS :

13 (+ Team 17 + 2 others "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting AGA :

20 (+ Team 17 + 1 other "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting CyberGraphX (and NOT supporting it using rtgmaster.library) :

11 (+ Team 17 + 2 others "Maybe")

Number of coders supporting rtgmaster.library :

(Note: rtgmaster.library runs on an installed CyberGraphX system too... popularity
will probably depend on what CyberGraphX 3.0 will be able to do...)

9 (+ Team 17 + 7 others "Maybe")

Number of coders interested in 3D library functions :

18

Number of coders interested in Low Level library functions :

18

As to this stuff, mostly Direct Video access and Double/Triple Buffering
was considered a "must", and 3D functions would be great, but the most
urgent thing... these low-level things...

Future Amiga GfxBoard : Custom Chips :

17 : 8

Some people stated "Both". I counted this as vote for Amiga Gfx Boards
AND as vote for Custom Chips...

Is Compatibility between Power Amiga and PowerUP needed : not needed ?

21:2 (with some people indicating that it will be a hard job "that one
is not holding back the other and if it would be inpossible to do
current Zorro III systems 100% compatible with future PCI systems,
compatibility would not be the main issue... but most stated, compatibility
would be an issue that HAS to be at all cost...)

Faster Bus systems : Stay with Zorro III ?

20:2 (+2 "possibly","if it is affordable for the user")

I think, these numbers give something to think over...

Should future Amigas contain AGA : Contain NO AGA AT ALL (price issue...)

2 (AGA) : 19 (Scrap AGA)

As to Low price vs. AGA i counted an answer "Low price" as an indication
to count the answer as "Scrap AGA". To get the exact comments, read this
list :))) Some guys mentioned the possibility of an AGA (or maybe AAA ?)
PCI Board...

8. THE AMIGA THE GUYS ON THIS LIST WANT

I tried to read a bit "between the lines". Sometimes people said
different things... but the following is what most people want :) !!!
Of course i am not 100% objective, but i really tried only to count
numbers... PLEASE READ THIS VERY CAREFUL, AMIGA TECHNOLOGIES AND
PHASE 5 !!! Of course this is a dream and not everything may come this way...
but this is what coders *HOPE*...

This Amiga has a Power PC inside. It uses a Graphics Board (that
possibly has some 3D functions in hardware, possibly not). This Board
is connected with PCI to the system. There are Amigas with Power PC
603e and others with Power PC 604 around (and in 1997 maybe even faster
ones, using the Power PC 620 or what else is coming after the 604...)

On this Amiga runs an Amiga DOS in Power PC Native code (or at least
a partially ported Amiga DOS). There is a 68k Emulation available.

A "normal" Amiga with a PowerUP Power PC of Phase 5 and a CyberGraphics
Board is 100% compatible to this system (!!!), even as to what graphics goes.
CyberGraphics is a part of the OS. The system is no longer AGA compatible
to make it cheaper to build, but AGA is available on a PCI Board (with
drivers for CyberGraphics). Zorro III is available on some sort of
PCI Bridge Board, but it is no longer built into the system by Default.

As to games, all games are playable on a ECS+PowerUP+CyberGraphics
system. Of course, maybe an old graphics Board will slow things down.
Also, a Zorro II only system will slow things down (but maybe there
will be a board with direct connection to the PowerUP ?)
The Graphics Board that comes with the official Power Amiga is very
fast. And its CyberGraphics drivers are very good optimized. There
is no longer an "A1200 style model".

There are 3D supporting Boards available, and the latest version of
CyberGraphX supports a very easy to use interface for Double/Triplebuffering,
scrolling, sprites, direct access to the VRAM (or maybe CyberGraphX
has swallowed up rtgmaster.library and included it to the system...
here my crystal ball to see to the future is a bit foggy... :) )
This code directly accesses the registers of the VGA chips, but it
provides a standard interface for doing this... this library is
what demo/gamecoders appreciate the MOST of all this phantastic
new CyberGraphX release... :) CyberGraphX comes with every Amiga...

There is a standard library collection for 3D effects, sound and
picture loading and such stuff... some nice highlevel functions and
all that... partially this library is done by former members of
the Demo scene, who provided their own private code for it...

At Amiga Technologies there are several guys doing Developper-Support
stuff, and there are printed manuals and documentation of the Amiga
DOS 4.0 available with Autodocs, Includes and explanations.

It is possible to reach the Developper-Support, using email, Compuserve,
FAX and Phone (FAX and Phone at least reachable in Germany, where Amiga
Technology is sitting).

9. How to get more info about Graphics Boards...

In the same lha as this file there is a readme "Graph.txt" giving more
information about Graphics Boards, including emails of the guys to contact
to get developper information...
