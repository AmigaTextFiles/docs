Great. Andrew Crowe just spilt a whole load of [just-amiga] Re: Breed96 on

I'll maybe give that a try. Unfortunately I have very little cash just now.

Hmm, looks good, and not a million miles away from a game I was hoping to
do. Mine will probably be a lot simpler though, and as opposed to Civ,
it'll bear more resemblance to those Risk- type games, where your have a
basic map and you take over colonies and so on. So there shouldn't be any
competition- when do you hope to release Solar Conquest?


Sooner,

        Sandy, I really must get back into coding...

Did you mean like a web-based email site (hotmail, usa etc?)

If thats what you mean then you can use save source on most
web browsers then to remove the HTML code and all other
irrelevent things use the program HTTX that might be in your
C: or somewhere in the directory of your web-browser.

It'll make it easier to find the text you want and cut out
text you don't without having to fish through HTML code.

All I do is to highlight the text using my mouse which on Voyager
automatically put it into the clipboard.  I then open up my text editing
program such as ED, Wordworth or even YAM and then hold down RIGHT AMIGA KEY
and tap V.  This will paste the text into the document so you can save,
print or whatever. 

If this doesn't work highlight the text using my mouse, then hold down RIGHT AMIGA KEY
and tap C this copies it into the clipboard.  You then goto a text editing
program like ed, wordworth or something like that and then just paste using
RIGHT AMIGA KEY and tap V.

Hope that helps
Wayne

Subject: [just-amiga] NEW HARD DRIVE
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings,

I currently have a 850Mb hard drive inside my A1200 Tower and want to
upgrade to a bigger one, possibly 5-6Gb (maybe even bigger). I want to copy
the contents of my existing hard drive onto the new one. I have no backup
device to copy to and was wondering if there is a way to connect the 2 hard
drives into the tower to enable me to copy from one to the other. If there
is a better way of doing things please let me know that.

Cheers

Steve

Well, you can certainly install two of the 2.5" hard drives in an A1200 but the
cabling is difficult to find. The connections for the 2.5" drives is miniature
but can be found. I think I bought one from Redmond Cable once waaay back.
Waht you need is the ribbon cable and three connectors to hook up the
controller and the two drives. Simple as that. Make one drive the master and
the other the slave (via jumpers). Format and go. This is the simplest way to
do it with IDE only. You really need to consider getting some kind of backup
device. Much to much trouble if you have a crash trying to restore from
memory.

Regards

Just get a cable with 2 connectors on it (if you dont have already)
& connect the second IDE drive up as a SLAVE,  your 850Mb
would already be a MASTER..

Set it up & partition it with HDToolbox,  change the boot pri of your
existing 850Mb drive to  "1"   & set the new drive as bootable
with a bootpri of  "0",    this is so you can still auto boot from
your old drive until you remove it from the system.

Format the drive & then,  from a shell,  
type:   (without the quotes)  & insert the volume name
of the drive partition  instead of  my  substitute  *name:*
(No spaces in the drive names please)

"Copy   *850Mb*:   *NewBigDrive*:   ALL   CLONE"

When everything is copied across,  power down,  
remove your old drive,
change the links on the new drive as MASTER & power up...

Voila !!!

*PS:   Don't forget to set the MaxTransfer on all partitions*
*on the new drive to:  0x1FE00   (0x0001FE00)   first...*
**(Before the format & copy)

PPS:   You MUST use WB3.5 if you want to use a drive bigger 
           than  4 gig.    (or suitable 64 bit filesystem & patches)

           It is also mandatory to have your New DH0:  (boot partition)
           within the FIRST 4 gig of the drive & no bigger than 4 gig.

           The rest doesn't matter after you startup...

Of course, leaving your DH0:  on the 850Mb drive will overcome
any possible trouble with 64 bit compatibility.

As you have a tower, space shouldn't be a problem.
Leave both drives inside..
With using the whole 850Mb DH0:  I doubt if you will fill it up..

It might make life a bit easier too..

Subject: [just-amiga] File identifier
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Does anyone know of any software out there that will identify different file
types, especially pictures. I want to be able to identify what type of file
a certain pictures is without having to load it into PP etc. DirScanner
which I recently found on Aminet (I think) will search for files within a
directory for example, and then display the filetype using datatypes (I
guess). This is useful but not really what I want, plus its very crashy on
my machine. Hope I've explained properly...

Can anyone help???

There are two programs that might fit the bill. On AmiNet (of course) are
Whatis and GetType. Give them a try.

If you use Opus then get magnugopus from AA and AFCDs or Aminet. Link it to
Visage with info tooltype set and the picture will be shown with the size

dunno about the first two really (although at the moment they are much one
in the same thing).

MUI however, has excellent documentation contained within the actual archiv=
e
of the 'developers' kit.. this is available @

ftp:uk.aminet.net/pub/aminet/util/lib/MUI3.8_dev.lha

or something VERY similar to that, go help yourself ;)

Hi Tony
Try www.neko.u-net.com/computing/webfonts/
by Matt Sealey.
There is a downloadable tutorial on how to set up Truetype fonts in
web browsers.
Looks complicated but I did it so it can't be that bad.
Best of luck
Terry

Subject: [just-amiga] HTML and Truetype fonts
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings All...

Can anyone help me with a problem re: font reading in HTML files?

When  the  HTML  file is loaded into iBrowse, the fonts used are only
the system fonts. If I look at the file in a text editor, some of the
following are commonly used by the codes...

           arial - comicsans - impact - lucida - verdana

...plus  various others. I have these fonts on my system and can load
them into paint programs, and they show OK in my font prefs utility.

Why can't the HTML files find them and use them when the same file on
my friends PC (bite my tongue) shows them perfectly, fonts and all?

After  attempting to wade through the documentation from the ttffonts
guide,  I  am  none  the wiser as anything written re: truetype fonts
seems to be aimed at people much cleverer(?) than me.

What I gleaned from various dox and (conflicting) email answers about
installing  them  has  resulted in these fonts being recognised by my
system in general, but HTML files still stubbornly refuse to find and
use them.

I've made a dir named _TRUETYPE with the original xxx.ttf font files,
"ADD  ASSIGNED"  it  to  my  SYS:Fonts  dir,  ran  the ttfmanager and
generated  the  xxx.font and xxx.otag files, copied these to the root
of  my  fonts  dir, and as I said, my system recognises them, in many
sizes, but, alas, not HTML files.

After writing all the above, it's just occurred to me that I may have
to set these up in MUI, gawd, I hope not, as the mucking around I had
to  do  just to get iBrowse and other MUI app's to NOT use those ugly
Courier and Times serif fonts makes me shudder.

Any  help on the above, either with how the files in the TRUETYPE dir
should  be named (they have .ttf as a postfix) or just setting up the
darned things to work with HTML files, would be appreciated.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Hi, Tony.

On PC's and Mac's and such, the FONT.../FONT directive is what controls
the actual fonts that get used on a web page. As far as I know, however,
no Amiga browsers recognize the FONT.../FONT directive, but use their
own preferences settings, which likely do not change from page to page,
but are global in nature.

Does iBrowse actually support the font name tag?  Voyager does, and it makes a
big difference.

Look in preferences for a font mapping list.

Thanks for your answer, but did I not say I read the tutorial and
it did not help me a bit. HTML docs are not very handy as a tute
because I cant print them out, anyway, it would cost an arm and a
leg in ink and paper. You are definitely cleverer than me as I could
not make sense of half of it, despite having many years experience
in installing some very complicated utils etc. on my Amiga.

Regards... Tony

Ta Neil, but I'm afraid I have no idea what the abve question means.
Which preferences - MUI or iBrowse - and what the hech is a font 
name tag or a font mapping list?

Duhhh... fick ain't I?

To all others who read this, I'm 99% sure a mate had the correct
fonts showing on his A1200, unfortunately he's now in England.

Yes. IBrowse supports the FONT FACE tag. You must define all the faces for
it to use manually.

 TPP> Ta Neil, but I'm afraid I have no idea what the abve question means.

The fonts are defined on a webpage using a special HTML tag named "Font Name".
iBrowse may not support this tag.

It was recently added to Voyager though, there's a guide on v3.vapor.com to
using it.

iBrowse.  MUI only controls the interface preferences.  A font mapping list
(which isn't really necessary) allows you to remap (e.g.) Arial to Helvetica.

Or is he in Britain?  da da da dumm.  Only 15 miles away is England.  The
moment you cross the border, boom!  Violence erupts as skinhead youths taunt
you with football chants.

<reality check> erm.. anyway.  Was he using iBrowse or Voyager?

Subject: [just-amiga] TurboPrint 6
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I purchased TurboPrint over a year ago and have recently installed it onto
my machine after installing OS3.5. I have set up the prefs from memory as I
think I had it set up previously. Now when I select the print option in any
application, Opus, MultiView etc. my machine crashes with the following
guru: 

Error: 8000 0003 or 8000 0004
Task: 0135F340 or 0135CA18

After a reboot I get the same results. I know that version 6 is compatible
with OS3.5 so there should not be a problem. If anyone has a similar set-up
would it be possible to send me their prefs file? Or even better than that
can anyone resolve my problem.

Special Reserve e-mailed this announcement to me this morning. Thought
someone out there may be interested.

UPWIRE NEWS HEADLINES

Amiga Power!
The long forgotten Amiga system is to make a comeback.  A new Amiga games
machine is on its way - and it's likely to be some kind of handheld games
unit.  Third party manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway and IBM have
expressed an interest in the miniature Amiga handheld, while Amiga will
supply the badge and operating system.
http://UKgames.com

THE WIND-UP

Would you believe it?  The good old Amiga is making a comeback.  Will it
last in today's cutthroat world?  Who knows.  I for one will be checking it
out though, because the best games I ever played were played on classic
computers.  Are retro games the best, or am I just being an old stick in
the mud?  Do you remember the good old point and click games on the Amiga
and Atari ST?  Blimey, that takes me back.  Floppy disks and that.  Maybe
I'll go and dig mine out of the loft.  Seeya!

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga Power!
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Special Reserve e-mailed this announcement to me this morning. Thought
someone out there may be interested.

UPWIRE NEWS HEADLINES

Amiga Power!
The long forgotten Amiga system is to make a comeback.  A new Amiga games
machine is on its way - and it's likely to be some kind of handheld games
unit.  Third party manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway and IBM have
expressed an interest in the miniature Amiga handheld, while Amiga will
supply the badge and operating system.
http://UKgames.com

THE WIND-UP

Would you believe it?  The good old Amiga is making a comeback.  Will it
last in today's cutthroat world?  Who knows.  I for one will be checking it
out though, because the best games I ever played were played on classic
computers.  Are retro games the best, or am I just being an old stick in
the mud?  Do you remember the good old point and click games on the Amiga
and Atari ST?  Blimey, that takes me back.  Floppy disks and that.  Maybe
I'll go and dig mine out of the loft.  Seeya!

   They seem to be confusing the new AmigaNG with the PlayStation One,
new miniture version of the PSX. (the fact that they called it an
'Amiga One' seems to back this idea up...)

   True, a new amiga is on the way, but it's far from a game console.
Infact it isn't even a computer, it's a universal operation system
that'll run programs on any type of computer faster then windows
etc.

See ya :)

Well I do remember playing many on my A500 and A1000, but I even
remember that type on my old TI99/4a and on the AppleII+.  Oddly, I
never had a C64 or C128.  Many of the old Amiga games were C64
conversions, like Aztek Adventure.

Hello,

Have a member of our user group who has been trying to get an answer to this
question for some time to no avail.  Anyone who does this who can help?

Can you use a zip disk to transfer a file between a PC and an Amiga, I
thought I've done that before also, but have forgotten how.
Suggestions, Please.

Thanks,

Jim McFarland

I just read something in the news groups on that.  I think it can be
done, but that it requires the commercial CrossDos7, or PCTask and
copytoA, but maybe not.

You certainly can. IIRC the Zip is formatted as a PC then use Crossdos to
enable you to copy Amiga files. You may have to use Crossdos Gold to
recognise 'longwords' depending which windoze format you are using.

I do it all the time.  You need CrossDos, the commercial version would be
better than the lame-o OS version.  I think you also need a dos driver in
the devs directory.

I bought a Squirrel SCSI several years ago, and it came with drivers for
Amiga and PC Zips.  It installs a PZ1C driver in devs for the PC Zips. 
There are some files on Aminet that does the same thing, I think, but I've
never tried them.  There's also a guy that sells a Zip utility disk on ebay
for $12.  He claims it will recognize disk changes and works similar to how
it does in a PC.  Apparantly he's sold a lot of these and all his feedback
has been positive.

I have to boot with the Zip in the drive for it to be recognized.  Not a big
problem if you use the same disk all the time, but my system won't
recognize a disk change.

Regards,
Billy

If you just want to copy files across, I am having success with a null
modem cable and PC2Amiga.

I am also backing up by Amiga file's to the PC hard disk as I don't have a
zip or other.

Both of them spin like Mandy-baby, making everything they say open to

You can also use Fat95, which is available on aminet. It supports long
filenames.

You mean regular 3.1 or 3.5 crossdos can read zips and not just
floppies?

Subject: [just-amiga] HD trouble
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

When I subscribed to this list, I tried sending this message via the EGroups
web site, but never saw this message show up in the digest version...so I'm
sending again.  I am sorry in advance if I'm repeating myself, or if any of
it is considered "off topic."

I have an Amiga 1200 with an internal 2 gig drive.  Earlier this year it
refused to boot, with the 1200 just giving me the standard "please insert a
wb disk" animation.

The drive light blinks when you reboot or first turn the machine on.  And
HDToolBox does see the drive.

But nothing shows up.  When I boot from my WB 3.0 floppies, none of the HD
partitions come up at all.

I managed to purchase an identical HD and noticed that the specs that show
up on HDToolBox for the identical drive are different than the messed up
one.  In fact, HDToolBox totally misreads the messed up drive.

But even stranger is that the newer drive wasn't reading the specs correctly
either--at least not at first!!  I ended up running the HDSetup which does
the "automatic" installation of the drive, setting up two partitions.  When
I then later ran HDTooloBox it had the correct specs on the newer
drive...STRANGE!

However, I can't run HDSetUp on the messed up drive because that would erase
everything...

I have years of work on the drive that I stand to lose...and my backup I had
was missing a lot of files (long story!)  But years of original music,
sounds, art, animations stand to be lost.

I've toyed with some of the rigid disk block recovery programs such as
RDBRecover and RecoverRDB...but they run forever and ever and don't seem to
do anything (although, if I have it check just a few cylinders they do that
fine--as in
they check those, find nothing and stop.) If I have these programs check
some of the lower cylinders they seem to just run forever.

I've tried RDBSalv...but can't contact the author to register it.  I don't
know if it would help...but it sounds like the best bet.

I've had someone mention DiskSalv4..but can't find that version on Aminet.

I can be patient...I have been so far (I stopped messing with it earlier
this year
due to illness in family, death in family, and personal health problems.)
But I'm really wanting to recover the data.  I've ordered a Syquest EZ drive
with 10 carts...and am trying to find some sort of SCSI interface (hopefully
Squirrel) so that if I do find the data, I can immediately back it up. (Any
leads on a scsi interface would be greatly appreciated too!)

Any help would be appreciated....

Thanks!

Ed

I don't have a zip but from what I can gather the Crossdos version depends on
the version of windows you use to format the zip, IIRC for windows98 you need
Crossdos Gold, the commercial product. Personally I use a null modem cable &
PC2AM which works on my 486 albeit rather slowly.

 On Saturday July 22 2000, Laser Ed & Laser Thu-Van said to All:

 LELTV> I have an Amiga 1200 with an internal 2 gig drive.  Earlier this
 LELTV> year it refused to boot, with the 1200 just giving me the standard
 LELTV> "please insert a wb disk" animation.

 LELTV> The drive light blinks when you reboot or first turn the machine on.
 LELTV>  And HDToolBox does see the drive.

Is the drive spinning?  What does HDToolbox say about the partitions on the
drive?  Are they marked as "Auto-Mount" (filesystem->change) ?

 LELTV> But nothing shows up.  When I boot from my WB 3.0 floppies, none of
 LELTV> the HD partitions come up at all.

If you have recent backups of the data on the drive, try reformatting it.  If
not, don't do that - you might still be able to get it back.. :)

 LELTV> I managed to purchase an identical HD and noticed that the specs
 LELTV> that show up on HDToolBox for the identical drive are different than
 LELTV> the messed up one.  In fact, HDToolBox totally misreads the messed
 LELTV> up drive.

"Read Configuration" is incorrect?  Remember that not everything will be the
same even on identical drives; some settings are not related to the physical
attributes of the drive on modern mechanisms.

 LELTV> I've toyed with some of the rigid disk block recovery programs such
 LELTV> as RDBRecover and RecoverRDB...but they run forever and ever and
 LELTV> don't seem to do anything (although, if I have it check just a few
 LELTV> cylinders they do that fine--as in they check those, find nothing
 LELTV> and stop.) If I have these programs check some of the lower
 LELTV> cylinders they seem to just run forever.

No, they don't run forever - they /do/ run for hours though.  They're checking
every byte of the drive for the partition information.  If the drive is okay,
and the RDB *is* damaged (which is what your description of the problem
suggests) then run one of them on the drive, record *exactly* what they
output, then input that data into HDToolBox using *exactly* the same file
system data, etc.

These tools tell you where the partitions are on the disk; *IF* HDToolBox
can't see them then this is your best bet.  Messing with partitions can be an
easy way to corrupt/destroy your data!  Remember: if a partition shows up with
an odd disk name, do not format!  Don't even quick format.  Pray you didn't
overwrite any data, and check your numbers again - when the RDB aligns with
the real data, your hard disk will reappear again (/if/ it's okay physically).

 LELTV> I've tried RDBSalv...but can't contact the author to register it.  I
 LELTV> don't know if it would help...but it sounds like the best bet.

Try comp.sys.amiga.hardware, there was something about this recently on there.

 LELTV> I've had someone mention DiskSalv4..but can't find that version on
 LELTV> Aminet.

1. It's commercial.
2. It's probably no good for this - v2 rescues files from an existing
partition and if you can't see them it's no good.

Perhaps I should set up an Amiga HD data recovery centre :)
I could probably salvage this drive for you, but there are the problems of
distance and postage costs..  I really don't like telling people remotely via
e-mail or even on the phone to do things which could potentially lose all
their data :)

 LELTV> data.  I've ordered a Syquest EZ drive with 10 carts...and am trying
 LELTV> to find some sort of SCSI interface (hopefully Squirrel) so that if
 LELTV> I do find the data, I can immediately back it up. (Any leads on a
 LELTV> scsi interface would be greatly appreciated too!)

Something on an accelerator would be best.  I assume (since you mention
Squirrel) that you have an A1200 - Blizzard 12x0 + SCSI are good.  Otherwise,
I think http://www.hi-soft.co.uk/ (or .hisoft.co.uk ???) is the place to look
for the Squirrel.  Perhaps www.powerc.com.

You won't find it there. DiskSalv4 is a commercial product. I don't know
how it's being distributed now, as both companies I knew of that were
distributing it are now history. DiskSalv4 *does* have a function to
check an entire drive for partition information, but I've never had to
use it, so I don't know how it works. You might try contacting the
author, Dave Haynie, through the Team Amiga Mailing list. He can help
you out with this. I wouldn't try anything else *at all* until you check
with Dave Haynie first, since he was on the inside at CBM when the
hardware and associated OS were designed. If he didn't do the design, he
knows (personally) the folks that did. He can help.

This may or may not work, but it'll do no damage to any data on the
drive so it's worth a try.

You have, you say, the correct specs for the drive from your new one.
What you need to do is make a dosdriver for the hard drive. Don't
worry about the partitions for the moment, just build a dosdriver that
covers the entire hard drive, along these lines;

    Device = scsi.device
    Unit = 0 
    Flags = 0x0
    Surfaces = 16
    BlockSize = 512
    BlocksPerTrack = 63
    Reserved = 2
    Interleave = 0
    LowCyl = 2 ; HighCyl = 1432
    Buffers = 100
    BufMemType = 0
    DOSType = 0x444f5301
    MaxTransfer = 1fe00
    Mask = 0x7ffffffe
    GlobVec = -1

You'll need to change the unit number if the drive isn't the boot
drive, also the Device if it isn't using the standard HD interface.
The low cyl should be correct, but you'll need to enter the correct
high cylinder value for the drive, which the correct HDTools set up on
the other drive will give you. Lastly, if you aren't using the fast
filesystem, then change the DOStype for the correct one.

Assuming it's the master drive and you'll boot from floppy, put the
dosdriver on the workbench disk, along with the filesystem and boot
up. If the dosdriver is in devs:dosdrivers/ then the drive should be
mounted, if it is elsewhere on the disk, double click the icon. You
can rename another dosdriver icon, it just needs the default set to
c:mount

Hopefully, you should see the data on your first partition. Now, if
you know the start and end cylinders for each partition on that drive,
you can make individual dosdrivers for them and mount them all. If you
don't, then you'll have to do it by trial and error. For example, if
the drive is 2 gig, and has 4000 cylinders, then you can guess it'll
be 2 cylinders per meg of partition, and if you know the sizes of the
partitions, you can get pretty close to their start values. Whichever,
by changing the lo cyl value in the driver and re-booting, you'll get
past the first and in to the second partition, and then hopefully see
that data. And so on .....

It's pretty laborious, but it has worked for me before. The nice thing
is that at no time are you writing to the drive, or to it's RDB. SO
nothing on the drive is changed at all. If you're successful at
finding the correct values of the cylinders, you could even then
re-write the RDB with those values, but I'd backup the recovered data
first.

Hope this is of some help, good luck.

Subject: [just-amiga] HD Trouble
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Well, a little more info...

HDToolBox just doesn't read the info wrong in the configurations....it's WAY
wrong.. Wrong # cylinders, and everything.   In fact, I tried using those
numbers with one of the RDB Recovery programs and it wouldn't even go until
I fed in the numbers from the identical drive.

But see, even if I feed the correct numbers into HDToolBox...it 'forgets'
them!

I know for certain the exact settings of my first partition (well, 99.8%
sure).. And someone suggested I put that in, reboot, and see if it showed
up...but to NOT write ANYTHING to the drive nor format anything.

Not only did it NOT show up...But when I went back to HDToolBox...it showed
the drive as UNKNOWN and no partition info saved!!!!!

Someone else suggested this could be a hardware problem with the drive..

If so...Perhaps the drive parts from the good drive could be used to repair
the older one...  Someone suggested that some pins may have become
unsoldered, or a part may be bad.

I'd be willing to ship both drives to a repair place..after I get everything
I currently have backed up from the working drive....

When I run some of the RDB recovery programs, when I say they run
forever.,..they do!  I ran one overnight and nothing.... I ran another one
where you can specify the # of cylinders to check... If I told it to start
at cylinder #1000 and go to 1001 (just a couple of cylinders) it would
barely blink the HD light and it was done..

BUT if I checked on cylinders less than 100...even for just two cylinders,
it would just sit there!  That's what makes me think this could be a
hardware problem...that and the fact that it reads ridiculous #s in
HDToolBox configurations, and that it won't save info from HDToolBox....

Subject: [just-amiga] Zero-G CD Magazine
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Heya!

Just a quick mail to say that the creators of the old Amiga diskmagazine
- Beyond The Frontier, are working towards creating a CD based magazine
for PC/Windows in 2001 called Zero-G.

If you would like to know more information or give us any comments just
have a look at the Zero-G site at http://www.zerog-mag.co.uk

If you have a few spare moments to fill in the online questionnaire too
we would appreciate it.... Just wanna see whether what we are planning
to do is actually wanted by other people..... Bit of a waste of time
otherwise... hehe ;))

Thanks in advance :))

(I know this is a music based list but I thought this project was of
scene significance and some people on here might be interested in
it..... If not, sorry, I'll shut up in the future ;))

C yA!

Alan

It sucks hard. If you specify wrong Low/High Cyl or other values,
the drive is not reported to be 'Not a DOS disk'. Instead it
simply exists and machine crashed after a while if you try to use the drive.
I had hard time getting the right values.

I guess it depends on how you're using the drive, whether it is one
partition, or several. I've only used it on a single partition drive
(3 gigs) and haven't had a single problem. Finding the values was
easy, just go into hard drive tools - config drive and get it to read
them for you; providing the drive is smaller than 4 gigs I guess.

Subject: [just-amiga] IDE Format
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello All,

This is a subject that has been bugging me for a while now, and I 
thought I would ask the question on this list, so that I could gain 
other people's opinions.  I have read in magazines and so forth over 
the years that low-level formatting of an IDE harddrive would render 
it useless in some form or other, and that once an IDE harddrive had 
been low-level formatted in the factory, then it would never need 
doing again in it's lifetime.  Is this true? and if it so, why?

What exactly does a low-level format do to the harddrive as opposed 
to a normal DOS format, that would render it useless?

Any input would be appreciated...

Low level formatting an IDE drive is at best a waste of time and, at
worst, will render it inoperable. The drive already has been set up in
firmware by the factory. By low-level formatting, AFAIK, you will
overwrite the settings that the drive requires in order to operate.
However, and this is why it's usually a waste of time trying anyway,
most modern drives will not allow you to low-level format them; this
is why if you do try it, the drive appears to format in a split second
without any dire consequences. Basically nothing happened. 

The low level format basically, AFAIK, re-writes all the info that is
given in HDTools under the configure drive - read drive config part.
Thus you won't know how many cyls, heads, etc are on the drive if you
remove the info.

One other thing I didn't find out till after watching several hard
drives for hours, while they formatted a partition. You do not need to
fully format a drive, only fast format, unless you suspect there may
be bad blocks. SO if you buy a new drive, sitting for hours formatting
it fully are wasted time.

With Regards

Subject: [just-amiga] IDE lowleverformating
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

 There are 2 main kind of interfaces for Harddisks IDE and SCSI. Ide is
and old but limited standart
which is being manipulated with to get big drives to work. Most
idedrives has 2 or 4 head but to get
them to work they simulate that they has 16 heads or more but if you
lowlevel format them you could
damage this information and your HD will be destoyed. There is no use
for lowlevel format today,
 1 percent of a new ide drive is used by the hd for spare sectors and
when a sector is dead the hd
alocates a new one from its spare. When the spare area is used up and
you start to see bad blocks
the harddisk is very very bad and there is no way but to dump it, and
buy a new one or if there stil
is garanty on it it is time to get to your dealer and get it replaced or
repared.
 Scsi harddiske is afaik made with the real heads,sectors og tracks and
can be lowlevel formatted
from the controller but it takes a lot of time...Flemming Hansen Denmark

A low-level format is the first step in preparing a HD for use. On some
modern hard disks the low-level format that can be done by the user is
a no-op (the drive just ignores it), but on some older drives it can
delete important house-keeping data.

For example, many hard disks have surface imperfections on the disk
platters. These are mapped out by the drive, so that the computer is
unaware of any problem. The bad-block/sector list is stored on the
hard drive itself, and is read in by the drive electronics upon power
up. More imperfections can arise over time, and these bad-blocks are
mapped out and replaced (logically) by spare blocks automatically.

Now, if you were to perform a low-level format, and the drive allowed
you to actually do it, you would erase this information about bad blocks,
and how the replacements are mapped. If you're lucky there may not be any
bad blocks, and everything will be OK. If you're unlucky there will be
bad blocks and your drive won't be reliable any more.

In severe cases there may be other important housekeeping information
stored on the drive, and erasing it will stop the drive working at all.

At the factory the low-level format is OK, as the equipment there is
set up to initialise the drive with the correct information. Most drives
these days can only be low-level formatted at the factory, and ignore
requests to perform one at all other times.

Hi everybody,

Just like to thank the people who responded to my questions with very 
informative answers, it was much appreciated, and has put my mind at

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello!

Well i'm back, back from where? Back from Italy.

This is the first time i've sent or receieved email
for *3 WEEKS*! wow, 3 weeks with no internet is hard
going for me :)

Well, i've figured out how to switch on the Amiga
again and my emails will be flowing in shortly
after this is sent, so to anyone whoes emailed me
and has not yet had a reply, i'm sorry for the delay
and i should get around to catching up on all the
emails i've missed so far, you should have a reply
within a few days.

Hope you've all had fun and have fun if your off
on any summer holidays ("vacations")... why not
share your experiences.

If anyones wondering, Italy was very nice and hot,
Venice was faaaaar too full of people and i'm not
so happy to come back to british rain, its JULY,
where is our sun?

I also took a few scenic photos of Italy and the
regions i visited so if anyones interested then email
me private and i'll sort that out. (Taken with the
Kodak DC215)

Talk soon!

Toodle Pip!

FA: Millennium for the video toaster and/or flyer

Item# 395035443

The Novadesign Millennium upgrade for the video toaster and/or flyer 
is here!  This is a 3CD collection of programs, fonts, backgrounds, 
and flyerclips.  

Included are some great programs like Wipe Studio - Use it to create 
your own wipes and effects for the Toaster and Flyer. RenderFX - 
Upgraded for Millennium, this package allows you to render your 
FlyerClip sequences down to a new FlyerClip. You can then layer more 
video, CG, and effects for a far more impressive production. Flyer 
Utilities - Includes utilities for converting Toaster wipes between 
3.x and 4.x formats, Undeleting FlyerClips, Timecoding and much more. 
ProMix - Also upgraded for Millennium, this package provides audio 
tools to let you add audio to video, import/export audio formats, add 
audio to FlyerClips and animations, and more. Fast Frames - Allows
you 
to 'Toasterize' your Video Flyer by pre-recording CG  sequences, 
Framestore montages, and create flying CG effects and more. Fast Fuel 
Millennium - Adds video deck control to the Toaster/Flyer interface 
for automatic clip recording. Electric Scene Knife - This can save
you 
literally hours of work. The Knife can take a FlyerClip and 
automatically find the different scenes within it, mark them, and
even 
offer to cut them into separate FlyerClips for you. Flyer Backup - A 
script based system that can backup your actual FlyerClips to a hard 
drive or to removable media. CGPilot - The famous CG ARexx scripts 
that automate many time consuming CG tasks. Toaster Wipes and Effects 
- There are hundreds of these and most are available for both Toaster 
3.x and 4.x so both Toaster and Flyer owners can use them. These 
include wedding wipes, fire wipes, basic animated wipes, cool soft 
gradient wipes, and fully rotoscoped motion matte wipes. MegFX - Over 
40 Flyer 4.x effects that perform real-time, full dual-stream 
(dual-clip), split-screen and layering effects directly in Flyer 
projects with no rendering. Backgrounds - Hundreds of full color, 
professionally drawn, backgrounds for you to use in your CG pages or 
in ToasterPaint. Full motion backgrounds - FlyerClips of animated 
scenes, fire, and more. You can use these with your Flyer for CG 
backgrounds or as royalty-free stock footage.

Subject: [just-amiga] ARGG! Alive Mediasoft!
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Dear All,

Does anyone know how I can get of the Alive Mediasoft
email listing. Its not a subscribe type email listing like
Just-Amiga, its just a list of email addresses.

I get about 6 emails a week from them, with loads of
pictures and stuff I really don't want, i've constantly
replied to the address it comes from requesting to be
removed to no avail.

Anyone got any ideas as its starting to annoy me.

Toodle Pip!

I thought Alive closed down recently, after all the allegations of piracy (and
ripping off authors, and taking money for non-existant products, and ...)? 
Surely that'd mean ending the mail shot too.

 CS> Its not a subscribe type email listing like Just-Amiga, its just a list

You need to contact whoever is sending it out then.  Without it being
controlled by a list bot there's not much else you can do.

Send things to get attention: 5000x5000 pixel Windows BMP files, for example. 
Or, since Alive are/were an Amiga company, send Windows viruses.  I'm /sure/
they wouldn't be using Outlook...

Just to remind you,  this is a *GLOBAL* medium,   
it would be nice to know exactly where you are...

Without this email,  you could have been in the UK or 
Asia or any other place on the planet..

There is no address on your site.
A phone number & a mailto aren't going to help..

Regards

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, all!

    As a fan of 8 bit systems, I'm on a number of 8 bit mailing lists.  Below
is an extract of a message I received on an Atari mailing list.  I'd like to
see a 'port of CC65 to the Amiga.  Anyone interested?

Willi


The extract:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm proud to announce version 2.5 of CC65, a C crosscompiler /
crossassembler combo for 6502 systems.

CC65 has C and runtime library support for many of the old 6502 machines.
The libraries are fairly portable, so creating a version for other 6502s
shouldn't be too much work.


More information:

For your convenience, I've put all doc files also on the web server:

    http://www.von-bassewitz.de/uz/cc65/doc/

The cc65 main page

    http://www.von-bassewitz.de/uz/cc65/

will get updated to reflect the new version in the next few days.

There is also a cc65 mailing list. To subscribe, send a mail to
majordomo@musoftware.de with the command

    subscribe cc65

in the body of the mail.


Download:

For more information and links to the FTP server, see

           http://www.von-bassewitz.de/uz/cc65/

What... y'all just look at the pictures? ;))
The word "TEXAS" mean anything? ;) It appears 20 times total on the site. 
The city, "Corpus Christi" appears once. As follows;
Second page, second line, "TEXAS". 6th page next to last line in the only
paragraph, "Corpus Christi". On every page in the inventory lists, twice, top
and bottom, "TEXAS," on the menu page second line, "TEXAS."
Oooops... i'm sorry, i did omit "United States," but being a natural born 
Texan, i assumed everybody on the planet knew where Texas was ;)

Hey, i'm an AMIGA dealer, 14 years worth, i've been reduced to living in a
P. O. Box. Besides being embarrasing, I don't really want people "knocking 
on my door," the sound vibrations in that small space hurts my ears, and it's 
real uncomfortable to try to get to the door when you're folded up like i am, 
not to mention it's too tight to invite anyone in for a "cold one." ;)

Believe me, when anyone orders something, they will know where to mail
anything, if they don't use a credit card, and if it's repair work that's
needed, they will get an address to ship to that comes right to my little 
eager hands. I would rather talk to a repair customer on the phone or by 
e-mail first though, as the problems can usually be talked through.

Over the last 4 years, before my storefront got sold out from under me, i
had maybe 30 people walk into my store, and maybe 2 of them were actually
customers. The majority of my business over these years has been from
broadcast and cable TV companies, School Districts, and end users outside 
of my city and i have conducted business mostly by phone and e-mail anyway.

L8R,
Skip

Hi Chris,

Now that's freaky! 

I was reading up on people's reactions to the news at Amiwest, 
decided to check the Just-Amiga list for the first time in a long 
time and lo and behold I see my name as a subject heading. :)

As I clicked on the ja group and saw the website address I also 
remembered that aio.co.uk is still in my name and that I should get 
it transferred over to you.  I'm guessing that you are looking for me 
as Nominet have maybe emailed you?

It really is strange the way things happen some times... :) 

(As a side note I call to aio.co.uk from time to time but didn't 
think that you had much to do with the Amiga anymore since passing on 
AIO, it's nice to see you have been here all along! :) ).

All the best...

Conor

Whoa there, Neil. I presume this last para suggesting sending virii
was tongue in cheek, right?  8-)

Hi Everybody,

   I thought you'd all like to know that my latest game, Pictris, is
finally released :) 

   It's a really addictive puzzle game involving finding a hidden
picture in a grid using number clues. You'll love it ;)

   You can download the demo from aminet or my homepage
