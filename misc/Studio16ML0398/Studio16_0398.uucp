I have a Sunrize AD1012 card in my Amiga.  The problem I am having is that
Studio16 3.0 won't work with the chips.  It says that I need to up grade to
64megs chips but, sunrize is no longer around!  
Are these standard chip that I can get someplace else or not?

Please help.

Thanks 

Dan,

A friend here in town had a similar prob, and, if I'm not mistaken, our
local amiga gizmo guru tracked down the actual part number of the required
64k chips, so he was able to order them directly from a parts distributor. 

As I will be meeting with both these gents on Tuesday, I'd be more than
happy to grab this info for you--assuming someone else hasn't already
responded privately with the necessary answer. 

Best,
Mike McCool

i'd be very interested in this info as well, as i have a 1012 gathering
dust that would become useful if i could use it with v3.

Just for my own curiosity... has anyone had the following occur?

If when playing back tracks, I turn a track off by clicking the track on/off indicator on the cue list window, Studio16 locks up. Has anyone else encountered this problem?  This happens on both my A2000 w/68040, and A3000 w/68030. This, by the way, is the only bug I have found that will lock the machine up completely. The only way I have found around this bug, is to stop all tracks from playing, and then turn the track on or off.

Hello Dan;

Good and bad news.

The RAM chips used on the Sunrize 1012 were run of the mill memory chips. On my
1012, I replaced my 64k chips with 128k chips (don't ask why), and the card
recognized them. Kudos to Sunrize!

Unfortunately, you might have a hard time finding memory chips in either 64k ,or
128k configs. Most manufacturers stopped making these things years ago, in favor
of much higher densities.

If you're lucky, I might still have the 64k chips I removed from my 1012. Send me
your address, via personal e-mail, and, if I have them, I'll ship 'em off to you.

-->indicator on the cue list window, Studio16 locks up. Has anyone else
encountered 

Yes, I've had it happen more than once. Often, the error message "Having Trouble
De-allocating Track" is associated with this, but not always. Either the whole
system locks up, or the screen locks up, and the audio keeps playing. As a result,
I've taken to not touching the track allocation buttons during playback.

My system:
-A2000, Blizzard 2060 accel, 128M RAM, SCSI
-2 x AD516
-WB3.1
-PicassoII, w CyberGraphx v3

Well.... I'm so happy..... I knocked another problem off!!!

The problem with my A3000 not playing more than 3 tracks... and sometimes not
even 1......

I reformatted the 2.1GB Quantum drive in my A3000 that origionally came out of
my A2000 running a DKB SCSI controller. I guess the RDB is not quite right
from controller to controller!  I can now play 8 tracks with a 512kb buffer no
problem. 

Thanks for all of your help on this.....

Gord, is this still happening now that you are getting the full 8
track playback?

I turn tracks on and off frequently on both my 3000 and 4000 and have
never had this happen.   I would guess this could be a problem if you
were taxing the cpu or drive close to it's limits, and then tried
turning on and off tracks.

Gord, is this still happening now that you are getting the full 8
track playback?

I turn tracks on and off frequently on both my 3000 and 4000 and have
never had this happen.   I would guess this could be a problem if you
were taxing the cpu or drive close to it's limits, and then tried
turning on and off tracks.

I need to buy a reasonably fast modem, and software for my Amiga 2000 - 040 3.1
for downloading software, etc. from the net, and this mailing list. I'm
willing to buy used, if in good shape.
Any suggestions?

Some of you may remember my posting some time ago that I had an AD516 board
that I had been attempting to get for some time. It had been payed for, but
the guy I was buying it from had been sick and it was just difficult to get
with him when he wasn't all drugged up.

Well, a few days ago, I un-subscribed from this list because I hadn't been
able to get the AD516 yet, and frankly the additional mail was just not
doing me any good. Not 48 hours after dropping the list, I FINALLY get the
card from him. How ironic.

Anyway... This brings me to a problem that has me a bit miffed.

I installed the AD516 card in my A4000 and installed v3.1 of the Studio16
software without a hitch. No problems at all during the installation
proceedure. When I launch the software, I am greeted with a little orange
box behind the splash screen that says "Studio AREXX   No handlers loaded!"

When I go to launch the different application, here are the results:

Cuelist - Window opens and 3D gadgets operate, but since I have no clue how
the cuelist app works, I don't know how functional it is being.

Editor - Window opens up and seems to be functional. I can load an 8SVX
sound file, but I can't play it.

Meters - Message "no handlers loaded"

Mixer - Nothing at all...no message, no windows.

Recorder - Message "Could not find handler"

Sample list - Window opens. Again, though, not very functional

SMPTE generator - Window opens, but notibly not functional. Press PLAY and
no advancement of time code in display.

SMPTE monitor - Window opens, but have not fed SMPTE into card to see if
it's functioning.

Time - Window opens. Once again, clueless on it's functionality.

Tinymixer - Window opens blank. No gadgets or anything.

REXXMAST is loading on startup and I use AREXX on a daily basis. The entire
Toaster/Flyer software practically lives on AREXX. What could be the
problem? The software installation went through flawlessly.

My system configuration is as follows:

A4000
Cyberstorm MKII 50Mhz 68060
44 Megs fast RAM
2 Megs chip RAM
Video Toaster 4000
Flyer
Kickstart v.39.106
Workbench v.39.48

Someone please help! I've waited over a year to get the 516 in my possesion
and now this. What am I missing here?

Hi Dean! I would recommend that you buy new software! Support the Amiga
marketplace so that *it* can continue to support you (us)! The prices are
very good, and they are nice to use, as compared to the "free" stuff on the
Windozzze platform. Internut Exploiter being the bad browser.

I use IBrowse because it was first to get some of the features I wanted, but
AWeb looks cool too. Don't really see that much about Voyager, other than it
is coming out with a major upgrade that looks promising. There _should_ also
be another browser entering the marketplace shortly, but if it isn't for
sale by the time you are ready to buy, go for one that is.

I never crash with IBrowse, and when servers aren't busy, get killer FTP
speeds. I love the MUI configurability, it is easy to get "out there" if you
have the resources, or keep it simple if you don't. There are quite a few
ARexx scripts and "plug-ins" for IBrowse. Again, all three browsers seem to
play leapfrog in features.

I use TermiteTCP because it is simple and doesn't litter the hard drive with
support files. It is a no-brainer to use and install, and only has one bug ­
one that is easy to avoid. Miami (shareware by Holger Kruse) is also great
and more configurable. But harder to understand, and many of the features
are not needed by the casual user. Either one is great. Avoid AmiTCP, or
whatever it is, unless you like scratching your head and reading docs.

All the current modems seem to be about the same, in terms of support and
quality. I use a USRobotics 56k-x2 because my ISP has good x2 support, and
it was cheap from an Amiga-oriented supplier. But I wouldn't care if it was
a Supra, Cardinal, or whatever. Just buy for the features you can use, later
you'll be looking for something else anyway, like ISDN or a cable-modem.

YAM is my mailer. Once I used it it did what I wanted with little fuss, and
again ­ that great MUI customizing. I got one #WILD# Workbench!

BTW, Dean: did you know you can configure your mailer so that both Marcia
and you can have separate entries with the same address in the address book?
Probably save you some explanations.

Take care!

Which version of Stidio16 have you installed on your machines ????

I have version 3.1 installed on an A3000, the locking problem you mentioned
when clicking a track on/off never occures on my machine.
Maybe you have a hardware or software conflict on both machines.
Send you whole configuration to this mailinglist so all the users have ore
information.
Maybe we can solve the problem.

Seeyaa,

Hi Danny....

It sounds to me like the AD516 handler is not in the proper directory.... I'm not in front of my machine right now, so I can't check, but as far as I can remember, you have to move the handler your require, either AD516 or AD1012 from one directory to another depending on which board your have. In your case, you have the AD516, so the AD516 handler file should be moved to , I think maybe the L: directory, but I could be wrong.... Some one else help me out here.....

Gord

Dean....

I have been using Miami 2 for my internet connection for the past year or so. The other day I decided to support the Amiga market and register my version of Miami. I went to the Miami web page, www.nordicglobal.com, and literally within 30 seconds, Miami 2 was registered automaticly over the net. Of course you require a VISA for this, but I was quite impressed with how easy it was. It validated my credit card, and send me the registration all within 30 seconds.....(OK I'm repeating my self, but I thought it was very cool)

With in two days of registering, Miami 3.0 was released. I downloaded it, installed it, and when I dialed up, I clicked on register, and it automaticly searched the Nordic Global server, saw I was a registered user, and registered my new version. Very impressive!!!

I also use Ibrowse to browse the web. It works very well, but I would make sure you have version 1.12a, since version 1.1 had a few annoying bugs. 1.2 should be released soon as well.

YAM 2.0 has just been released. This is a very nice mail package, especially now with version 2.0. Check it out... and the best thing is it's free!! Although if the programmer was charging for it, I would definetly pay for it. (I was actually thinking of sending him some money anyway)

As far as modems, I use the US Robotics 56k X2, but I hear the Motorola k56 flex modems are better... at any rate, at least get one that supports 33.6kb.

Happy surfin.....

I need to buy a reasonably fast modem, and software for my Amiga 2000 - 040 3.1
for downloading software, etc. from the net, and this mailing list. I'm
willing to buy used, if in good shape.
Any suggestions?

If you need Studio 16 to load the handler it should be in
Studio16_3:Drivers/

You can also start the handler from the user-startup or startup-sequence by
typing its path and name (no 'run' needed). This will load the handler from
anywhere. This way you can also control which handler to load first if you
have more than one card installed. Example:

s:user-startup:
-- 
[...]
Studio16_3:Drivers/AD516Handler  ;or another dir where you keep the handler
[...]
--

Which version of Stidio16 have you installed on your machines ????

I have version 3.1 installed on an A3000, the locking problem you mentioned
when clicking a track on/off never occures on my machine.
Maybe you have a hardware or software conflict on both machines.
Send you whole configuration to this mailinglist so all the users have ore
information.
Maybe we can solve the problem.

After comparing your list to my installation, I noticed that the DRIVERS
directory that the AD516 handler is supposed to be in was not even present
on my system. I created the directory and moved the AD516 handler into it
and it is now working. This, of course, is also consistant with the
response from Gord and Kenny. Thanks to all of you for pointing me in the
right direction.

Now... I recall a while back, some discussion regarding availability of
photocopied manuals or AmigaGuide versions of the manual? What is the
latest on that? I've figured most of it out, but the cue list still has me
a little baffled.

One other thing. I seem to recall when the previous owner was demostrating
the AD516 to me, he had pointed out that the card was capable of real time
effects. He was running v2 of the software, I believe. Is my memory
mistaken, or have some real-time effects features been scrapped since an
earlier version of Studio16? I can't find them anywhere.

YAM 2.0 is a PREVIEW, and many people are having major problems with it, so
I wouldn't open that can of worms right off the bat. Also, the docs in the
preview are Deutsch (that's German to me). Try YAM 1.35 first. Let the
bleeding edgers deal with it... {conservative mumbling, wringing of hands}

I have heard of some things that Thor is very good at that even YAM 2 won't
be addressing. So if you have the luxury of trying this shareware, I would
recommend it also, though it has a bit more learning curve up front. I have
thought about switching, though I think YAM has done a great job for me.

If you have a dealer you trust, take his/her recommendations into account
also. The demoing and support a dealer can provide are worth having.

>As far as modems, I use the US Robotics 56k X2, but I hear the Motorola k56
>flex modems are better... at any rate, at least get one that supports 33.6kb.

Yeah, people are playing the BETTER game all the time, but it is more
important to match the support and type of lines your Internet Service
Provider supplies. Truth be told, server and line bandwidth limits us far
more than our local modem speeds on the majority of the transactions we
participate in. Having 33.6 or above just keeps us from blaming our own
modem when things are c r a w l i n g.

[I'll try to pounce on the next Studio16-related em I can, so as not to be
accused of being Misterr Off Topic.] See you Gord, and Dean.

Well Greenboy, I origionally found a fellow in the US that wanted to sell his AD516 for $450.00us. After exchange and all, it comes to about $650.00 canadian, and he doesn't take VISA :)

Even though this was a good price in my eyes, I couldn't come up with a method of payment without me taking a risk. So I happened to be on National Amiga's web site, and saw one listed for $750.00 can, without disks or manuals. Since I already own a 516 this wan't a problem. I called, and talked them down to $650.00can, and they take VISA. They shipped it out and I should have it for this weekend.

Hi Gord! I really can't answer your question myself, but I was wondering
what you paid for the AD516, and what other prices and places you have seen.


Glad you've gotten past the hard drive issue; you've been posting some good
stuff since you've been able to "feel the power". I feel a bit remiss in not
pushing that solution at you early on; its always proved expedient to write
new RDBs each time I've swapped controllers, but also a thing I've taken for
granted and so didn't really say much about it on the m-list.

But a lesson well-learned ­ well, perhaps you won't forget, and perhaps I
will remember again also...

Hey, all of you who asked about upgraded 64k ram chips so you can run 3.0
software:

Well, my local guy wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped.  He couldn't exactly
remember when/how he'd ordered those chips for Len's upgrade, only that he
definitely HAD done it.  

Having dealings with him before, I suspect his lack of helpfulness is due
to his sensing at once that HE would not profit by this venture.

I did coax some part numbers out of him, though he wasn't too specific
about EXACTLY what had to be ordered.  (First he was sure you only needed
one chip for the 1012, but the scratch paper he gave me had TWO numbers
listed for the 1012).

Chip numbers for 516:

27C64A-15N
KMK2719=9206 KF

Chip numbers for 1012:

D431000 ACZ (that Z could be a 2) (his script's deplorable)
9129RROM

I'm really sorry to have led y'all down the garden path like this.  I hope
the numbers help more than they hurt.  

(NOR could he remember exactly where he'd ordered the chips from).

Don't drum me off the list for this,
M

The realtime effect module was in 2.x, but not in 3.0-3.01. If I have
understood correctly there was planned realtime effects for a 3.1 release,
but as you know 3.1 never was released to the public.

However, it's fully possible to take advantage of the DSP on-board. You will
need to download some assembler DSP code to it and know the environment it
uses.

Have you tried Radio Shack? They've got tons old generic chips at my store.
Each manufacturer has his own codes, so there may be other chips that would
work, even if you did remember the right nomenclature. 

I've got some old memory chips here,  8 in a bank to make 1 meg. Each chip has
20 pins. They're on an old printer memory card, and I think they're 120ns.
Would these help?

Have anyone tried to contact Analoge Devices (makers of ADSP2105) and asked
if they can provide information on how to get memory to their chips ? Or are
the memory chips non-adsp/AD1012 specific ?

Thanks for the quick reply, Gord. Yeah that buying and selling over the net
gets scary.

Actually, the chips used were at one time fairly common. So any vendor that
has kindness in the heart and not just profit-motive should be able to steer
you toward some. If they have been in the game long enough. Perhaps
VisionSoft would be a good bet here ­

    http://www.visionsoft.com/

These chips are also used in some music hardware so they ARE available
/somewhere/. I would suggest going back to 1012 documentation (or early
devdocs, I'm sure I saw those chip descriptions somewhere) for the chip
descriptions.

i have my handlers named AD516Handler1 and AD516Handler2.  i can't
remember if the install script did this, or if i did it manually.  i do
remember that the install script knows how many cards you have installed.

i had problems with the handler from 3.01 0 use the handlers from 3.01a.
my machine would periodically not be able to find both cards with the
older handler, and i would have to reboot.

As I recall, the effects in v2 precluded the use of the card as a multitrack
recorder anyway. And more-complex (richer) effect algorithms were available
in dedicated hardware, or programs like Sample Wrench, thereby allowing the
AD516 to pursue its primary use as a multitrack.

Now: effects simultaneously with mixing and multitrack playback ­ that's a
different badger ;B]

Some here on the list still have 2.x installed, as they need it with
Broadcaster (hi Jamie, hi Brian!) or for some other reason. That is
something that left my hard-drive when I saw 3.01's interface and
capabilities. My floppies were overwritten as 3.01 backups.

I just wasn't that impressed with the [pre-emptive] effects, as I had owned
many good rack-mount fx, and /didn't/ own any other *direct-to-disk*
*multitrack* random-access recording/editing systems.

Here's a good question!
If I do find the 64k chips, how many do I need?
I lost my ad1012 manual years ago.
I guess I could open up the Amiga and take a look but, I have ALOT of stuff
connected to it and would rather wait until I have the chips before starting
such an undertaking.

Hi Serge,

Well,  I don't know if this is related to the editor schizoidia I was
talking about, but I found out that you are indeed correct about this
problem.  Anyone trying to remove clicks or other small anomalies in a
waveform by using the Freehand Draw feature should know about this
because if you don't do it right your effort is nullified.

If you close the editor or scroll right or left with either the drag
bar or arrows after doing a freehand draw the waveform will return to
it's original shape.

You must do one of two things to avoid losing your edit.

1. Zoom out before scrolling or closing.
                    or
2. De-select the Freehand Draw feature before closing or scrolling.

Pretty strange huh....?



As far as my original problem...

        =From my original post=

>If you zoom out there is a point where the image appears correct
again

Currently I am doing a Yoga Breathing Instructional tape where I have
four segments of dialogue approximately 25 min in length each.  
Because of this problem I have had to do a "Copy As.." function on
small regions (6-11 minutes) of each sample to create smaller chunks
that don't seem to deteriorate the graph image when zooming in.

This work around was the only solution because I needed to zoom down
to just a few seconds to edit out unwanted breathing or other mouth
sounds between words or phrases.

Is anyone out there doing any kind of editing like this?   I
personally think this problem cripples much of the broad usefulness of
Studio16, especially for professionals who must be able to do this
kind of editing on the spot for clients.


I would prefer to think that this was the result of something specific
to my set up but it seems to be program specific.

I have tried all the different copy buffer sizes thinking that may
influence this but no....


If anyone could test any long samples they have (over 10 minutes) and
let me know that would be great.

As I said earlier, there are some around: other hardware devices need chips
like these also. I mentioned VisionSoft, try also Paxtron ­

    http://www.paxtron.com/

Then start searching for suppliers that are non-Amiga-specific.

-->Chip numbers for 1012:

-->D431000 ACZ (that Z could be a 2) (his script's deplorable)
-->9129RROM

Something's fishy about these numbers. They look like numbers for the PROM chip,
as opposed to the RAM chips.

The AD1012 uses two identical RAM chips in parallel. They are the 28 pin chips, or
32 pin chips found at the end of the board, in sockets. I think it's U33 & U34.
The sockets are 32 pin, but will accept 28 pin chips, depending on the size of the
memory. For ex: On my AD1012, I originally found 2 32k chips (28 pins), for a
total of 64k. I replaced these with 2 128k chips (32 pins), for a total of 256k.
The AD1012 seems to have been designed to automatically recognize a few different
sizes (32k, 64k, 128k).

The RAM chips are made by a number of memory manufacturers (MOSEL-Vitelic,
Hitachi, Texas, etc), and usually has a part number which defines memory size,
along with access speed. Ex: MOSEL xx256-10 would mean an 8 bit x 32k config (=
256k bits), with a 100 nanosec access time.

Other manufacturers list byte sizes as their part number, instead of bit sizes.
Ex: Hitachi xxx128-70 would mean 8 bit x 128k, with a 70 nanosec access time.

I must stress that it doesn't matter who makes the chips, or what the part
number is, as long as it has the proper number of pins (28, or 32), has the proper
config (8 bit x 32k, or 8 bit by 64k, or 8 bit by 128k), and is 100 nanosec, or
faster (70, 80, 60, etc).

The real problem lies in finding these chips. Most manufacturers removed them from
their production lines years ago, in favor of much larger capacities.


Just a thought. Hope this helps.  :>)

Yes I've got 2.05, 2.06, and 2.08. Whats your pleasure?
Maybe someone else would know the best one to pick of these three.

I'll have to wait until I get to a free phone line this weekend. . .

I've just built new shelves for three A3000's and four monitors today and
am in the process of getting all this stuff working in concert before I go
on a first wedding anniversary trip (in other words, there's no way I can
put the trip off to play with all my new toys).  :(

Uh-h-h-h just kidding dear. . . .

Let me know Floyd.

Hello Gary;


-->You must do one of two things to avoid losing your edit.

-->1. Zoom out before scrolling or closing.
-->                    or
-->2. De-select the Freehand Draw feature before closing or scrolling.

-->Pretty strange huh....?

Yup. It's amazing that this got by unnoticed. It's gotta be a feature
(undocumented, of course).


-->This work around was the only solution because I needed to zoom down
-->to just a few seconds to edit out unwanted breathing or other mouth
-->sounds between words or phrases.

Wow. Pretty frustrating.

-->personally think this problem cripples much of the broad usefulness of
-->Studio16, especially for professionals who must be able to do this
-->kind of editing on the spot for clients.

Agreed wholeheartedly. It's appalling really, that this potentially critical tool
was never checked more thoroughly. As far as doing close-in, freehand edits, I've
completely given up on it. It's not even good enough to be considered a toy. Do I
sound angry, frustrated, disillusioned? Maybe I'll put the gun away now.  :>)

Yes, you are right, i just missed the Zero i think.

Try a setup without MagicWB, MUI and Kcommodity.
I don't think MUI is the problem because Studio16 does not use MUI.


This is my Setup:

A3000 25Mhz/14Mb - 1.2Gb Hp - 1Gb Jaz - OS 2.04

One Stop Music Synth Board installed.

I run Studio16 without any problems.
I sync Bars and Pipes with studio 16 V3.01 and run a D110 editor at the same time.
I run 48 Midi Channels via the Tripple Play Midi interface which is attached on
the standart serial A3000 port.
On this machine i have no MUI,NewIcons,Magic WB or other WB extra's installed.

So maybe one of the proogram's gives you your studio16 problem ?????


Succes with you quest

i've been using by ad516s a lot lately.  i've actually been flooded with
cd mastering work.  anyway, i wrote a couple of programs to make it easy
to setup batch processes using a few of the studio16 add utilities that
kenny wrote.  i started thinking that maybe it'd be a good idea to expand
the functionality of these things for others to use.

so the questions -

which of those applications do you use?
in what context?

i've been mostly using the s16makepermanent command - it's great to crop
and trim the tracks for a cd non-destructively and have them all made
permanent while i go get coffee.  it's also faster than making permanent
from within s16, since there is now new .graph file regenerated.  anyway.

i'd also like to hear what you have to say about your qmaster usage.

Kenny has done a great job making some useful stuff for S16 (anything
happening on the interface front, folks?). But problems like this make it
obvious that we need Maurizio or Ben or the Unknown to get us over the hump
on this one.

The idea of chopping down l o n g samples into shorter ones is an approach
that lends itself well to dialog timing and ridding extraneous lip smacking
sounds. Oh, it's not that kind of video?

Greenboy's right... other software is the answer..... on that note, what exactly came of Ben's possibility of creating an AHI driver. It wasn't too clear as to if he was actually going to create one, or if he was just thinking about it.

I have uploaded two UUCP files containing January's and February's content
of this mailing list for those who are interrested/have joined in later. If
you use Thor you just use the command bin/ParseUUCP <system> <file> to add
them to your database. I will continue to upload UUCP files for each month.

Thor (Sortmail) have messed up the dates on earlier messages while moving
them to another conference so I will not upload messages before '98 (the
arexx script I use is dependent on the date to create an UUCP file). It will
too much work going trough every single message (~1000).

Please refer to the FAQ (see header of this message) for sorted problems and
answers.


Thanks,

- Kenny

I want to play audio from one card, into an effects processor, back into the
second card and record. You can do this with one AD516 but you have to turn
the input monitor 'OFF' to avoid feedback, which means you can't see the level
you are recording. I'm hoping that having two cards will solve this problem.

Oh yeah.....no.

.....but a good idea.  It's a bit more complicated though if you have
the cards installed in two separate computers, because you don't have
easy access to all files across both systems.

In my set up, I try to keep rhythm instruments on one system and
melodic instruments and vocals on the other.  If I looped a vocal
through an effect and back onto the other system I would have to copy
that file back to the original computer.  I do have my 3000 and 4000
networked with Pronet.   Actually...maybe I ought to give it a try,
maybe it wouldn't take that long to move files back and forth.

What is to stop you from looping back to the same card?   The only
disadvantage I can think of is you can't monitor the input.

Actually my main idea with two cards was a little different then I
described above,  I try to use one computer as a stereo mix of the
main body of instruments, and keep instruments on the other that need
discrete isolation...(2 discrete outs).

For smaller samples (ones that can be played in ½ ram:) SampleWrench or
Stephan Stuntz' program can do some interesting things. But we need progs
that can do that directly to the streaming data, don't we. So we don't have
to run those messy wires all over the place.

This stuff is very easy to find from electronic supply places.  Mouser
(www.mouser.com), Digi-Key (www.digikey.com), JameCo (www.jameco.com), JDR
Microdevices (www.jdr.com) are all places that will sell single unit
quantities to anyone who knows enough to know what they are asking for.  :)

I recommend trying JameCo or JDR first.

Both in one machine avoids file-transfer complications. BUT­­

This is the type of problem I believe best solved with a *wallet*. Pull the
wallet out in the presence of a salesperson, (can be a "virtual" experience)
and BUY a rack-mount "black box". Even most of the cheap ones today will run
rings around the effects algorithms in Studio16 (no dissing here, Ben, just
the result of progress and specialization).

With a proper mixing/patchbay situation you can walk right past the already-
mentioned problems ­ and have better/more effects, and auditioning to boot.

(Actually, I *don't* solve this problem with a wallet ­ because I already
came to this conclusion the moment I saw Studio16 effects.)

to execuse a GPI triger from 
one machine to Start play Back of a Cuelist on Another

I used VMM for virtual memory on my 2000/040 and ran the demo version of SampleWrench 3.1 with no problem. That's kindof a half ass fix for the programs that only deal with RAM.

For smaller samples (ones that can be played in 1/2 ram:) SampleWrench or

that can do that directly to the streaming data, don't we. So we don't have
to run those messy wires all over the place.

Ah, yes, ingenuity. (An Amigan trait, no doubt.) Well, had tried this in the
dim dark past with late lamented Innovatronic's GigaMem. But quickly lost
patience as other system-wide problems interrupted my sangfroid.

But *Wrench* is way cool, isn't it? Could perhaps use a little more
tinkering in the Amiga style guidelines department, but... (oh, hi, jim;)

And apologies to all for my earlier lapse of senility, when above I listed
Stephan _Stuntz_. I did not spell /Stefan/ correctly, and did not intend
reference to the gui, *MUI* (wooly bully, wooly bully!). And also not to
Stephffhan _Furst_, of B5.

I refer to Stefan _Kost_, developer of the illustrious *SoundFX* sample editor
(Aminet/ mus/edit/sfx-bin_[yourprocessorhere].lha). Again apologies!

v3.0 had the vu meters you're thinking of - they peak in the red at +3db,
as opposed to 3.01's meters peaking at zero.  they are a bit less
sensitive.  i have both meters accessible from studio16 on my machine.  

i took the v3.0 meters out of the studio16_3:Apps drawer, and renamed them
to Meters+3db.  put them in studio16 v3.01's Studio16_3:Apps drawer.  now
both style of meteres will be accessible from your applications menu.

-->This stuff is very easy to find from electronic supply places.  Mouser


Glad to hear it.

For anyone interested, the exact part number for the 128k chips is:

Hitachi, HM62128-10, 32 pin  (8 bit x 128k config)

The -10 refers to 100 nanosec access speed. You can also look for something faster
(-70  [70 nsec], or -85 [85 nsec]).

Just ask for a pin-compatible equivalent. Any electronics supplier will be able to
provide cross-references. Why go with 128k chips instead of 64k? No real reason,
except the 1012 is expandable up to 256k (2 x 128k), and the price will probably
be identical.

What Floyd said.
 (v3.0 had the vu meters you're thinking of - they peak in the red at +3db,
 as opposed to 3.01's meters peaking at zero. i have both meters accessible)

Not using SMPTE, huh? This looks like a job for manual-reading and head-
scratching. [teeth nash]

So: The A4000/Toaster is the master that will be sending the GPI? And the
A2000/AD516 needs to sync. Is correct? Or is a tape-based editing system or
Flyer also involved?

Really need more details, and more thought. Not necessarily mine either,
folks, hint-hint.

>both machines are networked using Parnet

Not to make life even more difficult, but I can't believe Parnet on 3.0+ OS
systems isn't causing you all kinds of problems. I would suggest ProNet (on 
Aminet, natch!). Stable, and does things more elegantly. Still uses your
Parnet cable, too :] (Though it takes alittle thinking to set it up, the
docs were only /so/ helpful.

Good luck, Luis!

I think the VU meters were changed because a digital signal has no tolerance for distrotion like an analog signal does. With analog, you can push the level into the red and still have a good signal. Digital is either clean, or extremely distorted. Therefore there is no need for room on a digital meter.

For anyone interested...


www.jdr.com has the exact Hitachi chip

SRAM 128KX8(551001-85)100NS 32DIP  HM628128LP-10  $6.99 



A quick look on www.jameco.com also shows the following:

part# 103982  - 628128LP-85 128K x 8 85ns Low Power CMOS SRAM for $8.49

Thanks for the info on pronet I will give it a try, Also your correct on the
VU meters, how do you a access
both VU Meters or is the VU meters peaking in the red at +3db
only available with 3.00 can I just drop the meters of 3.00 in the 
meters directory 3.01a and swop them when need be?
also no No flyer involved yet! I know the flyer does output smpte
but my Toaster system is not flyer base yet. thanks again!

Hi ! Floyd thanks for your info on the meters I dont
have 3.00. Is there any way I can get them on the net?
or maybe 3.00 from someone willing to email 3.00 to me?
thanks for the insight on the meters 
Regards

I can't even remember the pre-3.01 meters, but you are right about digital
versus analog, Gord. If every thing is properly calibrated, 0db on a record-
meter should represent the top digital value possible, or very close!
Digital clipping is horrible ­ kind of like playing pic or ascii data on the
Paula chip.

Analog past 0 simply "compresses" on tape, at least until the electronics in
the signal chain hit their ceiling.

I sent this once and it never appeared on the list, so I'm sending it
again. If it did go out and just somehow didn't get back to me, please
ignore it.

After comparing your list to my installation, I noticed that the DRIVERS
directory that the AD516 handler is supposed to be in was not even present
on my system. I created the directory and moved the AD516 handler into it
and it is now working. This, of course, is also consistant with the
response from Gord and Kenny. Thanks to all of you for pointing me in the
right direction.

Now... I recall a while back, some discussion regarding availability of
photocopied manuals or AmigaGuide versions of the manual? What is the
latest on that? I've figured most of it out, but the cue list still has me
a little baffled.

One other thing. I seem to recall when the previous owner was demostrating
the AD516 to me, he had pointed out that the card was capable of real time
effects. He was running v2 of the software, I believe. Is my memory
mistaken, or have some real-time effects features been scrapped since an
earlier version of Studio16? I can't find them anywhere.

Is there any real benefit for doing this with an AD516?  I know the 516 has
128k as default
but without any use (yet)  of realtime effects on an input stream, is it any
beneficial to bump
the cards ram up to 256k? Especially if the host system is an 060 based with
a fast SCSI-II
HD?

Side note for the labs:  Has anyone sucessfully setup a psuedo flyer system
with a Toaster,
Ad516, PAR?  The PAR can synch up to the AD516's internal SMTPE code and
start
playback synchronized with a specific time code from the AD516.  Is this
possible
on record to PAR?  Pretty much a newbie to the non-linear aspect of this as
I have previously
used the components seperately but would love to do direct recording to PAR
with the
audio track recording to the AD516 and have everything SMTPE synched without
having to do striping (don't have the module) Granted any recorded masters
would not
have VITC or LTC embedded in them but this is a moot point for me as I
intend to
do all editing prior to recording to tape via the PAR and AD516.

Now for the 'Masters of Non-Linear editing' this may seem like putting the
cart before
the horse but remember I do not intend to refeed the recorded master for
additional
edits but rather edit prior to final output within the PAR and AD516. The
516 will
be the synchronizer(SP) for everything as it is the only comonent in my
setup with
internal SMTPE which can be monitored by the PAR as well as the AD516
triggering
audio during a Toaster transition with the 516's Toaster handler
(unfortunately limited
to 2 tracks only AFAIK)

As I don't have a Toaster system I'm not sure about what's involved there.
However, I do have a PAR/AD516 system. What you describe here is possible.
However, there's no easy way editing with this combination. The PAR WILL sync
without problems, but you won't be able to play different projects syncing to
one audio-track without some arexx programming. This means you will always
have to "render" your edits on the PAR (having all the different pieces put
after one another physically on te drive in one big file), before being able
to do some sync playing.
Then of course, you still have to edit your audio-stuff to represent the
changes you have made in your video material. As I allready said, no easy way
to edit. Great though to have some piece of video footage replaced by CGI and
see how it interacts with the audio.

The AREXX feature of Studio16 doesn't work for me. I don't know if this is a
global problem or if it's just my setup. However, this means I have to relie
on external AREXX-scripts and cannot use an AREXX-track from within Studio16.

Maybe someone out there has some info about this?

My AD516 the ram chips are not socketed, the only chip socketed is an EPROM
which probably contains some firmware, so it wouldn't be an easy upgrade.
:)

And that 128k is 128k words, which means 256k bytes.

I seem to remember in the original Sunrize propoganda some information
about being able to expand the AD516 RAM upwards of 1 meg.

With the current software, I doubt there would be any gain in having more
RAM on the board.

Thanks, it pretty much confirmed what I figured out last nite as I did a
sort of
storyboard editing session on paper and what it would entail.
Now don't take this the wrong way (we ALL make simple mistakes)
BUT, is your AREXX startup in your WB-startup folder?
(ducking for cover if this was obvious to you ;-)
Without the arexx handler (from AmigaOS not the AD516) in the wb-startup
drawer, no arexx port will be listened to or sent commands.
You mentioned having to use external arexx scripts so I can sort of assume
that the arexx startup is in your WB-startup drawer after all.

Why does the AD516 board have jumper settings for interupts?  Shouldn't the
Zorro autoconfig handle that?

The AD516 already has 256k (2 x 128k chips, I think) of RAM, and is not considered
upgradeable. These RAM upgrades only concern the AD1012.

The new CrossDOS version 7 handles this.

Hello Greenboy. I've been silent for some time but I do read this
ml daily (I consider this a part of my job since a couple of months).


Everything is fine here. We're busy working on AudioLab16 marketing
and ProStation completion.

ProStation prototype step2 is screaming on Hydra since late February
(Hydra is the nickname for one of the A4000s here, featuring a 68060,
a PPC604 and a DSP56002).

AudioLabs will provide PPC accelerated software modules dedicated to
audio works, in the forthcoming months.

At this stage we're using Delfina hardware for audio I/O but support
for most ZII/ZIII boards is planned via our driver protocol.

I've contacted dr. Fuller regarding the AD516 driver, as you suggested.
Still no news on this.




On another theme... In order to share large amounts of data among
various enviroments, I'm planning to mount 5 1/4 frames for removable
IDE HDs on every machine here.

Is there any software that lets AmigaOS handle long names a-la Win95,
when mounting MS-DOS formatted volumes? Any experience in this field?




All the best,

dr. Maurizio Ciccione
AudioLabs, Digital Audio Engineering

Nope, I don't start AREXX from the WB-startup, but from S:User-Startup:    

;BEGIN REXX
   Rexxmast >NIL:
;END REXX

This way I can allready execute some Arexx scripts before WB-Startup.
(Like checking wich SCSI-devices are present and choosing how to set up the
system accordingly).

Yep, you guessed right.

He guys, am I the only one who can't use the Arexx-track feature from
Studio16? It would seriously help me a lot if I got this to work... THEN
integrating PAR/Studio16/B&P/ScalaMM would get a lot easier. I know... It
could be done from one of the other applications Arexx hosts, but then I can't
just put a script on the time-line and shift it just a few seconds to see if
it looks better.

It is best if Rexxmast is later in the user-startup than any "path
add" statements. I recently moved mine to the end of the user-startup
for this reason. You could try putting Rexxmast and the scripts that
you use at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps you could issue ARexx commands from B&P? This
gives you the same time control.

i'm going to whine about my a2000T here for a second.

i've wanted an 040 for some time now - i've been really feeling bogged
down by my 030 derringer -  a setup that is fully functioning, albeit a
bit on the slow side.

anyways, about a month ago, i bought an RCS Fusion Forty from a guy on the
net.  it was dead on arrival.  argh.  back to the derringer. figured i'd
try again.  bought a progressive peripherals and software 040.  this time
it worked.  sort of. . .

so here's my problem:

the PPS 040 needs to have 2 megs of its ram put in the amiga's autoconfig
memory space, for ideal speed.  if i set the board up like that, and boot
with that 2 megs, plus 6 off my GVP series II hard drive controller,
everything works ok, although not quite as fast i had hoped.

naturally, though, i'd like to be able to access the other 30 megs of ram
on the accelerator.  as soon as i mount that ram however, studio 16 chokes
and can only play four tracks.  playing more crashed the machine.  the
meters are noticably "jumpy", not attenuating smoothly at all.  weirdly, i
didn't notice many, if any problems with other software. 

i've tried nearly everything.  different SIMMS, every possible
combination, a different hard drive controller, yadda yadda yadda.  i also
tried the stock C= 68040.library as opposed to the PPS 68040.library
(didn't seem to make a difference).  the libs and utils on the disc that
came with the PPS are dated 1991 (!).  is this stuff not going to work
with my 3.1 setup?

does anyone use one of these boards?

I remember something like this coming up in the list, but I can't find
it specifically in my old emails...

For the first time I am trying to record my mixer levels when I play
back...one at a time,  but as I try to fade them down, I get the sound
dropping out when the level display on the fader changes 

i.e. from -10 to -10 1/2

I do hold down the mouse button all the time while I am playing through
the tracks until the end (it is a :30 sec spot)

Help!

Thanks- Ben A.

IF you place rexxmast with icon in the Wbstartup it wil be loaded after
de user-startup files.
And you do not have to do some typing in the script, just copy it to the
Wbstartup directory.

For the sync of Scala and Studio16, record a sample of SMPTE timecode with
a samplerate as low as possible (mem-saving).
Let Scala play the SMPTE-Sample, and connect one of the Amiga audioports with
the SMPTE Input of your AD516.
An audio-patchbay is a must when you use the audioport of the Amiga
for other functions, like sample editing with Audiolab or play games.
I use this method for a long time and it works great when you  put
some Synced Audio and Video signal to a VideoTape.

For the sync of Bars en Pipes and Studio16, load the SunSet assesoire within
Bars and Pipes,B&P and Studio16 in one Window and synced.

For the sync of PAR and Studio16, i believe they are internally SMPTE-synced.

I think it is a problem when you use them all at the same time because of
the Amiga CPU-power.
Bars & Pipes and Scala use a lot of Chipmem.

I have Scala runnin on an A4000/040 and Studio16/B&P running on an A3000, synced
together via the SMPTE sample ,works great for me.

Sorry to be the one to break the news, but this is a zorro II SCSI problem.
I ran into this when I put a DKB 2632 w/24MB on my A2630 accellerator.
Your SCSI controller cannot access the memory on the PPS board using DMA
because it is out of the Zorro II (8MB) address space. Instead, it must use
it's built in routines for doing a PIO (Programmed IO) transfer. I don't know
how good the GVP is at doing this. GURU ROMs were supposed to improve PIO
when it was needed. I hope it's better than my A2091, because it breaks the
SCSI transfer into tiny parcels (128 byte, I think) and buffers this in
chip mem. Needless to say throughput slows to a near halt and SCSI throughput
is the AD516's bloodstream.

There are some software programs on aminet that do better buffering than the
built in routines and make normal tasks (loading programs, saving files, etc.)
happen at reasonable speeds on an 030 (and hopefully even better on an 040).
Unfortunately for me, that extra step still put enough of a strain on the
CPU that I still couldn't use Studio16 with my 2632's expanded memory. If
I did, I results similar to yours. Perhaps an 040 will handle software
buffering better. I think the name of the program I had the best luck with
was "DMA". I had to revert to not configuring my extra accellerator memory when
I used Studio16 (a poor compromise). If you can recover your 2 megs of
autoconfigure RAM and not configure the extra RAM, you may see a performance
difference. I used a branching startup script which gave me the choice to boot
with the extra memory and buffering software or autoconfig RAM only with no
buffering software. Having to give up that RAM anytime you use Studio16 was
a poor option, but the only one for me.

I also tried a PIO SCSI controller (a DKB spitfire) but it required so much CPU
use that Studio16 still would die at 4 tracks or less. It seems that the only
accellerators with on board expandable memory that will work in a zorro II
Amiga with Studio16 are those that also have an onboard SCSI controller (like
a Zeus).

Also on aminet, there is an excellent FAQ on your accellerator that tells how
to use more current software to replace the old PPS software with better
results. Just search PPS or PPI. My hope for you is that an 040 will have
just enough horsepower to get your software buffered SCSI going well enough
to work with Studio16. (OK, so I'm being optimistic...)

Good Luck!!

But the enquirer wanted to run some ARexx scripts in his user-startup,
so he would have to have Rexxmast in front of them.

Good idea, thanks. This audio signal could also be converted to MTC by
an external box such as the PhilipRees TS1, I think.

Ha, but that would make my setup completely worthless. As I explained earlier,
I use Arexx very soon in the Startup-Sequence to check for some hardware (and
some key-presses). I use this because I regularly change the configuration
(external harddisks, cdrom-writer, scanner, tapedrive, Jazdrive). The scripts
I use configure my A4000/060 in a different way (other assigns, loading of
specific drivers, etc).
To use Arexx this early is no problem, you just have to run Rexxmast as soon
as possible. I don't believe that any path-troubles are causing Studio16 to
completely ignore its Arexx-tracks.

Still, noone has given a definitive answer if this feature is working for
them. So I'll ask once again: Can somebody confirm that the Arexx-track
feature of Studio16 works for them? Please, especially check it's
communication with external Arexx-hosts (other programs).

Syncing is no problem at all. Scala can internally sync to the AD516's SMPTE
(there's a special EX to do this). But what I want to do is use Studio16 to be
able to edit audio AND PAR-video from one and the same interface. It would be
VERY handy if I could get this working. Using Bars and Pipes is not an option
to do this kind of thing, as I would have to write TWO programs, one for the
PAR and one for Studio16.

this won't really work for me.  i've developed a system of keeping

In the scala mm400 manual, it says that there is a sunrize EX that you can
buy.  I can't seem to find it in the book right now.  It doesn't say much.  I
don't know if it supports SMPTE or not.  Has anybody seen or used this ex?

I just heard about this a couple weeks ago too. I wrote Scala in the UK
and the 
official responce was that it was only available to INfochannel users. I
didn't like
that answer but what can you do.

I have used it a few times.  I seem to remember it just lets you play, wait
for a sample to finish playing, or stop a playing sample.  Nothing fancy.

Look in the menu options (it's the one all the way to the right), for an option
called "Use Mixer Levels", or "Use Mixers", or some such. Click the option on, and
you should be able to use them without being reset all the time, and without
having to hold onto the mouse.

>>> Ben Avechuco <avechuco@netzone.com> 13/03/98 04:38am >>>
I remember something like this coming up in the list, but I can't find
it specifically in my old emails...

For the first time I am trying to record my mixer levels when I play
back...one at a time,  but as I try to fade them down, I get the sound
dropping out when the level display on the fader changes 

i.e. from -10 to -10 1/2

I do hold down the mouse button all the time while I am playing through
the tracks until the end (it is a :30 sec spot)

Help!

Thanks- Ben A.

Yes it will work,i even synced a Betacam Sp and DigiBeta with it.
But beware the samplerate, degrade the sample to a samplerate as low as
possible.
I have about 10 minutes of SmPte Audio-signal in a 4 mB sample-file.

Succes,

Please excuse my butting in, but I would also like to try out that EX.
I'd really appreciate it if you sent me a copy too.

Hi Floyd... 

Your in luck... I use the PP&S accelerator, and I have used it with the
AD516 & Studio16....

My setup has 32MB of RAM on the accelerator itself, and 4MB on my DKB
SCSI controller. This works great... I can get 6 tracks, sometimes 7
tracks playback.

The jumpy meters is something you are gonna have to put up with I'm
afraid... I believe this is caused by the 16bit Zorrow two bus that is
used by your hard drive controller & AD516. On a 3000 or 4000, the Hard
drive is on a 32bit bus, which frees up IO for the AD516.

I think as long as you don't fill up the Hard Drive controller with a
full 8MB, you should be fine. I use the PP&S 68040 library with no
problems.

Hope this helps...

Gord

PLEASE: DON'T ANNOUNCE ON A PUBLIC M-LIST THAT YOU HAVE A PIECE OF
COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE (Scala Sunrize EX) THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO EMAIL
OUT!!! (You will notice that almost all commercial software releases
have that "one owner-one computer" clause in the front of the manual.)

You people asking for it: BUY THE DAMNED THING!!! Or contact the
developer for a demo or something. The developer does not appreciate
abandoning a platform because a living cannot be scraped out there.

I know piracy exists but I would rather not continue to see a variation
of it on our m-list. Please ­ KILL THE AMIGA PLATFORM VIA PRIVATE EMAIL
if you don't understand or care what is at stake here.

Greenboy,
                 For your information, another user of this mailing list had
already contacted SCALA UK and was told that because they no longer 
supported the AMIGA he was FREE to get it from anybody that had it! 
I had it and let him and anybody else who wanted it have it! I like you 
do NOT support computer software piracy. Just trying to help out!
Hope this clears things up as I don't take kindly to being accused of
being a software pirate or words of a similar meaning!

what software do you use to set up the 040/ram?

strange.  the meters are silky smooth (or at least FAR less jumpy) with my
030 derringer. course, it has a DMA conflict problem, so 6 tracks are
possible, usually, on a good day.

hm.  nutty.  i guess i'll try again.  i had to put my 030 back in to get
some real work done this weekend.

thanks.

It's not that simple. Actually, I already owned the EX but I had lost
it - found it again just after I received a copy.
BUT a few weeks ago I needed another EX for Scala. I called Scala UK.
I was told "We no longer supply Amiga software." I said "Can't you
just mail this to me?" "No, find someone who has it and get it off
them." 
They did not want to know about Amiga users, and they didn't care
about EXs being spread.
Since then a German distributor (Nightshift) has started selling Scala
400 on CD, without the dongle protection.

If SCALA has indicated they blew off the Amiga, lets make it common
knowledge, and make sure everyone gets the EXs they want.

More power to you. I did not realize that SCALA had given the go-ahead.
I sure haven't seen an announcement anywhere.

Did I accuse you of something? I sure don't remember singling anyone out.
Sorry!

Hey Don, thanks for clarifying. Now I too want the EX, and all that other
great Scala stuff I never bought when I could've. <Sigh> Another GREAT
developer down the drain...?

==============================================================================
Let me state a couple of things:
1. I wanted to TRY it. If it worked, I was going to try to PURCHASE it.
2. Further emails to this list state SCALA won't be bothered by Amigans wanting to buy anything from them, so I'm now keeping the thing regardless.
3. SCALA sucks for abadoning the Amiga. They probably go home at night and figure out ways to poison their own mothers. Who brought them into this world, hmm? AMIGA!
4. As for your rapid (and nearly rabid) vigilant responses to point out the potential piratical misconduct... Keep it up! Even though I really was going to try to "buy the damned thing", the messages back and forth probably STANK of piracy. I will endeavor to be much clearer about my intentions in the future.
5.   BTW I bought and paid for SCALA, upgraded ($) it to MM400 and bought all their background art disks. They still bailed on the Amiga. You say "The developer does not appreciate abandoning a platform because a living cannot be scraped out there". I say they had no guts and jumped for the easy bucks on the big bloated PC bandwagon. They could of at least tried to do both platforms. I heartily agree we should all support the developers by buying, not stealing, but it pisses me off that they STILL leave anyway. This is a serious test of faith now. Can we hold on to enough developers until the hardware catches up?

Sorry this has so little to do with Studio16.

PLEASE: DON'T ANNOUNCE ON A PUBLIC M-LIST THAT YOU HAVE A PIECE OF
COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE (Scala Sunrize EX) THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO EMAIL
OUT!!! (You will notice that almost all commercial software releases
have that "one owner-one computer" clause in the front of the manual.)

You people asking for it: BUY THE DAMNED THING!!! Or contact the
developer for a demo or something. The developer does not appreciate
abandoning a platform because a living cannot be scraped out there.

I know piracy exists but I would rather not continue to see a variation
of it on our m-list. Please ­ KILL THE AMIGA PLATFORM VIA PRIVATE EMAIL
if you don't understand or care what is at stake here.

Any comments on QMaster ?

Here is last update from my part on the CMX script converter. It's fully
possible to create a 100% capable converter, but I would need FCM/CMX
equipmnent to do so - so anyone interrested have to do it themselved from
now on.. this is probably my last part on anything conserning Studio 16.

	$VER: CMXtoCUE.rexx 1.5 (19.03.98)
	Copyright © 1998 by Kenny Nilsen/Digital Surface

	USAGE: rx CMXtoCUE [<cuelist> <destcuefile>]

	This script will TRY to convert a CMX edit decission list file into
	a Studio 16 Cuelist. This script require QMASTER 1.2 or better.

	I have implemented a simple database search mechanism. It allow
	you to select one or more directories with Studio 16 samples. The
	SMPTE timecode of the samples are used as Source In trigger.
	If no samples are found it puts an empty entry (1 second) on the
	cuelist so you can pop in a sample later.

	The script is currently configured for NTSC, but by changing the video
	system name below you can configure it for PAL. You can also make it
	autodetect the video system.

	This is it from my part on the CMX list. I don't have access to FCM/CMX
	equipment so I am programming in the dark really. If you create a CMX
	converter script let me know. This script is no longer supported by me.

	Note that all errors are trapped, therefor no error checking after
	comands.

	Bugs:
	  probably plenty - it's limited and not well structured. Read comments
	  above.

Hi Wayne,

I would be interested in trying out the studio16 EX for Scala to see if it
is any practical use to studio16 users

Thanks Kenny for all the Work you have done for the Studio16 software.

I like using Q-master a lot, and i am trying to write some arexx scripts
myself.
I like the function when you change a project to another harddisk the script
changes all the old HD-names to the new one, great.
Saves me a lot of time.
I use the script when i am doing a project and an other project comes in between.
I save the project to a Jaz-drive and let q-master do the cuelist-rescripting.

My registration form for q-master is on it's way.
I Think al the users of this list must registrate Q-master.

I hope you will give studio16 some support in the future and keep it alive for
some time.


SeeYaa



BTW, look at my homepage for some projects i have done with the studio16.

It IS usefull, you can use the Ad516 with Scala, so you can now use 16bit samples
instead of the 8 bits from the Amiga.

It is not like syncing, just play samples with Scala via the Ad516.

It Works.

For syncing, i use a SMPTE sample, played by Scala.

Then connect Amiga Audio output with SMPTE-IN and YOOO, synced together.

Hi Rene,

Thanks for the info on the Scala EX. Wayne was kind enough to send me a
copy. 

I agree that it's limited, and to use the SMPTE sync it would be necessary
to record a sample of SMPTE TC & play it as a sample playing into the SMPTE
In input on the AD516.  

I do this at the moment from video decks & from my VLabMotion nonlinear
editing system. What I would like to do is run Scala, VLabMotion & Studio16
all in sync.

This is not possible as neither Scala nor VLabMotion will lock to external
timecode (each has to be the Master). The AD516 can of course be either
Master or Slave as it has a built in chase lock synchronizer.

Probably a better solution for me would be to send arexx commands from
Scala's interface to MovieShop's arexx port (VLabMotion's Software) to send
Play & Stop Movieshop's timeline on which I run a SMPTE TC track to
Studio16' SMPTE IN.

There is nothing in Scala that has to precisely synchronize.  Have you had
a look at Kenny's QMaster arexx port for Studio16? 

I like the work that he has done & am racking my brain to find practical
applications for the all the time & effort that he has put into this
software to extend the usefulness of our studio16 cards.

Have you found a way that the power of QMaster can usefully be utilized by
an external program?  My fear is that most people on the list are baffled
as to what QMaster is & have not explored how it can be used.

My mastery of arexx is practically zero at the moment. So unless a master
of arexx like Don Cox can come up with some practical scripts, QMaster may
not be the wonderful extension to Studio16 Kenny envisioned.

The lack of a graphical interface is probably the main reason for the less
than overwhelming response to Kenny's work.

Possibly Scala could be the  graphic interface for QMaster, many of us
already have the program & those who don't can easily get it as it was
provided in a dongle free version on CU Amiga a couple of months back.

Hi Wayne,

Thanks a million for the Scala Ex. It's nice to be able to play Studio16
samples from scala rather than being limited to 8 bit samples. 

Unfortunately, as Rene points out the EX is only capable of playing &
stopping studio16 samples and not syncing with studio16 cuelist timeline
which is what most studio16 users would have wished from the scala Ex.

A studio16Play arexx command sent to the studio16 arexx port studio16.1
would seem to accomplish this. Kenny can probably overcome this shortcoming
by writing a studio16 cuelist play arexx script for his QMaster arexx port
for studio16.

I'm trying hard to find uses for Kenny's QMaster program as I see it as a
major effort to extend the usefulness of studio16.  

Hopefully Mauritzio's AudioLab program will be able to make use of Kenny's
marvelous effort and extend the usefulness of both programs.

My Syjet drive (external) occasionally seems to lock up my system. Have you
had any problems. Maybe a termination problem, or perhaps when I get a
Cyberstorm mark 111 with the ultra scsi the problem will disappear.

I am waiting on the release of the PPC Cybergraphics card to get this
accelerator into my A3000.

Does anyone know of any software that would be good for creating a diagram of studio setup? I have so much gear now that it's getting hard to remember what is patched into where. If I could create a diagram for quick reference, that would be helpful.

Unfortunately QMaster can't be used to control the Cuelist editor, only the
cuelist /files/. However, the Studio 16's arexx interface provide functions
to obtain this IIRC.

Many thanks. I think you're right however, it's difficult on finding areas
QMaster can be useful. I think it would include many software packages to be
useful and an extended interrest in arexx.

My intentions with QMaster was to allow automated processes where Studio 16
played a keyrole.

To describe what I mean: lets say you work in a radio station (just for an
example). You use SuperBase to store all the records and information on each
tune with start time/length, cue, cathegory etc. In another database you
have opinions, lists, sales numbers etc. to find out what song is most
popular. With QMaster you could produce different programs automatically. An
arexx script could search Superbase's databases for songs and ratings, then
feed QMaster with pointers to the samples or even have MakeCD or something
else to dump the tunes from CD down to HD, or copy from another HD for this
program and then have QMaster to produce a Cuelist for Studio 16. The data
could also be fed to Final Writer to produce a playlist for the show with
times, comments etc. Using Scala or Infochannel you could sync the cuelists
by creating a scala lingo script so that the programs got cued up and
triggered with SMPTE or similar (like with the SMPTE LTC sample trick
someone else mentioned on this list).

In another case you could make a program with popular disco tunes from the
70's and do the same process and have the script to pick tunes randomly from
the 70's and in the disco-cathegory. Room for voiceover could be timed and a
envelope file for the mixers could be produced etc. etc.

Just a tiny example to give an idea of what its intention is.

The scripts would be very local oriented and probably of little use for
somebody else than for the person who wrote it, but that shouldn't matter
since you now have access to automate much stuff and save time (=money).
Maybe there are already written much software to specific do these
operations, I don't know, but if someone lack access to this power QMaster
could be a keyplayer in such an environment IMO.

Arexx knowledge is a "problem" and as you and others say it would be easier
to use with a GUI interface. Unfortunately I don't see time for me to
create this in near future, but other persons on this list have told they
work on this problem so maybe we will see something soon.

The MIDI EX allows Scala 400 to lock its page turns (not its MIDI
music player, I think) to an external MIDI Time Code. I tested this a
while back with a reel of audio tape striped with SMPTE code plus a
PhilRees SMPTE-to-MIDI converter, and found that it worked in Scala
400 but not 300.

It seems that if you play a MIDI music file on Scala it ignores the
tempo of
the file.

At present I don't have an AD516 at home, only where I used to work,
and I am there one afternoon a week. As soon as I can afford it, an
AD516 is high on my list. Then I will very likely do something with
QMaster. But realistically, don't hold your breath.
I do need an AD516 as I have the PAR and Scala (bought) and B&P, so it
is the missing link.

I have just downloaded Gui4CLI, which is highly spoken of. This is
said to be an easy way to do a GUI for any software which expects a
CLI command with lots of options. The home page is 
users.hol.gr/~dck/gcmain.htm

Have a look.

Also the new licensed version of 400 from Nightshifts is dongle-free.

i'm still working on ideas for this, although i too am very busy.  i have
some preliminaries sorted out though.  i also built some GUIs for a few
utilities in the add16 package, mostly to help with CD mastering
processes.

i'd still like to hear about the ways some users on this list use these
programs, to help with ideas on the GUIs.

On the Amiga, I would go for a drawing package such as Draw Studio, or
possibly use the drawing tools in PageStream3.
There's a PC program called Visio which has had very good reviews for
this kind of job, but I haven't tried it myself. It costs much more
than Draw Studio.

Probably any flow chart or CAD program would work but if things are getting complex in your studio you should really get a patch bay or three.  That way you can always see what is patched where at a glance.

If you want some quick 'n dirty box making capabilities with simple text, you can
look towards vectored drawing programs. This way, you can rescale your box sizes
as you see fit.

For this type of stuff, I use ProVector (vector-based program), WordWorth (word
processor), and PageStream (desk top publishing).

There are a couple of other progs that do similiar things such as Gui4Cli.
Which does a fine job. MuiRexx, write arexx progs with mui gui. Very nice
prog. CARexx, which is still in alpha, but will do the same as MuiRexx, but
uses the ClassAct gadgets instead of mui.

I have used all these progs, each has it's own strengths.

I wanted to check out Kenny's prog. I would lend my services in making a gui
for Kenny's prog but I don't have the time. :-(

One of the best apps of this type I've seen was just recently uploaded
to aminet. It is on paderborn in the recent uploads now. It is powerful
and can launch multiple copies with different names of itself. It can
launch WB, CLI, or arexx commands via buttons or icons. It is drag and
drop congigurable and can be put on any screen. Its called URB and it
is very powerful and useful. It would be perfect for somthing like
this. Also, just in passing another app recently uploaded to Aminet
is M2I. It you like toolmanager which you have used for years, you'll
love M2I. It is also drag and drop congigurable and can also launch
any type of app via icons, text or buttons. Both are very nice stable
apps. URB however would be better suited in regards to the post. Check
the both out..they are nice.

I was wondering where could one obtain the source code for Studio 16 and
it's related apps.  It seems like I heard that the developers of the
software don't want to release the source code, but aren't interested in
developing it any further either. Why don't they license it to someone
or to a group to develop further? I suppose a person could reverse
engineer the software, but then the original developer loses out. I sure
would like to see some development for the AD516. It is  a fine piece of
hardware.

I remember hearing the same along those lines.  It's a sad
state of affairs that also has kept development of an AHI
module for the Sunrise boards at a nil: ;-)
The developers would not/could not? release the specs
of the board for device level programming.
Imagine how well AHI would operate on the AD516
which has more on-board ram than the current crop
of audio boards.

Along those lines, has anyone ever seen any modules
to provide the mythical real time wave effects that
the AD516 is capable of? key word here being
REAL TIME effects

I sure would like to see this library come into reality. Perhaps Don Cox
might be able to tell us if this might be achieveable.

Try using ProVector, the structured drawing package. I'd use a structured
program because it allows you to easily modify and duplicate items. Plus it
has layers capabilities which would allow you to do a floor plan on one layer,
components on another, electrical on another, etc., then hide any layer if you
only wanted to see one.

A note to Kenny, thanks for your work. I'm sorry I've been so busy for the
past few months that I haven't had the time to try any of your software, but I
appreciate having access to it and this mail list and truly appreciate all the
information and effort you've shared.

Hi dhomas,

Just a note to check in with you. I know you've been busy. How are the
VlabMotion experiments going? I've just got a couple of more small bugs to
work out of my system it seems.

I haven't been able to access the net for long periods at a time because I
am currently having to call long distance and cannot afford to surf.

That's about to change 'cause I got another local account here in the
mountains. I'll mail you when I get it set up within the next couple of
days.

Corresponding to Frederick and getting Studio16.thule stuff daily.

I just wanted to know where I could get copies of your article to read. I
won't be able to cruise the Deja News until I get my new account set up.

Regards,

Brian

Hi Dave,

Believe me I know what you're going through.

I have been told that all it would take is to get the autodocs for the
studio.library and then a good coder could make a patch to the
toccata.library (autodocs on Aminet).

I have since early December sold my VlabMotion because a Broadcaster Elite
board
fell into my lap for cheap so I can't really be of any help here. I'm in
the throes of networking my Studio16/Broadcaster/Toaster machines now and I'm
almost there.

Although I can forward this to someone who maybe could help out a little.

I don't remember anyone posting about the following program. 
So forgive me if it is a repeat.

AsimWare @ http://www.asimware.com produces Audio Thunder.  It can
convert between and support the following audio formats: CDDA, Flyer,
Studio16, MAUD, AIFF, 8SVX, and WAV.

The program is aimed at the Amiga-Flyer system but I was happy to see
the Studio16 support.

Draw Studio also has layers, so either of these would do.

Only if you work at a _very_ high resolution. Even at 800x600 you will
end up with nasty bitmappy lettering when you print from a paint
program. A drawing package will give clean, clear lettering.

Just a comment,

Audio Thunder hasn't been updated in a year and a half.  I don't think it
is even listed as an active product anymore.  Also, it doesn't set the
panning when you split a stereo file.  But other than that, it is an OK
program.  :)

It looks like it as been absorbed (or at least a major part of it) into
MasterISO v2.

Visit http://www.asimware.com.  I just recently received both Audio
Thunder and MasterISO v2.

MasterISO will "convert audio files from any supported audio file
format to CDDA.  The audio is stored as a 16 bit stereo sample,
sampled at 44100 Hz."  BTW if the CPU is up to it MasterISO can do
this in real time.

ASIMWare is currently actively marketing both programs.

I've read of some people playing a sample of SMPTE to sync studio16 to scala. 
Here's a better way.
Instead of Scala controlling Studio16, have Studio16 control Scala!
I've noticed that after you load the studio16 EX, if you go to scala's system
menu then go to the timeing menu, you will see "Studio16 timeing"!
With this you can time scala's grafix to studio16....But, don't use scala to
play the sounds, as we all found out, IT SUCKS!!!  instead use scala just for
the grafix, use the cue list for the sounds.

I haven't tryed it yet, because i can't get both programs to run togetter!!! 
:(  maybe because i only have 12 megs of ram.

Hi Dan,

this works excellent.

This is how I do it to make them co-operate:

1) (WB)  First I start Studio 16

2) (CLI) Then I run Studio16_3:c/StudioOpen >nil:
3) (WB)  ScalaMM

All tools are run from a Toolsdeamon menu, Studio 16 seperate. I haven't
tried without StudioOpen yet, but I guess it won't matter. I have included
StudioOpen because I sometimes run samples from within Scala without Studio
16 main program running and if I don't run it Scala will complain about a
Studio: assign (I use Studio16_3: for latest version of Studio16).

Hope this can help.


- Kenny

The best investment I have made for my Amigas has been RAM. I now have
64Meg in both and it is really good to be able to handle large images
and multitask without running out. For processing very large scans or
the best size of PhotoCD image, even more would help.
Also, being able to handle a 30Meg WAV file downloaded from an audio
CD is handy.
Although an Amiga _will_ work with less RAM than a Mac, it still works
better with plenty.

Hi all!
While trying to create visuals to show what OAsys would look like, I
have been thinking about what kind of interface is best for music
composition programs.

So I am collecting opinions, both yours and any (possibly non-Amiga
using) colleagues/friends. Serious or professional musicians, please
tell me:

For an imaginary program which would do much the same things as
Cubase, would you prefer 
1. A colorful, sculptural interface (like
Kai's power tools or Power Goo) 
2. Slightly 3D with some color (like
Bars&Pipes) 
3. Plain and efficient style Black-and-white like Cubase
on an Atari
4. Or what?

Do you have any particular likes/dislikes in the interfaces to music
programs on any platform?
Is lots of windows (OctaMED SS, Studio16) OK or do you want a single
display
(MusicX)?
Are you fussy about typefaces?

BTW OAsys is a proposal for an enhanced interface for the Amiga
generally, put forward by some ICOA people.

Thanks

With studio16 3.01, you are suppose to be able to see the sample names being played in the mixer module. There is a space there for it, but mine never ever displays it. It becomes very difficult to remember which sample is playing on which channel, esp. when you have two boards and have a possible 16 channels.

I've noticed when you play a sample in the sample editor, it shows up then, but not from the cue list.

Any suggestions?

I use 2 Computers, one for Scala and one for Audio, thats why i use the
SMPTE sample.

BTW, Sunrize has made the SMPTE-out software, is it possible to trigger this
program by Scala.
This program gives you SMPTE OUT on the Amiga Audio port.
By my meening, the software has NO Arexx-port.

For short sounds you can use Scala, a Click-Button Sound gives no problem,
even if you have 12 mb of Mem.
Beware the sample-rate and length of the sample.

Only one point I'd like to partake in and that is I think all Amiga programs
should be font sensitive (I just hate that Topaz font) XHelvetica is by
far my best font and I use it wherever I can!

Can't be achieved in a non-hack way..

Though, IF the gadget system used by Studio 16 does read intui messages
(meaning it doesn't read the hardware for mouse buttons as I suspect it to
do since you can't press leftAmiga+alt to simulate left mousebutton) you
could make a small hack that sent the SMPTEOutput window a 'fake' message
on its IDCMP port with x and y coordinates set and an IDCMP message telling
the left mousebutton was pushed. This mean you need to calculate window
width/height to find the play(/stop) button since the window can be scaled.

This hack also applies to the 'Use mixer levels' for the Cuelist (someone
wanted a patch for this IIRC..). Send a "menu hot" message instead.

(sorry for the techy contents for non-developers)

Must have lots of keyboard support. DON'T force me to use the mouse.
Try to use standard keystrokes.

A few logically laid out windows. Too many is a mess. Trying to do one
single window usually fails.

Just avoid a serif font. Clean like Helvetica is the way to go.

Of course this is purely my dream interface, but I would
like to see a bitmap style interface. Total graphics.
Like a gif map. Detailed track, smpte and sample details could open
aditional windows or screens, but the main interface would
look like control buttons laid over a map of some kind for
visual effect. Too many programs just have windows and fonts.
Give me some thing nice to look at. Put us in the mood to make
music instead of the same 'ol computer operator routine.

I believe that would be too cryptic for a sequencer/scorer. The gimmick
works for PowerGoo because it replaces a limited set of (menu) commands
and the manipulation that takes place is mainly input by mouse. PowerGoo
is mainly just a slick morphing program, and a sequencer/scorer is
perhaps analagous to a imageproc/paint program in complexity.

> 2. Slightly 3D with some color (like Bars&Pipes)
> 3. Plain and efficient style Black-and-white like Cubase Atari

A colorful 3D program with multi-windowing and a high degree of
interface configurability is the best bet. This would include the
choices of color in the display, windows with movable gadgetry ala MUI
apps (IBrowse, YAM), windows that have expanded and contracted views for
different functional areas (like Nutscrape Messenger, FI).

I prefer different windows for different modes of use, preferably that
could even be promoted to their own public screens. A graphical selector
bar could toggle between screens (or bring sleeping windows to surface).
One of the menu headers could be WORKSTYLE, and would show all currently
saved window/screen configurations including gadget states, collapsed
areas if any, and assignable keyboard setups.

The program would be shipped with a set of these WORKSTYLES that
intelligently addressed different needs and levels of expertise. The
default WORKSTYLE in the shipped version would allow for a very fast--as
painless as possible--learning curve for all the basic needs.

An ARexx-accessing macro recorder (and editor) along the lines of the
beauties found in ImageFX or PageStream--with logical functions (ADD,
AND, OR, XOR, etc)--available would allow the design and exchange of
plugins.

Of course, common and not so common musical functions such as
arpeggiation, metric manipulation, time-stretch, feel, transpose, and
chord-voicing (love those guitar voicings available in B&P!), centered
and non-centered inversion would also be achievable, and capable of
being chained, and assigned to gadget icons.

An auto-compiler module would be available to make opaque code from that
arexx. The compiled tools would run faster, for situations that
warranted it. This would also allow third-party developers some
additional security.

All midi editing functions would be accessible during playback/
recording. All graphic editing windows would be qualifier-linked to
value-displaying windows of the same data, and would autoscroll and
value-change in synchronization.

Well, that's enough for now. If I am even answereing the question you
asked. See you, Don.

M i k e , 

I'm going to try to reply to this mailing list message. It'll be a first
for me.

Re your little survey -- I like the standard Amiga style/B&P Pro color
along with well thought out keyboard shortcuts.

I hope this works or else I'll just be a reader only.

Congrats, charles! Good to see!

B&P was/is great in many ways but other sequencers allow one to work
quicker on many types of projects. But when you want to really be
creative, the Tools get you far and fast! Practically like working with
algorythmic progs, but it actually allows CONTROL.

The lack of a screenmode requester is annoying, though at least it has
TOOLTYPES for some larger-display functioning.

Hi Charles,

Looks like it worked fine!    I've chatted with you a couple times on the
Compuserve Amiga forums, how's tricks? ;-)

Hi Don....

Personally I prefer the interface style used by Studio16.... Very straight forward, but nice to look at too. I find the Bars&Pipes interface too cluttery for my taste. Lots of color can be nice though, if used properly!
