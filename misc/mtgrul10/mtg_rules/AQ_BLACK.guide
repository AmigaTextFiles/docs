@node ARTIF "Artifact Possession"

@{b}Artifact Possession@{ub}

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(C4)
Type    = Enchant Artifact
Cost    = 2B
Artist  = Christopher Rush

Text(AQ): Artifact Possession does 2 damage to target artifact's controller
          each time target artifact is tapped or its activation cost is
          paid. Has no effect if cast on a continuous artifact.

Flavor Text: @{i}Any black mage could coax a Thraxodemon to
             inhabit a magical device.@{ui}

@{b}Gate to Phyrexia@{ub}

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(U3)
Type    = Enchantment
Cost    = BB
Artist  = Sandra Everingham

Text(AQ): Sacrifice one of your creatures during your upkeep to destroy any
          one artifact. You may not sacrifice a creature that is already
          on its way to the graveyard.

Flavor Text: @{i}"The warm rain of grease on my face immediately made
              it clear I had entered Phyrexia."

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(U3)
Type    = Enchantment
Cost    = 3B
Artist  = Jeff A. Menges

Text(AQ): Each time an artifact in play is tapped or its activation cost is
          paid, Haunting Wind does 1 damage to that artifact's controller.
          Is not triggered by continuous artifacts.

Flavor Text: @{i}These devices lured so many spirits that sometimes
             entire battlefields would become haunted at once.@{ui}

@{b}Phyrexian Gremlins@{ub}

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(C4)
Type    = Summon Gremlins (1/1)
Cost    = 2B
Artist  = Amy Weber

Text(AQ): Tap Gremlins to tap an artifact. As long as Gremlins remain
          tapped and in play, that artifact does not untap as normal
          during its controller's untap phase. You may choose not to
          untap Gremlins during your untap phase.

@{b}Priest of Yawgmoth@{ub}

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(C4)
Type    = Summon Cleric (1/2)
Cost    = 1B
Artist  = Mark Tedin

Text(AQ): Tap to add an additional amount of black mana equal to target
          artifact's casting cost to your mana pool. This effect is played
          as an interrupt. Target artifact, which must belong to you, is
          discarded. This artifact cannot be one that is already on its
          way to the graveyard, and artifact creatures killed this way may
          not be regenerated.

@node XENIC "Xenic Poltergeist"

@{b}Xenic Poltergeist@{ub}

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(U3) / 4E(R) / 5E(R)
Type    = Summon Poltergeist (1/1)
Cost    = 1BB
Artist  = Dan Frazier (AQ/4E) / Mike Kerr (5E)

Text(5E): <T>: Until your next upkeep, target noncreature artifact is an
          artifact creature with power and toughness each equal to its
          total casting cost. (That artifact retains all of its original
          abilities.)

Text(4E): <T>: Target non-creature artifact becomes an artifact creature
          with power and toughness each equal to its casting cost. Target
          retains all original abilities. This change lasts until your
          next upkeep.

Text(AQ): Tap to turn non-creature artifact into an artifact creature with
          both power and toughness equal to its casting cost. This
          transformation lasts until your next upkeep; target retains
          all its original abilities as well.

Color   = Black
Rarity  = AQ(U1) / CR(U1)
Type    = Summon Demon (6/6)
Cost    = 4BB
Artist  = Sandra Everingham

Text(CR): Flying, first strike
          During your upkeep, sacrifice an artifact or Yawgmoth Demon deals
          2 damage to you. If Yawgmoth Demon deals damage to you in this
          way, tap it.

Text(AQ): Flying, first strike
          During your upkeep, choose one of your artifacts in play and
          place it in the graveyard, or Yawgmoth Demon becomes tapped and
          deals 2 points of damage to you. Artifact creatures destroyed in
          this way may not be regenerated.
