Text(AQ): Tap to draw a card from your library. Each time you use this
          ability, you must choose one of your artifacts in play and place
          it in the graveyard. This artifact cannot be one that is already
          on its way to the graveyard, and artifact creatures killed this
          way may not be regenerated.

Text(AQ): Search through your library for one artifact and immediately
          place it into play; also, choose any artifact in play that you
          control and place it in its owner's graveyard. If the new
          artifact has a casting cost greater than that of the discarded
          one, you must pay the difference or Transmute Artifact fails and
          both artifacts are discarded. Shuffle your library after playing
          this card.
