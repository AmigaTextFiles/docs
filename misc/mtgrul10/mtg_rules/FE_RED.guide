Flavor Text: @{i}"Brassclaws were typical Orcs - quick to laud their own

Flavor Text: @{i}The War Drums enabled Goblin and Orcish armies to
             crush the sparsely defended Dwarven cities.@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}When creating a new War Drum, Goblin designers sought
             out the highest quality skulls. Serra Angel skulls were
             most highly prized, although most acknowledged that the
             skull of the exotic Sea Serpent made for a richer tone.@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}"Defending the outer trenches, we strained our eyes in
              the darkness. All we could hear was the Drums' terrible
              pounding. Dobbs, on my right, broke first. Soon we were
              all heading for the walls."

              get them to fight!"
              ---General Khurzog@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}"Yeah, they're ugly, they desert in droves, and their

Flavor Text: @{i}Although models of courage for Orcs, the
             Veterans quickly learned to fear the swift
             justice of their Icatian enemies.@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}Unsuccessful in their early battle for Montford,
