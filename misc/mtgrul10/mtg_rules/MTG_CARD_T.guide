@node TABLE "Tablet of Epityr"

@{b}Tablet of Epityr@{ub}

  As errata, it is of type "Artifact" and not "Poly Artifact".
    [Encyclopedia Page 135]

  Only works when an artifact goes to the graveyard from play, not from a
    player's hand.  At that time, the card is not an artifact.  [bethmo]

  Can be used on itself.  It can trigger on its own death just like an
    animated Soul Net can. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

@endnode
@node TAKKL "Takklemaggot"

@{b}Takklemaggot@{ub}

  This spell is cast on a creature.  On the upkeep of the player controlling
    the creature, the creature gets a -0/-1 counter.  When the creature is
    destroyed (by the counters or any other means), the controller of the
    creature gets to place Takklemaggot on a creature of their choice.  If
    there are no creatures to put it on, then Takklemaggot becomes a simple
    enchantment. [Card Text]

  If the creature leaves play without going to the graveyard (via Unsummon
    or something like that), Takklemaggot is simply destroyed.
    [bethmo 08/23/94]

  Note that Takklemaggot is always "controlled" in the game sense by the
    player who cast it, even though decisions are being made by the player
    whose creature is affected. [Aahz 07/06/94]

  Moving Takklemaggot is not considered to be a spell or effect, so it can
    be moved onto creatures which cannot be targeted by spells and effects
    (such as Autumn Willow). [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 44]
    See the @{"Moving Enchantments" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MOVI} entry in the General Rulings.

  Does not treat itself as "just cast" when it moves to a new location.

  If the new target becomes illegal before this card gets there, then this
    card is buried. [bethmo 02/03/97]  This can happen if a mana source speed
    effect sacrifices the target.

  If it becomes a global enchantment during upkeep or before, it will apply
    the "do 1 damage" effect starting that turn. [Aahz 02/16/97]

  It moves to its controller's territory when it becomes a global enchantment
    and then damages the appropriate player from there.
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

@node TALRC "Talruum Champion"

@{b}Talruum Champion@{ub}

+ If a Root Spider blocks this card, the Root Spider still ends up with first
    strike.  This is because this card's "remove first strike" triggered
    ability is resolved before the Root Spider's "add first strike" triggered
    ability. [D'Angelo 10/13/97]

@endnode
@node TANGL "Tangle Kelp"

@{b}Tangle Kelp@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...last turn.  When Tangle Kelp comes into play,
    tap enchanted creature." [Encyclopedia Page 174]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLUE.guide/TANGL}

@endnode
@node TARIF "Tariff"

@{b}Tariff@{ub}

+ Since the choice involves comparing cards in play, the choice of creatures
    is made on resolution and not on announcement. [Aahz 09/09/97]

 @{" Card Information " link WL_WHITE.guide/TARIF}

@endnode
@node TAWCO "Tawnos's Coffin"

@{b}Tawnos's Coffin@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(3),(Tap): Select...".  It is of type "Artifact"
    and not "Mono Artifact". [Encyclopedia Page 135]

  See the @{"Tap and Hold Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_TAPH} entry in the General Rulings.

  The card in the Coffin acts as if it were phased out, with the exception
    that it will not come back into play at the beginning of untap like other
    phased out cards will.  The rulings as to what happens when the creature
    leaves or re-enters play, apply, however. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]  See the
    rulings on "Phasing" in the General Rulings for more information.

  Tawnos's Coffin differs from normal phasing in, in that the creature enters
    play with summoning sickness. [Aahz 11/07/96]  If a creature enters the 
    Coffin, then exits it during the same turn, it is still subject to 
    summoning sickness. [WotC Rules Team 04/12/95]

  If a creature enters the Coffin after an effect targets it, then exits
    before that effect resolves, then the creature is still "locked onto" by
    the targeted effect.  [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 61]

  The creature returns to play tapped.  It does not return to play and then
    tap afterwards. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]  (REVERSAL)

  The creature in the Coffin may not be selected (and returned to play) by
    the Ring of Ma'ruf artifact since the card is "out of play" and not "out 
    of the game". [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95] 

  If a creature stops being a creature after it enters the Coffin, it still 
    remains inside.  Examples include a Living Land or an Assembly Worker.

@{b}Tawnos's Wand@{ub}

  The second sentence should read "after the Wand is used" instead of

    resolution to make sure it is valid.

  The Antiquities version of this card made the creature blockable only by
    artifact creatures.  The Fourth Edition version makes the creature
    totally unblockable. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

    For example if a Fog Elemental attacks and you control a Teferi's Veil,
    you get to choose which of the "phase out" or "bury" effects happens first

  As errata, play the ability as an instant. [Mirage Page 4]

  In multiplayer games you can choose a different opposing player each time it
    is used. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a deck)
    for Classic (Type I) tournaments since 08/01/94 because it is only used in
    games for Ante.  Has always been on the Standard (Type II) banned list and

@node TERRO "Terror"

@{b}Terror@{ub}

  As errata, the Limited, Unlimited and Revised versions of this card should
    read "Bury target non-black, non-artifact creature." [Aahz 09/05/95]

  As with all targeted effects, the requirements for targeting are checked
    when declaring the effect and when resolving it.  So, if the creature
    is becomes a black or artifact creature after this spell is declared
    and before it is resolved, then the effect fizzles.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/TERRO}

@endnode
@node TETRA "Tetravus"

@{b}Tetravus@{ub}

  See the @{"Token Creatures" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_TOKE} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  When the counters are off the Tetravus and acting as 1/1 Flying artifact
    creatures, they are token creatures and follow the rules of token
    creatures. [bethmo]  

  A token creature cannot attack on the turn it enters play. [Mirage Page 14]

  If the Tetravus is destroyed when the Flyers are off the card, they are
    not destroyed, they are just orphaned. [bethmo]

  Tokens can only be moved back to the same Tetravus they came from.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]  Remember that a card that goes to the
    graveyard or hand and then comes back to play is not considered to be
    the same creature even if it is the same card.  Phasing out then back
    in, it is still the same creature. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

  Moving a counter on or off the Tetravus is a phase effect.  You can move
    as many as you want during upkeep, but each can only be moved once.
    [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  Orcish Oriflamme and other non-targeted effects can enhance the token
    creatures. [bethmo]

  A Clone of Tetravus does get the counters since this is done at casting
    time.  A Doppelganger only gets tokens if it copies the Tetravus at
    casting time and not as a later doppel effect. [WotC Rules Team 07/27/94]

  If your opponent controls some of the token creatures, you can still
    merge them back into the Tetravus and effectively get them back.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/12/94]

  Merging them back in erases all changes and effects of any sort affecting 
    the token creature. [WotC Rules Team 10/12/94]

  Tetravite token creatures always come into existence untapped regardless of
    the tap state of the Tetravus. [D'Angelo 08/03/95]  But they are subject
    to any other effects which might change this.  For example, Kismet will
    make them enter play tapped. [D'Angelo 01/22/96]

  The "no enchantments" effect is part of the Tetravites so it persists after
    the Tetravus leaves play. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

    other local enchantments which are somehow enabled to target him are not
    affected by his ability. [DeLaney 01/28/97]

    were put into play, they would become 1/1 instead.
    [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]

  The 2/3 creature effect does not wear off if the land stops being a Forest.
    It continues until the end of the turn. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]

  Can sacrifice the Druid to itself. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

@{b}Thicket Basilisk@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Whenever a Thicket Basilisk blocks or is blocked
    by a non-Wall creature, destroy that creature at end of combat."
    [Encyclopedia Page 45]

  Creatures can regenerate from the Basilisk's power.

  A non-wall creature blocking or blocked by this card gets a "destroy at end
    of combat" effect placed on it when it is assigned as a blocker or this
    card is assigned to block it.  The effect is added to a creature which
    becomes a blocker by any means, including being part of a band which is
    blocked or by being moved into blocking or being blocked by an effect such
    as General Jarkeld.  This effect stays even if the creature is removed
    from the blocking situation by an effect like General Jarkeld.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  Protection from Green does not prevent the Basilisk's power because it is
    not a targeted effect. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  With the errata, all versions destroy the creature at the end of the combat,
    and they will never affect walls.  Before the errata, the Limited,
    Unlimited, and Revised Editions destroyed the creature during the normal
    damage dealing step (first strike on the Basilisk does not affect when it
    destroys the creature), and they also could destroy an attacking wall.
    [D'Angelo 12/09/96]

  The Limited and Unlimited versions of Fog do not prevent the Basilisk's

  Can be used more than once in a turn.  Each time, the opponent can pay to
    prevent giving first strike to a creature, but this payment only stops

    [D'Angelo 02/06/95]

  The payment is made when the Tidal Flats effect resolves.
    [D'Angelo 06/27/95]

  First Strike is assigned to your creatures currently blocking non-Flyers
    when this effect resolves.  So, if the blocking assignments change 
    before resolution (with General Jarkeld for instance) you might get a
    different effect than you expected. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

    It is of type "Artifact" and not "Mono Artifact". [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  See @{"Phase Skipping" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHAS} in the General Rulings for more information.

  You use the untap effect right as your turn would begin and skip your turn
    instead of proceeding to the untap phase. [Aahz 03/04/96]  You cannot
    decide to skip your turn during another player's turn.

  Before the errata, there were a lot of tricks to getting infinite turns.
    The errata stops all of them.

  If you have multiple Time Vaults, you must skip a turn for each one you
    wish to untap, not one turn to untap them all. [bethmo]

  If multiple "extra turn" effects resolve in the same turn, take them in
    the order that the effects resolved. [Aahz 12/02/94]  This is because they

  Opponent gets a chance to use the card being Twiddled during the same

  Twiddle to tap can target a tapped card and Twiddle to untap can target an

  The Unlimited Edition version of this card has an extra statement about
    "no effects are generated by the target card".  This statement does
    not make the target unusable, it is just a reminder that tapping a card
    with an effect (rather than tapping as part of a cost) does not activate
    any abilities on the card.
