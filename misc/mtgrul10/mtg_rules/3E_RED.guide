@node EARTH "Earthbind"

@{b}Earthbind@{ub}

Color   = Red
Rarity  = A/B/UL(C) / RV(C)
Type    = Enchant Creature
Cost    = R
Artist  = Quinton Hoover

Text(RV): If cast on a flying creature, Earthbind removes flying ability
          and does 2 damage to target creature; this damage occurs only
          once, at the time Earthbind is cast. If another spell or effect
          later gives target creature flying ability, Earthbind does not
          affect this. Earthbind has no effect on non-flying creatures.

Text(UL): Earthbind does 2 damage to target flying creature, which also
          loses flying ability.

@node FORK_ "Fork"

@{b}Fork@{ub}

Color   = Red
Rarity  = A/B/UL(R) / RV(R)
Type    = Interrupt
Cost    = RR
Artist  = Amy Weber

Text(RV): Any sorcery or instant spell just cast is duplicated. Treat Fork
          as an exact copy of target spell except that Fork remains red.
          Caster of Fork chooses the copy's target.

Text(UL): Any sorcery or instant spell just cast is doubled. Treat Fork as
          an exact copy of target spell except that Fork remains red. Copy
          and original may have different targets.

@node GRANI "Granite Gargoyle"

@{b}Granite Gargoyle@{ub}

Color   = Red
Rarity  = A/B/UL(R) / RV(R)
Type    = Summon Gargoyle (2/2)
Cost    = 2R
Artist  = Christopher Rush

Text(RV): Flying
          <R>: +0/+1

Text(UL): Flying
          <R>: +0/+1 until end of turn.

Flavor Text: @{i}"While most overworlders fortunately don't realize this,
              Gargoyles can be most delicious, providing you have the
              appropriate tools to carve them."

Type    = Summon Roc (3/3)
Cost    = 3R
Artist  = Andi Rusu

Text(RV): Flying 

Text(UL): Flying 

Flavor Text: @{i}We encountered a valley topped with immense boulders and
             eerie rock formations. Suddenly one of these boulders
             toppled from its perch and sprouted gargantuan wings,
             casting a shadow of darkness and sending us fleeing
             in terror.@{ui}

@{b}Rock Hydra@{ub}

Color   = Red
Rarity  = A/B/UL(R) / RV(R)
Type    = Summon Hydra (0/0)
Cost    = XRR
Artist  = Jeff A. Menges

Text(RV): Put X +1/+1 counters (heads) on Hydra. Each point of damage
          Hydra suffers kills one head unless controller spends <R> per
          head. During controller's upkeep, new heads may be grown for
          <RRR> apiece.

Text(UL): Put X +1/+1 counters (heads) on Hydra. Each point of damage
          Hydra suffers destroys one head unless <R> is spent. During
          upkeep, new heads may be grown for <RRR> apiece.

Text(AL): Put X +1/+1 counters (heads) on Hydra. Each point of damage
          Hydra suffers destroys one head unless R is spent. During

          While controller has swamps in play, Sedge Troll gains +1/+1.

Text(UL): <B>: Regenerates.
          Troll gains +1/+1 if controller has swamps in play.

Flavor Text: @{i}The stench was overpowering; something loathsome was
             cooking. Occasionally something surfaced in the thick
             paste, but my host would push it down before I could
             make it out.@{ui}
