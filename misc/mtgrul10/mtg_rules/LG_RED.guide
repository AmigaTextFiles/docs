          this card from deck if not playing for ante.

Text(4E): <T>: Choose a card at random from target opponent's hand and put
          it in yours. Bury Tempest Efreet in opponent's graveyard. The
          change in ownership is permanent. Play this ability as an
          interrupt. Before you choose the card to be switched, the
          opponent may prevent effect by paying 10 life or conceding game;
          if this is done, bury Tempest Efreet. Effects that prevent or
          redirect damage cannot be used to counter this loss of life.
          Remove Tempest Efreet from your deck before playing if not
          playing for ante.
