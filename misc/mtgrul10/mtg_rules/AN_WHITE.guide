Text(AN): Players must leave game in progress as it is and use the cards

          libraries, and resume game in progress, with any loser of subgame
          halving his or her life points, rounding down. Effects that
          prevent damage may not be used to counter this loss of life.
          The subgame has no ante; using less than forty cards may be
          necessary.
