@node PALLA "Palladia-Mors"

@{b}Palladia-Mors@{ub}

  As errata, it is of type "Summon Legend" and not "Summon Elder Dragon
    Legend". [Encyclopedia Page 60]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/PALLA}

@endnode
@node PANIC "Panic"

@{b}Panic@{ub}

  As errata, the Ice Age version of this card should have you draw a card
    at the beginning of the next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]  This makes it identical to the Fifth
    Edition version.

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_RED.guide/PANIC}

@endnode
@node PARAL "Paralyze"

@{b}Paralyze@{ub}

  Note that the enchantment is a permanent.  It does not leave once it is 
    paid. This is a common mistake.

  Because Paralyze is paid during upkeep, the creature does avoid
    restrictions on the untap phase such as Smoke, and can untap when
    Stasis is in effect, or untap around the Meekstone.  [bethmo]

  May be paid more than once a turn if you have enough mana.  
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  If two Paralyzes are on a creature, 8 mana must be spent to untap it.
    Untap costs are cumulative.  It is not mandatory that you pay the mana 
    cost.  See @{"Untap Cost" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_UNCO} in the General Rulings for more information.

  The creature becomes tapped when Paralyze is resolved, not when it is
    declared. [Aahz 07/29/94]

  Paralyze can be used on creatures which are already tapped.

  The Limited and Unlimited versions of this card said to pay the mana
    during the untap phase.  This is not valid under the current rules 
    and so it should be paid during the upkeep phase, just like the Revised
    and Fourth Edition versions of the card state. [PPG Page 113]

@node PARTW "Part Water"

@{b}Part Water@{ub}

  The "UXX" casting cost is not a misprint.  It means to spend one blue plus
    two times X colorless to cast the spell. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLUE.guide/PARTW}

@endnode
@node PEACE "Peace Talks"

@{b}Peace Talks@{ub}

  Can be played after your attack. [bethmo 02/10/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_WHITE.guide/PEACE}

@endnode
@node PENDE "Pendelhaven"

@{b}Pendelhaven@{ub}

  Checks the current power/toughness of the creature and not the text printed
    on the bottom corner of the card.  If the creature is enchanted or
    otherwise enhanced to not be 1/1 anymore, you cannot use this card on
    the creature. [D'Angelo 02/03/95]

  The creature is checked to see if it is 1/1 when you declare the effect and
    when it is resolved, so if the creature's total power/toughness is changed
    from 1/1 to something else between declaration and resolution, then it
    fizzles. [bethmo 06/22/94]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_LAND.guide/PENDE}

@endnode
@node PENTA "Pentagram of the Ages"

@{b}Pentagram of the Ages@{ub}

  Does not remove all damage done this turn from the source, just all damage
    from that source which is being handled in the current damage prevention
    step.  [Aahz 07/09/95]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/PENTA}

@endnode
@node PERSO "Personal Incarnation"

@{b}Personal Incarnation@{ub}

  As errata to the Limited, Unlimited and Revised Edition versions of this
    card, it should read "...If Personal Incarnation goes to the graveyard
    from play...".  [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 133]  And "caster should be
    read as "owner". [Aahz 11/08/96]

  The loss of life caused when the Incarnation dies cannot be prevented by
    any spell or effect.  It is not damage, and it is not prevented by the
    Conservator, Circle of Protection, Reverse Damage or anything else. 
    [PPG Page 113]

  You do not lose life if Swords to Plowshares is used on it since it does
    not go to the graveyard. [Snark]

  If the Incarnation has Creature Bond on it when it dies, the order in which
    loss of life from the Incarnation and the damage from Creature Bond 
    happens depends on who controls the two triggered effects.
    [D'Angelo 11/08/96]  If one player controls both, then they decide the
    order.  If different players control them, then the current player's
    effect goes first.

  If two Incarnations die at once, you lose half of your life, then half of
    what is left. [WotC Rules Team]

  Note that the owner of the Incarnation loses life when it is destroyed,
    not the controller.  So if you control your opponent's Incarnation you
    can let it die to make them lose life. [bethmo 09/09/94]

  If you have less than zero life when the Incarnation dies, treat it as if
    you had zero life.  You do not gain life. [Aahz 05/30/95]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_WHITE.guide/PERSO}

@endnode
@node PESTI "Pestilence"

@{b}Pestilence@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "At the end of any turn, if there are no creatures
    in play, bury Pestilence.  (B): Pestilence deals 1 damage to each
    creature and player." [Encyclopedia Page 38]

  There are a number of rulings on the use of this card.  See the
    @{"Activation Cost" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ACTI} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  It is not targeted, so it will damage creatures with Protection from Black,
    but note that Protection from Color immediately reduces all damage of
    that color to zero, so the damage goes away and does not hurt the
    creature. [Mirage Page 21]

  Each activation is considered a new packet of damage.  An activation can
    only be 1 point of damage.  You cannot multiply pump the effect in one
    activation. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 26]

  It can stay in play if there is a creature which is buried at end of turn if
    you check the Pestilence prior to burying that creature.  Similarly, if
    a creature comes into play at end of turn, you can check Pestilence after
    that.  [D'Angelo 11/07/96]  Remember that "until end of turn" effects wear
    off before this, so a Mishra's Factory cannot keep Pestilence in play, and
    that the current player's "at end of turn" effects happen before the other
    player's.

  Applies to all players and their creatures in multiplayer games.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/PESTI}

@endnode
@node PETRA "Petra Sphinx"

@{b}Petra Sphinx@{ub}

  The turning over of a card for the Sphinx does not count as "drawing" a
    card for purposes of Underworld Dreams or any other effect which looks
    at cards drawn.  [Aahz 06/22/94]

  You will not lose the game if there are no cards in your library when the
    Sphinx is used on you.  It simply does not work. [Aahz 06/22/94]
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_WHITE.guide/PETRA}

@endnode
@node PHAFO "Phantasmal Forces"

@{b}Phantasmal Forces@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Flying.  During your upkeep, pay (U) or bury
    Phantasmal Forces." [Encyclopedia Page 38]

  Paying the upkeep is optional, but if you do not pay it the Forces are
    placed in the graveyard. [Aahz]

  The Alpha printing version of this card had a 'U' where the blue mana
    symbol is on all further printings.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLUE.guide/PHFOR}

@endnode
@node PHATE "Phantasmal Terrain"

@{b}Phantasmal Terrain@{ub}

  Only the basic land types can be declared.  Multilands are not basic
    types nor are the expansion set lands. [bethmo]

  Multilands and expansion set land cards are valid targets for the spell. 
    [bethmo]

  A changed land is considered to be the new land type in all ways.  This
    is not just a change of name.  It changes the color of mana produced
    and removes any and all special abilities the land may otherwise have
    had. [Mirage Page 58]

  Will not add or remove Snow-Covered nature from a land.
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  This change lasts until another spell or effect overrides it, or until
    the enchantment is removed. [bethmo 05/03/94]  This works just like all
    other enchantments.

@{b}Phyrexian Devourer@{ub}

  Is buried immediately upon an effect changing its power to 7 or more.
    [Aahz 05/21/96]  This means a Giant Growth or something can kill it.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_ARTIFACT.guide/PHDEV}

@endnode
@node PHYRE "Phyrexian Gremlins"

@{b}Phyrexian Gremlins@{ub}

  Only prevents artifact from untapping during untap phase.  Ones that
    untap during upkeep are not inhibited. [Aahz]

  Can target a tapped artifact.  [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 22]

  The target artifact cannot untap if the Gremlins start the untap phase
    tapped, even if it is your artifact and you plan on untapping the
    Gremlins.  [Aahz 06/06/94]

  If the Gremlins somehow become an artifact and then tap themselves, they
    can never be untapped during the untap phase.  They must be untapped by
    an external effect.  [Aahz 06/06/94]

  Effect does not end if the target stops being valid.  For example, if it
    stops being an artifact. [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

@{b}Planar Gate@{ub}

  Only reduces the generic mana portion of a spell's cost.  If the spell
    does not accept generic mana or accepts less than 2, you get a reduced
    or null effect from this card. [bethmo 06/15/94]

  Only works for its controller, not all players. [bethmo 06/15/94]

  Only works on Summon spells.  It does not work for Artifact Creatures.
    [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Although the apparent cost is reduced, the "casting cost" of the spell for
    reasons of Spell Blast or such is still the full amount. [bethmo 06/18/94]
    Just think of the Gate as contributing 2 to the cost, not reducing it.

  Multiple Gates do add up.  Two will contribute up to 4 toward the cost,
    and so on. [bethmo 06/29/94]

    Edition version.

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  This is not a draw effect and will not cause a player to lose if they have

@node POWAR "Power Artifact"

@{b}Power Artifact@{ub}

  Can be cast on artifacts with no or zero activation costs, but this has
    no effect on them.  It does not increase the cost to one. [bethmo]

  For artifacts with an X use cost (such as the Candelabra of Tawnos or
    Ice Cauldron) this reduces the amount spent by 2 to a minimum of 1.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]  If you choose X to be zero, you have to still
    pay 1.  Power Artifact lets you pay the greater of 1 or X-2.
    [Aahz 09/29/95]

  Only affects the generic mana part of activation costs.  Colored parts of 
    mana costs are not affected.  This rule comes into play if a card like the
    Northern Paladin gets changed into an artifact by Ashnod's Transmogrant.

  Is considered to alter the activation cost on the card it modifies.  Thus,
    each activation costs the new reduced cost. [Aahz 03/03/95]

  Does not affect untap costs which are not specified as activation costs.
    [bethmo]  This includes the Basalt Monolith and the Antiquities version
    of Colossus of Sardia.

    tapped, or whenever the activation cost of one of that opponent's
    artifacts is paid." [Encyclopedia Page 209]  Removal of the bit about
    continuous artifacts since it no longer applies. [D'Angelo 12/16/96]

  Gives one life whenever an artifact is activated or tapped for any other
    reason (including attacking).  If tapping is part of the cost of
    activation, only one life is given. [bethmo 05/03/94]

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one 
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.

@endnode
@node POWSI "Power Sink"

@{b}Power Sink@{ub}

  Only mana from lands and mana pool must be expended.  Artifacts and other
    mana sources need not be used to counter this spell. [bethmo]  This means
    that you need not use anything other than the tapping of lands for
    mana.

  Special lands which cannot provide mana need not be tapped in an attempt
    to pay the Sink. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  If a land has different amounts of mana that can be drawn, the maximum will
    be drawn from the land.  This may cause the land to sacrifice itself (in
    the case of some lands) or to remove counters in the case of other lands.
    [D'Angelo 02/15/95]  Note that such lands can be tapped by your opponent
    at mana source speeds for the lesser amount of mana prior to Power Sink
    resolving.  If this happens, all you get is what is in their pool.

  If the land provides mana only for specific purposes (like Mishra's
    Workshop), it does not contribute to the X mana you have to pay
    unless that purpose is being filled.  Mishra's Workshop, like most
    purposed mana, could not be used to pay for Power Sink.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/30/94]  The land isn't even tapped. [Aahz 01/16/96]

  Does not increase the casting cost of the spell.  It just requires a
    separate expenditure in order for it to succeed. [bethmo 05/05/94]

  Special purpose mana such as Mishra's Workshop cannot be used to pay the
    additional cost. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]

  The decision of which lands to tap to pay for this effect is made when the
    spell resolves. [D'Angelo 11/06/96]

+ The Tempest version of this card differs from previous versions.  On the
    previous versions, you tapped lands for mana until X mana was drawn and
    could not choose to not do so.  On the new version, you may pay X mana or
    you can simply let all your mana producing lands become tapped (not
    tapped for mana, just tapped). [bethmo 10/09/97]

  Affects all players during multiplayer games.

+ The number of untapped lands is not counted as a beginning of turn ability.
    This card just knows how many were untapped even if it was not in play
    at the beginning of the turn. [Aahz 02/16/97]  The number is the number
    which were untapped prior to beginning of turn effects being dealt
    with. [D'Angelo 07/07/97]

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition should be treated as saying "During a
    player's upkeep Power Surge does that player 1 damage for each land
    that player controls that was untapped at the beginning of the turn
    prior to the untap phase." [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 79]  This really

    [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]

  Not paying upkeep costs on a land is considered to have the land as the

    effect.  In other words, if an outside source imposes an upkeep cost on
    a land, the land is still considered to be destroying itself.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99] Cumulative upkeep is just a kind of upkeep.

  When used on a land animated by Living Lands (or similar effect), this
    effectively prevents the land from being killed by causing the land to
    regenerate without causing it to be tapped like a normal regeneration
    does. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]
