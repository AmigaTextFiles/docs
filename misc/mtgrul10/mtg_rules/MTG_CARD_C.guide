@node CALLT "Call to Arms"

@{b}Call to Arms@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Choose a color.  As long as target opponent
    controls more cards in play of that color tha any other color, all white
    creatures get +1/+1.  If at any time that opponent does not control more
    cards in play of that color than any other color, bury Call to Arms."
    [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  Cannot choose "colorless" as a color. [Aahz 06/08/95]

  Only buried if opponent controls less or exactly the same number of cards
    of the chosen color than of any other single color.  Thus, if you chose
    red and they had 5 red cards, 4 blue ones, and 3 white ones, it would
    not be buried.  [WotC Rules Team 07/19/95]

  Only counts cards in play. [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 44]

+ Colorless cards are effectively ignored by this card's ability.
    [D'Angelo 06/23/97]

@node CAMEL "Camel"

@{b}Camel@{ub}

  Does offer Desert protection to itself when alone. 
    [WotC Rules Team 11/16/94]
 
  Includes damage from animated Deserts in combat. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  Reduces damage to zero much like Protection from Color does.
    [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_WHITE.guide/CAMEL}

@endnode
@node CAMOU "Camouflage"

@{b}Camouflage@{ub}

  Can be cast when you have no creatures in play or no attacking creatures
    since it does not say it needs to be played during an attack. [bethmo]
    If so, it does nothing.

  See the @{"Face-Down Cards" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_FDOW} entry in the General Rulings for more 
    information.

 @{" Card Information " link UL_GREEN.guide/CAMOU}

@endnode
@node CANDE "Candelabra of Tawnos"

@{b}Candelabra of Tawnos@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "{X},{Tap}: Untap X separate lands."  The card
    type is "Artifact" and not "Mono Artifact". [Encyclopedia Page 130]

  Note that this is not mana source (or even interrupt) speed.  It is an
    instant speed fast effect and it will resolve along with other effects in
    this spell stack in last-in first-out order like all instants.  The lands
    untap during resolution. [bethmo]

  You may untap your opponent's lands if desired. [Aahz 05/03/94]  This can
    be useful if Power Surge is in play.

  Can target an untapped land. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 22]

+ Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck) for
    Classic (Type I) tournaments from 05/02/94 until 10/01/97.  Has always
    been banned in Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) tournaments.

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/CANDE}

@endnode
@node CARIB "Caribou Range"

@{b}Caribou Range@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Choose target land you control.  ..."
    [Encyclopedia Page 75]

  See the @{"Enchant Land" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ELND} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  The land is tapped during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The effect cannot be announced if the
    land is not in an untapped state. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]

  It is buried if you lose control of the target land. 
    [Mirage Page 22]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/CARIB}

@endnode
@node CARNI "Carnivorous Plant"

@{b}Carnivorous Plant@{ub}

  It is a wall even though the name does not have "Wall" in it.  The card
    is of type "Summon Wall".  [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 6]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_GREEN.guide/CARNI}

@endnode
@node CASTL "Castle"

@{b}Castle@{ub}

  Note that attackers do not get the benefits of Castle.  Even though the
    Serra Angel does not tap when attacking it does not get the benefits
    during the attack, but if it does not die in the attack it gets back
    the benefit afterwards (since it will no longer be "attacking").
    [bethmo]

  Tapping a creature removes the +2 toughness from the creature and may
    kill it if it has already taken damage.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_WHITE.guide/CASTL}

@endnode
@node CATAC "Catacomb Dragon"

@{b}Catacomb Dragon@{ub}

  The halving of power is done as a triggered ability upon declaration of
    blockers.  This halving is not applied to any additional power 
    modification done after that. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 28]

  If the power of the creature is recalculated (which only happens if the base
    power changes or a power-changing effect which was in effect before the
    Catacomb Dragon's effect ends), you redo the halving of the power.  This 
    ability is not like the errata on Berserk or Singing Tree which just do a 
    fixed change as determined on resolution. [Aahz 11/08/96]  For example, 
    if a 2/2 creature with Unholy Strength on it to make it 4/3 blocks the 
    Dragon, it becomes 2/3.  If the Unholy Strength is destroyed, the halving
    effect is reapplied to the 2/2 creature to make it 1/2.

@node CATHE "Cathedral of Serra"

@{b}Cathedral of Serra@{ub}

  See @{"Adventurers' Guildhouse" link MTG_CARD_A.guide/ADVEN} for rulings.
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_LAND.guide/CATHE}

@endnode
@node CAVEP "Cave People"

@{b}Cave People@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If Cave People attacks, it gets +1/-2 until end
    of turn. ..." [Encyclopedia Page 22]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_RED.guide/CAVEP}

@endnode
@node CAVER "Caverns of Despair"

@{b}Caverns of Despair@{ub}

  If you have more than two creatures which are required to attack, you can
    pick which two do so.  For example, if you had 3 Juggernauts in play,
    only two of your choice will attack.  There is no penalty for these
    creatures not attacking unless the penalty is assigned from outside
    with effects such as Siren's Call and Nettling Imp. [bethmo 07/02/94]

  Even though you have a choice, if a creature is forced to attack or defend,
    it must do so before (or at the same time) you choose any creatures which
    were not forced.  For example, if you had a Juggernaut and 2 other
    creatures, you cannot declare the two creatures. You must declare the
    Juggernaut and can declare one other.  Same goes for blocking under the
    effects of Lure.  [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_RED.guide/CAVER}

@endnode
@node CELDA "Celestial Dawn"

@{b}Celestial Dawn@{ub}

  As errata, the ability changes all colored mana symbols and not just ones 
    in costs.  [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]

  Affects only cards you own and permanents you control.  Does not affect mana
    symbols on cards you do not own and which that are not in play as 
    permanents you control.  Therefore, a card Grinning Totem grabs is not 
    affected. [bethmo 10/16/96] 

  It has three effects.  First, it changes all your lands into Plains.  This
    can be overridden to change the land type by an effect that enters play
    after Celestial Dawn.  Second, it changes all mana symbols on your cards
    to white mana symbols.  Third, it changes the color of all non-land 
    permanents you control to white.  This effect means that even if you 
    Phantasmal Terrain one of your lands to a Mountain, it'll be a Mountain 
    making white mana.  Effects that override what color mana a land produces,
    such as Naked Singularity or Hall of Gemstone can override both effects.
    [bethmo 11/05/96]

  It does affect text 'spliced' into other cards.  For example, Zombie Master
    adds the text "B: Regenerate." to zombies.  If you opponent had the Zombie
    Master and you had zombies and Celestial Dawn, your zombies would get 
    "W: Regenerate.". [Aahz 12/02/96]

  This card affects the color of spells being cast by changing the color
    requirements in the casting cost.  Thus, all your spells with a colored
    casting cost are cast as white spells.  If an interrupt such as Deathlace
    changes the color of the spell, the spell will be changed to the 
    appropriate color. [Aahz 03/18/97]

  When a card is in play, its "basic color definition" normally determines its
    color.  This definition is defined as "the color(s) of the mana in the
    card's casting cost".  Thus, when Celestial Dawn is in play, all your 
    non-land cards with colored mana costs are white.  When it leaves play,
    the effect ends and all cards revert to their normal colors.  This is
    true even if the cards were cast using white mana while Celestial Dawn
    was in play. [Aahz 03/18/97]

  The effect to turn all your non-land cards (including artifacts) white is a
    continuous effect that will override the color as set prior to Celestial 
    Dawn's effect.  Thus, a Deathlace on casting of a spell or prior to 
    Celestial Dawn entering play will be overridden by Celestial Dawn's 
    effect. [Aahz 03/18/97]

  A color change effect which enters play after Celestial Dawn can override
    the color changing effect of Celestial Dawn. [D'Angelo 03/18/97]

  Gloom really gives a player with this card a bad time.

  If an effect like Vampire Bats or Dragon Whelp is used while the mana
    symbols are one color and then they change because this card enters or
    leaves play, then the previous expenditures are not counted toward the
    modified limit.  For example, if you spent BB on a Vampire Bats, and then
    this card entered play, you could spend WW on it.
    [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]

+ Does not affect color words written out instead of being written using the
    mana symbol. [D'Angelo 08/27/97]

+ Does not change the type of lands which are not in play.  Lands out of
    play are what they say they are, and any "comes into play" effects of
    playing them still happen. [D'Angelo 08/27/97]

@node CHAIN "Chain Lightning"

@{b}Chain Lightning@{ub}

  The chaining effects (after the first one) are not considered "spells" and
    cannot be countered.  Only the original spell can be countered.
    [Aahz 06/15/95]

  You can only chain to another target if at least one damage is not 
    prevented on the current target. [bethmo 06/15/94]  This is because it is
    in the nature of the damage that during damage resolution a new target 
    can be picked.

  Each time Chain Lightning deals damage it is considered to be a different
    packet of damage. [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Once the Chain Lightning is resolved, a series of damage prevention steps
    is entered.  Only spells allowed during damage prevention can be used
    until the Chain is done.  This means no casting of Giant Growth or other
    non-prevention spells.  [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Paying to make Chain Lightning continue is done during Step B of damage
    prevention.  See @{"Damage Prevention" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_DPRE} in the General Rulings for more
    information.

  Your opponent is counted as the one choosing any targets they choose (just
    like you count for your own choices) for things like Autumn Willow that
    care who is targeting rather than what is targeting it. [Aahz 10/24/95]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_RED.guide/CHAIN}

@endnode
@node CMEPH "Chains of Mephistopheles"

@{b}Chains of Mephistopheles@{ub}

  If you cast a spell to draw extra cards (such as Ancestral Recall or
    Wheel of Fortune) at some time outside the draw phase, this affects all
    the cards drawn.  During the draw phase, the first card drawn is not
    affected. [bethmo 06/15/94]

  Only affects the drawing of cards.  It does not affect spells like Demonic
    Tutor, Millstone, or Petra Sphinx which affect the library but do not
    say "draw" a card. [bethmo 06/22/94]

  Each player is exempted from one draw each turn, so your opponent can use
    a Jayemdae Tome or other effect to draw during your turn's draw phase
    without being affected.  [Aahz 10/17/94]  Basically this says that the
    text "does not apply to the first card drawn by a player" should be read
    as "each player".

+ If X cards are drawn as the resolution of a single spell/ability, then the
    player first discards X cards then draws X cards.  If they cannot discard
    X cards, they discard as many as they can and then move one card from
    their library to the graveyard for each card they could not discard.
    They then draw as many cards as they successfully discarded.
    [Aahz 06/25/97]  If this interacts with the first draw during the draw
    phase, only X minus 1 cards need to be discarded because the first card
    being drawn is immune to this effect. [Aahz 06/25/97]

  The effect is cumulative.  If you have two of these out, each of them will
    modify on each draw (after the first one if during the draw phase), and
    will cause the player to discard or to "mill" a card from their library.
    As they resolve in order, the player must discard if possible.  Once the
    player fails to discard and instead "mills" a card, all further effects
    of additional Chains of Mephistopheles will not do anything.  This is
    because the "mill" also replaces the draw effect and the player is no
    longer drawing a card. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]  You handle them in
    order.  Each one makes you discard first and then continue or else mill
    a card and lose the draw.

  Brainstorm is considered to be 3 cards drawn even though 2 are put back.
    [D'Angelo 01/13/96]

  This is a specialized ability that can happen during the middle of the
    resolution of another effect.  The requirement to discard just prior to
    drawing is the text that causes the overriding of the normal rules.
    [D'Angelo 08/19/96]

+ Cards which are drawn as a cost are not affected by this card because
    replacement abilities cannot be used on costs.  If a card is drawn as a
    cost and is the first card drawn during the draw phase, then the "first
    card drawn" is used up. [Aahz 06/25/97]

@node CSTAS "Chain Stasis"

@{b}Chain Stasis@{ub}

  The decision to tap or untap is made on announcement (of the spell or
    of each triggered use) before target is selected.  This decision cannot
    be changed if the spell is Forked or redirected. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]
    See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  You do get to choose a different tap or untap each time it is used
    during a chain.

  You can choose the same creature over and over if you want.  You are not
    forced to pick a different one each time.  Note that this is different
    than Fireball since you are picking the targets one at a time and not
    all at once. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 60]

  Each time Chain Stasis resolves, it causes a new triggered effect 
    which can be used by the controller of the target. [D'Angelo 10/25/95]
    You may use mana sources between resolving each trigger.  See the 
    @{"Triggered Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TIM_TRIGGER} entry in the @{"Spell and Effect Timing" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TIMING} section of the

  This is not damage, it is loss of life.  It cannot be prevented by any

  The amount of life converted into mana is not a decision as part of the
    casting of Channel. [WotC Rules Team]  You first cast Channel then you
    can convert life to mana for the rest of the turn.  You do not convert
    it during casting.
  You cannot convert life points you don't have.  In other words, you cannot
    Channel yourself below zero life. [D'Angelo 08/10/95]

    that number is even, target opponent gains control of Chaos Lord."
    [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  The Lord's changing of controllers is a new effect each upkeep so it will
    take precedence over any other control effects.  This means that using
    Control Magic on a Chaos Lord won't guarantee that you keep it.

@{b}Chaos Orb@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(1),(Tap): Flip Chaos Orb onto the playing area
    from a height of at least one foot.  Chaos Orb must turn completely over
    at least once or it is buried with no effect.  When Chaos Orb lands, any
    cards in play it touches are destroyed, and Chaos Orb is buried.  Ignore
    this effect if Chaos Orb is not in play when the effect resolves."
    It is an "Artifact" and not a "Mono Artifact".  [Encyclopedia Page 208]
    [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]

  You can arrange your cards any time before the Orb is put into play, but
    not after. [Snark]  In general, you should not stack cards or put them
    in places where your opponent cannot read the names of all of them or
    count them.  This is recommended good gaming practice.  [Aahz 12/03/94]

  You cannot interfere in any physical way with the playing of this card.
    [PPG Page 221]

  It must flip 360 degrees (that's what "flip entirely" means). [FAQ]
    And this flip must be in the air and not in your hand.

  "Cards it touches" refers to cards it touches once it stops moving. [Snark] 

  If the Orb does not touch a card because a pente stone or other token is
    between them, the Orb counts as not touching the card. [bethmo]  Same
    goes if there are cards stacked up.  If the card is not touched, it
    is not destroyed.  Note that only counters and tokens placed in play
    because of the game count for this.  "Tapping" stones and any other 
    markers you have in play should be taken out of the way before using the
    Orb. [Aahz 02/09/95]

  If you have sleeves on cards, they count as the cards. [bethmo]

  Can only affect cards that are in play.  Cards that are in the game but
    not in play (such as the Library and Graveyard) or cards that are held
    out of play by such effects as Oubliette and Tawnos's Coffin cannot be
    affected.

  The Chaos Orb is a "Do A to do B" effect where A is removing the Orb from
    play and B is flipping it then putting it into the graveyard.  If the
    Orb is not in play when the effect resolves, nothing happens.  Once the
    Orb has been flipped, it is put into the graveyard and this may not be
    prevented. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]

  This is a not a targeted effect.  Creatures with Artifact Ward or other
    means of preventing being targeted by artifacts are destroyed by the
    Orb.  [bethmo]

  Even if your hand is face up on the table due to an effect like Revelation,
    cards in the hand are not considered "in play" and will not be affected
    by the Orb. [Aahz 04/17/95]

  Ripping the Chaos Orb into confetti and then scattering it (as each piece
    flops 360 degrees) across your opponent's cards was ruled legal at one
    time, but it was suggested that this strategy not be allowed in the final 
    round of a tournament. [bethmo]  This ruling is mostly humorous in value.
    You are very unlikely to get WotC or a NetRep to back this one, but I'm
    listing it because it is funny.  Also, note that if you remove a card
    from your deck during a tournament then you are disqualified.  You cannot
    remove or shred one of your opponent's cards.

  Has been on the Duelist Convocation banned list (not allowed in decks) for
    Type I tournaments since 11/01/95.  It was on the Convocation restricted
    list (only 1 per deck) for Type I tournaments from 08/01/94 to 11/01/95.
    It has always been banned from Type II and Type I.5 tournaments.

    [Encyclopedia Page 52]  This errata is a bit flawed.  It should say
    "Clone comes into play with all the characteristics, including ...".
    The above text erroneously looks like a triggered effect.
    [DeLaney 07/11/97]

  Animating a dead Clone gets all the Clone's abilities but it mimics at -1
    power. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  The Clone of an artifact creature can be Shattered or Disenchanted
    because it is an artifact creature too. [Aahz]

  Can be used to copy a base Doppelganger.  You get a Doppelganger which is
    always blue, and the Clone is mimicking the same creature the
    Doppelganger was until the next upkeep. [PPG Page 223]

  The Clone is the same color as the creature it copies.  It is no longer
    blue (even if the card looks blue) unless the creature it copied was
    blue too. [bethmo]

  The decision of what to Clone is part of the casting decisions. [bethmo]

  This spell is targeted, so a creature with Protection from Blue cannot be
    Cloned. [WotC Rules Team]

  The Clone is targeted and checks its target when declared and when
    resolving.  If the target is not valid when the spell resolves, then the
    Clone fizzles.  [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  The Clone is not treated as a Summon Clone card in addition to the type
    of its target.  [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 43] 

  If it is copying an artifact creature, it is not considered to be a summon 
    card and cannot be copied with Dance of Many. 
    [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 43]

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition cards said "all normal characteristics"
    instead of "all characteristics".  In either case, this means that you
    treat the Clone as having the exact same text on it as the original
    card had.  This includes name, casting cost, power/toughness, etc.  It
    does not gain any benefits the original creature may have had

  Burial and sacrifice cannot be prevented by this card. [Mirage Page 11]

  Not paying upkeep costs on a land is considered to have the land as the
    source of the destroy effect regardless of the source of the upkeep
    effect.  In other words, if an outside source imposes an upkeep cost on
    a land, the land is still considered to be destroying itself.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]  Cumulative upkeep is just a kind of
    upkeep.

  Does prevent enchantment spells (but not the effects of enchantments) from
    even targeting the land.  [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]  Indirect effect
    by enchantments such as Conversion, Living Lands, Kormus Bell, and Mana 
    Flare are not prevented and the land can still be targeted by Gaea's 
    Liege, Cyclopean Tomb, and other non-enchantment effects. [Snark]

  The land can be targeted by land destroying spells and the spell will
    resolve successfully, but the destroy effect will be prevented from 
    happening. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 22]

  Does not prevent "remove from game" effects which do not destroy the card.
    This includes Swords to Plowshares (if the land is animated) or
    Dust to Dust (if the land is an artifact as well). [Aahz 12/21/94]

  Does not prevent a land from sending itself to the graveyard, as the
    Strip Mine can do.  Cards which send themselves to the graveyard are
    considered to be sacrifices. [bethmo 05/18/94]  Disintegrate is also
    not prevented since the creature never goes to the graveyard.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  If it ever takes enough damage to be killed, it simply does not go to the
    graveyard or die.  It does not 'regenerate', damage on it is not removed,
    and it does not become tapped. [Aahz 01/14/97]  This is a small change
    from the ancient ruling that said it was similar to regeneration.

  When in combat, an animated land is not removed from combat due to taking
    lethal damage during First Strike damage dealing and will still deal
    damage during the non-First Strike damage dealing.  This is because lethal
    damage does not kill the land. [Aahz 06/16/97]

  This power works similarly for immunity to the Basilisk ability,
    Fireball, and anything else that would kill it. [bethmo]

  Disintegrate can cause it to be removed from the game, because the land is
    still damaged by the Disintegrate and Disintegrate only requires fatal
    damage to be on the land in order to remove it from the game.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]  Of course this only applies if the land is
    animated and it only applies to the Fourth Edition Disintegrate.  The
    other versions require the land to die first which cannot happen.

  Note that Trample damage beyond the Land's toughness would still come
    through to the player. [Aahz]

  The Assembly Worker formed from Mishra's Factory follows all the rules

  As errata to the Revised card, the first sentence should read "You control
    target creature until Control Magic is removed or game ends". 
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 131]  The Fourth Edition version is worded
    differently but means the same thing.  It just says "Gain control of 
    target creature" and this effect (like all enchantments) wears off if
    it leaves play or the game ends.

  Takes control of a creature, but enchantments on the creature do not
    change controller.

  Note that the controlled creature cannot be tapped or used for an attack
    until you begin a turn with the creature in play. [Mirage Page 14]

  Control Magic is buried if its target ever stops being a creature.

  The last sentence refers to the creature being destroyed and not the
    enchantment. [D'Angelo 03/14/95]

  The copy of the artifact is not still blue.  It copies the color of the

  The copy is both an artifact and an enchantment, so it is an
    artifact-enchantment. [Card Text]  Can be affected by anything which

  This spell is targeted and checks its target on declaration and on

  The Arabian Nights version does not target the opponent and gives the

  This is considered a new effect that makes a player discard down to 4 cards

  If the Limited or Unlimited Edition Library of Leng is also in play, you

  Can be used to change any non-swamp land (not just basic lands) into a

  A changed land is considered to be the new land type in all ways.  This

  Will not add or remove Snow-Covered nature from a land.
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  If by any chance more than one counter is on the same land, you can remove
    older ones before newer ones.  For example Mountain changed to Swamp by
    the Tomb, then someone Phantasmal Terrains the land to Island, then you
    Swamp it again.  Removing the newest counter reverts the land to an
    Island. Removing the oldest one leaves the newer one in effect.
