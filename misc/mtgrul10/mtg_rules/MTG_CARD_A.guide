@node ABBEY "Abbey Matron"

@{b}Abbey Matron@{ub}

  The ability is typically used in response to a damaging effect such as a
    Lightning Bolt.  It can also be used after declaring this card as a
    blocker but before damage dealing.  This makes it a 1/6 creature but
    because it is tapped it will not deal damage but can still receive it.

  The ability can only be used on herself.  It cannot be used on other
    creatures.

 @{" Card Information " link HL_WHITE.guide/ABMAT}

@endnode
@node ABEYA "Abeyance"

@{b}Abeyance@{ub}

  It only affects player's right to announce things.  It does not affect
    anything which was already announced but has not yet resolved.
    [D'Angelo 06/30/97]  In other words, Abeyance cannot be used to counter
    a spell or ability. [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]

  The player can respond to the casting of this spell by playing instant
    or interrupt spells and abilities.  But after this spell resolves, they
    cannot announce any more this turn. [D'Angelo 06/12/97]

+ Never prevents mana source abilities from being played.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]  REVERSAL.  This means that you can tap lands
    for mana and play abilities of cards like Llanowar Elves which are played
    as mana sources.

  Prohibits even abilities of permanents which are played as instants,
    interrupts or sorceries that do not have an activation cost.
    [Aahz 06/13/97]

  Abeyance affects spells based on the spell's type and not on whether they
    are played as that type.  So, it does not prohibit spells/abilities that
    say "is played as an instant" or "can be played whenever you could play
    an instant" if the spell/ability's type is not otherwise prevented.
    For example, a enchantment that could be played as an instant is legal
    under Abeyance (assuming you have a way to get mana).
    [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]  Similarly, a Summon spell played via Winding
    Canyons is legal.  [Aahz 09/09/97]

+ Does not prohibit phase costs, phase abilities, untap costs (which don't
    have an activation cost), the ability to declare an attack, triggered and
    specialized abilities (which don't have an activation cost), and
    summoning, enchantments or artifacts.  [D'Angelo 08/12/97]  Also does not
    prohibit damage prevention abilities which do not have activation costs.
    [bethmo 10/09/97]

+ Does not prohibit the abilities of cards which are not in play.  For
    example, the Ashen Ghoul's ability can be played while it is in your
    graveyard. [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]

@node ABOMI "Abomination"

@{b}Abomination@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Whenever a green or white creature blocks or is
    blocked by Abomination, destroy that creature at end of combat."
    [Encyclopedia Page 18]

  A "destroy at end of combat" effect is placed on a green or white creature
    when it is assigned as a blocker or this card is assigned to block it.
    The effect is also added to a creature which becomes a blocker by other
    means, including being part of a band which is blocked or by being moved
    into blocking or being blocked by an effect such as General Jarkeld.  This
    effect stays even if the creature is removed from the blocking situation
    by an effect like General Jarkeld. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  The color of the blocking/blocked creature is checked only at declaration
    of the block.  If the creature is indeed green or white at that time,
    it will be destroyed at the end of the combat even if it changes color
    before the combat ends. [WotC Rules Team 07/27/94]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/ABOMI}

@endnode
@node ABUJA "Abu Ja'far"

@{b}Abu Ja'far@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If Abu Ja'far is put into the graveyard during
    combat, bury all creatures that are blocking or blocked by Abu Ja'far."
    [Encyclopedia Page 59]

  Protection from White will not keep a creature from being destroyed by
    Abu's power because combat abilities are not considered to be targeted.

  If Abu is killed, all creatures currently blocking or blocked by Abu are
    buried.  If he is killed prior to damage dealing, then those creatures
    are immediately buried as well.  Note that if the blockers are switched
    with an effect like General Jarkeld, whichever blockers are currently
    assigned when Abu goes to the graveyard are affected.
    [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 47]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_WHITE.guide/ABUJA}

@endnode
@node ABYSS "The Abyss"

@{b}The Abyss@{ub}

  This is a targeted effect.  The Abyss targets one creature each upkeep.
    For this reason, it ignores creatures with Protection from Black.
    [Aahz 07/13/94]

  If the target becomes invalid after being chosen but before resolution,
    you do not have to choose another target. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 25]
    (REVERSAL)  See the @{"Phase Effects and Phase Abilities" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHEF} entry in the General
    Rulings for more information.

  The player who is acting is counted as the one choosing their target for
    things like Autumn Willow that care who is targeting rather than what is
    targeting it. [Aahz 10/24/95]

  A player cannot choose to use the destroy creature effect when there are no
    targets.  The rule is that a player can end upkeep without dealing with it
    if there are no targets at that time, but if there is a target at that
    time then you must deal with it. [Mirage Page 43]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/THEAB}

@endnode
@node ABYSG "Abyssal Gatekeeper"

@{b}Abyssal Gatekeeper@{ub}

+ If another creature goes to the graveyard at the same time as this card,
    you cannot choose that creature as the one to be buried by the
    Gatekeeper's triggered ability.  This is because you finish putting all
    the dying creatures into the graveyard before dealing with the
    Gatekeeper's triggered ability, and therefore those other creatures going
    to the graveyard with it are not legal targets.
    [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]

+ The "bury a creature" ability is not targeted.  It can affect creatures with
    protection from black. [D'Angelo 08/27/97]

@{" Card Information " link WL_BLACK.guide/ABYSS}

@endnode
@node ACIDI "Acidic Dagger"

@{b}Acidic Dagger@{ub}

  As errata, it should say to bury Acidic Dagger if the target creature leaves
    play this turn. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]

  If used on a creature with First Strike, the Dagger effect will destroy the
    blocked/blocking creature at the end of first strike damage resolution, so
    if the other creature did not have First Strike, it may never get to go at
    all. [bethmo 10/27/96]

  Does not affect the creature if all damage is prevented or redirected.

@endnode
@node AETHF "AEther Flash"

@{b}AEther Flash@{ub}

+ Remember that once a creature comes into play, you won't have time to play
    abilities as instants before AEther Flash's effect resolves, so typically
    wouldn't be able to use the creature's abilities before AEther Flash
    killed it. Of course, abilities played as mana sources, triggered
    abilities, and so on can be played as appropriate. [Aahz 09/05/97]

+ Similarly, you cannot spells and abilities from other sources unless they
    are also mana sources, which makes it hard to sacrifice or use the
    creature before it dies. [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]

+ This is not a targeted effect, so it deals damage to Deadly Insects and
    other creatures that cannot be targeted by spells and abilities.

+ Does not affect other ways to get creatures into play, such as Flash.
    [bethmo 11/27/96]  Or Animate Dead. [bethmo 10/07/97]

  Summon spells cannot even be announced while this is in play.  Duelist
    Magazine #9, Page 60 mistakenly implies that this card counters summon
    spells as they are announced.

  The option to destroy it by paying 4 life is a normal instant speed ability.
    This means that if it is removed from play (with Boomerang for example)
    prior to the effect resolving, then you paid 4 life but the effect fails.

    by a creature, that creature becomes green." [Encyclopedia Page 139]

  Creatures change color the moment the block is declared.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]

  A creature blocking or blocked by this card is changed to green when it is 
    assigned as a blocker or this card is assigned to block it.  A creature is
    also changed if it is blocked or becomes a blocker by any means, including
    being part of a band which is blocked or by being moved into blocking or 
    being blocked by an effect such as General Jarkeld.  The effect is not
    removed if the creature is removed from the blocking situation by an 
    effect like General Jarkeld. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95] This happens as
    a triggered effect.

  A Leprechaun with Protection from Green can be blocked by a creature
    (since it is not green at that time) but will not take damage from the
    creature (since it is green at the time of damage dealing).
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]

@{b}Aladdin@{ub}

  He can hold onto more than one artifact at a time.  He need not drop one
    in order to pick up another.  Note that you must pay and tap the card
    for each use, however.  [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  Any artifact can be taken.  This includes artifact creatures which are
    represented by tokens (e.g. Wasps, Djinn from Bottle of Suleiman).

  Aladdin loses control of artifacts if it leaves play for any reason.
    [bethmo 05/09/94]

  Aladdin does not lose control if the target becomes invalid.  If the
    target stops being an artifact, he keeps control.  He only checks the
    validity of the target on declaration and resolution of his effect.
    [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  The Arabian Nights version can only target an artifact controlled by another
    player.  It also lets you keep control of artifacts if you lose control of
    Aladdin.  Your opponent can use the Aladdin to take them back but you
    don't automatically lose them.  The Chronicles version has the ability as
    an activation cost, can target any artifact (including your own) but loses
    control of the artifact if you lose control of Aladdin.

@{b}Aladdin's Lamp@{ub}

  As errata to the Arabian and Revised Edition versions of this card, add the
    text "X cannot be zero." [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 136]

  This is a specialized effect.  It is used during the resolution of a draw
    effect to modify one of the draws.  [Aahz 11/11/95]
    See @{"Specialized Abilities" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TIM_SPECIAL} in the general rulings for more information.

  Whenever you are to draw a card, you may use this effect.  If the effect
    succeeds, then you do not draw that card, you instead draw as dictated
    by the Lamp. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

  This can be used any time you draw a card from the library.  This
    includes Sindbad, Ancestral Recall, and several other spells.  It
    affects only one of the cards drawn this way, though. [bethmo]

  The Arabian Nights version had 2 casting cost circles with "5" and "5" in
    them to indicate "10" because they could not fit it into one circle.
    This is not a typo. [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  If you have more than one Lamp, you can use a second one on a card being
    drawn from the first one. [Aahz 07/05/95]

  This card modifies a draw and happens prior to any triggered effects that
    would happen because of the draw, such as Zur's Weirding. [Aahz 03/02/96]
    Triggers happen at the end of resolution, while this is used during.

  If the effect is countered, you do not get the draw because giving up the
    draw was a cost for the effect. [Aahz 01/14/97]

  The cards are actually drawn and put into your hand before they are put
    back. [Aahz 12/07/96]

  You may use mana sources between drawing and putting cards back (as per the
    mana source rules), so it's possible to use an Elvish Spirit Guide that
    you drew and to not have to put it back. [Aahz 12/07/96]

  This is a replacement effect, so the original draw that was modified is

  This card does indeed make you immune to damage that would take you below
    1 life point (which is almost immunity to death). You can still be
    affected by things which reduce your life without doing damage.  
    [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  The protection ability is applied at the end of the first step of damage 
    prevention and happens automatically.  This is not a fast effect which
    can be used at any time during damage prevention.
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  It does not prevent direct loss of life from spells like Lich, Channel, etc.
    [bethmo]

  Even works when he is tapped. [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  The protection ability works up until Ali enters the graveyard, so
    if he dies during a damage prevention step, damage in that same step is
    prevented, but damage that occurs after he goes to the graveyard (i.e.

  Creatures enter play in the order in which they are put into play.  So if
    one player puts a Legend into play, their opponent's Legend of the same
    name will be buried immediately after it is put into play and before the
    next creature is brought into play. [Aahz 06/28/94]

  Continuous effects of creatures entering play take immediate effect, but
    triggered effects (such as "when it comes into play" effects) wait until
    this spell is done resolving and are dealt with in one group.
    [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  Each creature is only looked at once by All Hallow's Eve.  If a creature 
    fails to enter play or goes to the graveyard during its resolution, it
    does not get looked at again. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

  Since the creatures enter play during upkeep, their upkeep costs (if any)
    need to be paid. [Aahz 06/15/94]

  A Clone or Doppelganger must choose a creature in play to copy.  If there
    is no such creature, then it cannot leave the graveyard. [bethmo 06/16/94]

  If a creature, such as a Clone, fails to be able to enter play when chosen
    (i.e. no other creature to Clone), then it stays in the graveyard and may
    not be chosen again by this All Hallow's Eve. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/95]

  Once all the counters are gone, it just sits there as an inert enchantment.

  Artifact becomes an Artifact-Creature.  It follows all the rules of
    creatures while still being an artifact.

  Animated artifacts are subject to the effects of summoning sickness.
    [Mirage Page 14]  Remember that all permanents get summoning sickness, but
    that only creatures are affected by it.  So whether or not you can use the
    animated artifact right away depends on whether or not it has summoning
    sickness.  It will not have summoning sickness if it has been in play on
    your side (creature or not) since the beginning of your most recent turn.

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition cards cannot be cast on
    artifact-creatures. The Revised one can be cast on them but has no
    effect. [Card Text]  Note that the Limited/Unlimited Edition card does
    not cause itself to be removed from play once the creature is Animated.
    [Aahz]

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition cards say that it destroys zero-cost
    artifacts.  This was meant to restate the obvious, a zero toughness
    creature dies, but the card text did not account for things like Castle
    which give +2 toughness when untapped.  So, the artifact is not
    destroyed just because its casting cost was zero, it is destroyed when
    its toughness reaches zero. [Snark]

  Enters play as a global enchantment and then becomes an Enchant Creature as
    a triggered effect upon entering play.  It follows all the rules for
    Enchant Creature cards from then on. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97] (Borrowed
    from Necromancy rulings)

  The bringing of the creature into play and then putting Animate Dead on it
    is all done as one triggered ability. [bethmo 02/25/97]  (Borrowed from
    Necromancy rulings)

  As a local enchantment, its only legal target is the one chosen when it
    entered play, thus there is no other legal target to move it to with
    Enchantment Alteration. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  (Borrowed from
    Necromancy rulings)

  In general, an animated creature comes out as if it was just cast.  Any X
    in the casting cost is zero.  So animating a Rock Hydra gives you
    a hydra with zero heads.  [Mirage Page 31]

  You can Animate a creature which was discarded from a hand and therefore
    was never in play.

  Animate Dead becomes a creature enchantment and thus counts for abilities
    that interact with creature enchantments, such as Rabid Wombat's.
    [Aahz 06/06/97]

  Animated creature cannot attack until it begins its controller's turn in
    play. [Mirage Page 14]

  Animating a dead Clone gets all the Clone's abilities but it mimics at -1
    power. [Snark]

  This is a targeted effect.  Note that cards in the graveyard do not have
    Protection from Color abilities, but it may fizzle because the target
    is removed before the effect resolves. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]

  When Animate Dead leaves play, the creature it is on is buried.
    [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]

  The caster of Animate Dead is not considered the "caster" of the creature
    that is brought back into play.  [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  If the creature phases out without the Animate Dead because Animate Dead
    has been affected by Spatial Binding, the Animate Dead is buried but the
    creature is not.  The creature will phase in perfectly normal since the
    Animate Dead ability did not bury it. [Aahz 02/16/97]

  The ability which allows a player to target this card with spells/abilities
    overrides all effects which prevent such from happening.  Thus, you can
    use the ability to get around Dense Foliage because this effect will be
    newer. [Aahz 06/16/97]

  You skip the next untap phase that you are not skipping for any other
    reason.  In other words, the skips save up until you skip as many as
    required. [Aahz 06/16/97]

  The Chronicles version only triggers the ability if Axelrod is the one that
    kills the creature.  The Legends version triggers even if the creature is
    killed later in the turn. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]

  The payment to prevent countering is treated as a triggered effect of using
    the ability.  The controller of the artifact pays when the triggere effect
    resolves if they want to prevent the countering. [bethmo 12/03/96]

  The Chronicles version has the artifact's controller pay to prevent
    countering.  The Legends version has the effect's controller pay to
    prevent countering. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100] This only matters if
    the artifact's controller changes and this is very rare during an
    interrupt step but it is possible.
