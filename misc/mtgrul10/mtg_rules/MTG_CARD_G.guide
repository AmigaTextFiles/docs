@{b}Gaea's Avenger@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Gaea's Avenger's power and toughness are each
    equal to the number of artifacts target opponent controls plus one."
    [Encyclopedia Page 132]  I added the "plus one" text since I'm sure they
    did not want to change the meaning of the card. [D'Angelo 12/16/96]

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes less useful but stays in play if the target player leaves the
    game. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

@node GAEBL "Gaea's Blessing"

@{b}Gaea's Blessing@{ub}

Gaea's Blessing:
+ It targets the player and each of the cards.  Thus, it is only a "spell with
    one target" if you choose to target zero cards. [DeLaney 09/08/97]
 
 @{" Card Information " link WL_GREEN.guide/GAEBL}

@node GAEAL "Gaea's Liege"

@{b}Gaea's Liege@{ub}

  If you have 5 Forests and your opponent has 10 Forests and the Liege
    takes 7 damage during an attack, that once the attack is over, the
    Liege is no longer attacking and will be killed. [bethmo]

  The "change to forest" effect cannot be prevented by Consecrate Land or
    removed by Tranquility because it is not an enchantment. [Snark]

  This can change any land (not just basic lands) into a Forest. [bethmo]

  A changed land is considered to be the new land type in all ways.  This
    is not just a change of name.  It changes the color of mana produced
    too. [Mirage Page 58]

  Will not add or remove Snow-Covered nature from a land.
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition versions of this card define conditions
    for "attacking" and "defending" when it should say "attacking" and
    "non-attacking". [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 79]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_GREEN.guide/GAEAS}

@endnode
@node GAEAT "Gaea's Touch"

@{b}Gaea's Touch@{ub}

  As errata, play the mana gaining effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

  Cannot put out multilands which generate green mana because they are not
    basic Forests.  They do count as part Forest but not _basic_ forests.
    [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 44]

  You have to say when you put the land out that it is the one you get because
    of Gaea's Touch. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]  Thus, you cannot put out
    a Forest, play Gaea's Touch, then play another land claiming that the
    first one was under Gaea's Touch.

  Can get a Snow-Covered Forest. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

@node GANGR "Gangrenous Zombies"

@{b}Gangrenous Zombies@{ub}

  Whether it does 1 or 2 damage is set on announcement depending on whether
    you have any Snow-Covered Swamps at that time and it is not changed if
    you gain or lose such Swamps afterwards. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 50]
    See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the General Rulings for more information.

@node GASEO "Gaseous Form"

@{b}Gaseous Form@{ub}

  The Legends version reduced damage dealt to the creature in combat to zero.
    The Fourth Edition version acts like a single creature Fog effect.  
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]  See the @{"Fog Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_FOGE} entry in the 
    General Rulings.

@node GTPHY "Gate to Phyrexia"

@{b}Gate to Phyrexia@{ub}

  The sacrifice is not optional.  It must be done each upkeep. [Aahz 03/18/97]

  The ability does target the artifact. [Aahz 03/18/97]

  If there is nothing to target with the destroy, you cannot announce the
    phase effect and therefore do not have to sacrifice anything.
    [D'Angelo 04/07/97]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_BLACK.guide/GATET}

@endnode
@node GAUMI "Gauntlet of Might"

@{b}Gauntlet of Might@{ub}

  As errata, it is of type "Artifact" and not "Continuous Artifact".
    [Encyclopedia Page 57]

  Multilands which have Mountain as one of their types produce an extra red
    mana when tapped for either color. [bethmo]

  This effect is applied after any land change effects (regardless of which
    enters play first), so Mountains do not produce two mana when Conversion 
    is in play.  See the @{"Land" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_LAND} entry in the General Rulings for more 
    information.

  If a Mountain is tapped using Twiddle or Icy Manipulator while the
    Gauntlet is in play, the owner of the Mountain gets one red mana added
    to their pool.  The Gauntlet says that if the land gets tapped, an
    additional red mana gets generated. [bethmo]

  Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Type I tournaments from 01/25/94 to 05/01/94.  It was removed once
    Antiquities and Revised Edition made it easier to destroy artifacts.

 @{" Card Information " link UL_ARTIFACT.guide/GAUNT}

@endnode
@node GAUCH "Gauntlets of Chaos"

@{b}Gauntlets of Chaos@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(5): Sacrifice Gauntlets of Chaos to exchange
    control of target artifact, creature, or land you control with target
    permanent of the same type that an opponent controls.  Bury all
    enchantments played on those permanents." [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  Targets both cards and swaps them during resolution. [Bethmo 02/28/96]
    If one of the cards in a swap is not legal on resolution, then that swap
    fails. [Aahz 03/02/96]

  Creatures with Artifact Ward on them may be selected, but this will cause
    the effect to fail and nothing will change hands. [Aahz 07/13/94]

  Before the errata, the Legends version of this card had only the one
    creature/land/artifact of your opponent's being selected when you declare
    this effect.  On resolution of the spell, you would first take control of
    that target, then select a target from your cards.  If you had no other
    cards to swap, then you must give back the one you took.  If the first
    target became invalid then the effect fizzles and no swap is made.

@endnode
@node GAZEO "Gaze of Pain"

@{b}Gaze of Pain@{ub}

  Does not target the creatures. [Aahz 07/19/96]

  The ability is used as a triggered effect at the end of blocking
    declaration.  At that time, you choose to either have them deal damage
    or to do damage to a target creature. [D'Angelo 04/07/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/GAZEO}

@endnode
@node GEMST "Gemstone Mine"

@{b}Gemstone Mine@{ub}

+ Burying this card when the last counter is removed is a triggered effect.
    It is not part of the last removal.  This makes it possible to sacrifice
    this card to Squandered Resources after the last counter is removed.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/06/97]

 @{" Card Information " link WL_LAND.guide/GEMST}

@endnode
@node GENER "General Jarkeld"

@{b}General Jarkeld@{ub}

  If a creature is removed from being a blocker of a specific creature, the
    effects that would have happened because it was declared as a blocker
    may or may not happen depending on the creature's blocking effect.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]  If the card text said that creatures
    "assigned to block" or "blocks" then the effect is not removed by
    removing the blocker.  If the card text said "blocking", then the effect
    probably does not happen.  See individual cards for rulings.

  If a creature is added as a blocker to a specific creature, the blocking
    effect of that creature may or may not happen depending on the creature's
    blocking effect. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]  If the card text said that
    creatures "blocking" then the effect happens.  If the card text said
    "assigned to block" or "blocks", then the effect probably does not happen.
    See individual cards for rulings.

  Can target any two attacking creatures but only works if both of them have
    at least one blocker when it resolves and when you are done choosing new
    blockers. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/GENER}

@endnode
@node GHAZB "Ghazban Ogre"

@{b}Ghazban Ogre@{ub}

  As errata to the Arabian Nights version of the card, add the text "If you
    are tied for highest life total, Ghazban Ogre does not change controller.
    If other players are tied for highest life total and you are not, choose
    randomly which player gets control of Ghazban Ogre."
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 136]

  It is up to the current controller as to when during upkeep that the Ogre
    looks for a new master.  This can be before or after any other upkeep
    steps are resolved or spells used. [bethmo]

  The Ogre's changing of controllers is a new effect each upkeep so it will
    take precedence over any other control effects.  This means that using
    Control Magic on a Ghazban Ogre won't guarantee that you keep it.

@node GHFLA "Ghostly Flame"

@{b}Ghostly Flame@{ub}

  Does not make red and black spells and permanents colorless.  They still
    have color.  A red spell cannot target a creature with Protection from Red
    due to this.  The spells just act like colorless sources when dealing
    damage. [D'Angelo 06/09/95]  

  If the source has more than one color but at least one is red or black,
    then the damage is colorless and all the other colors are forgotten.
    [D'Angelo 06/21/95]

  It does not change the color of the source, so that things that trigger on
    a red spell doing damage (such as Justice) will still trigger.
    [bethmo 04/18/96]  The damage itself thinks it came from a colorless
    source, however.

  The effect is continuous and applies whenever something looks at the damage.
    If this card leaves play, damage from red and black spells will appear as
    its normal color.  In other words, the color was not removed from the
    damage, the color just could not be determined while this card is in
    effect. [Aahz 03/17/97]

@node GIALB "Giant Albatross"

@{b}Giant Albatross@{ub}

  The ability is a triggered effect and can only be activated once just after
    this card goes to the graveyard. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 37]  The
    activation cannot include more than one payment of the cost.

  The ability works no matter how it goes to the graveyard.  It seeks out all
    creatures that damaged it during the turn and buries them. [Aahz 10/25/95]

  The ability works even if the damage is redirected to the Albatross.
    [D'Angelo 01/06/96]

  The effect does not actually prevent burial, it prevents the effect which
    will cause the burial. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

@node GIOYS "Giant Oyster"

@{b}Giant Oyster@{ub}

  If the creature being held by the Oyster phases out, there is no way to
    remove the counters it left on the creature. [Aahz 11/04/96]  The Oyster
    considers the creature to have left play, so will not affect it any more.

  If the Oyster untaps before the putting of a -1/-1 counter on the creature
    happens, the -1/-1 counter goes on when the effect resolves and then is
    removed immediately. [Aahz 12/07/96]  The effects of the -1/-1 counter,
    including possible death of the creature, are applied before the counter
    is removed. [D'Angelo 04/07/97]

 @{" Card Information " link HL_BLUE.guide/GIOYS}

@node GISHA "Giant Shark"

@{b}Giant Shark@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If Giant Shark is assigned to block a creature
    that has taken damge this turn, or a creature that has taken damage this
    turnn is assigned to block Giant Shark, Giant Shark gains +2/+0 and
    trample until end of turn.  Giant Shark cannot attack unless defending
    player controls at least one island.  Giant Shark is buried immediately
    if at any time controller controls no islands." [Encyclopedia Page 209]

  The result of the errata is that if a creature enters a blocking situation
    with the Giant Shark due to being part of a banded group of attackers or
    by an effect such as General Jarkeld, that the Shark will not get the
    bonus if that creature is damaged.  The bonus happens when the Shark is
    assigned to a specific creature which is damaged and the bonus is not
    removed if that creature is removed from the blocking situation by any
    means. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]

  Only gains its bonus if the blocking creature was damaged before blocking
    was declared.  Damaging the creature later will not give the Shark the
    bonus. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

  Only gets the bonus once, regardless of the number of blockers or their
    condition. [Aahz 10/21/94]

  Yes, it does remove itself from the game when used. [D'Angelo 08/02/95]

  If removed from play before his effect resolves, the target will still be
    removed from the game. [D'Angelo 06/21/95]  If the effect fizzles with
    regards to its target, the Spider is not removed from the game because the

  As errata, it should read "White spells cost an additional (3) to cast.
    White enchantments with activation costs require an additional (3) to
    activate." [Encyclopedia Page 30]

  The additional mana is paid at the same time the effect is announced.
    [bethmo 06/20/96]

  The extra mana is not considered part of the casting cost.  A Spell Blast
    would still only require the original casting cost as X in order to
    counter the spell. [Aahz 09/02/94]

  The extra mana is not considered part of the activation cost.  It is a
    separate cost.  [Aahz 09/02/94]  If an artifact enchantment (Copy Artifact)
    with an activation cost were Purelaced, Power Artifact could be used to
    reduce the base cost, but not the Gloom cost. [Aahz 12/13/94]

  The cost applies to each activation.  For example, if Holy Armor were 
    5 times, you'd have to pay Gloom 5 times. [D'Angelo 06/28/96]

  Farmstead's cost is an activation cost and so it is affected by Gloom.
    [D'Angelo 01/21/97]  As per the errata to Farmstead.

  The Limited and Unlimited versions of this card only affected the casting
    of white spells and the use of Circles of Protection.  The Revised
    and Fourth Edition cards affect any white spells and the use of white 
    enchantments with activation costs.  Players with Holy Armor and such 
    are in for a surprise.  Note that this does not include upkeep costs, 
    and that the Revised and Fourth Edition cards will not affect Circles 
    which are xxxxlaced to another color.
