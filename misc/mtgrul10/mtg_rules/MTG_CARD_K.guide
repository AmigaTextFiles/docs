@node KAESP "Kaervek's Spite"

@{b}Kaervek's Spite@{ub}

  The sacrifice of all your permanents and discarding of your hand is part of
    the casting cost and is paid on announcement.  You do not have a choice to
    pay this cost zero times or more than one time in order to multiply the
    effect. [D'Angelo 01/28/97]

  As always, you cannot sacrifice things you do not control.

@node KAETO "Kaervek's Torch"

@{b}Kaervek's Torch@{ub}

  The extra cost applies to all interrupts and not just to spells.  For
    example, the Daring Apprentice's effect would require 2 mana in addition
    to its other costs. [Aahz 01/22/97]

@node KARAK "Karakas"

@{b}Karakas@{ub}

+ Can only be used on "Summon Legend" cards, not on cards from the Legends

@endnode
@node KARMA "Karma"

@{b}Karma@{ub}

  Is considered one source of white damage and the damage comes in one
    packet. [Aahz 07/29/94]

  Amount of damage is locked in when effect is resolved and not when it is
    announced. [D'Angelo 10/05/95]

  The text was changed between the Alpha and Beta printings of the Limited
    Edition.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_WHITE.guide/KARMA}

@{b}Karplusan Giant@{ub}

  The land is tapped during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The effect cannot be announced if the

@node KEEPE "Keeper of Tresserhorn"

@{b}Keeper of Tresserhorn@{ub}

  The loss of life happens as a triggered effect that triggers when defense is
    chosen and resolves as soon as blocking choices are done.  It triggers if
    it has no blockers at that time. [Aahz 06/24/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_BLACK.guide/KEEPE}

@endnode
@node KELDO "Keldon Warlord"

@{b}Keldon Warlord@{ub}

  The power/toughness adjusts itself as a continuous effect that is
    recalculated after each effect resolves or anything happens which might
    change it.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_RED.guide/KELDO}

@endnode
@node KHABA "Khabal Ghoul"

@{b}Khabal Ghoul@{ub}

  Can collect counters for creatures that died during the turn in which it
    enters play, even if it enters play after they die. [bethmo]

+ Has always been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a
    deck) for Extended tournaments.

 @{" Card Information " link AN_RED.guide/KIRDA}

@endnode
@node KISME "Kismet"

@{b}Kismet@{ub}

  Cards enter play tapped.  They do not come into play untapped and then
    immediately tap,  therefore they do not trigger any effects due to
    tapping. [Aahz 06/28/94]  Face-down creatures due to Illusionary Mask will
    come into play tapped and face-down.

  You choose one player on casting and it only affects that one player.  This
    target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.  It becomes 
    useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

+ Does not affect cards phasing in. [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 30]

  As errata to the Legends version of the card, it should read "target player"
    instead of "opponent".  This means you can use it on yourself. 
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64] The Fourth Edition version says this.

  The Legends version only affects lands, creatures and artifacts played from
    your hand.  The Fourth Edition version affects generated token creatures,
    creatures brought into play by Animate Dead, and any other way to get
    a permanent into play. [bethmo 01/23/96]

@endnode
@node KJDEA "Kjeldoran Dead"

@{b}Kjeldoran Dead@{ub}

  If there are no creatures in play (other than this one) when it enters play,
    you have to sacrifice this card. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  The sacrifice is a triggered effect and not a cost.
    [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/KJELD}

@{b}Kjeldoran Elite Guard@{ub}

  Can be assigned as a blocker and then have its ability used.

  Can be used when opponent is declaring attack and defense.  Not just when
    you are. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/KJELI}

@endnode
@node KJFRO "Kjeldoran Frostbeast"

@{b}Kjeldoran Frostbeast@{ub}

    blocked by a creature, destroy that creature at end of combat."
    [Encyclopedia Page 87]

    is checked later. [Aahz 05/21/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_WHITE.guide/KJHOM}

@endnode
@node KJOUT "Kjeldoran Outpost"

@{b}Kjeldoran Outpost@{ub}

  You have the choice when it enters play to sacrifice the land or let this
    card be buried.  You may not use the mana source speed ability between the
    time when it enters play and before it gets buried because the sacrifice
    or burial is considered a phase cost. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
    (REVERSAL)  See @{"Comes Into Play Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CIPE} in the General Rulings for more
    information.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_LAND.guide/KJELD}

@endnode
@node KJPRI "Kjeldoran Pride"

@{b}Kjeldoran Pride@{ub}

  Does not target the creature it is moving itself to at the time it is moved.
    [bethmo 07/20/96]  Once on that creature, it targets the creature like any
    enchantment would.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_WHITE.guide/KJPRI}

@endnode
@node KJROY "Kjeldoran Royal Guard"

@{b}Kjeldoran Royal Guard@{ub}

  Only usable on combat damage from unblocked attacking creatures.  Any damage
    from effects (even while it is attacking and is unblocked) is not valid.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]

  Can be used during damage prevention, or it may be used earlier in the turn.
    [Aahz 11/07/96]

  If used earlier in the turn, it only works as long as it is in play.  Once
    it leaves play, the effect continues to try to redirect the damage but
    there is no place to redirect it so the damage stays where it is.
    [Aahz 11/07/96]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/KJROY}

@endnode
@node KNOTM "Knight of the Mists"

@{b}Knight of the Mists@{ub}

  Can bury an opponent's knight. [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]

  If no other knights are in play, pay the mana or bury this card.
    [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_BLUE.guide/KNIGH}

@endnode
@node KNOVA "Knight of Valor"

@{b}Knight of Valor@{ub}

  The ability is not Flanking and is not removed by an effect that removes
    Flanking. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 30]

  The activiated ability is not exactly the same as Flanking.  It affects all
    creatures blocking the Knight and not only ones assigned to block it.
    [DeLaney 02/02/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_WHITE.guide/KNIGH}

@endnode
@node KNOWL "Knowledge Vault"

@{b}Knowledge Vault@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...into your hand.  If you lose control of
    Knowledge Vault, bury all cards under it." [Encyclopedia Page 151]

  Taking a card from the library and placing it under the Vault does not
    count as drawing a card. [Aahz 08/11/94]

  The cost to retrieve the cards is like "0, Sacrifice Knowledge Vault:",
    except it is not really an activation cost.  The "2,Tap" cost only applies
    to putting a card under the Vault. [D'Angelo 11/08/96]

  The cards "under it" refers to the ones set aside by it.  If it is in the
    graveyard, it does not refer to the graveyard.

+ The card taken from your library must be from the top of the library.

@node KORMU "Kormus Bell"

@{b}Kormus Bell@{ub}

  As errata, the Fourth Edition version of this card should not say "black".
    The created creatures are not given a color. 
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

  See the @{"Animated Lands and Artifacts" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ANIM} entry in the General Rulings for
    more information.

  The Swamps are both lands and creatures at the same time.

  This does mean Swamps owned by any and all players.

  The lands can be killed as creatures or lands, so Wrath of God, Armageddon,
    Smoke, Winter Orb, and many others affect them.

  With Balance, consider them both as lands and as creatures.  Just remove
    whatever you have to in order to achieve "balance".  And yes, this does
    mean that they get double-counted :-(

  Consecrate Land does not protect the land from being affected by the Bell.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_ARTIFACT.guide/KORMU}

@endnode
@node KROVF "Krovikan Fetish"

@{b}Krovikan Fetish@{ub}

  As errata, this card should have you draw a card at the beginning of the
    next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.  [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  If it is moved to a new creature by something that moves enchantments,
    the controller of the Fetish get to draw another card.
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  You do not get a card if the target becomes illegal before it resolves.
    [D'Angelo 06/20/95]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/KROFE}

@endnode
@node KROPL "Krovikan Plague"

@{b}Krovikan Plague@{ub}

  It is played on a non-wall creature you control.  This is considered to
    be a targeting restriction.  The enchantment will bury itself if you lose
    control of the creature or if it somehow becomes a Wall.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 54]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_BLACK.guide/KRPLA}

@endnode
@node KROSO "Krovikan Sorcerer"

@{b}Krovikan Sorcerer@{ub}

  The cards are discarded from your hand during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]

  It is not a forced discard, so it cannot be used with Library of Leng.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]

  The Fifth Edition version of the card has 2 abilities instead of one, but
    the behavior of the card is identical to the Ice Age version since the
    Ice Age one was modal. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]  (See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the
    General Rulings)

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLUE.guide/KROVI}

@node KROVV "Krovikan Vampire"

@{b}Krovikan Vampire@{ub}

  You do not get the creature back if the creature is not still in the
    graveyard at the end of the turn. [Aahz 06/10/95]

  If the creature goes to the graveyard, then leaves the graveyard by some
    means, then the Vampire effect loses track of it.  It will not give you
    control of the creature even if the creature goes back to the graveyard
    before the end of the turn. [Aahz 11/21/95]

  You do get the permanent back if the card that went to the graveyard is
    no longer a creature. [Aahz 07/12/95]

  Works no matter how he damages the creature: in combat, in the Arena, or
    by some other effect. [D'Angelo 08/01/95]

  The Krovikan Vampire effect remembers who was controlling it when it damaged
    the creature.  At the end of the turn, the creature will come under that
    player's control.  If at that time, the player does not also control the
    Vampire, the creature is immediately buried again (as per the Vampire's
    text that you bury the creature if you lose control of the Vampire).

 @{" Card Information " link LG_ARTIFACT.guide/KRYSH}

@node KUDZU "Kudzu"

@{b}Kudzu@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If enchanted land becomes tapped, destroy that
    land, and its controller moves Kudzu to another legal target.  If he or
    she cannot, bury Kudzu." [Encyclopedia Page 53]

  If the land with Kudzu on it is destroyed by some spell or effect (rather
    than tapping) Kudzu is placed in the graveyard. [Snark]

  Yes, you can move it to any other player's land whenever you get to move
    it.  [Card text]

  Leaves play once there are no lands which it can be placed on. Consecrated 
    lands are protected. [bethmo]

  Although the person making choices with this spell changes regularly, the
    "controller" of the enchantment does not change.  It is always the caster
    who is the controller.

  If it is on a Strip Mine which is used, the Kudzu ability is triggered at
    the same time the Mine is sacrificed, but the Kudzu is buried as a 
    continuous effect before the trigger resolves.  Thus, the Kudzu does not
    move on. [D'Angelo 11/08/96]

  Note that it is not treated as if "just cast" when moved to the new target.
