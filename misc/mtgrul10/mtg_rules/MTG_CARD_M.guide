@node MAGIC "Magical Hack"

@{b}Magical Hack@{ub}

  As errata, play the effect as an instant when targeting a permanent and as
    an interrupt when targeting a spell. [Mirage Page 4]  The spell is still
    an "Interrupt" and not an "Instant" for effects that affect certain
    spell types. [Aahz 09/19/96]

+ See "Play as a..." in the General Rulings for more information.
  Alters all occurrences of a land word in the text box of the given card.
    [WotC Rules Team]

  Alters all occurrences of a land word in the text box of the given card.
    [WotC Rules Team]

  Can target a card with no land words on it. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]

  Cannot change a land word to the same land word.  It must be a different
    word. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]

  Cannot Hack proper nouns (i.e. card names) such as Island Fish Jasconius.
    [WotC Rules Team]

  The card forgets the change if it goes to the graveyard or is Unsummoned.
    [Chris Page]  In a multiplayer game, this means it persists even after
    the player who cast the Magical Hack leaves the game.

  Cannot add or remove the words "Snow-Covered".
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  If you respond to your opponent's use of this spell with another use so that
    the land word changes before the opponent's resolves, the opponent's will
    do nothing since no instances of the words they chose will be there.
    [bethmo 11/05/96]

  The Limited, Unlimited, and Revised Edition versions only can target
    cards or spells while the Fourth Edition on can target any permanent
    (including tokens) or spells. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLUE.guide/MAGIC}

@endnode
@node MAGUS "Magus of the Unseen"

@{b}Magus of the Unseen@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...activation cost.  If you lose control of
    the artifact at the end of this turn, tap it." [Encyclopedia Page 89]
    The artifact only taps when you lose control of it at the end of
    the turn.  It will not tap due to any other control changes.
    [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 27]

  Can be used on an untapped artifact.  Being tapped is not a targeting
    requirement. [Aahz 06/08/95]

  The artifact taps after returning to the opponent (if it is not already
    tapped), so any effects triggered off it tapping happen at that time.
    [Aahz 07/05/95]

  The Fifth Edition version clearly states that it is only tapped if it
    returns at end of turn where the Ice Age version had errata to say this.
    [D'Angelo 04/11/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLUE.guide/MAGUS}

@endnode
@node MALAC "Malachite Talisman"

@{b}Malachite Talisman@{ub}

  See @{"Hematite Talisman" link MTG_CARD_H.guide/HEMAT} for rulings.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/MALAC}

@endnode
@node MALIG "Malignant Growth"

@{b}Malignant Growth@{ub}

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [D'Angelo 10/15/96]

  It causes one draw effect of X cards, where X is the number of growth
    counters on this card. [Aahz 03/17/97]

  It has one packet of X damage, not X packets of one damage. [Aahz 03/17/97]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GOLD.guide/MALIG}

@endnode
@node MANAB "Manabarbs"

@{b}Manabarbs@{ub}

  Each land tapped acts a new trigger for damage, but all damage is from
    the same source. [bethmo]  This means each point of damage arrives in
    a separate "packet" and in a separate damage prevention step.

  You can get all the damage from Manabarbs into a single packet which is
    preventable by a single use of a Cicle of Protection by doing the
    following:  tap one land for mana, then in the damage prevention step,
    tap additional lands for mana.  When you do this, the additional damage
    gets added to the current damage prevention step (such steps do not nest)
    and all damage from one source in one damage prevention step merge into
    one packet of damage. [bethmo 12/13/96]

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition versions did damage whenever a land was
    tapped.  The Revised and Fourth Edition versions only do damage when the
    land is tapped for mana.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_RED.guide/MANAB}

@endnode
@node MANCL "Mana Clash"

@{b}Mana Clash@{ub}

  All the damage from the coin flips is saved up and happens when the spell
    is done resolving.  All the damage is collected into a single packet.
    Thus you need to power a Circle of Protection: Red only once for this.
    [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

  Always affects the caster and targets another player.  The Dark versions
    can be affected by Reflecting Mirror so that both coin flips are done
    by the caster.  Either version can be redirected to a third player.
    [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  The Fourth Edition version of this card cannot target the caster, while The
    Dark version could. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_RED.guide/MANAC}

@endnode
@node MANCR "Mana Crypt"

@{b}Mana Crypt@{ub}

  As errata, play the mana producing ability as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

  The coin flip is an upkeep effect and not an upkeep cost.  You can use the
    Crypt before dealing with the upkeep effect and thus avoid the coin
    flip entirely.  This works because if it is tapped at the end of upkeep,
    it is turned "off" like all artifacts are when tapped.
    [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 44]

+ Has always been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a
    deck) for Extended tournaments.

 @{" Card Information " link PC_CARD.guide/MANAC}

@endnode
@node MANDR "Mana Drain"

@{b}Mana Drain@{ub}

  Gives you colorless mana. [Aahz 12/06/94]
 
  The mana gain is done as a beginning of main phase effect and not as a
    mana source or such. [D'Angelo 11/08/96]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLUE.guide/MANAD}

@endnode
@node MANFL "Mana Flare"

@{b}Mana Flare@{ub}

  When used with multilands produces 2 of one color, not one of each.
    [bethmo 05/12/94]

  When used with Urza's lands (and other colorless producing lands) they
    produce one extra colorless mana each. [bethmo 05/12/94]

  Only produces extra mana when land is tapped for mana, not when tapped by
    Twiddle or for some other effect. [bethmo]

  Applies to all players in multiplayer games. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

  Mana Flare adds one of whatever color the land produces after applying any
    land type or color changing effects. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 130]

  If the land produces more than one color or type of mana at a single time,
    such as with Balduvian Trading Post, you choose which kind of mana the
    Mana Flare actually provides. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 26]

  Any restrictions on the mana generated by the land are copied along with
    the color. [bethmo 12/07/96]

  The mana is provided when the triggered ability resolves.
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  (REVERSAL)  It used to actually modify the
    mana generating effect to make more mana.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_RED.guide/MANAF}

@endnode
@node MANMA "Mana Matrix"

@{b}Mana Matrix@{ub}

  Only reduces the generic mana portion of a spell's cost.  If the spell
    does not accept generic mana or accepts less than 2, you get a reduced
    or null effect from this card. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 9]

  Only affects its controller, not all players. [bethmo 06/15/94]

  Only works on instants, interrupts and enchantments.  It does not work on
    sorceries, or other spell types.  So, you can't use it on a Fireball.
    [bethmo 06/16/94]

  Although the apparent cost is reduced, the "casting cost" of the spell for
    reasons of Spell Blast or such is still the full amount.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 9] Just think of the Matrix as contributing
    2 to the cost, not reducing it.

  Multiple Matrices do add up.  Two will contribute up to 4 toward the cost,
    and so on. [bethmo 06/29/94]

  No, it does not affect mana sources. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_ARTIFACT.guide/MANAM}

@endnode
@node MANSH "Mana Short"

@{b}Mana Short@{ub}

  If you play Mana Short in response to a spell, it will have no effect on 
    that spell since the mana has already been paid. [D'Angelo 11/08/96]

  Since this is an instant, your opponent may use any fast effects in
    response to the casting of this spell.  Note that such effects will be
    resolved before the mana pool is emptied by the Mana Short. [bethmo]
    This makes it useless as a countermeasure for spells.  To use it
    effectively, you need to use it during Upkeep and even then it will not
    prevent the use of instants and other fast effects.

  Taps all lands, even if they do not normally produce mana.
    [D'Angelo 07/17/95]

  As errata to the Limited, Unlimited and Revised Edition versions of this
    card, it should read "target player" instead of "opponent".  This means 
    you can use it on yourself.  [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]  The Fourth
    Edition version says this.

  The text was changed between the Alpha and Beta printings of the Limited
    Edition.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLUE.guide/MANAS}

@endnode
@node MANVA "Mana Vault"

@{b}Mana Vault@{ub}

  The Fifth Edition card text is "Mana Vault does not untap during your untap
    phase.  At the end of your upkeep, if Mana Vault is tapped, it deals 1
    damage to you.  {4}: Untap Mana Vault at end of upkeep. Use this ability
    only during your upkeep.  {Tap}: Add three colorless mana to your mana
    pool.  Play this ability as a mana source."

  You can untap a Mana Vault with mana from a Mana Vault or Basalt Monolith 
    and you can untap a Basalt Monolith with mana from a Mana Vault. 
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]  This is a REVERSAL of a ruling made on page 79
    of Duelist Magazine #3.

  The untap ability can be used even when it is tapped.  See the @{"Artifacts" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ARTI}
    entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  Because both the damage and untapping are done at end of upkeep, you can
    choose to either untap it first or take the damage first.
    [D'Angelo 04/11/97]  I can't think of too many reasons to want to take
    the damage, though.

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition versions of this card do not require the
    untap cost to be paid during upkeep as the Revised Edition version does.
    You can pay to untap it at any time. [bethmo]

  The Fourth Edition version of this card has a normal activation ability
    which can be affected by things like Power Artifact. [Aahz 08/15/95]

  The Fifth Edition version has the untap ability used at the end of upkeep
    instead of during upkeep. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]

@node MANVO "Mana Vortex"

@{b}Mana Vortex@{ub}

  As errata, it is buried (not destroyed) if there are no lands in play.
    [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]

  Consecrate Land cannot be used to prevent a sacrifice.
    [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

+ You have to sacrifice a land right after announcement of casting this card
    and prior to interrupts being used or it is countered. [Aahz 09/18/96]

+ The sacrifice due to the phase ability is done during the resolution of
    that ability. [Aahz 09/15/97]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLUE.guide/MANAV}

@endnode
@node MANWE "Mana Web"

@{b}Mana Web@{ub}

  The player can tap as many lands for mana as they want before the effect
    of this card taps the rest of their lands of that type.  So it does not
    prevent a player from getting mana into their pool.  It just forces them
    to do so all at once.  Remember that they cannot save mana across phases
    or through an attack. [D'Angelo 06/12/97]

  This affects lands that can produce a "type of mana".  This includes
    color (or lack of color) combined with any limitations, so tapping a
    Mishra's Workshop for mana only has this card tap other lands which
    produce "colorless mana that can only be used to cast artifacts".
    Ones that just produce colorless mana without restriction are not
    affected. [bethmo 06/25/97]

+ It only affects lands which are produce the type of mana which the land
    which was tapped for mana can produce.  It does not tap every lands which
    produce mana of any sort. [D'Angelo 08/22/97]  In other words, read it
    as "any type of mana that the land which was tapped can produce" instead
    of "any type of mana that land cards can produce.".

+ Remember that the lands are tapped as an effect and not as a cost, so the
    lands will not produce mana because of this.  Players will not be forced
    to take mana burn. [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]

  The 2 life from having it discarded is gained at end of turn. 
    [Aahz 10/21/96]

  Being forced to discard this card causes one "at end of turn" effect that
    does two things.  If the card is not still in the graveyard at end of
    turn, however, you still get the life. [Aahz 10/21/96]

@node MANTO "Mangara's Tome"

@{b}Mangara's Tome@{ub}

  As errata, ignore the first line break on the card.  Removing the cards from
    the game is a function of the "comes into play" effect rather than an
    independent ability of the Tome. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  The getting of cards from the Tome is not considered a "draw".
    [Aahz 10/21/96]

  The ability is a specialized effect that replaces a draw. 
    [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

@{b}Maro@{ub}

  Can be sacrificed to a spell that is being cast, and which would leave your
    hand empty.  Your hand is not actually empty until the announcement is
    done and by that time Maro has been sacrificed.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]

  If Infernal Harvest is the last card in your hand and it is announced, the
    Swamps come back into your hand at the same time (not before or after)
    the Infernal Harvest leaves your hand.  Thus, there is no time when you
    have no cards and Maro will die. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]

@node MARGO "Marsh Goblins"

@{b}Marsh Goblins@{ub}

  The text on the card explaining the color is considered to be explanatory
    and not characteristic text.  This means that it cannot be affected by
    Sleight of Mind and is not copied by copy cards such as Vesuvan
    Doppelganger.  [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 22] This is true even under the
    new rulings made on 12/03/96 for the Crimson Kobold (and other Kobolds).

  This card can have its color changed by a lace spell but not by
    Sleight of Mind. This is a REVERSAL of a ruling in Duelist Magazine #2

  See the @{"Poison" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_POIS} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  The Fourth Edition version will give a poison counter to its controller if

  It is not considered a damage prevention or redirection spell at the time

  Only one bodyguard can take damage for you during a turn.  Whichever
    bodyguard triggers first will win for that turn.  If the first damage
    which would qualify for either comes from an unblocked artifact creature,
    you have the option of which one takes the damage. [Aahz 10/21/94]

  The redirection takes place automatically at the end of the first step of 
    damage prevention.  This is not a fast effect used during damage
    prevention but you can use other prevention effects before this one
    kicks in.  If there is more than one automatic effect, the person
    damaged can choose which order to apply them.  This damage will result
    in a second damage prevention step to follow this one.
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  If a Limited or Unlimited Edition Veteran Bodyguard is available as well,
    unblocked artifact creature damage must go to a Martyr because its text
    overrides the Veteran Bodyguard.  All other unblocked creature damage
    can and will be taken by your Limited or Unlimited Veteran Bodyguard. 
    [Aahz]

  If a Revised Edition Veteran Bodyguard is available, only one of your
    Bodyguards can take damage even if one of the other Bodyguards is a
    Limited or Unlimited Edition one.  This means that you may choose among
    your various Bodyguards which one takes creature damage (with Martyrs
    usable for artifact creature damage).  Note that if a Martyr takes some
    artifact damage (creature or not) then none of the other Revised
    Bodyguards may take damage for you, even if the damage is not artifact
    damage.
