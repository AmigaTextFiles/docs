  The Rulings Summaries for Magic: The Gathering (TM), a Collectable Card Game
  by @{"Wizards of the Coast" link WOTC}, are just normal textfiles and have no links
  whatsoever to each other. @{"Stephen D'Angelo" link STEPHEN_D'ANGELO} is doing a great job putting
  the rulings together each month.

  So to make things easy for you, this Guide was made, first by @{b}Tom de Ruyter@{ub}
  and now by us.

  We hope you enjoy it.

  --------
  All  the rulings are collected by @{"Stephen D'Angelo" link STEPHEN_D'ANGELO} and produced in two text
  files  which  are distributed once a month.  He should take all the credits
  for the contents of these text files.

  Most of the card  descriptions are taken  from  the socalled "Devjoes List"
  (version 7.0)  which is  distributed  irregularry by  @{"Joseph W. DeVincentis" link DEVINCENTIS}
  on the Internet.

  Descriptions  for  Alliances  &  Mirage  were taken from the Spoiler Lists,
  which  were  distributed  on the Internet by Neutral Ground, a store in New
  York/USA.   This company has it's own homepage (http://www.nground.com) and
  can be reached by Email at info@nground.com.

  Descriptions  for Visions, Fifth Edition and Weatherlight were  taken  from
  the Spoiler Lists, which are  distributed on the Internet by Wizards of the
  Coast themselves.

  Flavor Texts for Homelands, Alliances & Mirage were taken from my own cards.
  All others came directly from a homepage on the Internet.

  All  other  information,  like  the  "Reserved  List" are taken from either
  articles in Magazines like The Duelist (TM) and Scrye (TM) or directly from
  text files distributed on the Internet.

                            -------------------

  - Add the Fifth Edition Texts for all cards EXCEPT Artifacts, Black,
    Blue and a part of the Green cards. These have been done.

  - Add current print-run numbers per card (Current lists have them
    already included, except for Alliances, Mirage, Visions, Fifth
    Edition, Weatherlight and Portal as there is no information available
    from WoTC yet). Please note, that We removed this information
    from the current lists and made it available per edition in the
    @{"Printing Information" link MTG_CARD_RULINGS.guide/PRINT_INFO}.

  - Add flavor text for each card (Mirage, Visions, Fifth Edition and
    Weatherlight have to be done entirely)
   
  - Make an alphabetical list of all artists, including links to the
    cards they have made. Still not finished, due to Visions and the
    new release of MTG Fifth Edition. More than 200 cards (!!) have
    new art in this edition :((
    Also Weatherlight made its entry last month, so this can take some
    time too.

  - Add most wanted cards list.

  - Add some Decks, SENT US YOUR FAVOURITE DECKS AND MAYBE WE ADD IT IN OUR LIST!!

  - There will be a COMBO list in the next update, sent us your COMBO`s.
