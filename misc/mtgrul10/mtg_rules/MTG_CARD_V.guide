@{b}Vampiric Tutor@{ub}

  The payment of 2 life is part of the casting cost and is paid on
    announcement.  You do not have a choice to pay this cost zero times or
    more than one time in order to multiply the effect. [D'Angelo 01/28/97]

+ This one works differently from the other Mirage tutor cards when Field of
    Dreams is in play.  You reveal the top card after shuffling and before the
    tutored card is put on top, then you reveal the tutored card.  The other
    tutors only show the tutored card. [bethmo 06/21/97]

@{b}Varchild's War Riders@{ub}

  The token creatures are controlled by your opponent, but they are owned by
    you.  This means you can use a Despotic Scepter on them. [bethmo 01/09/97]

@node VENAR "Venarian Gold"

@{b}Venarian Gold@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "When Venarian Gold comes into play, put X
    counters on Venarian Gold and tap enchanted creature.  That creature..."
    [Encyclopedia Page 162]  The Encyclopedia said "each" when it should say
    "enchanted". [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

  Once all the counters are gone, it just sits there as an inert enchantment.
    [bethmo 06/17/94]

  If the enchantment is moved with Enchantment Alteration, the number of
    counters is set to 0 (since X is zero while a card is in play) and is
    not increased or left the same. [D'Angelo 07/15/96] This is based on a
    ruling made by the Rules Team on 9/22/95 regarding Cocoon.

@node VENOM "Venom"

@{b}Venom@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Whenever enchanted creature blocks or is blocked
    by a non-wall creature, destroy that creature at end of combat."
    [Encyclopedia Page 46]

  A non-wall creature blocking or any creature blocked by this card gets a
    "destroy at end of combat" effect on it when it is assigned as a blocker
    or this card is assigned to block it.  An effect is added to a creature
    which becomes a blocker by any means, including being part of a band which
    is blocked or by being moved into blocking or being blocked by an effect
    such as General Jarkeld.  This effect stays even if the creature is
    removed from the blocking situation by an effect like General Jarkeld.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  If this enchantment is moved onto a creature after blockers are assigned,
    creatures blocking the newly enchanted creature are not affected.  This
    is because the effect triggers on at the time blocking occurs.
    [D'Angelo 12/13/96]

@node VENBR "Venomous Breath"

@{b}Venomous Breath@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "All creatures that are blocking or blocked
    by target creature are destroyed at end of combat."
    [Encyclopedia Page 101]

  It only affects creatures blocking the target when this spell resolves.
    [Aahz 09/19/96]  The effect will still happen even if the creature stops
    being a blocker after the effect resolves.  General Jarkeld is one way
    to do this. [D'Angelo 09/19/96]

@node VERDU "Verduran Enchantress"

@{b}Verduran Enchantress@{ub}

  See the @{"Activation Cost" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ACTI} entry in the General Rulings for more information
    on what "use this effect only once" means.

  The effect is a triggered effect.  Whenever you successfully cast an
    enchantment, you immediately get the option of drawing a card.  This
    draw effect resolves immediately.  It does not wait for other spells
    to be announced or resolved. [Aahz 01/07/95]

  Does not trigger on the moving of an enchantment from one permanent to
    another. [D'Angelo 07/25/95]

  Does trigger on enchantments that are cast as instants.
    [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 28]

  The Fourth Edition version has an activation cost while the Limited,
    Unlimited, and Revised Editions just had an ability.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

@node VESUV "Vesuvan Doppelganger"

@{b}Vesuvan Doppelganger@{ub}

  See the @{"Copy Cards" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_COPY} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

+ As errata, it should read "When Vesuvan Doppelganger comes into play, it
    acquires all characteristics except color of target creature.  During
    controller's ..." [Encyclopedia Page 55]  This errata is a bit flawed.
    It should say "Vesuvan Doppelganger comes into play with all the
    characteristics except ...".  The above text erroneously looks like a
    triggered effect.  [DeLaney 07/11/97]

  The Doppelganger of an artifact creature can be Shattered or Disenchanted.

  Can only switch creatures once per upkeep phase. 
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]  It is a phase effect.

  Cannot switch to the same creature it is currently a copy of.  But if
    there are two of those creatures, it could copy one on one upkeep and
    copy the other the next.  [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]

  Any upkeep costs on externally imposed on the Doppelganger must be paid
    before it can change forms. [Aahz 01/14/97]

  The Doppelganger can switch forms before paying upkeep on the current form.
    This is because the form switching ability is on the core card while the
    upkeep is considered to be on the form it currently has.  Unpaid upkeep
    costs on the form will not prevent it from switching. [Aahz 11/08/96]

  If switching to a creature, the upkeep costs of the new for must be paid
    before the end of upkeep (if the creature has any).
    [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 15]

  Damage is not removed when it changes forms. [D'Angelo 09/09/95]

  Animating a dead Doppelganger gets all the Doppelganger's abilities but
    it mimics at -1 power. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  The "normal characteristics" text means that you treat the Doppelganger
    as having the exact same text on it as the original card had.  This
    includes name, casting cost, power/toughness, etc.  It does not gain
    any enhancements the original creature may have had temporarily through
    Instants like Giant Growth or through Enchantments. [bethmo]

  When the Doppelganger switches creatures, the creature it used to be is
    considered to have left play.  This means that if it was a Gaea's
    Liege, converted lands revert to their old form, and that if it was
    Aladdin, stolen artifacts return to the owner as normal. [bethmo]

  When it switches forms, the new form is not considered to be entering play.
    Effects that trigger off it entering play, even on the card itself, will
    not trigger.  Thus, switching to a Pyknite will not allow you to draw a
    card. [D'Angelo 12/21/95]

  If it is a Tetravus and changes forms to something else (leaving some 
    Tetravite tokens in play) then changes back to a Tetravus later, the old
    tokens will not consider this to be the same Tetravus they came from, so
    they will not be able to move onto the Doppelganger/Tetravus.
    [Aahz 03/02/96]

  Whenever it changes forms, it "resets" and loses any counters or other
    gains it made as the creature it was originally copying. 
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123] This affects creatures like Clockwork 
    Beast, Fungusaur, Sengir Vampire and Thallids.  If any of those gains
    resolve after the change resolves, the gain is removed immediately after
    it takes effect.  For example, if you pay B to use a Frozen Shade ability
    and respond to it by changing forms, the form change resolves first, then
    the +1/+1 resolves and ends immediately. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

  When changing forms, it keeps counters due to enchantments, effects of 
    other spells or permanents, and targeted effects due to its own abilities 
    whether or not they are not represented by counters.  
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123] This includes things like a Giant Growth,
    pumping up using Fire Breathing, or even use of Dwarven Warriors' or
    Dwarven Weaponsmith's _targeted_ abilities.  It does not include 
    non-targeted abilities like the Frozen Shade's "B:+1/+1" ability or 
    counters such as the Sengir Vampire gets.  Also, if switching from a 
    Thallid, Spore counters gained as the Thallid are lost, but ones from 
    Fungal Bloom will stay in case they are useful later. 
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  When changing forms, the text changes from Magical Hack and Sleight of Mind 
    are lost in the change along with the old text. [D'Angelo 02/27/95]

  When changing forms, it does not get any counters that the creature being 
    copied would have received when cast, although it would get those counters
    when cast. [WotC Rules Team 02/27/94]  Thus, a Doppel of a Clockwork
    Beast would get counters if it copied the Beast when cast, but would not
    get any if it changes form to a Clockwork Beast.

  The Shyft color is a built in ability and the color set is lost when 
    changing away from this form. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]

  A Doppelganger of a Clone is just a copy of the creature the Clone
    copied. [PPG Page 224]

  A Doppelganger of a Doppelganger is just a copy of the creature the other
    one was copying.  It does not nest abilities and give you multiple
    form switches a turn. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

  This spell is targeted, so a creature with Protection from Blue cannot be
    copied. [WotC Rules Team]

  The Doppelganger is targeted and will check the validity of the target
    when declared and when resolved.  If the target becomes invalid before
    resolution on casting the Doppelganger, then the spell fizzles.  If it
    becomes invalid before resolution of a shape change, then the change
    fizzles and it keeps its current form. [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]
    If it fizzles, it may not try to switch forms again that turn.
    [Aahz 01/14/97]

  The Doppelganger is treated as a Summon Creature card even if it is 
    copying an artifact creature.  Thus, spells that affect Summon Creatures, 
    such as Dance of Many, can be used on a Doppelganger of anything. 
    [Aahz 09/15/94]

  When it switches forms, cumulative upkeep on the creature it was copying
    stops and any new cumulative upkeep for the new form starts over.  If the
    cumulative upkeep is on the Doppelganger itself, however, it does not
    reset. [Aahz 03/02/96]

  When it takes on the characteristics of the other card, it is still of type
    Summon Doppelganger and it still has the switching ability.  These
    characteristics are all that it keeps.  It does not keep the name
    Vesuvan Doppelganger. [Aahz 03/18/97]

+ When it changes forms, it does not trigger any "comes into play" abilities
    and it is not a new creature "entering play" for effects such as Eye of
    Singularity. [Aahz 07/09/97]

@node VETER "Veteran Bodyguard"

@{b}Veteran Bodyguard@{ub}

  If a creature is blocked but Trample damage is still done to a player,
    this damage cannot be redirected to the Bodyguard because the Bodyguard
    only takes damage from unblocked creatures. [bethmo]

  If a creature which does Trample damage is not blocked, the damage is
    taken by the Bodyguard.  The damage loses its Trample nature.  [Snark]

  Damage goes to the Bodyguard as long as he is untapped.  This works
    even if he is blocking. [Peterson 11/01/94]

  The redirection takes place automatically at the end of the first step of 
    damage prevention.  This is not a fast effect used during damage
    prevention but you can use other prevention effects before this one
    kicks in.  If there is more than one automatic effect, the person
    damaged can choose which order to apply them.  This damage will result
    in a second damage prevention step to follow this one.
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  Cannot be used against spell or other non-creature attack damage.  Note
    that the Prodigal Sorcerer and other creatures have non-attack ways to
    deliver damage, but only attacking creature damage can be used on a
    Bodyguard.

  Only usable on damage from unblocked attacking creatures that is dealt due
    to the attack.  Any damage from effects (even while it is attacking and
    is unblocked) is not valid. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]

  Redirected damage retains its color and any other abilities. [Snark]

  If a Martyr of Korlis is in play, unblocked artifact creature damage must 
    go to a Martyr because its text overrides the Veteran Bodyguard.  All 
    other unblocked creature damage can and will be taken by your Veteran
    Bodyguard. [Aahz]

  If you have more than one Bodyguard, only one takes the damage, because once
    the damage is redirected, it no longer exists to be directed to other
    bodyguards. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]  You can choose which one takes
    the damage when you decide the order of resolution of such effects.

  In the Limited and Unlimited Editions, the Bodyguard did not state that
    only one of them could take damage during a given turn, but this turns
    out to be true under the current rules anyway.  One the damage is
    redirected to one of them, the damage no longer exists to be redirected
    to any others. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]

  Can be used even on a creature with summoning sickness.  Summoning sickness

  Targets the specified number of mountains, so you can't use it for more
    damage than you can find mountains to target. [PPG Page 223]

  Can be used with X equal to zero.  This is useful if no Mountains are in
    play. [bethmo]

  You must pick which Mountains are targeted when the spell is cast. 
    [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  Casting Magical Hack on Volcanic Eruption will not allow you to change the 
    targets of the spell because you chose the targets when the spell was 
    declared and before a Hack can interrupt it.  The Hack will just cause 
    it to fizzle.  [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]  It may not fizzle on multilands
    that are half mountain and half of the new land type specified.

  The Limited/Unlimited Edition version of this card does X damage even if
    some of the Mountains are removed.  This is because the damage is in no 
    way tied to the number of mountains destroyed, just the number of mountains
    originally targeted.  It does zero damage, however, if all the mountains
    are removed since a spell fizzles if all of its targets are invalid.
    The Revised Edition version of this card only does damage for each land

  As errata, it should read "At the beginning of your upkeep, put one pin
    counter on Voodoo Doll.  If Voodoo Doll is untapped at the end of your

    counters on Voodoo Doll, and is buried.  (X)(X),(Tap): Voodoo Doll deals
    X damage to target creature or player, where X is equal to the number of
    pin counters on Voodoo Doll." [Encyclopedia Page 208]
    [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]

  All of the 'X's on this card refer to the number of counters on the card.
    Paying twice the number of counters and tapping the Doll does damage
    equal to the number of counters. [bethmo 06/15/94]

  If Power Artifact is applied to the Doll, each activation will cost X+X-2
    with a minimum cost of 1. [Aahz 07/25/94]

  Adding a counter to the Doll is considered an upkeep cost.  This cost must
    be paid before you can use the card. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  The Chronicles version gets a counter at the beginning of upkeep while the
