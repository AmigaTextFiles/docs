@{b}Earthbind@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "When Earthbind comes into play, it deals 2 damage
    to enchanted creature if that creature has flying.  Enchanted creature
    loses flying." [Encyclopedia Page 52]

  The two damage happens only once.

  If Flight is cast on an Earthbound creature, it gains flying again.  In
    general, if two enchantments contradict each other, the most recently
    cast wins. [Mirage Page 29]

  The damage is done after it enters play and not as part of the casting of
    the spell.  It is something the permanent does while in play.  This means
    the damage is not subject to Justice.  [Aahz 01/03/96]

  The Limited and Unlimited Editions of this card were only castable on
    flying creatures.  The Revised Edition card can be cast on any creature
    but has no effect on non-flying creatures.  Note that the Limited and 
    Unlimited versions of this spell do not remove themselves once the 
    creature is not flying.

  See the @{"Enchant Land" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ELND} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  The land is tapped during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The effect cannot be announced if the
    land is not in an untapped state. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]

  It is buried if you lose control of the target land.

  This is not a targeted spell, so it may be cast when there are no

  Whether or not a creature is not Flying is only checked on resolution.

@node EATER "Eater of the Dead"

@{b}Eater of the Dead@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Remove a creature card in any graveyard from
    the game: Untap Eater of the Dead.  Use this ability only while Eater of
    the Dead is tapped." [Encyclopedia Page 168]

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  The card in the graveyard is removed from the game during announcement and
    as a cost.

  It untaps during the resolution of its effect.  This makes it possible to
    empty a graveyard of creatures by using this effect repeatedly in one
    batch of spells. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 27]

  It still untaps as normal during untap unless otherwise prevented.  The 
    ability is not inhibited by other effects that prevent normal untapping 
    such as Meekstone, Paralyze, Smoke, etc.  [Aahz 08/10/94]

@node EBHOR "Ebony Horse"

@{b}Ebony Horse@{ub}

  The Arabian Nights and Revised Edition versions of this card made the
    creature treated as if it never attacked.  The creature is not considered 
    to have attacked for purposes of "attack or die" effects like Siren's
    Call. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94] 

  With the Arabian version, the Clockwork Beast did not last until the end 
    of combat so it does not lose a counter. [bethmo 08/08/94]

  The Fourth Edition version of this card only untaps the creature and makes
    it neither take nor deal damage.  It is still attacking, however.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_ARTIFACT.guide/EBONY}

@endnode
@node EKUND "Ekundu Cyclops"

@{b}Ekundu Cyclops@{ub}

  It must be declared in the first group of attackers you declare.  You
    cannot declare some attackers, then declare this one in a second attacker
    declaration step. [Aahz 01/14/97]

+ If Errantry is put on it, then it will not be able to attack if other
    creatures attack.  This is because Errantry will prevent it.  It either
    attacks alone or not at all.  [Aahz 06/14/97]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_RED.guide/EKUND}

@endnode
@node ELDRU "Elder Druid"

@{b}Elder Druid@{ub}

  The decision to tap or untap is made on announcement before target is
    selected. [D'Angelo 10/04/95]  See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the general rulings
    for more information.

  The choice of target gives free range of lands, creatures and artifacts.
    You do not lock in on one type as a casting decision. [D'Angelo 10/04/95]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_GREEN.guide/ELDER}

@endnode
@node ELLAN "Elder Land Wurm"

@{b}Elder Land Wurm@{ub}

  It becomes free to attack once it has been assigned as a blocker once.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  Since it cannot attack until it has blocked at least once, it can be
    effectively killed by a Nettling Imp or Siren's Call effect before
    then. [Aahz 06/24/94]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_WHITE.guide/ELDER}

@endnode
@node ELEEL "Electric Eel"

@{b}Electric Eel@{ub}

@node ELHAJ "El-Hajjaj"

@{b}El-Hajjaj@{ub}

  The Arabian and Revised Edition versions give you life for the total 
    amount of unprevented damage inflicted regardless of the toughness of the
    target.  For example, if an El-Hajjaj with Unholy Strength is blocked by
    a 1/1 Goblin, you get 3 life, but if a Samite Healer prevents one point,
    you get 2 life.  The Fourth Edition version only gives you life up to a 
    maximum of the creature's toughness or player's life total.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_BLACK.guide/ELHAJ}

@endnode
@node ELKIN "Elkin Bottle"

@{b}Elkin Bottle@{ub}

  This is not considered to be drawing a card. [Aahz 06/12/95]

  If the Bottle leaves play or your control, the spell remains waiting until
    used or until your next upkeep. [Aahz 06/13/96]  The card is in the "set
    aside" zone.  See @{"Zones" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ZONE} in the General Rulings for more information.

  The card is not part of your hand in any way.  You cannot be forced to
    discard it due to a discard from hand effect.  When you play it, it is
    played following rules as if it were being played from your hand (e.g. a
    Sorcery is played as such and is not played as an instant).  
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]

  You cannot play a card from the Elkin Bottle onto an Ice Cauldron.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]  (See the @{"Ice Cauldron" link MTG_CARD_I.guide/ICECA} for more info)

  Word of Command cannot be used to force a player to play a spell off the
    Bottle. [Aahz 12/18/95]

  You can get a creature card onto the Bottle when Enduring Renewal is in
    play. [D'Angelo 12/04/95]

  The card is removed at the beginning of upkeep (not during or at the end)
    if it isn't played. [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 44]

  The Fifth Edition version gives you until the beginning of the next turn
    and buries the card while the Ice Age version gave you until the beginning
    of the next turn's upkeep and removed the card from the game.

@{b}Elvish Healer@{ub}

  You choose on announcement whether you are preventing 2 damage to a green
    creature or are preventing 1 damage to something else. [Aahz 06/13/96]
    See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  If you choose to prevent 2 damage to a green creature and it is not green
    on resolution, the effect fizzles.  Similarly, if you choose to prevent 1
    damage to a non-green creature and it is green on resolution, the effect
    fizzles. [Aahz 11/15/96]

  See the @{"Moving Enchantments" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MOVI} entry in the General Rulings for more
    information.

  Cannot move an enchantment to an illegal target. [Card Text]

  Only targets the enchantment and not either of the things the enchantment
    may be on. [Aahz 07/09/95]

  You can move a Blue Ward since it offers protection to the creature and not
    to itself. [bethmo 09/14/94]

  If it is Deflected, you cannot change the choice of destination.  You can
    only change the enchantment which will be moved to that destination.
    [D'Angelo 10/31/95]  And you can change it to an enchantment which would
    be illegal to move to the destination.  In which case the enchantment
    is not moved. [Aahz 03/17/97] (REVERSAL)
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLUE.guide/ENCHA}

@endnode
@node ENDUR "Enduring Renewal"

@{b}Enduring Renewal@{ub}

  Token creatures are removed from the game (as a continuous effect) if they
    leave play, so this effect will not let you get them in your hand.
    [D'Angelo 06/08/95]

  The creature discarding effect is a triggered effect and as such will not
    do anything until after the draw effect completely resolves.  Thus, if
    you play Brainstorm, you can draw a creature and put it back onto the
    library before the triggered effect happens... and thereby not have to
    discard it at this time. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]

  You can use Resurrection or Safe Haven to get creatures into play.
    [D'Angelo 06/14/95]  This is because the creatures come to your hand in
    some way that is not considered a "draw".  Enduring Renewal only affects
    creatures that are "drawn".

  If you Animate Dead a creature and then the Animate is removed, the creature
    goes to your hand. [D'Angelo 06/14/95]

  If the creature is only a creature due to an effect, it still comes to your
    hand. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]  This includes Mishra's Factory,
    Titania's Song and any other way to animate a card.

@node ENEAR "Energy Arc"

@{b}Energy Arc@{ub}

  Can be used on untapped creatures as well.  They won't deal damage either.
    [D'Angelo 07/10/96]  The trick is that it says to untap any number of
    target creatures and the other part of the effect works even if the card
    is already untapped.

  Can be used outside of an attack and on any player's creatures.

@node ENEFL "Energy Flux"

@{b}Energy Flux@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "All artifacts gain; During your upkeep, pay an
    additional (2) or bury this artifact." [Encyclopedia Page 27]  It gives
    the artifact an upkeep cost.

  There is an upkeep cost imposed on the artifacts.  They cannot have their
    abilities used until this upkeep is dealt with.  See the @{"Upkeep" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TO_UPKEEP} entry
    in the @{"Turn Order" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TURN_ORDER} section of the General Rulings for more information.

  Under the old rules, it was possible to use a mana source after not paying
    the upkeep but before it was buried.  This is no longer true.

  The Fourth Edition version differed from the Antiquities and Revised 
    Edtion versions in that it implied a destroy at once effect with a cost
    to prevent destruction rather than an upkeep cost.  Errata has been
    issued to make all the cards act alike.

    [Encyclopedia Page 209]  The book erroneously says "(1): Tap..."
    [D'Angelo 12/18/96]

  See the @{"Enchant Land" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ELND} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  Can be used to counter any spell which would result in the destruction
    of one or more of your lands.  For example a Shatter cast on an
    Assembly Worker or even a Lightning Bolt at an animated land.
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  Cannot be used to counter non-spell effects such as Demonic Hordes or
    others which destroy lands. [bethmo 06/14/94]

  Cannot be used to counter a spell like Demonic Hordes which creates a
    possibility of a land being destroyed at a later time. [bethmo 06/15/94]

  Cannot be used to counter a spell which would indirectly cause destruction
    of one of your lands.  For example, casting Resurrection on a Mold
    Demon or casting Terror on a creature while Earthlink is in play.
    [Aahz 11/21/95]

  Cannot be used to counter a spell which has a random chance of destroying
    a land, such as Falling Star or Chaos Orb. [Aahz 04/16/96]

  Cannot be used to counter a spell which requires sacrificing when it enters
    play such as Mold Daemon or Wood Elemental. [Aahz 11/07/96]
    Or ones that requires sacrificing as part of the casting cost.
    [Aahz 12/17/94]  

  Balance can be countered only if you have more lands than someone else in
    play when Equinox is announced and resolved. [Aahz 11/11/95]

  Does not stop the sending of the land from play into its owner's hand.
    [Aahz 06/16/94]  Or to anyplace other than the graveyard.

  The land is tapped during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The effect cannot be announced if the

  You choose which targets to phase out. [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]

  The number of excess lands, artifact and creatures is not counted until
    resolution.  This also means that the targets to be phased out are not
    chosen until resolution of the effect either. [DeLaney 01/28/97]  This
    is because you do not know on announcement which ones will be excess at
    the time of resolution.

  If tapped and unable to attack, they still do 2 damage to the controller
    of this card. [Snark]

  The text about not damaging you only applies to its ability.  It can still
    damage you for other reasons. [Aahz 12/07/96]

  The Arabian Nights version of this card has two versions, one with a small

  As errata, it should read "All players may take any permanent in their hand
    and put it directly into play, until no one wants to play any more
    permanents.  No other spells or effects of any kind may be used while
    Eureka is in effect.  IF a spell has an X is its casting cost, X is 0."
    [Encyclopedia Page 209]

  The cards played during Eureka all enter play one at a time.  This means
    that if two of the same Legend are put into play as the result of this
    spell that the second one is buried, not both of them.  [Aahz 06/22/94]

  You keep putting cards out until both/all players say they are done.  It is
    not just until one player says they are done.  You alternate simply to 
    stop one player from putting out too many cards in a row when the other 
    player wants to play some.  Another way to think of this is to go around 
    the table.  Each player may play a card or pass.  Eureka ends once an 
    entire pass around the table is made where everyone passes.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 8]

  The cards are just put into play.  They are not cast, and so they cannot be
    countered, will not trigger "gain 1 life when" or other effects (such as
    the Verduran Enchantress) that can only be used when a spell is cast.
    [Aahz 09/02/94]  Similarly, they can be played on creatures, like Autumn
    Willow, that cannot be targeted by spells and effects... since these are
    considered to be neither at the time. [bethmo 02/23/96]

+ Local enchantments can be played on creatures, like Autumn Willow, that
    cannot be targeted by spells and abilities... since these are considered
    to be neither at the time. [bethmo 02/23/96]  And a Skulking Ghost won't
    die since it was not targeted by a spell or ability. [bethmo 08/21/97]

  Any abilities that trigger due to these cards coming into play do not
    actually resolve until after the entire Eureka effect is done resolving.
    [Aahz 10/25/95]

  Continuous effects of cards put into play happen immediately.
    [Aahz 12/18/95]  For example, Kismet.

  If a Clone tries to enter play when there are no creatures in play, it
    stays where it is because it has no legal target. [Aahz 10/28/96]

  Cards cannot be put into play illegally. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]

  Cannot be used on effects that cause loss of life.  This includes
    Shahrazad, Channel, and death of a Personal Incarnation.  It can only
    be used on damage. [bethmo]

  Since it does allow you to reduce damage, you may use a Circle of
    Protection or other form of damage prevention to reduce the damage and
    still do full damage to your opponent. [bethmo]

  Can be used during damage prevention even though it is not a damage
    prevention or redirection effect.  It's an exception. [Aahz 06/12/95]
    It is used during and not at the end of damage prevention. [Aahz 10/07/96]

  Can only be used during a damage prevention in which the player is
    damaged.  It cannot be used retroactively like Reverse Damage and
    Simulacrum can. [Aahz 06/06/94]

  Does white damage to your opponent.

  Is not targeted, so it cannot be Deflected. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]  This
    reverses an entry in Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57.

  Cannot be used if there is no "packet" of damage for it to check against.

     permanents.

  Since phasing in does not cause comes-into-play effects to trigger, it is

  If a duplicate Legend is cast while this is in play, both Legends are
    buried.  One from the duplicate Legend rule and the other from this card.
    [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 28]

  If a copy card such as Clone enters play, the permanent it is copying is
    buried and the copy card stays in play. [bethmo 05/23/97]
