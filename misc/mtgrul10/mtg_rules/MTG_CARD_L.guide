@{b}Lake of the Dead@{ub}

  You have the choice when it enters play to sacrifice the land or let this
    card be buried.  You may not use the mana source speed ability between the
    time when it enters play and before it gets buried because the sacrifice
    or burial is considered a phase cost. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
    (REVERSAL)  See @{"Comes Into Play Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CIPE} in the General Rulings for more
    information.

  The tap and sacrifice counts as tapping the land for mana for purposes of
    Manabarbs. [D'Angelo 07/17/96]

@node LANDE "Land Equilibrium"

@{b}Land Equilibrium@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Whenever any opponent puts a land into play, if
    he or she controls at least as much land as you do, he or she sacrifices
    a land." [Encyclopedia Page 151]

  You sacrifice a land after you put one into play and not before.
    [D'Angelo 01/18/95]

  This is a triggered effect, so it's possible to tap the land that just
    entered play for mana (as a mana source) prior to dealing with the
    trigger. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  The effect is cumulative.  If you have 2 of them, the other player must
    sacrifice two lands for each one put into play.

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLUE.guide/LANDE}

@endnode
@node LANDS "Land's Edge"

@{b}Land's Edge@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Any player may choose to discard a card from his
    or her hand; if that card is a land, Land's Edge deals 2 damage to target
    player." [Encyclopedia Page 64]

  The discard is a cost. [Aahz 11/07/96]

  The damage done when you discard a land only applies to lands which are
    discarded by choice using the Land's Edge ability.  It does not work
    on forced discards of any type. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 8]

  You cannot use the Library of Leng ability to place a discarded card on
    top of your library when using the Land's Edge ability to discard when
    you want to because this is a discard by choice. [Aahz 07/25/94]

  The effect is an instant speed effect.  It works as if it said "discard a 
    land: Land's Edge deals 2 damage to target player.  This ability can be 
    used by any player and not just the controller of Land's Edge."

 @{" Card Information " link LG_RED.guide/LANDS}

@endnode
@node LANDT "Land Tax"

@{b}Land Tax@{ub}

  As errata, the card should read "During your upkeep, if any opponent
    controls more land than you, you may search your library, remove up to
    three basic land cards, reveal them to all players, and put them into your
    hand.  Shuffle your library afterwards." [Encyclopedia Page 34]

  This is a phase effect used during your upkeep.  If you have two of them,
    you can use each of them once each turn. [bethmo 07/26/94]

  Can get a Snow-Covered land out. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

  Only counts lands when announced and will not fail if you no longer have
    fewer lands when it resolves. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]

  A common strategy is to use Strip Mine if both players have the same
    amount of land.  Use a Strip Mine to destroy an opponent's land, then use 
    Land Tax in response.  At that time your Strip Mine is gone, but the
    opponent's land is not destroyed yet. [Bethmo 05/22/96]

  Was on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (none allowed in a deck) for
    Type II tournaments from 01/01/97 to 04/24/97 and is now banned because
    it is no longer in the base set.  It was previously on the restricted list
    (only 1 per deck) for Type II tournaments from 07/01/96 to 01/01/97.
    Was been banned from type I.5 tournaments from 07/01/96 unto 04/01/97.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_BLUE.guide/LATNA}

@endnode
@node LAVAB "Lava Burst"

@{b}Lava Burst@{ub}

  Only creatures cannot have this damage prevented or redirected.  Players
    can prevent or redirect the damage normally.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8]

  Automatic abilities which prevent or redirect damage are not prevented by
    Lava Burst from doing so.  Only spells/abilities for which you have to
    choose whether or not to use them are prohibitied from working.
    [Aahz 11/07/96]

  Effects which reduce damage to zero are not considered the same as spells
    and effects that prevent damage, so these effects still work when Lava
    Burst is used. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  You can tap this card before you draw for a turn, and still draw as normal. 
    [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  You may tap multiples of these in the same instant because the requirement 
    for 7 cards is checked only at the time of tapping and not at the time of
    drawing.  Only targeted effects are checked at both declaration and 
    resolution.  [Aahz 06/22/94]

  Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Type I tournaments since 05/02/94.  Has always been banned for
    Type I.5 tournaments.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_BLUE.guide/LIBRA}

@endnode
@node LIBLE "Library of Leng"

@{b}Library of Leng@{ub}

  You can discard to the top of the library when using Bazaar of Baghdad,
    Sindbad or Wheel of Fortune because they are forcing you to discard.
    [Aahz 07/26/94]

  You cannot discard to the top of the library when using Land's Edge because
    this is a voluntary rather than forced discard. [Aahz 07/25/94]

  A card put on top of your library still counts as discarded for effects 
    such as Psychic Purge. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]

  Your opponent does not get to see the card you put on top of your library.
    [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]

  The Library of Leng only has an effect on your discard phase if it is in 
    play and untapped when your discard phase would start.  It will not make 
    you skip the phase if it becomes active during that phase. 
    [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95] See @{"Phase Skipping" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHAS} in the General Rulings for
    more information.

  If more than one card is discarded due to a single effect, you get to
    decide whether or not to use the Library on each of the cards in the
    discard.  It is not an all-or-nothing effect. [Aahz 06/11/96] 
    If the discard is chosen, the order of discarding is chosen by the player
    who is discarding.  If the discard is random, then randomly choose one 
    card at a time and decide on the use of the Library of Leng after each
    card is chosen. [Mirage Page 54]

  The Limited and Unlimited versions of this card would not allow you to
    discard during discard phase even if you had more than 7 cards in your
    hand.  The Revised and Fourth Edition versions of this card cause you to 
    skip the discard phase entirely.  This distinction is very subtle, but the
    newer cards allow you to avoid spells such as Cursed Rack.

  If the Limited or Unlimited Edition Library of Leng is destroyed during
    the discard phase, then you must discard down to 7 cards as per
    normal.

  The Fifth Edition version no longer has the reminder text that you can look
    at a randomly discarded card before choosing where it goes.  This is
    still true, however. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_ARTIFACT.guide/LIBRA}

@endnode
@node LICH_ "Lich"

@{b}Lich@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "You lose all life.  If you gain life in the game,
    instead draw one card from your library for each life.  For each 1 damage
    dealt to you, sacrifice a card in play.  If Lich leaves play, you lose
    the game." [Encyclopedia Page 57]

  When this enters play, your life total is reduced to zero.  You do not lose
    by having 0 or less life while Lich is in play. [Aahz 11/08/96]

  If you are at negative life points, Lich will not raise you back up to
    zero life.  It only lowers you to zero if you have a positive life total.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  You can lose life, and thereby have a negative life total, while Lich is
    in play.  Losing life is not damage and will not cause you to sacrifice
    cards. [Aahz 11/08/96]

  You cannot pay life, just like any player at less than one life cannot pay
    life (well, maybe zero life).

  This can only be played on yourself, not on opponents. [PPG Page 221]

  Cards destroyed by taking damage generate death events and in all ways are
    similar to normal sacrifice actions. [Aahz 07/05/95]

  Cards are sacrificed during the side-effects part of damage prevention 
    (which is the same time Hypnotic Spectre would make you discard).  
    [D'Angelo 12/04/95]

  Cards are sacrificed so Protection from Black has no effect. [bethmo]

  The phrase "If Lich leaves play, you lose the game" is an absolute
    statement.  Casting a Healing Salve or using a "lucky charm" after the
    destruction (or other means of leaving play) will not save you.
    [WotC Rules Team 01/29/94]

  The loss of life from Greed is a payment, so Greed cannot be used by a Lich
    (since a Lich has no life to pay). [Aahz 02/21/95]

  If you play Simulacrum after destroying some cards, you do not get them
    back. [bethmo]

  If you have multiple Lich cards in play, you must destroy 1 card for each
    damage done to you for each Lich.  This is because the destruction is
    a triggered effect.  But you only draw 1 card for each life gained
    regardless of how many Liches you have.  This is because the draw is a
    replacement effect and not a triggered one. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
    (REVERSAL)  You lose if any one of the Liches leaves play.

  If you take more than one damage at a time, sacrifice the cards for that
    damage simultaneously. [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]  This allows you to
    sacrifice both a creature and the Animate Dead that is on it all at once.

    if you announce the upkeep effect while it has no -1/-1 counters and then
    it gets damaged before the upkeep effect resolves.

+ This card's effect replaces damage with placement of -1/-1 counters, so

    Magnus. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 9]

@{b}Lord of Atlantis@{ub}

  Does not grant the abilities to itself. [PPG Page 225]

  The abilities begin once the Lord is in play and immediately cease if it
    leaves play.

  Grants the abilities to all Merfolk controlled by all players. [Snark]

  The Revised and Fourth Edition cards are "Summon Lord" while the Limited and
    Unlimited Edition ones are "Summon Lord of Atlantis".  This currently has
    no effect on play, however. [Aahz 10/06/94]  Actually, the An-Zerrin
    Ruins can be affected by this difference.

@node LOPIT "Lord of the Pit"

@{b}Lord of the Pit@{ub}

  If you have a creature, you must sacrifice it.  The "or take 7 damage"
    option can only be taken if no creature can be sacrificed.  
    [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 15]

  You can sacrifice a Lord of the Pit to a different Lord of the Pit, but
    you cannot simultaneously sacrifice them to each other.  [Aahz 09/14/94]

  A sacrifice of a creature cannot be prevented by either player. [Page 62]

  Can select creatures with Protection from Black to be sacrificed. [Aahz]

  COP:Black can be used to avoid damage from being unable to pay the upkeep.
    [Snark]

  The Revised and Fourth Edition versions of this card say that it cannot be
    sacrificed to itself while the Limited and Unlimited Editions do not say
    this.  It seems like errata to the pre-Revised cards will be issued, but
    it has not yet.

@node LOTRE "Lord of Tresserhorn"

@{b}Lord of Tresserhorn@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "When Lord of Tresserhorn comes into play, lose 2
    life and sacrifice 2 creatures, and..." [Encyclopedia Page 113]

  Since this is a loss of life and not a payment, your life total can be
    reduced below zero by this. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 27]

  If he enters play, you do as much of the "when he enters play" text as
    possible.  If you have less than 2 creatures in play, he must be one of
    the ones sacrificed. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32]

+ Cannot tap it for mana until after you sacrifice the two lands.  This is
    because the comes into play text is a cost that must be paid before you
    can use the ability. [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]

@node LURE_ "Lure"

@{b}Lure@{ub}

  Remember that Lure does not give a creature the ability to block the Lured
    creature, it just forces those creatures which are already able to block
    the Lured creature to do so.

  Opponent does not have to power special effects in an attempt to make all
    creatures block the Lured creature.  For example, you do not need to
    power a Goblin Balloon Brigade to block a flying creature with Lure,
    but if you do power it, the Brigade must block. [bethmo]

  If a Lured creature is in a band, only blockers able to block the Lured
    creature are affected by the Lure. [bethmo]
