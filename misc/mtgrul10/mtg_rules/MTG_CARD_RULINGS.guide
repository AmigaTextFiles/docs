                           -------------------------

  The Limited Edition was printed in two parts--the Alpha printing and Beta
    printing.  The entire Limited Edition was printed with black borders on
    the face of the cards.

  The Alpha printing used a different corner radius on the cards than all
    further printings.  The radius was about 2 mm instead of the 1 mm which
    has been standard since then.  The printing contained 295 unique cards.
    Approximately 2.6 million cards were printed.  Cards were available
    from late August 1993 through late September 1993.

  Print Run numbers per card for the Alpha edition are:
    Rare     = 1,100
    Uncommon = 4,500
    Common   = 16,000
    Land     = 85,500 (per picture)

  The Beta printing added one new picture for each of the five lands plus 2
    new cards to the set to raise the total to 302 cards.  Approximately
    7.8 million cards were printed.  Cards were available from mid October
    1993 until mid December 1993.

  Print Run numbers per card for the Beta edition are:
    Rare     = 3,200
    Uncommon = 13,500
    Common   = 48,000
    Land     = 171,500 (per picture)

  In the Alpha printing, 23 cards had errors which were corrected in the
    Beta printing.  These cards are: Basalt Monolith, Birds of Paradise,
    Channel, Circle of Protection: Red, Cyclopean Tomb, Death Ward, Demonic
    Hordes, Drain Life, Elvish Archers, Force of Nature, Icy Manipulator,
    Island Sanctuary, Karma, Mana Short, Orcish Artillery, Orcish
    Oriflamme, Phantasmal Forces, Red Elemental Blast, Rock Hydra, Sedge
    Troll, Tropical Island, Twiddle and Unsummon.

  The Unlimited Edition cards were printed with white borders on the face
    of the cards.  In all other ways this edition matched the Beta printing
    of the Limited Edition.  Approximately 40 million cards were printed. 
    Cards were available from mid January 1994 through mid March 1994.

  Print Run numbers per card for the Unlimited edition are:

                           -------------------------

  The Revised Edition was released in order to clean up a number of rules
    problems that the Limited and Unlimited Edition rules had.  The cards 
    still had white borders, but the fake 3-D beveling was removed, and the 
    art was lightened up considerably.  Printing size is not known but is 
    estimated to exceed 750 million cards.  Cards were available from mid 
    April 1994 through mid April 1995.

  Print Run numbers per card for the Revised edition are:
    Rare     = 289,000
    Uncommon = 1,012,000
    Common   = 3,657,000
    Land     = 12,969,500 (per picture)

  About half of the cards had text or formatting changes.  The list is too
    long to include here.  35 of the cards in the First Edition were
    retired, and 39 cards from the Arabian Nights and Antiquities
    expansions were added, bringing the total card count to 306 cards.

  The Fourth Edition was released in order to rotate the contents of the
    basic set.  The rulebook was updated to include most of the rules from
    the Legends expansion and to be much clearer on some points.  The cards
    still have white borders but the color was made much richer and
    "copyright 1995" was added to the base of the cards.  Cards were
    available from May 1995 well past the end of the run in April 1997.

  Print Run numbers per card for the Fourth Edition are:
    Rare     = 353,500
    Uncommon = 1,060,500
    Common   = 3,600,000
    Land     = 6,222,000 (per picture)

  50 cards were removed from the set and 122 cards were added bringing the
    set size up to 378 cards.  The extra 72 cards came from the fact that 
    lands were removed from the common and uncommon sheets and moved to a 
    separate sheet.  Basic lands appear in starter decks and not in
    booster packs.

  The Fifth Edition was released in order to rotate the contents of the

    more detailed.  The cards still have white borders and "copyright 1997"
    is on the base of the cards.  Cards were available from March 1997 
    through the current date.

  128 cards were removed from the set and 199 cards were added bringing the
    set size up to 449 cards.  Mostly cards from Fallen Empires, Ice Age, 
    Chronicles and Homelands were rotated in.  Basic lands appear in starter

  The Arabian Nights expansion set was printed with black borders on the
    face of the cards.  Cards can be identified by the expansion symbol on
    the right hand side of the middle section of the card.  The
    expansion symbol is a Scimitar (a sword). The set contained 78 unique
    cards, but 14 of these have two variants so collectors consider it a 92
    card set.  Approximately 5 million cards were printed.  Cards were
    available from late December 1993 until late January 1994.

  The Erg Raiders, Oubliette, Fishliver Oil, Giant Tortoise, Naf's Asp,
    Wyluli Wolf, Bird Maiden, Rukh Egg, Army of Allah, Moorish Cavalry,
    Piety, and War Elephant have versions with light and dark backgrounded
    colorless mana symbols.  The Hasran Ogress and Stone Throwing Devils
    have a variation with whitish versus orangish black mana symbols in the
    casting cost.

  Print Run numbers per card for the Arabian Nights edition are:
    Uncommon 2 = 20,500
    Uncommon 3 = 31,000
    Uncommon 4 = 41,000

    Common 4   = 124,000
    Common 5   = 155,000
    Common 11  = 341,000 (Desert)

  Cards were written under the Limited/Unlimited Edition ruleset and so have
    a lot of unclear wordings.

  The Visions expansion set was printed with black borders on the face of the 
    cards.  Cards can be identified by the expansion symbol on the right 
    hand side of the middle section.  The expansion symbol is a fancy letter 
    V.  The set consists of 167 unique cards.  It was released in early 
    February 1997.

  Preview boosters were released in the Multiverse Gift Set in November 1996.
    These boosters had a different wrapper, and said they were a Special
    Edition on the back of the wrapper.  25 cards were released this way.
    They are: Bull Elephant, Dark Privilege, Feral Instinct, Giant Catepillar,
    Goblin Recruiter, Gossamer Chains, Jamuraan Lion, King Cheetah, Knight of
    the Mists, Lichenthrope, Lightning Cloud, Necrosavant, Ovinomancer, Peace
    Talks, Rock Slide, Shrieking Drake, Talruum Champion, Tempest Drake, 
    Undiscovered Paradise, Undo, Urborg Mindsucker, Vampirism, Viashino
    Sandstalker, Warrior's Honor, and Wicked Reward.

  Several cards in the preview boosters differ slightly from the final 
    versions.  King Cheetah's preview version does not have its name 
    capitalized in the flavor text.  Viashino Sandstalkers has a similar lack
    of capitalization of Sandstalkers in the flavor text.  Ovinomancer's 
    preview version's text wraps differently; the text "{Tap}: ... owner's 
    hand:" fits on one line.  Peace Talk's preview version's text wraps 
    differently; the second line ends with "...an attack".  And all the black
    cards (Dark Privilege, Necrosavant, Urgorg Mindsucker, Vampirism, and
    Wicked Reward) have slightly longer copyright lines on the preview 
    versions than the final versions.

  The Portal set is not an expansion to the main Magic: The Gathering game.
    It is instead a new game based on the same rules, but with many complex
    issues removed from the game.  It has a certain amount of compatibility
    with the core Magic game, but it is not entirely the same.

  Portal was printed with black borders on the face of the cards.  Cards can
    be identified by the expansion symbol on the right hand size of the middle
    section.  The expansion symbol is a circle with radial lines on it that
    is supposed to remind you of a tunnel or possibly a door.  The set 
    consists of 220 unique cards.  It was released in early June 1997.
