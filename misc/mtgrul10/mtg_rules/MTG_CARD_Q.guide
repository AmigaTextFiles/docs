  Will only affect the land as long as it is producing white mana.  If the
    land type is changed to something else, the effect will continue if the
    new land type also makes white mana, but will do nothing if the land does
    not produce white mana.  Note that the effect is not removed, however, and
    it will resume as soon as the land qualifies for being affected again.
