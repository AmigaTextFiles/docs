@node JABAB "Jabari's Banner"

@{b}Jabari's Banner@{ub}

+ If a creature gains Flanking after blockers are assigned, the Flanking
    ability will not give them the -1/-1.  Flanking must be on the creature
    before blockers are assigned because that is when Flanking triggers.
    [Duelist Magazine #19, Page 34]

@node JADEM "Jade Monolith"

@{b}Jade Monolith@{ub}

  It is used during damage prevention for damage.  It is not used
    retroactively.  [D'Angelo 05/31/95]
 
 @{" Card Information " link 4E_ARTIFACT.guide/JADEM}

@node JACQU "Jacques le Vert"

@{b}Jacques le Vert@{ub}

  Does indeed give the +0/+2 bonus to itself since it is green as well as
    other colors.  [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]

@endnode
@node JADEM "Jade Monolith"

@{b}Jade Monolith@{ub}

  It is used during damage prevention for damage.  It is not used
    retroactively.  [D'Angelo 05/31/95]
 
 @{" Card Information " link 4E_ARTIFACT.guide/JADEM}

@node JADES "Jade Statue"

@{b}Jade Statue@{ub}

  See the @{"Animated Lands and Artifacts" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ANIM} section in the General Rulings for
    more information.

  As errata, it should read "(2): Jade Statue is a 3/6 artifact creature until
    end of combat.  Use this ability only when choosing attack or defense."
    [Encyclopedia Page 57]  It should more correctly read "...when declaring
    attackers or blockers". [D'Angelo 03/17/97]

  It can only be a creature during attack phases and therefore it is difficult
    to get creature enchantments placed on it. [PPG Page 223]

  Paying mana to use it for defense does not tap it. [bethmo]

  It is legal to power it up even if it is already a creature.  This will
    set its power and toughness to 3/6. [Aahz 06/13/96]

  It cannot be used for attack the turn in which it enters play on your side.
    [WotC Rules Team]  The Pocket Player's Guide FAQ incorrectly says that you
    can.  Ignore it.  [Duelists' Supplement, 5/94]

  The statue is destroyed at the end of the turn if it attacks when
    Berserked. [Snark]  Similarly for any other effect which kills it at
    the end of the turn, even though it is not a creature then. [bethmo]

  If Animate Artifact is used on it, you get a 4/4 artifact creature which
    becomes a 3/6 artifact creature during an attack phase if 2 mana are
    spent. [bethmo]  While animated, it can have enchantments placed on
    it.  Once the Animate Artifact is removed, all Enchant Creatures will
    be removed because they no longer apply. 

  The effect can be paid for during the Declare Attackers or Declare Defenders
    steps of the attack phase.  This is one of the few effects which can do
    this.  [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

 @{" Card Information " link UL_ARTIFACT.guide/JADES}

@endnode
@node JANRI "Jandor's Ring"

@{b}Jandor's Ring@{ub}

  When used with Howling Mine, Ancestral Recall, etc. you must draw one
    card at a time and decide with each card if you want to use the Ring.
    You do not draw all the cards then decide to use the Ring on one of
    them. [Snark]

  This is not a triggered ability.  It is a specialized ability used just
    after your draw.  It can be used during the resolution of an effect.
    [Aahz 10/25/95]  This means that it happens before triggered abilities
    like Zur's Weirding. [Aahz 03/02/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_ARTIFACT.guide/JRING}

@endnode
@node JAYEM "Jayemdae Tome"

@{b}Jayemdae Tome@{ub}

  In the Limited and Unlimited Edition, the term "Mono Artifact" was used
    to indicate that tapping was part of the use cost.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_ARTIFACT.guide/JAYEM}

@endnode
@node JESCA "Jester's Cap"

@{b}Jester's Cap@{ub}

  If the player has less than 3 cards in their library, just remove all the
    cards that are there. [D'Angelo 05/13/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/JESCA}

@endnode
@node JESTE "Jester's Mask"

@{b}Jester's Mask@{ub}

  The player's hand and library are mixed together, so that any cards from
    their hand which are not left in their hand get shuffled back into the
    library. [DeLaney 03/03/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/JESMA}

@endnode
@node JEWAM "Jeweled Amulet"

@{b}Jeweled Amulet@{ub}

  As errata, play the mana producing effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/JEWEL}

@endnode
@node JEWEL "Jeweled Bird"

@{b}Jeweled Bird@{ub}

  Yes, it does intend for you to make the Bird into your ante.  Your old
    ante goes to your graveyard, and you get to draw a new card to replace
    the bird.

  Note that the card is exchanged for your entire contribution to the ante.
    This means that it replaces all the cards if you have more than one
    already contributed! [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]

  The Arabian Nights version has an activation cost because it is a Mono
    Artifact and as such has errata to have "{Tap}:" as a cost.

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a deck)
    for Classic (Type I) and Standard (Type II) tournaments since 01/25/94
    because it is only used in games for Ante.  Now banned in
    Standard (Type II) because it is no longer in the base set.  Has always
    been banned from Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) and Extended tournaments.

 @{" Card Information " link AN_ARTIFACT.guide/JEWEL}

@endnode
@node JIHAD "Jihad"

@{b}Jihad@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Choose a color.  As long as target opponent has
    cards of this color in play, all white creature gain +2/+1.  Jihad must
    be buried immediately if at any time opponent has no cards of this color
    in play." [Encyclopedia Page 209]

  Only the basic colors can be used. [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]  Note that lands and
    artifacts have no color.

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only looks at that one 
    player for the color of their cards.  If that player leaves play, they 
    will have no cards of the appropriate color in play so Jihad will be 
    destroyed. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]
 
 @{" Card Information " link AN_WHITE.guide/JIHAD}

@endnode
@node JOHAN "Johan"

@{b}Johan@{ub}

  The text "any of your creatures" means as many as you want.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 8]
 
  Because you can declare attackers in waves, you can declare Johan last and
    thereby get all your other attackers to attack without tapping.
    [D'Angelo 11/08/96]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/JOHAN}

@endnode
@node JOHTU "Johtull Wurm"

@{b}Johtull Wurm@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "For each creature assigned to block Johtull Wurm
    beyond the first, Johtull Wurm gets -2/-1 until end of turn."
    [Encyclopedia Page 86]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_GREEN.guide/JOHTU}

@endnode
@node JOVFE "Joven's Ferrets"

@{b}Joven's Ferrets@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If declared as an attacker, Joven's Ferrets
    gets +0/+2 until end of turn.  Whenever Joven's Ferrets is blocked by a
    creature, tap that creature at end of combat and the creature does not
    untap during its controller's next untap phase." [Encyclopedia Page 201]
    The Encyclopedia entry mistakenly said "block" instead of "is blocked by".
    [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

 @{" Card Information " link HL_GREEN.guide/JOVEN}

@endnode
@node JOVIA "Jovial Evil"

@{b}Jovial Evil@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Jovial Evil deals 2 damage to target player for
    each white creature he or she controls." [Encyclopedia Page 151]
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/JOVIA}

@endnode
@node JUGGE "Juggernaut"

@{b}Juggernaut@{ub}

  See the @{"Must Attack" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MUST} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  Invisibility can make the Juggernaut unblockable.  The "can only be
    blocked by walls" of Invisibility does not override the text on the
    Juggernaut which says it cannot be blocked by walls. [bethmo]

  There is no penalty if for some reason the Juggernaut cannot attack, but
    if it can attack you must do so. [bethmo 08/05/94]

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a deck)
    for Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) tournaments until 10/01/97, and
    it is now unrestricted.

 @{" Card Information " link 3E_ARTIFACT.guide/JUGGE}

@endnode
@node JUJUB "Juju Bubble"

@{b}Juju Bubble@{ub}

         The text "play a card" means to play a land or to announce any kind of
    spell. [bethmo 02/25/97]  The spell does not have to be successfully
    cast.

  It does not matter if it is played from your hand or from something like
    Elkin Bottle. [D'Angelo 02/18/97]

  Does not care if you use an ability which puts something into play.
    [DeLaney 02/02/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_ARTIFACT.guide/JUJUB}

@endnode
@node JUMP_ "Jump"

@{b}Jump@{ub}

  Cannot be used after a blocker is assigned in order to avoid being
    blocked.  See the @{"Attack Phase Rules and Rulings" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/ATTACK} section of the 
    General Rulings for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLUE.guide/_JUMP}

@endnode
@node JUNGL "Jungle Patrol"

@{b}Jungle Patrol@{ub}

  Sacrificing wood tokens is an ability of this card and not of the tokens
    themselves.  You cannot sacrifice them if this card is no longer in play.
    [bethmo 12/03/96]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GREEN.guide/JUNPA}

@endnode
@node JUNOD "Juniper Order Druid"

@{b}Juniper Order Druid@{ub}

  As errata, the effect is played as an instant. [Mirage Page 4]
    [Encyclopedia Page 87]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_GREEN.guide/JUNIP}

@endnode
@node JUNEF "Junun Efreet"

@{b}Junun Efreet@{ub}

  The Arabian Nights version has errata to be buried (not destroyed) if the
    upkeep is not paid. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_BLACK.guide/JUNUN}

@endnode
@node JUSTI "Justice"

@{b}Justice@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "During your upkeep, pay (W)(W) or bury Justice.
    ..." [Encyclopedia Page 87]

  The damage done by Justice is done immediately after any red spell which
    does damage resolves or creature deals damage.  The damage is handled
    in the same damage prevention step as the damage from the original spell.
    [Aahz 07/25/95]

  Remember that Justice only works on red spell and creature sources.  It does
    not do anything for non-creature permanents, so using Chaoslace on Justice
    will not cause an infinite loop. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  If a single source does damage to multiple targets at once, Justice will
    add up all the damage done and deal damage to the source's controller in
    one packet (not multiple packets). [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/JUSTI}

@endnode
@node JUXTA "Juxtapose"

@{b}Juxtapose@{ub}

  The choices of what to exchange are made on resolution.  They are not
    made on announcement.  [bethmo 12/07/96]

  Must trade creatures and artifacts if possible, but can trade just one
    kind or neither kind if none are available to trade. [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Spell can choose creatures with Protection from Blue when making the
    choice of highest cost creatures. [Aahz 10/24/95]

  Does not target either creature. [Aahz 10/24/95]
