@node HAKIM "Hakim, Loreweaver"

@{b}Hakim, Loreweaver@{ub}

+ You can use his ability to put enchantments on him that would be invalid,
    but they are immediately buried. [Aahz 12/07/96]  Hakim's ability is
    different from other ways that bring enchantments into play because you
    do not 'play' them.  This is why you can put an invalid enchantment on
    him.

  You can use the ability multiple times in one spell stack and can get
    multiple enchantments on him this way.  You only check if he has no
    enchantments when announcing the ability. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 28]
    The Duelist page somewhat contradicts itself, and the above is correct.
    [D'Angelo 03/02/97]

@node HALFD "Halfdane"

@{b}Halfdane@{ub}

  Copies the current power/toughness of the creature into the text on his
    lower right hand corner.  You then add any effects upon Halfdane himself.
    [Aahz 01/04/96]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/HALFD}

@endnode
@node HALLO "Hall of Gemstone"

@{b}Hall of Gemstone@{ub}

  As errata, ignore the line break.  The entire text is one ability.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  Will affect lands that produce colorless mana. [Aahz 11/07/96]

  Will not affect lands that do not produce mana.

  Although the color may be altered, any restrictions on the use of the mana
    are not removed.  So Mishra's Workshop may produce colored mana which
    can only be used on artifacts. [Aahz 11/07/96]

@node HAMME "Hammerheim"

@{b}Hammerheim@{ub}

  Can be used on a creature without landwalking but has no effect.

@endnode
@node HANDJ "Hand of Justice"

@{b}Hand of Justice@{ub}

  The creatures are tapped during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The effect cannot be announced if the
    creatures are not in an untapped state. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]

  "Summoning sickness" does not prevent creatures from being tapped by this
    effect. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]  But you cannot use the Hand's ability
    at all if the Hand has summoning sickness.

 @{" Card Information " link FE_WHITE.guide/HANDO}

@endnode
@node HASRA "Hasran Ogress"

@{b}Hasran Ogress@{ub}

  The Arabian Nights version of this card has two versions, one with a small
    dark circle behind the "2" in the payment cost (rarity C3) and one with
    a normal mana circle behind the cost (rarity C2).
 
 @{" Card Information " link AN_BLACK.guide/HASRA}

@endnode
@node HAUAP "Haunting Apparition"

@{b}Haunting Apparition@{ub}

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [D'Angelo 10/15/96]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GOLD.guide/HAUNT}

@endnode
@node HAUNT "Haunting Wind"

@{b}Haunting Wind@{ub}

  It does damage whenever the target artifact's activation cost is paid, or
    when it becomes tapped for any other reason.  It does not do double
    damage if the activation cost requires tapping. [Aahz 06/06/94]

+ Note that there are no continuous artifacts any more.  So the text about
    not being triggered by continuous artifacts does not apply to anything.
    [Aahz 10/02/96]
 
 @{" Card Information " link AQ_BLACK.guide/HAUNT}

@node HAVEN "Havenwood Battleground"

@{b}Havenwood Battleground@{ub}

  See @{"Dwarven Ruins" link MTG_CARD_D.guide/DWRUI} for rulings.
 
 @{" Card Information " link FE_LAND.guide/HAVEN}

@endnode
@node HAZDU "Hazduhr the Abbot"

@{b}Hazduhr the Abbot@{ub}

  Targets damage on a single white creature.  It does not target the creature.
    It cannot take damage from multiple creatures at once. [D'Angelo 10/18/95]

 @{" Card Information " link HL_WHITE.guide/HAZDU}

@endnode
@node HAZEZ "Hazezon Tamar"

@{b}Hazezon Tamar@{ub}

  The Sand Warriors leave play if Hazezon is placed in an Oubliette or
    Tawnos's Coffin, and they do not come back on the turn after Hazezon
    re-enters play. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]  

  The Sand Warriors come into play on a player's side if that player controls
    Hazezon during the player's first upkeep after Hazezon enters play.
    It is possible for no player or all players to get Sand Warriors if
    control of Hazezon changes. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]

  The Sand Warriors do not change control after they enter play even if
    Hazezon changes control. [bethmo 07/14/94]

  See the @{"Token Creatures" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_TOKE} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/HAZEN}

@endnode
@node HEAL_ "Heal"

@{b}Heal@{ub}

  As errata, the Ice Age version of this card should have you draw a card
    at the beginning of the next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]  This makes it identical to the Fifth
    Edition version.

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/_HEAL}

@endnode
@node HEALS "Healing Salve"

@{b}Healing Salve@{ub}

  Does not target the creature or player when preventing damage.  It only 
    targets the damage on the creature or player.  Treat this as errata. 
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 36]  It does target the player when giving
    life.

  The Limited, Unlimited and Revised Edition versions allowed you to gain 3
    life or prevent 3 damage to a creature or player.  The Fourth Edition
    version also allows you to give 3 life to another player if you choose.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_WHITE.guide/HEALI}

@endnode
@node HEBOG "Heart of Bogardan"

@{b}Heart of Bogardan@{ub}

+ The consequences of not paying the cumulative upkeep happen at the same
    the card is buried as a result of not paying.  This is not a triggered
    ability. [WotC Rules Team 07/03/97]

 @{" Card Information " link WL_RED.guide/HEART}

@endnode
@node HEART "Heart of Yavimaya"

@{b}Heart of Yavimaya@{ub}

  You have the choice when it enters play to sacrifice the land or let this
    card be buried.  You may not use the mana source speed ability between the
    time when it enters play and before it gets buried because the sacrifice
    or burial is considered a phase cost. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
    (REVERSAL)  See @{"Comes Into Play Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CIPE} in the General Rulings for more
    information.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_LAND.guide/HEART}

@endnode
@node HECAT "Hecatomb"

@{b}Hecatomb@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "When Hecatomb comes into play, sacrifice four
    creatures or bury Hecatomb. ..." [Encyclopedia Page 84]

  The sacrifice is done as a triggered effect just after it enters play.  It
    is not done on announcement. [D'Angelo 10/27/95]

  If you have less than 4 creatures, you do not partially sacrifice.  You pay 
    4 creatures or none. [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  The swamp is tapped during announcement of the effect and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The ability cannot be announced if the
    target swamp is not untapped at the time. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/HECAT}

@endnode
@node HELLC "Hell's Caretaker"

@{b}Hell's Caretaker@{ub}

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  Pick a creature in the graveyard on announcement. This creature is targeted
    and the spell will fizzle if it is not there on resolution.
    [Aahz 07/05/95] (This is a REVERSAL)

  You can't sacrifice creatures you don't control. [Page 62]

  Can sacrifice itself. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  Cannot choose itself to be brought back. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/HELLC}

@endnode
@node HELMA "Helm of Awakening"

@{b}Helm of Awakening@{ub}

  The effect is cumulative. [Aahz 01/29/97]

  The lower cost is not optional like with many other cost reducers.
    [D'Angelo 01/27/97]

  The cost reduction does apply to costs in the card text, such as the extra
    targets for Fireball. [Aahz 01/29/97]

  The cost reduction does not apply to external penalty effects such as Gloom.
    [Aahz 01/29/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_ARTIFACT.guide/HELMO}

@endnode
@node HELMC "Helm of Chatzuk"

@{b}Helm of Chatzuk@{ub}

  This is a targeted effect so it must have a target in order to be used.
    [Aahz 07/29/94]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_ARTIFACT.guide/HELMO}

@endnode
@node HELOB "Helm of Obedience"

@{b}Helm of Obedience@{ub}

  It is buried as part of the effect. If it is not still in play at that time
    because you Boomerang it back to your hand, then that part of the effect
    fails. [bethmo 06/24/96]

  If when using the effect you pick a Clone or Doppelganger, and there are no
    legal targets for the creature, you simply don't get the creature but
    still bury the Helm. [bethmo 07/10/96]  The Clone or Doppelganger stays
    in the graveyard.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_ARTIFACT.guide/HELMO}

@endnode
@node HEMAT "Hematite Talisman"

@{b}Hematite Talisman@{ub}

  See the @{"Activation Cost" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ACTI} entry in the General Rulings for more information
    on what "once for each" means.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/HEMAT}

@endnode
@node HEROI "Heroism"

@{b}Heroism@{ub}

  The cost to avoid the penalty must be paid when the spell resolves.  You
    cannot wait until later to do so. [Aahz 11/30/94]

  Paying the Heroism cost to allow a creature to deal damage does not
    prevent other effects from preventing it from dealing damage.  Paying
    the cost only prevents the Heroism effect. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 7]

 @{" Card Information " link FE_WHITE.guide/HEROI}

@endnode
@node HIGHT "High Tide"

@{b}High Tide@{ub}

  Multilands which are part Island produce an extra blue mana in addition to
    whatever you tap it for. [Aahz 12/03/94]

  Non lands or lands which do not say they count as Islands do not produce
    extra mana. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 6]

@node HOMWA "Homarid Warrior"

@{b}Homarid Warrior@{ub}

  The ability to make itself not be targeted is a fast effect and can be used
    in response to being targeted.  Since effects resolve in last-to-first
    order, the Warrior becomes untargetable before the targeted effect happens
    and causes the targeted effect to fizzle.  Note that if you use this
    ability before being targeted, that a targeted effect used in the same
    batch will resolve first.  [Aahz 12/01/94]  Note that the ability can
    be activated more than once in a single spell stack if you need it to be.

  Does not cause enchantments on it to be removed when the effect is
    activated.  An enchantment in play is neither a spell or an effect.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 7]

  It taps when the effect resolves if it was not already tapped.  It may be
    used even if it is already tapped. [Aahz 12/02/94]

    [Encyclopedia Page 84]

  See the @{"Enchant Land" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ELND} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  The land is tapped during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  The effect cannot be announced if the
    land is not in an untapped state. [D'Angelo 12/23/96]

  It is buried if you lose control of the target. [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  Read the word "discarded" on the Antiquities and Revised Edition versions

@node HURRJ "Hurr Jackal"

@{b}Hurr Jackal@{ub}

  The Jackal's power is not usable during damage prevention.  You must use
    it prior to the damage prevention step.  [bethmo]

  Note that it must be used before fatal damage occurs and that it prevents
    regeneration for the rest of the turn.  You may not use it at the time
    when someone tries to regenerate it because this ability is an instant
    speed fast effect that is not allowed at the time regeneration is used.

 @{" Card Information " link AN_RED.guide/HURRJ}

@endnode
@node HYDRO "Hydroblast"

@{b}Hydroblast@{ub}

  As errata, play the effect as an instant when targeting a permanent and as
    an interrupt when targeting a spell. [Mirage Page 4]  The spell is still
    an "Interrupt" and not an "Instant" for effects that affect certain
    spell types. [Aahz 09/19/96]

+ See "Play as a..." in the General Rulings for more information.

  You can target any spell or permanent, it need not be red.  It just does
    not do anything unless the color matches. [D'Angelo 06/09/95]

  You can use Sleight of Mind after announcing this spell to change the
    color word and make it do something on resolution. [D'Angelo 06/09/95]

  The decision to counter a spell or destroy a permanent is a decision made
    on announcement before a target of the proper type is selected. If the
    spell is redirected, this mode cannot be changed, so only targets of
    the selected type are valid. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  You declare whether you are tapping or untapping the artifact when you
    tap this card.  If the card changes state before this effect happens,

@{b}Hypnotic Specter@{ub}

  Must do at least 1 point of damage to cause opponent to discard because
    the effect is a property of the damage. [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  If damage is redirected to opponent by some spell or ability and is not
    prevented, opponent must discard a card as if they were attacked
    directly. Equally, if damage is redirected away from the player, no
    card needs to be discarded.  [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  If a player discards due to the Specter and later that turn retroactively
    removes the damage (Simulacrum or other effect), the player does not
    get the card back.  [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  The artist's name, Shuler, was misspelled on the Limited/Unlimited Edition
