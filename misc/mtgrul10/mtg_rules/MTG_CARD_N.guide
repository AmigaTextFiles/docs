@endnode
@node NAFSA "Nafs Asp"

@{b}Nafs Asp@{ub}

  Can pay the 1 mana at any time after damage is done before the draw phase
    of that player's turn.  This means that you can pay up until the end of
    upkeep.  [Card Text]

  If it damages a player during their draw phase and they do not prevent it
    by paying 1, then this counts as activating the Asp's ability again and it
    will damage that player again during their next draw phase.
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 21]  This keeps happening until they pay, even
    if the Asp leaves play. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 26]

  As errata to the Arabian Nights version, it should be read as saying
    "any opponent" instead of "your opponent".
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

  The Arabian Nights version causes loss of 1 life while the Fourth Edition
    version does 1 damage.

  The Fourth Edition version will do extra damage to its controller if its 
    damage gets redirected there, while the Arabian Nights version could only 
    damage an opponent. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

@node NAKED "Naked Singularity"

@{b}Naked Singularity@{ub}

  If a player uses Magical Hack to make a land type be listed as producing
    two different colors, the player tapping the land for mana can choose to
    produce mana of either color. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]  But if it 
    produces more than one mana, all mana is of the same color.
    [D'Angelo 07/21/95]

@endnode
@node NAMEL "Nameless Race"

@{b}Nameless Race@{ub}

  The life payment is made during the resolution of the effect as the card
    enters play.  It is not paid during announcement because the card says to
    when "bringing" it into play, not when "playing it. [D'Angelo 03/17/97]
    (This is a minor REVERSAL of a ruling I had here before).
 
 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLACK.guide/NAMEL}

@endnode
@node NATBA "Natural Balance"

@{b}Natural Balance@{ub}

  As errata, you are not required to retrieve the lands.  You just get a
    maximum of whatever it takes to bring you up to five.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  The sacrifice is made on resolution, not on announcement.  Even the caster
    does not have to choose lands to sacrifice until their turn at the
    resolution comes around. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GREEN.guide/NATUR}

@endnode
@node NATOR "Natural Order"

@{b}Natural Order@{ub}

  The sacrifice of a green creature is part of the cost and is paid on
    announcement.  You do not have a choice to pay this cost zero times or
    more than one time in order to multiply the effect. [D'Angelo 01/28/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_GREEN.guide/NATUR}

@endnode
@node NATBL "Nature's Blessing"

@{b}Nature's Blessing@{ub}

  The abilities granted are permanent.  They are not just until the end of the
    turn. [Aahz 06/14/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_GOLD.guide/NATUR}

@endnode
@node NATCH "Nature's Chosen"

@{b}Nature's Chosen@{ub}

  Is buried if you lose control of the creature since the card text says it
    is played on a creature you control. [D'Angelo 06/17/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_GREEN.guide/NACHO}

@endnode
@node NATLO "Nature's Lore"

@{b}Nature's Lore@{ub}

  Basic forests and multilands that say "counts as a Forest" can be drawn.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8]

  Can get a Snow-Covered Forest out. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_GREEN.guide/NATUR}

@endnode
@node NATWR "Nature's Wrath"

@{b}Nature's Wrath@{ub}

  If something causes you to put a blue or black permanent into play, you
    are the one that gets affected, not your opponent. [Aahz 06/18/96]

  If two are in play, a player sacrifices two things for each one put into
    play. [Aahz 06/18/96]

  If a permanent is meets both sets of criteria, you sacrifice two things.
    For example, a card which is blue and black. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_GREEN.guide/NAWRA}

@endnode
@node NEBUC "Nebuchadnezzar"

@{b}Nebuchadnezzar@{ub}

  Your opponent only discards cards that you name and which are shown to you.
    They do not have to discard a card if it is in their hand but was not
    shown.  [Aahz 06/28/94]

  In multiplayer games you can choose a different opposing player each time it
    is used. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/NEBUC}

@endnode
@node NECRI "Necrite"

@{b}Necrite@{ub}

  See the @{"Is Not Blocked" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_INBL} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  The ability is targeted. [Aahz 12/02/94]

  The Fifth Edition version's ability has an activation cost and is played as
    an instant.  The Fallen Empires version was played as a triggered effect
    at the end of blocking declaration. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]

 @{" Card Information " link FE_BLACK.guide/NECRI}

@endnode
@node NECMA "Necromancy"

@{b}Necromancy@{ub}

+ See "Play as a..." in the General Rulings for more information.

  Enters play as a global enchantment and then becomes an Enchant Creature as
    a triggered effect upon entering play.  It follows all the rules for
    Enchant Creature cards from then on. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

  The bringing of the creature into play and then putting Necromancy on it is
    all done as one triggered ability. [bethmo 02/25/97]

  As a local enchantment, its only legal target is the one chosen when it
    entered play, thus there is no other legal target to move it to with
    Enchantment Alteration. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 25]

  Necromancy becomes a creature enchantment spell and so it does activate
    the Rabid Wombat and trigger other cards which use creature enchantments.
    [Aahz 06/06/97]

  Note that it is not ever an Enchant Dead Creature. [bethmo 02/18/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_BLACK.guide/NECMA}

@endnode
@node NECRO "Necropolis"

@{b}Necropolis@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Counts as a wall.  Remove a creature card in your
    graveyard from the game: Put X +0/+1 counters on Necropolis where X is
    that creature's casting cost." [Encyclopedia Page 172]

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  As with all counters, the +0/+1 counters are permanent. [Aahz 08/10/94]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_ARTIFACT.guide/NECRO}

@endnode
@node NECPO "Necropotence"

@{b}Necropotence@{ub}

  See @{"Phase Skipping" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHAS} in the General Rulings for more information.

  As errata, ignore the word "next" on the card.  If an effect such as Library
    of Leng causes you to skip your discard phase, you simply put the cards
    in your hand when you finally do get a discard phase. 
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  Triggers on a discard and after the card goes wherever it is going, 
    Necropotence removes it from game.  So you can use a Library of Leng 
    ability during a discard but the card still leaves the game.
    [Aahz 04/23/96]

  Cards are placed face-down under Necropotence.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]  The point of this ruling is that you do
    not get to look at the cards until they are drawn.  The cards are not 
    actually associated with the Necropotence permanent. [Aahz 02/10/96]

  Removing Necropotence from play will not cause the cards under it to be
    buried.  They are considered as being held by the original effect and
    are just put under the Necropotence for convenience. [Aahz 01/15/96]
    You get the cards during your next discard phase.

  Only has the effect of making you skip your draw phase if it is in play
    when your draw phase would normally start. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]

  The acquired cards are not considered draws.  They will not cause damage
    with Underworld Dreams or have Enduring Renewal detect creatures.
    [D'Angelo 12/08/95]

  Can be used with Fasting.  The reason is that Necropotence does not force
    you to skip your draw phase unless it is in play at the end of your
    upkeep phase.  Fasting allows you to mark the draw phase as "skipped"
    during upkeep prior to Necropotence kicking in.  [Aahz 01/16/96]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/NECRO}

@endnode
@node NEKRA "Nekrataal"

@{b}Nekrataal@{ub}

  Nothing happens if there are no non-artifact, non-black creatures in play
    when it comes into play. [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]

+ The ability of targeting the creature is done as a triggered effect and
    not as an instant or interrupt, so it can be used to target creatures
    which cannot be targeted by instants or interrupts (such as one with
    Anti-Magic Aura) on it. [Aahz 06/23/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_BLACK.guide/NEKRA}

@endnode
@node NETSH "Nether Shadow"

@{b}Nether Shadow@{ub}

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  Note that bringing the Shadow back into play from the graveyard is not a
    spell and it is not a summoning, it is a special ability.  It cannot be
    counterspelled. [bethmo 05/14/94]

  The Limited, Unlimited, and Revised Edition versions could re-enter play at
    any time during upkeep and to even come back more than once.  This made it
    possible for 4 Shadows and Ashnod's Altar to generate an infinite loop.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

  The Fourth Edition version enters play at the end of upkeep.  You can get
    an infinite loop with a mana source speed effect like Ashnod's Altar,
    but in this case it'll be hard to spend the mana. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

  The Limited and Unlimited Edition versions of this card required the payment
    of its casting cost in order to return it to play.  The Revised and
    Fourth Edition versions return to play for free. [Aahz 07/29/94]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/NETHE}

@endnode
@node NETVO "Nether Void"

@{b}Nether Void@{ub}

  This spell's countering effect triggers immediately upon the spell being
    announced and prior to other interrupts being allowed.  Once the payment
    is made, interrupts can happen as normal. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 60]

  The countering effect does not take place until after Nether Void resolves
    and is in play.  It does not affect its own casting or any casting in
    the same spell stack. [D'Angelo 12/09/95]

  Cannot counter mana sources since they resolve completely before this effect
    can trigger. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/NETHE}

@endnode
@node NETTL "Nettling Imp"

@{b}Nettling Imp@{ub}

  See the @{"Attack or Die Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ADIE} entry in the General Rulings for more
    information.

  As errata, it should read " (Tap): Force a target non-Wall creature
    controlled by an opponent whose turn it is to attack.  If target creature
    cannot attack, it is destroyed at end of turn.  This ability can only be
    used during opponent's turn, before the attack.  Cannot target creatures
    brought under their controller's control this turn."
    [Encyclopedia Page 208]  The Encylcopedia erroneously removed the word
    "non-Wall" from the text, so it has been added back. [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

  It only affects creatures without summoning sickness.  Thus, creatures that
    phase in this turn can be affected. [Aahz 02/16/97]

  The effect only requires the creature to attack this turn.  It is not a
    permanent effect. [Duelist Magazine #13, Page 27]

  If the Imp leaves play before the end of the turn, the creature still
    dies. [D'Angelo 04/12/95]

  Cannot nettle a creature with Protection from Black. [bethmo]

  Cannot nettle any Wall, even an Animated one. [bethmo]

  The "should be played" text can be misinterpreted.  If you choose to
    nettle a creature, it must be done before the player's attack phase.
    [Aahz 06/06/94]  It cannot be done after the end of the main phase.

 @{" Card Information " link 3E_BLACK.guide/NETTL}

@endnode
@node NEVIN "Nevinyrral's Disk"

@{b}Nevinyrral's Disk@{ub}

  Creatures can be regenerated although the enchantments on them will still
    be destroyed by the Disk. [PPG Page 222]  Note that regeneration abilities
    are used instead of cards going to the graveyard, so a Regeneration
    enchantment can be used even though it will be destroyed.  

  The destruction of the disk is not a sacrifice or a burial.  It is destroyed
    as part of the resolution if it is still in play.  And it can regenerate
    from this if it was animated.  [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  Guardian Beast can prevent it from destroying itself. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  Like all fast effect, once activated the effect occurs even if it is removed
    from play. [Peterson 11/01/94]

  The Limited and Unlimited Editions were "Mono Artifacts" so had tap as 
    part of the use cost.  Also, this version destroyed itself, which has
    been errata'd to be a burial.  The Revised Edition version was missing 
    the tap symbol, but as errata it should be considered to be there.  
    [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]  The Fourth Edition version is correct.

@node NIGMA "Nightmare"

@{b}Nightmare@{ub}

  If you run out of Swamps, the Nightmare dies right then as a continuous
    effect.  You cannot even use Magical Hack or something to save it.
    [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  The Beta printing version of this card has a blotch over the word Swamp
    that is not in any of the other printings.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/NIGHT}

@{b}Night Soil@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(1), Remove two creature cards in any graveyard
    from the game: Put a Saproling..." [Encyclopedia Page 187]  Changed "the
    graveyard" to "any graveyard". [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  The two creatures must come from the same graveyard.
    [Duelist Magazine #4,Page 6]

  The creatures are removed from the game during announcement and as a cost.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]  

  Token creatures that are destroyed go to the graveyard briefly, but are
    removed from the game before you can take any actions.  You cannot
    use such creatures for Night Soil. [Aahz 11/30/94]

@{b}Northern Paladin@{ub}

  The Limited, Unlimited, and Revised Edition versions only can target 
    black cards while the Fourth Edition on can target any black permanent 
    (including tokens). [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

  The Limited, Unlimited, and Revised Edition versions should have the word
    "cancel" read as saying "counter". [Aahz 07/29/94]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_WHITE.guide/NORTH}

@node NORTH "North Star"

@{b}North Star@{ub}

  As errata, play the effect as an instant. [Mirage Page 4]

  You have until the end of the turn to choose up to one spell to cast
    without colored mana requirements.  You are not required to use this on
    specific spells. [D'Angelo 06/11/97]

  Cannot be used to power Drain Life with any color mana because the draining
    portion of drain life is not part of the casting cost. [Aahz 06/27/94]

  Converts the spell to having an entirely "colorless" (generic) casting cost.
    This means that effects like Planar Gate and Mana Matrix might end up 
    paying for all the spell's casting cost. [Aahz 09/02/94]

@{b}Nova Pentacle@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(3),(Tap): Redirect all damage dealt to you from
    one source to target creature of target opponent's choice."
    [Encyclopedia Page 154]

  Cannot be used if no creatures are in play. [Aahz 06/17/94]

  If you have no creatures, your opponent must still choose a creature even
    if it ends up being one of their own. [Aahz 06/17/94]

  If the targeted creature has an Artifact Ward, the Pentacle's effect
    fizzles and the damage is not redirected. [Aahz 09/02/94]

  Your opponent is counted as the one choosing the target for things like
    Autumn Willow that care who is targeting rather than what is targeting
    it. [Aahz 10/24/95]

  In multiplayer games you can choose a different opposing player each time it
    is used. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]
