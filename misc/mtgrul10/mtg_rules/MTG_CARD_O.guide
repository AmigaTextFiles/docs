@node OASIS "Oasis"

@{b}Oasis@{ub}

  The Fourth Edition version has an activation cost, while the Arabian Nights
    version just had an ability. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_LAND.guide/OASIS}

@endnode
@node OATHO "Oath of Lim-Dul"

@{b}Oath of Lim-Dul@{ub}

  You can sacrifice one Oath of Lim-Dul to another one.  You cannot sacrifice
    it to itself. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 27]

  Cards are destroyed or discarded during the side-effects part of damage
    prevention (which is the same time Hypnotic Spectre would make you
    discard).  [D'Angelo 12/04/95]

  Payments of life count as lost life for this and all other such effects.
    [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 43]

  Does not trigger twice on damage to a player causing loss of life.
    [DeLaney 02/02/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLACK.guide/OATHO}

@endnode
@node OBELI "Obelisk of Undoing"

@{b}Obelisk of Undoing@{ub}

  As errata to the Antiquities version of the card, the word "discarded"
    should be "destroyed". [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 138]

  You must be the owner and the controller of the permanent. [Card Text]

  Only affects one permanent.  All cards which say "any xxx" (where xxx is
    "creature", "land" or something) mean any single xxx in play.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/OBELI}

@endnode
@node OGREE "Ogre Enforcer"

@{b}Ogre Enforcer@{ub}

  It needs to be damaged fatally by a single spell or permanent in order to
    die from damage. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 28]

  If its toughness falls to zero or less and it is undamaged, it will stay in
    play until at least 1 damage is successfully dealt to it or unless it 
    already has at least 1 damage on it. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  Note that
    dealing zero damage to it is the same as not damaging it since there is 
    no such thing as a packet of zero damage.

  Trample damage done to an Ogre Enforcer works just like it does for any 
    other creature even if you do not want it to happen that way.  For 
    example, if the Ogre blocks a Crash of Rhinos (8/4 trample) banded with
    a Teremko Griffin (2/2, banding, flying), then the Ogre will take 2 normal
    and 8 trample damage.  By the rules, the 6 trample damage over the
    Ogre's toughness is redirected to the player _before_ checking if the
    Ogre has lethal damage.  The Ogre will be left with 2 damage from the 
    Griffin and 2 from the Rhinos, so it will not die.
    [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 47]

  The Ogre with damage (even if not from one source) greater than or equal to
    its toughness is considered to have "lethal damage" for any effects that 
    trigger on such damage.  Thus, a Disintegrate on an Ogre with lethal
    damage will remove it from the game even if all the damage is not from
    one source. [Duelist Magazine #17, Page 47]

  It is in no way protected from being destroyed or buried due to non-damage
    effects. [D'Angelo 03/26/97]  Note that lowering of toughness is not a
    destroying effect, it simply causes the damage on the creature to be
    rechecked for possible lethal damage.

@endnode
@node OLDMA "Old Man of the Sea"

@{b}Old Man of the Sea@{ub}

  Can be used, at any time fast effects are allowed, to take control of a
    creature.  This includes your opponent's turn.  If used during an attack 
    phase, the creature is removed from the attack immediately. [bethmo]

  Control of the creature is lost if the Old Man leaves play for any
    reason. [bethmo 05/09/94]

  You do not lose control of a creature controlled by the Old Man even if you
    lose control of the Old Man itself.  Interesting Note: if player A
    taps an Old Man to control B's Old Man, and during the same instant B
    taps to control A's Old Man, then at the resolution of the instant, the
    two Old Men switch sides.  Now whoever untaps first will be getting
    both Old Men.  [bethmo]

  You do not lose control if the creature becomes an invalid target at any
    time after the Old Man steals it.  This includes if the card stops being
    a creature.  The check for stealing the creature is made on declaration
    and on resolution as with any targeted effect plus it checks constantly
    for the cases listed on the card: power becoming greater than Old Man's
    and Old Man leaving play.  [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  Can choose not to untap even if it is not still controlling a creature.
    [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]

@endnode
@node ONULE "Onulet"

@{b}Onulet@{ub}

  As errata to the Antiquities and Revised Edition versions of this card,
    is should read "If Onulet goes to the graveyard from play..."
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 138]  This means that it does not do anything
    if discarded or countered.

  The incorrect artist is listed on the card.  It should be Anson Maddocks.

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/ONULE}

@endnode
@node ONYXT "Onyx Talisman"

@{b}Onyx Talisman@{ub}

  See @{"Hematite Talisman" link MTG_CARD_O.guide/HEMAT} for rulings.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/ONYXT}

@endnode
@node ORCAR "Orcish Artillery"

@{b}Orcish Artillery@{ub}

  COP:Red can be used to avoid damage from the artillery.  Makes it a nice
    2 point directed attack.

  You do not take the 3 points of damage if the effect fizzles. 
    [Aahz 06/06/94]

  The Alpha printing version of this card had a casting cost of "1R".  All
    further printings have had a "1RR" casting cost.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_RED.guide/ORCAR}

@endnode
@node ORCCA "Orcish Captain"

@{b}Orcish Captain@{ub}

  Flip a coin for each time the cost is paid. [WotC Rules Team 11/16/94]
    You cannot pay the cost more than once in a single activation.

  In multiplayer games you can choose a different opposing player each time
    it is used. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]
 
 @{" Card Information " link FE_RED.guide/ORCCA}

@endnode
@node ORCLI "Orcish Librarian"

@{b}Orcish Librarian@{ub}

  You do get to look at the remaining 4 cards before deciding which order
    to put them back in. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_RED.guide/ORCLI}

@endnode
@node ORCLU "Orcish Lumberjack"

@{b}Orcish Lumberjack@{ub}

Orcish Lumberjack

  As errata, play the effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_RED.guide/ORCLU}

@endnode
@node ORCME "Orcish Mechanics"

@{b}Orcish Mechanics@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(Tap), Sacrifice an artifact: Orcish Mechanics
    deal 2 damage to target creature or player." [Encyclopedia Page 133]
    The Encyclopedia errata entry broke the cost/effect relationship and it
    has been corrected here. [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

  Cannot use the ability unless you have an artifact to sacrifice.  It is
    part of the cost. [Aahz]

  The "place in the graveyard" statement is actually a "sacrifice" and is a
    cost which cannot be prevented. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 14]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_RED.guide/ORCIS}

@endnode
@node ORCOR "Orcish Oriflamme"

@{b}Orcish Oriflamme@{ub}

  Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Type I tournaments from 01/25/94 to 02/23/94.  It was determined to
    not be that great an advantage at that time.

  The casting cost on the Alpha printing version of this card was just
    "1R", and not "3R" as appears in all other printings.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_RED.guide/ORCOR}

@endnode
@node ORCSQ "Orcish Squatters"

@{b}Orcish Squatters@{ub}

  The Fifth Edition version's ability has an activation cost and is played as
    an instant.  The Ice Age version was played as a triggered effect
    at the end of blocking declaration. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_RED.guide/ORCSQ}

@endnode
@node ORDSA "Order of the Sacred Torch"

@{b}Order of the Sacred Torch@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(Tap): Pay 1 life to counters target black spell.
    Effects..." [Encyclopedia Page 93]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_WHITE.guide/OOTST}

@endnode
@node ORGG_ "Orgg"

@{b}Orgg@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Trample.  Orgg cannot attack if defending player
    controls an ..." [Encyclopedia Page 189]

  Cannot attack if opponent has any untapped creatures of power greater than 
    2.  [Card Text]  It does not matter if those creatures cannot block.
    [D'Angelo 02/09/95]
 
 @{" Card Information " link FE_RED.guide/ORGG_}

@endnode
@node ORNIT "Ornithopter"

@{b}Ornithopter@{ub}

  The zero casting cost is not a misprint.

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/ORNIT}

@endnode
@node OSAIV "Osai Vultures"

@{b}Osai Vultures@{ub}

  Only gets one counter per turn, not one per creature. [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Does get a counter if creatures died on the turn even if it enters play 
    after they died. [Aahz 12/21/94]

  The Fourth Edition version has an activation cost while the Legends version
    just had an ability. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_WHITE.guide/OSAIV}

@endnode
@node OUBLI "Oubliette"

@{b}Oubliette@{ub}

  The card in the Oubliette acts as if it were phased out, with the exception
    that it will not come back into play at the beginning of untap like other
    phased out cards will.  The rulings as to what happens when the creature
    leaves or re-enters play, apply, however. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]  See the 
    rulings on @{"Phasing" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHNG} in the General Rulings for more information.

  Oubliette differs from normal phasing in, in that the creature enters play
    with summoning sickness. [Aahz 11/07/96]  If a creature enters the 
    Oubliette, then exits it during the same turn, it is still subject to 
    summoning sickness. [WotC Rules Team 04/12/95]

  If a creature enters the Oubliette after an effect targets it, then exits 
    before that effect resolves, then the creature is still "locked onto" by
    the targeted effect.  [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]

  The creature returns to play tapped.  It does not return to play and then
    tap afterwards. [Aahz 03/17/97]  (REVERSAL)

  The creature in the Oubliette may not be selected (and returned to play) by
    the Ring of Ma'ruf artifact since the card are "out of play" and not "out 
    of the game". [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]

  If City in a Bottle is used, the Oubliette does not protect the creature
    inside (if it is an Arabian Nights card) from being affected.  The
    Oubliette is removed from play and then the creature is freed and
    removed from play immediately.  Continuous effect artifacts are
    considered to be faster than interrupts.  
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]

  If Oubliette is used on token creatures, they are permanently lost.
    [bethmo]  The Oubliette stays in play. [Aahz]  See the @{"Token Creatures" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_TOKE}
    entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  If a creature stops being a creature after it enters the Oubliette, it
    still remains inside.  Examples include a Living Land or an Assembly
    Worker. [Aahz]

  Oubliette targets the creature it is taking out of play, hence Protection
    from Black will prevent this spell from even targeting the creature.  
    [WotC Rules Team 02/07/94]

  This is not a creature enchantment, so it cannot be moved with effects like
    Enchantment Alteration.
 
  If this card phases out, the link to the card it is holding out of play is
    broken, and that card re-enters play.  When this card phases back in, it
    will remain in play without any target. [Aahz 02/16/97]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_BLACK.guide/OUBLI}

@endnode
@node OVINO "Ovinomancer"

@{b}Ovinomancer@{ub}

  Can target itself.  This will cause it to be returned to your hand during
    announcement and will result in no sheep since it will not be in play at
    resolution so the effect fizzles. [bethmo 11/27/96]
