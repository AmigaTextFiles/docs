@node YAWGM "Yawgmoth Demon"

@{b}Yawgmoth Demon@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Flying, first strike.  Sacrifice an artifact
    during upkeep or tap Yawgmoth Demon and Yawgmoth Demon deals 2 damage to
    you." [Encyclopedia Page 69]

  The sacrificing of an artifact is not mandatory.  You can choose not to
    sacrifice an artifact but will pay the consequences.  [Aahz 11/02/94]

@node YDWEN "Ydwen Efreet"

@{b}Ydwen Efreet@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If you attempt to assign Ydwen Efreet to block a
    creature, choose an opponent and flip a coin first; that opponent calls
    heads or tails..." [Encyclopedia Page 128]

  Any effects that trigger when it blocks (such as Venom) will not trigger if
    the block fails to happen.  If there was a cost to declare it as a blocker
    and the declaration fails, you do not get the cost back.  If there was a
    limitation imposed when you declared it as a blocker (as with Caverns of 
    Despair) you do not get to go back and redo things after the block fails.
