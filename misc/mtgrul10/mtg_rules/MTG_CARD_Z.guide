@node ZHALF "Zhalfirin Crusader"

@{b}Zhalfirin Crusader@{ub}

  The damage being redirected is damage done to this card, not damage done by
    this card. [DeLaney 01/28/97]

@node ZOMBI "Zombie Master"

@{b}Zombie Master@{ub}

  Does not grant the abilities to itself. [PPG Page 225]

  The abilities begin once the Master is in play and immediately cease if
    it leaves play.

  Grants abilities to all Zombies owned by all players. [Snark]

  If dying at the same time as some Zombies, the regeneration ability can
    still be used.  Just handle the Zombie deaths before the Zombie Master.
    [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  The regeneration ability is actually added to the card text of all Zombies.
    The SwampWalk ability is just granted to them. [Aahz 03/18/97]

@node ZUREN "Zuran Enchanter"

@{b}Zuran Enchanter@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "effect" instead of "ability" in the middle
    sentence. [Encyclopedia Page 103]

@node ZURAN "Zuran Orb"

@{b}Zuran Orb@{ub}

  + Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck) for
    Classic (Type I) tournaments from 11/01/95 to 10/01/97.  Was on the
    Standard (Type II) restricted list from 11/01/95 until 01/01/97 when it
    became banned because Ice Age was no longer Standard (Type II) legal.
    It has been on the Standard (Type II) banned list since 07/01/97 when Ice
    Age became legal again.  Has always been banned from
    Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) and Extended tournaments.

  Has been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a deck)
    for Ice Age and Ice Age/Alliances tournaments since 05/01/97.  Was on the
    restricted list from 11/01/95 until 05/01/97.

@node ZURSW "Zur's Weirding"

@{b}Zur's Weirding@{ub}

  This is a triggered ability that goes off when a draw effect completely
    resolves.  If a spell/ability causes more than one card to be drawn, wait
    for the effect to resolve completely.  If that player has any of those
    cards still in their hand (which they might not if the effect was a
    Sylvan Library for example) when the effect finishes resolving, then you
    can pay to make them discard.  [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]

  You can pay the 2 life on a card that was drawn and then put back into the
    library or somewhere else, but the Weirding effect will fizzle since it 
    won't find the card in the player's hand. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 27]

  This does not make it as if the player never drew, it is really a discard.
    [D'Angelo 07/12/95]

  The controller of Zur's effect is the player who plays the effect, who may
    not be the same as the controller of this card. [WotC Rules Team 06/01/97]
