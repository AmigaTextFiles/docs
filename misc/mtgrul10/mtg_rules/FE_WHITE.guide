Text(FE): <1W>: Target Soldier gets +1/+0 until end of turn.

Flavor Text: @{i}Even after the wall was breached in half a dozen places,

              ---Proclamation granting knighthood@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}"Scouting is the art of balancing the need to
              go undiscovered with the need to get all the
