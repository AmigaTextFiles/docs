@node UNCLE "Uncle Istvan"

@{b}Uncle Istvan@{ub}

  Works even on damage from special abilities of creatures such as the 
    Prodigal Sorcerer ability. [Aahz 08/09/94]
 
 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLACK.guide/UNCLE}

@endnode
@node UNDSE "Underground Sea"

@{b}Underground Sea@{ub}

  See @{"Badlands" link MTG_CARD_B.guide/BADLA} for rulings.

 @{" Card Information " link 3E_LAND.guide/UNDER}

@endnode
@node UNDDR "Underworld Dreams"

@{b}Underworld Dreams@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "For each card target opponent draws, Underworld
    Dreams deals 1 damage to him or her." [Encyclopedia Page 162]

  Only affects the drawing of cards.  It does not affect spells like Demonic
    Tutor, Millstone, or Petra Sphinx which affect the library but do not
    say "draw" a card. [bethmo 06/22/94]

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

  Affects all draws even if you have to put the cards back afterwards.  This
    ruling applies to things like Sylvan Library and Brainstorm.
    [D'Angelo 07/11/95]

+ It triggers only once (and causes only one damage prevention step) when
    multiple cards are drawn due to a single spell/ability's effect.  The
    single triggering will do X damage if X cards are drawn.
    [D'Angelo 10/13/97] (REVERSAL due to 06/16/97 change)

  Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Classic (Type I) tournaments since 08/01/94.  Has always been banned
    from Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) tournaments.

@node UNDO_ "Undo"

@{b}Undo@{ub}

  The two creatures may have different owners and return to their respective
    owner's hands. [DeLaney 02/12/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_BLUE.guide/UNDO_}

@endnode
@node UNHCI "Unholy Citadel"

@{b}Unholy Citadel@{ub}

  See @{"Adventurers' Guildhouse" link MTG_CARD_A.guide/ADVEN} for rulings.
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_LAND.guide/UNHOL}

@endnode
@node UNHST "Unholy Strength"

@{b}Unholy Strength@{ub}

  The Fourth Edition version of this card has a different version of the card
    art.  All previous versions had a red pentagram in the background.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/UNHOL}

@endnode
@node UNLIK "Unlikely Alliance"

@{b}Unlikely Alliance@{ub}

  The bonus is not lost if the creature later becomes an attacker or blocker.
    The limitation is just there to prevent the effect from being used late
    in an attack. [bethmo 06/20/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AI_WHITE.guide/UNLIK}

@endnode
@node UNSTA "Unstable Mutation"

@{b}Unstable Mutation@{ub}

  The -1/-1 counters stay even if the enchantment is removed, and the +3/+3
    goes away when the enchantment does.  [Card Text]

  Its effect is not an upkeep cost, it's just an upkeep effect.
    [Aahz 02/12/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_BLUE.guide/UNSTA}

@endnode
@node UNSUM "Unsummon"

@{b}Unsummon@{ub}

  This can be used all the way up to the damage dealing phase of an attack,
    but cannot be used after that if the creature was killed. [Snark]

  Unsummoning a creature with Animate Dead on it puts the creature into the 
    owner's hand and the Animate Dead in its owner's graveyard. [Snark]

  If this causes an opponent to go over 7 cards when it is not their turn
    they need not discard until the discard phase of their next turn.

  An Unsummoned creature forgets its entire previous life.

  Unsummoning a token creature removes it from the game. [bethmo]

  As errata to the Limited, Unlimited and Revised Edition versions of this
    card, the word "discarded" should be read as "destroyed". 
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 135]

  The text was changed between the Alpha and Beta printings of the Limited
    Edition.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLUE.guide/UNSUM}

@endnode
@node UNTAM "Untamed Wilds"

@{b}Untamed Wilds@{ub}

  Can get a Snow-Covered land out. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 132]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GREEN.guide/UNTAM}

@endnode
@node UPDRA "Updraft"

@{b}Updraft@{ub}

  As errata, the Ice Age version of this card should have you draw a card
    at the beginning of the next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]  This makes it identical to the Fifth
    Edition version.

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLUE.guide/UPDRA}

@endnode
@node URBOR "Urborg"

@{b}Urborg@{ub}

  Can be used on a creature without First Strike or Swampwalk but has no 
    effect. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_LAND.guide/URBOR}

@endnode
@node URBJU "Urborg Justice"

@{b}Urborg Justice@{ub}

  Does not target the creatures. [DeLaney 06/12/97]

  The creatures are chosen on resolution, not on announcement.
    [bethmo 06/12/97]

 @{" Card Information " link WL_BLACK.guide/URBJU}

@endnode
@node URDRA "Ur-Drago"

@{b}Ur-Drago@{ub}

  Allows any creature controlled by any player to block SwampWalking creatures
    as if they did not have this ability.  It is not limited to just Ur-Drago.
    [Aahz 06/17/94]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/URDRA}

@endnode
@node URZAV "Urza's Avenger"

@{b}Urza's Avenger@{ub}

  The -1/-1 is not permanent.  It lasts until the end of the turn as do the
    abilities that give the -1/-1. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/URAVE}

@endnode
@node URZBA "Urza's Bauble"

@{b}Urza's Bauble@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "effect" instead of "ability".
    [Encyclopedia Page 101]

  As errata, the Ice Age version of this card should have you draw a card
    at the beginning of the next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]  This makes it identical to the Fifth
    Edition version.

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  You draw a card on the turn after you use the effect. [Aahz 06/08/95]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/URZAS}

@endnode
@node URZCH "Urza's Chalice"

@{b}Urza's Chalice@{ub}

  As errata, the card is of type "Artifact" and not "Poly Artifact".
    [Encyclopedia Page 136]

  May not be used on its own casting.  It must be in play at the time the
    artifact becomes successfully cast. [Aahz 07/27/94]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/URCHA}

@endnode
@node URZMN "Urza's Mine"

@{b}Urza's Mine@{ub}

  If you have at least one of each of the three Urza's lands in play, you
    must take the 2 mana instead of just one. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 15]

  The amount of mana to be gained is set on announcement and is not changed
    if you lose or gain lands before resolution.
    [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 50]  See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the General
    Rulings for more information.

  The Chronicles version has an activation cost and the Antiquities version
    does not. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 101]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_LAND.guide/UMINE}

@endnode
@node URZMI "Urza's Miter"

@{b}Urza's Miter@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...destruction.  May not be used when an artifact
    was played in the graveyard to gain benefits from a card."
    [Encyclopedia Page 136]

  Only works when artifact goes to the graveyard from play, not from a
    player's hand.  At that time, the card is not an Artifact.  [bethmo]
    You must be the controller of the artifact to use this.

  Can be used on itself because it can trigger on its own trip to the
    graveyard just like an animated Soul Net can. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/URMIT}

@endnode
@node URZPP "Urza's Power Plant"

@{b}Urza's Power Plant@{ub}

  See @{"Urza's Mine" link URZMN} for rulings.

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_LAND.guide/UPOWE}

@endnode
@node URZTO "Urza's Tower"

@{b}Urza's Tower@{ub}

  See @{"Urza's Mine" link URZMN} for rulings, except it generates 3 mana instead of 2.
