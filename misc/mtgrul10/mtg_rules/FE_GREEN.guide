Text(FE): <1G>: Target blocking creature gets +0/+1 until end of turn.

Flavor Text: @{i}"Thallids are not ordinary enemies of flesh and bone and

              of their own losses. I fear our Fortresses shall be
              overwhelmed."
              ---Kyliki of Havenwood@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}Many Elven Fortresses weren't built by masons and
             carpenters, but created from the living forest itself.@{ui}

Flavor Text: @{i}"The size of the obvious Fortress walls often misled
              foes. Actually, the Elves enchanted the forest itself
              to provide the first line of defense with tangling
              vines and stinging thorns."
