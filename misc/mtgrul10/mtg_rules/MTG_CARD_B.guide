@node BACKD "Backdraft"

@{b}Backdraft@{ub}

  This is not used during damage prevention.  It is used later in the turn
    to affect a spell which happened earlier that turn. [Aahz 11/08/96]

  Can be used even if the spell does no damage. [bethmo 07/01/94]

  Can be used on a spell that fizzled or on one that has not resolved, and
    thereby do zero damage. [bethmo 11/27/96]

@node BADLA "Badlands"

@{b}Badlands@{ub}

  The Revised Edition multilands differ from the Limited and Unlimited
    Edition ones in that they say that if "one land type is altered, the
    other is unaffected".  This applies only to spells like Conversion
    which alter a land type.  It does not mean that Phantasmal Terrain or
    any other spell which changes a land card to a different type only
    changes half of a multiland. [PPG Page 223]

 @{" Card Information " link 3E_LAND.guide/BADLA}

@endnode
@node BALAN "Balance"

@{b}Balance@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Each player sacrifices enough lands to equalize
    the number of lands all players control.  The player who controls the
    fewest lands cannot sacrifice any in this way.  All players then discard
    cards in hand and sacrifice creatures in play to equalize them in the
    same way." [Encyclopedia Page 20]

  The way this works, is that you look at the table and find the smallest
    number of lands and balance those first.  Then you balance to the smallest
    number of cards in hand.  Finally, you balance number of creatures.
    [Card Text]

  All cards sacrificed at one time go to the graveyard simulatenously.  All
    cards discarded go to the graveyard simultaneously.  As always, you pick
    the order they end up in the graveyard.

  Creatures with Protection from White are not ignored by Balance.  This
    is not considered a targeted ability so they are both counted and valid
    choices for being sacrificed.  [Aahz 12/02/94]

  Consecrate Land and Pyramids do not protect a land from being sacrificed,
    and Balance is considered to be a sacrificing effect. [Aahz 01/07/95]

  Animated lands are considered both as lands and as creatures.  Just
    remove whatever you have to in order to achieve "balance".  And yes,
    this does mean that they get double-counted :-(  This double counting
    may result in you having less land (since creatures are balanced last).

  Applies to all players in multiplayer games. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only one allowed in
    a deck) for Classic (Type I) tournaments since 04/19/95.  Was on the
    Standard (Type II) banned list from 01/01/97 to 04/2/97 when it became
    banned because it was no longer in the base set.  It was previously on the
    Standard (Type II) restricted list from 04/19/95 to 01/01/97.  Has been
    banned from Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) tournaments since 04/19/96.  Has
    always been banned from Extended tournaments.

@node BALHO "Balduvian Horde"

@{b}Balduvian Horde@{ub}

  The discard is not considered forced.  It is considered a phase cost to
    be paid during the phase it enters play.  You may not use Library of Leng
    on the discarded card. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 25] (REVERSAL)

  You discard a card no matter how you bring him into play.
    See the @{"Comes Into Play Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CIPE} entry in the General Rulings
    for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_RED.guide/BAHOR}

@node BALDU "Balduvian Trading Post"

@{b}Balduvian Trading Post@{ub}

  Mana Flare will let you make an extra Red or Colorless mana of your choice.
    [Aahz 05/21/96]

  You have the choice when it enters play to sacrifice the land or let this
    card be buried.  You may not use the mana source speed ability between the
    time when it enters play and before it gets buried because the sacrifice
    or burial is considered a phase cost. [WotC Rules Team 12/03/96]
    (REVERSAL)  See @{"Comes Into Play Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CIPE} in the General Rulings for more
    information.

@node BALLL "Ball Lightning"

@{b}Ball Lightning@{ub}

  As errata to the The Dark card, it should read "Bury Ball Lightning at end 
    of any turn." [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 138]  The creature is buried at
    the end of any turn in which it is in play.

 @{" Card Information " link DK_RED.guide/BALLL}

@node BARBA "Barbarian Guides"

@{b}Barbarian Guides@{ub}

  Can give Snow-Covered landwalk for basic or non-basic types, but it must
    be for a specific type.  Examples include, MountainWalk, Maze of Ith-Walk,
    and Tolaria-Walk.  Entire classes of landwalk are not supported.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 99]  Legendary Landwalk, Black Landwalk, and
    so on are not usable.

@endnode
@node BARBE "Barbed Sextant"

@{b}Barbed Sextant@{ub}

  As errata, play the effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

  As errata, the Ice Age version of this card should have you draw a card
    at the beginning of the next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]   This makes it identical to the Fifth
    Edition version.

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  You draw a card on the turn after you use the ability. [Aahz 06/08/95]

 @{" Card Information " link WL_GREEN.guide/BARIS}

@endnode
@node BARRE "Barreling Attack"

@{b}Barreling Attack@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "for each creature blocking it" instead of "for
    each creature that blocks it". The effect is not permanent and it only
    counts creatures blocking it on resolution of this spell.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_RED.guide/BARRE}

@endnode
@node BARLS "Barl's Cage"

@{b}Barl's Cage@{ub}

  Does not prevent a creature from untapping during upkeep phase.  It just
    stops the "normal" untap during the untap phase. [Aahz 12/02/94]

  Affects the next untap of that creature for whoever controls it at that
    time.  In other words, the effect does not remember the current
    controller. [bethmo 11/27/96]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_ARTIFACT.guide/BARLS}

@endnode
@node BARON "Baron Sengir"

@{b}Baron Sengir@{ub}

  Vampire Bats are not Vampires, they are Bats, so they cannot be regenerated.
    [Aahz 10/25/95]

+ The Baron is not a Vampire. [D'Angelo 09/02/97]

 @{" Card Information " link HL_BLACK.guide/BARON}

@endnode
@node BARTE "Bartel Runeaxe"

@{b}Bartel Runeaxe@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Bartel Runeaxe cannot be the target of creature
    enchantments.  Attacking does not cause Bartel Runeaxe to tap."
    [Encyclopedia Page 141]

  The errata gets rid of the word "spells", so the "cannot be targeted" effect
    applies to any way to target him with an enchantment, including casting an
    enchantment spell and all ways to move enchantments onto him.
    [WotC Rules Team 05/26/96]  Note that this makes Bartel's ability very
    different from other cards, such as Deadly Insect, which cannot be
    targeted by spells or effects.

  Cannot be targeted by enchant creature spells while in play, and will
    remove one if you somehow get one there. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]

  Animate Dead, Dance of the Dead, and Necromancy become creature enchantments
    and thus are removed by Bartel's ability. [D'Angelo 06/14/97]

  Can be targeted by abilities of enchantments. 
    [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 26]

  Is only immune to Enchant Creature enchantments.  Enchant Permanent and
    other local enchantments which are somehow enabled to target him are not
    affected by his ability. [DeLaney 01/28/97]

@node BGOLE "Basalt Golem"

@{b}Basalt Golem@{ub}

  The token creature is put into play as a triggered ability on blocking

 @{" Card Information " link MI_ARTIFACT.guide/BASAL}

@node BMONO "Basalt Monolith"

@{b}Basalt Monolith@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(Tap): Add 3 colorless mana to your mana pool.
    This mana may not be used to pay for any Basalt Monolith's untap ability.
    Does not untap as normal during untap phase; you may spend (3) at any
    other time to have Basalt Monolith untap at the end of the phase.
    Drawing mana from this artifact is played as a mana source."
    [Encyclopedia Page 208] [Mirage Page 2]

  The untapping of a Monolith is not an activation cost. [D'Angelo 02/01/95]

  Text on this card was changed between the Alpha and Beta printings of the
    Limited Edition.

 @{" Card Information " link 3E_ARTIFACT.guide/BASAL}

@endnode
@node BATTE "Battering Ram"

@{b}Battering Ram@{ub}

  As errata, the effect should read "Whenever a Battering Ram is blocked by a
    wall, destroy the wall at end of combat."  The entry in the Magic Official
    Encyclopedia on Page 20 has the words all mangled.

  A wall blocking this card gets a "destroy at end of combat" effect placed
    upon it when it is assigned as a blocker.  The effect is added to a wall 
    which becomes a blocker by any means, including being moved into being a 
    blocker by an effect such as General Jarkeld.  This mark stays even if the
    wall is removed from the blocking situation by an effect like General 
    Jarkeld. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  Before the errata, the Fourth Edition version of this card destroys the
    walls at end of combat while the Antiquities version destroys the walls
    during normal damage dealing. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]

@{b}Bazaar of Baghdad@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(Tap): Draw 2 cards; then choose and discard
    three cards from your hand." [Encyclopedia Page 123]

  This is all one effect.  You draw 2 and return 3 cards all in the effect's
    resolution.  Only mana sources may be used between the drawing and the
    returning of cards. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  This will count as 2 draws but anything that affects "drawn cards" can only
    affect ones still in your hand when the effect is completely resolved.
    [D'Angelo 07/11/95]

  You can use the Library of Leng ability to put the discarded cards back
    on top of your library. [Aahz 07/25/94]

 @{" Card Information " link AN_LAND.guide/BAZAA}

@endnode
@node BAZWO "Bazaar of Wonders"

@{b}Bazaar of Wonders@{ub}

  Because it only looks in play and in the graveyard, you can cast several of
    the same spell in the same batch of effects.  This is because a spell 
    which has been announced but has not yet resolved is in "limbo" and is
    not checked. [bethmo 11/06/96]

  The Bazaar of Wonders only looks at a spell just after the spell is
    announced, so if a card of the same name goes to the graveyard after
    announcement but before that spell resolves, the spell will not be
    countered. [bethmo 11/07/96]  If a spell of the same name goes to the
    graveyard during announcement (discarding as a cost for example), then the
    spell will be countered. [Aahz 01/17/97]

  Cannot counter mana sources since mana sources resolve completely before a
    trigger like this is deal with. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

@node BERSE "Berserk"

@{b}Berserk@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Until end of turn, target creature gains trample
    and +X/+0, where X is the creature's power.  If it attacks..."
    [Encyclopedia Page 56] This makes it a one time bonus and not something
    that recalculates.

  The creature can regenerate from dying due to attacking under Berserk.

  The creature only dies if it attacks, not if it defends.

  If the card stops being a creature before the end of the turn, it is
    still destroyed.  This happens with Jade Statue, and can happen with
    other animated cards. [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Type I tournaments since 01/25/94.  Was always banned from Type II

  As errata, play the mana gaining effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

  You may not remove mana counters from the Battery except at the time when
    you tap it for the one other mana.  The effect is pretty much that you
    tap for X+1 mana where X is the number of counters removed.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 8]  X can be zero. [D'Angelo 02/03/95]

  Can be tapped even if it has no counters. [D'Angelo 05/12/95]

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one

    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

  Amount of damage is determined in when the effect is resolved and not when
    it is announced. [D'Angelo 10/05/95]

  If you take control of a Vise that targets you, you continue to take damage
    from it.  The "target opponent" check is only made when it is cast and is
    not checked by the effect again after it is in play. [D'Angelo 01/07/96]

  The Fourth Edition version does damage at the end of upkeep.  The Limited,
    Unlimited and Revised Edition versions do damage at a time of your choice
    during upkeep. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]

  Was on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (none allowed in a deck) for
    Type II tournaments from 01/01/97 to 04/24/97 when it became banned

  Whether the land is a basic land or not is unchanged by this effect.

  The text "controller of target creature may distribute damage among

  The text "target creatures gain..." should say "target creature gains" since
    (as the next sentence shows) the spell only targets one creature.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]

  The +4/-4 is applied when the spell resolves and will not lower the
    toughness below 1.  So, if a 1/1 creature has Blood Lust cast on it, it
    becomes a 5/1 creature.  Later spells to modify toughness modify from
    this base, so a Giant Growth would make it an 8/4 creature.
    [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  If the toughness was below one before Blood Lust took effect, it will not
    raise the toughness up to one.  It just applies a -4, so a creature which
    was 2/-2 when Blood Lust resolves becomes 6/-6.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]  I don't think a zero or less toughness is
    possible under the current rules, so this may be a moot ruling.

  The text "Any creature damaged by Bone Shaman this turn cannot regenerate

  The "cannot regenerate" ability works only if some damage to the creature is

@{b}Bosium Strip@{ub}

  The part of the effect which removes the spell card from the game is a
    triggered ability which triggers on the playing (announcing) of the spell.
    This means the spell gets removed before interrupts or responses can be
    announced.  It also means that the remove from the game trigger is dealt
    with along with other normal triggers.  This makes it possible for an
    effect such as Bazaar of Wonders to be dealt with first and to have the
    spell countered before the remove from game effect and to have the
    remove from game effect fizzle. [Aahz 08/04/97]

  Note that even though the spell being cast no longer has a physcial card
    associated with it, it is still a valid spell and can be countered, and
    so on. [Aahz 06/14/97]

  Cards which remove cards from the graveyard as a cost can affect themselves
    when cast using Bosium Strip.  For example, Spinning Darkness will remove
    itself as a cost before the Strip effect removes it. [Aahz 06/24/97]

  Gets a counter if it is tapped when the mandatory untap phase effect

  Does not get a counter if Stasis in in play, but does get one if you don't
    untap it due to Winter Orb.  [WotC Rules Team 11/16/94]  This is because
    Stasis causes the untap phase to be skipped and thereby no chance to get a
    counter, and Winter Orb just makes the choice of keeping it tapped easier.
