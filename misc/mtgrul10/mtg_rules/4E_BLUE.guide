Text(TP): Counter target spell unless its caster pays an additional X. If he
          or she does not, tap all mana-producing lands that player controls
          and remove all mana from his or her mana pool.

Text(5E): Counter target spell unless that spell's caster pays an
          additional <X>. That player draws and pays all mana from
          lands and mana pool until <X> is paid; he or she may also
          draw and pay mana from other sources if desired.

Text(MI): Target spell is countered unless its caster spends an additional
          <X>. Caster must tap all lands and draw all mana to pay for the
          cost.

Text(IA): Counter target spell unless that spell's caster pays an additional
          <X>. That player must draw and pay all available mana from lands
          and mana pool until <X> is paid; he or she may also pay mana from
          other sources if desired.

Text(4E): Counter a target spell if its caster does not pay <X>. Target
          spell's caster must draw and pay all available mana from lands
          and mana pool until <X> is paid; he or she may also pay mana
          from other sources if desired.

Text(RV): Target spell is countered unless its caster spends X more mana.
          Caster of target spell must draw and spend all available mana
          from lands and mana pool until X is spent; he or she may also
          spend mana from other sources if desired. If this is not enough
          mana, target spell will still be countered.

Text(UL): Target spell is countered unless its caster spends X more mana;
          caster cannot choose to let it be countered. If caster of target
          spell doesn't have enough mana, all available mana from lands and
          mana pool must be paid but target spell will still be countered.
