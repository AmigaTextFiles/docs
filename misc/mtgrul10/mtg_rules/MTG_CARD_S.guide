@node SABER "Sabertooth Cobra"

@{b}Sabertooth Cobra@{ub}

  The "then" in the card text refers to the start of upkeep.  You have to pay
    the 2 mana before the start of your upkeep or it gives you the extra
    poison counter.  This means you have to pay on the previous turn because
    it is an instant-speed effect to pay the cost. [Aahz 09/24/96]

@{b}Sacred Boon@{ub}

  Targets the creature which is having damage prevented on it.  This is an

@node SACME "Sacred Mesa"

@{b}Sacred Mesa@{ub}

  Because activated abilities cannot be used before paying upkeep, it cannot

@node SACRI "Sacrifice"

@{b}Sacrifice@{ub}

  As errata, play the spell as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]  The spell is
    actually errata'd to be a "Mana Source" and not an "Interrupt".
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  Sacrificing an animated artifact gives the casting cost of the artifact.
    [bethmo]

  Sacrificing an animated land gives no mana since casting cost was zero.

  Sacrifice does not give any mana for the enchantments on the creature.
    [bethmo]

  The Revised Edition version of this card actually sacrifices the creature, 
    and since sacrifices cannot be prevented, this can be used even on 
    creatures with Protection from Black.  The Limited and Unlimited Edition 
    versions of this card merely "destroy without possibility of regeneration"
    and so cannot be used on creatures with Protection from Black.

@node SAFEH "Safe Haven"

@{b}Safe Haven@{ub}

  As errata, the first ability is used at the speed of an instant even though
    it is an interrupt on the card text. [Mirage Page 4]  So it cannot be used
    during damage prevention. [D'Angelo 10/15/96]

  When the creature leaves play any damage or "will be destroyed at some
    future time" effects are removed from the creature.

  Enchantments on creatures on destroyed and counters on creatures are removed
    when the creatures are sent to the Haven.  [WotC Rules Team 09/30/94]

  When creatures return to play, they come back as if just summoned with any
    counters or such due them on summoning.  Creatures with X in the casting
    cost are treated as X is zero. [WotC Rules Team 09/30/94]  Creatures which
    can pay costs when summoned to determine abilities must have those costs
    paid at this time.

  Creatures return to play simultaneously.  [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 29]

  If a Clone enters play and there is no creature to copy, it stays removed
    from the game and does not enter play.  A Clone may not copy another
    creature which is entering play at the same time it is.
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

  Creatures return to the control of their owners, regardless of who controls
    the Haven when it is sacrificed. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

  If the Haven is destroyed, any creatures it pulled out of the game are
    simply lost.  [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

  All cards in the Haven stay there even if they cease to be creatures.  When
    the Haven is sacrificed, the cards come back into play whether or not
    they are creatures. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  Token creatures are removed from the game when they leave play, so this 
    effect just removes them from the game with no chance to bring them back 
    like you can with cards. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  If changed to another land type using a spell such as Phantasmal Terrain,
    creatures are not lost but cannot be released until the land is reverted
    to normal. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

  The last sentence should read "Treat this as if they were just cast".
    [Aahz 10/06/94]

  Creatures are placed in the "out of the game" zone, so the Ring of Ma'Ruf
    can be used on them. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

  The Chronicles version has an activation cost to bring the creatures back
    into play while The Dark version does not. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 101]
    This makes the Chronicles one a fast effect and The Dark one a phase 
    effect. [Aahz 10/28/96]

@node SAGEL "Sage of Lat-Nam"

@{b}Sage of Lat-Nam@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(Tap): Sacrifice an artifact.  Draw one card."
    [Encyclopedia Page 134]  The Encyclopedia entry broke the cost/effect
    relationship so it has been corrected here. [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

  Cannot use the ability unless you have an artifact to sacrifice.  It is
    part of the cost. [Aahz]

  The "place in the graveyard" statement is actually a "sacrifice" and is a
    cost which cannot be prevented. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 14]

    until end of turn.  If that creature is destroyed before end of turn,
    bury Sandals of Abdallah".  The card type is "Artifact" and not
    "Mono Artifact". [Encyclopedia Page 127]  Bury instead of destroy.
    [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]

  Buried if creature using it goes to the graveyard.  It is not buried if
    the creature regenerates.  It is not buried if the creature is removed
    from the game (unless it goes to the graveyard first). [Aahz 06/13/96]

  As errata, it does not affect itself.  It should read "...each other
    tapped..." and "...each other untapped...". [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]

  Players only skip their untap phase if this card is in an untapped state
    right as they would start that phase. [bethmo 02/05/97]

  If you have 2 of these and both are tapped, they untap during your untap
    phase.  If both are untapped, then one of them is played first and will
    tap the other.  The other one never gets to do its effect because it is
    tapped.  If one is tapped and the other is untapped, the untapped one will
    untap the tapped one, then the newly untapped one will tap the original
    one. [Aahz 02/27/97]

  The Ghoul does not gain for cards "removed from the game".

  The Revised Edition version of this card only allows regeneration when
    the Ghoul dies due to taking damage.  It cannot regenerate from being

  Does not prevent sacrifices since sacrifices are not targeted. [Page 62]

  As errata, it should read "Comes into play tapped. (Tap): Remove Sword of
    the Ages and any number of creatures you control from the game to have
    Sword of the Ages deal the combined power of those creatures in damage to
    one target." [Encyclopedia Page 209]

  You can't sacrifice creatures you don't control. [Mirage Page 26]

  Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck) for
    Type I tournaments from 08/01/94 to 04/01/96.

  The creature does not die and therefore cannot be regenerated or drive
    any effect which is triggered by a creature dying (including Creature
    Bond, Personal Incarnation, Soul Net, etc.).  The creature just leaves
    the game. [bethmo]

  The controller of the creature may decide to "pump up" the creature
    before it leaves in order to get more life out of the deal because the
    total power of the creature (including enchantments and such) is
    counted on resolution of this spell.

  If the creature has a negative power, the player does not lose life.  It
    acts the same as if it had a power of zero. [Aahz]

  It changes the base power/toughness and not the current power toughness.
    In other words, if it a Holy Strength (+1/+2) on it and it blocks a 3/3
    creature, you can make it become 3/6 by playing the ability.

  You still put a creature card from your graveyard into your hand even if
    this card is not in your graveyard when the triggered effect resolves.

@{b}Sylvan Library@{ub}

  All effects in Magic are resolved one at a time, so if you use multiple
    Sylvan Libraries at once, each will resolve in sequence.  You do not
    get to draw all the cards at once then put them all back at once.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  You may wait until after your normal draw before deciding whether or not to
    use this effect. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 9]

  You can return zero, one, or two cards. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  This is all one effect.  You draw 2 and return 2 cards all on resolution.
    Only mana sources can be used between the two.  [D'Angelo 07/11/95]

  Triggered abilities do happen between the draw and discard because there is
    a "then" between the steps. [DeLaney 07/22/97] (REVERSAL)  So when in
    combination with effects like Breathstealer's Crypt it is possible to have
    fewer than 2 cards that you can put back.

  Note that Aladdin's Lamp is a specialized ability and can be used on a draw
    even if it is in the middle of resolving an effect. [Aahz 08/07/95]

  This will count as 2 draws for anything that affects "drawn cards".
    [D'Angelo 07/11/95]

  If you manage not to draw cards or draw less than 2 cards, you do not lose
    life by not putting the undrawn cards back.  Thus, you can use Mangara's
    Tome to get a card or two instead of drawing and avoid having to put
    cards back. [Aahz 10/21/96]

  If you have drawn cards prior to your draw phase, they can be ones chosen
    to be put back using this effect. [D'Angelo 03/21/97]  For example, a
    cantrip draw or a fast effect used during upkeep.

+ If you only get one or fewer draws due to this effect (because the other
    draws were replaced), you still have to put back 2 cards if possible.
    Any cards drawn this turn are are applicable to this.  This makes the
    Aladdin's Lamp replacement ineffective at escaping having to put a card
    back, since the Lamp does put a drawn card into your hand.
    [D'Angelo 05/21/97]

  If you have several ways to draw during your draw phase, you can do them in
    any order.  For example your regular draw, 2 Howling Mines and a Sylvan
    Library.  You can do the Library first (draw 2 and put 2) back, then your
    3 other draws.  Or you can do your 3 draws, then the Library (which lets
    you put back any 2 of the 5 cards you drew).  Or you can do some of the
    draws before and some after the library. [D'Angelo 03/21/97]

  The Fifth Edition version has an activation cost while the Legends and
    Fourth Edition versions did not. [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]
