@node ICAMO "Icatian Moneychanger"

@{b}Icatian Moneychanger@{ub}

  A copy (Clone, Doppelganger, etc) of a Moneychanger only causes a player
    to take damage and the Moneychanger to get counters when the copy card 
    itself is cast.  A later Doppelganger change to a Moneychanger results in 
    zero counters and zero damage. [Aahz 11/16/94]

  Yes, the damage is preventable and it does not reduce the number of 
    counters.  [Aahz 12/01/94]

  As errata, play the mana gaining effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

@node ICECA "Ice Cauldron"

@{b}Ice Cauldron@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "If Ice Cauldron leave play, bury all cards stored
    on it.  (X),(Tap): Put a charge counter on Ice Cauldron, and put a spell
    card from you hand face up on Ice Cauldron.  Note the type of mana used
    to pay this activation cost.  Use this ability only if there are no
    charge counters on Ice Cauldron.  You may play that spell as though it
    were a card in your hand.  (Tap): Remove the charge counter from Ice
    Cauldron to add mana of the type and amount lase used to put a charge
    counter on Ice Cauldron to your mana pool.  This mana is usable only to
    cast the spell on top of Ice Cauldron." [Encyclopedia Page 209]

  The effect puts a card from your hand onto the Cauldron.  This means that 
    cards which are not actually in your hand, such as ones on an Elkin 
    Bottle, cannot be played onto the Ice Cauldron. 
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]

  The card on the Cauldron is not "in play". [Aahz 06/08/95]  It is in the
    "set aside" zone.

  The mana put in the Cauldron can only be used to cast the given spell, but
    you can add additional mana to a spell.  [D'Angelo 06/08/95]  This means
    you can pay part of the cost on one turn and the rest of it on the next
    turn.

  The mana cannot be used to pay for penalty costs from things like Gloom.
    [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 61]

  The mana can be used for additional costs outlined in the spell, such as
    the black mana for Drain Life. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 61]

  Tapping the Cauldron for the mana is not an interrupt (or a mana source).  
    It is an instant.  So you don't get the mana back until the entire stack 
    resolves.  You can then use this mana on the spell during the following 
    spell stack.  [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  X can be zero.  This places a zero mana counter on the Cauldron.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  You do not have to use any mana from the Cauldron when casting the spell
    if you don't want to.  You don't even have to tap the Cauldron and draw
    the mana, you can just cast the spell.  [D'Angelo 06/12/95]

  You can cast the spell at any time as if it were in your hand.  The
    Cauldron does not have to be untapped for you to do this.  You can cast
    it as a result of the original effect and not as a continuous effect of
    the Cauldron. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  You can only cast the spell when you could legally cast it normally.  So no
    casting a Sorcery on your opponent's turn. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  When you cast the spell and it resolves, it either becomes a permanent or
    goes to the graveyard just like normal.  It does not stay on the
    Cauldron. [D'Angelo 08/01/95]

  If the Cauldron leaves your control, the spell stays on it.  The controller
    of the Cauldron is the only one that can tap to get the mana out of it.
    The player who put the spell on the Cauldron is the only one that can
    cast the spell on the Cauldron and they can do so even if they are not
    in control of the Cauldron. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  It is possible to have more than one spell on the Cauldron.  You can tap
    the Cauldron to remove the charge counter and whatever mana is on it but
    leave the spell there.  Later, you can tap it and put in mana and a
    charge counter to add another spell. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  If multiple spells are on the Cauldron, any one of them can be cast.  The
    language of "the spell on top of the Ice Cauldron" means "any spell on
    top of the Ice Cauldron". [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  If multiple spells are on the Cauldron, the mana can only be used for the
    spell that was put on the Cauldron along with the charge counter.
    [Aahz 06/29/95]

  Since tapping the Cauldron is an instant speed effect, it is possible for
    the Cauldron to be destroyed by a Disenchant in the same spell stack.
    The result is that you get the mana during the spell stack resolution,
    but the Cauldron (and any spells on it) are gone!  You're gonna take
    mana burn. [bethmo 06/22/95]  Note that if the spell on the Cauldron
    is a fast effect, you can still use mana from other sources to quickly
    get the spell on the Cauldron off.  You still get mana burn but won't
    lose the spell.

  If the act of putting the spell on the Cauldron is countered, you do not
    lose the spell since the spell would go on the Cauldron during resolution.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  If the Cauldron leaves play before the "put a spell under it" effect
    resolves, the card stays in your hand. [Aahz 11/25/96]

  You cannot store mana that is to be used for a special purpose into the
    Cauldron, such as Mishra's Workshop. [Aahz 07/04/95]

  If you use mana from a Soldevi Machinist to charge the Cauldron, you cannot
    use the mana to cast anything and so it's just mana burn waiting to
    happen.  This is because the Ice Cauldron remembers everything about how 
    the mana can be used and generates mana with the same restrictions.
    [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 44]

  Power Artifact will reduce the cost of placing a charge counter on it by 2,
    but the Cauldron will count only mana spent on it and will not store
    extra mana because of the Power Artifact's effect.  Thus, if you spent
    RR2 by declaring an RR4 cost, you get RR2 later and not RR4.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  Power Artifact will force a minimum expenditure of 1 on the Cauldron.

@node ICEFL "Ice Floe"

@{b}Ice Floe@{ub}

  See the @{"Tap and Hold Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_TAPH} entry in the General Rulings.

  Can be used on an already tapped attacker. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8]

  A creature on the Ice Floe will not be freed even if it gains Flying later.
    It is only freed when the Floe untaps or leaves play.  [D'Angelo 07/05/95]

  The attacking creature is not removed from the attack and still deals
    damage as normal. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 8]

  Cannot be used on a creature before it is declared to be attacking since
    it only targets attacking creatures.  By the time the creature is 
    attacking, it is too late to stop it from continuing forward and dealing
    damage. [D'Angelo 08/22/95]

  Does not prevent a creature from untapping during upkeep or during any time
    other than the untap phase. [bethmo 07/24/95]

@node ICYMA "Icy Manipulator"

@{b}Icy Manipulator@{ub}

  Opponent gets a chance to use the card being Manipulated during the same
    batch if they so wish (if such would be legal).  The "no effect" text on 
    the Limited and Unlimited Edition versions of this card can be easily 
    misread.  It means that your tapping has no effect, not that your opponent
    cannot respond by using the card to some effect (if that would be a legal
    action).  There is no difference of any sort in the play or use of the 
    various versions of the Icy Manipulator!

  Note that any cards which might trigger off a card becoming tapped still
    trigger.  Thus, a Psychic Venom on a land that becomes tapped will
    cause 2 damage. [D'Angelo 03/12/95]  Similarly, if the card itself
    triggers on its own tapping, such as City of Brass or Sorrow's Path, the 
    effect will still happen.  The "no effect" text on the Icy only means
    that this tapping will not activate the card.  [D'Angelo 04/12/95]

  Can target a tapped card, but tapping a tapped card does nothing useful.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23] And it will not trigger "if the card 
    becomes tapped" effects.

  The text was changed between the Alpha and Beta printings of the Limited
    Edition to include the "no effect" statement.

  Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Type I tournaments from 01/25/94 to 03/23/94.  It was removed once
    Antiquities made it easier to destroy artifacts.

@node ICYPR "Icy Prison"

@{b}Icy Prison@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "During your upkeep, bury Icy Prison.  Any player 
    may pay {3} to prevent this."  This card explicitly breaks the rules
    about burial being unpreventable. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  Enchantments on the creature are destroyed and counters on creatures removed
    when the creature is sent to the Prison.  [Aahz 06/30/95]

  This card's effect is a phase effect for the upkeep phase. [Aahz 12/20/96]

@{b}Ifh-Biff Efreet@{ub}

  You can pay the Efreet more than once a turn, even more than once in a
    given spell stack. [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  Each payment counts as a separate use and therefore a separate packet of
    damage. [bethmo]  It is not an activation cost.

  The Efreet does indeed damage itself (unless it is no longer flying).

@{b}Illusionary Mask@{ub}

  See the @{"Face Down Cards" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_FDOW} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  As errata, it is of type "Artifact" and not "Poly Artifact".
    [Encyclopedia Page 57]

  This card does not affect in any way the original spell casting cost
    (amounts or colors).  It just allows you to spend X additional mana of
    any color to disguise what the real cost was.  [Card Text]

  X can be zero.

  If the Mask is destroyed, the creatures still remain face-down until one
    of the conditions of turning it over are met.  [bethmo]

  Only usable on summoned creatures, not on artifact creatures or animated
    lands. [bethmo]  Similarly, it can't be used for Resurrected or
    Animated creatures.

  The true casting cost of the spell can be masked.  If your opponent wants
    to Spell Blast the creature, they need to guess at the casting cost of
    the creature exactly.  Overspending or underspending on Spell Blast will 
    cause it to fizzle. [Aahz 06/24/94]

  This effect is played as a specialized effect. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

  If Power Artifact is placed on it, the minimum Mask use cost is 1.

@{b}Imprison@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...becomes tapped.  Bury Imprison if mana is not

  This is a really weird specialized ability that gets used before attempting
    to attack, block or tap.  Otherwise the action is prevented and never
    even gets announced. [Aahz 10/28/96]  If something is not announced, then
    you are considered to not have paid any of its announce costs, so if you
    did pay them, take them back.

  You do not pay twice when it taps to attack.

  There is a typo on this card.  The gray circle for the generic mana
    cost accidentally appears one line above the "1" it should be behind it.

+ Does not prevent creature abilities which are played as mana sources from
    being played even if the 1 mana is paid. [D'Angelo 10/11/97]

  Any enchantments (or other effects) which are on the creature that would
    cause it to not be untapped (or have a cost to be untapped) during
    untap phase do not in any way hinder or imply a cost to use the
    ability to untap once during the turn. [bethmo]

+ If cast on a creature the same turn it is summoned, the creature may
    attack or use special abilities with a tap in the cost that turn.
    [Card Text]  This is because the card says it allows the creature to
    ignore summoning sickness.

  If played on an opponent's creature, the creature will be untapped during
    the controller of the creature's untap phase (unless prevented) and can
    be untapped during the controller of the enchantment's turn. [bethmo]

  If there is something preventing the creature from attacking at all,
    Instill Energy will not override it.  Thus, Walls are normally prevented,
    Sea Serpent cannot attack unless your opponent has Islands, and so on.
    [D'Angelo 05/26/95]

  The Limited/Unlimited Edition does not give the creature the ability to
    untap during untap if the creature is otherwise prevented from doing so.
    The related text is just a reminder. [D'Angelo 11/08/96]

+ The Fifth Edition version now completely removes the effects of summoning
    sickness.  Previous versions only gave the creature the ability to
    attack but not the right to use abilities with tap in the cost.

  As errata, it should read "If target opponent plays a Summon spell that does
    not match..." [Encyclopedia Page 150]

  If you have no creatures in play then by definition your opponent's summon
    spell cannot be of the same color as a creature you have in play.  In
    this case they will always have to pay the extra mana. [bethmo 06/29/94]

  Note that artifact creatures are not "summoned" and therefore are not
    affected by this spell. [Aahz 06/27/94]

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one 
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

  This effect triggers when the spell is announced and prior to allowing
    interrupts to it. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]

  Only checks the colors of your creatures at announcement (read the word
    "casts" as "announces").  If your creatures change after that (even as 
    an interrupt), it will not cause this effect to trigger.

  Only skip drawing one of your cards on a given turn to get the Sanctuary.
    [bethmo 05/30/94] If Howling Mine is in play, you only get to forego one
    of the draws, and you can look at the first card before deciding
    to skip the second.  [Aahz 12/13/94]

  Declining a draw should be thought of as a payment.  Declining one draw
    cannot be used to activate more than one Sanctuary (or other effect).
    If you have multiple Sanctuaries, you need to decline a draw for each
    one you want to use. [D'Angelo 09/27/95]

  Does not count as an Island for any spell which expects Islands.
    [bethmo]

  Once activated, the effect will continue until your next turn even if this
    card leaves play. [D'Angelo 10/27/95]

  This is a phase effect.  It may be used on only one draw during each draw
    phase. [D'Angelo 11/07/96]

  The Alpha printing of the Limited Edition version of this card only
    prevented damage from creatures that are not flying or IslandWalking.
    All other printings prevent such creatures from even being used to
    attack.  The distinction is subtle, but with the non-Alpha versions you
    can use the Nettling Imp or Siren's Call to kill off creatures since
    they cannot attack you. [bethmo]

  The Fifth Edition version has an activation cost, while previous versions
    did not. [D'Angelo 04/11/97]

  See @{"Phase Skipping" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHAS} in the General Rulings for more information.

  If more than one of these dies in a turn, the loss of draw phases adds up.
    You do not get to skip just one draw phase to pay off more than one
    Gargoyle death. [WotC Rules Team 07/29/96]

  A Clone or Doppelganger of this card which leaves play does get returned to
    play at the end of the turn just like a normal Gargoyle would.  This is
    because it was a Gargoyle when it left play and the effect triggered.
    If there are no creatures in play to copy at the time it enters play, 
    the effect of returning to play fizzles. [Aahz 05/21/96]

  If a player other than the owner controls it at the time it goes to the
    graveyard, then that controller is the one who loses a draw phase, not the
    owner. [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32]

  The effect that brings it back into play is considered controlled by the
    player who controlled the Gargoyle when it went to the graveyard.  
    Therefore, the Gargoyle is considered to be put into play by the 
    controller at the time it died, even though it gets put into play under 
    the control of the Gargoyle's owner. [Aahz 06/18/96]  This matters only
    if someone steals the Gargoyle and has an effect which triggers when they
    bring a creature into play.

  If it goes to the graveyard after you are done dealing with your "at end of
    turn" effects in the Cleanup phase, it will not come back into play.  But,
    if it goes during your "at end of turn" effect handling, it will return.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96] This reverses a ruling in Duelist Magazine #12
    on Page 26.  (See General Rulings on the @{"Cleanup phase" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TO_CLEANUP})  This means it
    is possible to get an infinite loop if Vibrating Sphere is in play.  In
    this case, just bury the Gargoyle and lose all the rest of your draw
    phases in the game.  Then continue. [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]
