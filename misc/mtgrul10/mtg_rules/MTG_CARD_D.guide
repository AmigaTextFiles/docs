@node DAMPI "Damping Field"

@{b}Damping Field@{ub}

  Does not prevent artifacts (such as Colossus) from untapping during upkeep.

  Artifact creatures are artifacts.  They untap as artifacts, so only one may
    untap.  If Smoke is also in play, then untapping an artifact creature
    counts as your one creature and as your one artifact.

@node DANCE "Dance of Many"

@{b}Dance of Many@{ub}

  See the @{"Copy Cards" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_COPY} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  See the @{"Token Creatures" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_TOKE} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  As errata, the target is chosen when it is played and not when it comes
    into play. [Duelist Magazine #14, Page 26]

  As errata to The Dark version, it is buried (not destroyed).
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  Treat the token as a just-summoned creature of the appropriate type.  If
    that creature normally gets counters upon being cast, the token creature
    gets counters. [bethmo 08/10/94]

  Can be used on any creature which is a Summon card, even if the creature
    is in play only because of Animate Dead.  In the case of Animate Dead,
    the copy does not have the -1 power penalty. [WotC Rules Team 09/30/94]

  Destroying the creature which was copied will not cause the token creature
    to be destroyed as well. [Aahz 10/21/94]

  This spell is targeted and checks the validity of the target when declared
    and when resolving.  If the creature is not still there when the copy
    resolves, the spell fizzles. [WotC Rules Team 02/09/95]

  The casting cost is copied.  This makes Dance of Many the only exception to
    the rule that token creatures have a casting cost of zero.
    [Aahz 11/13/95]

  The creature is still considered a token creature, so if you happen to copy
    a Drudge Skeleton, the Skeleton token would still be susceptible to
    Drudge Spell. [Aahz 03/02/96]

  The remove from play effects are from Dance of Many and not from the token.
    [D'Angelo 10/01/96]  This means that a copy of the token creature will not
    be subject to the remove from play effect. [D'Angelo 05/19/97]

  Each Dance of Many is associated only with its token creature.  If one
    leaves play, only the corresponding token is affect, not all tokens from
    all instances of Dance of Many. [D'Angelo 05/19/97]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLUE.guide/DANCE}

@endnode
@node DDEAD "Dance of the Dead"

@{b}Dance of the Dead@{ub}

  As errata, it is now of card type "Enchantment" and not "Enchant Dead
    Creature".  It's text is now "When you play Dance of the Dead, choose
    target creature card in any graveyard. When Dance of the Dead comes into
    play, put that creature into play, tapped, and Dance of the Dead becomes a
    creature enchantment that targets the creature. Enchanted creature
    gets +1/+1, and does not untap during its controller's untap phase. At the
    end of his or her upkeep, its controller may pay an additional 1B to untap
    it. If Dance of the Dead leaves play, bury the creature."
    [Wotc Rules Team 06/01/97]

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  Enters play as a global enchantment and then becomes an Enchant Creature as
    a triggered effect upon entering play.  It follows all the rules for 
    Enchant Creature cards from then on. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97] (Borrowed
    from Necromancy rulings)

  The bringing of the creature into play and then putting Dance of the Dead 
    on it is all done as one triggered ability. [bethmo 02/25/97]  (Borrowed 
    from Necromancy rulings)

  As a local enchantment, its only legal target is the one chosen when it
    entered play, thus there is no other legal target to move it to with
    Enchantment Alteration. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  (Borrowed from
    Necromancy rulings)

  In general, an animated creature comes out as if it was just cast.  Any X
    in the casting cost is zero.  So animating a Rock Hydra gives you
    a hydra with zero heads.  [Mirage Page 31]

  You can Dance of the Dead a creature which was discarded from a hand and 
    therefore was never in play.

  Dance of the Dead becomes a creature enchantment spell and so it does
    activate the Rabid Wombat and trigger other cards which use creature
    enchantments.  [Aahz 06/06/97]

  Animated creature cannot attack until it begins its controller's turn in
    play. [Mirage Page 14]

  Animating a dead Clone gets all the Clone's abilities but mimics at +1/+1.
    [D'Angelo 09/25/95]

  This is a targeted effect.  Note that cards in the graveyard do not have
    Protection from Color abilities, but it may fizzle because the target
    is removed before the effect resolves. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]
    (Based on Animate Dead ruling)

  When Dance of the Dead leaves play, the creature it is buried.  A death
    event is still generated. [WotC Rules Team 05/10/95]  This happens even
    if there is another Animate Dead or Dance of the Dead on the creature
    since if even one is removed, the creature is buried as a triggered
    effect. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 51]

  Cannot be cast on dead creatures which are in play because of another
    Dance of the Dead spell, but can be moved using Enchantment Alteration
    from one animated creature to another.  If so, you gain control of that
    creature since your animate is more recent than the other one.
    [WotC Rules Team 11/16/94] (Based on Animate Dead ruling)

  If more than one Dance of the Dead ends up on a creature, each contributes a
    +1/+1 and an additional 1B to the untap cost. [D'Angelo 09/25/95]

  The caster of Dance of the Dead is not considered the "caster" of the
    creature that is brought back into play.  The "caster" is the "owner.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123] (Based on Animate Dead ruling)

@node DANDA "Dandan"

@{b}Dandan@{ub}

  As errata to the Arabian Nights version of this card, it should say
    "defending player" instead of "opponent". [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

  As errata to the Arabian Nights version, it is buried (not destroyed) if
    you have no Islands. [WotC Rules Team 10/01/96]

@endnode
@node DWOOD "Dark Heart of the Wood"

@{b}Dark Heart of the Wood@{ub}

  The text on the card explaining the color is considered to be explanatory
    and not characteristic text.  This means that it cannot be affected by
    Sleight of Mind.  [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 22]  This is true even under
    the new rulings made on 12/03/96 for the Crimson Kobold (and other
    Kobolds).

  This card can have its color changed by a lace spell but not by
    Sleight of Mind.  This is a REVERSAL of a ruling in Duelist Magazine #2
    on page 86. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_GOLD.guide/DARKH}

@endnode
@node DARKM "Dark Maze"

@{b}Dark Maze@{ub}

  The text about not being able to attack is just reminder text aboue
    summoning sickness and is not absolute.  If you find a way to ignore
    summoning sickness, it can attack on the turn it comes under your
    control. [Aahz 12/07/96]

@node DPACT "Darkpact"

@{b}Darkpact@{ub}

  If you use some spell or effect (like Natural Selection) which allows you
    to peek at cards in the library, you can still use Darkpact.

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a deck)
    for Classic (Type I) and Standard (Type II) tournaments since 01/25/94
    because it is only used in games for Ante.  Has always been banned from
    Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) and Extended tournaments.

@node DRITU "Dark Ritual"

@{b}Dark Ritual@{ub}

  As errata to pre-Mirage versions of the card, play the spell as a mana
    source. [Mirage Page 2]  The spell is actually errata'd to be a "Mana
    Source" and not an "Interrupt". [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

+ This card, as with all Mana Source cards, goes to the graveyard when it
    resolves.  It does not stay in play. [D'Angelo 09/02/97]

  Changed to use mana symbols instead of the word black mana between the
    Limited/Unlimited Edition and the Revised Edition versions of the card.
    The Revised and Fourth Edition cards can not be affected by Sleight of
    Mind.

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/DRITU}

@endnode
@node DSPHE "Dark Sphere"

@{b}Dark Sphere@{ub}

  Multiple Dark Spheres multiply in effect rather than adding.  So two of them
    will result in 1/4 damage, not zero damage.  This is because you apply
    them sequentially and simultaneously. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

@endnode
@node DAZZL "Dazzling Beauty"

@{b}Dazzling Beauty@{ub}

  As errata, it targets an attacking creature. [Duelist Magazine #15, Page 28]

  Does not trigger most blocking effects since most of them say they happen
    when a creature blocks, not when the blocked without a creature.
    [D'Angelo 11/11/96]  Keeper of Tresserhorn's effect can be stopped, as 
    can effects of "Is Not Bocked" creatures.

  Works on unblockable creatures. [bethmo 11/18/96]  Or on creatures that have
    special blocking requirements such as when Goblin War Drums is in effect.
    [bethmo 01/22/97]

  If used on Merchant Ship, it does not stop the "gain 2 life" ability.  This
    is because Merchant Ship actually says (with errata) "If Merchant Ship
    attacks and no creatures are assigned to block it, ...". [bethmo 01/09/97]

  Is not very useful against Trample creatures since Trample damage comes
    through as if a zero toughness creature blocked the Trampler.

@{b}Deep Spawn@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Trample.  During your upkeep, take two cards from
    the top of your library and put them in your graveyard, or bury Deep
    Spawn. ..." [Encyclopedia Page 179]

  The two cards put into the graveyard are not discards from your hand and so
    Library of Leng does not apply. [Aahz 11/30/94]

  Does not cause enchantments on it to be removed when the effect is 
    activated.  An enchantment in play is neither a spell or an effect.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 7]

  Does not prevent enchantments already on it from being used.

@node DWATE "Deep Water"

@{b}Deep Water@{ub}

  All affected lands produce just one blue mana regardless of how many it
    might normally generate. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]  So a storage land
    produces one blue even if you remove zero or three counters.  Other lands
    which produce more than one mana are similarly restricted.

  Mana Flare will make the lands provide one extra blue mana.
    [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]

  Will remove restrictions on how mana generated by the land is used.
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]  For example, the blue mana from a
    Mishra's Workshop can be used for any purpose.

@node DEFLE "Deflection"

@{b}Deflection@{ub}

  Only targets the spell being Deflected and not the original or new target
    of the spell it is affecting. [Aahz 07/09/95]

  You cannot choose an invalid target for the new spell.  You have to pick
    a valid target on announcement.  If the target of the spell being
    Deflected is not valid on resolution, then Deflection fails.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  Cannot deflect any spell to the Deflection itself since when you are
    announcing it (and choosing its targets), it is not yet a spell.  It 
    becomes a spell once all the costs and targets are successfully chosen.  
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  You cannot make an interrupt (like Counterspell or Deflection) target itself
    or anything other than what it targets already.  This means you cannot 
    create an infinite loop of spells.  [Aahz 10/30/96]

@node DELER "Delirium"

@{b}Delirium@{ub}

  See @{"Fog Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_FOGE} in the general rulings for more information.

  Delirium does three separate things, and it works on any creature your 
    opponent controls, regardless of whether it's tapped or not.  If the 
    creature isn't already tapped, Delirium taps it.  The creature then deals 
    damage to the player.  Finally, the creature neither deals nor receives 
    combat damage.  Each part is independent.  Even if the creature is already
    tapped (so the first part fails), the 2nd and 3rd part still happen.
    [bethmo 10/16/96]

  Tapping the creature is part of the effect and not the cost, therefore you
    can play it on a tapped creature. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 28]

  The spell fails if you do not find the card before your library is empty.
    You do not lose the game at that point.  You lose on the next time you
    have to draw. [Aahz 06/08/95]

  Because choosing the card to draw for is a casting decision, you cannot
    change this decision when you Fork this spell.  You must dig for the
    same card. [Aahz 09/05/95]

  You must name a card that actually exists in the game of Magic.
    [Aahz 10/07/95]

  There is no way to make this card affect your opponent.  It affects "you",
    and "you" means the caster. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]  It has no

  May not use its ability until its upkeep is paid for that turn.  [bethmo]

  Paying the Hordes is optional.  You may choose not to pay them but then

    target player (not the caster of this spell) chooses which colors are
    drawn at the time they draw it. [bethmo]

  If a land has different amounts of mana that can be drawn, the maximum will
