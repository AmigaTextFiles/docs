@node RABID "Rabid Wombat"

@{b}Rabid Wombat@{ub}

  If an enchantment is removed from the Wombat, its power and toughness
    change immediately. [bethmo 06/16/94]

  Animate Dead, Necromancy, and Dance of the Dead all become creature
    enchantments and do pump up the Wombat. [Aahz 06/06/97]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GREEN.guide/RABID}

@endnode
@node RACK_ "The Rack"

@{b}The Rack@{ub}

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one 
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play. 
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]  The Fourth Edition version says this.

  Amount of damage is determined when effect is resolved and not when it is
    announced. [D'Angelo 10/05/95]

  The Fourth Edition version does damage at the end of upkeep.  The
    Antiquities and Revised Edition versions let you choose a time during 
    upkeep to take the damage. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/THERA}

@endnode
@node RADIA "Radiant Essence"

@{b}Radiant Essence@{ub}

  You choose one opposing player on casting and it only affects that one
    player.  This target is not changed even if this card changes controllers.
    It becomes useless but stays in play if the target player leaves play.
    [D'Angelo 10/15/96]

  If you take control of a Radiant Essence that targets you, it continues to
    count your permanents. [DeLaney 02/19/97]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GOLD.guide/RADIA}

@endnode
@node RADJA "Radjan Spirit"

@{b}Radjan Spirit@{ub}

  Can be used on a creature without Flying with no effect. 
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 23]

  Removes all Flying abilities from the creature.

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GREEN.guide/RADJA}

@endnode
@node RAGRI "Raging River"

@{b}Raging River@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "When you attack, defending player must divide
    his or her creatures between the left and right sides of the River.  You
    then choose on which side of the River to place each attacking creature,
    and attacking creatures can only be blocked by flying creatures or those
    on the same side of the River, or creatures that enter play after this
    division." [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  Two Raging Rivers result in one extra long river.  Not more splits. [Snark]
    In other words, it is not cumulative.

  This is not a targeted spell. [bethmo]

  Opponent chooses which side of the river each creature is on before you
    even choose what creatures you are attacking with.
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  If an attacking creature is stolen by the opponent, it can only block on
    the same side of the river it was assigned, unless it is a flying creature
    then it can go to either side. [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

  If a defending creature gains flying after being assigned a side of the
    river, it can block a creature on the other side. [D'Angelo 06/30/95]

  If a creature enters play (or something becomes a creature) after the attack
    is announced, the creature is not limited to one side of the river or the
    other.  It can block creatures on either side just like a Flying creature 
    can. [WotC Rules Team 11/10/95]  If it can block more than one creature,
    it can even block creatures on both sides at once. [Aahz 01/16/96]

 @{" Card Information " link UL_RED.guide/RAGIN}

@endnode
@node RAGMA "Rag Man"

@{b}Rag Man@{ub}

  In multiplayer games can choose a different opposing player each time it
    is used. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLACK.guide/RAGMA}

@endnode
@node RAIDI "Raiding Party"

@{b}Raiding Party@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "... A player may tap a white creature he or she
    controls to prevent up to two ..." [Encyclopedia Page 189]

  The creatures are tapped during spell resolution and not during the damage
    prevention step. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]

  The color of creature to be tapped is set when the effect is announced and 
    even if you use Sleight of Mind after that, you cannot change what color
    creature needs to be tapped to prevent the destruction. [Aahz 05/09/95]
 
 @{" Card Information " link FE_RED.guide/RAIDI}

@endnode
@node RAINB "Rainbow Vale"

@{b}Rainbow Vale@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(Tap): Add one mana of any color to your mana
    pool and choose target opponent.  The opponent gains control of Rainbow
    Vale at end of turn." [Encyclopedia Page 189]

  Only changes controller at the end of a turn in which it was tapped for
    mana.  It does not change controller if it is not tapped for mana.
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 7]  You choose the player to give it to at
    the time it is tapped for mana.

  Will change control if forced to tap for mana by effects such as Power Sink.
    [Aahz 12/02/94]

  Will not change if tapped by Mana Short since Mana Short does not tap a land
    for mana. [D'Angelo 03/22/95]

  Does change controller even if it stops being a Rainbow Vale before the end
    of the turn (by effects such as Phantasmal Terrain or Blood Moon).  The
    control change locks in when you announce the effect.
    [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 51]

  If under a player's control due to some lasting effect, it will still
    switch players when tapped. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]

  Stays in the same tapped/untapped state it is in when it switches
    controllers. [D'Angelo 07/07/95]

  If more than one player manages to tap it for mana in a given turn, then
    two control changes will be scheduled for the end of the turn.  
    [bethmo 07/19/95]  These effects resolve using the standard order for
    such effects, so the current player's effects go first, then the 
    opponent's.

  The land's changing of controllers is a new effect each time it is used so
    it will take precedence over any other control effects.  This means that
    using Conquer on a Rainbow Vale won't guarantee that you keep it.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 98]

@node RAISE "Raise Dead"

@{b}Raise Dead@{ub}

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  You must show the card you bring out of the graveyard to your opponent.
    [bethmo]

  You can Raise Dead a creature which was discarded from your hand and was
    therefore never in play.

  The creature being brought back is chosen on announcement and not on
    resolution of the spell because it is targeted.
    [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/RAISE}

@endnode
@node RAKAL "Rakalite"

@{b}Rakalite@{ub}

  Only returns to your hand if it is still in play at the end of the turn.
    If it leaves play, it does not return. [bethmo]

  Can be used any number of times during the turn before it leaves play.

  Can choose different targets for each use.

+ The Chronicles version does not target anything while the Antiquities
    version also targets the player or creature.
    [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 101]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/RAKAL}

@endnode
@node RAMGR "Rampant Growth"

@{b}Rampant Growth@{ub}

  The land does not count toward your one per turn limit because it was put
    into play by an effect. [Duelist Magazine #16, Page 30]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GREEN.guide/RAMPA}

@endnode
@node RASPU "Rasputin Dreamweaver"

@{b}Rasputin Dreamweaver@{ub}

  As errata, play the damage prevention ability as an instant. [Mirage Page 4]

  As errata, play the mana producing ability as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GOLD.guide/RASPU}

@endnode
@node RAVEN "Ravenous Vampire"

@{b}Ravenous Vampire@{ub}

  If sacrificed to itself, it gets the +1/+1 counter before it goes to the
    graveyard.  Abilities that trigger on its death will count the +1/+1.
    [Aahz 06/11/97]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_BLACK.guide/RAVEN}

@endnode
@node RAYCO "Ray of Command"

@{b}Ray of Command@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...activation cost.  If you lose control of the
    creature at end of this turn, tap it." [Encyclopedia Page 95]

  The creature only taps when you lose control of it at the end of the turn.
    It will not tap due to any other control changes.
    [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 60]

  Can be used on an untapped creature.  Being tapped is not a targeting
    requirement. [Aahz 06/08/95]

  Only removes "summoning sickness" from the creature.  It does not allow a
    Wall to attack, allow an attack when an attack would be illegal or
    override any other rules. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

  The creature taps after returning to the opponent (if it is not already
    tapped), so any effects triggered off it tapping happen at that time.
    [Aahz 07/05/95]

  If your creature is untapped, you can use the ability before Ray of Command
    resolves.  If it is tapped, then you cannot use a tap ability before
    it switches controllers.  The creature untaps at the same time that it
    switches controllers, so it cannot be tapped really quickly before it
    switches. [bethmo 07/24/95]

  Note that the creature gets summoning sickness again when it returns so
    it cannot be tapped for an ability or attack until it begins that player's
    turn under their control again. [D'Angelo 08/02/95]

+ This effect ends if the creature phases out.  The creature will phase back
    in without the Ray of Command's control effect, which typically means it
    will be under its original controller's control. [D'Angelo 09/02/97]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLUE.guide/RAYCO}

@endnode
@node RAYER "Ray of Erasure"

@{b}Ray of Erasure@{ub}

  As errata, this card should have you draw a card at the beginning of the
    next turn, not the next turn's upkeep.  [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 28]

  See the @{"Cantrip" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CANT} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  Can be played if opponent has no cards in their library.  They do not lose
    the game.  You still get to draw a card next upkeep. [Aahz 06/08/95]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLUE.guide/RAYER}

@endnode
@node REALI "Reality Twist"

@{b}Reality Twist@{ub}

  If a player uses Magical Hack to make a land type be listed as producing
    two different colors, the player tapping the land for mana can choose to
    produce mana of either color. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 100]  But if it
    produces more than one mana, all mana is of the same color.
    [D'Angelo 07/21/95]

  See @{"Naked Singularity" link MTG_CARD_N.guide/NAKED} for some other related rulings.

 @{" Card Information " link IA_BLUE.guide/REALI}

@endnode
@node REBIR "Rebirth"

@{b}Rebirth@{ub}

+ Has always been on the Duelists' Convocation banned list (not allowed in a
    deck) for Type I, Standard (Type II), Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) and
    Extended tournaments because it is only used in games for Ante.  Now
    banned in Standard (Type II) because it is no longer in the base set.

 @{" Card Information " link LG_GREEN.guide/REBIR}

@endnode
@node RECAL "Recall"

@{b}Recall@{ub}

  As errata to the Legends version of this card, it should read "Choose and
    discard X cards from your hand to take X target cards from your graveyard
    and put them into your hand. Remove Recall from the game".
    [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]

  The cards are discarded from your hand during announcement and as a cost 
    instead of being discarded on resolution.  It is not a forced discard, so 
    it cannot be used with Library of Leng.  [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 56]

  Choose which cards in the graveyard are being recalled during announcement.
    [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 34]  As with all spells, targets are chosen
    at the same time costs are being paid, so the discarded cards are not
    valid targets.

  If one or more of the target cards in the graveyard is not there upon
    resolution, you still get the others. [bethmo 03/11/96]

  The "UXX" casting cost is not a misprint.  It means to spend one blue plus
    two times X generic mana to cast the spell. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 7]

  Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Type I tournaments since 08/01/94.  Was on the restricted list for
    Type II tournaments from 08/01/94 through 04/01/96.  Has always been
    banned from Type I.5 tournaments.

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_BLUE.guide/RECON}

@endnode
@node REDEL "Red Elemental Blast"

@{b}Red Elemental Blast@{ub}

  As errata, play the effect as an instant when targeting a permanent and as
    an interrupt when targeting a spell. [Mirage Page 4]  The spell is still
    an "Interrupt" and not an "Instant" for effects that affect certain
    spell types. [Aahz 09/19/96]

  The decision to counter a spell or destroy a permanent is a decision made
    on announcement before a target of the proper type is selected.  
    [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 50]  See @{"Modal Effects" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_MODA} in the General Rulings
    for more information.

  The Limited, Unlimited, and Revised Edition versions only can target blue
    cards or spells while the Fourth Edition on can target any blue
    permanent (including tokens) or spells. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 11]

  As errata to the Alpha printing of the Limited Edition version of this
    card, the card should be of type "Interrupt" and not "Instant".

@node REFLE "Reflecting Mirror"

@{b}Reflecting Mirror@{ub}

  This spell only changes the target of a spell, and not the caster.
    [bethmo 08/10/94]

  Can only be used during the period where a spell can be interrupted right
    before it becomes successfully "cast".  You cannot wait until later to
    use this effect.  [D'Angelo 05/22/95]

+ Cannot be used on spells which are not targeted such as Hurricane.
    [Aahz 08/12/94]

+ Cannot be used on spells which affect "you" and which do not say they target
    you, as with a "target player" spell where you choose yourself.
    [D'Angelo 10/13/97]

  Cannot be used on spells in which only one "fork" of the spell targets you.
    For example, you cannot Reflect a Fireball which targets you and one of
    your creatures. [Aahz 09/15/94]

  Spells such as Mind Twist which affect your "opponent" are considered
    targeted and can be reflected. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 7]
    This includes even spells like Mana Clash. [D'Angelo 01/19/95]
    See other card entries if you have other questions.

  Cannot be used on spells like Eye for An Eye which target something else but
    do damage to you. [WotC Rules Team 11/16/94]

  Cannot be used on effects generated by permanents.  Those are effects and
    not spells. [Aahz 08/12/94]

  Can be used on spells which will become permanents but that are targeted.
    For example, and artifact like Black Vise or an enchantment like Lifetap
    target a player when cast.  But you cannot choose an illegal target.
    Thus if the spell targets "opponent", you cannot reflect it to target the
    caster. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]

  Note that Siren's Call cannot be reflected since it can only target
    the current player. [Duelist Magazine #6, Page 131]

  You must show the card you bring out of the graveyard to your opponent.
    [bethmo]

  You can Regrow a card which was discarded from your hand and was therefore
    never in play.

  This is a targeted effect. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  Can use Deflection to force selection of a different card in the Regrowth
    caster's graveyard. [bethmo 04/01/96]

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Classic (Type I) tournaments since 03/23/94.  Was on the
    Standard (Type II) restricted list until 05/02/95 when it became banned

@{b}Reincarnation@{ub}

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  Caster selects the creature which comes into play. [Card Text]

  Can bring back the same creature because you select the creature after
    sending the current one to the graveyard. [bethmo 06/29/94]

  This sets up a triggered effect.  When the creature goes to the graveyard,
    the effect will trigger and normal triggered effect resolution takes
    place. [Aahz 06/14/96]  If cast on a Firestorm Phoenix, the order that
    the two triggered effects resolves in decides if you can choose the
    Phoenix to be returned by Reincarnation or if it will already be in your
    hand and cannot be chosen. [Aahz 06/14/96]

  Spell fizzles if there are no creatures in the graveyard (this is possible

@{b}Relentless Assault@{ub}

  A creature that must attack each turn, must only attack once that turn.  It
    is not forced into each attack that turn. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

  If a creature becomes forced to attack by an ability such as the Norrit,
    it must attack in the next available attack.  Once it attacks once, it
    removes all "your must attack" restrictions of existing effects on it.
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

  If a spell or ability can only be played "before the attack", it can be
    played after this spell is played because it is now before another attack.
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

  If a creature has a cost that must be paid in order to attack or block, it 
    need only pay once to attack in any other attacks that turn. 
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  This is true even if the wording on the card
    makes it sound otherwise.

  Abilities that trigger when a creature attacks, blocks, or is blocked will
    trigger during each combat that turn.  Thus, a creature with Rampage will
    get the bonus added during each attack. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

@node ROCHY "Rock Hydra"

@{b}Rock Hydra@{ub}

  Losing a head is considered to be damage prevention.  So it the payment of
    one red mana.  So, in either case, the damage gets prevented and does not
    accumulate. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]  This translates to letting 
    you prevent damage by paying R or paying one head counter.  You cannot 
    end the first sub-step of damage prevention with unprevented damage if 
    the Hydra has any heads left. [D'Angelo 11/15/95]

  Since the Hydra loses heads due to damage before accumulating damage
    points, instants like Giant Growth are not totally useful with a Rock
    Hydra.  A Hydra with 4 heads and a Giant Growth is 7/7, but after
    taking 4 damage (without paying the mana to keep the heads) it will
    lose all of its heads and die once the Giant Growth wears off.
    [bethmo]

  When it dies it "forgets" how many heads it had, so Resurrection, Animate
    Dead and other cards which pull out of the graveyard result in a 0/0
    creature.  This creature will only live if its toughness is increased
    by something like Castle. [PPG Page 92]

  Note that once a spell is in play, any X is considered to be zero when
    calculating its casting cost.  [PPG Page 56]  This means that
    Metamorphosis on a Hydra gives only 3 mana.

  You can spend more red mana than there is damage to prevent if you do it all
    in one spell stack.  In other words two uses of the pay R to prevent a
    point of damage can target the same point of damage.  The second one to
    resolve will fizzle. [D'Angelo 11/21/95]

  If damage to a Rock Hydra is unpreventable (i.e. Whippoorwill or Lava
    Burst), you cannot spend R to prevent damage or remove heads to prevent 
    damage.  This is a rare case where the Rock Hydra can end damage
    prevention with damage and heads. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]

  The Alpha printing version of this card had 'R's where the red mana
    symbols are on all further printings.
