  Wizards  of  the  Coast  understands that many of you were surprised by the
  quantity and selection of cards from the Arabian Nights(R), Antiquities(R),
  Legends(TM),  and  The  Dark(TM) expansion sets that we reprinted in Magic:
  The  Gathering-Fourth  Edition(TM)  and  Chronicles(TM).  We have therefore
  created this Magic:  The Gathering(R) Card Reprint Policy to explain why we
  choose  to  reprint  cards and how many cards from which expansion sets you
  can expect to see reprinted in future Magic products.

@node WHY_REPRINT "Why Magic Cards Are Reprinted"

                         @{b}Why Magic Cards Are Reprinted@{ub}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Magic:   The  Gathering  has  tremendous  appeal  both  as  a game and as a
  collectible;  however,  Wizards  of  the  Coast  is  a game company, and we
  believe  that  Magic  is  first and foremost a supreme game of strategy and
  skill.   We  choose to reprint certain cards from limited expansion sets in
  products  like  Fourth  Edition  and Chronicles because we believe that the
  cards  we  reprint  make  for  enjoyable  game  play and that Magic players
  deserve an opportunity to play with these cards.

  Wizards  of the Coast understands that Magic also appeals to many of you as
  a collectible.  For this reason, it has always been our policy to print any
  card with a new card power in black border before or at the same time as it
  is  printed  in white border.  It has also been our policy never to reprint
  in  black  border a previously published Magic card using identical art and
  card  power.  The purpose of these policies was to make the black-bordered,
  limited edition versions of Magic cards as collectible as possible.

  We have discovered, however, that, in addition to the limited nature of our
  black-bordered  products,  much  of  the  collectibility of a Magic card is
  determined  by  its  availability  for game-play purposes.  Accordingly, we
  have  decided to expand on our previous policies by creating a new category
  of  cards, called "Reserved Cards," that we will never print again in black
  or white border in game-functionally identical form.

                                @{b}Reserved Cards@{ub}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As  mentioned  above,  "Reserved  Cards" are cards that we will never print
  again  in  black  or white border in game-functionally identical form.  For
  this purpose, a card is game-functionally identical if it has the same card
  power  and  casting  cost  as another card.  Note that the exclusion of any
  particular  card from the Reserved Card list does not indicate that we have
  any plans to reprint that card.

  The current list of Reserved Cards includes:  (1) all cards from Alpha/Beta
  Editions  that  do  not  appear  in  Fourth Edition or Ice Age(TM); (2) all
  uncommon  and  rare cards from Arabian Nights and Antiquities that have not
  yet been reprinted in white border (i.e., that do not appear in Revised(TM)
  [Third  Edition],  Fourth  Edition,  or Chronicles); and (3) all rare cards
  from Legends and The Dark that have not yet been reprinted in white border.
  Appended  to this Magic:  The Gathering(R) Card Reprint Policy is a current
  list of all Reserved Cards.

@node REPRINTING "Reprinting Cards"

         @{b}Reprinting Cards from Fallen Empires and Subsequent Products@{ub}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In  order  to create products that are enjoyable for Magic players, Wizards
  of  the  Coast  may  reprint  cards  from  the  Fallen  Empires,  Ice  Age,
  Homelands(TM), and subsequent limited expansion sets, as well as cards from
  Chronicles.   In  order  to  maintain the collectibility of these products,
  however,  Wizards of the Coast will reprint in white border no more than 25
  percent  of  the  rarest  cards  from  Chronicles,  Fallen  Empires, or any
  subsequent  limited expansion set.  At least 75 percent of the rarest cards
  from  each  of  these sets will never be reprinted in either black or white
  border.   For this purpose, the rarest cards from a given expansion set are
  all  of  those  cards  that  appear with the lowest frequency on the rarest
  press  sheet used to print that expansion (i.e., cards from Fallen Empires,
  Chronicles,  and  Homelands  designated "Uncommon 1" and cards from Ice Age
  designated  "Rare  1"  in  The  Duelist (TM) magazine's cardlists for these
  sets).

  In conjunction with the release of each new edition of the basic game, such
  as  Fifth  Edition, we will announce which sets were considered eligible to
  have cards from them rotated into the basic game.  Any rare card from those
  sets  not  rotated  into the basic game at that time will become a Reserved
  Card  and  thus  will  never  be  printed again in black or white border in
  game-functionally identical form.

@node NON_ENGLISH "Non-English-Language Editions"

                         @{b}Non-English-Language Editions@{ub}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note  that  the  foregoing  policies  apply  both  to  English-language and
  non-English-language  cards.   The  only  exception to this is that special
  considerations  which  arise  when commencing publication of Magic in a new
  language  may  force  us  to  publish  some  cards  in that new language in
  white-border   form  (e.g.,  as  part  of  Fourth  Edition)  without  first
  publishing all of those cards in that new language in black-border form.

  In  addition,  note  that the Arabian Nights, Antiquities, Legends, and The
  Dark  expansion  sets will not be printed in black- or white-border form in
  any  additional  languages, although cards from these expansion sets may be
  printed  in  additional languages in black- or white-border form as part of
  non-English-language editions of the basic game or Chronicles.  Chronicles,
  Fallen  Empires,  and  subsequent  limited expansion sets may be printed in
  black   border   in  additional  languages.   Wizards  of  the  Coast  will
  periodically  announce  when  any  of these products are being removed from
  consideration for reprinting in additional languages.

  non-standard versions of cards for sale or promotional use, such as factory
