@node WALKW "Walking Wall"

@{b}Walking Wall@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...control.  You cannot spend more than three
    mana in this way each turn." [Encyclopedia Page 101]

  See the @{"Activation Cost" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_ACTI} entry in the General Rulings for more information
    on what "once a turn" means.

  The ability to allow it to attack only overrides the rule that a Wall cannot
    attack but it does not override summoning sickness or allow any other
    kind of illegal attack. [Duelist Magazine #7, Page 9]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_ARTIFACT.guide/WALKI}

@endnode
@node WALCA "Wall of Caltrops"

@{b}Wall of Caltrops@{ub}

  As a clarification, the card works as if it read "If Wall of Caltrops, at 
    least one other wall, and no non-wall creatures are assigned to block an 
    attacker, Wall of Caltrops gains banding until end of turn." 
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  The bonus is gained at the end of the Declare Blockers step of the attack
    if the criteria is met. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_WHITE.guide/WOCAL}

@endnode
@node WALDU "Wall of Dust"

@{b}Wall of Dust@{ub}

  A creature blocked by this card is marked with a "cannot attack next turn"
    effect when this card is assigned to block it.  A creature is also marked
    if it is blocked by any means, including being part of a band which is
    blocked or by being moved into being blocked by an effect such as General
    Jarkeld.  The effect is not removed if the creature is removed from the
    blocking situation by an effect like General Jarkeld.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  As errata to the Legends version, read "your opponent" as "its controller".
    [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_RED.guide/WODUS}

@endnode
@node WALFI "Wall of Fire"

@{b}Wall of Fire@{ub}

  As errata, the Revised Edition version should have "until end of turn"
    added to its ability. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_RED.guide/WALFI}

@endnode
@node WALSH "Wall of Shadows"

@{b}Wall of Shadows@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Damage dealt to Wall of Shadows by creatures it
    is blocking is reduced to 0.  Wall of Shadows cannot be the target of
    spells or effects that can target only walls." [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  As errata, the Chronicles version should have the Legends symbol and not
    the Antiquities symbol on it. [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  By the original wording, once a creature was blocked by the Wall, the
    creature could not damage the wall for the remainder of that turn.  Under
    the new wording, the creature cannot damage the wall by any means during
    the combat.  If an Instill Energy was on an attacking Prodigal Sorcerer,
    and the Sorcerer untapped after attacking and being blocked by the Wall,
    if it tried to poke the Wall before the end of combat, the damage would
    reduced to zero. [D'Angelo 09/25/95]

  Can be destroyed by a Battering Ram because combat effects are not
    targeted. [Page 63]

  It is not affected by the Golgothian Sylex. [D'Angelo 08/16/95]
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/WOSHA}

@node WALSP "Wall of Spears"

@{b}Wall of Spears@{ub}

  The card says "Counts as a wall" and it means that it is a Wall in all
    ways. [bethmo 05/03/94]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/WALLO}

@endnode
@node WALTO "Wall of Tombstones"

@{b}Wall of Tombstones@{ub}

  See @{"Creature in the Graveyard" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_CGRA} in the General Rulings for more information.

  When first brought into play, * is zero. [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 9]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLACK.guide/WOTOM}

@endnode
@node WALVA "Wall of Vapor"

@{b}Wall of Vapor@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Damage dealt to Wall of Vapor by creatures it
    is blocking is reduced to 0." [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  By the original wording, once a creature was blocked by the Wall, the
    creature could not damage the wall for the remainder of that turn.  Under
    the new wording, the creature cannot damage the wall by any means during
    the combat.  If an Instill Energy was on an attacking Prodigal Sorcerer,
    and the Sorcerer untapped after attacking and being blocked by the Wall,

    reduced to zero. [D'Angelo 09/25/95]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLUE.guide/WOVAP}

@endnode
@node WALWA "Wall of Water"

@{b}Wall of Water@{ub}

  As errata, the Revised Edition version should add "until end of turn" to the
    ability. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]  All other versions are correct.
 
@endnode
@node WALWO "Wall of Wonder"

@{b}Wall of Wonder@{ub}

  As errata, the Legends version should add "until end of turn" to the 
    ability. [WotC Rules Team 09/22/95]

  Paying to make the Wall capable of attacking does not override the normal
    rule that a creature may not attack unless it began your turn in play.
    [Duelist Magazine #2, Page 9]

  You can apply the +4/-4 bonus as many times as you have mana to pay for it. 
    Of course if it does not have enough toughness, it'll die. [Aahz 06/16/94]

 @{" Card Information " link LG_BLUE.guide/WOWON}

@endnode
@node WANDI "Wand of Ith"

@{b}Wand of Ith@{ub}

  Any X in the casting cost of a spell is zero for purposes of the Wand.
    [Aahz 08/10/94]  

  The card is picked during resolution of this effect.  [D'Angelo 02/01/95]
    This gives the player a chance to cast any instant speed spells prior
    to having a random card selected from their hand.

 @{" Card Information " link DK_ARTIFACT.guide/WANDO}

@endnode
@node WARDO "Ward of Light"

@{b}Ward of Light@{ub}

+ See "Play as a..." in the General Rulings for more information.

 @{" Card Information " link MI_WHITE.guide/WARD_}

@endnode
@node WARPA "Warp Artifact"

@{b}Warp Artifact@{ub}

  The Limited and Unlimited edition versions of this card says it does damage
    "at the start of each turn".  It means "each of the controller's turns".
    [D'Angelo 04/29/96]

 @{" Card Information " link 4E_BLACK.guide/WARPA}

@endnode
@node WATWU "Water Wurm"

@{b}Water Wurm@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "As long as any opponent controls at least one
    island, Water Wurm gets +0/+1." [Encyclopedia Page 175]

  Only gets the bonus once even if more than one opponent has an Island in
    play. [Aahz 12/25/94]

 @{" Card Information " link DK_BLUE.guide/WATER}

@endnode
@node WAVEO "Wave of Terror"

@{b}Wave of Terror@{ub}

  As errata, it should say "total casting cost", not just "casting cost".
    [Aahz 06/17/97]

  Will not kill 0 cost creatures. [bethmo 06/12/97]

  Only kills creatures with an exact cost of N, not N or less (where N is
    the last paid cumulative upkeep). [bethmo 06/12/97]

 @{" Card Information " link WL_BLACK.guide/WAVEO}

@endnode
@node WEAKS "Weakstone"

@{b}Weakstone@{ub}

  As errata, the card is of type "Artifact" and not "Continuous Artifact".
    [Encyclopedia Page 137]

  The -1/-0 applies to attacking creatures from all players. [Aahz]

 @{" Card Information " link AQ_ARTIFACT.guide/WEAKS}

@endnode
@node WELLS "Wellspring"

@{b}Wellspring@{ub}

  The control gain happens just before the beginning of untap. [Aahz 09/20/96]

  If the land is animated, you get it without summoning sickness.
    [Aahz 10/01/96]

  The "lose control" effect just removes the all "gain control" effects made
    by this card, not any "gain control" effects on the card from other
    sources. [Aahz 03/17/97]

 @{" Card Information " link MI_GOLD.guide/WELLS}

@endnode
@node WHEEL "Wheel of Fortune"

@{b}Wheel of Fortune@{ub}

  This is a discard and so Library of Leng can be used.
    [D'Angelo 07/13/95]

  Applies to all players in multiplayer games. [Duelist Magazine #4, Page 64]

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Classic (Type I) tournaments since 03/23/94.  Was on the
    Standard (Type II) restricted list until 05/02/95 when it became banned
    because it is not in the current edition of The Gathering.  Has always
    been banned from Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) and Extended tournaments.

  Trample damage is not prevented by Whippoorwill because Whippoorwill does
    not affect automatic damage redirection. [Aahz 11/07/96]
 
 @{" Card Information " link DK_GREEN.guide/WHIPP}

@node WICKE "Wicked Reward"

@{b}Wicked Reward@{ub}

  The sacrifice of a creature is part of the casting cost and is paid on
    announcement.  You do not have a choice to pay this cost zero times or
    more than one time in order to multiply the effect. [D'Angelo 01/28/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_BLACK.guide/WICKE}

@endnode
@node WIITI "Wiitigo"

@{b}Wiitigo@{ub}

  As errata, it should say "Wiitigo comes into play with six...".
    [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  Otherwise, it would die before the "comes
    into play" trigger got dealt with.

  The last sentence about ignoring the effect applies to the entire card.
    Once it runs out of counters, it can never gain or lose counters again.
    [Duelist Magazine #10, Page 43]

  Only the +1/+1 counters he gives himself work for the ability.  You cannot
    use externally gathered +1/+1 counters. [Aahz 07/24/95]

 @{" Card Information " link IA_GREEN.guide/WIITI}

@endnode
@node WILDG "Wild Growth"

@{b}Wild Growth@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "Whenever enchanted land is tapped for mana, it
    produces an additional (G)." [Encyclopedia Page 49]

  The mana is provided when the triggered ability resolves.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 29]  (REVERSAL)  It used to actually modify 
    the mana generating effect to make more mana.

  Before the errata, the Limited and Unlimited versions of this card had the
    land provide the mana no matter how it is tapped.  This includes tapping 
    it for mana, tapping to attack (as with a Living Land) or tapping it with
    Twiddle. The Revised, Fourth Edition and Ice Age versions of this card had
    the enchantment provide the mana only when the land is tapped for mana and
    that makes it useless on lands that do not normally provide mana.

  Before the errata, the Limited and Unlimited versions of this had the land
    provide the mana, so the land's controller gets the mana.  The Fourth 
    Edition and Ice Age versions had the enchantment provide the mana, so the
    controller of the enchantment (and not the land) got the mana.  The 
    Revised Edition one is unclear, so was assumed to follow the Limited and 
    Unlimited Edition one.

@node WINDS "Winds of Change"

@{b}Winds of Change@{ub}

  The number of cards you "originally" had is the number of cards in your hand
    when this spell is resolved, and not when it it cast.  In other words, if
    you start with 7 cards, cast Winds of Change, and then cast 5 other
    instants in the same batch, then you will get 1 new card and not 6 or 7.

    not deal or receive damage and it will be destroyed at end of combat.

@node WOODE "Wood Elemental"

@{b}Wood Elemental@{ub}

  You do not choose how many forests to sacrifice until it enters play.
    [D'Angelo 11/21/95]

  The *'s are equal to the number of Forests sacrificed when the creature
    is brought into play.  This includes Clone, Doppelganger, Animate Dead,
    or Resurrection.  In all these cases Forests need to be sacrificed.
    [bethmo 06/25/94]

  A creature leaving Oubliette or Tawnos's Coffin does not cause "comes
    into play" effects to happen again so it will not require a sacrifice
    in those cases. [Aahz 07/05/95]

  A Doppelganger switching forms to a Wood Elemental will not require a
    sacrifice.  [Aahz 07/05/95]

  The Forests are sacrificed as a triggered effect just after the Elemental
    enters play.  This means you can use Magical Hack to change the land type
    which needs to be sacrificed. [D'Angelo 10/27/95]  The change must be made
    during casting.  Using Magical Hack once it is in play accomplishes
    nothing. [bethmo 09/22/94]

  May sacrifice lands that count as a forest. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

@node WORDC "Word of Command"

@{b}Word of Command@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "You may look at target player's hand and choose
    any card that player can legally play using mana from his or her mana pool
    or lands.  That player must play this card immediately; you make all the
    decisions it calls for.  This spell may not be countered after you have
    looked at the player's hand. [Encyclopedia Page 208]

  The caster of Word of Command controls all aspects of the spell they
    have the opponent cast, including the amount of mana and target of the 
    spell.  Note that if the spell just enables something, you cannot power
    it in addition to casting it.  For example, you cannot cast Pestilence
    then tap additional mana to power the card, or summon a Nether Shadow
    and declare an attack with it.  Spells with an X casting cost have X
    decided by the player. [WotC Rules Team 01/24/94]  The decisions apply
    to ones made on announcement and ones made on resolution. 
    [D'Angelo 04/11/95]

  Since casting this spell is an action, your opponent gets a chance to cast
    interrupts and instants in response to your spell.  Once the current
    batch of effects it is in is resolved, then you can look at your 
    opponent's hand.  Note that if damage occurs during this instant, it must
    be resolved before the Commanded spell. [bethmo 05/18/94]  It is standard
    practice to use up any spells or mana you can before letting your
    opponent at your hand.

  Your opponent cannot counter the Word of Command once they let you look at 
    his hand, but they can attempt to counter the spell you force them to
    cast. [WotC rules team 01/24/94]

  You must order your opponent to cast a spell or play a land if it is 
    possible to do so.  [Card Text]

  The spell which is cast is considered as being cast by the player
    targeted by Word of Command and not by the caster of Word of Command.
    [Arab FAQ 01/05/94]

  The words "legally cast" are there to remind you that you are ordering the
    player to cast something and you can't make them cast something that 
    they could not have legally cast at that time on their own.  So no
    summonings unless it is their main phase, etc. [D'Angelo 08/11/95]

  The spell cast under Word of Command is cast during the resolution of
    Word of Command and it resolves immediately without any chance to
    respond with other effects.  Once that spell resolves, the current batch
    of effects continues to resolve. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]  (REVERSAL)
    The spell used to start the next batch of spells/abilities.

  The spell being cast by Word of Command's effect can be interrupted as
    normal.  It just is being cast at an unusual time which does not allow
    non-interrupt responses. [D'Angelo 03/26/97]

  Only spells/abilities that would be legal for the player to start a batch
    with during the current phase are legal. [WotC Rules Team 03/14/97]

  Only land and mana pool are available to the caster.  Other sources of
    mana are not allowed.

  You do get to choose which lands get tapped. [bethmo]  This means you can
    choose ones with Psychic Venom or other bad effects on them, but does
    not allow you to tap a wrong amount (or color) of mana (possibly causing 
    mana burn) if there is a possible way to tap the right amount of mana.  
    For example, if one Forest and one Forest with Wild Growth are available,
    you may not use the one with Wild Growth to cast Giant Growth  (cost
    'G'). [Aahz]  You can make them choose an optional mana generating 
    ability of the land that is tapped, such as making them sacrifice a
    Dwarven Ruins. [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]

  You may Command your opponent to play a land (if they have not already
    done so this turn).  [Aahz]

  With Channel, the amount of mana converted is not a decision in the
    casting of the spell.  [WotC Rules Team 01/24/94]

  You cannot announce a Word of Command between someone tapping mana for
    a spell and them announcing the spell. [Aahz 07/09/95]  

  If used with a Demonic Tutor being the card the other player casts, you
    do not get to look through that player's library.  You get to name a card
    for them to take.  If it is in the library, they take it.  If not, you
    name another card.  Repeat until you name one that they have.
    [D'Angelo 04/11/95]  Remember that even on-resolution decisions are made
    by the Word of Command caster.

  If there is a non-mana way to cast a spell, as with Pitch Spells, you may
    require that way to be used if it is possible to do so.

  A land which is somehow put into a Safe Haven will leave the game forever
