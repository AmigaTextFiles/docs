                 @{b}Why are certain cards restricted or banned ?@{ub}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As  the  number  of cards on the Restricted and Banned lists for Duelists'
  Convocation's  tournament  rules  continues  to  grow, so do the questions
  regarding why individual cards appear on these lists.  Though most reasons
  are  obvious,  many  people  are  unaware of the more specific reasons why
  cards  become  restricted or banned.  There are a number of signs that the
  DC looks for when deciding to restrict or ban a given card.

  The  most  obvious  sign  is that the card appears as a central theme of a
  winning tourney deck.  When all tournament decks begin to look alike, it's
  time for a change.

  Other  cards  are so useful that there is no reason not to include them in
  any  deck.   Often,  powerful artifacts are restricted for this reason, as
  they  can  be integrated into any kind of deck.  The Moxes and Black Lotus
  are  examples  of these kind of cards, and Black Vise is a recent addition
  to the Restricted list due to this problem.

  Of  course,  all  cards  dealing  with  ante have been banned, as official
  constructed-deck  tournaments  are  never played for ante.  These are good
  examples  of cards that are prohibited in tournaments not because they are
  spoilers, but rather because they are not appropriate for tournament-style
  play.  Other cards also fall into this category, Sharazad, for example.

  Most  "retrieval"  cards  have found their way onto the Restricted list as
  well.   Themselves  rather  harmless,  they  allow  for  the  reuse of the
  spoilers, thus justifying their restriction.  In deck-construction systems
  where  the  spoilers  are completely banned, sometimes the retrieval cards
  are left unrestricted.

  A  number  of the cards on the Restricted and Banned lists don't fall into
  any  particular  category.   They are cards that, for whatever reason, are
  just  too  powerful  either alone or in combination with one or more other
  cards.

  As new cards are created, the list will continue to grow, though with care
  in  card  design  it will grow more slowely than it has in the past.  Ante
  cards  aside,  only two cards from the last four expansions have had to be
  restricted.  This has been by design, and hopefully future expansions will
  fare as well.

@node R_ANCES "Ancestral Recall"

@{b}Ancestral Recall@{ub}

The  ability  to  draw  cards  has  proved  to be one of the most
powerful effects in Magic, and Ancestral Recall allows its caster
to  draw  cards  at  a  much  lower  cost than any other spell or
effect.  Therefor it has way too much firepower for its cost.

@node R_BALAN "Balance"

@{b}Balance@{ub}

Balance decks began dominating tournaments in mid-1995 to such an
extent  that  the  card  had  to  be  restricted.  A player could
oblirate  his  or her own resources (usually sacrificing them for
gain) and then cast Balance to make the opponent pay for the very
temporary  advantage.   As  a  result,  good tourney decks had to
prepare  to  play against Balance.  Also, for its mass effect, it
is way too cheap.

@{b}Interesting  note@{ub}:  It took players over a year to figure out how
to  break  this  card,  proving  that  restriction  rests  on the
players'   actions.   Cards  are  restricted  only  when  players
demonstrate the necessity of doing so.

Berserk's effect of doubling a creature's power quickly proved to

Any  time  a card produces more mana than is required to bring it
into  play,  there  is  an opportunity for abuse, and the cheaper
that  card is to cast, the greater that opportunity.  In no other
case  is  this more apparent than with Black Lotus.  This was the
main  ingredient  in  many  of  Magic's  original first-turn kill
decks,  and it is still a staple card for all people who have one
to play with.

Black  Vise is a card so generally effective that many tournament

what  the  deck's  theme  or  purpose  was.   The damage it could
potentially   inflict  if  played  on  the  first  turn  was  too
attractive to ignore.  Since all decks had to plan for them, they
completely dominated the Type II tournament landscape.

Fastbond   (Revised)   has   occupied   a   spot   on  the  DCI's

Channel   in   its   ability   to   create  grossly  overpowered,
game-winning combinations.  This is most obvious when Fastbond is
used  in  conjunction with Storm Cauldron, effectively creating a
Channel for colored mana, with preventable damage.

@node R_HYMNT "Hymn to Tourach"

@{b}Hymn to Tourach@{ub}

Hymn  to  Tourach from Fallen Empires has been the center of more
controversy  than any other single card throughout the later half
of  the  1995-96 tournament season.  Competitors began to suggest
its  restriction  shortly  after  the first Pro Tour event in New
York,  primarily  because  the  card  was  seen  by  many  as the
cornerstone of the popular and successful "Necro" deck.  Many DCI
members  expected  its  restriction  on June 1 but were surprised
when  the  DCI  decided  to  restrict  Land  Tax  but not Hymn to
Tourach.

The  DCI  explained that, at that time, it lacked sufficient data
on  Hymn's  true  influence  in the Standard (Type II) tournament
environment.    Necro   decks  had  barely  started  to  dominate
tournaments, and Alliances had not yet been released, giving rise
to  the  possibility  that new card combinations and deck designs
would  emerge  to  challenge  Necro  decks.  Moreover, the actual
cause  of  Necro's  success  was still open to speculation:  Some
competitors  claimed  it  was  the result of several other cards,
while  others  theorized  that  it was due to the sheer number of
competitors (particularly top-ranked players) who used the deck.

The conclusion of the 1995-96 season and the release of Alliances
gives the DCI more information on which to base a decision.  Hymn
to  Tourach's  impact  is  more  readily  visible:  One need only
recall  the  semifinal match at the 1996 U.S.  Nationals, between
Dennis  Bentley  and  Matthew  Place  to witness the Hymn's early
game-swing advantage, as well as its strong ability to stifle new
deck-construction ideas.

@{b}Underworld Dreams@{ub}

Dealing  damage  for  each  card  your  opponent draws is good by
itself,  but  in  multiples it is devastating.  If accompanied by
Howling  Mine  and other cheap "force your opponent to draw" type
cards, Underworld Dreams can prove nearly unbeatable.

@{b}Wheel of Fortune@{ub}

As  with  Timetwister,  drawing  cards  equals  restrictio.  Even
though  Wheel  of Fortune affects everyone, the caster gains huge
advantage in casting it when it benefits him or her the most.

@node R_ZURAN "Zuran Orb"

@{b}Zuran Orb@{ub}

Much  like  Ivory  Tower's  ability,  the  Zuran Orb's ability to
create  a  lot  of life makes tournament games drag on far longer
than  is acceptable.  The Orb was so generally useful that two or
three  were  immediately  added to most winning tournament decks.
Even  restricted, it still finds its way into most tourney decks,
extending many games, especially Type I duels.

@node B_CHANN "Channel"

@{b}Channel@{ub}

A long-time resident of the Restricted list, Channel was added to
the Banned list in November 1995.  As one-half of the instant-win
combo  Channel-Fireball,  it  turned  the  game into a simplistic
"Whoever  draws  their  Channel  first  wins"  affair.   Although
Channel   has   other   uses,   the   potential  for  abuse  with
direct-damage  spells  is too great to allow the card to remain a
part of tournament play.

@node B_CHAOS "Chaos Orb"

@{b}Chaos Orb@{ub}

Banned less for what it does than for how it does it, Chaos Orb's
unusual  mechanic of being "flipped" onto the playing area caused
so  much  trouble that the card had to be banned.  Issues ranging
from  what  exactly  "flip"  means, to how large the playing area
needs can be, to what things could be used to represent counters,
caused  constant  conflicts  regarding the card's use.  Chaos Orb
was moved from the Restricted list to the Banned list in November
1995.

@{b}Divine Intervention@{ub}

Draws  are  traditionally  undesirable  in  competive events, and
Divine  Intervention's sole effect is to create them.  Also, in a
tournament  setting a single card should not have such a dramatic
influence on the outcome of the game.

@node B_MINDT "Mind Twist"

@{b}Mind Twist@{ub}

This  card  was  banned  primarily  because of the major swing it
causes  in  early game play.  As with effects that allow a player
to  draw  extra cards, hand-destruction can be overly disruptive.
A  player on the Net described it like this:  "Mind Twist is just
like  Channel,  only  with  Mind  Twist, it takes you a number of
turns before you realize that it killed you."

@node B_SHARA "Sharazad"

@{b}Sharazad@{ub}

One of the most unique cards in the game of Magic, Sharazad isn't
banned  because  of what it does but because of how long it takes
to  play  it.   There  is  seldom  time  in a tournament round to
resolve  a  Sharazad subgame, and allowing this card would result
in an unacceptable number of draws.
