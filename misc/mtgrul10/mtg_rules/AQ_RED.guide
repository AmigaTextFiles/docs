          opponent calls heads or tails while coin is in the air. If the
          flip ends up in your favor, draw a card. Otherwise, counter your
          artifact spell. More than one Goblin Artisans ability cannot
          target the same artifact spell.

Text(AQ): You may tap Goblin Artisans as you cast an artifact. Then flip a
          coin; opponent calls heads or tails while coin is in the air. If
          the flip ends up in opponent's favor, your artifact is countered.
          Otherwise, draw another card from your library. You can only use
          this ability once for each time you cast an artifact.
