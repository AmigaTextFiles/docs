@node FALLE "The Fallen"

@{b}The Fallen@{ub}

  Will not damage the controller, only opponents of the controller.  So, if
    you managed to take control of someone else's The Fallen after being
    damaged by it, you will not be damaged. [Aahz 02/08/95]  Unlike Black
    Vice which targets only when it is cast, this card actually chooses 
    players each upkeep and will not choose an illegal player.

  The effect is not cumulative.  If a player is hit more than once, they 
    still only take one damage from The Fallen each turn.

  This card is not targeted and so it cannot be redirected. [Aahz 08/15/95]

  It stops damaging players and forgets which players it damaged when it 
    leaves play. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 35]

  If put into an Oubliette or Tawnos's Coffin it will not forget which players
    it damaged. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]  Same for phasing out.

@endnode
@node FALAN "Fallen Angel"

@{b}Fallen Angel@{ub}

  You can sacrifice as many creatures as you want to the Angel at any time
    that fast effects are allowed. [Aahz 06/14/94]  One sacrifice per
    activation.

  Can sacrifice itself. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 123]

  The Chronicles version is done as an activation cost and the Legends version
    is not.  But both versions sacrifice the creature as a cost.
    [D'Angelo 06/28/96]

@node FALAS "Fallen Askari"

@{b}Fallen Askari@{ub}

  Cannot be given the ability to block by something like Web or Spider Climb.
    Those abilities do not remove the general inabilty to block.
    [Visions FAQ 02/16/97]

 @{" Card Information " link VI_BLACK.guide/FALLE}

@node FALST "Falling Star"

@{b}Falling Star@{ub}

  It must flip like a coin and not like a frisbee. [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Only cards touched when it stops moving are affected.  Not ones touched
    while it is moving. [Aahz 06/16/94]

  Has been on the Duelist Convocation banned list (not allowed in decks)
    Type I tournaments since 11/01/95.  It was on the Type I restricted
    list (only 1 per deck) for tournaments from 08/01/94 to 11/01/95.  Has
    always been banned from Type I.5 tournaments.
 
 @{" Card Information " link LG_RED.guide/FALLI}

@endnode
@node FALDE "False Demise"

@{b}False Demise@{ub}

  Since False Demise's effect follows the standard timing rules for triggered 
    effects, if both players have False Demise on the same creature, then the 
    player whose turn it is when the creature goes to the graveyard will get 
    it.  The other False Demise effect will fizzle. 
    [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32]

  Token creatures are removed from the game prior to False Demise's triggered
    effect resolving.  [Duelist Magazine #12, Page 32] The continuous effect 
    of removing tokens is "faster" than triggered effects.

 @{" Card Information " link AI_BLUE.guide/FALSE}

@endnode
@node FALSE "False Orders"

@{b}False Orders@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...legally make.  Play at the end of the 'choose
    defense' step of combat." [Encyclopedia Page 57]  It is used after all
    blocker assignments are made but before any effects due to assignment of
    blockers take place.  This is considered a change to the blocking
    assignment. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 47]

  "defending creature" should be read as "a creature the defending player
    controls." [D'Angelo 08/11/95]

  Can only give legal orders to a creature.  If your opponent could not
    make the choice on their own, False Orders cannot make them do it.
    [bethmo]

  You cannot use this spell to make a creature not block a Lured creature
    because that is not a legal action. [bethmo]

  You cannot use this spell to add a creature to block or to remove a creature
    from blocking when Goblin War Drums is in effect, unless the resulting
    block is still legal. [Aahz 01/27/95]

  If a creature is removed from being a blocker of a given attacker, any
    effects on the creatures that would have happened because it was declared
    as a blocker do not happen. [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 47]

  If a creature is added as a blocker to a given attacker, any effects on
    the creatures that would happen due to this, do happen.
    [Duelist Magazine #8, Page 47]

+ Since this is used after triggered abilities from attacking or blocking, you
    cannot use it on a creature which is removed from play (such as a creature
    that phased out when it blocked a Dream Fighter) since that creature is
    not in play to target with this spell. [bethmo 08/26/97]

@node FARMS "Farmstead"

@{b}Farmstead@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(W)(W): Enchanted land's controller gains 1 life.
    Use this ability only during your upkeep and only once each turn."
    [Encyclopedia Page 53]

  Note that the controller of the enchantment is the only one that can pay
    the cost, but the controller of the land is the one that gets the life
    point. [WotC Rules Team 10/12/94]

  It is used on the controller of Farmstead's upkeep and not the controller
    of the land's upkeep unless they are the same person. 
    [WotC Rules Team 06/15/95]

 @{" Card Information " link 3E_WHITE.guide/FARMS}

@endnode
@node FAPRI "Farrelite Priest"

@{b}Farrelite Priest@{ub}

  As errata, play the effect as a mana source. [Mirage Page 2]

  Mana which "changes color" as it goes through the Priest forgets its
    original source because the old mana gets used up and new mana gets 
    generated. [Aahz 01/24/95]

 @{" Card Information " link FE_WHITE.guide/FARPR}

@endnode
@node FAMAN "Farrel's Mantle"

@{b}Farrel's Mantle@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "...enchants.  If it does do, it deals no damage
    to defending player this turn." [Encyclopedia Page 181]

  See the @{"Is Not Blocked" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_INBL} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  This enchantment gives the creature the ability to deal damage, and
    therefore the damage is considered to come from the creature and not from
    the enchantment. [Aahz 12/02/94]  Creatures like Sengir Vampire that get
    credit for damaging a creature get credit when using the Mantle.
    [D'Angelo 01/18/95]

  The creature's controller (not the enchantment's controller) gets to use
    the ability.  If put on an opponent's creature, you don't make decisions
    about it.  [WotC Rules Team 12/15/94]

  A creature can use the abilities of two Mantles. [D'Angelo 10/01/96]

 @{" Card Information " link FE_WHITE.guide/FARMA}

@endnode
@node FAZEA "Farrel's Zealot"

@{b}Farrel's Zealot@{ub}

  As errata, is should read "...creature.  If you do so, it deals no damage to
    defending player this turn." [Encyclopedia Page 181]

  See the @{"Is Not Blocked" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_INBL} entry in the General Rulings for more information.

  In a multiplayer game, the target creature does not need to be one of the
    ones controlled by the player you actually attacked.

 @{" Card Information " link FE_WHITE.guide/FARZE}

@endnode
@node FASTB "Fastbond"

@{b}Fastbond@{ub}

  You can only play land cards when it would otherwise be legal to play a
    land.  This means only on your turn during your main phase.
    [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  Playing a land is not a fast effect, so they must be played out one at a
    time.  Only the restriction to one land per turn was removed.  Lands are
    still played the same way they normally are. [Aahz 12/21/94]

  You take damage whether you play a land using Fastbond's effect or using
    any other effect like Gaea's Touch or Eureka. [bethmo 09/20/94]

    Also, the extra lands that Storm Cauldron allows. [bethmo 06/20/96]

  Land put into play by Thawing Glaciers or a similar effect will not cause
    you damage. [Aahz 11/15/96]  In these case you do not 'play' the land.

  If you have two in play, you take 2 damage per land played.
    [bethmo 04/11/96]

+ Has been on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck)
    for Classic (Type I) and Classic-Restricted (Type I.5) tournaments
    since 10/01/96.  Has always been banned (none allowed in a deck) from
    Extended tournaments.

@node FASTI "Fasting"

@{b}Fasting@{ub}

  See @{"Phase Skipping" link MTG_GEN_RULINGS.guide/TOP_PHAS} in the General Rulings.

  As errata, it is buried (not destroyed) when you draw a card or when it has
    5 counters on it.  [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  This effect requires a payment of skipping your draw phase.  You cannot
    use multiple effects that require such a payment, so you cannot use two
    Fastings in the same turn. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]

  Can only be used during upkeep.  You cannot use it during your draw phase 
    to skip the rest of it. [WotC Rules Team 10/18/95]  Can be used at any
    time during upkeep. [Aahz 01/16/96]

  Note that using this spell causes you to skip your draw phase entirely,
    so it cannot be used in combination with draw phase effects like
    Island Sanctuary or Howling Mine. [bethmo 08/10/94]

  It can be used with Necropotence since this is used before the draw phase
    and Necropotence happens right as the draw phase would start. 
    [WotC Rules Team 07/29/96]

@{b}Feldon's Cane@{ub}

+ Was on the Duelists' Convocation restricted list (only 1 per deck) for
    Classic (Type I) tournaments from 05/02/94 until 10/01/97.  Was on the
    restricted list for Standard (Type II) tournaments from 05/02/94

@node FELLW "Fellwar Stone"

@{b}Fellwar Stone@{ub}

  As errata, it should read "(T): Add one mana to your mana pool. This mana
    may be of any type that any land any opponent controls can produce. Play
    this ability as a mana source." [Encyclopedia Page 28] [Mirage Page 2]

  Cannot be tapped for mana if opponent has no mana producing lands.
    [bethmo 09/26/94]

  The generated mana is of the color the land would produce if tapped for
    mana after applying any effects on that land (such as Phantasmal Terrain
    or Reality Twist). [Aahz 07/11/95]

  It only produces one mana even if the land can produce more than one.
    [D'Angelo 08/02/95]

  Can generate any of the colors the land can produce, even if the land is
    one of the Homelands lands which has a cost in addition to tapping in
    order to generate that mana. [Duelist Magazine #9, Page 37]

  Works even if the opponent's lands are tapped.  It only checks what kinds
    of mana can be produced, not if the abilities that produce them are
    usable right now. [D'Angelo 10/31/96]

  The Dark version of this card can only generate colored mana.  It cannot
    generate colorless mana if an opponent controls a land that generates
    colorless mana. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]  Does not carry any 
    restrictions on the use of the mana that the original land might have had.
    [Aahz 08/01/95]

  The Fourth Edition version of the card can generate colorless mana if
    the opponent has a land that does so. [Duelist Magazine #5, Page 10]
    The generated mana has any restrictions that the land's mana would have
    had.  For example, if they have a Mishra's Workshop you could generate
    colorless mana only usable for casting artifacts. [Aahz 08/01/95]

+ You cannot play Siren's Call or any other spell/ability that can only be
    played prior to an attack when this spell is in effect, because the player
    cannot attack at all.  You can play instant speed effects such as the
    Nettling Imp and such before this spell resolves.  [Aahz 06/16/97]
    (REVERSAL) It used to be legal to play such spells.  Now you need to use
    Siren's call or whatever before resolving Festival.

  Cannot be retargeted since it can only be played during its target's upkeep.

    card before the draw and the top card after you are done drawing.
    [Aahz 06/16/97]  (REVERSAL)  Multi-draws used to be treated as a series

@node FINAL "Final Fortune"

@{b}Final Fortune@{ub}

  If you end up skipping the extra turn that is gained, you do not lose the
    game.  For example, you can feed the extra turn to untap a Time Vault.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]  The turn is not "saved" by the Time Vault, so
    when you use the Vault, that turn does not have the Final Fortune
    disadvantage. [bethmo 12/10/96]

  If more than one of these (or Time Walks) are used in a single turn, the
    extra turns happen in the order in which the spells resolve.

  If the damage to creatures is redirected to the player (via Jade Monolith
    or other effect), the "packets" from the fireball can all be prevented
    with one use of a Circle of Protection.  The trick is that all packets 
    from one use of a spell/effect can be prevented at once. 
    [WotC Rules Team 10/03/96]

  The mana spent for extra targets is not part of the casting cost for
    Spell Blast or other reasons. [Peterson 10/14/94]

    graveyard from play, return it to owner's hand.  It may not be summoned
    again until owner's next turn." [Encyclopedia Page 146]

  No matter how it goes to the graveyard from play, it returns to its owner's
    hand. [Aahz 06/16/94]  

  The rebirth is a triggered effect, so it is possible for another triggered 
    effect to remove it from the graveyard before the effect resolves.  In
    which case, it fails to work. [D'Angelo 11/11/96]

  The Phoenix power works even for Clones or Doppelgangers of a Phoenix.
    The Clone or Doppelganger goes to your hand immediately after going to
    the graveyard. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  Does not return if Disintegrated because Disintegrated creatures do not go
    to the graveyard first. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  Does return if a Runesword is used on it and it is destroyed.
    [WotC Rules Team 10/12/94]  The Runesword sends creatures to the graveyard
    first.

  It may not be summoned again until your next turn, but it can be put into
    play by effects such as Flash or Eureka. [Aahz 04/07/97]

  A Clone or Doppelganger of this card also cannot be summoned until your next

    or player." [WotC Rules team 07/03/97]

  Cannot be used by a creature with summoning sickness because the creature
    itself needs to tap. [D'Angelo 07/03/97]

  Remember that you tap the creature as part of the cost of announcing Fire
    Whip's granted ability.  So, if you have two Fire Whips on a creature 
    announcing the first one will tap the creature, so you cannot use the

  The casting cost you pay includes colored mana.  It effectively means that

    so. [Aahz 09/20/96]

  You choose the creature, put it into play, pay, then bury if you didn't pay,
    in that order, all during the resolution. [Aahz 10/30/96]

  You pay the cost after the creature enters play.  Thus, if there is an X in
    the cost, X is zero.  And X when the creature is being put into play is
    zero.  [Aahz 11/15/96]  Similarly, if a Clone is cast, you pay the casting
    cost of the new form it takes on and not the Clone card's cost.
    [Aahz 11/15/96]

  You can use mana source speed abilities of the card being put into play to

    has the same number of targets as the original." [Encyclopedia Page 208]
    The Encyclopedia entry mistakenly omitted the "sorcery or instant"
    targeting requirement. [D'Angelo 01/22/97]

  You need not (and may not) pay any additional mana or other costs (like
    sacrifices) to use the spell which is Forked. You get control over a
    complete copy but can change nothing except the targets.
    [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]

  If mana or other costs need to be spent at resolution of the spell, the
    caster of Fork would still be responsible for paying that cost.
    [bethmo 07/18/94]

  Extra costs which are in the spell text but not in the cost at the top of
    the card still count as part of the cost and do not need to be paid by
    the player casting Fork.  This includes extra mana in Drain Life, Soul
    Burn, etc. [Duelist Magazine #11, Page 57]

  You maintain full control over the copy of the spell regardless of who
    cast the original. [Snark]

  For spells like Fireball that allow mana to be used for damage or for
    additional targets, the controller of the copy must use the same
    number of targets the original spell did. [Duelist Magazine #3, Page 22]

  Forking a spell with an X in the cost like Detonate requires you to use
    the same X value.  In the case of Detonate, you must find an artifact
    with exactly the cost X. [WotC Rules Team 09/30/94]

  When Fork resolves, it resolves as if it were the copy of the spell.  The
    copy does _not_ get placed in the current batch.
    [Duelist Magazine #18, Page 29]  (REVERSAL)

  The Fork card itself acts as the copy once Fork resolves.  The Fork becomes
    the spell and will not go to the graveyard until the copy resolves.

  If something happens to the spell card being copied, the Fork will act
    completely as that card.  For example,  Recall removes itself from the
    game, so a Fork of Recall will remove the Fork card. [Aahz 02/17/95]

  When Forking Shahrazad and you lose both sub-games, you lose half of your
    life, and then half of what is left. [WotC Rules Team]

  Will copy changes made by interrupts to the spell prior to the use of Fork,
    such as Sleight of Mind or Magical Hack. [WotC Rules Team 09/15/94]

  If you change the color of the Fork from red that the resulting spell will
    not be red. [Aahz 11/07/96]

+ If you copy a spell for which Buyback has been paid, you get the Fork back
    in your hand as part of its resolution. [bethmo 10/14/97]

  Since it is still an interrupt at the last time at which its targets are
    checked, it cannot target something which is untargetedable by interrupts
    and it can target something which would be untargetable by the spell
    the Fork is actually copying. [DeLaney 08/11/97]
