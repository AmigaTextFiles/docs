 BRIEFLY
 --------

 This archive contains all you need to learn about polish national
 characters (codename AmigaPL), their codes, shape and shortcuts
 they use. It was created mainly for ATO (Amiga Translators'
 Organization http://ato.vapor.com/ato/) internal purposes, however
 as it may be useful for other persons and groups as well I decided
 to release it to the public.  This document is freely distributable
 as long as all files remains unchanged.

 
 CHARACTER CODES
 ----------------

 Below is the table of polish accented characters (NOTE: to see
 their proper shape you must use any correct polish font (e.g.
 enclosed TopazPL). How to read it? The 1st column contains the
 char itself, 2nd - the letter 'mapped' to 'plain keystroke'
 (there's no keyboard with polish chars painted on the keys),
 3rd one holds the hex code and last one, 4th the decimal code
 of the character. The left 'table' shows capitalized letters
 (and their codes), while the right one lowercased chars.
 The inbetween-character offset: UpperLetterCode - LowerLetterCode
 is equal to 32 and remains valid for all polish characters.

    Â   A     $C2     194                â    a     $E2     226
    Ê   C     $CA     202                ê    c     $EA     234
    Ë   E     $CB     203                ë    e     $EB     235
    Î   L     $CE     206                î    l     $EE     238
    Ï   N     $CF     207                ï    n     $EF     239
    Ó   O     $D3     211                ó    o     $F3     243
    Ô   S     $D4     212                ô    s     $F4     244
    Ú   Z     $DA     218                ú    z     $FA     250
    Û   X     $DB     219                û    x     $FB     251


 NOTE: the last characters ('Û' and 'û') are mapped to 'X' and 'x'
       respectively for keyboard access only! Their shape is close
       to 'Ú' and 'ú' and therefore should be mapped to 'Z' and 'z'
       if you would like to write polish texts  w/o accented chars!


 THE SHAPES
 -------------

 This archive contains modified Topaz font (TopazPL/8), as well
 as separate screenshots (in GIF format due to shorter output
 files) of all charasters, showing shapes of accented characters.
 Files are named pl_xxx.gif, when xxx is the decimal code of the
 character.
 

 SHORTCUTS
 -------------

 To get polish chars typed from your keyboard you need AmigaPL keymap
 (polish font would be useful if you want to see what you type).
 The modified layout of three main types of keyboard (GB, D and US)
 are enclosed in Keymaps drawer.

 To type accented character press:

  * lowercased: ALT + mapped_lowercase_letter  (a,c,e,l,n,o,s,z,x)
  * uppercased: ALT + mapped-uppercase_letted  (A,C,E,L,N,O,S,Z,X)
                ALT + SHIFT mapped_lowercase_letter

 Of course qualifiers must be hold while pressing the main letter.

 SUPPORT
 ---------

 The AmigaPL is the only one format Amiga uses here in Poland.
 It's used by polish environment package, the WFMH LocalePL
 (http://amiga.com.pl/pl/), as well as thrid party software
 producers and translators.
