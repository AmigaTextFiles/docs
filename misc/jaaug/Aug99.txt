Much as I like the thought of O/S 3.5, why would I want with 25 copies of it.

Funny how this appeared in a PC mag (Computer Shopper) I'd not heard about
this before, either that or I'd missed it. The news section in this mag about
the Amiga is good, though old, even by Amiga Format standards. I often buy
computer shopper as it's good to keep up with what's happening on other
platforms.

Check the amiga.com website on Y2K. There are 2 or 3 aspects of
Amiga subject to different problems. Mostly pretty minor. but we are
not immune. BTW- since the problems come from various portions
of the Amiga, they do involve different dates.

   Are you sure it /keeps/ it when you turn it off? I can set mine to 2099, it even goes over to 2100 fine, but when I turn my amiga off it sets it back 100 years.

See ya.

Even if they didn't confirm it, Transmeta's still the best fit for the clues
given so far; great emulation ability, top secret, Linus Torvalds works
there etc.

Of course, the last only became important after that wee Linux announcement
a couple of weeks ago.

That's because (I think) the Amiga clock does store it's years in two- digit
form, only instead of just putting a 19 in front, like on PCs, if it is
lower than 78, it attaches a 20. Hence the Amiga clock should cover 1979-
2078, but there are other issues; which, as Jim Mackoy points out, are
highlighted at www.amiga.com.

Thanks Linus, I guess the moral is don't forget to plug your modem in! Still
I might have a look at your suggestion for interest, ta!

The clock prefs program will allow you to go upto 2099, but most

I can give a technical explanation if you want :)

Commodore-Amiga wrote a secure screen saver.  It does block screen depth
changes and other stuff..  I think it was created around the OS2 time, so I
don't know how good it would be with blocking hot-keys though.

The Amiga doesn't store dates as ASCII figures.  It uses a variety of methods
depending on where you peek: some will be okay for 65000 years, but others
(like the main method of storing time) will run out around somewhere around
2050.

Hello Everyone,

I just e-mailed 'Jim VonHolle' who, for the less informed, is the man who will
be Marketing the Next Generation Amiga, if anyone is intereseted to hear what
he had to say about Marketing and PR then please read the following question
and answer.  I for one am now even more confident than ever about the Amiga's
comeback!  

The best product (regardless of OS) + best wishes + wishful thinking, will not
sell the Amiga.  Good Marketing will.  A good Marketing campaign will sell
just about anything eg. Windows 95, Windows 98, Bottled water, pet rocks, etc!

Didn't I see mention at one point that there might be multiple
processors in the different boxes? For the set-top box one of
the Japanese Mips chips might be a good fit. If its all Java it doesn't
make much difference what the engine is. For the top end, the
Transmeta (whatever it turns out to be) might be great, but there
could be a multitude of chips that could do the job for the different
boxes. Arm, PPC, Mips, and Fujitsu's new  VLIW chip.

I agree. A group of pupils at our school sold rock last year, and made quite
a tidy profit, too. Most of this was to do with their ad campaigns- putting
notes on every blackboard in the building, shouting about it whenever they
could... If they could sell rocks, I'm sure that a computer revolution
won't be hard to push!

From: roger buckley <rogerbu@callnetuk.com>

Hi everybody

A while ago I asked for help with my 'iffy' 16MB simm due to crashing
regularly
and usually invalidating hard drive partitions etc. Since then I have
re-installed 
my 8MB simm which has always been perfectly behaved. Today I decided to have
a try 
at the Napalm Demo for which I had to use the 16MB simm. It behaved
beautifully, only
crashing once in four hours using it with Napalm, Final Writer, Miami, Yam,
Ibrowse 
and PPaint.
Before running the above programs I ran MEMORYCHECK and the results of that
told me
that the Segments were OK and the Memory Chips themselves were OK but the
were >36 
errors in the Fast Memory addressing such as

$172df800  gives 17adf800
$171ff800  gives 179ff800
$1727e800  gives 17a7e800

The third element of the address was corrupt all the way through.

When it did crash the guru was 81000005 or Corrupt Memory List, Data written
to
wrong address. The other common guru is 8100000f, Bad Free Address, Memory
Header not located.

My query is that if the Memory chips themselves are OK and the addressing
fault only
appears when using the 16MB simm then the fault must lie within the simm but
is this
due to faulty hardware or software? If it's software can it be cured with a
patch or
something? The 16MB simm is a 60ns 72 pin simm from Gasteiner. The 8MB simm
came with
the original board from Power. I've rung them both and they both assure me
that their 
hardware is fine. When I first had problems I reinstalled WB 3.0 and started
from scratch but still got multiple crashes. I run an A1200 with 030 50mhz
Viper Mk V Accel internal 2.5" Seagate HD, external 3.5" SCSI Quantum HD
and Power 4xCD, both externals are in a midi tower, 56K Typhoon Modem and
Power Port Junior Serial Interface. The PPJ and Modem can be discounted as
the problems existed before I bought them. I have just backed up my wb to
another HD partition and had 6 errors of either object not found or name
too long. In every case when I clicked try again all was well.

I wrote the first part of this last night during a five hour session during
which I went  on and off line, edited & read mail, used Final Writer, Dopus
and PPaint without a single hitch BUT in one hour today it's crashed about
15 times, invalidated my internet partition and generally been obnoxious so
it has been replaced yet again with my trusty 8MB and Napalm will have to
wait for another day. It's been just like using a Wintel machine and do I
not like that.

Kind regards

roger buckley

Hello everyone,

Just recently, my poor old WB3.0 has started misbehaving.
Occasionally, when doing routine things like copying files, it crashes, with
MCP telling me that:

"Workbench has performed a privilage violation error (not in supervisory
mode)"

This sounds bad. Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this?


Regards,

Hello everyone,

I was thinking of the new Amiga  :-), and all the "Industry Standard" parts
that we'll finally be able use once again, like modern monitors, DIMMs etc,
without forking out considerable sums of hard- earned cash. Yes, it'll be
great, BUT; there are some niceties of the current Amiga that may be lost:

Has anyone heard of a USB keyboard with the Amiga key layout? I personally
couldn't stand using Windoze keys all day. Maybe Amiga will do something
about this?

Ahh, good old fashioned floppy disks. Amiga HD ones presently hold 1.72Mb,
but sadly (shame) PC ones only hold 1.44Mb. 0.28Mb ain't all that much, but
it can be useful from time to time. I hear rumours that MCC will ship with
a 1.44/ 120Mb superfloppy, but these don't accept Amiga disks.

Finished your work? SWITCH OFF! No cheapo shutdown and no Scandisk if you
get trigger happy with the power switch. I have nothing against the
shutdown, it's useful: For the less, computer- literate, it saves them
having to work out if the HDD's being accessed. For others, it's a way to
get a few minutes off work. It almost guarantees that your disks won't
suddenly become invalidated. But it shouldn't be forced on us; even if the
shutdown went on behind out backs, initiated by the power switch (perfectly
possible on ATX motherboards), it would be better than going to your Start
menu like a child and clicking with the mouse. HIT THE SWITCH!

I may seem a bit pessimistic, and I do acknowledge that the machine, if
pulled off, will be great; but it had better retain some of these good ol'
fashioned Amiga ideas.

Regards,

        Sandy Brownlee

I really don't think Amiga will ship a carefully custom-designed computer
without it's own matching keyboard

The only difference between an IBM 1.44 Meg and Amiga 1.8 meg is the file
system. Take an IBM disk, reformat it, and you got an IBM disk which can
still be read by that same drive.  They just use 1.44meg as a way of saying
High Density; those same drives will do Mac high density as well, even
though they format to yet another figure.  heck, I've formated IBM disks
into DiskSpare, for 1.98 Megs a disk.  This problem is non-existent.

The tech reports mentioned nothing about a Shut Down system.  Besides, this
is an operating system SOFTWARE issue, not anything to do with the new
hardware.

You can't use Amiga formatted disks in those LS-120s, though, and that's
pretty much what they'll be using from what I hear. This has got something
to do with extra check bytes or something, but it's also the reason that
you can't boot your old games from a PC drive through a Catweasel. (That's
why they made that Kylwalda thing, so you can still read Miggy disks.)

I didn't say I would just rant on about hardware ;-)

Most modern OSs use a shutdown of somesort (even Linux), so there's a good
chance that Amiga will implement one of some kind.

   Ok, if I remember correctly, there are some PPC programs at these websites:

http://www.xs4all.nl/~rvounik/ppc/
 

   Although, they've basically got what aminet has though.

In the Win 98 set up that I have to use at times it works with some
screen savers but not others. It seems (but I not sure) that it does NOT
work with the screen savers provided with Win 98 but DOES work with SOME
third party screen savers.

But how about just turning off the power, starting in DOS mode and
deleting all *.pwl files in C:\windows (passwords to get into windows
itself) and deleting all screen savers (*.scr in C:\windows) then going
to Windows.

Or maybe instead of deleting these items, create a new directory and
MOVE them all to there (making sure they are not left in original
positions).

I'm NOT going to try it as I don't want to muck up the computer (these
PCs are so EASILY mucked up!!) but I can't see why that shouldn't work.

This goes to show that how weak the Window's password system is.

Hi Everybody,

> This goes to show that how weak the Window's password system is.

   I thought, with the standard password system in windows (not the screensaver or bios passwords) all you have to do is cancel the password prompt and it loads up windows anyway.

   I'm not actually sure what the windows password system actually does, not a lot by the look of things.


PS. On the subject of hacking PC password systems, who wants to know how to by-pass 'WinLock' (win3.1)?
 
See ya.

Firstly,  as a technician, (and coder)  I have had to fix an amazing 
assortment of problems with various Amiga's,  
here are the top 3 causes for unstable Amiga's...

1:  Funky software !!   - hacks & dodgy code...
     Try booting from a virgin WB disk (with appropriate files for HD's etc)
     & run your applications that normally crash.

2:  The 5 volt power supply is NOT 5 volts.   
     if it falls below 4.8 volts,  you get random lockups & memory
     corruptions & general guru's
     These seem to be most prevelant with programs that use a
     bit of memory,  such as Browsers, lots MUI apps....

3:  Using an accelerator on an un-modified A1200 board.
     The mods are required as the clock signal to the accellerator
     is too low in amplitude to function properly.

     There are several components on the 1d.4 & 2d boards that
     perform no function,  they were installed for options that did
     not happen or were simply in error.
 
    

Remedies:   
--------
1:   Remove / fix / update  the offending software....

2:   USING AN ACCURATE DIGITAL VOLTMETER,
     Jack up the 5 volt rail to EXACTLY  5.01 volts,
     Measuring this ON the main board,  to accomodate any
     voltage drop on the cables.
     A good location is on the floppy power connector (dont unplug it)
     just poke the '+' probe into the back of the plug.  
     (the end pin, closest to the centre of the board.)
     The  '-'  probe to the modulator's case.


3:   Modification required for accellerators to function properly.
           (written instructions supplied by courtest of phil collins )
            {not the singer}

 ---------------------------------------------------
 As with most machines, the A1200 left the factory with a few
 design flaws. Most of these won't affect anybody, but they can
 stop some accelerators from working.
 Here are the modifications that should be made for a "perfect"
 A1200;
  
 
REV 1D.4
-------
 Budgie REV -01
 Remove E123C and E125C from the A1200 motherboard
  
 Budgie REV -02
 Remove E123C and E125C from the A1200 motherboard
 Remove XR358 470 ohm pull-up resistor
 Add 470 ohm pull up resistor at pin 43 of U, ie the Alice
 chip
 
 
REV 2B
------
 Budgie REV -01 and -02
 Remove E123C and E125C from the A1200 motherboard
 Add 470 ohm pull-up at pin 43 of U2, ie the Alice chip
 Change R118 from 470 ohm to 220 ohm

----------------------------------------------------

SO, CHECK YOUR HARDWARE,    If you are unskilled at these 
proceedures,   then DO NOT ATTEMPT IT,  you may destroy your board.
Find someone who can perform the mods to a suitable standard.

If your hardware is not stable, then nothing else will be....

This is true, but you won't be able to access any protected files.

It's more important if you're on a network, because without a username and
valid password, you only get access to the local machine.

Very many thanks for the comprehensive reply, I'm sure it has helped a lot
of folks on the list as well as me. I'll let you know the cause when I find
it.

Fresh poff the presses, courtesy my subscription to Infobeat, is this
clipped announcement concerning Sun Systems- one of the announced Amiga
Partners...

<clip>

*** Sun to unveil new chip architecture

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of
workstations, network servers and software, said it is working on a
new family of computer chips that will eventually power media-rich
consumer devices such as video games, handheld computers and screen
phones. Sun plans to unveil its design for its new media chips,
called the MAJC (pronounced magic) Instruction Set Architecture, at
the Hot Chips Conference, a symposium on high-performance chips at
Stanford University later this month. Sun's new chip architecture
will be used to create general purpose "convergence" processors,
chips which will run applications that blend communications, video,
sound and computing functions.
<end clip>

Notice the word "confergence"

My thinking- who says the AmigaNG can't have a Transmeta AND the new Sun
chip <*really* evil grin>

Later.

Yes that could be a crusher, but even better with the Glaze chip if it
lives up to it's billing. check it at

The specs on it are truly astonishing.

I haven't been able to get it to work with 95 or 98 but haven't tried third
party screen savers.  (mind you that would then be a problem with the 3rd party
not with windows).

Yep do this all the time (I support a medium sized network and people are always
forgetting their passwords)...  It doesn't damage anything to delete the
offending .pwl file in the windows directory while in DOS mode, but you don't
have to del the *.scr files, 'cause once you're logged in you just go to the
display properties and disable the screen saver password by unchecking the check
box...  (this really pisses me off btw.  because it should, really really should
ask you to enter the password to disable it...)

Mmm. Interesting. Well, after all these possibilties, one thing is certain;
Amiga will kick Intel ass!

A thought- given that Sun are "a little" involved with Java, would this
effectively be a native Java platform? (Completely destroying the
platformless standard, but nevertheless)

Well, according to all the available facts, Transmeta do not have the
facilities to make chips - they are just designing them for other parties
to use.  So, who's to say that Transmeta didn't design Sun's new chip?

There is a setting in the windows registry that allows you to change that, but I think by default if you hit cancel it just lets you in. (impressive security huh??)

>>    I thought, with the standard password system in windows (not the screensaver
or bios passwords) all you have to do is cancel the password prompt and it loads
up windows anyway.
>>

At the risk of sounding like I'm praising Windows, I believe that we all need
to recognize the merits of each OS before we go around bashing everything that
doesn't run on Amiga and wind up sounding completely ignorant in the process.


First off, we should understand that just as there are things which make us
extremely proud of our Amigas, there are also things that other platforms can
do that ours can't.

I work in an IT department supporting Win95, WinNT 3.51/4.0, MacOS, Solaris,
and IRIX.  The LAN I support is in a building with about 1500 machines.  The
WAN is worldwide (the only continents we don't connect to are Australia and
Antarctica).  

While I love to come home and relax with my Amiga, I recognize that it could
not handle any of the tasks that the machines I work with have to perform. 
So before we run around chanting "mine is better" let's ask ourselves if our
Amiga's can do anything that is expected of another platform such as:

1. Automated software delivery system
2. Centralized hardware and software inventory
3. Centralized security
4. Fault tolerance
5. Can easily roll out multiple machines with different configurations
6. Thin Clients (ie Terminal Server or Winframe)

This just what I've come up with off the top of my head, but the Amiga hasn't
even begun to play catchup with what most of the widely used machines can do
already.

So, before we go around saying "Windows sucks because you can just hit cancel
at the logon prompt to use the machine" maybe we should ask ourselves what advantages
the Amiga still has.  I'm always rooting for Amiga, but I know that smooth multitasking
on a 50mhz processor and screen dragging will never sell someone when the cheaper
alternative is a 500mhz machine that can do everything else.

X-UIDL: ebffd71e7a0e2abc0eeda0be1b336c50

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Whats that you say? You can't use a GFX card with amos?

Well, Think again! James Bond V0.98 is now out (cor, that was quick - ed) and this time it supports ANY GFX CARD!

Yes, thats right! Now all you BV/CV owners who were missing out because they didn't have a scandoubler can now finally play You Only Live Twice.

And if that wasn't enough, the CPU players are better and some bugs are fixed too ;)


   So, why not go to my homepage, Http://members.tripod.com/~mantasoft/ and download a copy of James Bond V0.98 now ;)




PS. James Bond has not yet been /tested/ on a gfx card, but the routines it uses have, so it should work no prob.

PPS. Does anyone have one of those 4-player adapters? I would /really/ like to know if James Bond actually works with it...

See ya.

X-UIDL: 85b4d11b6f73b910909600ec80e57063

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Whats that you say? You can't use a GFX card with amos?

Well, Think again! James Bond V0.98 is now out (cor, that was quick - ed) and this time it supports ANY GFX CARD!

Yes, thats right! Now all you BV/CV owners who were missing out because they didn't have a scandoubler can now finally play You Only Live Twice.

And if that wasn't enough, the CPU players are better and some bugs are fixed too ;)


   So, why not go to my homepage, Http://members.tripod.com/~mantasoft/ and download a copy of James Bond V0.98 now ;)




PS. James Bond has not yet been /tested/ on a gfx card, but the routines it uses have, so it should work no prob.

PPS. Does anyone have one of those 4-player adapters? I would /really/ like to know if James Bond actually works with it...

See ya.

I have to admit that until (approx) 12 months ago I'd fall into the category
that 'bashed' anything that didn't run on the Amiga...since I got my present
job however, I've come to realise that there are many things that are possible on
those 'other' platforms that the Amiga (in it's current incarnation) just can't
compete with. That was quite a sobering discovery ! (Ok, so I knew the facts but
didn't realise quite how much I'd miss certain features offered as standard
by Windows in it's various incarnations when I came home to my Amiga)

> First off, we should understand that just as there are things which make

One thing for me stands head and shoulders above the rest. Put quite simply,
it's the Amiga community !

I have Win 95, NT4, Novell 3.51 and some god awful IBM Mainframes. Luckily
for me the Unix is handled by another IT guy...I'd love to learn about it
but don't have the time :(

Well, you beat me there...by a long way !

I don't deal much with the WAN but yes, ours is global too

I think here that we have to remember that the Amiga was designed as a home
machine not a business one...yes there are Amigas in use in business but
primarily I'd say that it wasn't meant to be a server (for example)

All of these would be nice but would be almost impossible to implement
bearing in mind the current Amiga architecture :(

We'll get there :)

See above...the user base/community...call it what you will.

Unfortunately I have to agree...running an 030/50 here myself

I would love to see an Amiga that could be all things to all people...who
knows ... maybe it's possible ?

That's the most true thing I've heard so far.  I can't really think of any
other platform with such a loyal userbase besides maybe the Mac people and
the Linux people.

The most important thing a loyal userbase can do though is not be
closed-minded.  The Amiga has to play catchup to a lot of things, and it
helps to know what those are.  The only way to know what you're competing
against is by learning it.

Hello,
I bought a used cybervision64/3D, and I have A2000 with a 2630 card
and an Oktagon 208 harddrive card. I have 1mb chip ram and 8mb fastram
The problem is following: I don't get any picture on my monitor 
(Goldstar Studioworks 74m) I have installed the latest drivers,and I have
put the card in the nearest zorro slot(nearest to my2630 card) I also
disconected 4 mb ram from the Oktagon card.
Is there anyone who has any suggestions on what to do?
Thanks in advance

Kind regards
Börje Karlsson

Having not really met many Mac users I can't comment on them but the Linux

I'd love (don't know what the correct term is) Universal cut 'n paste 
without having got resort to plug in utils that sometimes work and
sometimes don't. Thats a start to my wish list for the NG Amiga :)

Here's a late update: Based on documentation I found at Seagate's site, I
moved a jumper on my Seagate ST3144A hard drive's JP3 jumper block from the
"Master on (Slave off)" position to "Slave present", installed SCSI_IDE
from the Amiga site, and finally, renamed the CD0 mount file to CD1 and
changed the Unit tool type from 2 to 1. My CD drive now works.

A belated thanks to all those who offered assistance.

Kind regards,

I've always like the idea of cut 'n' paste, but how about multiple
clipboards?
Cut, copy and paste all work like normal, but if you press a number key at
the same time, you perform the action on a different clip to the main one.
It's probably already been thought of, though.

It was years ago.....with Powersnap!
Still works to this day although not on proportional fonts.
I believe there are also some others available.

Thats got me thinking...I can't remember if it's already a feature of 
Win '98 or an add-on...Cliptray will handle multiple text entries
(Thats on the Win98 CD in \tools\reskit\desktop)

Anyway, thats just one of the features I'd like to see :)

Powersnap for some reason or another is a flaky as hell on my machine. 
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't...possibly due to the text
editor or whatever s/ware I'm using at the time.

I think it could be a bit more stable if the Cut 'n Paste was 'built in' as
part of the OS

Just my 2p worth :)

On my motherboard multimeter shows 4.90 at floppy power connector.
Unfortunately, I cannot adjust it to your suggested value as there's no
potentiometer inside PSU I use. Frankly speaking, I have no probs with my
Amiga but it would be fine to assure it stays that way when I connect some
additional expansions. Can you advice something?

As I said I had no probs but neverthless I did these fixes. Just in case. ;)

You seem to be highly experienced in hardware areas: is there a way to switch 
color burst off to in-built modulator? I have an old (but still very usable)
Philips NTSC/PAL green monitor and sometimes I connect it to my Amiga (mainly
to CD32 which serves as a debug console). It works fine but the picture
quality is not very impressive comparing to that of A500 MONO output. Any
chances to disable or bypass that Sony encoder on motherboard?

I'm still suprised that there are people who have never heard of CBE 
'short for Clip Board Enhancer' which auto-magically assigns each clip 
it's own clip (up to 256 clips) and paste from anyone of them. The clips 
can be preloaded and works hand in hand with powersnap, supports your 
editor, save functions, datatypes and more..

CBE should be one of those 'must have items' turns your clips into files 
with icons and works with just about every Amiga program and is 
especially nice with Browsers.

In your case,  anything above 4.85 volts will be fine,  
(but not a millivolt lower)
The computer /may/ tollerate low voltage conditions reasonably well
but unfortunately, accellerators & ram simms go really strange
when the voltage goes too-low.. 
It can even be mistaken for thermal problem, because the simms or
GAL chips  used on accelerators/ram boards/gfx cards 
change their characteristics depending on temperature.
If they are also experiencing a low voltage situation as well,
they may only seem to 'crash'  when they warm up..

A lot of the power supplies are  not adjustable because they 
are preset in the hardware or totally sealed in epoxy resin....
If you have a sealed one,  get hold of an old A500 power supply,
they had a better current rating,  plus,  they are adjustable too....

The only effect you may get, using a monochrome monitor 
on a color CVBS output,  would be very fine (mesh like)  
lines over the picture...

However this is unlikely, because most mono monitors roll off
their response at about 4.5Mhz,  so having the color subcarrier
present should have no effect on the video display....

I would be more likely to suspect your coaxial cable from
the video output.

Most people don't realize that CVBS signals occupy a large
signal bandwidth & cable designed for audio are NOT suitable.

You need a good 75 ohm coaxial cable for the video signal.
(with proper line termination at the monitor.)
Otherwise you get color bleed, streaking, ringing & other 
nasty effects..

Incase the color subcarrier IS the cause of your  "bad picture"
you can disable it for test purposed quite easily,
by simply linking the 2 terminals of the color crystal together.. 
   (square metal can with 4.43Mhz on it)

This will effectively remove all color component from the signal.

If you still get problems, your trouble is elsewhere...

The Amiga has 256 clipboards - a lot of programs allow you to choose which one
they'll use, but normally most things clip to unit 0.  There *is* a program
somewhere that will let you choose which unit to work with for any program, but
I can't remember it's name..

From: Johan Forsberg <johfor@stromsund.mail.utfors.se>

Hi Everyone
I got a problem with Theme Park AGA. When I start it, it just crashes. It
dosen't matter if I start it from WB or no startup-sequence. In the manual
it says that if you got problems with Theme Park then just remark setpatch
in startup-sequence. I disabled all patches I got and started from WB. What
did I see? Flashing lights :) It crashed... I disabled my PPC-board and
made backups of my orignal disks and runned it from disks... It worked but
it isn't so fun to run from disks... And it's very slow on a 020... Anyone
who can help me? I want to run from Hd without disabling stuff... I can't
run from Hd with only 2 Mb ram (when I disable my PPC-board). My computer
spec is:

A1200
Blizzard 603e 160 MHz with a 040/25MHz
16 Mb ram
1.7 Gb Hd

Thought so- any good computing idea, and normally Amiga has already been
there in some shape or form. Bizarre how the workbench itself never made
use of this facility though, like Windoze's cut, copy and paste files.

This may be a bit patronising, but it's always best to check the simple
things- have you got 68040.library correctly installed?

On the same topic, does anyone know how to use Theme Park's save game on an
HDD, without invalidating the disk?

Either recode TP or use a filesystem which doesn't get invalid (ie.
SmartFileSystem)
The same goes for Syndicate

   Yes, go to the title screen, then press F7 to quit the game (I think its F7, Fsomething anyway).

   That way the system can write back the bitmap.

I don't recall the name but I do remember it ison Aminet somewhere. Doing a
search for clipboards would probably find it.

Does OS3.5 have better support for the 256 clipboards? :) I keep hearing
stuff that I wish was better supported by Workbench.

For those interested below is an excerpt from "AmigaDOS For Beginners"
(available on Aminet at:-

   docs/help/arexxbegin.lha

Also I have a program (but never used it) called "Clip Board Enhancer"
by Anthony J Moringello anthony@pha1.csd.uwm.edu this let you switch
between the various clipboards.

I don't know if it is still available

~~~~~~~~~~~~ excerpt ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 THE CONCLIP COMMAND


Location     - "c" directory

Purpose      - To make available the ability to copy text from the
               console device to the clipboard device and then paste it
               into another window

Availability - AmigaDOS Versions 2.0 Onwards

As you probably know, from AmigaDOS Version 2.0 onwards, you can
highlight
text in a console window by dragging the mouse pointer over the text
with
the left mouse button held down then copying it by pressing RIGHTAMIGA/C

The copied text can then be pasted into the same or another window by
pressing RIGHTAMIGA/V.

The windows being copied from and pasted to must both be ones that
support
such actions. The Shell and ED windows both allow it. Some third party
programs also have windows that can act in this way.

This system is set up by using the CONCLIP command. However, for it to
work your system must have the following files present:-

  LIBS:iffparse.library
  DEVS:clipboard.device

The usage for CONCLIP can be one of:-

  CONCLIP

  CONCLIP UNIT number
  CONCLIP number

  CONCLIP OFF

  CONCLIP UNIT number OFF
  CONCLIP number OFF

The keyword UNIT is optional so that:-

  CONCLIP UNIT 1
  CONCLIP 1

are identical in action. Both turn unit 1 on,

and:-

  CONCLIP UNIT 1 OFF
  CONCLIP 1 OFF

are identical in action. Both turn unit 1 OFF.

If used without a unit number, the default unit 0 is used:-

  CONCLIP       turns unit 0 on
  CONCLIP OFF   turns unit 0 off

There 256 available unit numbers ranging from 0 to 255

The default unit 0 is the one set up in the normal startup-sequence
file.

You can change the number to any of the other 256 units. For example, to
change to unit 1 you would use:-

  CONCLIP 1

If you used this after unit 0 was set up at startup, anything previously
copied to unit 0 would be preserved and all copying would then be to
unit 1. You could then retrieve the text in unit 0 by using:-

  CONCLIP 0

and anything in unit 1 would be preserved.

All this would be rather tedious if done manually in a Shell/CLI window.
However, if you want to be able to preserve a lot of clips in different
units, there are utilities available to do the job for you. Two of them
that I know about (there could well be others) are:-

  CBE (Clip Board Enhancement)   Shareware by   Anthony Moringello
  ClipHistory                    Freeware  by   Magnus Holmgren

Both are available on Aminet web sites and CD-ROM disks in the directory
"util/cdity".

Some programs also have the ability to select various clipboard units
but offhand I cannot think which ones they are.

The OFF Option can be used to turn off CONCLIP. What then happens is the
you can still copy and paste but the copied text is NOT written to the
clipboard. So, if you had text in the clipboard unit 0 (the default
unit)
that you wished to keep there, you could enter:-

  CONCLIP OFF

then do a copy and paste, then enter:-

  CONCLIP

and the original text in unit 0 will again be available.

I see u have 040 CPU. I have 030 but MOST OLD and/or badly programed games doesn't
like caches turned on or VBR in fast ram. So try tude from Aminet to turn
off caches and move VBR to Chip mem. First I would sugest you to turn off
Copyback mode of 040 CPU (with CPU command) and then move VBR to Chip mem.

Hope this helps, Vytas

From: Phil Collins <philbert@cyberone.com.au>

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but here goes:-

Can anyone please tell me if it's possible to use a joystick, to
navigate in "Alien Breed 3D II"?
I'm sure I've done it once some time ago, but I can't remember
how I did it.
The game manual says nothing about using a joystick.

Thanks Andrew, 
Guess what! -  it works with v.II as well - I'm a bit embarrassed
about it being so simple!

Subject: [just-amiga] Broken HardDrive
X-UIDL: 5b772a5edeab21efcdae673411c82a73

From: Jack York <jyork@voyager.net>

Hello,

I'm afraid I know the answer to this but I want to be sure. 

My original scsi harddrive lost its RDB.  I was able to recover some
of it but I wanted to get a second drive installed so I took it
out of the system and set it aside for the moment.  I got the new drive
working and installed the original as a second drive to try and recover
the rest of it but the system doesn't even recognize it as being
hooked up.  That is, if I run HDInstTools, only the new drive
shows up on the bus.  I replaced the original with a known good third
drive and HDInstTools shows both of them (the new one and the third one).
This seems to indicate that the original drive is really broken
now.  Is this repairable (there is still some important data on it)?  Is
there some utility to test it more in-depth?  Or should I just throw it
away and forget about it? :(

Jack

	I suspect that you've got a corrupt RDB and it's causing HDtools 
to come up with problems. If you put back this drive 'EXACTLY' 
back as it came out... you'll be left with a semi-readable drive. By 
adding another drive in it's place, the RDB wants to be changed as it 
keeps a record of what drive is online and it's position, with one drive 
having a corrupt RDB... it's anyone's guess if you can recover the data. 
Sounds like you might be forced into specifying the drive type, size 
etc.. manully before a complete format.

I think I have done this.  The last time it was working I did have
the original and the spare third drive I mentioned installed.  But
the spare drive didn't have all the tools I needed so that's why
I decided to get the new one up and running first.

I'm not sure how to do that since HDInstTools can't see the drive.  I
have to be able to select it before I can do anything else don't I?

Hi folks

Do any of you use digital cameras?  I'm vaguely interested in getting
hold of one, possibly the Sony one that uses floppy disks as "film".

If any of you use one of those (or any digital camera) alongside your
Amigas, I'd be interested to hear how well they work, any problems
you've had etc.

Hi

I have an Amiga 600 (1Mb RAM) without a harddisk and I'm trying to transfer 
files from Amiga to PC. I have found this very hard to get it work. I have 
used Pc2Am308 and every time it crash on Amiga side. When the program 
starts, I can see the PC drives and after 5 seconds it crash. I really like 
this program (if it works) because it uses PC:-device so I can transfer 
ADF-files directly to the PC.

Any recommends to another easy to install & use file transfer systems? Or 
any help to get that pc2am to work. The best system would be a TCP/IP + 
NFS, but it sounds too big for my little Amiga.

I bought and used one of the Kodak cameras a year or so ago as it was about the
only thing that I could afford and there was a program that would import the
pics into the Amiga - to some extent. I then happened upon a pretty good price
for one of the Sony Mavicas with the zoom lens. I have been quite pleased with
it and have had it a year or so now with no problems. The pics are simply
jpegs and if you can read the high density disks (PC formatted), then all you
have to do is copy them over to your Amiga and that's it.

    I use "pc2am" frequently and am extremely fond of it.  I'm trying to think

Hi Stephen,

	Just thought I'd give you my viewpoint as a Canon Xapshot owner 
and a Sony Mavica user. The Canon Xapshot is a still camera in name 
only... it stores it's signal on a small 2.5" floppy in analog format; 
much in the same was a video tape camera does. I use DCTV to get images 
of reasonable web quality 320X240 or quick grabs... although I've had to 
use IMFX and a script to do some post clean-up and re-sizing. The camera 
came in two versions... one double my resolution (and more than double 
the price at the time). These cameras should be available in the 
marketplace for $100-200 tops. Advantages, size (fits in a large pocket) 
and number of pixs (50 on a disk) and with no flash, I can grab 100 
images on a battery charge, and of course price..

	The Sony Mavica I have use of takes a 640X480 pixel picture and 
saves it directly on a MS-DOS formated 1.44 floppy. It's picture is much 
clearer than the Xapshot even used with better digitizers. It has zoom 
and image pre-view, and many assorted commands. This is a much more 
expensive unit... and of course there is newer models with even better 
resolutions, But the price is low amount of images per disk (no big deal 
carring floppies around) and the heavy size/weight and not to mention a 
much hefter price. 

	Myself... I'll go for one of those super megapixel cameras (I 
heard Fuji has a 4 meg chip version coming) and the digital camera market 
is really hot so look for prices wars everywhere, and make sure you can 
get the final pictures into the Amiga somehow.

Hi Kimmo,

	I've tried most of the Amiga<->PC software including Pc2Am but 
found them lacking... espcially considering how nice Pc2Am looks and 
sometimes works. I ended up using 'TWIN' as my day-to-day file transfer 
system. It's fast (read about a 1 meg a minute) compared to modem speeds 
and works well.. (you might have to use it from DOS) at least on my 25 
footer.

My response is read the WB2 manual. Are we all forgetting that you can copy 
stuff from CLI's and output windows on WB by first selecting it and then 
pressing right-amiga and c. Paste it using right-amiga and v. This perhaps 
does not allow you to select certain things but is is useful nonetheless.

X-UIDL: ff68e07678c5d7b915b0d1790883d431

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi all,

Well i'm back, at last. After a short weeks break in The Netherlands aka
Holland. Well the trip was fine, the flight was fine, the country is
great
and the holiday was excellent :)

Holiday talk, skip if you don't want to be bored ;)....

Well the flight going was at 6:30am which was a real pain in the arse,
meant having to get up real early to catch the flight. If your like me
you don't normally go to sleep until 2-3am some nights then you'll
know it was basically impossible for me to get any sleep as I had
to be up for 4am to get ready. This meant... I got no sleep at all, well
I tell a lie, about 15 mins in total. Big deal!

I flew from Liverpool airport which is a bit hill-billy, ie. small :) But
the flight only takes an hour which isn't bad at all. I'm still not
completely sure I like the idea of flying, i've only flown these last
few years, it'll probably take a bit more to get used to. I don't
like the bit where the plane levels out as the engines seem to
make no noise as the front of the plane tips forwards, arrg :)

Well anyway I didn't crash as you can probably tell. No duty free
this year due to the stupid europian ruling or whatever so that
is a bit of a blow, us brits like our duty free. Anyway we flew out
at 6:30am practically on the dot and arrived in the Netherlands
1 hour later at 8:30am CET, they are one hour ahead so don't
think i've made a mistake in the times :)

I'm not sure about spellings of these places so for anyone who
knows or all you living in the Netherlands I excuse myself for
my poor spelling of place names. The main airport, Schipol (Sp?)
we arrived at was packed out. Ok its a main airport and 8:30am
isn't that early in the morning but it could have been a little
less packed :) A host of languages went flying around the place
with the Americans out in force, it seemed like there was some
male and female basketball team there or something from the US
but i'm not sure, I just walked straight on past.

We boarded a double decker train, yes! double decker, don'y
know if they exist in any other country but in England trains
with two floors, don't exist, it wasn't a shock to me because
I was in the Netherlands last year also but they are a sight
to see, very big :) The top floor gets very hot and is normally
full of smokers and the bottom floor is too low. As always these
trains are packed to the brim with people. You are lucky to
get a seat if you get on at a main station at a peak time. You'll
be lucky to be standing aswell. Standing on a moving train
with bags and cases is not easy! These trains go fast, well
fast compared to british trains which are down right slow.

Oh the joy of trying to get out of peoples way without them
needing to start speaking dutch to me only to find a blank
faced reply. I was armed with my one liner "Spreekt u engelse"
which for you who havn't caught on means something like
do you speak english.

>From the airport station we travelled to Amsterdam 'Centraal
Station' to catch a connecting train to our first destination.

Overall my holiday was great :) I love Holland especially
Amsterdam but Amsterdam is nothing like the rest of Holland.

If anyone is thinking of visiting the Netherlands but is in two
minds then i'd say go for it :)

Toodle Pip!

You must have had a tail wind and I hope Liverpool Airport has improved from
the mid sixties when the firm I used it. It was like Biggin Hill in '41 but
with 2 more sheds! We used to fly British Caledonian DC3's to Schipol,
Rotterdam, Bremen  & Hamburg and back to take over fresh postings on Elder
Dempster line ships.

Nothing to it, just keep flapping your arms and ensure you've supped your
pre-flight bottle of whiskey.

Back of the station used to be notorious for 'window-shopping' to suit all

doesn't fit me any more.)

The strange thing about Amsterdam is naming their football team after a
kitchen cleaner, weird. I once had a job interview in Amsterdam and as my
mate and I arrived from Frankfurt at 8 o'clock in the evening, the
interview was held in the bar of a strip club at midnight. Didn't get the
job but we had a bloody good time on the expenses. 

Anyway good to see you back, the list has been pretty quiet of late.

does the job for me :)

Well not exactly, the team came before the cleaner. The cleaner is
also pronounced different so there you have it.

I did goto the Ajax stadium and as I send in the email i send the list
from Amsterdam is was great! you get to sit in the managers and
team sideline chairs and walk right up to the pitch.

Yeah, I noticed that. Only 85 messages in 2 weeks. Better get
shouting my mouth off on one or two topics then, huh?

Yeah, thats what i thought. I posted it because I hadn't personally
heard anything about it. I was expecting people to say thats old

Dear Interested Parties :)

For those of you who care, MicroMart say they would be interested
in a 600 word news section once per month on the Amiga front for
me to do.

I guess its a good way to promote the Amiga into the general
public so i'll keep you informed of where things are taken from here
on.

Sorry to cross post, but this has just surfaced on the TeamAmiga list.
I thought you may like to know about it, if you don't already...!


I don't know if it is real or not, maybe someone could shed some

Considering the specs of one of them says it comes with a standard of 8 megs
of chip, I'd say it's a hoax.

Isn't the picture of the A1010M actually one of those new IMac towers?

Anyway, I think 8 megs of chip may be possible, (UAE does it) but the rest of it seems pretty unlikely, especially the 3D accellerator.

   But, I DARE someone to order one, that's the only way we'll really know :)

See ya.

X-UIDL: 02fa9aac6b77287250320533520d5ab7

From: Andre Wittkamp <andreone@wantree.com.au>

Hi everyone,

I am writing this letter because I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to
expansion boards with the amiga 1200.  I currently have an 'Act Apollo 1240'
board that has an 040 chip, 32 Megs of Fast ram in it and runs at 25 Mhz (it
also has a 68882 co-pro. thingy)  What I wanted to know is how can I increase
the Mhz (35+ would be cool) I've heard of overclocking, but am under the
impression that this can damage the board if done incorrectly.  What exactly
is overclocking?  Will it increase the temperature of my board, the board
currently runs quite hot (it has its own tiny fan though), also I have already
placed larger rubber stoppers under my keyboard to allow for more air flow and
left the trapdoor cover off (I taped a fine synthetic mesh over the hole to
keep out dust =)

Any ideas?  Does anyone also own this board who has already overclocked it
successfully?  

Thank you for listening to my tale of woe, any help is most apprieciated.

That in itself is nothing to disqualify it,  all you need is 2 more address
lines going to the "AGA-esque" chipset/registers & you can 
address 8 megs, add another one & you can do 16Mb....   
It is obvious that it is not AGA, because that is copyright by Amiga.
BUT - There is no copyright on making another chip that just happens
to have the same registers in the same place...  Maybe even more
features than AGA,  the thing only needs to have the same ones as
the original Amiga to run the software though.

The machine may just use a PC gfx card in a slot ??
With registers set up to make the software think its running on AGA,
but just routing the data to the gfx card instead.   ???

The BoXeR does this, does it not?
Also, Iwin are rumoured to be after what's left of CBM, so maybe this is a
hacked AAA?  :-)
Or do Amiga own this also?

(Cor, 3 questions in one reply!)

Hi Everybody,

   I don't think so:

A) AGA and GFX cards store the data in a totally different way (AGA panalar vs VGA chunky).

B) The copper, blitter and other custom chips would have to be emulated or nothing would work.

C) No PC card (AFAIK) supports all the stuff that AGA can do, H/W scrolling/vertical res switching etc. 


   Anyway, that whole thing looks like a very late april fools, or just a stunt to get more hits on there web page?

See ya.

In theory, yes. But what happens with the compatibility? Most stuff
should run but I bet many games are a non-starter. Most modern stuff
should run with 0 megabytes of chip even, if there's a gfx-card in
there somewhere. Okay, it was a hoax but nonetheless...

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

We've only had one reply to next issues hot topic. Issue 27 of AIO
is released in a week so if you have any comments on the hot
topic listed in the issue 26 letters page then email them to,

Hot topic :

The news that Amiga have decided to choose Linux for the NG
Amiga instead of QNX came as a great shock to everyone. For
next issue send us your comments and ideas on this matter,
do you think it was the correct move? or do you think its too
late to change? will this effect your support and backing to
Amiga? So if you have anything to say on this subject contact
us at the address above.

Thanks!

Toodle Pip!

[*UK Mainland ONLY*]

Dear all!

Sorry this isn't really to do with the mailing list but i'm putting my
mobile phone up for sale so if anyone is interested then read
below;

Vodafone - 'Pay as you talk' for sale!

Ericsson GA628 digital phone connected to the Vodafone digital network
for the BEST in clear sound quality.

=A35.00 built in calling credit with roughly 165 days service credit, ie
you won't have to top-up for at least 165 days if you don't want to!

The phone comes with belt clip, two front covers, the original one and
an extra wacky yellow one worth =A34.99. Slim battery as standard
with recharger, only 1hr for full charge. All with original boxes and
manuals hardly ever toutched.

With the Pay as you talk service you only buy credit when you need
to, you don't have to be 18, you can be under 18 and there are no
contracts and no monthly bills. You do not get charged any standing
charge each month and no phone bill.

All you do is buy top up cards from most shops, news agents or
most retailers and phone a number and enter a simple code, you
then will have the value you paid on your phone ready to use.
A simple toutch of a button will tell you your credit balance and
how many days you have left.

Digital phones are state of the art, you can phone people with
perfect quality, to land lines or other mobiles, you can even
phone over-seas with excellent quality (I phoned Canada with
little loss of quality) - Quick charging batteries that you can
even use the phone while charging.

Mobile number is : 07887 664 915

You can send SMS messages to and from your phone because
it is digital. Many different ring tones, including normal rings
and other tunes.

Attached is a front view of the phone. Note, it does not come
with the blue front but with the original black vodafone one and
an extra wacky yellow one worth =A34.99.

Don't forget you get =A35.00 of calling credit built in so you
are ready to make calls and also if you bought this phone
new you would not get the 160+ days service credit and the
extra yellow front cover.

Interested? email me,

amiga@thefree.net

Toodle Pip!

X-UIDL: 38f7a8f676af1a40d0fa9ef43da7555c

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Dear AIO go-ers,

If your interested to see what the new AIO website will look like when
it is back online in a few weeks then visit;

http://www.aio.co.uk/sneakypeak.html

I can't give a date for when the site will return because I need to
get Conor Kerr to fax the .co.uk registration company to move the
hosts. Pester him at, *ck@mystcorp.com* - he doesn't seem to be
doing anything.

Hi Andrew...

>> Is there anyone that can help me in Wasted Dreams?? I'm COMPLETELY
>> stuck!! :(((
> 
>   Which bit? I'm up to that silly sewers bit...

I have killed everyone in the forest, and in the big "house" too...

I have a few problems:

Please don't tell me everything, just enough to get me going again!!

· There is a bush the "he has the feeling there is something behind"...
· And in the cave, it's a blue fire, how do I put that out?? I think
  that I must get one of the two cans that he doesn't wanna pick up!
· How do I get behind the locked door by the shield recharger?
· How do I get behind the door where I need higher ranks?
· How do I get behind the door right next to the ventilation?
· How do I get behind the door where two guards says no! ?

Please, only answer on the things I need to get further!!!

Usually you change the oscillator to one with higher MHz but it's kind of
controversial.

   Do stuff to it, I can't remember what. (he clears the bushes away...)
You need whats behind it.

> · And in the cave, it's a blue fire, how do I put that out?? I think

   You don't do that bit for a while yet...

> · How do I get behind the locked door by the shield recharger?

   Where? It sounds like you've already got through it \/

> · How do I get behind the door where I need higher ranks?

   Go to the top room, get the person at the bar's locker key and open his locker, put his uniform on.   

> · How do I get behind the door right next to the ventilation?

   you can't do that until the previous bit /\

> · How do I get behind the door where two guards says no! ?

   that's even further into the future :)


   Hope that helps. I didn't want to spoil it too much, so if you have probs with the later bits too then I could give you a hand with those as well.

See ya.

From: Lorens Johansson <SnorsleX@Home.se>

Hi Andrew...

You said that you where stuck in the sewers?? Is that the place where energy
waves sweeps by?? Then I'm stuck there too :)

Did you use the bomb somewhere earlier?

Did you kill the man you got the High Priority card from? (Depending on
which card you give him!)

So, then we're both stuck, I have NO idea on how to flee from the energy
waves, seems there's no way of escaping! :( And two waves kills me :(

   Ok, in the top right screen, you find the wall along the top that doesn't have a generator on it, then use the pickaxe on it.

From: Andre Wittkamp <andreone@wantree.com.au>

Hi everyone,

Some of you will probably already know this but I just wanted to inform
everyone that a certain Mr. J.A. Gomez of Spain is giving away his keyfiles
and full programmes for free, he simply states on his home page that he has
left the computer world and that his work is for the Amiga community!!!

He has these:  - AmiGameBoy (Gameboy Duh)      
               - AmiMasterGear (Sega 8-bit)
               - AmiMSX2 (Similar to C64)

Note that the above are all very complete and very quick they all run full
speed and sometimes even too fast on my 25MHz 040, and that is even with
Workbench and Ibrowse running!!!!  What damn fine emulators!  I guess if you
ran em without booting WB (no startup-sequence) then even a mild mannered 030
would do.

               - AmiPCEngine 
               - AmiNes (NES 8-bit)

These two are not complete, however they still run graphics (to a certain
extent) and if anyone has the know-how to complete them , Gomez is even giving
away the sources at this web site :

   HTTP://WWW.Arrakis.es/~joanant  (this is where they can all be found at) 

Happy gaming everyone!

   Technical point: (sorry, being picky) Workbench and Ibrowse were NOT running in the background, his emulators disable multitasking, therefor are quite fast.

   Shame he hasn't released the sources to the other emulators so that other authors can finish them. ah well.

Hello,

Has anyone been able to get the real audio player RAPlay to work?
According to SnoopDos it is failing when looking for the 
tsocket.library.  This isn't mentioned in the docs nor can I
find it on Aminet.  

Jack

	There's a number of issues and factors to get this running 
properly (and some might say hardly worth the effort).I'm not sure if the 
support site at http://csc.smsu.edu/~strauser/RA.html is still alive, but 
you might have a look. RAPlay is just the decoder and needs a .RA file, 
most unfortunately are some other incarnation. There's also 
optimized versions for 030/FPU etc around... so you have to have the 
correct decoder, not to mention if the file is using 28.8K or 14.4K baud 
and of course your CPU has to be able to handle the file decoding or 
you'll get a lot of dead air.

	I debugged this whole set-up using the ra player from a shell on 
a known .ra file in ram: and then using the optimized settings for my 
configuration, tuned this up for the web. I use it inconjuction with my
browser and set up the same sucessful .ra in a local web link and configured
the optimal web settings using a pipe something like 

c:ra >AUDIO:B/16/F/8000/T/SIGNED filename

It's clear my Amiga needs a somewhat faster CPU to really 
appreciate Real Audio. But if you can get it working from a shell, then 
there's no reason it shouldn't work streaming into a pipe from the web.

	from what I've seen of the RAplay script on Aminet, it looks like 
it's an update of the script included on AFCD38 (April issue) and might 
require the full original and a version of RXsocket.library. If the 
script doesn't work out of the box... either try modifying it, contact 
the author, or set-up RA as I did through the browser.

Subject: [amos-list] Anyone got Willy Beamish?
X-UIDL: 1901b02a03d23761328b6ce746a9f5a1

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Dear All,

Does anyone have the original of a point and click adventure similar
to Monkey Islands called *Willy Beamish* by Sierra?

I can't remember when it was released but probably some time
between 1991-1994.

I'm only looking to buy the original so if anyone has it and is willing
to sell it please contact me.

Toodle Pip!

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Dear People,

I know someone asked this question a few weeks ago but can anyone
recommend a good quality camera for under £300? I really don't
want to spend over £300 just for a Digital Camera.

If anyone has one that cost them under £300 that is of course
available in the UK can they show me a true picture that they've taken
with it, not an edited and processed one. If you can recommend
one and have an example photo then please send it to,

amiga@thefree.net

Thanks

Toodle Doo!

X-UIDL: fbc328c0a2cb692c29162d52f9feb3a4

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Does anyone know where you can get the music to the film Hackers
which was released to the end of 1995?

At the end of the film it mentions the music can be bought from somewhere
or another but I can't make it out.

Anyone got any ideas?

Not me, but if you don't find someone who got it you could try to ask
for it on the comp.sys.amiga.games newsgroup.

Yeah - any and every decent record shop. If they don't have some filed under
'Hackers' in their soundtracks section, they can order it for you!

My brother has it, he had to get it ordered in from across the Atlantic
though. If you've got a Solid Sounds near you somewhere, they should be
able to sort it out.

Hi Chris

As far as I know you can get the soundtrack from any good record shop.  My
mate got a copy from Virgin in Nottingham about a year ago.

Thanks!

Also sorry to hear about Amiga Uni. What are you going to do with the
domain name?

If you've had the problems I have you'll never get it moved off fast
hosts!

Hi,

Does anyone use AmiComSys?

I've just used AmiComSys for the first time and i went into the hotline
bit but there was noone there, do you have to join channels like on
IRC?

Does noone use it or isn't it always full or something?

Toodle Pip!

You have only the one channel I think. You can branch off into private chats.
Program worked very well.

> Does noone use it or isn't it always full or something?

Yep. You're right. 'Tis a bit dull. Don't think anyone is using it much anymore
since ICQ seems to be pretty well working. The thing about ACS was that it was
only Amiga users. No ability to access anyone outside. Hope Hakan is still
active with his programming. Very nice work on a number of programs in
addition to ACS.
I just got off and, as you said, no one there......

Regards

At the moment, the site is undergoing a huge rethink with regards to how
it'll work and what we'll provide. It's looking likely that we'll be
registering a second domain name, then running the site on both.

It's going to take a while apparently.

Hello,

To conserve messages, I want to say thanks to all of those that
responded to my question about getting RealAudio to work.  I did get it
working but it turns out to only work on the older type of files.  And
while there are quite a few out there, apparently most are not
recognized by the program. :(

Jack

I frequent there sometimes but not much since we now have Stricq. The
hotline does not have channels. It is a very fine program but was kind
of messed up by a guy that was a nut named cooksey. We used to have a
bunch of fun there but he just about drove everybody away.

Maybe I will see you there.

I pop it up occasionally,  but there is seldom more than 3 people there.

Does anyone know of a Liquid Audio player for the Amiga? There are a
couple of files I'd like to get at, but I won't waste the time, if
there's no player for the Amiga.

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Just some news from Alive Mediasoft.. thought you may all want to see..
or not :)?!

Although Alive did kindly send me the Prophet patch of 300k email
but no review copy, NICE!

*---SNIP---
*
Hello,

Alive is no longer just a games company.  From September 1st we are now
offering utilities, hardware and serious software.  Our publishing house
is also in developement with several serious applications.  

The first to be released is a product we have just signed the
distribution rights for this week. The developement team is an Italian
company called Darkage Software. The product is Extreme.

Extreme is a brand new program that is essential to anyone involved in
creating visual demos or video titling on their Amiga.  Whether you are
new to the demo scene or an old pro, Darkage has created Extreme
with an interface so user friendly it will make your life so much easier.
Using Extreme you can create state-of-art visuals involving complex
animated background animations.  Anyone who has dabled in demos
will be glas to hear that Extreme is controlled with the click of a
button.

*Extreme* is available on CD or *Extreme 1.5* is available on Floppy
disk.

Extreme 1.5 floppy version £9.99
Extreme CD £14.99

*Extreme Features:*

100% Assembler Coding
Fully Multitasking
Optimised Routines For 68020, 030, 040 &060
Real Time Calculated Effects
Mixable Textures And Effects
Highly Customisable Effects
Pal Ntsc & CyberGFX Compatible
Save Frames As IFF

*Extreme CD Only*
More Than 200 added Textures
The Programs To Conveart Your own IFF Pictures into Extreme Textures
Bippya-A New Tool To Genenerate New Wonderful Textures To Use In Extreme
Already Saved Animations To use In Your Productions
and much more.
*_/New Exereme Demo Out Soon*/_

*/_Extreme Out Septermer 99*/_


As we are still commited to Amiga gaming we will release 2 new games in
September

The first is to be *Goal 2000*

I'm not going to give you a run down of the features in Goal 2000 as it
is meaningless because Goal is quite simply the best Amiga Football 
game ever!  We have been working on the 2000 version for about 
8 months now  and I have been playing it for about 3 years, so I know a
thing or two about it (and also happen to be the world champion Goal
player!)

As the owner of Alive, I am looking forward to releasing Goal more than
any  other project. I will not bother to compare Goal to any other
footy game because they don't deserve to be on the same E-Mail.  Just
be prepared...it's coming!

_/*GOAL 2000 £14.99*/_

The Second is to be *Apano Sin*

A new Top View Shoot-Em-Up.  More news on this very soon....

And that's not all as Alive will now be selling Hardware and Serious
Software, The Pulse will go up to 24 pages, so no games will be lost. 
And best of all - it's still completely FREE!!

The Pulse Issue 6 will be out the first week in September and it
includes:

*Game Reviews*
T-Zero
Wasted Dreams
Virtual GP
Imperator
Red Mars
*Classic Reviews*
Capital Punishment
Zeewolf 2
*Buyers Guid*e
Directory Opus Magellan 2
Paloma IV TV card for Picasso
*NEWS*
Worms Armourgeddon
Heretic II
Nightlong
The Amiga NG
/and so much more/

Right it is one "big" channel:)

I pop in occasionally, but lately there haven't been many people online

Hello,

Has anyone had any experience with inkjet refil kits?  Do they work
without causing problems?  Is there a better way to go?

I have used refils in the past with my HP550C printer and they
worked out okay. The black worked much better than the color.
With the HP the kit came with a way to drill a hole in the top of
the cartridge and simply fill  the cart. They furnished a plug
for the hole. Okay, but messy! I did it over the kitchen sink
after learning my lesson. Working carefully was an absolute
necessity. NO rushing the job.

Color carts. were another matter. One kit I tried `popped' the
top of the cartridge off. Another drilled 3 holes. The 3 hole
version was inadvisable. The problem is that the space above the
3 color tanks is open. So if you fill a color too fast it spills
over into the adjacent color. You have to fill it so slow that
you can go crazy. With the popped top you can see what you are
doing, but it isn't any faster. Also the colors are different
from the manufacturer's colors. So if you have calibrated your
color printing it will be off.

I have not tried the kits with any other kind of printer.

I got my color kits from MEI/Micro Center. They also have lower
priced cartridges for some printers. They have a web site:

They also have a 800 #: 1-800-634-3478

Hope this helps.
