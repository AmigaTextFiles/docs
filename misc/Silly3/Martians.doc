Still today, many young Martians are told the strange story about Qh'Xzic%. It
is a very old story and some Martians even doubt if it is true.

Once upon a time, there was a famous land in Mars named the Land of Illusions.
There lived the happy king Pr'Zsud/. He had a beautiful daughter, princess
Oj'Lwer@. All the Martians in the Land of Illusions were happy.
  But one gwook (a Martian day, approximately 37.643 Earth hours) Oj'-Lwer@
decided to leave her father and go to the neighbouring land, the Land of
Mirages. At this point, when the princess had left, all the happy Martians in
the Land of Illusions turned sad.

In his great castle, king Pr'Zsud/ was feeling lonely. He couldn't even demand
her daughter back from the Land of Mirages's king, Ig'Tkad&, because Oj'Lwer@
had left there all by herself. He went to the zoo to become happier. There he
stared at the humans, the Saturnians, the Venusian pigs, the Jupiterians, the
Earth flies, the Uranian eagles...
  At this point, Pr'Zsud/ thought "Hmm. Those behimols (Martian for animals)
must be sad, because they are so lonely. I am lonely too, but why should they
be lonely?" Having thought this, king Pr'Zsud/ released all the behimols. They
were wild and jumped all around the castle. (Some elder Martians have told us
that they still can hear all the buzzing, ringing, mooing, talking, whispering,
clanging etc.)

A couple of gwooks later, Qh'Xzic% appeared (because the king had announced a
telepatery annoucement) and offered to get Oj'Lwer@ back. The king agreed, and
so Qh'Xzic% set off on a journey in his poor spacecraft.
  Suddenly, a dragon appeared and swallowed Qh'Xzic%'s spacecraft. After
floating down with his fiorasyte (Martian for parachute) Qh'Xzic% thought "Aah,
it doesn't matter, that spacecraft wasn't so expensive anyway."
  All by coincidence, he saw Oj'Lwer@ nearby. A helpful peasant from the Land
of Mirages, whose name was Tr'Mduh$, had brought her here. She said to Qh'Xzic%
"I was so bored. Ig'Tkad& didn't do anything to interest me. So I decided to
leave."

So, with a mere press of a button, Tr'Mduh$'s cart was mutated into a
spacecraft. Qh'Xzic% thought that it wasn't clean enough for the princess, but
it didn't matter. And, just as they got back, all the sad Martians in the Land
of Illusions turned happy.
  (Although some Martians believe that there was a difference of about 2.074
Earth minutes.)

But, to their surprise, Qh'Xzic% and Oj'Lwer@ found all the behimols jumping in
the castle. They, together with Pr'Zsud/ decided to leave the castle to the
behimols and find another castle. They are still looking for it.

That was all, and now may you Earthlings go to sleep. The Martians liked this
story, and you shall like it too.
