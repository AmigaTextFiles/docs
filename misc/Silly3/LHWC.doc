                    Life, Here We Come!

            A report of a world creation project
           issued at the Hypnos School for Deities
           approximately 3922.374 TMU Godly time
           =======================================


    *** World Creation Project ***

Student: Iehova     Religion: Christian     Allocated time: 5G years
Time of starting: 163.194 SMU years         Deadline: 5163.194 SMU
Goal: To create and sustain a habitable planet
Additional goal: To create and sustain life on aforementioned planet
Materials: A main-sequence star, spectral class G (name: Sol)
           5.974 quadrillion mass units of galactic dust


    Log Entry #00. Time 163.194
    State of World: Completely scattered dust.
    Density: .01%
    No additional data available

I have now began to create my world. I think I will just manage it before the
deadline. If only I could get to grips with the dust particles...

    Log Entry #01. Time 199.498
    State of World: Completely scattered dust.
    Density: %.02%
    No additional data available

There. I have got the particles moving. They are forming a vortex, I can see it
clearly now... But I thought it was supposed to be a sphere!

    Log Entry #02. Time 384.988
    State of World: Slowly contracting spherical vortex.
    Density: %.4%
    Temperature approximation: 20k Kelvin

It is now slowly starting to contract, thanks report! :-) Now I've only got to
worry about the temperature. It must reach at least 1M Kelvin before I can get
to make mountains, then it must cool down all the way to 300 Kelvin!
  Some task I've got to do...

    Log Entry #03. Time 963.121
    State of World: Slightly imperfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 20%
    Temperature approximation: 400k Kelvin
    Elements: Fe, Si, O, N, H, S, Cu, Au, Ag
              All muddled up

Wahey! I can see the elements now. I can remember reading somewhere that the
metals must go downwards and the antimetals float upwards. Maybe it'll do that
if left in peace.
  By the way, Allah in the neighbouring classroom is doing quite well. His
world is already cooling down, and he is enthuatistic about bringing water
there soon.

    Log Entry #04. Time 1183.099
    State of World: Slightly imperfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 35%
    Temperature approximation: 1.2M Kelvin
    Elements: Fe, Si slowly drifting downwards
              O, N, H, S staying up
              Cu, Au, Ag diminishing

This is fun! =)
  Now I'll get my world to have some volcanic activity. Thanks go to Brahma,
who reminded me.

    Log Entry #05. Time 1804.147
    State of World: Almost perfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 50%
    Temperature approximation: 1.1M Kelvin
    Elements: Fe, Si on 99.99% of planet volume
              O, N, H, S on skin taking .01% of volume
              Cu, Au, Ag reached insignificant levels
    Alert!: Volcanic activity started. Mountains and valleys are forming.

I think I'll do five large continents, and some islands and archipelagoes to
touch it up. I am already thinking of continent names... Maybe they'll all
begin with an A!
  But I've got to have some water first.

    Log Entry #06. Time 2576.471
    State of World: Almost perfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 60%
    Temperature approximation: 800k Kelvin
    Elements: See previous report, no changes
    Volcanic activity still functioning.

Now it's about time to have some water! How about something like 6 billion mass
units? That should do the trick.

    Log Entry #07. Time 3016.949
    State of World: Almost perfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 65%
    Temperature approximation: 3k Kelvin
    Elements: Quantities of H and O increased drastically.
    Volcanic activity stopped.
    Alert!: Raining started. Oceans forming.

Some of us here have made a delicate map of all those little continents and
oceans, but not me. I just wash, and go! 8->
  It will take some time for the temperature to reach 400 Kelvin, after which I
will stop the rain.

    Log Entry #08. Time 3405.738
    State of World: Almost perfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 67%
    Temperature approximation: 350 Kelvin
    Elements: See previous report, no changes
    Raining stopped.
    Five large continents, two large oceans.
    58% of skin under water.

Now this is what I call a planet! It's so beautiful I could almost eat it!
  Maybe next we'll have some life. I think I'll start slowly and calmly with
single-celled life, and then move on to multi-celled life. Civilisation will
feature only at the last minute.

    Log Entry #09. Time 4358.696
    State of World: Almost perfectly-formed sphere.
    Density: 68%
    Temperature approximation: 290 Kelvin
    Elements: See previous report, no changes

Wow! I've finally achieved the original goal! I have a steady, fully functional
planet. Now for the additional goal.....
  Life, Here We Come!
