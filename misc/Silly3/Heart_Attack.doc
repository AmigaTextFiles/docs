It was peaceful in the zoo this time of the day. All the irritating brats had
long since gone to bed and one had time to think one's own thoughts.
  Dr. Henri Härtz, who was on vacation from the hospital, where he worked, was
walking back and forth in the zoo, enjoying what he saw and what he thought. He
walked past several cages, until he arrived to the bird cage. Then he stopped
to look at the birds.

"Those birds look happy", thought Dr., "since they sing so much to themselves."
He thought, what it could be the result of. Becouse he was poetical and didn't
know a great deal about anatomy, he thought it was the result of their hearts.
  Then he had a sudden inspiration attack. If a bird heart could make a bird
happy, why not a human too? This was a great idea! He would transfer a bird
heart to a human!

Happy and in a hurry Dr. left the zoo and stepped into the only train which
went to the hospital. He used public transport a lot, because it was easy to
use. (And Dr.'s knowledge about automobile mechanics was near that of a water-
melon.)
  When he arrived in the hospital Dr. opened the huge wooden door which lead to
the anticipation room of the operation theatre. Inside he was greeted by an 86-
year old woman with a heart failure.
  "There's a brilliant test person for the operation!" thought Dr. He opened
the vast steel door leading to the operation theatre and moved his patient
there. After putting his patient to sleep Dr. carefully removed her own heart
and transferred a bird heart he had stolen from the zoo to replace it.

After the operation had lasted for an hour and a half the job was finished. The
patient awoke and greeted Dr. Dr. greeted her back. After paying for the
operation the patient went to her home.
  Just at her home door the woman's organs started to reject the bird heart.
With blood streams snapping apart at a great speed the woman had the worst
heart attack of her life and fell dead on her home door.

Dr. Henri Härtz slowly lowered the newspaper back to his desk. He had found the
death announcement he had been looking for. "Hmm", he thought, "apparently bird
hearts cannot be transferred to humans."
  Two months later two police officers came to visit Dr.'s home, and took him
to visit a judge. Dr. got a sentence which was put immediately into action.
