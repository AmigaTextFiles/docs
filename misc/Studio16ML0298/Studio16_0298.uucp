These warnings *ARE* the VIRUS! A bunch of people sending a bunch of
largish, brain-draining email with blind intensity, sucking up hard drive
space on servers all over the world, and eating up bandwidth. Its become a
chain-letter scheme on most every ML I'm on, and in private email.

I especially want Amiga people to think about it: what IBM-compatible
executable is going to wipe out an Amiga? And how else would a piece of
email "do" anything, except by having an attached file that you would
execute. If your mailer executes all email attachments automatically --
well, I guess you already have a problem: You haven't established the proper
dominant relationship with your software.

But you have had reliable recording and platback of multiple tracks, and no
weird occurences; ie, stops recording without you stopping it manually?

A complete hoax that has been floating around the internet
for at least a year now. Some idiot on a news station in VA, USA
made an erronious report about it recently and here we go again.
Mail will not harm any machine. Only the attached programs,
or documents that acompany the mail could possible pose a threat.
And only then if you open the attached infected program or
MS WORD doc. If you get stange mail with attachments, save the
attachment and viro-scan it first. Or delete it completly.

A genlock is a device that synchronizes the Amiga with an external timing
source.  SMPTEout is not free running - it uses the Amiga for timing.  Thus
with a genlock you are able to have SMPTEout use an external timing signal.
The possibility here is that this external signal may be more accurate over
a longer period of time than your Amiga would be.

SMPTEout's timing is only as accurate as your Amiga's timing. I have never
had a problem with it. :)

I've got the same set up (my Fireball is a 1.2g) with 4meg of ram
(w/2m chip).  Using long samples as opposed to many small samples,
I can get reliable playback of 7 tracks.  The channel buffer in 
Studio16 must be set down to 256k.  

I suspect that (for me anyway) ram is the bottle neck that limits 
playback.

There are two main prompts you will get when S16 decides it cannot
handle the amount of tracks you have set.

(Not word for word) "Stopping track___  IO Overload"
                    "Stopping track___  Out of RAM"

Setting your channel buffer to a higher value will ease up the IO
overload if you have the ram available to do that.  The scsi 
throughput and the amount of buffering are directly related.

Studio 16 needs plenty of room in ram to keep things coming into
and flushed out of memory before overworking your scsi interface.

Hello Jacob;


-->A genlock is a device that synchronizes the Amiga with an external timing
source.  SMPTEout is not free running - it uses the Amiga for timing.  Thus
with a genlock you are able to have SMPTEout use an external timing signal.
The possibility here is that this external signal may be more accurate over
a longer period of time than your Amiga would be.

I see. Thanks for the elucidation.  :>)


-->SMPTEout's timing is only as accurate as your Amiga's timing. I have never
had a problem with it. :)

Is this the same crystal which controls the date clock? My date keeps fluctuating
randomly on a per bootup basis (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind), and I don't
think it's the battery (changed it). If so, that might partly explain why it seems
it's only MY SMPTEOut which is unreliable.

Kenny - I don't know how this works yet - you may post portions of this
in the newsletter if you wish - I'll just send stuff to your automated
system or whatever in the future. 

Do you know anything about the Maestro Pro digital I/O from Macrosystems?

I'm thinking of buying one 2nd hand, but I have to act fast.
I've located one 2nd hand - for approx $400.00 american.

It has an RCA S/PDIF in and an optical in,
but only an optical out. It's supposedly top quality, and enables you
to back up your hard drive to audio DAT, among other things. 

They say it will work with anything that is AHI-compatible - such as Sound
Studio, Audiolab 16, Samplitude Pro SMPTE, Play16 . . .etc. 

IS Studio 16 AHI-compatible?

I am VERY interested in any potential upgrades, plug-ins, etc. to Studio 16 -
such as time compression . . . ??? I am impressed with the sound quality,
of the converters, the stability of the program, and it's useability with
Bars & Pipes.

However, I can't get the SMPTE out to export a SMPTE audio signal through
the right RCA output on my AD516 card, which works fine otherwise. Seems
like a software glitch rather than a hardware thing. Do you know how I could
get help with this?

                        Sincerely,
                        Dean Anderson

Marcia McCarry or Dean Anderson,

I'm waiting for your email address from Kenny (since it wasn't in the
post).  But since you mentioned you were in a hurry... I can get you a
NEW Maestro Pro for less than the US$400 for the USED one you mentioned.

I can also answer your other questions too...

I'll be in touch when Kenny gets back to me.

> Hey what is this Maestro Pro? Is it better than the AD516? What software

Well better in that it is full digital in/out... it has NO analog
connectors at all.  This means ZERO noise added when recording - it's
digital.  Great if you want to do full digital transfers of audio from
CD to create your own CDs.

It comes with its own software (similar to Studio16 - not as good
though) called Samplitude (development now taken over by a new
company).

I'll be using the card in combination with the AD516s like this:

1) Record audio to DAT  - much higher quality than digitizing with
   AD516.

2) Digital transfer from DAT to Amiga via MaestroPro

3) Convert to Studio16 file format

4) Edit and audition with AD516 and Studio16.

5) Mix down to stereo tracks.

6) Convert back to MaestroPro format

7) Digitally transfer back to DAT master via MaestroPro.

SUPER QUALITY all the way.


It also has backup software which will allow you to do backups to audio
DAT recorders.

Most importantly, unlike the AD516, it is supported by the upcoming
ProStation audio system.  Which from what I'm finding out is going to
be the #1 audio software for the Amiga.

The card is supported by AHI and also maestix as well.  One of the best
things about this is that you can use the freeware maestix software to
remove or add SCMS digital copy protection.  This software can also
perform many real-time effects including Karaoke (voice removal) and
many other neeto things.

I think these cards were originally over US$1000 new.

If you are serious about purchasing one... I can give you more details.
Please email me directly with questions.

Have you or anyone else experimented with larger channel buffer sizes?  I have
more than enough RAM for 1mg each channel, but as per the Studio 16 manuals,
it suggests having it set that high isn't always beneficial.  Why?

Be careful! I'm pretty sure the Maestro Pro has only an in or an out,
NOT both! It's the reason I don't have one, because it doesn't have
both.

If you are SURE it has both a S/PDIF digital IN  *and* an S/PDIF
digital OUT, then my info is wrong, and I want to buy one too!

Up to here, you are wrong, it has both IN and OUT... but, then you go
on to say...

> If you are SURE it has both a S/PDIF digital IN  *and* an S/PDIF
> digital OUT, then my info is wrong, and I want to buy one too!

Which makes you right, too...  It has TWO digital INs and one digital
OUT.  There is a COAXIAL IN and an OPTICAL IN.  The OUT is OPTICAL.

This is fine for most applications.  The only device I have that
doesn't have optical connectors is my portable DAT deck.  My CD
players, full size DAT, DAC and amplifier all have OPTICAL connectors
(or both COAXIAL and OPTICAL).

If you need a COAXIAL OUT... you can get coverters.

Well, I didn't expect to get so many emails about the Maestro Pro. 
Sorry Kenny!

I'd like to take this out of the Studio 16 list... so if you are
seriously interested in buying a NEW Maestro Pro email me directly at:

   sales@youngmonkey.ca    or    dhomas@youngmonkey.ca

I'll put together some details about the card, the included software
and other fun stuff... and the price (determined by how many people
want them) < US$400.

If you have specific questions, send them directly to me please.

Thanks for clearing that up. I have a Tascam DA-30 Mark2 which sports:
Coaxial in/out (RCA connectors)
AES/EBU in/out (XLR connectors)

and an Alesis ADAT with optical connectors (but using a proprietary
data format to deal with 8 tracks).

What I'd really like to see is a board just like the WaveCenter (for
PC). Check out http://www.frontierdesign.com/   ... this is the board
I need. Wish we could convince them to make an Amiga version.

> If you need a COAXIAL OUT... you can get coverters.
I'm probably going to wait for awhile in the hopes a board that's
actually still in production grows some digital I/O, or a new board
comes along with the connections I need. But just for curiosity sake,
do you know a ballpark price for this converter?

Thanks a bunch!

OK, can you be more detailed as to how you have your system configured?  I can
only get three channels to play on my system. When I try to play the 4th, it
errors out with the I/O error. According to SYSINFO, my hard drive transfers
1.75MB/Sec. When I had the AD516 installed in my 2000 w/DKB Rapid Fire SCSI,
SYSINFO said I was getting 1.5MB/Sec transfer, and I was able to play back 6
tracks. (although I was using 1MB buffers). If I could get 7 tracks with 256k
buffers, like you say your getting, then I should beable to get 8 tracks with
512kb.

My drive is a Fireball 1280S, ver630C ,2 partitions- 1001m for
recording formatted with BigBlocks -International FFS, and a 220m
for Audio system software using Amiga Dos format -International FFS

According to SYSINFO, my 1001m partition transfers 2.17MB/Sec. 
I am using 60 buffers.

ICache - On
DCache - On
IBurst - On
DBurst - Off

This is a stock 3000 68030, FPU 68881, MMU disabled, using the
built in scsi controller. 

Amiga Dos 3.1 was added 

The 4m of RAM is 32Bit Local 


I purchased the 3000 from a friend last August.  He wasn't using
it much, in fact he really never got very adept at setting up
computers, so except for having 3.1 installed and my putting the
Fireball in, I think it's a pretty stock set up.

My main computer is a 4000 that I have put considerable more time
and money into to get performance, yet the 3000 has proven itself
time and again to be a solid work horse.

Let me know if there is something I have left out here.

Pardon me for jumping in here...

My a3000 has finally returned to 'operational' status and I was able to run
a battery of performance tests, the results of which you may find
interesting.

I was able to playback 8 tracks continuously.  I am using an a3000/25 with
10M ram (2M chip) connecting to an old Seagate ST41650 1.3 G scsi hard disk
via the a3000 scsi controller.

The channel buffer size is set to 512K.
The hard disk has reselection enabled.
The partition is using a blocksize of 8192 bytes.
The DMA Mask for the partition is set to 0x7FFFFFFE.
The Max Transfer for the partition is set to 0x00FFFFFF
Addbuffers reports the partition has 32 buffers
Diskspeed 4.2 reports a read speed of ~2.2M/s with 70% CPU available.
There were 8 separate samples played back using the cuelist.
The samples were recently sampled or copied to the partition.
The samples have not been edited.

Initially, I had the channel buffer size set to 256k, and one channel would
consistently drop out.
During the test the hard disk activity led would often go out for a second
or two, indicating the channel buffers were being kept full during playback.

Doing the math shows that a hard disk able to push one megabyte per second
is sufficient for supplying sample data for eight-track playback.
((88200 sample bytes x 8 channels) x 1.5 overhead) = 1,058,400 bytes/second.

However, once the sample data is in memory, there must be enough bandwidth
available for the processor to read the data from the disk buffer and write
it to the audio card.
((88200 sample bytes x 8 channels) x 2) = 1,411,200 bytes/second.


Ben.

The reason is that the buffers need to be filled up and while filling them
up the CPU get loaded which mean if the buffer is too large it may not be
enough (CPU) time for the other tasks. Then you get glitches. The difference
is also more noticable on non-DMA cards (which loads the CPU more) compared
to DMA based cards.

I'd like to get an IDE interface for my 3000/040.
I can easily upgrade my recording space using
cheaper IDE drives. But, will IDE be fast enough?
is S16 going to care if it's an IDE or SCSI drive
I'm using? I already use IDE on my toaster system,
but that's a different animal. Any guidance?

thanks 
troy

Troy, don't bother with IDE.

The extra expense of SCSI drives is less than what it would
cost to buy an IDE interface for your A3000.

Since you have an 040, any Zorro2 harddrive controller will
take a large performance hit. There are no Zorro3 IDE controllers.

You wouldn't replace your 040 with an 030 because the 030 is cheaper?

You already have SCSI, take advantage of it. :)

Thanks Ben... This is very helpful. Could you tell me what WD SCSI chip revision you are using? Do you have the latest version 8? Also, could termination problems cause slower access?

SCSI controllers (the circuitry you see on the bottom of the drive) and SCSI
hosts (the card or motherboard circuitry) seem to be able to multithread
(read and write multiple threads "simultaneously") better than their IDE
equivalents. I'm guessing that the IDEs will pull more CPU time during
transfers.

Warranty periods are usually 5 year on top-gun SCSI drives, 3 on IDE. Hmmm.
This in spite of the fact that top EIDEs (E=enhanced) run at 5400 rpm and
top SCSIs at 7200, 8750, even 10,500 rpm for the latest ultras.

Nothing that I've ever seen cares whether it is reading data off an IDE
drive or a SCSI drive. On an A4000 with a new generation EIDE, one can
expect pretty good performance (the motherboard's IDE design being the
bottleneck), but loads down when asked to multithread.

But the onboard SCSI on the 3000 is just an intergrated
2091 (Zorro II) isn't it? Our saying old onboard SCSI is
better than a new IDE? I have a 1.2 EIDE ready to go. Just add
a $80 IDE card and i"m ready to go.
What about Updating my WD scsi chip? WiIl updating the WD
scsi controller gain me any thing?

There was talk of a digital I/O for the Prelude board.
The other possibility might be a driver for an ISA PC board for use with Boxer
or Golden Gate. I don't know whether the bus speed would be sufficient in this
case. There will probably be Amigas with PCI slots next year, but drivers
still have to be written.

Hello Travis

-->Have you or anyone else experimented with larger channel buffer sizes?  I have
-->more than enough RAM for 1mg each channel, but as per the Studio 16 manuals,
-->it suggests having it set that high isn't always beneficial.  Why?

I have enough RAM in my A2000 to run each channel on 4MB, but I've found it's not
really practical. The reason is that it takes too long to finish playing once
you've pressed the Stop button. On my system, Studio16 gets a bit nervous if you
try to press the Play button before all tracks have finished playing. Tracks will
be left unassigned, Studio16 might lock up, or the system itself might crash. Not
always a pretty sight, so it's best to let it empty out the buffers, and finish
playing.

As a consequence, I usually stay at 2MB per track (or even 1MB sometimes). The
tradeoff is more frequent access to the SCSI drive, but if your SCSI controller,
and HDs are fast enough, you shouldn't notice a problem.

The a3000 is not just an integrated 2091.  It does use the same
scsi chip, but the similarities end there.  First of all the fact that
it is an integrated component with direct access to motherboard
resources gives a huge advantage over any zorro (II or III) plug
in scsi card.  The DMA controller in the a3000 is capable of burst
transfers to motherboard memory.

Unless things have changed drastically, most Amiga IDE controllers
use programmed IO rather than DMA to transfer the data to/from
the hard disk.  This means the CPU ends up doing all the work that
would have been handled by the DMAC.  Even if the IDE cards are
capable of performing DMA, a Zorro II card in an a3000 will most
likely suffer the same performance problems affecting a 2091 in an
a3000 or a4000 -- There is usually no memory (other than chip ram)
in the Zorro II memory space, which will either force the transfer to
be buffered through chip ram or force the use of programmed IO --
either way, disk performance will suck dead frogs through cheap
plastic straws...  There is also the possibility that the IDE hard disk
may not be capable of DMA operations...  With IDE it takes two to
tango...

Ben.

OK.... I am really starting to get frusterated with all of the SMPTE crap!!  I went out and purchased a Fostex SMPTE generator hoping my problem was with the SMPTEout module as Serge suggested. Well... the Fostex didn't help at all!

So far I have come to the conclusion that the TEAC 80-8 reel-to-reel is not 
stable enough to keep the SMPTE code constant. I am able to record SMPTE 
to the TEAC and use that as my source for a little while.... Maybe long enough 
to record 2 - 3 tracks. During this time the sync is right-on.... No drifting and no 
SMPTE Too Fast/ Too Slow errors. Then all of the sudden, out of the blue, I 
will get the dreaded Too Fast/Too Slow error and at the same time, my tracks 
start to drift. From this point on I will always get Too Fast/Too Slow SMPTE
error and track drifting unless I record new SMPTE track to the reel-to-reel and 
start over again. And the process repeats itself, allowing me to work for a little 
while..... etc.....

Tell me if this sounds like a possibility......

The tape on the reel-to-reel is stretching over time, (rewind -> play 15-20 times), and causes the SMPTE to become un-readable and the tracks to appear to drift. Since the AD516 can only play back at exactly the specified rate, in this case 44100. It has to be the tape that is changing, and the only thing that would cause this is motor speed, or tape stretching or shrinking..... right? Or is this a completely crazy idea?

The reason I ruled out motor speed, it that the motors are direct drive, balanced motors that work off of the AC frequency, (according to the TEAC dealer) and are rock solid.

Thanks in advance....

-->SMPTEout module as Serge suggested. Well... the Fostex didn't help at all!

Hello Gord;

Did the place where the SMPTE Too Slow error shows up change at all from last time
(when you were using SMPTEOut)? Ex: With SMPTEOut, it showed up at 2 minutes, and
with the new Generator, it shows up at ??? minutes?


-->So far I have come to the conclusion that the TEAC 80-8 reel-to-reel is not 
-->stable enough to keep the SMPTE code constant. I am able to record SMPTE 
-->to the TEAC and use that as my source for a little while.... Maybe long enough 
-->to record 2 - 3 tracks. During this time the sync is right-on.... No drifting  

Hmm. This is interesting. Are you saying you can record the first 2 or 3 tracks
all the way through without the dreaded error?

Even when your TEAC has been running a while? A few hours?



-->start to drift. From this point on I will always get Too Fast/Too Slow SMPTE
-->error and track drifting unless I record new SMPTE track to the reel-to-reel 


Do you get it right away? Right at the beginning (ex: after 10 seconds?)? Is is
always at the same spot?


-->The tape on the reel-to-reel is stretching over time, (rewind -> play 15-20
-->times), and causes the SMPTE to become un-readable and the tracks to appear to 

Well, tape does wear out over time, but not usually at the rate you suggest. The
oxide will probably start to wear off your tape long before you notice any
appreciable effects from stretching.

Does the same thing happen wirh a new tape? 3 times good, then the 4th time bad?

-->case 44100. It has to be the tape that is changing, and the only thing that
-->would cause this is motor speed, or tape stretching or shrinking..... right? Or
-->is this a completely crazy idea?

Not crazy. 

-->The reason I ruled out motor speed, it that the motors are direct drive,
-->balanced motors that work off of the AC frequency, (according to the TEAC
-->dealer) and are rock solid.

How about an obvious question. How steady is your 120VAC? Variations in line
voltage, and frequency are very common. I'm not sure how the TEAC synchs up, but
if it's relying strictly on the zero-crossing of the AC signal (60Hz), your "rock
solid" motor speed is only as solid as your incoming AC. Strictly a guess here.
Perhaps a qualified TEAC tech would have more insightful information.

Another thing to consider. Having your TEAC calibrated is an inexpensive option.
It may be unlikely, but it will help rule out the possibilty that your record
speed and playback speed are not the same. On my Fostex R-8, there are two trim
pots which they use to adjust the speed. I'm sure yours has a similiar design.
When I took both my R-8's in, one was too slow, and one was a little too fast (and
it was brand new!).

>From what I can tell with the descriptions you've provided so far, the problem(s)
point more to erratic motor speed than to anything else. If it was tape stretch,
as unlikely as it is, you would always get the same problem every time, not just
occasionally. Also, for the tape to stretch as much as you suggest, you would
probably start to hear an audible warbling in your audio tracks. Do they SOUND OK?

What is the history of your TEAC? Is it old? Are the pinch roller and capstan 
cleaned regularly? The pinch roller is the round wheel, made of rubber, and is
responsible for pulling your tape along. After a few years, especially if it's not
cleaned, the rubber accumulates metal oxide particles from the tape, and begins to
harden up, meaning that it won't pull on the tape as smoothly as it should. This
can also cause erratic slippage. The pinch roller is inexpensive, and is simple to
change. I appologize if I'm already telling you things you already know. I don't
know what your technical background is.

Don't get too discouraged, Gord. You may have had a combination of problems. It's
just a question of eradicating them one by one. If it helps, ever since I've
striped my R-8 machines with the Fostex 4010 Generator, I haven't had any more Too
Slow errors. Your new generator definitely won't be a waste of money.

Let me know what you find out.

I used my Studio 16/AD516 with B&P Pro with only a 16-ch MIDI interface for 2
years - looking for an old Blue Ribbon Triple Play 48-channel MIDI interface -
(the ONLY >16 MIDI interface that will work with this program) -

- until I found out that Werner Gusset - octave2.ch/octave/index.html - is
now making them! - same electronic design, same function. He's got some kind
of agreement with microsoft/blue ribbon guys. 

I bought one for $166.00 plus shipping and am now happily tracking with
48 MIDI channels! It has one in, one thru, and 3 outs - one for each 16-
channel bank.

No, I am not getting any percentage or kickbacks from this - 
Just thought someone like me might want to know.

There used to be a guy in Canada here somewhere who was selling TPP
"compatibles" for $50 or so.  There's only about $10 worth the parts in
there.

Yes, it did change, but it always changes, although it is always after about 4

The drifting starts about 2 minutes in.... and the Too Fast/Too Slow error
starts sometime after 4 minutes.

OK. Here's a test you can try:

1. Plug the output of your new Fostex generator into the AD516. The Fostex is now
SMPTE Master. The TEAC is not used.

2. Record a few 5 minute tracks onto the AD516. Ideally, you should be recording
against a sequenced drumbeat.

3. Play them back using the Fostex as SMPTE Master, and verify that you don't get
drift, or Too Slow errors.

4. Play them back using the Studio16 Internal SMPTE Generator. It now is SMPTE
Master. Any drift? Any Too Slow errors? If not, you know your Fostex is at least
as accurate as the Internal SMPTE Generator (as well it should).

5. Re-stripe your TEAC using the new Fostex generator. I know you've done it
already, but keep as many constants as possible.

6. Plug the TEAC into the AD516. The TEAC is now SMPTE Master. Any drift? Any Too
Slow errors?

If Test #6 is the culprit, I would definitely look towards motor speed
fluctuations on the TEAC. Next step would be to find out why. Any changes to the
TEAC recently? Was it banged? Dropped? Did this start to happen all at once, or
did the problem slowly "drift" into view (pun intended). You know, happened once a
long time ago, and never happened again, until today. That sort of thing.

Weeell . . . interesting. I pasted that e-mail address from the "nicknames"
in my e-mail program - the one I have used to send e-mail to this guy -
and it always got through, and he answered.

So, does everyone make their own TPP's for $10.00 and a set of instructions?

I don't feel too bad - my other 16-ch jobs were around $100.00 each.

Maurizio,

<<<<<<< This is the first request for supporting Roland material. Maybe
they just use some standard format. Please let me know.>>>>

It is not that I am interested in using anything Roland, that was just an
example of the end result. 

What is desired would be a situation where the user could record his own
sample range (So that he could sample one and spread them from C5-A6
((musical notes)) then another for B6-F6 etc.) unlike Roland, Korg and the
rest who usually sample one note and spread them out from A2-B7 or some such
nonsense. Most of the commercial tone generators are terrible and have 20
usable tones if you are lucky. (Usable for any length of time in a
composition.) 

Now if the user could make his own sample range, feed midi data to it and
have the samples play back (much like bars&pipes with a tone generator) then
we would all be in heaven and could actually do some amazing things!

One way that it might be done (though not the only way) would be to record
the samples to a CD and then retreive the samples when needed via software
as the Sequencer (preferrably Bars&PipesProfessional) demanded.

Steve

Sorry, I goofed. Here's Werner's REAL e-mail addr.: octave2@bluewin.ch
in case anyone wants it.

What can I say? I'm not an electronics engineer, or a programmer.
I'm admit I'm just a musician - obviously rather uninformed at that - which
is why I joined this mailing list - perhaps too late, in this instance.

I don't feel too bad - my other 16-channel MIDI's cost around $100.00 ea.

Anyway, thanks for the enlightenment. 

What do we plebes know, anyway?

I don't know what to make of this. 
Obviously, I'm not an electronics engineer, or a programmer - wish I was.
I'm just a lowly musician who happens to be an Amiga user.


Here's Werner's REAL e-mail addr. - sorry, I goofed: octave2@bluewin.ch

Maybe you could talk him down a little.

Yes, the A3k SCSI is an integrated 2091.

The key word is integrated.  It is directly on the bus and doesn't have to
go through Zorro.  An 040 has to go through numerous steps and protocol
conversions to get data on/off the Zorro2 bus.  CBM designed a special
memory interface to suck data off the SCSI bus.  It was the fastest of its
time in the class of computer it was in.

Ask all the people out there with A2091s and GVP 4008s how fast they are on
their 040 systems. (Your built in A3k SCSI is easily 2-3 times faster).

A new SCSI chip will not speed things up.  Enabling synchronous mode will
give you a good speed boost, but unless your cabling and termination is
100% perfect you will have problems (data corruption or SCSI bus lockups).

I can understand you want to use that IDE drive you have that is otherwise
doing nothing. But, you will not gain any speed using IDE. You will have a
slow hard drive that uses more CPU and wastes a slot in your A3k.

If you think your Toaster system which uses IDE is doing fine, you would be
blown away if you had a decent Zorro3 SCSI card (or CPU card with SCSI).
Effects, framestores, anims, etc.  all load incredibly faster.  (That
annoying pause between loading an effect and running it is gone!)

This is not to say IDE in general is slow, it's not.  It is to say all
Amiga implementations of IDE are.  :)

Given an otherwise equivalent system, SCSI will always be faster do the
extra intelligence and flexibility SCSI allows.

If a slow 1.2g hard drive is worth $80, then you know the answer to the
question you orginally asked.

This is not true of the type of midi keyboard or rack-module you should be
using. If you are buying cheap multimedia-playback GM (general-midi)
modules, you are getting what you pay for. Buy an actual sampler from any of
these companies and others, and you will get a superlative tool.

If you are suggesting using the AD516 for this, it is -- as I replied to
your last post on the same stuff -- a poor use of resources. Ben and
Maurizio have said something like this also.

The AD516 is designed to record and playback from hard-drive like a
multitrack- or mastering-deck. It is not designed to play back with the
polyphony demanded of a mapped sampler (32 voices and up, from sometimes as
many samples, each with its own "looping".) This all needs to occur in ram,
not from a disk BTW -- it would be a nightmare to suggest otherwise.

See above. You are mistaking a nailgun for a sawz-all.

Just for the record, the official name is "Sample Wrench". We dropped
the "MIDI"
when we added SCSI (SMDI) support a couple of versions ago ;-). BTW, the
latest
upgrade supports direct save/load of S16 format files.

A lot of different samplers have walked in and out of here over the
years, and
it's true that you get what you pay for. One of the nicer "inexpensive"
units
is the Peavey DPM-SP (around $1k MSRP). There are also several nice
units from
E-Mu, Akai, Kurzweil, et.al. in the $1.5 to $3k range. These things are
designed
for performing musicians, not as an alternate type of multi-track. The
AD516 is
decidedly _not_ designed for this.

Hey, Jim, glad to see you here on the list! What you saw there is a sad but
typical case of /Oldogus Newtrichenitous./ You'd think I would have got it

Not to mention Ensoniq. It was the first company to really get the price
where real people could use samplers. {Now they also build General Midi
stuff -- the End of Music is at hand!}

Has dissidents worked with the Korg Trinity? This looks like a great engine.

I personally have not used the Peavey DPM-SP, but I remember talking with
you about it, and SMDI (using SCSI instead of midi to transfer samples and
mapping is much great. I have used Wrench in conjunction with my DPM V3. It
is actually a wavetable synth with a twist: one meg of static ram for
storage of user waveforms. Peavey is a great company too.

When I lost an Amiga during a thunderstorm I became a fanatic about UPS and
voltage regulators. Try one. 
There are plenty of brown outs around here and the various protective devices
I have hooked up all emit periodic alarms. I had a shorting problem on a heat
pump here at the office that created all sorts of problems. Any start up
capacitor could cause a momentary voltage drop. The device doesn't even need
to be on the same metered circuit to cause a momentary voltage drop, as I can
attest due to the fact that I am in an all-electric area, and sudden voltage
drops happen when everybody's AC or heat pump kicks in at once.

All true.

Yeah, this is a prerequisite for anyone using computers, music equipment, or
anything else with microchips. And it just doesn't do to buy the cheap stuff
either. I had a studio in a building that also housed a pizzeria. When the
manager fired up the pizza ovens in the afternoon, surges and spikes,
followed by near-brownout were the result.

We installed voltage-logging equipment for 5 days to see what else was going
on, in what power and phone techs referred to as the Freemont Hellhole.
Typically 130-135 volts is what we found. This is seriously going to affect
the longevity of any silicon lifeforms! A cleanly-regulated electrical
environment is essential if you want to enforce a "No Gremlins!" policy.

Again, I advocate Balanced Power, as it takes care of this better than
anything else, and it gets rid of all grounding problems, which can also
glitch hardware operations. You get an incredible boost in signal-to-noise,
of course!  8D

Gord,

I just did a half hour test and there was no problems. I ran the test only
once.

My test config:
        - Teac A3440 (4 tracks), set at highspeed (15") pitch off
          Reel-to-reel is lying horizontally.
        - An old BASF Studio tape (Gevaert) with physical cuts from the good
          old days ;)
        - PAL
        - SMPTE LTC recorded/played back at -7 dB on Teac, no EQ, no DBX
        - Cheap phonocable used for test/LTC
        - Cuelist set up at 30 minuttes, no entries

If you like I can run a longer test (1 hour at slow speed 7").

We can rule out tape and cablenoise. I also think we can rule out the
SMPTEOutput if the problem is not in the PAL sync vs. NTSC sync code (the DF
problematics). Have you tried with PAL ?

Dean

What can I say: It's right, the cost of the parts in quantities of hundert
are maybe 20$. If you produce a printed circuit (ehich has first to be
designed) or if you wire all part yourself together makes a lot of
difference. To drill the holes into a box and to make the printed label for
the box is another additional cost. You can save this when you build your
own box and have time and tools. If you have all part together, you solder
everything together wire tha cable and the plug. Now you are ready to test it.
Everything of this work you can do yourself if you know how, if you have
access to all the parts, if you have all the tools and if you have the
knowledge. No problem. And I agree, you may have 20-30$ to spend. It' maight
be possible, that prices are cheaper in the states as the are in Switzerland.
But the way I have produced them, several people where involfed. The person
designing the print, the company producing the print, the person designing
the paper with the holes in the case, the company drilling the cases, a
person designing the label and printing them out, someone had to put the
oprder together for all the parts, someone did all the wiring and someone
had to test it. Everybody in this chain wanted to make some money, it's
theyre business.
I had to invest some of my money and to calculate  a price for it to make
shure that after a certain time I have my investment returned. I can tell
you that I hesitated almost a year to take the risk.
I made a little advertising, the Internet helped me to sell units - but the
Internet does cost me money and time too. I give support, there is a
warranty on the unit and it is cheaper as it was at the Blue Ribbon
WoundWorks-Time!

Now I ask you, is it wrong, to make 35% profit out of a 10'000$-project? And
it is yet not shure, if I realy do.

Please, I'm not complaining nor do I justify my pricing. I know it is a fair
price. I also know, that one can build it cheap.
I only wanted to show you that things are not always looking so easy and
clear as they might look the first time.

I hope you can understand what I'm trying to explain here. I have learned my
english myself and never went to school for it. I appologize for all the
mistakes.

Have a good and relaxing time.

Best regards

Well, there are various reasons, phylosophical and technical.


If device-independent audio support would be present in the OS
it would be seriously considered.

As this solution has never been available we had to work on a
proprietary architecture, that expanded to cover also boards
not supported by AHI such as the SoundStage and SoundStagePro
analog/digital cards.

The driver is a very key subsystem (for example, it provides a
timing base to the whole application) so we want to keep complete
control on the implementation.

We want to be able to modify the architecture (AudioLabs' drivers
are stand-alone processes) at any time in order to implement any
possible improvement we can think at, all this in a way completly
transparent to the final user. We take care of keeping all our
applications compatible.


BTW:
We'll provide an appropriate layer for 3rd parties to develop
their plug-ins but they will have to run "above" ProStation,
not "below".


AudioLabs also sells licenses involving the drivers communication
protocols. And customized versions, locked to certain drivers,
are available for some very specific market segments.

In order to put the interested manifacturers in the condition
of getting immediatly up and running with software for their
new board, the driver itself must be SIMPLE, requiring almost
no time to be developed.


Another important point is that AudioLabs prefers to "own" the
technologies used in its products.

We want to (and we do) cooperate with serious 3rd parties but
we also want our future to depend as less as possible on 3rd
parties' reliability.



Greenboy, I recall your nice posting about how much care must
be reserved to cabling, grounding, etc... expecially when
dealing with analog signals (I completly agree).

Now think at our approach as a similar attempt to preserve the
Quality (not just technical), taking care of every single component.







>>We don't make drivers, the hardware manifacturers do after we

>So, have you with Ben Fuller here at the ml? Or any other former

No, I didn't yet but I'll do it.

I don't think dr. Fuller can (or would like to) be considered a
manifacturer otherwise he would be expected to invest funds in
AudioLabs in order to write a driver for "his" board :-)

Seriously, I'll contact him in order to understand if he would
agree to discuss a possible cooperation.



All the best,

dr. Maurizio Ciccione
AudioLabs, Digital Audio Engineering

Oboy, here we go...

>Dean
>
>What can I say:.....etc..etc.

Actually, this reply seems to be addressed to Dean (Anderson?) when he
originally was promoting the Octave2 TPP by saying how happy he was
with his and sharing the availability information with the rest of us.
It was Dhomas Trenn who mentioned the price of components but that's
not what's important here.

What is important is that Werner Gusset and Octave2 have taken the chance
of investing money and effort to supply the dwindling number of Amiga
MIDI users with a tool we thought we might not see again. There are
fewer and fewer companies willing to do so. I have seen many individuals
pleading for used Triple Play Plus interfaces in the Amiga music and
marketplace newsgroups ever since Blue Ribbon stopped making them.
I was one of them, and had I not been lucky enough to find one, I would
be buying one from Werner right now. (I looked for over 2 years!)

$166 doesn't seem so out of line if you compare it to the prices of
interfaces for the Mac that provide that many channels. (I don't know
what Windows interfaces with this ability cost.) AND I'm not trying to
start a debate about this point either! We all condone or reject the
price of an item by our decision to purchase it or to let it sit on
the dealer's shelf. Personally, I'd rather play however many gigs it
takes to make up the price difference between parts and the finished
product and let Octave2 make it for me. (With my soldering and circuit
building skills, I'm sure I'd spend less time playing the gigs.)

Some individuals here have debated about bringing back the AD516 board.
Not enough market seems to be the main deterrent for that to happen.
Werner and Octave2 HAVE actually brought back the Triple Play Plus.
I'd just like to thank Werner for his efforts and I hope others might
follow his lead.

I bought a Triple Play from Werner. I consider the price to be very fair.
Manufacturing costs are generally about 10% of the total cost of a product.
I had _extremely_ good and helpful service from Octave2.

That is not a bad price for the box, even if there /were/ other
alternatives. And get real, being a cheapskate about this /kills/ any
opportunity to run more than 16 channels of midi; which is a serious
liability for the Amiga, and a midi studio.

TriplePlay+ was the _only_ solution even when Blue Ribbon and CBM were
around, except for the OneStopMusicShop soundcard, and briefly, Checkpoint
Technologies' multi-serial card, which I had the pleasure of owning and
selling. It was built when other serious midi developers thought the Amiga
was best left languishing.

Cheap unprofessional attitudes toward the platform have hurt it as much as
any other influence.

Not totally Studio16 related, but related to storing large sound sample 
...

What's the largest SCSI hard drive (and partitions) a stock A3000 with
on-board SCSI can handle?  Does that vary with OS versions ... does 3.1
allow larger drives than 2.04?

Dave

A little less than 4 GIG per harddrive.  You can not use anything
larger unless you install the new scsi.device and fastfilesystem
patches available on AI's site.

Without them you can not use anything in a partition higher than a
little less than 4 GIG.  So, if you have a 9 GIG drive you can only use
the first ~4G without installing the new patches.

Making it into 3 x 3 GIG partitions will not work... you'ld only be
able to use the first 3 GIG partition.

I believe it is the same for 2.x and 3.x - though don't hold me to it.

Hi, Dave!

Until you use one of the available patches (from several sources, including
Amiga International), the largest device size is 4096 meg (4 gig). Any
writing activity past the cylinder at the 4096 mark results in wraparound to
the start of the drive. Many drives that are sold as 4.3 gig actually only
format out to 20-30 meg above this (4 gig) anyway, as some manufacturers
count differently, count unused areas of the drive, etc.

This is the same for 2.x and 3.x, though some of the patches require 3.1, I
seem to recall.

Well... I tried setting my track buffers to 256kb, and setup 7 tracks to play back. I figured if Ben can do it continuously, I should be able to do it for at least a few seconds. To my dismay, as soon as it hit the start of the tracks, I got an I/O overload and it automaticly shut of all my tracks.  It didn't even play anthing for 1 second!!!  I then proceded to try one less track with each try.... First 6, then 5, then, 4 and finally 3.  3 tracks is all I can get out of it. I just don't understand. I believe the FireBall has an 8.5ms access time, and I am getting 1.79MB/Sec transfer. What's the problem?  Between my SMPTE errors, and my track playback... I am just not having much luck!!  The worst part is, I have 3 other musicians that never heard of Amiga till they met me, and so far they are not too impressed.

If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to let me know

At present, 3995 Megs is the most you can use unless you want to experiment
with beta software. You could buy a bigger disk and leave the rest of it
unformatted until WB3.5 comes out. No change from 2.04 to 3.1.

What is your machine configuration?  What kind of numbers does diskspeed

My A3000/25 6MB (2MB Chip), has no other cards installed but the AD516, along with a small 120MB Conner drive I use for system files (OS 3.1), and a 2.1GB Quantum Fireball split into two 1GB partitions. I am using the onboard SCSI controller and am unsure which chip revisions I have (I will check though).

I am using the OS3.1 FFS & Big Blocks with 8192kb blocks. I don't have diskspeed, but SysInfo reports 1.79MB/Sec transfer rate. The termination jumpers are not present on the motherboard. (I don't think there ever was any!!)

For some time now I have had problems with the editor not properly
drawing some samples when zooming in under 6 seconds.  

Lets say you are looking at 20 seconds or so of dialogue, you draw
out a 5 second region of 6 words easily identifiable (6 envelopes),
then click Show Region.  Now the the image appears to have no 
relationship to the area you drew out, not even close.  In fact the
wave can look rather eratic.  Playing the region confirms that it is
the correct area but the moving play line and the wave do not 
correspond to the sound.

If you zoom out there is a point where the image appears correct 
again.  If you zoom farther in it continues to be non representable.

One interesting thing is that sometimes when zoomed in on a messed
up graphic, if you click or drag the bottom position slider either
right or left, the image does scroll but half or all of the image
freezes or gets redrawn the same.

Right now the only samples doing this for me are app. 30 min long
sampled at 44.1  

I have done some experimenting to see if this is the case only with
very long samples.  The long ones do seem to be much more prone to
this while anything under 5min have no problems at all.  Everything
inbetween varies....closer to 5min = fewer problems...increase in 
length = increase in corrupted wave draw.

One extra note: this is inconsistant, it does not happen in the same
way at the same place everytime.  I think this leads me to believe
it is a problem between the .graph file and the editor getting mixed
up somehow.

I have some testing to do on this like using different sample rates
etc... but I was hoping someone might already have some insight into
this.

Price
------

The card with software will be US$400.  I'll pay the shipping and
insurance. Payment must be in advance.  About 4-5 weeks for delivery. I
have to bring them in from Germany and then ship them out to you. Money
order is preferred. Credit card is NOT possible.

I've never seen these cards available for under US$800 NEW.  I believe
they were over US$1100 retail.

If everyone acts fast and sends in their money quickly, I may be able
to save you another US$25-$50.  This depends on whether I can order all
cards at once or not.  If somebody takes two months to send their
money, and others send it within a week, I don't really want to make
the first ones wait.  So, if everyone acts together, you could save
more.

The reason they are so cheap, is simply because a dealer in Germany has
a large stock of them and is anxious to clear them out.  These are NEW
cards, and have been fully tested by my dealer.

I've already bought one myself and have had no problems with it.

These are private sale.

If you want more than one, let me know and I can probably give you a
little better price.


Software included
------------------
- Samplitude MS 3.0

  This is the main software for digitizing, editing and doing
  multi-track work (similar to Studio 16).
  
  This software has now been taken over by a new company (SEK'D I
  think it is).  They are currently working on a new version of the
  software.

- Maesto BR 2.0

  This is the backup to DAT software.  As I understand it, the Maestro
  Pro can be used to do backups to any audio DAT drive.  I have not
  tried this out myself, as I have a SCSI DAT backup drive.

- Maestix 41.20

  This is the maestix.library, which provides developers documentation
  and interface.
  
  This also comes with a program called Maestix FX, which is probably
  the best thing in this package!  It allows you to do realtime audio
  effects.  It has many effects including Karaoke (voice removal).
  Maestix FX can also be used to add or remove the SCMS digital audio
  protecton.

- Maestix AHI

  This is the AHI driver for the Maestro Pro.  There's lots of PD AHI
  software available, and this card is supported by all of it (unlike
  the AD516 :(.

Keep in mind that this card will be supported by the upcoming
ProStation audio system.  Maurizio tells me that the AD516 will not be
supported.


Please note... the manuals that come with the MaestroPro are in German.
No English manuals were ever made (that's what Macrosystems told me).
HOWEVER, the software is all in English and everything is
user-friendly.  So, you should be able to figure everything out.

I expect that most of you will just want to use the card for digital
transfers for use with Studio16 and the AD516.  So, you'll probably
only want to use something like AHI-Record with it (which does have
English documentation :)



Connectors

- 1x optical IN

Please get back to me as soon as you can.  Let me know when you are
sending payment if you are confirming you want to order.

Mike,

I thought you might like to see this just in case...

RE the converter for optical to coaxial... I just got one yesterday
(evaluating it today) which will be perfect... it's got a DtoA
convertor in it too, which will be handy for hooking up the Maestro to
my stereo for auditioning.  I'll be paying probably about CAN$200 for
the unit used (CAN$650 new).  I've heard you can get them for about
$100 in the US.  It's the Audio Alchemy DDE v1.0.  This company has a
lot of other digital products too, that you might be interested in.

Here's the Maestro Pro info...

Diskspeed v4.2 shipped with Studio16 3.0 -- it should be in the Tools
folder.
The performance numbers from Diskspeed are probably the most accurate
in terms of real-world system performance...  It basically performs a bunch
of disk io the same way an application would.

The scsi bus should be terminated at both ends... Are the drives terminated?
What versions of scsi.device and FastFileSystem?  One thing to check for are
multiple copies of the file system installed in the RDBs.  The
FastFileSystem
that shipped with Studio16 is probably the best one to use.  Another
important
number to look for is the CPU availability during disk transfers.  What kind
of
performance does the 120M drive exhibit?  How many 'Addbuffers' buffers does
the partition have?

The Buster chip revision is not relevant to the onboard scsi controller,
however,
the Ramsey revision can be important -- Ramsey contains some registers that
didn't fit into Super DMAC.

Ben.

The earlier Buster chips were a little buggy in that DMA transfers were
affected. Some cards won't function without a Rev 11 Buster (Broadcaster and
SoundStage Pro cards plus the Commodore SCSI card) and most other cards
benefit, too. The 3000's Buster is socketed and easy to upgrade.

To all,

FYI there is an Optical To Coaxial Converter made by Fostex called the
COP1.  It's a small stand alone box ( looks sort of like an old Radio Shack
phono pre amp ) and it's only $79.99 US!

I don't have one but I saw it in the current Thoroughbred Music catalog.

dhomas,

I have a question about these connectors you
mention. I'm not really that familiar with all the
stuff that most of you do with the AD516 nor
in the type of Audio/Video work that appartently
most of you do. All I use my AD516 for is for
recording music. I am a guitarist primarily and
use the AD516 as an 8 track multitracker. It makes
a damn nice one as well! :) I do not have a DAT
however I'm planning on getting one as well
as a CD Writer.

Anyway, I'm confused about the connectors for
the MaestroPro. Optical and Coaxial? Please
explain this to me.. The AD516 has RCA in
and out, this I understand but the ones you
mention are completely foreign to me.

regards,

Lee

>Gord Clink

Was this drive ever previously used with the A2000 you mentioned in one of
your
posts? If it was, the DMA mask may be set for the old 16 bit BUS memory
locations.
This happened to me when I moved my Audio drive from my old A2500 to my
A3000. If
the DMA mask is incorrect, the drive will break the transfers up into a
multitude of extremely small packets. Also, the newer Fireball may have
active termination. Are the Conner and the Fireball both internal? They may
have different kinds of
termination (active and passive). That can sometime spell trouble.

Check your DMA mask. An A3000 should have a value like 0xffffffff. An A2000
DMA mask will have less numbers.

Good Luck!

Optical and coaxial are both consumer digital I/O connectors (SP/DIF - Sony
Phillips digital interchange format (or something like that)).  Coaxial
uses an RCA jack but you need to use a high bandwidth cable (cheap audio
cable is not good enough).  Optical uses a fiber optic cable.

Professional digital audio gear uses a balanced (differential) signal and
XLR type connectors.  The format here is called AES/EBU (Audio Engineering
Society/European Broadcast Union).  The formats are not comaptible, but
often pro gear will have both AES/EBU and SP/DIF.

If you only plan to use your AD516 to pre-master for CD-R, then you don't
really have to worry about digital I/O.

However, if you want to output to a standalone CD-Recorder or DAT, you
would want to use digital I/O to prevent loss of quality that happens
during the re-digitizing that takes place over an analog transfer (figure
you will loose a few dB of signal/noise ratio everytime you go from analog
to digital or vice versa, etc.).

Just a quick comment, the DMA mask on internal A3k SCSI should be
0x7ffffffe.

For a Zorro2 SCSI device (whether A2/3/4k) the DMA mask should be 0xfffffe.

This may or may not be your problem, but Studio 16 does some "kind of
strange" things when drawing waveforms. Most notable is that it's not
really polarity sensitive. You don't tend to notice this when zoomed
out,
but it looks very weird once you zoom in. Basically, S16 determines
the greatest amplitude for the area represented by a given pixel (one
pixel horizontally might represent 100 or 400 or 32 etc. sample points).
It does this as an absolute calculation, and then uses that number to
draw both the positive and negative parts of the waveform. Thus, if
you're looking at a highly asymetrical waveform which has a sharp,
high positive peak along with a low broad negative area, S16 will draw
it as large peaks for both negative and positive. In other words,
it's as if S16 fullwave rectifies the signal and draws that result
above and mirrored below the 0 line. It's very easy to see this with
another editor which _is_ polarity sensitive.

Thanks Jim for responding.

Unfortunantly this symptom is definantly something buggy.  I have 
noticed what you are refering to and even though it looks wierd
when zooming in, I can still get some sort of representation of
where a sample starts and ends when zoomed in close.

My situation is off the richter scale in terms of being a problem.
It completely obscures the actuall placement of amplitude...
positive or negitive, scrambling it, making it incomprehensible.


Though I would still love someone to coaborate my Editor
Schizoidia,  maybe the technique S16 uses to draw wave forms, as
you mention here, deserves a closer looking at as well.

Could you elaborate on the pros and cons of representing a wave
form this way?

How can i hear or see this dB loss?
I'm doing some dialogue editing now in Studio 16, the sound comes from DAT
and goes to DA88, how much am i loosing here in this setup?

Well, using the analog INs and OUTs on the AD516 (or any sound card)
you are reducing the quality each time it passes through the DtoA and
AtoD conversion process.  From DAT to Amiga (analog) reduced quality...
from Amiga back to DAT... reduced quality again.

Remember too, that if you record the original source to DAT using
analog... that's a third reduction in quality (though very likely a lot
less reduction than recording analog with the AD516).

Recording analog, you can introduce interference from your computer and
all sorts of other nasties into the audio signal.  There's also the
process of converting from analog to digital using the AD516 AtoD
convertor... and the other way too... DtoA.  Analog recording, no
matter how quality it is, always degrades the signal some amount...
whether that's audible or not is up to the listener.

The amount of reduction in quality is entirely dependent on your
cables, DtoA/AtoD converters, computer noise/interference, etc.


If you transfered digitally from DAT to Amiga, and Amiga to DAT you
would have ZERO reduction in quality, since the data always stays in
the digital domain.

I'm using digital transfer from DAT with the MaestroPro now, and I can
tell a difference between the digital version, and an identical clip
digitized from the Amiga... I expect that interference from all the
other cards in my Amiga is a big factor...

Don't get me wrong... I'm not saying that recording analog with the
AD516 sucks it just isn't as good as digital... but then everyone knows
that, don't they?

There's so many variables along the way that introduce NOISE into an
audio recording that it's always best to reduce all possibilities as
much as possible.  Unless of course, you want NOISE.... ala the debate
of CD versus VINYL.  :)

To be honest with you, I really can't think of any _major_ pros. My
background is electrical engineering, and thus, I'm use to looking at
real waveforms on 'scopes. (Consequently, when I started Sample Wrench
one of the things I wanted was a display as accurate and flexible as a
'scope).

With S16's technique, you can't build the graph file any faster since
you still need to search for both maxima and minima and the redraw still
requires 2 points per horizontal pixel. The graph file can be half the
size, but that's because you essentially threw out half of the data.
Thus, you "purchased" a half-size graph file by "paying" with the
ability
to see any waveform asymetry. At higher magnifications, the drawing is 
downright misleading. Zoomed out, you tend not to notice it.

Seeing that a graph file is a small percentage of the audio file
itself, you're not saving much disk space. I don't know if S16 caches
the graph file in RAM - if it does, there is clearly a memory savings.
As always, it's a design decision. You try to balance resource usage
versus performance. If they're caching it, maybe RAM usage became a
problem with large files on small machines (?)

Mind you, I never reverse engineered their graph file format, so
the above is a general observation about what _might_ be, not
what _is_.

Jim, is this evidenced by some horizontal lines?

The S16 graph files are all similar in size, somewhere just under
200k.
While is does store the file with it's wave file on the drive, I
think it does cache the graph in ram.


So I assume from what you are saying, that when you are drawing
down a peak or some other very minute part of the wave, that you 
are actually affecting more than what you are seeing, and that S16
must be doing some sort of computational funtion to square up
what you see with what you don't see.



Can you hear this?

This may, or may not be related, but I've noticed that if you zoom in with the
editor, make a manual change to the waveform, and use the arrow buttons to move to
the next section, all changes are lost.

Everytime you go through redigitization you supposedly loose 3dB (I don't
think this is an exact figure as each application will obviously be
different - but it is an industry accepted figure).  Each time you
redigitize you are adding more noise and quantization errors to your
signal.

My math sucks, but since you go through two redigitizations and dB is
logarithmic, you could at worse be loosing 9dB of signal/noise ratio.
Certainly much less than if you were using analog tape machines.  :)

Can you hear it?  Probably not that much.  I can hear it if I digitize a
good quality CD and compare the two right away, but otherwise I wouldn't
really notice.

Years ago several magazines did studies. The one I remember most clearly
(_Mix_, I believe) involved "golden-ear" types doing blindfold listening
through multiple generations of dats playing into recording dats using the
analog ports. Later, through consensus, they concluded that 20 [twenty]
generations seemed to be a crucial quality boundary.

This was through ADCs and DACs of that day, which have considerably improved
since then. Whether we would consider treating our masters to this, the
point was, with oversampling and quality circuitry, analog playback from
digital storage had so little degradation compared to analog-to-analog
copying that it still was of great advantage to work in digital, even if
conversion had to take place several times.

That 3dB figure people are tossing around is /erroneous./ And by the way,
3dB is a significantly-audible amount in broad-spectrum (20-20K) sound. 9 is
a ridiculous amount, especially if you are already at a 72dB s/n ratio!

Two losses of 3dB is 6dB. db itself is a logarithmic measurement, and does
not need to be multiplied to signify a logarithmic change.

Quality DACs and ADCs have little to do with the dynamic range on a decent
board. Signal-to-noise is determined more by whatever the weak link in the
chain is -- computer-induced noise, theoretical limit of storage bits (ie
96db for 16-bit), cabling, grounding schemes and integrity, mixing board
quality, etc.

The ear is still the best measuring instrument there is. Also the one most
attached to the brain unfortunately. ;) Nonetheless, it is the best way to
determine whether a complex signal has integrity in an artistic setting. In
conjunction with the oscilliscope I have hidden here behind the curtain ...

Even though good DACs and ADCs are darned good indeed, there is still much
to be said for staying in the digital realm for transfers.

The idea of having sound represented by a string of ones and zeros that are
replicated each time a copy is made, without change -- even when a copy of a
copy of a copy is used -- has a certain draw. Not using circuitry that is
open to interpretive error or degradation from leakage of other nearby
circuitries -- well, all audio engineers have wished to make an end-run in
this realm! The faults of the storage medium can somewhat be minimized as
well.

Archivists are also attracted by the digital ideal. But many top-end houses
still prefer the best analog archival money can buy, due to the shelf-life
issues. DAT, ADAT, and DA (hi-8) tapes, for instance are all bad bets for
even short-term, due to tape and transport liabilities. CDs and optical are
rapidly becoming more in favor since the introduction of 20-24-bit methods,
though no-one knows yet /for sure/  how long they can last.

Typical solutions are side-by-side analog /and/  digital archival mastering.
Cover your bets: the record companies believe the people of the future will
want their Madonna unsullied (at least in the audio realm)!

-->Years ago several magazines did studies. The one I remember most clearly

A while ago, for my own satisfaction, I did some bounce tests between the AD516
and my reel-to-reel. I stopped after 15-20 bounces, and I must say, even though I
could hear a slight loss in the high end, I thought the overall loss sensation was
pretty much negligeable. Don't forget, this included 10 bounces to an analog
medium (the reel-to-reel). If I recall, I also did multiple internal bounces in
the AD516, and it was even better.

Going by the previous assessment, we'd soon be hearing more Noise than Signal,

and advocate a return to live radio performance. OK, OK. Enough sarcasm. Please

Just a tiny, tiny correction, if I may so indulge (no offense intended). dB's are

*********************************************************************************

***  2.5  How do sound levels add ?

If there are two sound sources in a room - for example a radio
producing an average sound level of 62.0 dB, and a television producing
a sound level of 73.0 dB - then the total sound level is a logarithmic
sum ie

     Combined sound level = 10 x lg ( 10^(62/10) + 10^(73/10) )

                          = 73.3 dB

Note: for two different sounds, the combined level cannot be more than
3 dB above the higher of the two sound levels. However, if the sounds
are phase related there can be up to a 6dB increase in SPL (Sound Pressure
 Level).

Ah! Someone else who appreciates a good White Paper. We are talking about
two different types of situations, however.

YOURS: two *simultaneous* sound sources in an *acoustic* space (similar to
the classic "two-unison-trumpets-not-twice-as-loud" example found in big
band or orchestral arranging handbooks).

MINE: Relative to a fixed reference point (ie the noise floor, or any
reference voltage) a signal runs through circuitry that induces 3dB dynamic
range loss. It is then run through another (near-identical) circuit that
also results in 3dB less headroom. This does in fact add up to a 6dB loss,
relative to the original reference.

 . . . So we are both right?

Yes & no, it depends whether the sound sources are coherent (in phase) in which
case the signal sources add to become a 6db increase in level. When the
signal sources are incoherent (such as noise) the average level of the
noise signal increases by only 3db.

After all, noise, particularly thermal noise generated by passive
components, can be thought of as a simple, random (and unwanted)
signal source. Induced hum can get a bit trickier because at low
frequencies there is a larger chance that the relative phases of the
harmonics of the signal will be in phase. Then there are the distortion
products, however generated, and the quantization noise/distortion inherent
in extremely low signal levels that are digitized (due to the reduced bit
resolution) and reconverted.

Two trumpet players playing together in phase? Now we have crossed the
threshold into -- THE THEORETICAL ZONE. [doo-doo-doo-doo.] Whoops! Perhaps
you were referring to the {3db and then 3db more} example. =^]

This appears to be like many other answers involving decibel-related
measurements. While quantifying simple-state voltages things appear cut-and
dried, but once involking the ear -- a bit more chaotic, though still
bearing perceptual similarities.

I will still argue that when 3db of "noise" is introduced during encode,
then stored to media, then decoded through circuitry that degrades the s/n
ratio 3db more: that it will produce *significantly* more than 3db in the
real world and nearer to 6db, (but certainly and definitely not 9 db).
There?

  {If 3bd + 3db and then + 3db and then + 3db more = 3 db! -- why, digital
          recording probably would not have ever been invested in}

Of course, when we start talking about perceptual masking, weighting curves,
and the like, the answers change once again...

It shouldn't be. See below.

Sort of.

Look at it this way, say your wave has 100,000 points and the edit
window is 500 pixels wide. Each of those pixels needs to somehow
represent 200 sample points. How do you do this? Do you find the
average? Do you find the peaks? How about RMS? Something else?
That choice determines what the waveform is going to look like in
the editor. At the same time, the mouse can only resolve to 1 pixel,
so you are in effect defining edit areas in terms of 200 sample point
chunks. Mind you, there's nothing that says we're always going to end
up with such a nice round number or that it will even be that small.
A 1 minute audio file at 44.1 kHz contains over 2.5 million points.
Each pixel now represents about 5000 sample points (more than 1/10
second). A lot of editors (I don't about S16 because I never tested
it) in order to speed up drawing will just skip over much of the data,
using perhaps every other point, every third point, and so on. The
result is a visual alias (we've under-sampled, and the result is
not perfectly accurate).

The S16 designers made certain choices about how they wanted to handle
the above situation, and the display corresponds to that. I've never
seen their code, but I can give you a little insight: If you want to
make sure that the display is peak-accurate, then you can never skip
over data. OTOH, if you examine every data point, that could get
expensive time-wise. If you do anything "fancy" like an RMS calculation,
although you do wind up with a display that correlates well to
perceived volume, you never see the peaks or possible clipped points
(and the calculation is much more expensive time-wise). Caching
the display data (peak, avg, RMS, whatever) can help you on subsequent
redraws, although extra memory is now needed to store this info. How
does the designer balance this? In about a hundred different ways!
I have seen some professional big-name editors which don't handle
this situation that well (IMHO) and some which do (I'm talking both
Amiga and Windows 95 applications).

Now that I've given you the history of clocks, do you know what time
it is? :-)

I finally figured out my "Too Fast/Too Slow" smpte problem.....

Everytime I would record time code, my reel-to-reel was cold. After playing with it for a several minutes, it would heat up, and I would get the dreaded error. Then I would be frustrated, go to bed, get up and try it again, with the same results.

Finally I left the deck on for several hours before striping time code. It worked fine all night. Then when I got up in the morning and tried it.... Guess what?  I got the "Too Fast/Too Slow error" !!!!  So I let it sit and warm up for a little while.... And presto.... It worked again.....:)

I think I will document this and post it somewhere so nobody else will go through all the headaches I went through.....

Thank you all for all your help and suggestions

Congrats, Gord. The wonderful world of interaction again makes its presence
known . . .

What deck was that again? Is the oil 30w or 10/30? ;^/

IT'S TIME TO EDIT in SampleWrench, whenever the sample is small enough! The
S16 edits are usually fine for "splicing" in conjunction with crossfades,
but to go down into micro-world requires a microscope.

Gord, I have meant to suggest this for a while...my apologies.  Glad
to hear that this works for you.   
Years ago while dealing with this problem Todd Modjeski mentioned two
things to consider with tape decks.  1. Make sure your deck is
properly warmed up.  This is standard procedure before any session in
a recording studio.  2.  Use plenty of preroll...start the tape early
enough for the deck to get up to speed.

Now I always warm up my deck.  The second suggestion never made much
difference in my case, but could be a problem on some decks.

TITLE

  QMaster (for Studio 16)

VERSION

  1.0 DEMO

AUTHOR

  Kenneth Chr. Nilsen/Digital Surface

  mailto:kenny@bgnett.no

DESCRIPTION

 QMaster is an ARexx host which offer comands that can be accessed
 from arexx scripts. QMaster provides comands to handle every aspect
 of Studio 16's Cuelist files giving the arexx programmer full
 control and making life much easier for the user.

 The comands allow you to alter cuelist entries, tracks, preferences,
 remove, add, adjust, swap, copy entries and tracks, convert files to
 and from other formats, and in conjunction with other arexx hosts
 you can do automated processes, on-air organizing, connect with
 other programs such as video- and musicediting software, databases,
 networks, multimedia packages and so on, to influence the cuelist
 files and more.

 You don't have to be familar with arexx programming to take
 advantage of what QMaster can offer. QMaster comes with several
 arexx scripts that you can use just by double clicking their icons
 or by starting them from cli/shell. More scripts will come in the
 future.

FEATURES

  QMaster provide more than 40 comands to handle Cuelists,
  convert times, provide requesters, information, resource tracking
  and more.

  With QMASTER you can:

   - create cuelist files from scratch
   - read/edit existing cuelist files
   - read/add/remove/cut/swap and alter tracks (Audio/AREXX)
   - read/add/remove and alter entries (Audio/AREXX)
   - read/alter and set preferences
   - load (add) and save track (TRAX) files
   - copy and paste tracks
   - do statistic operations
   - interface directly with the Amiga's global vars (SetEnv/GetEnv)
   - add progressbars to your scripts
   - add informal requesters to your scripts
   - add file- and directory requesters to your scripts
   - add string requesters to your scripts
   - convert between SMPTE (PAL/NTSC) and seconds
   - optionally auto detect video system (PAL/NTSC)
   - define 50.000 entries (100 tracks with 5000 entries on each)
   - get online help
   - invoke RESOURCE TRACKING if needed at any time

  and more...

  QMaster is written in assembler to achieve optimal speed in
  processing comands and content. QMaster has been through several
  weeks of betatesting and proves to be stable.

  The archive comes with several public domain arexx scripts which
  you can run from Workbench as well as from cli:

   AllToAny       - sets all play/rec channels to "Any"
   AppendCuelists - merges two cuelist files horizontally w/ grouping
   CMXtoCUE       - converts CMX EDL to Cuelist format opt. database
   CountCuelist   - statistic info
   DumpCue        - dumps info about all tracks/entries in cuelist
   FindEntry      - search for an entry by keyword
   FixPaths       - fixes entry paths if samples are moved on HD
   GroupEvents    - search for keyword in events and group them
   ListEntries    - dumps different entries used (one of each)
   MergeCuelists  - same as Studio 16's built-in function with extras
   NameToCue      - for fun, converts a string to cuelist 'letters'
   ReplaceEntries - search by keyword and select new from requester
   SampleTime     - shows SMPTE time in PAL/NTSC (AUTO) for a sample
   StereoJukebox  - puts samples in a dir after one eachother on cue
   StripEmpty     - removes empty tracks from a cuelist file
   TestVideo      - test script to auto detect video system

  You can also find tutorial scripts that show how to use some of the
  comands in QMaster.

Sorry, that should be 500.000 entries.

Also did a benchmark test:

A4000/030/25mhz
Loading 256 cuefiles (10 different files repeated 25 + 6 times)
Different sizes (~3k-30k/~20-170 entries).

Load time average: 0.11 seconds/cuelist file (!)

This include loading, checking, extracting, allocating memory, copy data,
free memory, close file and resource tracking. It's also through arexx.

Kenny, congratulations on a project finished! Just seeing it on Aminet is
exciting! Well-written description as well.

Now, for the next step: Got to con some one into writing a (MUI or whatever)
interface for it that will run in a window on any public screen. Anybody
here ever see any of the pre-4.0 Toaster ARexx utilities? ToastMaster,
ToasterToolkit, TRexx, etc? These great little programs really simplified
the use of the Toaster and ARexx.

In those well-designed GUIs you could build macros for often-used,
repetitive processes, and painlessly access all Switcher ARexx commands with
nary a look to the manual, or a peck on the keyboard. Buttons and icons
could do it all! It was Godlike, to use ARexx at a high level so quickly.
And at the highest level of power!

Anyway, here's a TOAST to you, Kenny!

  Hiya,

  The 2000 that I have Studio 16 in is starting to flake out.  I've got a
GVP '040 combo board (which I'm suspicious of) with the GURU Rom, and it's
expanded to 16 megs.  I've also got the MegaChip.

  I've been thinking of moving all of the goodies to a virtually
unused 2000 that I was able to find for $50.  The only thing is that the
motherboard is rev 4.3.  Do any of you know of any problems using S16 with
a 4.3 2000?

  Thanks!

I couldn't get a 2 Meg Chip update to work on my 4.3. Otherwise it should all
work fine. Mine has the PAR card in it, also a Catweasel, a Phase5 accelerator
(plenty of fast RAM), and a Commodore flicker fixer. It is a good computer,
except for shortage of Chip.

I got a new HD for my ami/S16 and I want to put it  through
some hard sector testing before I start writing serious work
to it. What util can I use to test the drive when it has been
set for big blocks and where can I get it. Or should I do a standard
format first, test the drive, then setup for big blocks?

thanks
troy

The standard for drive speed testing is DiskSpeed v4.2 (available on the
Studio16 disks, Fish library, and a slighter older version is on Aminet).

Whenever you change the sector block size you will have to reformat that
partition (but you can do a "quick" format).  Make sure you install the
FastFileSystem that came with Studio16 (or a later version).  The versions
shipped with OS 3.1 and below have various bugs that may affect the
reliablity of a BigBlock partition (as well as other annoying little bugs).

  All of the 2000's in my studio have always had the Mega Chip, so I
actually don't know what it's like to not have 2 megs of chip ram.  Are
there specific Studio 16 problems with only one meg of chip ram?

  Perhaps it would be better to drop Studio 16 into an old 3000 I have
here and pick up a used '040 for it.  Seems like it would make for a good
dedicated audio machine.

  Thanks for your help.

Hard sector testing is to test for physical drive-and-cabling integrity, not
speed (Diskspeed is the best /speed/  tester though).

What you would use to test for integrity depends on what you use for a SCSI
host and what software you use to install the drive. Typically, using
HDToolbox or others to check for bad blocks is a waste of time, as most
modern drives "have it together"; not like the bad old days! (It is also a
waste of time on the newer drives to do slow formatting, or low-level format
-- a no-no.)

Also, utilities like AmiBackTools can map out bad data areas after the
[format] fact. So it is not always neccessary to rewrite RDBs (rigid disk
blocks) and reformat if a drive develops hard errors in its future.

But if your set on hard sector testing I would stick to standard blocks,
because even software that claims to support different sizes could have
bugs, regardless. Then use BigBlocks and the quick format.

Alternatively, go straight to BigBlocks and Format QUICK, and just play a
CD into the sucker and see if you can fill the partition.

This is so.

Seems like I once saw some other 2meg chipram mod that claimed to work with
that rev. Sure forget where, though.

Forgot ever having one meg chipram. (My refrain :).

Killer actually, as long as chips are current. Bypasses having to use Zorro2
SCSI. Forget why that is significant though . . . ;)

How do I make sure that I have the right file system installed?
What's the procedure? Simply copying the the S16 libs and files?

On Studio16 disk. Use version on it (c:version path/fastfilesystem FULL
FILE). If you can't find a newer one on Aminet or the Amiga International
website, or some disk from a newer program that is a newer revision --
that's the one to use.

[With a button or menu selection in DOpus version is really useful!]

You have to use HDToolBox.

Select the drive, select "Partition Drive", click on "Advanced Options",
click on "Add/Update".

If you don't have a FastFileSystem listed (ie., you are using the one in
ROM), click on "Add New File System", then type in the full path to the new
FastFileSystem file.  It'll then come up with the version/revision
information (and DosType) which should be 40.4, just press return here.
Click OK until you get back to the main window, then press "Save Changes to
Drive".  Do this for each hard drive listed.  Reboot.  :)

If you already have a FastFileSystem installed, you can do the above but
click "Update File System" instead from the File System Maintenance window
(but in this case make sure you are not installing an older version of
FastFileSystem).

The above only works on hard drive controllers that support the CBM Rigid
Disk Block (RDB) standard.  Most do, but some real old ones might not.

You can verify the version of the file system being used by typing:
"version hd0:  full" (where hd0:  is your hard drive partition(s), of
course).

Only shortage of screen area: if you had Bars&Pipes open with lots of windows,
plus S16 with lots of windows, plus some on the WB, you could run out of chip.

I will consider it. I have already spent much work on the program and
haven't yet got any feedback (not counting betatesters and your toast :).
I'm aware it's just been released, but I will see the next couple of month.

I feel I pour energy into a big black hole so the respond on QMaster will
determine further involvement from my part.

On a rev. 4.3 motherboard you will need to change j101 from the middle pin and
top pin to the middle pin and bottem pin   and
you will need to cut the trace between the two solder pads on j500
the megachip will work fine then

Yeah. I know what you are saying. For instance -- I thought that the "Toast
post" would get some discussion. Of course, it didn't have anything to do
with a StarTrek series. Or a problem whose answer can be found on page 4 of
the manual. (OK, I'm not referring specifically to /this/ m-list.)

But in general, I've begun to wonder if I am getting all the emails from
our little ML; things couldn't be this lethargic, could they? Everything in
the Amiga marketplace depends on participation, and has for some time now --
so I hope not.

And I hope your work doesn't end up beyond the event horizon, like that of
so many other providers of Amiga relief . . .

Give it a few months. It takes time for word to get around. 
I have downloaded it but I haven't had time to try it - I am only in the lab
with the S16 one afternoon a week.

Things seem to be 'frozen' on the list.

I would like to hear what things people want to do with Cuelists so I can get
ideas for scripts to make using QMaster. Feel free to send them to me in
private email.

Hold on guys, I'm about do do some experimenting with three A3000's ;

One running a Toaster and a Kttchen Sync running with another using an;
('040 Commodore accelerator)

AD516 with SMPTE out to another A3000 with a ;
('060 MKII)
So maybe I can utilize Studio16 3.0 'cause the Broadcaster only likes 2.0

Broadcaster Elite 32 bit NLE. . . .with sync coming form the first.
('060 PPC)


Trying to SCSI network two of the machines after I get all this hardware
straightened out and maybe Parnet another. Hopefully I won't let the smoke
out of these machines as a friend of mine puts it.

I'm pre-occupied but I'm listening guys. Hopefully I'll have some stuff to
contribute soon (and be using your great tools Kenny).

Hi Brian; I've had much better success running ProNet (from Aminet, natch!)
using my old ParNet cable, especially with OS3.x machines. This connects my
4000 with my CDTV and allows it to mount as CD0:, which is another
improvement over ParNet. Solid.

Sounds like an ambitious project, linking those machines. Which SCSI hosts
(the internal, I assume) and software will you be networking with? I did it
for awhile with IVS TrumpcardPros and the supplied software -- but due to
SCSI address limitations soon went over to Ethernet cards and Interworks'
EnLan-DFS. Not potentially as fast, but bulletproof and transparent.

Do you get the same problem with ENLAN that I do, that if one machine crashes
or is rebooted, the other locks up when you click on Volumes in a file
requester? That seems to be its only problem. 
BTW I have an ARexx script which allows ENLAN to access removable media like
CDs or even floppies across the network.

Hi, Don. You know, I had that problem early on, and don't remember what I
did to solve it. Perhaps it was an upgrade. I looked through my scripts for
a clue. They are definitely _not_ stock, but haven't had a hand on 'em since
15-Nov-95. What ver are you using? Are you using it with DOpus Magellan?

i had started mapping ideas for a GUI for qmaster last week, if only to
make it for my own use.  but then i tried to put an accelerator i bought
used off the net into my 2000 that i use for audio work, and pretty much
destroyed the computer.  ugh.  sorta throws things off schedule.

anybody got any old motherboards (anything with zorro) they'd like to
sell?  i've got no slots left in my 4000 - it's got toaster/flyer stuff in
it.

anyways, if no one else wnats to work on a GUI, i'll do it.  it might
suck, but i'll do it.

A quick way to create a GUI for ARexx or CLI software is to 
use CanDo. It gives you most of the buttons, fields, scrolling 
windows, sliders and display options you might want, and it
can create a stand-alone executable. The program might
be 100k bigger than it otherwise would be, but what's 100k
these days, expecially since CanDo can save weeks of work?

I used CanDo to create an easy interface for one of the Broadcaster
utilities, and gave it away to anyone who wanted it (it was on
Applied Magic's BBS). I've even used CanDo for more complex, 
stand-alone programs that could also communicate with commercial 
software via ARexx. Very cool stuff.

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

Ok guys here's one for yas. :)

I'm going to try to set up a system over the next week with Studio16 as the
centerpiece and hope I don't let the smoke out of the machine as they say... 
It is;


'060 PPC A3000 - 40 Megs ram -SCSI device 7-

Studio16 3.0 doesn;t work with the Broadcaster Elite (32 bit NLE) but I
was told that 2.0 does. Hence the AD516 on another machine and I'll use
SMPTE.


Am I crazy? or should this work? 
(Talk amoungst yourselves I'm feeling verklempt)

Hey, Jamie, so how well does CanDo handle using OS3.1 features? Does it have
the ability to use system calls for file requester, screenmode, pub screen,
etc. The reason I ask: Innovatronics is no longer around, are they?

HELM is another "authoring" system that shows great promise here; might be
the same old Amiga story for its parent company though. I have seen
commercial and shareware done in these progs that is way sharp though.

I am also quite pleased with all the MUI apps I run, and the customizing is
way cool, like Big Daddy Roth sez  {-8

Bummer. No recovery? I hear 3000s are going for a good price, and the SCSI
seems easy to deal with. I have a 2000/GVP040/megachip but I don't know --
I got it when they first came out (maybe 87). Kinda attached.

Do you have one of the A4000 expansion chassis that gives extra slots?

How bad and how much? Maybe that'll "encourage" other "software engineers".

Kenny, I'd be interested in a way to batch modify a cuelist to point to
re-located the samples.

Example:  I have a bunch of cuelists using samples located in
DH1:samples.  Now that the show is done, I want to move the samples to
DH2:archives/samples/showname.  I'd like to modify the related cuelists
to look for the samples in the new location.

I'm not sure if that's within the scope of QMaster or not...

It's gonna take me into next week. I've got a Bigfoot power supply coming
tomorrow for the Toaster machine and another A3000(destined for the MKII)
coming in the next couple of days.

>Which SCSI hosts
>(the internal, I assume) and software will you be networking with?

The A3000 has built-in SCSI networking as I understand it. A good friend 
has SCSI networked two A3000's sharing a hard drive and had no problems.

BTW I had trouble with my mailer and sent out another similar post to my
last because I thought the first didn't go out. It lists my plan in more
detail. Since there was a lull in the ML just thought I'd throw in some
kindling to warm the place up. . . . :)

Can you believe it? I just bought two ethernet cards new in the box for
$25 apiece (store out of Amiga business - last ones - no stuff left) and
gave them to my son and brother-in-law as gifts. They were $250 cards from
........can't remember .....name started with an A .....you probably know.

I thought I could get away with this network setup anyway.

Here's the latest and probably the best config after more thought.

Yeah, that's a natural. Also:

¤ Move/Reconstruct    actually moves all entries and the list to selected
                        directory and modifies cuelist to reflect this
¤ AddTimeOnSelected   enter nn:nn:nn value to add to all hilited items
¤ SubTimeOnSelected   enter nn:nn:nn value to subtract from hilited items
¤ MoveSelectedTo      move selected items so that first hilited starts
                        at specified time
¤ SetToEndTime        enter nn:nn:nn value for *end* of sample to play to
¤ ReverseCues         reverse entry of all hilited samples, reverse playback
¤ Double/Offset       selected entry is doubled nn:nn, stereo options

 -- etc. Come on folks, I don't even have my card and I can think of many
desirable cue list features that could be performed.

Kinda tough to keep up here Brian, old boy. ;-} I don't think anyone who

stuff like this, and though I plan for what I think is every eventuality,
practicality, plus and minus -- before I step into action --

    -- well, lets just say even the best plan will evolve as needs and use
informs you . . .

Still curious, what soft-stuff are you using to maintain SCSI networking?

Got to watch for SCSI bandwidth. Really do not want any other SCSI access
going ANYWHERE over the network when recording or playing back audio or
video on any machine that is sharing through SCSI. Not to mention the CPU
interaction-thresholds Diskspeed indicates.

no.  standard a4k.  toaster, flyer, ethernet, and that damn flyer
octa-cable thing take up all slot possiblilities.  i like having a

that's pretty funny.  i've made a couple of simple gui's to control
arexx stuff, for my own use, and they came out ok.  once i figure out what
i'm doing with my machine, i'll see if i can come up with something.
qmaster has the potential to be an *incredible* resource, i think.

The last time I looked at CanDo it was very much a WB1.3 program. Did it get
updated to work properly on graphics cards, with 060s, etc?
So far as I know, it is no longer on the market, like most Amiga software. I
should have bought it while I could; but I have spent a _lot_ of money on
no-longer-supported software.

There's a lock put on those devices by the OS and when the link isn't
reestablished, you get that lock-up (most apparent when using Opus or
something that wants to read a non-existent device). Version 2.0 of Enlan will
automatically remount devices after a crash (upgrade now, it's worth it).
Obviously if you shut down one computer on purpose, you first need to "Deport"
those resources from the remote machines and you'll have no problems.
Otherwise you need to import all devices that the locked computer had a lock
on before the remote crash.

Also to another mentioned area in another post: the AD516 version 2.0
libraries are the ones supported for the Broadcaster and the version 3.0
libraries are not. The cue list in version 3.0 is indispensible, though, and I
captured sound in the Broadcaster, then fired up 3.0 to edit. Crashes are
common if Producer and S16 were both active at once. Using both libraries
caused a conflict. There were occasional crashes for me if I used S16 after
quitting Producer. Maybe flushing the 2.0 library from memory would solve it.
The convenience of using 3.0 overrode the lost work from the occasional crash
for me.

Also, this may be of interest to anybody else using the Broadcaster on an
Ethernet network. Did you notice that when you tried to read a DBS formatted
partitioned device from a remote computer, you were only able to read it once?
This was a real pain for me in trying to use remote resources to backup my
audio and video work. Opus Magellean 5.661 has no problem reading DBS
partitions over the network.

It sure is - in fact I have already made a script which is bundled with the
demo archive :) It's called FixPaths.rexx. You can start it from WB and it
will parse the cuelist you select for all different paths to samples in the
cuefile and then allow you to select new ones for them via a requester.

Noted. All these are no problem, but

this one need an external program to reverse the sample itself if that's
what you mean ?. It's no problem to 'reverse' the entries, but the sampledata
must be reversed manually or via a program. I can perhaps make a tool to
accompany it though - it's no big deal.

I figured that would be the case. Really, I was just trying to spark some
ideas. Everyone here must have some things they would like do do, or do in
an easier fashion. Thanks, Kenny.

Yeah, I see it. The main thing about those chassis, they give you better

Yeah, I've really started seeing how QMaster can have a great amount of
utility and power. What have you used to construct GUIs? I am really liking
stuff made with MUI: its development continues, there are many users out
there (and programs), and I like the customization it gives the user.

Hi, Mark and Don!Yeah, that upgrade is what solved the problem, and it is
*great* software. Support another great Amiga company (if it is still even
around)!

That is lame of Broadcaster.

I suspect an Avail FLUSH will not completely solve the problem. Broadcaster
probably does some other things that cause conflict.

Kewwl. I've made a couple things in Helm and it is quite good; covers most
all the bases, uses modern system calls, requesters, etc. You can really
build great screens and gadgets, and it is purty. But I haven't seen support
for it as of late. Perhaps I need to track down Jerrell Nickerson and see
where things are at with it.

Yeah, there are a number of ways to approach it: user menu, lister menu or
lister icon bar, and button bank -- with either text buttons or graphic
ones, all in conjunction with listers. It is amazing what great arexx stuff
is out there for DOpus. FTP and lha stuff with listers is neato.

Developer documentation for Studio 16 release 3.0 does not exist.  Besides,
if I remember correctly, SunRize was gone before Applied Magic "appeared"...

>Jeez we keep getting back to that: A LACK OF SunRize DEVELOPER RESOURCES.



I sense that you feel that SunRize was in some way negligent by not
providing information on how to program a proprietary hardware device that
was intended to be used with software created for the exclusive use of that
hardware device.  Anyone thinking that SunRize should have created
documentation for third-party developers instead of improving the
performance and stability of a product that was actually making money would
be thinking incorrectly.

Third-party developers would have simply been icing on the cake.  They
certainly were not neccessary to the short-term success of the product --
which, by the way, is what usually creates the profit neccessary to stay in
business.

Best regards,
Ben Fuller

You have to run CanDo itself on a standard Amiga-style screen (not a 
graphics card) when you are creating your program, but the program 
you create will run on any kind of screen, including those promoted to 
add-on graphics cards. I'm not sure about the ability to share a public
screen, but you can run your programs directly on the workbench or
their own screens.

As I recall, CanDo does access the standard file requester. And it 
has really nice support for ARexx.

> The reason I ask: Innovatronics is no longer around, are they?

Nope, they're history. If you were smart you bought CanDo while you
could. Just imagine if everyone had purchased the software they wish
they could get now, maybe more of these companies would still be
around... 

You may be able to find a used copy to buy.

Helm was looking promising but not quite up to CanDo when I last
looked into it. I don't know if it has undergone further development
or not. In some ways it looked like it could eventually be better than
CanDo.

I tried to develop a commercial program with CanDo but ran into
a few limitations that Innovatronics were unwilling to tackle in the end. 
I stopped development three or four years ago. One of my beta testers 
still runs her law office with my CanDo-produced software, though.

We use MUI for WCS on the Amiga. We like it a lot. But CanDo is
even easier and perfect for this kind of quickie interface. There may
be other options out there.

Didn't say that. But now that you mention it, I believe self-righteous
proprietary stances are short-sighted.

Doing both is achievable. It is not an either/or situation.

Maybe that's the way you see it. Most people now want compatibility and
cross-use issues solved, before they even consider buying a product, and most
people /then/ wanted professional products to work together.

So I'll just continue with my "incorrect thinking". There are so many models
of marketplace success supporting it, after all. %-]

Yeah, some good stuff has been made in CanDo.

Always bought tons of software, and encouraged friends and clients to do the
same. If a company has gone under, its not because I played "wait and see".
I have little patience for either pirates or malingerers. 8D

When I checked out Helm it was ahead in all but a few respects; development
and releases came very fast after CanDo was history. But the reason I bought
it was because it was a faster learning curve for what I wanted to do.

>I tried to develop a commercial program with CanDo but ran into

Did you see my post mentioning DOpus Magellan? That is an easy way also.
I'd say AmigaVision but Helm is actually fantastic at this stuff, no
run-time module needed either. Comparing GEnie Viewport mags made in Helm vs
ones made in CanDo, the Helm ones were easier to install, and cleaner.

True. 
Did SunRize create any documentation at all (meaning for
their internal use, not necessarily geared towards 'outsiders')?
Or did they keep it all in their heads? ;)
I sense you feel various people are attacking Sunrize posthumously,
when it's possible they are just trying to determine what can be done.
If absolutely no technical documentation exists anymore (internal or
otherwise), then further development would be diffcult. Anyone
attempting to pick up where Sunrize left off would have a hell of a
time. Assuming they were even legally able to do it, which appears to
be impossible.

So perhaps you can understand Ben, that no blame was attached to my
statements. As Mike said, we just want to do what can be done. Many people
still believe the Amiga has something to offer, and it is frustrating to
come up on that particular brick wall in the current state of things.

As a dealer, I had an investment in selling and supporting Amigas and
third-party products but -- as I suspect of most people involved with the
Amiga -- it was an emotional bond as well as a financial one. Evangelism is
a word that often comes to mind.

We still love our Amigas, even if we have Macs and PCs.

The Broadcaster Elite was frought with many problems that the company was
not quick to respond to and required the user to "divine" his way through
the myriad of difficulties. The BE board itself was way ahead of its time
and consequently couldn't seem to get enough throughput with only SCSI2 
and other existing hardware. The PPC is a joy, as I've seen testament to,
with this board and I can't wait to get it up aand running ALONG WITH and
in concert with the AD516 through SMPTE.

As with many Amiga products the Amiga US bankruptcy took the wind out of
the intentioned profits and ongoing dreams with this great board as well
as I'm sure the Sunrize boards.

I'm trying to solve this problem by using another A3000 through SMPTE with
SCSI networked machines and I'm waiting on a part from UPS to start
putting the whole configuration together. I would love to hear your ideas
& experiences with your Broadcaster as I am getting this stuff up and
running. At the risk of getting too much off the Sunrize topic and all of
Kenny's great effort I'll take this discussion off the ML. (unless there's
another lull).  :)

Qmaster and Kenny rule! Thanks again Kenny.

A3000 has it built in and I know people who have used this feature.

Yup. I've changed the plan to include just the boot drive on SCSI 1, the Jaz
and the two A3000 SCSI controllers (one set to 7 and one set to 6). The
other boot drive will be on SCSI 2 bus. I'll just use the Jaz as a common
well as it were.

. . . . .oh well I'll let you know in private mail how it goes as you seem
to be interested.
I thought putting this on the ML might create some discussion and give
some other Studio16 users some ideas.

I think this is already available via the "offset selected"
option under S16 "ENTRY"



>¤ Double/Offset       selected entry is doubled nn:nn, stereo options

I would love to see some sort of mirroring ability as GreenyBoy
mentions here.  Grouping does this to some degree, but lets say you
have a half hour of piano improvisation with a handfull of bloopers
that you want to edit out.  It's recorded in stereo....all of your
edits must be done twice and hopefully with accuracy.  If you could do
the edits to one track and then tell QMaster to mirror the edits of
track one to track two, it would cut your time down considerably, not
to mention taking the fear out of doing stereo recording much more
often.

Obviously there would need to be some limitations to the process.  
Destructive edits would be ignored.



Kenny, how about adding a SMPTE offset calculator.  One that includes
"plus" values (100ths of frames) as well as BPM.

Yeah, it was a great concept, and it was more open-ended than the Toaster of
its time. But I was put off when I saw the state of the documentation.
NewTek has always had good, maybe great, manuals. And they periodically salt
the marketplace with developer docs and incentive programs.

That throughput thing was a problem in the Flyer's early history too.

I kept hoping as I talked to both companies that the Sunrize board would be
the audio solution for each non-linear editor.

Yeah, what I am asking is: what software you will use in conjunction with
the onboard SCSI hardware, to handle it all. It takes more than just a cable
between the external SCSI ports, AFAIK. Maybe I am missing something?

>and the two A3000 SCSI controllers (one set to 7 and one set to 6).

SO just changing the host address will be enough (#6 on one, #7 on the
other)? That had not been my previous experience. Client [drive] issues were
the reason, I believe.

>oh well I'll let you know in private mail how it goes as you seem

This is probably on-topic stuff, I would think. Until the ML exceeds 50
emails a day anyway =}. I am interested, because SCSI is so much faster than
Ethernet.

Somewhere on Aminet there is a SMPTE calc. Wonder if it does easy cut &

result go into the Cuelist: that would be hot!

I'm not a video jock, I'm a musician (no damnit this time :) ) just trying
to do the best with what I have. NewTek is the flag flyer for the Amiga no
doubt, because the folks who could afford to do video put their bucks into
the best for the time. And NewTek stuck with their product for longer than
a lot of others. The Broadcaster folks as with all cutting edge stuff went
in fits and starts. 
In danger of being flamed here but I've never known a great engineer who was 
a great marketer and never known a great salesman who was a great engineer. 
They both take an enormous amount of passion and energy to do well.
Dedicated artists on the other hand do as little as they must of both to
achieve their ends(and they always seem to be considered poor ne'er do
wells until they succeed!). Such is innovation.

>That throughput thing was a problem in the Flyer's early history too.

Yeah but as I say, they saw it through and it has paid off but it seems
it's about to be eclipsed by other platforms.

>I kept hoping as I talked to both companies that the Sunrize board would be

I know people that work on multiple platforms that know coding and
engineering that insist that the front end for the Sunrize boards is still
the best they know of. I hear it repeated over and over.

Thank you sir. Trying not to bleed too much on the *dull but sharp enough cut
the mustard* cutting edge here.

We'll see.

The stock A3000 SCSI bus recognizes the drives and will share them as long
as the SCSI device numbers are different. The boot drives will be on
different busses. No software. Hardware sees the hard drives. 
No hocus pocus. No waving of magic wands.

I'm putting the other boot drive on SCSI2 (via MKII) so there won't be any
boot conflicts via SCSI1 and changing the bootpri also.

Absolutely correct. And it isn't so far off as the Studio16 uses SMPTE for
a timing source and networked A3000's are a powerful way to do
multi-media.

When a spelunk through the source code didn't provide the information,
a question pointed at the appropriate engineer would usually result in
more than one would want to know...

You would be sensing correctly.

"What can be done" has very little to do with what kind of developer

The executables for Studio16 fit onto two 880k floppies.  Someone with
the proper skills who is truly interested in discovering all of the
information
neccessary to interface with the AD516 could do so in a matter of days --
it is not very complicated.  Anything is possible...

Doing both was not achievable with the finite set of resources (time,
people, etc.)
that were available during and after the Studio 16 3.0 release cycle,
period.

As the third-party engineering liason, I would have loved to have been able
to put
together a devkit for Studio16.  It would have been really cool to be able
to use
Studio16 with other sound cards...  with the flyer... with the PAR...

There just wasn't enough time.

>Who else can do *all* what we can do with this "obselete" and *cheap* stuff

Well, just to play devil's advocate, most hardware stuff is incredibly cheap
on the other platforms. We get lucky in categories where we use the same
hardware. Also, much great software is cheaper than we tend to think (but
the premium packages make up for it). And by the time you've got everything
in a PC working together . . . <eyes roll>

But creative people of different stripes rallied around the Mac or the Amiga
and it still seems to me that Amiga people are capable of getting more done
in more areas with stuff that is "dead" than most of their counterparts
elsewhere.

Hope that after using your SCSI network awhile you will share the pros and
cons. I think some synchronization issues will especially interest others
here.

>>That throughput thing was a problem in the Flyer's early history too.

>Yeah but as I say, they saw it through and it has paid off but it seems
>it's about to be eclipsed by other platforms.

The Flyer editing experience can be godlike! The interface is deceptively
simple and results are so immediate. It's possible to be creative here, and
fast, and come in under budget. I believe some of the other stuff on the
other platforms is actually sidetracking to clients and producers. (But so
are all the great plug-ins and 3rd party stuff for the Flyer, I suppose.)

That is actually the way I felt when first seeing Studio16v3.01. What a tool
for AV work! Back in the Now: just fix and add a few things, mostly to cut
out intermediate steps, and WHAMMO! -- again, its clobbering time!

Aah, to have that power: to change what has gone before. But I am amazed
that the Amiga still stands after what we have been through. So many key
categories of software and hardware no longer exist as live projects; so
many newer concepts have never been done here because it takes a team, not
just a lone coder posting to Aminet.

And yet I have hope. There are encouraging signs *everywhere* on the web (as
well as some obvious downers). I just wish some of those lone programmers
would build the smaller things that would help, instead of all those games
and Demos. But that's just me . . .

I could always make a script that allow you to search for a keyword in the
entry paths that you want to process instead of or in addition to groups or
selected entries.

>I would love to see some sort of mirroring ability as GreenyBoy

I'm not sure if you mean Sample edits or Cuelist track edits here ?

QMaster doesn't process samples yet (other than some preferences - though
full sample editing is planned to be implemented in a future version), but
to mirror tracks isn't a problem. The script can copy all entries timecode
wise and then exchange for example the _L with _R in the sample path/name
and set PAN accordingly. No problem, or did you think of sample clips/edits?

>Destructive edits would be ignored.

Yup, when applying a desctructive edit you will remove (or copy) sample data
on the physical file. With non-destuctive edits the clips are stored as
pointers in the sample header. Earsing these will bring back your orginal
file (Undo all for instance).

>Kenny, how about adding a SMPTE offset calculator.  One that includes
>"plus" values (100ths of frames) as well as BPM.

Noted. You can do mathematically operations on SMPTE already. One of the
tutor scripts I work on now shows how:

If you want to add:  01:23:45:12 (NTSC) to 00:02:45:07 you do this:

        SmpteToSeconds "NTSC" "00:02:45:06"
        number=result

        SmpteToSeconds "NTSC" "01:23:45:12"
        adder=result

        SecondsToSMPTE "NTSC" number+adder
        say result

>> 01:26:30:18

The numbers can be asked via a string requester and video system can be
autodetected (PAL/NTSC) or chosen by user.

I will support PLUS and BPM in a future version.

You can easily convert PAL to NTSC too and vica verca (while we're at it):

        SmpteToSeconds "PAL" "00:34:51:22"
        SecondsToSMPTE "NTSC" result
        say result

>> 00:34:51:26

i love my flyer setup, but i hate to way it handles audio.  assuming you

Yeah, as a dealer I bugged NewTek bi-weekly to make sure they considered
supporting the AD516 for the Flyer. But there are many good tools by OzWare,
VisualInspirations, and the like to improve the Flyer's handling of audio.
These programs and the way they interface with NewTek's software are great
examples of what can be achieved with ARexx and an Authoring system.

On its own it is a little too much like what you find on VTRs.

There was a communication problem between the two companies.
SunRize did not share sufficient information with Applied Magic to 
allow for solid support of the 3.0 libraries. This may have been because 
by then Applied Magic was talking about doing their own audio card 
(which eventually materialized as SoundStage). Or it may be for
other reasons (did _anyone_ get 3.x libary development support from 
SunRize?).

Ben is right. The 3.x development cycle went longer than planned 
as it was. A lot of stuff got into Studio 16 that wasn't necessarily 
supposed to be there, but we can be thankful for it now. The
development team did an incredible job of stuffing more features
and capabilities into 3.x than was reasonable in that amount of
time.   :^)

That's why I was brought in. The original documentation,  what little there
was, really sucked. 

I did a really quick "get something out the door" manual that was printed,
and then methodically created a really nice manual. But that final manual
was never printed due (I think) to the financial state of the company
at the time. Eventually someone at AM made it into an AmigaGuide
online document.

> NewTek has always had good, maybe great, manuals. 

NewTek has shipped their share of incomplete and insufficient
documentation. I was a beta tester of the Toaster starting at
version ".9". The early manuals were sketchy at best.

LightWave didn't get a decent manual until 5.0, IMHO. 5.5's is 
even better.

NewTek's developer support has been both good and bad. But
they have tried to include other developers as part of their overall
process. We (at Questar Productions) have enjoyed working with 
them.

It almost was. There were talks between SunRize and both companies.
SunRize took an active role with Applied Magic for a while, and that's
why the 2.x libraries work.

Applied Magic had their own problems as well. They then gambled on
the PowerPC as an open system and that went about as well as the
Amiga. They have lived through all of that and now they develop for NT.
Their new products are the OnStage 29 bit audio card and the upcoming
OnScene wavelet-based video editing card. The OnScene has a PPC chip 
on the card to allow real time dissolves, so their PPC experience counts for 
something. Specs on both cards look exceptional.

Pirates are leeches. Malingering is OK as long as folks don't 
whine later about lost opportunities.   :^)
 
I've always malingered long enough to carefully evaluate what
it is I really need and which tools are heading that way. Then I jump 
in with both feet flying and never look back. My commitment to
the tools I use has often resulted in getting involved in beta testing,
design consulting and manual writing. Before I started getting involved
on that level I wrote articles and reviews for a variety of magazines.

There's room in this world to make a difference. I am delighted to
see this mailing list full of people making a difference right now
with Studio 16/AD516, even after SunRize is gone!

Cool. Well perhaps Helm would be worth considering for a 
quick GUI.

Since I worked for both companies as a contractor, I'll pass along 
what I saw at the time.

Applied Magic and SunRize were both around simultaneously.
I don't know which company was formed first.

Like other companies with new wiz-bang video hardware at 
that time, AM showed their video hardware long before they
shipped anything. I saw it at several shows, including an NAB 
probably a year before the Broadcaster shipped.

When the Broadcaster was a working product, Anthony flew down to 
San Diego at one point to help AM with AD516 support. This helped 
result in the Broadcaster working with the 2.x libraries.

AFAIK problems developed between the two companies that resulted 
in AM designing their own audio hardware, and SunRize being less
interested in helping them support the newer libraries for the AD516. 
SunRize was already more than busy getting Studio 16 3.x out the door
and Ben was a big part of the success of 3.x.

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

Ooops.. I believe Jamie was refering to a Broadcaster manual here.

The predecessor to Applied Magic (DMI) was around at the
same time as SunRize.

As third party engineering liason, I went along with Anthony to visit
DMI...  We went specifically to help them analyze a problem they
were having interfacing with the AD516.  We discovered a design
flaw with the DMI hardware, and were placed in the uncomfortable
position of having to tell DMI that their design wouldn't work well
enough to stream both audio and video reliably.  Before the trip,
we put together some API code that could interface to the 3.0 way
of doing things, but since the DMI problems went beyond the scope
of interfacing with the AD516, we decided not to give DMI those
APIs.

Ben.

Yeah, I was there at v.9 also. But compared to _many_ then and now, they got

and their books covered lots of ground in a painless fashion. Of course, you

Yeah, they were back-and-forthy with dealers also. But _always_ they had
something going besides the stonewall I came to know and love elsewhere.
Dean Tucker really did some nice promos for Sunrize dealers, BTW.

CBM management never cared enough to do what Apple did: in conjunction with
contributing developers declare and enforce standards. Therefore each
developer was on its own, or making alliances that often failed due to
percieved conflicts of interest. As the PC and Mac became more capable --
largely because of device independent drivers and other standards, the Amiga
became more obviously crippled, and developers each off in their own corners.

So you see the bagel, and not the hole? My projects have always involved
advocacy, trade-shows, user-groups, beta-testing, bugging developers,
bugging distributors, etc. One of my current projects is to bug advertizers
back into the pages of AMAZING by emailing and other forms of -- well,
bugging! (See sig.) Then, well, then I'm gonna start in on former AMAZING
/writers/ . . . Jamie . . .     ;-].

I'm not much of a programmer and my hardware projects are on a back burner

in this networking project. Should know by the middle of next week.

This is why the parent company of the platform needs to be involved with
standards. It seems that at the start of each new mini-era in computing, one
or more visionaries introduce fresh concepts and tools. The possibilities of
the child they have fostered begin to ripple outward.

At this point, others are examining the new child for flaws and potential.
Soon perhaps they will spawn their version. The _proud_ platform parent does
not ignore the potential for conflict. The parent sets down guidelines so
that all the children have the opportunity to grow healthily.

Bill "with pie" Gates uses slightly different methods to establish standards
than the people in the Mac world. Still, you get the idea.

Can it duplicate regions?   This piano track I referred to could be
one 30min long sample, that in the end is 5 or 10 regions of that
sample with crossfades.

this too although this is more intensive a process.  It is much like
the regions in the cuelist above, but contained within the
non-destructive edits of the sample. For instance in the Editor you
might copy some silent noise from the top of the sample and use it to
replace the space between two passages of music that had some
extraneous

in the graph file because I have deleted them and still had my "Editor
Regions" defined.)

Sorry about my last post.  It was incomplete due to my clicking the
Send button instead of the Editor button.

as I was saying...

this too although this is more intensive a process.  It is much like
the regions in the cuelist above, but contained within the
non-destructive edits of the sample. For instance in the Editor you
might copy some silent noise from the top of the sample and use it to
replace the space between two passages of music that had some
extraneous interference.  Most times I do this as a non-destructive 
edit.  It achieves the same result as creating and moving regions in 
the cuelist but is more precise for detail work.


>>Destructive edits would be ignored.

I have always wondered where and how these were stored. 
Is the sample header a part of the sample file itself?



>I will support PLUS and BPM in a future version.

Cool!

Wow, you could actually talk to your engineers and ask them questions?
Oh, I forget, not all companies "design by comittee" in near solitude
like the people I work for (Siemens). It really shows in some of our
products. One module is almost totally different from the other, and
getting a question answered takes forever. 
I guess when you work *together*, printed docs probably would be
superfluous.

Whaaa? It has a lot to do with it. If there is clear documentation on
how the hardware and software were engineered, it's a lot easier for
someone to pick up where things were left off at. I think the point is
that it's a whole lot simpler and quicker and less prone to mistakes
 to use documentation rather than reverse-engineering and guessing.

Excellent! If it can be done without docs, then so be it.
I am truly interested, but unfortunately am not close to having the
proper skills. Hopefully someone reading this fills the bill?

>Can it duplicate regions?

Sure, regions are basically just preset crops-in/out and they can be copied
as well. To copy an entry to f.ex. another track just do:

        GetEntry FileID TrackA Entry ENTRYSTEM
        SetEntry FileID TrackB ENTRYSTEM

(where FileID, TrackA/B and Entry are preinitialized)

This will copy all data from an entry to another entry including pan,
volume, cropin/out, fadein/out, fadetypes, startposition, endposititon etc.
You can change Pan, volume etc. inbetween the two comands simply by altering
those fields only:

        ENTRYSTEM.PAN=newpanvalue
        ENTRYSTEM.VOLUME.newvolumevalue
        ENTRYSTEM.CROPIN=newcropinvalue
        [...]

And then SetEntry.

>I have always wondered where and how these were stored.
>Is the sample header a part of the sample file itself?

Yes, a sample file is built like this:

        [ID = "KWK3"]
        [SampleInfo - filter,freq,vol,pan,smpte,float][realsize,editsize]
        [EditClips x 128 (table of start/stop-1 entries) ]
        [Regions   x  32 (table of name, SampleInfo) ]
       -
        [Sample data itself]

SampleInfo contains the most important info on the sample. A file always
contains one SampleClip (describing the whole file). The regions are
seperate SampleInfo chunks which can contain its own settings for volume,
pan, smpte, frequency etc. and is recogniced by the region name. The Regions
only contains cropin/out, not any sampleclips. In future version of QMaster
it will allow you to handle regions in samplefiles so you can f.ex. search a
directory for a region name to put in the cuelist file etc.

The editsize in the main SampleClip is the sum of all the EditClips while
realsize reflects the actual size of the in sampleframes (file/2-header).

Studio 16 has own seek(), read() and write() functions to handle the
sampleclips so that if you seek to a certain position in the file the
function will make sure it is relative to the sampleclips and not the real
position. When one use the Make Permanent function it will copy all sample-
data ranges defined by the SampleClips table to a new temp file, delete the
old and rename the temp file back to the original name. It's a quite simple
process, but very clever (often the simpliest things in life are the best
things :)

An example table (not realistic numbers here):

        Start:  120   Stop:  500 ( 501-1)
        Start:  600   Stop: 1012 (1013-1)

Realsize is 1012 and you made a cut in position 0-120 and 500-600 which you
can see by the table. If you then Make permanent the file it will copy the
data 120->500 + 600->1012 which make the new filesize 792 (pluss header).
The numbers reflect number of sampleframes.

So, basically, you can undo any of the edits you like by simply delete a
SampleClip entry (start/stop). You can also copy the list onto another file
of the same length if you for instance want to map edits from left channel
to right channel if you only did edits on one of the files (of some reason).

With arexx you can also extend for example numbers of regions by putting
them in a seperate file and then use this file to put on entry on a cuelist
via QMaster. Probably not a very usuful thing to do, but its just to show
that you are not limited anymore.

Right, they have the Sound Stage Pro which I have. Its processor acts as a
coprocessor to the Elite to speed video transition renderings, it has 4
channel balanced IO, plus it has 8 megs of on board memory, so it somewhat
surpasses AD516's capabilities. The software is by Maurizio. It utilizes
Studio 16's format, so all samples are compatible with S16.

I sent an article about ARexx programming to Amazing a couple of years ago and
didn't even get an acknowledgement. However, I am a faithful reader, even when
it is almost 100% Shamms Mortier.

Give it a month or two, then start stirring them up to buy BoXeRs.

I get the feeling that the staff is all too busy. But AMAZING really needs
other writers, subject material, and especially product reviews. The reader
wants the information, and so does the advertizer. While the product is
*fresh*.

Yeah, so many of us lost our shorts in the Amiga marketplace . . . [^%

In one post you gave me a world of insight.

This is sooo cool.  It all makes sense now, very logical,  and once
again I see the beauty of Sunrizes programming.

Obviously there is tremendous power in QMaster as the genie is let out
of the lamp and made to do our bidding.

Now I KNOW you have something that every Studio16 owner must have, 
without a doubt.

I'm sorry I haven't had very much follow through on
