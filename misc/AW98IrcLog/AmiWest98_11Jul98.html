<CENTER><H1><a href="http://wordbench.com/dfd/">DFDuck's</a> #AmiWest98 IRC Conference Logs 11-Jul-98</H1></CENTER>

This is my complete log. Unaltered other than editing out my private messages,
reformatting of text to make it readable (ever try reading an AmIRC log?), and
adding html tags top and bottom. I missed the beginning of both days. I started
logging at 1:15pm the 11th and 10:26am the 12th. If anyone has those times logged
I would really appreciate a copy of them.

Carl      |TB:  music is going.
KarlosI   |Carl: What's the different between a red pass and a green pass 
          |around your guy's neck?
Winter0   |Carl: well, seeing as how you're one of the programmers primarily 
          |responsible for the computer sitting before me, i figured you'd 
          |be a good person to ask this:  how does one get into programming? 
          | where does one *start?*
WowTIP    |Carl: I think you should change your slogan: "REBOL - The 
          |language of the free"...

KarlosI   |Winter: With the bascis!! ;)

Winter0   |thanks, Carl. ;)
_bladez_  |lol
KarlosI   |Carl: We would if we had an Amiga version of REBOL
Jkay      |Carl: I dont think you replied earlier; your re-emergence into 
          |the Amiga community is setting you up for cult hero status along 
          |the lines of Dave Haynie. Do you realise this, and do you intend 
          |to use your new powers for good or evil?
_bladez_  |when shall we see the infamous REBOL in real life? ;)
Carl      |The Amiga version will be ready the same time any version is 
          |ready.
KarlosI   |rotflol
snapper   |Karlosl There is, be patient for the beta release
Carl      |Or maybe, ever so slightly before that.
TB        |If REBOL realy is that easy, it'd be good for me.  I couldnt code 
          |if I tried, unless Im using the Jade enviroment (plug).

DFDuck    |I'm waiting for REBOL too. Been hacing out arexx since '87 and am 
          |told REBOL is more powerful and compact.
Gaz       |WowTIP: hmm? how can you have java without a jvm
WowTIP    |laire: yeah, ask Bill G, he's got some money... ;)
TB        |TheB: Ya mean the OO development enviroment made by Cardinal 
          |which kicks ass? (http://www.jade.co.nz) ? ;)
Carl      |Java is a good sys-prog language... but it's pretty uptight and 
          |hampered.
TheBarron |TB: I just have to wonder if I really care :)
_bladez_  |tb: well port it over to the amiga dude :)
Gaz       |Carl: atleast amiga users wont be stuck for software on java tho
TB        |bla: Theres already an Amiga machine there!!!
WowTIP    |Gaz: I mean, JAVA (the language) rocks, but when you run ith 
          |through JVM it gets awfully slow...
_bladez_  |tb: cool ... maybe i'll be able to try to patch a smalltalk in 
          |there ;)
WowTIP    |Gaz: Learn ASM and make a JAVA-compiler for amiga... ;)
Gaz       |WowTIP: i see.. but thats how all java is ran isnt it? its 
          |compiled just in time in a jvm?

Gaz       |WowTIP: depends if they release JVMPPC ;-))))
_bladez_  |tb: where is here? NZ?
Jkay      |Carl: Maybe you don't know. By showing up at Amiga conventions, 
          |and being vocal in the community while promoting REBOL you will 
          |effectively become a cult worship figure .. you're like an Old

TB        |caster: maybe... maybe not.
TB        |Unless Bill says yes, it aint :)

TheBarron |Lambertus: the thing is that power usage is usually sporatic,

          |extended periods of times, whereas the sun can be charging the 
          |batteries as well as providing power through the low-need

TheBarron |sidewind: anything beyond the crystal you just mentioned on the

sidewind  |then i'd have enough power consantly with 12 more batteries and 
          |the dc/ac converter equipment
sidewind  |TheBarron: yea i can give you a website hold on..
sidewind  |wind mill generators are also cool..
sidewind  |good thing things about this is the goverment can SUBSITISE alot 
          |of your bills :)
TheBarron |nice, but not nearly so cool :)
Lambertus |They SOUND coll at least (when standing close to a big one)
admv0rl0n |at least announce the damn pc 68xxx card and software.
sidewind  |in programs they are starting up
Gunrunner |wind mills aren't cost effective due to high maintance costs.
admv0rl0n |gunrunner - thats engineering
admv0rl0n |they could be.
sidewind  |here's an interesting page
sidewind  |http://www.energyoutfitters.com/
Gunrunner |wind mills were really popular in the US for awhile but most ppl 
          |could never recover the savings in their lifetime, unless you 
          |installed one when you were in your 20's.
sidewind  |it feels good to have computers running from the sun
Jkay      |oo .. admiralvorlon on Amiganet.
Lambertus |Ah.. I'm still in my 20s
sidewind  |i mean to me other than the battery maintanance when the sun is 
          |up i just go direct and don't even worry about leaving things on 
          |:)
admv0rl0n |the real idea should be in australia, solar ranches could be a

TheBarron |sidewind: I won't give up 60+ wat light bulbs.. at least, not

admv0rl0n |lets forget it and get on with the show
sidewind  |light that is
Jkay      |admv0rl0n: I had no idea.

          |light
sidewind  |even better than florecence :)
sidewind  |floresence
Kreton    |I use halogen straight filament bulbs
sidewind  |TheBarron: true i don't have white light i use LED and electro 
          |luminecence
TheBarron |florescent sucks because of the 60Hz flicker
sidewind  |red green yellow and sometimes blue
TheBarron |Halogen puts off too much heat
Lambertus |Philips 'saving lamps' are 18 W or such
sidewind  |basically there is going to be a revolution in  light
TheBarron |now.. if they ever figure out white-light emitting LEDs... :)
sidewind  |with Luminecence ElectroLuminecence and LED 'WHITE lights
sidewind  |'
TheBarron |sidewind: LED white isn't discovered yet, though :)
GaFlunkey |blue ones are what is needed
sidewind  |anywhere from 7-1 watts with the capacity of full room lighting

Kernel-1  |anyone know if there is still going to be a show in Ohio in 
          |October?
gregr     |Haven't heard otherwise.  They're talking it up on the Amiga.com 
          |site.
Yrag      |My retina ZIII on an A3000/25 is not as fast as my P100 S3 
          |displaying jpegs...
gregr     |(that one I get to go to.  I'm in Cleveland. :)
Kernel-1  |I really want to attend.  My sister lives in columbus... I'll 
          |leave the woman with her and my nephew and go to the show :)
Nite_Hawk |that comes as a suprise?
gregr     |I've been to Columbus both years.  It was pretty good, though 
          |last year was much better than the first.
Kernel-1  |I basically just want to be able to surf with more color.  I 
          |could go for a 175.00 Spectrum, but that only has 2MB of RAM on 
          |it.  I thought of a PIV because it's got 4MB and it's one of the 
          |latest, but that is 379.00.  I'm so confused...
Kernel-1  |if I go we'll have to get together.

Kernel-1  |did anyone else hear of the 64/3D being discontinued and why?

tamaron   |p5 and ppc split eh
tamaron   |They are going to do the soft emul thing are they not
Kernel-1  |jcompton of Amiga Report?  (Probably Dumb Question)
jcompton  |tamaron: It seems to be a possibility (Haage and Partner have 
          |been developing an emulator for a while now) and with reports 
          |that Motorola will shortly cancel all 68K production, it's rather 
          |necessary.
jcompton  |Kernel: Yes.
Kernel-1  |Hmmm... is there a mailing list for Amiga Report, or is it just 
          |available on the web now?
tamaron   |yeah i guess that would make it necessary
jcompton  |Kernel: There's still a mailing list although you get a LOT of 
          |mail.  (it's hundreds of K long, and then UUencoding increases 
          |the size 33%).
jcompton  |Kernal: With the really infrequent release schedule you're 
          |probably just better off either on the announcement list, or just 
          |watching Aminet NEW and the websites.

          |Fish's company).  If I was still putting out AR biweekly I'd say 
          |yes, but it's so infrequent now it doesn't seem to be a problem.

Cluster   |spuug: If for example, on a 430TX chipset motherboard you have 
          |512kb L2 cache, and you have more than 64Mb of RAM, then anything

          |can't really go above that. I'd have to get a new MB
jakobX    |cluster: dont use an intel chipset then

Cluster   |jakobx: it is a hit
Cluster   |jakobx: compare the average latency of 40ns for SDRAM, and 6ns to 
          |10ns for L2 cache
jakobX    |cluster: only a couple of percent
Arvid     |spuug: the GPS's which we fly are all Motorola, with no altitude
