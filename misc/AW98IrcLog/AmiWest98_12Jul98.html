<CENTER><H1><a href="http://wordbench.com/dfd/">DFDuck's</a> #AmiWest98 IRC Conference Logs 12-Jul-98</H1></CENTER>

This is my complete log. Unaltered other than editing out my private messages,
reformatting of text to make it readable (ever try reading an AmIRC log?), and
adding html tags top and bottom. I missed the beginning of both days. I started
logging at 1:15pm the 11th and 10:26am the 12th. If anyone has those times logged
I would really appreciate a copy of them.

          |shows a time that would have to be from last night.  I am using 
          |Netscape currently.  Is this THE cam you are reffering to?  Or

RobSDA    |How often should the image update?  I finally saw a 'new' 
          |picture.  But it took like 10 minutes... ???
Yrag      |BW should not be much of an issue...

KarlosI   |BF: Good to hear!! ;)
Wedgie    |karlos: any news on possible conversions ?? realaudio etc and 
          |such netty things
Riley     |blackfire: where can i get str-icq?
Llama     |sadams things chang quick in the computer business, it;s not the

          |shorcuts don't work if the Incoming Messages window is the active 
          |one)
BlackFire |sadams:   And Bill Mc.  appologized many times for the lack of 
          |info on AmigaNG and promises that that won't be the case from now 
          |on.  "I Promise!"  So send him email if you feel left out.
Llama     |sadams that means AmigaNG will be born with the fast available 
          |technology, no more playing catchup to everyone else
BlackFire |Riley, I will put up a web page before next weekend.
pekr      |llama: why are you so sure? Wait for G4 AltiVEc which is due to 
          |be out 1Q99(?)

          |RealAudio to the Amiga!
DFDuck    |BlackFire: Ahah.. was using left by habit.

sadams    |i envision obstacles flying about the AmiWEST98 Hall!
Llama     |pekr Ya, G4 will start to catch up, but it isnlt as flexible or 
          |as cost effective, so AmigaNG willstill have the edge out of the 
          |gate ;)
KarlosI   |Remember the ICOA is still in it's infancy, and will become what 
          |defvfelopers wish it to be!!

Blondie   |Black: any decision on OS 3.5 ?
Blondie   |ie. to give it to 3rd parties to produce?
BlackFire |I haven't heard anything about OS 3.5
Llama     |BlackFire Finale Web Cruiser was cancelleed and JKay announced 
          |that publicly, it;s DEAD
BlackFire |Olaf Barthel announced the Amiga Developers CD v2.1 with full 
          |RKMs for 3.1 in, at least, HTML format.
pekr      |llama: 6 companies working on similiar chips covering similiar 
          |performance, or just cooperating or what?
DFDuck    |Hmm. I'd have to scroll back but I'm sure someone said 3.5 is 
          |officialy dead.
Blondie   |Black: is Carl Sassenrath working for Amiga Inc. on contract?
Llama     |pekr They are all very similar
BlackFire |Llama, thats not what Chris Aldi said.  Guess they need to work 
          |out which is right.
BlackFire |Blondie, Carl S. is working on REBOL full time.  AI is, 
          |obviously, aware of his work and at some time in the future they 
          |may discuss something.
Blondie   |DFDuck: as far as amiga inc. development, yes, but 3rd parties 
          |were interested
spock1    |BlackFire: I thought I heard that realaudio, shockwave were not 
          |going to be ported to the Amiga because the Authors refused to

DFDuck    |manatee: Then maybe I will incorperate your help if I get stuck. 
manatee   |DFDuck: :)
DFDuck    |Rebbi: From what I gathered.... AI officially dripped OS3.5 but a 
          |few 3rd parties are interested in developing it. The big 
          |announcement of last night was that there might be a big 
          |announcement in 30 days. And that the new chip name is 
          |"Multimedia RISC" but there is no specs because there is no such chip.

Rebbi     |DFD: Yikes...  that's it?  Sounds like maybe they're having

DFDuck    |Rebbi: No new hardware was shown. No new software to speak of, 
          |only newer versions of existing softwares. Lots of sales of 
          |t-shirts, buttons, caps, glasses, mugs, CD's.
DFDuck    |Rebbi: And they are planning an AmiWest99 again in Sacramento but 
          |at a different location.  (I asked the co-organizer).
Rebbi     |DFD: But I wonder how attandance was?  And how close PNolan is to 
          |finishing Photogenics NG -- it looked fab at St. Louis.
DFDuck    |Rebbi: They only had 500 tickets printed and sold them fairly 
          |quick. So not bad for a 1st time show.
Rebbi     |DFD: Yes.
DFDuck    |Mostly just a big Amiga party as far as I can see. No real info 
          |or new goodies.
