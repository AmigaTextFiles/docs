Subject: [just-amiga] StrICQ problem
X-UIDL: 3f3018d7ad3e4b35798d0b25677ab23d

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi,

My StrICQ just says 'going online' at the top of the window and then
does nothing, If i open the register UIN window then my number
will appear and i can send people messages etc.

But then after about 50 seconds it goes offline?

Any ideas?

Toodle Pip!

My guess would be that you are using a overloaded server! Which server do
you use?

Great, then it isn't just me having that problem after all. It's a rather
peculiar bug in stricq, and the workaround is to open one of its windows
(preferably the log window, hit Amiga-4 to open it) every 10 seconds or so.
This is very inconvenient, but de facto the only way to stay online.

You don't have to close the window before re-hitting Amiga-4, not even
deactivate it. It's like stricq falls asleep, and you have to keeep hitting
that key combination to keep it awake. (Much like I'm feeling now.. yawn)

What TCP stack are you using? If it is Miami you must be using 2.1p at
least or it will do what you are talking about. You might want to read
the faq and it will tell you about these things. Also you might want to
subscribe to the stricq list at :

majordomo@owlnet.net

put     subscribe stricq-list       in the body of the mail

It only gets a few mails each day and there are some helpful people
there.

Doug's stricq page is at http://www.owlnet.net/amiga/stricq

Hope this helps

Kenneth

Yeah it does.  Just the sort of information I was looking for.  I don't
want to cause myself grief to save a few dollars.  I would hate for one
of those plugs to come loose and cause damage.

Thanks Don.

Just wanted to be clear on one thing. The plugs were never a
problem.

One thing I neglected to mention was that there was a tape to put
over the bottom vents while you filled the cart. HP carts needed
to be pressurized with a little syringe like pump that was
included. Later kits required that you let the cart. sit for 15
minutes to stop any dripping present. Once they were filled they
were great. In fact, I liked their ink better than the original.

Thanks for the claification.  I know the kits have been around for
quite awhile so they are probably safe.  I saw a number of different
kits at the local computer store for HP's but I am using an Epson.
Maybe I'll look into it a bit more.  Fortunately they last several
months for me.

last full distribution "stable" version is 0.1371 :) But all thebetas to

Collas out as Amiga president

Top exec gone after less than eight months at the helm of Gateway
subsidiary.

By Charles Cooper, ZDNN
September 1, 1999 11:39 AM PT

Jim Collas has resigned as president of Amiga after less than nine months on
the job.

It was not clear why Collas left the post. A spokesman for the company said
Collas had resigned to pursue personal interests. Amiga said it had promoted
vice-president and chief operating officer, Tom Schmidt, to fill the
vacancy.

Separately, Collas registered to sell 118,000 shares of Gateway's common
stock, according to forms released Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

The departure of Collas comes less than a month after the company
orchestrated a high-profile coming-out party for the unit, which is a
separate subsidiary of Gateway.

Gateway (NYSE:GTW), which paid about $13 million to acquire the rights to 47
Amiga patents, is attempting to revive the once-popular computer brand.
Collas and other executives involved in the project had indicated interest
in developing Internet-related products based around Amiga technology.

Collas, who held a variety of management posts during his seven years at
Gateway, had eagerly pressed company CEO Ted Waitt and was subsequently
granted the top job at Amiga in January.

He also urged Waitt to let him run Amiga as a separate company.

Before joining Amiga, Schmidt worked as a general manager for Allied Signal,
running one of the company's business units. He was not immediately
available for comment.

Subject: [just-amiga] Digital Camera as a Webcam?
X-UIDL: 7be472f5667a6f5ddfb6de5401854aed

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi All,

Does anyone know if its possible to use a Digital Camera as a webcam
and if it is then I guess you'd need an extra serial port in the blanking
plate space, ie, one for your internet connection and the other to
transfer the pictures.

Is there any Amiga webcam software out there that can do this type
of thing?

Toodle Pip!

   As far as I know, no.  If there is a digital cam. with software controls and an amiga program that supports it, you could have it take a picture and download it every couple of secconds or so, then /in theory/ it would work.

> Is there any Amiga webcam software out there that can do this type

   I think that there is a pack with a b&w video camera and s/w. I think it plugs into the parallel port, but I don't think the software can use it as a web cam. I may be wrong though.

See ya :)

Yep, you'll need two serial ports.  Personally, I use my Surf Squirrel
for my modem and stick the digicam on my A1200s internal serial port.

> Is there any Amiga webcam software out there that can do this type
> of thing?

Well - if the software you use with the camera supports ARexx, it
is relatively to knock up a short script to act as a webcam - i.e.
the script tells the software to take a picture, and then save it to
the ram disk, for example.  Then, in the script, you can put a little
something together to upload it to your webspace or whereever.  Stick
it all in a loop to execute every 30 seconds or something, and you've
got a webcam :)  Of course, things are even easier when the digicam is
connected to the computer which is actually hosting the website in
question :)

Hi,

This is not really to do with the Amiga, well it is sort of but not
directly.

Does anyone know of an T-Shirt printers who will maybe do small
amounts of prints, good quality at a cheap price.

Or does anyone know of any T-Shirt printers that are good :)?

In the UK that is!

If it is only small amounts _and_ it is on white shirts then think of 
doing it your self . It's not difficult

Subject: [just-amiga] [digital-images-news] Digital Images Update (fwd)
X-UIDL: 07671e371680b37c196917c76a269109

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi All,

It seems Digital Images have back out the door.

I am slightly annoyed by this because yet we have see nothing from
them either but promisses and now they act as if they saved the
Amiga in the first place.

Surely they should test the water before backing out, no?

*** FORWARDED MESSAGE ***
  Original author: Stuart Walker
  Written on: 03-Sep-99
*** Beginning of forwarded message ***

To Amiga users worldwide,

Due to recent announcements and problems with Amiga, Digital Images
regrets
that we will be suspending all AmigaMCC projects including Sabrina
Offline.
Space Station 3000 and Wipeout 2097 will be released as planned, but we
will
be suspending all other Amiga developments until further notice.

Everyone behind Digital Images has enthusiastically supported the Amiga
through the good times and the bad times. But with the recent troubles
with
Amiga, the entire team has unanimously decided to suspend all Amiga
developments (with the exception of Space Station 3000 and Wipeout 2097).
We
regret to have to take these measures, but Digital Images cannot afford
to
spend time, resources and money developing for a computer which now, as
it
seems may never appear.

We hope that everybody reading this understands our position as this is
the
last thing that any of us would ever have wanted to do, but Amiga have
made
promise after promise that something would appear, but it has not. 

We deeply regret this decision, but it is a final measure that has to be
taken. We wish that we wouldn't have to go this far, but we now have no
other option - it is the last thing that any of us wanted to do. We would
appreciate it if everybody understood our position and wouldn't send
e-mails
of anger and abuse. We have done everything in our power to avoid this,
but
it just isn't possible. 

If the Amiga does indeed rise again, which we hope it does, we will
return.

We hope that you will enjoy our upcoming releases of Space Station 3000
and
Wipeout 2097.

If you do have any questions or queries concerning this announcement,
please
e-mail info@digital-images.demon.co.uk

We thank you all once again for your loyal and devoted support.

Kind Regards,

Stuart Walker
Digital Images

From: ja-list@tkgbbs.freeserve.co.uk


 On Thursday September 02 1999, Chris Seward said to All:

 CS> Does anyone know if its possible to use a Digital Camera as a webcam

Should be possible - I'm sure the camera software has ARexx so you can
take and pull in an image when you want one. Of course, it also depends how
long it takes to download images from the camera..

 CS> and if it is then I guess you'd need an extra serial port in the
 CS> blanking plate space, ie, one for your internet connection and the
 CS> other to transfer the pictures.

Erm..

If you connect via modem on the same machine, you would need two
serial ports.  It really doesn't matter where the second port is ;-)

 CS> Is there any Amiga webcam software out there that can do this type of
 CS> thing?

You really don't need any dedicated web cam software.  All you'd be
doing is updating a file every so often.

PMFJI but I have been trying to accomplish this.  It would seem all
I need to do it to be able to print in reverse but I don't see how
to do this.  I have TurboPrint but don't see an option for this.
Can you explain to me what I am missing?

I must have missed something! What problems with Amiga?
A bit more information is required so that I can understand this.
Is it because Collas has resigned? A linux kernal? The MCC in the
first quarter of 2000?

With the development time for a game,unless the game is a world beater,
they will be very late to market,lessening their chances of making money!
Especially if ,when the new machine arrives,there is a dearth of software
for it

Which have been in development for how long?

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga show in a central UK location possible?
X-UIDL: 4971b000c8c239ca8e47a1f54a7e4add

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Heylo!

I was just thinking that for a few years now the main Amiga show of
Great Britain has been held in London which may seem like a central
place but really is not. London is a complex place with high prices
and for some it is too far to travel.

The people who ran this years WoA surely covered their expense
otherwise they would not have run the show. One major factor of
expense to cover is the cost of renting a venue in london which
I suppose could be even double or triple the price of a 'hall' or
'area' in another part of the country depending on what size
you rent.

Then I hear people moan that it is not a good location for them, me
included, but nothing is ever done. The people who ran WoA are
just normal people like you and me and surely one of us could
start planning an Amiga show in a location to be more reasonable
to people.

Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham are all major places with
many more included so why doesn't someone have an idea to
start a show up. I'm sure lots of people will help out and show
support, you could even gather interest to see which location
will pull the biggest crowds and then go and look for a suitable
place to rent with a big enough size to make it a 'real' show. Not
just a school sports hall because that screams User groups
show, but a professional show like the WoA or as professional
as it could be.

I'm sure many of you in a small group could form a little team to
make something like this and if we throw some ideas around then
surely something could get going?

Damn it, i'd even help whether I could attend or not just for the
fun of things.

I could set up a vote page of certain locations to see which
place people are most likely to travel to which is easy for them.

Come on everyone, does anyone have any ideas on this?!

Toodle Pip!

The latest betas. ie ones from the last couple of days now have the chat
function enabled. Although multichat still isn't supported yet.

Is that on the Aminet? I'll have to give it a go sometime.

It looks like the new Amiga will be nothing more than an interactive TV set, if 
the patents are anything to go by. Collas resigning (and McEwan's contract not 
being renewed, and the total silence) has made everything a bit unclear.

Its funny that they said SS3000 (which I want to see) was finished a few months 
ago, and now they've said that they've put it back a couple of months - their 
site says its only 40% complete now? Whats going on??

And whats going to happen to that Sabrina game they were going to do? I thought 
they'd already signed the rights for it (costing them money in the process)?

Yeppers:) In fact, working 2-way chat (single) has been working since 0.1493
(at least) from my personal experience :) Multichat is partially functional
too. For example a 3rd person can enter the chat but you get a second chat
window with them, they can see you in their single window, but you must type
to each of them seperately as if in 2-way chat. It's odd but it works if you
really want to try it and have plenty of screen real estate. The new chat
windows are quite large unless you set the toolbar.mcc prefs for STRICQ to
images only.

I suggest you talk to AmigaSoc - who did much of the organisation for
this year's WoA. I believe that they already have some plans to move
from London. They have gained a lot of experience from this year's show,
and I'm sure the next one they organise will be even better.

Next year's WoA will either be too large for amateurs to arrange, or
too small for even a school sports hall. It all depends on what
happens at Amiga now Jim has gone.

If you could raise about 20,000 pounds to pay for all the things
that need arranging before the show, I'm sure that would help a lot...

I don't think this is a good idea. WoA location has been discussed to
death on other mail lists, and at the end of the day people's preferences
don't usually match commercial realities.

Do you have PageStream3.x? If so, all you need do is to flip the
object(s) horizontally on the page, then print.

Yes I do but unfortunately the things I want to print were generated
by ImageFX and PageStream won't load them.

Jack, I am sure ImageFX has the ability to mirror and image. There are a number
of other GRFX programs that do this with images. Also, PgS prints all my pics
from ImageFX and every other graphics program I can find. Exactly what format
are the pics in?

If you go to Turbo print prefs then to the graphics page / section ,
you will see in the bottom right a tick box for negative & mirror .

The mirror is the one you are looking for .

You can get some good results , but remember to use white or 
pale tee shirts .

X-UIDL: 097d2d369f1c8e872280cb86fcf6c449

From: "Tony P. Parr" <tony@merlin.net.au>

Greetings All...

Recently various people asked and answered about T-Shirt printing. I offer
the following limited information, based on my own experience:

Original from Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

> Does  anyone  know  of  an  T-Shirt  printers  who will maybe do small

My answer (previously sent privately)

I  own a Canon and have access to an HP_Deskjet and Epson Stylus Color IIs
and  there  are kits including TShirt transfer sheets etc., available that
work on all the above.

I  have  not  used  them  for a while and going from memory, you print the
horizontally  flipped  image (or whatever) on the special sheet, then iron
on to TShirt. Of course if there's no text, there's no need to flip.

Once again from memory, I think there was a special ink cartridge too.

They worked a treat on the 3 or 4 TShirts I did some years ago.

The  only  one  I  see  now is about 3 years old and unless my Son is very
grubby,  it has been washed (as per directions in the kit) many times with
only minor fading.

If  you  follow this route, I think you will have to save your image as an
color  separated  image on to a PC or MAC formatted disk. Printing outlets
don't  seem to have heard of the Amiga (uninformed, benighted people), and
won't be able to load the image. A lot more work for the desired result.

> But thanks again, I may have a go when I get a new printer!

Do  not even attempt using a dot-matrix (pin) printer. The results are, to
say the least, 'orrible. Here in OZ, for example, one can buy the cheapest
Canon  bubble-jet for as low as $A139, complete with bi-directional cable,
and  software  (unfortunately PC oriented). I'm on a low, fixed income and
even I can afford one.  8-)

Why  anyone  would  use  PageStream as their printing program of choice is
beyond me. Why not load the image and print direct from the art program to
the TShirt printing media?

(As an aside, why anyone would use PageStream, period !!)

Please,  no endless mails informing me of the error of my ways and I don't
know what I'm talking about.  8^Q

ImageFX can load/save in many formats including: BMP, ILBM, GIF, JPEG, PCX
and 8 or 24 bit and a plethora of others.

Correct re: mirroring in TurboPRINT, but, unless you're printing text, why
would you want to flip the image, unless you wanted a highlight printed on
a particular side... (read as "overly fussy")   8-)

The vast majority of drawing programs on the Amiga will flip images.

>> You  can get some good results, but remember to use white or pale tee

Not  necessary.  Choose/change the colours in your image with care and you
can  save  your image for printing on any coloured material. I printed all
my  attempts on black. Don't forget, you're not printing direct to TShirt,
but to special media that you iron-on to the material later.

TIP: the background colour of your image must be the transparent colour in
     whatever program you use to draw/alter/save the image.
__________________________________________________________________________

FYI...  PhotoGenics loads/saves in many formats and can flip images in any
direction and can do some fantastic image manipulation.

PersonalPaint will do most things asked of a GFX program. Very powerful.

Below is an overview of THE proggie for converting GFX formats and it does
much, much more. This is what GfxLab24 is capable of, very impressive, I'm
sure you'll agree:

 GfxLab24 OverView
 -----------------

   GfxLab24 is a 24-bit and bitmap image processing program. It runs
   under AmigaOS 3.0 or higher. Here are some of its features:

   - Loading :

        - IFF24
        - IFF 2 & 8 - HAM6 - HAM8
        - JPEG
        - TARGA
        - PNG (bitmap & RGB)
        - Any picture DataType (GIF, BMP, PCX,... etc.)

   - Saving :

        - IFF24
        - IFF 2-8bit, HAM6, HAM8
        - GIF (specs GIF87a et GIF89a)
        - Jfif (JPEG)
        - TARGA.
        - PCX
        - PNG (bitmap & RGB)

   - Display the picture from 2 to 8 bitplanes + HAM6/8, with or
     without a fixed palette (13 halftoning/error diffusion modes).

   - Fast previewing window. Operators are applied in REAL TIME !

   - 24 processing operators:

        - Colour To Gray
        - Mask Filter
        - Brightness
        - Scale (reduction/enlargement by % or with height/width in
          pixels)
        - Crop
        - Emboss
        - Sketch
        - Negative (on any of the three RGB componants)
        - Rotate
        - Bicolor (Turn picture to black and white. 9 halftones.)
        - Flip (horizontal or vertical)
        - Visual Aspect (modify the display and pixels ratios)
        - Quake (horizontally or vertically)
        - Disperse pixel (setting the radius and the probability)
        - Convolve (Applying/Editing/loading/saving matrices library
          of convolution)
        - Remove isolated pixel
        - Quantize palette (Quantizing/loading/saving palette)
        - Balance filter (modify gamma,sin,brightness,contrast)
        - Fade (fading between two pictures)
        - Whirl
        - Brush copy (with transparent color)
        - Text
        - Noise (white or coloured)
        - Mosaic

   - Built-in Virtual Memory management, available on ANY
     Amiga computer, even WITHOUT MMU, and fully adjustable.

   - Intuition 3.0 interface, and preference management.

   - ARexx Port allowing automatic processing. Some ARexx scripts are
     provided as example.

   - Best of all, GfxLab24 is FREEWARE !!

There is also a neat little proggie called Transition which does single or
batch conversions of image file formats.

Hope this is of some help to those budding Warhols, Turners or Picassos.

Several of the major exhibitors did not like the venue for many diffrent
financial reasons , A letter from one of them was posted on the cu-list 
a while back ( I will try to find it in the archives)

There is alot more to organising a show of that size than you think .

snip-->

My own gripe was spending  80 + on train fairs and carrying large boxes
back on the train 

or Car petrol costs for around trip of 400+ miles and rooms 150 +

That would cancell out any savings on hardware bought :-(

Savings on new gear is prob one of the main reasons for going .

We concided a stand for our user group but it would have cost us
 300 for travel & accom & food & drink for just two of us .

Any one printing through turboprint ( don't we all ?) there is a tick

for just this option (see below )

The quality of the sheets is the same as for any paper -- the better quality
sheets last longer look better ect. The same applies to the image . Cartoon
images can be printed in lower resolutions ,
a180x180 cartoon we look fine , for photo pics 750x750 is a min.

For dot maktrix printers you can get special ribbons , but the quality is
not quite as good .

yep you are right but even some images need to be mirrored

There are diffrent types of papers & even special cloth for printing on dark
colours 
you would find it very dificult to print accurate colours on dark shirts
with most papers,
I would recomend the special cloth for that type of work .

Duh!  You are right.  When I first got ImageFX I had saved a file
and tried to load it into PS.  It didn't work so I never thought
about trying it again.  It was a jpeg.  I was just too busy playing
with ImageFX to look into it further.  I tried loading as an ilbm
and it work great.

If I print in low resolution the printout looks as I want it to
but the quality is obviously low.  If I raise the print resolution
the text become jagged.  Any idea why this is happening?  I am
using an Epson 850 and the print looks great if I print it on

It should not hapen , does the same thing hapen when you do the same test on
ordinary paper ?

Have you set the 'super'  setting in TurboPrint / graphics / smothing ?

When you say 'can't handle it' do you mean it smudges and bleeds ?

What resolutions are you printing onto the transfer paper & what type print
is it ?
( ie photo  -  just text - cartoon type ect )

I try to use the plain paper or inkjet paper setting for transfer paper.

I have only used a Cannon 610 for tee shirt prints , but I have a 
Epson 850 so I will try it out as soon as I can .

The Cannon has done some realy impesssive tee shirt pics , every thing from 

Lara Croft pics on light coloured denim jakets ( for my 2 girls not me ;-) 
) 
to logos for a Local radio station  - tee shirts , knickers , shorts .......

StarTrek logos , Music logos , 
and even some glamour pics of the wifey on tee shirts for me ;-)

Orders now being taken 

;-)

It does as long as I print in low density as described below.

When I print on normal paper it looks great at higher densities.

Yes, I have this set as default.

I am trying to print something that has text and graphics.  If I print
at 180x180 dpi everything looks as I would expect it to look, just
not as clear due to the low density setting.  If I raise the density
setting any higher the graphics still print ok but the text is wrong.
It looks as though the top half of the letters started printing in one
position while the bottom half was shifted over about 1/4 inch.

I tried transferring the low density one I printed out to an old shirt
and even it came out pretty good.  If I can get around the density
problem I'm sure it will look great.

Sure, if you say so. ;)

Turns out the problem appears to be in TurboPrint.  The printout is
a mixture of text and graphics.  When printing in the higher densities
the text is partly shifted.  That is to say, the top part of the first
letter is printed at a certain position while the bottom part of that
same letter is printed about 1/4 inch to the right.  I turned off the
mirror option and reversed the text in PageStream before printing.  
Turned out fine.  The only problem now is judging the contrast and
brightness levels.  Printing on plain paper gives a different look
than printing on the transfers.  And each time I change it, another
sheet of transfer is trashed.  Is there a better way?


> Lara Croft pics on light coloured denim jakets ( for my 2 girls not me ;-)

I have just tried printing out a 750 x1400 pic with text over,  mirrored , 
on my Epson 850 , through TurboPrint using a bitmaped font and a cc font .

It printed fine ( it was on plain paper , cos it shoul'nt make any diffrence

what you print on )

Which makes me think it is ( as you say ) a Turbo Print setting / fault  , 
or a clash between the prog printing from & TurboPrint 

Which prog are you printing from ?

If you want to send me the pic / text I will try it out on my system 
that might give us some clues .

Unless it is somthing /very/  (/Very/) complicated I assemble everthing in
Graphics 
Publisher and alter the contrast settings there . However the only prob I 
have had is not with the transfer sheet  but with the material that the
transfer
 is to be ironed on to .(the transfer sheets that I use are plain white and
so give 
the same look as ordinary paper ) 


I would print out on normal paper the various logos and the pin / stich them

on to the garment to check out the look position ( the record so far is 25
diffrent logos / pics on 1 top )

$A139 = hex A139 = 41273. Heh, that's beyond my budget too. =)

Subject: [just-amiga] NEVER register a .co.uk domain
X-UIDL: 86055939c695cd404c331369d55741fe

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hello interested readers!

I'd just like to warn everyone NEVER to register a .co.uk domain
because they give you so much trouble.

I suggest going for a US one like .com/.net/.org because these
are simple to move and trouble free.

I have been trying to get the DNS servers of aio.co.uk moved because
I have a new place to host the AIO website. It has been going on
for around 2 months and they still refuse to change the DNS servers.

The site is registered to someone else because he did this for me
because at the time he could host it but he emailed them and they told
him that he would need to fax them an 'official' company headed
paper requesting the change of the DNS servers. He did this and
still it has not moved.

For this I appologise for the sorry state the AIO site is in with some
times it being up and sometimes not and also for not letting me get
on with the site updating the bits that need updating on a regular
basis.

The last word of warning, *NEVER* register a .co.uk

Toodle Pip!

[pedantic mode on]

Technically, those aren't US domains at all.  A ".us" top-level
domain exists, but it's hardly ever used for some reason.  ".com",
".org" and ".net" are open to all countries, but they're
concentrated around the States.

I know this, maybe they want to seem better than us :)

Yes, yes of course but the country you register those domains
in is the USA so they are owned by a USA firm/government which
I would say makes them American :) maybe you think different.

How many of you read Brad Webb's e-mag "Amiga Update"?

See latest issue at:-

  http://www.globaldialog.com/~amigaupdate/brad/990910

In particular, scroll down (not very far) to:-

  Editor's Thoughts and Introduction:

Disturbing thoughts!!! - especially the bit:-

   "Gateway has dropped plans to build the new machine.
    Instead, it will focus on creating a user-friendly
    interface that will link Internet appliances over
    home networks."

If Gateway/Amiga have ditched plans for a new Amiga why are they getting
OS3.5 ready for the market? Surely I am not so cynical to think that it
is only to raise money from us Amiga suckers to help them with their
other plans and then ditch us after they have squeezed one last drop out
of us???

You have to remember that OS3.5 is not from Amiga, but H&P!!

Under Jim Collas, Amiga Inc and Amiga International were merged into Amiga.

I expect that to be reversed. OS3.5, AmiCola, boxer shorts, socks and Annex,
are all Amiga International things. I expect these to continue (Petro
doesn't give up easily).

Amiga NG things, such as the MCC and AmigaObjects are Amige Inc things.
I expect some of these to continue, but under Gateway rather than
Amiga.

It's a rather disgusting brown soft drink. Petro sells expensive cans of the
stuff at Amiga shows.

Please remember that since they won't be building hardware, they'll need
to do licensing. I think it's likely that other companies will look into
licensing the OE for desktop/tower computer systems. Iwin may be one of
those. Of course, I've also read that there is supposed to be an
announcement tomorrow, so...

X-UIDL: efb5446586467791a78612d508df1d0b

From: Kenneth Craig <kwdjc@wf.net>

Hello all,
    Thought you might be interested in this:


== THE PHOENIX PLATFORM CONSORTIUM ==

We are pleased to announce the acceptance of provisional charter for
the Phoenix Platform Consortium.

Phoenix signatories believe it is time to place our destiny back in
the hands of folks who understand what the Amiga is all about. You
will notice members of the original Jay Miner team within our ranks.

Unlike other new entities we will not field questions from newsgroups,
mailing lists, or in email, nor will we be erecting a marketing facade
to false hopes. Results and honest direction are our mandate.

The Phoenix Platform Consortium will assume responsibility for aid and
recommendation for reference platforms for the Amiga users who wish to
upgrade their present Amigas, as we establish an open migration path
to a new platform. That platform will in spirit and in feel be a new
Amiga experience while incorporating and surpassing the features found
on the desktop elsewhere today.

More information will be posted when we have facts to present. Please
do NOT email the participants in curiosity. We ask for your patience
in this matter. Please respect the wishes of the participants named
below. There is much to do and we have just begun.

As information becomes available it will be posted on mailing lists,
newsgroups, and at the following website: http://owlnet.net/phoenix/
which will be up shortly. This announcement is freely repostable.

I can't see that the .co.uk one are any more difficult to change that the
others. They both work in the same way.

Luckly I've not had any problems, the DNS servers were changed within a few
hours of emailing them.

Who is it that your domain is with? go on shame names. From what you've said
here they do seem to be dragging things out some what. Though I can
understand them being a bit careful if you are not the person to whom the
domain is registerd for obvious reasons.

Sorry I don't agree. they're a real bargain atm. 

If anyone's looking for a cheap UK webhost take a look at Free4all. You have
to buy your domain name with someone else and get it transfered but that's
about it. You also get 25mb of web space even if there website says 10mb. The
hosting costs nothing.

*Reply to quotes from the Executive Update (14/09/99)*

N.B. If you read the whole thing, and have followed Amiga for the last
few months, then you'd understand why I seem to over react a little 
here. I don't know what Schmidt had been smoking when he wrote it, but
he needs to come back down to Earth.

Rubbish. The Amiga is a computer, with a brilliant operating system,
easy to use, and easy to expand. Amiga is not a concept. I didn't buy my
Amiga for the community, I bought it for the computer.

Could we? What about Amiga Emulation on a Pentium 3? Get the best of
both worlds. Maybe the emulation isn't as fast as running Amiga software
on a real PPC Amiga. But how is the Amiga going to keep up, if Amiga is
not going to be developing hardware? Does this mean the MCC has been
dropped? Sounds like it to me.

> Amiga from ever seeing its full potential.

I don't understand what you're talking about. What are you saying that
Amiga is? It's a computer, it can come in many varietys. I just expected
that Amiga it's self would actually develop one, rather than leaving it
to third parties.

> So why not have Amiga running on every type of device imaginable, on 
> top of every other OS out there?

This insinuates that you are classifying Amiga as a piece of software.
If not an OS, then what?

> So long live Amiga, but if you think that Amiga was just a box, you've > missed the point.

Bo****ks! Many people are expecting, a brand new spanking Amiga. One
with all the current advantages, but with a decent hardware spec. Amiga
has turned it's back on us. What's going to happen to OS5 with it's
Linux kernal. Has everything we've been told about just been dropped?

> Thomas J. Schmidt
> President & C.E.O.

I guess G4/QNIX are our only hope now. But will any third party company
take the risk of developing an Amiga with the specs we were promised, at
such a low price? I don't think so. :(

P.S. Sorry to be so negative. It's just so frustrating to listen to so
many promises, start to believe them, and then realise they were all
lies. Please don't demean this list by flaming me publicly, if you 
disagree. I do however expect there'll be more response to this, in the
list.

Well everyone else has done it why not add another to the line. No
one really knows what is going on except whoever is at Gateway and
Amiga and i guess they don't know either ;)

It wouldn't make sence for Gateway to just use the name because it
would hold nothing for us Amiga users slapped on another box which
is just an internet-tv setup. I don't even think those Internet-TV
jobbies do very well as computer prices drop and everything that
is anything comes bundled with a modem there is no use for them.

If they want to make something else then they could use any name
because Amiga (the name) does not hold much respect these days
apart from us Amigans so it would not give anything a head start.

Why would they pay for the rights and just use a name, they can
make a new name which would be free and they wouldn't exactly
use the 'old' Amiga technology so basically they will have wasted
a few million dollers.

I for one am never going to use a PC because my Amiga does alot
of things I want it to do. Some people say they can't see themselves
using the Amiga in 5 - 10 years but we've been using basically
the same Amigas from 1994 so why not? I don't think I can see myself
using anything else. I'm not even sure i'd want to use a new Amiga
if it ever came out because it would be 'nothing' like our current
Amigas and maybe thats just our problem, we want something the
same but want it to change which is never going to happen. Its
stick with the Amiga or get a PC, I don't think i can ever see any
other way, its been like that for so long i'm used to it.

Tweedle Peep!

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga Format 128 issue & CD anyone?
X-UIDL: 59f05d90e486bf892102a4708211379f

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

All,

I have two copies of Amiga Format issue 128 the CD version. One copy
hasn't been touched and the CD is even still taped to the front of
the issue.

Its of no use to me the untouched copy so if anyone wants it then
you can have it for 1. It's better if your in the UK but I may
consider sending it if your outside the uk.

The 1 is to just cover the postage costs and I will return any
other money if it costs less (which it should).

So email me if your interested and i'll sort something out.

The mag is worth 6 so if you missed it its worth contacting me.
If your wondering why I have 2 copies and are doubtful then
if you want I can give you the reason for that.

Toodle Pip!

I'll agree with you here (atleast partialy). I bought AMIGA for it's
capabilities *and* for the concept *how* it does the things. Later I discovered
this community and everything combined is great :) I think OS, HW, the
concept how everything works and last but not least community *makes* AMIGA so
great.

As I understood it's true :( No AMIGA MCC :(

AmigaInc. president is laughing at as ? What the f*** does he means by that ? 'Long
live gATEWAYoBJECTS (aka amigaobjects)'. 'Long live software running on top
of sux'2000' Or ... Maybe I missed the point ?

Sounds like it was dropped :( Anyway heard those newamiga talks for some
time. Remember A/Box, PreBox (or smth), MMC and bla bla bla. Everytime they
say it's going to be a revolution. Everytime I *WAS* dissapointed. Now MCC is
gone and some thing Aminos showed up. In any way I'm going to wait for it :)
I'll be using my AMIGA. Maybe in a year or two I'll get a pC (but only if
I'll need it). Now I don't need it and mostly *I don't want it*.

Hello,

I've changed something somewhere and now my zip disks won't auto-
mount.  I have a mountlist in devs:.  I don't recall changing 
anything to do with this but I must have since it worked before.
Does anyone know what I need to do to get the drive to recognize
disk changes?  If I mount them manually (using SCSIMounter) they 
mount ok.

Jack

Your whole e-mail is very well stated. My sentiments exactly and
probably those of many more.

How many more coffin nails can Amiga withstand before the final one is
reach?

With comments like these coming from Thomas J. Schmidt how many more 3rd
party Amiga developers will be dropping out?

Maybe - but so very realistic. And so necessary to state these thoughts.

Quite so - how long now since Commodore dropped out? And so often our
hopes were raised over the years since then only to be dashed down
again. How much longer can ardent Amiga users maintain their ardour????

hello all "Amiga users"

this is my first message on just-amiga cos i'm the quiet type but i just had
to have a rant and the lads at work look at me like some sort of looney
when i ramble on about corporate betrayal, broken promises, that relay just
blew up, er no sorry they expect me to say that. anyway you get the picture
you probably get similar looks especially if youre a window dresser and you
say the relay one.  anyway here i go. 

*/rant begin/*

Amiga inc. have always had secret partners, can't say too much, loose lips
sink chips etc. now they say that they will not be producing hardware, but
will become a software company, working with "business partners". 

Who the hell are these "business partners"?. 
are they always the same business partners or are they new business partners
each time?. 
why wont they tell us who these people are? 

On the face of it, Amiga inc. seem to have a talent for choosing bum
companies for business partners and they must be aware of the ultimate
"bum"ness of these companies or they wouldn't be keeping them out of sight.
the only company they have announced a partnership with, QNX, was dropped
when it looked like being a possible success story. hopes dashed yet again,


look at the record of this company, 

leak story to amiga press that PPC will be the next amiga processor, allow
sufficient time for programmers and hardware manufacturers to get PPC
projects underway then, just at the right moment, announce to the world
that the new amiga processor is a secret but we'll give you a clue, its not
the PPC, go extremely quiet for a long time,(hinting about secret deals),
announce deal with QNX, subtly hint at PPC version of OS5 QNX style, wait
for PPC market to pick up again, announce end of deal with QNX and great
new deal with with that well known secret company, transmeta hinted at, the
boss quits(never a good sign),the newly ex boss offloads 100,000 shares in
company(thats probably a really bad sign), finally announce that the new
processor has finally been selected and it will be non-existent, this
seemingly magical device operates purely on a mental level its
specifications are quoted as the highest number you can think of +1. well,
we can dream can't we. 

apparently, for seven years now i have been operating under some delusion
that i was using a computer, silly me, it was a philosophy i was typing on,
no, it was more than that it was an ideal, a better way, ha, these people
are all leading us down the garden path right the way to the (bill) gates,
now they dont even conceal the fact, 

well, from now on i couldnt give a toss what they say, if they produce
something worthwhile i might just look it over, but it might just be
running on a fast pentium in which case we may as well all go out and buy
one tomorrow (Gateway do some nice ones, co-incidentally), maybe run an
amiga emulator or something, and if the emulator for the best computer that
NEVER existed comes along from amigasoft,(system requirements:- Windows 95,
USS Enterprise main computer) we can all get ourselves into an Amiga frenzy
and the boys at gateway can pat themselves on the back after the success of
their two year strategy

long live Amiga, thats what they say to us, but what did they license first?
the OS for amiga forever, the UAE package for PC use. think about it.
parent company- major PC manufacturer allows small offshoot company to
produce superior computer systems with the ultimate aim of destroying
parent company's market. sound feasible, nope , the new amiga system must
operate on parent company's machines or it will not be produced. the secret
partners would appear to be .....

it is now clear that we have been cut adrift in an open boat, so to speak, i
for one am glad that the waiting is over (dont believe them again) and the
money i have put aside for the new amiga can be put to good use upgrading
my miggy even further, the better way is already at my fingertips it may
not run at supersonic speeds compared to a PC but i reckon i can produce
quicker with an amiga cos its easier to use(thats my philosophy). and
there's one thing the PC will never have, AmiNet, 

remember the days when we didn't have this type of software or that picture
format didn't work, you cant run this bloated game on an amiga cos they
aint got hard drives, no sound cards outside of big box machines, endless
lists of limitations, look about you now there aint much we cant do with
the miggy, obviously 1.3 Amiga 500 systems are going to struggle a bit but
there is plenty of life left in the old A1200 yet just keep giving it the
silicon injections 8)

*/rant end/*

i leave you with a lighthearted biblical thought, draw your own parallels, 

the bible predicts that at the end of the world, the beast will rule the
earth, only 144,000 people will be saved and go on to live in paradise,
these 144,000 people will be the only ones not to bear the mark of the
beast, 

how many Amiga users did you say there were ? 

144,000 ?

Could God be an Amiga user 8)

144,001 ?


                                     Keep on "Amiga"ing
                                                        Stead




P.S. do you resent "That firm" christening us "Amigans" cos i bloody well
do. Personally i'm not ready to give up being an "Amiga User" just yet and
if i ever do decide to give up my miggy i may as well just go and commit
macintosh 8).

It is just an cmos invertor chip that turns the horizontal & vertical

available on the video port,  I dont know where you get one,
but any tv technicial could throw one together on a piece of
veroboard for you, in half an hour....

The Phoenix Platform Consortium has their attention, and according to
his latest statement, Amiga is interested in licensing to companies
interested in developing a next generation Amiga desktop/tower
system/OS. They are not interested in competing with hardware vendors
that they may wish to license to. I think they see it as kind of biting
the hand(s) that might be feeding them.

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga Format drops again!
X-UIDL: 81c4e400b3d8c7514276b6de69dd8f44

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Reader,

When Amiga Format published there last reader figures it had dropped
around 4000 readers which i mentioned in AIO and said something along
the lines that I will wait to see the next figure.

Issue 129 is now out (to subscribers) and the new figure is,

13,264 readers whereas the last was 14,644 so the readership has
lost over 1000 readers.

This is again bad but it is a smaller drop from last time which hopefully
means it will now level out and stay at a certain amount.

Toodle Pip!

There is at least that.
The question is, how much further does it need to drop b4 it goes the way of
CU, AUI and all the rest? I've been hoping that they only had to hold on
for MCC, then sales should start to rise again with all the new Amiga
users- but this isn't looking so certain.

Why is it that every piece of Amiga related news is bad?

Regards from a rather down

With the recent news ,I expect Amiga Format figures to go
below 10k next issue and to go belly up soon after.
Unless there is some very good news soon,I don't expect
anyone left by next year. :(

Emulation anyone ??? 
Since all the previous news was that we would run "classic"
software via emulation anyway,its not too big a step to move
to another platform .

   Why not just get another platform anyway? There's no rule to say you can't have an Amiga and, say, a PC is there? I've had a PC for ages and I couldn't be without it anymore (well, ironically I am; 'cos it broke and is being fixed, but anyway :) I still have my amiga because I like using it better then a PC. 

   If you want a better supported computer, get one.

See ya :)

Hi All!

More than likely, IWIN will be the final nail to be hammer into the coffin.
They sound to good to be true. Amiga(or is it Gateway?) & IWIN should get 
together and publish fairytales.

I am now at the stage of investigating the latest PC's and bought a PC mag to find 
out what is happening in their world. Imagine the shock I got when I discover a 
13Gb hard drive I bought recently was a 100 cheaper in that mag.

Pass me the valium!

Got to say with present situation I will not be renewing subscription to Amiga 
Format. So when it runs out early next year, that it!

I am also holding out from updating various bits of software.(Netconnect3, 
PFS3,(sorry Tim) etc.) Looks unlikely I ever will upgrade unless there is a dramatic 
turn around for the Amiga .

Intend buying a PC early next year. This will co-exist with along my miggy.
It will still be around my home for quite a while yet.

Seen the latest Amiga emulator on the PC and is looking good. According to my PC 
friends, updates for it are arriving weekly.

William Fleming

What is happening is the same as has been happening for years -
Microsoft continue to dominate the scene with their second-rate
software and unethical business practices.

When my Amiga gives up the ghost *pats keyboard, hopefully not soon*
I haven't a clue what I'll replace it with.  I don't want Microsoft
software or Intel hardware.  I don't want a Mac.  BeOS looks quite
interesting, actually.

I will give up computing rather than giving Microsoft a penny.

Well I will be for sure if no new Amiga is released. I will not be
using a PC because i have no use for it, I can give a 95%
promise that AIO will still be going in a year if a new Amiga
appears or not and I will still be a 100% Amiga user.

There is not alot more you will beable to do with a computer
so the Amiga does what I want, the only things i miss is some
internet applications like Java and official products, also
readvideo etc. The rest I can live with or without.

Whats the point? You can use your Amiga and a PC, the emulation
will never be the 'real' Amiga experience.

Subject: [just-amiga] UK Free ISP with a long distance dialup anybody? plz!
X-UIDL: 5f4910bd8e58898b30aa0b80a5417074

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi People in the UK,

Does anyone know of a free ISP that has a long distance dialup, ie
not local to 0151 or one of those 0845 or 0345 numbers. One that
works with the Amiga would be nice.

So if anyone knows of an ISP that is free (ie, no 10 per month) and
also has a number not in 0151 please let me know, i'd be so made
up :)

Thanks

Toodle Pip!

This is all so true!  I am so tired of hearing people say that because of
AmigaOS's age and lack of mainstream support that it is somehow less
functional than a PC.  Boulderdash!  I *need* my Amiga to do the things I
do.  No PC is as versitile, stable, and outright fast as an Amiga (yes, I
know that raytracing proves me wrong, but I don't raytrace.)  

I don't know if those who are about to buy a PC know what is going to
happen to them.  They will pay a good price to get quite a bit of power
and software, and it will be fast and stable at first.  That is, assuming
you don't put any more software on, but Amigans are hackers, so they will
install more software, and with each new program, the machine will
decrease in speed by 2-5% or so.  But it should level off somewhere around
45% od its original speed and stability.

Both mainstream Web browsers are quite unstable -- illegal memory
operations mostly.  Java is decent, but adds no functionality whatsoever,
and RealVideois unusable with a modem connection.  Also, it doesn't behave
too well if *any* other apps are running.  Also, emulating an Amiga is not
satisfactory at all:  It is incompatible with many legacy progs, it
crashes constantly, and it's incredibly slow!  It's still fun, but just
not like having an Amiga (I bought Amiga Forever 2.0)

The biggest problem with PCs is that nothing is free.  There is no Aminet
with giftware and freeware and cheap shareware.  Everything costs money.
Download.com is decent, but nothing--no-thing--is freeware.  Developers go
into the Amiga for the Love of the Machine and to make cool stuff happen.
Other developers go into the Windows market to make money.  Hence, stuff
is outrageously expensive.  Except for Web Browsers, of course, but they
come with more advertising that the Home Shopping Network.

The hardware, while newer and a little more stable, flatly sucks.  IDE is
pitiful next to the vanilla SCSI in a 3000, and try adding cards to a PC.
IRQs are such pains in the butt, I don't even want to start.  

The bottom line is that PCs look cute in the store, they even behave well
the first 3 days at home, but after that they turn to crap.  I know
many/most of you know this, but I just few that those folks who are
interested in switching to PCs need to hear this again.

The closest OS to AmigaOS in my opinion is Sun Solaris, but it's hard to
use.  Sun stations are awesome toys, and there is free Solaris for Intel
boxes.  The best hardware in the world right now is coming from Apple,
though, those G4 towers are super fast, super easy to upgrade and super
nice.  Both Suns and Apples are really pricey, though.  But you get what
you pay for.

The only way I would ever recommend a PC is if gaming is your number one
priority.  That's really what PCs are good at.  Otherwise, MS Word is
worse than Final Writer, IE/Netscape are slower and more crash-prone than
AWeb, and the networking sucks, and on and on.

If you still want a PC, then I recommend Dell.  Their hardware sucks the
least.  Avoid Compaqs and home-brews.  Also avoid Toshibas.  That's just
asking for it.

My experience is with a Dell Demension PC with 450Mhz, an HP Kayak at
300Mhz and several Toshiba laptops.  I have an A3000 with a CyberStorm
MkIII, which makes everything else feel like crap.

Just my opinion, flame at will.

Try UKOnLine, and dial up using the Easynet numbers.
UKonLine are free and are basically the same company as Easynet, so you can
use the Easynet news servers etc for free :-))

To find a real dial in number go to
http://www.easynet.co.uk/easynet/everywhere/search.html and put in a place
name that is as near/far to/from you as you need.

Cheers.

Err, you've taken that the wrong way my friend.

I mean computers in general will progress very little because the
next computer will have not so many new features no matter who
makes it, i am 100% Amiga so don't think I don't love the Amiga.

That depends on what you want to do, doesn't it? One thing
for example: I make my living by being a network administrator, mainly
with Windows NT being the server-OS. How do I add the client-based server
tools I need to the Amiga? That's right, I can't. Or how about this:
I need to be able to access MS-Access databases every now and then, also
a non-starter on the 'Miggy. Or how about saving MS-Word files (and don't
mention RTF-files since the RTF-filters in MS-Word and FinalWriter/Wordworth
aren't always compatible...)?

Don't get me wrong here, I really like the Amiga (I don't use the word
love for inanimate objects) but some things just cannot be done with it
as it is now (and vice verse).

Well, depends on how the PC is configured. Mine doesn't crash more
than my Amiga does. Win98 on the PC and AOS 3.1 on the other. Some
patches running on both too. And WindowsNT is even less crash-prone,
although it isn't fool-proof (no OS is).

The hardware is cheap compared to a Amiga-system. The software is
priced waaaay over the top.

A certain truth in it, due to the registry. It's not ALL that bad though,
some software doesn't expand the registry at all or just minor and thus
have a smaller impact.

Unfortunately true. Or fortunately perhaps...

Depends. Most Java-stuff is quite useluss but it can be put to good use.

Strange that I routinely have some 10 programs running. That's the
programs I constantly have a use for (that is, at work) and the computer
isn't crawling. At home I don't have the need to have as many programs
running at the same time.

It most certainly is not. It works but that's about it.

Not really. There are freeware and giftware software there too. Besides,
if you don't need the latest versions some PC-mags do the same thing
CU used to do: covermount older versions.

On the other hand, the SCSI in the 3000 is good for a plain SCSI-II
interface. Add a decent SCSI-card to the PC and there's a stalemate
on that point.

> and try adding cards to a PC.

Usually quite easy, although the Amiga is far superior on that
account. But the PC cards are generally speaking superior in the
price/perfomance ratio. I can get a TNT2 Ultra card for less money
than a PicassoIV and the latter is as slow as AGA in comparison.

Why switch? Use both computers, i.e. best of both worlds.

I haven't used Solaris much but how different to any other Unix-variety

Agreed completely! Also avoid IBM Aptivas, especially the earlier

I have experience with just about every laptop ever been released by IBM,
several compaq laptops and about 13-14 different models of stationery
machines from several brands (IBM, Compaq, Dell, Toshiba and Gateway).
Oh, and some really heavy duty server-only models too, including one
DEC-Alpha server.

Remember that they've been really pushing the subscriptions over the past few
weeks/months though. IIRC, the subscriptions are not included in this figure,
though you'd need to verify this with Future Publishing. So this figure may
account for a great deal of that drop. 

FWIW, I still buy AF and have been every issue since late 1990. But I can
understand that with more and more people going on-line that they don't feel
the need to buy it as the information is woefully out of date compared to
that on the net. That's not a critisisum of AF, it's the same with any mag
and deadlines that have to be met. There's also the percieved cost of the mag
for what it offers that other sources don't. Personally I'm in the lucky
position that 6 quid every four weeks is small change.  

Though as I've said the news is of no interest I still buy it for several
reasons. My top three below.
 

(1) Reviews
(2) Tutorials, I got a great deal out of the one that Neil Bothwick did on
HTML.
(3) Readers Stuff. A lot of which never appears anywhere else.

I understand what you mean and agree.  I just feel that folks have a
"grass-is-greener-over-there" attitude about computers and have been
convinced that they are missing some great magic by their PC friends.

> makes it, i am 100% Amiga so don't think I don't love the Amiga.

I believe you.  I didn't mean to imply that at all.  I just wanted to
state my opinion that the PC isn't what its cracked out to be.

Have you tried Samba?  That makes the Amiga both a client and a server on
the NT network?  It can't really handle PDC stuff yet, but my wife has my
Amiga's larger disk mounted as H: on her PeeCee.  There are two versions
of Amiga Samba:

http://www.kampsax.dtu.dk/~rask/Samba/
and
ftp.logicalline.de/pub 

I just downloaded the second one tonight and will try it out later.

Samba is definitely a cool Unix port to have.  As is Amiga QMail and Amiga
Apache.  No NetShow of course or NetMeeting, and that is important.

> I need to be able to access MS-Access databases every now and then, also

I haven't looked too far into the ODBC world on an Amiga.  I understand, I
run MySQL on my Sun Sparc Classic and I wish my Amiga could access that.
There is a MSQL port for the Amiga, and it may be helpful.  Still, this is
a point I will gladly concede.

Very true.  The only real way to use an Amiga for you would be to have
ShapeShifter insalled and run Office 98 for the Mac.  Having a built-in
Mac would give you access to mainly mainstream tools, but you would only
have to use it when necessary.

I understand the need to take files to and from work.  I operate with
ASCII myself or do my word processing on my PowerBook from work.  I still
stand by the fact that FinalWriter is a great litte word processor and
more than most people really need.

I really find that a little hard to believe.  My Amiga did have a crashing
problem until I replaced the 8520's and the Buster.  Then the 060 addition
sealed it.  It stays on 24/7 (runs www.chernoff.org) and crashes maybe
once a week on a bad piece of downloaded shareware (bad habit).

I read somewhere that Amigas run $5 software on $3,000 machines while PCs
run $3,000 software on $5 machines.  Kind of funny.

I have yet to see anyone who has no had stability problems with their PC.
I am not saying I don't believe you have it under control, but I have
never seen it with my own eyes.

It should *never* be that case IMHO.  What I detest most about the
Registry is that it is almost impossible to get an unwanted program's
dropping out of the registry once its in.  It's also next to impossible to
get all of the dll's out too.

And this is video?  I agree that the RealAudio runs very smooth, and it's
all I really want when working (broadcast.com is awesome), but video is
still on the way, I feel.

I will take your word on it.  I still believe that given a good Amiga with
the full OS, you can download most of the apps you need for free.  Not
all, but most.

It's seem an extraordinary number of people talk about the fateful day
when their Amigas go into the closet and the PC takes the desk.  People
seem tired of being in the weird crowd, especially since they aren't being
rewarded for it.  I agree with you, but I think many folks don't look at
it that way.

A lot.  It is very, very slick, and very fast.  My Sparc Classic has a
mere 32 megs of RAM and a 50Mhz CPU, but it runs everything I throw at it
beutifully.  Is it as fast as my Amiga?  Not even close!  But it is very
compatible, scalable, and professionally done.  Sun has made a fine
product in Solaris.

I use Linux at work for our file/web server, and it does the job, but it
really doesn't compare to our Ultra 5 which is 166 slower (500 versus
333).  Of course Suns are RISC and the Linux boxe is CISC, but Solaris has
a strong air of legitimacy that Linux still lacks.  Plus the Common
Desktop Environment is the best Unix windowing system yet.  It's smooth
and still fast.

> > Sun stations are awesome toys,
> Not very cheap though...

True.  Computers are a situation where you get what you pay for.  Cheap
equipment is available, but not very good.  Suns are over most people's
budget, including mine, but used Suns can be found for the same prices as
used Amigas, most are cheaper.  Sun themselves has a used equipment
program, but you'll have better luck on Usenet.

Now that's an interesting statement coming from an NT guy!  MacOS is the
most inefficient, non-multitasking OS I have seen, but its also the most
elegeant when it comes to the user interface.  Everything about using my
Mac is a true joy, and the last word I would say about it is "clumsy."  In
fact, I contend that Windows 95/98/NT attempts to be MacOS but fails
miserably.  It wants to make computers easy but really complicates matters
because Windows can't handle the behind-the-curtain stuff like MacOS.
With MacOS, you don't need to know anything about the guts, but with
Windows, you really do, because if the GUI technique goes wrong, then
fixing the problem will take an MCSE to begin to understand.

> > AWeb, and the networking sucks, and on and on.
> Which part of the networking?

The controls are missing.  I am using Miami Deluxe, and really, nothing
compares to it.  MiamiDx is the best networking package on any computer
anywhere, anytime.  It is the only GUI-driven package that puts more power
in the hands of the user than a command-line package.  Plus, it actually
fills my A2065, and I have never seen a PC fill an Ethernet card, 10 or
100 mbs.  Granted, most Amigas can't use 100 mbs cards, but I hope that
will change someday.

I am glad we agree and disagree on so much.  You sound like someone who
has learned to love NT somewhat, and I can respect that.  NT is far better
than Windows 9x, but it is a toy compared to Solaris or Linux.  A lot of
folks feel that NT is the thing to use because Unix boxes require more
time and effort, but the busiest, most stressed out folks I know are NT
admins.  My Unix machines can run years without being touched.

The Amiga lacks a lot of features, but so does every OS on the market.  I
feel that the Amiga doesn't lack the most important features, and so I
stick with it.  Perhaps if my machine is still at 50mhz when others run at
10Ghz, I will have to switch.  But truthfully, Windows boxes are as slow
as ever, and my Amiga gets faster with age (or maybe I am going crazy.)

Not on my Amiga, which unfortunately lacks a network-card but I've

I don't think it will work as long as no-one makes tools for altering
the user/mail/etc databases on the PDC/BDC. The UserManager For Domains
and ServerManager at the very least needs to exist.

Come to think of it, a workaround might be possible if I set up
a telnet-daemon on the NT-server and telnet in and use calcs to alter
user-rights. Everything can't be done that way though (:

I don't know how important the latter two are, actually. Never met anyone
that has used them. The Amiga-ports of QMail and Apache, while they are
good, I wouldn't trust the Amiga as a server on the Internet. It's too
vulnerable without protected memory and user-rights (MuFS isn't good
enough).

I'm by no means a SQL-expert but from what I've heard, the Amiga-port is
lacking things the other ports does have. Now, where is that Oracle8 port...

I did that for a while but decided it wasn't worth the effort. Especially
since there are 3 PC's standing next to me as well...

I cannot do that unfortunately. Too many damn macros in some of them (:

I agree. It's a great little program. Too bad it won't use TrueType fonts
though. Or can FW97 do that? I'm a little behind the times there and
have a later version.

Well, both of them crashes occassionally but not too often. Mainly when
I try out some new software that wasn't as well-behaved as it should be.

Too much when it comes to a machine that stands as a server. Then again,
that's
unavoidable with an unprotected OS.

Not too far from the truth either.

I didn't say I have never had it but it's been stability itself for the
last couple of months. It probably will develop a problem at some
time...most likely because some silly program insists on installing
a older version of some .DLL without asking me.

What, you don't like working with Regedit and regedit32?? ;-)

The worst problem with the registry IMO is that it makes the entire OS so
unstable. One entry in the registry gone wrong and you may have to reinstall
the OS. And for some things, you *need* to manually alter the
registry. There is no other way.  Some (read: a lot) of Microsofts
proposed solutions explicitly states that you need to alter the registry.
Which I really do not like to do. The /bin/etc solution in *IX is a
better approach. Or the ENVARC: way.

Not over the 'Net but I've had the MediaPlayer or WinAmp playing away
without
getting interrupted while having a bunch of other programs running. For
Video
over the 'Net, it's not really the PC's fault: it's the damn slow
connections
and congestions everywhere that makes it stutter. I don't know how well
or bad RealVideo is programmed so that's just a guess.

Very true. But I don't like that I have to buy a god-damn CD-ROM filesystem.
True, there is one in AOS 3.1 and some on Aminet but they're worthless in
comparison to AsimCDFS or CacheCFS (IMHO that is).

Well, I've seen it happen...and I guess most people here has too. It's gone
to the point where people actually asks me when I'm going to throw mine
into the bin. The day it dies of old age and I can't find replacements,
that's when.

Not surprising. A OS with real VMM, MP and Multiuser will be slower than
one which has not, and your Amiga had a better Mhz number too. True, Sparcs
are RISC so not directly comparable.

Compaqs Tru64 isn't bad either. Requires a Alpha-server though which aren't
cheap.

I don't know if this is true or not but from what I've head that is
because Solaris can handle a whole lot of more threads per process
than Linux. Linux is supposed to be around 20/process and Solaris
1024/process,
should make a difference to say the least.

I might try to find one...I'll also see if I can convicne my employer
that the old VAX-Mainframe in the basement would be better of at home...

Well, just a small list of things I find utterly annoying:

1. The lack of responsiveness.
2. When something crashes the computer can freeze completely
   with no option besides turning the power off.
3. The Data/resource gibberish filesystem which makes it a nightmare
   trying to open documents where the original creator isn't available.
   Usually involves using ResEdit.
4. No good scripting utility a la WSH or Arexx (AppleGuide or Hypercard
doesn't
   cut it).
5. No command prompt whatsoever.

I have used Macs extensively before and everytime a beginner asks how to
remove
a disk from the diskdrive..."Drag it into the trashbin". "No, I don't want
to erase
what's on it"...

True. It tries too and in some cases it succeeds perfectly, in other cases
well the less said than better.

Good thing I am one then.

>> Which part of the networking?

> The controls are missing.

True. On the other hand, if you use NetBEUI you don't need any...but you
don't want to use that. The thing that annoys me the most is that all
the network-parameters aren't in one place. No, no. You need to alter
things at several places.

Me neither, but sometimes you could be fooled into thinking it becuase
of the speed (or lack thereof).

Can any Amiga do it?

It's supposed to. I don't know how far RBM has progressed with it but they
claim a 100 mbs Ethernet-addon is in the works for their IOBlix.

I wouldn't go that far. It's got more than its share of silly bugs and
oversights but all in all, it's usable and most likely the best desktop OS
for networks there is. It's familiar for the users and therefor easier
for them, which cuts down on support issues but doesn't elliminate them.
As you say, Linux and Solaris are better OS but I think they're better of
being "just" the server-OS.

And don't get me started on Windows2000. Someone shoot the people
responsible
for that piece of crap, although some things in it are nice.

> NT is far better than Windows 9x, but it is a toy compared to Solaris or
Linux.

True.

Hey! Have you looked at my schedule lately?...Truth being told, the servers
aren't the problem. The workstations are since you never can trust the
users enough. And I have turned off many options so they cannot screw up
that
many things. Sad part is, it's impossible to prevent it all together since
if
you do you effectively cripple them so they cannot do their job. It's a
tough
balance act.

> The Amiga lacks a lot of features, but so does every OS on the market.

Yep. Most things I miss when infront of another OS is generally
speaking some of the Amigas applications, not some aspect of the
OS although that comes into play as well. I do find myself missing
my very customized workbench though...I simply cannot put my finger
on what it is that makes the Amiga so special that I don't want to
get rid of it.

My ancient Final Writer 4 Lite uses TrueTypes just fine :-)  I've
got freedom.library installed (a TrueType equivalent of bullet.library);
the <fontname>.otag file contains information on which library to
use to decode the font.  There's a similar library available for
Type 1 fonts too.

I tried changing each font size, saving it, quitting IBrowse and
then re-starting it.  The fonts used for the fastlinks and where
the url is put changed size but the rest didn't.  If I just start
IBrowse without having Miami running the IBrowse info file is
displayed.  It has the names of the developers on it.  These are
almost unreadable the way it is setup now because they are so
small.

Well thanks for the help but it didn't work like that. I signed up with
UKOnline and they gave me an 0845 number. I then went to the
Easynet site as you suggested and got a number for Slough which
is a long distance number for me.

I dialed in and it doesn't take the password, but using the UK Online
local number (0845) works fine and even the Easynet local number
doesn't work so you obviously can't use their numbers.

Easynet isn't free either so thats out the question. Does anyone
else know any free ISPs with a long distance dialup.

I found Virgin.net have one but for some reason it doesn't work with
Miami, their 0845 works fine but the long distance don't. I have a
friend with a PC, he has the same telephone company as me and the
long distance number works, bugger!

PLEASE! someone must know one!!!

Content-Type: text/plain
X-UIDL: 28b98570111e8085f0e12cf3e7e9bdf0

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi All,

Well by now most of you are probably bored by my rants at AF and
its staff but i'm going to rant anywa ;) Thats not to say that I don't
like AF because I have actually just taken out a 12 month subscription
with them, if they'll still be around in 12 months is another matter
altogether.

The first knowledge of Paul Cavanagh was when he called my up
saying he was reviewing Wasted Dreams for AF, as I am the UK
Distributer for the game I offered him the advice and then see
the review which gives the game 72% overall. Not wanting to sound
bias but even if I wasn't the UK Distributer I would certainly
give it a hell of a lot more than that as most of the people who
registered it did.

Before I'd actually seen the review a person from one of the
leading Amiga software suppliers, VERY well known who will
remain nameless also told me that they had their doubts about
Mr. Cavanagh but thats all I will say on that matter :-)

This month I see the Gremlin Collection receive 36%. Firstly
I do not condone piracy but some of these games on that CD
are not available anymore so how the heck does he expect
them to appear on the CD. Its alright people today saying
that you should buy the games but say when a company has
gone bust and the game doesn't exist anymore to buy, what
do you do? well people are left with one solution.

I notice he didn't complain about AF putting a full game of
Stunt Car Racer on the CD a few issues again and the reply
to a persons letter about it was that the Aminet also had
it, they call THAT and excuse?

I think Mr. Cavanagh was expecting a CD full of playstation
games because the games on the CD are some of the all time
greats, Gremlin was a market leader back then and probably
still would be on the Amiga. Zool was one of the a1200 launch
items and looking through the list of old scores from past
magazines that they display at the top most got over 80%.

Is Mr. Cavanagh up for the job? Why didn't AF employ an
Amiga fan and not someone who packed up their Amiga
well over 2 years ago?

Toodle Pip!

Thats because you are changing the fonts MUI uses for windows and gadgets.
To change the fonts for HTML displays you must open the 'General...'
settings window and choose the fonts tab from there. You'll see 3 sets of
fonts to change there, each corresponding to a different HTML style.

Hope this helps..

Hello Chris,

On 19-Sep-99, you wrote:

You did enter your username properly, didn't you?

For example, your email is chris.seward@ukonline.co.uk.

For UKOLs 0845 number, chris.seward would be OK, but for an easynet
number, you need all of it.

There is a London number at 0171 900 1111 and a Manchester one at 0161 930
8220. I'm using the 0161 number right now, so it does work.

Yours,
Andrew.

I quote below the final words from
Open Letter to the Amiga Community
September 17, 1999
From
Thomas J. Schmidt
President and CEO
Amiga, Inc.

> In summary, we are continuing to focus our
> resources on setting software standards for
> the coming generation of Internet appliances.
> We are not planning to offer hardware devices,
> but will work with hardware manufacturers who
> want to license our technology. As far as

To be honest, if I were a hardware developer, I don't think I would be
too enthused about developing the hardware when Amiga Inc. seem to be
only interested in "Internet Appliances"!

To my way of thinking, the only way a new Amiga computer would be able
to take off again would be for Amiga Inc. to produce the new Amiga
computer and back it up with solid advertising. Nothing will take off
without solid positive advertising from Amiga Inc. itself. Their current
comments only seem to reinforce our opinions that they are only
interested in the  "Internet Appliances" side of things.

Uh - Huh !!    I see your problem,   
you want the screen & window fonts changed, 
NOT the html display fonts.....    

Go into MUI & set the "Screen" font, then
set all 3 of the "Window"  fonts to whatever you want......

Hi Frank

In the most part I whole heartedly agree with you. The only
opening I see is the offer about Linux and the GUI they started.
My qualm is, how much have they really done on it? Or on the MMC
for that matter. If it was obvious they were not going to make
the deadline it sounds like there were more problems than they
let out. I just hope they have not soured the name Amiga to make
it unattractive is there is someone out there who is willing to
try and has the backing.

In a similar vein, what do you think about the G4 board with QNX?
Do you think the lack of software will hurt sales. I have not
heard anything about any software for it, yet.

That makes sense but I don't see a fonts tab in the General settings.
Can you tell me where it is located?  I am using 2.1 if that makes a
diference.

I don't think that is what I want.  When I tried that the font used
for the menus changed (actually looks better - thanks :)) but the
text in the window didn't change.

I would surely think that having someone interview Jim Collas and/or Bill
McEwen would be a grand idea. These two gentlemen certainly are not the types
to crawl into a hole at this time. Although NDAs might be somewhat
constricting, I suspect a word or two from them would help in clarifying the
situation....... Well, perhaps. 
There are goings on that we would like to know about.

Ah, the same version I'm using (sort of).

Hm, I'm using the competitor: ttf.library. It works fine albeit a bit
slow. Still, better than nothing. If I remember correctly, there
was some fine-tuning to get FW to accept them at first though.

Strange, it works for me. Maybe they closed the loop-hole after I joined UKOL,
but couldn't be bothered to seperate out all those that had previously signed
up...?

I think I read somewhere that, with IBrowse2 you can't actually change
the font size yet. You'll have to wait for an update. It seems a strange
thing not to be able to do. Actually, I think I read it in last months
AF when they were comparing it to Voyager 3

RTFM. Check the "General" settings I believe. There you can set the
font names and sizes for each of the HTML header size tags. (eg.
<Hx>)

I know they were in a hurry to get it out so I guess that part was 
not that important to them.  For me, at least, it just about makes
it unusable.  Oh well, thanks for the help.

Greetings all...

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but here goes...

Can someone advise me (in plain English please) what purpose do AmiTCP and
AmiFTP and similar programs serve?

I often see them mentioned in MLists and a friend has all sorts of assigns
and extra lines in his user-startup/startup-sequence to run these programs
and complained about the problems he had setting them up.

When  I  asked the above question he couldn't give me an answer, just that
he'd been advised to have these running before he went online on the 'net.

I run Miami, YAM and iBrowse and get mail of all kinds from all around the
world. With iBrowse I go to http and ftp sites and never have any problems
connecting  and  D/Loading  HTML files, LhA, LZX or DMS archives, nor do I
have any problems attaching files to my emails.

So... any easily understood answer would be appreciated.

I am having an on-going debate re: attaching files to emails. 

Except  for  one  person,  in  all  the dozens of mails I've received with
attachments  the attachment has been of base64 type and the YAM manual and
other  texts  I've  read lead me to believe this is the norm these days as
the  encoding is smaller, (ergo, faster in transmission) and more reliable
than uuencoding. The way I have my system set up (button in DOpus) it also
seems easier to decode base64 files.

Again, an easily understood answer on this subject would be of help.

Thanx to all in advance.

Anything Miggy related...

Well, AmiTCP does the same a Miami; it dials up your ISP, and
sets up a TCP/IP connection to allow you to communicate.
AmiFTP allows you to download files from Aminet etc., and allows
you to upload too- its bloody good at it too.

>I often see them mentioned in MLists and a friend has all >sorts

>and extra lines in his user-startup/startup-sequence to >run

Wouldn`t know about that.

>When  I  asked the above question he couldn't give me an >answer,
just that
>he'd been advised to have these running before he went >online
on the 'net.

Unless you have another magical way, it *would* be useful.
(You could always use Miami though, which you do)

>I run Miami, YAM and iBrowse and get mail of all kinds >from

Good for you- you won't be able to upload much, though.

No problem.

From: Jack York <jyork@voyager.net>

Hello,
 
Does anyone know anything about the USB to SCSI adapters?  I have
seen them online and from the desciptions it sounds like they are
for hooking up SCSI devices to a USB port.  I am wondering if
they would work the other way around.

Hi...

I did this, got a fan that I now use, it's square, about 5 cm wide... I have
drilled a square hole in the bottom of my 1200, right under the processor
and put it there...

My problem is, is it dangerous that the metal thingie that gets cold touches
the memory chips??? It presses abit on them...!!!

It only touches the top of the chips, not the legs!!!!

My Amiga is BTW piled up by two Kalle Anka (Donald Duck) pockets ;) (150
pages thick)

Hmmm, it's true that the Amiga is something that is VERY personal ;)

   If in doubt, put some tape over that area. That'll prevent any shorting out.

Content-Type: text/plain

From: Jack York <jyork@voyager.net>

Hello,

I am trying to install a Toshiba 6201 (ext SCSI) CR-Rom drive.
The first drive they sent me would not show up on the bus but
the tray wouldn't open either so they sent me another.  The 
tray works on this one but it is still not seen on the bus.  My 
question is: if I just hook the drive up to the bus, terminate
it and set the proper SCSI id and then run SCSIMounter, should
I be able to at least see the drives ID there?  I am not seeing
anything at that address and the seller is telling me I have
it set up wrong.  If I plug a known good CD-RW drive in its place,
it works.  Shouldn't I just be able to plug it in and at least
see it on the bus?

Jack

For my part - the name would not matter.

If a new computer came out with Amiga technolgy inside it but a
different name that would do me!!

Maybe a completely new name would be a good idea to prevent the
misconceptions in the non-Amiga community from souring the new product.

I definitely and wholeheartedly agree 100% with that. The best
thing is that it is entirely possible to do, but does any
developer think it is worth the expenditure. We can only hope
there is at least one out there.

Unitech Electronics in Sydney, make all that sort of thing, and
would gladly post parts anywhere, I'm sure.
Their email address is unitech@ideal.net.au,
with a website at http://www.ideal.net.au/~unitech/

Don't tell me you have to come to Australia to get Amiga parts - 
that's a turn around!! :-)

L Bolch:-

No question that was the attitude in the late 80's. The interesting thing
is that games are largely driving computer evolution now. With the
perspective of a decade, people are realizing that much of what is new and
slick on the PC and Mac was being done with our "game machine" in 1985. 

The insult of 1989 has become the supreme compliment of 1999. I would love
to be conceited enough to think that nVidia, Matrox, ATI, 3Dlabs and all
are developing boards for my 3-D excesses, but those billions are being
spent to corral the games players first. We enjoy the fall-out.

The budget for a game rivals that of movies as does the profit. Look at
all the press coverage surrounding Sega and Sony's new consols. Games are
big business now and getting a LOT of respect.


We tend to think that the on-line community is the whole Amiga community.
We are just the loud ones who get noticed, and may well be just the small
but visible tip of a rather large iceberg.

I am constantly running into people involved with other systems who have
nothing but respect and admiration for what Amiga pioneered. A honcho from
Tandem told me that throughout his company, Amigas were pervasive - the
engineers regarded them as micro-mainframes, using them much as you do, as
a programming sketch-pad at home. 

A lot of people programming in the Windows market, started with Amigas and
still have them at home. Had lunch with one last Saturday. The company he
works for is releasing a pretty major application this week and he was the
architect. He is still an enthusiastic member of AmiCUE.

Many of the AmiTrix group work for other system companies as their day
jobs, but still develop and distribute Amiga products. They just completed
the legal paper work for the browser in OS3.5, and it should now be in
Haage & Partner's hands. As of last Thursday, Dale and Yvon had pretty
much wrapped up the coding.

Amigas have been and ARE STILL BEING USED throughout the whole television
and video industry - at least in North America. Probably 99% of the
professionals working in the CG/FX production houses began their careers
or caught the love of CG/FX on Amigas and speak with great nostalgia about
them. NewTekniques Magazine is still loaded with Amiga features, news and
ads. Many who work with SGI and NT machines still have their Miggies at
home. 

A whole 'nuther community - perhaps larger even than this on-line bunch. A
big difference is that they don't - and never did - regard the Amiga in
the way that the religious cast does. It was a special tool that empowered
them to realize their vision with as little computer clutter as possible
getting in the way. They are not inclined toward the emotionalism we see
here, but would be delighted to move back to contemporary Amiga systems.
Easy network rendering on scalable MP machines plus LightWave and CG/FX
would be back. NewTek for example, is saturated with Amigans and as they
have expressed many times on the LightWave mailing list, they would love
to have new Amiga systems to develop for.

There is probably another community - equally silent - built around
scientific visualization. Paula would probably know. In any case we are
not alone.

Nothing whatever. However, the computer industry has spawned firms of
highly professional information disseminators who can get the message to
those who can do the client the most good. A whole lot different than
sending off press releases - as has been the style of the Amiga stragglers
if any effort at all is made. These people personally know writers and
editors and work with them to get accurate stories in the general
computing press through actual personal contact. A major story in "Wired"
would be the equivalent of years of full page ads in the Amiga magazines
that remain. Some may sneer at the pretensions of "Wired", but it is
avidly read by a lot of well-heeled consumers who have the pocket change
to buy expensive new technology on a whim.

A new name is likely to be viewed as another Be. A system that started
development in the early '90s - a system that never gets to market. Yes,
there are people using Be, but they tend to be programmers developing
programs to show each other. Another "private label" system is not what we
need.

Having the name "Amiga" is no guarantee of success - nothing is a
guarantee of success except immense amounts of cash and marketing, and a
sterling product with game and application software better than WIntels
and Macs. Otherwise it will simply be a private label that does a
production run for us and then vanishes. If someone can come up with a
killer app, there is always a chance that it will dominate a niche and
survive - even if it does not become a contender in the Mac/PC
marketplace. Another e-mail app won't be it.

The name however, will alert folks from the Mac and PC communities that
the Amiga is back in contemporary garb. They are not so insular as you
might think. We have had many visitors from the Mac user group at AmiCUE
over the years. Of course, these are mature enthusiasts - not the bulk of
users for whom it is only a working tool.

As an aside, one visit took place by a cross section of the Mac user group
exec, to try and find out what we were doing right. At that meeting, we
had around 50 people show up - counting guests. The Mac guys were boggled
- they had over 400 members and were lucky to get 10% at any meeting. We
had about 40 members at the time - something like a 125% turnout!

larry!

        I know several that started on Amiga and went to CGI foundries, peesea
developer houses, or became mainframe programmers/controlers/adins.  Most still
have their Amiga h'ware and, I think, most would be interested in a new Amiga
with current or better features/capabilities.

        I agree with several on the TA list,  if the name can be had for
reasonable, or maybe even slightly less than reasonable, cost then I think it
would be worth it.  The highly recognizable name and badges (boing ball and/or
rainbow checkmark) would be more than worth the equivalent mucho expensive ad
work needed to push a new name.  Fleecy and Bill McEwen (Amino) are talking to
AI to see if something can be worked out.  The Phoenix group seems to be behind
them 100%.

        Meanwhile, back at the ranch...  Dirk Harlar(sp?) of the Ripper list
has stumbled across indications of a new Amiga box coming out soon.  He says
they are rolling off the assembly lines even as you read this.  Dirk is excited
as he has met with parties involved when He demoed 3.5 in Holland and saw the
signed contract.  There are low and high end boxes (ruffly equivilent to the 500
and A3/4K only with updated capabilities I assume) that should be available for
purchase in 1 or 2 months.  He has been sworn to secrecy so will not divulge
more.  Makes me want to track him down and try a lit'l bamboo-under-fingernails
therapy on him.  ;^)  I'm anxious to know the specs on these new boxes.

Subject: [just-amiga] Gateway are b*stards!
Content-Type: text/plain
X-UIDL: 87de9eff341cf251e8dcc53142f30f19

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Dear all,

I have just read the news on a mainstream computer news page on
teletext on the british channel four, 21/9/99 on page 651. I am sure
you'll all know the news now and that is that Amiga will not be making
another computer but instead focus on internet applications, again,
us the community has been screwed over when everything was
going good for the first time. Groups like Digital Corruption
complained about Amiga long ago although they went about it in the
wrong way they came up with the truth long before most people could
see it.

I think we have all been wary at times but sometimes have been blind
to the facts and been living a pipe dream. Another company has
screwed us but I hope we can survive, why should now be the end?
there is nothing to pull me to the PC or Mac market so the Amiga is
still my number 1 choice and I hope you and all developers will stay
with our platform and support it, it is us who can save what we have
and no one else now. We have survived since 1993/4 until now so why
can't we carry on, I didn't see us still being here 4-5 years later
but we still are, we may have lost a few people along the way but
if in your heart of hearts you claim to be an Amiga user then stay
with us, the elite Amiga users and show the world we care about
OUR computer because now it belongs to US.

I urge Gateway to sell the rights to Amiga the company to someone
who cares and see if anyone will bid for it, they owe us this at
least, if they are going to do nothing with it then give someone
else a chance, even if no big players buy our computer name then
sell it to a smaller company and give us back the name, we don't
want to see the word Amiga on an internet box, if we'd have wanted
that we would have supported Escom.

Some may call this the 3rd time we've been done over or some might
say the second but the basic fact is its happend again and its
something we have come through before so I see no reason why
we can't do it again. The Amiga is our choice, if it wasn't the
choice of many then we wouldn't be here now, we would have
parted 3 or 4 years ago but we are the REAL users who know
our computer and like what it does and what it stands for, lets
show the computing world that we are not ready to die even if
for the future ahead we can yet see no new computer.

My pledge is to make Gateway sell the rights to Amiga to a
company of our choice that we support and we back.

I don't think we should blame Jim Collas or any Amiga worker
because I don't think this is what THEY wanted, of course not,
I blame Gateway. Tom Schmidt has been quoted as saying that
it was unrealistic, of course it isn't, the Mac is hanging around,
people are bored with the PC so it is not unrealistic at all.

They have said that they _might_ consider a licence for someone
else to work on a new computer but all this really says to me
is they believe in the back of their minds that it could take off
but they are too gutless to put a bit of effort in and give it
a go, with a licence if it doesn't take off then they are safe and
if it does they rake in the money.

I think we should all email Gateway and tell them what we really
think of them and tell them to sell the rights.

I would like to say however that I am willing to show my support
by making the commitment now that for as long as people want
AIO to keep running it will, as long as there is a small readership
then it will continue.

I would also like to say to everyone reading that I hope you
too stick with the Amiga, if you want buy a PC along side then
do that but stay with the Amiga, I for one am 100% an Amiga user
and for as long as I can see will always be. The Amiga has been
a part of my life for as long as I can remember and its not
about to die yet. Stay with us, don't let *our* computer fade away.

Toodle Pip!

Dear All,

Your probably wondering what the hell that topic means right? Well let
me tell you, me and a few of the Amiga press have been contacted
by the one and only Bill McEwen. I mean he has something up his
sleeves and its big, hence the big sleeves joke.

I can't say much as the topic was "CONFIDENTIAL" but I will quote
a small piece which has nothing to do with the rest of his exciting
email,

"I did not leave Amiga, Gateway told me to leave."

The word from the mouth himself.

Subject: [just-amiga] Tony Horgan talking out of his organ?
Content-Type: text/plain
X-UIDL: 2bf5324419fdb21eac16e903ef7ea9e3

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>


In the latest colum in AF 129 I see Tony Horgan has split us users in
two reasons for using the computer we do, below are how he sees
each reason for using it,

- "They favour a particular application that's not available for
any other platform"

or

- "they like being part of a club"

This really is the biggest load of bulls**t i've ever heard. I do not
use my Amiga because I like one application or even 2,3 or 4 that
I could not get on a PC and then the other suggestion is just plain
taking the p**s out of us.

Neither of these reasons sum up why I personally use the Amiga.
I admit the Amiga is not as powerful as the PC but if you want a
power machine get a PC, no one is stopping you, we are here for
a reason that people can not explain and not put into words, i'm
just using my Amiga because I can. You see in the modern world,
in most countries we have a choice on what we do, what we say
and what damn computer we use. I choice Amiga because its plain
and simple I can.

I am not living in a cloud thinking that my machine is more powerful
than the latest wizz-bang PC, I agree with Tony Horgan whoever
does is mad but the reasons he says we use are Amigas are
awful.

The Amiga does 95% of what I want and the other 5% I can live with
out. Have people changed into a mode of lets slag the Amiga off
as much as possible to show we are 'funny guys' and can slag
off the computer we use? The Amiga is not like a vintage car,
we do not get pleasure from polishing it on a sunday and
occationally taking it out for a spin as heads turn. Yes, heads
probably do turn when I mention to another computer user that
I use an Amiga but it isn't a toy computer, its a serious computer.

If people used the Amiga for being part of a club then they are
not a computer user at all. I think there are a million and one
reasons we all use our Amigas, does it really matter why we
use them, the fact is we use them, the end to that story. Saying
the main two reasons are the ones he states is very narrow
minded.

Now Tony Horgan to many is seen as a good guy and i'm not
complaing about him at all, I like his work and he was one of the
best Amiga writers to past through Cu-Amiga but these few
comments are badly wrong.

So Tony Horgan, what do you like about our club or are you
here for that one application you can't find anywhere else.

Me, i'm here for the one application....

the application being....

AMIGA

Better idea is one I've had for a few years...
Key Word: Consortium

Sell the rights to a collective of Amiga Software and Hardware developers-
people who have PROVEN themselves and might have the combined financial
resources to pull this off.  All in the consortium would shatre both
resources, talent, and (in the end) profits, each according to their best
specialties.
  Amongst the obvious advanbtages, is that the Amiga would be protected from
the political rampages of a single company... if one outfit is tired of the
Amiga then he can pull out and still leave the others to continue it.  If
at some later date someone else wants to get in on it, he can by in and
start putting his programers/researchers/techies where his mouth is.

Have a central board- 1 rep from each company in it, but making sure that at
least half of the ones on the board are actual Engineers and one or two
knowing somethiung about marketing and the real world- to control the
allocation of resources, and then have at it.

Just think, say if Haag, Phase 5, Kruse, certain famous individuals in the
Amiga community, and maybe even Motorolla could get together (tell
motorolla they get a percentage and the freedom to get a say in how They
might want to see a real computer made- that would also elliminate the cost
for the Consortium actually #buying# the needed CPUs), what a monster
machine could be made (without the interference of politics).  Then give it
some native task emulation for PC and Mac stuff, and start advertising the
ultimate desktop supercomputer (Hey- if Apple can call their G4 a
Supercomputer with just the one chip, what do you think we could call ours
with /FOUR/ G4 chips in parallel).

It's the way it should have been done 2 or 3 companies ago.

Seriously hope something is afoot. Let's face it, there was a certain amount of
passion in the ways Collas and McEwen parted with Gateway/Amiga. Surely,
surely they have not been idle in the interim. Anyone heard from Collas? He
certainly has some capital - and vision. Really would be interesting (and most
likely very motivational/inspirational) to hear something of his plans.
Anyone else curious?

Regards

        Since you are ed for AIO, I've got to believe that you know 'bout PPC
(Phoenix Platform Consortium), Amino, Aqua, and AMIE.  Surely you realize that
"screaming" at Gateway/AI could cause any negotiations that Fleecy Moss, Bill
McEwen, or anyone else involved, all sots of problems.  They are talking to AI
in an attempt get the Amiga name, possibly the badges (boing ball, rainbow check
mark) and whatever else they think necessary or required.  There are large group
of ppl that you could get pissed at you if you screw up their plans.

        There is a slight possibility that such action as throwing flames at
Gateway would be useful.  They have to be smarting from the reaction of all that
flamed them for their change in plans.  It is concievable that more of the same
could push their guilt button hard enuff to cause them to stike a deal more in
our favor.  I think it would be a good idea to clear this, and coordinate your
actions, with Fleecy and Bill.

        Other than that I applaud and agree with your position and "tude". 
With the BoXeR near completion and, according to Dirk Harlaar, new Amiga clones,
both low end desk top and high end workstation,  rolling off the assembly lines
now, it's obvious that ppl aren't ready to let the Amiga die.  Let's all pull in
the same direction and prove to G2K/AI how wrong they were.  With names like
Dave Haynie, Fleecy Moos, Bill McEwen, Carl Sassenrath, Wolf Dietrich, Dan
Dodge, and many others from the Amiga h'ware and s'ware developers industry
(with more joining every minute), things are looking up.  As one old movie line
goes, "We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any more".  Or as
Popeye says, "I c'n stands no more!".

        Let's do it ppl.  Let's show the corporations we will not be dictated
to.

Lets get real here....Gateway pulled the plug on the MMC regardless of
current users wishes!!
Sending them e-mail isn't going to upset them in the slightest,or they 
would have changed their minds.
The user base is now so small that they don't care what we think and
have shown their indifference by their actions!!!
Gateway will,as usual,look at the bottom line in relation to any
dealings with other parties ie if they stand to make money from it
without any effort on their part,it'll go ahead.
Flame them!!! Why not nuke them :))

According to AF, he wasn't making money, so was chucked. I wouldn't be
surprised if this was the case, but at the same time, I wouldn't be shocked
if AF were wrong.
The real concern was Jim leaving; someone must have heard something from
him?

        Sandy Brownlee.

Errr, his message was posted to 'us' after you posted your Pheonix
post, so no :)

But I do notice he comes under the company 'Amino' in that release.

You'll just have to wait and see.

Its not a case of knowing something you don't. Its not my fault that I
can't release what he has said, he hasn't said that much but all I
want to do is tell you something has been said not showing off that
I know more.

Dear All,

I wrote to Petro after 'the' announcement to ask some things and thought
you may want to read his reply. These are the words of Petro
Tyschtschenko.

---

Dear Chris, do not worry...Thanks for your mail......Unfortuneately I
have 
had no influence to the
 development in the last weeks.My understanding is that it is AMIGA Incs
 dream to build a ubiquitous platform that can succeed in the environment
of
 the future, not an unsuccessful computer that is rooted in the past. The
 dream of ubiquitous computing and a common amiga interface across
multiple
 devices (PC`s, Mac`s, phones, TV`s, PDA`s, cars, Internet, etc) is the
 direction of AMIGA Inc. GW wants AMIGA to be pervasive and in use by
 millions. Maybe an exciting adventure into the future. I am quite sure
that
 there are also someone enterprising people which are willing to continue
 with the existing AMIGA technology...and I will support those of course.
 I will continue to support my A 1200 sales with spareparts and service
as
 long as it is requested from our Amiga community and for the benifit of
my
 beloved AMIGA. Our Os 3.5 will be available in the next 2-3 weeks.
 
 Best regards
 Petro

I know very little apart from what Bill McEwen has posted. I doubt
Gateway
are going to say that editor of AIO bloke said some stuff about us now we
are going to stop everything.

They stopped the Amiga MMC easily enough, don't forget they are a big
company who cares about nothing much as long as they make profit, they
don't care what any of us say otherwise the Amiga MCC would still be on.

I doubt it seriously. If I wanted my views noticed I would have sent it
further than just this mailing list.

I speak my mind, sometimes people don't like that but i'm not one for
hiding the truth or my ideas.

Tweedle Dee!
