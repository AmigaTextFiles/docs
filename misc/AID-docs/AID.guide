     This guide, the AID archive and related files are considered
@{b}PUBLIC  DOMAIN,@{ub}  and  they can freely spread without any
fee.

     No  modification  of the files should occur, and any request
or additional info should be posted to the maintainers of AID, in
the ways suggested in this guide (see posting rules section).

     AID  files can be freely spread and uploaded into electronic
BBS  systems  or  Internet  sites, but please DO NOT upload these
files  where  they  already exist, especially on Aminet sites and
newsgroups   used   for   AID   distribution.   For  any  updated
information  about AID distribution just feel free to contact me,
or any other AID maintainer.

     AID  stands  for  Amiga  Ideas  Database,  it is supposed to
become  a  wordwide  meeting  point for good programmers and good
ideas.

     Fortunately  the  Amiga  community has always been different
from  others  systems  users  groups,  as  we share an unbeatable
passion  and  affection  for  our  beloved machine, followed by a
great  force in developing PD and Shareware software as well with
strong  efforts  to  collect  and  distribute  it  worldwide (I'm
thinking of Aminet and other sources).  All this didn't stop even
during  the  big Commodore's crisis, as to demonstrate the unique
power of Amiga users.

     AID  is  a  link  between Amiga Users, ideas and programming
skill.   I  know the last two things don't always go together, so
there  could  be  someone who need a particular program or script
but  doesn't  know  how  to  do it (or where to get it) or a good
programmer losing time searching for some good idea to develope.

     AID  is  a  database  where  you  can find IDEAS coming from
people  who  need  it,  and,  possibly, coming from other people,
about similar programs already existing, or programs just written
for the occasion by someone.  So why don't we simply create a new
newsgroup dedicated only to Amiga-Ideas?  Well, I know newsgroups
are  a  great  place  to  look  for  help,  but I found them very
dispersing,  they  also  need to be browsed periodically, and old
messages may be discarded.

     Items  are  sorted  by  difficulty,  by  type  (conventional
program,  Arexx  script,  Scala (tm) script, AmigaDOS script...),
and  should  contain  as much information as possible to describe
what   the  user  need.   Replies  containing  suggestions  about
software have to be posted to the user who posted the request AND
to the database itself.

     Items lasting on the database for more than a specified time
(let's  say  about  two  months), will be moved into a not-recent
database,  as  to  maintain  the  main  file  more comfortable to
handle.   Programs  and  script  realized specifically due to AID
requests will be listed into another file.

     The  AID  archive  could  be  maintained in several formats,
allowing the wider distribution possible.  The first phase of the
distribution  will  be  just via "rich-ascii" file, following AID
@{" Standard " link standard}.

     Amiga Ideas Database is composed by documentation files and
database files, mostly released in LHA format, conventional names
identify the content of each file.

     - AID-faq      : The Frequently Asked Questions text
     - AID-docs     : The full AID documentation (This file)
                      (Amigaguide and txt format)
     - AID-n        : The main AID requests archive, where "n"
                      is the release number
     - AID-goals    : Archive containing software developed due to
                      specific AID requests
     - AID-store    : Comprehensive archive of all "old" AID requests 
                      since the first release

     - AID-ware     : Will include any special software released 
                      for use with AID archives, such as
                      browsers, search tools and similar.


     AID   requests   archive   will   be  updated  and  released
frequently,  older  requests will be moved to the store database,
making the main database easier to handle. Requests archives are
released in Amigaguide and plain ascii format. Further releases
will include special formats for use with browsers and search
tools, see AID @{" future " link future} page.

     There  are  three main types of messages you can post to AID
maintainers:

-  @{b}Software  Request@{ub}:   idea  suggesting  a  software  that it is
supposed   NOT   EXISTING  in  the  Amiga  PD/Shareware  or  even
commercial software pool.  Types of software include:
 
  ·conventional programs (executable)
  ·AmigaDOS/Arexx/Scala(tm) scripts
  ·Libraries and devices
  ·Any language source code
  ·etc

-  @{b}Answer  to  request@{ub}:   If  you developed or plan to develope a
software  following  an  AID request, you should let us know, and
your name will be included in the database

-  @{b}Software  information@{ub}:  If an AID request refers to an already
EXISTING  program  you should let us know, specifying the program
name and possible Internet download site(s).

@{b}POSTING REQUESTS@{ub}

     To send a request, first of all THINK TWICE on it :) then
just fill in the forms you can find @{" here " link forms} and
send them via email or snail mail. Any other kind of request will
take much more time to be processed.

     If you are sending info related to an existing AID request,
you should send the same message to the sender of the original
request too, especially if you're announcing the development of a
new software. 

     Here's a @{" quick reminder " link reminder} for you, read it before posting. 


@{b}FEEDBACK FROM AID@{ub}

     As soon as your request has been processed you will receive
an acknowledge message (email only!), even if your request cannot
be included into the database.


@{b}REJECTED REQUESTS@{ub}

     Requests may be rejected if:

- There   is  existing  PD/Shareware  software  with  the  SAME
  specifications of the request

- The request is too general and cannot help developing 
  new software

- The request is not clearly explained

- Any other reason making it difficult to understand

· Usenet (not always): comp.sys.amiga.misc
                       comp.sys.amiga.programmer

· Directly by emailing me (lcs@zen.it)

· A mailing list is supposed to start soon, it will depend on
  feedback


@{b}DATA FORMATS@{ub}

     AID main archives are updated by maintainers in a "rich-ascii"
file following AID standard. Released files are generated from
the rich-ascii and converted into many formats.

     Formats currently available are:

     · Standard plain ascii
     · Amigaguide doc


     New formats will be available soon (see the @{" future " link future}),
allowing users to search the archive for specific topics and
perform automatic operations such as auto-downloading most recent
databases directly from the Net. We plan to release a specific
AID browser soon, any news will be reported in the @{" Web homepage " link web}.

     First of all, @{b}AID future will depend on feedback@{ub}
and suggestions from users, so feel free to contact us. 

     We will release new formats for databases as soon as
possible, and we plan to have soon a specific AID-browser, which
will be able to perform several actions:

     · Search thru the database
     · Automatically download new databases from the net
     · Assist filling in forms for posting requests
     · Converting the rich ascii format into various standards
     · Automatically download (thru ftp) software announced
       in AID database (if URL is included)

     · .. and many many more

    
     If you are interested in writing an AID browser please let
us know!

     Thanks to International Amiga Society we have the
possibility to build up a mailing list for AID databases, email
us if you need it and we'll try to set it up soon.

     Any other good suggestion and idea will be included into AID
project, so just @{" contact us " link author}.

period and the next line(s) containing field contents.

     In order to send a request to AID it is recommended to take 
a brief look at field names and usage.

     @{" Header and conventions " link head}

     @{" Fields " link fields}

@{u}      @{" Forms " link forms}                              @{" Main Menu " link main}     @{uu}
@ENDNODE

@NODE head "Header standard"
@{fg shine}@{u}     @{uu}AID: THE STANDARD@{u}                                @{uu}@{fg text}

     Main conventions are:

· Lines contain 70 chars

· Lines starting with "@{b}#@{ub}" are treated as comments



     AID files header contains:

@{b}#AID  @{ub}                             : Identifies AID database
@{b}#Version: n @{ub}                       : Standard version no. (now:1)
@{b}#ID: n         @{ub}                    : Release number
@{b}#Release: <date>    @{ub}               : Release date
@{b}#Uploader: <name + address(es)> @{ub}   : Uploader name and addresses
