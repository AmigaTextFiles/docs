     ----------------------------------------------------

1- What is AID?

     AID stands for Amiga Ideas Database, it's a project created for
Amiga users, collecting and spreading IDEAS about Amiga software
coming from users who need it but can't develope it. Requests can
be posted to AID maintainer(s) and may become a part of the database,
feedback (if any) coming from other users, regarding similar software
already existing or willing to develope it, will be added to the 
database as well.

     AID structure includes many archives (mostly in LHA format),
released with conventional filenames:

     - AID-faq      : This FAQ text
     - AID-docs     : The full AID documentation 
                      (Amigaguide and txt format)
     - AID-n        : The main AID request archive, where "n"
                      is the release number
     - AID-goals    : Archive containing software developed due to
                      specific AID requests
     - AID-store    : Comprehensive archive of all "old" AID requests 
                      since the first release

     - AID-ware     : Will include any special software released 
                      for use with AID archives, such as
                      browsers, search tools and similar.


     Databases will be released in several formats, filename extension
identifies the class:

     - .txt         : Ascii textfile
     - .guide       : Amigaguide browse-able archive 

     New standards, such as "KingFisher" database or other dedicated
browsers will be added as soon as possible. Possible browsers and/or
additional programs to use with AID databases will be available thru
the AID Web homepage and other distribution sites.

     ----------------------------------------------------

2 - What's AID utility?

     AID will help good ideas meeting good programmers, as these two
things not necessarily come together. AID structure is much less noisy
than any Amiga related newsgroup, contains ONLY ideas for software and
will store any request with no need to browse frequently large sets of
datas, there's no risk of missing requests.

     ----------------------------------------------------

3 - Where can I get AID full documentation?


     To use it  I recommend you reading  the official full
documentation, you can retrieve the  updated version here:

- The AID Web Homepage is located at:

     http://www.zen.it/~lcs/aid.html

- Anonymous FTP:

    - ANY AMINET SITE (directory DOCS/MISC): AID-docs.lha

- By email:

     just email me and ask:

     lcs@zen.it - Subject must start with <AID:>

- German users:

     If you need German documentation or want to ask questions in
German, just email to Andreas Spreen (andi@miglos.cadlab.de) or 
take a look at his web page: http://www.cadlab.de/~andi/


     ----------------------------------------------------

4 - Where can I get AID Files?


     At  the  moment  AID-archive  is released as a rich-ascii file,
following "kingfisher" standard for identifying records and fields.

     The  AID-archive  and  AID  download  sites  can  be found by WWW
logging  into  AID  homepage  (http://www.zen.it/~lcs/aid.html), or by
Amiga  related  newsgroups  and  possibly  by  Aminet sites. 
A mailing list could be activated soon, it will depend on feedback.

     ----------------------------------------------------

5 - What kind of requests can I post to AID?


     There are three main types of messages you can post to AID
maintainers:

- Software Request: idea suggesting a software that it is supposed 
NOT EXISTING in the Amiga PD/Shareware or even commercial
software pool. Types of software include:
  -conventional programs (executable)
  -AmigaDOS/Arexx/Scala(tm) scripts
  -Libraries and devices
  -Any language source code
  -etc

- Answer to request: If you're developing or plan to develope  a 
software following an AID request, you should let us know, and your
name will be included in the database

- Software  information:   If  an  AID  request  refers to an already
EXISTING program you should let us know, specifying the program name
and possible Internet download site(s).

NOTICE: Please avoid sending messages like ".. where can I find...?"
ALWAYS  take  a  look  at  the  many  sources  and  indexes  of  Amiga
PD/Commercial software before sending a request to AID, you will avoid
us a lot of useless work. Thanks!. 

     
     ----------------------------------------------------

6 - How can I post requests to AID?


     These requests can be posted simply by filling in the respective
forms. You can find these forms at the end of this document. Any other
request type will take more time to be processed by archive
maintainers.

   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Requests have to be posted by email to: |
   |                                         |
   |               lcs@zen.it                |
   +-----------------------------------------+
   |                                         |
   |   "Subject:" field should start with    |
   |              "AID-request"              |
   +-----------------------------------------+

     Requests can also be posted by regular snail-mail, but of course
email is highly recommended. Snail-mail address is:

     AID
     Lorenzo Colloreta
     Via A Calugi 9 - loc.Pontelungo
     51030 Pistoia
     ITALY

     ----------------------------------------------------

7 - How can I know if my request has been accepted?


     Generally AID maintainers will send a message back to the
user, informing about the destiny of the posted request. 

Requests may be rejected if:

- There is existing PD/Shareware software with the same specifications
of the request

- The request is too general and cannot help developing new software

- The request is not clearly explained

- Any other reason making the request difficult to understand

     ----------------------------------------------------

8 - Can I be useful to AID maintaining work?


     By  sending  feedback  (see question 5) you can be very useful to
the hard maintaining work needed by this project.  AID has no sense if
it is not regularly updated.

     You can also become a maintainer of the archive, in this case
contact me for more information.

     ----------------------------------------------------

9 - Is there a browser for the AID Database?


     Actually  there  is  not  any dedicated AID browser, although AID
standard  for  the  rich-ascii  format file follows the "Product-info"
guidelines  used  in  Fred  Fish collections, and should be browsed by
"Kingfisher" utility, available on Aminet and Fish collection.

     If you want to develope a dedicated browser, you're certainly
very welcome! :)

     ----------------------------------------------------

10- Is AID freely redistributable?


     AID archive and documentation are FULLY redistributable stuff,
spreading them is appreciated very much, but PLEASE don't upload AID
files  where they're already regularly updated by archive maintainers,
such as Aminet sites, Amiga newsgroups and other official sites.

     ----------------------------------------------------

11- Is feedback welcome??

     
     Feedback is not just welcome, it's absolutely necessary! :)

     AID future and distribution ways will depend on received
feedback, and may change following users needs. Send any kind  of
request/info/suggestion/criticism to my addresses:

     email: lcs@zen.it   (Subject must start with "AID:")

     snail-mail: Lorenzo Colloreta 
                 Via A.Calugi 9 - loc.Pontelungo
                 51030 Pistoia
                 ITALY

     phone : ++39 573 572058
