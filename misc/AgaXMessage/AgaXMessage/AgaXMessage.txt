Dear (addressee),
I am an enthusiastic Amiga user, and I'm really interested in future
developments of this great platform. But I think that something could be
made to quickly regain lost ground in the games and graphic field versus the
PCs and the consoles:
I read in a file that I downloaded from Aminet (docs/misc/AgaEXTENDER.lha)
about a project from an italian developer, Fabio Bizzetti (e-mail:
bizzetti@mbox.vol.it); it's an interface that plugs into the RGB port of any
AGA Amiga, between computer and monitor, and promises great things,
especially regarding games and video presentations. I think it would be
great to have it realized very soon, as I'm sure that every Amiga 1200/4000
user in the world would be interested in spending a little money now (it's
said to be a very economical device), waiting for the REAL next step in the
Amiga evolution (PowerAmiga? A new chipset?), if that interface really keeps
up to its promises.
More importantly, You could include it in the soon-to-appear Walker Amiga
which, as I know, will still use the AGA chipset; it really can't weigh that
much on the price, and in the meanwhile it will attract many people to the
new machine if we have some great applications running on it.
I strongly believe that the Amiga really deserves a better place in the
computer world than the actual one, and I'm looking forward to give You full
support on Your future projects.
Don't disappoint the Amiga community.
The Amiga is back for the future!
