total.

A 4meg simm these days has got to be pocketchange. Seriously.

No. But the signal off its BNCs specs out better than almost any

8 tracks with some restrictions (need reserve for crossfading). Can
operate and be collected independently.
 
I would say the ToasterFlyer's biggest advantage over the other Amiga
systems mentioned is a higher profile developer with good docs and
support, the others have not enjoyed any secrity in the marketplace.

> 1. Will i need a TBC to use the Toaster/Flyer?

  Yes.  You don't need one for VLM, but it's nice.

> 2.  How many Drives will i need?  One for video and one for audio?

  Flyer needs two specifically rated drives for video.  VLM only requires
one.

> 3. I have an A4000T with 12megs ram, is that enough ram? or will I need more?

  More is better.  Toaster definitely works better with minimum of 16 megs
RAM.  Never ran VLM on less than 16 megs.

> 4. Does the Toaster/Flyer have S-Video ins and outs?

  You can buy a separate card for this.  VLM has S-video in and out built
in.

> 5. how many audio tracks can i have? Can I edit them seperate from the video?

  Don't know about Flyer- think that it's 8.  VLM has unlimited audio
tracks, but they must be rendered together.  I sometimes got dicey audio
on the VLM.

  Vlab needs a Toccata for sound.  The two sync up transparently to the

  LightWave is the best, but other 3D softwares on the AMiga are faster
renderers on the '060- Cinema 4D, Aladdin 4D, Tornado 3D.

If you can even find them! :-)  8meg 72 pin 60ns SIMMs are going for about
$20, but it's better to buy 32meg SIMMs for only $40, if you can use them.
Wasn't it only a few years ago that a 1meg 30 pin SIMM would cost about
$40?!

for the flyer, yes.  for the vlab, no.

in order to do dissolves, the flyer needs two drives.  they function in
a similar way as having an a roll and a b roll.  in order to use audio
that is not married to that particular video cut, you'll need a seperate
audio drive as well.  so, an effective flyer system really requires three
drives.

vlab can work with only one drive.  it needs seperate partitions for audio
and video however, and they can not be amigados volumes.

> 3. I have an A4000T with 12megs ram, is that enough ram? or will I need more?

my a4000 has 16 megs, and its fine with the flyer setup.  i think 12 would
be fine, as long as i were not running imagefx/soundprobe/etc as well as
the flyer.  i'm prone to doing this, though.

vlab really ought to have 16, but it will work with 12.  you may have more
problems though.

> 4. Does the Toaster/Flyer have S-Video ins and outs?

with a y/c plus add-on card, yes.  in standard config, no - just
composite.  there's a s-in on the flyer card, but i don't think its
functioning.  maybe later in a mythical software update.
 
> 5. how many audio tracks can i have? Can I edit them seperate from the video?

the flyer will let you playback eight audio tracks, i believe.  i've never
used that many though - for anything really layered or tricky, i go back
to the ad516, SMPTE'd to the flyer. 

editing audio on the flyer is not like editing audio on the sunrize at
all.  it's stuck too much in the "crouton"/object oriented thinking.
problem is, its very difficult to edit the object!  i think av8r pro
provides a nicer interface to the flyer for more intricate editing, but i
have yet to cough up for it yet.  it also includes a keen jog shuttle.
woowoo!

i wouldn't call the vlab s-vid quality.  not on the a3000 here at my
studio, anyway.

> 6. Will I need a toccatta for V-Lab to get sound? Or is it built in?  If not,
> will the two cards sync up tightly?

yes, you will need a tocatta, and yes, they work wonderfully together.

the movieshop interface is more like the studio16 cuelist than the flyer -
i like it better for most things.  the flyer is *very* fast though, when
you get the hang of it.

lightwave is also much easier/faster, for me anyway.  

hope that helps.

Audio and video should really be on different drives, otherwise the
heads have to be constantly jumping around from one to the other,
which will slow things down. The audio partition can go on the main
system drive, with a second drive just for video.

Imagine is improving rapidly. It works well under CGFX, and on a 17"
monitor the display is very usable. The new 68040/060 textures render
much faster.

yeah, i was talking minimum config to get going.  i have less experience
with the vlab than the flyer, however.  i haven't noticed problems using
one drive, but i haven't pushed the vlab to extremes really.

i "imagine" it has been improving.  i haven't looked at it since version 3
though.  its hard to think about leaving lightwave, which is so well
integrated into the flyer setup.

GOOD Dy Dan..

>Thanks for all the input everybody  :)

>1. Will i need a TBC to use the Toaster/Flyer?  $$4600
Depending on the video deck you use Yes (some decks have a TBC built in
ie: on the low end of pro a panasonic AG1980 S-VHS deck has a full TBC
most BetaCam SP decks have at least a VSS (video signal stablizer) that
will work with the toaster.
on the plus side a DPS TBC IV has y/c in/out and y,ry,by out. $895

>2.  How many Drives will i need?  One for video and one for audio?
You will need two (2) video drives 4gb aprox. 20min. per drive $699.
                                   9gb aprox. 48min. per drive $899.
and one (1) Audio drive            2.1gb                       $239.

>3. I have an A4000T with 12megs ram, is that enough ram? or will I need more?
you will need 18mb  total   4mb simms $15.

>4. Does the Toaster/Flyer have S-Video ins and outs?
no.
you can add a little magic box for $899. full y/c in and out.

>5. how many audio tracks can i have? Can I edit them seperate from the video?
a total of 4 stereo tracks one each on the video drivesand 2 on the audio
drive  or 8 mono tracks.

>Right now I just need S-video quality but, if things work out I'll need

I had a few customers who had V-Labs but found to be inadiquite and got
flyers.
there is no real support for V-Lab in the US.

i just visited Newtek's web site.  And I found all the answers to the
questions I asks here!  {I guess I should have looked there first!!}  I was
surprised about the info they gave!!  Most Companies don't want you to know
about any additional hardware you'll need to get going  e.i. TBC.  But, Newtek
seemed to go out of there way to let you know that you'll need it!  WOW!!
Thats pretty COOL.  I'm still glad I asks here because it's alway good to get
feedback from real users.

>From your info, V-lab Motion doesn't seem to be what i'm looking for.  But,
the Toaster/Flyer +TBC +3 harddrives is alittle to pricey for me at this
point.  So I think I'll stay with a tape based system for now but, add a
Toaster and TBC now, and get the Flyer later if needed.

I have another question:  I lost my manual to my A4000T,  I have 12 megs ram
and want 16, can I use 'any' 4 meg ram chip or do I need a certain type?  And
what are the jumper settings to make the Amiga see it?

Thanks again for the help, I hope these e-mails helped others as well as me. 
;)

BTW: I know this has nothing to do with Studio16 but, we Amigans must flight
off the evil forces of Bill Gates any way we can!!

Standard 72-pin simm, 80 nanosec, in the 4 meg size, non-parity is fine. 
Non EDO as well. Just a plain old 72-pin simm, and no jumper settings.

My roomate gave me a 4 meg 72-pin ram chip from his PC.  The pins have a gap
in the middle of the row.  I don't know what nanosec it is or parity or EDO?
If i try it, can it hurt my Amiga?

No number on any of the chips (usually 60, 70, 80 and part of a larger
string)? Multiples of 2 chips on simm = nonparity. Multiple of 2 chips
+ 1 chip = parity. IF it fits in the slot and the side retainers
correctly it won't hurt your Amiga.

Long as we're OT, can I pick you simms experts' brains?

I've recently acquired an A4000 with (presumably) 18 megs of ram.  It has
5 simms in their proper sockets, and the proper jumpers on the board are
set,--but it seems to have only ONE meg of chip ram.

Does this denote a bad simm?  (They're SO expensive now, I hope not).

Thanx,
M

Chip ram is not s SIMM. It is more than likely a zip chip of some
type and they are not that expensive. Anyway, the first thing I'd
do is open the machine, locate the chip men and press on all the
zips to make sure they are seated properly. Chances are they are
not as I've seen this happen quite often. Also, be sure that the
machine has 2MB of CHIP RAM. It might only have one, but you should
be able to tell when you locate the zip chips. There should not
be any empty sockets.

Not so; this is A4000. Hoped I'd answered all the ram queries of the
day, but here we are again. The simm furthest from the edge of the
motherboard can be either a 1 meg or 2 meg simm. The most likely
scenario is that you currently have a I meg simm there, buried under the
three simms for fastmem. There is no jumper for chipmem.

CHIP RAM in an A4000 is a SIMM at position "U261 CHIP" on the mother board.
This is the SIMM slot nearest to the daughter board.
It will be occupied by ether a 256Kx32 (1 MB) or a 512Kx32 (2 MB) (fast ram
uses 256Kx32 or 1Mx32) 72 pin SIMM.
You can use 32 bit (nonparity) or 36 bit(parity) (the extra bits are ignored)
the SIMMS can be double or single sided (this applys only to chip, fast ram
must be single sided) 80ns or faster no more than 1" hight.

Thanx, Greenboy and Montgomery, for your thoughtful responses to my A4000
chip ram query.  

Interestingly, all five of the simms in my machine have (or at least
appear to have) the same part number.

That means the machine somehow recognizes that fifth (first, actually)
simm as chip ram, and the rest as fast?  

You can see my next question coming down the interstate:  what's the part
number for a 2-meg simm, and can I buy one at the corner store? 

Thanx, y'all,
M

So does your fastram read as 16 meg?

>You can see my next question coming down the interstate:  what's the
>part number for a 2-meg simm, and can I buy one at the corner store?

Boy that is a small simm by today's standards. Hardly any I see at the
local emporium less than 16 or 32 meg. Don't really need a part #, just
the description: 512K x 32, 80 nanoseconds or better (70 or 60), 72 pin
page-mode simm. Anybody should be able to know what you mean by asking
for a 2 meg 72 pin simm.

Greetings greenboy,

>>editor that will make a file of all of the edits and effects

>Oh no, it's quite a bit more - in theory. For the scoop on it, from this

"It's" suggests that it is. But it isn't. I was talikng about what is
available now. Not what is theory.. Meaning that the NLE (digitized
video) isn't shipping yet. And you'll have to pay more for "it" when "it"
is more than a come on.

Please excuse me if I sound passionate. I am so tired of the vaporware
concept that is so much a part it seems in the cumputer industry. Yes,
for $15,000 one can get into a PC based editing system that the digital
video part of is still being developed and probably will be a cheap
solution with a minimum of bugs within a year. Or one can buy a
Toaster/Flyer system for close to half of that price that is a tried and
true product.
Yes, I've seen a Trinity in person, Media 100, and Toaster/Flyer systems
thank you greenboy...

Yes, as has been said here Asimware's MasterISO has it covered. Version
2.0 has all you need to do any kind of sample format conversions and the
making of a CDDA file. I haven't used my 2.0 to burn yet as I just
installed it a short time ago. I have used the old version and Audio
Thunder which now seems to be incorporated into the newer version.

I have not to date done any audio CD's. Sorry I can't be of help here.

Well there you go! :) I've never seen an Amiga with a SIMM for

Chip RAM SIMMS
An Amiga with one megabyte of Chip RAM can be upgraded to two

module. One-megabyte Chip RAM systems have a 1MB module. By removing
this module and inserting a 2 MB module, Chip RAM increases to 2
megabytes.    ....   There are no jumpers to set when upgrading Chip
RAM.




>From experience, be careful when taking out the other SIMMS. The

There is a jumper J213  which should have its link on pins 1-2. This
was for a never-made Amiga which could have used 8 Megs of chip. It is
said that setting this on the wrong pins could damage the Amiga.

A 2 Meg SIMM is going to be hard to find. Try Paxtron.

I thought the supplied URP would make a better case against Trinity than
a self-authored diatribe in limited space. As of recently the NLE is
functional, by Play's definition (har-har!). Here's an exerpt from the
review in Amiga Informer:

  PLAY STATES; "Preditor is a next generation non-linear/linear video   
  editor built for speed and ease of use. Using Trinity's powerful   
  hardware, all operations happen in real-time, including compositing up
  to eight video clips and digital audio tracks simultaneously. You can
  drag through your timeline, and see every dissolve, wipe, digital   
  video effect graphic, title, and still store instantly, all at full D1
  resolution without rendering."

  REALITY: Preditor only layers two tracks of video and two tracks of
  stillstore with audio. The dealer claimed this may never change or the
  whole interface to the software might be thrown out anytime. How
  comforting. The non-linear part of Preditor has no shipping date and
  costs extra even though Play says it's included in the $4,995.
  According to dealers and price quotes, this seems to not be the case,
  but that is a matter of course when it comes to the Trinity System.

I too am not a fan of droolware, and Trinity appears to be one of the
biggest cases I have seen in a long time. I kinda hope they go bankrupt
before they sucker anybody else.

In music all that is important is the end product not the way it was
produced. Otherwise we should stop using pianos since there is an obviously
more difficult method at our disposal. (Jug playing?)

For serious music composition Bars&PipesPro is more than enough power for a
lifetime. The weakness in the composition process in B&P settings is in the
peripherals that are sometimes assembled around it. Cheaply made tone
generators that are priced beyond what they are worth is the only bottleneck
now to a complete music composition envirenment that is self contained. 

No popularity contest, no special people, just the individual and his/her

Steve, Marcel, howdy! Well, there are many positions between the "player"
approach and the "composer" approach. Sequencers also really open up the
classification "experimental composer". Again, valid (my definition of
VALID: if great music has come from this approach, then it is).

>No popularity contest, no special people, just the individual and
>his/her conceptions. What could be better than that. Bars&Pipes is the
>greatest software on the earth.

B&P is an archetypical experimental playground! It could probably be
improved; it's been a few years. If the program addresses well the needs
and likes of all types of players and composers, that will be an
improvement.

Now that this topic has gone for some time, I've examined many sequencers
on all platforms, and recalled the use of quite a few more. The ones I
gravitate toward seem to have much in common with B&P. They have had an
active upgrade life as of late - so features that I find useful have been
added/improved, and streamlining has taken place.

Your mileage may vary.

Sorry, Steve, I ain't Marcel, but I happened to write the above quotation.
Actually, I never stated I could do things on the KCS that I couldn't do on
B&P because I never even managed to get used to the display of B&P. It has
always looked too 'messy' to me, and - it's probably my fault - I never
got to a point where it stopped making me nervous after a few minutes. God
help me, I've tried it several times, but there are just a few pieces of
software you can never get to like. A good example is Audiolab where I never
got past the demo... Starting a program that switches windows on and off
by itself when you call functions is like having your ugly mother-in-law
standing behind your back with a whip supervising your every move. No
offense, Maurizio, but please tell me it's only a faulty Internet line
that's causing this, you could NOT have meant that... I'm standing here
with a company behind me specialized in audio-for-video with some money
each year set aside for technical development, but that money is going to
the bank only because nobody in HW development seems to care about timecode
control (necessities of life: food, water and SMPTE). Thus I developed a
hobby of collecting AD516s. I've got six at the moment, if anybody wants to
get into a contest with me I'd be more than happy to face the challenge.

By the way, those of you who have experience with harddisk recorder systems
on the Mac and the Gates-is-not-rich-enough-yet artefact, I hear the one
recording-one file approach is not quite common. To build a soundtrack out
of a few-second-long samples is a dream for audio-for-video people, but less
convenient for musicians. Does anyone have any experience on that?

<<<<<<<<
Musical instruments, and musical communication tools like notation,
theory, etc have been evolving forever. And yet the interface of an
instrument that has "depth" (guitar as opposed to kazoo) requires
much training and discipline to operate.

Sequencer and computer interfaces are an infant form; as power increases
the evolution of these interfaces becomes assured. But the depth of any
truly musical sequencer will always require training and discipline from
the user. And patience will probably always have its rewards.>>>>

Well put. No matter what you do in music, the quality takes work.

H e l p , 

Maybe someone can guide me to the answer to this quandry. I am a new user
of S16, and have in installed in a desktop A3000 os3.1 and all the newest
chip revisions. Oh yes, and I do have an AD516 installed.

When I try to record just two tracks at 44.1khz (or any other speed for
that matter) Studio16 will only record a few seconds (once up to about 45
secs.) and then just quit. If I hit stop and try to record again, nothing. I
have to shut off the Amiga and reboot in order to try to record again. I
have found that the recording will last a little longer if I don't have the
"monitor" button pushed in but that's it. Did I miss something in the
instructions? I am using S16 v3.0. Would switching to 3.01 cure this
problem?

Any hints would be greatly appreciated!

My setup: A3000 desktop  and OS2.04.

Old chips with old revisionsm works great.

So maybe all the new stuff is the problem.

Is your harddisk fast enaugh ???

What is the amount of your buffer in studio16 prefs ???


Succes with your quest.

Hello charles

To start with, make sure your using the rev 8  WD SCSI chip. I have a 3000 and
had the same problem. When I replaced the chip, my problems went away....

Ok, two guesses. One, you're recording all audio onto a different SCSI bus
and that bus is hanging, maybe because of bad termination (admittedly it's
a long shot that you're running an A3000 with two SCSI busses in it); Two,
Studio 16 v3.00 was, as I recall a buggy piece of software and caused me
endless problems with basically a vanilla '3000. It got better when I
upgraded to KS3.1, but it was still irritating enough for me to hit the
roof when Sunrize decided to charge us for the bugfix, 3.01. Sorry I don't
remember any detailks, just that 3.0 was pretty flakey.

Try to install the AD516 card in another slot.
Reinstall the software.
Make shore that you have enough room in the hard drive.
Make shore that you have enough memory for the buffer size.
If you are using a buffer of 512 KB studio 16 will allocate 1MB X number of
tracks.
If you are using 8 tracks you will need 8MB.
Always double the buffer size times number of tracks.

Zsolt,

<<<<<<< I never even managed to get used to the display of B&P. It has
always looked too 'messy' to me, and - it's probably my fault - I never got
to a point where it stopped making me nervous after a few minutes.>>>

Well, I kind of know what you mean. My first experiences with Bars&Pipes
came after I had used DeluxeMusic for some time. I liked the staff approach
and had come to accept the limitations on the number of notes. One just had
to use a contrapuntal style. When I opened up B&P it was sort of
bewildering. Over time I set a compositional agenda that called for two
learning elements in each peice produced. 1. A particular feature of B&P. A
tool, a menu selection, an icon etc. 2. A compositional element, A mutant
scale paired with a compound time signature or something else. In time, the
program developed a different sort of relationship to me. It became almost
like an instrument. With each revision new features were added and some were
dropped. For certain kinds of compositions I would actually use previous
releases for characteristics that had been dropped in later versions. In
time what stood out about the program was that there were so many different
methods available in it that one could do the same thing in four or five
different ways. It became clear soon that any musical   manipulation that I
could imagine was attainable with this program from a number of methods.
Even tools that did not work such as tempo tap did not matter, there was
always another way to conduct that function that worked just as good.

The features that needed fixing the most was the key and scale mode and the
staff notation. But all in all I can tolerate these shortcomings far easier
than I can the disgusting nature of the sound hardware that is made these
days.   

By the way, what is your CD recording settup? 

Good luck to you.

Steve

Some one else in the list had a similar problem. They had pulled a HD
from a different controller and installed it in their 3000 on the native
controller.
They were able to fix their problem by completly repartioning/reformating
the HD
in the 3000, then reinstalling the apps and setting up the big blocks 
partition. At first they were only able to record 2 tracks max. After,
they
were able to do 8 tracks with no problems. Good luck.

So you wouldn't want a 20-bit 98dB s/n digital audio card that has a
metal breakout box with 1/4" phone-jack inputs (2) and outputs (8),
digital i/o, and sells for under $450? (THD <.005%, 20Hz-22kHZ, A-wght)

Or the same with 8 balanced inputs (simultaneous), 10 balanced outs, 
word-clock sync, midi ports, onboard Motorola 56301 DSP (80mips), that
allows real-time 24-bit mixing and effects without CPU-load, for under $900?

Well, prepare the Disgustigator - I'm coming in!

I have already done pretty much what you have said, but I'll keep it in
mind if other suggestions fail.

Thank you for the suggestion!

M a n n y , 

Thank you very much for your hints about S16. I'm not sure I understand a
couple of them, though. 

``If you are using a buffer of 512 KB studio 16 will allocate 1MB X number
of tracks.''

Are you talking about the size of the "channel buffer". If so, mine seems
to max out at 4096K. Right now I have it at 256K.

``If you are using 8 tracks you will need 8MB.''

8MB on my Channel buffer?

``Always double the buffer size times number of tracks.''

Could you give me another example? I'm not sure I understand.

Again, thank you very much.

``To start with, make sure your using the rev 8  WD SCSI chip. I have a
3000 and had the same problem. When I replaced the chip, my problems went
away....''

I had the rev8 chip in there and the same problem existed, but I'll put it
back in again and see what happens.

Thanks for the tip.

``What is the amount of your buffer in studio16 prefs ???''

The "channel buff" is 256K and the "copy buffer" is 64K. Do you recommend a
different setting?

I can't switch back to the old chips and OS, though.

Thanks for the help!

Sounds OK by me, but try some diffrent setting for the channel buff.

I know, but it just passed my mind, some S16 users on this mailing list have
those new chips without problems.
So, i thinks that's not the problem.

Maybe the SCSI Chip of your A3000 is the problem, i have heard this on this
mailinglist.

OK, no problem.

Hi all,

Before I expend an enormous amount of time doing something which somebody
else may have done, can I appeal to you folks for some information?

1. Has anybody begun / completed reverse-engineering any or all of the
Studio16 libraries?
2. What is the potential use of having an API and / or pseudo source code
for any / all of the libraries? Specifically, I would target studio.library
as being the most "interesting" for me, but this may not be the general
case.
3. What do Studio16 users want implemented most of all. Again,
specifically, I would like, not realtime effects, but better effects -
Envelope control, pitch-shifting, etc. but this may not be the norm.
4. Does anybody know how current the available SDKs are? I was told by Todd
Modjeski around two years ago that "there was no real SDK for Studio16
v3.xx, and all the old SDK's are out of date now.".
5. Would there be any real interest in having a "whip around" and actually
paying any of the Sunrize team for their time (I am thinking of one
specific developer who was very open about the fact that he will do
anything for money) to, for instance, reconstruct as much of an SDK as
there could be for 3.xx?

I should also point out that this project has been on the boil for a long
time now, but I haven't had a) an amiga, b) a disassembler, or c) any time
free all together in the same place at one time up until now. I also
haven't noticed any of this in the FAQ. :) I'd also like to make clear
that, whilst I am a software engineer by profession, I one of the main
reasons I'm doing this is so that I can learn more about the amiga, of
which I have little practical experience.

Neil.

Count me in for the "whip around" I've got 50 UK if it goes

Kenny Nilsen (who started this mailing list) has done a lot of work
investigating, breaking down and documenting the Studio16 Sample and Cuelist
file formmats and written a number of great utilities and a fine modular
application QMaster. (Thank you Kenny, we are forever in your debt!)
Kenny also made some progress on an API for the libraries but ran into
some problems. He could tell you better than I.

Ben Fuller of the original Sunrise Team has hinted that he may be willing
to write an AHI driver for the AD516. He's a member of this list and was an
active participant for a while. However...he hasn't contributed since the
middle of February. He has never really said he would do this for certain
(and I understand his caution in doing so.) Other list members have stated
that he hasn't been reponding to email they send him.

Please Ben..If you're reading this, let us know if you have made any progress.

Ah AHI driver would be the most immediately useful. Complete understanding
of the Libraries could lead to driver development for apps such as AudioLab.
Wouldn't the AD516handler be something useful to decompile also?

Access to the Recording and playback functions from other applications would
be very useful. We might see better effects if someone who can program
the DSP (and can get data to and from it) gets interested.

I think many of the members of this group would be willing to contribute $$
to a project of this nature. Troy Silvey (another list member) tried to
get people to commit to this a year ago, before this list existed. I was
quick to sign on.

Hi Neil,

I have disassembled the studio.library 3, the AD516 handler, Scala S16 EX
EX and the StudioOpen comand. I haven't really had the time to go through
the sources yet. Another thing that can make it problematic is that the
studio.library put its args on the stack (functions and parameters can't be
traced by patching the library as this would change the stackpointer) so you
would be forced to parse every line in the disassembled source(s). There are
no fd, lvo nor include files for the v3 library (only old ones v1/v2 which
aren't compatible with 3.0).

The basic for it is the same as for studio.library 2.0 AFAIU. That means a
call to add a module, antoher call to receive broadcasted messages, a third
call to allocate handler/channels and functions to handle messages and act
upon them when they arrive. Cleanup is the reverse order to other calls (I
take this on the fly so it might not be an exact recall of it..).
Anyway, it's quite simple and the things that need to be found is the LVO
for the calls and what parameters are put on the stack in what order.

I won't have time to analyse the sources before after the summer atleast as
I have a few projects going, but if you feel the urge and motivation for
working on this I could send you a copy of what I have (not much other than
disassembled sources..).

A while before I started on the Studio16 add project I created a library
called kstudio.library (just the worktitle.. :). It was a library interface
that invoked arexx commands. It could have worked nicly playing and
triggering files from HD - the latest version would also record and handle
SMPTE, but due to a bug in the Studio 16's arexx interface (closing files
while playing) it was terminated.

Later I also did some research on the ADSP2105 dsp chip to target the
hardware directly. I managed to write a DSP download program to download DPS
object code to the ADSP onboard, but I wasn't able to enable sound even if
the code seem to work (reading the sample and spend the time it was suppose
to on playing it). Dr. Fuller provided me with some docs on the Studio 16
DSP environment and I got a book on the ADSP21xx from a person on the list
(Brian Fields), but there are no ADSP assemblers on the Amiga (I don't have
a PC) and I would need to learn the ADSP21xx assembler language from
scratch.

Dr. Ben Fuller also mentioned he _might_ write a driver for AHI, or look at
the AHI API docs. We can wait and see how the status on that is currently.

I personally would like to see a generic library from Ben to access the
hardware directly with memory buffering. This way other people could pick it
up from there and write an AHI driver based on that library (overhead is no
problem here) and the library could also be used in other applications that
doesn't need/want to support AHI etc.:


                   / AHI driver
                  /
  generic library --- Other driver software
                  \
                   \ Other applications


>4. Does anybody know how current the available SDKs are? I was told by Todd

There are none (atleast at this time..). It's in the head of the developers.

I guess we have been focusing on v3 of the library so much we haven't been
able to see other options. Why not use v2 of the library if sound in/out is
the only features we want to get ? It is doucmented and there are several
example sources on who to use it. We could even 'zap' it to rename it to
something else so that there won't be total system confusion. Just a thought
anyway.. :-)

I would like to see better effects, too. I would like them to be
previewable in real time (maybe at a lower quality if necessary), but
the quality is more important. I already have some decent outboard
gear (Alesis Quadraverb2, etc.), and if new effects in Studio16 aren't
as good or better, I won't spend time using them.

As always, I fervently hope Studio16 will be improved and experimented
with. I also always have to restate my hope that digital I/O will be
considered as a possible enhancement to S16. I was salivating at the
prospect of getting a DD524 board when Sunrize announced it. I think
they were on the verge of releasing it when they 'went under'. I am
still VERY interested in it or an equivalent.

I'm sorry that I cause you some confusion.

What I meant was using a buffer of 512 KB with 2 tracks studio 16 will
allocate 1MB
with 4 tracks 2 MB and so on.

So in your case will be 256 KB times number of tracks, check your cue list and
see
how many tracks you have loaded, if you have 2 tracks you need 0.5 MB with 4
tracks 1 MB.

>``If you are using 8 tracks you will need 8MB.''

>8MB on my Channel buffer?

Yes, if you are using 8 tracks with a chnnel buffer of 1024K 

>Could you give me another example? I'm not sure I understand.

If your cue list opens with 4 channels and you have a channel buffer of 256K
studio16 will allocate
1 MB for playback and record you need another megabyte to load WB, Studio16
will need one to two megabytes
depending how many modules you have loaded, so in this configuration you will
need 4MB.
To run comfortably your machine should really have 8 MB fast ram.

-How much ram do you have?
-What size of HD and/or partition are you using?
-Are you using the A3000 scsi controller?
-Do you have one accelerator card with memory on it?
There is something else that you can try, in preferences is a check box (Use
Extended Memory)
click on this box quit preferences save setup quit studio16, than load
studio16 and try to record and see what happens.

I think it would be a good idea to mail these dissembled sources to
anyone on the list who thinks he is a good enough programmer to dig
some clues from them. The more people work on this, the better the
chance of getting some docs out of it. 
The ideal outcome would be a programmers' guide with example code,
like the "Rules for Tools".

Quite. My own interest is to develop effects which people don't MAKE
outboard stuff to do. :)

Ah. Sore point. I had an amazing slanging match with both Premier Vision in
the UK (my supplier) and Sunrize themselves because I basically bought the
AD516 as my home-studio solution, incorporating the DD524 for direct
digital mastering to my DAT machine. I was pretty unhappy when after
telling me they would have a board in "any day now", PV stopped answering
my calls. I was just as unhappy with Sunrize, who advertised the DD524, not
as a vapourware product , but as a real on-the-shelves item. Short of
sueing them (which would have probably not done me any good), there was
nothing I could do but be incredibly angry.

Yeah- I had figured this already. They sure do some stack-churning. :)
Makes you wonder what compiler generated such strange code. I have been
doing exactly as you say, disassmebling the library line-by-line. Yes, it
does get tedious, particularly with my inexperience with 680x0 code. I have
the relevant books and manuals, though, so although it's slow going at the
moment, it should get easier as I learn the most common "features" of
whatever compiled the code and other such stuff.

Yeah- it's a lot of donkey work, but Resource makes it much easier.

To be honest, I doubt that they will have much use to me right now- I've
been commenting things which weren't obvious to me but will be obvious to
every 680x0 guru; I would maybe like your best-guess at which functions are
at which ordinal in the jump table. That could be another point of view
which I could compare with the list of vectors I'm collecting.

Yeah. I saw your stuff (and contacted you :)) a while ago, when I was
working somewhere else, and while I appreciated what you'd developed, I
didn't see it as being low level enough to be of use to a "serious"
programmer, if you see what I mean. Since that time, I've developed enough
commercial applications to realise exactly what I want out of this and
exactly how I should go about it. I just need amiga experience (and time,
lots of time :)).

Not having a PC could be a problem. :) The PDF file for the 21xx series has
lots of interesting information- I figured someone would have written a
pdf-viewing utility on the amiga by now. No?

I would certainly like to investigate the chances of writing some 2105
code, however. I think that, with an amiga, a win95 machine, and an
OpenBSD/i386 machine here (and soon a Linux/i386 P60), I should have a
shooting chance at being able to get a compiler or cross-compiler. :)

I think we could wait forever for something from the ex-Sunrize people.
It's a shame they build superb hardware and couldn't stay in business
(because they didn't release SDK's to developers, of course ;)). It really
kills me- the software could (and did at the time) beaten anything around
at that price point on any platform, but it all went badly wrong.

You have crystallized another idea of mine. That would indeed be cool,
possibly cooler than giving people the API to Studio16.

If anyone wants to make the release version of Studio16_2.0 available, it
probably would help a little if I could play with it. Maybe it should go on
the web page with the other versions?

Argh! No thanks. ;) I spent many hours once figuring out all I needed to
know about the file format (I have some scribbled sheets of paper

which was quite unbelievably slow and blew up the output when the input hit
zero (It turned input 0x0 into output 0xff00 ;)). Wow, what terrifying
memories. :)

Thanks,

Are you talking about the disassembler for the Amiga called Resource?
If so, do you have any idea how I can purchase it.  Or, any idea how I
can find out who may have it for sale?  I've been looking for this item
for sometime.  I recall the magazine ads for it years ago and it was a
bit pricey at that time.  I'm sorry I didn't get it when I had the
chance.

Thanks and regards, Mike

There is a port of a Unix Acrobat reader, but I found I got much
better results using the proper Adobe reader on the Fusion emulator.

Absolutely, like with the Toccata card. You get the toccata.library with
the function calls like raw (double buffered) record/playback that you
can call from your own software. If the Toccata wasn't so damned noisy by
professional standards, it'd be a marvellous tool.

Very true!!! We dub (lip-sync) movies in my company, and we use a custom-
made controller program that controls S16 and a texteditor to display the
text to be recorded and starts/stops S16 recording through Arexx. We do
upwards of a thousand recordings a day in both our studios, and have come
to find that S16 version 2.08 reacts a lot faster. V3 takes longer (sometimes
even half a second!!!) to release a file after play/record to AmigaDOS,
while v2.08 always does that within 40 milliseconds. For mixdown, the Cuelist
in v3 is a joy to work with, but for simple rec/pb v2 is more than perfect.

M a n n y , 

Thank you for your help. 

``What I meant was using a [channel?] buffer of 512 KB with 2 tracks studio
16 will
allocate 1MB with 4 tracks 2 MB and so on.''

Allocate 1MB of what?

``...check your cue list and see how many tracks you have loaded...''

The problem I'm having is happening during recording, not playback. I am
not sure, but I don't think the Cue List has anything to do with recording,
does it?

-How much ram do you have? The zips are full -- 16 fast, 2 chip
-What size of HD and/or partition are you using? a 100mb partition, big
block. Sometime when I get this working I'll make it bigger. 
-Are you using the A3000 scsi controller? Yes. If you mean my HD is plugged
into my motherboard.
-Do you have one accelerator card with memory on it? No. Just the AD516.
There is something else that you can try, in preferences is a check box (Use
Extended Memory) I am using it.

To reiterate, I am having problems with recording. I seem to be only able
to record from only a few seconds to up to 45 seconds or so and then the
recording stops and no more can be done until I reboot. This happens at any
sampling rate.

So far I'm just able to experiment with the supplied samples and the cue
list. I look forward to the recording part.

Thanks again for your hints.

What I would most like to see is easier, finer detail, waveform scrolling, on
a fully zoomed in display, in order to find the zero crossing point (see
below).  (I'm not talking of audio "scrubbing", here, which is not
implemented, and would truly be appreciated.)  Also, an automatic zero-
crossing point locate for all edits.  This hasn't been mentioned, AFAIK, and
it's probably the biggest failing of the software.

Or better yet, people should probably disassemble them self since I'm not

Sure, there are several already (ghostscript, xpfd, pdfview.. :) I have
looked at the specsheets btw. If we could take advantage of the dsp it could
open for lots of possibilities. Realtime effects is one :)

Check out Analog Device's homepage. They have some of of this stuff. :)

I know Dhomas Trenn has a support page for Studio 16. The 2.0 docs are
available from there. The page is at:

-------------------------

Hi Maurizio,

long time no see..

Did the SMPTE read work ok ?

I have another way to get the current SMPTE time:
If you open the library and use this function:

_LVOsmpte_QueryTime=-948   ;no args needed, this uses current smpte sink

It will return the current SMPTE in D0 (long) as <h:8 m:8 s:8 f:8>

I might have some interresting news according to docs on the v3 library
in near future. I will announce on the ML.

An Arexx Plugin system, so we can implant tools like Limiting/Compression,
Echo, Delay etc etc via external programs.

Hi all!

I am pleased to announce that I have managed to play/record sound through
the Studio 16 environment, setting parameters and multitrigg samples (eg.
stereo samples). This is with version *3* of the system!

This means the following:

        a) we can start planning what modules we want/need/can replace
        b) we can take advantage of the Studio 16 environment for other
           applications

But before any concret will be made I will go through some docs I got from
dr. Ben Fuller last night and create a 'stub' library for the functions in
studio.library v4.x (Studio16 3.x) so I can create new autodocs, FDs and
LVOs. I will also have to go through the gui interface docs so we can make
modules 'compatible' with the Studio 16 look to some degree atleast.

This will take a while, as I have mentioned earlier I have a few other
projects going that I need to finish, but I will now put the Studio 16
progress at a higher pri.


- Kenny

I wanted to let every one know who might be working on any
thing for S16, API's or AHI that I want to help out with 
programming. Just mail me direct at tsilvey@mail.egleston.org
or at this juno.com address. Meanwhile I'm still working out a
new sequencer interface, so if any one has any ideals for the
user interface look they would like to see, let me know. I can't
say it will wind up looking like what you had in mind, but I want
to get as much input as possible.

Hello Kenny and everyone at this list,

*Below is the answer of my requests from Marc Albrecht,* the person
who is directly involved on SamplitudeOpus development.
He is a very dedicated and interested person on Amiga enviroment.
So, please all the people who really cares about this issue, I mean
Studio16 users and programmers, let's try to help Marc on this.
His statement is very clear: IN A FEW HOURS OF WORK!!!!!!!
he can be well defined a source code.
so let us help him on what he needs, to our own benefits.

I am actually an user of two AD516 cards, One Prelude card
and one Toccata audio card.
SamplitudeOpus is a very nice Recorder Sampler to the Amiga.

Perhaps even Mr.Fuller can help him.
We must think that in our Amiga community we need to  be united
and must work with solidarity.
Only this way we can grow up again.

Best Regards,
Francisco Rabay Junior
Brasil
(South America)







Moin, Francisco Rabay Junior,

> Do you think it is possible to give support to the AD516 Studio card?

Yes. We stand to our word that EVERY soundcard that has a market on the
Amiga can be supported. We do need some API, some source code etc, which
is all well defined and should be able to do within a few hours of work.

Please - if you see a possibility of getting in contact with Studio16
programmers
who _want_ to have Samplitude Opus support, let me know and tell them
my EMail ad. Thanks.

I like it!  Why not?! Though v3 was far beyond in developement, I
recall v2 was very solid.

Hi Ren,

We can /probably/ get an AHI driver, but the problem as mentioned before is
that AHI buffers data from memory while Studio 16 from disk (that's ok
really as they target different usages). The trick is to fool Studio 16 to
think the memory buffer is a part of a Studio 16 file. That can be done by
writing a special filehandler and do some fine timing to get continues
sound. Possible, but not easy.

More information about ProStation later..

About FX's - there is no problem to create new modules for Studio 16, but
when it comes to realtime effects it will get more tricky as this need to
dowload object code to the onboard DSP. The DSP is already in use by Studio
16 and I think that the DPS effects have to be integrated in the Studio 16
DSP 'driver' object. I don't think that is realistic. If Studio 16 doesn't
need to be running the DSP can be used of course for this purpose. More
realistic plugins for Studio 16 is a effect processing (non-realtime), new
Mixer module and envelope editor and that sort of stuff. :-)  However, I
should take some reservation as I haven't yet verified that the module
functions uses the same stucture as before (most likely they do).

I know a few other people on the list has the same fd file I had a
breakthrough with last night. If it's ok with you I would like to create a
doc package which included a 'stub' library to access the studio.library by
registers (overhead not noticable) [probably pluss some interface
functions], a new standard autodoc and include files (lvo/protos/i/h etc).
The initfunc of the stublibrary will also take care of initing of the
environment, checking installation etc.

We should probably get an overview of how many developers there are on the
list that wants to contribute and in what area.

Also, there will be some waiting as these things will take some time, but I
think it secure the foundation a bit to know it's possible to go a step
further.

I wrote a small program called NewPlay. It replaces StudioOpen and
StudioPlay  (and is 1/6th of the size :). It plays stereo files and can
optionally be triggered. It uses the system 3 of Studio 16. Demo/test
purpose only. It does only work with Studio 16 samples.

I was hoping some of you could download it from my web page and see if it
runs well on your system. Note that Studio 16 must _not_ run (as applies to
the old Studio#? comands due to resource allocation). I would appreciate
feedback on my private email.

USAGE:

NewPlay

  dumps some info

NewPlay SAMPLE_L SAMPLE_R

  plays both samples, or to trigger them with left mousebutton:

NewPlay SAMPLE_L SAMPLE_R trigg

Not quite true. Actually it runs fine along with Studio 16, but if you
started NewPlay first, Studio 16 won't start unless you use the StudioClose
command and then flushes the libs (eg. "c:avail flush").

I think this got lost during Kenny's great breakthrough announcement...any
comments, or suggestions.

What I'd like to see most is an automatic zero-crossing-point locate for all
edits, positive-going to negative (or vice-versa).  If that's not practical,
faster subframe-level, detailed waveform scrolling (fully zoomed-in display)
in order to find that zero-crossing-point easier, and more important, quicker.
This hasn't been mentioned in the list, AFAIK, and it's a big failing of the
software. (I'm not talking of audio "scrubbing", here, which also is not
implemented, and desireable.)

You're right. Weird, I set chmod flags to 744 for the file, is there other

Ok, anyone who wants to give it a try can write me in private email and I

Hi Burr and all,

just to make things clear: there can't be done anything on _existing_
modules. All features wanted must be made from scratch. That's why I hoped
more people would forward ideas and opinions so it would be more legitimate
to create new modules as they will involve some work.

Greenboy,

<<<<<<<<<<<<
So you wouldn't want a 20-bit 98dB s/n digital audio card that has a
metal breakout box with 1/4" phone-jack inputs (2) and outputs (8),
digital i/o, and sells for under $450? (THD <.005%, 20Hz-22kHZ, A-wght)

Or the same with 8 balanced inputs (simultaneous), 10 balanced outs, 
word-clock sync, midi ports, onboard Motorola 56301 DSP (80mips), that
allows real-time 24-bit mixing and effects without CPU-load, for under $900?
>>>>>>>>>>>>


<Well, prepare the Disgustigator - I'm coming in!>

Hmmmm! These things sound wonderful enough but the Disgustigator is waiting
to bite the person that comes in with a typical tone generator! I have
looked high and low for a good deal on tone generators and they are all
overpriced for the stinky performance they deliver. Give me a good budget
and I will make a GOOD tone generator for a FAIR price. (Send the money
cashiers check for 5million dollars for development) I will also not have
the rotten exclusivity that Roland, Korg, Yamaha and all of the others do.
You can buy it direct from me or any store in the world that wishes to carry
them. How is that for a good deal?

Steve

Hi Kenny, I have try your program : it's fantastic. But if I can, may I
suggest
you to add a feature to stop the sample playing by adding a CLI ctrl C check
for example.

And for the ease of people you can file attach your progam to a message.
it's only about 2K.

bye, and thank again for your effort to keep Sunrize product alive ...

Hi Daniel,

NewPlay is merly a private 'pilot' project to test the v3 functions. I have
planned to build on it and extend it further. Next up will be a GUI for it
with a filerequester and a 'stop' button.

It's tempty, but no messages should have MIME attachments on the ML.

Memory is allocated on studio16 startup so although you are only recording
your plyback setup will determine the memory that will be reserved.
As log as your channel buffer  isn't bigger than 512KB you should be ok
ever with 8 channels

Did you try to use another slot for th card?
I think that either the studio16 libraries, or the handler are given you
problems,
some of them might be old versions, just delete them an reinstall them.
Once a had a similar problem, and the way I solved it was by deleting all the
studio16
files and installing them again.

All right, good to hear it. If I can help you in any manner, let me know.
I've done some program for my personal use in assembler, C and C++.

i was in an interesting situation today.

i was working with a client on the final mixing of music for a television
commercial, and we were both 
advocating different approaches.  both the mixes were fairly complex.  so, i
had an idea.  i went in to
the Studio16_3:Apps drawer and made a copy of Cuelist, naming it Cuelist2.

i was able to have two different cuelists open at the same time, so we could
discuss our mixes, change
them, and compare.  all i had to do was turn off/on the cuelists depending on
which one we wanted to
listen to.

this is the same way i was able to use the v3.0 +3db meters from within v3.01.
 i also put a copy of
dirwork in the same drawer, making it available from within studio16.

anyways, this idea with the cuelists truly saved the day here, and made for a
quicker, more professional
mix.

just thought i'd share. . .

that is an excellent approach. I could have used that many times
to work out mixes and projects, but nerver thought of it. I don't 
think I would have thought S16 would have worked that way.
Thanks for the tip, It will definitly go to good use.

Hello Jonathan;

Don't know if you've had much activity on this.

I have Dr. T's Phantom box plugged into my A2000. The s/w
stopped working somewhere between my 68030 to 68060 upgrade,
and/or WB2.1 to WB3.1 upgrade. I too have the same crashing
problem as you. I can get the s/w to run when I boot off the
WB1.3 diskettes. I'm pretty sure the s/w is o/s dependent, as
opposed to 68xxx dependent, although I can't say for sure
because I have a hard time running my WB1.3 unless I disable my
68060 accel card (natch). I have the ROM Switcher installed,
but it seems to conflict with soft-reboot on my accel card.

The h/w box still works with B&P. The only use for the Phantom
s/w would be to SMTPE stripe your tape. If you can find another
way to stripe your tape, the rest should be pretty transparent,
because the MIDI half works fine. In fact, the MIDI/SMPTE
conversion is processed inside the box, so that works too. Like
I said, the only part which doesn't work is the tape striping
part (which requires the Phantom s/w).

Dr. T's went the way of the dodo bird a while ago. It might
have been swallowed up by another firm (Mark Of The Unicorn??
MAYBE...). Regardless, don't bother looking for more recent
s/w.

The Phantom module included in the B&P Accessories is the same
version as the one that shipped with the Phantom h/w.


Hope this helps.


Sounding off;

I hope this isn't too far off topic... I've used a Phantom
SMPTE 
interface on a 68000 Amiga, but would like to connect it to a
68040 
Amiga. The support software crashes (the system) on 040's! Has
anyone 
found a patch for this? Does anyone know what became of Dr.
T's, the 
designers of the Phantom? Thanks for any insights.

``Its been a couple of weeks since I received anything from this list, have
I been unceremoniously removed or is everyone on vacation?''

I think your second guess might be correct.

I've been wondering the same thing.

I have simply done "Track-at-once" recording with ISO 2, but I know that
"Disc-at-once" is much more system/cpu intensive.  Therfore, my only
suggestion is to try the "Track-at-once" record and "finalize" the disc when
you are finished.

Hi Ren,

you can't. SmpteOut is GUI only and has no comandline nor arexx interface to
control it.

Is there anyone that want Studio 16 to support other formats than the
built-in Studio16_1.0, Studio16_2.0, AIFF, RAW, SVX8 ?

I was thinking of creating some other filters such as WAV and an enhanced
version of the Studio 16 format. The new format would get support with a new
editor as well. Progress based on feedback.

How about Newtek Flyer Audio Format... There is conversion software but it
would be great to load directly into S-16
