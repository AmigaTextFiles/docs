Does anybody has a clue how to realize using truetype fonts on amiga ?

I have ttf-manager tested. It shows the font correct but after saving it, no
program can use this font ??

Any hints ?

Greetinx,
Pearl

I knew there was something I missed... Intellifont was the right key word !!
Thanx !

That's another aspect. But what about a driver that make programs using
standard fonts work with tt fonts ??

Ok.
You are right.
Simply made the same mistake a second time...
Look at the date: my clock is broken and I wanted my message to have the

Subject: [just-amiga] AmigaDos Copy Command

From: Rick Giles <rickgiles@clear.net.nz>


Interesting this is the first time I've noticed. I don't seem to be able to
copy one full directory to another in amigados, not if it includes sub
directorys of it's own. Bet there's a way, there has to be really.

I want to move certian folders in my Yam draw to my floppy disk, replaceing
and displacing the old ones. In this way I can have my mail all on just a disk
yet also the master on the HD. It will let me answer mail on the other amiga,
which I'm writing this on.

Catch the drift? I don't want to have to use Dopus to copy the files accross.
There must be a way to do it in an executable.

 Cool Enough, TTFN!

X-SLUIDL: 940DEAE7-CFCE11D2-BCB60060-974BE5E3

From: Sergio Maiandi <sergiom@intercom.it>

Hello everybody

As you probably know on the last CU Amiga CD there was the full
version of the 3d rendering prog Cinema 4D

Unfortunately after the installation i'm asked for a serial code,
which is not written in any part of the cd or of the magazine

Does anyone of you have this code ?

TIA

Hi
Very basic question from a , not so young as I would like to be,
novice.  I am trying to extract a picture file from a PC formatted
floppy.
Is the MS-Dos set up in the Cross Dos prog the correct way to go.
I assume the MS stands for Microsoft but can't see it written
anywhere.
Thanks.
Terry

Is it true that with some telecom in the US, all calls are free but the
catch is you have to listen to a 12 second advert before each call?
anyone got any ideas?! i'll probably get moaned at for mucking up
again :)

   Cross dos does indeed read MicroSponge DOS disks. If you only have a
standard lowdensity disk drive in your amiga then you can only read 720k
MS-Dos disks though. 

   To use cross dos, you just type "Mount PC0:" in shell, (me thinks.)

Try the 'all' switch:

copy yam/#? df0: all

This will create the necessary subdirectories, and copy all files in them as
well.

There's a new service doing this. You call and listen to a 
series of ads. For every someodd seconds of ads, you get a 
certain amount of free long distance. You can "bank" as 
much free long distance time as you like. The catch is that
when you make your phone call, if you get an answering machine, 
no answer or the line is busy, you have to start over. Your
free air time is not rolled over to your next call.

It's simply incredible what Linus Akesson wrote on 28-Feb-99:

|>Try the 'all' switch:
|>copy yam/#? df0: all

Thanks, that'll be ideal. There is one slight flaw with this system
though, which I suppose I can fix. Copy will still leave the old
files there which are now redundent, so I suppose I can also use
the same trick first by deleating df0:outgoing all first.

Thanks dude. Sorted.

...the deleting trick works. Unfortunatly it isn't possible to
copy entire directorys still, as I wanted. Not to worry, this
new trick lets me delete everything so I can do it the old way
just fine.

Truely sorted.
                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

   Does it slow down like that when you run it from disk? If not, then I
guess it must be something your running in the background. Try booting on
minimum configuration.

Acceptable Use Policy, as anyone who is on the 'net should know, because
ISP's usually have pretty extensive ones they show you before you sign up.

Enterprise didn't have one, Demon didn't have one, and FreeServe don't have

X-SLUIDL: 940DF2BD-CFCE11D2-BCB60060-974BE5E3

From: Rick Giles <rickgiles@clear.net.nz>

It's simply incredible what Matthew O'Neill wrote on 01-Mar-99:

|>copy work:drawer work2: all

Not on my computer, mister. That just copys all the contents of
work:draw to work2:, but I don't want that at all.

I have a heap of draws and files in work: and only want draw and
it's contents to be copyed to work2:. Using the command you suggest
it will do that to the contents but not the draw too.
 Hence all the files of draw are loose in work2:.

The only way around it I guess is to make a dir first and then
copy 'all' to that. I wouldn't mention it except this seems a bit
ineloquent next to other amigados commands.

And what I'd give for a 'move' command, just like dopus has.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Why not try filemaster or directory opus.  If you want a copy of filemaster I can email you it if you like.  It is a good simple program for moving files around etc.

copy work:drawer#? work2: all
copy work:drawer work2:drawer all

`Copy' can either copy the directory entry itself, or with the second one
can create a new drawer itself (Note there is no "/" on the end).

Umm.. if noone else on the list minds?  I've attached a Move command.  This
is also *very* useful as it'll wildcard renaming - e.g. "Rename BAD_#? #?"
renames bad_42d95c22.mo0 to 42d95c22.mo0.

I actually got Yahoo chat working once, and it was crap. The fact that it
doesn't work at all on the miggy is a blessing. Understand? If not, feel
free to insert foot in mouth.

Demon have an AUP, FreeServe have an AUP, ClaraNet have an AUP, in fact,
pretty much every ISP on earth have an AUP! How else can ISP's throw off
spammers etc without getting sued?

Erm,. he`s right ma`lado..
FreeServe have one Demon Have one,.. EVERYONE has one these days!!!!
Not that anyone ever bloody reads em, :) ... but you see em EVERYWHERE!
I`m sure most people just drag the scroll bar to the bottom of the page
and hit the Accept button. :)))
Although I did read the Freeserve one,.. wanted to see if there was anything
about having more than one account open,. and there aint :) ehehehe!
(Just in case they decided they would like to close it down for no reason :))
Took me half an hour to trudge thru it! Could hardly keep myself from 
falling asleep,.. then I would close my eyes and realise,. open em and lose
track of where I was, then end up further back up the page, looking for it :)
That sodding thing as about 20K! :)

It's simply incredible what Andy Kinsella wrote on 02-Mar-99:

Right you are! A little weird that though, the only difference is
the wildcards and suddenly a directory is created also.

So she works, th#?ks muchly.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Thanks for that good information, that 'move' works like a charm!

And I sure do see how this raname trick will be of great benifit,
thanks for throwing that in! It's great to learn these little tricks.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

 Hold the phone, it's all fixed.

I was asking for the mail archive command but it turns out that it works the
way stated in the docs and the problem I had was that it did this before it
was able to do what it had to do to the message...

Things are fine, ignore orig mssg.

                  Cool Enough, TTFN!!

Yes, that. You are actually supposed to read it first though :)

How else can they deal with spammers without getting sued for breach of

   I see. Well, it looks like its just baddly written. What you could do is
hold down both mouse buttons on boot for the early startup options, go to
boot options and disable CPU cache. This might help.


See ya.

Hello

You knew it, you think you never need a library, and don't
install it the HD... And when you need it som time later, it's
not possible to find it again :)))

WHERE CAN I FIND THE MEDPLAYER.LIBRARY?!

Thank you in advance! :)

 Is it possible to view amigaguides on a PC or Mac??

Perhaps one way would be to convert them to html format, I think I've seen
that mentioned before.

                  Cool Enough, TTFN!!

Hello Andrew,

    Thank you again :)
#I see. Well, it looks like its just baddly written. What you could do is#
#hold down both mouse buttons on boot for the early startup options, go to#
#boot options and disable CPU cache. This might help.#

I did indeed try this method and wrote into scripts_ degraders_ ect but to
no success, maybe I just need to goto the programmer and see if he made a
AGA version :)).  I *really *do appreciate your help as I am the only person
in our whole city that knows about Amiga's

Let us know your ideas on the recent news about clickBOOM and the
so called programmer who was cheated. Do you think it will effect
sales of future games? will it put developers off signing with clickBOOM?
we want to hear your views so get writing.

From: Rick Giles <rickgiles@clear.net.nz>

It's simply incredible what LISAorNICKorMATHEW wrote on 06-Mar-99:

Timaru, that's rare. I'm in Christchurch, basicly.

|>I have just found an address in my Yam address book -
|>aminet-server@wuarchive.wustl.edu

I think it's ment to be a way to get the aminet files via email, yes.
I couldn't make it work so I've given up and deleted it. I've got
ftp and that's a bit easyer and has some useful features.

|>I have email access only.

I just wanted to tell you/yous, since your from Timaru, that there
is a way to get web pages when you have only email access. It hasn't
worked for months but I tryed it again and looks like it's fixed.

Address: getweb@usa.healthnet.org
Subject: (leave blank)
Body command for normal pages: get URL
Body command for Alta Vista searches: SEARCH ALTAVISTA keywords and/or
phrases
Body command for Infoseek searches: SEARCH INFOSEEK keywords
Body command for Yahoo searches: SEARCH YAHOO keywords
Pages are usually returned with thirty minutes or so.
Word wrap is ok.
There is a limit of approximately forty accesses per week. If you exceed
this then further accesses are prohibited for a week.

Eg Get http://www.tv3.co.nz/frame.asp?page=programme

 And it'll return the page to you in mail. Some pages don't work,
but only few. 

Cool huh? I use it all the time, or I used to. 


                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Don't shout, you're hurting my ears.

Go to your fave Aminet mirror and get mus/play/Swomp.lha.  It's a
MED/OctaMED player by moi; the libs are in the archive.

Who do you plan on interviewing next and who decides which questions
to ask ???

If we know in advance who the interview is with can we submit
questions ourselves and you pick say the best 20 questions or so..  ???

Many Thanks For All !!!!

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi,

When I had my old internet account if my computer crashed and I had
to reset I could load up Miami and press connect and instead of
resetting the modem and trying to go online it would just grab the
IP and DNS etc servers so I wasn't logged off and this saved me
money, now with my new account I have different settings and so if
I reset and load up miami it trys to hang the modem and go online
again so I have to disconnect and reconnect costing me alot more.

Anyone know how to get back to how it was? its very useful because
even with 32mb the computer burns alot of power using many i'net
apps :) any help gladly welcomed.

Toodle Pip!

Not sure you can get this back if it's broken or altered the settings in 
such as way that it longer can. The key items are under the PPP menu in 
the Miami interface, under the item/feature 'Quick Reconnect' which can 
be set for Ram (meaning from the stored info in memory) or file (as per 
your software settings or disabled. Keep in mind that if the information 
within your memory has been trashed by an irrant program, there can be no 
quick reconnect. It seems that either this stored information is bigger 
or more easily stomped on with new versions of maimi. My re-connects are 50% 
lucky if it's just unrelated software that crashes.

It depends whether you want to use Java as a standalone programming
environment, or as a way of running applets within a browser.

If the former, then guavac and kaffe are usable.

If the latter, then no Amiga browsers support Java yet.

X-SLUIDL: 0156F31B-D58F11D2-BCB60060-974BE5E3

From: ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

I ran across some mp3 files today. I have aminet sets 1-7, and I've searched
for mpg, and mp3, but so far I haven't a simple doc file on any of the stuff
to explain how to set any of the stuff up to play an mpg or mp3 file.

I have an a3k w/25 mhz. Can this even be done ? I've converted mpg video and
viewed a few mpg video files out of the box without splitting the audio out.

But I've actually never even tried to fire up an mp3/mpg audio file.

   Well, MP3s are simply compressed audio (eg. music CD's). You can play
them with MPEGA or AmigaAMP. As for whether you Amiga can handel it, no. My
A1200 040/25mhz can't play MP3 at full speed w/ a 68k player, so your 030
A3K will have even more trouble. (My PPC MP3 player works at full quality
though ;)

   If you want to play MP3s on your amiga, then you'll have to get that MP3
hardware decoder, whats it called again? (I thinks its 'MPEGit' or sommin)

Or of corce, a PPC board ;)  (Aparently an 060/50 can just about do it too)

See ya.

I don't know about an A3000 @ 25mhz but I do know that an 040 /40 has no
trouble at all playing mp3's.  I now have an 060/50 and it of course it's a
lot better.

Most sites use JavaScript, not Java.  The well-designed ones are still
perfectly usable with JavaScript turned off.  AWeb-II 3.something
(the latest version) does JavaScript okay, if you really want it.

As for full-blown Java: IMNSHO there's not much chance that it'll
appear in Amiga browsers any time soon.  FWIW, I tend to find that
Web sites reliant on Java aren't generally worth visiting anyway.
They tend to be corporate sites, put together by paranoid webmasters
who think that unless their web site has all the bells and whistles,
no-one will take their company seriously.

There is a program which will convert TrueType fonts to Compugraphic
fonts. It was on an AF coverdisk a couple of years ago but I can't
remember what it's called. I have used it to convert True Type fonts
in the past and it seems to work fine.

 I installed the ttflib archive from aminet, and installed a couple of fonts 
using the ttf-manager. But I can't remember if I done anything after that but 
they do work on my system. Maybe you need to run intellifont as well, but I'm 
not sure.

 What programs are you using, do they work with standard compugraphic fonts?

Available on Aminet set 7. Thanks. It needs to have it's description modified 
on aminet if it wants to get some exposure. I used mp3 mpg, and mpeg and it 
doesn't show under any of those searches. I have no idea what the above 
searches will result on aminet maybe it has been changed.
 
Since it did come out new on 7D, I'd suspect the author may be scratching his 
head as to why it's not getting any use..

Actually I found reference to it on set 5 and set 6 using the songplay search 
option.

X-SLUIDL: 015702EE-D58F11D2-BCB60060-974BE5E3

From: BOURMAULT Philippe <BOURMAPH@e-i.com>


Hi,

I have some problems using Shapeshifter,
it works fine but I'm not able to read Mac floppy disks.

Before, I had a DD internal floppy, and it doesn't work with DD disks.
Now, I have a HD internal floppy, and it doesn't work either with DD disks
nor with HD disks.

Could someone help me ?
Is there a special way to configure Shapeshifter in order to recognize Mac
floppy disks ?

Thanks.

Flip

    One thing you didn't say was if it worked allright on your system.
Also because of what you said about the author, I decided to read the
guide and sure enough this is giftware and I have not sent him anything
for this fine player. ;-( Thanks for making me realize I had not done
my duty .

The fact that you can see the font in ttfmanager (assuming that
is in the preview) shows the library itself is installed correctly.

Did you save (install) to part of your FONTS: assignment? By default
this is sys:fonts. You can install to any drawer, even if it isn't
on the fonts: path, but the drawer needs to be part of the fonts:
assign for most purposes.

Are the truetype outlines still available? Unlike Intellifont,
ttfmanager references the outlines where they are when you install
and does not copy them anywhere.

If neither of these help, let me know. I can assure you that they
really do work!

I hit delete instead of reply. so this is meant for one, but didn't catch his
name or email addy.

re: songplay, I had 2 mp3 talk files. This songplay thing is great on an A3k.
It also has more sound formats than anything else I've run across.


And like I said earlier, sound isn't a high priority for me with the ami, so
this is most likely a one shot deal for me.
I was just curious what these mp3's had to say.

Don't kill me, but it seems that I wasn't aware of the correct task of
TTF-Manager.
I thought it would make the fonts usable for ALL programs, not only for
compugraphic compatible fonts.
So everything works correct...
Sorry for my BIG mistake...

How is that realized, that diskfont.lib calls ttf.library without a patch
(maybe this is just another annoying question of mine...)

I did that (checking for caches) and updated these.
Now it works sometimes.
Look at the system font-preferences. There are three different fonts to
choose. It's interesting but I can only choose all fonts at the third font
requester. At the first two ones, there are many font missing in the list. 
Perhaps you know why ????

 If your programs only work with standard fonts then you need to use 
intellifont to create bitmaps for the tt fonts in the sizes you want to use.

You should not need to use Intellifont to make anything work in
ttf.library. ttfmanager takes care of installation, creating the
.font and .otag files that form the interface between programs
and the font engine.

The TT fonts should work with any program, as the diskfont.library
handles calling ttf.library, and creating 'normal' fonts in memory
as needed. No special awareness of the source of the font is needed
for most applications.

Another thing to check, if you are still having troubles, are you
running any sort of font cache, i.e. any patches to speed up the
system font list? Such caches may need to be refreshed to recognize
new fonts in the system, TT's included.

Subject: [just-amiga] Looking for a3k in pieces
X-SLUIDL: F02E0ABE-D88F11D2-BCB60060-974BE5E3

From: cbminfo <cbminfo@digital.net>

I'd say this one of mine has seen better days. I'm under the imoression, from
all the hat, and the smell of cooking chips, plus the fact that it won't allow
more than 1 scsi 100 meg drive, and the pioneer cd on it, and hdtools can't
even find any scsi devices at the moment that it's most definitely something
serious about to fry.

Since before it went this far, it ate a 1.3 gig HD, I suspect it may be the
controller. It was creating bad sectors daily on that drive.

So for starters I'd like to know if anyone has an old a3k in pieces they may
want to part out..

Huh ????  - Say what ..... ?  

Just get  'MPEGA'   &   'MPEGA-GUI'    from aminet, it will play MP3's 
real peachey....

I just hope you have at least an 030/40   if not, you will have to crank
the maximum frequency settings down a bit, around 22Khz...  

You might have to kick it into mono too....   try it & see, it's free !!!
To have an 040 or better would be better...

The .font file for an outline font has an identifier at the start
that indicates that is should have more information in a .otag
file. The .otag file, among other things, indicates what engine
library is required to use it. With the standard CG fonts that come
with AmigaOS, that library is 'bullet', while those installed for
use with ttf.library contain 'ttf'. Diskfont, or any other outline
font aware program, knows how to use this name to open the correct
library, and how to load the .otag file contents into memory and
pass it to that library to access the correct font. (The name otag
actually is a shorthand of Outline Tag list, tag lists being the
system way of passing multiple parameters to functions, and outline
indicates that these parameters relate to the outline font engine
specification.) In effect, the 'patch' was already built in, as it
was designed to be extensible. (good question, long answer...)

In the font preferences, the System Default Text choice requires a
fixed width font (where all the characters are the same width.) Only
fonts that have that characteristic will be shown in the list. (BTW,
yes, monospaced truetypes are available, but they're comparatively
rare.) The other items (Icon and Screen text) should show all the
fonts installed.

Hope this clears things up a bit,

 Hey dudes, the amiga is better than a mac! Better than the PC too, but
that's all my university has unfortunatly. So the solution is to make it as
amiga like as possible on my account. Unfortunatly I don't know all that
much about how to do that or how far I can take it. I do of course want to
take it as far toward amiganess as possible.

I've managed to load my amiga wb screen as a background picture, and this
computer seems friendlyer already.

 I want to have bigger icons, bigger texts and shortcuts. Shortcuts can't
be hard, I should be able to find that out. Oh, and I want the mouse
pointer bigger too!

  This and any other amigerizations would be greatly appreciated!


Cool Enough, TTFN!

Hi

as far as I know Yam is a multi user email prog, well, how can I add a
new user?

I'm using Yam 2.0p6, but some of the features described in the guide
(add user, delete user, ...) are not in the Settings/users menu

did anyone suceed in adding users ?

Ciao!

I dunno if you where on the list about 5 weeks ago but I did
ask the list what questions to ask him and people replied, the
questions that the people on the list asked where the ones that
I asked him. So yes *YOU* the readers got to ask.

With a texteditor like CygnusEd or GoldEd or Ed or what you want, load
the file .users.
Now, in the 4th line, change the number (7 or 4, I don't remember now)
with 0.
Now if you restart YAM, you can add users without problems.

From: Rob Hutchinson <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello,

   I know there has been some talk of taglines in YAM not working.
So I wrote a Sig-Tagger specifically for YAM2P6 users...
Which should be p*ss easy to use :) 
If anyone is interested, check out AmiNet, comm/mail/TMS.lha
Or our website: http://www.satanicdreams.freeserve.co.uk/
(But it wont be on there for a week or so.), if all else fails, contact me
privatly and I`ll send it to you..
There are probably tonnes of these taggers about already, but TMS is
cool! Supports tagging specific lines of your sig, and Prefixing
(So you can have <tsb> or <sb> infront of the tagline :) )... all you need
then is a .taglines file :), of which there are tonnes on AmiNet :)

Cya!

Hi Everybody,

   You can change the look, but they'll still feel different to amiga OS.

   With Windows you can do that easily, just press right mouse button on the
desktop and select properties. 

>  This and any other amigerizations would be greatly appreciated!

    If its a PC then there is an archive on aminet (i think) that contains
amiga style icons etc. If its a PC (with windows9x?) then short cuts are
easy too. Hold right mouse button on a file and select 'create shortcut'.

   If its a mac, then I have no idea I'm afraid. 

See ya.

Its probably an attempt at an April Fools, but April Fool jokes are supposed
to be remotely beliveable.


   PS. It also says "ring 01225 822744 for more info about it."
      I dare someone to ring that number (you won't catch me ringing it!)

I just went through this, although I don't know that I know enough to
explain it to you.  If you want to be able to start Yam and have access to
mail for different users then you need to have them listed as users.  You
will need to delete your .users file so that when you select users from the
settings menu, the add gadget appears.  Then add the different users you
want.  After that you can use the menu Folder -> Check single account item
to read a particular users mail.

But if you want to have each user set up to have his own set of folders,
then you will need to add them using configurations -> tcp/ip.  Click on new
and enter the needed info.  When Yam starts it will display a list of all
the users and you have to click on which one you want to start.  

I hope this helps a little.  If you need more help I don't mind trying but
have you considered asking on the Yam mailing list?  That's where I got the
answers.  They were very helpful.

X-SLUIDL: F02E1377-D88F11D2-BCB60060-974BE5E3

From: Rob Hutchinson <loki@napalmdeath.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello,

  Does anybody know anything more about X-Stream? And using the service
with the miggy? If you have no idea what I`m talking about, visit:
http://www.x-stream.com/

Basically, in March, on Weekends, they are offering 100% free internet
access, with 0800 numbers. There are catches..

 o You get disconnected after an hour (I think).
 o You have to use MSN-IE
 o You get crappy adverts at the top of your Win screen.

Well, being a Miggy-only owner. I can`t use this service <sob>...
We might be able to if someone can figure out what the user-names are,
the number to call, etc,. (Cos you can create an account from the above
site, but after you finished, you have to have IE3+ installed to contine.)

Is this the start of something big in the UK?,.. I always thought that they
would start 0800 number internet access in the UK sooner or later,
I just hope that everone else follows.. (And they will if it becomes
finacially benifical for them :) )

BTW - Has anyone else noticed how crap Freeserve have become lately?

Cya!

They have become worse, but they are still better than they used to be. Of

I just rang it to, you get to leave Amiga Format a message, if you
ring it on : *01225 822744*  in the UK or *+44 1225 822744* outside the
UK then say,

"Hey i've got some news, Amiga Information Online has just bought
out Amiga Format............ ha ha ha... aren't we so funny... AIO is
complete Amiga mag domination!"

Ok maybe thats a little over the top but i'm off to say it any how,
maybe it'd be good if someone else did :) why not message the list
with things you said to it..

From: cbminfo <cbminfo@digital.net>

I once had something up and running for pdf files, either ghostscript or xpdf.
I almost had xpdf up yesterday, it seems to be the one with the best chance of
doing anything. Only trouble is it needs a stack of >=20000. And the default
stack is nowhere near that. I tried creating a project icon with stack 21000
and default tool as xpdf, but this did nothing..

And I'm pretty sure this is what I used. I also seem to recall being able to
use xpdf or gs with aweb.. Has anyone else used a pdf viwer on their amiga
(SUCCESSFULLY) Heck I did, but the docs just don't say how to set things up.. 
And I can't recall how I did it last time.

I tried adding stack >NIL: 21000, this did diddly. And the amiga manuals I got
with 3.1 from softhut don't say anything about how to permanently change stack
or at least pass it to something like spdf.

Get the XPDF stuff from aminet & then stick this attachment in 
your S: directory & set the +s bit with the protect command.

When you want to view one,  just pop a shell & type:   
   ViewPDF      or      ViewPDF <file>


If you dont have the stuff in the same place just modify the script.

Will do. You know whats odd here, I did have xpdf up and running ages, and I 
didn't have near this much to go thru. Actually I think all I did was pulled 
down the Amiga E CLI command box and typed pdf. Then I had pdf fire up, and 
then just used the open pulldown inside xpdf.

Thats why I wrote here, Using the open inside xpdf did nothing the other day.

I tried to get online with X-Stream when they first started out.  I never
could, even with Miami, as they have a custom dialer.  Infact, they've even
started encrypting the phone numbers in their software!

Possibly the only way to figure out what's going on would be to have a machine
snoop the serial line to the modem on a Windows machine while it's connecting. 
I could probably write a dialer to get AmiTCP or Miami working if I had that
data... Could anyone get that data?

 RH> Is this the start of something big in the UK?,.. I always thought that

X-Stream is the only free provider which makes it's money from advertising. 
Most of the rest take a cut of the standard call charge.  I don't think it's
too likely any others will follow :-(

ERm,... mine STILL dont work!!, was the VERY first thing that I checked,
and my YAM2P7 STILL spews the whole tagline file out over the sig :(((

Which is cool, cos that means I cant be the only one having difficulties,
which means TMS might still be of some use :),.... Not that it matters
cos I put it together in about an hour anyways :)

Chow!.

You don`t get disconnected after an hour.... I think it`s just the fact that
X-Stream gets so overloaded that it ends up dropping carrier on you now and
again... I`ve been using it this weekend and if you do get a connect (half
the UK must be on this ISP!!!!!) it`s very slow anyway.

>Is this the start of something big in the UK?,.. I always thought that they
>would start 0800 number internet access in the UK sooner or later,


I doubt it..... surely they can`t be making any money out of it... even with
adverts!

>BTW - Has anyone else noticed how crap Freeserve have become lately?


Talking of Freeserve I heard somewhere that in terms of profits they will
just break even in about a year`s time!!

C yA!

Hi Chris,

Well, I heard that you're looking for a website (www.aio.com?) so I thoug=
ht
I'd write to you.

How much webspace do you need?

Depending on how much you need I'm prepared to offer you your own website=
 to
be hosted own my own commercial space.

I have the highest performance/quality space available and at =A3300 a ye=
ar
for the space alone it should be!!!


Of course it comes with full SSI/CGI and secure servers so all your web
needs are catered for. (I've a number of custom scripts written including
guestbooks, counters, download counters etc.).

Basically I can give you your own website with full ftp access (i.e. you
would have the only username and password - it's a proper website).

I've got some extra space going and you seem to be a worthy candidate.

I'm not asking for any money, all you have to do is pay the bills specifi=
c
to your site to the provider Wirenet/U-net.

These are: $70 for domain registration for two years ($35 every year
thereafter, payable to internic - you have to pay for this no matter what
website you're getting).

=A360 for one year's web-forwarding (the process used by the ISP to make =
sure
that "www.aio.com" always brings people to the correct DNS address.)

And optionally =A360 for a year for email-forwarding (So you could have y=
our
own email addresses e.g. info@aio.com etc.), although this isn't really
something you need if you want to keep thoings cheap.

So if you just get the website it'll be less than a hundred quid for the
best performance webspace you can get (I doubt that you could get your ow=
n
webspace with scripts/ssi etc. for the =A3180 you were looking for).  The
only other possible cost is for the email you want it.

I can have my ISP set this up within a few weeks if you want to and you c=
an
pay them later (so you could start using it ASAP!).

I hope you like this email I've written to you, I know that this offer is
useful to you!! ;)))

All the best...

Since the HD crash, I've been trying to restore everything. But I just can not

Has the U.S. Site gone out of business ?

The main "wuarchive.wustl.edu" has been down for ages, since March 6th
IIRC. Its currently being restored from tape but 112gb takes a long
while. However, the mirror site "ftp.sunset.se" was still up and running at
2am GMT this morning and was fairly fast too.

Thanks for the tip but it didn't seem to make any difference, I
tried both Ram and file but neither seemed to work, now if i could
just stop the modem resetting an make it grab the DNS servers and
IP it'd work :)

Absolutely! Too bad it's rare these days in Sweden. About Sunet, it seems
that "recent" doesn't work but the archive is still there.

I have problems with my Motorola V3400 28K8 modem. The modem doesn't connect
on some providers. I've heard that this is a problem with this modem but no
solution has arrived yet. Anyone with the same problem? Or if someone have
some tips & trix?

Hi all

I don't use taglines in YAM, but thanks for mentioning P7 on this
thread, or I wouldn't have known that it's been released (Aminet's
"new/recent" stuff isn't working...)

You can check if there is a new version of YAM quickly by going into the PROJECT menu and then click on CHECK VERSION whilst on line. This takes about 5 seconds. 

Alternatively you can visit www.yam.ch

BTW I think preview 7 is much faster !

You should, but it didn't work for me. I was only, did the update thing and
it said I had the latest version, then I went to the site and downloaded
the latest version. Unless it works with the aminet??

Hi y'all

Which Web browser do you all use on your Amigas, and why?  I currently
use Voyager, but am getting sick of its habit of crashing (with
fireworks) every time it runs out of chip RAM.  I'm therefore
considering a switch to IBrowse or AWeb.  I'd like your opinions on
the strengths and weaknesses of all three Amiga browsers.  None of
the "Browser foo sucks, use browser bar or you're an idiot" type
rubbish; _informed_ opinions only please...

TIA

-Stephen

It's also good for reading plain text documents with.  Better than
Multiview, actually, because it can search.  text.datatype can't
(though there is a patch on Aminet to add this functionality).

I use Ibrowse as well. It is the best looking amiga browser by far. The
reason I don't use Aweb is because it doesn't look as nice. But there
are some people who could care less about graphics and for them aweb
would work great. Ibrowse has some problems when it runs out of chip ram.
It is fairly stable although there is certainly room for improvement. I
would be happy if version 2 is ever released.

Hi Everybody,

> Which Web browser do you all use on your Amigas, and why?  I currently

   I use IBrowse. It seems to be reliable enough and has lots of features. I
can't get SSL to work with it though.

See ya.

I use IBrowse with a Picasso IV but if you are using without a gfx card
it can be set to use fast ram for the images to conserve chip ram.
Maybe that will help you. You still need chip ram to display them but I
think it caches them in fast ram when you leave the site, so you won't
have to reload them if you go back.

OK, firstly, I use ibrowse on an AGA hires laced 8 plane screen.
I have one of those Apollo flicker fixers/scan doublers that allow me to
use a VGA monitor on my miggy without having to stuff around..
but still, i have the biggest & most hungry screen modes AGA can do...

I NEVER run out of chip mem on the browser (1 or 2 windows open)
since v1.2xx  when he added the images in fastmem switch.   
(Preferences->Network->Cache.) 

Even with StrICQ & YAM going too, each on their own 4 plane screens 
I still have over 700k left.

Also, my SSL libraries work fine,  just follow the installation 
directions & read the "ReadMe First"  if any....

Just remember, _EVERYTHING has a price_, if you open everything up in
256 colors & hires laced screens & have huge pictures on deep workbench
screens, you WILL have problems.....

I think both Ibrowse and Aweb has advantages compared to eathother. If you
want Javascript and no MUI you should use Aweb. None of these 2 browsers
crash often (for me that is). I personally like Voyager for 1 reason: it
show colors better than the other 2. In AGA modes that is.

 Not necessarily, it cuts off lines at 80 characters, but its better than using 
Notepad or whatever, as that doesn't register carridge returns as new lines.

I use IBrowse. I like the way it renders most pages (although it's got some
pretty lame table rendering bugs). Although it's HTML support isn't quite up
to the level of AWeb and it's got no JavaScript support, I've found it
renders pages nicer, and it's rock stable - even more so on a GFX card.

AWeb seems quite a decent browser - the best HTML support of the 3 browsers,
pretty fast, JavaScript support etc etc, but it uses Class Act (noooo! come
back MUI, all is forgiven! :) and the rendering engine is a bit ugly.

Tom

If I get some cash together that top one might be changing rather soon... ;)

Hmmm, anyone feel like dumping a few £50 notes in my bank account? :)

Well, actually, I have some cash (just... but never mind, eating's for wimps
;), I'm just trying to weigh up the advantages of a CGI bin directory and a
domain name (http://www.amisite.org/ methinks - I'm not a company :) against
loosing 1/3rd of my savings...

Would anyone be interested in a site like SlashDot (http://slashdot.org/)
for the Amiga? :)

Hi Everybody,

   Two things:

1. IBrowse shouldn't run out of chip ram because it uses fast ram to store
images.

2. AWeb has Javascript? Why is this the first I've heard of it? (does the
demo have it? I'll go and check it out now!)


See ya.

As far as I know when you do this it checks the site directly, so I don't know why it didn't work.
The only thing I canthink of is that you downloaded the latest version just as the web site was being updated otherwise I haven't got a clue !

Here the internal SSL support of IBrowse works lovely.
But you can use also the SSL support of Miami, if you are a registered user.

   Well, it doesn't have full java script support does it? its just that I
couldn't get any online java games etc. to work.

   In fact the only piece of java I did manage to get working is the buttons
on ID softwares website. 

Oh well, we'll just have to wait for AMozilla (or IBrowse 2?) for propper
JavaScript.


See ya.

well, you talk about java.. there is a difference between java and
javascript.. but i suppose you already know that. aweb does not support
java. only javascript. but you might be right about java script support in
the demo version. don't know if there's any difference between the demo and
the full version. i only know that the javascript sites i have visited
works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I may have an explanation,  I had someone a while back, having a 
similar problem with running out of chip mem.

As it turns out, the poor fellow actually had his WB screen in full 
8 plane screenmode.  ( & only had 1 meg chip mem )

When I asked him why he had it so deep for just the gui, 
he responded with:  /I need to have the pictures look right./
but there were no pictures on the WB screen ???
He was using Viewtek (which has its own screen)  to view pictures...

As I didn't make the connection with this logic, I enquired further....
Then I got it.....

He actually believed that unless he set his WB screen to MAX-EVERYTHING,
he wouldn't be able to attain any better resolution from any other
program that opened afterwards.

To the initiated, I know it sounds stupid, 
but this has happened more than once since then. 

Any suggestions how they get this idea, I don't........

Click once on Icon and go to FILE then MAKE ALIAS

-or, the faster way-

Hold CTRL and single click, a pop up menu appears and select MAKE ALIAS.

-or, a nice enhancement for such things-

Get and Install FinderPop (PPC required). You can now click and hold for a
pop up menu that shows tasks, free mem, instantly move that file anywhere
and a whole lot more.


Bah, why want to change a PC or a Mac to be *like* Amiga. That's the appeal
to different platforms .. their own uniqueness and feel. Just spend some
serious time learning that other OS and you'll find a lot of cool things. I
have a few Macs and I love them but you can guess which of my dozen or so
computers gets the most use ... Amiga - It just "feels" right. =)

First trick. add three commas at end of phone number. You usually only need
this if you are dialing into a 56k number and you have a 33.6k or slower.
Reason: 56k modems omit initial beep that will throw off non-56k modems
resulting in connection failure. Three to five commas will tell your modem
to bypass [wait until after] this beep and connect normally.

Next, I'd try init strings. I usually refer to Mr.Modem. Sorry, I don't
have the URL handy. It's bookmarked at work.. hmm wait, I can look on the
staff site.. here we go. http://www.spy.net/~dustin/modem

Yes and yes. However, it seems to CRAWL. Anything using JS takes an
