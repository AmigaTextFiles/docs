INTRODUCTION

	By popular demand, here is a collection of humorous articles about
the Commodore Amiga that I wrote and posted in the USENET newsgroups
comp.sys.amiga and comp.sys.amiga.advocacy between 1990 and 1992.  I
hope you enjoy them!

	The articles in the "b" subdirectory are about BLAZEMONGER, the
fastest and most amazing computer game ever created.  Some of these articles
were published in Amiga User International (AUI) Magazine [May & June 1992].
However, the magazine typeset them very poorly, creating many errors and
omissions.  These are the original articles as they appeared on USENET.

	The file README.HISTORY explains what was happening on USENET
when BLAZEMONGER was first discussed.

	The articles in the "j" ("joke") subdirectory are about other
important Amiga topics that were discussed on USENET. :-)

	Have fun... and BLAZE ON, DOODZ!!


*** WARNING ***

	spikes at your grandmother.  The author refuses to take any
	responsibility for this strange behavior, and advises you to see a
	competent therapist before proceeding.  Read them at your own risk.
	If you can't do that, then read them at somebody else's risk.
