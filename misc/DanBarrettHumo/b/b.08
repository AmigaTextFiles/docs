Now that THAT is all out of the way... time for the R.T.F.M. History!!


Part I:  BEFORE BLAZEMONGER

	Once, there was a TERRIBLE time in Amiga history.  The games
	sucked.  They were SLOW, STUPID, BORING, USELESS, and NOT AT ALL FUN.
	Totally WIMPY games like "Shadow of the Cheese" dominated the
	market.  These games were written by INEPT PROGRAMMERS who didn't
	know the difference between a HARDWARE REGISTER and an EXPONENTIAL
	ALGORITHM.  They couldn't tell an OUTPUT from a SHOT PUT.  The most
	COMMON PROGRAM these people ran was a GURU MEDITATION.  Believe me,
	it was PATHETIC.

	Well, about this time, a group of three Florida doctors had a spare
	$7 million to invest, so they decided to build the ultimate game
	computer.  They... uh... wait a minute.  Wrong history.

	So, about THIS time, a group of ULTIMATE PROGRAMMERS decided that
	ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH.  It was time to write the GAME TO END ALL GAMES.
	(Literally!  In fact, the original plans called for the game to seek
	out and DESTROY any WIMPY games owned by the user!  But for better
	or worse, this was dropped from the specification when we realized
	that, to have the best game, you also have to have other games around
	that are WORSE.)

	And so, our BRILLIANT PLANNERS and AMAZING CODERS started work
	on the program.  It was a well-kept SECRET.  NOBODY was allowed
	to refer to it by its actual name, so they used CODE NAMES.  These
	names were SO SECRET and SO WELL ENCRYPTED that nobody, not even
	the people involved, could crack them.  So they just tossed out
	the code names and used the real one.

	But what was the real name?  What should the ULTIMATE GAME be
	called?  Well, the original name chosen was, believe it or not,
	"Wonk", which is the sound of the user "wonking" a monster on
	the head.  But this name was soon scrapped because it sounded too
	similar to "Turrican", a VERY WIMPY game.

	Next, the designers tried the name "Kill Kill Kill" which pleased
	most everyone, but it STILL sounded too much like "Turrican".  But
	this name was one step closer to a good one, because it had almost
	enough VIOLENCE in it.

	Finally, in a sudden BURST OF BRILLIANCE, ALL of the people involved
	SUDDENLY thought of the SAME NAME SIMULTANEOUSLY!  It was a MAGICAL
	experience!  Everybody was STUNNED!  Yes!!  The game was going to be
	called... called... "Little Princess Petunia and her Cute, Fluffy
	Doggie"!!  How they CHEERED the decision!!  Everybody felt GREAT.

	Then somebody noticed that the building's air vents were all shut,
	and truck exhaust fumes had been filtering into the building for
	the past 2 hours.  So everybody went outside, took a few deep
	breaths, and decided on "BLAZEMONGER."

	BLAZEMONGER:  a name that would strike TERROR into the hearts and
	text editors of those INCOMPETENT WANNA-BE BASIC PROGRAMMERS at
	Psychosis, Innerprune, Bitmap Buffoons, Electronic Artichokes,
	Seagate, and other TOY MANUFACTURERS.  Yes, BLAZEMONGER:  who could
	change the course of mighty GAME SALES... bend RKM RULES in its BARE
	HANDS...  and who, disguised as... uh... never mind.

Part II:  B.M. Hits The Beta-Testers

	After a careful selection process, 6 BRAVE beta-testers were chosen
	to try out the game.  We watched carefully, from behind our concrete
	bunker, to see what would happen.  Up to this point, nobody had
	actually tried to play the game.

	The first beta-tester picked up the BLAZEMONGER game disk and
	prepared to insert it into the computer.  We were all VERY pleased
	when, as his hand was approaching the drive, the words "GAME OVER"
	began flashing on the monitor.

	It was a success!!  BLAZEMONGER was the FASTEST GAME EVER WRITTEN.
	(We sent the rest of the beta-testers home.  Dweebs.)

Part III:  Disaster In The Stores

	The first shipment of BLAZEMONGER packages was sent to the stores.
	It was shaped like a PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE wrapped around a LIT STICK
	of DYNAMITE.  This naturally frightened some of the MEEK and WIMPY
	store owners.  But we had expected that this might happen, so we
	did the appropriate thing:  we sent a few of our "support people"
	to each store, and they beat the hell out of the store owners
	with blunt instruments.  BLAZEMONGER sales improved rapidly.

	But it wasn't enough.  Weedy little jerkoff kids started PIRATING
	the game.  In our first release, you see, we had decided not to use
	any form of disk-based copy protection.  This was not a problem,
	however, as one of our programmers had lovingly coated the original
	disks with BUBONIC PLAGUE VIRUS, which was passed on to the illegal
	copies.  However, the original PACKAGING was coated with Bubonic
	Plague ANTIDOTE.  You get the picture?  Anyway, that took care of
	the piracy problem rather quickly.

	Finally, BLAZEMONGER sales were hurt by a nasty rumor that started
	floating around on BBS's and USENET.  Somebody claimed that, after
	you turned off your computer, BLAZEMONGER would hide in the
	battery-backed RAM of the internal clock.  This was a VICIOUS LIE!!
	BLAZEMONGER doesn't NEED any WIMPY batteries!!!  If it wanted to, it
	could hide in your MOUSE!!  Or even in the GRIMY DIRT on your RETURN
	KEY!!!  God, don't you ever WASH that thing?!?  Makes me sick.

Part IV.  BLAZEMONGER TRIUMPHANT

	Nowadays, absolutely EVERYBODY admits that BLAZEMONGER is the
	ULTIMATE GAME that plays FASTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE.  Even though the
	original game had NO BUGS, we decided to add LOTS OF FEATURES (the
	feature not to blow up the monitor, the feature not to electrocute
	the user, etc.), resulting in BLAZEMONGER III, BLAZEMONGER IV, and so
	on.  (There was no BLAZEMONGER II, as it was so BLINDINGLY FAST that
	it LEAPED out of the computer and up into the STRATOSPHERE before we
	could play it.)


	So there you have it:  the REAL TRUE FACTUAL MAGNIFICENT HISTORY
of BLAZEMONGER... straight from the SOURCE.  If you have any questions,
we can send some of our "support people" around to straighten you out.
