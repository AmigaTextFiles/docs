Summary: BLAZEMONGER strikes again
Date: 15 Jun 92 21:37:32 GMT

In article something-or-other, everybody and their mothers-in-law write:
>[Emplant does exist, Emplant can't exist, Emplant sucks, Emplant bites,
>Emplant bites shortly before it sucks, etc.]

	BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is proud to pre-announce the eventual
availability of its latest product-to-be...

			BLAZEPLANT

the ULTIMATE emulator of EVERYTHING EVER KNOWN to human beings.

	BLAZEPLANT will be available at exactly 7:42 am on December 28,
1997.  Until that time, we would like to request that everybody in
c.s.a.eggplant please post AS MANY CRITICISMS AS POSSIBLE about BLAZEPLANT.
Feel free to FLAME its concept, authors, documentation, price, and even the
coding style.  Please tell us that the product is impossible, infeasible,
and may cause rare, tropical foot diseases.

	Since the product isn't out yet (heck, we haven't even written the
specification yet), your criticisms will be INVALUABLE in helping us to
identify and wipe out certain dweebs in this newsgroup who don't know when
to shut up.

	This has been a pubic service.  Thank you very much.

                                                        Dan
