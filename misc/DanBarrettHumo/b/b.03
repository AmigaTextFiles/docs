	The next version will have an even MORE SOPHISTICATED algorithm; you
don't even have to OWN an Amiga to lose the game!!  BLAZEMONGER periodically
checks your bank account.  When it senses that you have enough money to BUY
an Amiga, it projects a big, flashing "GAME OVER" message on your wall.

	This RUMOR is a VICIOUS LIE.  It is a thirty-*three* digit code.
