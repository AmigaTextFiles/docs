	In recent articles, people have asked Commodore to release the
source code of the operating system.  Since Commodore has decided not to
do this, I thought it would get the ball rolling by releasing the source
code to BLAZEMONGER.

	As you are well aware, BLAZEMONGER is the fastest program ever
written.  On the average, it is finished running just slightly before you
reach for your joystick.  (Don't worry... it's usually faster in practice.)

	We figured that the source code would prove instructive to young
hardware-bangers eager for MAXIMUM SPEED, but still not sure how to get it.
(Hint:  you're doing it WRONG.)  And next, who knows:  perhaps other
companies will release THEIR source code too!  Then we can all laugh and see
how STUPID it is compared to BLAZEMONGER's ultimate form.

	Aren't we worried about BLAZEMONGER clones being written now, as
EVIL, WIMPY companies steal our source code and incorporate it into their
own games?  GET REAL!!!  We fear NOTHING!!  In fact, if anybody tries to use
even ONE BYTE of BLAZEMONGER code in their programs, even modified beyond
recognition, we will know.  Trust us, we'll know.  You don't want to do this.
It will be very bad for your, uh, health.  So much for the "legal-ese"
portion of our posting.

	So, without further ado, here it is:  the SOURCE CODE FOR
BLAZEMONGER, THE FASTEST PROGRAM EVER WRITTEN!!  It is in uuencoded 
format.  Simply save it in a file and type "uudecode filename" to
decode it.

begin 644 BLAZEMONGER.X
end

	Enjoy!!
