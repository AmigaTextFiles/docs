FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


	   BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED TO CEASE SELLING POPULAR GAME

WEST CHESTER, Pa.  -- February 10, 1992 -- BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED,
authors of the popular "ViolentWare" software series, announced
yesterday that they were taking their top-selling product, BLAZEMONGER,
off the market.

"We have just ended some successful negotiations with Commodore," said Dan
Barrett, official B.Inc. spokescreature, "and afterwards decided to pull
BLAZEMONGER from production.  I cannot give any more details without
violating a non-disclosure agreement, but I will say that we are very happy."

The latest meeting between BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED and Commodore Business
Machines capped off months of speculation about a possible collaborative
effort between the two computer giants.  Commodore, maker of the popular
Amiga microcomputer, has been in need of improved graphics technology.
BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is best known for the stunning graphics and sound
in its products.  Could there be a connection?

"I seriously doubt it," said top market analyst Mirk Birritt.  "I predicted
over five hundred years ago that Blazemonger [sic] and Commodore would try to
team up, but it's hopeless.  Commodore will never be anything more than a
little speck of slime on the bottom of my business school diploma."

On the other hand, some advocates have other views.  "I think this is a
wise move," said one source named Dave who asked not to be identified.
"After all, when the copper hits the VBL, hundreds of MMU cycles can be
gated without adding bus contention to the whiffle."  Key spokespeople
from Apple, IBM, and NeXT were quick to deny the charges.

Regardless, rumors are still flying.  Once source claimed that Commodore is
licensing the as-yet-unheard-of BLAZEMONGER Advanced Chip Set.  Another
source reported that B.Inc. plans to market a "standalone" BLAZEMONGER box
with an Amiga inside.  A third source claimed to know that the two
companies are collaborating on a new computer called the BlaZinga.  "It will
have forty-thousand bits per pixel," he said, "and an infrared mouse with
eighty buttons."

Perhaps the mostly likely case is that Commodore is working on its own entry
in the "ViolentWare" series.  "It will be called GOULDMONGER," said one
insider, who refused to give any further details, except to promise that it
will be "everything that the Amiga advocates would expect in a game of this
name."  Further research indicates that the game is supposedly being written
by disgruntled employees at Commodore.

Even with the promise of new technology on the horizon, some BLAZEMONGER
owners are outraged.  "I can't BELIEVE they are abandoning us!" said an
angry Baird Macintoosh.  "I mean, they are even closing down their
'900-number' hint line!  Don't they realize that some of us need those hints
on a daily basis??  This is terrible... I'm going to have to switch to a
different game now, like 'Eye of the Potholder'."

What will happen next?  Only time will tell.  But sources say to watch
USENET carefully for future product announcements.

                                                        Dan
