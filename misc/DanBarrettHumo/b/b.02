>at once?

	BLAZEMONGER can indeed be played by nine people at once.
Fortunately, this WIMPY LIMIT has been overcome in the soon-to-appear
"BLAZEMONGER II:  THE FINAL BEGINNING".  This sequel allows FOUR HUNDRED
simultaneous players, provided you have enough bathrooms.

>Where can I get it? I haven't seen it advertised in any magazines!

	BLAZEMONGER is not advertised in any of your WORTHLESS magazines.
Real gameplayers KNOW where to get it.

>:) I didn't know the audio ports can be INPUTS!

	They are, if you feed back enough VOLTS into 'em!!  The authors of
BLAZEMONGER are the ULTIMATE PROGRAMMERS.  They can get around ANY such
trivial details.  (In fact, they are now working on BLAZEMONGER hard-disk
installation for people who do not own hard disks.)
