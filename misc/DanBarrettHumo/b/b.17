	WRONG-O, DWEEB-FACE!!  This shows how LITTLE you know about
BLAZE-PC.  Maybe it's true on all those other, WIMPY PSEUDO-COMPUTERS
that you TAKE TO BED every night, but NOT for the One True Computer,
BLAZE-PC.

	You see, BLAZE-PC uses *exactly* 1,000 bytes per kilobyte.  This is
the way that computers were MEANT to be built.  If GOD had intended
computers to have 1,024 bytes per kilobyte, HE/SHE would have given us
SIXTEEN FINGERS!!  Powers of ten are the ONLY way to go, and in fact account
partly for BLAZE-PC's MIND-BLOWING SPEED.

	And now, for all you other LOSERS who keep asking about BLAZE-PC's
graphics resolution (which we didn't mention), it should be totally OBVIOUS
what the answer is.  NO, it's not 1024x1024 or some other BLAZEPHEMOUS
resolution.  In fact, BLAZE-PC's graphics resolution is 10x10!!  Yes,
ten pixels by ten pixels.  You see, BLAZE-PC is SO POWERFUL that even
with 100 pixels, it BLOWS THE COMPETITION OUT OF THE WATER!!  Each pixel
can have over 100,000 different colors SIMULTANEOUSLY, and can be SIZED
from infinitely small all the way up to cover the entire screen!  These
pixels are SO VERSATILE that it requires only 2 pixels to display the
MONA LISA!!  And it's INDISTINGUISHABLE from the ORIGINAL PAINTING!!!
(In fact, one morning we discovered a dead art thief on the floor by
our computer.  He tried to cut out the painting using a knife, and hit
a capacitor.  Poor Poopsie.)

                                                        Dan
