	First of all, buddy, it's [all together now!] BLAZEMONGER in 
ALL CAPITAL LETTERS!!  "If you don't YELL when you SAY IT, you SUCK
when you PLAY IT!!" (TM)

	Oh, so you think a "smiley face" will get you off the hook, eh?
FORGET IT!!  Let's see what my beta copy of PHASEMONGER III has to say:

	[Click on "Really Not Nice" gadget]

		"Wasting tax money???  HAH!!  If you were any more
		HIPPOCRITICAL then you'd be in a HOSPITAL for LARGE ZOO
		ANIMALS!!  Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what do you think YOU are
		doing when you post your response -- spending tax money
		WISELY????  In fact, what do I think *I* am doing when I
		post MY response??  Um, er, uh... Hmmm....  [PHRASEMONGER
		screen goes blank...]

	[time passes...]

	[Amiga explodes.]

Sigh.  Well, it seems that PHRASEMONGER III still has some bugs.  Anyway,
the point it should have made is that posting lots of BLAZEMONGER
announcements actually SAVES tax money!!  Yes!!  Just ask anyone!!  And if
you want to know HOW to save money yourself, pick up a copy of our new book,
"Tax Backdoors:  How To 'Convince' the I.R.S. of ANYTHING."  It is written,
of course, by our "Customer Service" Department.
