	"BlazeMonoger?"  That sounds like a nose disease.  Disgusting.

>I'm sure Dan will send Customer Service to give you an... update.

	BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED's "Customer Service" department (written in
double quotes for... uh... "legal reasons") is always glad to help out.
Need an update?  For free?  Of any program in the WORLD?  Just call us!  Of
course, we wouldn't DREAM of accusing you of PIRATING the program.  No, we
will be more than happy to provide you with the "services" that you
DESERVE.  Yes, any FREELOADER SCUM who calls us and BEGS or PLEADS for
assistance will be answered SWIFTLY, ACCURATELY, and VIOLENTLY.  In fact,
you might as well just stick your TONGUE into an ELECTRICAL OUTLET RIGHT NOW
and save yourself the cost of the telephone call.

	BLAZEMONGER "Customer Service."

		Available 7 hours a day, 24 days per week.
		Call troll-free:  1-900-EAT-MUCUS

	BLAZEMONGER "Customer Service."

		Even if you never call us, we might beat you up anyway.

	BLAZEMONGER "Customer Service."

		It's not just a job.
		It's a death sentence.

                                                        Dan
