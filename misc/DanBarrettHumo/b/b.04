	BLAZEMONGER III will be ready Real Soon Now.  It features more
graphics, more speed, more sound, more speed, and more SPEED than ever
before.  And did I mention MORE SPEED?  The game is SO FAST that we
weren't even able to *write* "BLAZEMONGER II" -- it leaped off the disk
and into the upper atmosphere before we could catch it!!

	Your Amiga either has a hardware problem, or you are doing something
wrong.  BLAZEMONGER has no bugs.  I'll bet you are a pirate.

	That is a TRIVIAL score.  I have seen TRUE game players get scores
of 5 or even 6 after ONLY a few hours of play.
