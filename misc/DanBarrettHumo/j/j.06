	This discussion of memory protection is very interesting.  Very,
VERY interesting.

	Especially because the Amiga already HAS memory protection.

	Yes, you heard me right.  The Amiga already has memory protection.

	Your programs don't have to crash each other anymore!  No more
gurus!  No more accidents!  In fact, no more frying your 8520's or dropping
heavy weights on top of your monitor!  COMPLETE SAFETY!

	But memory protection doesn't come with the base OS.  You have to
buy it separately.  Just head down to your local dealer and look for the
package marked...

Yes, MafiaDOS, the ULTIMATE in memory protection!  MafiaDOS watches over
all of your running programs and make sure nothing, uh, "happens" to them.
I mean, all kinds of "accidents" could occur.  MafiaDOS keeps your 
programs "safe."
	
	And all you have to do is send in $135/month (U.S.) to the authors.
In return, each month you get the latest version of MafiaDOS which keeps your
programs "protected" for another 30 days.  If you get behind in your
payments, no problem!  We understand.  In fact, we are so understanding that
we'll even send you two ABSOLUTELY FREE programs called "Vito" and "Bruno"
that will "help" you to come up with the money.

	If you enjoy MafiaDOS's memory protection, then you'll be sure to
love its COPY protection feature.  Here's how it works.  Suppose you buy a
copy protected program, but the disk dies after several uses.  Don't panic!
Just insert the MafiaDOS disk in DF0: and the damaged disk in DF1:, and then
turn on your modem.  MafiaDOS will automatically dial up the distributors of
your dead program and "convince" them to send you a free replacement disk.
It's easy, it's fast, and it's painless.  Mostly.

	Finally, MafiaDOS provides complete VIRUS protection.  If you
unwittingly run a program that installs a virus on your disks, MafiaDOS
puts out a "contract" on the virus.  This causes all of your other programs
to hunt down and, uh, "remove" the virus from your computer.  The program
that actually "removes" the virus is rewarded by having its priority bumped
up to 5000.
	Afterwards, MafiaDOS even tracks down the original creators of the
virus and fills their floppy drives with cement.


	Yes, MafiaDOS -- the latest and greatest program from the creators
of BLAZEMONGER XVII.  Don't multitask without it.  Or else.
