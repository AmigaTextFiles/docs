INTRODUCTION
============

	As regular readers of comp.sys.amiga.advocacy know, certain topics
come up for discussion regularly.  This document, assembled by the finest
Amiga minds on this side of Chickenmilk, Wisconsin, explains the answers
clearly and accurately, so people don't have to argue about them anymore.


SECTION I:  Computer Performance
================================

1.  Which is better/faster, 680x0 or 80x86 CPU's?

	Generally, the relative speed of a processor is found in the second
	digit of the model number.  For example, the 68000, 68010, 68020,
	68030, and 68040 all have an "8" as the second digit, so they are
	all roughly the same speed.  Similarly, all the "80x86" processors
	have a "0" as the second digit.  This implies that all 680x0
	processors are faster than their 80x86 counterparts.  But everybody
	knows that anyway.

2.  What does the "x" mean in "680x0"?

	The "x" means "extra fast".  The 680x0 processor, to be released
	sometime in 1993, is the fastest processor ever made by Motorola.

3.  What is a "SPECmark"?

	Every computer has bugs.  Sometimes, one will escape from inside the
	computer case, so you have to catch it and squash it.  The small,
	bloody stain made by the bug's smashed body is called a "SPECmark."
	Generally, SPECmarks can be removed by soaking your computer in
	warm, soapy water.


SECTION II:  Mine is better than yours, nyah nyah!
==================================================

1.  Should I buy an Amiga or a Mac? ...or a NeXT? ...or a PC? ...or a goat?

	Deciding which computer to buy is a very personal issue.  It is
	difficult to get two people to agree on the same brand, let alone
	the same model.

	Our panel of computer experts has come up with a sure-fire,
	failure-proof method for buying the right computer.  Simply follow
	these steps exactly, and we guarantee that you will choose a computer
	with appropriate power and capabilities.

	(1)	Make a list of the software packages you want to run.

	(2)	Examine your finances, and decide how much money you can
		afford to spend.  Suppose this is N dollars (or whatever
		units of currency you prefer).

	(3)	Go to the bank and withdraw N units of currency.

	(4)	Go to your local computer dealer.

	(5)	Wave the N units of currency in a salesperson's face,
		yelling "I can get my computer much cheaper by mail order!"
		Then walk out, looking smug.

	(6)	Go home, and put the money under your mattress, in a box
		marked "Money".

	(7)	Mail me your home address, and tell me which days you will
		be out of town.

	(8)	Later that night, make a human sacrifice to the god M'Bitu
		under the light of a full moon.

	(9)	Stand on one leg, tilt your head upward, and yell
		"Vooshie vooshie vooshie" repeatedly until you get tired.

	(10)	Say the word "SPECmark" to several computer-literate people,
		and then nod knowingly.

	(11)	Ask someone else which computer you should buy.  Better yet,
		crosspost to ten or twelve USENET newsgroups, asking people
		which computer is best.  Remember to write "No flames,
		please" at the bottom of your article, and leave the
		"Followup-To" line blank.

2.  Does the Mac OS suck?

	When the Mac was first introduced, it filled a void in the
	IBM-dominated PC market.  Filling a void is analogous to replacing
	a vacuum, so technically, the Mac does "suck" in that sense.

	There is a problem with this argument, however.  Commodore's
	top-of-the-line Amiga 3000T has a 2-fan ventilation system and
	therefore sucks in a big way.  This means that the "Amiga vs. Mac"
	argument is right back where it started, with the score tied 1 to 1.

	Rather than using this reasoning, it is generally safer just to yell
	"Macs SUCK" and then run away without explaining.

3.  If fast PC clones cost less than an Amiga, why should anyone buy an
    Amiga instead?

	Amiga owners are a strange bunch.  On the one hand, they are
	creative, knowledgable, and friendly.  On the other hand, they
	are a strange bunch.

	Nobody knows exactly why people buy Amigas.  Many famous researchers
	have puzzled over this issue for years, without success.  The
	best-known theory was proposed by Professor Reginald Wanker of Snoot
	State University.  His 415-page paper, entitled "The Phenomenon of
	Amiga Ownership Among the Tree-Chewing Gibbons of Antarctica" says,
	essentially, that Amiga owners are "a strange bunch" with "very long
	tails."

4.  Which is better, Windows or Workbench?

	The consensus on USENET is that one of them is DEFINITELY better than
	the other.  All of the evidence supports this belief, so nobody
	argues about it anymore.


SECTION III:  Commodore
=======================

1.  Who is Irving Gould?

	Irving started out as a simple janitor's assistant and rose to become
	the reigning czar of Commodore Business Machines.  His annual salary
	is reportedly forty-five zillion dollars per hour.  Nowadays, he
	spends most of his time playing with his CDTV and recruiting
	Marketing people in local wineries.

2.  Why doesn't Commodore do XXX?

	Because it's illegal.

3.  Commodore stock just went [up|down]!!  Is this [good|bad]??

	[Yes|No|Maybe].

4.  Why does the Commodore Marketing Department never advertise the Amiga?

	They DO advertise.  Just not to humans.


SECTION IV:  Blatant Commercial Announcement
============================================

	statue of the Grim Reaper being run through a CHEESE GRATER into
	a VAT of BOILING TAR.  Yum!!


SECTION V:  Religious Issues
=============================

1.  Which is better, C or assembly language?

	Both C and assembly have fallen out of style.  Most serious
	programmers nowadays use a new language called "BLORT".
	BLORT lets programmers use whatever combination of languages
	they want, all mixed in the same file.  For example, a typical
	BLORT program for "hello world" looks like:

		MODULE HelloWorld(defun write (x) (SAY #? > /dev/tty))
		{
			.KEY string/a

			while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
			begin
				MOVEM	$r0 0x287BA9
				task body is accept stdout end;
			128	FORMAT "%s\n"
				"hello world" << 128 when not Thursday
		exit 0

	Keeping with the humorous "GNU Software" tradition of recursive
	acronyms, "BLORT" actually stands for "Blort Lort Ort Rt T".

2.  Is copy protection good or bad?

	Most companies nowadays agree that copy protection is bad.  However,
	due to pressure from users who want the benefits that copy
	protection provides, companies have reluctantly added it to their
	products.

	Some companies who don't use copy protection have reported problems
	due to European "cracker" groups.  These groups buy all the
	legitimate copies of the software, add copy protection, and then
	hide the disks in deep, underground vaults so nobody can use them.
	Obviously, this hurts sales -- when ordinary users go to the store,
	they discover that all the software is gone.
