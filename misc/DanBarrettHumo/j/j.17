OVERVIEW OF THE LATEST OS VERSION

	This version shall henceforth be known as "V.00", or "Version zero
zero."  The reason is that it adds thousands of new features and yet
remains 100% compatible all the way back to pre-1.0 release Kickstart.

	"Ah," some of you will complain, "if you are calling THIS release
V.00, what will you call the NEXT release?  Won't your new numbering scheme
conflict with old OS version numbers?"  Don't panic, developers -- we have
this all under control.  To avoid all confusion, future OS releases will be
numbered in Braille.  Touchscreens will be provided.

	"But," you continue to whine, "what will happen to all those
programs that call the OpenLibrary() function with a minimum version number
greater than zero?  Won't those programs fail if the OS version number is
zero?"  Well, this is not Commodore's problem.  We have been telling you
developers for years to stop checking library version numbers!!  It's
documented right in the RKM LIBRARIES manual, page 94,762.  Just assume
that the user has the right version number; if not, then their computer
DESERVES to crash.  It's not our fault if you don't listen.

	Anyway, all this is trivial when you consider the wonderful new
features that V.00 will give you.  Read on!


BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

	Due to requests from heavy users... no, sorry:  HEAVY REQUESTS
from USERS, V.00 will be completely backward compatible in both hardware
and software.  On the hardware side, all peripherals will be designed so
they will work even if plugged in backwards, upside down, or in the wrong
port or slot.  Yes, those naive little end-users with cheese for brains
will be totally safe, even if they plug their new CPU accelerator directly
into an electrical outlet.  [Note that CBM does not necessarily recommend
this practice -- CBM Legal Dept.]

	The software also will be completely backward compatible.  For
example, it will be possible to read and/or delete files before they are
actually created.  A real boon for software developers is the ability to
link and load programs before they are compiled or even written.  In
addition, if the user types a shell command like

		1> erom ecneuqes-putrats:s

the expected action will take place.  (This feature is also known as the
"Aspiks Hack", in honor of Slu Aspiks, the Inventor of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement.)  Finally, Intuition can be told to interchange the meanings of
the MOUSE_UP and MOUSE_DOWN messages for people who accidentally glue their
fingers to the little rodent.


FASTER FILESYSTEM

	The RQFFS (Really Quite Fast File System) is new with version V.00.
Both reads and writes have been sped up by 10-50 times.  In addition,
directory accesses are now instantaneous, even for large directories on
floppy disks on plain 68000 machines.  In order to obtain this incredible
performance boost, we had to make a few compromises, but we think that
nobody will notice.  These minor changes include:

	o	The letter "Q" (ASCII 81) may not appear in any file.
	o	All filenames must be exactly 256 characters long.
	o	Files are limited in size to 512 bytes.

Developers are advised to make their files conform to this new standard
before V.00 is released.


NEW FEATURES OF V.00

	Numerous programs have been enhanced, and others have been added
to the SYS: partition.  Below are brief descriptions of some of the
changes.

C/NewShell

	After years of incorrect behavior, NewShell finally lives up to
	its name.  Every time the user types "NewShell", he/she gets a
	new shell -- literally!!  The first time, it will be the default
	Amiga shell.  The second time, he/she will get an MS-DOS shell.
	The third time will bring up the UNIX Bourne shell.  If the user
	invokes "NewShell" enough times, the Amiga will automatically
	generate new kinds of shells with unique commands and syntax.

C/Rename

	Moved to LIBS: directory.

C/Type

	Now has an ARexx port.

C/Version

	Now simply prints "0" and exits.  [Note:  Current beta release
	crashes the computer.  Randell, please check the OpenLibrary()
	call?]

Prefs/Snort

	Allows one to choose the default smell of the Amiga at boot time. 
	The user may specify any Sensitive Nose Interchange File Format
	(SNIFF) file as input.

Prefs/Weather

	Allows the user to receive weather reports worldwide (thanks to
	locale.library) and modify global weather settings.  WARNING:  due
	to a bug, the temperature gadgets currently go all the way up to
	150 degrees Celsius -- DO NOT set the temperature too high or else
	you might be sorry.

Utilities/Disease

	A new virus-protection program.  If an infected disk is inserted
	into an Amiga disk drive, Disease emits a loud, digitized sneeze
	from the audio outputs, and little drops of moisture appears on
	the topmost screen or window.  It then does a complete disk scan,
	wiping the boot block and all files clean with a Kleenex (R) tissue.

	When the REVERSE option is used, Disease will re-infect the disk
	with an even worse virus and display a requester instructing the
	user to return the disk to the person who supplied it.

Utilities/BLAZESALV

	Program for restoring a crashed hard drive.  Retrieves all lost
	data and automatically converts them to BLAZEMONGER "save" files.

Utilities/Clock

	Greatly enhanced.  Any IFF graphics may be used as the clock image.
	Can optionally run backwards, forwards, or both.  Now contains all
	functionality of the Commodities Exchange, making Tools/Exchange
	obsolete.  Also has a fully-functional integrated spreadsheet,
	relational database, and recipe program, plus FAXmodem support.
	Built-in "Calvin and Hobbes" random quote generator with sound
	effects.  Childproof lid.

Fonts/Topaz

	Obsolete.  (Developers -- please modify your applications to
	accommodate this minor change.)

Devs/Printers/Boombox

	New driver for sending printer data to your stereo system.
	Makes a God-awful noise.  Fun at parties.


SPECIFICATIONS OF NEW AAAAAAAA CHIPSET

	The AAAAAAAA (Advanced Amiga Application Architecture And Active
AArdvark) chipset is the product of many centuries of development here
at Commodore.  Way back around OS version V39, the AA chipset was the
big thing.  But with the addition of each new "A", we have increased the
chipset's capabilities speed and throughput.  The final advance was the
realization that all bugs could be removed from the chipset by putting an
aardvark inside to eat them.

	Here is an overview of the new AAAAAAAA features.

	o	"A" mode, the default, in which the chipset emulates
		the ECS or AA chipset, whichever it feels like.

	o	"AA" mode, in which the chipset breaks down and
		confesses that it used to be an alcoholic.

	o	"AAA" mode, in which the chipset breaks down completely
		and has to be towed to a nearby service station.

	o	"AAAA" mode, in which the chipset breaks down and
		confesses that it used to tow cars to nearby service
		stations.

	o	"AAAAA" mode, "AAAAAA" mode, and "AAAAAAA" mode, which
		are still carefully guarded secrets.  See
		comp.sys.amiga.advocacy article number 39754 for a
		complete overview.

	For more information about the AAAAAAAA chipset, registered
developers and pirates should call 222-2222, extension 2, and ask for
"Snorky."

Sorry, doodz, but that's all there was -- the end of the file was obviously
corrupted.  Thank God that the important stuff was undamaged -- yeah!!
(Who takes baths anyway??)
