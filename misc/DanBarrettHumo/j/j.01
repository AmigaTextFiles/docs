	Where are the 2.0 ROMs?  Simple -- I have them.  All of them.  I've
had them since CBM started making them 4 years ago.  Yes, it's true:  2.0
has been finished for FOUR YEARS.  Developers have been shipped old versions
(cleverly named things like "2.04") to throw you off the track.

	Why is Commodore lying to you?  Because they HATE THEIR CUSTOMERS.
In fact, every morning at precisely 9:00am, all CBM employees stand at
attention and perform "Customer Hate" exercises, such as tearing up
warrantee cards and flinging live weasels through plate-glass windows.
Nobody is really sure what the weasels are for, but it somehow sets the mood
JUUUUST right.

	But I have decided to violate my non-disclosure agreement (shhhh) to
tell you these important facts.  Hell, here's another fact:  2.0 will NEVER
be available for the Amiga 400.  What?  You didn't even know there was going
to be an Amiga 400?  It's got an 6800 CPU, 1 KB RAM, 50 KB external hard
drive, 4,618,911 joystick ports (perfect for playing the latest version of
BLAZEMONGER), and a new technological breakthrough:  "reinterlaced" video,
for people who own 2 VCR's.

	Now, don't you feel better?

                                                        Dan
