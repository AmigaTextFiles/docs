Subject: Finally: a SOLUTION for all the flames in c.s.a.advocacy
Keywords: flames, third degree burns, get the marshmallows
Date: 11 Feb 92 18:43:01 GMT

	Maybe you haven't noticed, but flames and nasty remarks are starting
to pop up again all over the c.s.a. hierarchy.  We have HAM-E flames in
c.s.a.graphics, "Future of Amiga" flames in c.s.a.misc, modem flames in
c.s.a.datacomm, and other violations.  It is time for us to realize that the
flamers cannot be confined to just the "advocacy" newsgroup.  What can be
done about this?

	I have a simple and efficient solution:  let's turn ALL the
newsgroups into flame groups!  Yes!!  A few simple name-changes, and we
can have a whole hierarchy of anger and hate!!!  Wheee, won't that be FUN?
Here is my complete proposal for new groups to replace the existing (and
similar sounding) ones!

(1)	comp.sys.amiga.myth

	The "general talk" Amiga group.  Hints, rumors, legends, nitpicks,
	minor falsehoods, small crimes, outright lies, etc.

(2)	comp.sys.amiga.anonymous

	Moderated.  USENET people and Amiga vendors will submit the most
	awful stuff they can think of.  The moderator will accept the
	juiciest ones and post them anonymously, or in the names of
	well-known Net personalities.  (Of course, the moderator's name and
	e-mail address would be kept secret.)

(3)	comp.sys.amiga.refused

	Moderated.  All submissions are immediately rejected by the
	moderator.  Nothing is ever posted here.

(4)	comp.sys.amiga.introspection

	Frequently asked questions, such as "why I am I reading News,"
	"what else could I be doing that is more productive," and
	"where can I find psychological help to break my USENET addiction."

(5)	comp.sys.amiga.hardcore

	For true, die-hard flamers.  Yell and scream about the latest
	hardware mistakes and technical errors, and how you could have done
	it 100 times better and 10 times quicker, for 5 percent of the
	cost.

(6)	comp.sys.amiga.programs

	Fanatical discussion of Amiga appearances on television shows.

(7)	comp.sys.amiga.gams

	Flames containing sexist remarks.

(8)	comp.sys.amiga.multimediator

	With all this flaming going on, SOMEBODY has to try to make peace.
	This is the group where people can volunteer to reconcile the
	differences between opposing flamers.

(9)	comp.sys.amiga.supplications

	The official forum for begging and pleading to Commodore for
	the latest OS and hardware advances.

(10)	comp.sys.amiga.marketingplace

	Flames and more flames against Commodore's marketing department.
	A traffic limit of 32,768 posts per day will be imposed to prevent
	USENET sites from running out of disk space.

(11)	comp.sys.amiga.auditor

	Screams and complaints against Irving Gould's high salary.

(12)	comp.sys.amiga.adversary

	The pits of Hell.  The slime of the earth.  Yes, here are found
	the worst of the worst, the lowest of the low, the flamingest
	of the flamers.  Enter and die immediately.  You have been warned.

(13)	comp.sys.amiga.dad&mom

	After reading through all the other groups, your brain is wasted
	and your body sore.  Come to this newsgroup for sympathy, a kiss
	on the cheek, and a hot dinner.

and, of course:

(14)	comp.sys.amiga.BLAZEMONGER

	Discussion of important Amiga software, hardware,
	programming, games, applications, multimedia, audio,
	telecommunications, and other related topics.


Well, what does everybody think?  Should we do it?  Personally, I think it's
time to face reality and convene this Grand Reorganization ((C) Kent@Xanth)
as soon as possible!

                                                        Dan
