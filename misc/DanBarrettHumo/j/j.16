	Yes, it's true -- the Amiga is terribly overpriced compared to PC
clones.  And now the gap has widened even farther!!  Introducing...

		**   C H E A P O -- K L O A N Z   **

...the complete 50 MHz '486 system for only $199.99 (US)!!

	WOW!  How can anybody afford to make and sell clones at that price,
I hear you ask?  The secret is good-old AMERICAN ENGINEERING KNOW-HOW.  Did
we skimp on FEATURES?  Did we skimp on VALUE?  NO WAY!!  Just take a look at
what's included in our POWERFUL package:

o	50 MHz 80486!

	ZZZZZZOOOOMMMM!!!  Hot roddin' CPU POWER!!  Every KLOAN comes with
	the new Intel "80486-BS" chip, which is made by taking an 8086 and
	writing a "4" in the middle of the model number.  (And a "5" in
	front of the clock speed.)

o	128K cache memory!

	With a lightning-quick 80 millisecond access time!

o	4 MB RAM, expandable to 16 MB

	Yes, this computer includes all of the 8-bit RAM you will EVER need
	for your computing needs!!

o	14" 1024x768 Super VGA color monitor!

	Our own state-of-the-art, high-resolution color monitor, capable of
	displaying over 16,000,000 colors simultaneously!  (Provided that
	they are all either "black" or "white".)

o	Two floppies!

	Don't confuse CHEAPO-KLOANZ with any of those lousy 1-floppy
	systems!!  Every KLOAN comes with TWO genuine Sony(TM) floppy disks.

o	Mini-tower case!

	Stands an impressive 50 mm high, with plenty of room for microfilm,
	sand, or stamp collections!

o	660 MB of hard drive space!

	Those ingenious engineers at CHEAPO-KLOANZ have broken the price
	barrier by stacking sixty-six 10-megabyte Seagate drives on top
	of each other.  This awesome structure stands proudly next to
	your mini-tower case, and boasts a spine-tingling 900ms average
	access time.

o	EISA/SCSI

	We stamp these letters PROUDLY on every KLOAN.  We don't know WHAT
	they mean, but heck... they sure do attract a lot of buyers!!

o	Free software included!

	Yes, every KLOAN includes the following popular and vital software!

	-	DOS 1.0... the original and best!
	-	Microsoft Windows 0.9
	-	The Michelangelo Virus

o	And more!!

	Robin Banks, president of CHEAPO-KLOANZ, personally puts his
	noseprint on every system we ship!

Now at this point, we at CHEAPO-KLOANZ are sure you can appreciate the
incredible value of our systems.  But... you might be thinking, "I should
buy a name brand because I want support from the company."  Don't worry --
CHEAPO-KLOANZ offers 1 FULL YEAR OF ON-SIGHT SERVICE and 1 FULL YEAR OF
TELEPHONE SUPPORT!  Check it OUT:

o	On-Sight Service

	If anything should go wrong with your KLOAN during the first year of
	use, simply pack the computer in its original box and ship it back
	to us.  As soon as we sight it, we'll repair it, and return it to
	you within 3 "working days."  (We work on the last day of every month
	that begins with the letter "O", excluding holidays.)  Ship it
	(carrier pigeon only) to:

		CHEAPO-KLOANZ
		Just Past the Men's Lavatory
		Number 1
		Grand Central Station
		New York NY  10001

o	Telephone support

	Every KLOAN comes with a sturdy, plastic telephone support
	guaranteed to keep your telephone from falling off the hook
	for a full year.

Hey... what MORE could you ASK FOR?  And the $199.99 price includes BOTH of
these vital support services absolutely FREE!  For more details, check out

		First in HOWELL THE THIRD!
