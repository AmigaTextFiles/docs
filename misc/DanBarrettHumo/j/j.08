Summary: BLAZEMONGER INC. strikes again!
Keywords: Flames great, less filling

	Boy, these "computer wars" sure take a lot of time!  I mean, I know
that everybody loves hearing why computer X is better than computer Y, but
think of all the EFFORT involved!  There are DOZENS of flamers working hard
to write LONG and ORIGINAL articles about issues that get argued OVER and
OVER again.  There MUST be a better way!

	There IS a better way!!

	[Rumble rumble]

	Introducing...

			P H R A S E M O N G E R

the FASTEST way to FLAME!

	Yes, PHRASEMONGER, the latest in a series of USEFUL yet HARMFUL
products from the creative cesspools of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED.
PHRASEMONGER is so AMAZINGLY, MIND-NUMBINGLY FAST that it can flame EVERY
POSTER in the comp.sys.amiga hierarchy in mere SECONDS!  Even by E-MAIL!!

	Did somebody just post an article that you HATED?  Did the poster
tell LIES, HALF-TRUTHS, or just plain BULL??  Did it make you ANGRY?!?!?  Do
you want to POST THE MOST VICIOUS, DAMAGING FLAME IN THE HISTORY OF
ELECTRONIC MEDIA, TOTALLY DESTROYING THE REPUTATIONS OF THE IDIOT POSTER AND
HIS MOTHER AND PET DOGGIE FOR ALL ETERNITY??!!!?!??!?!?!

	Well, in that case, I suggest that you get serious psychological help
immediately!  But for the REST of us, PHRASEMONGER is a quick way to FLAME
without having to work hard.  After all, isn't that what computers are for?

	Simply feed the offending USENET article into PHRASEMONGER, click on
the appropriate intensity gadget ("Disagree", "Disagree Strongly", "Hate",
"Maim", "Kill Lightly", "Dismember", "Puree", or "REALLY Not Nice"), and let
the program go to work!  Instantly, a customized FLAME is ready for your
posting pleasure.

	For example, suppose that Joe Flamebait has posted the following
article:

		From: flamebait@deadbeef.barbeque.edu
		Subject: Re: Re: Re: Mac vs. NeXT vs. Muhammed Ali
		Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.aversion

		In article <2938749@hot.ouch> scumface@barbie.ken.com
		writes:
		>Which should I buy?

		Buy a Mac.  It has a cute little trashcan.  Much better than
		the nasty NeXT "black hole."  And besides, I am such an
		expert on these two machines that I think I'll post it in an
		Amiga newsgroup so everybody can be enlightened.

		Joe Flamebait, flamebait@deadbeef.barbeque.edu
		No matter where you go, there's a stupid quote!

	Feed it to PHRASEMONGER, click on the "Half-Intensity" gadget, and
look what comes out!!

		From: <your name or pseudonym here>
		Subject: What a JERK (was Re: Re: Re: Mac vs. NeXT vs. ...)
		Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.aversion,comp.sys.atari.st,
			    sci.electronics,rec.humor,comp.binaries.ibm-pc,
			    misc.books,rec.music.synth,alt.pictures.d
		Followup-To: comp.sys.mac,rec.arts.startrek,comp.unix.wizards

		>[totally ignorant ravings deleted]

		Mac?  MAC?!?  Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND!?!??!?  You OBVIOUSLY
		have NO IDEA what you're talking about!  The NeXT?!?  GET A
		LIFE!!  Both of these machines are INEPT at best, incapable
		even of picking the CORNS on my TOES.  And don't even
		*mention* Multifinder... oh, no.  What a JOKE.

		The Mac *belongs* in the very TRASH CAN that it displays.
		The NeXT should get SUCKED into a black hole itself.
		And you, Mr. Smarty-Pants, should be fed to rabid wolves.

		And next time, buddy, keep it in your OWN NEWSGROUP!!!

	Not bad, eh?  But that's not ALL!  You don't even have to give
PHRASEMONGER the original article!  Just type in a few key words or phrases,
and PHRASEMONGER will give you a perfect flame ANYWAY!

	Example 1:

		Input:	Apple, Irving Gould, CDTV
		Gadget:	"Maim"

		Output:	"You misbegotten Apple employees don't know what
			you're TALKING ABOUT!  This is TOTAL and UTTER
			BULLSHIT!!!  CDTV can run RINGS around the Mac IIfx
			ANY DAY OF THE WEEK!!  Get the HELL off of the NET!!!

						Love,
						Irving Gould"

	Example 2:

		Input:	asdf4
		Gadget:	"Embarrass"

		Output:	"WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!!!!!  No matter
			HOW you say it, your INFORMATION is COMPLETELY
			without content!  I refer you to chapter 4 of the
			ROM KERNEL MANUAL so you can see how BRAINLESS your
			comment was.  No, I won't tell you the PAGE NUMBER,
			you mamby-pamby little CREEP."

	Now that you've seen PHRASEMONGER at work, a natural question you
might ask is:  "How does PHRASEMONGER do it?"  To answer that question,
let's feed it to PHRASEMONGER (at various intensity levels) and find out!!

		Input:	"How does PHRASEMONGER do it?"

		Gadget:	Somewhat Friendly
		Output:	"BLAZEMONGER INC. has the ULTIMATE programmers.
			They can do ANYTHING, you little dweeb."

		Gadget:	Medium
		Output:	"We don't give out TRADE SECRETS for FREE, you
			MOOCHER.  Write your OWN damn program."

		Gadget:	Destructive
		Output:	"By kidnapping your MOTHER and doing IRRESPONSIBLE
			ACTIONS with a garden hose."

	Wheee!!!  Obviously this program has lots of POTENTIAL.  It is hoped
that PHRASEMONGER will provide the ULTIMATE in high-temperature
entertainment for YEARS to come!!  Get your copy now at finer software
stores everywhere.  But be sure to wear gloves when opening the box....

                                                        Dan

PS:	WARNING!  Judging from the content of some of the recent articles in
	this newsgroup, it is obvious that some buggy "beta" copies of
	PHRASEMONGER have leaked out onto USENET.  Beware!
