Subject: Please help me decide

Dear Amiga fans:

	Please help me decide how to spend my money!  I am considering
getting an Amiga 3000UX because I think it's a really cool machine.  But
lately, I've been thinking that it would be better to buy a new stereo
system, or maybe some real estate.  Could somebody please tell me the
advantages and disadvantages of each?  Please POST your answers because I am
sure lots of people have the same question.

	Also, I want to start programming the Amiga, and I would like to
know which language is best.  Is assembly language really useless, or what?
And does C suck?  Once again, please post all your answers.

	In case you are interested... my first programming project will be a
"clock" that displays the time in the right hand corner of the Workbench
screen.  On lots of advice from the Net, I've decided that my program should
kill the OS and take over the machine.  All the other clock programs I've
seen are just too slow -- they take an entire SECOND to update the display!
Go straight to the metal, that's what I always say.

	Oh yeah, another question:  why isn't there a new Amiga chipset
yet?  I swear, if General Electric can bring out a new refrigerator model
every 6 months, why can't Commodore?  Maybe they should spend more money.
Or save more money.  Or both.  Anyway, I know what I'm talking about because
my uncle took a marketing course once.

	Finally, I missed the most recent NeXT vs. Amiga flame war.  Could
somebody please repost all of the articles?

	Thanks!

							Dan
