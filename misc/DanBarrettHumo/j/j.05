	Hey, buddy, haven't you ever heard of LOOK AND FEEL??  That's MY
posting style!!!  It's trademarked, patented, copyrighted, and copy
PROTECTED!  I'm gonna sue, I'm gonna sue....

	Jeez, next thing you know, somebody will start posting articles
with the look & feel of other USENETers.  Can you imagine:

?	"I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  if Commodore doesn't
	produce a 25-bit chipset immediately, they won't stand a chance
	against the new Japanese game machine."

?	"Yup, you are nearly correct.  The 68040 cache disables the VPL
	interrupt several nanoseconds before the beam hits the disk.  It
	doesn't need to go to the bus."

?	"X is a bloated pig that deserves to die.  My old 3B1 moves windows
	faster."

?	"Why buy an A3000UX for $5000 when you can get a NeXT for $3000?
	It's clearly the superior machine in all respects."

?	"HEY DOODZ LIKE KNOW ANY PIRATE BOARDZ???"

?	"BADGE (Bay Area Amiga Developers' GroupE) will host its July 1997
	meeting at 7:30pm in the SLAC Main Auditorium.  The featured speaker
	will be Dr. Ray Cromwell discussing his COLORMONGER Card Mark XII."

?	"but thats not what I meant!
	In asembler you do not use the jmp without first mov sr,ea!"

?	"*** I want games that look like Madonna but play like an old,
	scratchy, 78 rpm record. ***"

?	"Captain!  The Marketroids are closing in!"

?	"Responding to the following:

	'The Macintosh reminds me of tuna fish.'

	Where did you hear this?  It's not true at all.  In fact, the Mac's
	new 7.0 priority scheduler makes it much more like halibut."

?	"No idiot in his right mind would use the Amiga OS source code to
	break the rules.  In fact, the rules break the Amiga OS source code.
	Or something like that."

?	"Please throw out your OS disassembly and use only the RKM's.
	Also, throw out all of your software and use only the manuals that
	came with it.  If there wasn't a manual at all, then you should
	not have bought the program."

?	"Even since my grand reorganization,
	these groups are still too big!
	I'd prefer only one or two
	articles per day.
	And maybe only
	one word
	per
	line."

So PLEASE everybody, let's avoid this kind of horror by posting in our OWN,
DISTINCT STYLES.  Otherwise, somebody's gonna get flamed.

	And it will probably be me! :-)
