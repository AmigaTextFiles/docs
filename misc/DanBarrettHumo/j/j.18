FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

	   COMMODORE TO ANNOUNCE NEW MACHINES AND DIRECTIONS
		  AT SEPTEMBER "WORLD OF COMMODORE"

WEST CHESTER, Pa.  -- August 26, 1992 -- Commodore-Amiga Incorporated,
makers of the Amiga computer, will introduce its new line of personal
computers at the World of Commodore show in California this September.
But today, in a surprise press conference, they "pre-announced" their
new product line, bringing an end to months of rumors and speculation.

Amiga fans worldwide were expecting a lot of different things:  a
68040-based Amiga, the rumored "AA" chipset, device-independent graphics,
enhanced audio, and other features.  But Commodore, it seems, has fooled
them all.

"We have decided to drop the Amiga line entirely and concentrate on a
totally new machine," said Irving Gould, Chief Moneybagger of Commodore.
"We call it the 'Falcon'."  The new computer reportedly will have a 68030
CPU, Motorola 56001 DSP chip, high resolution color graphics, a new operating
system called "MultiDOS", and a list price of $799.00.  "We are confident
that you've never seen a computer like this before," said Gould.

Surprised developers were quick to point out that Atari also sells a
"Falcon" computer with exactly the same specifications.  "Oh God, not that
crusty piece of vaporware," Gould responded.  "And anyway, we thought of it
first."

As usual, Commodore will offer a generous "trade up" program for all
existing Amiga owners.  ("Non-existing" Amiga owners will continue to float
in the Ninth Dimension.)  To trade up, simply rip off the front cover of
your "Introducing The Commodore Amiga" manual and send it in, along with
$3.00 for postage and handling, and Commodore will mail you a brand new
Falcon.  Reportedly, true Amiga advocates have sneered at this offer,
calling it a "ripoff."  "F*cking Gould knows that it costs only $2.90 to
ship this machine," said Jouff Yeng, noted market analyst.

The new machines, after they are officially announced at the WOC, are
scheduled to ship "before Christmas."  CBM officials were quick to deny
that this really means "Christmas 1998", but beyond that no details were
given.

In addition to announcing the new machines, Commodore described some bold,
new directions in its marketing strategy.  The first "Commodore Falcon" TV
commercials will air on October 10 on MTV.  In them, famous musicians such
as Bon Jovi, Liberace, JS Bach, and The Marc Barrett Memorial Polka Band
will all join hands and sing Lithuanian folk songs.  Accompanying this music
will be "mind-blowing graphics" which were entirely produced on a Cray
supercomputer with a "Falcon" sticker on its front panel.  The end of the
commercial will display Commodore's new slogan for the 1990's:  "The
Commodore Falcon.  Make Up Somebody Else's Creative Mind (TM)."

-------- end of quoted artifice
