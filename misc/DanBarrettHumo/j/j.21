	Now that the A4000 is officially announced, I have a few very simple
but highly pertinent questions about it.  Could someone from CBM, preferably
Irving, please post a reply?

(1)	Is it available in purple?

(2)	Does it come with a free A2000?

(3)	Can it use ST-506 hard disks?  If so, then why not?

(4)	Can we install both the "AA" and "AGA" chipsets simultaneously in the
	same machine, for parallel processing?

(5)	How long does the 1-year warrantee last?

(6)	Will the A4000 fit inside an A500 case, so I can fool my friends?

(7)	I have a bunch of ZIP, DIP, SIMM, SLIMM JIMM, and other memory
	thingies in different sizes (1Mx4, 256Kx13, etc).  Can I install all
	of them on the A4000 motherboard at the same time?  If not, then
	Commodore really sucks fecal matter through a straw.

(8)	Is the A1960 monitor surface-mounted to the A4000 motherboard?

(9)	How many serial ports does it take to change a lightbulb?

(10)	Is it true that Jay Miner personally licks every A4000 before
	it leaves the factory?

(11)	What is a 68040, and why does the A4000 need one?

(12)	Are there any plans for OS 3.0 to have "TextCraft" in ROM?

(13)	Is it true that the A5000, code-named "The Bonker", will be released
	next month, and be completely incompatible with the A4000?

(14)	Will somebody please post a list of all Amiga software and
	hardware packages, describing which ones do and don't work
	with the A4000?  Please hurry -- I need this by tomorrow.

(15)	What are all of Commodore's engineering secrets?  Don't worry,
	we won't spread them around.  Right, Slu?

(16)	I just heard of a 1970's rock group called "The Commodores."  Is
	this just coincidence?  The lead singer looked just like Dave Haynie,
	or maybe Carolyn Scheppner.  Anyway, I'd appreciate knowing if their
	big hit, which I believe was called "Stairway to Heaven", is really
	about CBM marketing strategy.

(17)	Who won the World Series in 1949?  Why wasn't Commodore there?

(18)	I have recently come to agree with everything Marc Barrett
	has ever written on USENET.  Do you recommend that I call
	Dr. Ruth?

(19)	Do I really have to be attending school to be eligible for the A4000
	educational discounts?  Or can I just educate myself instead, say, by
	reading every issue of AmigaWorld?  Do I get an extra discount for
	brain damage?

(20)	If I throw my computer over a cliff and watch it crash into the
	surf and explode into a million pieces, does this make me an
	"Amiga Pioneer"?

(21)	I heard a rumor that Commodore is going to be bought out by
	BillyBob's Plumbing of Chickenmilk, Wisconsin.  Should I buy
	more stock?

	And finally, could somebody please post Commodore's official A4000
press release again?  I missed it the first 83 times.  Just to be sure, how
about if everybody posts it again?  And please cross-post it to all other
USENET newsgroups so nobody misses it.  Thanks!

                                                        Dan
