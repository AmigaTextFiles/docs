Hello, Cecilia (of ImageFX ML, as I recall)! Kenny (long time no type!),
cast my vote for any formats in wide use (wav, Flyer audio, enhanced,
whatever). SoftLogik just took it on the chin in Macworld magazine for
not supporting M$Word format; and the "journalist" was probably right.
We need to be able to effectively work in the larger world.

Wow! We, too, would be interested in a Flyer-Friendly
'filter' and editor! We're just getting up to speed
with integrating S-16 into our daily Flyer wrestlin'
matches, and are ready for new challenges/capabilities.

Here's a forward that talks about midi needs for the New AMIGA that was
announced at WOA. This Amiga with 5.0 OS is scheduled for release in
1999. For info on this look at the typical net news sources and sites.


-- Forward -- mailto:owner-teamamiga@thule.no --------------------------


>perhaps AInc will allow for all standard (cheap) useful things to be
>placed on the mainboard like Midi and so on rather than as an extra.

It really is not necessary to build in midi ports today; pro users want
more ports than in/out/thru - for more channels - and synchronization
hardware also. A plethora of midi interfaces in various abilities/ranges
are available from established vendors. All that is needed are drivers,
and appropriate serial or parallel ports, to use many of these on Amiga.

Wintels and Macs don't feature a built-in ports; most users will never
access those ports, so why put them there? (Unless you want to build in
multiple sets on a New AMIGA notebook! ;)  Home/project/professional
studios want to choose hardware that best meets their needs; only a
small minority of serious midi users get by today with 16 channels.

The channel limit on Old Amiga further impacted its purchase as a midi
tool. Only Blue Ribbon ever got that together, at a date when the Mac,
Atari - and even PC - had support for more than 16 channels for years.
Really, developers on Mac and W95/NT have, through generations of
experience and qualified user input, built the best tools that are
possible today on those OSes.

The New AMIGA can probably do them one better in beginner, intermediate,
and even pro midi software, because of multitasking and OS legacies. But
it will require a new mindset about music and midi to make any inroads.
Amiga users tend to vociferously defend midi software that is mediocre
in ability by today's standards. (Or they are involved in the creative
but limited world of mods.)

Even on the PC today (Mac is still ahead BTW, but the gap is closing),
the good stuff is so easy to use, so cheap, and yet powerful. It is only
the fact that running under Windows slightly hamstrings it. But Amiga in
its heyday could only attract a portion of a percent of serious users -
mostly on the premise that midi COULD be better on Amiga. Any day now.

Probably the easiest SOLUTION is for AmigaInc to make such a convincing
case for The New AMIGA that an existing developer (Opcode, Mark Of The
Unicorn, Cakewalk, Voyetra, Steinberg, Cubase, Passport) is willing to
get a team porting a world-class tiered sequencer/digital-audio title.

No existing commercial Amiga midiware is around to make the leap. David
Joiner is elsewhere (and lone wolfs can't keep up since MusicX days - it
REQUIRES a TEAM). SunRize - hah. And Todor and Co can't be counted on to
save us this time - they are vassals in the Evil Empire. (I would bet on
them otherwise. BlueRibbon seemed to see possibilities and was ambitious
enough to do the modern big deal.)

None of the shareware/freeware is even close. Maybe if one of these
progs were bootstrapped and... No, in good conscience I couldn't recom-
mend such an approach, even for Old Amiga. These things just don't have
the juice. We need a cutting-edge team with a good business front, beta
testers from games, soundtracks, AV, and MUSIC backgrounds, liaisons to
work with music hardware and DigitalAudio card manufacturers - the whole
schmear.

Anything else is just a waste of time for the New AMIGA!

Hi! Kenny put me in! on supporting additional file formats that would be great
especially wave. Kenny any advise you can give me on Creating audio Cd's with
the AD516 and  a Recoh 6200s CD_rw on  an A4000T 25mhz, 16 megs  I keep
getting buffer under run if i try to do a disk at once recording from my sony
cd player or my Fujitsu 1 gig Hardrive.
Thanks for your time an efforts on the studio16 mailing list.. I would be lost
without this mailing list...

Hi Troy and Thor,

I will support plain WAVs to start off with. Is there any need for ADPCM
compressed WAVs (hoping not.. ;) ?

i'm nearly positive that newtek would charge money for use of their flyer
format audio in software.  i can send you a sample of flyer audio if you
want to look at it.  that would save me IMMENSE amounts of time.

I've just been through a heap of WAV files from students (mostly saved
from Sound Forge) and several were compressed. So it seems compressed
WAV files are common.

WAV would surely be worth while. There are so many WAV files out
there.

Would you be prepared to supply the information you have discovered
for the AD516 to the authors of other sample editing software, such as
Samplitude (Marc Albrecht), SFX (Stefan Kost) or Soundprobe? As usual
where there are several similar programs, each has particular useful
features.

Hi Ted and all,

Not to promise anything, but with a filefilter it is possible to do edits in
the existing editor actually, ala AIFF. Also, the AIFF filter which contains
a bug (in rate was it?) can be replaced. Additionally the AIFF filter could
have a non-standard chunk added to keep the (non-destructive) editlist that
the Studio 16 files contains so you could do more powerful edits to it.

With the 'enhanced' Studio 16 format I was thinking of adding a couple of
features such as todays destructive edits becomes optinonally
non-destructive as well. This is obtained by adding the destructive parts to
the end of the file and manipulate the editlist (roughly explained).

Other stuff that can be made is a CDDA reader (directly from CDs), network
tranfers etc. (no promises as I said..). If any other developers are
interrested in how to write a filefilter I could try to explain.

I just made a rough WAV converter and everything works ok. Give me a couple
of more weeks to finish it. Only PCM will be supported due to the filters
nature (it's not a trivial task to f.ex. seek to a position inside
compressed data as the real position is unknown). Also, only mono files can
be supported ("limitation" of Studio 16's filter mechanism).

I don't see why. I could be wrong, but normal wav's
would be excellent  enough to me.

>Here's a forward that talks about midi needs for the New AMIGA that 

You and I have talked about the vision that could blow the midi world's
doors off greenboy. Now if a team could be found. Trouble is, all teams
capable are coding games, the new OS or defected to mac and wintel.
Sure a team from one of the big boys (cakewalk, voyetra....) could do a
port,
but it couldn't be as good as the original wintel version.... that is....

IN MY OPINION EVERYONE. Because it would probably just be a hack
of the original. Would they really start from scratch and write a version
from the ground up that would be amiga OS through and through?
Nah, I doublt it. it would likely be a shadow of it's self. BUT! since
there
is no other serious professional sequencer in development for amiga,
then one of these half hearted ports would be better than what we
have. I just don't think it would be good enough to persude wintel or
mac users to look to amiga as a better solution. And that's what we need.
To bring in new blood. Most musicians are on PC's now, but they don't
seem to like or enjoy it as much as I or other pro amiga users do. 

The message is right.
The next midi  package needs to be unmatched by others.
Nothing will ever please every one, but we should have some thing
that does all the needed pro funtions in a style not done anywhere else.
This will draw attention and users who do not like the current
sequencers.
Not because the currents are bad tools, but because something new will be
more
comfortable to them. An example from yesterday.... I spoke with an
x-amigian
who now uses lightwave on  PC, he hated the way Imagine did it's
animations.
I don't care for the way lightwave does things, and love to work with
Imagine.
Imagine does most, if not all things, Lightwave does. But Imagine does it
in
a way that works for me. SO..... I'm buying my next update to Imagine
5.0.
If Imagine simply did what lightwave did, then why should I use it? If
you
simply port a wintel sequencer to amiga, then why should a wintel user
ever want to move to amiga? There is no need. Well the next person
can have the soap box, I'm finished...... back to studing my
programming....
You can send this note back through the same channel the original came
from. I think it would give them some more to think about :)

troy

I have already been talking to Marc, Dr. Maurizzio (ProStation), Martin Blom
(AHI) and briefly with Stefan. The main problem with any sounddriver for
AD516 and AD1012 is that the studio.library (apperantly) doesn't support
direct memory access for double buffering. I am discussing workarounds for
this with Martin and Marc to 'fool' Studio 16 to think the memory is a file
with the aid of a handler.

That CDDA player would come in handy to check files before mastering.  Would
we be able to play them from Stu16?  I've had the experience of corrupt Stu16
files playing properly at "home", but not exported & written to a CDR disk.
How about a Stu16, vs2 to CDDA file converter, so we don't have to edit on
AIFF files for CD mastering?
 
BTW, what's the AIFF "Bug" that was mentioned?

Hi,
   does anybody know why I can't get Studio16 v 3.01 to work. I'm
 having the following problem: immediately after program startup, I
 get the following error message on Studio16 main screen (in a
 requester):


    AD1012
    This handler requires at least 64K ram chips
                          OK


After that, all configured application (mixer, transport, editor etc.)
windows do show up, meaning that they start normally but most are 
inoperative due to the correct handler not being loaded up. By replacing 
this handler (AD1012.handler in Studio16_3:drivers) with the one that 
comes as standard with v 2.07, I get other errors, like:

    Can't find AD516 card    (in fact I own an AD1012!)

    Try restting the card

and so on. It seems to me that the handler that comes with Studio16
v 3.01 is either not right with my card or uncorrect on its own (but I 
doubt it). Can anyone using v. 3.01 tell me about the size of their 
AD1012 handler so that I can compare it with the one I have, along with 
the size of the three libraries:

    Interface.library
    studio16.library
    gadtools.library

Thanks for your help. Luca

Yes, even drop them on the Cuelist. A handler must be written to treat the
tracks as files though.

I can, but you aren't going to like the answer!!!

V3.0 of Studio16 requires that the AD1012 card be modified to use 64K ram
chips. I never got a reasonable answer as to why, but if I wanted to use my
AD1012, I had to return the card to Sunrize for the mod.

You have two choices:

1) use a v2.x version of Studio16

2) replace the AD1012 with an AD516.

There is no info, that I am aware of, to make the mod yourself.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news...

Hello All,

According to a past discussion in this news group, the memory on the
AD1012 must be upgraded to at least 128K (2 64K chips). Here are
some clips from that discussion. These replies should get you started:

From: Serge Guilbert

The AD1012 uses two identical RAM chips in parallel. They are the 28 pin
chips, or
32 pin chips found at the end of the board, in sockets. I think it's U33 & U34.
The sockets are 32 pin, but will accept 28 pin chips, depending on the size
of the
memory. For ex: On my AD1012, I originally found 2 32k chips (28 pins), for a
total of 64k. I replaced these with 2 128k chips (32 pins), for a total of
256k.
The AD1012 seems to have been designed to automatically recognize a few
different
sizes (32k, 64k, 128k).

The RAM chips are made by a number of memory manufacturers (MOSEL-Vitelic,
Hitachi, Texas, etc), and usually has a part number which defines memory size,
along with access speed. Ex: MOSEL xx256-10 would mean an 8 bit x 32k config (=
256k bits), with a 100 nanosec access time.

Other manufacturers list byte sizes as their part number, instead of bit sizes.
Ex: Hitachi xxx128-70 would mean 8 bit x 128k, with a 70 nanosec access time.

I must stress that it doesn't matter who makes the chips, or what the part
number is, as long as it has the proper number of pins (28, or 32), has the
proper
config (8 bit x 32k, or 8 bit by 64k, or 8 bit by 128k), and is 100 nanosec, or
faster (70, 80, 60, etc).

Also From Serge:


For anyone interested, the exact part number for the 128k chips is:

Hitachi, HM62128-10, 32 pin  (8 bit x 128k config)

The -10 refers to 100 nanosec access speed. You can also look for something
faster
(-70  [70 nsec], or -85 [85 nsec]).


>From Jacob Ellis:

For anyone interested...


www.jdr.com has the exact Hitachi chip

SRAM 128KX8(551001-85)100NS 32DIP  HM628128LP-10  $6.99



A quick look on www.jameco.com also shows the following:

part# 103982  - 628128LP-85 128K x 8 85ns Low Power CMOS SRAM for $8.49



Good Luck!

Okie Dokie, really bad news!. I think that I have no choice but using
v 2.07 because it will be hard to find an AD516 card these days and
certainly would not come cheap. Anyway, thanks for telling me this but
one question: did you get this answer from Sunrize technical support?

Didn't someone write a program that captures mouse moves and
replays them? You might be able to control the mouse capture program 
with ARexx or a script somehow, and have it trigger SMPTEOut. 

Wish I could think of the name of the mouse capture program...

Very cool!

Could your file filter also handle stereo AIFF loading?

I like the way you think!

Hmm. That probably answers my first question.

There is a program called Scripit by Khalid Aldoseri (author of Final

Wav is a must nowadays.

Another format fo exporting Audio-files is RealAudio and maybe the Akai File-Format.

An enhanced version of the Studio 16 format, when doing this , contact Maurizio C. for
include this format in his Audio software project.

I'd like to put my vote in for Stereo Aiff as well. If anyone else out
there has a Wavetools board
this is the only format it will record in. There is a Wavetools utility
that will convert Stereo
Aiff to Sunrize left & right But loading directly would be preferrable.

I wouldn't mind seeing the .krz format either for Kurzweil K2000.

Kenny,

Mail me the card, I'll install the 64k chips and
then mail it back. But I think the postage would
be a killer from you to Atlanta, USA. :(
And maybe not worth the cost. I hope you can do
it or find some one closer to do it for you.

>Is there another way to do it ???

Hi Ren,

Mouse record/replay is one way to do it, but the problem is that as far as I
have detected the gadlib buttons that Studio 16 uses checks the hardware
directly for mouse presses (Ben, please correct me if I'm wrong). The reason
why I assume this is based on that you can't press alt+leftAmiga to simulate
a left mousebutton press as you would if it used intuition messages. That
means your hardware presses will not be recorded, only intuition [or input
events as the mouserecorder really uses] ones. I also get the impression that
the gadlib uses its own port (not the intuition one) to handle its own
gadget, but I haven't really had the time to study the gadget system in and
out yet so I can't say this for sure.

If I'm wrong I think the best way is to patch a library vector that is used
by the module (f.ex. OpenWindow..) and attach a program when the window
opened was "SMPTEOutput". That way you have control on the window and could
send intuition messages to it to simulate mousepresses. You can rescale x
and y coords based on window sizes etc. It's then also possible to add the
ability to accept cli comand and even arexx commands.

Hope this makes any sense.

regards,
- Kenny

Hi Jamie,

It could accept stereo AIFF files, but due to the architecture of Studio 16
(single channel/file system) it's unfortunately not of much use. It could
mix the two channels into a mono stream, but I guess some of the 'feature'
is lost then and there would be a small overhead in the mixing and scaling.

Oh, btw: conserning the WAV format: there will be some overhead involved
probably not making it as smooth as wanted. The reason is that WAV 16 bit
datas is stored in so-called Intel format (little endian first) and every
sample has to be 'rearranged' (swapping little/big endian). On faster CPUs
this will probably not be noticable, but on slower system (020/030 and
lower) there could might be a overload problem in some cases compared to
other formats. Stand to be proved of course.

>I like the way you think!

Thanks! The only drawback is that to support this new format a new editor
must be made (well, most people probably don't see this is a drawback I
guess ;) to support this as the internal editor will act destructive
anyways. Alternativly it would be great to see a special version of an
existing sample editor that pops up as a Studio 16 module (no need to
rewrite gui or anything) and used the resources of Studio 16 to play/record
etc. This would save tremendous amount of work, but I'm probably loosing
ground now..

Hi Art,

(Almost) any single channel format can be supported, I just need technical
documentation on the specs/format/structures to build them. I anyone can
supply formats on Kurweil, Akai etc. just let me know.

Conserning compressed formats:

The reason why compressed data can't be supported fully is due to Studio 16
need to Seek() sometimes (skipping some data forward/backward) and in
compressed data it can't keep track of the real position as it would need to
decompress the entire body to find out. Decompressing data on the fly is
also creating an overhead which could be critical in some cases.

If Studio 16 is able to just stream data without the need to seek in the
databody it can be supported, if not - forget it. It will need to seek on
Cuelist entries using crops/editlists, but I am not 100% sure how Studio 16
acts on noncropped entries, most likely it doesn't, but I have to run some
tests to make sure.

Hi, Yep, it's me. I'm planning on making my Studio16 card go Gaussian
(inside ImageFX reference).

Actually, I'm looking into things like BoXeR and other PPC boards as my
Next Amiga. Will I have to keep Studio in my 2000, or can it move
around? It would be great to really exploit the potential of this card.
I'm not the audio-guy in the family. My brother got his Studio16 card
first and wanted to make CD's etc. But, well, we all know what happened.
However, I'd like to be able to tell my brother that he can still use
his ol' 3000 yet.

	Hello(!) Cecilia,

>Hi, Yep, it's me. I'm planning on making my Studio16 card go Gaussian
>(inside ImageFX reference).

I'm a sap for radial star music, myself. But lightning strikes...  ;*}

Last time I talked to Mick Tinker (of Access - formerly Index), the
slots were to be Zorro3. So it should be no problem to use the AD516 in
a BoXeR. But - you will want a SCSI host of some type - the EIDE
currently slated for BoXeR is not of the 33MB/sec UltraDMA-mode2
variety, though this has not been finalized. S16 needs good drive speed.

For starters, check out http://www.cix.co.uk/~index/welcome.htm .


>My brother got his Studio16 card first and wanted to make CD's etc.
>But, well, we all know what happened. However, I'd like to be able to

It might be preferable to slap an '060 accelerator with Ultra-SCSI
onboard into an existing machine. PPC looks pretty interim, and has no
guarantee of significant software support (although it will do ImageFX
soon). Don't count on Studio16 on PPC ever.

I myself am keeping my existing machine, then buying the Siamese PCI
card to put in my (-dare I say it?-) Pentium2@300. That will meet my
needs until the New AMIGA arrives in 1999 (x fingers!). It is going to
be a screamin' meemie! 

Again, it is a good time to strategize - we have significant options!
Keep tuned --

The Studio16 gadlib.library installs an input handler at priority 51 (one
above
the Intuition input handler) and monitors raw input (rawkey, rawmouse,
timer)
events for processing into its internal gadget system events.  IntuiMessages
are only used for menu operations and handling the sizing/moving/closing of
windows.

Theoretically, one should be able to record and playback raw input events at
a priority higher than 51 and successfully spoof the gadlib stuff into
thinking
the input is real.

(and don't blame me... gadlib was way before my time... :-)

I had the same problem.  The 32k ram on the board are 32x8 SRAM  part #
62256 or the like .  You can buy 128x8 SRAM part#621000 at many electronic
supply houses. (part numbers vary between manufacturers-the important part
is the 128x8 address scheme and SRAM)  Get low power or CMOS (62C1000).  I
got mine at Active Electronics for $10 ea.  You Need 2 of them.  The 128x8
are larger but they will fit into the board.  The 32x8 chips are soccetted
on the top-front of the card.  You will see that they do not take up there
entire soccet-the 128 chips will.  Be sure to orient them properly.  I
plugged mine in and studio16_3 worked immediatly.
Good luck.   I'm not responsible for any problems ...Brad

That would be fantastic, Kenny.   Again, today I mastered another "coaster",
as 3 of 8 files were corrupt on the CD, and I can see no pattern as to why
this occurred, as they play perfectly in Stu16.  It's such a waste of time to
work hours and not know of problems before you commit to disk.

Off the top of my head, here are some more Stu16 time wasters:
1) Ok'ing  requesters that come up while editing the second track of a stereo
pair (as if you usually didn't cut, truncate, scale, etc., channel two of a
pair.
2) As per my post last week: The inability of the software to edit
automatically at the zero-crossing point, instead of {noisyclick!} elsewhere
on the waveform.
3) No digital-audio I/Outs.  (Note: The DelphinaLite doesn't have 'em, & they
were to-be developed almost a year ago!)
4) "Showing" a range at the beginning or end of a sample, Processing that
range, and then discovering that little bit that wasn't "shown" and is
{noisyclick!} unprocessed.
5)

I downloaded Scripit from Aminet and tried it out. The following
script will run the SMPTE program, set it to PAL time code, play code
for 5 seconds (250 jiffies) and stop. I haven't seen a way to set to a
particular code other than 00:00:00 yet.

If you look at the Scripit docs, you will see that the scripts can be
run from within an ARexx script, which of course Scala can run.

Note carefully the spaces in the menu items, between the quotes.
SMPTEoutput has spaces in its menus.

I have missed part of this thread, what do you intend to use these
input events for? What playbacks could you create using input
data like this for SMPTE?

And Kenny, how long till we start that PCI S16-s card?
Amiga bridge and amiga 5.0 aren't far away :)
Well back to my interface. I have a good ideal of the layout
but there is tons of code still to do. I think I could knit faster.

Injecting inputevents can have the SMPTEOutput module to think its buttons
are beeing pressed so it can be used from external program as it is GUI

And they sound interresting. Looking forward to see what specs they will
have besides from the 'mysterious super chip' :-) Maybe we should gather a
team to get involved with AI to support and develop on the video/sound
production side as they have stated they will target as well..

Hello Daniel,

CDDA fileformat is no problem to support, besides RAW format CDDA is the
most simple format to support as there is no header to handle. MAUD is
noted. I think I have some docs on that somewhere on the HD.

I'm speaking too fast.. CDDA is of course stereo and then the limitations

Re: My post of 6/2:
<<  Again, today I mastered another "coaster", as 3 of 8 files were corrupt on
the CD, and I can see no pattern as to why this occurred, as they play
perfectly in Stu16. >>

Ok, I got some answers today...

Rick Giannini (sp?) of Asimware told me to download "Play16.lha" from aminet.
This program will play a multitude of audio file formats thru the Amiga's RCA
audio output  jacks.  With the appropriate options enabled, you can load and
play (RAW) CDDA files and check them prior to a CD burn (exactly what Kenny
has just volunteered for Stu16).  I did this with both my corrupt and good
files and learned that "MasterISO" introduced errors during the conversion
from AIFF to CDDA.  Rick then asked me to send him an example of the the
good/bad files for inspection, and then mentioned that they did have some
problems converting MONO files to CDDA.    No sh_t !!  I'll give ya one guess
what my corrupted files are...

BTW, "MasterISO" v2.1 is due out in about two weeks, and should address this
problem.

I think AI are going to need reminding about a few things if the new
Amigas are to be any use at all for creative work. At present they
seem to have their eye firmly on the consumer living-room home cinema
market. For instance, I think the emphasis will be on playback of
Dolby Digital Surround (very nice, certainly) rather than on 20-bit
recording or good MIDI facilities.

I believe Marc Albrecht has had trouble supporting MAUD as the format
was changed without clear documentation.

The ASIM CDFS folks allow you to read (covert) cdda from CD's to Stereo
.aiff or Left & Right .aiff.
You may consider contacting them. They are long time Amiga supporters.

 http://www.asimware.com/index.html

I have been able to copy Left & right tracks to Ram: in Aiff and load
them into Sudio 16.
I suppose others have as well. This doesn't work as well to my harddrive
as click tend to get
imbeded in the sample data.

Hi Don,

I guess most professional want the option of choosing its sound/midi
hardware themself. If AI implements some hardware they also take the risk of
outdating themself or mis the market and it increases the cost. A pro would
probably buy own hardware anyway. IMHO.

Hi Brrr and all,

just to clearify: I am not willing to promise any new filters as I work with
almost no documentation (just a structure). I just try to get an overview on
what is wanted and see what I can do. Right now I got loaded with work I
have to prior as I need to feed stomacs and pay bills. ;-)

I have already created tools to convert CDDA images to Studio 16 format (in
the Studio16add.lha package [CDDA2Studio] ), but not directly from CDs
though.

Thanks, I can hear with them it they want to adapt the Studio 16 format as
well.

That would be a job I could enjoy. Don't think I could quit my day job
any time
soon though. No where is that lottery ticket........ let's see Jackpot ==
$17millionUS
I think that could get me a small team and a sound blaster 16 card :)
I'm sure one of the other sound card makers like delfinia must be looking
into this already. As soon as AI can give us some concrete specs on the
buss and interface, we can definitly take a swing at it.

yes, Yes, YES!   We need developers!  I want to be able to be using
the new kick-butt Amiga to create cool music and video, not sit on the
couch and WATCH IT!

This should be the computer everyone at NAB and NAMM shows sees and
says "I have GOT to get me one of THESE!!!" (think of Will Smith in
the movie Independance Day).

I hope they don't decide to concede all the CREATION of the cool A/V
stuff to the Macs and PCs and relegate the Amiga to PLAYBACK only!
Isn't it still going to be "the computer for the creative mind"?

Well, that's what I want. (We all like to think we have creative
minds!)
I think they envisage any Amigas in towers with slots being made by
third parties such as Access (Index). I am really concerned to make
sure they don't make decisions which prevent the development of a
stunning big machine with PCI (and maybe also Zorro II) slots.

They must sell a lot machines to make money, so some decisions will be made
which we Amigans do not like.
But we have no choice i think, when i bouht my first Amiga 11 years ago, an
Amiga 2000A, i had a mean machine, then.
I now own an Amiga Classic (what's in a name).
When AI comes with a new mean machine in 1999, what's the problem ?
We can provide AI with much info and wishes, so they can build a user machine
for the Amigans.
Audio en Video will be provided, and when PC or Mac Hardware and software can
run on this machine under an Amiga OS, that's fun.
Nice Hardware and Software without W95/98, great.

$VER: SuperModel 1.1 (04.06.98)

Copyright (C) 1998 by Digital Surface/Kenneth "Kenny" Nilsen.
All rights reserved.

SuperModel is a patch for Studio 16 that patches some functions in the
gadlib.library of Studio 16 v3 system. The purpose is to enhance the look
and feel.

Features
	- New REQUESTERS. Forcing Studio 16 to use standard intuition
	  requesters instead.

	- Thin lines on window top border, some boxes (such as in the
	  mixer), and other places.

How to install:

	- Copy the file to C:
	- Edit your "s:user-startup" and add the following line:

	  run >nil: supermodel

[You will need Studio 16 v3 properly setup with assign Studio16_3:libs/ and
the gadlib.library here.]

That's it! It you want to quit SuperModel you can send a CTRL+C signal to
it.


HISTORY

1.1	- Added patches for requesters AskUser() and TellUser(). Uses
	  intuition/EasyRequest() instead.
1.0	- First public release. Bundled with mus/play/NewPlay.lha

Greetings,

Just discovered this mail-list.I've been searching for any info on Sunrise
stuff for ages with little sucess. Then a couple of weeks I found mention of
this list in an english mag. I've been using my S16/A3000 for about 5 yrs. I
had all but lost hope in finding anyone still using or interested in a
system that has served me well.

I hve one minor/major problem. My AD516 fell over 6 mths ago and wont get
up. I got the tech at work to scope it out and he tells me that the
CS4215-KL ES chip ( It has a graphic that looks like an E on it ) is the
root of the problem.
So I guess the question is, what is it, where can I get it. Looks like a bit
of a challenge to replace. Does any one trustworthy still service Sunrise
hardware.

any help with that one would be greatly appreciated.



.            Jessey

There is going to be something called the Pre Box that has four PPC
chips in it that will supposedly connect to an Amiga externally. This
should be coming out at the end of the year. I have forgotten where it
is, but there is also a site with a photo of the new Amiga  prototype
tower complete with a view of the new Workbench screen (very 3D and
colorful) and included audio speakers. All and all, very nice.

There will be completely new Amigas based on a yet to
be named "superchip", that will alledgedly be light
years beyond anything else in 1999. This is old news,
and the best thing for you to do is to go to the Amiga
Web Directory, new links and follow the links regarding
this and the AI announcements.

Better still, go to www.amiga.com and www.cix.co.uk/~index

But to summarise, there will be 

1. new motherboards from Access, with PPC processors and
(next year) enhanced compatible replacement for AGA chips

2. an Amiga card with AGA to go in a PCI slot in a PC, designed by
Access
and sold by Siamese; this combination will also be used as a "bridge"
setup for developing software for
3. a completely new computer from Amiga Inc, intended to replace
existing Amigas, using a new type of very advanced multi-media chip,
running existing software under emulation. ETA end of 1999, they hope.

4. another PPC machine called pre/box, from Phase5.
5. yet another, from Power computing, designed by DCE in Germany (who
designed the Wonder TV for the Asian market).

First release of 1 & 2 should be in the shops in September. 3 is a bit
vaporish at
present, IMO.
There is also the Access Amiga for kiosks etc, already available from
Paxtron.

Hello all! We need to determine what should be in place at the system
level for the next generation of Amiga audio. The approach should be
ambitious - the hardware will be there to provide for an imaginative
foray into both audio and video communication.

Ideally, the modern Amiga production environment should allow individual
modules/programs to operate as a single integrated application - without
compromising the learning experience, ease of use, or power for any tier
of use. The user should be offered intelligent defaults as well as total
configurability.

In past discourse it was agreed there was a pressing need for multiple
midi-ports. This would probably best be implemented via a common library
working in conjunction with vendor-supplied drivers. Existing hardware
hanging off PCI slots/standard ports including USB - can be exploited.

Similarly, we need audiocard support. AHI is a good step in the right
direction - but the old Amiga doesn't have a professional selection of
current-production soundcards. Yet PCI slots in the 1999 Amigas should
accept all cards made by specialist vendors in high-bit audio. The cards
presently available are affordable and capable of up to 24-bit specs.

(These solutions commonly perform synthesis, sample recording/playback,
nonlinear multitracking (music mastering and video support). Typical
professional cards have a breakout box that contains the interfacing and
ADC/ADC packaging, so as to achieve pro connects and audio performance.)

Not to get really detailed at this time, but we also need:

(1) a standard for audio plug-ins. Mac developers are just finalizing
their standard, as no official spec was established when plug-ins first
arrived by the hundreds (for ProTools). On the Winter front, a plug-in
standard has been defined and is already widely supported. We need one.

(2) system-level support for SMPTE, MIDI timecode, MIDI Machine Control,
and Word Clock protocols. This is desirable because Audio/Video-aware
applications can then share access to sync, and establish the necessary
master/slave hierarchy existing tools depend on. This can be dynamic.

(3) a patchbay module that stores "studio profiles" of midi-channels,
gear names, and the specific routing of all interfaced gear, and then
publishes to A/V-compliant applications. Each application then has
access to the profiles via standard hooks. This helps to organize a
setup, allows intuitive use, and minimizes redundant data entry. 

(4) a protocol that supports alternates control surfaces, to integrate
expressive gestures and snapshot/dynamic automation. Any A/V compliant
application should coexist with onscreen control modules. Check it out:

http://www.peavey.com/division/mi/keyboards/MIDIcontrollers/pc1600x.html

-- for an example of a dirt-cheap effective way to control lights,
editors, synths, samplers, drum-machines, mixers-on-a-card, non-linear
audio/video, etc. (Similarly, hardware-based audio/video gear should be
easily included as part of the environment.)

[The mouse should not be a virtual substitute for 199 different sliders/
knobs/switches/jog-shuttles when doing a job that traditionally requires
hands-on control. In a time-is-money environment it is a stumbling block
and it also stifles creative experimentation, and more dynamic music.]

Discuss? - Or should I assume we all believe the current metaphors in
Amiga musicware will suit the needs of the next millennium via emulation?

First question is: Who wants to compile a concensus of what we want to
see in the new Amiga OS regarding audio? Greenboy, you seem to have a
great start here... wanna do it?
Second: Who to send this to? ICOA? Amiga INC?

Yes, the reprogrammability of the MMC might be exploited in ways
other platforms can only dream of. Getting access to existing cards
currently used by the other platforms may be a different story. I
suspect it will be difficult to convince manufacturers to support the
Amiga. I hope I'm wrong. I hope some companies see this as a huge
opportunity.

Powerful, yet easy to use interprocess communications is a must. Arexx
is good but needs lots of updating even for the classic Amigas. The
new Amiga needs something similar, but of course, much more advanced.

Yes. Finally having access to so much industry standard stuff will be
delightful.

I've said it several times, DIGITAL AUDIO I/O!! Now with the
possibility of using the advanced stuff made for PC/Mac, it can
happen. We need to pull in some of these companies to at least
consider allowing Amiga libraries/drivers/applications to be created
to use their hardware. I would love to try to get Frontier Designs
WaveCenter card in a new Amiga, for example. Their card is just
digital I/O to ADAT or S/PDIF. If you don't have an ADAT or regular
DAT, they have a single rack space 8 channel A/D D/A box.

Possibly even system level support for the file types involved, too?
MIDI, Sample-Dump standard, all the audio file formats, etc.

This might be too much for inclusion into the OS, might be more likely
to be an application itself.

And better yet, go strait to the source at www.amiga.com
and www.amiga.de
Both are the official corporate sites of the new amiga.
Lots of additional info can be found at www.amiga.org
And have a look at some of the latest softwares at
www.amigaflame.co.uk.......... and lets see to stay up
to date from now on, get a subscription to amiga informer
at www.amigainformer.com, or CU-Amiga Mag at
www.cu-amiga.co.uk, or maybe Amazing Amiga Mag at
www.pimpub.com. Had enough yet? I have more. :)
There is to be a new machine and all new OS that will
run platform independant, we're told anyway.

Exactly. The port interface itself, whether you're talking a variation
of serial.device, or something slightly more cooked, should be kept as
simple as possible. The intelligence for MIDI protocols lives above that,
maybe as a library, or perhaps in a higher device layer. One of the
things I would like to see in the new AmigaOS is subclassable libraries
and devices, at least logically. So if they provide a system standard
device for "cooked" MIDI (which, via the OS, handles all the critical
protocol and timing issues for you), you would make your new MIDI device
as a subclass of this one, filling in just the routines that are
different. 

Another very simple but important concept is that, when you have lots of
ports for something, the user needs to be able to find them. The
original Amiga had very good device abstraction throughout most of the
system, but little notion this would ever be used. So, for example, when
Zorro cards with serial ports on them arrived, there were all kinds of
horrible kludges to let most terminal programs select the specific
serial device it wanted. Even when terminal programs learned to use
multiple ports, they each did it very differently. 

To do this right, each device in the system needs to be classed --
whether it's the formal class tree I imply above, or something looser,
doesn't strictly matter here. My MIDI sequencer should be able to call
up a standard system requester (in GadTools or some BOOPSI+ thing) and
ask for "list of MIDI devices", or "list of MIDI OUT devices". 

>(1) a standard for audio plug-ins.

Funny, I was just yammering on about this in my last message. We seem to
think alike -- this is good.

I actually look upon this as a "high level" MIDI device; basically, a
superset or superclass of the basic MIDI port. If implemented this way,
I could ask for "list of all MIDI devices" and see things (assuming I
put all my PC audio hardware on the new Amiga) like "MTPII port 0|MTPII
port 1|DrumKAT|AudioPCI port|JV-880|Quadraverb", etc. If I asked for
"list of all MIDI instruments", let's say, I just get the high level
stuff -- "DrumKAT|JV-880|Quadraverb", etc. Any old MIDI program could
hit any of the devices in "raw" (eg, it's just an old serial port" or
"cooked" (eg, it's handling MIDI protocol for me) mode. A program that
knows about the higher level model could pop up control panels for you,
hook into standard functions, if present (like effects, etc), perhaps
understand that the JV-880 is a synthesizer and the Quadraverb is an
effects box, etc. 

>(4) a protocol that supports alternates control surfaces, to integrate

Oh yeah, that's another big one no one's doing very well on computer yet
(ok, some dedicated systems). Especially with things like USB coming
along, where you don't really compromise your system by adding crazy
amounts of human interface devices, these things will happen. 

>Discuss? - Or should I assume we all believe the current metaphors in

The existing software was ok for what computers could do a long time
ago. It needs to take the lead now. In fact, this could be way more
critical than most Amiga people, fans and managers alike, might think,
simply because the music industry is much less married to any particular
platform than, say, the office automation industry. If music is done
much better on the Amiga than on the PC or Mac, people will use it. Most
of the time, music has unfortunately had to sit way back in the queue,
while video and games get the attention. Hopefully things can be done
right this time around.

This deserves a considered reply later, but my immediate reaction is
that the core requirement, which we can reasonably demand from AI, is
for an accurate central timing system so that all kinds of audio and
video events (in multitasking software) can be correctly synchronised.
System-wide SMPTE timecode, plus calendar plus video beam position, so
that
any software routine can know exactly what the time is down to about
1/15000 second. The time can be updated from an atomic clock over the
internet. 
Obvious complications are time zones and PAL/NTSC, drop frame, etc.,
but the core need is for sync.

You should be able to edit MIDI, samples, and video all at once,
perfectly locked together.
 
I don't see AI themselves having the resources to write loads of file
format filters, at least not until they have sold several million new
Amigas. Same for drivers for cards. These will have to be done by
specialists.

This looks like a really good device. Thanks for the info.
We may need to shout "MIDI" in Allan Havemose's ear quite loudly.

Seriously, a considered proposal from several peole on this list would

If this can't be done all else is moot. More than just synchronization,
midi events - before they hit a port - need to have rock-solid latency.
Variable latency screws up the feel of music, and allows for poor
queuing into midi's serial steam. It is bad enough that some instruments
out there flam when any polyphony demands are made, and do it with wide
variability!

Sounds nice. It needs to be designed to sit in well with breakout boxes
and external industry gear that provides synch, and word clock. Use of
these boxes will be the quickest, cheapest way to industry acceptance.


>Obvious complications are time zones and PAL/NTSC, drop frame, etc.,

I would think that PAL/NTSC concerns, as well as HDTV would be in the
domain of the graphics cards/subsystem. Should be a given?...

If "Mitchie" is as powerful as has been indicated, all these datastreams
should easily be manipulatable in real-time. Now _that_ is exciting!
When interface design, and use of alternate control surfaces starts to
facilitate this, the New AMIGA will have real leverage!

AmigaInc needs to see that proper datatypes are included for common
audio standards (sample formats, midi files/sequences) _immediately_ 
upon initial release of 5.0, if not somewhere during the 4.x interim
release. This is the only way to inspire confidence in potential users
and developers.

Card drivers are needed for at least a couple of the high-quality,
affordable cards - at the onset. Again: to be taken seriously, we need
to demand more excellence than we have been conditioned to expect during
the lean years. And this is all realistically achievable. If it can be
done elsewhere, it can be done here. We are Amigans, are we not!?  8*)

I set up the tooltypes on a copy of Play16 and called it Play16-CDDA.

I've been looking at (and listening to) CDDA files transferred
directly from CD to Hard Disk with AsimCDFS. With my Yamaha
CDR400, the transfer is always at full speed (6x in this case) and
AsimCDFS has no setting to transfer at 1x. 
So far as I can tell, the drive is not doing any error correction in
this mode. Some CDs which sound perfect through headphones on this
drive
give numerous errors when files are transferred. Other CDs transfer
perfectly.
I have a copy of the new version of Samplitude. With this, you can
zoom in to look at these files in detail. The clicks are individual
sample values which are apparently random numbers. So I am looking to
see if I can write a program to remove them. I can only code in ARexx,
but if the method works perhaps someone can redo it in assembler.
FFT is not the right method for removing this kind of noise, as it has
no defined frequency. You need to detect single anomalous values.

Agreed and fully achievable with modular based integration, standard and
extendable API. Lets get an overview what you professionals need and wants
and then lets start to create a suggestion on definiton of an API.

Interresting, I was thinking of something similar the other day. The system
should support some standard syncs (SMPTE/MIDI) and in addition have a
modular based custom callhook for sync.

>http://www.peavey.com/division/mi/keyboards/MIDIcontrollers/pc1600x.html

Nice!

Well, I would like to join in the discussion, but at this level I don't
think I have much to contribute with as I have very little experience with
what need there might be. Count me in when API is on the the menu :-)

Or one can do as Haynie and I have done - look for solutions elsewhere.
Because those solutions are available. If one can get beyond old habits
and prejudices those solutions are actually quite impressive and
satisfying. Which is not to say that either of us would not prefer to be
doing the tasks on a better OS. That is an obstacle for both the user
and the developer; dealing with a bad OS.

I've already quantified OS audio needs in a seven point list. Brevity
and order with the proper jargon. But I am not convinced that all data
is in yet. Thanks Joanne, Dave, Don, Kenny, and others who have posted
so far.

useful regardless of title or experience.

Exactly. The midiports should be capable of hanging off of any
appropriate port or the PCI buss, and the OS should handle all routing.
All modules/applications are written with this model in mind. This
allows programmers to concentrate on their program's quality/features,
and users to worry not a whit about software compatibility.

Ouch! I would think they would have done better. Sysex has often solved
sequencing problems with older gear; it's simply necessary for editor/
librarians. Some mixing gear depends on sysex as well. A must.

I want fiber optics. Ever check into Lone Wolf Technologies? Seriously
expensive and expansive. Slow serial midi can do big jobs, as long as it
is done over multiple ports attached to a much faster buss. But the
Sample Dump Standard makes obvious its shortcomings:  s  l  o  w  . . .

That is one I could see going either way - but the cards are so cheap
and capable right now, I would hate to see time wasted on software
capabilities via Mitchie that are less than cards currently possess. I
guess I would make sure every system has plenty of slots and that a good
card always ships with each one. Save Mitchie for the big stuff!

Being a dumb farmboy, I don't quite see what you mean ;)  But for even
hi-tech musicians/studios, dedicated rack-mount hardware will probably
continue to be desirable, so form-factor is not an issue, and a noisy
electronic environment is not such a problem.

I don't know that it is. SPMTE is just an audio output with a little bit
of processor behind it, and some I/O. OK, I won't be building a sync box
in my garage tonight, but all the stuff should be there in any beige box
of the day. All moot though; current breakout boxes can handle it all
economically if <pause> time is of the essence... <groan>

Beautiful Dave, beautiful! Just hearing you tell it makes me recall a
couple of bittersuite <sic> stories about roadtrips during the first
incarnation, and the several revivals that never got off the ground!
There was a lot of hoopla, but no paying audience ever saw a
performance. I'm sending your little reminisces on to friends who might
appreciate them...

On Sun, 7 Jun greenboy <greenboy@bigsky.net> jammed all night, and by
sunrise was overheard remarking:

They did arrive, but they didn't play the stadium, mostly small to
middle sized clubs. I remember once, the audience for one show was so
slow, I had a table up real close, a nice pint of Guinness by my side,
and the music was so sweet...

>(The Chickenlips was holed up somewhere watching TV with the captioning
>turned on, and counting his payoff loot.)

Well, true. See, they had this day job in TV -- production, I think, on
some sci-fi or game show or something. I didn't watch TV much in those
days. The band was definitely an after hours gig, but they might have
been taken more seriously if they didn't have to charge those TV-industry
ticket prices everytime you wanted pro-quality sound.

>DosMan PeeCee made occasional appearances in the ring, but until
>recently a tittering could be heard every time he bent over.

Crap yeah. Even the Chickenlips were a lower-priced ticket, and they
were playin' things in '89 or so that DosMan PeeCee didn't really think
about until '94 or '95. But once he got the groove, he was all over the
place, with really cheap tickets. And by then, the Chickenlips were only
playing these weird revival tours, like the Culture Club/Human League/
Howard Jones thing this summer, or worse yet, one of those
"drummers, bass players, and roadies from three 60s bands you almost
recall" things. But I digress...

>>As Dave pointed out, If the new Amiga came with MIDI as standard --

>Soundcard midi (internal GeneralMidi synth/sampler) can be had for $50-
>$100 and typically has 32 or more single oscillator synth voices,
>can sample in good 16-bit quality, includes a midiport that only needs

And at the semi-pro level, the market's going nuts with lots of
different 20 and 24 bit boxes, 8 in/out audio plus sync, digital, etc.
It's all driven by so many folks using ISA, then PCI -- in fact, much of
the PCI stuff is also on the Mac. My first (and practically only)
non-work use of the PClones has been for music, because I needed way
more hardware than I could afford, get supported, or even get on the
Amiga, and I simply didn't have time to design it all myself. All of
this stuff, however, can work in the PIOS One, and could certainly be
driven by AmigaOS or BeOS some day. No bridges burnt, "things can only
get better", as ole Howard might say.

>The performance is much better than classic Amiga sound.

The performance is getting scary-good. See, while the Soundblaster
dominated the low end, MIDI was there, and Windows gradually enabled
device-independent sound. So SoundBlaster, which had crappy sound (but
in today's high-end versions approaches "ok", even "decent" if you use
an external DAC), began to not matter. Lots of music companies notices
how many sound cards were sold, versus synthesizers. And that the damn
fools buying these PCs were settling for sound that wouldn't sell in a
$250 MIDI box. Some PC sound card companies also noticed this. So over
time, most of the actual music companies making real synthesizers for
the semi-pro and pro markets got into the sound card business. Roland
was one of the first (and, back when PCs were really too slow for MIDI,
they established the MPU-401 standard for MIDI ports, which used a
special ACIA with large input buffer to make up for the interrupt
latency problems -- something like 64 bytes of FIFO, versus the Amiga's
one). Today you have Yamaha (also responsible for the FM synth on the
crappy Soundblasters), EMU (acquired some years ago by the Creative Labs,
the SoundBlaster people), Kurzweil, Ensoniq (also recently acquired, at
least in part, by CL), various others. The Yamaha DB50XG MIDI card,
based on the guys of one of their modestly prices XG synths, is actually
better sounding than my (farily cheap) Yamaha keyboard, though not quite
in the league of my Roland synth, but with more voices. These cost
around $100 these days. Competition is a very good thing for such
markets.

>>There are thousands of hard-up musicians out there that can't afford
>>$$ for a clone plus instuments. I know because I'm one of them.

>Clones are really cheap to do midi on nowdays.

Shit yeah. Just about any PC clone you buy these days, even the under $
1000 kind, will do a halfway decent MIDI with 16 channels/32 voices.
Many will do more. They probably come with some basic but very usable
sequencing software, like one of the cheaper Cakewalk spins. You can add
a $20 cable to use the one built-in MIDI port. You'll pay a bit to add
more MIDI ports, quite a bit to add an 8x8 box like I have, but that's
the volume thing kicking in again -- after a certain level, it's not "PC
music hardware", it's "pro music hardware that happens to hook to a PC".
In fact, my 8x8 MIDI port hooks to a Mac easier than a PC, and with no
computer at all it can do all kinds of routing functions from the front
panel.

One aim in doing the PIOS One was to make a much better out-of-the box
music system than your average PC. And it's there, but primarily by
using techology developed for the volume PC market -- but just some of
the good stuff, and in ways PC folks won't think of.

>all getting away from the core standards of what the basic NG Amiga
>should have. The basic's should be covered before you talk about MIDI
>and SMPTE time problems etc.

My intention when starting (and later restarting) this topic was to
discuss what support needs to be in the O.S. for midi. Intelligent
design for system-level midi is of upmost importance - it is the
framework that will make an especially good applications solution, in
the long run.

MIDI and SMPTE time accuracy _is_ at the basic level of issues for the
OS. Without this, midi and pro-audio will not deserve a chance on the
new Amiga. Midi accuracy was a big contributor to the classic Amiga's
failure as a widely-used midi platform.

>Input is OK at 16 bit stereo, Output should always be 24bit stereo,
>number of playing channels shouldn't be an issue.

24-bit in both directions is where the professional audio world is going
to lay the keystone. Again, driver support for cards and externals is
the issue. The owner of the machine will make the purchase decisions on
how many channels, what sampling-rates, what I/O, and what DAC/ADC
is appropriate.

Good system design allows these options, and future expansion of
standards that come from the outside world. Let us not make the mistake
of marrying the approach to internal base-machine features.

>The standard system should only need stereo Input and output, however
>additional I/O should be quick, easy and cheap to add. Optical IO would
>be nice too though.

The OS support for audio should not be married to any particular
hardware decisions - that's my read. Remember, the hardware is going to
be coming from different vendors and bundlers. We just want to get the
OS support for A/V-compliance so that it is extensible and clean.

>Surround sound as standard, it's not brilliant but it is always a
>selling point.

Actually, surround sound is more than a selling point. It is necessary
as the pro industry gears up to do more and more of it. Specific tools
to mix surround are easy to come by as long as the OS handles timing
and nonlinear multitracking with precision.

>Just standard  MIDI in/out/thru ports, I know we need better, but the
>average home studio user will only use a couple of keyboards with a
>set-up that can churn out 24bit sampled audio.

Any $50-100 soundcard supplies midi. I don't know how much Mitchie, the
Magical Mystery Chip, is going to be set-up to do in terms of basic
sample/synthesis for basic non-music apps. But average consumers' only
familiarity with built-in 5-pin DIN connectors these days is nil. On the
Mac and Wintel boxes anyway. And many amateur musicians never get to the
point that they are aware of their soundcard's external capabilities -
just as many Amigans have never looked past mods.

>Everybody may have other views, but I think the XG standard should be

No need for the OS to tie itself to any one manufacter's XG or GM
variant. As the soundcard industry evolves, so shall we. This is a
purchase decision, not an OS issue. Good foresight when considering what
may be asked of drivers is what we need to consider.

One hopes. DSP support for effects plug-ins that operate in real time,
of course. No matter how much Mitchie can carry, I'm sure we'll be
asking for more.

>completely forgetting about what a basic set-up should have, remember

The basic machine that people buy is only a point of departure. Some
will take it here, some will take it there, with peripherals, cards,
software. We just want to make sure that the OS is capable of going to
these places without the gnarly consequences of poor planning.

The price of this entry-level box is up to the vendors.

There are plug-ins by the hundreds on the Mac and Wintel. Some do this.

I believe this is true of all the arts. In this age more than others.
The accumulation of tools, techniques, storage, and media, makes it
possible to examine, then replicate or synthesize or put a spin, on
past styles of presentation. Here's to variety!

Thanks for going there, Anthony. Hopefully it will work out for all of
us!

I have created a small survey I was hoping the citizens on this list will
take the time to answer. Basically the result of the survey will determine
future development of Studio 16 add-on's from my part. You will be anonymous
by default answering this survey.

The address for it is:

    http://www.bgnett.no/~kenny/survey.html

The survey will run until 15. of July this year. I will put out a reminder
every second week (if I remember.. :^).

It's important that you report to me if the form doesn't work with your
browser.


Thank you.

Yeah, the Mitchie thing can get a bit confusing: what is actually going
to be on that chip? Mitchie is custom, but its programmability allows it
to emulate "standard"?... Anyway, PCI will be there. So I could go
either way, on where the basic audio for non-music apps is coming from.

That would be real estate for not one, but a minimum of 2 (3 is better)
physical midi ports. But that isn't an OS support issue either. We'll
be bugging individual Powered-by-Amiga vendors for that. I'd just as
soon see the whole works (midiports & ground-level audio) supplied by
a PCI soundcard - so as to speed development which in turn should keep
costs down, and leave more headroom to Mitchie for doing the Wild Thing!
(But that's me, and not my decision.)

Probably so, I agree. I just don't see what it has to do with OS issues.
Unless I am mistaken, that stuff would be taken care of by individual
app modules. The whole thing I am trying to get at: a modern system
should have an OS that any A/V-compliant module can sit in, and share
information via the OS with all other modules.

The OS would handle all routing and priorities, and master-slave
relationships. All port-sharing issues of the past would be gone,
programs would all work with each other in real-time, and programmers
would not have to keep inventing their own versions of the wheel.
It would be possible to get new app-modules to market very quickly!

Agree. But it doesn't need to be closed-endian - that's why Audio and
Video need consideration in OS design. Nothing I've said in this topic
that I am aware of goes against having all of the hardware basics in
the box. I just want the vendors to not have it dictated to them by the
OS how they choose to do that. That gives more options in the future.

I'm trying to say that the OS should make your way, my way, other
people's ways - all available. And let the vendors do their bundling
based on market needs. The cheap machines can be really cheap, but still
totally expandable (cheap PC boxes are probably cheaper to get now than
service-heavy, warpable plastic a500/1200 style, overheating, wall-wart
infested octopus farms [I've expanded A500/1200 for clients]).

Good OS design - and box design that can use standard components - can
meet everybody's needs cheaper. The OS means fewer poorly-worked kludges
later; the standard box design means economy-of-scale manufacturing and
less board-level redesign just to fit different casings. And dealers
won't be fiddling with all the problems that A500/1200 designs cause,
like chips unseating and overheating.

The amendable Midi 1.x spec is here to stay unless everybody wants
MASSIVE hardware reinvestment. Things can be added to the spec but the
31.25K serial stays the same. Certain models of midi equipment have slow
processors onboard that makes the instrument(s) slow and variable in
their response to polyphony demands and Continuous Controller use.

>It doesn't matter how good the computer can process MIDI, the resulting

>equipment start can't handle it properly.

Timestamping, latency and queuing in the computer affects midi playback
and recording very audibly. Some sequencer software evolution has been
specifically approached to tighten up timing issues. (BTW, Amiga clocks-
per-beat have always been a step or five behind the Mac. I've seen
studies on timing that suggest that 480 or 960 [versus 192] actually
helps on a fast multi-port setup).

The other key to expanding midi to enjoy more accurate timing is to use
multiple midiports (even if you *don't* need more than 16 channels!) and
dedicate ports to gear that typically recieve heavy streams of data.
That way the gear is "reading" only data intended for it, and whatever
comparatively fast bus feeding the multiport box is being used, can send
near-simultaneous streams to each physical midiport.

Professionals who are doing lots of percussion, or doubling, or synching
with digital audio or live orchestras appreciate this. No more flamming,
flanging, phasing. And moving tracks a millisecond or two, forward or
back for feel, can actually be felt. Repeatably.

Whew! This is getting out of hand, the topic splits off, at least the
way I see it, as the scripting language thing isn't specific to a
proper implemantation of an A/V subset of the OS.

How about Carl's Sassenrath's REBOL? That should be a big part of Amiga
language discussion: http://www.rebol.com/ . He should have an Amiga
viewpoint if anybody does.

   In theory, ARexx should be that good, but the actual implementation
is not that perfect. It's somewhat inefficient; while it may run adequately
on a plain 68k system it's surprising to see that it does not gain as much
performance running on a 020+ system as it should. And ARexx isn't portable
either...

Greetings,

I've just joined this mailing list and sent one previous message, but have
recieved / observed no response. Which leads me to think that no-one got it.

I've been using my AD516 for about 5 yrs and though long in the tooth, it
has served me well.
My problem is that it ceased to work and I need to find some one who
services Sunrise hardware.

Any help greatly appreciated

PS I have worked in Pro Audio for 15yrs and follow with great interest your
discussions about the new Amiga OS.

.            Jessey

I don't know if these guys can help, but they sell used AD516s

Good point Paula, although something like this could probably be fairly
easily done using the joystick port. I wish I had the time/money to devote 
to all the hardware projects I'd like to plug into this machine.
Practical real world  I/O is a subject I've never found to be of great
interest in the user group discussions I have been involved in. (AAi
Atlanta) This ML is an exception to that somewhat.

I am constantly reminded in this discussion about the "dream platform" of
how many of the things that folks are suggesting would seemingly better be
served by hardware rather than software. PCI slots will have to be
supported by the next generation of Amigas.
Of course hardware is restrictive and software can always more easily be
added to. To my mind, there are a pretty definable number of real word
I/O options that could easily be incorporated into new hardware add-ons.

The flexibility of the Amiga OS is superior in my experience to any other
OS I've experienced. IMHO, The lagging of AmigaUS over the last few years
has still not taken the shine off *that* bouncing ball. I haven't interjected
much into the ongoing discussion as I believe that it will be resolved of
it's own accord in about eighteen months. . . . . . 16 bit sound, PCI,

That's Australia, right? I'd suggest tracking down dealers in your
country. They should be able to aim you at someone relatively local.
I can think of one guy from Au that might know. Next time he posts I'll
send him your way. I don't know if he's on this m-list but he is on a
couple of others I sub to.

I don't know where you came in at, but I am planning to present
something to ICOA and JMS once I get some more feedback/ideas. Right now
I've got it down to seven points, but that could change if I've
overlooked something. Jump in!

Good to see ya!

Greetings Paula,

>The relevance to the audio discussion -- I suggest someone design an
>breakout box with analog controls going to A/D converters into the Amiga

>>Discuss? - Or should I assume we all believe the current metaphors in
>>Amiga musicware will suit the needs of the next millennium via emulation?

Good point Paula, although something like this could probably be fairly
easily done using the joystick port. I wish I had the time/money to devote
to all the hardware projects I'd like to plug into this machine.
Practical real world  I/O is a subject I've never found to be of great
interest in the user group discussions I have been involved in. (AAi
Atlanta) This ML is an exception to that somewhat.

I am constantly reminded in this discussion about the "dream platform" of
how many of the things that folks are suggesting would seemingly better be
served by hardware rather than software. PCI slots will have to be
supported by the next generation of Amigas.
Of course hardware is restrictive and software can always more easily be
added to. To my mind, there are a pretty definable number of real word
I/O options that could easily be incorporated into new hardware add-ons.

The flexibility of the Amiga OS is superior in my experience to any other
OS I've experienced. IMHO, The lagging of AmigaUS over the last few years
has still not taken the shine off *that* bouncing ball. I haven't interjected
much into the ongoing discussion as I believe that it will be resolved of
it's own accord in about eighteen months. . . . . . 16 bit sound, PCI,
great speed, Amiga OS, SCSI3, backwared compatibility, and more . . . .

16-bit digital audio is sometimes massaged as it approaches the noise
floor because dithering somewhat hides resolution artifacts that become
obvious to the trained ear at low signal-levels. It is always better to
record so as to "hit the top bit" as much as possible - without of
course making earvious <sic> clip plateaus. (This is not unlike hitting
tape hard to stay above the noise floor - but digaudio is much less
forgiving when top level is exceeded.)

So it is not nice to mess with the levels in the digital domain,
especially in delicate passages. On the other hand, once in digital,
why convert back to analog (and later back again) once it is in digital?
Another trip through DAC/ADC = more distortion.

The best solution is to go to higher bits during tracking, mixdown, and
mastering. The industry is probably happy with 20- and 24-bits for the
time being, with math being done in 32 or higher when processing.
(Yamaha has a nifty new digital mixer on a PCI card by the way!)

Control surfaces for these types of environments either have to generate
high resolution signals over a fast peripherals bus, so as to have good
fades - or they can generate more economical data, and once it hits the
computer it can be interpreted to represent a higher resolution.

Using a midi control surface like the Peavey example I supplied a URL
for is entirely possible. The midi data for each slider is normally
7 bits (128 positions), but if the midi spec for least significant byte
is invoked, another 7 bits is used, bringing it to 14.

Then, the buffered digital audio can be massaged by sensing algorithms
that effectively take the "zipper effect" the lower control resolution
would normally induce, and smooth it near the noise floor. These type of
techniques have been used successfully for a number of years now.

Further - they allow a non-proprietary affordable technology to be used,
that can also be used for a myriad of other control purposes involving
audio or video or external things like stage lighting. (Though the whole
show control thing has gone off on some incredible tangents through the
years IMNSHO.)

We've already participated in the multi-monitor skirmishes, haven't we?
{-;  The truth is, for higher-end work, it is desirable to see more at
a time (and not cute little icons - actual data and status-indication!)
- AND to have hands-on panels. You wouldn't fly a scoutship with a
mouse, would you?... The tasks we are talking about are *that* way--

I can vouch for Hal also. I bought a used A3000 from him and it

I don't think they can. A friend of mine contacted them
at my suggestion a few months back concerning an AD516
that has something wrong with it. They informed him
they couldn't help him. Perhaps something has changed,
who knows...

Yes Hal Greenlee is a very good amiga service person. I have worked
with him before and received parts from him when I repaired some of my 
own equipment. He once sent me some accel and addon cards he couldn't
or didn't want to repair. They now have homes in my equipment :)
I do not know if he repairs sunrize cards. I do know that
he asked me once if I could repair them. I told him the same......
" I can have a look and probablly do it if parts are available"
I then ask what was wrong with his card. He said "Nothing, I just wanted
to know if someone was able to repair them if I need it for me or my
customers"
Not word for word, but you get the ideal. I thought it was an odd
conversation
at the time. :) But you can check with him and see how his AD repairs are
doing.
Holler if you still need help and I'll try to fix it for you.
 (see earlier message if you havn't already)

Maybe I could help.
I think I saw your message the first time, and I suspected some one
might have replied with info to help you. I guess no one has. There is
no official (or unofficial) repair center for sunrize cards. Have you
already tried the normal Amiga repair centers? Maybe one could help.
I can send you information on some of them. If you have tried that 
already and all have turned you away unable to work on them, then I will
offer my assist as a last resort. I have repaired most every thing at one
time. My repair resume is longer that e-mail will allow :) At one time,
repair centers sent their repairs to me. If you sent your C= or amiga in
for
repair in the south east USA, it may have been repaired by me. If you
took
your clone pc monitor in for repair in the same area... yup me again.
Checks you wrote may have been processed on machines I repaired
Sadam may have lost planes and tanks on hellfire missle circuits
I helped build, test and repair. I wonder.... anyway...... the list goes
on.
I have since "retired" from repairs to concentrate on networking and 
programming, but I occasionally fix equipment for myself and friends.
Normally these days it is easier to replace than repair, but some amiga
equipment is an exception to me. Like surize of course. If you have no
where else to turn, I can take a look and see if it is some thing I can
help
with. First tell me what is going wrong. Possible we can fix it through
e-mail first.

troy

Hi all,

amidst the heated theoretical arguments I'd like to suggest a look
at a probably important hardware point concerning the AD516 cards,
which may affect us all, though some more than others. When comparing
the recordings made by several AD516s I found that the zero level
(i.e. recording silence) is usually anything but zero. Depending on
the card, the recorded data varies from $FF60 to $0140 which is
an awful lot of difference. Interestingly, the left and right channels
usually also differ strongly. The problem here should be obvious. If
the zero levels don't get recorded precisely, every time you start
and end the playback of a sample, you get a click. The bigger
the difference from zero, the louder it will be. If you work with
longer recordings, this problem affects you less, but if you work with
a lot of short samples which is usually the case in audio for video, this
can hit you bad. As our AD516s get older, I guess we may expect this
problem worsening. Is there anyone out there with some firm hw knowledge
who may suggest how it might be possible to compensate for this problem?
Installing trimmer pots in the signal path somewhere, or something?
The result of several experiments is that cards perfom in almost
precisely the same way when installed in different Amigas, i.e. $FF80
for example will always stay very close to $FF80, so this problem
comes definitely from the AD516s and not from surrounding equipment.

Best wishes,
Zsolt Kovacs

Funny you should bring this up, Zsolt...I brought up the gain on my card after
experiencing clicks on the left input.  Tried different grounding schemes,
different mixers as sources, and concluded that as there isn't any noise
recorded, I simply will keep the gain on the card at 0 (making sure my mixer
does the amplification) , and "scale" in & out points to 0-100%-0.  When I
disconnect the input to the card, the problem disappears (But so does my
program source.)  As I look at the waveform, it looks like a so-called 'DC
Offset," and I seem to remember somehow, a way to rid that from a signal,
perhaps in other software??  Anybody know about this?

I've faced the problem., and to bypass this problem I have made a
little program to compensated this offset. If you are interrested by
the software, let me know.

Thanks for bringing this up, Zsolt.  I've noticed this, and to me the recorded
waveform displays as what may be a "DC-offset", and I seem to remember that
you can filter that out.  I've come across this before, but can't remember
where.  Anybody??

SFX has a "middle" operator to fix this problem, and Samplitude will
do it as follows:
1. draw a range box whose height is the DC offset, width doesn't
matter
2. do Shift Up (or Down)
The whole sample shifts by the height of the box. This gives you more
control than the SFX method.

 But it would be best if the hardware could be calibrated to work 
accurately.

SFX has a Slide Operator as well. Just click into the sample or mark
something and note the values in the range window, then enter the
y-offset into the slide (with a - in front to korrekt the offset)

I, for one, am interested in your software. I imagine that others here
will also be interested. If you would be so kind as to email a copy to
me directly (my address is at the bottom of this message...DON'T post
it to the mailing list). If you are willing to share this with a larger
group than just subscribers to this list, you might consider sending it
to Pauli Porkka for inclusion with the other AD516 software on his
excellent soundcard support webpage (http://www.sci.fi/~pporkka/).

Thanks for your offer!

To tell the thruth, I am working at full capasity right now (actually a bit
more too..). I will take the summer off in a couple of weeks and have the
survey running. After that I will determine what I will give a priority
then based on the survey results. But if anyone dying to send me money just
send them - I don't mind! 8*)

I have added a help page to the survey which explains the options in the
priority section. I also added approximatly USD currency.

The survey will as mentioned determine further development for Studio 16 so
if you haven't already answered please go to this page:

        http://www.bgnett.no/~kenny/survey.html

The survey will stay open till 15/July/98. Results will be posted here.

Thank you.

Joystick port? Can we assume that the new Amiga will have one? If so,
will it still be the same kind on the current Amigas or be more
advanced? I understand they (Dr. Alan Havemose, et al) are seriously
considering USB. If USB 'happens' on the new Amiga, there probably
won't be many other seperate ports at all. This could be great, and it
could also be a problem. I honestly don't know how well USB would work
with this sort of thing, or MIDI in general. We need to contact him
soon to make sure they are considering MIDI and these interesting I/O
items in their USB decision. We could be stuck with an I/O
architecture that makes an even worse mess with MIDI than the original
Amigas.

>From a IRC log where Dr. Havemose answered questions, it appears they
are going to rely on IEEE 1394 (Firewire) and maybe USB for most of
the I/O.

Q: (elp) Will the new systems have SCSI, USB, FireWire and/or other standard technologies? Will
TCP/IP be built in to the OS?
A: (Havemose) I'm planning on full TCP/IP stack. I would prefer just to go with Firewire for network
connectivity. I haven't made a decision on USB for that reason. Let me correct myself. 1394 for device
and low-cost network. 

Q: (eaglelil) Dr. H: Will use use USB in the new Amy for KB, mice, etc 
A: (havemose) I have USB on my "open question" list. I do want to use 1394 for devices and networking. 

I was hoping ethernet was going to be included since it's so
pervasive a standard, but that's a different topic. I haven't looked
around for what's new with USB for a good while, but last time I
checked, no one was even considering a MIDI interface for USB.
This could be either an interesting opportunity, a hindrance, or
nothing at all (USB not involved). Anyone know if USB would be good,
bad, or indifferent regarding MIDI? 
1394? 
How about either for digital audio?

Searching this Q&A session for any mention of audio and MIDI only
finds this:

Q: (Darklite) 
1 Will the new Amiga( 1999 ) be able to use PC cards (PCI, AGP ) or will it feature a whole
new bus system ? 
2 Will you support the PPC ports of AOS 4& 5 ? 
3 Can you already give some more info on the "SuperChip" ? 
A: (Havemose) the new system will support PCI. I gave my position on PPC earlier. The new superchip
 (who came up wiht that name anyway?) is a very high performance processing unit with multimedia
functions. A couple of numbers: 400 Mpixels/sec out of the 3D engine. This 24 bit pixels with full
tri-linear mip mapping. 3-4 MPEGII decode simultanious, AC-3 audio.

Nothing about MIDI at all. We DEFINITELY need to get our ideas and
needs in Dr. H's face soon and clearly and often. I heartily agree
that this is an area the Amiga could truly excel in, AND have a good
chance of dominating IF it gets the proper emphasis in the design of
the new OS. If they want digital convergence, here's a great
opportunity.

I guess I should have been clear that I was speaking of the existing fix
on Paula's machine.
There were numbers of "second mouse port" hacks and helps in the Fish
collection. One old one was called Port2.

Good question. The actual date of the Q & A isn't on it. It was posted
to the Amiga Web Directory on June 6.
Here's the URL:

SFX and Samplitude are complete editing program, I think it is over kill
to load this program only to recalculate a DC offset.

Hey All,

I installed the Studio16 patch SuperModel in de the C directory of my
2.04 kicked Amiga 3000.

I put the line mentioned in the readme file to the User-startup.

After i restarted my computer and load studio16, nothing changed.

I think it's my old ASL.Library.

I put a newer one in de Libs, after that my Amiga 3000 did not boot properly
anymore, so i reinstalled the old version of the ASL.library.

My question, is Supermodel compatible witk kick 2.04 and Wb2.1

Thanks in advance,




Rene'(DSP) Schaap

Ok,

Here a weird question for the Studio16 Mailinglist.

I have an Amiga 3000 with Kick 2.04, it used for Audio (AD516) and Midi.

I now have my Amiga 4000/040 upgraded to kick 3.1.

Can i upgrade my  Amiga 3000 with those old A4000 kick 3.0 chips ??????.



SeeYaa

No, you can't. Sorry, there are some major hardware differences between the
two that have specific ROM routines. Also, as far as I know, there never was
a 3.0 ROM created for the 3000, only a 3.1 ROM.

Good luck,

I would guess not, unless you don't mind giving up the SCSI driver in
favor of a useless IDE driver.

What version do you have ?

SuperModel requires kick 2.04 or better, but require v38 of asl.library.
This is no problem to fix of course. The reason why is that it uses a
special tag for v38 of the asl.lib.

An update will arrive soon.. thanks for reporting!

I am (We are) currently thinking about a new standard.

This will be a media stream concept with several kinds of modules (plugins).
Thos stream can transport any kind of data. All streams will be synchronised by
a timing master.
I'll dicuss the design with
    Dave O'Reilly (SoundProbe)
    Marc Albrecht (ACT/Samplitude Opus)
    Martin Enders (Camouflage)
and some more.

The aim of the project is that we audio developers not working against each
other. Only by working together we'll have a chance to push the amiga back to
the current standarts and maybe a bit beyond.
I'll let you know when the design is clearer.

Stefan

Excellent plan. My dream is of editing MIDI, audio and video with
perfect sync. (I see the latest version of Movieshop has bad sync
bugs).
The timing should be genlockable and also the computer(s) should be
able to send or obey SMPTE code.

Hi, 16ers;

I'm having a problem with my system I haven't seen before and I'm stumped.
Here is the system:
 
A3000, 8 megs fast, 2 chip, Studio 16 board, Quantum 880 Fireball, Quantum
1280 Fireball. OS 3.1.
 
The system has worked flawlessly for as long as I have had it, and in fact
it's still working fine, but I just bought a new Quantum 4.5 gig Viking I
drive and I have found that I can't get ReOrg to defrag it, whcih means
it's no good for digital audio.
 
My first thought was that I simply need more memory, but after playing
around I don't think so. I found that if I partitioned the 4.5 gig drive
into blocks the size of my existing drives I still get the
not-enough-memory error. I even tried this: I put 6 megs of files into
RAM:, leaving me with about 1.5 megs of fast mem and then tried to
reorganize my 1280. No problem!
 
According to the official support website there is no support for ReOrg
anymore, so I emailed Holger Kruse and he told me this:
 
>The memory requirements depend on the geometry (i.e. track size
>and number of tracks). I don't think HDToolbox lets you adjust
>those, but some other disk prep tools do, e.g. RDPrep.
 
 
I tried RDPrep but it is way over my head as I don't know what's going on
with the system at this level. Needless to say, I don't know what to make
of this. Do any of you understand what I might have to do to get this
working?
 
I have a PowerPC 180mhz that the drive works fine on but the sound quality
of my old Amy with the Studio 16 just BLOWS the PPC out of the water! I
wanna use this drive on the 3000!
 
Could someone please suggest something?

Thanks,

      Rick Adams/benboom@teleport.com

Hey Rick, before I read any farther into your post: Are you aware that
AmigaDos/FastFileSystem 3.x and under will not format or work with a
disk size beyond 4 gig (4096 meg)?

One solution: Using HDToolbox, format/partition the drive no farther
than 4095 meg.

Second: Go to Amiga International's website and download the FFS there.
It will go beyond the 4 gig limit. ReOrg and other tools still will only
work in address space below 4 gigs however.

Yes, I know about the 4 gig limit. The problem is that Reorg barfs even
if it thinks the drive is an 850 meg unit! After I had no luck with
conventional HDToolbox small partitions I copied the RDB's off my 850
and wrote them to the 4.5G just to see what would happen and still got
the memory error. In any case, Holger told me that Reorg couldn't
recognize PARTITIONS larger than 4 gigs...

I'm guessing that I need to find someone who understands the nuts and
bolts of setting up one of these drives in HDToolbox, and that someone
is NOT me!

Thanks for the hint, but I gotta keep looking...

People on the Draco/VLM list, who have been involved with this problem
for a while, reckon 3995 Megs is the safe limit for ordinary FFS.

Okay, but I have tried using a variety of sizes for this drive all the way
from two partitions of 2.2 G each down to ONE partition of only 850 Megs
(talk about a waste of space!:-) with the same result.

I am convinced that all that stuff I don't understand like mask and max
transfer plays a part in this, but until now all my drives have worked
fine with the info that HDToolbax reads from them straight out of the box.
I can generate lists of the RDB's and a mountlist for the old an new
drives with RDPrep and compare them; there are differences but I don't
know what to look for and I can't find anybody who does. There's one store
here in Portland that sells Amigas (still!) but they don't know what I'm
talking about.

It's frustrating because here is this ancient 3000 which can beat the
pants off of a new PowerMac (and the Mac is running ProTools, to boot) and
I can't use it unless I delete the stuff I want to use it for. :-(

Folks, some of you HAVE to be using large drives. How are you defragging
them?

Thanks,

By HDToolbox count, I've been running at 4095 and change, since January.
No problems; I tested thoroughly before committing to that.

I suspect the 3995 is a belt-and-braces figure. I presume you have
filled up the top partition in your tests?
It's all to do with thousands and 1024s and I can't be bothered to do
the maths right now; I expect you're right, though.

For ages I have had problems with Bars&Pipes crashing on startup on
one of my machines. This has a Picasso card, CGFX r70a, and the B&P
icon is on Leave Out.
I finally fixed it by changing the name of the B&P directory from
"Bars&Pipes Professional" to "Bars&PipesProfessional", without the
space.
It seems that somehow B&P has problems starting up from a directory
with a space in the name. Other programs are OK, as is B&P on the
other machine.

------------------------------------------------------------

Yes; I use Norton Speed Disk on it with no problem. The drive seems to
work fine on the Mac and I guess I'll just keep it there, but I bought it
for the 3000. Now I think I'll have to try to find a used Quantum 1.2, but
that's next to impossible. They don't even sell drives that small any
more. 

I wish I knew if the drive's size is the problem or if something else is
at work here.

Another question, this one not about drives: today I tried to bounce
tracks internally for the first time. I've had this system for three years
and never needed to do this, which the manual *says* is possible, but I
sure can't get it to work. The manual is very vague, saying only that you
need to set the input of the final track to the output of the timeline. No
possible combination of settings gives me a sample with anything in it...

I think most people with drives that big don't have as little RAM as you

I haven't seen that problem, but I have seen a few problems that seem to
be 060-related:

1) Sometimes B&P will hang during its initialization while displaying the
license information.  It eventually wakes up, but usually it takes several
minutes.  After that it seems to work OK.

2) The One-Stop Editor, when activated as a B&P accessory, fails to read
the current configuration from the OSMS.  Attempts to change settings
screw things up due to using a bad starting point.  The separate One-Stop
Editor does not have this disease.

3) (On-topic at last)  Starting Studio16 directly reliably crashes in some
circumstances that I haven't determined, but I've never seen it crash when
started as a B&P accessory.

I *think* problems 1 & 3 may happen only on the CSMkII and not the CSPPC,
although that also involves switching between 16MHz and 25MHz and
switching Buster revisions.  Problem #2 seems to be happen in either 060
case.

That's what I figured, too.  The real limit should be exactly 4 gig,
provided that you mean binary gig (2^30) not decimal gig (10^9).  Since
it's possible that having the updated address wrap around after the
transfer might cause confusion, 4 gig minus 1 block would be safer.  Then,
since most things like to work in terms of cylinders, that might have to
be reduced to the next lower cylinder boundary.

Some dumb drivers might have problems going past 2 gig, but I don't know
of a specific case of that.

You should be able to find a keymap editor somewhere on Aminet. I
haven't used one for ages, but basically they allow you to define a
special keymap, like US or GB. You can even map a command such as
running a program to a key.

They don't make 8 UKP notes - it has to be 10.

Greetings Rick,

What I did with my 9 Gig (used the SCSIconfig program from Phase5 - but you
have to do the calculations for blocksize and sectorsize on a piece of
paper....argh!). Then formatted the first partition. Then I built the other
two Dosdrivers from my calculations, rebooted, and selected the other two
NDOS?? disks and formatted them.

The 9 gig was formatted into three approximately 3 Gig partitions.

It does with B&P (tested). If PAR uses Studio 16's SMPTE mechnism it will
control that as well.

Sorry about that. In my eager I converted all sums on the fly. Anyway, with

Remember that for normal Amiga use it is practically never necessary
to defragment a hard drive partition. Windows and Mac are different.

Audio editing is just about the only use I can think of that would
need this regularly, and then only if you are keeping your sounds on
the HD for a while. Can you not back up your sound files to CD and
delete them from the HD? Any smaller files can then be copied to a
Zip, everything deleted, and away you go again with a clean disk.
As defrag usually takes ages, this might be a faster solution as well.

Of course if your audio files are bigger than 650 Megs, you will have
to find some other medium for backups.

You can now, with the SMPTECTRL program. The program can control any
SmpteSink of Studio 16 including SMPTEOuput. From scala you just issue an
arexx comand like:

 address command 'SmpteCTRL play setsource "SMPTE Output"'
 address command 'SmpteCTRL stop'
 address command 'SmpteCTRL setsmpte "00:01:12:11"'
etc.

The SmpteCTRL is no hack, but uses Studio 16 library calls to achieve this
control.

SMPTEOutput must of course be running so Studio 16 is aware of this sink.
Read the other message with information about SmpteCTRL.

This is what I have to do. Some of my projects can use up
100-200 meg with out a problem. So I can't keep several projects
on the HD at one time. I back up constantly to tape ( a good ideal for
any project, sudio or not), clear the space and do new projects. 
Before I did it this way, I was always recording and deleting older
stuff, but I would eventually run into problems dropping tracks
because of fragmentation. Since the backups and cleansings,
no problems. I tried defraging a few times, but as mentioned,
it took ages and didn't always help much.

I myself have plenty of ram but I cannot for the life of
me understand why anyone would even have a partition of
some of the sizes mentioned here. Personally, I would
not have a partition larger than 500MB as the most.

My God it that were to get corrupted using FFS and have
to be repaired even a 500MB system would take hours to
repair. It would take days to repair a 2GB, 3GB, 4GB
partition that many obviously have. I just don't understand
why anyone would have a partition of that size. Very few
things would require anything like that, plus if the partition
goes bad and cannot be repaired or recovered, you've lost
everyting if you haven't backed it up. I prefer to keep 
things on smaller partitions and if one gets screwey I've
lost much, much less. I've never understood this and never
will. I've seen people get a new 4.0GIG drive and format
it into one partition...it just doesn't make good sense to
me. I know audio and especially video can require lots of 
space, but still this more than likely could be worked out
using smaller partitions. Anyway, just my thoughts!

Only if you use Disksalv. Quarterback Tools (old version) is much
quicker.

BTW has anyone got a version of QB Tools DeLuxe that works? Mine gives
up after doing a part of the drive with some message about Cannot get
cache. I cannot get any answer from Quasar on the phone or email.

I sort of agree about partition size, but audio files can be very big
- 200 Megs or more. Then you need Samplitude project files, maybe a
backup or two, and so on. Big partitions with big block sizes are
useful for this stuff.
Image projects can be quite big too, if you are working at print
resolutions.
But for normal Programs partitions, yes 600Meg is big
enough, and fits on a CD for backup.

I'll take a copy too if some one can find out if they can still be
purchased,
or float me a loaner if it can't be bought :)

Oh yeah, I forgot about the 1 meg 3d rendering partion you may need.

Partioning at 500 is fine but......

some day when your projects grow up :)......
it will be easy to see how you can use that much space.
To burn a complete stereo CD you need a 680meg partion
to work with already. Now add in tasks that are 5 minutes of 8 tracks
in 44khz recordings * about 4 task that are about 120meg per task
you can see the numbers ballon. I use a 1.1gig + a 850meg
HD on my 3000 and if I clear the HD once in while with a back-up
to make room for other projects, I just do get by :) I could
fill a 4 gig in a week and still have to go to back ups.

You are right here. Make a separate system, recording, and maybe
CD burning partitions. Files and Os one the first. Big Block the second
for faster recording access, and what ever the CD images need for the
thrid.
One big partition with studio16 is not the best way to go.

Hi Dan,
don't waste any time or money on new keymaps or new keyboard. I've had
the same problem several times on various keyboards and there's a simple
solution that consists of two steps.
1. You can take apart the whole keyboard which is about an hour altogether
(most of which is spent taking out and putting back the countless tiny
screws, don't lose them!) and put the printed circuit board into the
bathtub or under the tap. This will clean away the accumulated dirt.
Dry it, and then put it together again. There's good chance that your
key will still refuse to work. Then comes the second step.
2. On the fully assembled keyboard, take off the plastic cap of the key
that's still not working. You'll see the light grey end of the rubber
that makes the contact. In the center, there's a whole. Take a tiny
screwdriver and put its tip into the whole until you feel it touches
the bottom. Move it around carefully for some time (it's best if your
computer is turned on at this stage so you can immediately see the
results) and you'll soon see that the key will start working again.
I've brought back several completely 'dead' keys reliably with this method.

Hope this helps. (By the way, EditKeys from Aminet is a good keymap ed.)

Whenever I have checked an Amiga HD to see if it needed defragging
there has been so little fragmentation that it isn't worth doing.

Windows I think mainly messes up the HD by using it for virtual
memory. The Mac also does virtual memory, but it seems to fragment
files anyway. Even back under System 6, the drives needed defragging
regularly. You are also supposed to re-install the Mac OS at regular
intervals (at least once a month), and there is the desktop file to
rebuild as well.

I don't know enough about Windows to know whether you can make it do
all its VM in one designated partition, which would help. If you set
up a general VM program on Amiga, you would designate a partition. But
on Amiga, the programs that really need VM do it themselves with a
simple file system that works without an MMU. IMO a system-wide
virtual memory is a bad thing.

Fragmentation isn't the only issue, since it only describes contiguity of
the *unused* space.  It says nothing about the contiguity of individual
files, or other positioning issues that impact performance.  I see
noticeable speed improvements after ReOrg even when fragmentation was
quite low.

There are often more efficient application-specific ways of doing VM.  But
*if* you're going to use simple-minded MMU-based VM, then implementing it
once for the whole system makes more sense than repeating it in each
application, especially on a system that lacks standardized ways of using
the MMU cooperatively.

Did you check the buffers setting on your big drive? My Oktagon SCSI by default
sets up an enormous amount of buffers (1400 or so) which I didn't notice until
I saw that my available ram had dropped. You may have so many buffers allocated
that the defragmentation can't occur.


BTW, Ami-Back Tools, if you can find it, is the best disk utility.

No, I think you're wrong there. For instance, I just checked with
Quarterback Tools, and it reports 
Fragmented files: 233 out of 2,958
File fragmentation: 0.08%

Is this specifically for audio mixing? That is what I would expect to
be the most sensitive application. Optimisation to reduce seek times
must help, certainly.
And are you talking about Amiga drives or other OSs?
Let's hope that faster drives and buses make this problem go away
soon. I get the impression there will be Macs with Firewire buses on
the motherboard before very long, but I haven't seen a Firewire hard
drive anywhere as a commercial product.

Yes you can, although the default under Win95 is to have the swap file
on drive C: and to let Windows handle the size.  The problem with this
is that the size of the file can shrink and grow from 0 megs up to the
available room on the drive / partition and because of this it becomes
fragmented quickly.

Anytime I work on a system I always setup a minimum size for the swap file

( anywhere from 50 to 200 megs depending on the size of the drive ) and
let the maximum be the remaining available space.  That way all the  swap
file info is always written to the minimum protected space and never
shrinks
and rarely grows. ( but can grow if need be )

And on some systems, like my home machine, I have a separate drive
partition
F: that contains the swap file, a TEMP and TMP directory, and all the
cashe, temp,
and history directories for web browsers.

OK, but statistics like that still don't give you enough information to
accurately assess performance impact.

I was talking about ordinary use - running programs, opening windows, etc.

AmigaOS.  Remember AmigaDOS uses one of the worst directory structures
ever conceived (it wasn't designed by Amiga developers), and disk layout
has a substantial effect on performance, especially where wildcarding is
concerned (including the implied #?.info whenever you open a window).
ReOrg understands these issues, and even has different placement
strategies for use with different OS versions.

On the contrary, as disk drives improve, the transfer rate usually
improves more than the seek time or rotational latency, making the
*relative* penalty of noncontiguous allocation *worse* on high-performance
drives.

Writes are especially problematic, because unless you configure the drive
to engage in the dangerous practice of confirming write completion before
physically writing the media, there is a substantial per-command overhead
whose significance increases as the transfer size goes down (this is
avoidable through SCSI-2 tagged queueing, but I don't think any Amiga SCSI
drivers support this).  With an entire drive dedicated for audio use it
would probably be acceptable to configure the "buffered" style of write
completion, but I'd be reluctant to use that mode on a disk used for
important files.

I keep a partition empty then sometimes move the contents of a troubled partition
into it then move them back. Its kinda boring and means you need to have enough
space to spare but it seems to work.

But they tell me that there isn't much fragmentation.

For ordinary use I find Amiga hard drives plenty fast enough, except
when there is a very large number of files in a directory. In fact,
being used to things like 40Meg Quantums, I find them all amazingly
fast. It all depends on your point of view.

The ability to reconstruct the disk structure from any file makes up
for its slowness, in my opinion. Even if the root block has gone, you
can get everything back. That's worth a lot.
I can remember spending whole evenings trying to get files back off
corrupted cp/m floppies, with a traditional "directory track"
arrangement. The disk structure was one of the main things that sold
me on Amigas. Disksalv version 1 - wonderful!

>(it wasn't designed by Amiga developers), 
Well, they didn't work in the same building (or country) as Jay Miner
and Carl S, but if they developed a big part of the Amiga OS they
count as Amiga developers. And the Cambridge Ring was a pioneering
setup in its day, too.

But apparently it doesn't work on big drives ...

Yes, but I don't think I care if it takes a quarter of a second to
open a window instead of a tenth of a second.

I'm against anything dangerous like data sitting in RAM when you think
it's been saved. I'd rather wait a bit and know it's safe.

I think it's easy to concentate on immediate performance and forget
total performance - how much work you actually get done in a week. A
slower, safer system can be more productive, as you don't spend hours
trying to recover data or re-installing the OS. 
A fast, safe system would be best, of course.

Curious about one item above.  One of the settings for my A4000-Tower
(real tower not homegrown ;-) is setting SCSI-2 tagged queuing.
Is this merely just a named function without any support code in
the device driver or is it really there?  I have no idea how to test whether
it can be used or not but it is on.

I do the same thing myself. Its not that boring. I use AFS
and I just do this on ocassion for the heck of it. Copy
the stuff off a partition...verify that stuff copied
..reformat the other partition and copy it back verifying 
once again that it is there. Now this will definately 
defrag your HD or partition. Works with FFS as well.

Windows 3.1x fragments the data  on the HD as a matter of
normal operation with *.tmp files and the swap file operations.
I have repaired thousands of file problems caused by this
over these past 6 years. Windows 95 does better, but still has
some fragmentation problems. I think it is more relalted to the
third party apps screwing things up on installs and removals
than the 95 OS it's self. I have not bothered to check into that
deeply though. On the other hand the only defraging I have ever done
on my amiga was for large volume sample recording and deleting,
and keeping my BBS cleaned up that I ran years ago with fido,
usenet, files, posting and multiline calling going on. No other normal
volume I have ever used needed defraging. I was usually updating
apps,  OS versions and the HD it self long before defraging was
necessary.

Odd. I use it regularly with 3.1. The old version doesn't understand
International mode, though. I always format with International and
Directory Cache off anyway.

I also suffer from this bug. I have heard others also mention this.
In fact, one other user once (jokingly) asked if the lock option
in the mixer meant "lock up your system".

Sorry I don't have an option. I just quit using this feature.
I did try having only the mixer and cuelist window open in
Studio16 but still had lockups.

Hi Serge,

You can with the new SmpteControl tool I just made. As there is no API
(Applications Programming Interface) for the Cuelist editor you have to do
it as this:

Start SmpteCTRL with gui and set source to be "SMPTE Output" (you have to
set source from the CLI line or it will use current SmpteSink source). Just
press the Play button of SmpteCTRL and both SmpteOutput and the cuelist will
start playing as the Cuelist editor will slave to current SmpteSink.

You can also store five timecodes locally for SmpteCTRL which you can jump
to with a single button push (new snapshot of GUI:
http://www.bgnett.no/~kenny/smptectrl.gif ).

OR the more complicated solution:

- Add an arexx track in the cuelist editor
- Add an entry where you address the SmpteControl program like for example:

rx 'address command SmpteCTRL PLAY setsource "SMPTE Output"'

This entry could be placed at the beginning of the cuelist.

I'm in fact not sure if you can execute dos comands directly from the arexx
track entry, but if so just use: SmpteCTRL play setsource "SMPTE Output"

This solution require the SmpteCTRL program only.

>2. Am looking for a way to get the SMPTE_Out Generator memory
>locations to automatically read the 10 cuelist flags.

That is not possible. This can however be solved like this (as above with
the SmpteCTRL GUI or):

A QMaster script can extract the F flag you want and execute SmpteControl to
goto the SMPTE timecode you want. The usage would be like (from CLI):

1> rx GetFlag 2

The SmpteCTRL program will only need:

SmpteCTRL SetSMPTE "hh:mm:ss:ff" in the script (I can even make the script
for you and any other who is interrested).

Then the script would set the time for SmpteOutput as target (and any other
SmpteSinks if wanted). You will need to specify a cuelist file for the script
of course due to lack of API as mentioned above (I will try to add a hack to
QMaster to allow it to extract the current loaded cuelist file if the editor
is running, but that is future..).

This solution would require both QMaster and SmpteCTRL.

SmpteCTRL is commercial at a ~USD10. QMaster is shareware at ~USD52 (which
include future updates and a GUI if made).

>discussed to death, I apologize in advance.

No problem Serge. I know you're a busy guy.

>the volumes which have been grouped together. I'm using v 3.01.
>Anyone concur? Any fixes (besides NOT using the Grouping

Must be a 'plain' bug or an overload problem. However, current status from
the survey shows that a new mixer module will get a high pri so we'll have
to see ;)

It /is/ possible with a workaround too such as a new module which listen to
volume and pan changes, allow user to group channelfaders via just group
buttons in the new module and when the new module get notified it can
redirect the new volume/pan data to the other channel(s) it is suppose to
be grouped with. However, as we don't know if it is an overload problem or
a 'pure' bug in the mixer module I will rather wait till a new mixer module
can be made (if any will be made that is..).

Ummm I dont know about that. I used to use Quaterback Tools

The reconstructability of the the file system depends mainly on the degree
of redundancy involved.  It does *not* require splattering each directory
all over the disk.  There are other file systems with concentrated
directory formats that still have the ability to recover from many types
of directory damage.

Note that the ability to reconstruct files from *data blocks* alone
disappeared with FFS.  If you want that degree of redundancy, you have to
use OFS.

My point is that AmigaDOS wasn't designed for the Amiga at all.  If the
AmigaOS project hadn't gotten so far behind schedule, the DOS part would
have been written from scratch for the Amiga.  But instead, one of two
major shifts in the Amiga project was porting an existing DOS (TripOS)
to the Amiga, BCPLisms and all.  The on-disk bucket-sorted hash table
directory structure was clearly designed for simplicity, with an almost
complete disregard for performance.  An exception is the rare case of
non-wildcarded lookups in very deep subdirectory structures with very few
entries in any given directory, where it actually performs better than
most other file structures.  Too bad that hardly ever happens.

I don't know for sure, but I've never seen any mention in developer
documentation of tagged queueing support, and since some tagged queuing
modes may result in behavior unlike what the programmer might expect, it
*ought* to be mentioned.  It wouldn't be the first time a configuration
option was implemented without any code to actually use it - note the
"Fast SCSI" enable in the A3000 NVRAM, even though the A3000 SCSI is
physically incapable of Fast SCSI.

Testing it reliably is tricky, since it interacts a lot with the drive's
firmware.  Essentially you're giving the drive multiple commands to
process as it deems appropriate, but constructing a case where it's
guaranteed to take advantage of this may not be easy.  Of course if you
have a SCSI analyzer you could look.  :-)

Yep.  What makes it especially insidious is that you can turn on
International mode, and it will still work provided that there are no
filenames anywhere in the partition with alphabetic international
characters (it's probbaly just the lower-case ones that cause trouble).
As soon as you create a file or directory name affected by the hashing
change, old disk utilities choke.  A Workbench partition is guaranteed to
fail if you install all the catalogs.

Well just so happened that I was going to buy an analyzer ($50) to
check the signaling on my errrrr, long SCSI chain to see
what kind of degradation is happening at the term points.
I didn't know that I could check the usage of tagged queuing.
The analyzer in question monitors proper termination, voltage,
traffic, errors (I assume reported by either the controller or HD directly)
Will have to check the specs to see about the above monitoring
item.  My current SCSI chain is just outside the 3 meter limits
but seems to work well, might have to do with active termination
maintained at each end. ;-)

Has anyone here tried Forced Perfect SCSI termination? It looks good,
but I haven't found anyone in the UK selling the terminators yet.

(Ordinary terminator is just resistors, active is a voltage regulator,
FP uses diodes plus some intelligence.)

  Hi all,
I would like to use the AD516 to play samples when triggered by a MIDI 
keyboard.  I currently use Clarity16 for this, and recently purchased an 
AD516 with Studio 16 3.01b.  I like the sound of the AD516 but must have 
the ability to use MIDI to tell the AD516 what sample to play.  I do sound 
FX for live performances (plays).  I normally have 20 or more songs and FX
In RAM at a time and need Instant access to them.

Thanks in advance,
                                Monty

Hi Monty,

it doesn't exist any tools like this today for Studio 16 as far as I know of
(maybe Bars and Pipes can be used for this - anyone ??)  However, there is
no problem to create a tool which monitor MIDI note messages and loads and
plays a sample, but the current design of the Studio 16 software doesn't
allow instant triggering as it loads sample datas from disk.

If a small delay is ok (2-5 seconds depending on HD and CPU) this can be
achieved. Only upto 8 samples can be played simultainously though. What is
more convinient - triggering on program change or note ?

Are there more peoples who needs a tool like this ?

There's plenty of stuff for running Bars&Pipes and Studio 16 on the
same screen and synced together. The Sunrize Out tool allows you to
make a list of AD516 samples matched against music notes. Having made
the list, you use the Media Madness editor (film strip icon) to place
them on tracks. You can use this tool in B&P without opening up the
Studio16 windows.
If you want more info, mail me direct.

I wouldn't expect any analyzer costing $50 to do this.  I was referring to
the gadgets that are essentially logic analyzers optimized for SCSI use.
These can do things like display the complete sequence of messages that
passed over the bus, etc.

For that price, I would guess that "errors" only refers to low-level
protocol violations and parity errors.  It might also note CHECK CONDITION
status, but not all those are really errors, and I wouldn't expect a $50
box to be able to analyze the data from REQUEST SENSE.

One can often get away with pushing those kinds of limits, although it's
not a good idea to assume that you can.

Active is a voltage regulator *and* resistors.  The switchable active
terminators need some kind of switching circuit for each signal.

*********** REPLY SEPARATOR ***********

Yes I think you can,
                              Version 2 of the studio 16 software included a Bars and pipes
tool called SunRize out. It allows you to assign up to 128 samples ao midi notes it
also responds to volume and pan control changes. Unfortunately this feature was
dropped for version 3 and will not work if you have any tools or accesories loaded from
version 3. Version 2 also has realtime effects which are a bit of fun but not all that usefull.
So all you need do now is track down a copy.

Good luck,
                James

Hello S16 ML users,
   with this I want to thank all who helped me to fix my problem with
the AD1012 card not working (with original 32K RAM chips) with S16 SW
version 3.01. I have replaced those chips with 128Kx8 chips and....
BINGO!!! My card now happily works with this great piece of SW.
On a personal note, wish therefore to thank all users who sent me the
informations on how to upgrade the card.

The mixer setting are kind tricky to work with,
but I am able to save dynamic mixer settings.
A very cool thing to use. You do have to set a 
couple or choices in the project options before
it pays attention to your settings though.

Kenny

Do you know of any software for the Amiga to edit pops, hiss, clicks and noise
from old records?  I can't see me free hand drawing the wave in Studio16.
Also on the mixer redo it would be great to assign or allocate what channel the
sample will play on. This would allow mixing sheets to be used on longer
projects. Also opn our hi8 system the smpte tracking via Horita  not reliable.

Thanks

Bill Dunn

I am not aware of any concrete packages that allows this - someone who
knows? I have heard AudioLab can do some noise-reduction pretty well though.

Unfortunately in this case it isn't the mixer which allocates the channels.
The mixer just listen for volume/pan change-messages and sends messages when
the faders are altered. However, an own button in conjunction with a fader
can be implemented for playing a sample at the channel the fader represents.

Sorry, can't help you here.

Ok here,

Try the following software:

Audiolab with FIR filterdesign (Aminet) for some nice filtering, there is also
some clicks and pops removal.

SoundProbe, just try it.

Samplitude, a demo is on Aminet.


With these four packages you can declick en depop as much as you want.

Another way is via the Shapeshifter, there are a lot of shareware packages
for the Mac on the internet with Declick and depop.

Just try them, ill use them for my Remix projects, most Trance and Techno comes
from 12inch records, with a olt of popping and clicking.



Succes with your quest,

Hi folks,

a friend of mine wants to build a midi box ("for under $20") and asked
me to get an aminet file. SwG-Mbox.lha to be exact. I tried but got a
"not here, buddy" response. (ftp'ed to the big aminet site in the us).

Does anyone know of where this file may be, aside from "hard/hack", or
if any other files may be useful. I'm not sure exactly what he wants to
do, but I could ask if need be.
