This program and its supporting files are Freeware. You may copy it freely,
however you are not allowed to spread any altered version of it.
PD-Distributors are allowed to offer this program in their library without
my prior consent, as long as they supply all files (including this text).
In addition, I would ask you to notify me when offering this program in your
PD-library. You are not required to do so, but I would like to keep track of
who is distributing it and whom to send future updates.

System Requirements
-------------------

The program SHOULD run on all PAL-Amigas with at least 1MB RAM, but I
haven´t been able to test it on every possible configuration. (Since the
program loads from Workbench, make sure to have enough free CHIP ram,
otherwise you might run out of memory when trying to show a graphic or play
a sample.)

Technical Note
--------------

When the program runs out of memory, the error message it gives you does
not distinguish between Fast- and Chip-RAM. However, the only situation
the program specifically tries to allocate Chip-RAM is when loading a
sound-sample. So when you select "Play Sample" and get the error message,
you most likely just run out of Chip-RAM.

HD-Install
----------

Simply drag the "SimpsonGuide"-Drawer to whatever partition you want and
run the program from there. You can even change the name of the drawer,
but the sub-directories containing the data ("Graphics", "Samples", "Text")
must always be in the same directory as the main program.

What´s new
----------

For the time being the program will stay on one disk, since I don´t want
to begin a second disk that stays nearly empty. To make this release
fit onto one disk, I had to remove the largest sound-sample (OPENG.SPL).
I instead introduced a smaller but much more interesting one (DNISE.SPL). 
It can be accessed by selecting "The People vs OJ/Testimony by Prosecution
Witnesses/Spousal Abuse".

Special Thanks...

"Back by popular demand" - as the promo
says, but only during the weekend. Check out
RIVERA LIVE on NBC Super Channel for the        Sun, Mon  4.00 CET
latest talk about the Simpson Case              (greetings to your VCR)

Speaking of NBC Super Channel...

Want to do me a favor?
-----------------------

If you like my program and want to do me a favor, then please call
NBC Super Channel and tell them you want the following shows back:

- I WITNESS VIDEO (They promised new episodes but never delivered.)
- THE TODAY SHOW !LIVE! (They now replay yesterdays show in the morning -
  does it make sense to air an 18 hour old newscast??? We want it LIVE!)
- The Simpson Trial Special from KNBC Los Angeles (The best Simpson wrap-up
  there is. Originally they aired it TWO times a day. Then they kicked it
  out. Don´t ask me why. They could at least air it during the night so
  we can tape it.)
- RIVERA LIVE should also be aired weekdays. This show is better than
  Larry King and they CANCEL it. They recently brought it back, but only
  during the weekend. What genius makes these decisions anyway?
- INSIDE EDITION is another excellent show that found itself off the air
  several month after being introduced.

Again, if you want to do me a favor and your English is good enough,
simply call 0044 171 418 9418 and tell the operator you want to talk to
someone at programming. I know what the chances are, but should enough
people call...

Thanks!
