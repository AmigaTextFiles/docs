THE FUGITIVE
Friday, June 17

$This morning, a @Felony Complaint@@ FELNY is filed which is required
by California law to establish probable cause for an
arrest. At about 8 am this morning, police notify Simpson
Attorney Robert Shapiro that they are going to file charges
and that Simpson has to surrender to authorities. The time
is set for 11 am, later revised to 11.45. As O. J. does not
show up, police want to pick him up at his house - but
Simpson has disappeared.

$This afternoon, the L.A.P.D. is holding a @Press Conference@@ GASCN.
Cmdr. David Gascon drops the bombshell: He announces that
police were now actively searching for O. J. Simpson.

The drama continues to unfold as Simpson friend Robert
$Kardashian reads a @Letter@@ LETTR from O. J. before the press.

What follows are more than two and a half hours of high
drama. Several million Americans watch it live as a white
Ford Bronco is chased by dozens of police cars and 14
police and news helicopters. Behind the wheel: Al Cowlings;
in the back of the car: O. J. Simpson. Cowlings makes a
$@911 Call@@ 911AC to police. As they arrive at Simpson´s estate
in Brentwood, Simpson demands to speak to his mother. Only
then he agrees to surrender and is taken into custody.
$Following his arrest he is taken to jail. §Show Graphic@@ JLDIV
Searching the white Ford Bronco, police find O. J.´s
passport, a gun, a false beard and $ 10.000.
