THE DEFENSE큆 CASE
The Arguments by the Defense

Autopsy               The corner neither conducted an
                      autopsy to establish the time of
                      death, nor was Nicole Brown
                      Simpson큦 body ever tested for
                      sexual assault.
 
Bronco Evidence       The burglary of the Ford Bronco that
                      took place while the car was in
                      police custody contaminated evidence
                      taken from there afterwards.

Blood Evidence        Type B blood has been found under
                      Nicole Simpson큦 fingernails and on
                      her thigh - Simpson has Type A.
                      
DNA Matches           DNA testing was not done properly 
                      and therefore is not reliable.

Fuhrman큦 Record      Detective Mark Fuhrman큦 past racist
                      remarks raises the possibility that
                      he planted evidence. To prove these
                      accusations, the defense introduced
$                      the so-called @Fuhrman Tapes@@ FURMN, although
                      most of them where not admitted into
                      evidence.

The Bloody Gloves     When Simpson tried on the pair of
                      gloves during the trial, they seemed
                      to be too small to fit.

The Single Assailant  The prosecution큦 single assailant
                      theory is questionable. It is likely
                      that more than one person was
                      involved in the crime.

Window of Opportunity Rosa Lopez claims to have seen
                      Simpson큦 Ford Bronco parked
                      outside his estate at 10.15 pm -
                      the time the prosecution says the
                      murder took place.
