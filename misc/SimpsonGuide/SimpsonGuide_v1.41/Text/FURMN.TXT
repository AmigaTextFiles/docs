THE FUHRMAN TAPES

When working on her screenplay, screenwriter Laura Hart
McKinny interviewed Detective Mark Fuhrman to gather first-
hand-information about policework. Although she was writing
a fictional story, she wanted to base it on reality. During
these taped conversations, Fuhrman made numerous racial
remarks and also talked about framing people and planting
evidence. Judge Ito ruled that only two parts of these
conversations were admissible, two parts where Fuhrman used
the so-called "N-word". Detective Fuhrman is the officer
who jumped the gate to Simpson´s property and later found
the bloody glove. Here are some excerpts of the tapes:

... When I left, Dana goes, "No blood, Mark." "No problem.
Not even any Marks, Dana." Just body shots. Did you ever
try to find a bruise on a Nigger? It is pretty tough, huh?

... We stopped the choke because a bunch of Niggers have
a bunch of these organizations in the South End and
because all Niggers were choked out and killed - twelve
in ten years. Really extraordinary, isn´t it?

... First thing, anything out of a Nigger´s mouth for the
first five or six sentences is a lie. That is just right
out. There has got to be a reason why he is going to tell
you the truth.
