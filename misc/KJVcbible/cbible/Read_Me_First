    To install on your hard drive, drag the "CBible" icon to a
    partition. (The demo may also be used from floppy or RAM.)

    To begin, double click either the AssignNIV or AssignKJV icon.

    You may start by reading the Help file.

    From the Links file you can go to any book of the Bible, in the
    translation you assigned. (The demo only contains the book of
    Ephesians.)
