       Sch > I'd liek to introduce JeremyG to you all 
       Sch > JeremyG say hi :) 

   JeremyG > Hey all... 

       Sch > Jeremy has been developing an OS for about 5 years now 
       Sch > It was developed on the Amiga and is actually portable to other platforms 
       Sch > It's hardware independent.  Some of the features it has are Memory  
             Protection, Retargetable graphics, AutoConfig Networking and much more 
       Sch > Jeremy: Is there anything you want to say about the OS before we start? 

   JeremyG > I've got a few paragraphs I can send if you want... 

       Sch > Please do 

   JeremyG > Q Operating System is the first fully hardware and interface  
             independant operating system. This allows it to do some interesting  
             things, such as DOOM on an Amiga, or an Amiga paint program on a 16  
             processor Cray YMP-C90. It is fully capable of "forcing" the issue,  
             if the program 
   JeremyG > doesn't want to cooperate. Impossible? It is, with current OS  
             technology. That is why we've had to start from scratch, completely  
             rebuilding the philosophy of OS design. No longer is the end user at  
             the 
   JeremyG > mercy of the applications programmers. Instead of lowering the system  
             to match as many applications as possible, Q raises those  
             applications to meet the system. This is retargetability at its  
             ideal. 
   JeremyG > At long last hardware designers will be free from compatibility  
             worries, and applications programmers don't have to support all of  
             the "standards" out there. In fact, they don't have to support any! 
   JeremyG > The techniques we use to do what we do also offer many other  
             advantages, such as some of those previously discussed. 
   JeremyG > Because of the way it handles the applications, things such as crash  
             proofing, resource management, auto-caching, virus resistance, 
   JeremyG > full retargetability, and many other features become possible. 

       Sch > Jeremy: When you're done, just let me know so I can give out the  
             rules for the conference and people can have a little while to think  
             of their questions :) 
       Sch > Ok 
       Sch > Ok folks: You will be /msging me with your questions 
       Sch > I will be on as Schrade.  Please send msgs to him and him ONLY 
       Sch > Question asking is ONLY for the undernet side of the net due to the  
             instability of EFFNet 
       Sch > Ok..here we go 
       Sch > First question from Dagorgil 
       Sch > "How does this promotion of applications happen?" 
       Sch > DO NOT MSG me as Sch.  Send MSGS to Schrade ONLY 

   JeremyG > The basic idea is that it reads the program, converts it to it's own  
             language (called UML) and the converts that language back to the  
             machine code needed to run 
   JeremyG > on your machine. Obviously its much more complex than this, but  
             basically that's how it works. It is a recompilation type metho 
   JeremyG > GA 

   Howard > Wont memory protect and crash-proofing cause the OS to slow dow  
             drastically compared to the kickstart in use today?

   JeremyG > Nope, in fact it will operate considerably faster. Let me explain  
             something that will give you a better idea 
   JeremyG > of what kind of techniques are used. For starters an MMU is not used  
             AT ALL. It is not needed. Virtual memory is a thing of the 
   JeremyG > past. Memory protection has moved to higher planes. 
   JeremyG > You have to pay for it of course. And it is done when you "prep" a  
             program when it is first installed on your system. 
   JeremyG > It could take several hours before that program is available to you,  
             but once it's prepped, it will operate as fast or faster 
   JeremyG > than under more primitive systems. In addition, each time you run a  
             program it gets a little bit faster, optimizing itself to 
   JeremyG > the peculiar ways that you use it. In fact, an assembly language  
             programmer would have a difficult time coding tighter and more 
   JeremyG > precisely than Q can. Later on as Q becomes more developed, we will  
             actually hold contests, to see if assembly programmers can 
   JeremyG > program more efficient code than Q can... I know this sounds like a  
             tall order, but it's no longer just an idea on paper, 
   JeremyG > it is a working product being put through the final stages of  
             testing. 
   JeremyG > GA 

     Vicce > "I would like to know how he would market the OS." 

   JeremyG > There are several different techniques being thrown around, and many  
             of them will be employed. Make no mistake, Q 
   JeremyG > will run on anything powered with a processor with 256k of RAM or  
             more... That means that pretty much the entire computer 
   JeremyG > industry is our market. As far as personal computers are concerned,  
             the Amiga in particular, we have spoken with 
   JeremyG > Amiga Technologies, and if they can get over their doubt and  
             unbelief, we will demonstrate it to them as soon as they 
   JeremyG > are willing. We would prefer to sell our product packaged with  
             computers, and not to sell it on the open market directly. 
   JeremyG > GA 

      Zool > No offense, but is this real?  I mean, it seems impossible: A  
             programmer announces a new OS which he's been working on alone for 5  
             years, no one has ever heard of it, and it has features that make  
             all other OS look hideous?  Sounds too good to be true.

   JeremyG > Good question and completely understandable. 
   JeremyG > If you think about it for a while, you might figure out why we keep  
             it low-profile, at least up until now. 
   JeremyG > Sorry for the vagaries, its a good question, I just can't answer  
             without making a lot of people angry... 
   JeremyG > GA 

      oleg > "What language is the OS written in?" 

   JeremyG > Q is written in Q... :) yes, Q is a programming language, and the  
             only one powerful enough to pull off something like itself. 
   JeremyG > Bootstrapping was the only way to get it to the public in less than a  
             century. C++ programming is a ridiculously slow 
   JeremyG > development process comparatively. The original "contrictor" is  
             written in 68040 assembly language, and is the 
   JeremyG > seed bootstrapping code for Q itself. But the vast bulk of Q is  
             written in Q. 
   JeremyG > Oh, by the way, I am not by any means the only one developing this, I  
             am just the one who designed the core of Q. GA 

  Frac_unet > "How did Q come about?  Just a personal project?  University or  
             industry linked research?" 

   JeremyG > It came about as a desparate programmers attempt to make programming  
             an easier process. 
   JeremyG > It started as small alterations of C++, and expanded to what we call  
             a SuperCompiler. 
   JeremyG > Then we realized that by running this supercompiler under most  
             operating systems, it would be seriously inhibited. 
   JeremyG > So we designed it AS an operating system. Because of its nature, it  
             made a REAL NICE operating system, even though that 
   JeremyG > wasn't the intention. It became an ideal development utility for us  
             as we could code for several different platforms AT tHE 
   JeremyG > SAME TIME. In other words, we could write a word processor in Q, and  
             have it spit out executables for Amigas, Windows, 
   JeremyG > Macs, etc. with almost no extra effort. GA 

     gregh > "Availability?  How much?" 

   JeremyG > We are actually going to release an early version for Amigas as  
             licenseware (completely free). 
   JeremyG > That of course depends on several other factors, it may not happen.  
             The money comes from extras that may be attached 
   JeremyG > to the operating system, such as extra interfaces, hardware  
             description modules, drivers, etc. There will be a develope 
   JeremyG > version, but it will cost a lot, possibly over a grand... GA 

      Robr > What is your URL address, and when can we see screen shots?" 

   JeremyG > I am currently working on getting a web page up. No screen shots yet,  
             for legal and logical reasons. 
   JeremyG > Just to add something quickly to the last question, we're looking at  
             1st quarter of 96 for the free Amiga release. 
   JeremyG > The logical reasons I am referring to consists of the simple fact  
             that no two Q systems look alike. Being interface 
   JeremyG > independant, and being more configurable than even the most flexible  
             of interfacing programs, it

    deltax > How big is the kernel?  What kind of system resources does it need?"
