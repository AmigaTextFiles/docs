Introduction
------------

Last december, I decided to buy a CD32 because it was much
cheaper than another CD solution for my A1200.
But the Sernet link is SLOW.
Later I purchased an Aminet IV CD ROM, which didn't work
on my CD 32. When I found a solution, I also found a way
to speed up the connection between my two machines.

This text can help you if you don't know how to use CD which
don't run on your console or if you want to speed up communications.

Please note that the speed won't be as high as the one obtained with
a SCSI drive or an Overdrive. It will be much higher than Sernet's speed.

What do you need ?
------------------

- An Amiga and a CD 32

- A serial cable

- A communication program for the Amiga (Sernet for example)

- A CD ROM which contains communication Program
  (like Sernet) and the device RAD: in one of its
  directories. I use CDPD IV, which contains both
  of them.

- Twin Express (available on Aminet)

- Twin Opus 2 (available on Aminet) if you use Directory Opus


Method
------

Turn on your machines and run communication program on them.
Mount RAD: on the CD32 and format it. Put a directory
s which contains a startup-sequence in the CD32 RAD: and also
the program Twin Express.
Reboot the CD32. You should see Twin Express screen which is waiting
for a command (difficult without keyboard...) or a communication.
Don't forget to remove the CD before rebooting or RAD: won't boot.
Reboot the Amiga and run Twin Express. Communication is established
and is very fast.
If you have Directory Opus and Twin Opus 2, communications will be
very easy. If not you'll have to do all operations whith your keyboard.

Now insert a CD into the CD32 drive and it will be accessible on the
Amiga.


Compatibility
-------------

This method has been tested successfully with :

        - Aminet IV

        - Aminet V

        - EuroScene I

        - CDPD IV (for the boot and the setup of the system)


Startup-Sequence (for the CD32)
