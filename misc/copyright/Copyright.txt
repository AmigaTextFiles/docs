                        CONSUMER PROTECTION


	The Consumer Protection Act and the Trade Practices Act are a set
of guidelines designed to give certain rights both to the consumer and to
the retailer. 

		When you purchase anything within Australia from a retail
		outlet it MUST be of a merchantable quality and it MUST be 
		fit for the purpose it was designed for according to its 
		description.

	That, quite simply is the basis of your rights. If you buy
something privately, then buyer beware!! because you don't have any
protection. 
	Whether you buy something from a second hand dealer or a large
department store doesn't make any difference, as long as it is a retail
environment you are protected by the act.
	Your basic right of warranty of merchantability and fitness of
purpose as described above CANNOT be limited in any way by the seller.

	This does not mean that you can go out tomorrow, buy something,
and then return it the next day. Some of the larger stores may have a
policy of allowing you to return an item that you decided you did not want
to keep, and giving you a refund. This is NOT compulsory. A store does NOT
have to refund your money just because you don't want the goods any more, 
they don't even have to exchange it. Their only obligation is to repair or
replace an item IF it is faulty.
	However, most stores will be happy to come to some arrangement
with goods that are not suitable if you ask NICELY.

	If you ever need to return an item, you should speak to the
salesperson the same way you would like to be spoken to, DO NOT storm in
making a lot of fuss and demanding your rights, because all of a sudden,
you'll find you don't have any and it could take weeks or months for your
item to "get back from the repairer".

	Then of course, there is the other side of the coin, eg ...
	You walk into a store and see the latest frijamixer that you've
been after and it's normally $500.00, but this one has a price ticket on
it for $50.00.  So, quick as a flash, you realise someone's made a mistake
and you grab the frijamixer along with the price ticket and trot up to the
salescounter. Now, the salesperson, being very efficient notices that it
has the incorrect price and tells you that it should be $500.00, but he
can let you have it for $450.00.  Straight away, you make a big fuss and
demand it for $50.00.  WHO WINS!!
	No-one wins in a case like this, because you end up walking out
without the frijamixer, the price ticket is replaced with the correct one
and life goes on.
	
	By opening a store to the public and placing goods with price
tickets on them within this store, the shopowner is making an OFFER TO
SELL. When you tender money you are making an OFFER TO BUY. Only when you
have accepted the goods and the salesperson has accepted your money has a
sale occured. The goods in a store are OFFERED for sale ONLY, you can
purchase them only if the seller agrees.

  
	                     COPYRIGHT
                             ~~~~~~~~~
	This is an area that is becoming increasingly confusing, there are
a lot of "grey" areas and vitually nothing is "black or white".

	To provide a definition of "Public Domain" and "Shareware", the
following is an extract from the DRAFT REPORT ON COMPUTER SOFTWARE
PROTECTION (June 1993) by the COPYRIGHT LAW REVIEW COMMITTEE.

C.   NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER

Shareware and public domain computer programs

10.87   At the public hearings and in a submission received following the
hearings, the concepts of "public domain" computer programs and
"shareware" were discussed. from the submissions, the committee
understands those concepts as follows:

	(a)  Public domain computer programs - programs which the
	     copyright owner has granted the world at large a licence to 
	     reproduce. While copyright subsists in such programs the 
	     copyright owner is, however, precluded from claiming damages 
	     from anyone who reproduces the program.
        (b)  Shareware- programs which have been made available for users
	     to reproduce and use free of charge subject to certain 
	     conditions. Typical conditions that apply to shareware are 
	     that it is freely transferable to other users provided that 
	     after a specified period the user(s) cease to use it or make 
	     a payment to the copyright owner.

10.88    Discussion of these two terms at the public hearings indicated
that there was some confusion as to their meaning. There was also concern
expressed by some users that in some cases it was not clear whether a
program was in the public domain. However, the committee is of the view
that although there way be some public uncertainty as to the meaning of
the terms and into which category a particular program may fall, these
considerations alone are not sufficient to necessitate legislative
clarification of the terms. Accordingly, the Committee does not recommend
any ammendments to the Act to define these terms.


             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you produce a computer program/text/picture etc and release it
into the public domain, you can still retain copyright but you cannot
restrict its distribution or claim damages from anyone copying it.
	
        A shareware program may be freely copied, and if used after a
specified period, MUST be paid for.

	
HOW DOES AN AUTHOR ACQUIRE COPYRIGHT?

	The copyright act does not require any formalities (eg.
publication, registration or the payment of fees) in order to obtain
copyright protection within Australia. Protection is granted automatically
from the moment of producing a work.
	However, it would be sensible to include a statement along these
lines:

		This work is copyright. Apart from any use permitted under
		the Copyright Act, no part may be reproduced by any process
		without the written permission of (copyright owner's name 
		and address).

	You should regard your work as an item of property and keep dated
originals/copies etc.


HOW LONG DOES COPYRIGHT LAST?

	The copyright on computer software continues until fifty years
following the end of the year in which the author dies. From this, you may
realise that there aren't any computer programs that have "automatically"
gone into the public domain. 
	Just because a commercial program isn't sold any more, (such as
some of the old C64/VIC20 games) it doesn't mean it can be called public
domain and freely copied. The copyright is STILL invested with the author
(alive or deceased) and the program CANNOT be copied without the author's
permission.


EXCEPTIONS TO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT?

	A fair dealing with a copyright work for research, study, critism,
review or reporting of news does not constitute an infringement of
copyright. The term "fair dealing" is a grey area which must be determined
on the facts of each case. However the act specifically provides that it
is fair dealing to copy computer programs for backup purposes.


CAN YOU ENFORCE YOUR COPYRIGHT?

	First of all, make sure you have LOTS of money, LOTS of time and
prepared to put up with a LOT of stress. You can claim damages for the
loss you have suffered plus in some cases, punitive damages.
	If you are the author of commercial programs that bring you in a
sizeable wage then it could be worth your while, however, if the person
you're suing for breech of copyright doesn't have any money then you could
quite well be worse off than when you started.

WHAT ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES?

	Australia is a member of the two major copyright conventions ...
		THE BERNE CONVENTION
                UNIVERSAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTION
	Many other countries are members also and abide by similar
copyright rules. As an example an original work produced in Australia
would carry the same protection in America and vice versa.
