KW-Net began as a local network, conceived by Thorsten Schiller, alias
Shadowspawn, SysOp of The Realm Of Twilight BBS.  Time passed and The
Realm Of Twilight (or RoT) went down.  We, at @{" CyberSpace BBS " LINK "Cyberspace"}, decided to
revive the flagging network and revitalize it.

Due to the nature of networks, the original intent of KW-Net being only
a local BBS network fell by the wayside after time had passed.  We are
opening it up even further - global, in fact.

We waited for quite some time after reviving the network to see if any
of the other founding BBSes would take up the reins.  They didn't; we did.
So, after all that, this document is the result.  It has been revamped
and repackaged to better reflect the current trend of the BBS community.
There are both plain text and AmigaGuide formats for your convenience.

                                  KW-Net
KW-Net, originally targeted to the South-West Ontario region, is a very
easy network to deal with.  There must be no MCI commands (CNet) or other 
formatting commands that are not translatable across platforms (IBM, Amiga,
Mac, etc.).  For the most part, providing liberal, entertaining, thought-
provoking and opinionated forums for users and sysops alike are what KW-Net
is about.
