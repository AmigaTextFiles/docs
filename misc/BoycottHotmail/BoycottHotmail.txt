Microsoft did it again!
In one of their attempts to dominate the Internet they have bought the
free email provider Hotmail. Needless to say, this is not good. I know that
alot of you guys out there got hotmail accounts, please support the antims
movement and termineta your account, do this by sending in the provided
email (at the bottom of this file) to: "verify_close@hotmail.com" and put:
"shutdown_me" in the subject field.

The net is full of other free email providers, so it is completely painless
to terminate a hotmail account.

Many people send in letters to magazines telling how bad they think Windows
and other MS applications are. There are numerous antims sites on the WWW,
but do they really make any difference? Does Microsoft care about this?
The answer is NO! But now we all have a chance to change this for ever. If
a large amount of people terminates their hotmail accounts telling them
that they have left because of Microsoft, then other companies would think
twice before selling themselves to Microsoft.

Terminating your hotmail account is powerfull statement against Microsoft
domination !!!
