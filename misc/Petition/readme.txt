This is a Amiga Games Petition that I have started organising from the 28th
Feburary 1997 and the results will be collected and sent out to past and Present
Amiga Companies to show that there is still a viable Amiga market. This form is
going on the Aminet as some people who do not have WEB access can not access the
form on my home page.

Thanks,
Ed Collins.
