Well, I send this e-mail on Netscape site. Here is the anser, I think that the anser is interessant:

"Netscape is a dam good program, this is the best browser available. But, I can't use it a home because there is no
version for my system. I personnaly own an Amiga computer and I also use Linux MK68. So, if you could make a simple
convertion (should not be too hard for Linux MK68, just need a new compilation.) it would be great !
And, as Opera software have announced that they will support Amiga, mabe you could do something for that.
The amiga is not dead and still fight fro nt of M$ !!!

Continue the great job !!!

Bruce"

And the anser:

Mr Heller-
We have not announced any plans to port Netscape to Amiga, but it is
possible that such a port may be released in the future.  Thank you for
your input!

Thank you for writing.

Alex
