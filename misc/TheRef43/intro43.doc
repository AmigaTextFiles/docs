컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   THEREF(tm) is a comprehensive Directory of Hard Drives, Floppy Drives,
Optical Drives, and Drive Controllers & Host Adapters.  It is designed to
help the novice and pro alike with integration problems and system setups.
   Information is provided in two handy formats; Portrait mode, for those
who prefer a normal book-binding type print format, and(or) do not have a
printer with Landscape capability.  And Landscape mode, for those who pre-
fer a computer-printout type format.
   For printing, a Laserjet is preferred, but not necessary, and setup
info is provided.  For viewing, LIST(tm) by Vernon Buerg, will provide an
excellent result, and allow text searches for finding specific models.


REVISION HISTORY
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

VERSION 1.00   This version was a preliminary attempt to start to compile
(early '89)    a list of drives in ASCII.  It was intended for in-house
               use only, not released publicly. 

VERSION 2.00   Decided to change to a Database program instead of ASCII
(mid '89)      for building a listing of drives and controllers.  Used
               portrait mode for all specs.  Still an in-house publication.
               
VERSION 3.00   Changed to Landscape mode for the Drives List.  Stayed with
11-21-89       portrait mode for controllers.  First distribution to close
               friends.  Listed 431 drives and 134 controllers.
               
VERSION 3.10   Not released to the Public.

VERSION 3.20   First official public release on BBSs.   Went to landscape 
04-01-90       mode for both listings.  Listed 973 drives and 231 control-
               lers.

VERSION 4.00   This major release was formatted to support Laserjet type
07-25-90       printers, for maximum impact and clarity.  Portrait and
               Landscape of printing were included for each file.  The file
               "Diagrams.Doc" was started after the initial release, but 
               found it's way public, and so was released as an unfinished,
               "running" document with all future releases of THEREF(tm).
               This version listed 1,055 drives and 286 controllers.
               
VERSION 4.10   This version brought sections on Floppy Drives and Optical
01-04-91       Drives.  "Diagrams.Doc" was offically released with this 
               version.  The Manufacturers Directory was expanded to four
               parts to cover the new sections, and page 5 was added to the
               Diagrams.doc file.  This version listed 1,282 Hard Drives,
               86 Floppy Drives, 140 Optical Drives, and 315 Controllers.
               
VERSION 4.11   Important correction to Diagrams.doc file.  A "bug fix" file
               was sent to distribution points for insertion.                   
               
VERSION 4.12   Minor correction to Diagrams.doc file.  No corrections sent
               out.                      

VERSION 4.20   More of everything.  Added  "logical" specs for IDE type
10-01-91       drives, per the suggestion of many. <g>  Added the Landing
               Zone field, but forgot to label it in the header! The DOC
               file was expanded to 7 pages.  TheRef(tm) now has only one
               Manufacturer's section,...something I have doubts about,
               since some Mfrs have different addresses for HDs, Floppys,
               etc.  This version listed 192 Manufacturers, 1,553 Hard
               Drives, 432 Controllers, 95 Floppys, and 152 Opticals.

VERSION 4.21   Minor corrections to 4.20... This was the version generally
10-02-91       released.

VERSION 4.23   BBS On-Line version in Portrait mode, formatted for a BBS
               viewing program.  Released only through KADET BBS.

VERSION 4.30   Lots of little changes.  Access times changed from "mS" to
05-01-93       "ms", weights are now standardized in grams (g).  The Head-
               parking (P?) was dropped, since this is now reflected in the
               Landing Zone entry.  The COMMENTS section has been cleaned-
               up...It was previously 2 fields combined into 1 for Landscape
               mode.  Now its one in both modes, and a little easier to
               understand (hopefully).  The MFM designation is now gone.  I
               know I'll get objections here, but since MFM is really 1,3RLL,
               I've decided to use that instead.  Some of the sizes are now
               being converted to metric.  The drive heights for new entries
               are now being entered in millimeters.  Manufacturers phone
               numbers are now in International format (000.000.0000) and
               shouldn't be too much of a headache to those of us in the
               US & CAN.  There's a change in the format for the landscape
               mode of the Hard Drives section.  I needed more room for the
               additional entries, so I moved the Mfr's name to the start of
               each section.  Of course there's more info in each section. 
               This version marks the introduction of the Contributors Page,
               where people who added to TheRef(tm) get my Thank You.  If you
               see them on the nets, let them know that you appreciate their
               help in making TheRef(tm) a better product.
                 For those into statistics, this version of TheRef(tm) has
               1,905 Hard Drives, 533 Controllers, 218 Opticals, and  110
               Floppy Drives listed. (Not to mention 217 Manufacturers.)
                 This version also marks the first time I've included work by
               others.  Included are three files from Steven Case to allow
               easier setting of Laser printers for Portrait and Landscape
               modes when (or if) you decide to make a hardcopy.  My thanks to
               Steven, and if you see him out there on the Electronic Airways,
               give him a big THANK YOU! <g>
                 One other small thing... This version includes a new section
               designed to help configure controllers.  There are only a few
               with this version, and I hope to double or triple the number
               in the next release.  This section is a direct outgrowth of
               requests I received.  Of course, I also received requests for
               drive layouts, but for the near future, I'll leave that part
               for those Companies who are looking to make a living selling
               that type of information.   :)        -bob-
