AB3D II "The Killing Grounds" Survey
====================================

AB3D II is a cool game - but some things are missing. It has no
CyberGraphX Support, no ECS Support, no Modem (only nullmodem) Support,
no TCP/IP Support.

If you want to change this, fill in this Survey. I will send the
results to Team 17 (after i come back from holidays). This might not
change much, but at least they know then...

I will add together most answers (those without emails and addresses
given) to some fine numbers, so that it is more easier for Team 17
to read.

Email your Survey entries to Survey@Birdland.es.bawue.de

Please spread this Survey as wide as possible !!!

Question 1 :

Did you buy Alien Breed 3D II or plan to buy it in the near future ?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No, because i do not have an AGA system.
[ ] No, because i do not buy games that do not run on GFX Boards.
[ ] No, because _______________________________________________

Question 2 :

a) If you already bought AB3DII :

If a CyberGraphX Version would be released, it

[ ] had to be for free (on Aminet).
[ ] I would pay an upgrade fee of _______ to ________
[ ] I would pay full price for a CyberGraphX version,
    even if i already have bought the AGA version.

[ ] A CyberGraphX Version of AB3D II would be very fine for me.
[ ] A (much later released) update that features the Texturemapping
    features of the S3 Virge chip of the Cybervision 3D Board
    would be fine for me, as i will buy this board.
[ ] The processor of my Amiga is a __________________
    and my GFX Board (if existing) is a ________________.

b) If you gave a "No" in Question 1 :

[ ] I need an ECS Version, as i have a ECS system with
    a _________ processor, that is powerful enough for AB3D II.

[ ] I need a CyberGraphX version.
[ ] A (much later released) update that features the Texturemapping
    features of the S3 Virge chip of the Cybervision 3D Board
    would be fine for me, as i will buy this board.
[ ] The processor of my Amiga is a __________________
    and my GFX Board (if existing) is a ________________.

Question 3 : If the CyberGraphX Version would be for free :

[ ] It has to be tested at Team 17 before being put on Aminet.
[ ] It can be provided "as if", if it runs or not is up to the user.

Question 4 : How could you help Team 17 ?

[ ] I could lend them my Computer with installed GFX Board for
    testing of a CyberGraphX version. My email, snail mail and
    phone number are found at the end of this entry.

[ ] I could lend my GFX Board to Team 17. Address see below.

[ ] I could lend my Computer without installed GFX Board to
    Team 17, if they get a GFX Board from somewhere else.

[ ] As soon as the Cybervision 3D comes out, i can sell them
    my GFX Board quite cheap, as i am then getting a Cybervision 3D
    then, instead of the board i up to now use.

[ ] I could do Beta testing of the GFX Board version. I have bought
    AB3D II. So they only had to mail me the main executable.

[ ] I am a programmer who is quite familiar with CyberGraphX programming.
    I could help them with the coding part.
    My email is ___________________________________________

[ ] I am a programmer quite familiar with c2p algorithms. I could do
    a c2p for ECS machines for Team 17.
    My email is __________________________________________

[ ] I am a programmer quite familiar with TCP/IP coding. I could help
    them there.
    My email is _________________________________________

Question 2 :

a) If you already bought AB3DII :

If a CyberGraphX Version would be released, it

[ ] had to be for free (on Aminet).
[x] I would pay an upgrade fee of $10 to $20
[ ] I would pay full price for a CyberGraphX version,
    even if i already have bought the AGA version.

[x] A CyberGraphX Version of AB3D II would be very fine for me.
