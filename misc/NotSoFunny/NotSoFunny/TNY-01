Out of inspiration?

There is help!

Ideo-m-atic(TM), the new brain extension.

All you editors no longer need to worry when the deadline is near and you
still need to write ten articles to fill up the disk.

Simply plug on Ideo-m-atic(TM) and off you go.

Ideo-m-atic(TM) includes a database of over 10 million of subjects you could
write about, ranging from "keeping tropical fish" to "chess".  Your readers
will no longer have a déjà-vu effect, as the new Ideo-Unique(TM) system
automatically sorts out all subjects you, or any other human being, has ever
written about.

This is achieved by a direct neural connection to your brain, in conjunction
with an extra-large database stored on CD, which can be read on ANY CD-player,
including your hi-fi!  Strangers will not even notice this large database, as
as ALL important data is embedded in FIFTEEN music tracks from Metallica.
Only people equipped with the Ideo-neural(TM) neural connection will be able
to distinguish music and data.

But Ideo-m-atic(TM) is even more!

Ideo-m-atic(TM) automatically accelerates your fingers and it automatically
makes you use your ten fingers for typing.  This means that you can write up
to seven hundred articles an hour!

But there's even more:  With the newly upgraded Ideo-neural(TM) v2.0 software
you can not only access the CD database, but you can also communicate
telepathically with your Amiga, so that you no longer need your keyboard!

Don't hesitate!  Order Ideo-m-atic(TM) today and get it delivered within TWO
hours, even when living abroad!
