The Anti-satanist movement

We regret to inform you that all satanistic texts and signs are no longer
allowed in any data related to the Amiga.  This decision had to be taken to
uphold the law and protect the innocent.  (deja-vu?)

The following words may no longer be used in any Amiga executable or data file:

    "Demonstration"
The five first letters of the word "Demonstration" are "Demon".  This shows
that Satanists have been on the scene for a very long time.  The only
non-satanist demo group seems to be Melon Dezign, wo invented the word
"melonstration".  However this word may be banned soon too, as it might imply
the worship of the melon (a new bio-religion?).

    "Demon"
All demos with names that include this word, such as "Demon Download" are
banned and may no longer be copied, lend, uploaded, downloaded or played.

If you have any more questions, please send a SAE to:
    ASM
