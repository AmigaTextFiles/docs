Visual Basic for the Amiga

Back in 1987 when Microsoft was still a small company, they programmed a Basic
dialect for the Amiga.	But something went wrong.  Accidentally, they lost
their source disks, 1 day before the release of the new Workbench 1.2, which
should include Amiga-Basic.  The guys at Commodore were waiting impatiently
for the final version of the Basic, but the MS programmers didn't arrive.

They came but one hour before Workbench 1.2 was revealed to the public.
Commode engineers quickly copied the program and some examples onto the
Extras disk and brought everything to the place were the new OS was to be
presented.

The public was very disappointed after seeing Amiga-Basic, but the contract
between Microsoft and Commodore was over, so Amiga-Basic was the last version
made.

What the public didn't know : The version of Amiga-Basic released with
Workbench 1.2 and 1.3 was not the version Microsoft had been coding on for
months.  They had lost their source disks, so they had to do a quick port of
a lame Macintosh basic they were also developing.

Prepare for the news that will be very disappointing to PC users and rememer
that you first read them on the Aminet!

The disks that were lost were found in 1993.  Bill Gates had put them in his
"How to implement a good memory management" drawer on his desk, which he
opened *very* rarely.  The writer of this text managed to get an exclusive
look at the source and the executable.

Prepare for the terrible truth:

Visual-Basic on the PC is a straight conversion of the original Amiga-Basic
(not the one-day-fake)!  Yes, it's true:  The programmers of Microsoft had
managed to write a Basic that was very advanced by using all the special
functions of the Amiga-OS.  So advanced that, when they found the disks in
1993, they were able to port Visual-Basic to the PC and make it THE leader of
PC Basic dialects.

Of course this couldn't be done without compromising.  The original
Visual-Basic even ran on the first Amiga 1000 with 256k of memory and a single
drive.	And it looked better, and was faster than the Windoze Visual-Basic on
a 486DX2/66!  The reason why the PC version requires a fast processor and a
lot of memory is that it actually emulates a 7 MHz Amiga, including the Amiga
chipset in software to be able to run Visual-Basic!

Rumours say that Bill Gates was seen stealing the only working prototype of
the new AAA chipset/RISC processor card!  The REAL truth about the going bust
of Commodore will be uploaded to the Aminet soon!
