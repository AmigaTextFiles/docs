Rendering everything with the same texture at one go is the preferred method. 
If you can manage, sort your polies by texture/surface and render them at one 
go. The Voodoo will not slow down on this, quite the contrary - all chips 
will benefit from that due to the fact that the texture uploads will be 
minimized. 

The problem with state changes is that there might be a lot of registers 
affected that need their contents re-evaluated. This is a bit different from 
the texture stuff. Warp3D however tries to miniize this by comparing new and 
old state values and registers and only updating if they are really in need 
of updating.

No, usually you just use W3D_SetState, and the value is only changed if it is 
different.

No, if you need transparency you will most likely want to disable Z buffer 
update (you will need ZBuffer tests enabled), and draw the transparent faces 
back-to-front, otherwise things will look wrong. The order in which you draw 
transparent faces will determine the outcome.

Don't enable Synchron. If you enable this, Warp3D will wait for the hardware 
to become idle after every drawing command, and that will waste any amount of 
parallelism you have. Keep it disabled, and use W3D_WaitIdle after you have 
drawn the entire frame, or want to do anything major.

It does, but the driver doesn't. The Permedia2 stencil buffer is only one bit 
deep, and hence practically unsusable. The Voodoo 3 doesn't support any 
stencil buffer. You can use the Z buffer as a limited stencil buffer 
replacement.

Hi all,

    I'm new with HW accelerated graphics, and I have some questions about
it.
1:
  I have read thet on modern 3dchips state changes are quite slow. Some
suggested  to draw all faces with same surface in one loop, change
 state and draw other faces.  Is it neccesary on Permedia? And will
  it cause a speed decrease on Voodoo?

 2: If answer for 1 is: "Yes they are slow".
    Are context states remembered by W3D, so when setting it to the same
state  doesn't mean sending a message to the hardware? Or I have
 to check it for myself?

 3: If I would loke to draw transparent faces with z buffering, do I have=
 to
draw them after all nontransparent faces? I think Yes, but maybe there
 is another method.

 4: When drawing with W3D_SYNCHRON (or something like that) how much time=
 do
I have for CPU while HW is doing it's job? I mean what can I do in this
time.

 5: Does Permedia support stencil buffer? I mean ,can I set a stencil to

You don't need to depth sort the polygons, just put them into a list stored 
with each texture (that's what's meant with "sorting by texture"). Something 
like this:

class Texture
{
public:
	W3D_Texture *m_pTexture;
	std::list<Polygon> m_PolyList;
}

And later add the polygons to be rendered with that texture to the 
appropriate textures m_PolyList. When rendering, you'd first set the texture 
on the appropriate triangle structure, and walk the list to render all of the 
polygons in it.
You can also have seperate lists for different states and texture 
environments, like MODULATE and REPLACE, or depth buffering, this might safe 
you some state changes...

That combination isn't supported by the Permedia. You should get an error if 
you check the return value.

Additive blending is achieved by W3D_ONE, W3D_ONE.

That's a problem with the endianness of the 24 bit modes when used with some 
texture format. I always wanted to have a look, but didn't come around to 
doing it. I'll have a look at that after I finish the Voodoo driver...

    This can be done in proprocessing level i think, and wouldn't cost

 But I think that using for example 2/3 least important bits of texture
 (surface) ID could be a good idea. I'm using integer sorting so it will =

    Sorry, I meant disabling Synchron. But now I have reconstructed objec=

 ( clipping is done).

    Well, bad luck. I read about using stencil buffer to draw shadows and
was  wondering if permedia supports it. I thought that everything that is
possible to set in Warp is possible on permedia, but it would be too good=
;)

 And here comes a new question. How should I set blending mode
 to simulate multitexturing. I have used:
   W3D_SetBlendMode(context,W3D_SRC_ALPHA,W3D_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
 and=20
  W3D_SetBlendMode(context,W3D_SRC_ALPHA,W3D_ONE)

  But they seem to give equal results. And other thing. When Voodoo comes
  in, what blending mode should be used to get additive blending? Is it
  possible to set it on permedia and get normal blending and when voodoo
  driver will be available to get additive blending without changes in th=

code?

 This is it for now. Thanks in advance.

Subject: Warp3D developer archive
From: Thomas Frieden <ThomasF@hyperion-software.de>
Date: Sat, 16 Jun 2001 12:30:24 +0200

Hi,

I've uploaded the Warp3D developer archive to Aminet, so it should pop up 
there any time now.

For the developers here, here's what's new in V4:
The most prominent new feature are of course the vertex arrays. If you know 
OpenGL's array functionality, you know what it's about. It's the possibility 
to draw a huge amount of triangles in one go. Like in OpenGL, the arrays come 
in two flavors:
W3D_DrawArray draws the current array in the order the vertices appear in the 
array, i.e. it always starts at the beginning, and draws a certain amount of 
array elements. The type of pimitive is given with the call itself 
(currently, seperate triangles, triangle strips, and fans are supported).
W3D_DrawElements is the same as OpenGL's glDrawElements: The actual vertices 
are indexed by another array.

The current arrays have to be set before calling the drawing operations, by 
calling W3D_VertexPointer (for x,y,z geometry), W3D_ColorPointer (for color), 
and W3D_TexCoordPointer (for texture coordinates, including u,v, and w).
The layout of the data is variable, and like in OpenGL, the stride (i.e. the 
amount of space between consecutive array elements) can be given for each 
individual array. 

The array functions do not take a texture pointer directly. To use a texture 
with these functions, it has to be bound. This introduces the concept of a 
current texture, which will currently only be used for the arrays (the 
single-primitive functions will still use the texture in the appropriate 
structure, for backwards compatibility). 
The function W3D_BindTexture is used for that. Note that W3D_BindTexture, as 
well as W3D_TexCoordPointer, already include a parameter to choose the 
texturing unit. Currently, everything else but 0 gives an error, but the next 
release will allow more than one texturing unit for hardware that supports 
multi texturing, adding a function to select the color operation between 
texture stages.

V4 also introduces hardware assisted backface culling. There's a new 
function, W3D_SetFrontFace, which will tell Warp3D what's to be considered 
front facing (W3D_CW for clockwise, W3D_CCW for counter clockwise). This is 
enabled or disabled by W3D_SetState with W3D_CULL_FACE.

Hopefully, this message can serve as a general guideline for V4. I didn't 
have the time to update the developer documentation, the file 
docs/Warp3D.guide contains the autodocs for all functions, though, including 
the new one. 

If you have question concerning the new (or old) functions, do not hesitate 
to contact me.

Use the option to generate VBCC linker libraries (special 73)...

Sorry for the inconvenience, but it's getting too tedious to have all of the 
stuff prefabricated, and every compiler has the facility to build it's stuff

Hi,

It was brought to my attention that the Warp3D developer archive I've 
uploaded recently lacks one major part: The autodocs for V4. I've uploaded an 
update archive (Warp3DDev-u.lha, sorry for the silly name, but Aminet insists 
on maximal 18 characters).

In the meantime, if somebody wants it badly, I'll send out free preview 
copies of the autodocs if asked nicely :)

Yep, that's the same thing, basically..

This depends on the chip, unfortunately. Most of the time, modifing a state 
is just the change of a bit. Of course, most of the time this will result in 
the chip registers  to be re-evaluated. Both the Permedia and the Voodoo 
drivers have host-memory backups of the resister, and registers will only be 
transfered to the chip when they've changed, to minimize bus traffic. 
Frequent state changes will of course result in larger amount of bus traffic.

No. The blend function is always SrcColor * SrcFactor + DstColor * DstFactor. 
You can't change the operation. I think some chips can do subtraction, but 
it's not in Warp3D yet. If we get enough chips that support it, it will make 
it's way into Warp3D....

I'll have a look.

What do you mean with that ? Asynchronous is the normal operation, and only 
when you set a special state will synchronous rendering be used. 

Or do you mean something else ?

    I meant sorting polygons which are transparent. They have to be sorted.
 My solid polygons are arranged in lists with the same surface, and drawn
 in one loop. This should give a similar result like below

    And which of state changes are the slowest ones? Or there is no

    Yes, I know it now. The only reason it worked is that blending is set
 on context creation. Isn't it? But this way i can get additive blending
 on Voodo and normal blending on Permedia.

    BTW. Is substractive blending possible?

    Just downloaded it. Now have to find some docs about opengl to 
 learn how to use these vertex arrays.

    But as I said it causes crash in my engine. I had to create my own
 list of engine's textures and free them all by myself. I called this
 function (FreeAllTexObj) right before DestroyContext().

Other thing. Why when using DrawTriangleV() asynchronous rendering isn't
 possible and with DrawTriangle() it is?

Subject: Allegro Library ?
From: Andrew Barker <andrew.barker@sunderland.ac.uk>
Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2001 13:26:23 +0100

Hi,

Anyone know if the Allegro Library has been ported to the Amiga ?
Or if anyone is working on it ?

The reason I ask, is becuase there's a Spectrum emulator available for
DOS and will
work on Linux via the Allegro Library.  The authors say they could make
an Amiga
port but depends on an Allegro Library for the Amiga.

Ok, I added both tooltypes to the icon of devs:monitors/cvisionppc, but it
still fails to work...
I also tried to create two environment variables in env:cybergraphx named
BITMAPCACHE and DRAGGING containing 1 and 0 respectively, but I keep getting
"No ZBuffer: memory shortage" and also a powerpc exception complaining of
memory protection violation.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: how to get Warp3d to work on Prometheus + Voodoo3
From: Dennis Zweedijk <denzwe@wishmail.net>
Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 21:54:35 +0200

Hello,

Last weekend, during the Benelux Amiga Show, I bought a Prometheus
PCI-bridge and a Voodoo3-2000. The 2d drivers work fine, but I
can't get Warp3d to work on it. I can't even get the warptest demo
or the gears demo to work, let alone Shogo or HereticII.
All I get is a gray screen or window, and then the system hangs.

My configuration is:

Amiga 3000/040 tower
CyberstormPPC 50MHz '060 + 233MHz 604e + 128MB
Quantum Atlas 10kII harddrive (on PPC board SCSI)
Ricoh CDRW drive (on PPC board SCSI)
Microtec Scanmaker 330 flatbed scanner (on A3000 SCSI)
56k6 Modem
Epson Stylus Photo 750
21" muti-sync monitor
FrameMachine (zorroII board)
Hypercom IO (zorroII board)
Prometheus with:
    Voodoo3 2000
    10Mb ethernet board
OS 3.9 + boingbag 1

My CybervisionPPC is not installed at the moment. Warp3d worked
fine on that.


Can anyone help?

Kind regards,

Dennis Zweedijk

This sounds like you didn't include the tooltype BITMAPCACHE=YES and 
DRAGGING=NO in your BVision monitor settings. This is especially true if 
WarpTest only shows a shaded rectangle with no texture on it. Add these 
tooltypes to the monitor icon and reboot, this should fix it.

Hi everybody!

I'm having some problems to get warp 3d working on my system.
Whenever I try to run a game or demo requiring warp 3d to be installed, I
get the following error message: "No ZBuffer: Memory shortage". This happens
with Shogo, Heretic 2 and Warp 3D Demos. Warptest works instead.
I have an A1200, Blizzard PPC, BVision, 128 mb of fast ram, OS 3.9 + Boing

Can anybody help?

None. 
The only thing to remember is the PowerPC/gfxaddr address. This must be set 
to the Voodoo's display memory (I guess I didn't mention that :/ )

Use prmscan to find the Voodoo board, the second address is the display 
memory: Use setenv PowerPC/gfxaddr $.......... to set it (insert the address 
at the dotted line ;)

That would explain why WarpTest appears to do nothing, but all other Warp3d
programmes still produce a gray screen and then the whole system hangs.

O.K. I did that, but it makes no diference.

What env variables and/or tooltypes need to be set for Warp3d to work with
the Voodoo3?

I will surely purchase it... it's quite unexpensive and it'll surely be

I suggest that you purchase Cybergfx V4.
It's faster, especially with the BVision and it's not expensive.

First of all, remember that there's no 68k version. WarpTest is 68k, so it 
will not dinf any driver.

If you've got the version from the CD, you probably got the one-library 
version (look for a Warp3D/hwdrivers/W3D_Avenger_PPC.library). This one's a 
very old one, and it's got problems on screens with big endian byte ordering 
(i.e. screens of format 16 BIT), and requires modes with 16 BIT PC. The newer 
version that can be downloaded form Matay's web site is a two-library version 
(W3D_AvengerBE_PPC.library and W3D_AvengerLE_PPC.library). This one's 
independant of the byte ordering.

I suggest that you download the newer version from the Matay web site, 
uninstall Warp3D, and reinstall it (to be sure you don't have old libraries 
around)...

> Amiga 3000/040 tower

I never tested it on an A3000, although I can't think of a reason that it 
will not work...

I think you need to set them to YES and NO respectively. I am not sure if 1/0 
would work.

You also need to have the CVisionPPC monitor version 2.7 beta 3, no earlier 
version will do. Additionally, make sure to have your environment variables 
set up correctly as per the "Problems" text file. Especially the gfxaddr is 
critical.
