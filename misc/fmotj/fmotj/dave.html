<BR><HR><BR><BR><BR><H4>In this month's issue, Dave, the band's chief Hanger On, gives his tips on picking up women.
<BR><BR>
'Hi Guys. You may well have seen me at gigs dancing with a wide
array of stunning women (is that the right way around? Ed), and
wondered how I do it. Let me tell you my secret to 'Picking Up'.
<BR><BR>
1. Drink at least 6 pints of best bitter before making a move.
<BR><BR>
2. Have patience. Many a winning position has been lost by
jumping in too early.
<BR><BR>
3. Wait until a collection of beauties are dancing around
handbags in front of the band.
<BR><BR>

with a big grin.
<BR><BR>
5. Weed out the non-starters. Don't waste your time on any of
the following.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
 Girls with short hair wearing boiler suits.
<BR><BR>
  English Speakers.

6. GRAB the nearest girl and spin her around, off the floor, for
at least 5 revolutions. Ignore her screams at this stage unless
accompanied by a male name that is not your own.
<BR><BR>
7. After no less than 2 minutes, slowly release your grip. If
your partner then runs away crying, repeat step 6 with another
victim.
<BR><BR>
