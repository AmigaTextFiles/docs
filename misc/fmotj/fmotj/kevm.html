<CENTER><H3>Many will be unaware that Kevin's first role in the band is not
that of singer, but of Van Driver. At the Auditions, whilst
other young hopefuls were showing off their larynx, Kevin showed
the boys his Double Wheel Base minubus/van and got the job.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><H4>Here are Kevin's tips for ensuring that the band turn up at the venue on time.</H4></P><P><P>
<PRE><H4>1. Check the water before every trip. Leave the radiator cap off
when setting off abroad so that Customs will be too busy
laughing to bother to search the van.

2. Make sure that all mirrors are firmly affixed to the vehicle.
Steering can be adversely affected if forced to hold the rear
view mirror out of the window while overtaking.

3. Ensure that there is a steady flow of fumes into the rear
passenger area to slow the drummer's reflexes before the gig.

4. Keep at least five large stone slabs in the van at all times
in case a quick patio job can be done in the break.</H4>
