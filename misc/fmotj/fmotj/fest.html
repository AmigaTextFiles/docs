<PRE><H4>After the success of the summer's FMOTJ/ JAMMAS festival at the
Merry Harriers, the band have once again proved that they
haven't learnt their lesson by agreeing to run the entertainment
for this year's bike show.


It will be held at the Taunton Rugby club on October 12th and as
well as a bike show, will include live music all day as well as
a variety of stalls and other entertainment for both adults and
kids.


Entry is by donation, min. &#163;1 and all proceeds go to LUPAS. The
bands include FMOTJ, Wally and the Stompers, Hard to Handle and
Screamin' Blue Murder and a good time is bound to be had by all,
so come along!</H4>
</PRE>
