After supporting Bad Manners at last years festival, 
the boys returned to this year's East Brent Festival sharing the top of the bill with 60's band The Impostors. 
<BR>
What follows below is a record,
to the best of our knowledge of the events of that evening....</H3>

The Impostors were so called because they dressed  up for various songs to look like the Beatles, Stones, Freddie and the Dreamers, and other acts of that era.. Our boys were very taken with this idea until Simon graciously declined to wear
a silver catsuit with tinsel in his hair and 8 inch stack boots (not in public anyway).

After a short break, FMOTJ took the stage and delivered another
set full of energy and excitement, finishing with two encores
before retiring to the backstage area.
<BR>
For some reason, The Impostors had left some of their wigs
behind, which caused great amusement amongst Kev and the boys as
after they had finished, they were invited to sample some of the
real ales that were on offer and as you can tell from the below
photos, entered into the spirit of it all to easily.

As with all trips into foreign territory, you must try and
respect the local customs and traditions, however Kevin failed
to grasp the local tradition of drinking a pint, running round a
dustbin five times at the other end of the Marquee and then
running back to touch the bar. It was all going well as he drunk
his pint and set off up the marquee, unfortunately he thought it
would be much more fun to empty the dustbins all over the
Marquee and rugby tackle his opponent to the ground.

Glyn then stepped up and saved the bands blushes and showed his competitive streak as he won his race with a spectacular diving finish head first into the bar
(luckily the bar wasn't damaged).

As a footnote to this story, if anyone knows what happened to
Nigel (last seen suspended from one of Nick's light gantries)
please let our offices know.</H4>
