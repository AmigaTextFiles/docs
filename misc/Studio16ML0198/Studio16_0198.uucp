If you would like to find out if some of your assossiates or friends are on
the list you can send a request to majordomo@thule.no and type
'who studio16' in body text.

(We have passed 70 subscribers today).

Ok, some general stuff: please try to trim the postings. Trimming the
postings will increase readabillity and decrease bandwidth wasted. Also try
to keep a max linelength of 76 chars to avoid linewrapping in postings.

We have a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). You can get this FAQ by sending
an email to studio16@emrl.com and put 'get faq' in the subject line. You
might find some of the question you carry answered in this FAQ. Don't be
affraid to come forward if you have something on your mind! Also see email
header of any posting on this list for more info.

If you are interrested in getting the Studio 16 support archive which
contains developer docs (fileformats) and several tools, you can get this
archive from Aminet in dev/misc/Studio16add.lha or from Pauli Porkkas web
page http://www.iki.fi/~pporkka/

Not from the majordomo, but I can send you (and anyone else who would like
to receive) an UUCP file from my private database. I have stripped out
administration messages, binaries and test messages. The file contains just
below 500 messages (including today's messages). It will be archived as lha,
lzx and zip, let me know what you'd prefer.

If you use Thor you just parse the UUCP file into your database with
"thor:bin/parseuucp <your system> <uucp-file>".

It doesn't. To achieve that we need developer (API) docs for Studio 16
version 3 (studio.library 4.2 etc.). You can of course create apps to
accompany Studio 16 poping up at the same screen, but no direct interfacing.

The Studio16 add-on project is containing developer docs on the fileformats
pluss tools to handle those.

Thanks Serge for all your input!!  I feel kind of foolish though, after reading your reply, I discovered I had the TEAC real-to-real wound wrong, which was causing un-due tension on the heads. After rewinding the tape properly, my problem disapeared.... Hopefully for good! 

I hope your not too upset with me after that generous lengthy reply!!  :)

Thanks again everyone!!

Many thanks for this really excellent and helpful contribution.
Did you ever try the SMPTEout module with the Amiga genlocked to a video
camera? That ought to give a more accurate timing, but I haven't had a chance
to test it myself.
You don't mention what version of the SMPTEoutput you tested. I have 1.02.
As the software multitasks, perhaps it is being delayed by having to share
time with other tasks?

I've only used it here with genlock enabled and sync to video selected,
even on really bad/abused/old decks the SMPTEOutput module has always been
frame accurate.

Same version here. I always run it with nothing else running and do not
disturb it while it is striping. :)

Yeah, rotary-head technology is more stable and accurate typically. That is
one reason the Tascam DA88 mentioned by Mr Mula in this thread is a good
bet...

Dhomas, I realize that the addons at this point are not new apps, but I'm wondering if the project will, down the road maybe, include some new apps for use within Studio16? In other words, will the programmers be able to create modules to use within Studio16, like the cuelist, the editor etc....

I ran a little test over the weekend. While recording (from the Recorder
module) to Ram:, I monitored the increasing file size in quasi real time
thru DOPus.  Both channels were always identical.  When I stopped the
recorder, the right channel file was 2048 bytes longer then the left
channel.  I presume the 'file closing' within the multi-tasking
environment (or something similar) is the reason the two files are not
identical sometimes.

I must rather be a last file /write/.. however, interresting size too, 2048
is exact 2kb. Is this always the case ? Those of you who have this problem,
has anyone ran the MessageMonitor app ? Perhaps there is a delay when the
recorder send a "stop recording" message...

What does the last data contain ? nulls or random data etc. ?
What filesystem do you use and what disk type SCSI/IDE ?

(I am just trying to locate where the problem might be - I don't have this
problem myself).

It doesn't. To achieve that we need developer (API) docs for Studio 16
version 3 (studio.library 4.2 etc.). You can of course create apps to
accompany Studio 16 poping up at the same screen, but no direct interfacing.

The Studio16 add-on project is containing developer docs on the fileformats
pluss tools to handle those.

Not from the majordomo, but I can send you (and anyone else who would like
to receive) an UUCP file from my private database. I have stripped out
administration messages, binaries and test messages. The file contains just
below 500 messages (including today's messages). It will be archived as lha,
lzx and zip, let me know what you'd prefer.

If you use Thor you just parse the UUCP file into your database with
"thor:bin/parseuucp <your system> <uucp-file>".

If you would like to find out if some of your assossiates or friends are on
the list you can send a request to majordomo@thule.no and type
'who studio16' in body text.

(We have passed 70 subscribers today).

Ok, some general stuff: please try to trim the postings. Trimming the
postings will increase readabillity and decrease bandwidth wasted. Also try
to keep a max linelength of 76 chars to avoid linewrapping in postings.

We have a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). You can get this FAQ by sending

might find some of the question you carry answered in this FAQ. Don't be
affraid to come forward if you have something on your mind! Also see email
header of any posting on this list for more info.

If you are interrested in getting the Studio 16 support archive which
contains developer docs (fileformats) and several tools, you can get this
archive from Aminet in dev/misc/Studio16add.lha or from Pauli Porkkas web

Kenny, Since there are some programs, like Dissidents sample editor program (I can't remember what it's called), that can feed sound directly to the cards, or so I hear, are they not interested in sharing this secret or what?

Is myopia a disfunctional attribute of association with the former
Commodore?

As I have mentioned more than once in this list: the people at
dissidents--publishers of Midi Sample Wrench (www.dissidents.com) seem
like good people. But everyone should find out for themselves--by emailing
or calling (or snail-tracking to) dissidents and mentioning this list/
project.

It won't hurt to mention the use of, or interest in, WRENCH. Kenny can't
do it all you know.  8-}  And do the same with anyone else who might have
some connections.

For us to get a modern, useful Studio16 thingie, it is going to take an
effort. Some of us here want an integrated environment that can do just
about anything a pro expects from ProTools on the Mac, which is the
multi-generational big-daddy on the block.

So lets get others to realize there is a growing and committed (spending)
base of AD516 users who want the real thing. After all the Commodore-era
burns these small companies had, is it any wonder they are low-profile in
the Amiga [marketplace]?

I must rather be a last file /write/.. however, interresting size too, 2048
is exact 2kb. Is this always the case ? Those of you who have this problem,
has anyone ran the MessageMonitor app ? Perhaps there is a delay when the
recorder send a "stop recording" message...

What does the last data contain ? nulls or random data etc. ?
What filesystem do you use and what disk type SCSI/IDE ?

(I am just trying to locate where the problem might be - I don't have this
problem myself).

I didn't think MSW could play back on AD516... only load Studio16
format audio files - BIG DIFFERENCE.  The developer's documentation for
most of the audio file format has been available for awhile.

That's not direct playback support for the AD516... not even close.
For that matter, Turbotext also has support for the AD516.

So now YOU are the judge of what support is valid support? WRENCH from
/years/  ago still has better support than many of the fudgy little one-
use tools I have seen discussed. It's easy to use, does its intended job,
which is to audition samples that are being edited by WRENCH /without/
/having to save out/--and it works correctly. So go ahead and edit
samples in TurboText or a hex-editor or whatever it is you propose.

Meanwhile music-editing and sound-for-video on other platforms will
continue to march forward. Who knows, maybe rexx-like intercommunication
will become all the rage there, as has (1)animation (2)video (3)multimedia
(4)pre-emptive multitasking and (5)more than a few colors. (Rumor: people
are editing, processing, and storing sound in *greater* than 16 bits now).
Get educated. Then maybe we can give ourselves a greater sound-tool and
have more fun.

Hi,

I actually started a project a year ago called "KStudio.library". This
library interfaced to Arexx and used the arexx comands of Studio 16.
However, due to a bug in the arexx environment it sometimes crashed when
closing files and therefor where useless. Otherwise it could solve (atleast
temporarly) the problem of lacking play capability. Another limitation was
that it could not play from RAM without some nify timing routines which
would not be possible due to how arexx works. :-/  What I did was to format
the args from the library call into an arexx message and sent it and waited
for a return which I reformatted and gave back to user. As you see it would
also be slower than programming arexx directly (I was desperate.. ;)

Do you know how the Sample Wrench uses the Arexx comands ?

If the 4.2 (Studio 16 3.x) library was compatible with the old 2.x there had
been no problem today. I aslo know that the Scala EX module is limited to
only play from disk (Disk IO module) and not memory. I think actually Studio
16's own Disk IO module is the only program I have seen capable of doing
that (memory<->dsp buffering). :-/

Therefor we need one person that knows the v3 system. Mr Ben Fuller, do you
read this ? Are you interrested and do you have time to help us on this one?

What do you guys think of paying for the capability (f.ex. an AHI driver) ?

No, not for me.  It seems erratic...from 2k up to 8k for me.   I have two
Amigas
that both do it.  I don't know that I would call this a problem as it doesn't 
seem to effect anything, and only happens using the recorder which I only use 
as a "button on" way of monitoring my input while recording into the cuelist.

Haven't tried this.


>What filesystem do you use and what disk type SCSI/IDE ?

I'm using FFS and SCSI with both my 3000 and 4000.
Recording to RAM gets the same results

Please, send me this ARexx script.  I'm very curious as to how it uses
ARexx to playback sounds in memory with an AD516.  This could be a very
important thing to see.  (Or I could be half asleep and missing
something key here).

It's not a rumour... It's kind of pointless to store sounds in greater
than 16 bit.  Well, not totally true, but close enough.  Just like it's
pointless to sample at higher than 44.1 or 48 K.  But then Coke does
taste different than Pepsi.  Or doesn't it?  I wouldn't know, I don't
drink either.

As for processing sounds in greater than 16 bit... the Amiga (as other
platforms have, too) has had software for a long time that does this.
If Studio16 had any effects processing of it's own, it would likely do
it too.  Processing in 32 bits or more is very common, for the very
important reason that it decreasses calculation errors (overflows).

Now, that's a personal stab at me... not at a software package.  This
is pretty childish.  I'm pretty sure that I know more about sound and
the Amiga than most Amigans.

If it wasn't for ME, Kenny would never have started this Studio 16
project.  Ask him!  Of course, now he probably blaims me for it having
taken over his life!  :)


As for Sample Wrench... well, you should have a look at SoundFX.

Gord: glad to hear your sync problems went away.  I'd say
X-UIDL: a4733d61a67b14c369e5f168a9cb855e

you were lucky.  As my earlier post suggested, syncing to a tape deck can get
dicey.


Serge:
thanks as well for your detailed post on syncing to tape.
Going to a stand alone smpte generator was the next thing 
I was going to try but never got around to it.  

I have to say though that my trouble shooting didn't bring me to the same
conclusion about the Sunrize SMPTE Output.  

I drive a second AD516 card in a 3000, using SMPTE Output
running on my 4000 all day long.  In fact I alternate which machine is the
master depending on which set of tracks I am working on at the time, and I
have never had
slippage or the famous "Your SMPTE source is running too fast or slow for
Studio16" prompt.
Actually I take that back, sometimes if a machine has been chasing SMPTE that
has been 
stopped at the source, after ten minutes or more (this is rare but has
happened) I will
get the prompt.  Mind you this is when there in no SMPTE present at all.

The moral of your storey I thought was "if you are going 
to sync to tape, make sure your deck is in top running
order".

In my case, a new "rotary head deck" as refered to by Mr.
Greenboy, will deliver that rock solid sync that Studio16
so craves.

>    A Crazy Little Thing Called ARexx...

Hi,

I actually started a project a year ago called "KStudio.library". This
library interfaced to Arexx and used the arexx comands of Studio 16.
However, due to a bug in the arexx environment it sometimes crashed when
closing files and therefor where useless. Otherwise it could solve (atleast
temporarly) the problem of lacking play capability. Another limitation was
that it could not play from RAM without some nify timing routines which
would not be possible due to how arexx works. :-/  What I did was to format
the args from the library call into an arexx message and sent it and waited
for a return which I reformatted and gave back to user. As you see it would
also be slower than programming arexx directly (I was desperate.. ;)

Do you know how the Sample Wrench uses the Arexx comands ?

If the 4.2 (Studio 16 3.x) library was compatible with the old 2.x there had
been no problem today. I aslo know that the Scala EX module is limited to
only play from disk (Disk IO module) and not memory. I think actually Studio
16's own Disk IO module is the only program I have seen capable of doing
that (memory<->dsp buffering). :-/

Therefor we need one person that knows the v3 system. Mr Ben Fuller, do you
read this ? Are you interrested and do you have time to help us on this one?

What do you guys think of paying for the capability (f.ex. an AHI driver) ?

Kenny, I would pay for an AHI driver for sure..... and I would pay for
anything significant that enhances Studio16 itself as well!! I hope I am
speaking for everyone else here too... .we cant expect the best and not pay

I will not be the one to deside. I hope it will be free too. If I could make
it I would certainly make it for free, but I hope Mr. Fuller will consider
"helping us out". There are, as I have mentioned, 70 people on the list and
I think a large percent of us are interrested in an AHI driver. I would like
to hear from Mr Fuller himself what how he view things.. Mr Fuller ?

I too would pay for an AHI drive. I responded to a post to this effect
on USENET months ago and still haven't seen anything yet! I can't remember
who posted the thread though. Also, I had contacted Martin Blum over a  
year ago regarding this and he said he'd love to, but would need the
developer docs for 3.x. I tried for months to get hold of them and was
contacted by an individulal that said he had 3.x dev docs, but was unsure
about copying them for me because of a non-disclosure agreement he
had signed with Sunrize Industries. Anyway, after several email he finally
copied them and mailed them to me. Unfortunately, they turned out to be
dev docs for 1.x. :( Anyway, perhaps they never existed as some have said.

This is a commercial program. Perhaps you should check it out as a demo or
buy it. Especially if you have stated opinions about it without ever
having checked it out. Talk to the programmer. Of course, the more
/modern/ version is on Windoze and NT. The Amiga version is several years
old.

(If only everybody was serious enough to buy the stuff, we could probably
have more top-level developers interested in the Amiga again. But it would
take some convincing after all the debacles and the high attrition rate.)

Of course it isn't a rumor! And I guess your ears are more golden than all
those guys that have been mastering since the days of vinyl. They insist
in 20 and 24-bit storage. Maybe you have never noticed "noise-floor"
effects before. Or zippering. Or seen how many people have looked for
algorythms to dither sound during fades to and from the noise-floor. Not
to mention signal-to-noise ratios.

(As far as I know, music is more sublime, and worthy of closer inspection
and philosophizing than any cola product I am aware of. At one time I
recall guys saying we didn't "need" more than 4096 colors, or larger
screen displays. I hope I wasn't one of them. ;-) I bet several here on
the list would enjoy a higher spec, and be capable of hearing and using
it--

Part of my point! And this is also one of the reasons to store sound in
higher bits. So that each time it goes through a save or store until it
reaches the final master and even onto archival, it will not suffer from
conversions and processing rounding-errors. Read articles in EQ and Mix,
go to AES, etc.

No more personal than you were previous to my reply. Just more upfront
about it. I applaud Kenny's efforts. But this has nothing to do with a

The Amiga community has tendencies found in the families of hard-core
abusers. Some members of the family make apologies for the deficiencies,
deny they exist, change the subject; try to draw the attention elsewhere.
But if we want to solve the problems (and I do!) we have to acknowledge
they exist, and find successful models to study, emulate, or improve upon.

Yeah, I'm probably buying it. If it's got the goods. Otherwise perhaps
Roland, Emu, Akai, or Apple and Digidesign. Even though I love the Amiga
and all that it has stood for.

No. I would talk to dissidents. But I believe most programs that depend on
timing merely have internal processes do the actual jobs. The ARexx
commands they design are merely to communicate to the program to do it,
not the actual agents of the process. But I don't program in any language
from this era well enough to understand <duh, doh, dos: the declension>.

Kenny, I am totally convinced that the scope of the project is so huge, at
least the way I envision it, that it would be negligent NOT to pay for it.
I want the real stuff. I want the developer to feel compensated enough to
continue to grow a killer-mondo-monster-shredder. The best the hardware is
capable of delivering...

You're right. If not someone else has plans to do so I'll put it on my TODO
list. FYI: I just contacted Sound FX author as well. He already support
Studio 16 samples, but it's more detailed stuff like sampleclip support etc.

Agreed. I think we can see many interresting projects if we get this option.

This is a little off topic, but does anyone know if John McFee from the Doobies actually used Studio16, or was that just expensive advertising? (just for curiosities sake)

Don't really know, but I assume he in fact did and perhaps still does! Why,
wouldn't he have used an AD516. It was the absolute best thing available,
and *nothing* could touch it!

I'm talking about the arexx script not Sample Wrench itself.  The ARexx
script is likely to be text, tell us what it says and maybe we can do
something with it.  If they wanted to keep the technique a secret it
wouldn't have been done as an arexx script... if it had to be arexx,
they'd have just implemented it internally so nobody would know how it
was done.

I've seen the demo of Sample Wrench and the purchased version, neither
version had an arexx script for the AD516... this must have been added
later.

You're right. If not someone else has plans to do so I'll put it on my TODO
list. FYI: I just contacted Sound FX author as well. He already support
Studio 16 samples, but it's more detailed stuff like sampleclip support etc.

Agreed. I think we can see many interresting projects if we get this option.

I wonder what the Studio16 user base is!  Does anyone have an estimate? If we knew how may boards were sold, this would help justify (or not-justify), additional work on Studio16 based on payment for results. Maybe this mailing list could be advertised on Amiga Web Directory or something! What does everyone else think?

I don't care which celebrities have used or not used Studio16, and unless
the number is forthcoming from a former Sunrize employee (doubtful)--I
don't care how many people report that they have the AD516. As a dealer
before The Apocolypse, I got the impression that Sunrize was very well
installed, and quite a few in the hands of working professionals.

But I am sure the majority of them are now using other tools on other
platforms. So if you need a head count for justification, I would say:
make up a high number if your *heart* is in this; make up a low number if
this is a venture for beancounters.

I don't think you are being realistic Greenboy.  I am very serious about this, and if you were too, you would realize that money talks. If you really truly want some action, then do a little research and find reasons to make the people who don't care what happens to Studio16 to care instead!  I'm talking about people like Ben Fuller, and other's from the origional Sunrize team.  I'm a 100% Amiga all the way, and have been for 11 years! But one thing I noticed, is the majority of Amiga users don't want to pay for software, and that's why companies like Sunrize constantly abandon the platform. Not everyone in the world is in love with the Amiga like most of us, but that doesn't mean we can't benifit from some excellent programmers that actually want to get paid for their work.

The bottom line is, I am only trying to come up with some idea's that will let us get what we want, and that is... continued support and development of the Studio16 non-linear editing system!

I have also had this same problem while using a separate Midiman, "Time

When I replaced it with a generator having better accuracy (In this case, a
Denecke "Sync Box" generator), the problem disappeared.
Moral being:  Not all SMPTE Time-Code generators are created equal.

Lots of good info there Serge! ;-)  I've yet to try to sync up my Tascam 38 to my
Amiga / Sunrize / BP setup yet ( I've been TO !@#$@$$% busy! ) but you advice will
come in handy.

One thing Gord and others ( me too ) might benefit from is a CD that has SMPTE on it.
I think Prosonus'  test disk CD has 30 minutes of SMPTE time code on it and there may
be others.  I don't have one but a few years ago it was about $70 I think.  Probably
less than a hardware device!?


Good luck all, I've been enjoying lurking in the email! ;-)

  I am also part of the throng that would pay money for an AHI driver, or
any significant modern tool for Studio 16, or AMiga audio in gerneral.
Despite recent audio improvements announced by the DraCo people, I
forsee depending on Studio 16's flexibility for a long time yet!

Actually, Ben Fuller is on this list - therefor I have tried to get his view
on the situation and if he see any hope to achieve seomthing.
Unfortunaltely, at the very same time I have got some bounces from his ISP
due to a relay problem, but it seem to be fixed now.

Reply to young monkey (21-Jan):

The ARexx script from dissidents' SampleWrench is not mine to give. I
would have thought that someone in the biz would have a firmer grasp of
intellectual property-rights. If your reasoning that just because it isn't
binary or hex, it's up for grabs...well, let's all plunder your website
for anything that isn't bolted down...

I have said it repeatedly: contact dissidents; they are nice people and
I'm sure they will respond. (I didn't get to be an older monkey by
publicly posting other people's code without permission.) (Yes, it is
still code...)

If you have read any of my other postings in this list (even in the past
day or two) you would realize that you have pretty much repeated what I
have been saying. So to quote myself from just a bit earlier:

...I am totally convinced that the scope of the project is so huge, at
least the way I envision it, that it would be negligent NOT to pay for it.
I want the real stuff. I want the developer to feel compensated enough to
continue to grow a killer-mondo-monster-shredder. The best the hardware is
capable of delivering...

But head-counts are not going to make people care. Producing a sensation
is what makes people care.

So get beyond the I-CARE-MORE-THAN-YOU retoric and examine what probably
needs to take place. If people have stated a commitment to do certain
projects, they have either already examined what their needs are, or are
doing it because /they/ think it important. So for them the research has
hopefully already been done. If they now decide not to follow through--
until "additional research" is done, they probably are not committed
enough anyway.

Decision by committee only muddies the water of commitment. Many of us have
already demonstrated our stance many times over. So lets get on with it!

Hello all,

1. The original person who started a "would you pay for AHI support?" thread
   in comp.sys.amiga.audio was Troy Silvey (tc_silvey@juno.com). He gathered
   names of AD516 users, like myself, who were willing to pay for AHI. I'm
   still very willing to pay for it. Troy had been corresponding with a former
   Sunrize team member who claimed he would try to work on an AHI interface if
   he could find the time. Troy asked the "who would pay" question on his own
   to try and motivate the former Sunrize guy. That was last June and nothing
   seems to have happened yet. I wonder if Troy knows about this mailing list.

2. I owned Dissidents Sample Wrench (v1.8 I think) but had some difficulty
   with Dissidents and ended up returning it. At that time, It didn't support
   Studio16 file format completely. It could read a Studio16 file as a "raw"
   file, but couldn't write one that Studio16 liked. It suggested using AIFF
   files as the transfer format BUT the Studio16 3.01 AIFF writer has a bug
   and the AIFF files from Studio16 were rejected by Sample Wrench as
   "corrupt AIFF" files. The "Studio16 support" Wrench had at that time was
   the ability to open a Sample Wrench window on the Studio16 screen (like
   Bars and Pipes). You still had to play the file from Studio16 but could
   edit and save it from Wrench without changing screens. NO editing in ram
   and listening in Studio16 without saving it to RAM:. Not quite the same.
   I do know that Sample Wrench now has real Studio16 file format support,
   but I doubt they have the ability to play on an AD516 without some part
   of Studio16 being active. I would love to find out I'm mistaken.

3. I, too hope for new support for my AD516 and this group is the best
   chance I have. I'll provide any monitary support a developer feels is
   necessary to take us further. I also hope that we can remain friendly
   with one another. If anyone leaves this group because they feel they
   are unappreciated or don't like another's attitude or opinions, we ALL
   lose.

4. I set up another musician I work with an Amiga and leant him one of
   my AD516s and Studio16. He used it happily for about a year but eventually
   decided to get a Mac and Pro Tools (he got the Mac for his graphics
   business..Pro Tools was secondary). He called Sweetwater Sound to buy
   the Pro Tools hardware and talked to their "Pro Tools expert". When he
   mentioned that he already had a recording system, the "expert" asked
   what he was using. When my friend replied "an Amiga with Studio16", the
   Sweetwater guy responded "Oh, those were the best!".

We were the best and can still be among the best if we prove we can support
those who are willing to develop new software (and if we can just get those
who know how to talk to the cards to share a little info...)

Sorry this was so long....
so long :)

He had talked to Ben Fuller (who is monitoring the list) and I think he had
got an reply that if Mr. Fuller had time he would look into it. I haven't
heard any thing later.

>   about this mailing list.

I am not sure (I didn't find the address while I did a quick search right
now), but he's very welcome to the list! I was originally against paying
for the AHI driver at the time, but I realise that there is probably no
other way (and I have got more understanding for it now). Then again, I did
not ask for my own convinient on the list, I did have Mr Fuller in mind as
well.

I'm affraid you're right. I think Sunrize only licensed docs on the library.

Fully agreed. I hope we can stick to case, not person. Moderating is an
option though, but I hope it won't be necessary.

I think this is not so much an Amiga thing as a small-user thing. Big
companies buy software, individuals and sole traders can't or don't want to
pay hundreds of dollars. PC software on gold disks is everywhere, and
supposedly honest citizens think nothing of using it.

When I sold Amigas I occasionally ran into real pirate-types. They never
seemed to be too successful at what they did because they were "small"
thinkers, cheap and unable to see the big picture. The people who bought
what they used tended to be people who went places, were more focused,
learned and studied the tools of their art, and benefited from it. They
valued having manuals, support, and self-respect.

Professionals.

Several here on the list were former beta-testers, as was I, and can
probably attest to the apparent unmotivatability (and disinterest) our
reports were sometimes met with. I wonder if they realized they were not
the only ones suffering from Commodore's "suckiness".

Lets email him!

Boy, that's got to be a long way back. I can hardly remember that version...

True. S16's arexx port has to be available. I never saw this as a problem:
I would pull the sample into Wrench that I wanted, tweak, audition, etc.
`til it was ready to save--then go back to working in S16.

This is not too far-fetched. My heart especially started pumping when I saw
Maricizio's AudioLab announcement!

When I was selling Sunrize products, BYTE Magazine (*great* cross-platform
mag) compared S16 to twelve or more other similar products and gave it the
same high praise. <but that was then...>

If anyone can figure out how to directly access the 516 (and 1012)
and Maurizio Ciccione's AMIGA program ProStation will work with it...
we'll all have access to a Pro Tools like environment (or so Maurizio
says).

Then it's goodbye Studio16... ???

What everyone has to remember... no matter how much Kenny or I or
anyone else does to 'enhance' Studio16, it's all still going to be a
hack.  There's only so much we can do and then were stuck.

ARexx scripts and such aren't going to do it.  Even an AHI driver isn't
going to be enough to make a REAL Studio16-like environment.  Sure,
it'll be nice to have... but I'll be surprised if anyone can make an
environment like Studio-16 or ProTools with AHI... Has anyone done it
yet for any other supported card???

The next step beyond this is disassembling Studio16 and creating
patches for the executable.  That's probably not going to happen, not
even Kenny will do that - huh Kenny?

It's going to come to the point where it's just going to be easier to
code a whole new application - and scrap Studio16... ala ProStation, or
whatever.  But, without the technical docs for the cards, that can
never happen.

Don't get me wrong... I'm not saying this revival project is a waste of
time - it's not.  I'm just hoping that people aren't expecting the
impossible here.  And I'm pretty sure some people are.

Unfortunately, now it might be the best on the Amiga, but that's about
it.

That's just loading (pull) and saving... Wrench doesn't need an S16
Arexx port to do that.  SoundFX does this too.

What we (developers) would like to know is what the (alleged) secret
ARexx command is that Studio16 responds to, to play sounds in memory.
I've got a strong suspicion that Wrench still saves the sound and then
uses the Studio16 arexx commands: S16Open to load the sound and
S16Trigger to play it . This stuff is already documented and nothing
new here.

I'm not going to disassembling anything and haven't. Though, international
agreements (tractats) allow you to do so as long as you don't use any of the
code (or change it) and just watch to learn, but it's mostly in C (I assume
from examples I have seen and the the way studio.lib 2 api was built (stack
parameters, stubs etc.)) and reading disassembled C code will take the rest
of the year (and probably next year as well) anyway.. :^)

I hope we can get this in another more convinient way.

>time - it's not.  I'm just hoping that people aren't expecting the

The goal is to achieve it even if I or someone else has to learn DSP
programming to do it. But you're right, we can't expect too much. Though,
having the fileformats analyses we can expand support for sample processing,
creating and processing cuelists etc. which will help a lot IMHO. That was
also the reason why I started the project. As you mentioned earlier we might
have to use hacks, but hopefully we can avoid it.

He had talked to Ben Fuller (who is monitoring the list) and I think he had
got an reply that if Mr. Fuller had time he would look into it. I haven't
heard any thing later.

I am not sure (I didn't find the address while I did a quick search right
now), but he's very welcome to the list! I was originally against paying
for the AHI driver at the time, but I realise that there is probably no
other way (and I have got more understanding for it now). Then again, I did
not ask for my own convinient on the list, I did have Mr Fuller in mind as
well.

I'm affraid you're right. I think Sunrize only licensed docs on the library.

Fully agreed. I hope we can stick to case, not person. Moderating is an
option though, but I hope it won't be necessary.

ARexx commands are normally all listed as text in the program code, and are
easily extracted with Transwrite. The commands in the Studio16REXX file are:

s16openwithautoclose
s16openrecordoutput
s16openrecord
s16open
s16trigger
s16close
s16tofront
s16toback
s16exit
s16version
s16querysmptetime
s16chanvol
s16notify
s16rate
s16gain
s16pan
s16filter
s16playstereo
s16play
s16waittimecode
s16waitgpi
s16stopallplayback
s16smptestop
s16smpteset
s16smptestart

I don't have a manual any more (somebody stole it), but I presume these are
all known? There can't be any more; if one of the other modules had its own
port, it would need a different address.

I think this is a relevent topic, since I'm using Bars & Pipes with Studio16....

Does anyone know where I can get a manual, and is there anymore word on Microsoft selling the package back to Amiga Inc.?

Perhaps this has never needed to be considered. Now it does. There is no
reason such a tool can't be fast, powerful, and accurate. Time is the
biggest constraint.

What's wrong with that? Realistically, that is what needs to be done in
order to go forward. I figure that we just need to get over the hump of
exclusive approaches. This took place on other platforms for display,
sound, and video--for the most part, years ago.

Once we too have device-independent drivers, that makes it possible to
design software that has a potential for larger sales. Any card on the
Amiga should be able to use the same software. If it has some modularity,
then special features of different cards can be addressed without making
the package low-powered or -featured to satisfy the lacks of less-adept
cards. Important. And can you say...PLUG INS?

>Don't get me wrong... I'm not saying this revival project is a waste of

Perhaps you feel out of your league. But this project as I envision it is
not /impossible/. It will take some special luck, some teamwork, a
willingness to reach out, maybe some horse-trading, a little from here, a
little from there. Or maybe all it will take is a card-driver, and the
rest of the work is already being done.

Then we can beta-test and get on lists and harangue and argue and discuss
until the Amiga can stand with the big boys, at least in some markets. But
Studio16 isn't so bad that people aren't able to get by in the meanwhile,
is it?

greenboy earlier: True. S16's arexx port has to be available. I never saw
this as a problem: I would pull the sample into Wrench that I wanted,
tweak, audition, etc. `til it was ready to save--then go back to working
in S16.

> = dhomas trenn's words on 22-Jan-98:

No. You are still missing the point. Though Load and Save are involved,
being able to use the card to AUDITION your edits/effects is very useful.
That is all the arexx is for. Just because it is not what you want it to
be does not negate its usefulness or circa '90-whatever coolness.

There are no big secrets here. Whose allegations? Does it have to be new
to be valid? Are my observations being taken out of context because they
are not your rosetta stone? Your obsession unbalances you.

When we first got going on this thread I was trying to point out that in
the past, other people have done significant work in the area of sample-
editing and effects, and have had experience with the AD516/Studio16, and
perhaps have documentation people here do not possess.

Those people are potential allies, and useful resources. I still believe
that the more folks who contact them and express interest, the more our
potential becomes actuality. Ever hear the term "reach out"?

It's not what you said it was.  You said you had an ARexx script for
sample wrench that allowed it to play back sounds on the AD516 WITHOUT
having to LOAD AND SAVE sounds.  I wanted to know how this was
accomplished.  You refused to tell us how they did this, insisting that
Dissidents had the information to do what you said this was doing.

I was pretty sure that Dissidents didn't know anything that we didn't
already know... but you insisted it accomplished the task without
LOADing and SAVEing... now you say yes... it has to load and save.

Had you said this in the first place... instead of leading us all to
believe that it was possible, we'd have saved all this wasted time.

> When we first got going on this thread I was trying to point out that in

I wouldn't consider loading and saving anything resembling significant
work in the area.

Kenny's contribution... now that's significant.

Part of having "golden ears" is working in rooms that control frequency
dispersion, phasing, standing waves etc. Correct monitor placement counts
here too. The quality of the entire signal chain influences how "golden
ears are trained and maintained. If your equipment can't tell the
difference it is tough for your ears to learn (and it is a learning
experience).

One of the biggest steps for me to get closer to a "golden ear" ideal
concerns wiring. Without high quality interconnection of midi, data,
audio, video, and a.c. lines, you are going to limit your ability to hear
what is really in the audio signal, and what your near-fields and other
equipment are really doing. Ground loops and noise leakage from one type
of signal-carrying line to another are quality decimators.

Having higher quality shielding (someone was mentioning not having the
DAC/ADC circuitry within the computer, which is a "noisy" environment) is
important. Get braided/foil-wrapped cable where appropriate, not
spiral-wrap, /especially not/ Radio Shack.

I believe that balanced power is the only real solution to take care of
all grounding problems. (EqiTech, Furman, and others supply rack-mount
balanced power systems.) Balanced power may be viewed by some as
expensive, but the signal-to-noise ratio of the entire studio goes up more
dramatically than anything else can do.

Each piece of gear can now reach its potential in performance, and its
longevity is increased due to having no voltage floating around where it
shouldn't be. Balanced power is easier to use than every other
semi/non-effective way of dealing with ground-noise problems.

Anyway, probably anyone can build golden-ears. It just takes attention to
details, in listening, in maintainence, in equipment set-up and purchase,
and in attitude. And its like riding a bike...

Hey. Last time I heard a rumor, about three weeks ago, I checked every www
link I could find, searched for and used every email address for anyone
who ever worked at BlueRibbon, looked up all my old contacts as a former
dealer, etc--and NOTHING! That's some firewall they've got there.

So I would say, good luck with Microsloth ever doing anything that
great...

I agree that Kenny is doing a right-on thing. I have before. And Kenny
must be getting tired of seeing all this energy going sideways. Now can
you and I move on, so that we can be assets instead of liabilities?

Amiga Inc... never owned B&P.

Anyway... in my last CU-Amiga SoundLab column (Feb98) I reported on a
site where you could download the program and other BlueRibbon stuff. I
believe the guy is also selling photocopied manuals... check it out at:

Funny that you mention this....as I just sent mail to Troy yesterday, asking
him to get on this list if he 
wasn't already.

It is probably a matter of getting around to setting up the Amiga (it may have
been put away in a cupboard like the one at Black Belt), finding the disks,
remembering how to set up SAS c, etc etc after a 2 year break. Just a shortage
of round tuits.

Yeah, I contacted Steve Worley, the former producer/software engineer of
Essence (an algorythmic texture/background builder sold in the Toaster
marketplace). Tried to get him to reintroduce the product, or at least
sell me a copy. His reply: had to cannibalize the Amiga for the floppy
drive...   <He is working on a mega-project called Gaffer currently>

Gosh I'm happy I discovered this list a few days ago. Though my internet
face is a MAC , my Amiga holds a dear place under my fingers.
Its been a while since I  shared the passion Amiga, and you gents remind me
of the special  madness that Amigans have from the nonsensical punny
"Subject" lines to the billboards for signatures - it reminds me of old
times.

Anyway, from my WRENCH 3.1.5 ARexx directory:

* Mono AIFF save from a Wrench sound for Studio16 playback. */
/* The sound is saved to the temp directory T:, but could just as easily */
/* use a hard drive partion. */

options results
address wrench

/* set save format to AIFF */
format 0

/* save the sound in editor 1 */
savew 1 'T:TempSound'

/* call up Studio16 and have it play back the sound we just saved */
address command
'Studio16:utilities/studio16rexx no screen'
address command 'WaitForPort Studio16.1'
address 'Studio16.1'

S16Play 'T:TempSound'

S16Exit'

Not as fast as a direct call to the hardware but almost fast enough on a
stock 3000 and frankly I've always liked the idea of a scripting language
that allows a bozo like me to tie things together.
One of the things that seemed to contibute to Ami's elegance.

                               Happy to lurk here (smells like home)
                                                     Ted

Hey, Ben!

>Commercial Developer (# CC01039 -- I was there at the beginning,

I remember the first time I used Project D: that was some big deal back
then! Not a hard drive to be seen. Some of us were involved with Atari STs
(midi software), and Project D actually was more capable of copying the ST
disks than any thing we could find for the Atari! Sold quite a few Project
Ds too, /everyone/ back then needed one of those. I seem to remember your
name on some other disk utility even before that--Yo-ho, yo-ho, a Pirates'
Life for Me...?

Yeah, this pretty much crippled me too. All my money, dreams, and time had
been tied up there since '87. Really, before then. I bought every issue of
AmigaWorld since Andy Warhol! Everything I did, loved, and ate came from
the Amiga.

I like lots of the stuff on the PC, but the operating system, I find, is
painful to use. But some beautiful stuff for developers there! (making a
good living being only one of them!)

So is this information itself available?

Well, I agree, and I don't agree. One of the instruments I play has not
really had anything major happen to it for about a century. But people
still pay to hear it. And you are not lost in the shuffle of a million
others when you play new music on it.

But ambitious projects tend not to be here anymore; standards are not set,
and innovation is tough, given the lack of new standards and direction.
There is a certain disfunctional ambience here at times.

This is probably what I believe my biggest hope is. To have a driver will
allow smaller Amiga-oriented houses to pehaps make decent money on multi-
card software that, if not state-of-art, will at least be nearer to what it
takes to be creative and survive. I suspect that many of us can't or won't
buy the latest 24bit ProTools, or make the struggle doing something similar
on the Windozzze platform for as long as we can avoid it  8)

>At one time I was one of the most Die Hard Fanatic Loyalist Developer On
>A Jihad To Bring The Whole World To Amiga --

So you can dig it: Here, we are all pretty good at getting major mileage
out of last year's model. We are creative...

Wow!   Thanks Ben.
 
I appreciate your post.  It's difficult to operate
in a vacuum as was created by the complete silence
Sunrize left us in.

Your words were refreshing and sobering, going right 
to the heart of whether or not each of us as individuals
made the right decision to hang in there with Amiga.

I would like to see the dialogue here, on AHI, get more 
clear and to the point.  What would it really take in 
man hours to program it?  Who would own it?  What would 
it really take to entice someone such as your self to do
this?  What can individuals like myself do to help this 
go forward?

I for one am not still using the Amiga because I think 
it is going to become a commercialy viable platform 
again.  I am frankly very comfortable with this computer
and am going to milk the last dollar out of my 
investment until I feel I am losing money(productivity) 
not moving on.

If the AHI driver is written I could conceivably get an 
extra 6-12 months of longevity givin the current stasis
the Amiga is in.  My decisions are best made against how
I would handle the least optomistic forcast.

I do admittedly still dream at times though that this 
list of sincere individuals is a micro-forshadowing of a
groundswell of energy that could lift the Amiga up from
it's ashes, via GATEWAY, back into the frontier of 
computing.  A syncronicity of sorts.

My things is music and my love of it....  as long as 
this can serve that dedication........

I haven't cross checked this script with my documentation but I think this
is what everyone has been discussing. 

I found something about this in the Wrench_new2.1 doc that gives a summary
of how it works.


*By using AREXX, you can use the SunRize hardware (eg, AD516) to play back
a sample loaded into a Wrench editor. This will always treat the sound as
a one-shot. The first use of this macro will be a little slow since
certain items needed to be loaded into the computer's memory. Subsequent
calls will be faster. The following macro is used to play the sound loaded
into editor one.*


So I think in essence everyone was right.  It's just that the script does 
the saving and loading for you invisibly.  Obviously this is not the 
answer we are looking for but I think it is a very creative patch.  Could 
other programs benifit by using this?  I have been meaning to check out
AudioLab16 again, and now the talk of SoundFX has also got me curious.

I think it is time I call up dissidents, maybe tomorrow and see where they
are currently at with The Wrench.



Hey..thanks for the post tdavis
Don't wonder off to far!

I don't know if any of you have been following _Project Magic_ by Opera
Software. They have been polling users of "alternate" operating systems
like the Amiga to see which smaller platforms are worth writing their
browser for. With tools like the web, and email, well this approach is
more affordable than ever.

The cool twist--and I have seen a similar deal all over the net--is the
cute little icon with the URL link. Guys seem to climb all over themselves
to post some of these icons or banners at their sites. And the site and
the banner poster manage to collect quite a bit of response that if anyone
actually had to go out of their way to volunteer the same support,
wouldn't do it. So can anything like this benefit our movement?

/I would offer to design one, but someone here would either accuse me of/
/stealing it, or claim it didn't really exist. And after they saw it, it/
/wouldn't be enough, anyway./

So go to it, someone! I'll vote for you, and help get it spread around,
once eveyone has come up with a use and a game-plan.

I find it very disheartening, and at no-ones fault but Commodores, that we Amiga users were once very proud of our system because it was truly a superior system to anything else, including applications. Now we glow when we can just do the same things as other computers. This is very sad!! Ben is right in a way.... There is very few great software manufacturers left in the Amiga world. I still believe that the Amiga OS is superior to most other systems (Windoze!!), but that doesn't do us much good if there is no high quality software to run on it. I don't really know where I'm trying to go with this, but reading Ben's thoughts made me kind of sad....

Recently, I have send a few messages to some larger software firms like Borland, etc.  pleading them to support the Amiga. I don't know if this is wasted effort of what, but I guess it can't hurt.

I have to agree. (Not with the sarcasm, though! :)) I've read some
articles by people in the high end of the recording biz, and the
current top-of-the-line digital stuff at 24 bits is just becoming
satisfactory to them compared to their high-dollar analog equipment.
One guy in particular had some convincing technical arguments behind
his statements that digital should use even 32 bits. Some think it's
overkill, but these people run multi-million dollar pro studios, and
can really hear the difference. My point is that the 16 bit stuff for
the Amiga was great in its day, but things are moving fast. We need
some more advanced hardware to take over. I'm all for improving our
ability to use what we already have, but I would love to see someone
start building a 20 or 24 bit card with nothing but digital I/O on it.
 A friend of mine has a PC and bought a card called WaveCenter. It has
2 ADAT optical interfaces, and 1 pair (in/out) of S/PDIF. The card
will work with 16 or 24 bit audio. This is the kind of card that the
Amiga platform needs. Something looking towards the future (digital). 
A big advantage is the A/D D/A converters are external to the card,
outside, away from all the noise and RFI inside the computer. The ADAT
has become hugely popular, and most decent DAT decks have S/PDIF, or
some digital I/O. With this kind of connection, the silence is
amazing. If you don't have an ADAT, these guys build an affordable
rack mount 8X8 20 bit ADAT compatible A/D D/A converter. I really
think (especially after seeing it first hand) that this is the way to
go for the future. It would be great if we could convince them to
build the same thing for the Amiga. If you want to see it, check out
www.frontierdesign.com.

By the way, my ears are no more 'golden' than anyone elses. If the
real professionals can hear and define the qualitative difference
between 16 bit and 24 bit digital, that's reason enough for me to want
have 24 bit.

First, an introduction:

Hi there, I'm Ben Fuller, at one time I was a Senior Software Engineer for
SunRize Industries -- makers of the AD516/Studio16 Digital Audio Workstation
software and hardware.  Among other things, I was responsible for the
automated mixer in v3.0, and the enhanced SMPTE handling in v3.01.  I also
did the Amiga side of the SoundSwitch software -- including getting it to
work seamlessly in the Video Toaster interface, and the killer Arexx API.  I
created the BigBlocks utility.  I also served as the Build Master at
SunRize.

At one time I was one of the most Die Hard Fanatic Loyalist Developer On A
Jihad To Bring The Whole World To Amiga -- at age 17 I was one of the first
and quite probably the youngest Commercial Developer (# CC01039 -- which for
those that don't know, means I was one of the commercial developers that
attended the 2nd Annual Amiga Developer's Conference in November 1986 --
which was when CATS started the commercial and registered developer
programs -- the numbering started at CC01000).  I was there at the
beginning, and I was there at the end (which, by the way, was in early 1994
when the engineering efforts relating to Amiga inside Commodore effectively
came to a complete stop).  I was very depressed for some time...Then, in
late 1994 a funny thing happened...  I was lucky enough to be part of the
Chicago (aka Win95) beta program...  Preemptive-multitasking, 32-bit
addressing, open device architecture, device independent everything, decent
development tools... It was like deja vu all over again...  I discovered
that (like it says on the Deathbed Vigil t-shirt) there is life after
Commodore.

Now, some thoughts:

I have been monitoring this list for a while, and have noticed a few
misconceptions that I will now attempt to clear up.

Myth #1 -- SunRize produced developer documentation for the Studio 16 3.x
release.
This is simply not true.  A developer kit for the 3.x release does not
exist.  There were a few developers that SunRize worked closely with and
provided limited access to 3.x specific information.  Getting the AmiLINK to
provide SMPTE timecode to Studio16 using the enhanced SMPTE APIs was one
instance.

Myth #2 -- There is some way to playback samples directly from RAM.
While this is technically true (the samples are buffered in RAM), an API for
that particular capability was never created *because it was not required
for the product*.  If you think about this for a minute, it will become
obvious -- Studio16 was designed from the ground up to efficiently move
sample data from the audio hardware on the card to the hard disk and back to
the card.  The only thing that matters is that the sample data gets to the
speakers at exactly the right time -- Just In Time delivery...  not Data
Warehousing.

Myth #3 -- The Amiga is still a viable commercial platform.
This is simply not true.  A viable platform for general purpose computing
must be able to evolve -- both in hardware and software.  A great deal of
capital is required to evolve both hardware and software.  The risk takers
have moved on to investments that will actually give them a return.  The
quality of Amiga software has degraded significantly since The End, and most
(if not all) of those responsible for the best-of-breed applications on
Amiga have left the arena.  It will be extremely difficult if not impossible
to return to the levels of quality neccessary to evolve the platform.

Ok, so what about doing an AHI driver or something...

Troy Silvey contacted me last year and asked if I could supply developer
information for the AD516 and if I would be interested in doing an AHI
driver for the card.  I did not respond for quite some time -- I'm sure he
probably thought that his questions had fallen upon deaf ears.  I did some
initial research on AHI and after a few unsuccessful attempts at getting the
paula driver to work (so that I could examine how the drivers are supposed
to function), I put those ideas back on the shelf.  When I responded to
Troy, in addition to clarifying the mythical existance of developer
documentation for the v3.x release, I indicated that I was extremely busy
with a project at work and could not devote any resources to an AHI driver
at that time, but that I would not rule out doing something after my
schedule pressures had subsided.  I am now doing some additional research on
AHI as time permits, but I have still been unable to get the paula driver to
work -- something that will have to happen before I decide to build a driver
for the AD516.


Best Regards,
Ben Fuller

Hi Ben and thank you for writing, I appreciate it.

About the AHI - I know that an earlier version of the Paula driver had a bug.
I had problems installing it myself. However, the recent version of the
driver works fine here (A4000/030/25). I had to use the preference program to
set it up properly. Also, I think it might be a good idea to contact Martin
Blom directly. He's a nice guy and works fast (used less than 12 hours from
my request for a Studio 16 filesaver to a compiled binary showed up in my mail
- not released yet though). His address is

        mailto:lcs@lysator.liu.se <Martin Blom>


Kind regards,

Yup, but think about this way: we're here to share our interrest in sound
and video editing using on of the greatest packages there is (was?). Ok, so
we are stuck in the past, but the stuff still gives us fun and joy and best
of all: it gets the job done! It also proves that we are not average IQ'ed
mainstreamers that goes with the flow saying 'gack gack' and jump when
others tell us to (M$?) and can't make the optimal out of what we have just
because it's not fashion anymore. I think we should focus on getting the
best out of what we have, I think that's what most people are here for: the
interrest in what the project can bring to their system. Some hope for
miracles and some just for a little improvement - nothing is impossible, it
just take some energy and willingness.

Never say never, though it would require some luck. The best thing is if
Gatway/AI contacted them directly. This has much more influence than a
private person. We should bring AI ideas and let them decide what is
realitic. They are the 'captain of the ship' and I don't think they want us
to hit ground.

Well, just my opinions. :-)

Of course, it's pure logic, 32-bit has higher resolution than 16-bit and is
closer to analog 'resolution'. But however, I disagree with /some/ of the
approach due to a few down to earth things: a) only people in billion
dollars or so studios can hear the difference, b) the same people are
probably fanatic about it, c) who is gonna hear the end result and what is
it stored at and played through ? d) what is most important of the end
result: the content or the methode ?

Most of the cases 16-bit is more than good enough. For instance, video has a
bandwidth approximatly 33khz and even CD-quality is overkill. More and more
TV channels broadcast in MPEG - the quality is reduced automatically. Then,
most people who watch this video, what sound system do they use ? That's for
video. For sound: to squeece the quality of 32-bit the listener needs a
pretty good amplifier and even better loudspeakers, a special built
listening room and of course good ears.

I am sure there are many legitimate reasons to use 32-bit sound (such as
reducing integer errors etc.) and I am not against development, quite the
contrary, but I think we should compare the weights of it all, is 32-bit
worth the trouble when 16-bit still impress people and _most_ people won't
hear the difference ? Of course, back in the days when digital was new I'm
sure people said the same thing about that as I say about 32-bit sound now
:)  But I am just trying to look at it from different angles, I am open
myself to review my opinions if the reason can be justified. Right now I
don't feel they are.

I think that might be difficult. I'm sure Ben Fuller has an approximate

has Internet. :-/

Hi, Gord! I too, have been sad over this more than once. A few days ago
I tried to articulate here, on the list, what Ben brought clarity to.

But we have ourselves to blame, too. I mentioned denial, as practiced
by disfunctional (ie, abused) families. Many in the Amiga community have
denied these problems exist, so of course there is often very little
discussion of solutions. People need to demand better, of themselves and
the companies/developers invoved, and make efforts that can be useful.
We hid our heads in the sand, not noticing positive, competitive changes
and new, better ideas on other platforms.


Gary Mula's letter last night welcoming Ben spoke some practical and
heartfelt words. Paraphrasing in my own unique and dense-headed style:

(1) The platform is viable as long as one can do one's job with it,
without being compromised. If one has a sizable investment, knows and
fluently uses the tools, it might still be more efficient to keep doing
so than to invest in a new platform and its associated complexities.

(2) Many of us have a dream still. And if a torch is lit here {AHI
driver} and a torch is lit there {improved system-wide printing for
instance} . . . why, soon we will be able to light our own village, and
beyond! (Hopefully no Irving Goulds or Mehdi Alis will be anywhere near
a grass hut with a torch.)


>I still believe that the Amiga OS is superior to most other systems
>(Windoze!!), but that doesn't do us much good if there is no high
>quality software to run on it.

Windozzze, as an OS, is a bloated hack, but they have accumulated /some/
good ideas there. And '95 includes some utilities, features, etc, that
we are in great need of to be taken seriously in the late 90s. And the
development tools are great. And yes, for a professional in any field,
or a hobbyist, there are many killer-apps. We lag behind.

>Recently, I have send a few messages to some larger software firms like
>Borland, etc. pleading them to support the Amiga. I don't know if this
>is wasted effort of what, but I guess it can't hurt.

That is great. Amiga users (and this includes some developers!) are the
reason the Amiga lives. Their advocacy is heartening. I spend a fair
amount of time (and spent much as a beta-tester and dealer) talking to
developers that are already here on the platform. Some of them are
incredibly sharp. But different ones need feedback, encouragement, funds,
direction, prodding. Some of them have been here from the start and have
suffered The End.

I think the best we can do is support with our dollars, our hearts, our
ideas--with our eyes open and our ears to the ground. Things can go
anywhere--

Yup, but think about this way: we're here to share our interrest in sound
and video editing using on of the greatest packages there is (was?). Ok, so
we are stuck in the past, but the stuff still gives us fun and joy and best
of all: it gets the job done! It also proves that we are not average IQ'ed
mainstreamers that goes with the flow saying 'gack gack' and jump when
others tell us to (M$?) and can't make the optimal out of what we have just
because it's not fashion anymore. I think we should focus on getting the
best out of what we have, I think that's what most people are here for: the
interrest in what the project can bring to their system. Some hope for
miracles and some just for a little improvement - nothing is impossible, it
just take some energy and willingness.

Never say never, though it would require some luck. The best thing is if
Gatway/AI contacted them directly. This has much more influence than a
private person. We should bring AI ideas and let them decide what is
realitic. They are the 'captain of the ship' and I don't think they want us
to hit ground.

Well, just my opinions. :-)

Hi Ben and thank you for writing, I appreciate it.

About the AHI - I know that an earlier version of the Paula driver had a bug.
I had problems installing it myself. However, the recent version of the
driver works fine here (A4000/030/25). I had to use the preference program to
set it up properly. Also, I think it might be a good idea to contact Martin
Blom directly. He's a nice guy and works fast (used less than 12 hours from
my request for a Studio 16 filesaver to a compiled binary showed up in my mail
- not released yet though). His address is

        mailto:lcs@lysator.liu.se <Martin Blom>

This is how i use the sample playback on the Ad516 via Wrench:

First o load S16, than i load Wrench.
Than load a sample into wrench.
My F1 key executes an Arexx scrip which plays a sample loaded in wrench via
the Ad516 hardware.
So, S16 did not load a sample, wrench played it directly.
I do not know if there are any copy-rights on the script, when not i wll send it to
you Dhomas.

The problem is that the sales of Amiga software are tiny - a few copies a
year, typically. Most Amiga users have had their machines for ages and have
all the software they need. This will only be remedied if Index and Lotus
Pacific and DCE sell lots of Amigas to new owners. 
The market has also been spoiled by the spread of free software on cover disks
or elsewhere. Who would buy a sequencer when B&P is free?
Hardware is selling well - Power in the UK sold 70 68040 accelerators in a
week. Several thousand PPC cards have been sold.
Even so, I think people would buy a completely new kind of program, or a
really original game.

It depends whether you are talking about masters or final consumer copies.
Using the best possible quality for masters makes sense even if current
consumer technology can't handle it. Look at the quality of sound we now hear
from CD versions of 1940s recordings (taken from original parts) compared to
what listeners then got on their 78s.

Hey, Don, mind if I interject (no, not /that/  I hope  :-D) . . . 

Pro-type users and serious hobbyists (which probably all buyers of the
Sunrize products are) probably have different buying-habits than gamers and
dabblers. We will pay serious dollars and spend time learning new tools and
enhancements. I bet this is a larger, unspoken group than we imagine.

I know that I will always buy the next ImageFX or sequencer if it increases
my creativity, power, and perhaps ease-of-use. I will ask for more features,
capabilites, and modules, and ask for better interfaces. I sold almost
exclusively to this type of client when I was a dealer. They are still out
there, and most still love their Amigas (even if they have had to expand to
other platforms to compete). They are waiting for it to happen here again,
I'm sure.

This will attract some new buyers, especially if other things are happening.

>The market has also been spoiled by the spread of free software on cover
>disks or elsewhere. Who would buy a sequencer when B&P is free?

Yeah, through desperation, some software houses have given away the store.
Others are just dumping less-than-state-of-art titles though. The pleasure
and power of even the _current_ AmigaOS coupled with a better sequencer --
well there are some amazing things that are being done elsewhere that
increase productivity in this regard. And they have manuals.

/Content/ is of course the most important to the artist -- if not always in
the entertainment industry. But Method can often help Content find its way
to its own level.

Archival is still not close to being solved in the industry. Longevity, as
well as accuracy, is being sought. And higher-bit-digital is needed for
music-for-listening, if not AV. The final consumer quality of the 16-bit CD
is pretty high, when good mastering has taken place. AD516 hardware is still
useful for many things, because it was well-designed. It can still
contribute, especially when used in a project studio surrounded by other
quality items.

You sound like you are offended - that was not my intention so if you are
I'm sorry. You worked at Sunrize so I assumed you would have known (from
others at Sunrize).

Sunrize made a few astounding claims in their Dealer Letters from time to
time. Could those be true? you ask. At one time I believed they were: they
sent out a lot of high-class promos, and always great glossies!

Most likely, the problem was *not* that they hadn't sold enough: they had
entered another hardware product into the marketplace at about the same time
Amigas became unavailable, the entire marketplace was freaking out, and
visions-of-jumping danced in some heads. R&D, advertizing, salaries, and no
new slots to put the products into...

-->Lots of good info there Serge! ;-)  I've yet to try to sync up my Tascam 38 to

Glad to help  :>)

-->One thing Gord and others ( me too ) might benefit from is a CD that has SMPTE 

Interesting concept.

You sound like you are offended - that was not my intention so if you are
I'm sorry. You worked at Sunrize so I assumed you would have known (from
others at Sunrize).

AMEN. I hate quoting such big chunks in email but this is all so true,

Actually there have been a couple of interim solutions to store 20-bit sound
using 16-bit cards, but they are not especially applicable here . . . The
AD516 quality -- in a setting with the proper outboard gear, and all
precautions taken to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio (read: solve all
grounding problems & consider balanced power) -- CAN STILL BLOW MINDS!

What ever happended to "John" I think his name was, one of the other guys from SunRize...... "John Hickson" or something like that.... Or maybe I'm wrong....  Anyway, does anyone know what happened to him?  Or is he working for the same company as you Ben?

Oukidouki, let's try to get back on track.

I have a few requests for some of the people who has been forward on the
list:

- John Blyth: how's the analyse on the config files going ?

- Bob Maple/Alfonso Curiel: why don't you two cooperate on the CMX <->
Cuelist converter. I will give you both a free version of the forthcoming
QMaster arexx host if you would like to make an arexx program to do the
convertion (Qmaster supply all needed arexx comands to handle cuelist files
and it does it pretty fast (asm) :)

- Greenboy: I have contacted Stephan Kost (SoundFX) and a guy called Doug
Shannon. If you like I can channel further contact to you. The contact I am
trying to establish with them is related to support and information
(respectivly).

Greenboy also mentioned a brainstorming so why don't we have one. If you
have _anything_ on your mind, big or small, genious or stupid, doesn't
matter, just let us know.

Ok, I'll start off with some ideas of my own:

- Graphical editor of mixer files. To adjust and fine-"tune" the envelopes,
better grouping, arexx and more.

- Filter processing. Lowpass, highpass, bandpass and notch filtering. I have
already made the FPU/asm routines (almost realtime on my 030/25 so it should
be capable of doing realtime on a 040/25 or better), but need a gui and AHI
interface...

- Library to handle the Studio 16 files. Allow simple handling.

For QMaster:

Arexx script that can fix paths in cuelists. Useful if you move samples on
your HD and don't want to spend time on editing every single entry.

Jukebox - rather useless. Can parse a sampledir and put samples after one
eachother, hence jukebox. Nice when you have company I guess.

AppendCuelists - merges cuelists _horizontally_ . Studio 16's own merge
function can only merge vertically. All entries from the second cuelist are
grouped together so they can easily be adjusted.

.. I'm empty, it's getting late :) but please append the list. Just have in
mind that modules that interface with Studio 16 directly will be unlikely to
have maded so consider all projects to be external programs to accompny
Studio 16.

Hello Don;

-->Did you ever try the SMPTEout module with the Amiga genlocked to a video

I don't have any video equipment. Not too familiar with that domain,
unfortunately.


-->camera? That ought to give a more accurate timing, but I haven't had a chance

Please pardon my ignorance, but I'm not sure I understand your setup. Would the
SMPTEOut be used as the Master? Is the video camera used as a slave? Who supplies
the genlock code to synch the Amiga? Or is it vice versa? Just curious.

-->You don't mention what version of the SMPTEoutput you tested. I have 1.02.

I think it's the latest (1.02???).


-->As the software multitasks, perhaps it is being delayed by having to share
-->time with other tasks?

I was thinking about this after I wrote my rambling response. It occurred to me
that CyberGraphx (v2) might be a culprit in this situation. It has already been
established that CyberGraphx creates audio glitches during video updates. I know
that other users swear by the SMPTEOut's accuracy.

Whenever I get a chance to update to CyberGraphx v3 (hopefully soon!), I'll try
and see if SMPTEOut is any more accurate than it is now.

Perhaps, in the interests of pseudo-science, other users who don't use CyberGraphx
(and even those who do), could, at their leisure, try out this simple test, and
report their findings back to the mailing list. All they need is the SMPTEOut
Module, an AD516, and a sequencer which locks up with Studio16 (B&P, etc).


1. Program a five minute drum beat onto the sequencer. Even a metronome would do.

2. Using the Studio16 Internal SMPTE Generator, record a few five minute tracks
onto the Cuelist. The idea is to keep to the beat playing back from the sequencer.
Simple guitar would do, or even hand clapping.

3. Just to see what happens, change the SMPTE time frame of the Studio16, on the
Preferences menu, and play back the Cuelist you have just recorded. For ex, if you
first recorded with 30FPS, drop it to 24FPS. What you should notice is that the
Cuelist tracks start to drift after a while (in reference to the sequencer). This
will happen because the sequencer (and all other MIDI equipment) will adjust
itself to whatever speed SMPTE is at. The Cuelist can't do that.

4. Now that you know what to expect, return the SMPTE time frame to the original
setting (30FPS), and try playing back the Cuelist using the SMPTEOut module this
time. If your SMPTEOut module is as inaccurate as mine, once again you should
notice a drift occuring.


Just a thought.

There was no one at SunRize named John when I was there.

Both were great guys.  Very friendly and helpful


Of course Anthony was head honch.  Early on I talked to him
often as well.... I really wonder what he is up to...??

I looked for this option when I signed up for the Studio16 list and I
didn't see it. Is there anyway to get the list in a digest version? At
first it was no big deal...A few message a day. Now I got to check mail and
I see, "Downloading message 1 of 37". YIKES!

Yes..... Todd Modjeski is the guy I'm talking about.... I don't know why I was
thinking John.... sorry!!!!

I talked to Todd once, but he didn't seem to be too interested in Studio16
anymore....

Hello Richard;

-->In your very informative reply to Gord Clink you mentioned:

Very kind.


-->Do I understand this correctly? You had drifting problems between the Studio 16
-->cuelist and B&P using only the internal SMPTE generator in Studio 16? Was this
-->because the Studio 16 tracks were originally recorded using an external SMPTE
-->source?

Yes indeed. The timing problems were caused because I had striped my R-8
reel-to-reel (my Master SMPTE) with an inaccurate time code. As a result, the
subsequent tracks recorded onto the Cuelist (using the R-8 as SMPTE Master) were
affected. Why? A small example:

Let's say we want to make a simple song. A MIDI drum sequence (played on the B&P
sequencer), an analog bass, an acoustic guitar, and a vocal (or two, for effect).

Let's say, for argument's sake that the SMPTEOut generates a code which is
slightly slow (say it loses 1 second after 3 minutes). If we use the SMPTEOut as
our SMPTE Master (or we use the reel-to-reel R-8; it's the same thing, relatively
speaking, because the R-8 is striped using the SMPTEOut), then the sequencer (B&P)
will play along at that slightly slower speed.

Why, you may ask? It's got to do with the nature of the MIDI/SMPTE conversion
process, which B&P uses. It doesn't differentiate between slower, or faster
incoming code (nor should it, really). It simply converts the highs, and lows of
the analog SMPTE levels into an equivalent binary MIDI value. If you were to slow
down the incoming SMPTE code to 1/10 its original speed (you can do this with the
pitch control of your ree-to-reel), you will find that B&P will slow down its
count accordingly. Of course, at this speed, you would probably notice an audible
difference.

The catch is, however, if the SMPTE code is only SLIGHTLY slow, as in this
example, you won't be able to notice an audible difference.

In our example, this means that the MIDI drum track which we've programmed in B&P
will also play slightly slower than it really should. OK, now it's time to lay
down an analog bass track, an acoustic guitar, and a lead vocal, all onto the
Studio16 Cuelist, but, using this slowed down MIDI drum track (or click track, or
metronome) as a reference, albeit a faulty one. You can see what's going to
happen. All the analog tracks will be recorded onto the Cuelist in synch with that
reference. (Keep in mind, however, you should never have a problem with drifting
as long as you ALWAYS use the SMPTEOut as your SMPTE Master.)

So where, oh where is the problem you ask? If we try to use the Internal SMPTE
Generator, which is an accurate source, to play back our freshly recorded Cuelist
tracks, we will find that the tracks will start to drift (maybe after a few
minutes). This is because, this time, the incoming SMPTE code is the correct
speed, and a result, B&P will convert the code at the correct speed (ie: slightly
faster than before). This means that the MIDI drum beat will also be generated
slighly faster. No big deal right? Wrong. Don't forget, Studio16 will NOT play
back its analog tracks slightly faster. It will either play at the sampled speed,
or it won't (let's assume 44.1Khz). It doesn't dynamically convert on-the-fly. In
this case, the erroneous SMPTEOut is not inaccurate enough to actually stop
Studio16 from playing. As a result, we now have a drum track which plays back at a
slightly faster speed, and the bass, guitar, and vocals, which are in synch with
each other, but all slghtly slower than the critical drum track. Say hello to Mr.
Drift. Not good at all. You can kiss that session goodbye.

How do I know the Internal SMPTE is accurate? Well, using the same test described
above, I've compared it with the output of my rack-mount Fostex 4010 SMPTE
Generator (Rock-steady, remember?  :>)   ). Very accurate. Very compatible. No
drift . No problems.

I'm guessing here, but it's my impression that the Internal SMPTE Generator will
always be inherently more accurate than the SMPTEOut Module, because the Internal
SMPTE uses the AD516 hardware (and crystal). The SMPTEOut, on the other hand, is a
stand-alone s/w module which doesn't even require the presence of a hardware card.
Perhaps it uses the motherboard clock? Whatever it does, it probably polls the
Zorro bus, which will engender delays (pure speculation). Maybe others can
clarify. In my particular case, it may even be affected by CyberGraphx audio
update problems (documented previously).

In response to your query: yes, "the relationship between Studio 16 and B&P is
solid, as long as the internal SMPTE on the AD516 is the timing source for both."

I feel it's important to stress, that, almost any source will be accurate,
relatively speaking, as long as it's the same source which is used all the time
for record and playback. The danger is though, that if your supposed "standard"
SMPTE source is not really standard (compared to the rest of the world), you are
limiting the "transportability" of your recordings. This may, or may not be a
problem for you, depending on your personal needs. For what it's worth, if you
haven't already guessed, my personal feeling is, you don't screw around with your
SMPTE source. It controls everything. Maybe even the size of your paycheque. HA!


-->internal SMPTE of the AD516 as my timing source. I played a 90 second sequence

Careful. 90 seconds does not give you much of a chance to catch phasing, or
drifting problems. Give it a good 5 minutes.


-->and simultaneously recorded it to a Studio 16 track. I repeated the procedure
-->but recorded the sequence to a different track. I then played the recorded
-->tracks  simutaneously to see how accurate the synchronization was. The two
-->tracks were pretty close (a very slight chorus effect showed up indicating a
-->small offset,  probably less than 10 milliseconds). I now wonder if I should

If I understand you correctly, you are recording your B&P sequence onto your
Studio16 Cuelist. Correct? I've never tried that. In the process you describe, you
should always be right on, because your SMPTE source remains unchanged. The
phasing is likely because of B&P.

I have experienced the "phasing" you describe, except, in my case, I've noticed it
while using B&P directly. It's most likely caused by the amount of randomness you
allow B&P while playing your sequence. For ex, if you insert a Pattern Tool onto
one of your drum tracks, which contains the same data as the actual track itself,
and play them both, you will notice the phasing on SOME of the notes. This is
because B&P will add a slight randomness while playing each note (to "naturalize"
it), so that the two same notes won't play with exactly the same MIDI
characteristics. The same would happen if you played the same track twice in a row
(which you would never notice), or, as in your case, recorded the same track onto
two synched up Cuelist tracks, allowing for a direct comparision. You may want to
verify your B&P settings.


Rest easy. Synch In Peace....

Agreed. I'd even offer a downpayment (conditionally, of course). Pay the Piper so
we can Play with the Piper.

Hello Gary;

-->I have to say though that my trouble shooting didn't bring me to the same
-->conclusion about the Sunrize SMPTE Output.  

Hmmm. Like I've mentioned on other responses, I'm beginning to suspect the evil
workings of CyberGraphx v2...    :>)

I understand your point of view though, but as per my experience, I still stand by
my statement. I'll take a h/w driven clock device over a s/w one any day.
Nonetheless, I'm glad to see others are using SMPTEOut with success. The last
thing I wanted to do was start some unwarranted fear-mongering.

-->get the prompt.  Mind you this is when there in no SMPTE present at all.

I've noticed the same thing occuring at times. For a while, I thought this was
just a bug with the Studio16 s/w. Just added to the confusion, whatthehey.

Just for head food guys. The ADSP 2105 can be cascaded can it not?
Would filters or buffers allow the ASDP 2105 to do 32 bit sampling?
I'm not sure whether I'm off base or not. I do some work with IC
hardware and I decided a while back to keep my head in my music for
now. But I was just wondering. Maybe Mr. Fuller would care to answer.
I understand completely if he doesn't have the time to respond.

In my research on the ADSP2105 I only found it capable of doing 16-bit
operations.

BTW: Did you guys know that the DSP has an Serial IO ? That means the DSP
itself can emulate modems (eg. voice modem, tone recognition etc.). I dunno
it the serial capability is accessible through the card though..

It's fully possible to feed sound to the DSP itself outside Studio 16 - I
have already manged to do so, but what I haven't managed is to control the
environment (setting volumes for inputs, output oscillators, frequency, pan
for channels etc.). The sound spends its time playing, but no sound comes
out so I need an overview on the environment.

Maybe Ben has some valuable information on the hardware specs/dsp registres
etc. ?

You've got MY attention.

To go where no sound card has gone before. Why not? (rhetorically
speaking of course).

Hello everybody,


after my recent posting of some notes about AudioLabs' products
(the already released AudioLab16 and the forthcoming ProStation)
I've got interesting feedback both in the mailing list and
privately. Thanks.

It seems that part of the audience in this list be excited by
the chance of running a modern (1998) hi-end application on
their AD516 hardware and I confirm my interest in making it
happen.



During recent days the discussion in this ml focused on the need
for an AHI driver, and the difficulties involved in getting one.

On this theme, I'd like to clarify (this may interest at least
"that" part of the audience) that an AHI driver for the AD516
would NOT allow to use ProStation or AudioLab16 with the Sunrize
hardware.



AudioLabs' products require AudioLabs' drivers. They support
every major ZII/ZIII board (including those not supported
by AHI) both in analog and digital modes plus analog motherboard
output.

We don't make drivers, the hardware manifacturers do after we
reach a commercial agreement. As for the development itself,
it's just a matter of an hour of work, on average, with our
supervision.

Unfortunatly the AD516 is the only ZII board without a driver
as there isn't a manifacturer we can discuss with.


(I'm not stating that AudioLabs will never support AHI, simply
there are no plans as of today).



Thanks for reading.




All the best,

dr. Maurizio Ciccione
AudioLabs, Digital Audio Engineering

The video camera (or blackburst generator or whatever) would supply the
timing clock, a genlock would synchronize the Amiga to the video source,
and SMPTEout would output SMPTE based on the timing signals provided by the
video camera.

The idea being that each SMPTE frame is synchronized with each video frame
(ie., so you don't have a new SMPTE frame occuring halfway through a video
frame etc.).

It is quite possible such a synchronization method would provide a more
stable timing reference over a period of time when compared to an aging
Amiga no longer in its prime.

Whenever I stripe with SMPTEout, it will be the only program running (all
utils and hacks turned off). I haven't yet had any problems, even when
striping to very abused old decks.

CGX v3 is much better, I can run Studio16 with a couple tracks going and
not get any audio interruptions when I change screens.

Are you saying you are running the audio out of the Amiga into the SMPTE
input and using SMPTEout to drive Studio16?  If this is the case then I
don't think you will ever get that to work accurately.

greenboy here, reporting for duty! Send 'em my way. Must warn you: my 516 is
currently on loan. But I'm up for anything I can do to further the cause.

Yeah, including talking about the larger digital audio issues that exist.

FI, I brought up higher-bit sampling awhile back. Geez, all of a sudden guys
are talking 32-bit. That is like using 40-bit to store (true-color) IFFs.
You have to have some incredible hardware to get 32-bit to be any more
useful than what I consider to be practical: 20-bit or 24-bit. Thank god we
aren't discussing 96MHz sampling rates. [Oops!]

Hi, Maurizio. I hope to be a future customer of yours. But I do have a few
questions.

I'm curious why. I'm a real big fan of system-wide support and device-
independent support. I think it is healthier for the platform, and for
developers.

So, have you with Ben Fuller here at the ml? Or any other former Sunrizers?

>(I'm not stating that AudioLabs will never support AHI, simply
>there are no plans as of today).

I am imagining, just imagining that an AHI driver for the AD516 exists. What
would be the advantages and disadvantages of your software using it? As
opposed to its own drivers.

I wonder if it is the same thing...in that, the way S16 -hooks internally- to

S16 -hooks- to time code it hears coming in it's smpte sync input.

I am beginning to look at the inter relationships between - -

  3. the SMPTE Output
  4. the SMPTE sync input on the back of the AD516

>From my memory of 3 plus years ago when I went round and round with 
Todd Modjeski about this, it seems to me that there is some 
calculating the S16 does everytime you start a playback in the 
cuelist.

I think it is standard in the industry (direct-to-disk-recording) to 
calculate the sample rate x start time x length of the sample(s) to 
determine where and when something should play.  This should make 
discrete sample events start at there smpte time accurately, but 
doesn't help long samples adjust there playback if time code is
playing back at a different rate than when they were recorded. 
The SMPTE Lock in the Preferences I thought was an attempt to keep 
S16 in a constant or almost constant update mode as far as where S16
was in relation to any external sync source. 

I know that S16 can only playback one sample rate at a time, but I 
thought there was some recalc done everytime according to the above 
mentioned equation to account for some varience in time code speed.
Of course there is a point where S16 is not going to be able to keep 
up or back.

was this comparison done with the 4010 recorded to tape and played
back or generated directly?

Are you sure about that?  When Sunrize released SMPTEout I thought
the issue of accuracy was top of their list and designed with that
idea in mind.  If it was so obvious that the design as you describe
of Internal SMPTE was so much more (logically) accurate, why did 
they not use AD516 in some way to generate it?  I don't think it was
so that they could sell it to more people because it was not
dependant upon having an AD516.
 

Once again I am not saying you are wrong,  it's just not all adding
up for me yet.

>SMPTE source is not really standard (compared to the rest of the

Is there any type of SMPTE analyzer device that could check the
integrity/accuracy of SMPTE code?


>don't screw around with your SMPTE source. 

AGREED! 

>It controls everything. Maybe even the size of your paycheque.
>HA!

oooooH, a scary but wise thought.

I stayed up very late last night 5AM! testing some of these ideas
and a few others.  My results were mixed at best.  When my head is
clear....hopefully by tomorrow, I will post my observations.


Thanks Serge and Richard.  This is an area that really needs to be
cleared up.  I'm down wit it!

Please bare with my scrutiny....just looking for my own silver bullets.

All very good points. However I can hear the difference between cruddy
16 bit, and really good 16 bit. I can hear (if I strain really hard) a
tiny difference between 16 bit and 20 bit. beyond that is wasted on
me. I am somewhat fanatic (?) about it. I want the best I can get
without having to get a second mortgage. For me half the fun is
getting there so content and method are equal. These are just my
opinions, nothing more.

I agree. For video applications, this is overkill. I like to have a
master that's higher quality than the final destination, though. For
audio apps, I want to make sure it's as good as I can afford to make
it.

Right. Somewhere in-between (20 or 24 bits) is really, really good,
and attainable now. I don't think audio cards for the Amiga have to
jump all the way from 16 bit to 32 bit.

Some fanatics may argue the under/over tones that you can't hear may affect
the ones you can. One would have to put it on a scope to find out.

I agree with much of the aforementioned.
Don't forget also that other things could be encrypted in the headroom
whether it be 24 or 32 bit. (MIDI for example is a 31.25 Khz signal).

I'm sure some of you guys could think of many other applications even if MIDI
sounds like a lame idea.

 . . . . Just for the sake of an interesting topic,

Here I guess that you are talking about something that, in the analog world,
power-amp and mixer designers debate: whether extended frequency-response
_way_ beyond the accepted range of human hearing is desirable, due to the
effect it has on phase linearity in the "audible" range.

Though in digital, we are concerned with aliasing, the effects of 24-pole
(or more) filtering on phase, and clock-noise interaction.

>Don't forget also that other things could be encrypted in the headroom

This scares me a little. 8-| You have to have a pretty incredible scheme,
and a hardware design (dsp that has more horsepower) to ensure that one
signal doesn't modulate the other. Also, the number of input/output channels
and other dsp functions such as real-time mixing, eq and fx would be
compromised.

But in our incredible world someone could prove me wrong next week. If
someone isn't already designing something of that nature around a more
/powerful/ engine, I would say that they should consider it; that's a great
idea!

Hi,

I'm gonna be busy in the nearest future so if someone would like to take
over the stuff I've got on direct-to-DSP code let me know. The source is in
asm, but you will get the needed extra files.

Hi,

I'm gonna be busy in the nearest future so if someone would like to take
over the stuff I've got on direct-to-DSP code let me know. The source is in
asm, but you will get the needed extra files.

Status: it loads DSP code fine and spend correct time on the sample
(controlled by the DSP interrupts), but no sound..

I'm not gonna work too much on this anyway since there is a little hope for
an AHI driver.

Never say never. The original instigator is back online! Me.
Ben Fuller and I are conversing again about AHI for 516.
I don't know if, or what will happen yet. But I'm willing, Ben now
seems available and I can always sleep sometime next year :)

Dream's not dead yet. It ain't over till the paula sings taps. My 516 is
still getting a hella'va work out evey day and if AHI comes along, I'll
give it more to do.
Personally I looking forward to a AD516 mach II some day.

Thanks Greenboy,

As Dr. McCoy might say, "Damn it Jim I'm a musician not a doctor!" and
I've only got 24 hours a day to address a myriad of other things. I have to
keep my proirities(I'm sorry to say). I wish I could thrust my
attentions to the engineering issues on the Amiga.

It would be interesting to see what family of DSP's have inherited the
mantle of 24 bit. But as for our discussion here I was just trying to
mention the previously non-mentioned for the sake of conjecture as it
applies to the ADSP2105.

I love my little giant killer Amiga and I'm not ready to buy another platform 
yet. And I have a sneaking suspicion that some Amiga die hard engineers at 
Gateway haven't given up on it either (to say the least).

Regards,

Brian Fields

Realistically, it would have to be a PCI bus card, not Zorro3. By the time it
happens, there will be Amiga motherboards with the PCI bus, and the main thing
is to make sure there is Amiga software for it as well as NT Alpha or
whatever. 
The first version of the BoXeR motherboard has a couple of live ISA slots, but
the second version, in about 12 months, will use PCI. Micronik have a Zorro
board for their towers with live PCI slots. The InsideOut is an Amiga on a
card to fit a PCI slot, probably available in about 6 months time.

Ben - 

Do you have any idea how the S16 SMPTE triggers playing on the PAR card?
Presumably there is a message port or something.
I am wondering whether it would be possible to trigger the PAR direcly from
Bars&Pipes to play at a given time (SMPTE), for setups with a PAR but no S16.
It would be a tool or accessory for B&P. You can run an ARexx script from B&P,
but a direct trigger would be more solid.
On the PAR, you click the SMPTE button and then set a time. When the S16 gets
to that time, the PAR starts playing.

Help!!

Does anyone know if you can do a recover files on a partition
using the BigBlocks format?

I did a session a few days ago, finished the music, sent out the 
master,  deleated the files to make room for new stuff,  and now
discovered the master has some problems I hadn't heard.

Anybodies immediate help will gain you instant favor and gratitude!

If I remember correectly, the PAR is monitoring SMPTE timecode using
the Studio16 SmpteSink API.  The PAR connects to Studio16 and watches
the timecode, triggering video playback at the appropriate time.

To provide the same functionality from B&P would require creating
a Studio16 placebo that provides the SMPTE APIs.  To make things
more complicated, there are two sets of smpte api functions -- pre 3.01
and 3.01.  I don't know which one the PAR uses.

Doable, but not practical.

Ben.

DiskSalv 3 or 4 (I can't remember) should be able to recover the
files if they have not been overwritten.

Hm, email is INDEED an evil thing :) little = "I see a small hope" or "it

Hi Troy,

please see message to greenboy :)

>Dream's not dead yet.

Agreed. Sorry guys for the misunderstanding. I'll reword it here:

As it seem that Ben eventually will make an AHI driver I see no point for me
to spend much work on the direct-DSP code right now since I will be quite
busy in near future. Therfore, if someone is interrested in look at what I
have got so far just take contact and I'll send it. Besides, I will have to
learn AD21xx assembler, buy a PC, buy Analoge Devices developer package,
create Amiga interfacing etc.

I hope that was better ?? :)

Hm, email is INDEED an evil thing :) little = "I see a small hope" or "it
looks like we might get an AHI anyway". I am positive to it! :)

Fantastic!  Some of the files were written to a Jaz drive with a
standard format,  Quarter back tools spent around an hour to 
catalogue all files.  I am pretty sure QB doesn't work on my BigBlock
partitions, hence my panic.

I'll get DiskSalv right away.

Somehow I knew you would have some info on this.



Thanks Ben....anytime I can return the favor!

>(MIDI for example is a 31.25 Khz signal)

MIDI is actually a serial baud rate and not a khz audio signal.
But now that you mention it, It sounds like a good ideal to
update this very old standard. No reason midi info couldn't be carried
on an sample output just like audio. It would eliminate all these
pesty midi cables all over the place. In/out/through/smpte and all
other timing/ data codes could run on a single line to each unit.
Ok where do I pick up my patent form?

Speaking of Ben, perhaps he could tell us just who owns the rights
to the AD516, AD1012 and the software. Apparently, no one know.
Perhaps he does???? Ben???

Haven't been there lately, but I believe Aminet is up & running; definitely
some of the partial & mirror sites. Util/disk or something like that or
search using "undelete file disk utility" or some of those keywords.

In the next hour or less I will have more for you.

There is pruning twigs, and then there is sawing down the wrong redwood. ;^/

Sounds good, but wouldn't there be newer chips around now? And who would have
the rights to the design?

Thanks. That info will save a lot of wasted time.
The next thing is to check out the ARExx method and see if it will do.

Hmmm was it:
    "If I told you, I'd have to kill you"
or
    "If I told you, They'd have to kill me"

Why would you or anyone else knowing that information be a good idea?
What useful purpose would be served?  Do you think whomever owns
those rights would enjoy being harrassed?  There isn't even a remote
chance that those SunRize products will ever be resurrected, in any
form, period.   Remember, the Amiga is NOT a viable commercial platform.

Griemes has Ami-Back Tools, I don't know if he kept current on it or not.
I believe v1.04 (06/23/930 is the last. Disable any disk-caching
(Hypercache?). Use the SCSI Search utility of Ami-Back Tools. If it can
return the proper information about your BigBlocks partition, the 9-1-1
module *should* be able to save your files as long as those areas of the
disk have not been written to yet.

Be cautious and restore to another drive if you are able. If there are
several versions of the same file-name it can handle that. If worse comes
to worst, the Reviver module can undelete on that Volume.

In the meanwhile, browse the web for dealers in your area. Seems like
QuikPak had quite a few, though many could be pretty Toaster-related.
Need any URLs for mail-order houses? DiskSalv shoul be pretty stocked.
The publisher has a site, I believe it is Intangible Assets. 

I will check around too, and Ami-Back tools is pretty great to use. Think I
have run it from floppy as well as hard drive before, so I should be able to
walk you through that. QBTools, too damn old.

I don't know if it works, but even DiskSalv2 supports BigBlocks. I got it
off either Aminet or some coverdisk. Never used it. Ami-Back Tools manual
indicates that it can; seem to remember doing this once when I ran a bunch
of comparative DiskSpeed tests using 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8092 block-
size formatted drive.

Yeah, I knew it was a reach but I thought I might get some synapses
opened up in that direction.

Software midi converter using a CD as a source. Hm-m-m-m-......

Oh well. I don't wnt to get too far off the AD516/S16 topic.

BTW; I heard that the GMPlay software in Aminet uses a routine to play
14 bit using two 8 bit sound channels on the Amiga. I haven't looked
at it but I'm about to. Similar to my thoughts on this by using two
AD516's. Any thoughts guys? This might also be incentive for someone
to do some more development that may not be as difficult as thought.

Am I thinking too much? Why do idea merchants never get paid? LOL

TFN,

Thanks Dave,

I have an order in right now with Safe Harbor for a 4gig drive.
I think I'll add DiskSalv to it.  Hopefully they can get it here
by Tuesday.

But why would they refuse to sell unwanted ami techno data to an
interested party? I don't think we're talking about begging for freebies
here, but a ligitimate bussiness interest. To pay $$$ for it would not
be harrasment would it? And what about the 516 specs?
It's still a great card and it would still sell too. No R&D,
just sell the current card design. If AHI happens, then it definitly
would
sell again. Your right about the useful purpose though. That sunrize PCI 
design may have been left in such a state that it would be better to
start
from scratch. But if that's the way it happens, It will be a couple of
years
before I'll be able to retire B&P and the 516 for the next ami
generation. 

>Remember, the Amiga is NOT a viable commercial platform.

Yeah, go ahead piss in our cheerios. Everyone else does. :)
I'll simply add a "...YET" to the end of that sentence.

If microsoft were a star, it would be a black hole. Ask all the data
it has quarked over these past years.

i have found that neither disksalv nor quaterback tools seems to work.  the 
only utility i've found to work consistently is a prog called recovery.  it's 
saved my butt more than once.  i don't know if it's on aminet - i got it off

Folks,

I  have  just reformatted my HD to increase the block size from 512 to 1024.  Ever
since  the  reformat,  everytime  I put Studio16 into RECORD the program locks up.
Anybody got any guidance for me?

actually, i think the amiga would be more akin to a "red giant" burning
out it's last embers.

anyways, an AHI driver would prove very useful indeed.  i'd pay.

Hi.

Tried this myself several years ago after running a series of DiskSpeed
tests. Can't remember what I concluded, but went back to letting BigBlocks
do it. Better ask the author of BigBlocks <grin>. Ben, does it feel like
mailbomb yet?

What if I or someone else wanted to purchase said products. Obviously,
they don't want it nor do they have any need for it. So whats the
problem...do they just want to sit on it and act foolish?

Yep, that's where it needs to go. Preferably it will have Zorro-like
auto-config support, not Windozzze Plug&PRAY ;)

Brian, I just don't sleep, and since I lent out my AD516 card -- I have
plenty of time to read technical journals & docs at the same time I'm
playing bass in a little band while raising 5 children, and filling in for
Buckaroo Banzai when they need a brain-surgeon  ;-D

Not to disparage the AD516 design, it wasn't meant for this, but to actually
get higher-bit performance a break-out box for the inputs and outputs would
probably be neccessary and way more expensive ADCs and DACs and digital i/o
etc. And Thirty-Something-bit is not a realistic audio resolution. 18, 20,
24 are. Just ask anyone who owns a Mac ;] Actually I am serious here though.
If you have 2 AD516s the best use is to run them for the extra ins and outs,
and if in two computers, wider bandwidth to harddrives and bus, and more
flexibility.

Just philosophically, on the platforms that sell big, PCI is a standard.
Should be able to support a PCI card from any platform, provided that a
driver is designed for it and the Amiga. Then, any software that supports a
system-wide driver standard can address any PCI card. This is pretty old
news everywhere else. But the Dead Commodore never got it.

Definitely. But any developer needs some key things to keep his overhead
low. Then think of the _Amiga_ like a specialty Bread Shop. We are not
competing with the MegaBakery that is putting that foul-tasting white bread
in every supermarket in the country. But we /are/ buying some of our
ingredients from the same supplier. {"That's why -- PCI! That's why --
PCI!"}

As long as it gives light and warmth, some of us probably will not
permanently migrate. Why does it have to be one or the other?

What would it cost them to sell the information?  Time is money... and
lawyers are notorious for billing every second.

Besides, anyone with the resources required to buy the information
and bring a product to market would surely have the resources to find
out who owns the technology.

>And what about the 516 specs?
>It's still a great card and it would still sell too. No R&D,

Have you looked at an AD516 lately?  Count the chips... now count
the holes.  See that little green wire that goes from the zorro connector
to that little chip in the socket there... all those things are costly.
Not only must the boards be built, but then they have to be tested
(burn-in) for awhile.  The boards that don't work have to go through
troubleshooting, costing even more.

>just sell the current card design. If AHI happens, then it definitly
>would sell again.

How many units?  100, 1000, 10000?  At what price?  Would you
pay $1000 for it?  An AWE-64 Gold sells for about $200 nowadays,
and that's with four megabytes of RAM and a digital out.

What kind of distribution would the product be sold through?  Go
direct?  Now you have to handle tech support and training...

I don't think anyone with those types of financial resources is going
to be happy with dwindling, fragmented market that "Amiga" has to
offer... They're going to be fishing in a larger pond....

Nah, If Microsoft was a star, it would be a large blue-white in its early
20s.

Funny....the good people at AntiGravity tried for over a year
to find out who owned the technology and finally gave up!

I was thinking of making a CMX <-> Cuelist converter myself using QMaster
since I haven't got any respons on my requests (on list and private), but I
need some information on what exactly is expected of the converting -

CMX to Cuelist:

- What timecodes should be converted and why ? Should the recin/out be set
up with an empty Entry ?

- How should the dissolves be used - should they be converted to fade-ins on
the actual entry ?

- Reels - should there be made a database for reel numbers so thew script
can find the reel number and insert the filename (sample) in the cuelist
when it finds it ?

Cuelist to CMX:

- Should entry start/end simply be converted to rec-in/out ?

- Should it do as with cmx-cuelist, looking in a database and exchange
filename with a reel name ?

To be honest, I have no clue what use this will have so please elaborate on
this those who can and I will try to make it.

I was thinking of making a CMX <-> Cuelist converter myself using QMaster
since I haven't got any respons on my requests (on list and private), but I
need some information on what exactly is expected of the converting -

CMX to Cuelist:

- What timecodes should be converted and why ? Should the recin/out be set
up with an empty Entry ?

- How should the dissolves be used - should they be converted to fade-ins on
the actual entry ?

- Reels - should there be made a database for reel numbers so thew script
can find the reel number and insert the filename (sample) in the cuelist
when it finds it ?

Cuelist to CMX:

- Should entry start/end simply be converted to rec-in/out ?

- Should it do as with cmx-cuelist, looking in a database and exchange
filename with a reel name ?

To be honest, I have no clue what use this will have so please elaborate on
this those who can and I will try to make it.

Were they interested in buying the technology?  If I remember
correctly [it's been a long time] Anti-Gravity was some kind of
Value Added Reseller...  Seems pretty unusual for a VAR to
jump into the hardware business.

Maybe this is one of those quests -- where when you finally
find the answer to your question, you realize that the question
is irrelevant and the answer has no meaning.

If I recall correctly, the technology was offered to appropriate
major players at the time, but there was no interest in products
for a platform that those vendors were quickly abandoning.

Another question is:  What is the technology worth?  I worked
on a software only product that was sold for a little more than
a million dollars...  and that was for a non-exclusive deal!  Is
a hardware and software product that has a target market of
audio / video professionals worth a few million?  Are there
any Amiga hardware companies out there that can afford that?

They wanted to buy the technology to produce the boards..
why else would they spend a year trying to find out?
Perhaps, you think they were on a personal quest to just
see if they could find out for the hell of it?

They never were able to find out! They found nothing but dead ends. 
Kinda like the double talk you are posting here.

Millions of dollars...funny. It would be better to sell the stuff for
$5000.00 and be rid of it, rather than to sit on it and do 
nothing with it, until it is so old it's useless. Especially, hardware
for what you consider to be a dead platform.  Yep sitting on
hardware and software that is dated anyway, now thats a
*brilliant idea*. Perhaps in a few more years they might, just
might be able to donate it to a museum or somthing.

Lee

I've been a bit pressed for time but did see your brief query several days
ago.. sorry for my lack of response.

I too have some questions as to the usefulness of a CMX<->Cuelist converter,
and what exactly it should do.

k> - What timecodes should be converted and why ? Should the recin/out be set
k> up with an empty Entry ?

I would guess that in the case of CMX -> Cuelist, the important information is
record in/out which would be setup with "dummy" entries on the timeline at the
appropriate places, so that the real sample data could be plopped in.

Or, as you suggest, some type of reel->sample table which associate groups of
samples with a given reel number, so that the CMX -> Cuelist tool could create
a complete Cuelist with samples at the correct source timecodes and at the
correct Cuelist timecodes.

My main question is how people would use this tool.  Would you digitize all of
the material off your source tapes ahead of time, and then try to conform your
samples against the EDL?

k> - How should the dissolves be used - should they be converted to fade-ins
k> on the actual entry ?

The obvious way is to just have it put crossfades between clips where
applicable.

However, a perhaps more flexible method is to 'checkerboard' the audio so that
one event appears on one track, the next event appears on the track under it,
the next event back on the original track, etc., still with the appropriate
fade ins/outs on the sample.  It makes it easier to "pull tails" onto a sample
if it's not crowded by other sampls on either side.  IE:

Track 1 ->  XXXXXXXXXxxx..                     ..xxxXXXXXXXXxx.   XXXX
Track 2 ->             ..xxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxx..        XXXXX    XXXX

Then if I want to make the crossfade of the first clip on Track 2 longer, I
just pull the head of it further underneath track 1, and walla.  If they were
already cross-faded together on the same track, you'd have to go through a few
extra hoops to extend the dissolve.

k> - Reels - should there be made a database for reel numbers so thew script
k> can find the reel number and insert the filename (sample) in the cuelist
k> when it finds it ?

That was always my ultimate question.  How to associate samples with reel
numbers and timecodes!

On a somewhat related note, it would be interesting if the tool could
batch-digitize the audio files from an EDL and assemble the cuelist.  I have
machine control documentation and would find it fun to write such a beast, but
don't know how quickly I could get it accomplished (and the standard Sony
protocol is based on RS-422, not RS-232, so you have to build an RS422 to 232
converter box to even do it.)


As for Cuelist -> CMX, I do not see what practical use such a tool would have
but I'm sure someome out there has some reasons.

Ok. I have already made a frame script for this. I send you some stuff in
email. :-)  I would appreciate it if you would have the time to look into
it. The script that I have included can convert a CMX to a simple Cuelist
file. I take the rest in private email.

Hi Kenney,

This wouldn't by any chance be the same Doug Shannon who was customer
service rep for Sunrize Industries by any chance would it?

On this theme, I'd like to clarify (this may interest at least
"that" part of the audience) that an AHI driver for the AD516
would NOT allow to use ProStation or AudioLab16 with the Sunrize
hardware.


Hi Maurizio,

That was my biggest fear, that people were interested in the development of
a AHI driver was being urged, when programing along other lines that would
ultimately result in tools that would ultimately extend the usefulness of
Studio 16 are being oveerlooke
. 


The driver that you require is what I would most like to see developed.
Could you explain how with this driver AudioLab's funtionality would
improve its funtionality with Studio 16?

I especially like the comb filter & the hum 7 noise filters you have
included in the program. I don't like the fact that there is no Arexx port
and that many of the windows cannot be resized or removed from the screen
when not needed.

I am extremely resistant to buying an Amiga program without an Areex port.
I have tried the demo AudioLabJr and like the work that you have done. When
is the projected completion date of version 3. 

I've never heard of your program Prostudio, any info available?

!Just finished teaching another 16mm filmmaking workshop at my studio,
using Studio 16 to do the sound editing & mixing of course. It's always
fascinating to see how students who are normally Mac & PC users love
working on Studio 16 on the Amiga.

This group didn't manage to  finish their fine cut on my 16mm editing
machine. When I told them they could finish their fine cut on my non linear
editing system (VLabMotion with MovieShop software) they were eager to see
how this would work.

Naturally I bring Movieshop's timeline up on Studio16's public screen, so
that the 2 programs operate seamless fashion as though they were a single
program. 

Once the picture & audio track were fine cut on MovieShop's timeline.
Movieshop's timeline provides an excellent interface for editing all your
picture & sound in sync and is great for compositing a great many video
layers.

However Movieshop has no provision for the editing process known as
dialogue dialogue cutting. Studio16's timeline is a wonderful tool to do
dialogue cutting. 

In this workshop, I was only able to scratch the surface of what could be
done with dialogue editing with Studio16, but they got feeling for powerful
Studio16 is for cleaning up the dialogue & lots of hands on experience
using Studio16.

After they split their dialogue tracks & made the improvements that time
would allow, I showed them how to do a spotting session with Studio16. They
then preceded to build their sound effect & tracks.

We ended up having built 9 tracks on this basic training, which of course
is nothing on a system that allows you to build 99 synchronous tracks. 

When they learned that Studio16 & MovieShop were running on a 25MHZ 68030
in my A3000 they were astounded as experienced no problems and were eager
to know if I would rent them time on the Amiga to edit & sound mix their
films. 

The SMPTE time code I used was generated by SMPTEOut 29.97 so I have to
careful not to be using this with audio houses that are using 30 frame time
code such as Pinewood Sound in Vancouver or there will be a drifting sync.

There is 30 frame 29.97 and 30 drop frame. If compatible equipment is
patched together there should be no problem. 

The timecode synchronizer built in to the Sunrize cards is sufficiently
powerful that it will lock to either 29.97 or 30 fr. time code if the
Studio16 is used as the Slave in the Master/Slave relationship. 

Other hardware and software may not as capable. Timecode coming from
another source than SMPTEOut would probably benefit by being put through a
device such as the Fostex 4010 which has jam sync & will provide a stable
source when there are dropouts in the
timecode.

I've used SMPTEOut with the AD1012 & AD516 my Fostex Model 80 & Model 20 my
Foxtex 4030 sychronizers Movieshop software on VLabMotion Tocatta system
and a variety of video decks. Perfect lock on all these sources. SMPTEOut
saved me from buying a Fostex 4010.

Best of luck tracking tracking down the problem, but I suspect problem lies
elsewhere than SMPTEOut. I would suspect Bars&Pipes is using true 30 frame
timecode and not the video 30 frame (29.97) rate. Then you most definitely
would experience a drift.

I was in engineering, not accounting... what makes you think I have sales
numbers?

Ben.


Hi Ben,

I would like to thank you for the wonderfull software that you, Todd &
Anthony developed for us. The AD516 hardware & it's excellent Studio 16
software have made the Amiga computer the best hardware purchase that I
have ever made.  

I have always considered it to be THE KILLER APP on the Amiga. I paid full
list price for the AD1012 & recieved a very generous traid in on the AD516
from Sunrize. I found the customer service excellent. Possibly due to the
excellent quality of the produc
, I never had any difficulty getting through on the phone for help. 

Both Tony Shannon & Dean Tucker were extremely pleasent pleasent & helpfull
on the few occasions when I had problems with the AD1012 board (a faulty
gain control chip, always replaced & shipped quickly and free of charge.

I was dissapointed when Tony closed the company and vanished, as I would
have liked to have expressed my gratitude for this wonderfull system he
made it possible for us to have. 

He certainly had every right to close the business if it was no longer
profitable for him or his interest lay elsewhere.  Many of us would have
liked to wish bim the best of luck with his future endevours.  

All of us would have liked to see him reap future rewards by selling the
rights to another developer. I'm sure everyone would be glad to see Anthony
return to produce  another killer app for the Amiga should he feel so
inclined, if Gateway make the Amiga 
 healthy market for developers. Enen a negative statement from Anthony
would be welcome.

If Jamie is still on the list. Thanks ever so much for the excellent manual
that you and Susan Bruner put together for us. Wonderfull hardware &
software is even more usefull when supplemented by a lavish manual with
exhaustive attention to detail.  

Although Studio 16 is very intuitive & one could very easily never refer to
the manual, I have spent a great many pleasurable hours reading the manual,
gleaning every last ounce of wisdom from the information enclosed.  

It is wonderful to have a manual which is actually fun to read. My manual
has been read & reread so many times that the binding completely fell
apart. I had a metal spiral binding put on by Kinkos which has extended its
usefullness for years to come. 

Every os often in my spare time I brouse through the manual to see if there
isn't something that I've overlooked or forgotten. If only all Amiga
companies would but such effort into producing such a readable manual we
would all be saved a lot of greif. We
l done Jamie.

I don't know why a company would want to sit on technology for a "dead" computer platform either..... But I guess who ever owns the technology, has the right to if they want!!!  I don't think we should be getting angry with Ben.... And really people..... Ben was an engineer, I don't think he's the one that owns the technology! If he did, I'm sure he would just give the technology away to one of us, since he feels the Amiga isn't viable anyway.....

Here, here.....ditto to everything Dave said in his post.



Guess I would have liked a formal goodbye from the chief.  
Obviously there are things that we will never know.  

I am serious though when I say that, I hope everyone who worked 
at Sunrize really understands the level of dedication and 
appreciation that exists in the Studio16 user base, for Sunrize
and the products they created.

Kenny you asked whether or not the Doug I mentioned was Doug 
Shannon.

That does sound right.

As I mentioned in my earlier post,  he handled the beta test group.
I still have many of my reports addressed to him that contained bugs
as well as ideas for ways to enhance S16.  Doug was very receptive
to new ideas.

>find out who owns the technology.

I guess I'm just very suprised that they are apparantly so negitive
on the subject that it would take such an effort to initiate a
contact to discuss any possibilty. I know your not permitted to say
or simply want to stay out of the mess, but I would like to ask one
clue.... is there still a company that holds the goods or an individual
who holds the patents. I'll understand if don't want to answer. 

>costly. Not only must the boards be built, but then they have to be

This part is irrelevant. It is neccesarry for any peice of hardware made
on earth. Sure it cost to build, test and repair. But still the R&D is
already
done and collecting dust. I can tell you honestly that given simply the
scematics and firmware code to burn, that I could likely manage the rest.

AWE-64 does not compare. I have tested one myself and ask an received
opinions from other professionals who say it sound quality is not up to
it.
I personally went with a turtle beach card that does the job very well.
But even TB cards are running in the 400+ range. Also the cost of your
components have droped dramaticly since 1993. DSP's and ram chips
can be had for fracations of what they cost 4 years ago. With out specs
and a chance to study the facts, a true estimate will never be had.
And at fisrt guess, I'd say you be at 200-400 peices in the first year if
the price could be kept in the neighborhood of a PRO, not AWE pc card.
The rest would depend on the unknown ami clones, new business and the old
faves like newtek that are back. A toaster or flier profession can always
use a pro sound card.

>What kind of distribution would the product be sold through?  Go
>direct?  Now you have to handle tech support and training...

Magazine and Local stores are doing pretty well for now. I personally
receive mail asking where to get 516's. And the tech part I've
done for the past 14 years. Including hiring, teaching and training.
If I had all the info in front of me to study, I may well agree with you.
But please don't underestimate our abiliites to get a doable project
done.

>I don't think anyone with those types of financial resources is going

That is not true. Ami was dead, and still fragmented, but recent
events have amiga growing, not dwindling. The future is unknown.
Not a definite grave for amiga. How well will it's market be? Much better
as long as determined interested people continue to put time money
and effort in to it. You can see it happening at the shows, internet and
ami
mags. Markets in other contries are already growing again too.
You may not have time to keep up on all the ami news out side of this
group, but it might suprise you. It has me. Even I was ready to walk
away.
But with gateway powering Ami Inc now, the game has changed.  

>Nah, If Microsoft was a star, it would be a large blue-white in its

Well I guess that's that. If your convinced MS deserves to run every
pc on the planet, then there is no reason to go on. But the fact you're
here says that's not true. Then why offer help to ami, but at the same
time try to warn us off to MS? Interesting mix.

I don't think any one has gotten angry with Ben. Not that I've seen

Agreed, after reading hundreds of tech manuals over ther years,
this one was one of the best books to accompany any such powerful
harware/software combo. It made diving in and making projects a
one afternoon glide. One more reason  Studio16 was an all around
master peice.

Hi, Dave and Maurizio!

Dave Hardy's words on 26-Jan-98 in reply to Maurizio:
>>On this theme, I'd like to clarify (this may interest at least "that" part
>>of the audience) that an AHI driver for the AD516 would NOT allow to use
>>ProStation or AudioLab16 with the Sunrize hardware.

>That was my biggest fear, that people were interested in the development of
>a AHI driver was being urged, when programing along other lines that would
>ultimately result in tools that would ultimately extend the usefulness of
>Studio 16 are being oveerlooked. 

I see where a company might favor a proprietary driver, ie for performance
reasons. But it would be better for the Amiga if any problems (if they
exist) in the AHI driver spec, were solved, than to have two competing
standards. A company can only benefit in the short term with exclusivity.

In the Mac world several years ago, two different companies introduced midi
extensions. One was very open to sharing, more in a public-domain spirit,
with other developers. The other had a decided proprietary slant. Much time
and dust later, nothing but grief was caused, and few people were still
capable of debate on which was better. Some of this was, of course,
political.

>I especially like the comb filter & the hum 7 noise filters you have
>included in the program.

Yeah, the most envied plug-ins from other platforms for me have always been
noise reducing. (These were also the earliest introduced.)

>and that many of the windows cannot be resized or removed from the screen
>when not needed.

Ouch. Got to use the standard OS stuff everywhere, whenever possible! And
/that/  allows all the correctly-coded patches clever people are always
coming up with to work with the software.

Right now it is stuff on Aminet that keeps the OS from being Pleistonic, in
terms of appearance and features. Whenever a developer goes proprietary,
that is the stuff that "breaks" when using things like Cybergraphics,
VisualPrefs, multi-commodities, etc.

In beta-testing for different houses, I have noticed that some houses have
a real "keep-em-down-on-the-farm" approach, in the mistaken belief that it
will make things easier for Tech Support later on. But taking programming
shortcuts usually leads to dissatisfied customers and a harried tech-support
staff. People try to use this "non-official" stuff anyway. Some of it is
great work, after all!

Occasionally we all probably have heard, "We need to take the System's
<fill-in-the-blank> over; it is the ONLY way it can be done." Then later
someone does it the right way. Early Amiga MIDI programming had many
examples of this, especially from developers on non-multitasking systems.
For a long time they didn't understand, or didn't want to, so they made
accusations that the Amiga was flawed (and they weren't just talking about
serial port issues)!

>I am extremely resistant to buying an Amiga program without an Areex port.
>I have tried the demo AudioLabJr and like the work that you have done. When
>is the projected completion date of version 3. 

I hope ProStation will not be crippled. Integral full-functioning Arexx from
the very first release is a neccessity. This also makes dollars-and-sense:
the more useful ARexx scripts show up, the more "supported" the product
looks, and the more free publicity it gets.


Of cource sincerely,

I was referring to Lee's remarks!!  It just sounded a little angry to me!  Being angry never gets results. Esp. when dealing with someone who could help us, like Ben!!

Lee's Reply to Ben!!

They wanted to buy the technology to produce the boards..
why else would they spend a year trying to find out?
Perhaps, you think they were on a personal quest to just
see if they could find out for the hell of it?

They never were able to find out! They found nothing but dead ends. 
Kinda like the double talk you are posting here.

Millions of dollars...funny. It would be better to sell the stuff for
$5000.00 and be rid of it, rather than to sit on it and do 
nothing with it, until it is so old it's useless. Especially, hardware
for what you consider to be a dead platform.  Yep sitting on
hardware and software that is dated anyway, now thats a
*brilliant idea*. Perhaps in a few more years they might, just
might be able to donate it to a museum or somthing.

regards,

Lee

Kenny, is there is plans for tools with GUI's. Not that I'm complaining, but so far, all the tools seem to be CLI based utilities, which make them not very user friendly.

Hate to get all gushy. But pretty much all the stuff on Studio16, at the
time of its release, made it "one of the Good Ones". A great interface for
AV work! Thanks to all former Sunrizers on the list, who I am hoping we can
augment with some of the rest of the team.

The implications of independent drivers also of course include system-wide

I guess this could go back and forth forever. But the whenever someone has
said it can't (or shouldn't) be done eventually someone comes along and
proves differently.

I agree. The SunRize development team did some excellent work and
it was a real thrill to see the last rev of Studio 16 take shape. I still use
my AD516 for video soundtrack work.

Ben, it's nice to see you on this list. I think I first met you at an
Amiga convention where you were selling Project D (which I eventually
purchased). I've enjoyed your contributions to Final Writer (and wish you 
had stayed there long enough to finish anchored graphics, they were 
lost on that without you  :^). 

Your contributions to Studio 16 are much appreciated. I hope you are 
doing well with your current pursuits.

Thanks Dave. Susan was great to work with. I had a lot of fun 
during that project bantering feature ideas back and forth with 
Todd and Anthony, and some good refinements came out of that.

The current fruits of my manual laboring are available with World
Construction Set (www.QuestarProductions.com). We just released
WCS 3 for Intel/DEC Alpha. A PowerMac version is on the way.
We're also working on WCS 3 for Amiga and eventually for Unix.

Best Regards,
 -Jamie

Hi, Jamie! Now its beginning to dawn on me all the different places I've
seen your byline.

Jamie Krutz's words on 27-Jan-98:
>Ben, it's nice to see you on this list. I think I first met you at an
>Amiga convention where you were selling Project D (which I eventually
>purchased). I've enjoyed your contributions to Final Writer (and wish you 
>had stayed there long enough to finish anchored graphics, they were 
>lost on that without you  :^). 

Sometimes I wish programmers had better ways to pass on the torch. It seems
like there are often times when Amiga developers lose ground when
programmers leave. Someone new there may want to contribute, but they need
information or insight from the original programmer(s). [Is this thinly
veiled statement indeed transparent?]  8D<=<

>Your contributions to Studio 16 are much appreciated. I hope you are 
>doing well with your current pursuits.

>We're also working on WCS 3 for Amiga and eventually for Unix.

Now _there_ is a World-class Herculean project!

Hi Gord,

Yes, I have plans for an all-in-one tool that will do the stuff the cli
tools do from GUI. However, I work on a project right now that will
have high pri for a while and next project on the list will be a Cuelist
render program. The cli tools are merly demo tools to show that things
work using the includes. I was also hoping to see people make use of the
includes and create tools.


regards,

- Kenny

Thanks a million for the crop regions tool Kenny. I haven't had the chance
to try it yet but I'll let you know my impressions soon. Sorry a typing
error in my message to Ben & Jammie.

I typed Tony when I meant to type Anthony. Anthony Wood owns Sunrize
Industries. Why he is in hiding I've no idea, but in the absence of any
solid information some pretty wild scenarios come to mind.

Before we start the rumor mill grinding, a couple of basic checks might be
done. Has anyone looked in the Campbell California telephone directory to
see if there is a listing for an Anthony J. Wood?

How about Tim Jenson at Newtek? It's well known that Anthony was trying to
sell Tim on using the studio 16 as the Flyer audio board.  Possibly Tim
might have this info.


About a month & half before the vanishing act Anthony Wood posted a notice
in Comp.Sys.Amiga.Marketplace listing for sale of several Amiga systems,
including Video Toaster boards & AmiLink systems.

I checked the phone number against my Sunrize info & sure enough it was the
same number. Too bad it wasn't his home number. Great hardware, great
software and great manuals. 

To me, Studio16 has a future even if the Amiga doesn't. To me, the
important thing is how useful is the equipment, not is it the latest model.

I don't know Anthony personally, but I would not like to see him hounded to
death by people wanting to get their hands on his technology. However a
nice anonymous posting of the code necessary for Maurizio to get a driver
for his AudioLab software would b
 nice.

I'm going to get back to you shortly with what use I can envision the CMX
converter being put to.  No use you spending a lot of time on it unless it
can be put to a practical purpose.

I checked on bigfoot.com, and came up with an Anthony Wood in Cambell California. 

The Address is:   root@iband.com


Could this be him?

Ben Fuller's words on 27-Jan-98:
>So what kinds of things would be expected of an AHI driver for Studio16?

    "Dammit Ben, I'm just a former dealer, not a software engineer!"
        {Thanks, Brian -- I think}.

But it seems to me it must be capable of providing every resource the
Studio16 software used, in both directions. If there were still more tricks
in the bag for the next release, that used calls that hadn't yet been
used in 3.01, I would say make those available too.

I don't know if other AHI drivers have embedded arexx calls (but I'm
guessing not, the sound software should be where arexx comes in, right?).
The AHI site --

    http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lcs/ahi.html

should be a place to start.


If I were to be wild and abandoned -- I would yell from every rooftop --
"PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS! ANYTHING THAT DSP -- ANYTHING THAT CARD CAN DO THAT
IS IN THE REALM OF AUDIO: WELL MAKE SURE THE DRIVER GIVES ACCESS TO IT!"

But I need to conserve my lungs, and spare the "golden ears" this group
possesses, so I guess a good start would be to examine what other software
is doing with Amiga audiocards these days at Pauli Porkka's site:

    http://www.iki.fi/pporkka/main.html

This site is regularly updated and has good links to other sound card
people. And I believe I will think a little more about this and reexamine
what other platforms are doing in the realm professional.


Sincerely,

--

That would be great, but I think we could be happy with
an AHI that would at least let third party software send and receive
samples through the 516. Minimum would be to let the apps only send
samples through 516. Recording could still be done through S16, but
sample
editors would need to be able to make edits then play to the AHI support.
And games would only have to send the sound (including stereo sound) to
the 516 through AHI. More integrated AHI to the S16 features might not
be possible with out a major programming effort by folks like Ben and
the others who knew S16 inside and out. Can't see that happening in
the near future though.

Many thanks for the info Dave! It's an interresting start point.

I share the same view.

Play capabillity in minimum stereo. That's all there need to be in there as
a basic driver. It would be nice with variable freq./pan/volume. I don't
think recording should have high pri, but it would be nice to have this
feature as well.

The driver would probably need to handle memory-to-card as AHI works this
way (IIRC). Probably a caveeat on the last part ?

Thanks for asking Ben!

>>So what kinds of things would be expected of an AHI driver for Studio16?

My guess is that the most useful AHI interface (without going overboard)
would have all the same input hooks as the Recorder module and output hooks
for playing and controlling volume levels. Stereo access would be a big plus.

A good start would be access to just the play and output level controls.

I really appreciate your willingness to carry on a dialogue about this.

Thanks again!
