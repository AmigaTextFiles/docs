@NODE Introduction
@TITLE Introduction

   Well, I'm writing this guide due to some inspiration from a good friend
of mine, John Forrest.  He is the SYSOP of @{"BrainScan BBS" link BBS}.
Because I am connected to the Internet, and I use BBS's ( I'm CO-SYSOP of
BrainScan BBS ) I kept using abreviations, which IRC people would recognise
from me, but BBS people wouldn't, so, the primary reason for this guide is
to tell people what abreviations I use stand for.  But, seeing as I'm
actually doing this at the same time as editing my @{"Web pages" link
Contact}
I 'spose I'll put some effort into it.  Well, take a look around.  You may
be surprised!

@NODE AboutMe
@TITLE "About Bradley Smith"


Well, My name is Bradley David Smith.  I'm 15 years old, and my Birthday is
on the 21st June.  I live in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England.
I'm an outgoing, friendly person, and I enjoy social activities - yes, in
other words, going out with my m8's.  I goto Monk's Walk School, and, have
been Captain of the Cricket Team.  Cricket is my favourite sport ya see. :)
Hm.... Well, I enjoy reading, and watching TV.  I love Star Trek and the
X-Files, and Game On, along with anything else funny on TV. (Red Dwarf
etc.)  I'm really into computers.  I use an AMIGA 1200 ( see my system spec
@{"here" link Computer} ;) ).  I love the 'net.
  My favourite part of the 'net HAS to be IRC :). 
I use the nick of ^Bradman^, and I use EFnet, Undernet DALnet :).
