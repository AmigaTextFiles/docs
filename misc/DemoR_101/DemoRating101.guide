@node intro "Introduction"

 Introduction
 ------------

Ever since the 80's the Amiga has had a huge cult of followers in the demo
section. And this following has kept growing. With the coming of AGA, a new
breed of demos arrived on the scene: Gone were the pretty starfields, the
record-breaking polygon vectors, the sinusoidal text, and of course, the many
bobs. In came realtime fractals, texturemapping, powerful raytracing and
24-bit pictures. I myself fell in love with the Amiga when I saw my first demo,
Phenomena's Enigma demo. Since then I have gathered a large collection of
demos, and each year become more impressed with what these genius coders can do
with this fantastic machine.

This DemoRating archive contains lists of Amiga demos rated by the Amiga User.
This list in no way is the be-all-and-end-all of lists. It is merely a general
rating of demos. It is meant to be a guide for people to be able to see what
may be good demos to download, and also to see what the demo ratings at the
various demo parties are like. Feel free to contact me about these listings.

If you do have any of the demos listed, or not listed <especially if they are
only rated once> we would be especially interested in your ratings.

Note: These listings are originally rated by @{" Kenji Irie " link author}, and are NOT 
official results of any kind.

@node why "Why?"

 Why create a DemoRating list?
 -----------------------------

For years now I have been watching demos. And recently, there have been a lot
of demos on the Amiga scene. And Brilliant ones too. But I needed a system so
that I could quickly and easily pick out the best demos to watch. It is also
sometimes annoying to download big demo archives of a meg or two and only find
that it contains a mod and a large animation. Hopefully this demo list I have
compiled can help you in picking good demos out. It may not, but the list can
only become bigger and better if you can send me in your ratings on any, or all
demos. See @{" Rating Demos " link ratingdemos} for information on how to rate and send your
lists to me.

@endnode

@node requirements "Yes! Demo requirements for these lists *8)"

 Demo Requirements
 -----------------

There are three issues about the demos on these lists:

1) What GFX chips do I need for these demos?
2) What processor do I need for these demos?
3) How much RAM do I need?

The Answer to these is simple:

Bare minimum: A1200
recommended minimum: A1200 + 4 Megs Fastram
recommended machine: A1200 50MHz/030 & upwards, and 4 Megs ram

9 out of 10 demos that are released these days require AGA. Unfortunate, but
true, many demos make extensive use of AGA in their pictures, tmapping and
speed. There are some demos released as ECS, and also some released for
Graphics cards. The ratings I give for demos are from my machine, an 50Mhz/030
+ fastram. Like myself, many people have these machines, and with the price of
50MHz acclerator cards dropping for the A1200, I cant stress how much standard
A1200 users should upgrade to an 030. ECS users: get hold of an A1200 or an
A4000.

 It may pay to note also, that most demos are HD installable.

If there are enough people that request ECS demos to be rated and specified as
ECS compatible, I will certainly include another column in the demo lists. At
the moment though, I dont believe that any serious demo fan would not want an
AGA machine for demos.

@endnode

@node avail "Demo Availability"

 Demo Availability
 -----------------

Most of the demos rated in the lists will be available from any Aminet site
under the aminet/demo/ directory. Some demos do not make it onto the Aminet
though, but can be found on other FTP sites. The site i41s20.ira.uka.de 
supports most new demos. Be wary of virii though, as demos have had a tendency
in the past to be infected with virii. The Aminet is pretty safe though, as new
files are virus checked. If you know of any other good demo sites, email me and
I will list them here.

The TOP TEN demo list contains extended information on the top 10 demos and
also includes ant FTP site & path for the file.

New Zealand users can download most demos from Phoenix Amiga BBS, Christchurch.
See @{" Author " link Author}

@node lists "The demo lists"

 The demo lists
 --------------

There are 5 different listings for demos:

1) The Top Ten demos
This list contains extended information on the top 10 demos, as rated in the
demo lists. File size & archive names are also given here.

2) Demos
This is a listing of all Demos & Intros. ie: demos bigger than 64K. The list is
formatted so that the demos with the highest overall score are at the top <10>
and the demos with the lowest score are at the bottom <1>.

3) 64K&40K
Like the Demos list, this is a listing of 64K/40K demos by score.

4) 4K
And again, a listing of 4K demos by score.

5) Complete
This is a listing of ALL rated demos, by party dates. The newest demos are at
the top, and the older demos at the bottom. Demo partys in the same year listed
alphabetically <eg: Assembly95, Gathering95, Symposium 95...>. The party lists
may not be complete, but should give you a good understnding of how demo partys
fare against one another <with respect to demo "quality".>

All demos are listed by the @{" Rating Demos " link ratingdemos} format.
@endnode


@node Ratingdemos "Rating your demos"

 Rating your Demos
 -----------------

This list is a continually updated list, and the ratings can only become more
accurate and general to what people think if you send me your demo rating
lists. To do this, simply edit the text file which looks like @{"this" link this} and
send it to me. Thats all there is to it. Below are some notes on rating your
demos:

All ratings should be marked out of 10, from 1 to 10 in steps of 0.5 (*) .
Eg: Whole numbers, or *.5 .Think about the marks as 5 being average. For
example, if you watch a demo and it doesnt really thrill you, yet has
reasonable graphics and sounds, give it a rating of 5. If it has old effects
done well, and also has some new effects that impress you, and has been
reasonably well put together, a 7 or 8 would suffice. As expected, a mark of 
10 should only be given to the most impressive demo you have seen. Demos change
over time, so a demo today that scores 10 may score less than 10 tomorrow. Use
your own judgement, and send me your results, and I will be include it in the
next update of the Demo Rating list.

GFX: Represents the rating given the demo's graphics. This section
     includes anything of graphical nature.

Sound: Represents the rating given to the demos sound and music quailties.

Total: Represents the total rating given to the demo. This number may not be
       the average of the GFX & Sound ratings, and usually isnt. Impact,
       originality & overall quality should be included in this section.

As many demos released make extensive use of texture-mapping <for better or for
worse>, a fast processor is recommended. If you have an 020, I ask that you
take into account the speed of your processor when rating demos. If you watch a
demo and it almost crawls to a halt, try and imagine it on a fast computer. If
you think it would look good, and is innovative, give it credit for it.

Send your lists to:

iriek@elec.canterbury.ac.nz or
k.irie@student.canterbury.ac.nz

Happy demo watching!


(*) A half value has been chosen simply because I feel 10 steps isnt quite
enough to distinguish between demos. Anythign more than 20 (10x2) would be
pointless as the variation in rating the demos would probably be +/- 0.5 .

@endnode

@node this "The rating form"

The demos should be sent to me in the following format:

@node Top10 "The TOP 10 rated Demos"

                          ***  Top 10 Demo List  ***

Top 10 demo list: Below are listed the top 10 demos as rated in the demos
section of the rating guide. Each has a description and extra information on
it. For any other reviews or info, email me at the address at the bottom of the
page. These demos are heavily recommended!

@{b}Demo #1 : The Gate by Artwork. Winner, Symposium 96. @{ub}
          Availability: ftp://i41s20.ira.uka.de/pub/
          Size: 2.85 Megs (.lzx)
          Requires: AGA Amiga with 2 Megs (4?) fastram
        
        Similar in its impact to TINT, this demo is professionally put to
gether and leads the way for following demos. Contains some brilliant new
effects, and a great soundtrack. Very fast in its 3d object manipulation.
Definitely a must-see. 50MHz 030 recommended, but not needed.

@{b}Demo #2 : TINT by The Black Lotus. Winner, The Gathering 96.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/tg96/TBL-Tint.lha
          Size: 4.76 Meg (.lzx)
          Requires: AGA Amiga with 4 Megs Fastram

        This demo has set the standard for forthcoming demo releases.
Professionally presented, this demo achieves near perfection in all parts, 
and flows exquisitly between sections. The demo is presented almost entirely in
2x2 pixel mode, but dont let this fool you - Bumpmapped lightsourced objects
look brilliant. The demo contains a lot of 3d object manipulation, and amazing
tunnel sequences, and has a brilliant thumping & atmospheric soundtrack to go
with it. Expectedly, 4 Megs of fastram is required, and an 030/50 or above would
be prefered. (note: 040 owners, you need the 040 patch off Aminet)

@{b}Demo #3 : Nexus7 by Andromeda. Winner, The Party 94. @{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/tp94/nexus7.lha
          Size: 782K (.lha)
          Requires: AGA Amiga

        This sort of demo is what the Amiga was made for - Brilliant smooth
graphics & impressive effects & sound to match. Amazing it all fits onto less
than a disk. Even though released in 94, its a demo any Amigan would be proud to
have. Excellent even on a standard 1200.

@{b}Demo #4 : Rabies by Rage. Released at The Party 95.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/tp95/Rabies*.lha (3 archives)
          Size: 1.8 Megs (.lzx)
          Requires: AGA Amiga

        An atmospheric, if gory beginning to this demo gives it a flying start.
Generally speaking, it contains effects that have been done before, but has
done them so well, and so smooth (even on a standard 1200). Colourful, flowing,
and well pesented.

@{b}Demo #5 : Storm by Impulse. Released in 96.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/AGA/Storm.lha
          Size: 2.5 Megs (.lha)         
          Requires: AGA Amiga with 4 Megs fastram

        Quite possibly the best of the non-TINT style demos. Some standard
effects done so well it hurts. Runs on an A1200 with 4 megs fast, but 030
recommended. Fantastic soundtrack.

@{b}Demo #6 : Vertigo by Abyss. Released at Saturne 96@{ub}
          Availibility: Aminet/demo/aga/Ays-vert.lha
          Size: 863K (.lzx)
          Requires: AGA Amigas with 4 Megs fastram

@{b}Demo #7 : C42 by Juliet & Case. Released at The Assembly 95.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/ta95/a95_j+c/lha
          Size: 468K (.lha)
          Requires: AGA Amigas

@{b}Demo #8: Dalahorse by SubAcid. Released at the South Sea 95.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/aga/rzr-dal*.lha (4 archives)
          Size: 2.8 Megs (.lha)
          Requires: ?

@{b}Demo #9: Ilyad by Alcatraz. Released at The Assem 94.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/TA94/Ilyad*.lha
          Size: 3.25 Megs
          Requires: AGA Amigas with 4 Megs fast

        This is the first of a new breed of demos - large, pretty, and well put
together. Impressive indeed.

@{b}Demo #10: ZiF by Parallax. Winner, The Assem 95.@{ub}
          Availability: Aminet/demo/TA95/a95_zif.lha
          Size: 1 Meg
          Requires: AGA Amiga.

        Powerful demo. Runs on a standard 1200, but 030 recommened.
