*** DoColorWindow() ******************************************************

NAME
    DoColorWindow  --  Allows the user to change a screen's colors


SYNOPSIS
    BOOL DoColorWindow(Screen, Left, Top, FirstPen, UseRGB);


FUNCTION
    This routine creates a window, called the ColorWindow, which has 
    gadgets that allow the user to change the colors of any screen.  
    After opening the ColorWindow, this routine interacts with the 
    user until the user is satisfied with the current colors, at which 
    time the window is closed and control is returned to you.  

    The ColorWindow will open in the specified Screen.  The Screen 
    argument can be equal to NULL; if it is, the ColorWindow will be 
    opened in the Workbench screen.  The ColorWindow automatically 
    adapts itself to any screen.  

    With the Top and Left arguments you specify the position of the 
    ColorWindow's top-left corner.  Note that no position-error 
    checking is done, so you must take care to not place the window 
    outside of the bounds of your screen.  Currently, the Left argument 
    can range from 0 to 88 on low-resolution screens, and 0 to 408 
    on high-resolution screens.  The Top argument can range from 
    0 to 109 on a 200-line screen, and 0 to 309 on an interlaced screen.  
    These figures don't include overscan, which most programmers 
    don't use.  The width and height of the ColorWindow are defined 
    by the constants COLORWINDOW_WIDTH and COLORWINDOW_HEIGHT in the 
    color.h file.  

    The FirstPen argument is used to initialize the color that's 
    displayed when the ColorWindow is first created.  

    The ColorWindow is capable of allowing the user to modify the 
    colors using either an RGB or an HSL technique.  The RGB technique 
    involves three proportional gadgets, one for each of Red, Green 
    and Blue.  By adjusting one of these gadgets, the user adjusts 
    the amount of the associated color component in the final color.  
    Some people feel that this is the most intuitive way to change 
    colors on the Amiga, as this is how colors are represented 
    internally by the Amiga.  The other technique, HSL, allows the 
    user to adjust the Hue, Saturation and Luminance of the final color.  
    Some people feel that *this* is the most intuitive way for users 
    to change color, because it's based on color theory and because 
    these are the types of controls that people used on their 
    color televisions in the old days.  

    You decide which mode is first used when the ColorWindow is created 
    by setting the UseRGB argument to TRUE or FALSE.  If TRUE, 
    the RGB technique will be used.  If FALSE, HSL is used.  

    But regardless of which technique you specify, the user can switch 
    to using the other technique by clicking on the RGB / HSL characters 
    that appear to the left of the proportional gadgets.  

    On return from this function, this routine returns TRUE if all 
    went well.  If anything went wrong (usually out of memory) and 
    the ColorWindow was never created, this routine returns FALSE.  

    NOTE:  This routine is not re-entrant.  What this means 
    is that if you have created a program that has more than one task,
    this routine cannot be called by more than one task at a time.
    This was done for the sake of memory efficiency.
    This restriction is not a problem for the grand majority of programs.
    But if you have some application that would require calling this 
    routine asynchronously from multiple tasks, you'll have to 
    implement some quick semaphore arrangement to avoid collisions.
    No big deal, actually.  See Exec semaphores for everything you need.


INPUTS
    Screen = address of the screen in which the ColorWindow will open.
        Can be NULL; if so, the ColorWindow will open in the Workbench

    Left = position of the left edge when the ColorWindow opens

    Top = position of the top edge when the ColorWindow opens

    FirstPen = pen number of the color displayed when the ColorWindow
        first opens

    UseRGB = TRUE if you want the RGB technique displayed first, 
        FALSE if you want the HSL technqiue.  See the discussion above


RESULT
    Returns TRUE if all went well.  If the window couldn't be opened for
    any reason, returns FALSE.
