Casey,

While we're not ruling out an Amiga version, it simply came out of the =
blue.  Poland, in fact.  We are dealing with the guy to see if in fact =
there might be something there.

Don't hold your breath, but don't give up either.

I'd like to respond to everyone on this one, but there are too many of =
you!  We might keep you all abreast on our page (myst.com) which is =
currently being updated.

More later.
