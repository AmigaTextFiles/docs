Dear Casey,

Unfortunately, someone has done a grand disservice to you Amiga users.  =
There is no version of Myst in the works or even planned for the Amiga =
platform.

This demo was only just that.

Sorry for Gary Islay's poor joke. We don't know him and have no contact =
with him whatsoever.

Please pass this on to your friends.

Regards,

Chris Brandkamp
