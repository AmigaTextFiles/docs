These letters are from Cyan (Myst) and talk about the 
possible (REAL) Amiga port of Myst... it might be
good news, however, don't hold your breath yet.  It
would also be good to send just one email to 
info@cyan.com about you supporting the Amiga version
of Myst to convince them faster (they are already
being flooded quite terribly ... heheh)

Order of letters:

letter-1
letter-to-them
letter-2
