But please note this also shows the possible market for such a game, and
since Gary Islay has easily ported a "Myst Demo" to Amiga (using the exact
same datafiles that came with other versions of Myst), why not contact him
and have him do it?  It seems prefectly possible, since it came out exactly
like it.  A friend of mine has an IBM and an Amiga - both versions looked 
exactly alike, same music, same graphics, same sounds, same animation, etc.
