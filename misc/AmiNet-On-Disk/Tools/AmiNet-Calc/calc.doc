AmiNet-calc V1.1 (23.3.94)

What:

Calculates size of an AmiNet-On-Disc-order.

Kind:

Public-Domain. You can do everything with it! BUT: THIS IS NOT
TRUE FOR included reqtools and rexxreqtools-libraries! ...

Why:

I am lazy and I don´t want to calculate the size of such an order by hand
using a calculator.

Requires:

Arexx and reqtools, rexxreqtools.library.
But you can also rewrite it to run without reqtools...
If you dont have this libs just copy them from the
drawer where this little proggy resides to your libs: directory.
You can also update your versions if you dont have already newer
versions. These are: reqtools 38.1210 and rexxreqtools 37.71 from
reqtools22a.lha which came through aminet.
  NOTE: The libs which are included here require OS 2.0!

Usage:

It´s simple.
Start a shell and type in "rx calc.rexx". Click about-requester away and
select desired aminet-list(s). Click Ok again. - Wait a moment.
  A requester pops up and displays:
- the size of the order in kbytes (Größe:)
- required DD-discs + 1 reserve
- required HD-discs + 1 reserve
  After clicking away this requester the proggy saves the file
Bestellinfo (means info about order), which contains the infos
mentioned above.

NOTE: This version of calc.rexx ONLY works with standard aminet-lists
      (Look into the source and you know why!) If they will ever change
      their file format dont expect that this little script will work
      correctly any longer...

History:

                       extra check for "-"-character

Suggestions etc. to...
