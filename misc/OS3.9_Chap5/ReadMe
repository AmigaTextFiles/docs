                UNOFFICIAL UPDATED OS3.9 HTML DOCS
                      Date:  9/7/2001

I decided one day that I wanted some better documentation for OS3.9.  
So I went ahead and started modifying Chapter 5. 

I may or may not continue with other chapters once Chapter 5 is 
completed to a good degree.  Only time and energy will tell...

To install:

WARNING: Becasue I have not finished the Chapter 5 docs,
some of the links in the "Glossary" or the "Index" HTML of the orginal
OS3.9 docs may not link to the new Chapter 5 docs.

If you want to still install the docs:
Copy the contents of the "AmigaOS 3.9 Manual/Workbench" drawer 
to where you store the HTML docs from the OS3.9 CD-ROM.
I've been keeping it in HELP:

ENJOY!

DISCLAIMER
I do not want to take credit for the documentation -- it came from various
sources including the OS3.9 CD-ROM.  And in some cases I've tried to
explain things in how I have found certain settings to work.  In no means
is this official documentation.
