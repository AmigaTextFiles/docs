<P>
Before continuing, there are a few things about cache organization that
you must know. In order to make cache access as fast and efficient as
possible, the main cache "buffer" must be organized in a special way. We
talk about "lines", "prefetch", "data buffer" and "minimal direct read".
</P>

<P>
These values all relate very closely to sector numbers. All devices that
are used to store files on have sectors. One sector is a tiny bit of
information - in case of a CDROM - 2048  bytes in size.
</p>
All devices have a controlling task (a running program) called a device
driver, whose primary task it is to read and write these sectors. This
might be the scsi.device for an A3000 with a SCSI-CD ROM drive, or the
tandemcd.device for the wonderful TandemCD package from AlfaData. If a
file system (like CacheCDFS) wishes to read sectors off a drive, it must
ask the device driver to fetch those sectors. This device driver is
sometimes called an "Exec" device driver.
<P>
The file system is a kind of protocol that describes how data is organized
on the physical device. The CacheCDFS can read ISO9660, RockRidge and MAC
HFS formatted disks. As the filesystem is a kind of interface between the
exec device driver controlling the hardware and AmigaDOS, it is sometimes
called a "DOS" device driver. The term "prefetch" is an indication of how
many sectors the cache will read or write for each physical device access.
If prefetch is set to 4, then this means, that even if the DOS only asks
for two sectors, four will be read. Since each drive access is a lengthy
and time consuming procedure, much time can be saved by "guessing" what
sectors will be needed next. Since the best guess is often that "the next
sector will be needed next", prefetching sectors in clusters is indeed a
good thing. Keep in mind that it only takes a bit longer to read four
sectors than to read one. It would take much longer to read four sectors
individually than to read them all in one go. Furthermore, as the
FileSystem really knows how large a file actually is and how the disc is
organized, those guesses have a very good chance to be correct. Prefetch,
or "read-ahead" if you want, can boost performance a great deal, providing
you set the prefetch value not too big. If you use too much prefetch, it
will not help you one bit. In fact, it will probably work against you,
slowing everything down. This is because the next sector in sequence
probably is NOT the next sector that will be needed, and so the cache will
be reading much more than it should, on each access.
</P>
<P>
The morale is to use prefetch with reason. Generally a prefetch of 2 or 4
gave very good results with ISO9660 formatted disks.
</P>
<P>
Moving on to the term "lines". Lines is a means of grouping together
sectors  in "blocks" of a certain length. If a cache buffer uses 32 sets
of lines, this means that the cache can remember up to 32 different
entries, with each entry consisting of 'prefetch' number of sectors. To
illustrate this, consider the following sketch of a 32 line cache, with a
prefetch of 4:
</P>
<P>
Set number       Line contents

0                [sector][sector][sector][sector] (4*2048=8k)
1                [sector][sector][sector][sector] (4*2048=8k)
2                [sector][sector][sector][sector] (4*2048=8k)
3                [sector][sector][sector][sector] (4*2048=8k)
4                [sector][sector][sector][sector] (4*2048=8k)
etc....
31               [sector][sector][sector][sector] (4*2048=8k)
                                                   32*8k=256k
</P>
<P>
Each line can hold any four consecutive disk sectors with this prefetch
configuration. If the file system asks for sector number 8, the cache will
read sectors 8, 9, 10 and 11 into one of the lines. By now it must be
obvious that more lines also mean more space available for sector data,
and therefore a higher chance that a read operation will be able to
complete with no or only little physical disk access. Unfortunately, it
also means you have to set aside more memory for the buffers. A compromise
you often encounter with computers.
</P>
<P>
A typical cache configuration is a 50-set, cache, with a prefetch (line
size) of 4. The memory required by such a cache buffer will be:
</P>
<P>
	50 sets x (4 x 2048 bytes) = 400k bytes
</P>
<P>
The CacheCDFS has also a special buffer, called "data buffer". This buffer
has always the multiple size of one line.
</P>
<P>
If the line size is 4, and the data buffer has a size of 4, it is
organized like this:
</P>
<P>
	[line][line][line][line] (4*4*2048=32k)
</P>
<P>
If the FileSystem does caching (it does not always, see the term "direct
read" later), it checks the actual file length. In case the file is longer
as the amount actually requested, the rest is read immediately into the
data buffer, and then copied to the appropriate cache line.
</P>
<P>
The main difference between the Data Buffer "read ahead" and the normal
"read ahead" is as follows:
</P>
<P>
The cache lines are always filled (a "classic" read ahead cache), so even
different directory sectors or sectors from different files are cached.
The data buffer is a more "intelligent" special read-ahead cache line,
existing only once and caching only files, if the filesystem "believes"
they are worth it.
</P>
<P>
So you can do nice caching even on machines with not much free memory.
Look at this (which is the default setting after first time installation):
</P>
<P>
50 sets with a line size of 1 (no "directory" prefetch!), but a data
buffer of 8 (8 sectors "file" prefetch).
</P>
<P>
50 sets x (1 x 2048 bytes)
= 100k bytes
</P>
<P>
+ 8 x ( 1 x 2048 bytes) (data cache)
= 116k bytes
</P>
<P>
This gives pretty good results, even on a machine with not much memory
available.
</P>
<P>
Now moving to the term "direct read". If you read large files (e.g. "off
the disk animations") it is pretty useless to cache all these blocks. The
file will purge all other sectors out of the cache, even such blocks like
directory entries. To avoid this, you can specify a "minimum direct read"
value. If DOS requests more sectors than specified here, the filesystem
will bypass the cache and the device driver will copy its data directly
into the callers buffer (if any of these sectors are already present in
cache memory, these will be used).
</P>
<P>
Specifying a value of zero (0) will give you a sophisticated default. A
very high value (e.g. 2000) will only do requests greater than 4MB
directly, what is very unlikely to happen and the cache will always be
used. Specifying a value smaller or equal to the data buffer size is not
very useful, as you would in fact waste memory.
</P>
<P>
For best performance, use the default (0).
</P>
<P>
Before doing direct read, the Memory Type and Memory Mask of the callers
buffer will be checked, if it fits to the device requirements (specified
in the mountlist as BufMemType and Mask). If it doesn't, the data buffer
will be used as a cache.
</P>
<P>
It's simply not possible to give you a recipe on how to create a perfect
cache. The range of possible combinations of all the above values and the
memory you wish to spend for caching is simply too vast. You will have to
experiment to find the combination that best suit your needs.
</P>
<P>
You can adjust all these values in the filesystem's mountlist entry using
a text editor, but this method is strongly discouraged - using the
CDFSprefs program for this purpose is much easier and secure.

<H3 CLASS="&Uuml;berschrift2"><A NAME="pgfId=1017106"></A> CacheCDFS Audio Menu</H3>

<P>
To play audio tracks on a CD you can either use the capabilities embedded
in the CacheCDFS filesystem, or you may use an external audio player
program. Usually CD-ROM Audio play will only work with SCSI-II or
IDE-ATAPI CD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
If you have enabled Audio support for the CacheCDFS file system with the
CDFSprefs program and if you have a SCSI-2 compatible CD-ROM drive the
filesystem will show an audio icon on your Workbench, if a CD with audio
tracks is inserted. The first track will be played, if you double click
this icon. If you double click again, audio play will pause. If you double
click again, audio play will resume. If you double - double click the icon
the next track will be played. If you have
defined the use of an external audio player program with CDFSprefs, double
clicking the audio icon will start this external player. 
</P>
<P>
You may use an own icon that will be displayed if a CD containing audio
tracks is inserted. CacheCDFS will look for the file ENV:CDDA.info if it
is started. If this file exists, it will be used instead of the built in
design. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this options are found in the CachCDFS Audio menu:
