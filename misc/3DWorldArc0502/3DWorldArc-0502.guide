Hello,

    I am having an odd problem with glquake on my 4000 060 Permedia2 100meg
setup.

This is that i get a letter box view of the screen mode i select which was
640x 480 and so am missing the bottom and top of the display but not the
sides.

Running cgx v4 /cgxsystem.library is v42.1


Any clues anyone ?


Kind regards

Drawing completely transparent triangles takes time, even though it's 
not visible, of course. I'd suggest you try to enable the alpha test, 
and set a very small reference value. That way, it should reject the 
pixels very early in the pipeline, and this should preserve some fillrate.

Alpha test is fully supported by the Voodoo 3, and it works on the 
Permedia 2 when texture mapping is enabled.

I fear that's the only possibilty ...

I couldn't see anything wrong with the code. I have couple of ideas what could be wrong, but they might not be too good :o)

Maybe you should set the alpha value of each vertex to 1? ...don't think it should matter here though since you don't do blending.

Might need to disable backface culling, or set it to the order that you draw the triangle. But I think that should remove the triangle when not doing texturemapping also...?

Try to diable perspective mapping.

Not much help eh? :) ...I bet the Friedens have better ideas.

Hi Oliver.

> have you thought about toonSHADING yet? 

Yes, I have :)

I actually implemented this shading method for my major project at
university, which I finished a few weeks ago. The problem is, to use it
for outlines, you need to quite highly detailed models. It also tends to
make them look a bit 'fat'. However, when you just use it for two or
three tone shading and do the outlines some other way, it looks great.

Paul

make the original object black and then fill the faces with colour (but
dont fill all the face - ie calculate the polygon to 'cover' the black sides?

hi,

have you thought about toonSHADING yet? i think it's the most common used
technique to do silhuouettes, not exactly the same effect than what you
described, but very similar by much lower programming efford.. you have to
detect nothing, all is done by a envmap which is coloured by your "filling"
color and has a black outter area around in circle shape.. it's a bit hard
to describe for me is my english is not the best, but take a look in texture
coordinate generation for envmaps (not cubic) and you should see that the
more the normals of your object tend to 90degrees from your viewing vector
the the nearer they come to the black area in your envmap (until they hit it
and you have a nice black out"line") this has two more advantages (not only
the fact that all of em happen for no cost):

1. you could add a third colored ring in your texture that produces a nice
shadow effekt and:

2. it "detects" not only the outlines but all areas that tend to have a very
flat angle to the camera, what is in fact in cartoons also lines "in" the
object..

try it out, easy and good looking 8)

Hi Michal.

Thanks, looks good... perhaps this is the solution. Thinking about it,
if you sorted all the edges into order by vertex number, you could
dynamically find all the joining edges and render them with correct
joints. It might be costly though.

That is kind of what it looks like they did. Take a look at these
screenshots:

http://www.gamespot.co.uk/stories/screens/0,2160,2024666-78,00.html
http://www.gamespot.co.uk/stories/screens/0,2160,2024666-25,00.html

On the first, you can clearly see the square edges...

The question is, how do you calculate something like that? Finding the
two vertices that make up an edge is not too hard, but how do you then
figure out what constitutes the outline? Perhaps scaling the object up a
little and rendering it in black would work, or generating new polygons
between the edge of the normal size and larger size model...

put a black polygon behind that is 2 or so pixels bigger all around than

Hi.

Cartoon rendering has become quite popular recently, for example it has
been used in games like Wacky Races and on TV for adverts and a Robbie
Williams music video. Part of the process is silhouette edge dection and
rendering, which basically draws the pen lines that artists use for
colouring (the black lines around objects).

There are many ways of rendering these lines, for example by rendering
all backfacing polygons in wireframe mode, or by detecting where a
polygon edge is part of the objects outline. The problem is, no matter
what method you use, there is always the problem of line joins. When you
have two fairly thick lines meeting up at different angles, because
their ends are square you get a sort of triangle cut out when it should
be a complete line. In the ASCII art below, you can see it at the top of
the shape:

        ## ##
       #######
      #########
     ####   ####
    ####     ####
   ####       ####

The gap on the first row should not be there... it's kind of hard to
explain. I could do some diagrams on a web page if it would help.
Anyway, some software gets around the problem somehow, for example Jet
Set Radio. If you look closely at some screenshots (I can supply a good
one) the line joints are not there, in fact it looks like an extension
of the edge of the object rather than a line. What I am trying to figure
out, is how can I create that kind of outline?

Any ideas? :)

Paul

Yellow,

    If I get it right, fogging is applied according to the W coordinate.
 So, how to pass it when drawing flatshaded faces with vertexarrays?
 Do I have to use TexCoord() function?

    And one more. Is gouraud shading significantly slower than flat
 shading (single colour) on Permedia?

W3D_LockHardware() forbids multitasking, so nothing can draw anything
while hardware is locked; but SPrintF() / KPutStr() do re-enable

That's exactly what Sashimi does.

From sashimi's doc:

Standard serial debugging output and Enforcer output go into Sashimi's
circular buffer, where it is noticed by the Sashimi process and written
to the output window. The Sashimi process is signalled whenever a
carriage return or linefeed comes through kprintf().

That does not matter. The whole graphics system is locked, and that

Text output results in a complete hangup, no matter who or what outputs. 
Same goes for any graphics operation that may lock something.

If you have a network card, you can use AmiTCP's TCP: device to redirect 
Sashimi's output (or Sushi) to a tcp port and capture that from e.g. a 
linux box, or you could use a terminal program.

Number two is using the program "mungfriend". It should be on Aminet. 
Mungfriend is like Sushi or Sashimi, but it captures the output 
reset-proof in a ram buffer. You can even examine the output after the 
program has crashed and the system rebooted. *Very* handy :-)

If I output some debug while the hardware is locked (via

'lo Thomas,

Sorry for the noise, my problem isn't with Sashimi (its RAM buffer is
working perfectly - I've checked in the source :) ) but it is a crash
in glDrawElements()... graaaah...

But anyway FYI:

The patch applied to RawPutChar() by Sashimi writes the chars to a RAM
buffer.
RawPutChar() Signal()s Sashimi's process every time it writes a newline
char.
Then Sashimi's process writes the contents of the buffer into the
window.
RawPutChar() doesn't wait for Sashimi to print the chars.

Thanks for your assistance

That's because they are relying on you to free the lock. They do similar
locks, and are blocked until you free the lock you have. If you would
just call LockHardware, and nothing else anymore, all other activity
would stop.

No, you aren't, but you are causing it. You are calling a function
(SPrintF) that in turn causes sashimi to print. As SPrintF does not
return until the characters are transmitted, and Sashimi can't print
them until you release the lock, there's a deadlock.

This can also be a terminal program on another machine.

No, look carefully: Hans-J=F6rg said "capture the output in a ram buffer".
Sushi and Mungfriend can do that. I bet Sashimi can do that too..

The key phrase is "written to the output window". That just doesn't work.
This is unfortunately a reality on the current Amiga RTG systems, and in
*no* way related to Warp3D. You can "achieve" the same effect by locking
a bitmap through LockBitMapTags. Try it: Open a window, lock it's
bitmap, and print something to the shell... It will deadlock...

Or even more simple: Try to lock two bitmaps from the same program. Same
effect. Try locking one bitmap each in two concurrent thrads: It will
work (that's the effect when you run Warp3D programs in Window mode with
other programs running in the background).

No, LockHardware does *not* forbid multitasking. It just locks a certain 
semaphore. So if your tasks causes anything that causes another task to 
lock that semaphore again, the other task is waiting for the semaphore 
to become available, while your task is waiting on the other task to get 
it's stuff done, which is waiting on your task.

Neither SPrintF nor KPutStr have anything to do with that. You call 
these functions, and they in turn cause Sashimi output. But the sashimi 
output will not happen without you releasing the lock, and the SPrintF 
will not return until sashimi is dome... a classical deadlock.

Well, it should run when you install it. No env-vars needed...

Yeah I have a FPU which I fitted myself. Sysspeed shows it running at 9Mhz
for some mad reason, but as I say Im just playing around with Warp3D as it
would have ben nice to see it atleast do something (if a bit slow) on an
030. This 030 isnt my main CPU it was salvaged for use when my 060/PPC died.
Was just wondering if there was any env-vars I had to set for it to run on
Mediator4000 and Voodoo3.

Thnx for the help btw. Is nice to see Thomas on here. ;)

Chris

I'm afraid there's no guarantee that Warp3D even runs with an 030. It 
might, if you have an FPU, but it will be utterly slow...


Btw, with that signature, watch out not to show up in NewsNet... They 
will roast you alive with that ;)

Hi,

I have just installed a Voodoo3 PCI into my system and am in the process of
upgrading further.
I installed Warp3d v4.2a and and trying to figure out the settings to test a
few w3d demos on my system.

at present my cpu is only an 030/25Mhz as my PPC is in DCE (Dead CyberStorm
Eaters)

Just wandering if it was possible to play around with the settings to get
the demos to run on my system with just an 030 Mediator 4000 and my Voodoo3?

any help will do thnx
