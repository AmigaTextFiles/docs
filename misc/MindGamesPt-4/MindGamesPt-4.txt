Match Wits

Here are five challenges that involve nothing more
than a few mathches and a healthydose of ingenuity.

1.) Can you pick up three matches all at once
    with a fourth match.

2.) Arrange 12  matches in the design shown below.
    Can you remove two matches and leave only two squares?

                  |    |    |
                   ---- ---- 
                  |    |    |
                  |    |    |
                   ---- ---- 

3.) From the same starting position as in No. 2, can you make
    seven squares by moving just two matches?

4.) From the same starting arrangment, can you make three squares
    of the same size by repositioning only three matches and not
    taking any away?

The two pictures "WordPix-1.Iff" & WordPix-2.Iff" are a collection
of small picture puzzles that you try and guess the hidden word or
phrase. For Example, the word "man" written with the word "board" below
it would translate as "Man Overboard"

                  |  man  |
                  |       |
                  | board |
                  |       |
