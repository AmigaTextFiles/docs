Yes but 45.5 IS A FAKE LIBRARY - for all intents and purposes it could even
be said to be infected with a VIRUS.

THAT is why it has been taken off the aminet and can't be found.  Why would
you want to run something that would only damage you?!!

If DtConvert requires 45.5 then you have no choice, you can't use it.  If
you do your usernames, passwords and keyfiles wil be spread to the pirate
sites on the internet, I don't think you want that.

All the best...

Try to patch the library you have into v45.5 in a hex editor (making a backup
first of course). You're looking for $9014xxxx for the version and $9016xxxx
for the revision (these two four-byte commands are often right after each
other). Try changing it into $9014002d and $90160005.

Yes, I just checked and I have the older 45.4 version of this library 
because of the bogus 45.5 version. 

Quoting the docs of DTconvert:
--
Fixed the bug that a descriptor was unlocked too often
in some cases. See BUGS section above about a matching bug
in datatypes.library V45.3 and V45.4 (V45.5 fixes this).
Fixed (both "datatypes.library" and "DTConvert").
--
Reading this, It's almost as if the author himself has a 'special' 
version of the library.

So maybe since we've danced all around where do you find 45.5 ? I seem to 
recall using dtconvert ages ago, but that was about 25 gigs of HD's back..
And I can't recall if it ever did anything..

I have 45.4 Thats avail on aminet as 454upd.

Next question was is dtconvert worth fiddling with ?

From: jack york <jyork@voyager.net>

Hello,

I am going to purchase a graphics card this week.  From what I understand
the best options are the Picasso IV and CyberVision boards.  Does anyone
have an opinion as to which is the better choice?  Also, I will be
purchasing an accelator later this year.  If it ends up being the PPC type,
would that make the CyberVision a better choice for the graphics card now
since they are made by the same company?

Jack

Seems after I did a search on Aminet for DTConvert I found this version
of datatypes.library that includes dtconvert.

It is a fact that WB dosn't allow a shell window to operate
the Wb title bar.
 There is a program I've seen to fix that, but I've since
lost it.

Does ANYBODY have ANY information on what it might be called?

Only get a CVPPC if your going that accel route as the two marry
together very well.

I`ve sold my Cybervision now but it was a really good board a lot
better than the CV3D version. 

If you do get a CVisionPPC remember you`ll need the additional cost of
something like the automonswitch. I have one from Eyeline and it is
perfect, I can now play all my old games etc on non CVPPC screens.

   well, what do you mean 'operate the WB tile bar'?

I'm afraid that the meaning's lost on me. If you mean change it, then you
could use MultiCX or MCP. If you mean change the menu items, then use
toolsdeamon.

See ya.

Why would you want to do this? Output to the shell itself is much neater!

Sounds like a hack... The easiest thing to do, IMHO, would be to change
the context titlebar for the current console window.

Thanks for the help Malcolm.  I didn't know I would need something
additional to get the PPC to work.

I like to use shell, yes. But the point is that I use toolmanager,
and can't use it without finding a wb window to select first,
then I need to select the shell again. This tedious operation
is...well it is tedious.

Console window....if the shell is the console then there is no
titlebar for a shell.

You know, when we hit the right mouse button we can use the
title bar for the program window which is active. Wb operates
teh wb title bar, Ced operates the cygnused title bar but the
newshell has no titlebar.
 I've seen a program that let the wb titlebar be used when the
shell was selected.

   Ah right, use menus on the shell. You don't happen to mean 'King CON' do
you? That has menus on shell, and has a scroll bar and iconify feature too.

Wshell offers a complete menuing set-up from a shell, incombination with 
some sort of popmenu's (like what magicmenu's offers) and you'll have 
quite a lot of power at your finger tips.

From: kevin gill <kevin@reko.karoo.co.uk>

Hello,
         I collect reko cardsets for the game of klondike.
  Many peolpe ask me if I know any www sites for them.
  Here on this justamiga onelist.com people ask where.
  there can find this that and the other.
  The same is happening on newsgroups.
  We have our telephone books with telephone addresses
  Would anybody take on a massive job on creating a 
  www. magerzine. with www sites.
  The www sites could be collected on onelist.com,
  stating the adddress and a short discripion.
  I'm sure this would be very wellcome to all surfing the net,
  and an excellent way of advertising them.
  Or have you any ideas on a www. directory?
  Or is there one now?
Kind regards  Kev...   ( collector of cardsets for klondike )

Subject: [just-amiga] Squirrel Serial
X-UIDL: d46cdfa29622e6178e1e6818a7802bce

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>

Dear people,
 
I have a squirrel scsi/serial unit connected to an A1200's PCMCIA port.
I am not actually using the SCSI bit, just the extra serial port.

As I have a 33K modem connected to this A1200's internal serial port
& it is working nicely, I would like to leave it alone...

What I need is a Mountable device entry for SER2: or whatever 
you want to call it,   
that uses the squirrelserial.device.  (in the devs: drawer)

So that I have SER2: appearing as a normal DOS device for me.

This is a special purpose setup I need for obtaining serial data 
from an external source & would be too-long winded to completely
elaborate on here.

Does anyone have a mountlist device entry for the squirrelserial.device
that they could supply me with, please....

Subject: [just-amiga] HPDJ 420C for WB 1.3 ???
X-UIDL: 4d34687a8ee36bc282a415416d402b47

From: RCWASH <Rcwash@concentric.net>

Greetings!

I have: A stock A500, 1MB, external floppy (with the rainbow checkmark!)
and 1.3 ROMs

I want: To get a printer for it, but spend as little money as possible.
Good quality black a must.  Color would be nice.

I have seen: Ads for the HP DeskJet 420C for only $99. A driver in
Aminet for the HPDJ 400C for WB 1.6 (???).

Questions:

-) HP's web page says that the 420C understands PCL 3.  Will this work
on an Amiga, or is this one of those printers which needs custom
software to run, i.e. Windoze-only?

-) Would this 400C driver work for a 420C?

-) Is there a generic PCL 3 driver for WB 1.3 which would work?

-) What is Workbench 1.6?  I remember upgrading my A2000 from 1.3 to
2.04, but I don't remember anything in-between.

-) And would a driver for "1.6" work under 1.3?

-) OR...can anyone suggest another similarly priced solution?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Shell has no menus. I'll post back and let you know that/if

I own a HP 670C and works very well.
WB 1.6? :)
1.6 is the version of the driver!
If you look at the web site of the author, you can find the HP 670C 1.17
driver, the HP 800 1.8 driver, ecc.

> Questions:

1.6 is the version of the driver.

In the archive of HP 670C driver the author says: WB 1.3 or higher.
So it must work for your WB, because I think it's the same for the HP 400
driver.
But you can download this driver and check.

hmmmm... One could feasibly write a little program that scans the
Workbench screen's window list for ones with tag WORKBENCHWINDOW (?? I'd
have to check includes...). When one is found, have the program call
ActivateWindow().

Err?? The Amiga shell is usually used through a CON:-type console
device. I don't see your distinction here. Note that since it IS in a
window, and you CAN get a pointer to its window (one of the CON:-handler
special packets...), you CAN attach a new menustrip to the titlebar or
change several other aspects of the window. Note that this form of
hacking is NOT safe, and I wouldn't try it with any of the CON:
replacements (VNC, KCON, ...)

As far as I know the Deskjet 420C is just a newer version of the
DeskJet 400. The Deskjet 400 is not a Window only printer so I would
think it would be OK. You might not actually need a new driver as it is
comaptilble with the Deskjet 500 for which Woirkbench 
has a driver (or at least 3 does).

Most probably.

Probably 500 for B+W Printing and 500C or 540C for colour work.

This is probably a typing error as as far as I know there was never a
1.6 version. I notice the 6 key is above the 3 on the NumPad.

Hi RCWASH

Hmm, a 500 isn't much use really. Printing takes loads of CPU time, as an
example, my 1200 030 just manages 720x360 in B&W on my canon, even then it
stops quite a bit. If you do get afairly new one, dont bother about
resolution because you would have to turn it down as low as possible anyway
(unless you wanna use the text mode) and colour printing would have to be
done in draft if you want it this side of Xmas

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga Audio -> Tape quality?
X-UIDL: 0d24feeda3141e5f267966faf26b1482

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

I've been attempting to record some .mods and mp3's i've downloaded off
the aminet to tape for future listening use when I'm out and about.

I thought the best way to go about this would be to connect up the Amiga
sound sockets to my stereo through the phono sockets. Press play
on Hippoplayer/mpega and then the sound would come out through the
stereo instead of the monitor or speakers.

Well up to this point its all fine, I then record to my tape and this is
also
find, when I play back the tape on the stereo or listen to it on a
walkman
it is really bad quality, not terrible but its not good enough to
actually
listen to.

I know the Amigas sound is old and obviously out of date but is there
some
software/hardware I can buy/use that will allow me to atleast have
nearly tape quality recordings, as close as possible to a tape quality
would be helpful, something that is listen-able.

If anyone can tell me how to achieve this or where I can buy some
hardware
for my problem then that would be great. TIA!

Toodle Pip!

X-UIDL: e1256ccc3327065d94e88f723462849b

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

In Amiga Format issue 123, May 1999, turn to page 4, just before the
'Month in View' page.

You will see the last page to the Epic Marketing advert and in the
bottom right corner you will see a heading 'Hot Software' go down
the list until you come to,

NibCopy2 - Removes password protection from games?
Lockpick2 - Removes password protection from games?

The thing that really gets me is that fact that they've added a '?'
at the end like they don't really know what it is.

Hehehe the title 'hot software' really does fit what they list there :)

A full Games Archive has been put online at the AIO website,
*http://www.aio.co.uk* . This archive offers a full list of all the games
ever to be reviewed in AIO from issue 1 up to the latest issue of
issue 23. Not only does it offer the game title it also offers the
overall review score and a short quote from the actual review
itself.

Now you need never search AIO for a certain review, just look
up in the Games Archive and you will find the game you are looking
for, its review score and a quote. You can then get the game or
download that certain issue to read the full review.

To access the AIO Games Archive visit, *http://www.aio.co.uk*
and click on the *MISC* link in the left frame, then click *AIO Games*
*Archive* in the following menu. (http://www.aio.co.uk/GAMES.HTM)

An AIO Utilities Archive is planned to be online within the next
2-3 weeks.

If you have any comments, ideas or suggestions about the new
archive then please let us know at,

    The audio quality problem occurs because you are using the phono input,
the signals are best put through the cd input or aux input.  As the phono
input has a different resistance rating, and signal input aswell.

I don't think your problem is actually even Amiga-related. 8bit audio is
quite good, and should sound fine on tape. If you have an AGA Amiga, try
out some 14bit audio players -- make sure you calibrate your system
first to clean up the glitches (if you don't know what I'm taking about,
check Aminet for the, err, Cybersound package, I believe).

Your main problem is gain/volume-related. If your tape deck is of a
moderate quality, it probably has input source gain adjustments. Playing
with this can help a *LOT* to eliminate audio clipping noise (if the
volume is too high). If you have a VU meter, then you can check to make
sure the level never rises above 0dB (red section, generally).

Enjoy!

   Well, does it actually sound fine when you play it back through the
stereo, or just it just sound bad on the tape? If it plays through ok the=
n
you have a bust tape deck.

   If it sounds bad anyway, does it sound way too loud? If it sounds too
loud, then your stereo is using mircophone volume for the phono inputs.
This means that when you put your Amiga sound through it, the sound is to=
o
lound for the stereo to handel, so it distorts. You have too choices:

1. Find/Buy a new stereo system. You should really use one anyway, as the=
y
sound better then crappy monitor speakers any day. =


   I recomend the Aiwa NSX-S3, as its cheap and has 'QSound', which sligh=
ly
mixes the two channels which makes paula's harsh stereo sound much better=
,
even on head phones.



2. Make a lead:

You'll need 2 variable resisters: =


cut the phono lead in half, quite near one end.

Strip the wires.

   Do as it says in this picture I've attached.

   Now simply adjust the resister until its quiet enough.


   Problem solved.

See ya.

And that was your Problem. Try to connect your Amiga to CD-In or Tape-In on
your HIFI System. Then record the Mod, Mpeg (...) File in Surround Mode (i
use Eagleplayer for this). It works fine..

By the way, hello to all. This was my first Post to this List.

Subject: [just-amiga] Printing Woes..
X-UIDL: 31836b92e00899c1f0a3b674a798b9b7

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

I've had a  Star LC-200 for years, its an old Dot Matrix printer that
takes a year to print but at the moment I can't afford to upgrade and
its not in that much use to warrent an upgrade.

I've recently been having problems with printin using Final Writer 97.
Sometimes the printer will just cut out and stop, a wiggle of the cable
to the printer sometimes gets it going again or switching off the
printer and on again will also sometimes make it carry on. Other times
or most of the time I have to reset and start again, this time it may
work fully or stop.. it really is random.

I have no problem with printing from the likes of CED but these are
simple
text and not font types with Final Writer.

The problem sounds like Final Writer but why would switching the
printer on and off make final writer work and also moving the cable make
it work. This makes it sound like a connection but then why does it not
do it with CED?

I'd really like a solution without buying anything new but thats just me
hoping I s'pose. Any help is appreciated.

Toodle Pip!

Just want to say 'thanks' to everyone who helped. I've tried it with
another 'newer' stereo and it works fine. I think the tape deck in the
other one must be bust or the heads are dirty.

Why was your name Andrew Crane in AF readers games :)?

Wasted Dreams master CD sent for pressing.
Yes it's finally happened.
Wasted Dreams is sent for pressing and according to CD plant we'll get
the CDs within 10 (ten) days.

07.05.1999.
-----------
What's new in Wasted Dreams?
Are you sick of SMALL ANIMATIONS and BIG BLACK BORDERS around them?
Are you sick of EXCUSES like "Amiga don't have enough power to play
full screen animations..."?
Well we say NO MORE BLACK BORDERS AND SMALL ANIMATIONS!
We have developed a new video format, which allow us to smoothly play
animations on FULL SCREEN even on plain A1200 with 4x speed CD-Rom.
So check it out.

06.05.1999.
-----------
Why Wasted Dreams is still not released?
Last couple of months we have spent solving publishing and distribution
problems for Wasted Dreams.
We certainly didn't expect to spend that much time on this, but the
problems were BIG.

06.05.1999.
-----------
System crash!
Last week we had a system crash and because of that we have lost some
emails we've received.
So if you have contacted us during last three weeks and didn't received
an answer, please contact us again.

Alive Mediasoft news....

*** FORWARDED MESSAGE ***
  Original author: steven flowers
  Written on: 02-May-99
*** Beginning of forwarded message ***

Hello,

As you may have read on our web site this week, Alive mediasoft have
signed
up a brand new game called Moonbases.  This is a futuristic war strategy
game by a group of talented people who go by the name of Homegrown
Software.  The game is now complete and has already received some good
publicity, so the planned release date is May 18th.

Following much success with The Prophet, Alive will be investing heavily
in
game publishing.
After much deliberation, we have decided that our future games will no
longer be released on floppy disk, all projects are CD only.
In another effort to keep the Amiga with the times, we are pushing our
development teams to write for graphics cards and PPC.

Alive's game schedule is as follows:-

CD catalogue 1.3        Out Now
The Prophet                Out Now
Moonbases                 May 18th
Phoenix Fighters        June 99
Goal! 2000                  July 99
Putty Squad               A little tricky.  Could be in two days or two
months but definately still to come
Haunted                     TBA

Thanks for your time, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards
 
Steven Flowers
Director.


                  ALIVE mediasoft

There is 1 deciding factor for me, will the games run from the cd or will it
be a DMS file jobbie? even moreso, have they been AGA and accelerator fixed
so that they will actually run on a modern system? I can't boot without my
accelerator, and no accelerator = no CD drive....

Thanks for replying Chris,I do not have the know how .

 But an email on site for Amiga www.sites with short comments ie:- games
 utils, progs etc  could be put on AIO.
 All these could be found by using a search for people surfing wanting
 the said games/utils/progs etc as in your email named {Just Amiga} Have you
 made.
 The trouble with yahoo/cucug org etc is not just amiga but lots of PC stuff, 
 and sites out of date.

 Yes this could be massive but all Amiga users would use it.

 The CU Magazine has now gone but AF still lives, could there be a 
 sister magazine containing the emails advertising Amiga sites?
 I'm sure that people would love thier site in it, and could fill
 many pages.
 Also I hate it when you go to a site then have to goto several other
 locations to find what you want.

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

These are the words I've used to find the program on aminet. I think it's a 
'recent' upload in the last year.

alias name commod commodi multi.

What the program is 1st it's a commodity. It's a very small program. 
You know how everyone has a different text viewer or sound/gfx player than 
you.

What this program attempts to do (and does fairly well) is ie: you get a 
program requiring Muchmore. You prefer textview. Don't even have muchmore on 
the drive.

Rather than editing every single icon youfind calling muchmore, you use the 
progam I'm looking for.

It intercepts calls to 'muchmore' and redirects them to textview.
Ditto with any other program you might run across.

calls to SYS:utilities/amigaguide send to multiview.

Anyone happen to be using this program, and maybe can provide the name of the 
archive ?

How can I make the printer wind in reverse?

Dudes, I know you can tell the printer what to print from shell
by saying:

  "copy system:spaces to prt:"

And for me this is useful, because "system:spaces" is a text file
full of nothing. My printer is told to make that copy in the
morning so that the printer turns around at that time- taking
the light-switch with it and so wakeing me up!

So what more could there be to know? Well there's this!

How can I make the printer wind in reverse?

It's lying.  If it's unsolicited bulk email, it's spam and should
be treated as such.

>     2    the return address is false.

A typical hallmark of spam.

>      These must be stopped            HOW?

http://www.abuse.net/ has a lot of information about how to fight
spam.  Basically, you have to examine the "Received:" headers of the
spam (some of which may well be forged) to determine where the message
really came from, then send a copy of the message (including full
headers) to the postmaster of the originating network.  I won't go
into detail, as the abuse.net site has a lot more information and can
explain things better than I can.

You might also want to sent the full message to postmaster@women.com
and report that a spammer is using an address on their system as a
return address.

Hope that helped,

-Stephen

   I guess they've just been installed on the CD with those various hard
drive installers/fixers availible on aminet, so they /should/ work.

I don't actually know though, its just that that would be the easiest option
for them, so I presume thats how they did it.
 
See ya.

Hi Rick

	Wshell is/was a commercial program written by W. Hawes (if I 
remember correctly). It replaced the Amiga dos shell and consol, with a 
shell that gave features such as file name completion, menu's, scroll 
back buffer, and many rexx features. Over time, other replacement shell's 
have appeared on Aminet with most of these features. Wshell, for many 
users that considered workbench buggy, an alternative system to access 
menu's etc. and Wshell can be moved through screens, but I don't think it 
will directly replace all the functions of WB. Confusing? well maybe, but 
it should give you a bit of fun trying to achieve your goal.

Pat.

Highlight offending email in folder and hit delete.

Seriously though, I Personally wouldn't waste my time and money trying to
find who sent this rubbish. IMHO it's realy not worth the bother. If you
send back a reply to the remove address you'll more than likely get another
load of spam as the sender now knows that this is a valid address. On
average I get about 20 spam mails a week, which out of the 3000 plus emails
from mailing lists etc. I get a week is not too bad. I probably get more
junk mail than this through snail mail, now that really bugs me, what a
waste of paper. And as for the idiots who ring me up doing surveys for
double glazing companies.. AARRRRRRRRRR. Just tell them you're a rabbit and
you don't have any windows in your burrow :) confuses the hell out of them.

        Our group has 2.0 in our collection of stuff.  Probably not on Aminet
due to the fact that it is (was?) commercial s'ware.  Don't know what it's
status is now.  The approx 114 page manual indicates it is by Wishful Thinking
Development Corp.  I'd have to check with our group to see if they want to sell
it.  Mayhap someone on the list knows if it has been donated to the public.

        Would someone tell me the advantage of this over just giving the prog

"alias muchmore textview"  in your user-startup.  Much less use of system
resources thus less overhead.

Greetings,

I've just had the chance to check out www.aio.co.uk. My first
impression...No ALT text for the Images!!!

I tend to browse with Images turned off because I don't want to waste
time waiting for them to download when all I want to do is read the
textual content of the site.

I reckon it's good form to add alt-text so folks like me don't have to
load the images, or hover the mouse over an image link to find out
where it'll take us 8)

Get it sorted! ;)

Well for design purposes, the above would be best, if it 1st modded the alias 
file and added what you want aliased. Then made it take effect immediately as 
it does now.

The one I found, all it did was made it current without need for a reboot or 
assign being made.

Yeah finally found it when I found out it when I used tool and alias. I have 
no idea how I ran across it on set 1a... Thats a real oldy/moldy. Maybe it 
was one of those daily aminet NEW barfs that was happening randomly awhile 
back.

You go to:-

   http://spamcop.net/

and in the place indicated you paste in the complete spam e-mail
together with all headings and they will follow it through.

Much better than replying to a false removal address!!

Subject: [just-amiga] imagine camera
X-UIDL: 605026690082f07a6c5b97d9a26ba71c

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

Can someone explain in 'Imagine for Dummies' simplified langauge how I can
easily get the camera to actually LOCK and HOLD like as if it were on a tripod
 ?

What I've done so far (simple enough) is to take a tube, take an IFF and wrap
it around Z axis then spun the tube for 29 frames.

Objects in pix are

2 lights (beside the camera) aimed at tube
1 tube
1 ground

I added a path for awhile there, but that just moved the tube all over the
place.

I used the stage editor to physically move the tube wqith camer lines on,
AMiga K to track,

What I get is an amateur photographers nightmare. All the heads are chopped
off.

I've changed the FOV from 55 to 90.

I've tried sticking the camera directly in front of the tube, but still can't
get a real full screen of the rotating tube. 

I'd like the tube to FILL the picture. But what I get is maybe a 1/4 sized
tube (still full sized) but only takes up 1/4 of the scene. the other 3/4's of
picture is background and ground..
I'd be happy with no background or ground. I only added the ground as a
reference anyways.

Using the action editor, I've used track to tube, still only get the bottom
7/8's of the tube..

What I have in mind is something like an animated cartoon, where one
revolution displays one IFF, next picks up a 2nd etc.. But till I can get the
camera to lock, and the tube to fill the screen, I'm wasting my time moving
past the 1st pix...

Hi there!

To get the maximum audio-quality, upgrade your Amiga with a 16bit soundcard
(Im a proud owner of a PreludeZII). I made a test sample in Samplitude
Opus in 8bit 27 khz and replayed it first via Prelude, then via Paula. The
difference is incredible! I also tried a XM-Module, first by using
DeliTracker (Module and Delitracker on AmiNet Set 7) with Paula-output,
then via Digibooster 2.20 Demo in Prelude Stereo 44,1 khz: same result as
above!

As there are several Boards for non-Zorro-systems, upgrading should be no
problem. It is the same story as with GFX-boards: Once installed, youll
never want to give it away anymore :-)

Thats why I asked for 'dummies guide to imagine' explanation..

I just hadn't accepted the camera as an object and didn't think about using 
the x,y,z axis to rotate the stupid thing. I just figured out of the box, the 
camera SHOULD have defaulted to level...

Fiddlin I played with the x,y,z and finally got all I'd asked except for the 
assigning keys ie:modifying the menu to add an amiga symbol next to keys that 
I can add ie: if Amiga N had not been taken already for something else in the 
stage editor, I'd have gone ahead and assigned it to single step thru the 
quick movie, made it permanent so I wouldn't need to keep pulling the menu 
down to see what was what. But best I could get was Amiga F4 and a toggle 
button. Would be better if I could make it a permanent part of a menu.

Righty first of all you don't have to have the camera track to the object.
You can just go into the stage editor and move the camera about (you'll see
the box representation in the top right) If you really want to track to the
object though I'm guessing the axis isn't in the centre. The camera will
aim diurectly at this. Goto the detail editor and load the object. Now
select it. There should be an axis there somewhere. Click on the SHIFT or
SHFT button at the bottom, this tell you that it will only move the axis.
now click on the move utton and you will be able to move the axis about.

Better still, just join the imagine mailing list, all the creators of
imagine are there to help all the time :)

Hi ya,
            Are there any HTML experts are here? I need some help before I
throw my Amiga out of the window.
        I have set up a website for MIDI files, but when I download them my
browser displays a load of garbage on the screen, this is the link I used

        <A
href="http://www.nikwilliams.connectfree.co.uk/70s/nothingyet.zip">Ain't

        What am I doing wrong. My browser will download MIDI files ok from
other sites, but not my own.

See ya

Hmmm. I'm having a bit of a problem deciphering exactly what you would
like to do :) But I'll try to help if I can...


The first thing to note is that STAGE and ACTION go hand in hand. i.e.
Any changes made in ACTION are carried over to stage, and vice-versa.

To "Lock" the camera in positon is pretty simple. Make sure you are in
the first frame. Postion the camera to where you like it (Turn on
"CAMERA VIEW" in the "display" menu), and set it's alignment to point
at the main object in your scene. Select "SAVE CHANGES" from the
"PROJECT" menu. 

The camera will now be locked in the start position for all frames. It
WILL NOT move.

The reason you only get the bottom of the tube when you use track is
because the tubes AXIS is at the bottom of the Tube. Tracking always
aligns to the object axis.

If you need to track to the centre of the tube, eg. If you want the
camera to follow a path around the tube, but still point at the tube
(like a satalite orbiting earth), then you can add an empty axis; and
position it in the centre of the tube.

To this, just go into action and add a new actor in the empty actor
bar at the bottom. select "track" from the menu that pops up. Then set
that as the object that the camera is aligned to over the 29 frames.

IF you never want the camera to move, make sure all the bars (actor,
align, size etc.) only occupy frame 1.

You can increase/decrease the focal length of the camera by alltering
the SIZE parameter in the "transform" requester. Eg. increase X to 640
to give a wide angle.

To easily align the camera to point dead ahead. open transform and set
alginment to 0.000 for X Y and Z.

I hope that's clear enough! anything else you want to know. . .

The HTML seems fine, just make sure you have the closing '>' after the </A
at the end... ie </A> and also make sure that the name of the file has
proper case lettering... remember that HTML is CASE SENSITIVE like all
programming languages, to an extent.

That's an error at the http level, not in the html code. The website sends a
mime type together with everything it sends. The mime type is usually
text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg etc., which the browsers recognize as
dislay-in-the-window kind of stuff. If the mime type is
application/octet-stream (which is the default type for unknown data), the
browser assumes it is some file that should be downloaded to disk. So, the
web server sends an incorrect mime type.

   Hmmm, I guess its because somewhere along the line a setting (probably
with your browser) isn't recognising it as a .zip file and so its just
displaying it as text (hence the garbage)

   There is nothing wrong with your html.

   To get around this, hold down shift when you click on the link.

See ya.

    Yep, that works. But my browser has no trouble recognising zip files on
other sites. Well, as long as the html is ok, my first attempt you see ;-)

    I didn.t realise about the case sensitive of files, but I think everything
is ok. I just wanted to know if the HTML was right, thanks for checking that.

That sounds very interesting & makes perfect sense. Any idea what the error
could be & what I could do about it?

One of two things - your service provider has badly configured MIME types,
or you have. Try holding down SHIFT when you click on the link, that should
forego the MIME type and go straight to a download. It often happens with
LHA as well, it not being a compression standard like ZIP.

Nifty!!

Disable the line buffer (if possible).
Send a bunch of backspaces (ASCII 8) to the printer.

Alternately, all you really need to do is send a carriage return or
back-tab code to send the carriage back to the left.

What kind of printer are you using?

Hmmmm... Wiggling the cable could disconnect the RDY line (IIRC) which
will cause the printer to reinitialize itself.

Alternately, perhaps the 8th signal line has been damaged. Since you
generally only print text in 7bit, this wouldn't affect CED.

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

I just picked up some fairly distrubing news after losing several SCSI and IDE

harddrives to my current a3k@25mhz.

And just a bit curious if anyone knows a bit more about it ?

I asked if it wasn't true that a3k's were extremely hard on hard drives and 
the story goes the early ones were fine with the antique drives, which got 
replaced as technology changed but the same chips that worked fine with the 
older drives were now killing the new ones.

Can anyone confirm this, and maybe shed some light on just what chips need 
replacing to work with the newer drives ?

Actually I had a 1.3 gig SCSI HD that lasted maybe a year with very little 
trouble then it just seemed to quit altogether. Sent off to softhut. They told

me install a new HD and it should work. That was just before all this trouble 
started. I suspect something was going, and most likely is still just hangging

on by a thread, but in the meantime it's eating hard drives.

Then I attempted to install a 4 gig SCSI (not going to happen, or rather it
didn't happen that drive couldn't even be recognized by 
hdtools). 

Went with the Buddha and since that (maybe 3 months now) it's gone thru 2 
SCSI 100 meggers, ate one 2.1 gig IDE, there's now a 4 gig Fujitsu IDE 
installed  and it needs to be reinstalled at least weekly. Usually more often.
I've taken to making a complete backup of the entire drive so there's not 
more than a day or two lost.

I have the tech manuals from softhut, but they don't really show any output 
voltages, or expected logic. These are more or less just schematics with 
names of the chips..

They're definitely not Chiltons...

Does anyone else have any leads on good hardware manuals for a3k's ? Or know 
of a GOOD repairman ?

It's a fair guess, but not likely in this case. How about movable bad sectors 
? Thats what I get off and on now. One minute the sectors bad, hit retry and 
it's gone.

Run the hdtool validate and it finds nothing.
run it again and it can't find anything of value. bad drive etc..
I'm still under suspicion of the pioneer cd causing most of the troubles but 
other than termination I don't see the link..

Right after installing asimcdfs, caught a guru, and lost a partiton because 
the CD0 in SYS:devs somehow got scrambled. This was one constant. As long as 
asimcdfs was installed an odd crash would almost always lose a partition the 
one being written to.

I know shouldn't fiddle with plugs with power on..

but

Drive itself is dead to begin with, .... SCSI drive, I take and plug the 
50 pin in, and the CD does a chatter..

The CD is plugged into the external SCSI plug.
Just wiggle the 50 pin on the scsi, and I can hear the CD chatter.

Now why would you ask me about the Buddha ? I haven't been able to keep SCSI 
or IDE running for months now.

I can't point the finger at the Buddha, as the decision to go buddha wasn't 
made till I couldn't find a SCSI HD local smaller than 4 gigs. Those are now 
6-8 gigs. I'm using the a3k this second with the buddha, I'd guess if your 
machine works, it may work just as well with the buddha. Once I figured how 
to install the 44.5 filesystem.

The docs seem to be complete, but they don't answer the obvious questions. 
There's very little on it re: using it as a IDE controller on an a3k. It 
would seem the Buddha was more or less a ZORRO IDE controller. Has nothing 
to do with machine.

X-UIDL: 8301204a8f248820feb88f636a3dc11b

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

Here's a note I left at the amiga hardware web site to Ian. I made it as 
thorough as I can..

I hesitate to send this back to softhut for repair, best they could tell me is

the hd is bad replace it..

Like blowing the same fuse (I'm on my 7th HD now 4 SCSI and 3 IDE's Buddha in 
use on a3k) and their solution is to replace the fuse. (How many times do you 
have to replace a fuse till the problem itself self corrects ?

I've been both an electrician and radio repairman for the AF and civilian 
life. But this one has me stumped.

Maybe you've heard or seen something similar in the past. I'm going to step 
back several months to when I sent it to softhut..

Ami was having troubles coming back from gurus, (nothing to indicate a drive 
problem yet). Took several reboots even to complete power off. Usually 
recovered after the 3rd power down.

Then it just wouldn't come back at all. Off to softhut.

They said the HD was shot. And it was. They said pick out a SCSI and they'll 
put it in. There's a local apple dealer so I paid the $90, and had it sent 
back. A seemingly perfect 1.3 gig Quantum SCSI HD that had no bad sectors 
(that I knew of), was now spitting out bad sectors like chicklets. Last count 
before I gave up and quit looking for bad sectors to mark in hdtools the total

was over 2000. I had to stop looking every so many sectors cause it came back 
with illegal medium or something and refused to look further. 

Tried the apple 4.x gig SCSI (HDTOOLS couldn't even see it).  Luckily for me 
they took it back next day... +$400.00 They claimed it was bad when it came 
back, but I never really got past just plugging it in. I spose this thing 
could have killed it, but not likley as I couldn't do anything with it but 
plug it in..

Moved on to a Buddha heard this seemingly has squat to do with the scsi 
controller. The developer (Jens) said you could unplug the scsi controller 
with the buddha in. I have no idea..

Ok got a 10.1 gig IBM IDE (Jens recommendation as he uses it in his test bed 
a3k), plugged it in, ran for 2 weeks then the ami couldn't find it. Luckily I 
also have a PC that uses IDE. so did a swap with the WD 2.1 gig IDE in the PC 
with the IBM 10.1 gig. the WD ran over a year in the PC no problems.

Quickly found out a midstream MASTER/SLAVE swap on a PC should not happen..
Lost everything on all the hard drives. But both drives still ran fine, just 
they'd lost all the data... And had to be reformatted.

At this time I took one of my Quantum 100 meg SCSI's and made it as JUST the 
SYSTEM boot drive. nothing on it but system..

Ok 2.1 gig IDE WD installed on the ami. Can't say for sure but think it lasted

maybe 2 weeks also. Used it with a SYS: (non-bootable) partition and as a 
bootable partition.

Then the WD self destructed. Couldn't even write the partition changes to it 
write error !2 or maybe !21. Tried to reformat it on the PC. The ami had 
definitely eaten it. The PC couldn't do a thing with it either.

Picked up a 4.x gig Fujitsu ( I have no idea if it's brand name or what) but 
this fuji has been consistantly flaky since day one. This may mean the ami 
was ready to self destruct when I got the Fuji (I have since lost 2 SCSI's I 
was using as boot drives with this fuji, but the fuji keeps flakily plugging 
along needing to be found and reformatted at least once a week. I make daily 
backups. I've now moved to a max of 3 partitions 1 200 meg boot part. 1 2000 
meg work part. and whatevers left for a backup part.

One other thing that suggests a loose wire or ground (trouble is I had the 
exact same trouble with an a3k @16mhz.)

If it seems like the thing isn't going to boot, a twist of the frame and here 
it comes booting just fine. I haven't had the case on now since it came back 
from softhut. If I can pinpoint whats causing the drive troubles I may put it 
back in the case.

Oh specs that may also help.

a3k @ 25.
fuji 4.x gig IDE  HD
cbm floppy
pioneer 12x CD.
CD0 (removed asim completely) Runs a bit smoother
Buddha controller
16 meg fast 2meg gfx

All of this started happening after adding a pioneer 12x CD drive. This CD 
drive hasn't given me a lick of trouble once I got it installed.

Installed asimcdfs, (this has to be a virus in disguise as a commercial 
product) After that using aweb, everytime aweb would choke on a GIF and crash 
while writing to a drive, asim's CD0 in DEVS: (different from the CD0 that 
comes from amiga) would self destruct, (you wouldn't believe how much time 
it took to find this problem). 2nd part of the crash the partition being 
written would also self destruct needing reformatted cause validate couldn't 
get past the trash left there. (I installed checkdrive and disksafe to fix 
this it worked for awhile). 3rd part of an asim crash, with all the stuff 
refererring to asim in both startup and user-startup the ami just cycled 
guruing in a reboot cycle when it couldn't find anything asimcdfs and the cd0 
in use was totally trashed. Then used the boot with no startup and edited out 
the asim refs, to get things back up and running.

Finally threw in the towel with asim and found the AMI CD0 works just fine 
for CD control

One more buyer beware story.. You MUST HAVE commercial CD control software.

Well.. do you run the web server software on your own computer or do you just
upload your stuff to some webspace provider? Because if you upload it there's
not very much to do, except reading their online help, asking the support
people etc. However, if you run the website yourself you should check the
documentation of the software you're using. There must be some way of
specifying a mime type with a file, be it in the file comment field or
somewhere else.

Firstly, get hold of a digital voltmeter & check your 5 volt & 12 volt 
lines from the power supply.

It sounds like you might be a bit on the high side...!!

It should be within half a volt....

Hi Ken,

Sorry to hear about those drives, it looks like you've had a string of 
bad luck on a grande scale.

> And just a bit curious if anyone knows a bit more about it ?

Reading your message doesn't give me too many clues and I know nothing in 
the old A3000 that could cross SCSI & IDE with the same sort of problem. 
I suspect heat is your true adversary, some drive seems to get very hot 
and go into melt down. There's is an off chance that you're looking at a 
power supply regulation problem.

Buy 'brand new' full warranty drives from a reputable dealer, check out 
your cooling system (perhaps another fan would be in order) and power 
supply system (with at least a multi-meter) and you might have a quick 
peek at your house line voltage. I live in apt building with a 
transformer just for the building.. it outputs 125-128 volts depending. 
Spikes in the electrical system are not good and lightning does take 
systems down. I've had a few failures.. most because of 'stiction'

Greater than 4 gigs will soon be fixed. But you should have 'seen the drive'.
With all your trouble you might want to investigate the PFS2 filing 
system.

I've always wanted to hear/try one of those Buddha interfaces, cheap 
drive storage sounds good. How fast are they? Of course IDE are famous 
for unreliablity :( but if I can get 2-3 HD's up for cheap... it would be 
better than digging in a box for some floppy.

Well most digital logic circuits use +5 volts, 12 volts supplied for older 
HD motors. The expected logic depends on configuration and software, not 
a road to go down.

You need some better luck... buy a rabbits foot and rub it every day. Or 
even better how about a dailyback up system.

I've got the manuals for the A3000.. but it's sorta like the blueprints 
to an F-16 fighter... it's not going to tell you why it's falling out of 
the sky.

Tom's hardware page showed a link to a refrigerator that cools chips down 
to -50, someone overclocked his 400mhz chip to 620 wow... Well it's 
icecubes and fans for me..

Good luck.

Could be a dodgy cable, but that wouldn't explain why IDE + SCSI were both

Nah nah nah, the program I want then isn't called wshell. 

This one I have in mind was a hack I guess you call them, it
simply changed things in some way so that you could access the
titlebar from within the shell window. Quite useful.

Now using Amigas CD0 vs any CD filesystem There's an inconsistancy to it that 
I haven't quite figured out yet. Might be nothing more than juggling some 
lines in startup, but I haven't tracked it down yet.

The problem: (semi-problem) Boot up, the CD Icon places itself just fine with 
CD0 sitting in DEVS/DOSdrivers. But soon as everything in startup has run. 
the CD Icon disappears. Pop it out and back in, and it's there till another 
reboot is needed.

How do I get the icon to stay in place (without any fancy cd filesystem) What 
is this out and back in that keeps the icon in place ?  Is there a tooltype 
command I add to CD0 to make it stay in place ?

The current settings are those that come with the basic CD0

device=scsi.device
unit=3
mount=active

Subject: [just-amiga] Digital Cameras?
X-UIDL: 48fdb0ecd1110f25cae6919eec756d9d

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Heya yo'all,

I'm thinking of buying a Digital Camera to take... erm pictures
obviously.
I'll be going to Holland in the summer so i'll want to take pictures
there
and if i drag myself down to the WoA this July then i'll want to get
mugshots
of everyone and everything.

As always with me, funds are very limited so i was looking for a cheap
Digital Camera. I've seen the VDC-100 digi camera sold by Power Computing
for 99.99 and wondered if anyone knew if it was any good? I'm
not bothered to much how good the pictures are as long as they are
colour, are quite good quality. ie. not fuzzy and you can pretty much
see clearly the picture, so good picture quality in other words. There
is a better version the VDC-200 which has better pixels, the 100 only
had 250,000 but the 200 has 470,000 and also has built in flash and
memory slot.

Does anyone know how many pictures it can hold at a time? and if
these come with any software or not.

I really really like those ones that save your pictures to disk, that
means I wouldn't have to bother with the fuss of connecting the
digital camera to the computer but just mounting pc0: and copying
the pictures off, ie. unlimited film. I've seen these for about 400
which is very expensive, does anyone know if you can get a
cheaper alternitave, the ones I saw where Sony, so they are going
to be more expensive.

Does anyone have any recommendations? tnx!

Toodle Pip!

Subject: [just-amiga] UK Mail Customs?
X-UIDL: a4fe78226099b214dc595a1689118f28

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Just to let you know that this isn't Amiga related, skip if you want...

A few issues ago in AF they did an article about buying CDs etc from
the U.S.A. because it was cheaper then here in the UK. Then a few issues
on from that they received a letter from someone who tried out what
they said but was writing in because he was angry that they didn't tell
you that you have to pay some import tax or something.

Does anyone know if everything bigger than a letter from the US has
to pay tax on or would that person have to have paid tax because
UK Customs open packages randomly to check what is inside and
because they saw it was a music CD he got taxed? Does this mean if
they don't open it you won't have to pay tax or does everything
over a certain size/weight have to pay tax and if so does anyone
know roughly how much it is for various sized items.

Any ideas on this would be appreciated :)

Toodle Pip!

I can easily recommend any of the Olympus Camedia ones. I've used them with
the serial port on my 1200 (via the y splitter on the modem cable) and
camedia software on aminet, just click on it to download all the pics.
Dunno how much it is but it hads a flash, card slot and does 640x480 or
1280xsomething. Also does 9 frame anims, panoramic stuff, red eye
reduction, and tons of stuff.

Idiot The article clearly stated that if may be taxed, he should have read
it more!

Random. They open every so many packages and see if they can tax it. Its pot
luck really. On the other hand, even if you are taxed then it will still be
cheaper than buying it over here, so either way you win.

 I'm writing an amos program which will match faces with numbers.
After using it a user will have had practise toward seeing a number
and matching it with a face.
 In practise this means that you can look at a number plate and
realise these few people instead and so have the plate memorised,
any number memorised.

Is there anything out there like it now?

 Most importantly, anybody know a place I can get all the pictures
I want? I want a shot of Superman, Plato, Chomsky, Queen,....
 But visiting each individual page would be hard as I want 100
faces.

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Most likely because printing text only has to send data down certain lines?
FW prints in gfx mode which would probably use more lines (just guessing
here) get yourself a new cable, if wriggling it does it, then it sounds
pretty obvious.

It's ok, but limited.  It takes some getting used to before you can
get decent shots out of it all the time - mainly because the way it
responds to differing lighting conditions.  It has 2 resolution modes,
but I only recommend the standard 320x240.  The 640x480 hires mode is
not really 640x480 resolution (it's a hack - pics tend to be blurry).

Don't read too much into the CCD values.  However, the VDC-200 is much
better all-round.  It's got an LCD viewfinder on the back, amongst other
things.  More importantly picture quality is much better than what you
get with the VDC-100.  In particular, it responds much better to
different light conditions, and of course, it's got a flash.  And the
640x480 high res mode is proper 640x480 (just as clear as stdres, unlike
the VDC-100).

If you can afford the extra 100 for the VDC-200, then go for it.  The
problem with the VDC-100 is that you really don't know if the image
came out ok until you connect it up to your Amiga.  At least with the
VDC-200, you can check - if you get a dodgy shot, you can view it on
the LCD screen and delete it.

> Does anyone know how many pictures it can hold at a time?

Here are the specs for both the cameras:

_VDC-100_

 Image / Video........ 250,000 pixel CCD / 24-bit colour
 Resolution........... 320 x 240 (standard), 640 x 480 (high)
 Memory............... Stores upto 20 images (20 standard, 10 high or
                       a mixture of both)
 Compression Method... JPEG (customized)
 Shutter Speed........ 1/60 to 1/16000 second
 Focus Range.......... 10cm to infinity
 Input / Output....... Analog video output
                       RS232 serial port
 Power Supply......... 4 AA 1.5V batteries or DC power adaptor (7.5V 0.5A)

_VDC-200 / VDC-200P_

 Image / Video........ 470,000 pixel CCD / 24-bit colour
 Resolution........... 320 x 240 (standard), 640 x 480 (high)
 Memory............... 2Mb built-in - stores upto 50 images (50 standard,
                       20 high or a mixture of both).  Optional 2Mb CF
                       card for expansion
 Optics............... Optical Viewfinder
                       Monitor: 45mm colour TFT LCD
                       Fixed focus lens, 250mm to infinity
 Compression Method... Standard JPEG (JFIF)
 Shutter Speed........ 1/60 to 1/4000 second
 Input / Output....... Analog video output
                       RS232 serial port
 Self-timer........... 10 second
 Power Supply......... 4 AA 1.5V batteries or DC power adaptor (7.5V 2A)

> and if these come with any software or not.

Yes, it's called PowerDC - I wrote it.  So, it's safe to say I know
a lot about both these cameras :)  I used them extensively while I was
developing the software, but now I don't touch the VDC-100 - it sucks
in comparison to the VDC-200.  But, of course, that's why there is
a 100 price difference between the two.

The Sony Mavica, IIRC.  That's the only disk one that I know of.

How many people here are planning on going to WOA this year?  I have
_never_ been to a computer fair before, and I think I might go.

From: Don and Lynn Benson <dlbenson@psnw.com>

I would like to get in touch with anyone out there who creates
newsletters, especially for computer clubs. The purpose is for
the exchange of design ideas and possibly exchange of articles.
Our club is quite small and our newsletter can be a maximum of 12
pages (6 sheets of paper) due to US Postal cost. I would prefer
personal email contact instead of the List.

Thanks

You would be talking about PowerWB would you? WorkBench Menu's available 
from the frames of windows as gadgets? Guess there's hundreds of hacks 
like that.

When CDNow send out the CD's they put a sticker on the outside of the box
with details of the contents, and their value in USD. AFAICT none of the
packages I've had from the USA have been opened, but only one has escaped

Hiya!

Yeah I`m probably going this year if I can make it.... I went last year
but it wasn`t confirmed until last moment so I didn`t have time to let a
lot of people I knew, know I was going to be there..... Annoying really
because I probably walked passed loads of friends that I just didn`t
recognise in real life!! :(

C yA!

It's simply incredible what Pat Kushko wrote on 14-May-99:

Frames and gadgets? 
 When the shell is selected, you can't use the title bar. You
must click on the Workbench window to do it, then click back on
the shell to continue.

I've seen a hack that removes the need to change the selected
window.
 I want it.

If there are hundreds, then where are they? Would they be in
aminet/utils/hacks or something like that??

                                               Cool Enough, TTFN!

Well I'm still not sure what you're after... other than to say my Wshell 
consol has attached menu's (these are custom, hence anything you want).

If you see something you want... hold on to it:)

I don't think you will find them in one place, given the nature of what 
you're looking for. E.g. PowerWB puts menu items in drag bar of windows, 
MagicMenu's puts pop menu's at the mouse pointer on a right MB click. 
Runbar brings custom menu's and more on a hotkey, Switcher brings 
everything to a popup window at any location. There's just so many ways to 
do & get what you want. I suspect you will find that one of these 
programs I've mentioned will become your o/s crutch.

Also check out the links page on my web site. 

There's a Theme "CrazyAmiga" I've created available on the Downloads page
that's not on Aminet, that you might like to take a look at. Details below.

Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more
'user-friendly'.... Their best approach, so far, has been to take all
the old brochures, and stamp the words, 'user-friendly' on the cover.

If they say return the email to be removed *DO NOT* reply to it at all
otherwise they will put you on a list for known 'real' email addresses.

This is usual.

Hehe, welcome to the world of the internet. I used to get about 5-6
AOL spam emails a week, i sent lots of them to abuse@aol.com and they
replied saying they had closed the accounts. Now i receive none or
one in a blue moon.

Does this not sound funny, anyone think AOL actually send the spam
out?

Well I for a FACT know i've got 4 people to put my name in and havn't

to spam everyone. They know most people will jump at the chance of
an 0800 number. I don't know anyone who has an account, until I see
proof or get mine which i'm owed i won't believe it.

I havn't been to any Amiga shows since 1994, I used to go to plenty
before 1994 but have never been to one since. I will try to make it down
but i'm not 100% sure.

I asked Andrew Elia who is in charge of organising this if there would
be a coach trip for us northeners to stop off at various main citys in
the north, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham etc etc. I would
100% go then but he said that they had no plans to, if you think this
would
be a good idea then bug him at,

If you don't already know its July 24th & 25th 1999. The venue is
the Kensington Town Hall opposite Kensington tube station, London.

I'm assured by Andrew Elia that this venue is bigger than the
Hammersmith and Amiga are interested in the WoA being kept to
these dates (does that tell you something special maybe announced,
released?)

Is anyone actually interested in running a big Amiga show in the
North?

Yep, afraid so. It's not just the tax though, the PO add a charge on top of
that for collecting the tax :-(

Star9Plus works fine... I used to use it all the time with my Star
NX1000 before switching over to a Canon BJC-4100 inkjet (not the
greatest printer, but it works well).

Are you actually *USING* a Star printer? (Or Epson compatible as I doubt
the Star9Plus driver has much in there which is actually
Star-specific given Star dot matrix printers implemented the Epson control
code set).

Have you set the printer to 7bit? I remember there being a dip-switch
for that. Check your printer manual... if it's set to default to 7bit,
then you'll just have to tell it to do otherwise!! =)

I think you'll find that coach companies already run coaches from
most cities to London. There's also trains - Virgin Cross-country
have some pretty good deals (although you'd have to allow a good bit
of extra time, as they're never on tim!).

are you trying to use a jpg as a background? I'm guessing that you also have
the options set to a HAM screen yes? 

1) dither it, don't use ham
2) try an iff, they load quicker

The picture.datatype supplied with P96 has AGA support - this should
work just fine on AGA machines.  But, as you say, AGA support was
dropped from the different v43 datatype for CGX.

You can find the datatype in gfx/board/Picasso96.lha on Aminet.  Just
manually copy picture.datatype to SYS:Classes/Datatypes - and, hey
presto :)

They (stupidly) removed AGA support from picture.datatype v43. That's
marketing for ya. CyberGraphX wanted to have it all to itself, then
P96. What's left for us AGA amigans?

P.S. The short time I got to use it (before they removed AGA support) I
found it to be a marvelous enhancement -- especially with dithering
enabled.

Oh! I've been hearing this, and even went to the point of downloading
P96 to check it out. Careful examination of the docs pointed out that it
would *not* work without a gfx card.

I'll try again, this time, ignoring the docs. =)

Well, in case anyone is interested here`s a little bit of information I
came across if anyone has any problems with spam from these guys!

Ok, it's official, it was a scam....here are their dox:

        12 Trent Crescent

        UK

        Tel: +44 (0)1869325139
        Fax: +44 (0)1869325139

Their system is a unix box, runnng unknown os (maybe redhat) using
wu-ftpd2.4.2BETA15. 

Wot you do with this is up to you :)
