 How Did I Conduct The Survey?:
 ==============================

 The Amiga Entertainment Survey was purely based on electronic mail networks
 including but not limited to, Internet FTP / News groups, Fidonet Echo's
 & AmigaNet Echo's and was conducted between the 13th of August 1995
 through to the 13th of September 1995.




 Why Did I Conduct The Survey?:
 ==============================

 Well to be honest, the survey was conducted as a vital part of my business
 plan, which at that time, I was in the process of writing.  The Business
 plan was attempting to verify the viability of setting up an Amiga based
 publisher & development house, here in Australia.  Obviously, since I was
 looking for a realistic result, I decided the risk of result manufacture
 was just too great for me to make public my somewhat personal interests in
 conducting the survey.


        I.e. This knowledge could have made people manufacture their answers
             thinking, they could no doubt stimulate interest back in
             commercial Amiga development.


 Although originally, the survey was written with a somewhat personal
 purpose, where I was trying to find out just how popular the "Doom" genre
 was amongst Amiga owners.  It quickly became obvious that this could be
 the perfect time to obtain some fairly brief statistics on buying habits /
 hardware ownership and personal preferences, without drawing it out into
 100 in depth questions.  Hence, the results could be of some use to various
 developers, be them commercial, shareware or even public domain, which
 actually became the final focus of the survey.


 Personally, to truly obtain an in depth Amiga gaming, computer entertainment
 result, we'd (Amiga owners in general) probably have to run a series of
 developer / public forums and brain storms to derive a globally suited
 questionnaire, and then employ somebody (?) who has actual experience in
 running and compiling survey information, to carry out the task.  To be
 honest, that person is _certainly_ *NOT* me :), but at least I tried to
 do my best....


 Note: Unfortunately, at the time of writing the business is still more a
       working concept, than a functional business, but we are still
       progressing towards our ideal, it's just moving very slowly.



 Survey Processor:
 =================

 Obviously, since this was an electronic survey, and I did expect returns
 between the 100->150 mark (which was a gross underestimate), I selected to
 layout the questionnaires in a simple tick the box fashion.  Thus making
 it simpler to automate the tally process, on a daily basis.

 Unfortunately, due to the strict time restrictions I was under to get the
 original Survey Data Sheets out, and some initial results compiled (I
 needed a progressive result within 7 days of the original posting), well
 the data sheets were not proof read, (grin;) nor were they really tested
 with the survey processor.  This turned out to be a huge mistake in terms
 of time, and attributed greatly to the sheer number of invalid surveys
 that were returned.  I apologize here by fully for any misunderstandings
 that might have occurred during the survey period.
 
 The Survey Processor was written in a hybrid of AMOSpro (gasp! ;) and
 680x0 assembly.  I selected AMOS for this task for no other reason, than
 it was available to me, and personally, I didn't really care about multi
 tasking ability in such a program.  The main scanner code is obviously
 written in assembly for maximum speed, with the simple custom GUI & data
 structure maintainance being controlled via good old Amos pro.

 I've included the processor program and all the valid surveys, so that
 you may experiment with them.  The program has been setup in such a way,
 that it enables you to select various filters on the four main survey
 fields,

        I.e. #1 Gender, #2 Age, #3 Location & #4 Hardware Type...


 To overview the survey processor usage,


 A) First you must LOCATE the directory in which ALL the surveys are
    contained.
 
    To do this, select the 'locate surveys' button (grin), A file requester
    should now appear, locate the survey directory and then *DOUBLE CLICK*
    upon any survey file contained within this directory. (Doesn't matter
    which one).  


    Note: Failure to Double Click on a survey, will most likely result in
          the Survey Processor failing to correctly locate the survey
          directory.



 B) Select your preferred Filters.

     Note: A raised box equal's an option that's being filtered OUT, while
           a lowered box represents an option that's being considered.
           
           You may mix filters as much as you like, but, you must select
           at least one option in each field. (Obviously :)

     
 C) Select TALLY to compile a results bulletin.

    Once the results have been compiled and providing there are actually
    surveys that fit your selected filters, you will then be presented with
    yet another menu, where you may 'View' or 'Save' out a results
    bulletin to disk.



 How Many Surveys Were Returned?:
 ================================

 Well, unfortunately I didn't keep track of the actual number returned,
 but I can assure you it was well over 300, probably ranging somewhere
 between 350-400 surveys returned.  The return rate would vary, from just
 unbelievable some days and then pretty well dead on others, with an
 unfortunately high invalid completion rate, of at least 50% to 60%,
 probably more like the latter.  Obviously, any survey that doesn't
 correctly answer all the questions could not be considered, as invalid
 surveys only produce unbalanced results.

 Probably the most common type of mistake made in incorrectly completed
 surveys, was multiple answers to questions where I had actually wanted
 singular ones.  This is more my fault than the publics, as I didn't
 make myself all that clear, I just assumed it was clear. (Because I wrote
 it ;).  The hardware related questions presented the biggest problem in
 this regard, as the number of users out there that own various Amiga
 systems, is quite amazing !!....

 PLEASE NOTE:  I only just thought of getting stat's on that.. Sorry! :)

 Any survey that didn't make it through the automated processor was
 scanned by hand and then either fixed (if possible) or discarded.  The
 only FIXES that I allowed myself to make, was just the replacement of the
 commonly incorrect Tag character / extra unwanted tag characters / extra
 spaces / added !'s / bogus numeric answers in place of the Tag character/
 and finally the removal of some ill placed user comments.   



 Results Delay:
 ==============

 Well, what can I say, it's been a massive task for any individual to
 undertake, having never been involved in conducting a survey before, and
 it's certainly something I'll think *LONG* and very *HARD* before ever
 attempting again.  The delay between the surveys closing date and
 publishing of this information, could have been attributed to perhaps a
 million things ( Where does the time go ? ;), but mainly due to my ongoing
 commitment to the development of my business as well as various Amiga
 projects. (Some Commercial, some Shareware, some Public Domain and some
 are just plain silly.. ;)


 But, I do apologise fully for the delay and any inconvenience it may have
 caused......
