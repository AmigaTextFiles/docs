What are 68EC020, 68EC030 and 68LC040?
======================================

   Motorola, the company producing the 680x0 family offers crippled versions
of their processors. They are a little bit cheaper than the originals,
that's why Commodore decided to build the 68EC020 into the A1200 and the
68EC030 into the A4000/030.

   The difference between the 68020 and the 68EC020 is that the latter can
address just 16Mb of memory. That's why the A1200 cannot have more that 10
Mb RAM. In most cases you will not notice the difference.

   This is not the case for the 68EC030: Many owners will notice that the
68030 has an MMU and the 68EC030 doesn't have. There are some important
programs depending on an MMU, for example Enforcer (a debugging utility),
GigaMem (a program to emulate virtual memory) or all current Unix versions
(see @{"Unix" Link "Unix"}). Other Amigas than the A4000 and the A3000 need an additional
processor card using a 68030 or 68040 or 68060 to run these.

   Finally the 68LC040 is a 68040 without FPU. See @{"FPU" Link "FPU"}.

@Toc "Hardware"

What's an FPU?
==============

   The first 680x0 processors (upto 68030) could process integers only.
Floating point operations had to be emulated by the software. An FPU is a
chip (or part of a chip) that can process floating point operations, a
mathematical coprocessor.

   One separates three FPU types on the Amiga: The 68881, 68882 and the
68040's internal FPU. The 68882 is up to 1.5 times faster than the 68881,
because it is splitted in two parts: A conversion unit (the FPU's are using
an 80 bit format internally) and the arithmetic unit. The 68040's internal
FPU adds a pipeline, but misses the trigonometric instructions of the
others. These are still emulated by the software, 68040.library for example.

   Special programs (Raytracing, DTP, Mathematics, TeX) are offered in a
special coprocessor version which are up to 50 times faster than the
original versions.

Can I use a 3.5' HD in my A1200?
================================

   Many people would prefer to use a 3.5" instead of the smaller 2.5"
drives as the former are much cheaper. This is possible, but you need a
special cable to connect the drive to your IDE controller. Additionally you
should put some isolating material between the drive and the main board.
Some people report termic problems but I did not notice anything.

   Some dealers offer a set which contains the cable, isolating material
and for about 20$. See the magazines for more information.

   Thomas Schuh (thomas@stepout.tynet.sub.org)

   If you are going to install an IDE-harddisk, regardless if 2.5" or 3.5",
you should always consider that the it may not work flawlessly, if the
drive and ROM-version have not been tested and approved by Commodore.
Regarding the A1200, one should also remember that this Amiga has not been
designed to hold 3.5" harddisk drives. The 2.5" drives, which are mainly
thought for portable computers, may have some advantages (for example in
power consumption, heat emission or shock resistance) that could pay off
because of the small keyboard case of the A1200 and the limited power
supply. With the larger 3.5" drives, ventilation inside the computer might
also be disturbed. If it is necessary to remove some shielding inside the
A1200 to make the drive fit inside, even radio interference may occur.

   To sum it up: if 3.5" harddisk drives could really be used in the A1200
without any problems, you could be sure Commodore themselves wouldn't have
used the slightly more expensive 2.5" drives in the A1200-HD.

@EndNode

@Node "Softkickers" "AmigaFAQ.guide/Softkickers"
@Next "Workbench"
@Toc "Operating System"

Can I use another Kickstart than the builtin?
=============================================

   First let's drop some words on the Kickstart's Copyright: This belongs to
Commodore, you @{i}must not@{ui} use Kickstarts, without the right to do it!
Especially it isn't allowed to make an image of anyone else's Kickstart and
run this on your own Amiga. (I even doubt that it is allowed to do this on
your own Amigas, if you have more than one.)

   But of course it is possible and allowed for some people, developers for
example.  There are two different ways, a hardware solution and a software
solution.  The former is to buy a card which can hold two or more Kickstart
ROMS and allows to select between when the System is booting.

   The software solution needs a program (softkicker) and an image of the
ROM. The softkicker allocates RAM, loads the ROM image into the allocated
memory and reboots. Of course you have less RAM after the Reboot: 256Kb when
running Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 and 512Kb for Kickstart 2.0 or higher.

   There are different Softkickers, some of them needing a MMU (see @{"MMU" Link "68EC0xx"}). I
recommend SKick 3.43 (Aminet, directory @{b}util/boot@{ub}) because it doesn't need
a MMU and supports many different Kickstarts. It is rather easy to create
the ROM image using the following program:

         #include <stdio.h>
     
         #define kickorig 0xf80000   /*  0xfc0000 for Kick 1.2 und 1.3   */
         #define kicklen  0x080000   /*  0x040000 for Kick 1.2 und 1.3   */
     
         void main(int argc, char*argv[])
         {
             FILE *fh;
     
             if ((fh = fopen("kickstart.file", "w"))  !=  NULL) {
                 result = fwrite(kickorig, kicklen, 1, fh);
             }
             fclose(fh);
         }

============================

   Die standardmäßig mitgelieferte Oberfläche "Workbench" ist nur die
Grundlage zum Aufbau einer guten, angenehmen Oberfläche.

What is MUI?
============

   MUI is a set of shared libraries which are used to build a comfortable
GUI (@{b}Graphical user interface@{ub}). The general idea of MUI is that the
programmer determines only the logical structure of the GUI and the look
(Font, Size, Windows on Workbench, Public Screen, own Screen, ...) is
determined by the user only. From the programmers point of view using MUI
is simpler than @{b}gadtools.library@{ub} but much more powerful. On the other hand
MUI interfaces are slower than GadTools-Interfaces, especially on old 68000
machines.

   MUI is found in two archives, one for developers only and one for users.

Icon collections and Backgrounds
--------------------------------

   The standard icons aren't beautiful, indeed.  But there do exist some
beautiful icon collections.  I know of @{b}MagicWB@{ub} and @{b}NewIcons@{ub}.

   @{b}MagicWB@{ub} is Shareware. The icons are drawn beautiful in pastel with every
known trick. You also get a lot of good backgrounds which beautify
workbench windows and MUI programs.  Fine and good readable fonts replace
the clumsy topaz8 font.  You also get good icons for the ToolManager.  You
can find a test version of MagicWB on Aminet.

   @{b}NewIcons@{ub} is Freeware. The icons do have relative intensive colors and
are drawn as three dimensional objects floating slanted in space.  You can
find NewIcons on Aminet, @{b}util/wb/NewIcons.lha@{ub}.

@{i}F:@{ui}
     How do I turn off the "Gag" of MagicWorkbench (the intro which appears
     sometimes during booting)?

@{i}A:@{ui}
     In S: should be a file called @{b}mti.data@{ub}. Delete it.

@{i}F:@{ui}
     How can I create NewIcons?

@{i}A:@{ui}
     The author of NewIcon currently works on an IconEd. Until then,
     Iconian 2.9x (I3) is the only way to create NewIcons.

@{i}F:@{ui}
     How can I prevent MagicWorkbench Icons to appear in incorrect colors?

@{i}A:@{ui}
     Register MagicWB 2.0, it contains a tool which patches the palette, or
     get one of the different tools from Aminet.

@{i}MagicColors@{ui}
@{i}ShoveColors@{ui}
     Its a good program, you can find it in Iconian, PictIcon or

What is the Amiga equivalent of . (Current directory)?
======================================================

   The AmigaDOS equivalent for the . representing the current directory on
Unix and certain non-reentrant interrupt handlers is the empty string,
which is written as "".

   Example:
         COPY S:Startup-Sequence ""

copies your Startup-Sequence to the current directory.

   There is some FD software available to patch a Unix-like interpretation
of . and .. into the AmigaDOS, including, but not limited to, Martin
Scott's UnixDirs. (Aminet, @{b}os20/util/UnixDirsII.lha@{ub} or Fish-disk 837)

The PIPE: queue-handler
=======================

   In the AmigaOS release 2.04, a new handler for passing data between
programs was introduced. This handler is called @{b}L:Queue-Handler@{ub}, better
known as the @{b}PIPE:@{ub} device.

   @{b}PIPE:@{ub} implements a true @{b}pipe@{ub} familiar from UNIX systems.  Its function
is to pass the output of one program to another program as input. You can
chain several programs together using multiple pipes.

   The advantages of using pipes are:
  1. No need for a lot of RAM to keep the temporary files, or, no need to
     slow things down by storing temporary files on the HD.

  2. Faster operation since the intermediate data doesn't need to be stored
     anywhere between programs.

   The @{b}PIPE:@{ub} device differs from the UNIX pipes in two important respects:
  1. It is a device, so the input and output of the programs doesn't need
     to be a redirected standard output, although that is the general case.
     You can also use @{b}PIPE:@{ub} instead of files, with two restrictions; you
     can not read a directory from @{b}PIPE:@{ub}, and the @{b}PIPE:@{ub} `file' can not be
     `seeked' in.

  2. It does not support a flush operation. If all of the data written in a
     @{b}PIPE:@{ub} device is not read out, it will stay there, buffered. Thus you
     must always `empty' a pipe before closing it.

  3. Because of the above, if unread data exceeds the size of the @{b}PIPE:@{ub}
     internal buffer, the program writing to the pipe will `block' (that
     is, suspend operation) until the data is read. See below on how to
     manually flush a pipe.

   The PIPE: handler name syntax is @{b}PIPE:name/bufsize/bufnum@{ub}, where @{b}name@{ub} is
the name for the pipe channel. Using names you can have several
simultaneous pipe operations. The optional arguments @{b}bufsize@{ub}and @{b}bufnum@{ub}
specify the size and number of the buffers used by @{b}PIPE:@{ub}. Normally, you
would just use @{b}PIPE:name@{ub}.

   The default buffer size of @{b}PIPE:@{ub} is 4096 bytes, and the number of
buffers (ie. channels) is unlimited.

Using PIPE: in a standard AmigaShell environment
------------------------------------------------

   First, make sure @{b}PIPE:@{ub} is mounted. You can do this by giving the command
         1> Mount PIPE:

in a Shell window. On an AmigaOS 2.1+ system, @{b}PIPE:@{ub} is normally mounted on
startup by placing the mount entry file @{b}PIPE@{ub} in the drawer @{b}DEVS:DosDrivers@{ub}.

   In an AmigaShell window, give the commands:
         1> Run List SYS: >PIPE:Listoutput
         1> More <PIPE:Listoutput

(1)

   These two commands list the contents of the @{b}SYS:@{ub} volume to a pipe and
then type it in the Shell window. You could also use:
         1> Run List SYS: NOHEAD >PIPE:Listoutput
         1> Run Sort PIPE:Listoutput PIPE:Sortedoutput
         1> More <PIPE:Sortedoutput

Notice that you need to `Run' all the programs except for the last one.
This is so that you can get them all running simultaneously. You could also
use several Shell windows, or any other way of running all the programs at
the same time. Also this might not work if @{b}More@{ub} isn't the standard
Commodore AmigaOS 2.04+ More found in @{b}SYS:Utilities@{ub}.

   In case you need to manually flush a pipe, for example because the
program that was reading from it aborts prematurely, it can be done with
the command:
         1> Type PIPE:name TO NIL:

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  Note that @{b}1>@{ub} is the prompt AmigaShell gives when it is waiting for
a command. The number varies, and the prompt can be customised to look
completely different. It is not a part of the command.

@Toc "Pipe"

The Pipe command
----------------

   As you can see, this is a somewhat difficult way of using pipes, needing
a lot of typing especially compared to the UNIX pipes. There is a solution
for that.

   Andy Finkel, a former Commodore software engineer wrote a command called
@{b}Pipe@{ub} (not to be confused with @{b}PIPE:@{ub}) that simplifies the use of the @{b}PIPE:@{ub}
device. Unfortunately, this command did not make it into the 2.04 release.
However, Commodore has given the permission to distribute this, and a few
other commands, freely. (Sources: Fish disk 673, Aminet,
@{b}util/cli/finkelshelltools.lha@{ub})

   For some reason Commodore did not include these commands in the later OS
releases, although they work fine even with OS 3.1 (V40). Thus all users are
required to get them from the above sources if they wish to use them.

   The Pipe command usage is simple. The commands to be run with their
inputs and outputs piped together are given as arguments to the command,
separated by the | (vertical bar) character:

         1> Pipe List SYS: | More
             or
         1> Pipe List: SYS: NOHEAD | Sort IN: OUT: | More

Notice how Sort needs @{b}IN:@{ub} and @{b}OUT:@{ub}. These devices don't actually exist, but
the Pipe command simulates them with the PIPE:. This is necessary because
C:Sort can not use the `standard IO', but insists on files.

   The separator character | can be configured to be something else with
the local variable @{i}__pchar@{ui}.


@EndNode

@Node "Pipe support" "AmigaFAQ.guide/Pipe support"
@Next "Quick usage"
@Prev "Pipe command"
@Toc "Pipe"

Pipe command support in AmigaShell
----------------------------------

   There is a little known and quite useful undocumented feature built in
the 2.04+ AmigaShell, that is, AmigaShell knows about the @{b}Pipe@{ub} command. By
setting the local variable @{i}_pchar@{ui}, you can use pipes without even entering
the Pipe command. AmigaShell will prepend it on the command line
automatically if it sees the pipe separator command specified by _pchar on
the command line.

   Thus, after the command:
         1> Set _pchar "|"

(1)

   the above examples can be used like this:
         1> List SYS: | More
             or
         1> List SYS: NOHEAD | Sort IN: OUT: | More

   Those familiar with the UNIX pipes will notice how the usage is very
similar to the UNIX pipe usage.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  The quotes around the vertical bar are important, to avoid
AmigaShell interpreting the command as an attempt to use PIPE:, if @{i}_pchar@{ui}
is already set (for example if the Shell is started from within another
one).

     @{b}util/cli/hacks204.lha@{ub}.

  2. Install the commands in this archive in your Shell search path,
     preferably C:.

  3. Put the command @{b}Set _pchar |@{ub} in your @{b}S:Shell-Startup@{ub} file.

  4. Restart your AmigaShell so that it reads the @{b}S:Shell-Startup@{ub}.

  5. Try @{b}List SYS: | More@{ub}

  6. Read the ShellTools documentation and experiment.

other by @{b};@{ub}.

              PIPE: Unknown command

     I have @{b}PIPE:@{ub} mounted, what's wrong?

@{i}A:@{ui}
     AmigaShell is referring to the command @{b}Pipe@{ub} in the error, not the
     @{b}PIPE:@{ub} device. You haven't installed the commands in the ShellTools
     archive.

@{i}Q:@{ui}
     I get a requester that says
              Please insert volume PIPE: in any drive

     when I try any of the command examples.

@{i}A:@{ui}
     @{b}PIPE:@{ub} is not mounted. Try @{b}Mount PIPE:@{ub}. If that doesn't work, refer to
     your AmigaDOS manual or a friend that knows how to mount devices.

@{i}Q:@{ui}
     When I try any of the examples the More window pops up but nothing is
     shown/I get an error afterwards/More pops up a file requester.

@{i}A:@{ui}
     You are not using the standard AmigaOS @{b}More@{ub} command. Either use
     another name or install a command that supports pipes.  Possibilities
     are the C= More, Less, or Most for example.

@{i}Q:@{ui}
     With use of PIPE:, sometimes characters get lost. What happened?

@{i}A:@{ui}
     Up to OS 3.1, the queue-handler has some bugs which don't allow a
     really foolproof transmission of data.  A compatible replacement for
     the queue-handler can be founbd on Aminet, @{b}util/sys/HWGQueue.lha@{ub}.

@{i}Q:@{ui}
     None of these happen but it still doesn't work as you described.

@{i}A:@{ui}
     Are you using OS 2.04 later? Are you using the standard AmigaShell?
     Try with all extras disabled.

What are chunky and planar displays?
====================================

   Simply put, the terms @{b}chunky@{ub} and @{b}planar@{ub} (short for @{b}bitplanar@{ub}) refer to
different ways of storing graphics information in a computer's memory. They
are rather easy to understand, as far as things go, but incredibly
difficult to explain:

   Computer images are arranged as a grid of pixels, each of which can be
thought of as a number representing the color number of the pixel, sort of
like a paint-by-numbers scheme.  For example, here's a simplified example
image, in four colors:

        00302132

   The Amiga stores this image in a @{b}bitplane@{ub} mode. That is, it is
represented by several planes of bits (binary digits, 1s or 0s). This is a
four-color image, so each color number could be represented by two bits.
Therefore there are two bitplanes:

        00100110    Here's bitplane 0
        00101011    And here's bitplane 1
        --------    Now, let's add them up, binary style:
        00302132

   Which is the final image. If the image was in two dimensions, it would
truly be composed of bit planes. However, I'd need three dimensions to show
multiple bitplanes overlayed, and therefore for simplicity we're working in
one dimension (which is all we need).

   Now, there's another way of storing this image.  How about if we
localize the bit data in little chunks?

        00 00 11 00 01 10 11 01 = 00302132

   This is the principle of the @{b}chunky@{ub} pixel mode.

   Both methods of image storage are perfectly logical, and no one can say
that one is better than the other. However, there are certain technical
aspects which cause certain advantages and disadvantages.

   First, if you've seen colored text scroll on your Amiga, you know there
is a bit of "flicker" that arises. Specifically, what happens is that while
the text is scrolling, its color temporarily changes to something
completely different. What's happening is that the computer's moving
several bitplanes of data while the raster (monitor electron gun) is
sweeping across the screen. What that means is that, if the raster catches
the data while it's being moved, you can end up with some bitplanes being
moved and some not. What if we filled bitplane 1 in the example above with
0s? Instantly all the 3s become 1s, and the 2s become 0s! This is what
causes "flicker" when certain colors are scrolled. By contrast, if a chunky
pixel display is caught while scrolling, all we see is a partially-scrolled
image; the colors are preserved (since their units are the small ones).

   That's a disadvantage to planar pixels, but what about chunky pixels?
Well, recall that a computer organizes information in terms of 8 bit bytes.
These groups are static; you cannot decide to all of a sudden organize data
in terms of three bytes or something! Therefore, when using chunky pixels,
things get complicated if we decide to use a nonconvenient number of bits
per pixel. In practice, the 8-bit (256-color) mode, and 24-bit (16 million
color) modes are the most common candidates for chunky pixel displays.

   Finally, certain effects can be accomplished with the different systems.
Bitplanar mode is particularly useful for things like shadows (where an
extra bitplane is set with 1s instead of 0s), and chunky mode is great for
perspective and "mapping" (since the data for each pixel is localized in a
single "chunk"). The latter advantage makes chunky pixel mode really great
for games, and is what made Wolfenstein 3-D possible.

   We all know that Amigas use the bitplane system for storing images.
However, the Macintosh and PC(VGA) both use chunky pixel modes. While we
can optimize our RAM usage with "bizarre" modes like 8- and 128-color, they
gain the advantages of non-flicker scrolling, and the programming
simplicity of just writing a byte where you want the pixel to go.

   The difference between the two modes becomes problematic in things like
emulation. EMPLANT has a "chunky to planar" routine which it uses to
convert a Macintosh display into an Amiga one. "Chunky to planar" routines
are also useful for getting chunky-inclined things to run on Amigas (see
TMAPDemo, rotdemo). On a side note, there was some confusion as to what
EMPLANT used the MMU for with regard to chunky to planar. The MMU itself is
incapable of performing the algorithm for the conversion; rather, it is
used to detect what portions of the display memory are updated from the Mac
side, and therefore the processor is saved from having to perform the
chunky to planar conversion for the entire display.

   I sincerely hope that helped clear up most of the mystery concerning the
terms "Chunky" and "Planar"!

What is doublebuffering?
========================

   Don't be ashamed if you haven't a clue as to what this is. It's rather
simple, really. Imagine you wanted to animate something by drawing out each
frame. Now imagine you had only one piece of paper. Even if you drew pretty
fast, it would be difficult to see what the animation looks like because
you'd have to erase the frame you just drew, in order to draw the next one!

   What if you had two pieces of paper? Why, then, you could see the
difference between two adjacent frames. First you'd draw your first frame
on the first piece of paper, then you'd draw the second frame on the other
piece.  Then you'd erase the picture on the first piece of paper, and draw
in the third frame. Then you'd erase the picture on the second piece of
paper, and draw in the fourth frame, and so forth.

   This is the principle of doublebuffering. The computer shows you the
picture it just drew, then turns around and draws the next one. It then
swaps the picture in front of you with the one it just drew, and repeats
the process. The result is a smooth animation, because you never need to
see the computer draw; all you see is each finished product.

What monitors will work on my Amiga 1200/4000?
==============================================

   Monitors can be classified after the horizontal scan frequency they
require.  TVs, as well as C='s 1084 monitor, need frequencies around 15
kHz. VGA/SVGA need approx. 30 kHz. Multisync monitors can take many
frequencies.

   In short: You can use any monitor you want with an A1200. BUT:

   - If you use a regular VGA/SVGA monitor, you can only use a few display
     modes (like DblPAL, DblNTSC and/or Productivity). I.e. (320|640) x
     (256|512|1024) for DblPAL. This is great for Workbench and all
     "serious" utilities (DTP etc), but don't expect any games to work...
     they don't use your preferences, just take over the machine and assume
     a 15 kHz monitor. Also, you cannot utilize the  "Early Startup
     Control" screen (you know, disable cache, and that stuff), which also
     requires a 15 kHz monitor. Furthermore, VGA monitors don't have
     speakers. And the VGA-type modes don't support Genlocks. But for a lot
     of "serious" work, a VGA monitor is quite adequate.

   - You already know what happens with a 15 kHz monitor; the flickering in
     Interlace mode. A small tip: Try to use NTSC instead of PAL. This
     increases the refresh rate from 25 Hz to 30 Hz, at the expense of
     lower vertical resolution (482 lines maximum). The NTSC and PAL modes
     aren't as bad as many people think. If your monitor has a lot of
     phosphorous (long afterglow), PAL Laced can be quite OK, and it gives
     you a resolution of 1448x566 in SuperHiRes. That's the highest
     resolution currently supported on AGA Amigas, in _any_ display mode.

   - A Multisync gives you the best of both worlds. The 1940 and 1942
     monitors from C= are quite OK, although rather cumbersome to use...
     The h/v size and offset must be set manually each time you switch
     display mode.  (1) The 1960 monitor doesn't have this problem, but
     it's a bit more expensive.

   For a VGA/SVGA or Multisync monitor, you'd need a little shiny box which
gives you the standard 15-pin "D" connector. It costs around $15.

   There are other alternatives... like the "AmiVGA" box ($50 or so), which
I think is a cheapo version of the Flicker Fixer. (But it's really a shame
to use this on an AGA Amiga.)

   Also, you can get a VGA monitor, and hook up your TV to the composite or
RF port on the Amiga - one monitor for games, one for serious stuff.

How do I switch between PAL and NTSC?
=====================================

   PAL and NTSC are two different video standards, the former being
European, and the latter being American. PAL has a slightly taller screen
(256 lines non-interlaced, non-overscanned) as opposed to NTSC (200 lines),
so if you see the bottom portion of a program's screen getting cut off on
your American machine, chances are the program was written for PAL, and is
running on your shorter NTSC screen. PAL and NTSC differences are somewhat
less important to European users; since their machines default to PAL,
running an NTSC program is no more than a minor annoyance having the screen
only appear in the top portion of the display.

   Therefore, for us NTSC folks, switching into PAL mode becomes important
to avoid loss of some picture on Euro Demos, etc.

   First, the most common misconception about switching between PAL and
NTSC is that you need a Multiscan or special monitor for such a purpose.
Not so! Just about any monitor can handle the minor signal difference
between PAL and NTSC (50Hz vertical refresh versus 60Hz). The 108x, 19xx,
and 20xx series, and even most TVs, can display both PAL and NTSC.
Sometimes it is necessary to perform minor tweaking of vertical hold and/or
v. size on your monitor to achieve full display, though this is trivial.

   What IS needed to switch between PAL and NTSC in software, is a "Fatter"
(1MB) Agnus or better. If your system has more than 512K of CHIP RAM (use
the avail command to find out) you have this chip. If you do not, ou can
still construct a hardware switch (see below).

   The following directions assume you're an NTSC user who wants to switch
into PAL mode, but the procedure for going from PAL to NTSC is much the
same.

   The most common use of switching into PAL is for self-booting games,
demos, etc.  The best way to accomplish this on pre-3.0 systems is to use
Chris Hames' Degrader program (most recent version: 1.30). Once you have
procured this program, the switch is as simple as selecting "50Hz", and
"50Hz System", then installing the program's ROMTag (little program that
runs at boot-time) by pressing the "Survive Reset(s)" button.

   AmigaDOS 3.0 added a PAL/NTSC switch feature to its Boot Menu, and all
you need to do in order to access this is hold down both mouse buttons as
the computer boots. Select Display Options, Display Mode/PAL, and then
Boot. If the program still fails to go into PAL mode (Zool is one I've
found), you may wish to get Degrader anyway and try that.

   Software PAL/NTSC switching is easy and painless. Some people have gone
even further by installing hardware PAL/NTSC switches. This results in a
system which even the most nasty hardware-banging programs can't bring to
its original configuration (if it has been switched).  The procedure is
simple - most Amigas have jumpers already - but beyond the scope of this
document.

   Therefore, if your screen is too short or cut off, seek the different
screen mode. You'll "see new horizons", literally!

   (Joseph Luk, jluc@eis.calstate.edu)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  PAL/NTSC switching with a MultiSync monitor is possible on 2.0+ and
easily accomplished by moving the PAL monitor type to (or NTSC, as
applicable, I have them both in) the Devs/Monitors drawer (from the
Storage/Monitors drawer), reboot, then go into the Prefs drawer and select
the ScreenMode program. You will see at least two PAL modes available (PAL
and PAL Interlaced). Simply select one of the (usually non-interlaced for
demos) and select "Use". All windows on the Workbench will close, the video
mode will change, and then the windows will reopen - that simple!

What documentation do I need as an Amiga programmer?
====================================================

   The best information available are the RKMs (ROM Kernel Manuals), 3rd
edition, by Commodore, published by Addison-Wesley:
     The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Libraries, ISBN 0-201-56774-1
     The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Devices, ISBN 0-201-56775-X
     The Amiga ROM Kernel Manual:  Includes and Autodocs, ISBN
                                                          0-201-56773-3
     The Amiga Hardware Manual, ISBN 0-201-56776-8
     The Amiga User Interface Style Guide, ISBN 0-201-57757-7

Especially the RKM: Libraries is a must. The RKM: Includes and Autodocs
isn't that much worth: Better get the same stuff on disk instead to have it
online.  See @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}.

   AmigaDOS isn't included in these books. The Autodocs give much
information, but to go deeper you probably need
     The AmigaDOS Manual, 3rd Edition, ISBN 0-553-35403-5
   published by Bantam Books.

   A better choice for developers is
     The Amiga Guru Book

by Ralph Babel. The book starts with a survey on different aspects of
programming the Amiga. (About 250 pages) Useful for beginners are the
sections on the Amiga's data types (not to be confused with the 3.x
DataTypes used by MultiView, for example), the Includes and the amiga.lib.
But even experienced programmers will find useful things here that are
missing in the RKMs.  But the largest part are about 500 pages on AmigaDOS
and, as I think, the most important, because AmigaDOS is the worst
officially documented part of the OS. The book is rather concise and hence
not as easy to read as the RKMs, but I recommend it as an addition and
instead of the AmigaDOS manual.  (Not, however, a replacement for the
Libraries and Devices, which aren't covered here.) Unfortunately the book
has no ISBN and is available in special stores only. But there are some
mail order companies which offer it for about 50$ and which accept credit
cards:

==================================

   The only legal way to get the includes and autodocs (and you @{i}should@{ui} get
them, they are @{i}very@{ui} useful!) is to become a developer (see @{"Developer" Link "Developer"}) or to
buy the @{b}NDU@{ub} (Native developers update kit, also known as @{b}NDUK@{ub} or @{b}NDK@{ub}),
which is offered by CATS. They cost about 30$ plus shipping and this seems
to me to be a fair price. See @{"CATS" Link "CATS"}.  The current version is 3.1.

   If you need only the includes, you could get them as well with a compiler

How do I become a developer?
============================

   You need the @{b}ADSP@{ub} (Amiga Developer Support Program) documents. To get
this write a letter to your local Commodore branch asking for these
documents.  Everything else should be explained there. The german address
(for the US address see @{"CATS" Link "CATS"}) is
         Commodore
         Lyoner Strasse 38
         60528 Frankfurt
   There are three different developer versions:
@{i}Registered@{ui}
     developers get access to the CBMNET (kind of a Commodore-internal
     Usenet), which makes it possible to discuss problems with other
     developers, Commodore engineers included. Registered developers pay
     about US$80 per year, plus initial US$30 initially.

@{i}Certified@{ui}
     developers seem to me the most interesting claass: They have the
     possibility copy the most beta versions of the system software
     (Kickstart and Workbench) and the respective Includes and AutoDocs.
     (Not all beta versions and especially no beta hardware.) You pay about
     US$250 per year plus US$50 initially for this.

@{i}Commercial@{ui}
     developers finally have in most details the same as certified
     developers, but may expect to get more beta versions and sooner,
     included beta hardware (This has @{i}not@{ui} always been so in the past.),
     hencethey pay about US$400 plus US$50 initially.

The above describes the prices and the situation in Germany and might be
different elsewhere. Especially not all Commodore branches offer the
registered status. A hint is to build a group of users and become a
developer group, so the costs are reduced.

   All developers have to sign non-disclosure agreements (@{b}NDA@{ub}) which specify
that we may not discuss information outside of authorized areas even to
other developers until given explicit permission by Commodore.

What compilers (assemblers) are there?
======================================

   There is a lot of programming languages on the Amiga, commercial as well
as freely distributable. I will enumerate only those that I know or which
seem it worth to me otherwise.

@{i}Assembler@{ui}
     All C-compilers have an Assembler included. Freely distributable are
     A68K and PhxAss (directory @{b}dev/asm@{ub} on Aminet or Fish disks 521 and 906)

     Commercial Assemblers are MaxonASM, OMA3.0 and DevPack3.14.

@{i}Basic@{ui}
     The following commercial Basic-compiler/interpreter are available:
     BlitzBasic2, Amos and MaxonBasic3.

@{i}C@{ui}
@{i}C++@{ui}
     Freely distributable C-compilers are @{b}gcc@{ub} (which has its own directory
     @{b}dev/gcc@{ub} on Aminet) and the evaluation version of @{b}Dice@{ub} (for example per
     FTP from @{b}ftp.uni-paderborn.de@{ub}, directory
     @{b}/news/comp.binaries.amiga/volume91/languages@{ub} or on Fish disk 491).
     The advantage of gcc is that you find gcc versions all over the world
     and on all computer systems. Another advantage is that C++ is included
     into gcc! But it is slow and needs 4Mb of RAM or more.  See
     @{"The GNU C compiler" Link "The GNU C compiler"}.  See @{"Mailing lists" Link "Mailing lists"}.

     Commercial C compilers are @{b}Aztec-C@{ub}, @{b}Dice@{ub}, @{b}SAS/C@{ub} amd @{b}MaxonC++@{ub}.  @{b}Aztec-C@{ub}
     doesn't seem to get further development any more.  It should be
     remarked that the commercial compilers have especially wonderful
     debugging utilities (Source level debuggers!) that the others are
     missing.

     SAS has announced to drop support of the Amiga-Compiler, too, due to
     the Amiga's bad situation. However, the compiler is still available
     and up-to-date and has a crosscompiler included, which translates C++
     to C and supports the source level debugger too. Considering the price
     of just 99$ for students and updates from recent versions or other
     compilers it is still the most recommendable of the three. In europe
     the compiler is available from

     Dice is the cheapest and fastest commercial compiler. The greatest
     disadvantage of Dice (compared to the other commercial compilers) is
     the so-called Source-Line-Debugger: This means that you see the
     current line of source and can execute the program step by step, like
     with the other debuggers. On the other hand you can examine memory
     only, not the variables.  To get information about DICE, send email to
     info@oic.COM. An automatic system will return complete details,
     including upgrade prices.

     Comeau C++ is a crosscompiler like SAS/C++. That wouldn't be a
     problem, but Comeau C++ doesn't have a C compiler included.  You need
     SAS/C, Aztec-C or Dice additionally. But it is AT&T cfront 3.0
     compliant and supports exceptions. And like gcc it runs on many
     platforms.  Maxxon C++ is offered in Germany. I cannot say anything on
     it. Both compilers are commercial. Comeau's address is:

     Maxon C++ is both a C++ and a C compiler. There is a light version and
     a developer version. The developer version matches the AT&T standard
     3.0.  Maxon-light includes a compiler and a editor. Developer includes

@{i}Oberon@{ui}
@{i}Oberon-2@{ui}
     Two compilers (both Oberon-2) are available: AmigaOberon (commercial)
     is offered by the same company as M2Amiga. It is integrated into a
     full developers environment and has a large library of modules.
     Library linker and  source level debugger are available.

     Oberon-A is a Freeware compiler. (Source: Aminet, @{b}dev/obero@{ub} directory)
     However, this is a beta release, especially the module library is
     limited. See @{"Mailing lists" Link "Mailing lists"}.

     The AMOK user group supports AmiOberon as well as M2Amiga.

     In addition to these two standalone compilers which are thought mainly
     for creating AmigaOS applications, there is an Amiga port of the
     Oberon Sytem V4, too. The Oberon System is implemented as an
     AmigaOS-Task using a separate screen and includes an Oberon-2
     compiler. You can use it to write software that will work on all
     implementations of the Oberon System V4 (for example Macintosh,
     Windows or Sparc) without any changes.

@{i}Pascal@{ui}
     There is a PD-compiler called PCQ (Directory @{b}dev/lang@{ub} on Aminet or
     Fish disk 511). It doesn't support all of Pascal and major features
     are missing. P2C, a pascal to C converter is on disk 341. (Aminet:
     @{b}/dev/misc/p2c120.lha@{ub}) Additionally there are two commercial compilers
     called HiSoft Pascal and KickPascal. HiSoft Pascal and P2C claim to be
     compatible to Turbo Pascal up to 5.0. HiSoft has a source level
     debugger included.

Those never working Esc sequences!
==================================

   Many printers come with a manual that explains which Esc sequence causes
which action on the printer. But there happen weird things when you try to
send these sequences to your printer, either it does nothing, or it does
something completely different. There is a reason, the Amiga printer
drivers. These drivers are made in a way that they only understand a
certain set of @{b}ANSI Esc sequences@{ub}, not the special ones defined
(differently) by the various printer manufacturers. The purpose is that
every application on the Amiga just uses this one standard set of control
sequences and this way doesn't need to know which printer is actually
connected. The printer driver then translates these standard sequences into
the special sequences a certain printer understands.  A list of the
available ANSI Esc sequences is found in the current Workbench manuals (or
older AmigaDOS manuals). Now if you want to issue a control sequence to the
printer that's not available as an ANSI command, you have two possibilities
to achieve this:
  1. Bypass the printer driver (that would unsuccessfully try to interpret
     the sequence) and send your output @{i}only@{ui} during this sequence to @{b}PAR:@{ub}
     (or @{b}SER:@{ub}, respectively). For this you have to close and open printer
     output channels very often which is rather tedious, and you have to
     know where (@{b}PAR:@{ub} or @{b}SER:@{ub}) your printer is connected.

  2. Use a special ANSI sequence, made exactly for this case:
              @{b}Esc[<n>"<x>@{ub}
     where @{b}<n>@{ub} is the decimally typed number of bytes in the string @{b}<x>@{ub},
     which actually contains your special printer sequence. This ANSI
     sequence tells the printer driver to not interpret or translate the
     next @{b}<n>@{ub} bytes.
        But both methods have one big disadvantage when used in an
application program: You lose the printer independency! If you stick to
ANSI sequen- ces, you can output to any printer on earth, as long as there
is an Amiga printer driver for it. If you start to use special control
sequences, your program will be tied to this single printer model and will
not be usefull for any other (or you would have to provide some dozen new
printer drivers for your application).

Is it possible to use AmigaBasic on the A1200?
==============================================

   AmigaBasic wurde (als einziges Amiga-Programm) von Microsoft entwickelt
und ist entsprechend fehlerhaft.

   Man kann es auf dem A1200 trotzdem zum Laufen bringen, wenn man
folgendes beachtet:

  1. run NoFastMem (or turn off FastMem).

  2. Switch off sound output in the Sound prefs editor.

  3. Better avoid SUBs and use GOSUBs instead, then the compatibility with
     newer processors will be higher.

  4. There is a patch you should run at the beginning of AmigaBasic:
            ---------------------------------- CUT HERE -------------------------------
             `" AmigaBASIC patch to let AmigaBASIC work on A1200 and other newer machines.

How do I localize my program?
=============================

   Suggest, you want to write a @{b}HelloLocalWorld.c@{ub}. Your final program will
look like this:

         #include "HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h"
         #include <clib/exec_protos.h>
     
         struct Library *LocaleBase;
     
         void main(int argc, char *argv[])
     
         {
             /* Open the locale.library. No kill, if not successfull.
                (Just use the builtin catalog strings instead.) Note, that
                we open locale.library here, even if our compiler supports
                AutoOpening.
             */
             LocaleBase = OpenLibrary("locale.library", 38);
             OpenHelloLocalWorldCatalogs(NULL, NULL);
     
             printf(GetString(MSG_Hello));
     
             CloseHelloLocalWorldCatalog();
             if (LocaleBase) CloseLibrary(LocaleBase);
         }

   The routine GetString checks, if the wished catalogs are available and
returns a pointer to either the builtin string or the catalog string. (In
my case the german string.)

   You see, the main difference besides the minor opening and closing stuff
(OpenLibrary, OpenHelloLocalWorldCatalogs, ...) (which too can be dropped,
too, with FlexCat) is to replace strings with a function call. Hence we
need a file @{b}HelloLocalWorld_Cat.c@{ub}, which holds OpenHelloLocalWorld,
GetString, CloseHelloLocalWorld and the builtin strings (this could be an
array, where
             array[MSG_Hello] = "Hello, local world.\n";

is defined) and an include file @{b}HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h@{ub}, which defines the
message ID's like MSG_Hello. You don't need to know, how these files work
internally, especially you don't need to know @{b}locale.library@{ub}!

   There are some catalog generators (in what follows: CGs) available
(@{b}CatComp@{ub}, for devlopers only, @{b}KitCat@{ub}, german docs only, @{b}MakeCat@{ub}, which
I don't know and @{b}FlexCat@{ub}, which I  recommend, because it is most flexible
in the generated source and supports catalogs on 2.0 and any language, even
Amiga-E, Cluster, Pascal, ... and besides that: I'm the author ;-) are
tools, that create  HelloLocalWorld_Cat.h, HelloLocalWorld_Cat.c and the
real catalogs for you. (The above code might differ slightly between the
different CGs.) (See Aminet, directory @{b}dev/misc@{ub}.)

   Of course they need to know how to use them. First create a so-called
@{b}catalog-description@{ub} file. This could look like this:
         ; Lines beginning with a semicolon are comment lines.
         # language english
         ; the language of the builtin strings
         # version 0
         ; the catalog version (0 = any)
         MSG_Hello (1/15/30)
         Hello, local world

Any string is defined by a line like the last two lines above: MSG_Hello is
the message-ID, (1/15/30) says, that the value of MSG_Hello should be 1
(you may omit this, in which case just the next free number is used) and
the string must not be shorter than 15 characters or longer than 30
characters. (These may be omitted too.)

   Now write your program. Once you are ready, use the CGs to create a
so-called catalog translation file. (One for any language different than
the builtin.) In my case (german) this could look like this:
         ; Lines beginning with a semicolon are comment lines.
         ## language deutsch
         ; the catalog language (german)
         ## version $VER: Deutsch.catalog 1.0 (22.12.93)
         ; the catalog files version string
         MSG_Hello
     
         ; Hello, local world

Note the empty line after the message ID. (The arguments of ## language and
## version would be missing as well.) You have to fill in the german strings
here. Again using the CGs you create a catalog file from this. Additionally
note, that no informations on the strings ID or length are behind MSG_Hello.
They are taken from the catalog description file.

   Once you change the program (adding strings, changing the string length)
you change the catalog description as well, use the CGs in the same way to
update the catalog translation and hence the catalogs.

How to obtain a pointer to a console's window

   The following function returns the window pointer of a CON window. It

           if (sp = AllocMem(sizeof (struct StandardPacket),

                 sp->sp_Pkt.dp_Link         = &sp->sp_Msg;
                 sp->sp_Pkt.dp_Port         = mp;
                 sp->sp_Pkt.dp_Type         = ACTION_DISK_INFO;
                 sp->sp_Pkt.dp_Arg1         = MKBADDR(id);
     
                 PutMsg(cfh->fh_Type, &sp->sp_Msg);
                 (void) WaitPort(mp);
                 (void) GetMsg(mp);
     
                 if (sp->sp_Pkt.dp_Res1)
                   w = (struct Window *) id->id_VolumeNode;
     
                 DeletePort(mp);
               }
               FreeMem(id, sizeof (struct InfoData));
             }
             FreeMem(sp, sizeof (struct StandardPacket));
           }
         }
     
         return w;
       }

   Notes:
   @{b}*@{ub} Accessing a console's window directly may interfere with operations
     performed by the CON handler. Be careful!

   @{b}*@{ub} To obtain the window pointer of a CLI's console, pass the FileHandle
     returned by Open("*", MODE_OLDFILE) to the above function.

   @{b}*@{ub} The result of the above function may well be NULL, e.g. in case of an
     AUX handler or if an AUTO CON handler is unable to open its window.

   @{b}*@{ub} Sending an ACTION_DISK_INFO packet to an AUTO CON handler (2.0+)
     causes its window to lose its special AUTO properties (i.e. it can no
     longer be closed at any time by clicking on its Close gadget), as the
     window pointer returned in id_VolumeNode must remain valid from now on.

   @{b}*@{ub} All in all: Don't use this function. :-)

What are pragmas?
=================

   Pragmas are special compiler commmands which control certain features of
a C-compiler. Two problems arise when using pragmas:
  1. Pragmas are compiler specific. You cannot expect that one compiler
     will understand pragmas of another compiler, even if both run on the
     Amiga.

  2. You are not guaranteed that a compiler ignores pragmas, that he
     doesn't understand. Even more: It might not help, to use something like
     this:
              #ifndef MY_COMPILER
              #pragma DoAnything
              #endif

A workaround is to put pragmas in a special include file (BTW, the same
holds true for statements like #asm (Aztec-C) or #extern (C++) and replace
the above with
         #ifndef MY_COMPILER
         #include <mypragmas.h>
         #endif

   But what do pragmas on the Amiga? The most common usage (not the only,
but most meant when talking about pragmas) is to tell the compiler about
how to call library functions: Simple C functions expect their arguments on
the stack, but library functions want their arguments in special processor
registers and additionally the @{b}library base@{ub} in register a6. Lets have a
look at a pragma command of the Aztec-Compiler.
         #pragma amicall(SysBase,0xd2,FreeMem(a1,d0))

This tells the compiler to put the first argument of FreeMem in register
a1, the second in register d0 and the value of the variable SysBase in
register a6. Maxons pragmas look the same, Dice pragmas and SAS pragmas
look a bit more complicated;
         #pragma libcall SysBase FreeMem d2 0902

Here d2 is (like 0xd2 above) the @{b}library vector offset@{ub} (see below), the
digits 09 are codes for the argument register in reversed order (Register
codes are 0=d0, 1=d1, .., 8=a0, 9=a1, a=a2, ..), the following 0 is the
result's registerä(always d0))and the final digit 2 is the number of
arguments.

   A command @{b}FreeMem(fib,sizeof(*fib);@{ub} could produce the following code, if
the compiler has seen a pragma statement like above:
         move.l  _fib,a1
         move.l  260,d1	    ; sizeof(struct FileInfoBlock)
         move.l  _SysBase,a6
         jsr     -0xd2(a6)       ; 0xd2 = _LVOFreeMem

Calling FreeMem in that way is shorter and faster than pushing the
arguments on the stack, calling a function _FreeMem which would do just the
same like the above code by pulling the arguments from the stack.

   The best way to use pragmas is to include statements like the following
in your program:
         /*  SAS/C, Dice and GNU-c (since version 2.6.1) make it	*/
         /*  very simple:						*/
         #if defined(__SASC)  ||  defined(_DCC)  ||  defined(__GNUC__)
           #include <proto/exec.h>
         #else
     
           /*  Get the prototype for the function; note, that this	*/
           /*  is compiler independent.				*/
           #include <clib/exec_protos.h>
     
           /*  Get the pragma; compiler dependent, but most pragmas	*/
           /*  are in files with the same name.			*/
           #ifdef AZTEC_C
             #include <pragmas/exec_lib.h>
           #elif defined(__MAXON__)
             #include <pragmas/exec_pragmas.h>
           #endif
     
           /*  Declare the SysBase variable				*/
           extern struct ExecBase *SysBase;
         #endif

The above example can be compiled on all these compilers and produce the
best code. (Besides, the proto/*.h-files do nothing else than reading
clib/*_protos.h and pragmas/*_pragmas.h with #include and then declare the
SysBase variable.)

   A final question arises: How to get the pragmas? Most compilers have them
included. However, sometimes you want to produce pragmas for yourself, for
example if you are using new libraries or new versions with additional
functions. In that case you can produce them from the so-called @{b}FD@{ub} files
which should be a part of the developer docs of the library. (The NDU has a
directory FD which contains FD files for all libraries and devices of the
OS. see @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}) Most compilers have a utility with the name @{b}fd2pragma@{ub} or
similar included which can do that for you. A freely distributable version
which can produce pragmas for Aztec, Dice, SAS and Maxon as well as LVO
files for assembler and stub routines for the tag versions is available on
Aminet (@{b}dev/misc/fd2pragma2_0.lha@{ub} and on the Fish CDs.

   For pragmas under gcc see @{"Inline Headers" Link "Inline Headers"}.

My Compiler/Linker is complaining about missing symbol xxx.
===========================================================

   First be sure, that the function is really missing: For example floating
point functions are in a special link library and you need a linker option
like @{b}-lm@{ub} to include it into your program. Another possibility would be that
you are using a library function and didn't notice it. This might lead to a
missing library base, @{b}IntuitionBase@{ub} for example. In that case just put
something like
         struct Library *IntuitionBase;

somewhere in the global part of your program. (Don't forget to call
OpenLibrary() and CloseLibrary! :-)

   However, you could as well use a function which really isn't present in
your library at all. If you have, for example, an amiga.lib from 2.0 you
would hardly find the locale functions or the pool memory functions. (1)
Best solution is to get the NDU (see @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}), but you probably don't want
to wait for it. In that case you have to find what kind of function you are
missing.
   @{b}*@{ub} Simple library functions (Examples: @{b}exec/AllocPooled@{ub},
     @{b}locale/OpenCatalogA@{ub}) can be called with pragmas. However, you need
     informations on the name of the library base and where to put the
     arguments. See @{"Pragmas" Link "Pragmas"}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Tag functions are mostly just stub functions which call library
     functions. If you have, for example, @{b}dos/AllocDosObject@{ub} which expects
     a constant and a pointer to an array of tags, you have the varargs
     version @{b}AllocDosObjectTags@{ub} which expects tags on the stack as well!
     Just create the following function:
              #include <clib/dos_protos.h>
              #include <pragmas/dos_pragmas.h>	/*  Probably wrong name */
          
              void *AllocDosObjectTags(ULONG objtype, Tag tag1, ...)
              { return(AllocDosObject(objtype, (struct TagItem *) &tag1);
              }

   @{b}*@{ub} Some functions still remain: Amiga.lib has some functions which are
     really doing valuable things and not just call a library: The BOOPSI
     functions (@{b}DoMethod@{ub}, @{b}DoSuperMethod@{ub}) the memory pool functions

Where do I find the function xxx?
=================================

   If you are not sure about the name of the appropriate function for a
certain job or in which library to find it, you can search in these places:
   @{b}*@{ub} In the Autodocs for each library you find at the very beginning a
     contents table listing all functions available in this library.  They
     are sorted alphabetically, just like in the rest of the Autodocs.  In
     the body part of the Autodocs you find complete explanations and
     specifications for each library function. See @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}.

   @{b}*@{ub} The .FD files also offer a very compact overview over all functions of
     the diverse libraries, complete with a short information about the
     function arguments. If you already know roughly what you search for
     and e.g. only need the precise order of the arguments, you can find
     all needed information here. See @{"Pragmas" Link "Pragmas"}.

Current Version
---------------

   Gcc current version is now 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 is in work.  It does include
a new version of ixemul.library, v40.3, but users are urged to get
ixemul404.lha on Aminet site or my own FTP site, due to errors for 68000
systems. A new library, libnix, avoid using ixemul.library.  2.6.1 will
include protos, like SAS-C, making SASC ports to GCC easier.  A new
assembler, gas-2.5 is included, a package called q_anote enables output of
mixing C/Asm code for debugging purposes.  Work is in progress to implement
stack growing facility, thus avoiding setting stack before launching gcc.

Requirements
------------

   Any Amiga (ranging from A1000 upto A4000/40) will run amigados-gnu
utilities. A minimum of 4MB memory is needed in order to compile
small/medium projects. More memory will be needed for large projects, such
as recompiling gcc itself, or programming C++. Gigamem and VMM do work with
GCC so *maybe* less memory will work. But in this case, an MMU equipped
Amiga (A3000,A4000/40) is necessary.  See @{"68EC0xx" Link "68EC0xx"}.

   A full installation, including C++/ObjC related files, inline headers,
cbm-headers, (see @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}) roughly requires about 20 MB of HD space.

   Support for 1.2/1.3 is dropped. If you have 1.2/1.3, get a better
Kickstart version. Gcc works under KS 1.2/1.3, but the full functionality
is only available under KS 2.x+. A fast CPU (eg. 68030@25MHz or better) is
also of help.

Inline Headers
--------------

   The inline headers for gcc can be created from the original CBM fd files.
See @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}. See @{"Pragmas" Link "Pragmas"}. They can be created as follows:

     CLI> Assign INCLUDE: GCC:os-include
     CLI> Assign FD: INCLUDE:fd
     CLI> Makedir INCLUDE:inline
     CLI> cd USR:bin/geninline
     CLI> gen31

   This will create all inline-headers in @{b}GCC:os-include/inline@{ub}.  If you
have 2.0 headers, use gen20 instead, if you have 3.0, use gen30. OS3.1 (rev
40.13) inline headers are included with the current version of gcc. See
@{"Current Version" Link "Current Version"}.

   NOTE: perl scripts do not handle correctly AmigaDOS include files, which
seems to mean they are somewhat broken. This needs some voluntary work ...

   There is also another way of generating inline headers, using fd2inline
program:

     CLI> fd2inline <fd_file> <proto_file>

Amiga Libraries
---------------

   Starting from this release an AmigaDOS compliant library is provided,
thanks to libnix authors (Matthias Fleischer and Gunther Nikl).

   Anyway if you want to rebuild one, there are two methods:

   1) Using hunk2gcc; the AmigaDOS object converter made by Markus Wild. To
achieve this, simply grab a copy of latest amiga.lib (from Commodore
Development Kit, see @{"Includes" Link "Includes"}) and make a new directory where you want your
converted object files to go, cd into it, and enter

     	hunk2gcc amiga.lib [..further libs if you like..]

   This generates an a.out object file for every program unit present in the
hunk file (in this case, from amiga.lib).

   As the final step convert all those files into an a.out style library by
issuing:

     	ar qc libamiga.a obj.*
     	ranlib libamiga.a

   The ranlib run builds a symbol table in the archive, and makes accesses
to the library much faster.

   2) Creating a libamiga.a library with libnix is fairly easy, but takes
some time. Just uncompress sources.lha from libnix distribution and run a
@{b}make libamiga.a@{ub}.

   @{i}Note:@{ui} As long as you make no AmigaDOS specific calls, you can create a
dummy library using:

       cat "int dummy;" >dummy.c
       gcc -c dummy.c
       ar crv libamiga.a dummy.o
       mv libamiga.a gcc:lib

Installation
------------

  1. If this is your first installation of GCC:

     Do the following:

          cd place_with_lot_of_space      ; EDIT! specify one
          makedir gnu
          lha x gcc260-base.lha           ; first part, you need it

     Now you have to append @{b}gnu/s/user-startup@{ub} to your @{b}s:user-startup@{ub}
     (replace Devel:GNU by your own gnu path).

     Continue:

          execute gnu/s/user-startup      ; makes important assigns
          copy gnu/envarc/#? ENVARC:

     @{i}Edit@{ui} the following lines!  If you have a 68000 or 68010 Amiga, remove
     the "-020" from the following lines wherever it appears!

          lha x gcc260-c-020.lha      ; C-compiler part; you need it
          lha x gcc260-doc.lha        ; only if you want Gcc documentation
          lha x gcc260-c++-020.lha    ; only if you want C++
          lha x gcc260-objc-020.lha   ; only if you want Objective-C
          lha x gcc260-utils.lha      ; only if you want additional utilities
                                      ; (recommended for Unix compatibility)
          lha x gcc260-utilsdoc.lha   ; if you want all utilities documentation

     You must restore links between some programs by running the script
     @{b}restorelinks@{ub}:

          sh /gnu/s/restorelinks      ; EDIT! Append a " copy" to this line
                                      ; if you don't want to use makelink
                                      ; but rather copy file

     Last part:

          lha x gcc260-diffs.lha      ; if you want to rebuild all distribution
          lha x gcc260-texi.lha       ; if you want to build Postscript doc files

     Now skip to next paragraph and happy compiling!

  2. If you "upgrade" your gcc environment from v2.5.x, just unarchive first
     2 archives as it would normally include all what you need (thus
     gcc260-base and gcc260-c). Make sure you delete your previous
     ixemul.library wherever it is (usually LIBS:).


   @{i}Note@{ui}:  new version of ixemul.library is provided, make sure you don't
have another copy somewhere which may conflict with gcc.

Compiling
---------

   What about a nice Hello World ?

     #include <stdio.h>
     
     main()
     {
       printf("Hello World!\n");
     }

   This was pretty simple ;-) Now we have to compile it.  There's a lot of
options in gcc but simplest way to compile this would be:

     CLI> gcc -o hello hello.c

   Simple ?

   Here's more options.

   Target processor for Motorola family: You can compile plain 68000 code,
68020, 68030, 68040, 68881 (have a look at GCC documentation, either in
info or AmigaGuide format, chapter @{b}Invoking Gcc/SubModel Options/M680X0
Options for Motorola specific compilation flags@{ub}).

     CLI> gcc -m68020 -m68881 -o hello hello.c

   This will compile your programs using 68020 code and direct calls to
math-processor, and will link with accelerated libraries, located in
@{b}GCC:lib/lib020@{ub}.

   Optimization: Either you don't want optimization, or you can provide @{b}-O@{ub},
which will optimize your code, or if you really want top optimization, use
@{b}-O2@{ub} flag (for more discussion about optimization, read info or AmigaGuide
doc chapter Invoking Gcc/Optimize Options). There's now even a @{b}-O3@{ub}
optimization option, which will go even further.

     CLI> gcc -O2 -o hello hello.c

   You'll never have a "Hello World" program running so fast ;-)

   Code generation: Perhaps you want to generate resident programs.  Flag
is -resident, at compile and link stage.

     CLI> gcc -resident -o hello hello.c

   Of course you can mix all options, resulting in:

     CLI> gcc -O2 -m68020 -m68881 -resident -o hello hello.c

   This will make a 68020+68881 executable highly optimized and resident.

   IMPORTANT: If you only use AmigaDOS functions or you don't want to use
ixemul for philosophical reasons, you can get rid of ixemul.library with:

     CLI> gcc -noixemul -o foobar foobar.c

   provided you have libnix distribution (included with 2.6.0 distribution).

Text Editors
============

   Text Editors are programs allowing to enter and edit unformatted text.
Generally, this means text that is meant to be manipulated by machine,
rather than human. Programmers use these to enter the text for compilers.
Since UNIX machines don't typically have word processors, most text
processing starts with a text editor, then is filtered through a page layout
system (@{"LaTeX" Link "TeX"}, for example) to produce attractive paper results.

@{i}Commercial Products@{ui}
     CygnusEd Professional and TurboText seem to be the main contenders in
     the professional realm. The Fred Fish disks contain dozens of other
     shareware text editors. A demo version of TurboText is on Fish disk
     445.  A very old demo of CygnusEd is on Fish disk 95 (testament to its
     lasting-power). In the following some freely distributable editors
     will be discussed.

@{i}Emacs@{ui}
     Gnu Emacs (the "G" is not silent) comes from Unix and is probably the
     king of editors - it's huge (about 1 Megabyte), feature-packed (it
     does windows and even contains a game!) and extensible (if you know
     lisp you can write new emacs functions and bind them to any key
     combination).  On the other hand, it may be too huge, its
     feature-ladenness is imposing, and its extensibility often means you
     can't use someone else's emacs configuration. Source: Aminet
     (directory @{b}util/gnu@{ub}).

@{i}Vi@{ui}
     The leaner, less configurable, non-extensible cousin to gnu emacs is vi
     (pronounced "vee eye"). Unix people like vi especially because you
     find it on @{i}any@{ui} Unix machine. What you choose is personal preference,
     and will mark you for life. Vim is a good vi for the amiga, and is on
     Fish disk 591 or in the @{b}util/gnu@{ub} directory of Aminet.

@{i}DME@{ui}
     Many Amiga programmers like DME. It's fast, fully configurable; menus
     may be created and any key may be mapped. It's much easier to learn DME
     than than Emacs or Vi. There are three different versions: AmokEd, DME
     and XDME. It's a matter of opinion which you prefer. (Oberon and Modula
     programmers like AmokEd because it's written in Oberon and supports
     AmigaOberon error messages, C programmers like DME or XDME.) Sources:
     Aminet (directory @{b}util/edit@{ub}), Fish disk 776 (XDME) and 749 (AmokEd),

What word processors are there?
===============================

   A word processor is the typical application for writing notes, letters or
reports on a computer. Unless you prepare newsletters on a weekly basis,
your word procesor is probably your workhorse program. Thus choosing one
you are comfortable with determines how comfortable you are with your
computer. Word processors can offer a variety of features, and many can
approach the sophistication required for Desktop Publishing (see @{"DTP" Link "DTP"}) but
no one uses them for programming, for which text editors are more suited.

   One distinguishes between Wysiwyg programs (What you see is what you get)
and page layout languages. Wysiwyg programs should be fast, comfortable and
easy to use. Most people prefer them. The alternative is an approach that
works similar to compilers. You feed text files to a a program that produces
the layout which may be previewed on screen or printed. LaTeX takes this
approach. See @{"TeX" Link "TeX"}. Lout is another such system which seems smaller, easier
to learn and has full documentation included, but it is nonstandard.  Lout
produces Postscript output. (I don't know if this is an advantage or
disadvantage. ;-) See @{"Postscript" Link "Postscript"}. Both programs are freely distributable.

   There are a lot of wysiwyg programs, but only commercial products:
FinalWriter, Final Copy II, Wordworth, Word Perfect, AmiWrite, Beckertext
II, Maxon Word and many others. I don't dare to recommend any.  All I can
say is: Give yourself time to make a selection.

Desktop Publishing
==================

   These programs offer features lacking in word processors, usually
tailored to flexible arrangement of text, but often don't provide all of
the text manipulation that a good word processor provides. The best desktop
publishing programs strive to provide the features of both, just as the best
word processors strive to provide the features of desktop publishing
programs. Microsoft Word (Mac, PC) is a good example of a word processing
program that offers many page layout feature. Framemaker (UNIX, Macintosh,
DOS, etc.) is an example of a desktop publishing system that offers most
needed word processing functions. As yet, no Amiga program has bridged the
gap, though the main word processors are coming close. (On the other hand,
even many sophisticated programs don't support typesetting mathematics,
tables, producing bibliographies, indexes, or cross-references. The page
layout languages do, and programs like Frame are improving their support of
such features.) Unless you need to prepare fancy newsletters or promotional
literature, a word processing program is probably enough. See
@{"Word Processors" Link "Word Processors"}.

   There are not yet any freely distributable wysiwyg desktop publishing
systems. Commercial products are ProPage and PageStream. They have been
playing leapfrog for the past few years. It appears that PageStream 3.0 is
about to leap ahead. A more detailed description of these products and their
differences is welcome. Both programs' list prices are $299. Student
discounts are available (approx 40% discount.)

What is TeX and where can I get it?
===================================

   TeX is a very powerful wordprocessing system. It can display mathematical
formulas or complex tables as well as function graphs, creates indices,
contents and many other things. Its greatest advantage is that it is freely
distributable (TeX, not the previewers and the printer drivers!) and that
you find TeX all over the world on every computer family. Its greatest
disadvantage is that it isn't very handy (works similar to a compiler) and
it isn't wysiwyg. But many people like it. (BTW: This document is written
using TeX. 8-) See @{"Word Processors" Link "Word Processors"}.

   There are two major implementations on the Amiga. The first one,
Amiga-TeX, from Thomas Rockicki and Radical Eye software is commercial. It
is said to be excellent and his owners seem to be very satisfied. But it
costs at least 200$.

   I recommend PasTeX, a freely distributable version. People seem to have
problems installing PasTeX, especially the font loading and generation
(It's a quite complex program.) but I did not here anyone upset once it was
installed. (A friend with knowledge of TeX helps immensely.) A few words
should be said what you need:
   @{b}*@{ub} 5 disks containing the TeX-compiler itself

   @{b}*@{ub} 2 disks containing MetaFont

   @{b}*@{ub} Nothing more Jörgen Grahn has written a short essay on how he
personally did to make LaTeX work on his Amiga.  It's on Aminet as
@{b}text/tex/UsingLaTeX.lha@{ub}.

   Many people ask for fonts. They are included in the MetaFont-package and
can get compiled by you. All you need to do is setting up your TeX-system
in the right way which is described in the documentation. Please note that
the PasTeX disks are compressed using the program Zoom. (see @{"Endings" Link "Endings"})

Are there any Postscript interpreters?
======================================

   PostScript is a programming language designed to be used to describe
printing on pages. Apple helped make PostScript popular by selling printers
with built in PostScript interpreters. Many programs have evolved to
produce PostScript programs as their output, making PostScript the lingua
franca of printing. Until recently, in order to print a PostScript file,
you had to have a relatively expensive laser printer. The development that
changed this was the software PostScript interpreter. These programs allow
your computer to interpret PostScript programs, and produce the matrix of
dots to send to your normal graphics printer.

   One of the benefits of PostScript is that it is resolution independent.
What this means is that it can support the highest resolution of your device
- and that you can reasonably preview PostScript on a low resolution screen.

   There are two free PostScript interpreters for the Amiga. Post and
Ghostscript. Post comes as an Amiga shared library along with front ends for
previewing to the screen and printing. This structure allows others to write
programs that can show PostScript images on screen. In fact, AmigaTeX uses
Post's library to support incorporation of PostScript into documents.
Ghostscript similarly comes in two programs, but not as a shared library.
Ghostscript is the rendering engine, and Ghostview is the front end.

Font Concepts
=============

   The Amiga is able to use two different concepts of fonts. First of all
there are the bitmap fonts. These fonts are created by drawing a letter
pixel for pixel onto the screen. The advantage is that they look good at
small sizes, but are not very good for printout. Also they don't look
very good when you change their size. Therefore you have to recreate the
font for each size. Second there are the vector fonts. They are created by
curves which are stored as mathematical formula. This has the advantage
that changing the sizes does not effect the output. But this only applies
for larger sizes and print-outs. Vector fonts also use less memory.

Amiga Font Formats
------------------

  1. Agfa IntelliFont (suffix: .type or .lib) is the native font format on
     the Amiga. You can use it in any application and it can be converted
     to the   standard bitmap format using the system utilities @{b}IntelliFont@{ub}
      (OS 3.x) or @{b}Fountain@{ub} (OS 2.x).

  2. Postscript Type 1 fonts can be used within many applications, it can be
      used in every word processor and DTP program. There are two versions
     of   the Type 1 format: Binary and ASCII (suffix: .pfb & .pfa). The
     Amiga   software uses the Binary format, but you can easily convert
     them with   TypeSmith or some PD software products (z.B. PFB2PFA) . In
     Addition to the   files mentioned  above, there are the metrics files
     with the suffixes .afm   or .pfm. They contain information about the
     size (width) of the letters   and most programs expect this file to be
     in the same directory as the font   file.

  3. Postscript Type 3 fonts (suffix: .ps or nothing) are not often used on
      the Amiga, but some applications do support this font format (e.g.
     PageStream). There are also some download utilities from PD sources
     available.

  4. Truetype fonts (suffix: .ttf) are not very common on the Amiga, there
     is one word processor supporting this format (Wordworth 3.0). Due to
     the   lower quality of the format, Amiga users tend to use higher
     quality for   their DTP, DTV and word processing... There are also two
     formats: Mac &   Windows available. The Amiga software is able to use
     the Windows format.

  5. DMF fonts is the privat format of PageStream (suffix: .dmf), since
     PageStream is the market leader in DTP programs on the Amiga, so this
     format is very common!

  6. Bitmap fonts (suffix: .font and numbers in a directory by the name of
     the font, sometimes .otag when converted from IntelliFont) were used
     in the   OS 1.x, but have been replaced by the  superior IntelliFont
     Format in OS   2.0. Under 2.0 or higher you still are able to use the
     bitmap fonts for   small sizes, but for printouts you should use the
     IntelliFont format or   any other vector font format mentioned above.

  7. Colour Bitmap fonts (same suffixes as Bitmap Fonts, but the numbers
     have   in addition a C, e.g. 35C) are also very common on the Amiga,
     they are   mainly used for DTV applications, like the Video Toaster
     and Scala.

Frequently Requested Amiga Fonts
--------------------------------

  1. First place to look for fonts is the AMINET archive. This is the
     biggest     archive of Amiga software and there you will find also
     quite a lot of     fonts. The Aminet consists of many mirrors around
     the world. Here are some     of them:

       1. ftp.wustl.edu,

       2. ftp.luth.se,

       3. ftp.eunet.ch,

       4. ftp.uni-paderborn.de,

       5. ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk.

     Just log in as ftp and go to the directory

     /pub/aminet/text/font.

  2. Another good ftp server to look is the CICA-server:

       1. ftp.cica.indiana.edu


     To this server are also some mirrors around the world available.

  3. Also a good place to look for is the following WWW server:

       1. http://jasper.ora.com/Internet-Font-Archive.html


  4. Another good place is the Fresh Fonts I CD-ROM, there you will almost
       certainly find some nice fonts. The CD is available from

       1. Fred Fish / Amiga Library Services (orders@amigalib.com)

       2. Stefan Ossowski / Schatztruhe GmbH


     The CD is for free when buying another CD from that company.

     You can also access the HTML pages on the CD under the following
     address:

       1. http://macke.gris.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de:4711/~damor/

Commercial Font Sources
-----------------------

   Commercial fonts can be obtained from a number of different companies,
including the large font houses: Adobe, Font Haus, Font Company,
Bitstream, and Monotype. At these companies, fonts cost about $40 for a
single face, and must be purchased in packages. Adobe, Bitstream, and
Monotype also sell pre-designated type collections for slightly lower
prices.

   There are also a lot of PD reseller who have a vast quantity of fonts,
check out your local Amiga magazin for more information.

   Please consult the vendor list for a more complete list of vendors.

Non-Latin fonts on the Amiga
----------------------------

   Due to the really bad information policy by C= there was actually no
information about non-latin fonts. But still it is possible to use them,
without difficulty. You just have to get yourself some additional files.
First of all you need the non-latin font files. There is a large selection
of them on the Fresh Fonts CD-ROM mentioned above. In order to use the
non-latin font files, you have to get yourself the appropriate keymap
file, this will remap the keys on the keyboard to the appropriate letters
of the foreign alphabet, e.g. in order to use a Russian font, you should
set the russian keymap file in the preferences (via PREFS/INPUT).

   Not only that you can write with a non-latin alphabet, you can also
localize   your workbench. How about a Greek workbench or a Hebrew
workbench? Have a   look into the AMINET archive (mentioned above) for
these files!

   In addition to this you can easily use Hebrew & Arabic in any word
processor   incl. writing from right-to-left! This can be easily done by
setting the   kerning value to negative values (like this the cursor moves
left and not   right) and moving the characters into the negativ part! You
can get fonts   from me with this feature!

Amiga Font Installation
-----------------------

   The installation of Postscript, DMF and Truetype fonts is described by
the   application that use them. Please refer to the manuals of the software
 packages.

   The installation of IntelliFonts is very easy. Just start @{b}IntelliFont@{ub}
(OS 3.x) or @{b}Fountain@{ub} (OS 2.x) and follow the guidelines from within   the
program.

   In order to install bitmap fonts, either copy them to the logical device
 FONTS: or assign the directory with your bitmap fonts:

       ASSIGN Fonts: <your_directory> ADD

   Right after this you can start your application and use them. When using
 non-latin fonts, don't forget to set the appropriate keymap file!

Amiga Font Utilities
--------------------

  1. IntelliFont

     IntelliFont is the system program by OS 3.x which lets you install Agfa
      IntelliFonts and converts them to bitmap fonts. The program is
     located in   the drawer @{b}SYS:System/@{ub}. For more information read your
     Workbench 3.x   manual.

  2. Fountain

     Is the preceding program to IntelliFont and comes with the now obsolete
      OS 2.x. Please read the section about Fountain in your Workbench 2.x
      manual.

  3. PFB2PFA

     This neat little utility lets you convert Postscript Binary files to
     Postscript ASCII files. This is needed in order to use DOS & Amiga
     Adobe Type 1 fonts on the Mac!

  4. CacheFont

     This great program caches the fontlist for you, in order to save a huge
      amount of time. The program looks for all fonts available on the
     system   and creates a special cache-file on disk.

  5. TypeSmith

     This is the best font converter on the Amiga, besides this function it
     is   also a full blown font editor (see below) :-). The program is
     able to   convert between:

       1. Truetype

       2. DMF

       3. Adobe (Type 1 & 3)

       4. IntelliFont

       5. Bitmap (Amiga, Adobe, DMF)

Making Outline Fonts
--------------------

   This is very, very difficult. Many people imagine that there are
programs that will simply convert pictures into fonts for them. This is
not the case; most fonts are painstakingly created by drawing curves   that
closely approximate the letterforms. In addition, special rules   (which
improve hinting, etc.) mandate that these curves be drawn in   specific
ways. Even designing, or merely digitizing, a simple font can   take
hundreds of hours.

   The easiest way of learning how to create fonts, is to have a look at
existing fonts and try to change some letters.

   Given that, there are two major programs used for font design on the
Amiga, TypeSmith 2.5 ($150) and FontDesigner ($100). These programs   will
allow you to import scanned images, and then trace them with   drawing
tools.  The programs will then generate Adobe type 1, 3, TrueType,   AGFA
Intellifont, DMF and Bitmap fonts for either the Amiga, the Macintosh   or
the IBM PC. They will also generate automatic hinting. They also open
previously constructed outline fonts, allowing them to be modified, or
converted into another format.

   As far as I know, there are no shareware programs that allows you to
generate outline fonts.

   There are also two programs for creating bitmap fonts. Personal Fonts
Maker and Calligrapher. The second one has not been updated for several
years, but it still is a good tool to work with. The first Program was
created by adding some features to a good bitmap paint program (Personal
Paint).

   There are some shareware tools to create bitmap fonts which you can
convert to outline (vector) fonts with TypeSmith.

Problems and Possible Solutions
-------------------------------

  1. Pagestream does not recognize your newly installed font.

     This happens when you have two fonts with the same ID. The solution is
      to load such a font into a font editor and enter a new ID for one of
     the   fonts. Still it might happen that you choose another one, that
     has already   been used by!

  2. Your application does not find the IntelliFont.

     This happens when you haven't set the locigal device FONTS: to your
     drawer.    You can change this by typing the following command into
     your SHELL or add   this line to your @{b}S:User-Startup@{ub} file:

            ASSIGN Fonts: <your_drawer> ADD

  3. You're using a non-latin font and the wrong characters appear when
     typing.

     This happens when you forget to set the appropriate keymap file. Enter
      the Prefs directory and start the program @{b}INPUT@{ub}. There you can
     choose your keymap file.

   ANS (Amiga Nihongo System) version 1.0, produced by
         SoftHouse Tecnode
         102 Coupo Izumi
         1-4-5 Houya-shi
         Izumi-machi
         Tokyo 202
         JAPAN

and distributed in Japan by MIQ Japan, Ltd. has been released in Japan. It
offers a Japanese environment for Commodore Amiga users, is compatible with
Amiga DOS 2.0 (works fine with version 1.3, too), and requires at least 1MB
RAM (more recommended). ANS features Japanese windows/menus (these replace
the English menus), 12 and 24 dot-matrix Japanese fonts, Jinput/Joutput
(both constitute a Japanese front-end processor), XEDmini (a simple
Japanese text editor with built-in font editor, and can be used as a
Japanese terminal), a kana-to-kanji conversion dictionary for XEDmini and
Jinput, Jfilter (for viewing Japanese files while connected to an MS-DOS
console), and utilities for Japanese code conversion and communication.
Note that XEDmini uses pcj (Japanese version of pcd) for communications,
and that one can do binary uploads/downloads while working on files). I
hear that it is reasonably priced, and very easy to use.

   JemTeX is a preprocessor that turns a Japanese text file (i.e., a TeX
file with Japanese text) into a standard (La/Mu)TeX file.  The archive
(zipped) comes with the jis2mf utility along with a 24-dot bitmapped kanji
font and a program for generating kanji tables. With jis2mf you can make
metafont files out of the bitmapped font. JemTeX v2.0 will compile on an
Amiga using SAS/C, or on a UNIX machine using gcc. This program is available
at the FTP site utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11). JemTeX v2.0 was
written by Francois Jalbert (jalbert@iro.umontreal.ca or jalbert@cs.ubc.ca).

   The following are PD viewers on Aminet (text/show directory)

   JIStoJi by Bart Mathias automatically identifies electronic texts
written in Old-JIS, New-JIS, Shift-JIS, or EUC-JIS (as well as ASCII) and
displays them on screen, or prints them to dot-matrix printers. Will run on
Kickstart 1.3 and up.

   jmore (Japanese more) is basically a more clone that also reads ns-kanji
(Shift-JIS) text. It opens its own hires interlaced screen and requires a
font handler called jFontSys to be running. The archive includes jmore,
jFontsys and the wlook/16 bitmap font.  However, you will also need the
kanji fonts. (Aminet, @{b}text/font/amknj16.lzh@{ub}) All the documentation comes as
Japanese text, so you need a JIS viewer to read the installation
instructions. For your convenience, I have summarized the installation
procedure below:
  1. Place the @{b}wlook/16@{ub} font in your @{b}FONTS:@{ub} directory

  2. Assign @{b}JFONTS:@{ub} to where you unarchive the amknj16 fonts. This need not
     be the same as your @{b}FONTS:@{ub} directory

  3. Place the file @{b}jFont-startup@{ub} in the @{b}S:@{ub} directory

  4. Insert the following line into your @{b}startup-sequence@{ub}:
              run >nil: jFontSys

  5. To use execute the following command
              jmore <japanese.txt>

JISconvert by Dwight Hubbard is a japanese text conversion utility for
Amiga computers. It supports conversion between EUC, New JIS, Old JIS, NEC
JIS and Shift JIS. It also has options to convert half-size katakana to
full size and repair files with ESC characters stripped. No installation
required. Requires AmigaDOS 2.04 or newer.

Chinese text viewers
--------------------

   HZview (by Ji Ma) shows 8-bit Guo Biao encoded chinese text documents.
Requires AmigaDOS v2.1 and above, and cclib.16 bitmap library (included).

   @{i}NOTE@{ui}: This is a pre-release version. What the doc file does not tell you
is that you need to do the following:
  1. Open a default public hires interlaced 1 or 2-bit deep screen

  2. The size of the file to be read is restricted to about 30K (on my
     machine, A1200, WB3.0)

  3. An FPU is required if you want to scroll the text without crashing

  4. The cclib.16 should be in the same directory as the file to be read

Other small bugs still exist which may crash the machine.

Can I run Unix on my Amiga?
===========================

   Actually there are three Unix versions on the Amiga. All of them need at
least 68030 (see @{"MMU" Link "68EC0xx"}), probably a 68040 in the near future and seem to have
problems with many hard-drive-controllers. You should have a good look into
the documentation before installing it. Unix needs much resources, say at
least 10Mb RAM and a 150Mb Unix-partition on the hard-drive.

  1. Commodore offered a System V Unix in the past. It contained TCP/IP,
     X11 and other software and seemed to make a good job, but it was
     expensive and after all Commodore has dropped developing it.
     Commodore-Unix needs a streamer because it is distributed on tapes.

  2. A Linux port is prepared. But actually there is not very much than the
     kernel. Specialists might like to use it, but it cannot be recommended
     for now. Linux is freely distributable. Sources: @{b}ftp.tsx-11.mit.edu@{ub} or
     @{b}ftp.uni-erlangen.de@{ub}, both directory @{b}/pub/Linux/MIRROR.tsx-11/680x0@{ub}.
     Or @{b}ftp.leo.org@{ub}, directory @{b}/pub/comp/os/linux/680x0@{ub}.

  3. NetBSD is freely distributable too. Like Linux it isn't ready for now,
     but it seems to make big steps. Most GNU software is said to run,
     especially emacs and gcc. I think it's worth to have a look on it.

How to mount MsDos-formatted Syquests on Amiga
==============================================

   To mount a MSDos-formatted Syquest on Amiga, you need with an (DOSen)
Adaptec-Controller the following Mount-entry in @{b}DEVS:Mountlist@{ub}: If your
medium does have more than one partition, you need to copy the following
Mount-Entry for every partition and give each partition another name (eg.
SyC:, SyD:, SyE:, etc.) You don't need to change LowCyl and HighCyl for
each partition; CrossDOSFileSystem does that automatically.

     SyC:   /* SyD:, SyE:, etc. */
             Filesystem      = L:CrossDOSFileSystem
             Device          = scsi.device
             Unit            = 2
             Flags           = 1
             Surfaces        = 1
             BlocksPerTrack  = 1
             BlockSize       = 512
             Reserved        = 1
             Interleave      = 0
             LowCyl          = 0
             HighCyl         = 524287
             Buffers         = 128
             BufMemType      = 0
             Stacksize       = 4000
             Priority        = 5
             GlobVec         = -1
             DosType         = 0x4D534800
             Activate        = 1
     #

   For different (DOSen) controllers this entry should work, too, but maybe
you have to adjust it. When inserted, the Syquest-270MB medium is (in this
case) automatically mounted (as drive SyC:) and can be used with help of the
CrossDOS-Filesystem as usual.

What are files ending with ...?
===============================

   Most endings on FTP sites or Fish disks tell you that the file is
compressed and/or is an archive containing more than one file. Some
programs even archive whole disks. Frequently found endings and programs to
handle the related files are:
@{i}.sfx@{ui}
     Compressed archives which are included in an executable program: Just
     call the program and it will extract itself (sfx = self extract)

@{i}.lha@{ui}
@{i}.lzh@{ui}
     Compressed archives; recommended: LhA (@{b}util/arc/LhA_e138.run@{ub} on Aminet
     or Fish disk 715) or Lx (@{b}util/arc/lx100.lha@{ub} on Aminet), Unix version
     available (@{b}misc/unix/lha-1.00.tar.Z@{ub})

@{i}.dms@{ui}
     Disks compressed using DMS (@{b}util/arc/dms111.sfx@{ub} on Aminet or Fish disk
     406)

@{i}.zom@{ui}
     Disks compressed using Zoom (@{b}util/arc/Zoom_5.4.lha@{ub} on Aminet, Fish
     disk 682); an older version which you probably need for uncompressing
     PasTeX is found on Fish disk 459.

@{i}.zoo@{ui}
     Compressed archive; recommended: Zoo (@{b}util/arc/zpp2-10.lzh@{ub} on Aminet
     or Fish disk 527)

@{i}.Z@{ui}
@{i}.z@{ui}
@{i}.gz@{ui}
     Compressed files; recommended gzip (@{b}util/pack/gzip124x.lha@{ub} on Aminet),
     note that this are Unix files in most cases

@{i}.tar@{ui}
     Acrhive; recommended: tar (@{b}util/arc/tar.lha@{ub} or @{b}util/arc/gtar10.lha@{ub} on
     Aminet or Fish disk 445), note that tar is a Unix archiver and you
     often find soething like @{b}.tar.Z@{ub}.

@{i}.arj@{ui}
     Compressed archive; recommended unarj (@{b}util/arc/unarj-0.5.lha@{ub} on

Is there a Stacker-like utility to pack my hard drive?
======================================================

   XFH does a good job. It operates as a handler and uses the XPK-libraries,
so you have different compression modes (RAKE is a good choice) and possibly
even more in the future. The only disadvantage is, that the size of a file
is limited by RAM: Don't use it with less than 2MB of RAM.

   XPKDisk by Olaf 'Rhialto' Seibert is another stacker program that takes
advantage of the variety of XPK libraries available. Unlike other harddisk
compressors it does not compress the files, but creates a pseudo partition
and stores the whole tracks as compressed files on your harddisk. Its major
advantage is that it does not limit the maximum file size, because it works
similar to trackdisk.device and therefore does not need too much temporary
storage.

   But be careful if you want to use ReOrg on a comprimized partition:
ReOrg should be set to leave enough memory for the xpkdisk buffers.  And
because of ReOrgs buffering, you can use few buffers for xpkdisk (perhaps
as few as 2 or 3). Don't use ReOrg if you don't know the memory needs of
XFH or XPKDisk.

   Another possibility is EPU. It's shareware and should offer the same as
XFH, but without limiting the file size.

Where do I get Fish disk xxx?
=============================

   Those FTP servers have that much space (or a CD-Rom) to have all fish
disks available online:
     ftp.isca.uiowa.edu      (USA, directory @{b}/amiga/fx/fxxx@{ub})
     ftp.hawaii.edu          (USA, directory @{b}/pub/amiga/fish@{ub})
     ftp.funet.fi            (Finland, directory @{b}/pub/amiga/fish@{ub})

Note that the CD-Rom's are not always mounted. See @{"FTP" Link "FTP"}.

   Another possibility would be to ask your local dealer. :-)

Getting files from a FTP server
===============================

   Things are easy for those who have access to the Internet and a program
called FTP (File Transfer Program). Nearly all Unix computers have it, but
not all of them allow the use of FTP.

   FTP allows you to gain access to some other machines and store and/or
retrieve files. Normally one needs an acoount on the remote machine to use
it, bat a number of machines have a setup that allows everybody to log in
as the user @{b}ftp@{ub} or @{b}anonymous@{ub}, so anybody may get files from them. The most
important of this servers are the Aminet servers, which mirror each other
and hence should have the same files. They are the best choice if you are
looking for Amiga software. Aminet hosts are

   All these mirrors have a directory @{b}/pub/aminet@{ub}, where you will find much
stuff. Please use a mirror close to you! Some other important hosts are
     ftp.funet.fi             (Finland)
     ftp.isca.uiowa.edu       (USA)
     ftp.hawaii.edu           (USA)
     ftp.cso.uiuc.edu         (USA)
     ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de   (Germany)
   Note that grind, aachen and erlangen have the full collection of Fish
disks available! See @{"Fish disk xxx" Link "Fish disk xxx"}.  If you don't find a specific file on
your local mirror, try @{b}ftp.wustl.edu@{ub}, @{b}ftp.uni-paderborn.de@{ub} or
@{b}ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk@{ub}; they keep all files.

   To connect to a special host (ftp.uni-erlangen.de for example), you
should type
     ftp ftp.uni-erlangen.de

The host answers by requesting your login. You should type
     ftp

No you are asked for a password. Please type your Email address here, if
you have one. If not, use the password ftp.

   Now you're inside the host. There is a number of commands you may execute
here. The most important are:
@{i}?@{ui}
     Prints the help text of the FTP command. Additionally you may type @{i}?
     command@{ui} to get information on a special command.

@{i}bin@{ui}
     Tells the FTP program that you whish to transfer binary files. It is
     always a good choice to type bin as the very first command! Files you
     load without the bin command can be corrupt.

@{i}get <file>@{ui}
     Loads the given file from the host. On most Unix machines you can type
     something like @{b}get file.txt -@{ub} or @{b}get file.txt |more@{ub} to show a text on
     the screen. Note that there @{i}must not@{ui} be any blank between the | and
     the word more!

@{i}mget <pat>@{ui}
     Loads the given files. pat may contain Unix style like wildcards.

@{i}put <file>@{ui}
@{i}mput <pat>@{ui}
     Like get and mget, but transfer files from you to the remote host. This
     is in most cases not allowed, except for a special directory called
     @{b}incoming@{ub}. You can place files here which you want to make public.

@{i}cd <dir>@{ui}
     Like the usual cd command. The commands get, mget, put, mput, dir and
     ls refer to the current working directory.

@{i}dir [<dir>]@{ui}
@{i}ls [<dir>]@{ui}
     Like @{b}list@{ub} and @{b}dir@{ub} on the Amiga. Note that the FTP-dir corresponds to
     the Amiga-list!

@{i}bye@{ui}
     Leaves the FTP program.

   When you have used FTP for the first times you will notice, that you
always begin with executing the same steps:
  1. Type the login (ftp in most cases)

  2. Type the password (your mail address in most cases)

  3. Enter the bin command

  4. Change the current working directory (@{b}/pub/aminet@{ub} for example)
        This may get executed automatically. What you need is a file called
@{b}.netrc@{ub} in your home directory. Note that it needs to be protected against
others! The FTP program doesn't use it, if it can be read by anything else
than you. (Protection is set using the command @{b}chmod go-rwx .netrc@{ub}.) The
.netrc file contains some entries for your most favourite FTP sites, each
separated by empy lines. A typicel entry may look like this:
     machine ftp.uni-erlangen.de
     login ftp
     password <your mail address> or <ftp>
     macdef init
         bin
         cd pub/aminet
   Note that on some machines it is possible to use the machine name
@{b}default@{ub} which meets all machines not listed in .netrc.

Getting files from a Mail server
================================

   Another way to get files is to use a mail server. This assumes that you
can send mail to Internet addresses and get mail from Internet hosts. It
works by sending a mail to the server specifying some commands, for example
send commands for the files you want. Important mail servers are
     ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
     mailserver@nic.funet.fi
     mailserver@leo.org
     mrcserv@janus.mtroyal.ab.ca
     mail-server@ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de
     mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
     ftp-mail@uni-paderborn.de

The most important commands are:
@{i}Help@{ui}
     Tells the server that you wish to get an Ascii file containing detailed
     explanation how to use the server.

@{i}Limit <number>@{ui}
     Specifys that you wish to get not more than <number> Kbytes per mail.
     Larger files get splitted into small pieces of at most <number> Kbytes
     which are sent as separate mails each. Note that the mails may get
     larger because of overhead.

@{i}Cwd <dir>@{ui}
     Sets the current working directory to <dir>. This directory is used by
     the commands send and dir.

@{i}Index@{ui}
     will return a list of files and/or directories that the server offers.
     Note that this may be @{i}very@{ui} large!

@{i}Index <item>@{ui}
     returns a list of files containing <item> in their names.

@{i}Dir [<dir>]@{ui}
     returns a list of the files and directories in the given directory.

@{i}Send <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>@{ui}
     Tells the server to send the given files to you.

@{i}Begin@{ui}
     Tells the server to ignore all lines above this command.

@{i}End@{ui}
     Like Begin, but specifies to ignore the lines below. (A signature for
     example!) A typical session would be to send the following mail to the
mail server:
     BEGIN
     CD /pub/aminet/util/arc
     SEND LhA_e138.run
     END

Getting files from a mailbox
============================

   You also can get files from one of the many BBS's (@{b}Bulletin Board
System@{ub}).  Most of these are driven by private users, so there is
nearly everywhere a mailbox which doesn't cause a too expensive telephone
bill.

   I want to publish a list of all Amiga mailboxes here.  So please send to
me a list of all mailboxes which are related to the Amiga - in any way.  I
need all telephone numbers of the boxes and their name.  Tell me the nation
where the box resides and - if possible - some more info (Does the box have
Aminet or the Fish PD or FRAS?  Is the box especially for Amiga users?)

   Thanks, Ignaz Kellerer

   For a list of mailboxes in Germany or Austria or Switzerland, look at the
German version of the AmigaFAQ.

The Amiga Library disks
-----------------------

   Fred Fish has started in the middle eighties to collect freely
distributable software on floppy disks. There are 1000 disks and very much
good stuff on it.  Most Amiga dealers sell them and most magazines contain
addresses of people mailing them to you for about 3$ per disk or less.
Fred Fish has terminated offering software on floppy disks.  Instead, there
is a dealer who offers the new software from the CD-Roms on floppy disks.

   There are some things which can be found on the Fish disks, but not on
Aminet.  However, you can get them with FTP. See @{"Fish disk xxx" Link "Fish disk xxx"}.

The Fresh Fish CD-Roms
----------------------

   Fred Fish is going on to offer freely distributable software. But now he
collects it on CD-Rom's. He releases two different kinds of CD's:
  1. Monthly released disks are divided into roughly three sections:
       1. New material, which includes the material from the new unreleased
          floppy disks as well as material which does not appear in the
          floppy distribution, about 84Mb on the first disk.

       2. Useful utilities that can be used directly off the CD-ROM if
          desired, thus freeing up the corresponding amount of hard disk
          space (GNU Emacs, Gnu C, GNU C++, Amiga E, PasTeX, AmigaGuide,
          Installer, 2.0 and 3.0-Includes, different archivers, tape
          drivers, the AmiCDROM filesystem and many other GNU and BSD
          tools, ...), about 150Mb on the first disk.

       3. Older material from previous released floppy disks or CD-ROM's,
          about 404 Mb on the first disk. (Fish disk 600-910)

  2. Disks containing the latest software as well as recent software in
     packed format only. (These are intended to be used for example in
     BBS's.)
        I recommend especially the first kind of Fish CD's. They cost about
20$ plus 3$ for shipping (5$ outside USA/Canada/Mexico) and are available
from

How do I Read and write MS-Dos disks?
=====================================

   No problem for owners of Workbench 2.1 or higher: The program CrossDos is
part of the Workbench. All you have to do is mounting the device @{b}pc0:@{ub} by
putting it into the drawer @{b}Devs:DOSDrivers@{ub} or by double-clicking the icon
in @{b}Sys:Storage/DOSDrivers@{ub}. Ms-Dos disks in drive @{b}df0:@{ub} can now be handled in
the usual manner replacing the word @{b}df0:@{ub} by @{b}pc0:@{ub}. For example the directory
can be shown with the command @{i}dir pc0:@{ui}.

   People still running Workbench 2.0 or lower need a program called @{b}MSH@{ub}.
You will find this on the Aminet (directory misc/emu) and on Fish disk 382.
See @{"Sources" Link "Sources"}. After editing the file @{b}devs:MountList@{ub} as described in the
documentation you have to say @{i}Mount msh:@{ui} in the CLI and can now do the same
as above replacing the word @{b}pc0:@{ub} with @{b}msh:@{ub}.

How do I split large files?
===========================

   There are some archives which are too large to fit on one disk. To
transfer them on disks you need to split them into smaller pieces and
transfer each part on a separate disk. I recommend Martin Schlodder's
@{b}Splitter@{ub}.  (Aminet, @{b}util/misc/splitter_121.lha@{ub}. The archive contains
binaries for MS-DOS and should be compilable without problems on any Unix
system.

Discussing things
=================

   A mailing list is a server that allows to discuss special things via
Email. The server holds a list of people that are interested in the
respective topic. For example, the gcc mailing list will discuss bugs, new
features and other problems of gcc. (see @{"Compilers" Link "Compilers"}) If a mail is sent to
the server from someone he will forward this mail to all the other people
on the list.

   You will be added to the list by sending a mail to the server which will
usually contain the word @{b}Subscribe@{ub} or something similar. Once you are no
more interested in the mailing list you can unsubscribe.

   Unforunately the servers have a different syntax of subscribing and
unsubscribing. The best way to find how to subscribe is to send a mail with
the word @{b}Help@{ub} to the server. He will reply a mail which should explain how
to handle this special server.

   Some mailing lists are:
     Topic           Server
     
     Amok            listserv@amokle.stgt.sub.org

@{i}Amiga Networking FAQ@{ui}
     Unlike the AmiTCP/IP FAQ this one wants to cover all aspects of
     networking, including TCP/IP and Envoy.  Newsgroups:
     comp.sys.amiga.datacomm, comp.sys.amiga.hardware Ftp: rtfm.mit.edu,
     pub/usenet/comp.sys.amiga.networking Maintainer: Richard Norman
     (norman@afas.msfc.nasa.gov)

@{i}Point Manager FAQ@{ui}
     Networking seems to be quite a problem: This FAQ os for Point Manager,
     a FidoNet-client (so-called points).  Newsgroups:
     comp.sys.amiga.datacomm Ftp: rtfm.mit.edu,
     pub/usenet/comp.sys.amiga.datacomm Maintainer: Eric Krieger
     (pm_faq@quasar.hacktic.nl)

@{i}All about FTP@{ui}
     Explains the usage of the file transfer program FTP. See @{"FTP" Link "FTP"}.
     Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.misc (monthly) Ftp: Aminet, info/start

The Amiga-FAQ archive
*********************

   The Amiga-FAQ is available in different formats: Ascii format (which is
posted to the nets) AmigaGuide format (which is the adequate format on the
Amiga) and in dvi format (to be printed). Additionally there is some stuff,
that might be useful or interesting, but could not be included into the
Amiga-FAQ:
     txt/amiga.history       On the Amiga's history
     txt/story.txt           The Commodore story (or: the Tramiel
                             story ;-)
     txt/amiga.newsgroups    Overview on comp.sys.amiga.*
     txt/amiga.sites         List of FTP sites
     txt/AmigaOverview.tex   A short overview on the Amiga-Soft- and
                             Hardware
     txt/Hardware.tips       For those people who can't live without solder
     src/JWSplit.c           The source of a file splitter
     src/JWJoin.c            The opponent to JWSplit
     src/addtoc.c            Utility to add a toc to texinfo-created docs
                             (this document uses it)
     programmers/*           Some stuff for programmers: pragmas, vararg
                             versions of some tag functions and some
                             amiga.lib functions (HookEntry, DoMethod)

   I decided to collect these in the Amiga-FAQ archive. It is called
AmigaFAQ.lha and can be found on Aminet, directory @{b}docs/misc@{ub}.

Contributions
*************

   This FAQ can neither get useful nor hit further development without your
help. Suggestions, contributions, new answers, critics, anything is rather
welcome.

   Please note, that very major subjects are absolutely missing yet: Nothing
about sound, nothing on graphic cards, no Animation. These are some of the
Amiga's best points! But I don't know them ... :-(

   So grab your keyboard (Your pencil? Well, if there's no other way...)
and send mail to:
