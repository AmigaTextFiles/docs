A mailing list is a server that allows to discuss special things via
Email. The server holds a list of people that are interested in the
respective topic. For example, the gcc mailing list will discuss bugs,
new features and other problems of gcc. (see  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_29.html#SEC29">What compilers (assemblers) are there?</A>) If a mail is
sent to the server from someone he will forward this mail to all the
other people on the list.
<P>
You will be added to the list by sending a mail to the server which will
usually contain the word <SAMP>`Subscribe'</SAMP> or something similar. Once you
are no more interested in the mailing list you can unsubscribe.
<P>
Unforunately the servers have a different syntax of subscribing and
unsubscribing. The best way to find how to subscribe is to send a mail
with the word <SAMP>`Help'</SAMP> to the server. He will reply a mail which
should explain how to handle this special server.
<P>
Some mailing lists are:
