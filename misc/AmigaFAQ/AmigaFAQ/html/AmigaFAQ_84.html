Fred Fish is going on to offer freely distributable software. But now he
collects it on CD-Rom's. He releases two different kinds of CD's:
<OL>
<LI>Monthly released disks are divided into roughly three sections:
<OL>
<LI>New material, which includes the material from the new unreleased floppy
disks as well as material which does not appear in the floppy distribution,
about 84Mb on the first disk.
<LI>Useful utilities that can be used directly off the CD-ROM if desired,
thus freeing up the corresponding amount of hard disk space (GNU Emacs,
Gnu C, GNU C++, Amiga E, PasTeX, AmigaGuide, Installer, 2.0 and
3.0-Includes, different archivers, tape drivers, the AmiCDROM filesystem
and many other GNU and BSD tools, ...), about 150Mb on the first disk.
<LI>Older material from previous released floppy disks or CD-ROM's, about
404 Mb on the first disk. (Fish disk 600-910)
</OL>
<LI>Disks containing the latest software as well as recent software in
packed format only. (These are intended to be used for example in BBS's.)
</OL>
I recommend especially the first kind of Fish CD's. They cost about 20$ plus
3$ for shipping (5$ outside USA/Canada/Mexico) and are available from
