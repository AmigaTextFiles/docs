If you are not sure about the name of the appropriate function for a
certain job or in which library to find it, you can search in these places:
<UL>
<LI>In the Autodocs for each library you find at the very beginning a
contents table listing all functions available in this library.
They are sorted alphabetically, just like in the rest of the Autodocs.
In the body part of the Autodocs you find complete explanations and
specifications for each library function. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_27.html#SEC27">Where do I get the Amiga includes?</A>.
<LI>The .FD files also offer a very compact overview over all functions
of the diverse libraries, complete with a short information about the
function arguments. If you already know roughly what you search for
and e.g. only need the precise order of the arguments, you can find
all needed information here. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_34.html#SEC34">What are pragmas?</A>.
