These programs offer features lacking in word processors, usually
tailored to flexible arrangement of text, but often don't provide all of
the text manipulation that a good word processor provides. The best desktop
publishing programs strive to provide the features of both, just as the best
word processors strive to provide the features of desktop publishing
programs. Microsoft Word (Mac, PC) is a good example of a word processing
program that offers many page layout feature. Framemaker (UNIX, Macintosh,
DOS, etc.) is an example of a desktop publishing system that offers most
needed word processing functions. As yet, no Amiga program has bridged the
gap, though the main word processors are coming close. (On the other hand,
even many sophisticated programs don't support typesetting mathematics,
tables, producing bibliographies, indexes, or cross-references. The page
layout languages do, and programs like Frame are improving their support of
such features.) Unless you need to prepare fancy newsletters or promotional
literature, a word processing program is probably enough. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_49.html#SEC49">What word processors are there?</A>.
<P>
There are not yet any freely distributable wysiwyg desktop publishing
systems. Commercial products are ProPage and PageStream. They have been
playing leapfrog for the past few years. It appears that PageStream 3.0 is
about to leap ahead. A more detailed description of these products and their
differences is welcome. Both programs' list prices are $299. Student
discounts are available (approx 40% discount.)
