<LI>Agfa IntelliFont (suffix: .type or .lib) is the native font format on
  the Amiga. You can use it in any application and it can be converted to the
  standard bitmap format using the system utilities <TT>`IntelliFont'</TT>
  (OS 3.x) or <TT>`Fountain'</TT> (OS 2.x).
<P>
<LI>Postscript Type 1 fonts can be used within many applications, it can be
  used in every word processor and DTP program. There are two versions of
  the Type 1 format: Binary and ASCII (suffix: .pfb &#38; .pfa). The Amiga
  software uses the Binary format, but you can easily convert them with
  TypeSmith or some PD software products (z.B. PFB2PFA) . In Addition to the
  files mentioned  above, there are the metrics files with the suffixes .afm
  or .pfm. They contain information about the size (width) of the letters
  and most programs expect this file to be in the same directory as the font
  file.
<P>
<LI>Postscript Type 3 fonts (suffix: .ps or nothing) are not often used on
  the Amiga, but some applications do support this font format (e.g.
  PageStream). There are also some download utilities from PD sources
  available.
<P>
<LI>Truetype fonts (suffix: .ttf) are not very common on the Amiga, there
  is one word processor supporting this format (Wordworth 3.0). Due to the
  lower quality of the format, Amiga users tend to use higher quality for
  their DTP, DTV and word processing... There are also two formats: Mac &#38;
  Windows available. The Amiga software is able to use the Windows format.
<P>
<LI>DMF fonts is the privat format of PageStream (suffix: .dmf), since
  PageStream is the market leader in DTP programs on the Amiga, so this
  format is very common!
<P>
<LI>Bitmap fonts (suffix: .font and numbers in a directory by the name of
  the font, sometimes .otag when converted from IntelliFont) were used in the
  OS 1.x, but have been replaced by the  superior IntelliFont Format in OS
  2.0. Under 2.0 or higher you still are able to use the bitmap fonts for
  small sizes, but for printouts you should use the IntelliFont format or
  any other vector font format mentioned above.
<P>
<LI>Colour Bitmap fonts (same suffixes as Bitmap Fonts, but the numbers have
  in addition a C, e.g. 35C) are also very common on the Amiga, they are
  mainly used for DTV applications, like the Video Toaster and Scala.
