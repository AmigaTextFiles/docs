You also can get files from one of the many BBS's (<CODE>Bulletin Board System</CODE>).
Most of these are driven by private users, so there is nearly everywhere
a mailbox which doesn't cause a too expensive telephone bill.
<P>
I want to publish a list of all Amiga mailboxes here.
So please send to me a list of all mailboxes which are related to the Amiga - in any way.
I need all telephone numbers of the boxes and their name.
Tell me the nation where the box resides and - if possible - some more info
(Does the box have Aminet or the Fish PD or FRAS?
Is the box especially for Amiga users?)
<P>
Thanks, Ignaz Kellerer
<P>
For a list of mailboxes in Germany or Austria or Switzerland, look at the
German version of the AmigaFAQ.
