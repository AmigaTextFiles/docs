experienced users don't like to read anymore.

The author gives <STRONG>absolutely no</STRONG> warranty that the answers given
here are correct. Many of them were contributed by other users and I
cannot even make marginal checks. If you think that something should be
changed, please tell me. Suggestions, contributions, new answers, critics,
flames (oh, how I like this <TT>`nil:'</TT> :-) are rather welcome.
<P>
Please notice that there are many questions that aren't answered yet,
even more: Whole sections that remain empty! I feel that I cannot give
satisfying answers. So it's your turn: Fill the gaps and tell me what i
should include into this document!
