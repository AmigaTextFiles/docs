Gcc current version is now 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 is in work.
It does include a new version of ixemul.library, v40.3, but users are urged
to get ixemul404.lha on Aminet site or my own FTP site, due to errors
for 68000 systems. A new library, libnix, avoid using ixemul.library.
2.6.1 will include protos, like SAS-C, making SASC ports to GCC easier.
A new assembler, gas-2.5 is included, a package called q_anote
enables output of mixing C/Asm code for debugging purposes.
Work is in progress to implement stack growing facility, thus avoiding
setting stack before launching gcc.
