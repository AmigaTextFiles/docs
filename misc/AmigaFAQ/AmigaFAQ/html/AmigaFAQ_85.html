No problem for owners of Workbench 2.1 or higher: The program CrossDos is
part of the Workbench. All you have to do is mounting the device <TT>`pc0:'</TT>
by putting it into the drawer <TT>`Devs:DOSDrivers'</TT> or by double-clicking
the icon in <TT>`Sys:Storage/DOSDrivers'</TT>. Ms-Dos disks in drive <TT>`df0:'</TT>
can now be handled in the usual manner replacing the word <TT>`df0:'</TT> by
<TT>`pc0:'</TT>. For example the directory can be shown with the command
<TT>dir pc0:</TT>.
<P>
People still running Workbench 2.0 or lower need a program called <CODE>MSH</CODE>.
You will find this on the Aminet (directory misc/emu) and on Fish disk 382.
See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_76.html#SEC76">Where and how do I get software and other informations?</A>. After editing the file <TT>`devs:MountList'</TT> as described in
the documentation you have to say <TT>Mount msh:</TT> in the CLI and can now do
the same as above replacing the word <TT>`pc0:'</TT> with <TT>`msh:'</TT>.
