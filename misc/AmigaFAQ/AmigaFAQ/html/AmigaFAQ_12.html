First, make sure <TT>`PIPE:'</TT> is mounted. You can do this by giving the
command
<PRE>
    1&#62; Mount PIPE:
</PRE>
in a Shell window. On an AmigaOS 2.1+ system, <TT>`PIPE:'</TT> is normally
mounted on startup by placing the mount entry file <TT>`PIPE'</TT> in the
drawer <TT>`DEVS:DosDrivers'</TT>.
<P>
In an AmigaShell window, give the commands:
<PRE>
    1&#62; Run List SYS: &#62;PIPE:Listoutput
    1&#62; More &#60;PIPE:Listoutput
</PRE>
<A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="AmigaFAQ_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>
<P>
These two commands list the contents of the <TT>`SYS:'</TT> volume to a pipe
and then type it in the Shell window. You could also use:
<PRE>
    1&#62; Run List SYS: NOHEAD &#62;PIPE:Listoutput
    1&#62; Run Sort PIPE:Listoutput PIPE:Sortedoutput
    1&#62; More &#60;PIPE:Sortedoutput
</PRE>
Notice that you need to `Run' all the programs except for the last
one. This is so that you can get them all running simultaneously. You
could also use several Shell windows, or any other way of running all
the programs at the same time. Also this might not work if <TT>`More'</TT>
isn't the standard Commodore AmigaOS 2.04+ More found in
<TT>`SYS:Utilities'</TT>.
<P>
In case you need to manually flush a pipe, for example because the
program that was reading from it aborts prematurely, it can be done
with the command:
<PRE>
    1&#62; Type PIPE:name TO NIL:
</PRE>
