Many people would prefer to use a 3.5" instead of the smaller 2.5"
drives as the former are much cheaper. This is possible, but you need
a special cable to connect the drive to your IDE controller. Additionally
you should put some isolating material between the drive and the main
board. Some people report termic problems but I did not notice
anything.
<P>
Some dealers offer a set which contains the cable, isolating material
and for about 20$. See the magazines for more information.

If you are going to install an IDE-harddisk, regardless if 2.5" or
3.5", you should always consider that the it may not work flawlessly,
if the drive and ROM-version have not been tested and approved by
Commodore. Regarding the A1200, one should also remember that this
Amiga has not been designed to hold 3.5" harddisk drives. The 2.5"
drives, which are mainly thought for portable computers, may have
some advantages (for example in power consumption, heat emission or
shock resistance) that could pay off because of the small keyboard
case of the A1200 and the limited power supply. With the larger 3.5"
drives, ventilation inside the computer might also be disturbed. If
it is necessary to remove some shielding inside the A1200 to make the
drive fit inside, even radio interference may occur.
<P>
To sum it up: if 3.5" harddisk drives could really be used in the
A1200 without any problems, you could be sure Commodore themselves
wouldn't have used the slightly more expensive 2.5" drives in the
A1200-HD.
