<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG>
<DD>When I try the command <SAMP>`List SYS: | More'</SAMP> I get an error
<PRE>
    PIPE: Unknown command
</PRE>
I have <TT>`PIPE:'</TT> mounted, what's wrong?
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>AmigaShell is referring to the command <CODE>Pipe</CODE> in the error, not the
<TT>`PIPE:'</TT> device. You haven't installed the commands in the ShellTools
archive.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG>
<DD>I get a requester that says
<PRE>
    Please insert volume PIPE: in any drive
</PRE>
when I try any of the command examples.
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD><TT>`PIPE:'</TT> is not mounted. Try <SAMP>`Mount PIPE:'</SAMP>. If that doesn't work,
refer to your AmigaDOS manual or a friend that knows how to mount
devices.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG>
<DD>When I try any of the examples the More window pops up but nothing
is shown/I get an error afterwards/More pops up a file requester.
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>You are not using the standard AmigaOS <CODE>More</CODE> command. Either use
another name or install a command that supports pipes.
Possibilities are the C= More, Less, or Most for example.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG>
<DD>With use of PIPE:, sometimes characters get lost. What happened?
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>Up to OS 3.1, the queue-handler has some bugs which don't allow
a really foolproof transmission of data.
A compatible replacement for the queue-handler can be founbd on
Aminet, <TT>`util/sys/HWGQueue.lha'</TT>.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Q:</STRONG>
<DD>None of these happen but it still doesn't work as you described.
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>Are you using OS 2.04 later? Are you using the standard AmigaShell?
Try with all extras disabled.
