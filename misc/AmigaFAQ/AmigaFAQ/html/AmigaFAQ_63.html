and distributed in Japan by MIQ Japan, Ltd. has been released
in Japan. It offers a Japanese environment for Commodore Amiga
users, is compatible with Amiga DOS 2.0 (works fine with version
1.3, too), and requires at least 1MB RAM (more recommended). ANS
features Japanese windows/menus (these replace the English menus),
12 and 24 dot-matrix Japanese fonts, Jinput/Joutput (both constitute
a Japanese front-end processor), XEDmini (a simple Japanese text
editor with built-in font editor, and can be used as a Japanese
terminal), a kana-to-kanji conversion dictionary for XEDmini and
Jinput, Jfilter (for viewing Japanese files while connected to an
MS-DOS console), and utilities for Japanese code conversion and
communication. Note that XEDmini uses pcj (Japanese version of
pcd) for communications, and that one can do binary
uploads/downloads while working on files). I hear that it is
reasonably priced, and very easy to use.
<P>
JemTeX is a preprocessor that turns a Japanese text file (i.e.,
a TeX file with Japanese text) into a standard (La/Mu)TeX file.
The archive (zipped) comes with the jis2mf utility along with a
24-dot bitmapped kanji font and a program for generating kanji
tables. With jis2mf you can make metafont files out of the
bitmapped font. JemTeX v2.0 will compile on an Amiga using
SAS/C, or on a UNIX machine using gcc. This program is available
at the FTP site utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11). JemTeX v2.0
was written by Francois Jalbert (jalbert@iro.umontreal.ca or
jalbert@cs.ubc.ca).
<P>
The following are PD viewers on Aminet (text/show directory)
<P>
JIStoJi by Bart Mathias automatically identifies
electronic texts written in Old-JIS, New-JIS, Shift-JIS, or EUC-JIS
(as well as ASCII) and displays them on screen, or prints them to
dot-matrix printers. Will run on Kickstart 1.3 and up.
<P>
jmore (Japanese more) is basically a more clone that also reads
ns-kanji (Shift-JIS) text. It opens its own hires interlaced screen
and requires a font handler called jFontSys to be running. The
archive includes jmore, jFontsys and the wlook/16 bitmap font.
However, you will also need the kanji fonts. (Aminet,
<TT>`text/font/amknj16.lzh'</TT>) All the documentation comes as Japanese
text, so you need a JIS viewer to read the installation
instructions. For your convenience, I have summarized the
installation procedure below:
<OL>
<LI>Place the <CODE>wlook/16</CODE> font in your <TT>`FONTS:'</TT>
directory
<LI>Assign <TT>`JFONTS:'</TT> to where you unarchive the
amknj16 fonts. This need not be the same as your <TT>`FONTS:'</TT>
directory
<LI>Place the file <TT>`jFont-startup'</TT> in the <TT>`S:'</TT>
directory
<LI>Insert the following line into your <TT>`startup-sequence'</TT>:
<PRE>
    run &#62;nil: jFontSys
</PRE>
<LI>To use execute the following command
<PRE>
    jmore &#60;japanese.txt&#62;
</PRE>
</OL>
<P>
JISconvert by Dwight Hubbard is a japanese text conversion utility
for Amiga computers. It supports conversion between EUC, New JIS,
Old JIS, NEC JIS and Shift JIS. It also has options to convert
half-size katakana to full size and repair files with ESC
characters stripped. No installation required. Requires
AmigaDOS 2.04 or newer.
