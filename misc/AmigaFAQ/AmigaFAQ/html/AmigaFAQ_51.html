TeX is a very powerful wordprocessing system. It can display mathematical
formulas or complex tables as well as function graphs, creates indices,
contents and many other things. Its greatest advantage is that it is freely
distributable (TeX, not the previewers and the printer drivers!) and that you
find TeX all over the world on every computer family. Its greatest
disadvantage is that it isn't very handy (works similar to a compiler) and
it isn't wysiwyg. But many people like it. (BTW: This document is written
using TeX. 8-) See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_49.html#SEC49">What word processors are there?</A>.
<P>
There are two major implementations on the Amiga. The first one, Amiga-TeX,
from Thomas Rockicki and Radical Eye software is commercial. It is said to
be excellent and his owners seem to be very satisfied. But it costs at
least 200$.
<P>
I recommend PasTeX, a freely distributable version. People seem to have
problems installing PasTeX, especially the font loading and generation
(It's a quite complex program.) but I did not here anyone upset
once it was installed. (A friend with knowledge of TeX helps immensely.)
A few words should be said what you need:
<UL>
<LI>5 disks containing the TeX-compiler itself
<LI>2 disks containing MetaFont
<LI>Nothing more
</UL>
J&ouml;rgen Grahn has written a short essay on how he personally did to make
LaTeX work on his Amiga.
It's on Aminet as <TT>`text/tex/UsingLaTeX.lha'</TT>.
<P>
Many people ask for fonts. They are included in the MetaFont-package and
can get compiled by you. All you need to do is setting up your TeX-system
in the right way which is described in the documentation. Please note that
the PasTeX disks are compressed using the program Zoom. (see  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_73.html#SEC73">What are files ending with ...?</A>)
Sources: FTP at <CODE>ftp.uni-passau.de</CODE>, directory
