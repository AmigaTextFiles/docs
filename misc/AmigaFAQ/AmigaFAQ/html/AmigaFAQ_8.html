MUI is a set of shared libraries which are used to build a comfortable
GUI (<CODE>Graphical user interface</CODE>). The general idea of MUI is that
the programmer determines only the logical structure of the GUI and the
look (Font, Size, Windows on Workbench, Public Screen, own Screen, ...)
is determined by the user only. From the programmers point of view
using MUI is simpler than <CODE>gadtools.library</CODE> but much more
powerful. On the other hand MUI interfaces are slower than
GadTools-Interfaces, especially on old 68000 machines.
<P>
MUI is found in two archives, one for developers only and one for
users. Source: Aminet, <TT>`dev/misc'</TT>.
