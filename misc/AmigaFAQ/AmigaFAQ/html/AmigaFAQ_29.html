<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="AmigaFAQ_toc.html#SEC29">What compilers (assemblers) are there?</A></H2>
There is a lot of programming languages on the Amiga, commercial as well as
freely distributable. I will enumerate only those that I know or which seem
it worth to me otherwise.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Assembler</STRONG>
<DD>All C-compilers have an Assembler included. Freely distributable are
A68K and PhxAss (directory <TT>`dev/asm'</TT> on Aminet or Fish disks 521 and
906)
<P>
Commercial Assemblers are MaxonASM, OMA3.0 and DevPack3.14.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Basic</STRONG>
<DD><P>
The following commercial Basic-compiler/interpreter are available:
BlitzBasic2, Amos and MaxonBasic3.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>C</STRONG>
<DD><A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<DT><STRONG>C++</STRONG>
<DD>Freely distributable C-compilers are <CODE>gcc</CODE> (which has its own directory
<TT>`dev/gcc'</TT> on Aminet) and the evaluation version of
<CODE>Dice</CODE> (for example per FTP from <CODE>ftp.uni-paderborn.de</CODE>, directory
<TT>`/news/comp.binaries.amiga/volume91/languages'</TT> or on Fish disk 491).
The advantage of gcc is that you find gcc versions all over the
world and on all computer systems. Another advantage is that C++ is included
into gcc! But it is slow and needs 4Mb of RAM or more.
See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_37.html#SEC37">The GNU C compiler: general information and installation</A>.
See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_87.html#SEC87">Discussing things</A>.
<P>
Commercial C compilers are <CODE>Aztec-C</CODE>, <CODE>Dice</CODE>, <CODE>SAS/C</CODE>
amd <CODE>MaxonC++</CODE>.
<CODE>Aztec-C</CODE> doesn't seem to get further development any more.
It should be remarked that the commercial compilers have especially wonderful
debugging utilities (Source level debuggers!) that the others are missing.
<P>
SAS has announced to drop support of the Amiga-Compiler, too, due to
the Amiga's bad situation. However,
the compiler is still available and up-to-date and has a crosscompiler
included, which translates C++ to C and supports the source level
debugger too. Considering the price of just 99$ for students and
updates from recent versions or other compilers it is still
the most recommendable of the three. In europe the compiler is available
from

</PRE>
<P>
Dice is the cheapest and fastest commercial compiler. The greatest
disadvantage of Dice (compared to the other commercial compilers) is
the so-called Source-Line-Debugger:
This means that you see the current line of source and can execute
the program step by step, like with the other debuggers. On the other
hand you can examine memory only, not the variables.
To get information about DICE, send email to
info@oic.COM. An automatic system will return complete details,
including upgrade prices.
<P>
Comeau C++ is a crosscompiler like SAS/C++. That wouldn't be a problem, but
Comeau C++ doesn't have a C compiler included.
You need SAS/C, Aztec-C or Dice additionally. But it is AT&#38;T cfront 3.0
compliant and supports exceptions. And like gcc it runs on many platforms.
Maxxon C++ is offered in Germany. I cannot say anything on it. Both
compilers are commercial. Comeau's address is:

<P>
Maxon C++ is both a C++ and a C compiler. There is a light version and a
developer version. The developer version matches the AT&#38;T standard 3.0.
Maxon-light includes a compiler and a editor. Developer includes a
source level debugger, Amiga classes library and Hot Help with documentation
to the amiga libs.
It is a german product, and compiler and documentation are german.
The compiler has some little bugs, but you can work with it well, anyway.

<DT><STRONG>Forth</STRONG>
<DD>JForth is said to be an excellent Amiga port of Forth. Among its advantages
are object oriented extensions, full Amiga interface and an application
generator. It is available from:

<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Fortran</STRONG>
<DD>(Sigh! Still people who need it :-&#60;)
Freely distributable are BCF (Fish disk 470) and f2c, a Fortran to C
converter (Aminet, directory <TT>`/dev/lang'</TT>). A commercial compiler is
offered from ABSoft. All these are Fortran 77 compilers, I don't know
any Fortran 90 compiler on the Amiga.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Lisp</STRONG>
<DD>Freely distributable Lisp interpreters are XLisp (Fish disk 181) and OakLisp
(Fish disks 519 and 520) and CLISP (<TT>`/pub/lisp/clisp/binaries/amiga'</TT>
at the server <TT>`ftp ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de'</TT>). Lisp
compilers are Gambit
(Fish 764 and 765) and Scheme-to-C (Fish disks 556, 557 and 558).
See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_87.html#SEC87">Discussing things</A>.
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Prolog</STRONG>
<DD><TT>`/dev/lang/UNSWProlog.lha'</TT> and <TT>`dev/lang/sbp3_1e.lha'</TT> on Aminet
as well as <TT>`SBProlog'</TT> on Fish disk 141 and <TT>`SBProlog'</TT> on Fish disk
145 are freely distributable Prolog interpreters.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Modula-2</STRONG>
<DD>M2Amiga is offered in Europe, Benchmark Modula-2 in the U.S. Both are said
to be very good, have a powerful source-level-debugger, a large library.
Especially M2Amiga has great support by a german user-group (AMOK) which
for example offers own PD disks. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_87.html#SEC87">Discussing things</A>.

<DT><STRONG>Oberon</STRONG>
<DD><A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Oberon-2</STRONG>
<DD>Two compilers (both Oberon-2) are available: AmigaOberon (commercial)
is offered by the same company as M2Amiga. It is integrated
into a full developers environment and has a large library of modules.
Library linker and  source level debugger are available.
<P>
Oberon-A is a Freeware compiler. (Source: Aminet, <TT>`dev/obero'</TT>
directory) However, this is a beta release, especially the module
library is limited. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_87.html#SEC87">Discussing things</A>.
<P>
The AMOK user group supports AmiOberon as well as M2Amiga.
<P>
In addition to these two standalone compilers which are thought
mainly for creating AmigaOS applications, there is an Amiga port of
the Oberon Sytem V4, too. The Oberon System is implemented as an
AmigaOS-Task using a separate screen and includes an Oberon-2
compiler. You can use it to write software that will work on all
implementations of the Oberon System V4 (for example Macintosh,
Windows or Sparc) without any changes.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Pascal</STRONG>
<DD>There is a PD-compiler called PCQ (Directory <TT>`dev/lang'</TT> on
Aminet or Fish disk 511). It doesn't support all of Pascal and major
features are missing. P2C, a pascal to C converter is on disk 341. (Aminet:
<TT>`/dev/misc/p2c120.lha'</TT>)
Additionally there are two commercial compilers called
HiSoft Pascal and KickPascal. HiSoft Pascal and P2C claim to be compatible
to Turbo Pascal up to 5.0. HiSoft has a source level debugger included.
