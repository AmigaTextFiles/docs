PostScript is a programming language designed to be used to describe
printing on pages. Apple helped make PostScript popular by selling printers
with built in PostScript interpreters. Many programs have evolved to
produce PostScript programs as their output, making PostScript the lingua
franca of printing. Until recently, in order to print a PostScript file,
you had to have a relatively expensive laser printer. The development that
changed this was the software PostScript interpreter. These programs allow
your computer to interpret PostScript programs, and produce the matrix of
dots to send to your normal graphics printer.
<P>
One of the benefits of PostScript is that it is resolution independent.
What this means is that it can support the highest resolution of your device
-- and that you can reasonably preview PostScript on a low resolution screen.
<P>
There are two free PostScript interpreters for the Amiga. Post and
Ghostscript. Post comes as an Amiga shared library along with front ends for
previewing to the screen and printing. This structure allows others to write
programs that can show PostScript images on screen. In fact, AmigaTeX uses
Post's library to support incorporation of PostScript into documents.
Ghostscript similarly comes in two programs, but not as a shared library.
Ghostscript is the rendering engine, and Ghostview is the front end.
