The standard icons aren't beautiful, indeed.
But there do exist some beautiful icon collections.
I know of <CODE>MagicWB</CODE> and <CODE>NewIcons</CODE>.
<P>
<CODE>MagicWB</CODE> is Shareware. The icons are drawn beautiful in pastel
with every known trick. You also get a lot of good backgrounds which
beautify workbench windows and MUI programs.
Fine and good readable fonts replace the clumsy topaz8 font.
You also get good icons for the ToolManager.
You can find a test version of MagicWB on Aminet.
<P>
<CODE>NewIcons</CODE> is Freeware. The icons do have relative intensive colors
and are drawn as three dimensional objects floating slanted in space.
You can find NewIcons on Aminet, <TT>`util/wb/NewIcons.lha'</TT>.

<DD>How do I turn off the "Gag" of MagicWorkbench
(the intro which appears sometimes during booting)?
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>In S: should be a file called <TT>`mti.data'</TT>. Delete it.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>F:</STRONG>
<DD>How can I create NewIcons?
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>The author of NewIcon currently works on an IconEd. Until then,
Iconian 2.9x (I3) is the only way to create NewIcons.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>F:</STRONG>
<DD>How can I prevent MagicWorkbench Icons to appear in incorrect colors?
<DT><STRONG>A:</STRONG>
<DD>Register MagicWB 2.0, it contains a tool which patches the palette,
or get one of the different tools from Aminet.
<DT><STRONG>MagicColors</STRONG>
<DD><DT><STRONG>ShoveColors</STRONG>
<DD>Its a good program, you can find it in Iconian, PictIcon or <TT>`Aminet:util/wb/'</TT>).
