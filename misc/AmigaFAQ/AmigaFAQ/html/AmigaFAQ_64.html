HZview (by Ji Ma) shows 8-bit Guo Biao encoded chinese text
documents. Requires AmigaDOS v2.1 and above, and cclib.16
bitmap library (included).
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: This is a pre-release version. What the doc
file does not tell you is that you need to do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Open a default public hires interlaced 1 or 2-bit deep
screen
<LI>The size of the file to be read is restricted to about 30K
(on my machine, A1200, WB3.0)
<LI>An FPU is required if you want to scroll the text without
crashing
<LI>The cclib.16 should be in the same directory as the file
to be read
</OL>
Other small bugs still exist which may crash the machine.
