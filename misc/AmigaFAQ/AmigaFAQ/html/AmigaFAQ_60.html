<P>
  This is very, very difficult. Many people imagine that there are
  programs that will simply convert pictures into fonts for them. This is
  not the case; most fonts are painstakingly created by drawing curves
  that closely approximate the letterforms. In addition, special rules
  (which improve hinting, etc.) mandate that these curves be drawn in
  specific ways. Even designing, or merely digitizing, a simple font can
  take hundreds of hours.
<P>
  The easiest way of learning how to create fonts, is to have a look at
  existing fonts and try to change some letters.
<P>
  Given that, there are two major programs used for font design on the
  Amiga, TypeSmith 2.5 ($150) and FontDesigner ($100). These programs
  will allow you to import scanned images, and then trace them with
  drawing tools.  The programs will then generate Adobe type 1, 3, TrueType,
  AGFA Intellifont, DMF and Bitmap fonts for either the Amiga, the Macintosh
  or the IBM PC. They will also generate automatic hinting. They also open
  previously constructed outline fonts, allowing them to be modified, or
  converted into another format.
<P>
  As far as I know, there are no shareware programs that allows you to
  generate outline fonts.
<P>
  There are also two programs for creating bitmap fonts. Personal Fonts
  Maker and Calligrapher. The second one has not been updated for several
  years, but it still is a good tool to work with. The first Program was
  created by adding some features to a good bitmap paint program (Personal
  Paint).
<P>
  There are some shareware tools to create bitmap fonts which you can
  convert to outline (vector) fonts with TypeSmith.
