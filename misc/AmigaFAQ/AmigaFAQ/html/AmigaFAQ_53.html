  The Amiga is able to use two different concepts of fonts. First of all
  there are the bitmap fonts. These fonts are created by drawing a letter
  pixel for pixel onto the screen. The advantage is that they look good at
  small sizes, but are not very good for printout. Also they don't look
  very good when you change their size. Therefore you have to recreate the
  font for each size. Second there are the vector fonts. They are created by
  curves which are stored as mathematical formula. This has the advantage
  that changing the sizes does not effect the output. But this only applies
  for larger sizes and print-outs. Vector fonts also use less memory.
