PAL and NTSC are two different video standards, the former being
European, and the latter being American. PAL has a slightly taller
screen (256 lines non-interlaced, non-overscanned) as opposed to NTSC
(200 lines), so if you see the bottom portion of a program's screen
getting cut off on your American machine, chances are the program was
written for PAL, and is running on your shorter NTSC screen. PAL and
NTSC differences are somewhat less important to European users; since
their machines default to PAL, running an NTSC program is no more than
a minor annoyance having the screen only appear in the top portion of
the display.
<P>
Therefore, for us NTSC folks, switching into PAL mode becomes important
to avoid loss of some picture on Euro Demos, etc.
<P>
First, the most common misconception about switching between PAL and
NTSC is that you need a Multiscan or special monitor for such a purpose.
Not so! Just about any monitor can handle the minor signal difference
between PAL and NTSC (50Hz vertical refresh versus 60Hz). The 108x,
19xx, and 20xx series, and even most TVs, can display both PAL and NTSC.
Sometimes it is necessary to perform minor tweaking of vertical hold
and/or v. size on your monitor to achieve full display, though this is
trivial.
<P>
What IS needed to switch between PAL and NTSC in software, is a "Fatter"
(1MB) Agnus or better. If your system has more than 512K of CHIP RAM
(use the avail command to find out) you have this chip. If you do not,
ou can still construct a hardware switch (see below).
<P>
The following directions assume you're an NTSC user who wants to switch
into PAL mode, but the procedure for going from PAL to NTSC is much the
same.
<P>
The most common use of switching into PAL is for self-booting games,
demos, etc.  The best way to accomplish this on pre-3.0 systems is
to use Chris Hames' Degrader program (most recent version: 1.30). Once
you have procured this program, the switch is as simple as selecting
"50Hz", and "50Hz System", then installing the program's ROMTag (little
program that runs at boot-time) by pressing the "Survive Reset(s)" button.
<P>
AmigaDOS 3.0 added a PAL/NTSC switch feature to its Boot Menu, and all
you need to do in order to access this is hold down both mouse buttons
as the computer boots. Select Display Options, Display Mode/PAL, and
then Boot. If the program still fails to go into PAL mode (Zool is
one I've found), you may wish to get Degrader anyway and try that.
<P>
Software PAL/NTSC switching is easy and painless. Some people have
gone even further by installing hardware PAL/NTSC switches. This
results in a system which even the most nasty hardware-banging programs
can't bring to its original configuration (if it has been switched).
The procedure is simple -- most Amigas have jumpers already -- but
beyond the scope of this document.
<P>
Therefore, if your screen is too short or cut off, seek the different
screen mode. You'll "see new horizons", literally!
