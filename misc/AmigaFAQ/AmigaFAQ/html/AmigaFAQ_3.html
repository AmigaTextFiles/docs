The first 680x0 processors (upto 68030) could process integers only.
Floating point operations had to be emulated by the software. An FPU is a
chip (or part of a chip) that can process floating point operations, a
mathematical coprocessor.
<P>
One separates three FPU types on the Amiga: The 68881, 68882 and the 68040's
internal FPU. The 68882 is up to 1.5 times faster than the 68881, because it
is splitted in two parts: A conversion unit (the FPU's are using an 80 bit
format internally) and the arithmetic unit. The 68040's internal FPU adds
a pipeline, but misses the trigonometric instructions of the others. These
are still emulated by the software, 68040.library for example.
<P>
Special programs (Raytracing, DTP, Mathematics, TeX) are offered in a
special coprocessor version which are up to 50 times faster than the original
versions.
