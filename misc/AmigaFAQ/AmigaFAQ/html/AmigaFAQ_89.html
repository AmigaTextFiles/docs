The Amiga-FAQ is available in different formats: Ascii format (which is
posted to the nets) AmigaGuide format (which is the adequate format on
the Amiga) and in dvi format (to be printed). Additionally there is some
stuff, that might be useful or interesting, but could not be included
into the Amiga-FAQ:
