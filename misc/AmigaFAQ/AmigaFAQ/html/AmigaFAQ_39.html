Any Amiga (ranging from A1000 upto A4000/40) will run amigados-gnu
utilities. A minimum of 4MB memory is needed in order to compile
small/medium projects. More memory will be needed for large projects,
such as recompiling gcc itself, or programming C++. Gigamem and VMM
do work with GCC so *maybe* less memory will work. But in this case,
an MMU equipped Amiga (A3000,A4000/40) is necessary.
See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_2.html#SEC2">What are 68EC020, 68EC030 and 68LC040?</A>.
<P>
A full installation, including C++/ObjC related files, inline headers,
cbm-headers, (see  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_27.html#SEC27">Where do I get the Amiga includes?</A>) roughly requires about 20 MB of HD
space.
<P>
Support for 1.2/1.3 is dropped. If you have 1.2/1.3, get a better
Kickstart version. Gcc works under KS 1.2/1.3, but the full functionality
is only available under KS 2.x+. A fast CPU (eg. 68030@25MHz or better) is
also of help.
