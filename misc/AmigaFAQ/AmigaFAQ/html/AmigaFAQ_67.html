Actually there are three Unix versions on the Amiga. All of them need at
least 68030 (see  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_2.html#SEC2">What are 68EC020, 68EC030 and 68LC040?</A>), probably a 68040 in the near future
and seem to have problems
with many hard-drive-controllers. You should have a good look into the
documentation before installing it. Unix needs much resources, say at least
10Mb RAM and a 150Mb Unix-partition on the hard-drive.

<LI>Commodore offered a System V Unix in the past. It contained TCP/IP,
X11 and other software and seemed to make a good job, but it was expensive
and after all Commodore has dropped developing it. Commodore-Unix needs a
streamer because it is distributed on tapes.
<P>
<LI>A Linux port is prepared. But actually there is not very much than the
kernel. Specialists might like to use it, but it cannot be recommended for
now. Linux is freely distributable. Sources: <CODE>ftp.tsx-11.mit.edu</CODE> or
<CODE>ftp.uni-erlangen.de</CODE>, both directory <TT>`/pub/Linux/MIRROR.tsx-11/680x0'</TT>.
Or <CODE>ftp.leo.org</CODE>, directory <TT>`/pub/comp/os/linux/680x0'</TT>.
<P>
<LI>NetBSD is freely distributable too. Like Linux it isn't ready for now,
but it seems to make big steps. Most GNU software is said to run, especially
emacs and gcc. I think it's worth to have a look on it. Sources:
<CODE>ftp.uni-erlangen.de</CODE>, Directory <TT>`/pub/amiga/unix/NetBSD-regensburg'</TT>.
