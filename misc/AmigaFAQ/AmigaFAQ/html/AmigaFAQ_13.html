As you can see, this is a somewhat difficult way of using pipes,
needing a lot of typing especially compared to the UNIX pipes. There
is a solution for that.
<P>
Andy Finkel, a former Commodore software engineer wrote a command
called <CODE>Pipe</CODE> (not to be confused with <TT>`PIPE:'</TT>) that
simplifies the use of the <TT>`PIPE:'</TT> device. Unfortunately, this
command did not make it into the 2.04 release. However, Commodore
has given the permission to distribute this, and a few other
commands, freely. (Sources: Fish disk 673, Aminet,
<TT>`util/cli/finkelshelltools.lha'</TT>)
<P>
For some reason Commodore did not include these commands in the later
OS releases, although they work fine even with OS 3.1 (V40). Thus all
users are required to get them from the above sources if they wish to
use them.
<P>
The Pipe command usage is simple. The commands to be run with their
inputs and outputs piped together are given as arguments to the
command, separated by the <KBD>|</KBD> (vertical bar) character:
<P>
<PRE>
    1&#62; Pipe List SYS: | More
        or
    1&#62; Pipe List: SYS: NOHEAD | Sort IN: OUT: | More
</PRE>
Notice how Sort needs <TT>`IN:'</TT> and <TT>`OUT:'</TT>. These devices
don't actually exist, but the Pipe command simulates them with
the PIPE:. This is necessary because C:Sort can not use the
`standard IO', but insists on files.
<P>
The separator character <KBD>|</KBD> can be configured to be something else
with the local variable <VAR>__pchar</VAR>.
