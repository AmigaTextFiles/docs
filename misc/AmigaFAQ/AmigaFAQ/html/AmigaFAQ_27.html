The only legal way to get the includes and autodocs (and you <EM>should</EM>
get them, they are <EM>very</EM> useful!) is to become a developer
(see  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_28.html#SEC28">How do I become a developer?</A>) or to buy the <CODE>NDU</CODE> (Native developers update kit,
also known as <CODE>NDUK</CODE> or <CODE>NDK</CODE>), which is offered by CATS. They cost
about 30$ plus shipping and this seems to me to be a fair price. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_26.html#SEC26">What is CATS?</A>.
The current version is 3.1.
<P>
If you need only the includes, you could get them as well with a compiler
(commercial compilers only) or by getting the Fresh Fish CD. See  <A HREF="AmigaFAQ_84.html#SEC84">The Fresh Fish CD-Roms</A>.
