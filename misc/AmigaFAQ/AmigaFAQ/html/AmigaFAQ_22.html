Monitors can be classified after the horizontal scan frequency they require.
TVs, as well as C='s 1084 monitor, need frequencies around 15 kHz. VGA/SVGA
need approx. 30 kHz. Multisync monitors can take many frequencies.
<P>
In short: You can use any monitor you want with an A1200. BUT:

If you use a regular VGA/SVGA monitor, you can only use a few display modes
(like DblPAL, DblNTSC and/or Productivity). I.e. (320|640) x (256|512|1024)
for DblPAL. This is great for Workbench and all "serious" utilities (DTP etc),
but don't expect any games to work... they don't use your preferences, just
take over the machine and assume a 15 kHz monitor. Also, you cannot utilize
the  "Early Startup Control" screen (you know, disable cache, and that stuff),
which also requires a 15 kHz monitor. Furthermore, VGA monitors don't have
speakers. And the VGA-type modes don't support Genlocks. But for a lot of
"serious" work, a VGA monitor is quite adequate.
<P>
<LI>
You already know what happens with a 15 kHz monitor; the flickering in
Interlace mode. A small tip: Try to use NTSC instead of PAL. This increases
the refresh rate from 25 Hz to 30 Hz, at the expense of lower vertical
resolution (482 lines maximum). The NTSC and PAL modes aren't as bad as many
people think. If your monitor has a lot of phosphorous (long afterglow),
PAL Laced can be quite OK, and it gives you a resolution of 1448x566 in
SuperHiRes. That's the highest resolution currently supported on AGA Amigas,
in _any_ display mode.
<P>
<LI>
A Multisync gives you the best of both worlds. The 1940 and 1942 monitors
from C= are quite OK, although rather cumbersome to use... The h/v size and
offset must be set manually each time you switch display mode.
<A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="AmigaFAQ_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>
The 1960 monitor doesn't have this problem, but it's a bit more expensive.
</UL>
<P>
For a VGA/SVGA or Multisync monitor, you'd need a little shiny box which gives
you the standard 15-pin "D" connector. It costs around $15.
<P>
There are other alternatives... like the "AmiVGA" box ($50 or so), which I
think is a cheapo version of the Flicker Fixer. (But it's really a shame to
use this on an AGA Amiga.)
<P>
Also, you can get a VGA monitor, and hook up your TV to the composite or RF
port on the Amiga - one monitor for games, one for serious stuff.
