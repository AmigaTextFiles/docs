This is a department at Commodore West Chester which was formerly named
<CODE>Commodore Amiga Technical Support</CODE> and was later renamed
<CODE>Commodore Application and Technical Support</CODE>. These are people that
work independently of Engineering, but close together with them, and try
to help developers outside of Commodore to create nice Amiga applications,
software or hardware. To achieve this, CATS has gathered a lot of informations
and tools, on floppy, CD, or paper. Much of this material is also available
to the general public. <A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="AmigaFAQ_foot.html#FOOT5">(5)</A> But don't
mix this up with some sort of Hotline for everyone!
