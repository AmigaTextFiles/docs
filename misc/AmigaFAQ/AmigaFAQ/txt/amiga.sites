============================= AMIGA MAIL SERVERS =============================
     
     
------------------------------- Server 1 -------------------------------------
     
Correspondence to: greg@noel.CTS.COM
     
Requests to: amiga-archive@ncr-sd.SanDiego.NCR.COM (Registered domain address)
             amiga-archive@ncr-sd.UUCP             (Psuedo-domain address)
             ...!ncr-sd!amiga-archive              (UUCP path)
     
Ncr-sd is not on the Internet; FTP access is not possible.  Anonymous UUCP is
not supported.
     
All lines of the incoming mail message are ignored except lines that begin
with either "path" or "send".  (For compatibility with other servers, "help"
and "index" are also recognized and are treated as equivalent to "send help"
and "send index".)
     
If a line saying "path route-from-us-to-you" is encountered, it will be used
for any subsequent mail.  If the path line is missing, the system will try to
determine the reply address; it's pretty good at guessing, but it's not
perfect.  Try it initially without the path line; if you don't get an answer
in a reasonable period, try again with one.  We run a full domain router, so
the route-from-me-to-you should be a domain address (or a UUCP psuedo-domain
address) if you have one.
     
Start with "send help" for information on how to get started.
     
The mail server is actually the beta test version of an archive server that I
hope to fill with Amiga sources and binaries.  If you are interested in
providing some feedback, try the requests "send help" and "send index" to see
how to use it.  I'd appreciate any help you can offer in getting this started.
There's only about 15MB of stuff so far, so I need to make arrangements to get
access to more of the comp.{sources,binaries}.amiga archives; anybody have
this in a form that I can conveniently get?
     
     
     
------------------------------ Server 2 --------------------------------------
     
        Announcing MRCserv, a mailserver based at Mount Royal College.
     
        MRCserv is a MAIL ONLY based server.  Mount Royal is not on
        the Internet so FTP access is not supported.  Anonymous UUCP
        is also not supported.
     
        All commands to the server must be in the BODY of the message.
        The subject line is ignored.
     
        The address of the server is MRCserv@Janus.MtRoyal.AB.CA
     
        Mount Royal College is in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Our time
        zone is MST.  Please try and restrict your archive access to
        non-prime hours (primetime is 07:00 - 17:00).
     
        MRCserv is currenly in BETA test.  If you experence any problems
        please send e-mail to RMF@Janus.MtRoyal.AB.CA
     
|       There had been a fatal bug in the server in that it would inform
|       you of files being sent, but they never were (BETA 0.48)
     
|       A PATH command had been added.  It appears that the server had some
!       trouble with "!" addresses, so a path command became necessary.  The
|       server is pretty good usally in figuring out return-paths, hoever if
|       you don't receive a response from the server try again with a PATH
|       command.  Remember the PATH is from the SERVER to you.  If you are
|       using "!" paths please add the .UUCP domain name, ie. a!b!c!d!user.uucp
     
        Enjoy!
==============================================================
     
    MRCserv - Mount Royal College Mail Server (BETA 0.50)

        LS        -   briefly list a directory
        DIR -d    -   list subdirectories only
        LS -d     -   briefly subdirectories only
|       DIR -s nn -   list files added to archinve in the last 'nn' days
|                     an optional parameter of 'directory specification
|                     can be added (ie dir -s 07 *.* )
|       LS -s nn  -   briefly list files added in last 'nn' days
        CD        -   change working directory
        GET       -   sends you one or more files
        HELP      -   sends you this help
        EXIT      -   finishes request
|       PATH      -   Path from MRCserv to you.  (if your using "!" paths make
|                     address ends with a .UUCP ie.  foo!bar.uucp)
        PUT       -   Put a file in the archive. (must be validated first).
|                     (currently not implemented)
     
    Extensions:
        ZOO     - ZOO file      ZUU     - UUencoded ZOO file
        ARC     - ARC file      AUU     - UUencoded ARC file
        LZH     - LHARC file    LUU     - UUencoded LHARC file
        LHW     - LhWarp file   DIR     - VMS directory file

    Subdirectories can be accessed via the CD command.  For example, if
    you see a file with the extension .DIR (ie ARCHIVERS.DIR), CD to
    it by issuing the command CD [ARCHIVERS] (case insensitive, brackets are
    not required).  To move to the parent directory issue the command CD [-]
    (Brackets are required) To move to the root directory issue command
    CD [000000]

    will be informed of the number of parts in the server's response.  All
    files will be sent as separate messages (except HELP).
     
    In the reply sent by MRCserv, your commands are preceeded by a less-than
    sign "<".  MRCserv responses are preceeded by a greater-than sign ">".
