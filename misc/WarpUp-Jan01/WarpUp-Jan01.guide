Subject: @{b}[warpup] hehe, my comp works again.@{ub}

I buyed wrong spray to clean my computer. I bought some kind of protectiv contact spray
that is has an oil form when dryes. To late i saw that. I sprayed over my motherboard, prelude
, ioblix+ ehernet and my zorro port in my mediator tower.

My father read the paper on the spray and said to me that i'm fucked up.
So we tryed to clean all the oil from it. The good thing is that doesn't make contact.
We got rid off the most off the oil but some is left. Really hard to get rid off and it's not good
using to much chemicals on my dear miggy. But it's hard to get rid off it on the components
etc. I'm really a shithead. So i get everything assembled back and nothing worked. 

My friend come over with his 030 card for testing and we come to the conclusion
that i put back the os31 roms in wrong order. Heh, much laughs here.

Anyway, one day more and i would be a pc user now. But with plans buying a new amiga
when having money for it. (Hey, i love amiga:)

But we got it to work. Really great. I had some problems getting my 4gb scsi hd to work but
little fiddling with the cabels and the ppc it now works. And it has HIHI some protective oil
(i hope it not my computer boils in there).

I had in plans going on a club here and after getting to a friend on new years Eve but noting
of that. I was home with my olders. I was in really heavy depress mood. I needed lucky pills
really bad. hehe. So i thought this was my new year present so i can finally buy me a pc and
use it with Flash5/photoshop6 etc for homepage building and finding me a job.

Not and i don't have any space for 2 computers as i'm still with my parents.
But hey, if i have to choose i choose Amiga.

Happy new year, little late now but my amiga was dead.

Using blocksize to 1024 instead of 512 on PFS3 on my scsi HD. Is it okay.
Somebody told me it's better using 512 on PFS3.

Hello people,

Strangely enough AMP "flicks" the MPEG animations in 24 bits at a very slow
rate, on my 603 210Mhz.

I read this should go nearly as fast as in 16 bits (which runs smoothly), is
there a setting in my config which is wrong?

From: Martin Kuchinka <kuchinka@volny.cz>

Subject: @{b}[warpup] BPPC+BVision problems@{ub}

  Hello!

My friend just bought a bvision, but when he plugged it, Amiga doesn't
work anymore. To be more specific, he sais, that it starts to boot, but
after the first reset (blizzkick) it doesn't go on. It's also impossible
to get into blizzard menu or to boot menu. Withour the bvision connected
it works pretty well, but when he connects it, it seams, that something
is hardware activated what doesn't work there. He also tried to plug it
into another blizzard and there it worked pretty well, so the problem
can be somewhere on the blizzard, not the bvision. His blizzard is
overclocked to 210 MHz (but I'm not sure if from 160, 175 or 200 MHz)
and the 040 is overclocked to 33 MHz, everything without and problem.
It's impossible to get to boot/blizz menu nor right after a cold reset.
Had someone here similar problems?

Thanks in advance, kind regards

Disable overlay, use triple buffering and get AMP2Final from
http://www.amidog.com/
16bit looks funny in AMP2Final, though.

The BVision might not work if the bus crystal has been replaced. Also, the
flashrom could be too old.

   I had a similar problem with mine (no overclocking
 though) it all worked OK once I updated the flashrom
*WITHOUT* the Bvision connected. try downloading the
latest from DCE.

Any examples? I've overclocked quite a few different cards by
replacing oscillator, bus multiplier or both and none of them has
problems with BVision.

MO> Also, the flashrom could be too old.

This could be the issue or there's a power shortage.

Nopes, don't have any examples, but I guess it could be a problem. If I put
my BVision on my friends BPPC, the bus byteswapping fails somewhere, dunno
why. It's not even overclocked. Any suggestions ? :)

Oh yes, the power shortage, I forgot. If I use my tower, I have to deliver
more power through the floppy power connector, but if I use my external
PSU, no extra power is required.

When I try to install real SCSI HD with HDtoolbox, here it claims it is not
able to handle such a drive!!!
Try with the scsitools from Phase5!

This really seems like a hardware-problem. Make sure you have the latest
flash-rom installed! If you never made such an update, you really
should do that.
Then make sure you use ACTIVE SCSI-Termination on both sides of your
SCSI-bus. YES BOTH! This UW-Controller is not terminated at all, so read
the manual and take the warnings serious. It really might solve your
problems, although it is an expensive thing.... Give it a try!
If you have time, let me know, wether it helped. Most of my problems
disappeared afterwards...

Subject: @{b}[warpup] installppclib and other@{ub}

Hi. I use warp5 and ppclibemu. 

I have downloaded installppclib that makes the ppclib resident.
Should i use the loadlib when i want to start a ppc program or is installppclib ok ?

A friend told me his system was crashing with it but he used powerup and tryed 
warpup and i don't think he installed everything as it should so maybe becuase of that.
So i wonder how it is for you. Should i use it ?

I wonder as i have HW error somewhere so i don't know which one makes the crash 
if so. 

Do anyone use PFS3 normal version on HD bigger than 4gb. I had problems using that
and don't know if i would try to use it again. I use it on my 4gb scsi hd and it's ok.
But on my 9gb ide i had problems with my last partition using normal version. 
I used pfsdoctor for a time ago and lost only some pictures and now there isn't any
deldir on that last partition anymore. This is the only partition i have on right now.
Allt the rest are off becuase i use the scsi hd and i'm gonna clean up my ide hd for
other things. I use setdeldir but after a reboot there isn't any deldir. Do i have to
format the partition to make it avaiable. 

I use WBctrl MNL=100 and on pfs i used setfnsize to 107. Is it ok ?
Do i have to use format to make it alvais avaiable or does setfnsize make it resident on the
hd. I want to use more than 321 characters as many mp3 files have many letters on pc.

Patchcontrol comes with mcp. I use os39. Should i use it still or is it a bad idea. 
I use patchcontrol just for the controll :) In Mcp i only use some funktions, get rid off the
most patches.

cmp060 and systempatch is another patches. Any good. Don't use them just wondering.

My system: PPC+060 CVPPC CGFX4

(cleaning up my startup-sequence so i know what to throw away :)
(Can't get use to Vinced on os39. Uses still KingCon replacing con, easyer)

Well, I discovered something interesting after all. My computer won't start WOS after the instalation of OS3.9 AND WOS5. When I 
manually copied all files from WOS4 everything worked OK (even the new ppclibemu 0.8c). Also that another error (can't load resource 
library) doesn't exist anymore after reinstallation of WOS4. So I think there's some problems with WOS5 (I can't install it even on a 
blank partition and only OS3.9 on it). I have 46.25 ppc.library in FLASH ROM, does it really matters?

I have PFS3 installed on a 9Gig, too. Read the docs of PFS3, somewhere is
mentioned that you HAVE to use PFSDirectSCSI for drives bigger 4Gig. Well,
i`ve PFSds installed and since no problems.

Very much the same for me, should work. But you normally can`t rename witth
WB39 rename command (from shell?) from menu, cause it`s still limited to 32
chars.

I read somewhere (maybe Greg Donners 3.9 FAQ) that you shouldn`t use PC
anymore. You normally could throw out all of the patches PC understands,
though.  :-)

Well, better use NO patches at all.  ;-)

On HD bigger than 4Gb you have to use PFS3DS, the "direct-Scsi" version of
PFS3. The "normal" version doesn't allowed the use of HD >4GB.
PFS3DS is on the PFS3 CD-rom, just re-install it on your new Hard-drive and
all might be OK.

I read it and it's only good if it don't work with normal version. I used Direct scsi.
But now i made a new partition and everything is ok.

Your right. I'm that type of guy that likes to test everything and so pathes to to enhance
my system but often it can fuck up. Like you say. Without patches, at least thoose that

What is "installppclib"? I only know PPCInstall from the original
PowerUp archive and ppclibemu_install, which will be part of the
next ppclibemu release.

I used LoadLib over years without any big problems, but now I came
to the conclusion that a tool like PPCInstall better. LoadLib
does neither open the library nor does is increase the Open-Count.
It only loads it into memory, checks if it's really a library and
calls the Init function.

Assuming installppclib does the same like PPCInstall, which means
opening the library by OpenLibrary() and increasing the Open-Count,
I would prefer it, because there is no danger that the library is
flushed from memory again so soon.

Try it. For example I was unable to run Voyager with VFlashPPC-
plugin when using LoadLib.

IMHO SetPatch is the only patch you need. I never needed any more.

Wiith my config (A1200/PPC/BVision/OS39), WarpOS 5 work fine. If it doesn't
work, make an install of os3.9 and warpos5 and copy your old files from
prefs/env-archive/powerpc to the new system.

This is for (i think) warpUp users. There is a link on the "frogger" mpeg player page.
maybe on aminet too ? It makes the ppclib resident so it doesn't go away after 
a "avail flush"

I think he is talking about tool I wrote for frogger users, that were
complaining about powerup version beeing not executable if started under
emulation.

So this is a HW prob ? Why does it only happen when I use Warpos progs 
followed by MUI progs. All gadtools gui`s are OK and PUP progs don`t affect 
it in any way . Sorry I just don`t see it .

I think your problem is related to locking of some pens.
If the pens used by MUI is'nt locked there might be a problem.
Or if the WarpOS progs fucks up the WB's pen allocation.
Wich WarpOS progs causes this problem.

From: Jesper Wilhelmsson <jive@algonet.se>
Date: 01-06-01 14:59:13
Subject: @{b}[warpup] WarpOS compatible or not..?@{ub}

Hello!

I have an BPPC and have for some time been using powerup versions of
whatever program I have found. When I installed OS3.9 I decided to try
warpos too, and installed it.
During installation I was asked if I wanted to use the 'real' version or a
compatible version (7.something).

When I tried the 'real' 4x.y version I got those requesters at boot time
asking me to terminate something (allways resulting in a crash) which I
guess was a result of not using ppclibemu etc.

So I installed the compatible v7 wich seems to work fine. I can now use both
the old powerup programs and some new warpos stuff. (I couldn't get the
demo of Earth 2140 to work though, dunno if it's related.)

My questions are:
What am I missing when using this v7 in stead of a clean WarpUp system?
Are there programs that won't work?
Can a clean WarpOs run my old powerup tools or do I have to replace them?

Since there are a lot of experienced users on this list I hope some of you
are willing to share your knowledge. What is your recommendations? Should I
try to install the 'installppclibemuetc' whatever it's called? What exactly
is needed to do that?

This sounds really strange. You sure you tested with the latest ppclibemu that works
great with WarpUp5. Maybe something is installed wrong and you can test installing 
warpup and ppclibemu  manually. I heard some people had problems.

Do you use the original 680x0 libraryes from Phase5 ? I don't know if the original
from od39 works well. MMulib i think it's not good for Phase5 cards.

33mhz more than i have :) I want it :)

Hi i have just bought a brand new ppc 604e 233Mhz for my A4000
This is my problem when i ran warpos program all i get is a 
8000002 8000003 error or a crash; i don't use patch i have installed 
my 3.5 with boing bag2 in a new partition and 3.1 on another i
increase the stack up to 300000 before running program and the warpos
i use is the one found on 3.5 installation cd.
With a program called last guru when my amiga crash i get dead end
message as the last error.
Sometimes programs work fine for 1 minutes and then they crash my amiga.
Can anyone tell me why ?

This is my setup
power tower
1 hd 
1 cd reader
Cyberstorm ppc 604e 233 MHz
24 mb ram
(tested simm are ok)
cybervision 64 3d 
hypercom 3 +

No patch or hack running at all
no missing libraries or files reported by snoopdos 3.4
Clean installation of os didn't help
No psu problem, i've tried with two psu 1 for hd cd
the other for motherboard 
no heat problem all the fan works fine.
It seems that as soon as ppc "wake up" it crash my amiga.
No virus as well as no cracked programs
i've tried with and without ppc lib emu as well
as setting up env variable in the right way.

You don't use any ramlib stack increasers. Try MCPRamlibpatch or
BlizKick's ramlibpatch module

 os 3.9, i hope this time they didn't forgot the key like in 3.5 i'm still waiting

Anyway i have already tryed with manual installation of libraries and i used
the latest avaiable from the dce sites but the problems was there even after

The demo needs a more up-to-date version. But it's worth it.

Many of them will work if you have the ppclib emulation (by Frank Wille)
installed which is, in its latest incarnation very compatible to the
ppc.library by phase 5/DCE. Maybe not all your PowerUp software will work
but most of it, I guess.

Install WarpUP using the installer script and follow the instructions.
To install WarpUp for your BPPC put BPPCfix in your startup even before
SetPatch is called. The keyword REBOOT isn't necessary as Setpatch does the
needed reset for BPPCfix.

...
;Begin elimination of ppc.library
BPPCfix >NIL: install
;End elimination of ppc.library 

SetPatch
...

The variable "terminator" has to be set to 2 when BPPCfix shall be used to
avoid problems.
These are my settings of the variables in ENV:PowerPC:

debug            0
earlyterm        0
force            1
gfxaddr          $e0000000        (only needed if using a BVisionPPC)
hidewarning      0
memprot          0
nopatch          1
noppc            0
seginfo          100
terminator       2

This works on my system. Others may comment if something's wrong or missing.
Hope this helps.

You'd better set it to 0 or 1 if you use BPPCFix with PPCLibEmu.

Terminator must never be "2" if you intend to use ppclibemu. "0"
or "1" is ok. "2" is only needed when BPPCFix isn't used, to remove
original PowerUp from the system.

After reading your first mail I was thinking of improper setting of memmode:
try to set the access to the memory to 70ns if it has been set to 60ns.
Another cause of problem: Overheating of your PPC or insufficient Power to
the PPC board: try to feed the A1200 Mother Board using the Floppy
connector on the mother board, as recommended by Phase5.

Hello,

I´m a new member because I was linked with my problem (hope it isn´t) from the
AmigaOS39-ml to this one. 

The following Problem has happened to me two times in the last three days.
The second time happened on same running config but without running YAM, so it
seems to me to be a prob with Miami, AWeb or DOpus.
Please take notice of that when reading my easy forwarded mail, also that I
never had seen such an output like this before. My system runs very very
stable. Please touch on three times on wood. So I am very interested in this
new "feature".

--- Weitergeleitete Nachricht folgt (forwarded)   ---

is anyone able to cleare, what following WarpOS5.0-output is saying and of what
I have to take notice from?

MiamiDX, YAM v2.2, AWeb v3.4 was running under AOS v3.9 with DOpus v.5.82 as
WBR.
I updated to WarpUp v5.0/PowerPC.library v16 (no ppc.library!).
FlashUpdate-Version is 44.69 (inofficial released by Ralph Schmidt in
October 2000).

I just was editing a mail-form in AWeb and on send AWeb freezes with busy
pointer. I was able to change the screens, but not to close YAM or Miami. Miami
could not be opened from AppIcon, shows only an opened, but empty MUI-Screen.

It was the first time I crashed in this way with Miami, I think, and the very
first time with an output from WarpOS shown as:

@NODE "Mail_54" " [warpup] Re: BlizzardPPC SCSI Problem! HELP!!! "
From: Mark Olsen <BIGFoot@Private.dk>
Date: 01-12-01 20:12:31
Subject: @{b}[warpup] Re: BlizzardPPC SCSI Problem! HELP!!!@{ub}

Hello,

I´m a new member because I was linked with my problem (hope it isn´t) from the
AmigaOS39-ml to this one. 

The following Problem has happened to me two times in the last three days.
The second time happened on same running config but without running YAM, so it
seems to me to be a prob with Miami, AWeb or DOpus.
Please take notice of that when reading my easy forwarded mail, also that I
never had seen such an output like this before. My system runs very very
stable. Please touch on three times on wood. So I am very interested in this
new "feature".

--- Weitergeleitete Nachricht folgt (forwarded)   ---

is anyone able to cleare, what following WarpOS5.0-output is saying and of what
I have to take notice from?

MiamiDX, YAM v2.2, AWeb v3.4 was running under AOS v3.9 with DOpus v.5.82 as
WBR.
I updated to WarpUp v5.0/PowerPC.library v16 (no ppc.library!).
FlashUpdate-Version is 44.69 (inofficial released by Ralph Schmidt in
October 2000).

I just was editing a mail-form in AWeb and on send AWeb freezes with busy
pointer. I was able to change the screens, but not to close YAM or Miami. Miami
could not be opened from AppIcon, shows only an opened, but empty MUI-Screen.

It was the first time I crashed in this way with Miami, I think, and the very
first time with an output from WarpOS shown as:

Recent news has it that the PowerPC 7450 G4+ is now in production. With the
coming AmigaOne upgrades sporting a standard ZIF connector, would it be
insane to buy a G4+ 733MHz module for it when released? Or might there be

the problem with the SCSI not wirking is that the board has 2 ICs
(regulators) which don't work properly and I'm looking for them. Sadly,
I couldn't find them here in Mex.City  so I'm willing to get them in
some store on the Net. Can anyone give me good advise about this? Where

My icq locks when using my ioblix ethernet card. I think it's ahi as every program that uses ahi
locksup/freezes. If i listen to a tune and connect i see every ahi program lockup.
If i login first and open an ahi program it locks.

It looks that it has something to do that when connection with ioblixethernet my ahi gets locked and
the first thing icq is doing is opening a start sound which doesn't play. so it locks.

I tryed with amplifier, playgui etc and all of them uses ahi and every program locks. 
What can be wrong ? i can play sounds directly to paula.

Hi. I recomended ioblix ethernet card for a week ago. 

Yes it works better with the new drivers but i have problems with the connection to adsl.
Too low cps and often nothing at all. Like it's stuck in a loop or something.

But i don't want to make others afradi now of this. Maybe my ioblix card is fault or something else.
I got a new ethernet module for ioblix for testing but the same problems. My friend tested with
his X-Surf. It's flying , high cps as it should.

So i don't know. I hope that my dealer gets new ioblix cards so i can test if mine is damaged.
If i get it to work i will tell you.
