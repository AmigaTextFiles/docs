"Bankruptcy Isle"
Set to the theme song of "Gilligans Isle"

The Music
---------
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
  a tale of a fateful trip.
That's ended in the tropic courts,
  about a sinking ship.
The mate was Medhi Ali "the man",
  the skipper, Irving Gould.
Amiga owners wondered that day,
  if Commodore was doomed, if Commodore was doomed.
The rumors started getting rough,
  "Samsung?!" they finally scoffed.
If not for the courage of it's fearless users,
  the Amiga would be lost; the Amiga would be lost.
The Amiga in the courts of the sunny bahamian isles,
  with Dave Pleasance, the creditors too,
  the Millionaire, Irving Gould,
  Medhi Ali, bids from Samsung and C.E.I.,
  here on Bankruptcy Isle.
 
The Ending
----------
 
So this is the tale of our castaways,
  no news for a long long time.
They'll have to wait some more for now,
  to find out the buyer.
Dave plesence and his backers too,
  will do their very best,
to resurrect the amiga,
  from its tropic island nest.
No phones, no lights, no circuit boards,
  not after bankruptcy.
Like Machintosh computers,
  it's primitive as can be.
So join us here each week my friend,
  you're sure to wait some more.
From seven million castaways,
  Here on Bankruptcy Isle.
