DOCUMENT: AINU.TXT


           A STATEMENT OF OPINION REGARDING THE PARTIAL
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               REVISION OF I.L.O. CONVENTION NO. 107
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                By The Ainu Association of Hokkaido

THE POSITION OF THE AINU PEOPLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The Japanese Government ratified in 1979 the International 
Covenants on Human Rights (except for the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) to which it 
had not committed itself for a long time, but has officially 
stated to the international community that no ethnic minorities of 
the kind mentioned in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights exist in Japan (see the attached material).

     On the other hand, while some advanced industrial nations, in 
establishing themselves as modern states have dealt rather 
reasonably with ethnic problems as an important question which 
cannot be neglected, in Japan it is a fact that both the 
Government itself and the people have had a vague "consciousness" 
that there are no ethnic problems within Japan.  This might 
possibly be because the Ainu, the indigenous people, did not show 
strong enough resistance in the modernization process after the 
Meiji Restoration (in 1868).

     As a matter of fact, however, we, the indigenous and ethnic 
minority people, called the Ainu, (several tens of thousands of 
us) exist.  Moreover, this people's own language, culture, life-
customs, and so on are still retained.

     This Association has petitioned and demanded both the 
Hokkaido prefectural and the national governments to repeal the 
Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act enacted in 1899 (see the 
attached material) and pass the "New Act" which will be firmly 
established in behalf of the Ainu people (see the attached 
material), and furthermore has been carrying on an extensive 
campaign in order to obtain the understanding of the Japanese 
people, based on the fundamental notion that it is necessary to 
establish the institutions which will be predicated on the 
recovery of the rights of the Ainu as a people, and which will 
enable such drastic and comprehensive measures as the elimination 
of racial discrimination, the promotion of ethnic education, the 
measures for economic self-sustenance, etc.


APPEALS TO THE UNITED NATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Because it was necessary to change the attitude that the 
Japanese Government had taken toward its ethnic policy, this 
organization requested the U.N. Centre for Human Rights for an 
investigation in our letter of 25 November, 1986.  We also sent 
three representatives from this Association to participate for the 
first time in the U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Populations (a 
working group under the Sub-Commission on Prevention of 
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities) which was held in 
Geneva, Switzerland from 3 to 5 August, 1987, and we made a 
statement concerning the problems of the Ainu people in Japan, 
seeking understanding.


THE MOVEMENT TOWARD REVISION OF I.L.O. CONVENTION NO. 107
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     This Association learned for the first time about the 
movement concerning the revision of ILO Convention No. 107 through 
its presentation at the above U.N. Working Group on Indigenous 
Populations.  Returning home even without a full understanding of 
its contents, our organization immediately began studying about 
how to cope with it.  But we have not reached any specific 
conclusions at this stage, and, therefore, would like to confine 
ourselves to some basic ideas concerning the views requested by 
the Deputy Vice-Minister about the questions in the Report.


1.  OPINION ON THE DEFINITION OF THE OBJECT

     We interpret the indigenous populations (translated 
officially as GENJUMIN) in this Convention as the aboriginal 
populations (translated as DOCHAKUMIN).  Because this group of 
people who, living in Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuriles as the 
AINU MOSHIRI (the earth where the Ainu live), has possessed its 
own language, culture and life-customs and has established its own 
history, is the Ainu people and at the same time is also the 
aboriginal people, and because we still exist today, we believe 
that we belong as an object of this Convention.

     Note:  The existing Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection 
            Act, the Kuriles-Sakhalin Exchange Treaty, etc. are 
            the very proofs of the above point.


2.  OPINION ON ASSIMILATION

     We, as the Ainu people, also oppose any international 
convention or domestic law which holds an assimilationist program 
as its basic orientation, and believe that the rights to control 
our own economic, social, cultural and other aspects of 
development as much as possible, to stand equal based on our own 
institutions, and to mutually cooperate with the national society 
should be recognized.


3.  OPINION ON THE REVISION

     As stated in item 2 above, this existing Convention holds 
integrationism as its basic principle and aims at the protection 
of the populations concerned, which is undoubtedly an archaic 
idea, and the application of this principle is destructive.  We, 
therefore, believe that the Convention should be revised in favor 
of the respect for identity being its fundamental idea.

     This applies to the Ainu people in Japan, too.  For, as 
stated previously, the group that, originally living in Hokkaido, 
Sakhalin, and the Kuriles as the AINU MOSHIRI (the earth where the 
Ainu live), possesses its own language and culture, has engaged in 
a common economic life, and has established its own history, is 
the Ainu people.

     We retained our independence as a people while fighting the 
unjust aggression and oppression brought on by the Tokugawa 
shogunate government and the Matsumae Clan.

     However, the Japanese Government, which through the Meiji 
Restoration made the first step toward a modern unified state, 
annexed the AINU MOSHIRI to the Japanese territory without any 
negotiations with the Ainu people, who were the indigenous people 
there.  By concluding the Kuriles-Sakhalin Exchange Treaty with 
Imperial Russia, they also forced the Ainu to give up our rightful 
land where we had existed in peace.

     On the other hand, with the increase of Japanese immigrants 
into Hokkaido, terrible reckless development began, which 
threatened the very existence of the Ainu people.  Furthermore, 
the enactment of the Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act in 
1899, with its purpose being assimilation, tied the Ainu down to 
the land granted by the government, thereby reducing the freedom 
of residence and the freedom to choose an occupation other than 
agriculture.  And in the field of education, the law trampled down 
the dignity of our people's own language.

     Today, it is said that the Ainu living in Hokkaido are 
several tens of thousands, and those outside the prefecture are 
several thousand.  Many of them do not have the security of equal 
opportunity in finding a job because of unjust racial prejudice 
and discrimination.  They form a potential group of unemployed, 
and their life is always unstable.

     The present situation is that discrimination increases 
poverty, which in turn causes still further discrimination, 
resulting in the widening gaps in social and economic status.

     This Association, therefore, has stood up to demand the 
enactment of the "New Act" which regards the respect for the Ainu 
people's identity as its fundamental principle.


4.  OPINION ON RATIFICATION

     The labour-related laws and regulations in Japan have made 
great strides since the end of WWII.  If international labour 
conventions and recommendations form the foundation of the 
drafting of such legislation, we believe that the revised 
Convention ought to be ratified and that the corresponding 
domestic laws be coordinated accordingly.

     Note:  What this Association is demanding as the domestic law 
            is the "New Act".


5.  A SUPPLEMENTARY OPINION

     Although this time we have been invited to submit our opinion 
in accordance with the suggestion of Report VI (1) for the 75th 
Session of the ILO Conference, we would like to state as our 
supplementary opinion that in regard to consultations on this 
matter, the Government should not restrict them to this time alone 
but should always hold them on a continuing basis whenever 
necessity requires it.
