Do you know what the results from the scanner head on the 4300 are like
compared to a decent flatbed, as I'm looking for a new colour printer and
thought this maybe a nice extra to have.

I'm not sure if it was meant just for Christmas/newyears day. . . I
would call customer services to check. . .

It does say "this excludes DATA calls" in real tiny letters. That
means the answer to your question is yes for those days.. . .I'm
unsure about all next year.

I wrote digital when I should have wrote data. ofcourse a modem
transmition is analogue, so it wouldn't be counted digital, but DATA
it surely is.

Expect to pay upwards of 6000 pounds per year. The price depends on
the speed of the line, your geographic location, and the company
that you rent from. A while ago a friend of mine got a "bargain" at
only 75,000 per year for a 2Mb line.

Hi Everybody,

   Do you mean like an AVI file etc. inbeded in an avi player? I don't
think one exists to rip anims from EXEs, but you could try finding the
inbeded avi etc. with a hex editor.

   You could actually try the anim in the amiga anim, as I know that PC
self-extracting LHAs can be dearchived with Amiga Lha.


See ya.

Yes and no. What you need is a coder (both PC- and Amiga-) of Very Big Brain.
This is because you'll have no idea about the file format & how the image
data is arranged without having to disassemble the original EXE file and, by
looking at those assembly language instructions, figure it all out. And each
file will have a totally different system.

I'd do it if I knew x86 assembly language.

If it doesn\t break anything else I'd love to see that. Speaking of hardware
locks...did Commodore in their infinitive wisdom do something special
regarding the key-locks on the 3000T and 4000 machines or is it easy to
replace it with a standard lock from a PC-case? I just got myself a used
3000T without a key to the lock. Okay, I have the lock completely
disabled so the machine works without it but I'd like it to work.

Well, if you are to play with hardware I think it would be better to make some
kind of EEPROM which could be placed at $F00000. With a proper setup (such as
$1114 marker at start) such an EEPROM would be accessed at each boot, so you
can place some security code there (kinda PC's BIOS). It is much more complex
to design and build than your proposition but looks more professional and gives
better security. And I think it could become quite successful product (I'd
like to buy one for sure).

Christmas and New years day didn't have the 50p offer unlike
last year, it was only 1 p per minuite long distance, so i really
hope you didn't stay on for hours thinking it was :)

Well i phoned C&W on thursday after hours of it being busy and
charging me for letting me know it was busy and i was in a que.
Anyway they said the 50p saturday offer is now a permanent
feature and I asked if it included data calls for the internet to
the internets longs distance numbers (ie not, 0345 0845 etc)
and they said that was ok. So... there you have it.

Merry Christmas 2000 :)

From: The LOGIC's <The-Logics@usa.net>

Hi:

I have a dealer here with a Seagate scsi Barracuda 4.3Gb 80 pins port, i
found the drive in the Seagate page and say the max transfer is 20Mb/sec.
It's similar to the 68 Uw pins port but with the power connection in the
same port.

Anyone know if these Hds are really 20Mb/sec fast?? Or are too old??

                                           Bye, Gonzalo. The LOGIC's
                                              The-Logics@usa.net

Try something else in the slot first,
    like a memory card or a surf squirrel.

AFTER installing the correct software (none for memory card)
if nothing is working I would guess you have a dead PCM CIA port. 

Otherwise, check your setup,

Subject: [just-amiga] busted bloodnet disks 4,8,9&11 ;(

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   My hd installation of 'Bloodnet' just got corrupted, and when I tried
to re-install it I found that my disk 4,8,9 and 11 were full of errors.

   Could someone please send me a DMS/ADF of the formentioned disks.

You can use 'ADFBlitzer' on Aminet.


   I would apreciate any help ;)


See ya.

I would go for the canon 4300. Canon support the amiga, they will give you
drivers for it, a gfx publishing program and some other stuff. plus you can
buy a scanning print head which is supported in turbo print 6 (or 7?) but
either way i would look for an amiga dealer who will bundle the printer
together with TP6 because it vastly improves the printout anyway.

Subject: [just-amiga] 16 AB3d2 replacement levels uploaded to Aminet

From: Mike <mike@mikech.demon.co.uk>


Just a quick note to let anyone who's interested know that I have uploaded a
set of sixteen new levels for Alien Breed 3D2 to Aminet:

game/data/AB3d2_XC.lha (968 008 bytes)

Mostly AB3d2 graphics/aliens/weapons but some old friends from AB3d1, some
new stuff.
Flare laser to light up dark areas. Mini Rocket Launcher. Lots of water.
Gothic horror intro texts...

Easy installation.

Have fun

Wrong, .wav files can be 8 Bit as well, it just not that popular.  PC
users are just to lazy to convert it to 8 Bit version.  

I use SoundConver.  If you want to make 8 Bit Versions of the file
first save it as 8SVX (IFF) sample.  Then Get SoundConvert will change
it to a Wav file, an _8 Bit .Wav_ file at that, cool!  So being half
the size.

I don't know the exact mouse you are talking about but its my guess
that its connected with Golden Image the company, if it is then why not
give them a call as they are probably your best bet :

0181 900 9291

If not i'm sure someone will have a good old moan to say i've messed
up yet again :)

Happy..... damn nothing to be happy about now :(

In English that means make sure its 25 Pin (Amiga serial port) and
not the daft 9 pin PC com port type which its more likely to be from a
PC store.

The best bet would be to try some place like Computer City in
Holland as that is quite close to Belgium, It distributes AIO BTW :)

You can phone them on : +31 10 4517722
or email : info@compcity.nl

You could even hop the border and visit the shop itself at :

Computer City, Zebrastraat 7-9, NL 3064 LR, Rotterdam.

Hope they can help!

yeah, thats it, i couldn't remember how many pins ;)

oh and btw, why doesn't someone make a mouse driver which works with pc
mice, plugged into the normal mouse port? all the pins are there, all ti
would take is a bit of software instead of all these slow hacks :/

I don't think this would really make much difference, you aren't
distributing AIO through your web site or email address, apart
from boosting your web site visits and email inbox i can't see any
advantage for AIO ;)

I don't think there would be a command for the actual slot being working
but you can type 'info' in cli to see if CD0: exisits.

Which AD? if you mean the bits between the long lines then it is not
possible
as far as I know, if it was then how do you think Onelist would be
funded?
If they didn't advertise then they wouldn't exist and neither would many
hundreds of thousands of list. If you are being so small minded about the
small 1 line AIO advert then thats my choice and there is a simple
answer,
you can always go click unsubscribe.

Subject: [just-amiga] Filesystems on the RDB

From: Stephen Williams <sw@nysa.u-net.com>

Hi all

A couple of questions about the RDB:

1.  Why is it necessary to install FastFileSystem on the RDB?  I thought
FFS was held in ROM.

2.  If I buy PFS2 and install it on my RDB, will I need to put a copy in
L: as well if I want disks other than my hard drive to be able to use
it?

TIA.

Someone made a piece of hardware which does that.  IIRC it was called a
"Topolino", and got a good review in CU Amiga.  I never saw it
advertised anywhere though.  Anyone know if they still exist, and are
available?

Only if you wish to use a newer version of FFS than the one in the ROM.
Otherwise you don't need to install it in the RDB.

Although I haven't tried PFS, I would say so, yes.

No, sorry, I have a 4200, and my mate has a 4300 and a flatbed scanner and a

Subject: [just-amiga] Converting IFF audio files to .wav or .au files

From: Wayne Pyrah <wpp@WAYNE-PYRAH.freeserve.co.uk>

Hi All + Happy New Year !

I need to find a program to convert IFF files to .wav or .au files for some fairly big (1.5MB +) audio tracks I want to put on my website.

Does anyone have any suggestions ?
My setup is A1200 '020 @ 25Mhz with 6MB of memory.

Also does anyone know of any free html writing software because as you have probably seen from my website I only know the absolute basics!!!.  I have tried WebPlug but It didn't work very well.
 
Regards, + W A Y N E +

You should be aware of the fact that .wav and .au are 16bit formats, so the
files will become twice as big as they are in the iff format. I don't know of
any program, but you can find out about the file formats at www.wotsit.org
(very good site actually, huge collection of file format specs!).

Why not just use a text editor to write your html or maybe WebDesign from
Aminet. Also check out #AmigaUni#  for the HTML tutorial that is just
beginning.

The latest FFS's are not in the ROM, so you have to have them somewhere :)

Like for floppies? Yes. You might want to bare in mind that the space in
the RDB is limited, and you might have to delete FFS... but you won't want
to use FFS, so I doubt that will be a problem ;)

Not  sure  about a shell command but if you run the "PrepCard" program
from  Workbench:Tools/  it'll  let  you  know the status of the PCMCIA
port.

If  there  is  nothing there then it just says "No Card Inserted".  It
doesn't  recognise  my  Squirrel  but  it  does  say format and device
"Unknown", which proves it acknowledges there is a device connected to
the slot.

Hope this is some help! :)

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: Filesystems on the RDB

From: Stephen Williams <sw@nysa.u-net.com>

Re

Another RDB question: my HDD's RDB is 34,816 bytes in size.  Some
custom file systems are longer than this.  If I try to install one of
these on my RDB, will it all break?

Try Sox on Aminet.  It's a Unix port, so the command line syntax is
fairly obscure, but it'll convert between a lot of sample formats,
including .IFF, .AIFF, .WAV and .AU.

.AU can have u-law compression, it encodes 16-bit samples logarithmically
into 8-bits, so you can have a 16-bit sample in half the space.  It's
a bit lossy, of course, but sounds pretty good (to me).

AFAIK .WAV doesn't have to be 16-bit, you can have 8-bit ones, so your
.IFF samples won't "grow" when converted to .WAVs.  In fact, they might
get a bit shorter, as the .WAV header is a bit smaller.

Well, Antonio *does* need to watch his quoting, but to be honest, Colin
really needs to shrink that sig to four or five lines. Yours could use a
trim as well, BTW (nine lines before the onelist ad).

    I will assume that you are using FFS at present, and have heard all the
hoo-hah about PFS2 lately.  Well first of all,  technically you will not
"break" things if you change the filesystem and consequently the RDB.  But
if you are going to play around with your RDB then you will have to backup
your data.  Since the RDB contains the information for the filesystem on
how to read the drive, and when you change filesystems you change the way
that the data is read off the drive, or more precisely, the way that data
is written to the drive (same thing really).  So what happens is that the
data that was there under the old filesystem is no longer readable, imagine
giving an English speaking person a book in German or some other language. 
And the new RDB block size will fit (i refer to PFS).  I most definitely
recommend an installation of PFS2, especially if you are using IDE drives.
Just don't forget those backups.

    Your first question has been answered so i will not bother with it.  The
short version is that any filesystem has a handler file in L: you will
notice FastFileSystem is there.  But for each HD unit that uses PFS2 you
will have to install it on its RDB.  I mean each HD unit not each
partition.

I too would recommend PFS2, especially for Zip drives which under FFS are 
very slow in comparison.

And don't do what I did. Backup hd4: and then promptly install PFS2 on HD3: 
by mistake. Apart from losing a few games that I installed again it did not 
matter much. I was very careful with my other partitions after that !

no, read the original question again, I /*DON'T*/ want an addon, I want a
piece of sodtware which will allow me to plug the pc serial mouse into my
normal mouse port, afterall, they are both the same, if not then how about
the joystick port?

Subject: [just-amiga] Picture Viewers

From: Colin Wenzel <colstv@hotkey.net.au>


I would like to get peoples opinion of the Text Viewer situation..

I have a standard AGA / 15Khz Monitor  setup on my A4000T.
Up to now, I have been using ViewTek v2.1  (17-Feb-94)
for viewing picture files. 

Also I use it as a tool for various mime types in IBrowse.
 
I have PPaint & ImageFx etc....   but just to view the odd gif or jpg
I use VT,  but,  since it has not been updated since 94 I am finding
some jpg files it won't  display...  

It says "unsuported SOF marker type 0x00"   I dont know why, but things
like PPaint & ImageFx have no problem...

I tried using multiview, but the pictures look awfull & it 
'blows up' the size of the image without asking &
makes it look damn terrible, with blotchy backgrounds etc.

Not to mention that it takes up to 5 seconds before the picture appears
& thats on a 50Mhz 060 with 150 Meg of ram......

So,  what image viewer will do what VT does.....   

Please don't say FastJPG, FastGIF etc....   I want one program
that will show virtually anything from an IFF to a GIF anim.....

.....AND do it properly.....

Any suggestions.....  ?

That would be very difficult seeing the Amiga ports are essentially 
parallel I/O and not serial ! Without additional hardware there is no way 
just software could get around this.

   No, I think it would be impossible to use the amiga game ports for a
serial mouse. You'll have to get a 9 -> 25 pin serial adapter, and I
think there may be some programs to use serial mice on aminet.

Subject: [just-amiga] Pace 56 Solo owners - Beta testers required

From: "Oliver Roberts" <oliver.roberts@iname.com>

If you own a Pace 56 Solo modem, then read on...

I am in the process of porting Pace's 56 Solo firmware/flash upgrader
to the Amiga (previously only available for Windows).  Although it already
appears to work without problems on my system, I need a group of users to
test it for me to make sure there are no compatibility or other problems,
before it is released.

Requirements:

 1. You will obviously need to have a Pace 56 Solo modem.
 2. An Amiga equipped with at least a 68020 and 2Mb free ram.
 3. A backup modem or easy access to a PC capable of running the PC version
    of the Pace 56 Solo upgrade package.  This is necessary in the unlikely
    case of the Amiga upgrader trashing your Solo (i.e. hasn't happened to
    me, yet).
 4. You will need to run the Amiga upgrader and report back to me with
    any problems that your encounter.

If you are interested in beta testing the Amiga upgrader, please mail me
*directly* with the following information:

  - Your name and e-mail address
  - Amiga Model (e.g. A1200)
  - CPU/Speed (e.g. 68060/50 + PPC 603e/240)
  - Total Memory (e.g. 16Mb)
  - Serial Port Type (e.g. internal, Surf Squirrel, Whippet, HyperCOM, etc)
  - if using the internal serial port, specify which device driver you use
    when using your Solo (e.g. serial.device, artser.device, etc)
  - Current firmware version of your Pace 56 Solo modem (can be checked with
    the ATI4 command via a terminal program)

Would've been worse if the ports were serial and the mouse you were trying to
plug into them was parallel. I'm using my joystick port for serial transfers
to my TI-83 calculator, with just some wires (hmm allright, some diodes
aswell, but they could probably be made redundant) and homemade software.

PrepCard is perfect for finding if your Amiga recognises anything in the PCMCIA
socket.

When I got my Squirrel my 1200 wouldn't recognise the existence of the Squirrel
or the CD - it turns out that the pins in the PCMCIA socket were slightly bent.
You'll need to get them straightened (this may be difficult as the socket is
sealed internally so you can't easily access the pins).

Alternatively, if the pins are bent, you could swap the motherboard of your 1200
with your brothers one when he goes out. Like I did :)

Just go to any pc store and ask them for a null modem cable this should be
what you need. But make sure it is the wide variety, not the tiddly ones

It may adapt to fit - PFS can be used on zips so I`m sure it`ll fit on
your harddrive.

^^^^
Do you really mean that?

Try using datatypes - there should be an argument for this.  I can't
remember the one at the moment and am too idle to go look.  I use Visage
myself as it's much quicker for most files.

Subject: [just-amiga] Hard drive querie

From: "Terry Davis" <Terry@fuchsia.prestel.co.uk>

Hi
I have just spent about five hours with the prospect of loosing all
the data on my hard drive. The panic is now over. But here is a
question. I have a not yet towered A1200 with a Magnum 68030/40 with
mmu, 170mb hard drive with 18mb RAM. A CD Rom drive with an IDE
buffered interface and IDEfix. The only way I can back up at the
moment is to floppies, which because of the number of discs and the
time involved often gets neglected
Is there a cheap and easy way to add another hard drive that can be
mainly used to back up the main one.
I also have an A500 with WB 3.1 and an Alphapower 250mb hard drive.
Is it possible to link the two computers so that I can use the
250mb as backup.
Sorry to ramble on but any advice would be much appreciated.
Thanks . Happy new year.
Terry..

G'day Chris ,
                     Best of Seasons greatings. Hope all is going well. Was
here until I started having computer problems. Anyway just a quick
question. I noticed that the details on where to get AIO releases is a bit
sketchy at some HQ's eg I also have a home page, Email address etc that may
help.

What do you think ? Just an Idea . 8-)

Kind regards

Presumably they're either more recent or are using your datatypes, and the
datatypes are more recent (but I'm no expert!)

Using the SCREEN tooltype or arguement with Multiview avoids this - it
opens on its own screen.

Someone recommended Visage - I would agree. I think there's a new program
called SuperView which you could look at too, but I have only read about it.
I think its on aminet. Visage does everything anyway I think.

/me checks...

Erm, my .sig is 1 line longer than yours, and isn't filled with useless
info like "Time", and "Written using THOR.... Regisered User Number..." ;)

Besides, a single blank line takes up 1 LF, length doesn't matter, content
does :)

If the main harddrive is a 3.5" drive it's easy. Buy a 2.5" -> 2*3.5" IDE-cable,
jumper one harddrive to master and the other to slave. Fire up HD-toolbox and
make the necessary changes on the new harddrive. Save changes, reboot and format
the new drive. Away you go.

These are progressive JPEG's as used on some web sites. Some viewers
can display these and others can't i.e. PPShow. Visage however works
well and after a bit of fiddling with it's mass of options works very
well for 99% of all the JPEG's, GIF's, etc. you're ever likely to
encounter.

Both ImageFX & PPaint use their own loaders and don't rely on
Workbench datatypes.

Make sure you have the latest akJPEG datatype as this works with both
normal and progressive JPEG's. Aminet util/dtype somwhere.

Subject: [just-amiga] Printers -- Epson or Canon

From: Jerry Leik <jdleik@voyager.net>

Hi,
   I'm looking at the possibility of getting a new printer, and was
wondering if anyone could provide some input on the decision.
   I want something that will produce acceptable documents on either my
Amiga or a Linux (x86) system.
   I've had a Canon BJ-200e for the last 5 years, which has just died on me,
and was wondering whether to stick with Canon or try one of the low/mid
range of Epson printers.


   Any help is appreciated....

    To link both computers i would recommend Parnet or MagicParNet (which i
think from memory is a newer version of the first).  This uses the parallel
ports of both computers to transfer data, and the speed is quite decent,
about 3 times faster than using a null modem connection (from memory). 
Although you will have to cut open the parallel cable and splice two wires
over, all of this is clearly explained in the dox.  But if you are a lazy
sod or are hopeless with these kinds of things then just get hold of a
null-modem cable and use a terminal program (like term) on each computer to
transfer stuff.  If you use the null modem option then don't forget to set
the null modem option in the terminal program prefs.

Sometime isn't very difficult to use.
For example I've converted A-Team.AU to A-Team.WAV with
the command: sox020 A-Team.AU A-Team.WAV.
Of course if you want there are a lot of powerful options for
advanced users.

Yes, and is sold from a german company, Vesalia.
My friend bought Topolino for his A4000, and can use a
Logitec mouse without any problems.
And is a new version of Topolino, enhanced.
There's a page on the net with a picture of the new Topolino
and the specs of it.
I want to buy it, so I can buy a lot of mice for nothing. :)

I have an Epson Stylus 800 model, and I find it very good, for graphics =
and
text.  I do not pretend to be an expert, but I do type and print a lot.  =
The
drivers (from Aminet) work well.  Check them out, and I hope this helps =

    Just a note about the ak-jfif datatype, i don't know about anyone else,
and i would like some feedback on this please, but the ak-jfif datatype
does not work well with some other programs.  For example WebTV and Stricq
(the opening window with the logo in it), everything appears to be working
fine, except that when the image is displayed it comes up all black.  Also
if anyone knows why this is enlighten me please.  I seem to remember it
causing problems with some other programs aswell, but since i have not used
it in a long time i can't remember.  Anyway, for a datatype to view jpg
images i suggest u get #JFIFdt44.lha#, and also there is no need to
register it.

    I'll make this short, do a search on Aminet for AmiSOX, download the GUI
for it aswell, this will make life a lot easier.  BTW AmiSOX will convert
*ANY* sound format.

I seem to remember seeing something about this on one of the
newsgroups, and if memory serves me correctly this problem is related
to GFX cards either Picasso or Cybergraphics. Sorry I can't recall the
exact but maybe someone else can be of help here.

I just got a Epson 740 about a month and a half ago and I like it
very well. I use it on my A-4000. There are no drivers yet for
it, but I used ESCUtil to set it up with EpsonP2 mode on the
system printer right now. In PageStream I am using Epson Stylus Pro
or Color II emulation and getting very good prints. I used to have 
an HP550 and this E740 beats it in every way. I especially like the
straight through paper feed. The E740 also feeds any size
envelope or paper up to about 9.5" wide. It also has a lever to
move the printhead away from the paper so you can feed thicker
paper.

I have been able to set the system printer to print 84 characters
wide because the 740 will print to about one character width from
both edges instead of the 1/4" of my old HP550.

Direct printing from the computer is very quick and clean print.
I am looking forward to getting a driver to print the full
1440x720 instead of a max of 720x720.

Hope this helps.

   No, I know why that is. Its just because its an un-supported type of
JPEG. The AK datatypes can load them no problems, but ViewTek doesn't
like them.

See ya.

Subject: [just-amiga] Downloading files

From: Mike <mike@mikech.demon.co.uk>


Can anyone suggest a reason why HTTPResume downloads files far better than
IBrowse? HTTPResume is a great little prog that will resume downloading a
file when the connection broke part way through. It only downloads the
remaining part of the file. (Its on Aminet)

Anyway, IBrowse takes AGES to download anything, and I now tend to initiate
the download in IBrowse, abort it immediately and pick up where I left off
with HTTPResume because its much quicker!

I've fiddled with everything in IBrowse I can think of but it makes no
difference, and defies logic. We're talking downloading the same file from
the same site at the same time (not simultaneously, but at the same time ie.
variation in internet traffic is not a factor). IBrowse crawls, HTTPResume
just does it. Any ideas why?

Cheers
Mike Child

PS I have an 060 so it's not extra load on the processor in IBrowse, and its
the same whether I continue browsing or just wait for IBrowse to download.

correction, they are /capable/ of 16-bit, you can still record and play them
at 8 bit if you want

as long as you don't format the drive, you can still select the old

A big thankyou to everyone who has replied to my question - I don't know what I would do without these mailing lists!

I have downloaded most of the programs people suggested and am going to give them all a try to see which one I prefer.  I will keep you updated.

I am going to give html a try without using a special program as reccomended on this list.  Can anyone reccomend a good basic beginners book.

Thanks again, + W A Y N E +

   Well, I use IBrowe to download stuff, and HTTPResume if it gets
interupted, and I havn't noticed a difference with the download times
using both programs. 

   I guess it could be your server setup. (higher priority on resume
calls?).

See ya.

Yeah, well, I guess I forgot about that :)  But, it's not relevant anyway

The best thing you can ever do, is to look at what others have created. Try
Document/Display Source in IBrowse (or just right-click on the html display
and select View Source). And try searching for html tutorials on altavista.

book.

I bought _HTML 4 For the World Wide Web by Elizabeth Castro_, dunno if you
can get it where you are, but it is excellent for beginners, is reasonably
priced and has website support aswell.  Also it tells you what commands are
exclusive to netscape or Microsoft Explorer.  The book is not biased
towards any particular browser or platform.

Just a few thoughts/facts :-

1. httpresume does not use your proxy servers
2. is IB using your proxy servers ? If so try disabling them.

From: Cameron Lister <cameronl@astra.global.net.uk>

Hi y'all,

I've been lurking on the list for a couple of weeks now so thought it best
that I make my presence known :-)

At 22:18 05/01/99 +0000, Wayne wrote:

As I have actually written two full CD-ROM works using HTML, I would
seriously agree with other suggestions that you use a simple text editor
and a decent book.  I have yet to see any HTML designer on any system that
does nothing but ruin your hard crafted handiwork.  In fact, I have tried
over a dozen systems and not one came up with legal HTML and/or without
filling the file out with pointless code.  I hoped to use one to add image
maps and other more complicated layouts easily but gave in when I found
myseld spending more time deleting <font></font> etcs all over the place,
than it would have taken to write the code myself!

My personal "bible" is the Platinum Edition Using HTML 3.2, Java 1.1 and
CGI by Que.  Your local P(spit)C World should have a copy.  It is VERY
expensive (I picked it up at the discount price of 40 UK pounds) and all
the software included is for the PC.  However, it is a truly massive hard
back tome with just about everything you could ever want to know about HTML
and includes some very useful features about the style and layout of web
sites, details that most other works seem to ignore.  Advice on registering
with search engines and other topics should also save you a lot of money if
you have ever been tempted by the spam mail offering these services.

Having said that, you may be better off picking up a simpler book that does
not include the java or cgi elements as these are not essential,
particularly on the Amiga at the moment.  The main point is that it should
include details of how to set up frames properly as this is possibly the
most difficult part of site design to set up correctly.  A good point is to
find quality websites and see how they achieve the effects they have.
Personal home pages are usually best as corporate web sites are normally
designed by business suits who think that using massive plugins and flash
graphics are a good idea.

As for software, I use Wordpad on the PC (apologies for swearing), and
CygnusEd Pro on the Amiga.  I believe this is now being commercially
distributed once again and it is definitely the best text processor I have
ever seen.  The macro facilities are breathtaking and better than anything
the PC has to offer.

In fact, when I have to change a lot of files, I connect my PC up to my
Amiga and use networking software to load the files into CEd, use the macro
facility to automatically make changes, and then save them back to the PC.
I also have a "master" list of each file in each project and have written
small macros that can load in the next file with a single keypress, without
even needing to use a file requester.  This has saved me literally
thousands of hours over the last two years.

I also use DOpus 5.5 to move files around my PC and scan in all my graphics
on my Amiga first before moving them to the PC (I only have a 68030
processor and so the Pentium beats it hands down for speed when working
with JPGs).

One final point is that if you are putting up a web site, if at all
possible you should test it out with a PC using Navigator or IE 3 (IE 4 has
trashed my PC hard drive twice, the first time catastrophically as it also
corrupted my backups, so I would not suggest my worst enemy use it!)

The reason for this is entirely practical.  No two browsers work alike and
I found that, despite working perfectly on Navigator, and on demo versions
of IBrowse, AWeb, and Voyager, all my files with the command <br
clear="left"> did not work correctly on IE.  The easy solution would be to
blame Microsoft (it IS their fault) but you have to bear in mind that a
vast amount of users use this browser, even if they do not like it.  I
personally use my Amiga for work and my PC for games and Internet browsing
and I know a lot of people use PCs even though they are more interested in
Amigas.

A fact that might be of interest is that, despite being almost entirely
dedicated to the Amiga, my website has only been viewed by browsers running
under Workbench less than 0.5% of the time!  If you do not believe this
figure, then feel free to check it out for yourself.  The fact that almost
everyone who writes to me either wants a PC version of a game or pirate
copies in .adf format (which I DO NOT have) also speaks volumes about about
the current market.

Sorry about waffling on but I hope you find the info useful.  Incidentally,
my site has not been updated since September because I tried transferring
it to easyspace.com in the US, who were offering more space for less money.
 Without going into details, they simply ripped me off and I cannot even
afford to pay for the current host now, hence the downbeat (and overlong)
sig file.

Regards,

Author of lots of things
Currently unavailable due to the scam merchants at
easyspace.com (easy ripoff more like!)

I have a datatype for Ljpeg (lossless). Has anyone come across any
images in this format? What's the compression like? And why does
nothing seem to support it?

 Seeing as the bulk of the jpeg compression is made up from the loss of 
information, the compression is probably the same as "standard" compression 
schemes (maybe LZW or similar), as JPEGs also normally have this as secondary, 
but it would be the only compression in lossless.

 Nobody would support it for this reason - its just very similar to any other 
lossless compressed image format.

   Well, to be honest I wouldn't bother, I don't think you'll get enough

4. IBrowse doesn't have amazing ASync I/O, slowing down the transfer
5. HTTPResume may be running at a higher priority - you can change this in
IBrowse's settings.

What I would do

1) buy a new 3.5 inch drive, probably about 2 gigs along with pfs2
2) open the 1200 and dissconnect the cd drive
3) connect the new drive to this connector
4) format the drive with pfs2 and copy all the files over to it
5) keep the old drive in a cupboard then connect the cd drive back up.

sevrely unlikely, unless you get a null modem cable, which on an A500 would
be excruciating then copy them over

why not go to the aminet and get one of the text HTML editors? all free.
like webdesign, it's basically just a collection of preset combinations of

Unless downloads aren't affected by the "Use Proxy" menu item then I've
tried both.

Do you mean the thread priority? I assumed this was only the priority IB
gives to downloading versus image decoding, so if I had a fully loaded page
and I don't do anything after initiating the download there's no competition
is there?

I think what I need is a good source of amiga-specific information on
everything related to internet connections - configuring modems, tcp stacks
and programs that use tcp stacks... I feel very much in the dark in this
area due to lack of knowledge and its frustrating. I originally connected
with the Net&Web package which had no documentation beyond "click on such
and such.." Took me a fair while to get YAM working because N&W included a
mail daemon that was spooling all the mail off elsewhere and I had to figure
out how to stop it.

Can anyone recommend a source of such information, preferably on the net?
Is there any means of monitoring the actual speed of the connection to my
ISP so I can tell if adjustments have made a difference instantly?

The download phenomenon is not *that* important because it doesn't actually
stop me downloading, but it irritates the hell out of me not knowing WHY!

Thanks again

Mike Child

Even though you have an 060, IBrowse will download your regular files
slower for two reasons. 

Nr1. HTTPResume was coded the day before yesterday and uses all the loopholes in
newer versions of Miami/Ami-TCP. IB was last updated a year ago...

Nr2. HTTPResume has a higher priority. I think it's 1 or something, while IB
has a download priority (on my system anyway) of -2. You can change this in
Prefs/Network... menu. If the priorityis under 0, any, and most, tasks will be
executed before IB is allowed to download a chunk..

Visage has an internal decoder for IFF, JPG and PNG, and they
are showed faster than other viewers.
For the other kind of images (GIF, BMP, TIF, PCX, ecc.) it uses
the datatypes, and for these kind of images I don't know if
it's faster than the other viewers.
For the GIF images I prefer PPShow, because show correctly
the progressive GIF (and GIF Datatype not!) and it's quite fast.

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: Printers -- Epson or Canon

From: Conor Kerr <ck@mystcorp.com>

Hi Jerry,

Okay, I have to make this very quick, I don't have much time...

The absolute best printer for the money that you can get at this time is the
EPSON stylus 740.

I spent more than two weeks researching and picking a scanner and a printer
just a month ago, this invloved reading nearly a hundred reviews and
reading up on what is ecxpected form a printer and printer software.

The 740 beats everything out there (in it's price range) in an all-out
comparison (and it only came out in October so it uses the most up-to-date
technology out there).

I know you don't know me so you can only take my word for it, but I used to
be a professional graphic designer so I like to think that I know about
publishing :-)

The color from this printer is fantastic and at the highest resolution on
Epson Glossy Photo Paper the results are photographic.

It really is amazing when you look at it how fast computers advance.  3 or 4
years ago a printer of this quality would have set you back a couple of
grand!! 

It's fairly cheap to buy (<180inc VAT) but a little more expensive to run. 
Color ink doesn't last a huge amount of time and cartridges are expensive. 
This can be overcome though by buying a refill kit from one of the
advertisers in a PC mag (they charge a lot less for the printer and refills
in PC mags, but your printer direct - Software Warehouse is a good place to
try for the printer).

Software support on the Mac and PC is excellent (you could run it through
Fusion for the best printing results) and the printer itself has a standard
parallel port connector, a usb connector and a Mac printer connector
(cables have to be bought seperately) so there's no problem plugging in to
any (or even mulitple) setup.

The Amiga software is expensive, but if you aren't going to run Mac
emulation to print then you should most certainly buy it if you want to get
a decent quality printout.  Ask another person on the list though about the
Amiga software as I don't have much experience with it.  I wouldn't think
it would be too long until a specific driver is written.

It's not the cheapest, but it is the best.  You could go for the 640
instead, but really that is a false economy as the 740 is MUCH better.

It'll last you a very long time too...  its quality is so good that I doubt
that you'll ever need another printer again (well, until it breaks anyway).
That couldn't have been said of any printer bought last year or a few years
ago as, while the quality of these printers was reasonable-to-good, there
have been very significant advances in printer technology in the past year
which have brought the quality to a level that doesn't really need improved
upon.  (This is the same kind of thing as the fact that CPUs are so fast
now that you don't need anything faster for Word Processing, you know the
kind of thinking I'm talking about here :-) ). 

Hope that all helps. :-)

*Happy New Year Everyone!!*

All the best...

Subject: [just-amiga] Printers -- Epson or Canon

From: Jerry Leik <jdleik@voyager.net>

Hi again,

   I just wanted to thank everyone who responded to my request for
information.
   Some comments were made as to choosing a HP printer. Well, while they do
produce impressive prints, I dislike them for one main reason - the fact
that they don't have a straight paper path while both Canon and Epson offer
this feature. This is important to me because I have started a business, and
am currently printing my own business cards, which require the straight
paper path.
   I will probably be purchasing an Epson printer, as the information
presented to me since my initial message points to this being the best
option for the money.


   Thanks again,

I had the idea months ago :P

I actually got round to setting it up about 3 days ago, and we now have 17
subscribers, not including me :)

1 subscriber the first day, 13 the second, and 3 as of an hour ago today.

    mp3/2 would be about the only sound format that it does not handle, in
saying this, there is prolly one or two other obscure formats that are
unsupported, Murphy's Law :).  There are a couple of mp3 encoders
available, the one i know of is called frogger, and i have been told there
is also one called MusicIn, both are on aminet, you might find some others.
 I assume you have an FPU though.  Don't know if any versions avail for
non-fpu machines.

Subject: [just-amiga] New subscriber

From: Stephen Williams <sw@nysa.u-net.com>

Hi all

I just subscribed to the list, so thought I'd say hello and happy new
year.  Any of you on the NetConnect or YAM lists might recognize me,
I lurk on both those lists and post occasionally.

I joined this list because I often have general Amiga-related questions
which I don't want to ask on the NC or YAM lists because they'd be very
off-topic.  I'd like to ask them in a public forum without resorting to
Usenet (I prefer mailing lists).

So, first question:

Does anyone know of a supplier in the UK for Golden Image optical mice?
If they're no longer available, can anyone recommend another optical
mouse for the Amiga?  I have a vacant serial port, so a PC rodent with
appropriate drivers would be an acceptable alternative.

TIA.

There will be, I'm in the process of setting one up, although after much
experimentation it will be via OneList or eGroups and not via my machine
:)

Not sure if demand will be high enough though... what about a general
coding ML?...

This answers my question in another reply about what these thread priorities
actually do. Mine are all set at 0 so I think experimentation is in order!

Tack very much :) That *is* Swedish for "Thanks" isn't it? If not: Thanks!

Lycka till! (That's my other bit of Swedish! er, I think)

Go for it, I'll join :-)

I know enough ARexx to write simple scripts and "wrappers" (I use it
in preference to AmigaDOS scripts 'coz it's more powerful).  I'd like
to learn more though.

It is possible to remove it, but it's not free... if it upsets... mmm,
whoever you're replying to so much, do you want to cough up the money? :)

As far as he can tell, will Amiga OS3.5 be available in time for Amiga99
in St. Louis?

Will he have any other new products to peddle there?

What will the emulation possibilities of the new machine be like.

Are A.I working on a playstation program user AKA Apple macs

Are the important people being given development machines, IE
the writers of Pagestream, ImageFx, Opus, Netconnect?, Explorer 2260,
the list goes on and on.

Will ANG (Amiga Next Generation) have voice input capabilities from
the start - so that ANY program can be loaded from workbench and not
just for wordprocessors.

Will it have animated icons.

Backward compatibility?

Price 

What old hardware will I be able to plug in.

Will it be faster than the current G3`s Ie the 700Mhz one.

Have A.I learned to advertise more than Commodore and actually listen
more to the user base.

Will it still be the BEST raw machine for video editing.

Are AI making sure that the output sync can still go low enough for
normal Tv`s (Video`s) and high enough for Plasma screens.

Would it not pay to make sure that infared mice and tracker/roller
ball controllers dedicated to the PC work off the shelf for the miggy
or at least have a method of controlling them without additional
software requirements.

Will you assist in a hardware anti piracy device.

Yes, here's one or two
.
Question ONE: Concerning the Amiga Next Gen- what is the future of the
custom chips? Will they be updated?  Will the mysterious Superchip overtake
all functions of the old custom chips, negating the need for any?  Will you
add in updated custom chips even IF the SuperChip doesn't need them (just
to add insult to injury in making a really slick machine)?  Or will there
be software emulation of custom chips?

Question TWO: What about native task emulation for IBM and MAc apps?
Something like, click on the icon, some commodity identifies it as IBM or
MAC, thence passing it to the appropriate interpreter program whicjh would
basically be a library of redirects (redirects all IBM or MAC calls to the
approriate OS or assembler function used on the new Amiga chip).  It would
run such foreign apps withou too much loss of speed and without all that
unwanted overhead of opening up an extra screen just to run the IBM or MAC
stuff from?  It would be another good selling point for the new Amigas.

Question THREE:  IPrefs has a long-standing bug: text display on an
Interlaced 24-bit screen equals lock up and crash.  Will this be fixed in
OS 3.5 or is the world going to have to wait until the Next Gen.

Well, that's all that come to mind.

From: Conor Kerr <ck@mystcorp.com>

Hi Mark,

I just though I'd interrupt to save you all a little time - Petro won't
answer questions on chipsets, OS bugs, future machines, hardware, OS5,
OS5Dev.

Simply because he either isn't allowed to or doesn't know the answers to
these questions - all of them will be referred to Amiga Inc never to be
heard of again.  Petro is the marketing guy! :)

Sorry for being so blunt about it, but unfortunately Petro doesn't enjoy the
position he once did.  Otherwise we'd know a lot more about the future than
we currently do :(

All the best...

Is there any chance of a new machine before Christmas this year, or will we be seeing any Amiga ads anywhere by the end of the year?

Another small one, will the CPU chip be easily updatable IE lift out
and slot in. This may be very important if all of us buy the first
machine - say 400mhz version only to find a 700mhz version a month
later.

I was going to point out the very same facts.

I'd like to ask Petro what future plans he has. With no hardware made
by Amiga Inc/Int to sell, and OS3.5 only as a stop-gap measure, I can't
help thinking his (and Amiga Int's) future looks rather bleak...

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: [IMPORTANT] ask Petro anything [IMPORTANT]

From: Oliver Kastl <olli@elaborate-bytes.com>

Questions to Petro:

1. Could you please clarify the role of Amiga, Int. and Amiga, Inc.? Is it 
a susidiary od Amiga, Inc, or one of Gateway? What sense does it make to 
have marketing company in Germany and Development in the States? (With 
Bill McEwen as "head of marketing" in the US, btw)?

2. It looks like both companies are not knowing what each other does. 
e.g.:
AInt (Petro) announces in an interview in a german magazine, that the 
processor for the next machines is chosen: the PowerPC. Sure. No doubt 
about it.
Soon after this, Amiga Inc. denies.
Or Amiga, Int. announces an IRC Channel to have "official" status.
Soon after this, Amiga, Inc. denies.
This looks like both companies have some communication problem. (And that 
Amiga, Inc. is driving  the show)

3. What about OS3.5? "OS3.5 WILL be released at WOA98" ... soon after 
"OS3.5 is cancelled" ... soon after "OS3.5 will be released" ... soon 
after this ... Fleecy is fired ... rumours about Haage & Partner 
developing it... So what is finally the truth?

4. I would love to here some details about new developments, etc., but 
this seems to be Amiga, Inc's business. So what is Amiga, Int up to? 
Making more Audio CDs, Boing balls, more-than-expensive watches?

Cheers, Oliver

I second that one, will AINC be doing some seriously heavy advertising?, I

SOX does the trick for me if you like CLI.

Check out MultiSample on Aminet if you want a GUI. mus/conv i think? It
just does the basics (iff,wav,raw,etc) but it does it quickly and without
needing oodles of RAM.

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: Picture Viewers

From: Nano <syzygy@sunlink.net>

I have a similar setup and find Multiview fast and clear. I use it
primarily since it can view anything I have a datatype for. It's just
handy.

I would recommend checking out MysticView. It has a host of features and
views anything I throw at it. It too relies on datatypes (I think). I
believe it comes with an 060 optimized version as well.

EasyEncode has that simple gui you're looking for. It works with mp3enc.

I use 'encode'  but it is sloooooooooow,  a horrid unix port.
However, I generally encode my own stuff in MP2 instead,  
it flies along compared to mp3 & the 
output files only vary by 100 bytes or so, for this I use 'Pegasus'
Simple GUI & it works...

PS:  I use MPegA for playback.....

nope, mp2 files are usually twice the size.

eg
praiseyou.mp3 - 4.8 megs
praiseyou.mp2 - 8.6 megs

plus pegasus seems to just sit there doing nothing, doesn't ask me for an
output file :/

me too, not the library version though, way too slow

Me three, but what do you mean, not the library version? I thought
mpega used mpega.library (PPC), or am I talking rubbish again?

From: peter mysliwy <pamiga@channel1.com>

Hello,Ppl
    I had a Hard drive crash my hard was a total loss i have been rebuilding
it now. But one of the programs that i use from time to time rquires a key
that was given in amiga format (which was a old one that was discarded).
If anybody uses 1.2 that was given away with the mag the password should
be in ENV/photogenics Or if you have the mag it should be there.

Kind regards

The output file is the same name & location as the source file but with
.mp2 extension.

You were right,  my appologies,  'Pegassus'  encodes in MONO,
by default, therefore the file sizes were nearly the same...

mpega is a standalone program, it does not need the library. However the
library is supposed to be the same thing really except with better
features, this is true, but unfortunately it is also slower. mpega and
mpega.library do not interact with each other in any way at all. Have a
look at some the of GUIs available you can choose between mpega or the
mpega library

If you want a picture viewer with a lot of own picture decoder instead of
use
datatypes, I suggest you to download V 1.0.
With a graphic card is excellent, and without graphic card you can use the
option dither to optimize the pictures on screeens with few colours.
The decoders are optimized for 020, 040, 060 and PPC.
There are decoders for BMP, PCX, GIF, JPG, IFF, TIF, PCD, ecc. so try it!
