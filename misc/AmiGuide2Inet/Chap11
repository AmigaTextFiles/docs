     Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive services
that let you hold live "chats" or play @{" online " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 231} games with people around
the world.  To find out if your host system offers these, you can ask
your system administrator or just try them -- if nothing happens, then
your system does not provide them.  In general, if you can use @{" telnet " link Chap6/TELNET 0}
and @{" ftp " link Chap7/FTP 0}, chances are good you can use these services as well.

FYI:

     You can find discussions about IRC in the alt.irc newsgroup.
     "A Discussion on Computer Network Conferencing," by Darren Reed
(May, 1992), provides a theoretical background on why conferencing
systems such as IRC are a Good Thing.  It's available through @{" ftp " link Chap7/FTP 0} at
nic.ddn.mil in the rfc directory as rfc1324.txt.
     For a good overview of the impact on the Internet of the Morris
Worm, read "Virus Highlights Need for Improved Internet Management," by
the U.S. General Accounting Office (June, 1989).  You can get a copy via
ftp from cert.sei.cmu.edu in the pub/virus-l/docs directory.  It's listed

@Node TALK "Chapter 11: Net interactive (1 of 4) -- TALK"
@PREV MAIN

     TALK the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and requires
that both you and the person you want to talk to have access to this
function and are online at the same time.  To use it, type

                talk user@site.name

where that is the @{" e-mail " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 96} address of the other person.  She will see
something like this on her screen:

                talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
                talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name

To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's
@{" command line " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 50}):

                talk yourname@site.name

where that is the e-mail address of the other person.  She will see
something like this on her screen:

                talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
                talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name

To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's
command line):

                talk yourname@site.name

where that is your e-mail address.  Both of you will then get a top and
bottom window on your screen.  She will see everything you type in one
window; you'll see everything she types in the other.  To disconnect, hit
control-C.
     One note: Public-access sites that use Sun computers sometimes have
trouble with the talk program.  If talk does not work, try typing

     otalk

or

     ntalk

instead.  However, the party at the other end will have to have the same
program online for the connection to work.

     IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations with
people around the world.  It's a lot like an international CB radio  - it
even uses "channels."  Type something on your computer and it's instantly
echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the same channel with
you.  You can join in existing public group chats or set up your own.
You can even create a private channel for yourself and as few as one or
two other people.  And just like on a CB radio, you can give yourself a
unique "handle" or nickname.
     IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries, from
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel.
     Unfortunately, it's like @{" telnet " link Chap6/TELNET 0} -- either your site has it or it
doesn't.  If your host system does have it,  Just type

   @{" IRC Session example             " link IRCEXMP  }
   @{" IRC commands                    " link IRCCMD   }

If your host system offers IRC,  just type

 23:13 [1] adamg [Mail: 32] * type /help for help

----------------------------------------------------------------------




     You are now in channel 0, the "null" channel, in which you can look
up various help files, but not much else. As you can see, IRC takes over
your entire screen.  The top of the screen is where messages will appear.
The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages.  All IRC
commands begin with a /.  The slash tells the computer you are about to
enter a command, rather than a message. To see what channels are
available, type

                /list

and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:


*** Channel    Users  Topic
*** #Money     1      School CA$H (/msg SOS_AID help)
*** #Gone      1      ----->> Gone with the wind!!!  ------>>>>>

*** #p/g!      4
*** #DragonSrv 1

     Because IRC allows for a large number of channels, the list might
scroll off your screen, so you might want to turn on your computer's
screen capture to capture the entire list.  Note that the channels always
have names, instead of numbers.  Each line in the listing tells you the
channel name, the number of people currently in it, and whether there's a
specific topic for it.  To switch to a particular channel, type

                /join #channel

where "#channel" is the channel name and hit enter.  Some "public"
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it.  To
request an invitation, type

                /who #channel-name

where channel-name is the name of the channel, and hit enter.  Then ask
someone with an @ next to their name if you can join in.  Note that
whenever you enter a channel, you have to include the #.  Choose one with
a number of users, so you can see IRC in action.
     If it's a busy channel, as soon as you join it, the top of your
screen will quickly be filled with messages.  Each will start with a
person's IRC nickname, followed by his message.
     It may seem awfully confusing at first.  There could be two or three
conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the messages will
come in so fast you'll wonder how you can read them all.
     Eventually, though, you'll get into the rhythm of the channel and
things will begin to make more sense.  You might even want to add your
two cents (in fact, don't be surprised if a message to you shows up on
your screen right away; on some channels, newcomers are welcomed
immediately).  To enter a public message, simply type it on that bottom
line (the computer knows it's a message because you haven't started the
line with a slash) and hit enter.
     Public messages have a user's nickname in brackets, like this:

                <tomg>

     If you receive a private message from somebody, his name will be
between asterisks, like this:

                *tomg*

@TOC IRC
Note: Hit enter after each command.


/away         When you're called away to put out a grease fire
              in the kitchen, issue this command to let others know
              you're still connected but just away from your terminal
              or computer for awhile.


/help         Brings up a list of commands for which there is a help
              file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the
              subject for which you want information and hit enter.
              Hit enter by itself to exit help.

/invite       Asks another IRC to join you in a conversation.

                        /invite fleepo #hottub

              would send a message to fleepo asking him to join you on
              the #hottub channel.  The channel name is optional.



/join         Use this to switch to or create a particular channel,
              like this:

                        /join #hottub

              If one of these channels exists and is not a private
              one, you will enter it.  Otherwise, you have just
              created it. Note you have to use a # as the first
              character.


/list         This will give you a list of all available public
              channels, their topics (if any) and the number of users
              currently on them.  Hidden and private channels are not
              shown.

/m name       Send a private message to that user.

/mode         This lets you determine who can join a channel you've
              created.

                        /mode #channel +s

              creates a secret channel.


                        /mode #channel +p

              makes the channel private

/nick         This lets you change the name by which others see you.

                        /nick fleepo

              would change your name for the present session to
              fleepo. People can still use /whois to find your e-mail
              address.  If you try to enter a channel where somebody
              else is already using that nickname, IRC will ask you to
              select another name.

/query        This sets up a private conversation between you and
              another IRC user.  To do this, type

                        /query nickname

              Every message you type after that will go only to that
              person.  If she then types

                        /query nickname

              where nickname is yours, then you have established a
              private conversation.  To exit this mode, type

                        /query

              by itself.  While in query mode, you and the other
              person can continue to "listen" to the discussion on
              whatever public channels you were on, although neither
              of you will be able to respond to any of the messages
              there.

/quit         Exit IRC.

/signoff      Exit IRC.

/summon       Asks somebody connected to a host system with IRC to
              join you on IRC. You must use the person's entire e-mail
              address.

                        /summon fleepo@foo.bar.com

              would send a message to fleepo asking him to start IRC.
              Usually not a good idea to just summon people unless you
              know they're already amenable to the idea; otherwise you
              may wind up annoying them no end. This command does not
              work on all sites.

/topic        When you've started a new channel, use this command to let
              others know what it's about.

                        /topic #Amiga

               would tell people who use /list that your channel is meant
               for discussing Amiga computers.

/who <chan>   Shows you the e-mail address of people on a particular
              channel.

                        /who #foo

              would show you the addresses of everybody on channel foo.

                       /who

              by itself shows you every e-mail address for every person
              on IRC at the time, although be careful: on a busy night
              you might get a list of 500 names!

/whois        Use this to get some information about a specific IRC
              user or to see who is online.

                        /whois nickname

              will give you the e-mail address for the person using
              that nickname.

                        /whois *

              will list everybody on every channel.

/whowas       Similar to /whois; gives information for people who
              recently signed off IRC.

@Node MUD "Chapter 11: Net interactive (3 of 4) -- MUDs"
@NEXT BADDIES
     Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the realm
of fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you enter assume
a new identity and enter an alternate reality through your keyboard.  As
you explore this other world, through a series of simple commands (such
as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across other users, who may
engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your aid in some quest or try
to kill you for no apparent reason.
     Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular
MUD's rules, laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs stress
the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently gather
online to chat and join together to build new structures or even entire
realms.  Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and are filled with
sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you from completing your
quest -- through murder if necessary.
     Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs)
require you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name and
password.

      @{" Example session on HoloMuck " link MUDEXMP}

      Different MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands, but generally
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively simple
English commands.  Every Friday, Scott Goehring posts a new list of  MUDs
and related games and their @{" telnet " link Chap6/TELNET 0} addresses in the newsgroup
rec.games.mud.announce. There are several other mud newsgroups related to
specific types of MUDs, including rec.games.mud.social,
rec.games.mud.adventure, rec.games.mud.tiny, rec.games.mud.diku and
rec.games.mud.lp.
     When you connect to a MUD, choose your password as carefully as
you would one for your host system; alas, there are MUD crackers who
enjoy trying to break into other people's MUD accounts.  And never,
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system!
     MUDs can prove highly addicting.  "The jury is still out on
whether MUDding is 'just a game'  or 'an extension of real life with
gamelike qualities'," says Jennifer Smith, an active MUD player who
wrote an @{" FAQ " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 104} on the subject.
     She adds one caution: "You shouldn't do anything that you
wouldn't do in real life, even if the world is a fantasy world.  The
important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly
hundreds of people, and not just yours in  particular.  There's a
human being on the other side of each and every wire!  Always remember
that you may meet these other people some day,  and they may break
your nose.  People who treat others badly gradually build up bad
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval."

     One MUD that lets you look around first, without joining through
e-mail is HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this
game is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet
Holo.  You have to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the
homeless shelter) and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed on
this world, but only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the city
and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into orbit (of
course, all this takes money; you can either wait for your weekly salary
or take a trip to the city casino).  Once you become familiar with the
city and get your own character, you can even begin erecting your own
building (or subway line, or almost anything else).
     To connect, @{" telnet " link Chap6/TELNET 0} to

                hobbes.cs.mcgill.ca 5757

     When you connect, type

                connect guest guest

     and hit enter.  This connects you to the "guest" account, which
has a password of "guest."   You'll see this:

Your pager beeps twice, indicating no messages.
The Homeless Shelter(#22Rna)
You wake up in the town's Homeless Shelter, where vagrants are put for
protective holding.  Please don't sleep in public places-- there are plenty of
open apartments in Tanstaafl Towers, to the southwest of center.
There is a small sign on the wall here, with helpful information.  Type 'look
sign' to read it.
The door is standing open for your return to respectable society.  Simply walk
'out' to the center.

     Of course, you want to join respectable society, but first you
want to see what that sign says.  So you type

                look sign

and hit enter, which brings up a list of some basic commands.  Then
you type

                out

followed by enter, which brings up this:

You slip out the door, and head southeast...
Tanstaafl Center
This is the center of the beautiful town of Tanstaafl.  High Street runs north
and south into residential areas, while Main Street runs east and west into
business districts.
SW: is Tanstaafl Towers.  Please claim an apartment... no sleeping in public!
SE: the Public Library offers both information and entertainment.
NW: is the Homeless Shelter, formerly the Town Jail.
NE: is Town Hall, site of several important services, including: Public
Message Board, Bureau of Land Management (with maps and regulations), and
other governmental/ bureaucratic help.
Down: Below a sign marked with both red and blue large letter 'U's, a
staircase leads into an underground subway passage.
(Feel free to 'look' in any direction for more information.)

Instructions for newcomers
Directional signpost
Founders' statue

     To see "Instructions for newcomers", type

                look Instructions for newcomers

and hit enter.  You could do the same for "Directional signpost" and
"Founders' statue."  Then type

                SW

and enter to get to Tanstaafl Towers, the city housing complex, where
you have to claim an apartment (you may have to look around; many will
already) be occupied.  And now it's off to explore Holo!  One command
you'll want to keep in mind is "take." Periodically, you'll come
across items that, when you take them will confer certain abilities or
powers on you.  If you type

                help

and enter, you'll get a list of files you can read to learn more about
the MUD's commands.
     The "say" command lets you talk to other players publicly. For
example,

                say Hey, I'm here!

would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you.  If you
want to talk to just one particular person, use "whisper" instead of
"say."

                whisper agora Hey, I'm here!

would be heard only by agora.  Another way to communicate with
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your
pager.  If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting, chances are
it's a wizard checking to see if you need any help.  To read his
message, type

                pager

To send him a message, type

                page name message

where name is the wizard's name (it'll be in the original message).

     All is not fun and games on the Net.  Like any community, the Net
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make your
life miserable (you've already met some of them in the chapter on
@{" Usenet customs " link Chap4/MAIN}).  There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on
the Net than many would find healthy.  It also has its criminals.
Clifford Stoll writes in "The Cuckoo's Egg" how he tracked a team of
German hackers who were breaking into U.S. computers and selling the
information they found to the Soviets.  Robert Morris, a Cornell
University student, was convicted of unleashing a "worm" program that
effectively disabled several thousand computers connected to the Internet.
     Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers who
seek to find other's passwords to break into Net systems and people who
infect programs on @{" ftp " link Chap7/FTP 0} sites with viruses.
    There is a widely available program known as "Crack" that can
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a
dictionary (this is why you shouldn't use such passwords).  Short of
that, there are the annoying types who, as mentioned above, take a
special thrill in trying to make you miserable.  The best advice in
dealing with them is to count to 10 and then ignore them -- like
juveniles everywhere, most of their fun comes in seeing how upset you can
get.
    Meanwhile, two Cornell University students pled guilty in 1992 to
uploading virus-infected Macintosh programs to ftp sites.  If you plan to
try out large amounts of software from ftp sites, it might be wise to
download or buy a good anti-viral program.
    But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals? The
Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in response to a
series of government raids against an alleged gang of hackers.  The raids
resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game company never alleged to have
had anything to do with the hackers, when the government seized its
computers and refused to give them back.  The case against another
alleged participant collapsed in court when his attorney showed the
"proprietary" and supposedly hacked information he printed in an
electronic newsletter was actually available via an 800 number for about
$13 -- from the phone company from which that data was taken.
