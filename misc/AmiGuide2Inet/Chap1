     Connecting to the Net depends on where you are.  If you're a college
student or work at a company with its own Net connections, chances are you
can gain access simply by asking your organization's computing center or
data-processing department -- they will then give you instructions on how
to connect your already networked computer to the Internet.
     Otherwise, you'll need four things:  a computer, telecommunications
software, a modem and a phone line to connect to the modem.

Getting connected

     The phone line you use to connect to the Net can be your existing
voice line -- just remember that if you have any extensions, you (and
everybody else in the house or office) won't be able to use them for
voice calls while connected to the Net.

@Node MODEM  " ...Getting Connected (1 of 4) -- The modem"
@TOC GETCONNECT
@PREV GETCONNECT
     A modem is a sort of translator between computers and the phone
system. It's needed because computers and the phone system process and
transmit data, or information, in two different, and incompatible ways.
Computers "talk" digitally; that is, they store and process information
as a series of discrete numbers.  The phone network relies on analog
signals, which on an oscilloscope would look like a series of waves.
When your computer is ready to transmit data to another computer over a
phone line, your modem converts the computer numbers into these waves
(which sound like a lot of screeching) -- it "modulates" them.  In turn,
when information waves come into your modem, it converts them into
numbers your computer can process, by "demodulating" them.
     Increasingly, computers come with modems already installed. If yours
didn't, you'll have to decide what speed modem to get.  Modem speeds are
judged in "baud rate" or bits per second.  One baud means the modem can
transfer roughly one bit per second; the greater the baud rate, the more
quickly a modem can send and receive information. A letter or character
is made up of eight bits.
     You can now buy a 2400-baud modem for well under $70 -- and most now
come with the ability to handle fax messages as well.  For $200 and up,
you can buy a modem that can transfer data at 9600 baud (and often even
faster, when using special compression techniques).  If you think you
might be using the Net to transfer large numbers of files, a faster modem
is always worth the price. It will dramatically reduce the amount of time
your modem or computer is tied up transferring files and, if you are
paying for Net access by the hour, save you quite a bit in @{" online " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 231}
charges.

@EndNode
@Node TERMINAL " ...Getting Connected (2 of 4) -- Terminal software"
@TOC GETCONNECT
     Like the computer to which it attaches, a modem is useless without
software to tell it how to work.  Most modems today come with
easy-to-install software.  Try the program out. If you find it difficult
to use or understand, consider a trip to the local software store to find
a better program.  You can spend several hundred dollars on a
communications program, but unless you have very specialized needs, this
will be a waste of money, as there are a host of excellent programs
available for around $100 or sometimes even less.  Among the basic
features you want to look for are a choice of different "protocols" (more
on them in a bit) for transferring files to and from the Net and the
ability to write "script" or "command" files that let you automate such
steps as logging into a host system.
     When you buy a modem and the software, ask the dealer how to install
and use them.  Try out the software if you can.  If the dealer can't help
you, find another dealer.  You'll not only save yourself a lot of
frustration, you'll also have practiced the second Net Commandment: "Ask.
People Know."
     To fully take advantage of the Net, you must spend a few minutes
going over the manuals or documentation that comes with your software.
There are a few things you should pay special attention to: @{" uploading " link BigDummy.guide/LINGO 329}
and @{" downloading " link BigDummy.guide/LINGO 84}; @{" screen capturing " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 282} (sometimes called "screen
dumping"); logging; how to change @{" protocols " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 250}; and @{" terminal emulation " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 322}.
It is also essential to know how to convert a file created with your word
processing program into @{" ASCII " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 1} or "text" format, which will let you
share your thoughts with others across the Net.

@EndNode
@Node UDLOAD " ...Getting Connected (3 of 4) -- Upload/Download/Capture"
@TOC GETCONNECT
    Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to a
system on the Net. Downloading is retrieving a file from somewhere on the
Net to your computer. In general, things in cyberspace go "up" to the Net
and "down" to you.
    Chances are your software will come with a choice of several
@{" protocols " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 250} to use for these transfers.  These protocols are systems
designed to ensure that line noise or static does not cause errors that
could ruin whatever information you are trying to transfer. Essentially,
when using a protocol, you are transferring a file in a series of pieces.
After each piece is sent or received, your computer and the Net system
compare it. If the two pieces don't match exactly, they transfer it
again, until they agree that the information they both have is identical.
If, after several tries, the information just doesn't make it across,
you'll either get an error message or your screen will freeze.  In that
case, try it again.  If, after five tries, you are still stymied,
something is wrong with a) the file; b) the telephone line; c) the system
you're connected to; or d) you own computer.
    From time to time, you will likely see messages on the Net that you
want to save for later viewing -- a recipe, a particularly witty remark,
something you want to write your Congressman about, whatever. This is
where screen capturing and logging come in.
    When you tell your communications software to capture a screen, it
opens a file in your computer (usually in the same directory or folder
used by the software) and "dumps" an image of whatever happens to be on
your screen at the time.
    Logging works a bit differently.  When you issue a logging command,
you tell the software to open a file (again, usually in the same
directory or folder as used by the software) and then give it a name.
Then, until you turn off the logging command, everything that scrolls on
your screen is copied into that file, sort of like recording on video
tape.  This is useful for capturing long documents that scroll for
several pages -- using screen capture, you would have to repeat the same
command for each new screen.

@ENDNODE
@NODE PROTOCOLS " ...Getting Connected (4 of 4) -- Communication protocols"
@TOC GETCONNECT
@NEXT GETCONNECT
    Terminal emulation is a way for your computer to mimic, or emulate,
the way other computers put information on the screen and accept commands
from a keyboard.  In general, most systems on the Net use a system called
VT100.  Fortunately, almost all communications programs now on the market
support this system as well -- make sure yours does.
    You'll also have to know about protocols.  There are several
different ways for computers to transmit characters.  Fortunately, there
are only two protocols that you're likely to run across: 8-1-N (which
stands for "8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity" -- yikes!) and 7-1-E (7 bits,
1 stop bit, even parity).
     In general, Unix-based systems use 7-1-E, while MS-DOS-based systems
use 8-1-N.  What if you don't know what kind of system you're connecting
to?  Try one of the settings.  If you get what looks like gobbledygook
when you connect, you may need the other setting. If so, you can either
change the setting while connected, and then hit enter, or hang up and
try again with the other setting.  It's also possible your modem and the
modem at the other end can't agree on the right baud rate.  If changing
the protocols doesn't work, try using another baud rate (but no faster
than the one listed for your modem). Again, remember, you can't break
anything.!  If something looks wrong, it probably is wrong.  Change your
settings and try again.  Nothing is learned without trial, error and
effort.
     Those are the basics. Now onto the Net!

@Node JACKIN "Chapter 1: Setting Up (2 of 4) --  JACKING IN"
JACKING IN

     Once, only people who studied or worked at an institution directly
tied to the Net could connect to the world.  Today, though, an
ever-growing number of "public-access" systems provide access for
everybody.  These systems can now be found in several states, and there
are a couple of sites that can provide access across the country.
     There are two basic kinds of these host systems.  The more common
one is known as a "UUCP" site (UUCP being a common way to transfer
information among computers using the Unix operating system) and offers
access to international electronic mail and conferences.
     However, recent years have seen the growth of more powerful sites
that let you tap into the full power of the Net.  These Internet sites
not only give you access to electronic mail and conferences but to such
services as databases, libraries and huge file and program collections
around the world.  They are also fast -- as soon as you finish writing a
message, it gets zapped out to its destination.
     Some sites are run by for-profit companies; others by non-profit
organizations.  Some of these public-access, or host, systems, are free
of charge.  Others charge a monthly or yearly fee for unlimited access.
And a few charge by the hour.
     But cost should be only one consideration in choosing a host system.
Most systems let you look around before you sign up.  What is the range
of their services?  How easy is it to use? What kind of support or help
can you get from the system administrators?
     The last two questions are particularly important because some
systems provide no user interface at all; when you connect, you are dumped
right into the Unix operating system.  If you're already familiar with
Unix, or you want to learn how to use it, these systems offer phenomenal
power -- in addition to Net access, most also let you tap into the power
of Unix to do everything from compiling your own programs to playing
@{" online " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 231} games.
     But if you don't want to have to learn Unix, there are other
public-access systems that work through menus (just like the ones in
restaurants; you are shown a list of choices and then you make your
selection of what you want), or which provide a "user interface" that is
easier to figure out than the ever cryptic Unix.
     If you don't want or need access to the full range of Internet
services, a @{" UUCP " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 335} site makes good financial sense.  They tend to charge
less than commercial Internet providers, although their messages may not
go out as quickly.
     Some systems also have their own unique local services, which can
range from extensive conferences to large file libraries.
     Fortunately, almost all public-access systems let you look around
for awhile before you have to decide whether to sign up.  Systems that
charge for access will usually let you sign up @{" online " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 231} with a credit
card. Some also let you set up a billing system.

In Appendix B, you'll find a @{" list of public-access Internet sites " link Chap1/PUBACCESS}.

@EndNode
@Node DIALIN "Chapter 1: Setting Up (3 of 4) --  DIALING IN"
DIALING IN

     When you have your communications program dial one of these host
systems, one of two things will happen when you connect.  You'll either
see a lot of gibberish on your screen, or you'll be asked to @{" log in " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 170}.  If
you see gibberish, chances are you have to change your software's
parameters (to 7-1-E or 8-1-N as the case may be).  Hang up, make the
change and then dial in again.
     When you've connected, chances are you'll see something like this:

               Welcome to THE WORLD
               Public Access UNIX for the '90s
               Login as 'new' if you do not have an account

               login:

     That last line is a @{" prompt " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 254} asking you to do something.  Since this
is your first call, type

                new

and hit enter.  Often, when you're asked to type something by a host
system, you'll be told what to type in quotation marks (for example, the
'new' above).  Don't include the quotation marks.  Repeat: Don't include
the quotation marks.
     What you see next depends on the system, but will generally consist
of information about its costs and services (you might want to turn on
your communication software's logging function, to save this
information).  You'll likely be asked if you want to establish an account
now or just look around the system.
     You'll also likely be asked for your "user name."  This is not your
full name, but a one-word name you want to use while @{" online " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 231}.  It can be
any combination of letters or numbers, all in lower case.  Many people
use their first initial and last name (for example, "jdoe"); their first
name and the first letter of their last name (for example, "johnd"); or
their initials ("jxd").  Others use a nickname.  You might want to think
about this for a second, because this user name will become part of your
electronic-mail address (see @{" chapter 3 " link CHAP3/MAIN} for more on that).  The one
exception are the various Free-Net systems, all of which assign you a
user name consisting of an arbitrary sequence of letters and numbers.
     You are now on the Net.  Look around the system.  See if there are
any help files for you to read.  If it's a menu-based host system, chose
different options just to see what happens.  Remember: you can't break
anything.  The more you play, the more comfortable you'll be.

THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG

     * Your computer connects with a public-access site and get gibberish
on your screen.  If you are using parameters of 8-1-N, try 7- 1-e (or
vice-versa).  If that doesn't work, try another modem speed.
     * You have your computer dial a public-access site, but nothing
happens.  Check the phone number you typed in.  If correct, turn on your
modem's speaker (on Hayes-compatible modems, you can usually do this by
typing ATM1 in your communications software's "terminal mode."  If the
phone just rings and rings, the public-access site could be down for
maintenance or do to a crash or some other problem.  If you get a
"connect" message, but nothing else, try hitting enter or escape a couple
of times.
     * You try to @{" log in " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 170}, but after you type your password, nothing

ask! Ask your system administrator, ask a friend, but ask.  Somebody will
know what to do.

@Node PUBACCESS "PUBLIC-ACCESS INTERNET SITES"
PUBLIC-ACCESS INTERNET SITES

     What follows is a list of public-access Internet sites, which are
computer systems that offer access to the Net.  All offer international
e-mail and @{" Usenet " link CHAP3/WHATUSENET} (international conferences).  In addition, they offer:

               @{" FTP " link Chap7/FTP 0}: File-transfer protocol -- access to scores of file
               libraries (everything from computer software to historical
               documents to song lyrics).  You'll be able to transfer
               these files from the Net to your own computer.

               @{" Telnet " link Chap6/TELNET 0}: Access to databases, computerized library card
               catalogs, weather reports and other information services,
               as well as live, @{" online " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 231} games that let you compete with
               players from around the world.

     Additional services that may be offered include:

                WAIS:  Wide-area Information Server; a program that
                can search dozens of databases in one search.

                Gopher:  A program that gives you easy access to dozens
                of other online databases and services by making
                selections on a menu. You'll also be able to use these
                to copy text files and some programs to your mailbox.

                IRC:  Internet Relay Chat, a CB simulator that lets
                you have live keyboard chats with people around the
                world.

                Clarinet:  News, sports, feature stories and columns
                from Universal Press International; Newsbytes computer
                news.

     However, even on systems that do not provide these services
directly, you will be able to use a number of them through @{" telnet " link Chap6/TELNET 0}.
Systems marked "Unix"  dump you right into Unix (a.k.a. "DOS with a
college degree"). In most cases, this means you can also use the host
system's various Unix functions.  The other systems use menus, which are
generally much easier for beginners to navigate -- they are just like
menus in restaurants, in which you decide what you want from a list of
options. Any unique features of a given system are noted. Some of these
systems require you to use parameters of 7-1-E, so if you get gibberish
when you connect, try that. Most let you look around for awhile before
you have to sign up.
     Several of these sites are available nationwide through national
data networks such as the CompuServe Packet Network and PC-Pursuit.

--------------------

     If you don't live in a city with a public-access site, you'll
still be able to connect to the Net.  Several of these services offer
access through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet
Network and PC-Pursuit, which have dozens, even hundreds of local
dial-in numbers across the country.  These include @{" Holonet " link Chap1/PUBACCESS 61} in Berkeley,
Calf., @{" Portal " link Chap1/PUBACCESS 68} in Cupertino, Calf., the @{" WELL " link CHAP1/PUBACCESS 104} in Sausalito, Calf.,
@{" Dial 'N CERF " link Chap1/PUBACCESS 83} in San Diego, Calf., the @{" World " link CHAP1/PUBACCESS 162} in Brookline, Mass., and
@{" Michnet " link Chap1/PUBACCESS 188} in Ann Arbor, Mich.  Dial 'N CERF offers access through an 800
number.  Expect to pay from $2 to $12 an hour to use these networks,
above each provider's basic charges.  The exact amount depends on the
network, time of day and type of modem you use.  For more information,
contact the above services.
     Two other providers deliver Net access to users across the
country:
     Delphi, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a consumer-oriented network
much like CompuServe or America On-Line -- only it now offers
subscribers access to Internet services.
     Charges: $3 a month for Internet access, in addition to standard
charges.  These are $10 a month for four hours of off-peak (non-working
hours) access a month and $4 an hour for each additional hour or $20 for
20 hours of access a month and $1.80 an hour for each additional hour.
For more information, call (800) 695-4005.
     PSI, based in Reston, Va., provides nationwide access to Internet
services through scores of local dial-in numbers to owners of IBM and
compatible computers.  PSILink. which includes access to e-mail,
Usenet and ftp, costs $29 a month, plus a one-time $19 registration
fee.  Special software is required, but is available free from PSI.
PSI's Global Dialup Service provides access to telnet for $39 a month
plus a one-time $39 set-up fee.  For more information, call (800)
82PSI82 or (703) 620-6651.

Peter Kaminski maintains a list of systems that provide public access to
Internet services.  It's availble on the network itself, which obviously
does you little good if you currently have no access, but which can
prove invaluable should you move or want to find a new system.  Look for
his "PDIAL" file in the alt.bbs.lists or news.answers newsgroups in
Usenet (for information on accessing Usenet, see the USENET chapter).

@NODE ESSENUNIX "Essential Unix commands" SEVEN UNIX COMMANDS YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT:
     If you connect to the Net through a Unix system, eventually you'll
have to come to terms with Unix.  For better or worse, most Unix systems
do NOT shield you from their inner workings -- if you want to copy a
Usenet posting to a file, for example, you'll have to use some Unix
commands if you ever want to do anything with that file.
     Like MS-DOS, Unix is an operating system - it tells the computer how
to do things.  Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more
complex than MS-DOS, in most cases, a few basic, and simple, commands
should be all you'll ever need.
     If your own computer uses MS-DOS or PC-DOS, the basic concepts will
seem very familiar -- but watch out for the cd command, which works
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will
drive you crazy.  Also, unlike MS-DOS, Unix is case sensitive -- if you
type commands or directory names in the wrong case, you'll get an error
message.
     If you're used to working on a Mac, you'll have to remember that
Unix stores files in "directories" rather than "folders."  Unix
directories are organized like branches on a tree. At the bottom is the
"root" directory, with sub-directories branching off that (and
sub-directories in turn can have sub-directories). The Mac equivalent of
a Unix sub-directory is a folder within another folder.

cat           Equivalent to the MS-DOS "type" command.  To pause a file
              every screen, type

                        cat file |more

              where "file" is the name of the file you want to see.
              Hitting control-C will stop the display.  You can also use
              cat for writing or uploading text files to your name or home
              directory (similar to the MS-DOS "copy con" command).  If you
              type

                        cat>test

              you start a file called "test."  You can either write
              something simple (no editing once you've finished a line and
              you have to hit return at the end of each line) or @{" upload " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 329}
              something into that file using your communications software's
              @{" ASCII " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 1} protocol).  To close the file, hit control-D.

cd            The "change directory" command.  To change from your present
              directory to another, type

                        cd directory

              and hit enter. Unlike MS-DOS, which uses a \ to denote sub-
              directories (for example: \procomm\text), Unix uses a / (for
              example: /procomm/text).  So to change from your present
              directory to the procomm/text sub-directory,  you would type

                        cd /procomm/text

              and then hit enter. As in MS-DOS, you do not need the first
              backslash if the subdirectory comes off the directory you're
              already in.  To move back up a directory tree, you would type

                        cd ..

              followed by enter. Note the space between the cd and the two
              periods -- this is where MS-DOS users will really go nuts.

cp            Copies a file. The syntax is

                        cp file1 file2

              which would copy file1 to file2 (or overwrite file2 with
              file1).

ls            This command, when followed by enter, tells you what's in the
              directory, similar to the DOS dir command, except in
              alphabetical order.

                        ls | more

              will stop the listing every 24 lines -- handy if there are a
              lot of things in the directory. The basic ls command does not
              list "hidden" files, such as the .login file that controls
              how your system interacts with Unix. To see these files, type

                        ls -a      or    ls -a | more

              ls -l will tell you the size of each file in bytes and tell
              you when each was created or modified.

mv            Similar to the MS-DOS rename command.

                        mv file1 file2

              will rename file1 as file2, The command can
              also be used to move files between directories.

                        mv file1 News

              would move file1 to your News directory.

rm            Deletes a file.  Type

                        rm filename

              and hit enter (but beware: when you hit enter, it's gone for
              good).


WILDCARDS:  When searching for, copying or deleting files, you can use
"wildcards" if you are not sure of the file's exact name.

              ls man*


would find the following files:

              manual, manual.txt, man-o-man.

Use a question mark when you're sure about all but one or two characters.
For example,

              ls man?

would find a file called mane, but not one called manual.
