									Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet
									AmigaGuide® format

Edition 1.1
									Copyright ©1993, Electronic Freedom Foundation

This archive contains the complete Big Dummy's Guide in AmigaGuide® format.
The guide was prepared for Electronic Frontier Foundation and is a
excellent introduction to the Net.

This revised edition corrects some mistakes in the original and adds some
additional information. The index to the AmigaGuide version has been
extended.

To use this version under release 1.3 or 2.x of the OS, you will need to
obtain the AmigaGuide utility program. Under Release 3.0, you can use the
guide with MultiView.

The text version from which this AmigaGuide was built is available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.eff.org. The text version is

		/pub/EFF/papers/big-dummys-guide.txt

The guide may also be obtained in HyperCard format for the Mac.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	About this guide:

	This AmigaGuide version was prepared by Robin Evans (robin@halcyon.com).

	The menus in the guide are recursive: If you choose an item from one of
the menu (multi-button) pages you will be able to read all other nodes on
the same level by pressing the Browse key. At the end on the current level,
you will be returned to the menu page from which you began. Pressing Browse
again will take you to the next node on that level.

	To run it, put all the files in a directory and click on the icon. If
you start it from the CLI or from a directory utility, you may have to add
the path of this guide to the env: variable amigaguide/path. (See the
AmigaGuide help node -- press help when AmigaGuide is open -- for more
information on the environmental variables.)

Hi Robin.
We'd very much appreciate it if you'd release it.  Please do send me a copy
in the Amiga version, and we'll try to put it up onto our ftp site with the
other versions.

>First, thank you for the wonderful Big Dummy's Guide to Internet. Although
>I've downloaded megabytes of information about the Net, I'm still pretty
>much a big dummy when it comes to using it. This guide is a tremendous help.
>
>To make it more accessible on my system, I spent a little time to format it
>in the hypertext format released by Commodore. Called AmigaGuide, it is
>meant mainly for on-line help systems.
>
>I have made these slight modifications for the new format: rearranged some
>of the sections in the .txt file; added a few sentences on two of the
>introductory nodes; added a text file explaining the Amiga ftp sites called
>Aminet. Otherwise the text is unchanged.
>
>Could I get your permission to release this? I would be happy to send you a
>copy of the reformatted file before releasing it. The AmigaGuide format is
>human-readable, so you will not need an Amiga to review the text.
