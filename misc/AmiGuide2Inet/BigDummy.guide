Welcome to the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet.

The genesis of the Big Dummy's Guide was a few informal conversations,
which included Mitch Kapor of the @{" Electronic Frontier Foundation " link BigDummy.guide/EFF} (EFF)
and Steve Cisler of Apple Computer, Inc. in June of 1991.  With the
support of Apple Computer, EFF hired a writer (Adam Gaffin) and actually
took on the project in September of 1991.

The idea was to write a guide to the Internet for folks who had little or
no experience with network communications.  We intended to post this Guide
to "the 'net" in ASCII and HyperCard formats and to give it away on disk,
as well as have a print edition available for a nominal charge.  With the
consolidation of our offices to Washington, DC, we were able to put the
Guide on a fast track.  You're looking at the realization of our dreams --
version one of the Guide.  At the time I'm writing this, we're still
fishing around for a book publisher, so the hard-copy version has not yet
been printed.  We're hoping to update this Guide on a regular basis, so
please feel free to send us your comments and corrections.

EFF would like to thanks the folks at Apple, especially Steve Cisler of the
Apple Library, for their support of our efforts to bring this Guide to you.
We hope it helps you open up a whole new world, where new friends and
experiences are sure to be yours.  Enjoy!

          "As a net is made up of a series of ties, so everything in
     this world is connected by a series of ties.  If anyone thinks
     that the mesh of a net is an independent, isolated thing, he is
     mistaken.  It is called a net because it is made up of a series
     of interconnected meshes, and each mesh has its place and
     responsibility in relation to other meshes."

     New communities are being built today.  You cannot see them, except
on a computer screen.  You cannot visit them, except through your
keyboard.  Their highways are wires and optical fibers; their language a
series of ones and zeroes.
     Yet these communities of cyberspace are as real and vibrant as any
you could find on a globe or in an atlas.  Those are real people on the
other sides of those monitors.  And freed from physical limitations,
these people are developing new types of cohesive and effective
communities - ones which are defined more by common interest and purpose
than by an accident of geography, ones on which what really counts is
what you say and think and feel, not how you look or talk or how old you
are.
     The oldest of these communities is that of the scientists, which
actually predates computers.  Scientists have long seen themselves as an
international community, where ideas were more important than national
origin.  It is not surprising that the scientists were the first to adopt
the new electronic media as their principal means of day- to-day
communication.
     I look forward to a day in which everybody, not just scientists, can
enjoy similar benefits of a global community.
     But how exactly does community grow out of a computer network? It
does so because the network enables new forms of communication.
     The most obvious example of these new digital communications media
is electronic mail, but there are many others.  We should begin to think
of @{" mailing lists " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 177}, @{" newsgroups " link Chap3/NEWSGROUPS 0}, file and document archives, etc. as
just the first generation of new forms of information and communications
media.  The digital media of computer networks, by virtue of their design
and the enabling technology upon which they ride, are fundamentally
different than the now dominant mass media of television, radio,
newspapers and magazines.  Digital communications media are inherently
capable of being more interactive, more participatory, more egalitarian,
more decentralized, and less hierarchical.
     As such, the types of social relations and communities which can be
built on these media share these characteristics.  Computer networks
encourage the active participation of individuals rather than the passive
non-participation induced by television narcosis.
     In mass media, the vast majority of participants are passive
recipients of information.  In digital communications media, the vast
majority of participants are active creators of information as well as
recipients.  This type of symmetry has previously only been found in
media like the telephone.  But while the telephone is almost entirely a
medium for private one-to-one communication, computer network
applications such as electronic @{" mailing lists " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 177}, conferences, and
bulletin boards, serve as a medium of group or "many-to-many"
communication.
     The new forums atop computer networks are the great levelers and
reducers of organizational hierarchy.  Each user has, at least in theory,
access to every other user, and an equal chance to be heard. Some U.S.
high-tech companies, such as Microsoft and Borland, already use this to
good advantage: their CEO's -- Bill Gates and Philippe Kahn -- are
directly accessible to all employees via electronic mail.  This creates a
sense that the voice of the individual employee really matters.  More
generally, when corporate communication is facilitated by electronic
mail, decision-making processes can be far more inclusive and
participatory.
     Computer networks do not require tightly centralized administrative
control.  In fact, decentralization is necessary to enable rapid growth
of the network itself.  Tight controls strangle growth.  This
decentralization promotes inclusiveness, for it lowers barriers to entry
for new parties wishing to join the network.
     Given these characteristics, networks hold tremendous potential to
enrich our collective cultural, political, and social lives and enhance
democratic values everywhere.
     And the Internet, and the @{" UUCP " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 335} and related networks connected to
it, represents an outstanding example of a computer network with these
qualities.  It is an open network of networks, not a single unitary
network, but an ensemble interconnected systems which operate on the
basis of multiple implementations of accepted, non-proprietary
@{" protocols " link Chap1/PROTOCOLS 0}, standards and interfaces.
    One of its important characteristics is that new networks, host
systems, and users may readily join the network -- the network is open to
all.
    The openness (in all senses) of the Internet reflects, I believe, the
sensibilities and values of its architects.  Had the Internet somehow
been developed outside the world of research and education, it's less
likely to have had such an open architecture.  Future generations will be
indebted to this community for the wisdom of building these types of open
systems.
     Still, the fundamental qualities of the Net, such as its
decentralization, also pose problems.  How can full connectivity by
maintained in the face of an ever-expanding number of connected networks,
for example?  What of software bugs that bring down computers, or human
crackers who try to do the same?  But these problems can and will be
solved.
     Digital media can be the basis of new forms of political discourse,
in which citizens form and express their views on the important public
issues of the day. There is more than one possible vision of such
electronic democracy, however. Let's look at some examples of the
potential power, and problems, of the new digital media.
      The idea of something called an "electronic town meeting"  received
considerable attention in 1992 with Ross Perot's presidential campaign
(or, at least, its first incarnation).
     Perot's original vision, from 20 or so years ago,  was that viewers
would watch a debate on television and fill out punch cards which would
be mailed in and collated.  Now we could do it with 800 telephone numbers.
     In the current atmosphere of disaffection, alienation and cynicism,
anything that promotes greater citizen involvement seems a good idea.
People are turned off by politicians in general -- witness the original
surge of support for Perot as outsider who would go in and clean up the
mess -- and the idea of going right to the people is appealing,
     What's wrong with this picture? The individual viewer is a passive
recipient of the views of experts.  The only action taken by the citizen
is in expressing a preference for one of three pre-constructed
alternatives.  While this might be occasionally useful, it's
unsophisticated and falls far short of the real potential of electronic
democracy. We've been reduced to forming our judgments on the basis of
mass media's portrayal of the personality and character of the candidates.
     All this is in contrast to robust political debates already found on
various on-line computer systems, from CompuServe to @{" Usenet " link CHAP3/WHATUSENET}. Through
these new media, the issues of the day, ranging from national security in
the post-Cold War era to comparative national health care systems, are
fiercely discussed in a wide variety of bulletin boards, conferences, and
@{" newsgroups " link Chap3/NEWSGROUPS 0}.
     What I see in online debate are multiple active participants, not
just experts, representing every point of view, in discussions that
unfold over extended periods of time. What this shows is that, far from
being alienated and disaffected from the political process, people like
to talk and discuss -- and take action -- if they have the opportunity to
do so.  Mass media don't permit that.  But these new media are more akin
to a gathering around the cracker barrel at the general store -- only
extended over hundreds, thousands of miles, in cyberspace, rather than in
one physical location.
     Recent years have shown the potential power of these new media. We
have also seen several of examples where talk translated into action.
     In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission proposed changing the
way certain online providers paid for access to local phone service.
Online, this quickly became known as the @{" modem tax " link Chap4/BRAINTUMOR 0} and generated a
storm of protest.  The FCC withdrew the idea, but not quickly enough: the
"modem tax" has penetrated so deeply into the crevices of the Net that it
has taken up a permanent and ghostly residence as a kind of virtual or
cognitive virus, which periodically causes a re-infection of the systems
and its users.  FCC commissioners continue to receive substantial mail on
this even though the original issue is long dead; in fact, it has
generated more mail than any other issue in the history of the FCC.
     More recently, Jim Manzi, chairman of Lotus Development Corp.,
received more than 30,000 e-mail messages when the company was getting
ready to sell a database containing records on tens of millions of
Americans.  The flood of electronic complaints about the threat to
privacy helped force the company to abandon the project. Issues of narrow
but vital interest to the online community give a hint of the organizing
power of the Net.
     In August, 1991, the managers of a Soviet computer network known as
Relcom stayed online during an abortive coup, relaying eyewitness
accounts and news of actions against the coup to the West and to the rest
of Russia.
     And many public interest non-profit organizations and special
interest groups already use bulletin boards heavily as a means of
communicating among their members and organizing political activity.
     But all is not perfect online.  The quality of discourse is often
very low.  Discussion is often trivial and boring and bereft of
persuasive reason.  Discourse often sinks to the level of "flaming," of
personal attacks, instead of substantive discussion. {" Flaming " link Chap4/FLAMES 0}. Those with
the most time to spend often wind up dominating the debate - a triumph of
quantity of time available over quality of content.
     It seems like no place for serious discussion. Information overload
is also a problem.  There is simply far too much to read to keep up with.
It is all without organization.  How can this be addressed?
     Recent innovations in the design of software used to connect people
to the Net and the process of online discussion itself reveal some hope.
     Flaming is universal, but different systems handle it in different
ways.  Both the technology and cultural norms matter.
     On @{" Usenet " link CHAP3/WHATUSENET}, for instance, most news reader applications support a
feature known as a "killfile," which allows an individual to screen out
postings by a particular user or on a particular subject.  It is also
sometimes referred to as "the bozo filter."  This spares the user who is
sufficiently sophisticated from further flamage, but it does nothing to
stop the problem at its source.
     Censorship would be one solution. But what else can be done without
resorting to unacceptably heavy-handed tactics of censorship?  There is a
great tradition of respect for free speech on these systems, and to
censor public postings or even ban a poster for annoying or offensive
content is properly seen as unacceptable, in my opinion.
     Some systems use cultural norms, rather than software, to deal with
flame wars.  These online communities have developed practices which
rely more on a shared, internalized sense of appropriate behavior  than
on censorship, for instance.  The @{" WELL " link CHAP1/PUBACCESS 104} (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) is
a relatively small online conferencing system based in the San Francisco
Bay area.  On the WELL, individuals who get into a fight are encouraged
to move the discussion out of the public conference and into e-mail. The
encouragement is provided not only by the host of the conference, but
also by the users.  It is part of the culture, not part of the technology.
     WELL hosts are volunteers who facilitate the discussion of a
particular subject.  While they have the power to censor individual
postings, the power is very rarely used and only as a last resort, as it
has been found that dispute resolution by talking it out among the
parties is a superior method of problem solving in the long run.
     It is not an accident that the WELL has a uniquely high quality of
conversation.  Nor is it coincidental that it developed as a small and
originally isolated community (now on the Net) which gave it a chance to
develop its own norms or that key management of the system came from "The
Farm," a large, successful commune of the 1960's and 1970's led by
Stephen Gaskin.
     We still know very little about the facilitation of online
conversations.  It is a subject well worth further formal study and
experimentation.
     Some problems have to do with the unrefined and immature format and
structure of the discussion medium itself.  The undifferentiated stream
of new messages marching along in 80 columns of ASCII text creates a kind
of hypnotic trance.  Compare this with the typical multiplicity of type
fonts, varied layouts, images, and pictures of the printed page.
     New media take time to develop and to be shaped.  Reading text on a
terminal reminds me of looking at the Gutenberg Bible. The modern book
took a century to develop after the invention of printing with movable
type and the first Western printed books.  Aldus Manutius and the
inventions of modern typefaces, pagination, the table of contents, the
index, all of which gave the book its modern form, came later, were done
by different people, and were of a different order than the invention of
printing with movable type itself.  The new electronic media are
undergoing a similar evolution.
     Key inventions are occurring slowly, for example, development of
software tools that will allow the dissemination of audio and video
across the Net. This type of software has usually been sone so far by
volunteers who have given away the results.  It's a great thing, but it's
not sufficient, given how hard it is to develop robust software.
Innovation in the application space will also be driven by entrepreneurs
and independent software vendors at such point as they perceive a
business opportunity to create such products (it would be nice if
creators did it for art's sake but this seems unlikely).
     There are some requirements to provide incentives to attract
additional software development.  This requires a competitive free market
in network services at all levels to serve the expanding user demand for
network services. It requires a technologically mature network able to
support these services.
     And there must be a user population, current or prospective,
interested in paying for better applications -- and not just the current
base of technically sophisticated users and students, though they will
absolutely benefit.
     There are multiple classes of new application opportunities.
@{" e-mail " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 96} is overloaded because there aren't readily available
alternatives yet. New and different kinds of tools are needed for
collaborative work. Computer conferencing, as it evolves, may be
sufficient for discussion and debate.  But by itself, it cannot really
support collaborative work, in the sense of readily enabling a group to
make decisions efficiently, represent and track the status of its work
process.  Trying to run an organization via email @{" mailing list " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 177} is very
different than trying to have a discussion.
     Computer networks can only fully realize their potential as
innovative communications media in an environment which encourages free
and open expression.
     In some countries, legal principles of free speech protect freedom
of expression in traditional media such as the printed word.  But once
communication moves to new digital media and across crosses international
borders, such legal protections fall away.  As John Perry Barlow, the
co-founder of @{" EFF " link BigDummy.guide/EFF 0} puts it: "In Cyberspace, the First Amendment is a
local ordinance."  There is no international legal authority which
protects free expression on trans-national networks. Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights calls for the protection of free
expression in all media, but the declaration falls far short of being
binding.
     And if we're to take seriously the idea of the electronic online
forum, we have to deal with the access issue.  if the only people with
access to the medium are well-educated, affluent, techno-literate elite,
it won't be sufficiently inclusive to represent all points of view.
     We also need, fundamentally, a better infrastructure (the highway
system for information).  As we move from the high-speed Internet to the
even more powerful National Research and Education Network, we need to
look at how to bring the power of these new media into the homes of
everybody who might want it.  Addressing this "last mile" problem (phone
networks are now largely digitized, fiber-optic systems, except for the
mile between your home and the nearest switching station) should be a
prioarity.
     Computer networks will eventually become ubiquitous around the
world.  We should therefore be concerned with the impact on society that
they have, the opportunities to improve society, and the dangers that
they pose.   Fundamentally, we are optimists who believe in the potential
of networks to enhance democratic values of openness, diversity, and
innovation.
     Because the medium is so new, it is important now to develop
policies at the national and international level that help achieve the
potential of computer networks for society as a whole. By the time
television was recognized as a vast wasteland it was already too late to
change. There is a rare opportunity to develop policies in advance of a
technologically and economically mature system which would be hard to
change.

@Node WHATFOR "Preface (1 of 3) -- What this book is for"
@TOC PREFACE

     With this book, you will be able to use the Net to:

     = Stay in touch with friends, relatives and colleagues around the
       world, at a fraction of the cost of phone calls or even air
       mail.

     = Discuss everything from archaeology to zoology with people from
       around the world.

     = Tap into hundreds of information databases and libraries
       worldwide.

     = Retrieve any of thousands of documents, journals, books and
       computer programs.

     = Stay up to date with wire-service news and sports, and
       government weather reports.

     = Play live, "real time" games with dozens of other people at once.

     And you will have become the newest member of this ever growing
community. If you stay and contribute, the Net will be richer for it --
and so will you.
     But it will take a sense of adventure, a willingness to learn and an
ability to take a deep breath every once in awhile.
     Visiting the Net today is a lot like journeying to a foreign
country.  You know there are many things to see and do, but everything at
first will seem so, well, foreign.
     When you first arrive, you won't be able to read the street signs.
You'll get lost.  If you're unlucky, you may even run into some natives
who'd just as soon you went back to where you came from.  If this weren't
enough, the entire country is constantly under construction; every day,
it seems like there's something new for you to figure out.
     Here's where you take a deep breath.  Fortunately, most of the
natives are actually friendly.  In fact, the Net actually has a rich
tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers.  With few written guides
for ordinary people, the Net has grown in large part one person at a time
-- if somebody helps you learn your way around, it's almost expected
you'll repay the favor some day by helping somebody else.
     So when you connect, don't be afraid to ask for help.  You'll be
surprised at how many people will try to direct you around.
     And that leads to another fundamental thing to remember:

                You can't break the Net!

     As you travel the Net, your computer may freeze, your screen may
erupt into a mass of gibberish.  You may think you've just disabled a
million-dollar computer somewhere -- or even your own personal computer.
Sooner or later, this feeling happens to everyone -- and likely more than
once. But the Net and your computer are hardier than you think, so relax.
You can no more break the Net than you can the phone system.  You are
always in the driver's seat.  If something goes wrong, try again.  If
nothing at all happens, you can always disconnect. If worse comes to
worse, you can turn off your computer.  Then take a deep breath.  And
dial right back in. Leave a note for the person who runs the computer to
which you've connected to ask for advice.  Try it again. Persistence pays.

@Node FIRSTLINKS "Preface (2 of 3) --  FIRST LINKS"
@TOC PREFACE
     In the 1960s, researchers began experimenting with linking computers
to each other and to people through telephone hook-ups, using funds from
the U.S Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
     ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be
linked using a new technology known as packet switching, which had the
promise of letting several users share just one communications line.
Previous computer networking efforts had required a line between each
computer on the network, sort of like a train track on which only one
train can travel at a time.  The packet system allowed for creation of a
data highway, in which large numbers of vehicles could essentially share
the same lane.  Each packet was given the computer equivalent of a map
and a time stamp, so that it could be sent to the right destination,
where it would then be reassembled into a message the computer or a human
could use.
     This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to
exchange electronic mail, or e-mail.  In itself, e-mail was something of
a revolution, offering the ability to send detailed letters at the speed
of a phone call.
      As this system, known as ARPANet, grew, some enterprising college
students (and one in high school) developed a way to use it to conduct
online conferences.  These started as science-oriented discussions, but
they soon branched out into virtually every other field, as people
realized the power of being able to "talk" to hundreds, or even
thousands, of people around the country.
     In the 1970s, ARPA helped support the development of rules, or
protocols, for transferring data between different types of computer
networks.  These "internet" (from "internetworking") protocols made it
possible to develop the worldwide Net we have today.
     By the close of the 1970s, links developed between ARPANet and
counterparts in other countries.  The world was now tied together in a
computer web.
     In the 1980s, this network of networks, which became known
collectively as the Internet, expanded at a phenomenal rate.  Hundreds,
then thousands, of colleges, research companies and government agencies
began to connect their computers to this worldwide Net.  Some
enterprising hobbyists and companies unwilling to pay the high costs of
Internet access (or unable to meet stringent government regulations for
access) learned how to link their own systems to the Internet, even if
"only" for e-mail and conferences.  Some of these systems began offering
access to the public. Now anybody with a computer and modem -- and
persistence -- could tap into the world.
     In the 1990s, the Net grows at exponential rates.  Some estimates
are that the volume of messages transferred through the Net grows 20
percent a month.  In response, government and other users have tried in
recent years to expand the Net itself.  Once, the main Net @{" backbone " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 25} in
the U.S. moved data at 1.5 million bits per second.  That proved too slow
for the ever increasing amounts of data being sent over it, and in recent
years the maximum speed was increased to 45 million bits per second. Even
before the Net was able to reach that speed, however, Net experts were
already figuring out ways to pump data at speeds of up to 2 billion bits
per second -- fast enough to send the entire Encyclopedia Britannica
across the country in just one or two seconds.

@EndNode
@Node HOWWORKS "Preface (3 of 3) -- HOW IT WORKS"
@TOC PREFACE
@NEXT PREFACE
     The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional
networks.
     To understand it, picture a modern road network of trans-
continental superhighways connecting large cities.  From these large
cities come smaller freeways and parkways to link together small towns,
whose residents travel on slower, narrow residential ways.
     The Net superhighway is the high-speed Internet.  Connected to this
are computers that user a particular system of transferring data at high
speeds.  In the U.S., the major Internet @{" backbone " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 25} theoretically can
move data at rates of 45 million bits per second (compare this to the
average home modem, which has a top speed of roughly 2400 bits per
second). This internetworking "protocol" lets network users connect to
computers around the world.
     Connected to the backbone computers are smaller networks serving
particular geographic regions, which generally move data at speeds around
1.5 million bits per second.
     Feeding off these in turn are even smaller networks or individual
computers.
     Nobody really knows how many computers and networks actually make up
this Net.  Some estimates say there are now as many as 5,000 networks
connecting nearly 2 million computers and more than 15 million people
around the world.  Whatever the actual numbers, however, it is clear they
are only increasing.
     There is no one central computer or even group of computers running
the Internet -- its resources are to be found among thousands of
individual computers.  This is both its greatest strength and its
greatest weakness.   The approach means it is virtually impossible for
the entire Net to crash at once -- even if one computer shuts down, the
rest of the network stays up.  But thousands of connected computers can
also make it difficult to navigate the Net and find what you want.  It is
only recently that Net users have begun to develop the sorts of
navigational tools and "maps" that will let neophytes get around without
getting lost.
     The vast number of computers and links between them ensure that the
network as a whole will likely never crash and means that network users
have ready access to vast amounts of information.  But because resources
are split among so many different sites, finding that information can
prove to be a difficult task -- especially because each computer might
have its own unique set of commands for bringing up that information.
     While the Internet was growing, parallel networks developed. Large
commercial services such as CompuServe and GEnie began to offer network
services to individuals.  Phone companies developed their own
electronic-mail services.  Some universities started their own
international network. Hobbyists began networks such as Fidonet for MS-
DOS computers and @{" UUCP " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 335} for Unix machines.
     Today, almost all of these parallel networks are becoming connected.
It is now possible to send electronic mail from CompuServe to MCIMail,
from Internet to Fidonet, from @{" Bitnet " link Chap5/BITNET 0} to CompuServe.  In some cases,
users of one network can now even participate in some of the public
conferences of another.
     But the Net is more than just a technological marvel. It is human
communication at its most fundamental level.  The pace may be a little
quicker when the messages race around the world in a few seconds, but
it's not much different from a large and interesting party. You'll see
things in cyberspace that will make you laugh; you'll see things that
will anger you.  You'll read silly little snippets and new ideas that
make you think.  You'll make new friends and meet people you wish would
just go away.
     Major network providers continue to work on ways to make it easier
for users of one network to communicate with those of another. Work is
underway on a system for providing a universal "white pages" in which you
could look up somebody's electronic-mail address, for example.  This
connectivity trend will likely speed up in coming years as users begin to
demand seamless network access, much as telephone users can now dial
almost anywhere in the world without worrying about how many phone
companies actually have to connect their calls.
     And as it becomes easier to use, more and more people will join this
worldwide community we call the Net.
     Being connected to the Net takes more than just reading conferences
and logging messages to your computer; it takes asking and answering
questions, exchanging opinions -- getting involved.
     If you chose to go forward, to use and contribute, you will become a
citizen of Cyberspace.  If you're reading these words for the first time,
this may seem like an amusing but unlikely notion -- that one could
"inhaibit" a place without physical space.  But put a mark beside these
words.  Join the Net and actively participate for a year.  Then re-read
this passage.  It will no longer seem so strange to be a "citizen of
Cyberspace."  It will seem like the most natural thing in the world.

     New communications systems and digital technologies have already
meant dramatic changes in the way we live.  Think of what is already
routine that would have been considered impossible just ten years ago.
You can browse through the holdings of your local library -- or of
libraries halfway around the world -- do your banking and see if your
neighbor has gone bankrupt, all through a computer and modem.
     Imploding costs coupled with exploding power are bringing ever more
powerful computer and digital systems to ever growing numbers of people.
The Net, with its rapidly expanding collection of databases and other
information sources, is no longer limited to the industrialized nations
of the West; today the web extends into once remote areas from Siberia to
Zimbabwe. The cost of computers and modems used to plug into the Net,
meanwhile, continue to plummet, making them ever more affordable.
     Cyberspace has become a vital part of millions of people's daily
lives. People form relationships online, they fall in love, they get
married, all because of initial contacts in cyberspace, that ephemeral
``place'' that transcends national and state boundaries. Business deals
are transacted entirely in ASCII.  Political and social movements begin
online, coordinated by people who could be thousands of miles apart.
     Yet this is only the beginning.
     We live in an age of communication, yet, the various media we use to
talk to one another remain largely separate systems. One day, however,
your telephone, TV, fax machine and personal computer will be replaced by
a single ``information processor'' linked to the worldwide Net by strands
of optical fiber.
     Beyond databases and file libraries, power will be at your
fingertips. Linked to thousands, even millions of like-minded people,
you'll be able to participate in social and political movements across
the country and around the world.
     How does this happen? In part, it will come about through new
technologies. High-definition television will require the development of
inexpensive computers that can process as much information as today's
work stations.  Telephone and cable companies will compete to see who can
bring those fiber-optic cables into your home first.  High- speed data
networks, such as the Internet, will be replaced by even more powerful
systems.
     Vice President Albert Gore, who successfully fought for a landmark
funding bill for a new high-speed national computer network in 1990,
talks of creating "information superhighways.''
     Right now, we are in the network equivalent of the early 1950s, just
before the creation of the Interstate highway system.  Sure, there are
plenty of interesting things out there, but you have to meander along
two-lane roads, and have a good map, to get to them.
     Creation of this new Net will also require a new communications
paradigm: the Net as information utility.  The Net remains a somewhat
complicated and mysterious place.  To get something out of the Net today,
you have to spend a fair amount of time with a Net veteran or a manual
like this.  You have to learn such arcana as the vagaries of the Unix cd
command.
     Contrast this with the telephone, which now also provides access to
large amounts of information through push buttons, or a computer network
such as Prodigy, which one navigates through simple commands and mouse
clicks.
     Internet system administrators have begun to realize that not all
people want to learn the intricacies of Unix, and that that fact does not
make them bad people.  Coming years will see the development of simpler
interfaces that will put the Net's power to use by millions of people,
just as the number of host systems offering public access to the Net will
skyrocket.
     Gophers and Wide-Area Information Servers have become two of the
fastest growing applications on the Net.  They are relatively simple to
use and yet offer access to vast amounts of information.  Mail programs
and text editors such as Pico and Pine promise much of the power of older
programs such as @{" emacs " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 94} at a fraction of the complexity.
     Some software engineers are looking at taking this even further, by
creating graphical interfaces that will let somebody navigate the
Internet just by clicking on the screen with a mouse or by calling up an
easy text editor, sort of the way one can now navigate a Macintosh
computer -- or a commercial online service such as Prodigy.

     Then there are the Internet services themselves.
     For every database now available through the Internet, there are
probably three or four that are not.  Government agencies are only
slowing beginning to connect their storehouses of information to the Net.
Several commercial vendors, from database services to booksellers, have
made their services available through the Net.
     Few people now use one of the Net's more interesting applications.
A standard known as MIME lets one send audio and graphics files in a
message.  Imagine opening your e-mail one day to hear your
granddaughter's first words, or a "photo" of your friend's new house.
Eventually, this standard could allow for distribution of even small
video displays over the Net.
    All of this will require vast new amounts of Net power, to handle
both the millions of new people who will jump onto the Net and the new
applications they want.  Replicating a moving image on a computer screen
alone takes a phenomenal amount of computer bits, and computing power to
arrange them.
     The legislation pushed by Gore in 1991 will eventually replace the
existing Internet in the U.S. with the National Research and Education
Network.
     At the center of NREN will be a @{" backbone " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 25} that, in one second, will
be able to move as much as 3 billion bits of information from coast to
coast -- the equivalent of shipping the contents of a large encyclopedia
from New York to Los Angeles electronically. That seems like a silly
thing to do.  But that kind of speed allows for widespread distribution
of complex files, such as video loops, without bogging down the entire
Net. Its capacity will let millions more people onto the Net.
     As these "superhighways" grow, so will the "on ramps," for a high-
speed road does you little good if you can't get to it.   The costs of
modems seem to fall as fast as those of computers.  High-speed modems
(9600 @{" baud " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 31} and up) are becoming increasingly affordable.  At 9600 baud,
you can @{" download " link BigDummy.Guide/LINGO 84} a satellite weather image of North America in less
than two minutes, a file that, with a slower modem could take up to 20
minutes to download.  Eventually, homes could be connected directly to a
national digital network.  Most long-distance phone traffic is already
carried in digital form, through high-volume optical fibers.  Phone
companies are ever so slowly working to extend these fibers the "final
mile" to the home.  The @" Electronic Frontier Foundation " link EFF} is working to
ensure these links are affordable.
     Beyond the technical questions are increasingly thorny social,
political and economic issues. Who is to have access to these services,
and at what cost?  If we live in an information age, are we laying the
seeds for a new information under class, unable to compete with those
fortunate enough to have the money and skills needed to manipulate new
communications channels? Who, in fact, decides who has access to what?
As more companies realize the potential profits to be made in the new
information infrastructure, what happens to such systems as @{" Usenet " link CHAP3/WHATUSENET},
possibly the world's first successful anarchistic system, where everybody
can say whatever they want?
     What are the laws of the electronic frontier?  When national and
state boundaries lose their meaning in cyberspace,  the question might
even be: WHO is the law?  What if a practice that is legal in one country
is "committed" in another country where it is illegal, over a computer
network that crosses through a third country? Who goes after computer
crackers?
     What role will you play in the revolution?

ASCII           Has two meanings.  ASCII is a universal computer code
                for English letters and characters.  Computers store
                all information as binary numbers. In ASCII, the
                letter "A" is stored as 1000001, whether the computer
                is made by IBM, Apple or Commodore.  ASCII also refers
                to a method, or protocol, for copying files from one
                computer to another over a network, in which neither
                computer checks for any errors that might have been
                caused by static or other problems.

ANSI            Computers use several different methods for deciding
                how to put information on your screen and how your
                keyboard interacts with the screen.  ANSI is one of
                these "terminal emulation" methods.  Although most
                popular on PC-based bulletin-board systems, it can also
                be found on some Net sites.  To use it properly, you
                will first have to turn it on, or enable it, in your
                communications software.

Baud            The speed at which modems transfer data.  One baud is
                roughly equal to one bit per second.  It takes eight
                bits to make up one letter or character.  Modems rarely
                transfer data at exactly the same speed as their listed
                baud rate because of static or computer problems. More
                expensive modems use systems, such as Microcom Network
                Protocol (MNP), which can correct for these errors or

                waits for you to respond.  For example, if you see
                "login:" it means type your user name.

README files    Files found on FTP sites that explain what is in a given
                FTP directory or which provide other useful information

ROT13           A simple way to encode bad jokes, movie reviews that give
                away the ending, pornography, etc.  Essentially, each
                letter in a message is replace by the letter 13 spaces
                away from it in the alphabet.  There are online decoders
                to read these; nn has one built in.

RTFM            Read the, uh, you know, Manual.  Often used in flames
                against people who ask computer-related questions that
                could be easily answered with a few minutes with a
                 manual. More politely: RTM.

@{" Screen capture " link Chap1/UDLOAD} A part of your communications software that
                opens a file on your computer and saves to it whatever
                scrolls past on the screen while connected to a host
                system.

@{" Server " link Link Chap5/BITNET 26}        A computer that can distribute information or files

                requests.

Shareware       Software that is freely available on the Net, but which,
                if you like and use it, you should send in the fee

.sig file       Sometimes, .signature file.  A file that, when placed in
                your home directory on your public-access site, will

                write.

.sig quote      A profound/witty/quizzical/whatever quote that you
                include in your .sig file.

Signal-to-noise The amount of useful information to be found in a given
ratio           @{" Usenet " link CHAP3/WHATUSENET} newsgroup.  Often used derogatorily, for example:

                the Internet.

@{" Terminal " link Chap1/TERMINAL 0}      There are several methods for determining how your
 emulation      keystrokes and screen interact with a public-access
                site's operating system.  Most communications programs
                offer a  choice of "emulations" that let you mimic the
                keyboard that would normally be attached directly to
                the host-system computer.

Upload          Copy a file from your computer to a host system.

User name       On most host systems, the first time you connect you

@Node EFF "General Information About the Electronic Frontier Foundation"
@PREV LINGO
@NEXT MAIN

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a membership organization
that was founded in July of 1990 to ensure that the principles embodied
in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are protected as new
communications technologies emerge.

>From the beginning, EFF has worked to shape our nation's communications
infrastructure and the policies that govern it in order to maintain and
enhance First Amendment, privacy and other democratic values.  We believe
that our overriding public goal must be the creation of Electronic
Democracy, so our work focuses on the establishment of:

o       new laws that protect citizens' basic Constitutional rights as
they use new communications technologies,

o       a policy of common carriage requirements for all network
providers so that all speech, no matter how controversial, will be
carried without discrimination,

o       a National Public Network where voice, data and video services
are accessible to all citizens on an equitable and affordable basis, and

o       a diversity of communities that enable all citizens to have a
voice in the information age.
