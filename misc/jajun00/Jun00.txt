Subject: [just-amiga] 68030 CPU/FPU speed
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello All,
#I thought I had posted this already but the only response has been a
#complaint from amigactive moderator that I cross-posted. No intention to do
#that, but I'm still finding my way. I did think I had copied it to an individual
#user. Anyway.............sorry if this has already been sent.
#
#I want to get max performance out of my A1200for internet and graphics. 
Seems prob is AGA set is slow + many things rely on chip mem and ignore 32mb
of fast ram.
I have Apollo 1232........... /030 Accelerator  NO FPU      have mmu but try
options like copyback, virtual..........nothing seems to happen.
CPU CACHE BURST is required and apparently is accepted and implemented - but
how do I know?

Doc with accelerator says FPU required is Motorola MC68882FN40A (PLCC
package) says should be ok at 50mhz.......does this mean it NEEDS 50 mhz or
ok up to 50mhz?

I intend to get a FPU but how can I check whether CPU is
25.........40.......or 50mhz?
(Not towered so 68040 or 60 seem not suitable accell to get)  i.e. stuck
with 030:-(
also cash not abundant :(
Before lashing out for FPU I would like to be clear what involved and
improvements to expect.

Got FBlit (3.26..?) from Aminet - no docs - how use it ?

I would be grateful for any advice on how to speed
things up.

Have found out how to save on chip mem with screens/colours 
*Using:*
*A1200*
*68030mmu*
*Wordworth (1V..?) Ai200/2000 version* - HORRIBLY Slow - doesn't seem to
know about fast ram.
*Miami 3.2b*
*YAM 2.0*
*VOYAGER 3.2*
*OS 3.0*
*KS 39.xx*
*32mb fast RAM*
*500meg HD*
*US Robotics Courier V34 modem*  Miami says V43bis when online but maybe
because interface is set to 38K. max achieved on downloading is about 3,400
cps

Thanks in advance

Cally

An FPU will help speed up math intensive programs no-end. If you're
only into typing the occasional letter on your Amiga, the money would
be wasted. Expect increased performance in raytracing programs,
graphics programs such as ArtEffect and ImageFX and DrawStudio,
web-browsers have special fpu version which help in image decoding
IIRC. So, it depends on what you do with your Amiga if you need one or
not. I never regretted getting an FPU.

Go to the Workbench menu bar select "Workbench Execute/command" a small
requestor will open ....Type in CPU and press return or click OK.

This will tell you if Cache burst is on!

Not sure! But I would have thought that if your Accelerator Doc mentions
that the FPU should work OK with it!
 
> I intend to get a FPU but how can I check whether CPU is
> 25.........40.......or 50mhz?

Go to the Aminet and download "sysinfo" this will tell you all you need to
know, also handy for turning your Cache's on or off.
( If I remember correctly when you open sysinfo, you need to click on
"Speed" before the mhz value is displayed.

Sorry can't help (No FPU myself) But I think it only helps with quicker
calculations (or something like that)

Hope this helps a little :)

Actually FBlit has an extensive readme file or docs, one, and reading
them is why I decided not to use it (academic now, I have a graphics

Hello, Joe.


You wrote at 01-Jun-00 concerning "*[just-amiga] 68030 CPU/FPU speed*":

If your cpu is running with 50MHz, you will need a 50MHz fpu.

Get 'WhichAmiga' from Aminet (output see signature)

 JC> Got FBlit (3.26..?) from Aminet - no docs - how use it ?

Goto #http://www.tpec.u-net.com/#
to get the newest version with docs.

 JC> I would be grateful for any advice on how to speed

Get the 'MmuLibs' from Aminet and read the docs.
The most important prog there is 'MuFastExec' combined with 'MuMove4k',
which will give you an immense speed up.

Hi,

Well, guess my "lurking days" are over on this list, anyway:

> 1st off, Voyager images decoding  But graphics/anim later.

Voyager image decoding: if you can't afford a gfx card, get your fpu.
Voyager has different image decoding modules, optimised for processor
and fpu. And if you say graphics/anims later, it's even more worth it
(providing you have the software to support it). 24 bit graphics needs
loads of calculatations, and the fpu helps here a lot.

> also Background music (mods players) heavy on chip mem - Miami will fail
> to connect if music playing - Is music processing math-intensive?

Not AFAIK, but it does eats loads of chip mem. (Talking mod playing
here, if you want to start messing with your own samples at realtime
the story changes). I noticed this back in the old days, when I didn't
have enough fast mem. What helped me with my MIAMI problems at that
time was starting MIAMI without GUI (check the NO GUI on startup in
the GUI page of MIAMI, and under events select auto online. This
should start MIAMI without GUI, and because it will go auto online,
you don't really need the GUI. If you do need a GUI for some reason, I
found switching from MUI to Gadtools help give me enough free memory
(nothing against MUI, but it eats more memory than gadtools). It might
not look as good, but it gives you a basic GUI without eating to much
mem. Playing mods etc. will not be helped a lot by an fpu AFAIK. This
would be a bad thing, since the author of any mod will have the speed
set in his masterpiece, imagine someone with an fpu, and the song gets
played at double speed :)

Dirk

I can only repeat, I've now been there 3 times and can reliably 
inform you it's not listed "*on the right, under "Support" - Matt's* 
*TTF guide.*" I've clicked on every button, graphic etc. on *all* screens 
and nothing named TTF.guide exists. For that matter, there is nothing
available for d/load anywhere I can find. Maybe you have to be a
fully registered user of Voyager to access hidden buttons that are not
accessable to the casual surfer, or maybe you have not been there for
a while and their site has altered.  8-)

Hi Everybody,

   What screenmode are you in? Try lowering the colours or get Miami to open on its own 4 colour screen or something.
 
> Not AFAIK, but it does eats loads of chip mem. (Talking mod playing

   Mods use virtually no CPU power at all. All the simple ones do is send the sample info to the custom chips which then play the sound. Hence they need lots of chip ram to store all the samples.

   Now, newer players store sounds in fast ram, and copy little bits to chip ram at a time to be played. This uses more CPU (still very little, even on an 030)

   Of cource, once you get into one like OctaMed Soundstudio, it does multi-channel real time mixing, which does use chip ram.


Anyway, I suggest you find a mod player that uses fast ram, if that is what is going wrong.

   If mods were played according to CPU speed, then an 060 amiga would get through a mod in about 5 secconds!  Mods are timed through the amigas internal timer system.  


See ya :)

Hello,
        i am amazed that you seem to find difficulty locating this link.  It is
very clearly marked, it even has a little 'update' icon next to it.  It is on
the right hand side !  In case that you have a blind spot in your vision that
doesn't allow you to see the bright yellow update icon, the link takes you to :

http://www.kittycat.co.uk/computing/webfonts/

I hope this is the end of these emails.  This kind of thing i'd expect from the
spoon-fed M$ masses, a little more persistence and intelligence is usually
shown by Amiga users.  Don't be afraid to use your brain, it won't break.

Having said that, i'm in a better mood now.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello,
Just to inform and head off anymore emails, issue #36 of AIO went out
without use of BCC.  This was *Unintentional.*  Between the issue running
late, finally getting it finished up at midnight or so, and a VERY
stressful month (my dad passed away), I forgot to BCC the whole thing as
normal.  Sorry about that to all it may have affected.

And to the one guy out there thinking of using those addresses for SPAM,
aren't Amiga users supposed to be /above/ that sort of thing?

If someone's using address of an eGroups list for spam, remove and ban them,
inform eGroups, inform their ISP, and send them an email. I had a case of
this a short while ago on my list where someone was taking the address's of
people posting for spam. It was only when a few people mentioned on another
list about spam that we figured out where it was coming from by working out
that a common factor was that the only people getting this were subscribed to
my list.

Sorry, I've confused you :-( thats not surorising - its my default mode-!

abelgratis is my currnt isp

I've signed up with RHAnt and from mails received today it looks like I
should set up a mail a/c and haven't done so yet 
(with abelgratis it was
done simultaneously with signup)

As rha didn't mention the email setup I assumed it was automatic and I
should be able to work out my email address (the NEW one at RHAnt)
from the info I had been given. ie by arranging  user name/ userID/ 
Domain/ etc into some standard format. 

Seems I'll have to get the adress from redhotant 
No criticism of abelgratis - my deal with RHA  buys me allday freefone
access

Thanks for your reply, they all help in the long run

The email above was received at 1:30am on Sun, 4th June 2000. I never
received  the  mail from Dominique Harelle, (that you quoted from and
had  the  correct address in his reply) until after 2:00am on Sunday,
4th June 2000.

I  suggest  that  instead of alluding to me as a blind, gormless twit
that you actually take the time to read the email you quote from. You
would  have  then had no need to waste your valued time as a maillist
censor by replying and pointing out my obvious stupidness in going to
the  wrong  site  as  quoted in the first line below from your quoted
mail.  This is the one I was given by more than one responder, and is
wrong.  It  kept  sending me to some place called "Got One" which was
obviously incorrect.

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note  the  correct URL above added by Dominique Harelle which I never
received until after your polite mail.

Dare I suggest that there is a vast difference between www.v3.com and
http://v3.vapor.com/ ?

After going to the correct site I've now d/l'd the required document.

> Having said that, i'm in a better mood now.

Glad I've made you happy.

You certainly don't have the patience of one.

Thanks, Dominique. The URL above was the correct one, not the one
in the first line of the quoted mail. I've now d/l'd it.

Not really all western europe. Place like Iceland
are exact copies of America, as with countries
surrounding the USA.

I think the problem is many countries aspire to be
like the United States, they've given alot, but
also have many problems I wish to avoid having in
our country ;)

Errr... this was an Amiga mailing list... can anyone
recall my last Amiga related posting?

Don't get me started ;)

Of course, England should be the default country,
who outside England agrees :)? you all want to be
english, what a shock. i can't blame you :)

As Worcestershire sauce comes from Worcestershire,
England. It makes sence really, i'm a L&P sauce man
myself, oh well.

Oops. =) Or whatever, I can post messages in American English if I want to,
since American English is the language of computers (much like French is the
language of (snail) mail and Italian is the language of music). (Be assured,
however, that my pronounciation is English. =))

And though we have a standardized (sic) language of computers that people can
choose to use in order for other netizens to understand what they write, we
don't have an international "default country" that people can choose to come
from so that everyone else, automatically, will have the same culture, time
zone and Worcestershire Sauce habits.

 One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could
 not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon
 found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor
 little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had
 become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write
 with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use,
 as it left no mark on the slate.

Just because Noah Weblter simplified everything he could, like color
instear of colour.  But not to make any off-colour remarks.  Spelling
in either version is a horor (horour?). :-)

People who write emails like his are acting like idiots.  There is never
a need to do that especially over something so trivial.  Save youself
some grief Tiny and ignore people like him when they get like that. 
There is a v3 link on the vapor site, if you can find it.  I use it a
lot, but it is still a challange to do so.  I don't know why I bother
with Voyager, as 3.2 is slower and more buggy than 3.0.52, which I
still use in preferance, but behind IBrowse and Aweb.  I do have
Microdot running fine, and Ollie's last few upgrades at least haven't
screwed it up, so one out of two is ok I guess.  Hang in there, and
forget this guy's lack of courtesy and sensativity.

Speaking of Twiglets, did anyone see that episode of Mr. Bean where it was
new years eve and he ran out of Twiglets? he lent out of his window and cut
some twigs off some trees.... Thought it needed mentioning :-)

As I said, Mike, I finally got it after I was given the correct URL.
After all the trouble, it turned out I already had it and it didn't
go by the name given, it was part of the TTF package.

Just out of curiousity, where on the www.v3.vapour site is that link?
I went there again last night (it's actually a site named "Got One")
just to make sure I wasn't insane, blind and ignorant, and still 
couldn't find any such link.

Regards... Tony

Didn't he cover them in Marmite too?  They'd have tasted nicer than
proper Twiglets :-)

Twiglets bad.  Doritos good.

FFS! cant we all stop behaving like idiots please and stop arguing? This has
always been a nice, friendly and extremly helpful list and I dont
particularly want it clogged up by a few imbeciels having a petty shout at
one another.

Sort it out!

They broadcast it every year (nearly) here in Sweden... a week after they give
the christmas episode. So one kind of knows them by heart by now... =)

     Now - on to lyrics, this is soooo subjective, most people can spot
     completely pants lyrics (eg. "I don't wanna live without your love,
     I was born to make you happy"), but when the lyrics have feeling,
     power and emotion (eg. "always and forever you and me, that's the
     way our life should be"), it's more down to personal taste.

Taint labled as such.  It is the Voyager or the Download link, but as I
said that site is a bugger to navigate, so I'm not absolutely sure.  It
just says v3 portal when you get there.

        OK Tony, it seems that i owe you an apology, no sweat i'm officially
sorry if i caused you any grief.  I guess i expect too much of people,
that's my fault not yours.  Just do like mike said and ignore people like
me, it works for most people...

        As far as muppets having patience, that's an interesting thought.
Consider that if i were to liken my character to one of the muppets it would
be the hecklers in the balcony.  Sorry again Tony, i just couldn't believe
that it took so many emails to sort that problem out and i guess i was just
having a bad day when i wrote that.  If you want some nice TTF fonts, or
further help with them, just call on this IOU.

A corn snack; the pieces look a bit like pieces of twig.

*tries desperately to bring this thread back on topic*

Uhm... uh... Half-Life can be played on neither Twiglets nor Amigas.

Subject: [just-amiga] That song
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, a tad OT, but anyway,  ;)


   I've heard a quite good song on the radio, but I have no idea what it was called, so therefore cannot find a copy 

   Before you ask, I've tried searching for all the obvious things on Amster and audiogalaxy ;)   Now, this may not be entirly correct, but I think it goes something like this:

   
   ..Something something...

   I came alive, when I heard my favourite song,

   Hello world...

   Here I am...

   Tune me in...

   To the frequency of life...


   etc.   


   Ta in advance :)


 
See ya :)

Go outside and find a tree.  Pull off a small twig, and dip in mud.  Leave to
set.

Okay, they're not actually all that bad but that's what they /look/ like.

I believe you have something similar over there - pretzel?

fot the amiga. anyone know anything about it?

Havent a clue mate, sorry. What radio station and who was playing it?
Oh btw, when u find out what it's called, have a look on Napster for it
(you'll have to use a smelly PC, unless anyone know of a Napster client for
the Amiga. Now theres an idea....)

Controversy time: I stopped caring about Amiga games a long time ago.

I have a console to play games on.  It's cheap, fast, and does far
better 3D than I'm ever going to get out of my Amiga.  Of course, I
could upgrade the Amiga, but I don't see the point when the console
games are so great.

My Amiga is used as an Internet terminal, and for music and graphics.
It can't cope with the kinds of games that I want to play, so I
have something else for those.

-Stephen (waiting for the angry responses)

Not at all. It's horses for courses. I've got the miggy, playstation and an
ancient PC so between them I can accomplish virtually everything I want to

A friend of mine uses Amster, the Amiga version of Napster.  I only know
the name, but you might do a search and find it.

Amiga OS has 2 Napster clients and rumors of a 3rd in development. They are:

Amster - http://www.amigart.com/amster/

aNapster - http://www.crosswinds.net/~jsiv/anapster/

 Amster works fine,as does ANapster which doesn't have all the bells and whistles of
Amster .....but does work exceedingly well ,too!

Hello,

Does anyone remember this game? I got the demo version off an AF coverdisk
ages ago, and always meant to register it, but never got around to it. I've
been playing it on my A600 (with the 1200's old monitor- I'm almost blinded
after the bliss of .50Hz refresh),and I wondered if anyone knew of a newer
version than the 1.3 on Aminet? The web url that was in the docs no longer
works, and the author's mail address expired at the end of1996. I'm
assuming that the author has long since
gone to PC land.


Sooner,

        Sandy, nostalgic

Nope, Breed'96 was a simn type game, pretty much on the K240 mould.

Nope. This was a kind of "build up a settlement on your home planet while
simultaneously launching spacecraft and kicking opposing civilisations
butts" type thing.

Subject: [just-amiga] Miami 32b fault
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello All,
I would appreciate any help with a prob I'm having with Miami.
It started after I tried to alter the settings to use an additional ISP.

I think I tried to 'move' a backup copy (in a different partition) while
Miami window was open. Every copy in all partitions are affected in the same
way.
I re-installed from floppy backup.

 After power-up or reboot I have to run Miami_Install or else Miami will not
open.  MiamiInit will not open and says 'cannot open GUI'
  
I don't have to re-configure - the settings remain intact. I just have to
run the installer. 

Voyager crashes fairly often needind a reboot  so its a bit more than
inconvenirnt. 
It only seems to need Miami_Install to getthe GUI going - the settings are
still ok.

MUI is in Miami/Libs   (  MUI.MiamiGui    MUI.MiamiToolsGui    MUIMWB.pch  
spatch    also bpf  pcap and socks .librarys) Tried putting spatch in
workbench:C     no difference

Tried installin GTLayout - same result.

Regards
Cally

Hi Everybody,

   Here, I've found a copy on Aminet and apparently it's a commercial game:

Registration is no longer available as Breed96 is going (or possibly
by the time you've read this gone) commercial. If you would like
further information contact Vulcan Software Limited on (01705) 670269



Although it sounds a bit like a game I've started, 'Solar Conquest'. You /could/ just wait for that to come out :)  I'll support internet multiplayer and all ;)  There's even some early screenshots on my website

See ya :)

Subject: [just-amiga] RC5-64 Amiga Team Effort
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,
          Looking for Amiga news yesterday, I came across the  RC5-64
Challenge, Amiga team page at:

                        distributed.amiga.org/RC5-64/fm_members-3.html

The purpose of this challenge is to test encryption codes, currently with 64
Bit keys, 

Computers all over the net are running small clients which download blocks
from a keyserver when they connect to the internet and then tick away in
the background cracking the keys, one out of billions will decode a
message. It is perfectly legal as the company that developed the codes is
running the competition. 1 week ago 25%of the keyspace had been searched.
  
The Amiga is well supported in this challenge, there are 68k (020 or higher)
and PPC clients. I discovered that the Amiga team, as of two weeks ago, is
ranked 6th overall (Dead Platform ???) having been recently overtaken by a
russian team. another russian team is closing fast. 

I decided to put my PPC card to good use and uphold the Amiga's honour, I
downloaded the client, this was followed by a GUI program, Myzar, which
helps you set it up and operate it. Now I got a little window with progress
indicator and keyspeed stats on my workbench. about six hours running and
I've cracked 11.6 Billion keys so far. (about 12 blocks) 

All are welcome at Team Amiga but they prefer it if at least one of your
computers is an Amiga 

Even bare A1200 14MHz systems can crack these keys and every key cracked and
attributed to Team Amiga helps to keep the russkies at bay. 

Check out this site and think about doing your bit for the Amiga and
Internet security. the client and GUI prog are easy to install and operate.
It only uses spare CPU cycles (Priority -120) and if set up correctly only
links to the server once when you connect to the net, to upload cracked
blocks and refill your buffer file with new blocks to work on later. this
takes about 10-15 seconds at login to grab 50 blocks and upload about 10.
Wouldn't it be nice if an Amiga found the correct key, or better still
finished in top position?

btw my stats now show 12.6 billion   

Kind regards
                      Stead.

It would be great to have some increased support for the Amiga effort. I have
been running the Myzar program in support of the effort for a year or so. Very
simply to set up and just let it run in the background. Myzar shows your stats
and allows you to simply input the completed packets when you choose. Hope to
have all join the effort!

i've been on the Amiga team a good year now... its very satisfying to watch
the team stay up in the top10... although as the 'MightyOne' pointed out,
Russian teams and a Japanese one are closing fast...

we had been fifth for a long time... lets get back up there!!!!!!!! :)

Subject: [just-amiga] RC5-64 Amiga Team Effort
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,
          Looking for Amiga news yesterday, I came across the  RC5-64
Challenge, Amiga team page at:

                        distributed.amiga.org/RC5-64/fm_members-3.html

The purpose of this challenge is to test encryption codes, currently with 64
Bit keys, 

Computers all over the net are running small clients which download blocks
from a keyserver when they connect to the internet and then tick away in
the background cracking the keys, one out of billions will decode a
message. It is perfectly legal as the company that developed the codes is
running the competition. 1 week ago 25%of the keyspace had been searched.
  
The Amiga is well supported in this challenge, there are 68k (020 or higher)
and PPC clients. I discovered that the Amiga team, as of two weeks ago, is
ranked 6th overall (Dead Platform ???) having been recently overtaken by a
russian team. another russian team is closing fast. 

I decided to put my PPC card to good use and uphold the Amiga's honour, I
downloaded the client, this was followed by a GUI program, Myzar, which
helps you set it up and operate it. Now I got a little window with progress
indicator and keyspeed stats on my workbench. about six hours running and
I've cracked 11.6 Billion keys so far. (about 12 blocks) 

All are welcome at Team Amiga but they prefer it if at least one of your
computers is an Amiga 

Even bare A1200 14MHz systems can crack these keys and every key cracked and
attributed to Team Amiga helps to keep the russkies at bay. 

Check out this site and think about doing your bit for the Amiga and
Internet security. the client and GUI prog are easy to install and operate.
It only uses spare CPU cycles (Priority -120) and if set up correctly only
links to the server once when you connect to the net, to upload cracked
blocks and refill your buffer file with new blocks to work on later. this
takes about 10-15 seconds at login to grab 50 blocks and upload about 10.
Wouldn't it be nice if an Amiga found the correct key, or better still
finished in top position?

btw my stats now show 12.6 billion   

Kind regards
                      Stead.

very old news, how did you miss it :)?

I do like the 5th, now 6th position of the Amiga, but
when you think about it, the amiga effort is the
worldwide Amiga effort, where some are just like the
Japanese Linux effort, only one country. Its like on
the Amiga effort, they'd appreciated it if at least
one computer was an Amiga. Can the japanese team
say, we wish one member of your family is japanese
but it doesn't matter if your not from japan, like we
can use PCs and Macs for the Amiga effort, isn't
that slightly off point?

Nextly, twiglets are horrible, marmite and vegimite
also join the horrible gang but fruit pastles are
king... whoops, did i just bring up another food
argument ;)?

Twiglets aren't actually like prestles.

On a last note, i'm jealous of all the americans who
still get to drink Mountain Dew, i loved that drink
but they stopped selling it here in the UK, along
with Tab and Tab Clear... plus this week i had a
lemon crunchie, trust me, your best to avoid these
limited edition and hope they run out soon, they
are terrible.

I'll just leave now!

(Excuse all spelling, grammer, etc mistakes, its
3:48am and i'm actually tired after getting up
at 7:30am g'night!)

   From What I understand, the major Lightwave houses would have to shut 
down if Mountain Dew was pulled fron the market here in the U.S. The joke is 
that as deadlines near, the animators cook Mountain Dew down into a syrup,
mix in some strawberry surge, and call for an I.V. bag.....

Mountain Dew is still available, but Tab of any kind is not.  It was
replaced by diet Coke, which I like, but it isn't Tab.  I've never even
seen Tab Clear.  Did you know Mountain Dew has more caffine than Coke? 
Maybe you could order a case or two here from the states or from
Canada.  We also have diet Mountain Dew, which is pretty good.

I know several people with Amigas on RC5, BTW.  Wonder what the
percentage is?

Subject: [just-amiga] SCSI answer - maybe!!
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Greetings All...

There was some discussion on one of the mail lists recently about why
SCSI  doesn't work on certain Amigas. I found the following which may
help those with this problem.

*--- start Q and A ---*

Q:  Why doesn't SCSI work on the A4000?

A:  It  does. But because of a bug in early versions of the Zorro-III
    DMA  controller  (the "Buster" chip), DMA SCSI controllers didn't
    work properly.

    This  problem  can  be  fixed  (by replacing the early revision 9
    Buster  with  a  revision  11  version) or avoided altogether (by
    using  a SCSI controller that doesn't use the Zorro-III bus, like
    the one built into the Warp Engine accelerator).

*--- end Q and A ---*

I  know  nothing of the technical side of the above, so, please don't
mail  me  with questions as I won't know the answers. Hope this helps
someone.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Subject: [just-amiga] RC5-64 Amiga Team Effort
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,
          Looking for Amiga news yesterday, I came across the  RC5-64
Challenge, Amiga team page at:

                        distributed.amiga.org/RC5-64/fm_members-3.html

The purpose of this challenge is to test encryption codes, currently with 64
Bit keys, 

Computers all over the net are running small clients which download blocks
from a keyserver when they connect to the internet and then tick away in
the background cracking the keys, one out of billions will decode a
message. It is perfectly legal as the company that developed the codes is
running the competition. 1 week ago 25%of the keyspace had been searched.
  
The Amiga is well supported in this challenge, there are 68k (020 or higher)
and PPC clients. I discovered that the Amiga team, as of two weeks ago, is
ranked 6th overall (Dead Platform ???) having been recently overtaken by a
russian team. another russian team is closing fast. 

I decided to put my PPC card to good use and uphold the Amiga's honour, I
downloaded the client, this was followed by a GUI program, Myzar, which
helps you set it up and operate it. Now I got a little window with progress
indicator and keyspeed stats on my workbench. about six hours running and
I've cracked 11.6 Billion keys so far. (about 12 blocks) 

All are welcome at Team Amiga but they prefer it if at least one of your
computers is an Amiga 

Even bare A1200 14MHz systems can crack these keys and every key cracked and
attributed to Team Amiga helps to keep the russkies at bay. 

Check out this site and think about doing your bit for the Amiga and
Internet security. the client and GUI prog are easy to install and operate.
It only uses spare CPU cycles (Priority -120) and if set up correctly only
links to the server once when you connect to the net, to upload cracked
blocks and refill your buffer file with new blocks to work on later. this
takes about 10-15 seconds at login to grab 50 blocks and upload about 10.
Wouldn't it be nice if an Amiga found the correct key, or better still
finished in top position?

btw my stats now show 12.6 billion   

Kind regards
                      Stead.

IINM Heretic II uses that engine, and I've played the demo, and it looks very
nice.
Puts anything we've had so far in the shade.

And it needs a PPC card and a graphics card to get anything special out of it.
I started the demo using the ordinary gfx rendering routines, but when I
switched to the Warp GL version, wow, what a difference. :)

Have a look at http://www.hyperion-software.de

And there are others in the pipe line also.

I did plan to register this myself at the time I played

Yes; how many Amiga users are in the world? Fewer than Japanese Linuxians

Hmm, I think it would be better if only Amigas were used, but I suppose
anything for the cause is good. And you could be running UAE for all we
know...

Starbursts? I still call them Opal Fruits. Fruit pastles are made by the
same people, but are like suger coated jelly sweets. (For the Americans,
not jelly as in jam, jelly as in wobbly fruity stuff, but a bit stiffer in
this case)

Chalming.

Hello,
          to all who received 3 copies of my RC5 mail. terribly sorry about
that ...
;EXCUSE BEGIN
    It appears that my mail from just-amiga got delayed by three days, still
don't know why. so when i sent the first mail it didn't come back to me as
it usually does with my just-amiga download. leading me to suppose it
hadn't arrived. so i checked the address from another mail in my archive
and discovered that onelist was now egroups, so i slapped my forehead and
thought what a silly bunt. then i re-addressed it and sent it again. that
never came back to me either,  i thought the re-addressing process in YAM
had decided not to send it twice 8)  so i moved it to outgoing and i sent
it again, meanwhile i was testing my e-mail by mailing myself test after
test all of which returned within 15 minutes. it was only when i spoke to
Chris Seward on IRC i discovered that my just-amiga mail was missing and he
kindly mailed me to test from outside the demon server. his mail duly
arrived and i thought my subscription to just-amiga had been cancelled. so
i subscribed again and today received a mail from egroups dated 11/06/2K
telling me that i was already a member and why did i want to subscribe
again. the interesting thing is that all my just amiga mail has arrived
today also. 11 messages 9-11th jun.  i think some are still missing but
they might still be in cyberspace awaiting re-entry so i'll hang on for a
bit yet. has the mailing frequency changed since egroups took over or is
there now a delay of 3-4 days? it used to be quite fast i suppose i'll find
out when i fire this up the wire and i promise i'll only send it once this
time 8)

 terribly sorry once again 8(
;EXCUSE END

when i found out my mail had arrived all three times i thought i would be
slaughtered on the list so i went on the web and found the list in all its
technicolour glory, I was pleasantly surprised to find mostly support for
the team effort and hope it inspired somebody to investigate further and
join in. one mail (you know who you are....8)  ) expressed the view that
using a PC as part of the team effort defeated the object of an amiga team.
the point is High Profile, the general population need to be reminded of
things quite often or they forget quickly. as the Amiga developer systems
are approaching launch(or they may already be out as I can't find recent
reliable news lately) the name Amiga will be more readily recognised by
non-Amiga users if they hear it more often. a lot of people buy a computer
with no clear idea of what they want to do with it. I know people who
bought the latest rocket powered PC and just play games, ok it's a valid
use. but the impression people get is power = status. if the Amiga Team
does well the name will be propagated throughout the PC press and amiga
will sell more systems. As we all know software houses will only write
software for a large user base so if the new amigas are to survive past the
initial commissioned software releases they need to sell lots of units.
then we may become more of a mainstream community rather than a
enthusiastic cult which appears to dwindle daily. now i don't know exactly
how many teams are competing but Team Amiga are team 200 so possibly more
than 200 teams in it. and we are currently in 6th place. as i have already
said , not bad for a dead platform 8). We as a community should support
this effort and run this client on as many machines as we have access to. I
am an Amiga user ( i have expressed my distaste at the term Amigan in a
previous mail) but I also have a PII PC running Windoze 98, 266MHz of
crippled power, the client is running on this machine also, its keys/sec
rate is only slightly higher than my 160MHz PPC card and doesn't multitask
very well at all, the simplest task will slow it down or stop it
completely, the average keyrates are a lot slower than my miggy's . The
Amiga is still my main computer, my Internet connection is via my miggy,
all my printing is done with the miggy, all my graphics software is on the
miggy. the PC is used for a scanner interface and fed into the miggy via
PC2Amiga, also i have UAE set up on it and the RC5 client. first and
foremost i am an Amiga user. should i not use this fast peripheral to aid
my main computer in this team effort. i think i should and if i could work
these bloody keys out with a pencil and paper i would be doing that too 8).
If it helps the new Amigas to finally appear and survive I would show my
a*se in woolies window. and after all the waiting wouldn't you ?  8)

Apologies for the Third time 8)

BTW its a Mac team in first place (that should be good for a few more
members 8)  )

my current stats are 114 Billion Total Keys processed after 4 days running  
           (that answers somebody's question 8)   )

Go for it...

Does anyone know, how to start other programs from own program? If I try use dos library's
CreateProc() -routine, system crashes if started program tries print something.
How can I provide output handle to the new process? Or do I need to use
other libraryroutines, like RunCommand or CreateNewProc. I didn't manage to get
them work, they just did nothing.

Look at the autodocs for System() and SystemTagList(); I think
they might provide the functionality you need.

Unacceptable. These routines wait until the launched cli command returns.
I want to send Ctrl-C to stop it. If I use
Execute(), System() etc. routines I need to 'run' the command and then dig out the task
name. I think this is too complex. I believe that If can manage to start the
other program as process, I can send Ctrl-C to it's messageport.

I simply used LoadSeg() and then send the Seglist to RunCommand(). But RunCommand
doesn't do anything! Even if I set the registers to wrong values on purpose, it
won't even crash the machine. RunCommand probably checks the containing of the
registers, and won't do anything if something is wrong.

Subject: [just-amiga] Quarterback Tools
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone out there has ever come across an error 
message in Quarterback Tools:  "Unable to get disk cache buffer".  
This occurs when I am doing a file check on a 1.1 gig partition of my 
hard drive, and always occurs at the same place (53% complete).  I 
have 18 meg installed in my A4000 (2 meg chip, 16 fast), and have the 
stack set at 60000, but to no avail.  I have even tried 2 different 
versions of the program (2.0 and 2.02), but this still has the same 
effect, stopping in exactly the same place with the same error.  Any 
help would be appreciated, thanking in advance...

I'll put you out of your misery ;-)

This is a quick translation to C of some of my E code, so excuse simple
mistakes.  The variables are typed as in the autodocs:


    if( taskcode=NewLoadSeg( "PROGDIR:PlugIn/Log/Log", null ) )
    {
         if( ( smlog_task = CreateNewProc( NP_NAME, "SM-Log", NP_SEGLIST,
taskcode, NP_INPUT, Input(), NP_OUTPUT, Output(), NP_CLOSEINPUT, FALSE,
NP_CLOSEOUTPUT, FALSE, NP_STACKSIZE, 8192, NP_COPYVARS, FALSE ) == null ) )

            Raise( "MEM" );      // fail

    }
    else
        PutStr("LoadSeg() failed on Log plugin\n");

Yes, all the time.

I think there's a working space in the program which is of fixed size. The
programmer probably set it to support the biggest possible hard disk size he
could imagine...  Which is going to be less than you can get now :)

Besides, Quarterback doesn't/can't support harddisks over 4GB anyway so its
usefullness is limited.

The way to do this is to create a new process, send a message with
all your data, have it run the command and reply to your message
port. The code is as follows :

// ****** make up a struct something like this..
struct LaunchMessage 
{   struct Message rm_Node;    // standard EXEC message structure
    // from hereon your struct can contain all your data...
    UBYTE commandline[256];
    LONG result;
    // etc..
};

// ******* This is the function that launches the command, waits
// ******* for the result and returns when finished.
__saveds void launcher (void)
{
   struct Process *myself = (struct Process *)FindTask(NULL);
   struct LaunchMessage *mess;

   // get the message that you prepared..
   WaitPort(&myself->pr_MsgPort);
   mess = (struct LaunchMessage *)GetMsg(&myself->pr_MsgPort);

   // run the commandline
   mess->result = SystemTags (mess->commandline,
               SYS_Input, 	NULL, SYS_Output,  (supply a con:),
               // there are many tags you can use here.. 
               TAG_END);

    // if fail, call IoErr() etc....

    Forbid();
    ReplyMsg((struct Message *)mess);
    // process ends here
}

// ****** the above function can be called as follows...
BOOL launchCommand (struct MsgPort *myport, char *comline)
{
    struct LaunchMessage *mess;
    struct Process *child;

    // prepare your message...
    if (!(mess = AllocVec(sizeof(struct LaunchMessage), MEMF_CLEAR)))
         return (0);

    stccpy (mess->commandline, comline, 255);
    mess->rm_Node.mn_Length	= sizeof(struct LaunchMessage);
    mess->rm_Node.mn_ReplyPort = myport;

    // launch the command..
    child = CreateNewProcTags (NP_Entry, launcher, 
                      // add tags etc..
                      TAG_END);

     if (child == NULL)
     {    FreeVec(mess);
          return (0);
     }

     // send the message to the new process...
     PutMsg(&child->pr_MsgPort, (struct Message *)mess);
     return (1);

     // when the command completes the message will be returned at
     // your port "myport" where you must free it.
}

Excuse any typing errors.. I cut/hacked/pasted from my code..

BTW to stop it with control-C is not simple, since it must be entered
at the shell that launched the program which in this case does not
exist.. You have to use Break and/or other methods.

Have you tried DiskSalv? It was written by Dave Haynie, who knows a

I have tried used disksalv before and have version 4, but I was using 
Quarterback Tools in this case because the partition I was testing 
has a few bad blocks, and I need to mark them as unusable, something 
which disksalv doesn't do. The file check was to identify any 
affected files, salvage them off the partition, and then mark the 
affected blocks as bad.  Does anyone know of any other program that 
will mark bad blocks while there are still files on a volume, because 
I don't want to have to move all the files off to do a format?? (I 
know there are some formatting programs with this ability). Any help 
would be appreciated.

I tried to convert this to Asm. Apparently I need the offsets for each NP_*, but
they don't make sense in dos/dostags.h. It says:
#define NP_Dummy  (TAG_USER + 1000)
#define NP_Seglist  (NP_Dummy + 1)
#define NP_FreeSegList  (NP_Dummy + 2) and so on...

These are all 1 longword pointers & variables? These are somekind of BCPL
bulls*it or what? When playing with LoadSeg, I encountered to small code which
converts the output of LoadSeg() to BCPL.

Thx for the help. This is however too complex for me (now).      
I'll try to get the CreateNewProc() work first...

Aha! Of course I can't break it that way. Break? The CLI command?
That way I could simply start the command with dos.library's
Execute() like this: "Run >NIL: <program>" and later I could
Execute() "TaskBreak <command>". This is simple, but I wanted
to make code that is able to break the program it started
by sending Ctrl-C to it (somehow).

Subject: [just-amiga] Installing Dataflyer SCSI+
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

    I'm installing a DF SCSI+ in an A4000 Desktop.  I can follow
instructions very well so, I have it in the machine.  I understand that no
one will know what my jumper settings should be on all these drives, but my
question is that in the trouble shooting section it says that if my LED
drive light stays on and I'm sure that it is not verifing a drive that the
polarity needs to be changed going to the LED.  Then it say to reffer to
the installing hardware section.  I have found nothing on the "LED"  in
this section nor in the entire book.  It is booting and working  fine
except for the 2nd ide device in the chain which is a cd-rom.  I'm using
AmiCDFS.  A  Syquest ext. 88m removeable cart. drive is working fine.

Kind regards

The way I do that (in C) is to find the task that I launched 
(by walking the task list) and signal it. I tried many other
ways but couldn't get it to work - this works great..
The code I used is :

BOOL breaktask (UBYTE *name)
{
LONG c, max;
UBYTE *p;
struct CommandLineInterface *cli;
struct Process *proc;

max = MaxCli();  // how many cli's are open?

for (c=1; c<=max; ++c)
{  proc = FindCliProc(c);
   if (proc)
   {   cli  = (struct CommandLineInterface *)(BADDR(proc->pr_CLI));
       if (cli)
       {   // get process name
           p = (UBYTE *)(BADDR(cli->cli_CommandName));
           // name starts on next byte
           ++p;
           if ((stricmp(name, p))==0)
           {   // send a control-c - you can also OR ctrl-D etc..
               Signal (&proc->pr_Task, SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
               return (1);
           }
}   }  }

return (0);
}

Note that the task name is the full command and path 
name (ie dh0:mypath/myprog) so you either do some parsing 
or provide the exact name.

Hi,
 On Thursday June 15 2000, Jani Kannisto said to Neil Williams:

Ah, all righty then.

 JK> #define NP_Dummy  (TAG_USER + 1000)

These are just tag values you pass through, not offsets.  A tag is just a
marker which says 'after me, this data follows.'  So for each tag, also pass
one data item - all longwords.

 JK> These are all 1 longword pointers & variables? These are somekind of

This isn't BCPL - it's a TagList: Tags and Tag Data.  Don't use the BCPL
functions like LoadSeg() unless you're running OS 1.3, use NewLoadSeg() etc.
etc.

In assembler, you create a tag list (in this example, statically) like this:

tags        dc.l  NP_NAME, "SM-Log"
            dc.l  NP_SEGLIST, <seglist pointer>
            dc.l  TAG_END       ; or 0

You then pass a pointer to 'tags' in the correct register.  TagLists are used
because they are extensible - you can add four million million parameters to a
function over several versions, and not introduce any incompatibilities.

You might want to look on AmiNet for example assembler programs...

If you want more clarification, just ask.

Yeah, AmibackTools. I used to use it all the time when I had FFS
formatted partitions, and found it a lot less buggy than QBTools. It
will create a file that will be written to the bad blocks and sit on
the partition. If you then just set the hide flag in the protection
flags, you can happily ignore it; unless you de-fragment the drive,
when you'll need to re-map the blocks again.

Hope this helps

The output from LoadSeg() is a BPTR....

A BPTR  is just a  LONG  dressed up in drag,
but the value it contains is a byte address / 4
or if you prefer, the longword address....

If you mean to convert the BPTR(bcpl pointer) 
to an APTR(byte pointer),  
just do:     pointer <<= 2;        ( multiply  x4 )

I'm not sure if it requires a format to do it, but HDToolbox can mark
bad blocks.

I haven't tried it, but it did fix my wife's HD when DiskSalve wouldn't
touch it, and that is AmiBack tools in repair mode -- a friend
recommended it.  Of course, like both Quarterback and DiskSalve, it
will only work on partitions 2gigs or less and HD's formated to 4gigs
or less.  You can do it with HDToolbox too (yuck).

Hi,

Just like to thank everbody who responded to my query.  I will give 
Amiback Tools a go, and try hdtoolbox as a last resort (I thought you 
had to know the block numbers already though with this, and if so, 
how do you find them??):)

Many thanks again, keep the flag flying ;)

There is a function in HDToolBox called *Verify Data on Drive* that will
update the badblocks list for you.

Hi Jeff,

I'll bet your memory is mostly used up or otherwise fragmented. Try 
booting without a startup-sequence (holding both mouse buttons down on 
boot usually does it or a CNTL-D in the dos shell) and then run QBtools 
from a well stacked shell and see if that helps. There might also be a 
way of limiting QBtools buffer, but I'm not sure. DiskSalv and ABtools 
are alternatives.

On thinking about this message for a few more minutes and because it's 
stopping at 'exactly the same place'. I'll bet a serious error is causing 
the program to overrun the buffer at that point (probably a looping affair)
and it is possible that 'other' recovery programs might handle that error 
in a different way.

Hello,
We at AIO are always looking to improve things, so in that effort I have an
announcement/request.  For a few months I've been trying to find someone
willing/able to do a good programming column without success.  So, I'm
sending out this cattle-call to anyone that would like to do a monthly
column on programming tips, basics, advanced tips, etc, for either C/C++ or
ARexx.  If you think you have the knowledge and are willing to commit to a
monthly column, then please email me at-

columns@aio.co.uk

You'll be paid nothing more then the gratitude of the Amiga Community and
readers of AIO.

Subject: [just-amiga] PAL to NTSC
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-2022-JP
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am after software to switch screen modes between PAL and NTSC for games
such as F1GP. I have had a look on Aminet but cannot find anything suitable.
I currently use X-Panel to switch modes but instead of using this I want
this to happen automatically. Any suggestions??

And something to switch back again...

Cheers

Subject: [just-amiga] Old Games
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have recently been going through my old games collection to see they all
work. Many of them won't work unless I use the 'original chip' and 'disable
CPU cache' setting on the early start-up menu. Other just won't work at all.
I have recently installed OS3.5 and don't know whether this is the cause. I
believe there is software available to downgrade (or is it degrade) my
operating system. Is this true? Can anyone help me?

I found a picture on one of my Amiga CD ROMs. I have searched them all
(Approx. 50 of them) for a picture that I cannot seem to find. The picture
is of a human face made up of various animals, whales, chimps, fish etc.

It's a great picture but I cannot remember where it came from.

Can anyone help?

   Your best bet to get old games working is to find / download from aminet a harddrive installer for them. This usually includes a fix for the game to get it working on modern amigas.

See ya :)

   I think there is a program (killAGA or sommin similar) that can be set up to swich the screenmode to pal/ntsc when you run a game.

I don't remember the picture you noted, but from the description you give of
it, I suppose it is by Arcimboldo an Italian reinassance painter.

Subject: [just-amiga] 2.1 gig HDD
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm getting a 2.1 gig Seagate HDD to replace my now dead internal
40meg HDD in my 1200. I've never owned a HDD this large before and
would appreciate any advise/tips on how to partition the drive. .

The gent who I'm buying it from will be partitioning the drive for me.
The question is, what's a good size for the various partitions on a
drive this large. 

One of my concerns is I have an external Connor 540 meg HDD in a
Dataflyer XDS. This is spilt up into two 150meg (DH2 & DH3) partitions
and one 220meg (PCC) partition. At the moment, I'm booting off of DH2
(by holding down both mouse buttons and having given that drive a -1
priority). As this drive is my primary data drive, I don't want to
lose access to it when I install the new drive. The dead 40meg was
split into 2 20meg partitions (DH0 & DH1). 

I've never had to install a new drive in my 1200, so I'm a bit unsure
about what to expect. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

speaking from too much hd experience, I'd seriously recommend 2 things,
firstly either 2 x 500 meg partitions and a 1 gig, or 3 partitions of equal
size 700 meg roughly...

you could split in into 2 even or uneven parts, but I wouldn't unless you
can back it all up, I've found when I get a partition go haywire I can
simply back up most of the data on a partition to another partition then
reformat the sutffed partition, copy it all back, and away you go again...

either way I'd use PFS on it...

Regards

the only other thing I forgot to mention, was if it's a 3.5" drive and the
1200 isn't a tower, and has an accelerator (especially 040) you may incur
power and or heat problems...

heat - oh well, not really that bad, just get's real warm
power - use an A500 power supply, they have the perfect amount of guts to
runs a decked out 1200 I've got lots of stuff hanging off mine...

Hello, Derek.


You wrote at 22-Jun-00 concerning "*[just-amiga] 2.1 gig HDD*":

One important thing is to exchange your power supply, because the
original is not sufficient for new harddrives!
Either you will get read/write errors or the drive won't even begin
to start.

For partitioning I recommend a 100 MB 'sys' partition only reserved
for your operating system. Don't mess non OS related stuff with
this partition, so you easily can upgrade to a newer OS.

The rest of your HD may be partitioned as you like, but IMHO it is
better to have some small partitions (e.g. named 'work', 'internet',
'docs', and so on) than one large.

Small partitions ar easier to backup, and if the partition will be
damaged, only these datas are lost.

Furthermore, you should reserve one partition to backup another
partition to the hd itself. This must be larger then the largest of
the other partitions, of course.

Browser caches will be the first which may damage a whole partition.
So, you are on the secure side, if you have an own 'cache' partition 
for these purposes and for other temporary data (50-100MB).

It is a good idea to store all data delivered from programs like
Finalwriter, SBase, Yam to an own 'data' partition.

If you are using FFS, it is strongly recommended to have small 
partitions, otherwise you will get an endless validating time,
if an error occurs when writing to HD.


Regards, Armin

Before I start please don't complain about the disclaimer. I am working to
get rid of it. If it annoys you that much please don't respond (unless you
can help of course), it will only wind you up even more.

I want to tower my Amiga. I am considering purchasing an A1200 Power Tower
from, yes, Power Computing, England!
Does anyone out there have any reasons not to buy the power tower and if so
can they recommend something else?

Cheers for now

point, not true in fact, I have had a 2.5" drive, a 3.5" drive an external
floppy and an 030 on a standard 1200 power supply...

having said that, I have run a cd rom, a 3.5" hd, 060, external floppy, and
a scsi card as wel of the 500 power supply...

what is the new 2.1 gig 2.5" or 3.5" ?

I've been using mine for a while now and haven't found anything majorly
wrong with the design.

2 dumb questions but I'm on brain lock.
1.)  I can't get my 4.2g harddrive to use the full space nor to except a
partition larger than 1 G.  I've done it before but just forgot how to do it
and the os3.5 site suggestion doesn't work and I forgot the help page I used
originally.
2.) Can you use a zip disk to transfer a file between a PC and an Amiga, I
thought I've done that before also, but have forgotten how.
Suggestions, Please.
Thanks,
Mike Pearson

If I recall right, the answer to both questions is yes, but I have had no
need to personally do either.  Anyone here have first hand experience on the

   Well, when I had a 2.1 gig harddrive, I gave 100 megs to Workbench, 1.5 gigs to a partition called Work: Where I put all my stuff and gave my Mac Emulator the last 500 megs.

the answer to question no 2 is yes. if you have a zip drive that uses the parallel port that is. any other connections i don't know but SCSI should also work and perhaps IDE too. on aminet there is a description on how to make a converter for your parallel zip drive. now, this is for amiga os 3.0-3.1. on 3.5 it might be easier, i don't know. anyway, you have to make a converter in that case. i've made one myself with great success. here's the file.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello All @ just-amiga,
Recent delays in recieving and sending mail have resulted in an accumulation
of posts to and from friends I have on a USA site.
I want simply to capture text contents of actual letters so I can print them
and deal coherently with them.
I've saved them in read?xxxxx  form.
This produces masses of data that is very tedious to edit.
Can't seem to impot them to Wordworth IV except 1 file at a time - again
massively tedious.
All I want is a printout of the letters without loads of ~rest of page info' 
either plain text or HTML.
There must be a way to do it.
Most grateful for help in this matter.
Wouldn't like friends to expire before I work it out myself ;-)

,
RegardsJoe

   Relax, music cd's with videos on them are just normal data/audio cd's. You just load the movie file up as you would one saved on your harddrive, or magazine cover cd etc.

   You only need to use direct CD access for /real/ video cd's, as they use a special CD format.

See ya :)

Does anyone here have the Yes CD "The Ladder"? There is sopposed to be a
demo of the Homeworld PC-game on the CD, but I can't get my drive to
even recognize that the CD is in it. The drive works fine with other
music CDs.

Does YAM 2.0 have an option in the save requester to allow you to choose
how much header information gets saved with the email? I know THOR does.
It allows me to save the whole blamed thing, just the minimal header
stuff, or no header stuff at all.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello,

Okay, being the fool I am, I deleted some fles from my work: partition
(FFS), and now I'd like them back. I tried retrieving them with Disksalv
2's undelete and salvage options, and the files do show up the the rescued
files list. However, I select what I want resurrected, and when I change
the output put to the place I want, the system goes into a partial freeze.
That is, Disksalv and WB cease responding, but TolleUhr and Screentab
appear to still be alive.

The files aren't really important, but if I could get them back it would be
nice.


Sooner,

        Sandy, 6 months; blimey, can we last that long?

   Boot with no startup sequence and run it from CLI (a patch may need to access work for some reason, and hangs workbench and disksalv)

   Also, make sure the place you choose to retrieve the files to isn't anything do to with Work:   Use a drawer on SYS: or ram: or some other partition.

It's okay, I wasn't doing that. Actually, I tried Ram: and Linux:, which is
