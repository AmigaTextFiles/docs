Our house isn't very special. It is quite big, seven floors high. We had an
intergalactic zoo in it. One day we were just about to receive an animal
shipment...

The shipment arrived at the 27th of October. It was brought from the planet
Junglion, where we had been visiting a year ago to get to know the local
animals. When the shipment package was opened, we found inside a couple of
gorzans, a Gigantosaurus child fed with buzzers, and a school of opera fish in
a soundproof aquarium. We got the animals quite easily to the zoo. Only the
Gigantosaurus child caused trouble. It had eaten all the buzzers and was making
noise, until we noticed to feed it with dingoes, which taste just about the
same.
  After getting the animals to their cages we wrote in our diary "Animal
shipment from Junglion received 27th October 1991", and wondered why we had
circled the 11th of November. But far away from here was somebody, who knew it
all too well. He was a ghost, though at that moment on a vacation.

We lived happily for some time and paid for the shipment the 8th of November to
the planet Zomem, whose colony planet Junglion is. On the 9th day the night
beetles stopped buzzing. On the 10th day the opera fish also looked afraid. At
19:45 o'clock our technic, Jehm Merkpork, got two scared dogs in his lap. At
20:07 I, animal expert Jeemi Bilisdo, got a swarm of iron beetles in my lap. At
20:20 o'clock a crying tiger crashed into the lap of our janitor Jyssa Nirdam.
I gave the iron beetles some papapalm to eat and Jyssa cleaned the tiger's
cage. Then we went to sleep.

In the morning our ichtyologist Jirme Ihegis was thoroughly wet. The opera fish
had screamed so high, that the aquarium class had broken. Jehm went to fix it
and went pale with fear. In front of him floated a ghost just as pale. It had
come to celebrate the 880th anniversary of his forefather at 11:11 o'clock.
  His forefather had been the old ghost of the house in the 12th century. He
had come here 11.11.1111 at 11:11 o'clock and scared the staff that lived in
the brewery that had been here in that time. The brewery was demolished on the
3th of December after being empty for 20 days.
  Our ghost had decided to do the same now, 880 years later. But it wouldn't
do, for on the 7th of December the baronling Jera Typrewam with his nephew Jyhi
Rijimöga was coming to visit us. We couldn't just disappoint them with a
demolished zoo. So we had to chase the ghost away.

We went straight to work. Jyssa armed himself with a silver broom, Jehm
installed ghost-locks on the doors and I prepared myself for negotiations. The
ghost was coming. I sat at the table and welcomed him. He said in a scary
voice: "What is the meaning of this?" I replied in a voice just as scary: "We
have negotiations to make."
  I invited the ghost to sit down, but he just slid through the chair, so he
had to float in front of me. I asked him: "Didn't your forefather haunt this
place enough?", and he replied: "No. We have to celebrate his anniversary
every now and then. And now is his 880th birthday." I insisted: "But it won't
do! We have guests." The ghost asked: "When can I come, then?" so I replied:
"Come on the 888th birthday 11th November 1999." The ghost agreed to hat. He
left saying: "See you in 8 years!"

That was that. We cleaned the place up quickly and prepared the state visit for
three weeks. When Jera and Jyhi came at last, Jyhi sighed: "These animals are
so boring! I wish you had ghosts!" We heard ourselves sigh: "Oh no!" and Jirme
suggested: "Couldn't you come back here in the year 1999?"
