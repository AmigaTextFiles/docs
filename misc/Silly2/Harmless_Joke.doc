            It all started as a harmless joke


Darryl was my friend. I had known him since birth. He was exactly the same age
as me, so naturally I was informed of his birth, and he of mine.
  I had always thought there was something very peculiar about Darryl. Either
he was mad or I was. It was only later that I came to the conclusion that we
both were. That served, of course, not only to unite us, but also to isolate us
from anybody else.

One day, when we were pondering about the very essence of truth, things and
stuff like that, I said a fatal thing to him. What I said was (quite verbatim)
"But I don't even know if you exist!"
  Darryl's reply was puzzling. He said "I don't!" and vanished. I was unable to
see, hear, touch, taste or smell him, but somehow I was aware of his constant
presence. His thoughts entered my head. At first I thought mine must have
entered his head too, but then I thought it was false, since I knew there was
no head for them to enter.
  Darryl existed only in my head. I could not sense him as an external being,
and nobody else even knew there was any Darryl.

I grew worried. Just as vacuum craves air, a sudden discontinuation of
existence attracts existence - matter - to itself. I could already feel my
matter slowly turning into Darryl. He would be all right, physically existent
and all that, but what about me?
  I thought about Darryl. In my thoughts I said: "Darryl! Hear me! Please exist
again, I cannot possibly survive turning into you!" And he answered. He said -
thought - "Why did you do this to me?" I was in a panic. I replied that what I
said about his existence back then had only been a joke, whose point he
apparently had failed to get.

"All right", he said, "I will cure your problems." He thought about a lump of
granite exactly of his mass, which took the form of a square circle. It
appeared. It was the first time I had seen a square circle in my life. It was
strangely beautiful, yet I dared not look at it for a longer time. I knew
Darryl had made it - he hadn't created it, he had just forced it into
existence.
  But the main thing was that it had stopped the drain of existence Darryl's
disappearance had created. I was no longer turning into Darryl. I was glad.
  But his thoughts were still in my head. He haunted me in a curiously mad kind
of way. "But hey!" I thought. "This will do - it could be worse!"
