Subject: [just-amiga] Trying to meet other UK users.

From: Stuart Luscombe <stuart.luscombe@mcmail.com>

Hi,

	I'm trying to get in touch with other Amiga users in the UK,
not only to expand my dire software collection, but to chat to other
ppl who obvioulsy have the brains to like such a class machine! :)

	BTW, is there ANY way to make my PC's floppy drive think
its an Amiga floppy drive and transfer files to disk from my HD?

This is the story. When I was about to upgrade my 500 to the 1200, I sold
of the 500 with some games and peripherals in order to finance the A1200.
Pinball Dreams was one game that the buyer insisted he wanted. Well,
it was either that or not getting it sold so the choice was easy. Then
some years passed, and last year or so I wanted to play it again. Tried to
get hold of it second hand. No luck. Then I got hold of a cracked version
that I tried. Won´t work. Well, it loads and I can choose what table
to run. The table loads, displays and the music can be heard. But it
doesn´t react to keypresses. Serves me right for selling the original in
the first place I guess. Not to mention getting a pirate copy when the original
was nowhere to be found. 

So if anyone´s got the original Pinball Dreams, and it stills work on todays
machines, to sell - I´d buy it in an instant.
Preferably one in sweden as it would make things a lot easier.

Not so easy. However, you can let all settings relevant for CDFSPrefs in 
the file and only add the "others" to the ToolTypes, e.g. UNIT, DEVICE or 
ACTIVATE. As values in the tooltypes override those in the mountfile, this 
shouls work fine.

Subject: [just-amiga] IDEfix & Blizzard Boards

From: Alan Paynter <a.paynter@zoo.co.uk>

Hi,
Thanx to all 10+ of you, for your useful and varied replies.In particular
to Oliver Kastl. I took a look at www.jschoenfield.com/eindex, Oliver,
wish I had knowledge of the Express Adaptor before I had the Powerflyer,
which required me to also upgrade to a Tower :-) :-(  - Im broke now.
Interesting also my personal point, the Powerflyer gives me a speed increase
from 1.85 to 4.5 Kb/Sec.(2.5x), though up to 10x is claimed possible.
The New Express Adaptor Claims 5.1 Kb/sec.
I think claims of both systems are outrageous, as AFAIK any CDrom on the
system will pull the max speed back.Not that I complain about 2.5x.

Yes, my friend has a buffered interface,so he is assured by the seller.
Knackered CDrom? No. Hes also tried a new 24speed.
Cant answer much of the other stuff for him, except I think its one of those
Escom Boards, so Ill put all your remarks into a printed iterary Work as a
start :-)
The "black box" as described by Oliver is particularly intriguing, -
see Web page above.So the other one is green, then.
I take it this is the same as "the older one" as described by Sami.
Again, have no idea what colour is under my desperate friend's 1200 case,
he tells me he is about to either give up the Ami or go back to nursery
class :-/
Not likely he will take his 1200 back to the shop AGAIN.
Sami - is your Atapi device V113.1 old or new. If its old, maybe you can
attach it to an e-mail for me ? We'll try anything simple I suppose.
Lasly (maybe).. where is this Atapi Speed 3 ?. I have seen SetAtapiSpeed,
which comes with several of the Atapi drivers AFAIK,and works automatically
without command, but is Atapi Speed 3 something new I've missed?

I have found that if you have had errors with an IDE drive with the wrong
MaxTransfer value, then sometimes just setting it to 0x1fe00  will 
NOT always make all your problems go away..

It apparently had causes some corruption within the filing system too.

You have to back up all the files, Re-Format the partition,
 (with the correct MaxTransfer set)  Then copy all the files back into
the partition.

This should then fix all the strange problems you may have.

Subject: [just-amiga] Encryption (transparent)

From: Sridhar Iyer <sridhar.i@usa.net>

I had asked sometime back about methods of encryption to use with data
files. I had mentioned that I had been using PPloadseg, to which it was
rightly pointed out that PPLoadseg was an compressor for libs, devs etc.
What i meant to say was until PP was active these compressed devices were
encrypted to the AVG user. So I was assured of some level of protection.

Now what I am searching for is something that will giv me a transparent
security cover. ie Anims, IFF images, Fonts work on my machines but just
filched from my machine will not enable them to work on others! And mind
you the user level here is just a notch or two above novice!! [ And I must
be at least a dozen notches above novice. ( And I am , Oh , SO modest!!)  ]

Danke once again to all those who pointed me to SCSImount. Shall try it out.

Namaskaaram ( = Greetings. In Tamil )
Sridhar.

Subject: [just-amiga] Pinball Fantasies on 060

From: Mark Tierno <drstrange@usa.net>

Just a note on this Pinball Fantasies won't run on an 060 stuff:  I got an 060
and Pinball Fantasies on my Hard Drive- works just fine.  Maybe it just
doesn't like your graphics board?  (I usually use Nocyber for such things).
  Anyway, if it matters:
   Setup:
          A4000/060- CyberStorm MK II with Fast Winde SCSI
          CV64 w/4megs ram
          ~34 MB RAM
          4X CD ROM
          lots of hacks and utilities

My fault. I should be more precise in what I post....
Atapi Speed 3 was meant as the result of doing a SetAtapiSpeed 
atapi.device x 3 (x is the unit).
BTW, if you have IDEfix or LoadIDE in your s:startup-sequence, you can use 
IDEfixPrefs to modify the Atapi Speed.

Any files that were corrupted due to a bad MaxTransfer value will
still be corrupted when you correct the MaxTransfer. Any affected
files will have to be reinstalled.

I don´t know if this software will do what you want but you can check for
yourself. It´s a piece of software that encrypts files written on the
fly so it should do what you want but no warranties.

The shareware demo is at http://wwwrzstud.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/~un60/DiskProtection/
I don´t know if it´s supported anymore though, the author is perhaps too
busy with MakeCD.

Subject: [just-amiga] Graphics Cards

From: "David McMinn" <D.McMinn@eee.rgu.ac.uk>

 I just seen a web page for a supplier of Picasso IV and it said that 
you need OS3.1 minimum. End of story. I checked out the dreaded 
Blittersoft's page (I do now have my 1260 and its great) and they say 
OS3.1 is highly recommended. Why?

 Also on a similar note, if the Picasso IV can have its own 
bridgeboard allowing the board to have a local PCi bus, why isn't 
there a board which does just the Zorro->Pci bus bridge, or even 
better a 1200 daughterboard like the Micronik one which provides 
Zorro slot and PCi slots, but with its own bridge so that the Amiga 
could use the PCi slots as well. Then we'd all be able to use the 
cheap PCi SVGA and 3D cards that have been available for PCs for ages 
(assuming someone was able to write drivers for them). Imagine, being 
able to run an Amiga version of GLQuake on a Voodoo/Voodoo2 3D card. 
Mmmm.

  Certainly, someone would be able to write AMIGA drivers for PCI cards
currently available for PCs. The question is: would anyone bother? Just
take a look at the Mac world to find the answer. Macs have been shipping
with a PCI bus for quite a long time. During this time, every card
manufacturer had the chance to write drivers for Macintosh. Hardly anyone
did, nevertheless!

That reminds me, does anyone else have a problem withTP6 that worked 
with TP4. It is not my current set up as I had this both before and after 
reinstalling a new hard drive.

With TP5 I could alter the Contrast and Gamma settings for coloured 
printout, I think it is in Gfx but am at work at the moment so cannot 
check. Unless I leave both at the default settings in TP6 it crashes every 
time I try to print, using the default is OK but not always what I want. I 
could use any Contrast or Gamma I liked in TP4 with no bother at all.

Oddly if I click the button to the right (can't remeber what it is called) I 
can alter the Gamma for individual colours, say lower Red to get a darker 
red  printout and can print that out fine.


Bill.

Subject: [just-amiga] looking for drivers

From: Mark Tierno <drstrange@usa.net>

I just saw a flat bed scanner in the store, ScanAce 630p by Pacific Image
Electronics (30-bit), for $59.97.  Problem.
  1) I never heard of them, so
  2) I don't know if there's any drivers (shareware/freeware) for it.
Anyone know of such drivers, or of this brand of scanner (is it compatible
with drivers for other scanner types?
Feedback is appreciated, because if it's cheap enough I may be getting a
scanner next month

Later.

Subject: [just-amiga] AIO Staff still wanted!

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Dear ALL,
      As per usual i'm still hunting for a couple of new editors to
take over various roles at AIO. Below is a list and description
of what will be involved.

*Games Editor 2* : The second games reviewer would be required
to review at least 2-3 games a month from various free sources
such as Aminet and other freely available sources. There is a chance
of some commercial games to review.

*Web Editor* : The web editor would write one colum per month about
5 different web sites of interest they have come across, being Amiga
or general interesting web sites. Small text about 4 of them and your
'pick of the month' should be explained in detail for the 5th.

*News Editor* : The news editor would be required to find as much
news each month as possible with a minimum of 6 news storys. They
can be obtained from amiga news sources like the amiga web
directory and also chasing up developers and programmers for
any latest news from them. *Benifit *: You will find out interesting
news before anyone else.

If you can help or would like to write the odd review or article
we are waiting to hear from you, thanks for your support!
Contact me via any of the listed contact methods in my tagline.

Kind Regards!

Subject: [just-amiga] Donate and WIN

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Hello all, I'm trying to raise funds for Amiga Information Online
to purchase a registered web domain in the format of www.aioworld.com
or something similar. I am doing this to make it easy to gain access
to AIO and then also add a JUST-AMiGA mailing list section at
www.aioworld.com/ja/ so it will benifit many people and raise awareness
and readership of AIO. To make this happen we are pleaing that if
it is possible you can send *£5.00* or *$10.00* and any money we receive
over the amount required will go to buying software/hardware to
competition off to our readers. If you can donate that amount there
is the insentive that when we receive your money you will be entered
into a *competition* to *win *Aga Experience 3 (Worth £10) and a
registered
copy of Cheat Zone v1.4.3. Send any donations to :-

 Chris Seward (AIO)
 10 Scafell Close
 Eastham
 Wirral
 Merseyside
 L62 9EU
 ENGLAND

Thankyou again for your great support and help.

Kind Regards!

To ALL people unsubscribing,

    Firstly don't any of you who are trying to unsubscribe read
the little tags one list add? It says to unsubscribe visits
http://www.onelist.com  Stop flooding the list with boring unsubscribe
messages when you could save everyone the trouble by reading
the info.

Kind Regards!

Subject: [just-amiga] Banner adverts anyone?

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Dear List,
     Due to the decline of most of the Amiga magazines like CuAmiga
recently, I am aiming at making AIO one of the best magazines in the
world with a type of 'cult' following like Amiga Report has. AR is good
but it comes out on an irregular basis and has a sort of released
when the editor is ready. AIO sticks to a one month deadline and
we are still requesting your suggestions or contributions.

 The main subject of this letter is regarding the www.aioworld.com
web page, once we have registered this domain I am offering banner
adverts to link to your company plus a small section dedicated to
your company or page. If you are interested find the prices for
a banner advert and dedicated section below.

1 month - £10
6 months - £40 (Save £20 if bought per month)
1 year - £75 (Save £45 if bought per month)

 If you are interested contact me by emailing : *amiga@thefree.net*
or phone (UK) : *07887 664 915*

Kind Regards!

God boy, here is your candy...

;-)

Its a good Package, but so is Studio, too. I use both. Studio has the
advantage of not being a hack but totally systemconform a printer driver.
Good, fast and reliable. Only for high quality color prints with the Photo-Kit
I use Turboprint, because it looks a little better and is faster then.

Thats all fine and good, if you're account is intact at onelist. I've been at 
war with them now for a month. If you're cookies screwed , SO ARE you. you 
can't get in to do diddly, and all onelist does is repeat everything in the 
FAQ's instead of listening to what you're telling them..

I'm doing all I can (droping all my lists best I can) to maybe delete my 
account at onelist and hopefully come in as a NEW account !
Not likely...

Subject: [just-amiga] onelist cookies

From: cbminfo@digital.net

Someone from this list wrote me (I suspect it was the moderator, and I also 

suspect he was using Aweb 3.2 can't get into his account at onelist either...





Well here's the fix if you're interested. I stumbled across it completely by 

accident while attempting to create an internet email account where I could 

call a 2nd home to send email from if needed in the future. Trouble was, can't 

recall if it was yahoo mail or hotmail.com. Pretty much irrelevant, but it came 

back with the error 'trouble getting your end to accept the cookie we use for 

security' Hmmmm.... Damn Cookies and aweb.. Anyways this turned a lightbulb on 

that had been in a brownout the past few weeks. Do some aweb config such as 

'SPOOF as Mozilla 4.0' Go to the Privacy section of network settings and 

toggle 'Browse anonymously' I also turned RFC 2109 off, but I suspect that can 

stay turned on. It is just that much more security. And possibly more than 

onelist can handle. Where it says use cookies, I chose the 'ask before set' 

though Always (Quiet) would have served just as well. I wanted to see what was 

happening while trying to set onelists cookie again..



Anyways things finally took. There was now a onelist cookie where every 

attempt at entering was met with wrong address or you're already registered. 

Now to see if I can't get a 2nd mail account case this happens again.. 

Blasted cookies...



Ain't no one gonna be hacking into anyones onelist account. Cripes most 

cases can't even get in if you know the address and password.

Subject: [just-amiga] Wipeout 2097 on the Amiga

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Some good news all, read this that I received from Digital Images.

--snip--

Talks are still going with Psygnosis with regards to Wipeout 2097. We are
confident that we will get the necessary licencing to port Wipeout 2097
to
the Amiga. Watch this space for the latest info...

--snip--

So expect to see Wipeout 2097 soon on the Amiga, read AIO issue 17 which
is out on the 24th October for an article on who Digital Images are and
there other plans and news.

Kind Regards!

Subject: [just-amiga] ACE Basic compiler

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

For those that were unaware David Benn finally released the source to his 
Amiga Basic compiler. It's available from Aminet. as ace_final.lha.. Rather 
than bugging David about it he included the Sozobon K&R C compiler he used to 
write ACE.
 
He knows it's screwed up. This compiler w/source is also available from 
aminet.

Since David has discontinued support other than a passing interest He 
mentioned he intended to convert it to ANSI C. Currently I have it compiled 
and converted under SAS/C 6.58. 

Rather than duplication of effort, here's mail I rcv'd from David re: ACE 
release and future of the code.

Hi Ken

>Much simpler than lha's on my clone..

Yep, thanks.

>that was messed up. And found this compiler on aminet 1a. But even this was 
>missing something.

I notice from the listing you provided me that the main compiler files for
ZC appear to be extractable. That's good. I only provided that archive so
that people would know exactly which version of ZC I was using for ACE
(although that's documented in ace.doc), so whether it's intact probably
isn't critical. I recall there being something wrong with the original
archive for ZC too. Don't recall the details now.

>I'm currently in the process (as you were) of converting

BTW, for s=ltoa(n) and s=itoa(n) you could use sprintf(s,"%d",n) and
sprintf(s,"%ld",n). For fsize() you could either make use of stat() or
fseek()+ftell().
 
>Oh I found itoa, ltoa, and fsize in the sozobon compiler source code. Just

Goodo.

What was the conflict?

Yes, SAS/C is ANSI. Those prototype warnings arise from the fact that K&R C
permitted no prototypes except to specify function return type (but not
params). To do a proper conversion would require these protos and the
function definition param lists to be converted to ANSI C also.

>you the completed project if you want, or what I've done so far. 

There's not much point sending me the code because I don't have time to
work on it, but thanks for the offer. Since you've started some work on it,
might I suggest you announce this on comp.sys.amiga.programmer so as to
avoid duplicated effort?

Great. I'm really glad someone is picking this up and running with it. Good
for you! I'd be very happy to see ACE developed further.

Right. You might want to mention this on the c.s.a.p newsgroup too. I may
well join the list and monitor things as they progress, and be available to
answer questions, but I really don't want to run this.

Oh, sorry about forgetting that you asked me too. Daniel just hassled me a
lot in recent months, that's all. He wasn't very happy with me last time he
e-mailed. Hopefully he will be now though.

Good luck. Thanks for the note, and I _really_ am interested in the
progress, but I just don't have the time to work on ACE now. Too much other
stuff happening.

See above 'Incorrect number of parameters.' Think yours required no 
parameters and SAS requires a source and destination.

I've been wrangling with that onelist cookie thing and aweb so long trying 
every dirty trick I can think of to get back into my account there. Short 
story I finally did. Haven't been able to even look at ace since last mail. 
But will be moving full steam ahead now that I'm back in there..

No prob bob! Now that I'm back on onelist, I'll go ahead and create a ACE 
mailing list. and you can go ahead and advertise the list on your home page. 
FWIW to subscribe send the people to http://onelist.com. Find Ace. Then 
just follow the yellow brick road and sign up.

So as anyone can see David seems to be all for the future of ACE, he just 
hasn't the time to do it himself.

quake??? well look at the data on the different gfxcards and you will 
see that quake actually needs twice as much as tombraider. (ie. 
tombraider 35 fps - quake 20 fps) SO if they can run tombraider on a pc 
with half the power of quake then surely we should be able to run 
wipeout 2097 on the amiga.... :)

As much as I like the idea, what kind of Amiga are we talking about here?
I have my doubts that even a 040 would cut it. A 060, maybe.

Hmm maybe a 060 minimum if at all, probably PPC me would think.

   Surly, being realistic, only a Fast PPC / Amiga NG? would really
'hack it'. I mean, look at quake; an 060 with a GFX card would be lucky
to do 10fps in full detail 320x200, while a /AGA/ PPC A1200 can do upto
about 20fps, nearly full speed with a gfx card. 

 the PC version needs a P120 at least, so imagine trying to run a game
like that on an 060'50 amiga.

See ya.

   Tombraider may need less power to run, but I think we can safely say
that Wipeout 2097 has more detailed GFX then Quake. Think of all those
transparent Flares and lighting effects.

   I'm sure a PPC amiga should be able to handel it all though ;)

See ya.

Subject: [just-amiga] PC to Amiga transfer

From: Willi Kusche <willik@bellatlantic.net>

Hi!

    Go download "comm/misc/PC2Am308.lha" from Aminet.  With this software you
can access ANY drives on the PC as if they were drives connected to your
Amiga.  All you need is a standard serial cable to connect the serial port of
the PC to the serial port of your Amiga.
    You want to chat?  Please find a more appropriate forum.

From: Howard Macartney <howardm@thenet.co.uk>

Hello,
       Some new programs like contact manager are introducing new MUI
textinput.mcc mpp and textinputscroll.mcc functions. These seem to cause
strange dragging in YAM and other programs. When you install new programs make
sure that you have an old backup of the  MUI directory in case the worst
happens and you need to revert to older versions. 

Kind regards

Well you've come to the right place mate.

IRC is a wonderful way to meet people too...just fire up
AmIRC and try your luck :)

If you think that some channels may be a bit overwhelming to start
with try: 

irc.thenet.co.uk #FCI Port 7000 

We are a good bunch and welcome new users :))

The flares and stuff on WipeOut XL/2097 are more or less post-render
effects, and quite easy to apply (just a matter of scaling). The graphics
detail in 2097 is ok, but there is never really THAT much on screen, and
for speed considerations, you might ommit parts of the scenery...

And there's 3D hardware, the ViRGE and the Permedia2, which would help
very much here...

Actually, I thought the original WipeOut had much better graphics, and
much better course design... XL plays better, though.

Regards, Hans-Joerg.

Can I use this on my PC?? I mean, can I un-lha the file with Winzip or

Where can I find more appropriate forums for chat then?

I would use IRC on my Amiga if it weren't for two small things...

1) I only have an A500

2) It doesn't have a modem!

Well, if the files in the lha files is longer than 8 characters you can't unpack the file with lha (on the pc ofcoz). You should download winpack in that case. Works fine.

 If the games good/exciting/fast enough then you won't have time to 
look at the scenery :)

 Most games include stuff for changing graphic detail, why not 
inclkude one for turning off scenery or at least not texturing it.

Subject: [just-amiga] PC2Amiga

From: Willi Kusche <willik@bellatlantic.net>

Hi!

    The "PC2Am308.lha" archive contains programs for both a PC and an Amiga. 
You have a modem on your PC but not on your Amiga so you can download the
archive onto your PC but then no way to get the Amiga modules over to your
Amiga.  Prime example of why you should always buy an external modem.
    The program that runs on the PC ought to be run from DOS.  It turns your
PC into a server.  On the Amiga side, a handler is installed in your "L:"
library and you add an entry to your mountlist, "PC:" for example.  Then use
the 'MOUNT' command to mount the device "PC:".  Finally, to see the contents
of drive A on the PC, simply enter 'dir PC:A' on the Amiga.  To see the
contents of the hard drive, enter 'dir PC:C'.
    Of course, the simplest solution is to install a file system handler for
MS/DOS on your Amiga so you can read MS/DOS floppies directly via the floppy
drive on your A500.  I use "PC2Amiga" because my PC has a high density floppy
drive but my A3000 does not.

Willi

Yes you can BUT you need to have a copy of the command
line version of Lha and tell Winzip where it is - and DOS copies of
Lha are not easy to find. Good luck!

After this do I need to run the software just from my PC, or does
it have to be from both my Amiga AND my PC? Cause My Amiga doesn't
have a modem (It's only an A500!) and so I can't get the files onto
an Amiga disk very easily!

use the 500 as a door stop and get a nice 2nd hand 1200. You'll be

There are enough well-talented amiga musician around, why wasting money in
investigating in expenisve licenses when you can get it for almost free?

I`m involved in the amiga demo-scene and i`m sure it will be easy to get some
good soundtracks

JU>Yes you can BUT you need to have a copy of the command
JU>line version of Lha and tell Winzip where it is - and DOS copies of
JU>Lha are not easy to find. Good luck!

Can the person who wants a copy email me and I'll give it to you.

Either that or visit http://abacus.net.au/hotcakes/filez.htm and grab it
from there.

MONTHLY IRC MEET WITH AMIGA INC'S FLEECY MOSS


This is to announce the regularly scheduled monthly IRC conference

The topic for this month will be Evie (latest member of the Moss
family), Corba, and other topics of interest to Classic Amiga Users
and Amiga2 supporters, as well as the REAL news from MAE. (Was Joe
Torre pinned by two models in the lobby of the hotel?)


The IRC conference will be held on the following servers:

     irc.snowhill.com
     more.beyondirc.net
     babylon.beyondirc.net
     europe.beyondirc.net
     oz.beyondirc.net

Channel will be:   #Team*AMIGA


We invite all interested parties to come chat with Fleecy Moss in a
moderated session of Q&A.

For those who can not attend, a log will be provided to the Amiga Web
Directory http://www.cucug.org and the Team AMIGA Web pages
http://web.wt.net/~gpeake/

Team AMIGA welcomes IRC stalwarts as well as people new to IRC. IRCOPs
will be available to assist those who need help prior to the
conference.




Sincerely,

Gary Peake

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga Survivor gets new look! (& more)

From: Robert Iveson <thedomain@enterprise.net>

Hello Amiga fanatics!

Well, Amiga Survivor is proving more of a success than any of us could
imagine. Our print-run increases every month and new subscribers are added to
our database daily. Even after a mere three issues!
And now everyone around the world can have a taste of it.
Amiga Survivor has recently had a complete overhaul, both the magazine, and
it's official homepage
(http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html). Go see for
yourself the new-look covers, new logos, and get information about
distributors and contents of the magazine.
Since the new look and new promotions, many stores around the planet are now
stocking issues, in the US, Canada, The UK and the rest of Europe. Have a look
at the website to see if there's a store near you! Or you can order online and
have each issue delivered to your door!

At one point in it's life, Amiga Survivor was just a games magazine, but due
to it's popularity, it has grown to covering more 'serious' items, with the
help of some ex-CU Amiga staff members. And in the coming months, AS is set to
gain more pages, and the possibility of swelling to an A4 format!

Amiga Survivor has also recently gained the rights to distribute the
incredibly popular U.S publicaton, Amiga Informer in the UK! Be one of the
first European residents to own this fine magazine by ordering it from the
Amiga Survivor website.
(http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html)

Of course, Amiga Survivor could always benefit from being even more popular,
so if you're an Amiga stockist anywhere in the world, then you could be one of
the many distributors to stock this new, popular publication.
Please note that Amiga Survivor is available via mail-order only, and not on
news-stands!

Amiga Survivor is the ONLY place to read the Work-In-Progress of Gilbert
Goodmate and the Mushroom of Phungoria (the excellent Monkey Island 3 / Disney
inspired adventure game) courtesy of Prelusion and Crystal Software.
Read the latest games reviews, previews, special features, regular articles,
and the latest Amiga news, all sandwiched between a glorious full colour
cover!

If you require any further information, then visit the website, or e-mail the
editor, Robert Iveson at: robert@survivor.enterprise-plc.com

You can subscribe online for a bulk amount of issues, or merely just the one
to give it a try. You never know, it might be just what you're looking for in
a magazine.....

Oh. To get the files accross you will need a version of CrossDos or
something similar - enabling you to read Double Density floppy disks
from a PC on your Amiga. Unfortunatly only newer versions of Workbench
have it (2.1 or better) but there is a program on AMinet which can do
something similar but I don't know the name.

I got the lha from the Aminet. But would it be possible for someone to
send me the equivalent Amiga version on a disk?

And does this software run on an A500? Cause that's what I'm using

AFAIK Lha evaluation version 1.38 is equivalent. You can find it at:
http://ftp.wustl.edu/~aminet/dirs/aminet/util/arc/LhA_e138.run

Again AFAIK it works :-)

The software's not the problem, it's my Amiga, it's NOT connected to
the net, but my PC is, so I need to SOMEHOW get the files onto an
Amiga disk to be able to use them.

BTW, has anyone found a version of LHA for Win'95 that'll do long
filenames?

Hey, the 500 has kickass games! i.e. Dune 2, Turrican 2, Hired Guns etc.

BTW, 1200's aren't easy to come by around here.

Can Workbench 2.* be run off a 500? Or do u need a higher Kickstart?

Hello,
I'm also looking for a way for 16bit sampling, so I have some questions :
Does 16bit sampler exists for the parallel port or only for zorro II audio
cards ?
What is the best 16 bit sampler ? What do you all use as sampler ?
Thanks for your responses ...

Huh? Firstly, I don't have AmigaBASIC anyway, it didn't come with my
Amiga. And I can get a null modem cable, but will that routine do the
job?

Forgive my stupidity, but the Amiga's way of thinking is confusing me.
Hasn't someone wrote a way to put Amiga disks in a PC drive and make
them work?

Easy; fire up AmigaBASIC, write a small program like this:

open "filename" for output as 1
input a
while a<>-1
input a
print#1,chr$(a);
wend
close

And then use a hex editor on the pc.. =)

But seriously, how do you expect to get the files transferred without even a
null-modem?

Yes, did exist anyway. The Clarity16 does that but I don't know if it's
available anymore. Check http://www.hisoft.co.uk to make sure. Otherwise,
try to find one secondhand.

>or only for zorro II audio cards ?

That's the better option if you have a Zorroslot-equipped machine. Some
of the audio-cards are not that expensive.

>What is the best 16 bit sampler ? What do you all use as sampler ?

I don't know which one is best but I am very pleased with the Prelude
soundcard. Poor old Paula doesn't have a chance in comparison, neither
in playing or sampling.

Well, heh, that routine involves copying the file by hand by looking at a hex
editor on the pc. =) But if you have a null modem cable you should of course
use it. Try doing a "copy SER: to filename", and then something similar on
the pc, but copying from a file to the serial port.

Anyway (in reply to some earlier message), I use some 8 bit thingy by
Trilogic. You plug it into the parallel port, and attach a mono out line from
the stereo. Works ok, but I'd really like to have 16 bits instead.

She's needed there too. Otherwise nothing would get sampled.

I have one in stereo but it cheats. Don't know if it's by Trilogic though
but it works fine with Audiomaster. If anyone wants it, it's yours.

There are only 8 data bits available on the parallel port.
Doing a 16 bit transfer via the parallel port would require sending
2 bytes per sample, this alone is not a major problem,
but I don't know of any software that supports this.

ie:  AudioMaster,Audio Engineer......

I presume that someone has made a card to do it via the zorro slot,
it would make life a bit easier....

Huh?

I just dunno why everyone is bothered about copying filez over by floppy.
It is such a unreliable method! I prefer to use TwinExpress. Available on
aminet. A simple three wire null modem cable gives me acceptable results.
And the beauty is Twin is pretty small in size!! Just @ 56K or so!!!! And
dead easy to use too.

I cant believe no one else thought of this earlier or do you chaps have a
faster method????

 Yeah, but the problem is that he is trying to get PC2Amiga from one 
machine to the other. The same would happen using TwinExpress, he 
needs to copy via floppy to get the executables on the correct 
machine before he can use serial/parallel.

 Use WinUAE then you don't have to transfer files at all ;)

I shall tell you my main reason for wanting to do this. You see, I
can download games and stuff from the net from emulator sites,
convert it back to it's original filenames and then put them
into my Amiga.

The thing is, my Amiga DOESN'T have a modem and I can't put
the disks into my PC. So I have a problem!

Plus mine is an A500, I live in the dark ages when games were GOOD!

That server thing that someone talked about? Is it possible to
link my PC to my Amiga but make my PC think the Amiga's floppy
drive is an external drive or something??

My friend used to have a program on his A500+ which loaded through
Workbench and allowed him to use PC floppies. Does anyone have this?
It came on a coverdisk.

My PC's too slow to run WinUAE, plus why use an emulator when I can
play on the real thing?

 Well for a start, the WinUAE Amiga would be better than your A500 
(apart from not having an Amiga floopy drive). You can get a 
68020/882 with 70+Mb ram, as much storage space as your PC has and 
with v0.7.5 you can get the GFX card version. You only need to pay 
for the shareware fees for WinUAE and the Picasso system (for the 
uaegfx drivers). You'd also be able to use all the rom images you 
had, selecting a different one at boot-up to use liek a ROM switcher, 
and if you use the original chipset (although you need a damned fast 
PC to do that) you'd be back to the same graphics chipset that you 
have.

 How many people on this list use WinUAE anyway? I only use it at 
uni, less now since I got my 060...

   Doesn't some version of Techno Sound have 16bit recording and 14bit
playback?

Subject: [just-amiga] TA's UnOfficial OS3.5 FAQ!

From: "Gary Peake" <gpeake@wt.net>



Question:

Why these high system requirements for the OS3.5 Upgrade? Up to now
AOS was running on ALL Amigas!!



The "honest" answer: To encourage customers to upgrade their
hardware and thus provide input and sales activity for the market.



The "tricky" answer: The new OS will deliver more power and
functionality, but it cannot do this unless the hardware platform
supports it to do this.



The "some people might find the following statement offensive"
answer: listen Sunshine, we've seen the likes of you before. Always
whining about how slow your 7 MHz A500 is, how difficult it is to
upgrade that crummy machine and then expecting Amiga Inc. to work
miracles, possibly even by releasing any OS update for free. If you
want a miracle, go join a church. And not the Church of the
Amiga!



The "historical" answer: When the last AmigaOS update was released,
Windows 95 and the Pentium processor were still two years from
delivery. Today the standard PC configuration is a 64 MByte, 233
Pentium
II machine with Windows 98. Do you really believe that requiring an
Amiga system that was considered "high performance" in 1988 is asking
too much of you?



The "embarrassing" answer: Amiga Inc. wants to make sure that all
Amigas running OS 3.5 are at least as fast as UAE, running on a
233 Pentium II.



The "that's what Heinlein would have said" answer: Think of it as
evolution in action.



The "you gotta be kidding" answer: Actually, Amiga Inc. had *you* in
mind
when they pictured the kind of customer they don't want to buying OS
3.5.



The "obvious" answer: Are you stupid or what?



The "that's what Darwin would have said" answer: Only the fittest
Amiga Classic computers will survive.



The "buzz off" answer: Why don't you go upgrade your PC?

hmmm, the proggy that ur friend used was called CrossDos. Now u do have a

it in Amiga formatted disks. So .. ? Thinking cap on ...

Nope. No way mate. your best bet would be to ask someone on this list who
lives reasonably close to you to mail u a floppy (bootable) with Twin
(amiga version, the pc version u can download) and dms etc. I am sure that
someone here would do it for you. I will if no one else bothers but I live
in India ad it might be a while before it reaches ya!! Mebbe a coupla
weeks. Lemme know.

Stuart,
    What O.S. are you running?? I've got two A500's with GVP A530's, one
running 1.3/3.1, and the other 1.3/2.1. Perhaps you should at LEAST
upgrade to O.S. 2.1, as this includes CrossDos (as does O.S. 3.1).
    Come on dude, get with the program! Sure, I'm only running A500's,
but with a 40Mhz 68030/68882 and O.S. 3.1, there is little that I can't
run (barring AGA only stuff).

Bob Mason

Buff A500 user (and damned Proud of my Amiga!)

I shall tell you my main reason for wanting to do this. You see, I
can download games and stuff from the net from emulator sites,
convert it back to it's original filenames and then put them
into my Amiga.

The thing is, my Amiga DOESN'T have a modem and I can't put
the disks into my PC. So I have a problem!

Plus mine is an A500, I live in the dark ages when games were GOOD!

That server thing that someone talked about? Is it possible to
link my PC to my Amiga but make my PC think the Amiga's floppy
drive is an external drive or something??

My friend used to have a program on his A500+ which loaded through
Workbench and allowed him to use PC floppies. Does anyone have this?
It came on a coverdisk.

You will need:

NULL modem cable      (From your previous mails I found out that you have)

Terminal program for PC (Shouldn't be a big problem)

Terminal program for your Amy (Try to find out terminus NComm or JrComm
                               some where and your problem is solved)

So then you can make link from PC to Amy and just upload the stuff from PC
terminal proggy and voila the file is transferred to your Amy. ;) sounds
               easy and it should be, but you never know about those PCs.

If you didn't understand then you can mail me directly and I can try to
give a more specific explanation.

PS. after you have transfered the archive to your Amy you can unpack it and
send the PC version back by uploaning it (pack it with zip if you can).

PS. PS. important rules while making null terminal connection!!

        make sure both terminals use same speed (for example 19200 bps)
        if cable is only 3wire cable use lower speed because the lack of
          error and flow control checking.
        make sure both proggys use same file transfering protocol! (for
          example Zmodem 32bit CRC with 1024 byte packet size. This One is
          quite appropriate setting in your case)
        If you get bad progs after sending them through null link just pack
          those before sending, and it should be okey!
        Use Zip as packing because it's PC's most commonly used packing
          proggy, and thus may even work. ;)

A "dog" ? We do have a reindeer but no dogs AFAIK

If you mean a bot then it's quite possible that the owner was
there but not at the keyboard when you joined.

>Surely there must  be an Amiga Channel where adults can go to. 

Try thenet again...I should be there Tonight, Sat and Sun from (approx)
9pm 'til about 11 or so. I'll be [Baldrick] or something close to it anyway :)

Subject: [just-amiga] Have I missed something ?

From: Alan Paynter <a.paynter@zoo.co.uk>

Hi Chris, 3 Saturdays ago I met you and your dog (Shell was her name ? ;-)
at irc.stealth.net. Couldnt make it the following Sat, but last week I
only found your sleeping puppy. Erm, what have I missed, Chris?
...............
I also tried irc.thenet.co.uk (as suggested recently by someone on this
list),a couple of times. Only found a "dog" there too. Surely there must
 be an Amiga Channel where adults can go to. The only populated one I know has
been taken over by spotty bored kids. Can anyone help?

I would not go so far as to call a '020 "bloated". I think it's really
time to push the envelope a little bit. I would have liked it to be a 040
or 060, with MMU support. I don't see why there should still be support
for those guys that thought that Doom was so slow on their machines
because of lazy programmers.

Whoever still has an 68000 *only* is not a very likely customer for the
new machines. The 68000 went out of style ages ago, as did a 020 and 030. 

Personally, I wish they had based the new design on a bit higher spec.

Personally, I am an avid Amiga user. I have two 68030/68882 based
machines sitting in front of me. One has 34 megs, the other has 18 megs.
I can't afford to upgrade either of them. I *might* be able to afford an
OS upgrade for them, though.

You may not recognize my name, I don't know. If you explore AmiNET under
docs/mags you'll find a series of archives (FLAK????.lha). All ofthose
were posted by me when I was editor of the Gateway Amiga Club, Inc.
newsletter, the *GAC FLAK*. Further, if you explore pix/art you'll find
a series of JPEGs uploaded by me. Each are graphics created on my out of
date 68030/68882 based amigas.

I'm *very* glad that the specs allow for the processor I use, and that I
don't need to buy a new accellerator (probably meaning new RAM also)
just to upgrade the OS.

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: TA's UnOfficial OS3.5 FAQ!

From: "ian urie" <ianurie@jwu.u-net.com>

On 14-Oct-98 21:15:26, Gary Peake said about [just-amiga] TA's UnOfficial
OS3.5 FAQ!:

The "Nit Picking" answer:

> The "that's what Heinlein would have said" answer: Think of it as
> evolution in action.

Actually it was Larry Niven in "Oath Of Fealty" although I'll bet
Heinlein wished he had said it.

As for the specs for 3.5.....
I think most people still using their Amigas will have at least 4meg,
an '060 is a different matter.I also believe the point he was trying
to get across was that Amigas functioned previously on very meagre
system resources as opposed to the bloated spec list for comparable
PC applications.....
Hopefully the "New" amigas will have the necessary clout for the next
generation but lets not forget that 3.5 is simply to improve what we
already have.
Since the advent of the New machine is apprx. 6 months later than 3.5,
will anyone actually buy upgrades for a machine which won't be actively
supported by the parent company? And given the fact that,hopefully,everyone
will rush out and buy the new machine,is it worth their while?
2p worth finished...... back to lurking.

The Classic lifespan is estimated to be 18-36 months. That is twice
the lifetime of most computer upgrades sold, so, yes, people will rush
out to buy it.

    I must dissagree with you.
    We are NOT all made of money. Some of us sill have 030's and can't

Subject: [just-amiga] RealAmiga Player v0.46 RELEASED!

From: "Nicklas 'Alcom' Jönsson" <nicklas97@hotmail.com>

Hi everyone!

Just wanted to let you all know that i just released v0.46 of my 
RealAmiga Player. 

What it is??

well it is a RealAudio player that can play both 14.4 and 28.8 streams 
(using radecode & radecode2). It is at the moment only CLI-based but i 
am working on a gui.

Take a look at: www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/ellington/783/

And please let me know if you find any bugs/problems!

Have fun!

Where's the black writing on the homepage?? A dark background pattern
and yellow text is what I get.

Nice little program, only one problem which isn't your fault. Most of the
RA files have higher compression than 28.8k nowadays.=20

This is a rather typical output from the RA-files I have around here:

#Harryhomers is a friendly channel populated by a broad age range
(about 16 to  60+). It's primarily for conversation about anything and
everything, with a sister channel called #HarryTech for the heavy
techie stuff to be dealt with. Any computer platform is welcome,
though the majority of poeple on channel are Amiga users, and in
fact derive from the old #Netconnect on Dalnet. The channels can be
found on Babylon.BeyondIRC.Net on ports 6660 to 6670.

Subject: [just-amiga] Disney Animation Studio

From: Dale Hemenway <dalemation@enterprise.net>

Hi there,

Does anyone out there have for sale, or know where I can get, 'Disney Animation
Studio' ?
I know it's a rather dated program now but I just want it for my collection
of Amiga animation programs.

Bye,

Dale Hemenway.

Subject: [just-amiga] Come on, support us guys and gals!

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

All,
 There are 146 of you on this list and the web page I am trying to
buy costs 188 UKP/US$380 - if just 19 of you sent 10 UKP/US$20 then I 
could buy the web page instantly. This would give the JA mailing list a
web page also at www.aio.co.uk/ja/ 

I have only requested 5 UKP/US$10 so it would only need 38 out
of the 146 to contribute and this list and AIO could go alot better.

I am not pocketing any of the money and I don't make any money
from AIO or Just-Amiga, i run them both as a hobby and to support
the Amiga. If you donate you also have the chance of winning 61 UKP/
US$130 worth of Amiga programs so I am still doing something for
you.

I am serious about JUST-AMiGA and also serious about AIO so for
me running these two things help me extend them and make them the
best. 

If you can help send money/uk cheque to :-

Chris Seward
10 Scafell Close
Eastham
Wirral
Merseyside
L62 9EU
ENGLAND

If you live in the UK and are paying by cheque please make 
it payable to *'C.Brown'*

Please email me if you have any questions or problems at

amiga@thefree.net

Kind Regards!

AHI is installed, but I really have no idea what it's for anyway,
it's preferences are set to "Paula Hi Fi, 8 Bit Stereo."

Mode Settings  "Music Unit"   (Whatever a 'Music Unit' is ??)
Frequency 22050Hz
Volume 0.0dB
Monitor.
Input Slider = Quarter way up ( Parallel Port Sampler )
I don't have a sampler on the parallel port ( ??? is that a problem) 

Device AUDIO:  is mounted....   (It's in the devs/dosdrivers drawer)
when I type "Mount AUDIO:"   it says that it is already mounted...

Any other suggestions......

Subject: [just-amiga] Cinema 4D and Siamese V2.5

From: DAVID HAIGH <davehaigh@usa.net>

Has anyone on this list managed to get Cinema 4D V4 (the same version that
was on the CU-Amiga cover CD last month) working over an RTG Siamese screen.
I have managed to get renders etc to work but cannot move any points on
primitives, which basically means I cannot create any new objects. I also
cannot move my workspace over RTG to change the angle that I am viewing the
object. I assume it is a configuration problem as I can use Cinema 4D
properly if I do not retarg my screen and run it on a Hi-res lace display.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Dave

I don't remember where I got it from, it's over a year ago I downloaded it.
But I get the same result no matter which one of the ra-files I have that's
compressed in more than 28.8k. Slight differences though. Some of them gets
the output right and others clears the shell-window and others do like the
above. 

I've got a couple smaller ones here that exhibits more or less the same symptom
as the one above. I could mail them to you so you can check for yourself. Mail
me privately if you're interested.

BTW, anyone know of a site where I could download a ra-file that's known to
be compressed with 28.8k? The ones I have here that this player can play is
all of the 14.4k variety and I'd like to hear how a 28.8k one sounds like.
14.4k ones sound awful (:

Set it to another value. That's the most cpu-demanding audiomode
AHI has to offer. Paula: Fast 8bit stereo++ would be more
appropiate.

>Mode Settings  "Music Unit"   (Whatever a 'Music Unit' is ??)

That's a low-level device AHI uses. Also a default mode and
what AUDIO: uses as it's output.

No.

Try this:

Copy thisfile.8svx AUDIO:

Do you get any sound at all? It will sound like hell doing it that
way but you should hear something. If you don't, check that you have
ahi.device in devs: and ahi-handler in l:

Er, well, I and a few others, have made films using Amigas. I think
you may remember my name from the article AF did on the
making of our film 'All Talk' for Central. I really wanted to promote
the Amiga with this film. I did a large AmigaGuide, with pics, on
the making of All Talk but don't know quite what to do with it!

Early this year I was asked to work on a  puppet animation
series at a new studio in Altrincham so have not used the Amiga
as much as I would have liked recently. However, I am desperately trying
to finish an all Amiga film I have been doing with a school. My time is limited
now but it should be completed soooooon.!!!

Regards

Dale.

. 
.. And please let me know if you find any bugs/problems!
.

Got the player, couldn't get it to work on any of the files I was able to save
to disk.  (It took forever to find any that allowed me to save, most wanted to
play in real time / stream mode)  I was able to find some "answering machine
messages" that had files in both .wav and .rm but couldn't get the .rm's to
work.  (The .wav files worked fine using multiview.)

AHI works fine using the copy command, audio: is mounted and
I have version 47.3 of ixemul.library.  But after issuing the
command with the "play" option included, the program echoed it's Title,
Author, &
Copyright statement (blank for the files I was doing),then a "Playing file..."
comment; then paused and
returned the command line prompt.


The headers in the .rm files all started out with .RMF and had
"audio/x-pn-realaudio" a few bytes down when viewed in multiview using
binary.datatypes.

Any suggestions??  This would be GREAT! if it worked, especially if I could
have it run through Voyager on streaming audio.

you can save all those files that says pnm: in the beginning and
then renaming them. like this:

original format:
pnm:testsound.com/test/sound.ra
renamed as:
<a href=http:testsound.com/test/sound.ra>sound</a>
and now you have a link that you can download!

i'm sorry this is my fault. The realmovie player isn't finished yet!

i know , i am working on this one too!

at the moment no, but i am working on it! remember you will probably
need a 040 to do realtime decoding. I will release a new version 
today/tomorrow that use a SLOW switch, so that everyone should be
able to listen to 28.8 realAUDIO files atleast. On my 030 it decodes 
14.4 files in realtime....

see you!

Subject: [just-amiga] Confusion... (&Doom)

From: Ragnar Fyri <ragnar.fyri@daf.no>

I got a bit confused the other day when some people on a different mailing
list started discussing Doom and similar games. Thought for a moment YAM had
started getting things mixed up, but then i checked the archive site and
found the thread there too. So I wrote the following response and got an
unexpected answer... (My response first [with >>s] of course)

>>Now *that* was confusing! I'm on an Amiga mailing list as well, and they're

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: RealAmiga Player v0.46 RELEASED!

From: Ragnar Fyri <ragnar.fyri@daf.no>

I tried downloading the program too and got problems similar to the ones
described by others, so I decided to wait and see what came out of it, but
it looks like everyone has gone silent again. Yes, I do have AHI (and it
works with DigiBooster at least) and I have tried changing the settings as
described. Still getting error messages when trying to play a file. Now
what?

BTW, I've also had some problems with downloading RA files from the web.
The usual procedure only gives me a small file called something.ra which
turns out to contain nothing but the URL to the file something.ram. If I
change the file name before starting to download I do get the .ram file
which is considerably longer and which RAP does recognize but still refuses
to play...

While we're on the subject of sound, turns out I have a little problem to
air anyway, it's just so old I hardly think about it any more.
One of the first things I got for my (first) Amiga was a sampler. Couldn't
get it to work, so I shelved it, figuring I had done something wrong and
busted it. More recently I got another one - and couldn't get that one to
work either! Further testing showed that neither of my two samplers works
with either of my (by now) three Amigas... Any bright ideas? [I could return
the new sampler to the dealer but they charge a pretty stiff fee for testing
devices that turn out to be okay...]

Rm is usually a sign of it using the new improved RealAudio technologies,
i.e. those not supported by this player yet. More often than not,
they include video as well.

All the ones I have start with .ra in the header.

rename it to:

and include it in a http page....And voila you got a link you can

Subject: [just-amiga] mkdir at web page

From: Ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

I know I created a directory at my web page ages ago, but I've had a HD crash 
long since I 1st set up my web page.

And now I can't recall which program I used to create the directory.

I have amiftp on the desktop, and use it regularly to upload to my site, but 
theres no access that I can see to the rexx port. 

By that I mean in the amiftp docs it does say you can use the 
FTPCOMMAND COMMAND amiftp
via the rexx port amiftp to send commands. But I don't show any option on the 
pulldowns, configs or anywhere on how to send the command to the port.

Or is there a different program I can use to do this with ? GEEZ 1 command 
and may be needing an entire program just to do it... Aggghh.

See thats the problem I have amiftp in use. But luckily you said amftp. 
Picked that up from aminet. Thats a real good program. But thing that 
confuses me, I've never used (that I can recall) amftp before. But I have a 
directory at my web site that I created. So there must be another program, 
maybe an arexx script or something that accesses amiftp's rexx port ?

Oh well thanks the nudge at least I found a program that could make my 
directory..

I also wondered about that, although it was longer ago
for me that the messages from TA suddenly stopped coming.
But the TA-list was too chatty anyway so I didn't care and
joined this list instead :)

Just use TransADF. You can get it from Aminet.
The author also has an homepage from which you can download the
newest version of TransADF:  http://www.lis.net.au/~kjots

ADZ files are ADF files compressed with ZLIB.
TransADF supports normal ADF files and ones compressed
with ZLib and GZip.

The postmaster there moved a couple of thousand km away, and then there
was a software problem which he couldn't fix remotely. It won't be back
up until he has moved the machine to be nearer to where he now lives.

It is not just the teamamiga list that is affected, but also all the
ICOA lists and website too :(

 Thought I'd just send this here as well, there must be some 
programmers (or anybody that knows the answer) on the list.

 Does anybody know the format of the .otag files for non-bitmapped 
fonts (its different from the .font structure). I know they contain 
the name of the font and the location of the original outline file, 
but I want to know the structure, so I don't go reading from anywhere.

 And are all .otag files the same for different font types, i.e. 
truetype, postscript and compugraphic. They look the same, but 
nothings ever that easy.

'Twas the night before 21-Oct-98, and all through the net,
 not a creature was stirring, except for Nicklas, who whispered ominously:

Well at least it gives a more informative error message when trying to play
the file I'm using for experimenting. It says this compression (dnet it
seems) is not supported yet. Guess I'll have to find another one (for now)
then... Or is dnet support next on the to-do list? <g>

We'll be right back after these messages.

'Twas the night before 21-Oct-98, and all through the net,
 not a creature was stirring, except for Tim, who whispered ominously:

>> I never could figure out where the  www.thule.no   was at ??
>>
>> I'll guess & say   NOrway  ???

>Yes, .no is Norway, but just where in Norway it is/was based I don't know.

I did a bit of searching and found the email address of someone who's got a
site there. Sent him a note and just got the answer. The server is on the
move to Trondheim. Didn't say anything about where is used to be though...

We'll be right back after these messages.

A good place to look for info is the Bullet.library tuturial on the
Developer Disks
(or the CD). I am currently 600km away from my Amiga ( stupid NT machine who

tries to be clever in front me...) so that's all I know for now.
