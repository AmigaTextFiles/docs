Try going to http://www.onelist.com where you can log in, and then
unsubscribe.

Or maybe sending a mail to just-amiga-unsubscribe@onelist.com might work?

As Neil said its to do with the buffer, what will display
on one persons computer will not display on anothers.
If they have lower specs then its less likely to work.

The archives via email, aminet and the website are all
exactly the same so downloading one and then another
won't really make any difference :)

One way to overcome it is open it on your workbench
screen, ie, choose "no" on the requester when loading.

If this still doesn't work then lower your workbench
colours and choose "no" when loading.

This is only a problem on big articles, unfortunately.
(Not that we want the problem on all articles ;)...
you know what i mean :P )

Toodle Pip!

Subject: [just-amiga] Cybervision 64/3d 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, 

Does anyone out there own a Z4 busboard for their A1200, and know
the jumper settings for it? 

The main reason being, i've just plugged a Cybervision64/3d (mark 2)
into the Z4 bus, and i'm having a nightmare getting it to work
properly. I dont know whether its a hard or software problem. I
wasnt given a manual with the z4, i'll have to wait till eyetech
decide to get one to me...

When i draw a dragbox on the workbench screen (for selecting icons), 
it leaves trails all over the place, which wont go away unless i move
 a window on top of them and move it away again. On top of that i'm 
getting LOTS of random pixel trash all over the screen, mainly when i 
swap between screens, or move windows around. It doesnt matter which mode
i use, and i've tried other slots on the busboard, disabling all
hacks etc etc. Anyone ever heard of anything like this before? 

The whole thing seems to be going really slow too, when i resize
windows, it takes about 4 seconds to redraw the background (or
windows behind the current one), and thats only on 800x600x8 :( Is
it supposed to be this slow?  Enabling the 'fast z2 mode' doesnt
seem to do anything at all..

Sorry for so many questions in the one email.. this is making me
just a tad angry, because i've spent so much on it, and i'd like a
second opinion before i spend another fortune sending it all back..

Cheers

David

It did. They were 2 different sizes.

Yes, this worked. I'm curious how much chip ram it does need if run
with the "YES" button, and why some documents much larger show OK.

Regards... Tony

What software?  Ensure you have the latest drivers and know all the issues
with them.

If you're using CybergraphX, it might be worth trying out Picasso96.  P96 is

It shouldn't be like that at all.  It should be next to instant.  First, check
your software, and if that fails get the hardware checked out.

That'll only affect games really.  General use doesn't move lots of data to

Subject: [just-amiga] High Octane shareware game? 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi,

Does anyone have an old shareware/P.D. game called
High Octane by a man named Paul Overy.

It was an overhead racing game. I bought it from
17 Bit but don't have the disks anymore and am unsure
if it was uploaded to Aminet or even anywhere on
the internet because it was back in the good old
days of buying hundreds of PD disks via post :)

If anyone has this game on disk or knows where it
can be downloaded from it'd be most thankful!

Toodle Pip!

Greetings All...

Does anyone know the latest email address for "MJSoft" the authors of
a neat little print formating util (Columns v2.6) by Martin Mares and
Tomas  Zikmund  - or even an up email address for either of the above
gents?

I sent an email to this address listed in the dox...

            mjsoft@k332.feld.cvut.cz

but it was returned as "unable to find this email address".

I  realise  they  may have given up supporting the Amiga, but I can't
help thinking I've seen the name "MJSoft" on stuff recently.

I hope someone can help.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Hello David.
I've got a Z4 with a very thin manual that doesn't say much.

Jumpers:
J0  Reset (Connection for reset switch)
J1  Z2-adjust  Open: Regular timing on all Z2 slots. Closed: Special timing
on slot 5
J2  AutoCfg M  Open: Regular mode for Autoconfig detection counter. Closed:
Special mode (not needed for Apollo, Blizzard)
J3 AutoCfg 0  Closed for all Apollo and old Blizz 1230
J4 AutoCfg 1  Open
(J2-J4 is only (?) for different accelerator boards. All open for newer
ones.)
J5  Open: Regular timing on all Z2 slots. Closed: Double speed on lot 1 & 2.
WARNING: It only works with specially modified cards.

Slots and graphics cards:
"Z1 is aligned with the video slots (V1 & V2) for use with graphics cards."
and "VE connection for optional Video Slot Enabler"

Well, that's about all there is...
Good luck

	Magnus

->=20

<SNIP>

-> Well, that's about all there is...
-> Good luck

Thanx a lot for the info.. i had a fiddle around with it today,
but no luck at all. At least now i know its nothing to do with the
setup. Now i can start annoying someone to send me a replacement
card >:)

Cheers

David

Hi 

-> If you're using CybergraphX, it might be worth trying out
-> Picasso96. P96 is certainly better than CGX3, maybe not 4
-> though.

I've tried CGX3, CGX4, and P96, all of them suffer the same
problems unfortunatley. I know its not my workbench either, i've
tried a self contained floppy with only the neccesary libs and
Cgfx4 installed, same probs :(

-> It shouldn't be like that at all. It should be next to instant.
-> First, check your software, and if that fails get the hardware
-> checked out.
 
The response from Eyetech has been 'huh?'. I've sent them
a letter and phoned them, hopefully i'll get a reply soon, but i somehow 
doubt any of the HW is faulty. An incompatibility maybe.. main
reason for this posting, to see if anyone else has had the same
problem.

The general performance seems to be reasonable, but when filling
large areas of detail on the screen, it seems to slow down to a
crawl. Closing a window takes ages, as it has to redraw the
workbench pattern. Flicking windows back and forwards is almost as
slow, it even feels slower than AGA in this area. Could this be
software?

->> Enabling the 'fast z2 mode' doesnt seem to do anything
->> at all..
-> 
-> That'll only affect games really. General use doesn't move lots
-> of data to the card..

Doom and heretic are actually slower on the gfx card than they
were under AGA, which is leaving me really disappointed. Quake is
terrible, i feel like i'm running it under 030/50 compared to my
060/50, and thats with doublebuffering turned off.  If anyone else
is using a cv643d in a z2 slot, it would be helpful to hear what
sort of results you get, since i dont know if this is what I
should be expecting or not.

Later

David

Hi Alan,

could you please send such big files directly (private) to the one who
want it (and not to the list). It`s not funny to download hundrets of
kbyte that are not wanted :-(

BTW: You can download the final version 2.0 of YAM from the authors page
;-)

I know this can be really really annoying and i'm
sure Alan sent it to the list purely by mistake.

I know I would be just as angry but lets not now
flood the list with an email from each person
saying that they are annoyed because really thats
just as annoying receiving lots of the same type
of emails saying basically the same thing.

I guess it teaches everyone to check who they are
posting it to :)

Have fun!

I while ago I was on Yahoo.com looking around and i
came across a place in the yahoo site that listed
hundreds of these domains and the prices for
registering them, have a look around the yahoo site
see if you can see the link or maybe type in something
like "registering" or "domain names" it had many top
level addresses to be registered with prices etc.

Plus I almost thought you where the MUI guy for a
minute ;)

Stefan Schulz (You)

Stefan Stuntz (MUI)

Very confusing ;)

With all this talk about the size of the attachment, why don't people
(especially ones using YAM) set the size limit for e-mail so that it will
display large e-mails with the option of downloading or deleting directly on
the server without downloading.

What about those who download mail at night, unattended?  Hmm.. anyway, at
least it was accidental - there are certain people in the world who just
love to post binaries into newsgroups and the like.

I actually had this option, but I rather stupidly accepted the download
before I knew what I was doing. I wish it was possible to read the email
part without downloading the attachment. Still, that's a limitation of
email.

Hello, ppl

    I am on a holly war to find a CD player ;) The ones I've downloaded
aren't 'perfect' :) So I want to ask other ppls oppinion :) The perfect
player should be:

a) non-MUI;
b) support song names, group names, (optional) www.cddb.com support :)
c) must have time slider
d) should show time, remaining, etc ...

a) is optional too (I've nothing against MUI), but gui's design should be
'acceptable' :) and not bloated ;)

So can any1 help me ?

 Kind regards, Vytas

should  I  use  the  standard  Workbench  format tool and then do the
partitioning, etc. with HDToolBox?

Every  Amiga  mag  I've  read has consistantly warned that IDE drives
must  NOT be Low-level formatted, yet the manual tells you to do this
when fitting a new(er) drive. What is correct?

A  mate(?) states I have to Low-level format first - then do a normal
WorkBench format - then use HDToolbox to setup my partitions, etc.

Will  this (presently) PC formatted HD be recognised by Workbench, or
is  this  the reason for the Low-level format with HDToolbox before I
do my partitioning, etc.?  

CrossDOS - if I start this first will the PC HD be seen by Workbench,
and can I then use the WB format command to AmigaDOS format it?

What it all boils to is this...

Would  my best option be to take my Amiga to an Amiga technician, and
get  him to back up all my software from my 4 partitions, fit, format
and partition the hdrive(s), and copy all my software back to the new
setup??

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Greetings Amigans...

I have some questions for you clever Amigans out there.

On storage devices
------------------
I just read an ad for the Imation Super Disk Drive for the PC.

 120Mb 2x parallel port drive - reads 720k, 1.44Mb and 120Mb disks.

This, and many other storage devices are constantly advertised in the
various PC magazines.

With  the amazingly low prices of of these devices, I wonder why some
enterprising  Amiga programmers have not written software/drivers for
their use on our machine of choice.

Does anyone know if they exist, and if so, where they can be found?

A  lot  of these devices are much cheaper than ZIP/JAZ/ORB drives and
would  be  an ideal solution to those of us out here who can't afford
these  latest, (and limited) whizbang storage options. I mean to say,
nearly  $AUS300  for  a ZIPdrive, seems a bit pricey, especially when
their  ads  proclaim  a  ZIP is sold every 5 seconds, (and lots of us
don't have a SCSI option).

I've  D/L'd a software driver for the parallel ZIPdrive, but the docs
warn that there are many problems with this solution.

On modems
---------
I use an ancient Interlink Fastbit Model IIbis 14.4 modem.

A  friend has a 56k v90 he doesn't need, and he's offered it to me at
a  price  that is a steal, but he said I'll have to find my own Amiga
driver for it.

OK,  I'll  bite,  what  driver?  I don't need a driver for my present
Interlink.  Have things changed since I got my modem? Do I now need a
driver  to  connect  a  modern modem to the Amiga? If so, does anyone
know where to get these drivers from? I don't recall ever seeing such
a thing on Aminet.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Hi,

I ordered a keyboard adapter and bought a nice ergonomic
Win95-keyboard for it. I installed the hardware and connected the
drive. But even aver using the Win95 keymap I got the Windows keys
couldn't be used as Amiga keys! :(

you can imagine how bad Amiga handling without Amiga keys is...

any ideas?

   You shouldn't need to do a low level format, as the drive should already have had it done while it was being manufacturered.

   Well, try just partitioning it and doing a workbench format. If it doesn't work, then low-level format it and try again.

   There's no such thing as a PC harddrive, it works the same for any computer. The partition on it may not be recognised by Workbench, but you can simply delete the partition with HDTools and create your amiga partitions.

   You can run 2 harddrives at once if you've the right leads (and keep the case off if you've an A1200.  But you may well be better off getting a pro to do it.

See ya :)

Sounds like an LS120 clone, but the parallel port bit stops you using it,
unless you can find a EPP interface like those you get for clockports.

If it's a serial modem, it'll almost certainly work. You just need to know
the right commnds to Miami or whatever to operate it. (Should be in the
manual, if Miami can't work them out itself)

I believe the Catweasel supports the LS120, it seems to support
about everything else, too.

Hi Stefan

-> I ordered a keyboard adapter and bought a nice ergonomic
-> Win95-keyboard for it. I installed the hardware and connected
-> the drive. But even aver using the Win95 keymap I got the
-> Windows keys couldn't be used as Amiga keys! :(
-> 
-> you can imagine how bad Amiga handling without Amiga keys is...

On the win95 keyboard/interface I bought, F11 and F12 are used as
left and right amiga. Maybe its the same on yours? Its a pain in
the ass I know.. Anyone know if theres some way to map F11-F12 
to the windoze keys?

Aha, this is what I've been wondering. HDToolbox *will* recognise it even

On my $20 Win95 keyboard,  there are no F11 & F12 keys,
only the AT keyboards had those as far as I know.
The Windows Keys ARE mapped as L&R-Amiga on mine.
   (My interface uses a little PIC chip to convert the keycodes)

If I plug in an AT keyboard, the amiga keys
turn up on F11 & F12.

Sounds like you have some sort of  "mongrel" version.

Try a W95 Keyboard with only 10  F keys....

"Low level format" is sometimes necessary to prepare SCSI disks for
partitioning and system formatting.  It is /not/ required for IDE, and I don't
recommend you try, although all drives since the 120MB era should ignore it
and not wreck the drive.

Low level formatting is not the same thing as a Workbench/system format - you
can't format the drive until it's partitioned.

The stages are basically:

Fit the drive.
Boot the HD Install disk.
Start HDToolBox.
Create your partitions.
Reboot with the HD Install disk (to ensure the new partitions are recognised).
Format them by selecting the icon then choosing Format from the menus.

Copying software across from an existing drive can be tricky - you need to get
the two drives talking over the IDE bus at the same time if you want to skip
the backup stage.  Set the new one to slave, and connect both to a 3 plug IDE
cable.  If you can get it to boot okay, fine - partition the new drive (be
careful not to nuke the old one!) and copy the stuff across (use "Copy hd0:
newhd0: all CLONE" format - without the clone bit all your file dates and
comments will be lost!

He's a PC user, right?  Assuming it's an external modem, you just plug it into
your serial port and go (after turning up your serial port speed in Miami or
whatever :).  If it's internal, forget it - it won't work at all.

If you like, I can send you my keymap, which has worked fine on my Amiga and
natural keyboard for a couple of months now. Im presuming that they are
pretty much the same as the Microsoft one which i have (it was a present, ok

Hi Colin...

Does that exist?? In sweden all PC keyboards from, like 8x or somthing, have
12 F keys.. IIRC, never used much PCs :)

Subject: [just-amiga] Hard Drive Settings 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Greetings Helpful Amigans...

The query below is a bit long, so anyone can answer privately to save
cluttering up the mail lists,  unless you think the answers may be of
general interest.

Some questions on Hard Drive Settings
-------------------------------------
I  have two internal hard drives fitted to my A1200 - 2 partitions on
each.  I don't know the brand names of either, and have only a number
to differentiate between them.  (Please see NOTE 1: below).

They  were setup by the previous owner with the aid of the technician
who  fitted  them  inside the A1200. No probs in the 6 years (approx)
I've had the computer, but I'm curious about some of the settings and
the  Amiga  Hard  Drive  User  Guide  leaves a lot to be desired. I'm
fairly sure the two internal Hard Drives are 2.5"

Below are the settings for the 2 hard drives, 2 partitions on each.

HD0: is my boot partition.

The settings I'm curious about are...
-------------------------------------
Partitions HD0: and HD3:  Surfaces        =3D 4     ON HARD DISK ONE
                          BlocksPerTrack  =3D 32
                          BufMemType      =3D 1

Partitions HD1: and HD2:  Surfaces        =3D 15    ON HARD DISK TWO
                          BlocksPerTrack  =3D 17
                          BufMemType      =3D 0

Why the different figures, and what do these figures actually mean?

Buffers settings...
-------------------
SysINFO (and similar utils) show Buffers on all partitions set at 30,
but  HDToolbox  insists  HD0: is set at 60 - why do the various utils
report different settings?

What is the ideal Buffers setting, and can these settings be changed,
without resorting to re-formatting, etc.

The Mask settings are...
------------------------
Partition HD0:  Mask =3D 0xFFFFFFFE    ON HARD DISK ONE
Partition HD3:  Mask =3D 0x7FFFFFFE    ON HARD DISK ONE

Partition HD1:  Mask =3D 0x7FFFFFFE    ON HARD DISK TWO
Partition HD2:  Mask =3D 0x7FFFFFFE    ON HARD DISK TWO

Why 0xFFFFFFFE on the HD0: partition on Hard Disk one,  and why isn't
the most used one, Mask =3D 0x7FFFFFFE the same for all partitions?

Does this Mask setting have any effect on the speed of operations?

SysINFO reports the speed as... (approximately)

        354k bps on partitions HD0: and HD3: on Hard Disk ONE,

and a sloooww...

        193k bps on partitions HD1: and HD2: on Hard Disk TWO.

I  have  Disk Expander on partitions HD1: and HD2: on Hard Disk two -
would  this cause the  vast  difference between the speeds of the two
drives?  DE is a Stacker like program,  (in case anyone asks) and has
often saved my bacon, (automatic Hard Drive validation, etc.)

I understand that SysINFO is known to give erroneous information, but
lacking any other utility of this type, it will have to do.

The DosType settings...
-----------------------
The  DosType =3D 0x444F5303 on HD0: in HD one is for FFS international.
Why would the other 3 partitions be set at 0x444F5301? (default FFS)

NOTE 1:  Last, but not least, the ID numbers: ST9051A and ST9114A
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I presume these will tell someone in the know what brand they are, as
I have no idea - can anyone elucidate me?

Finally, which of ALL THE ABOVE settings can I SAFELY alter, and then
save, without resorting to re-formatting, etc.

Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated. Thanx in advance.

This is the info I was looking for. Thanks.

Yes, I want to do something similar. Keep my original drive (boot)
change the second drive to the new drive, do all the bits and pieces
necessary to this new drive. A bit simplistic as I know there's a lot
more involved than the above. I suppose I'll get there in the end.

i only saw Win95-keyboards _with_ the 11th and 12th f-key. Today I
called Vesalia and ordered another adapter which should fix the
problem since it is not connected to the chip next to the
keyboard-thingy on the motherboard but directly to this keyboard-
thingy. they promised to at least refund a certain amount of the old
adapter when I send it back.

I was just about to do the same thing. Except I broke the adapter

Anyone know any DECENT pc keyboard adapters that arent those

a few of those just by swapping them between motherboards..

Mr. Hardware was showing an outstanding little converter at the A2K show. I
have a couple on order at this time. Might contact them at
www.li.net/~hardware - and of course tell them I sent you. It will surely get
me a truckload of free goodies... ;^)

Another place that was doing A1200 conversions (including keyboards, I think)
was EyeTech. They are in England but... really some nice goodies.

Sorry, can't agree with that. :))

I use a 'mongrel' Win95 keyboard (with F1 - F12), on my A1200, and my Windows
Keys function as L & R Amiga keys ok here.

Next idea please :))

  Nope,  I mean an AT keyboard for PC-AT  crate.

   A "mongrel"  is a creature of mixed  & various parentage,

In IBrowse, go to the menu titled:   "Preferences"
and then select the "Settings" option....

I havn't got the right libs to edit my Ibrowse prefs. 

Would someone mind me sending my prefs so they can
change one thing in them? I want to change the
homepage, nothing more.

I had no problem doing that - but I had to remove some of the metal
shielding inside the A1200. bad work :(

Subject: [just-amiga] replacing NetTime / Silversurfer
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


Hi,

I installed the nice working Silversurfer today and am now needing a
program that can replace NetTime. I want a little window on the
workbench that shows how long I'm online - and does that with
silversurfer.device instead of serial.device.

regards,
Stefan

Hello All

I just installed WW7 on my Amiga and it's not terribly stable.
I have tried the 7.01 update patch didn't improve things too much.
The Amiga freezes most times, after 5-10 mins use.
I set it for Picasso

I realise it possibly a hack/patch conflict but I wondered if anyone
else has had similar problem.

A2000-40 112Mb Ram OS3.5 PicassoIV TurboPrint7.11b

Hacks:- MagicMenu, PowerSnap, ClicktoFront

Isn't that excellent website hosted off one of the best

like this,

Hey I might not be editor but i can still plug to death! :)

Its so we can all come round to your house and help you
"spend" your well earned money :)

As this email seems pretty pointless and to save being
flamed, i have a question to make it worthwhile..

BTInternet (UK only):

Btinternet is offering evenings 6pm-midnight and all
weekend for a flat rate or =A39.99 per month. Is anyone
on this deal, 2 questions:

1) Can you get through all the time each time it logs
you off after 2 hours or have do you regularly get
engaged tones.

2) The dialup number is 0800 right, ie free from all
telephone companies, i'm on Cable & Wireless so surely
as its 0800 i can use it also, or do you for definate
have to be on a BT phone line?

Thanks!

If you are on C&W you may be able to use the ntl: freebie Internet
recently launched, If I remember right I think they were bought by ntl:
although I'm not sure for definate.

Support@ntlworld.com should be able to help although they are very busy
answering emails so do expect a long delay.

There are some free phone numbers on their website somewhere if you want to
give them a call ? - http://www.ntlworld.com

I regret to say that BT internet is actually pretty usable. No engaged
tones and it is very fast!

It is an 0800 number so as long as your phone company charge 0800 calls
free (most of them except mobiles perhaps) you won't have any problems.

I think you can use the ntl: access via a BT line. You just get a box
and plug it in your phoneline so that all your calls are redirected
through NTL:'s systems. But don't quote me on that!

As for actual cable.... Come on! I live in Lincolnshire here!! heheh ;))

Humm.. I doubt those hacks would make a machine terribly unstable, but 
the most offensive one based on my experience would be MagicMenu, some 
programs just don't like how it handles menu's. Although I use it along 
with the other hacks you have, and I don't consider PowerSnap or 
Clicktofront hacks... they've been living quite well on my system for 
years:) I suspect WW7 is the hack to toast.  With all that ram, perhaps 
you have a sour chip or RF noise?

3.5 has been around for almost a half a year.. and is holding up well, 
going back a step in O/S is not going to solve much. It's better to come 
up with workarounds or just don't run stuff that doesn't play by the rules.

Hi all,

I need a new mouse, as my left button is packing in.

I'd like:
- three buttons (I use the middle one for left-double-click);
- _no_ wheel.

Any suggestions?  Should I buy an Amiga mouse, or a PC serial mouse
and a Punchinello adaptor?

Thanks,

-Stephen

right, im not on BT but my m8 is, and i use his acct regularly (but not now
they have found out, but thats another story)
The service is excellent, first time connect every time. for those of u who
dont know about the times, its from 6pm - 12am weeknights, and on friday
night it carries on untill sunday 12am. U hardly ever get any lag at all.
except when they cut me off because im not the acct holder, if anyone wants
to know the full story, mail me off list, its quite funny).

after defrauding btinternet for a week now im going to sign up myself. its
cheap as anything and u dont have to use the 0845 if u dont want to.
therefore id recommend it to anybody.

Cheers,

A quick look on altavista, and:

ST9051A- A Seagate drive.

ST9114A- Given the similar number, also Seagate.

Is that any help at all? Maybe you can look on Seagate's website for more
detailed info.
I seem to remember that http://www.pc-disk.de had many dive details. Give

I can strongly recommend the Punchinello adaptor. The mouse supplied with it
( in the 24.95  package ) is of good quality but comes with a wheel -
however, the wheel can be used as a third mouse button if you have the
software. 
Punchinello is fully compatible with early start-up menus by the way. 

Only possible drawback is the adaptor size. It protrudes 5 inches from the
back of the Amiga so if desktop space is tight you may need to look at
other alternatives.

Excellent, that's good to know.

Not a problem, I've got plenty of space.

sad to hear - otherwise I'd recommend my great new 3-button-

btw: what does 'rodent' mean?

He means LS-120. That is, the drive from Panasonic (?), that reads/writes

Thx Sandy. I'll try them when my ISP has finished mucking around, It
seems I've been locked out of all URL's in my address list except
Merlin itself, and I couldn't even send them a mail to complain.

BTW... one of the ShowConfig clones reported that the small drive
was a Microbotix. This is the drive that came fitted to my A1200.

Regards... Tony

Subject: [just-amiga] DIY Tower
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello all,

I'm new to the list & new to this comms stuff :-)

I've been toying with the idea of jamming my A1500 into a tower case, just
so i can get more drives and stuff in really :-))

I was wondering if anyone out there had tried something like this and could
recommend a course of action.

 Maplins do an ATX tower case that is massive (620x190x415mm) (order code TT94C) 
and in theory that should give enough room to get my motherboard in, as you
know the A2k/A15k is not exactly a dainty beast.

However i dont want to fork out 30 odd squids before checking out other
options. Any help with this would be much appreciated thanx.

Kind regards

                         Miclk

I did just this, it not for the faint hearted, I found a full sized AT
tower. Then after quite a lot of metal work, i.e. cutting port slots
removing a couple of my new found 5=BE bays, turning the PSU thru 90
degrees, it all came together.

I have heard another route is to use a Midi sized PC case piggy backed
as an additional large drive bay. (A lot less hassle)

I needed access to the CPU,and Video slots and this was the
difficultly for me hence all the cutting.

Oh and some connectors are on the front of the 1k5/2k Mboard like
mouse/key ports and I made leads up to route them to the rear of the
case.

There is at least one description of the task in Aminet probably under
Hard/Hacks.

Good luck in your endeavours.

one case into the other, if so what U R saying is just bung a little (midi)
tower on top of my existing case just to keep the extra drives in yes ?

Hello,
The archive mailed out to subscribers and uploaded to Aminet had one corrupt
file in it.  Nothing critical, just a picture grab that refused to archive
properly.  It's been fixed, and the correct version of the archive is now
on the AIO site and has just been uploaded again to Aminet (should be up in
a day or two).

Sorry about the problem.

Subject: [just-amiga] HD Cache
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A few weeks ago, someone mentioned that modern HD's shouldn't be
formatted with a Directory Cache.
I have a 1.2GB Toshiba MK2720FC, which I DID format (in 4
partitions) with Cache ON.

The only thing I have noticed of concern, is that numerous small
files take a very long time to read or delete.

Could this be caused by the Directory Cache setting ON at
formatting?
Should I reformat with Directory Cache OFF?
Is there a way to do this without deleting everything?

Thanks in anticipation!!

Short answer = yes.

Also, make sure that you do not have it ticked withing HDToolbox.

This is from the OS3.5 manual.

  Directory Cache

  Using the directory cache is not recommended for hard drives, only in very special cases
  should this option be activated.

Regards
Dom...

There is a utility by Holger Kruse on Aminet called 'Re-Org', which I
believe is version 3.11.  This is a utility for optimising hard drives, but
it also gives you the option of choosing a different file system when you
proceed with the optimisation.  The only drawback is that optimising hard
drives can be risky at times, so it is usually advisable to do a back up
first.  Hope this info helps you.

The short & safe answer is no,
you would be better to copy the files to somewhere else
& reformat the partition...
Then copy the files back...

There is however, other options, but I would have to type 
far too much & my fingers are tired....

   I've used Re-org on my 4.3gig harddrive a few times, with no problems. I presume that if you use it's fileformat converting, then it should work noprob.

   If you have more then 1 partition, you could compress everything onto one partition, reorg the other one. Then swap the backup and do the next one etc. 
Then you can unarchive everything back :)

See ya :)

Yes, this is caused by it.  Dir cache should only be used on floppy disks,
where the medium is slower than the cache.  Other mediums are actually much
faster than the cache it uses.

You should format to FFS International.  International mode uses no extra disk
space or speed and is identical except that non-English Latinised characters
are ordered correctly.

You can /try/ ReOrg, which has an option to alter the FFS type while it's
working.  I would very much recommend that you backup even before using this
however - I once lost a HDs contents when the machine went down during reorg.

Thanks everyone for the advice - I'll try reformatting using
ReOrg, and if that's no good I'll hit it with a full format.

There isn't a need to re-format the drive in any circumstance. In the
unlikely event re-org didn't work, just open HDTools, change the
filesystem settings to normal FFS (no directory caching) on each
partition and then save the new RDB settings. The drive should work
the same as before, with everything still in its place. It isn't the
filesystem you are changing, just some options in it.

The brain is a wonderful organ; it starts working the moment you get
up in the morning and doesn't stop until you get to work.

How about rallying a group of developers to port Java to the classic Amiga
:-) 68k/ppc optimized? It would be a great project to start up... It seems
no "one person" can get JAVA ported, but maybe a group effort would succeed
and somone dedicated to getting it started and organized would go a long
way. Maybe set up a CVS and get a group going :-) JAVA is a web based thing
and Amiga! :-)

Yes
Sometimes wish I had gone that route as I had to give up some drive
bays to fit the M/board in.

Subject: [just-amiga] Possibily the slowest email EVER?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi all!

For the die-hard AIO fans you may remember in the Christmas
1998 period there where about 5 competitions in AIO. one
of those was a vulcan competition, I think the question was
what was Vulcans first game called or the first speech
adventure, i'm not sure, anyway that was Christmas of 1998.

On 28th of April 2000 I have received an entry for that
competition dated:

Date    Sun, 20 Dec 1998 09:43:30 +0500
Subject    Vulcan Compo

I didn't believe it myself, i checked all the headers
to see if it has been fiddled and it doesn't appear
to have been.

This could easily be done as a joke but i'm unsure why
someone would bother.

Looks like it could be an email to take the longest
time ever to reach someone although i'm unsure why.

Very strange.

Toodle Pip!

Subject: [just-amiga] Web-based project needs EXPERIENCED html coder.
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi All,

This is off-topic so its not Amiga related.

I am planning a big big BIG project which is web based
and nothing really to do with the Amiga, except I
suppose the fact that I will be running it in main from
an Amiga.

I am looking for a VERY experienced HTML coder with
knowledge of cgi etc scripts, tables, forms, all the
fancy bells and whistles.

I don't want to say too much about the actual project
so if your someone who is truely great at HTML then
get in touch,

chris@aio.co.uk

Toodle Pip!

Complain bitterly to EGroups for not informing ANYONE that they were going to
start sending OneList lists from an EGroups address.

I lost quite a few messages due to it.  Do they think nobody has security
systems? :(

I've been considering this, I may have a CVS server I could 'procure'... 
Apart from AmigaOS needing a better Java implementation than Kaffe, there's
also MorphOS and AROS to think about - both of which will good Java support.

I don't think the right word would be 'port' - considering everything, we'd
probably be looking at implementing Java from the specifications.  I did ask
Holger Kruse about Daytona, but I think whatever existed of that has gone to
byte hell.

A lot of work?  Yeah, but I'll do anything to get away from the Windows/Linux
implementations :)

Hi everyone,
    Just wanted to let you know that I will be off-line for the summer. I
will be in the process of moving and selling some of my father's property.
There is very poor Net access where I am going and it is much too expensive
for me to do much on the Net. I am also forced to sell my Amiga so I can
get things going with my father's property. So I hope things keep
progressing along so that when I am able to be back on-line you will all be
well and as witty as ever.
    My actual sign off will be next week sometime. Take care.

-----Don

Freeserve at one time had a habit of not doing the mail thang.

 CS> Plus what the hell is this redhotants.com thingymabob?

Why not go and see?  It's 20 a year for 0800 internet access, from the
Free4All people.  I have yet to hear a bad word said about them.

Freeserve have had a week to process my (10 a month 0800 access) order and
still haven't replied.

I am new to Internet and receive messages 'you are about to submit data in
an insecure way' - ok for now but some sites require encryption as
condition of use, so I have experimented by sending emails to myself using:

(1st): 'encryption' Security option on my mailer - resulted in my internet
access prog jamming up so had to shut down and reload.

(2nd): 'anonymous' Security option. then realised it had sent it to
'remailer'.

What I expected to happen was I would receive the email without a sender
address. Obviously not the case - trying to see why.

I am using: Amiga 1200 computer, 68030/40 CPU accel. (not sure whether FPU
present), IBM DALA 540Mb HD, USRobotics 'Courier' modem (V34fax with
V32bis).
        Software:   Miami 2.0 Internet access
                    YAM   2.0 Mailer
                    Voyager 2.95 & 3.2 browsers
