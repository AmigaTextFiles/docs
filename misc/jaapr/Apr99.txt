From: Rick Giles <rickgiles@clear.net.nz>


There's a point, are Zip disks compatable between us and a PC? Or Mac?

                  Cool Enough, TTFN!!

Right.... did you errmm switch off as you where reading this message?
you clearly have messed up totally. You 'mis-quote' me and then start
saying to me that my english literature attendance was on the low
side, ermm hello, did i say anything about that, you have merged someone
elses mail with my quote and had a moan at me?! strange...

You obviously did not understand what I was saying. What I meant was
the text makes out that the person, ie. the hacker is a super brain and
I am saying that you don't have to do well in all subjects to be a
hacker.
You could mess up big time on every subject but you can still be a
hacker, the text makes it seem like you need to be someone who is
clever in everything otherwise you don't have a chance of being
a hacker.

Hmpf..

I buy in the us, and it's no hatle and very much cheaper ! 
(for amigacentral.com) But me and some m8's are setting up our
own webhosting server soon, we just need to think of a cool domain name
and by a linux box !

Hehe, does tricking your friend include taking over channels with
outop on a spoofed host ;) I've been trying to do this for years
with no luck, mainly because amiga's don't really support raw 
socket tcp packeys very well ! It'll work well if you had root
on a linux box :) Oh and then you need to know vunrable name servers
(dns) and begin host's !But aprart from that it's easy ;)

Yours

A Thousand Appologies But the flame wasn`t directed at you it was
directed at somebody who i thought was having a go at my original
message.

you are in my mind a great person and i would not even consider having
a moan at you!!!

Thanks for this and to Sandy who also suggested this but I did find a
cheaper place by searching on yahoo.co.uk why did I not think of this
in the first place? :)

> Are there?

Ermm, yes. I suppose IRC servers these days check alot of things, but
some of the less used one could allow this, i have seen it done on Efnet
with a PC user but he logged off soon after, he had an IP like,

<something@FNEKDKSSDDMSLDMDDKMFSMKFDS>

can't remember what was before the '@' but just lots of letters after,
and this I can assure you is not a shell.

I suppose to find a program to do this you would have to know where
to 'look' and I doubt that someone who knows how to do is releases
trade secrets like that ;) I suppose i'll just have to fool my mate with
a shell, oh dear...

Regards!

Who did you find ?

I have a shell account with wildstar.net but no IRCnet servers will accept a host
from that domain. :((

I did look at UKShells but their webpage signup form didn't accept online VISA
and I couldn't be bothered phoning.

We use Amigas, pardon my french but we can read every fucking filing system
under the sun ;) Just for mat it to the pc FS if you want to share info. If
not then I reccomend using them as harddrive partions.

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I know this is the /Just*/ *Amiga list, but you guys are
probably a lot more help then any PC manufacturas help desk:


   All I ask is why, when 'My Computer' clearly shows there 
to be 2.2 gigs of free space on my PC's 9 gig hd, does windows 
not let me write ANYTHING to the drive saying 'Disk is Full'.
   (I had to start deleting stuff)

   And no, there is NO way that I am gonna compressing that 
drive. And yes, its FAT32 formatted.


   If I was into the conspiracy theory, I'd say that
Windows was reserving enough space for the minimum
installating of the next version of Windows just to make
sure that every one has enough space to buy it.
   Ofcorce, I suspect its probably because MS-Dos file 
system's just crap and the 2.2 gigs of 'free' space is 
simply the space the 'FAT' is taking up.



   So, um, any ideas? 

See ya.

> There's a point, are Zip disks compatable between us and a PC? Or Mac?

Hello Rick,

	Zip disks are the same disks regardless of were the drives is 
connected. But the format and directory arrangement will be specific to 
the machine it's hooked up to. You'll have to use multi-formatting 
software such as X-dos or X-Mac to read zips that have been initialised 
on PC's or Macs. Watchout though there is new double capacity zip disk 
now coming available... Hope that helps.

From: Frank Bunton <bunton@acay.com.au>


For information of all who used ot use the Australian Aminet mirror

Re my recent enquiry about status of the Australian Aminet mirror on the
Livewire web site.

Livewire now seems to be back on line but this message has appeared:-

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Start message on Livewire ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

31st March 1999

PLEASE NOTE

The Aminet Archive located on Livewire was lost after a RAID failure.
Owing to the low utilisation, the archive will not be restored.

Access numbers, dwindling CDRom sales (including not having the time to
sell them anymore locally) plus space utilisation were the three
deciding 
factors leading to the decision to not restore Aminet.

I would personally like to than Urban Mueller for his time, help and
support (in the form of CDRoms) to enable me to run the mirror for so
long.  Without the support Urban gave, Aminet would of disappeared 2
years ago.

Also, thanks must also go to Dr. Greg Perry - GPSoftware - for initial
support of the Archive.  GPSoftware sponsored the mirror for as long as
they could and got the archive through quite a few tight spots.

Thanks,

Ross Delaforce - ross@livewire.com.au
Archive Administrator
Livewire Communications

Please follow official instructions below to unsubscribe properly!

*******************************************************************

First, ask your Internet Provider to mail you an Unsubscribing
Kit.  Then follow these directions.

The kit will most likely be the standard no-fault type.  Depending
on requirements, System A and/or System B can be used.  When
operating System A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron
unsubscriber will be dispensed through the slot immediately
underneath.  When you have fastened the adhesive lip, attach
connection marked by the large `X' outlet hose.  Twist the silver-
coloured ring one inch below the connection point until you feel
it lock.

The kit is now ready for use.  The Cin-Eliminator is activated by
the small switch on the lip.  When securing, twist the ring back
to its initial condition, so that the two orange lines meet.
Disconnect.  Place the dalkron unsubscriber in the vacuum
receptacle to the rear.  Activate by pressing the blue button.

The controls for System B are located on the opposite side.  The
red release switch places the Cin-Eliminator into position; it can
be adjusted manually up or down by pressing the blue manual
release button.  The opening is self- adjusting.  To secure after
use, press the green button, which simultaneously activates the
evaporator and returns the Cin-Eliminator to its storage position.

You may log off if the green exit light is on over the evaporator
.  If the red light is illuminated, one of the Cin-Eliminator
requirements has not been properly implemented.  Press the ``List
Guy'' call button on the right of the evaporator .  He will secure
all facilities from his control panel.

To use the Auto-Unsub, first undress and place all your clothes in
the clothes rack.  Put on the velcro slippers located in the
cabinet immediately below.  Enter the shower, taking the entire
kit with you.  On the control panel to your upper right upon
entering you will see a ``Shower seal'' button.  Press to
activate.  A green light will then be illuminated immediately
below.  On the intensity knob, select the desired setting.  Now
depress the Auto-Unsub activation lever.  Bathe normally.

The Auto-Unsub will automatically go off after three minutes
unless you activate the ``Manual off'' override switch by flipping
it up.  When you are ready to leave, press the blue ``Shower
seal'' release button.  The door will open and you may leave.
Please remove the velcro slippers and place them in their
container.  If you prefer the ultrasonic log-off mode, press the
indicated blue button.  When the twin panels open, pull forward by
rings A & B.  The knob to the left, just below the blue light, has
three settings, low, medium or high.  For normal use, the medium
setting is suggested.

After these settings have been made, you can activate the device
by switching to the ``ON'' position the clearly marked red switch.
If during the unsubscribing operation, you wish to change the
settings, place the ``manual off'' override switch in the ``OFF''
position.  You may now make the change and repeat the cycle.  When
the green exit light goes on, you may log off and have lunch.
Please close the door behind you.

X-UIDL: d32bef0b6d017d12ec52a7c3c88a8601

From: "Robert A. Sisk" <RSisk@world.std.com>

I've installed an internal IDE CD-ROM drive in my A4000 with AmigaOS 3.1,
and I've dragged the CD0 file from Storage/DOSDrivers to Devs:DOSDrivers.
When I load a CD into the drawer, I can hear it spin up, but no icon for it
appears on the Workbench. The Info command shows unit CD0: as having no
disk
present.

How can I get the drive to recognize a disk? I'd appreciate any help from
the list. Thank you.

 Have you tried typing diskchange into a CLI window?

Typing diskchange cd0: has no apparent effect.

You need to do a LoadV43Modules ( from amiga.de/files/SCSI_IDE_43.24.lha  )
so the IDE on the A4000 will be able to work the ATAPI CD drive properly.

Get the patch from amiga.de & READ THE DOCS FIRST....  
It will then work fine...

I know, I have one....

I suggest you to try IDEFix97 3.4 (Aminet).
You can use data CDs, audio CDs, a CDDA player, a CD32 emulator.
And if you like it, you can register and use every update without any
annoying requester.

On 03-Apr-99 Thomas Hurst said, about '[just-amiga] Re: UK shells and irc
spoof ip':

> Are there?
 
I did a little bit of investigation this weekend on irc with my
'accosciates' most of it i kew allready but i've learned some more,
so i'll explian about A little more about spoofing :)

there are three sort's of Spoofing Telnet, IRC and TCP, all are
pretty obvious what they are so i won't examplian. But if you
coudl TCP Spoof then you 'could' play your little trick. Chris.
:) As yet i have not managed it on the amiga due to me knot
knowing a chacher, or begin host that i can spoof of
( i know dns (NS) servers that i can). IRC spoofing is allmost
impossible nowdays, as ther IRCd servers have been updraged to
pick out spoofers etc. There is slighty dodgy way to gain a 
differnet host (and IP) on irc, via Proxies or Wingates,
if You'd liek to know bout this, mail me ;) Erm Fianlly you
coudl use a VHost for IRC Spoofing, well it's not spoofing
it's a Virtual host, but i'm a bit cloudy on this area,
it more or less let's you make up a Host for your machine
i've seen it on on IRCNET #amiga a few times, having hosts like

bot@i.steal.things.from.macd0nalds.com etc.

I think ukshells / grid9.net shells offer this, it's a part
of the unix IRC Clinet, BitchX (i have amiga bitchX but it's
dire ;))

There are EXE's for Amiga spoofing, that are meant to work, but
amiga TCP/IP has crappy RAW Socket implimentation (not at all
in some ways) and not Fork and other such tcp/ip things, which
*nix's have. IF you'd liek the exe's then i'll again, mail
me privatly and i'll send them off to you, i don't really see
the harm :P. 

Oh and don't ask me how i got them, or how i know all this stuff ;) 

Yours

What I meant was that ibms use hd space for swap space and/or virtual memory.
If you have those options set, that may be what is holding your space.
Conversely, you could be just another ibm lamer with a virus. Q8-{)

I put LoadV43Module and a1000.ld.strip in C: and added

  LoadV43Module >NIL: C:a1000.ld.strip REBOOT

to my S:Startup-Sequence before SetPatch and rebooted, but the drive still
doesn't recognize disks.

X-UIDL: 51f35056389b916f3072f998d152796e

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

   Ok, I'm very worried about my PPC A1200 desktop:

   this morning when I turned it on, mu harddrive was dead! (it didn't spin
up at all, but I could see the green led on it flash through the vents).

   very worried about it, I opened my amiga up and unplugged everything from
the inside and just had the harddrive power cable in. It worked fine. I
reconnected every thing and it all worked perfectly.

   I shrugged it off as a loose connection and thought no more of it.


   Until just now when my hd just suddenly stopped, and when I powered down
and back on it span half up, stopped and made some very worring noises!!!
(and the h.disk access led flashed). I turned it all off, opened it up
again and just pushed all the connections back in, and unplugged the floppy
power lead. Again the harddrive worked fine.


   So whats going on? Is my hard drive, floppy drive, internal leads or
power supply dying (heaven forbid!!!!!!), or was it just chance that this
happened for the first time, twice on the same day??

   (I'm afraid, very afraid!)

See ya.

Hi Everybody,

> Do you use a standard power-supply?

   Ha. 
Well Yes, if you call a heavy duty 200W PC power supply standard that is ;)

Anyway, if it was a power shortage, it would have happened a long time ago.
(unless my power supply is dying, how do I check it?)
   

See ya.

If you do the following steps, all will be well.

1. Back up ALL important data
2. Unplug the hard drive
3. Direct the harddrive toward the nearest bin
4. shed a tear, for 'tis now an ex harddrive
5. Buy a new harddrive
6. Plug in the new harddrive
7. Restore data to new drive
8. There is no 8.

Before doing that, it would be wise to make sure the PSU isn't flaking
out and is failing to give the HD enough power to spin up. try
disconnecting everything apart from the harddrive, and see how that
goes. . .

1200 power supply has barely enough to drive the 1200 and floppy. Each added
device means more drain on a cheap power supply (damn commodore). Get an
external ps if possible.

This is how I would do. Get a digital voltmeter and two thin single wires.
Connect the wires to the HDs power supply by squeezing them into the
connector from the back and pull the other ends throu the chassis.
Conncet them to the voltmeters wires using insulation tape to prevent
a short circuit.
If the power drops low when running it may be the PSU. It might
as well be your HD causing this. Has your HD any problem to spin
up when you start your miggy? In that case it could be the motor
or the motor controller going bad. Get HDOff or any other power-saving
utility that turn your HDs motor off. Then keep an eye on the
voltmeter. If there's sudden power-drops it's probably the PSU.
I guess that your problem starts when the computer has been
running for a while, right? That would point to a heat-related fault
and then again I'd suspect the PSU.

But before anything else, MAKE A BACK-UP. Your HD has
been kind enough to give you a warning. Take it seriously,
next time...

From: mIFo <bachorim@frpd.utcpd.sk>

Hello everybody .. I read very interesting article about very powerful
chip, which I think could be one of candidates for NG Amiga .. It's called
ElbRus III  and comes from Russia .. It is no RISC or CISC , it's based on
(sorry I'm not sure it is the right translation) parallel architecture and
its constructors said it is four time faster than Merced should be (and
it'll be out next year). I'm not sure, but consider this:
It comes from Russia, it'll be very cheap ..
Very few people know about this .. 
It is four times faster than Merced ( MMC should be 5 times faster thn any
pentium based PC)..

so .. we'll see :)

To the best of my knowledge, the only gif lib there is
"personal_gif_io.library", and this one you should be getting with PPaint.
It's version 5.1 and dates back the day before X-mas 1994... I don't know
anything about any newer versions...

X-UIDL: 34a95e78646d2ef20d33ec2c86378bfc

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Ok, i've decided to write an article, well... not exactly but i'm going
to
write a piece or something, not for AIO just to see what you think, its
just me babbling on but it may make sence and it may not, who knows,
and honestly does anyone really care?

Before I start excuse grammer and spelling errors because i'm
not checking after i've typed it ;)

I've been thinking about the computer industry alot, its funny isn't
it, you get these well known computer companies, well in computer and
console circles that are 'known'. The team name is known, through
out the world PC and console users mainly have heard to often of
Team 17, Bullfrog, Rare, Camcom. blar, blar, blab blab.. all these names,
who to an extent are famous, yes? well no famous in the console
users and some computer users circles, outside, well who cares less
about them? team17 who? capcom what? new hair dye? new soap on
TV? the reaction is all to often, certain groups of people will know
them, obviously computer/console users, kids and school and one
or two games playing adults. The rest? they are just kiddies video
games and thats all. But the story is different, the computer and
console industry is now one of the biggest in the world producing
masses of profit for fat cats at the top, so the people who make these
game are famous right?.... wrong! the people who make the games aren't
heard of, great!, credits at the end, does anyone read these? not
exactly, so when do the people who create the games get credit
and are famous, well face it, they don't. Honestly I think this
completely
stinks... if it was the music industry they would all be famous now,
riding around in their sports cars and doing radio interviews..
but its not the music industry, its the computer industry and the
people who do the work get sh*t on. Ok maybe the computer industry
is the best place to go these days, most jobs, better pay, maybe
they are on a good wage but why are they not famous? it is a big
industry, we have film and music industry with its stars and then
we have another big industry the computer/console one, where are
the stars? name me the famous programmers or 3d gfx artists that
are showing up and being treated like they are famous, they just
don't exist. Nearly all the people who make these games are not
known of, name me some people that are famous games makers in
the industry, well I doubt most of you could, maybe some of you can,
but then say that name to a none computer user and see what the
reaction is. Ok the computer industry is VERY different to the
music industry, but is the film industry the same as the music 
industry? i don't think... These stars who we all love, me included
sing a 3:30 minuite song and make hundreds of thousands, ok
they've written the song, have the talent (or not) to sing it,
maybe play something or are in a band but then what, they are
famous and rich if the song is good enough, they make to more
songs and they are set up for life, in total 9 minuites of actual
song and they can retired. Obviously it is not that easy because
you have interviews and concerts and whatever and alot of
stars say it is hard work which it probably is but isn't making
a game hard work? a game can take over 2 or 3 years to be
complete, some times longer and you can be damn sure its going
to last longer than 3 and a half minuites. So 2-3 years in the
making and a game that will say take 80 hours solid to complete
without getting beat or stuck on puzzles, 80 hours of full
gameplay and 2-3 years making, if you think about that it is a
hell of a lot of time in production and then to use the actual
game and complete it.. we compare that with a 3 minuite song,
now do you see the difference? what we have is the two big
industrys, music and film, computer/console industry is
there, just not in a big way and when are we going to see the
programmer stars? not in a long time and I guess never and
again i will say it, if this was the music industry alot of us would
be famous....

Toodle Pip!

   Ha, as if a standard A1200 power suply could run the PPC on its own, let
alone everything else ;) I have a 200W PC power suply of course.

   Anyway, My amiga seems fine today (phew). 

See ya.

   No way, I can't afford a new hard drive! (I'm gonna have a big prob if it
does go! arrrgggg.)

   Anyway, 'tis working fine again, so I'm not too worried any more, I think
its either a loose connetion, or a short somewhere in the internal power
cables (maybe to do with the diskdrive, but thats working fine). I don't
think theres anything wrong with the hard drive its self.

   Like I said, it worked for ages before, and its working again now, but
how can I test to make sure the PSU hasn't developed a fault?

See ya.

IIRC, the "personal_gif_io.library" was only supplied with the commercial
versions due to licencing restrictions by unisys. But if you have a GIF
datatype installed, select "DType" in the loaders options when loading a
GIF file. Unfortunately you still can't save GIF files. :(

   Ok, I'm now performing a whole backup, as I speak.

   I still think that the hard drive its self is innocent, as why would it
not work until I open my amiga up and fiddle with the leads? And it then
works fine for a whole day. (had no problems today)

Always treat any hard disk as it it's about to fail, because one day it
will be true...

Yes, I have it.

I found three changes in your file from the standard one:

  MaxTransfer = 0x100000 > 0x1fe00
  Buffers       5        > 10
  Priority      10       > 5

Also, you changed tool type Unit from 2 to 0. I forgot to mention it, but I
had done this too, to get unit CD0 recognized by the Info command and by
file requestors.

However, using SCSI_IDE43_24 and your mount file still doesn't let my drive
recognize a loaded disk.

For this info, you have to post the lib here once you get it.
I got the lib you're talking about ages ago, but with 3 hd crashes, all 
backups are gone.

To get the gif lib you're talking about you must contact the PPAINT people 
directly and ask for it.

This is just for my info:

Are you using checkdrive 1620 bytes and disksafe 12888 bytes ?? I suspect one 
or both in combo may be actually creating bad sectors.

Moving on, the hardest problem to find that is almost always an intermittant 
is a cut, loose, cold, broken, whatever trace.

 ie: +5v______________________HD_POWER
 
 the one above works.
 ie: +5v________ _____________HD_POWER
 
The one above doesn't..

You should be so lucky to actually be able to see a cut,broken,shorted,cold 
whatever trace.

Wiggling anything can usually make the problem go away. 
Wiggling the right thing can tell you what to fix..

If the voltage were high enough as with the motorola flybacks for the C='s and

the amigas all you needed to do was work in total darkness and watch what 
sparks and where while wiggling.. That won't work with low voltage.

A cut trace on the low DC voltages in the amiga you'll never find it. Only 
possibility is to hit the right spot to wiggle day after day then go at it 
with a microscope to find the break.

Just in case there is a problem with sucking more than 256 blocks
at a time with this drive.

So that when it is reading the CD initially, it did not steal too-much
cpu time from other things I had running at the time.

The comment in the mount file is the original,  the ID is set up in 
the icon on the one I sent you.
On a 4000 the default IDE unit is 0.
/* anything between these characters is a comment */

Well then, I may suggest your CD drive is either buggered or it is not 
connected correctly.

If you share this IDE bus with a harddrive, make sure the 
harddrive is set to:    "Master WITH a non ATA slave"  setting.

Ensure that the CD drive is set to SLAVE.


If you have only the CD on the IDE bus, then set it to:
"Master only, with no slaves"

I would presume you have a SCSI card or something in this case.

Also, test it with one of the Aminet CD's  as icons won't always come
up with Windblows cd's & other things...

I am also using v40.11 of the CDFilesystem.

From: Michael Jaccoud <topgun@pop.ch>

Hello

I've problems with rtg and warp3d screens:
With napalm demo (rtg) and warp3d demo-engine the screens
open, but they are displaced: The bottom of the screen is at the
top of the monitor and the top of the screen is at the bottom of
the monitor, like you scroll the screen 50% up or down.

If I promote eg. the warp3d screen with newmode to the similar
screenmode it works well...

Does somebody know's a solution?

Erm, point of information :-)  fork() (and vfork(), its cousin)
aren't TCP/IP-related, they're the Unix system calls used to create
processes by duplicating an existing process.

Hi

I have been using WW5 now for about 6 months and have only just realised that
the only fonts that are displayed in my font list are the compugraphic fonts, it
just ignores my standard amiga fonts.  I have tried running the various font
programs that came with WW but to no avail.

The fonts are just standard and work with PPaint and Finalwriter but not WW.

Does anyone know if WW supports standard fonts ?

If so how do I use them !

Regards, +W A Y N E+

See 'Standard a3k' Everything but xanim needs a gfx card.

Anyways I finally got it up and running, but it really needs some help. I 
modified a PDF script. only getting 4 colors pink, blue, black and white.. 
Yuck.


If anyone else would just like to see what a MOV looks like, here's the 
script..

.key mov

IF NOT "<mov>" EQ ""
  IF EXISTS "<rtf>"
    IF EXISTS "SYS:libs/libX11/rgb.txt"
      Assign LIBX11: "SYS:libs/libX11"
      Stack 40000
      SYS:c/xanim >NIL: "<mov>"
      Assign LIBX11: REMOVE
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
ELSE
  RequestFile >ENV:mov PATTERN=#?.mov TITLE="Select a Quicktime movie"
  IF NOT $mov EQ ""
    Assign LIBX11: "SYS:libs/libX11"
    Stack 40000
    SYS:c/xanim >NIL: $mov
    Assign LIBX11: REMOVE
  ENDIF
  UNSET mov
ENDIF



The way to call it (that works for me) is s:xanim.scr from the mov command 
line.

   Oh, I was sure one of them at least ran on non-aga. (neither of them need
a gfx card though, works on my aga only A1200).

   Well, I'm afraid I've never used XAnim. Try its command line options.

Yes WW supports standard fonts, but even after you use the given program to
get it to recognise your fonts (after remembering to change the appropriate
tooltype in the program before running it so it scans the right directory
for your fonts), you have to go into Settings (into whichever setting it is
that handles fonts, can't remember right now nor be bothered to look it up,
but it should be easy to finds) and check which fonts you want it to
list/use.  They're given as stuff like True Type, Compugraphic, Amiga
Bitmap, etc.  If it isn't checked then it won't be used.

Ohh, btw, and an 040 or 060 equipped Amiga would be nice.

Well, actually a lot of people know about it :)
 I've read it on a IT-newspaper (Computable), a few popular PC magazines
and I've read about it in the TeamAmiga emailing list (long ago.. 26-feb)
where
somebody forwarded the news about the processor from some newssite.
I did read however that they didn't found anyone to finance/produce them
yet.

One other thing, how do you know it will be cheap? The fact that it comes
from Russia doesn't mean it will be cheap :).
It might also be an expensive chip only meant to be used in supercomputers,
not ment for use in homecomputers :(.

To be honest when I first saw that I was a little disturbed by it but I
decided to let it go because it was an Amiga mailing list and didn`t want to
go off topic but after reading your reply I think it is very much ON-TOPIC
because it is something important that is going on in the world at this very
moment!

What worries me is that the writer of this crap seems to think that proving
"KOSOVO IS SERBIA!" is the main issue here.... It isn`t!! In fact it`s
completely irrelevant in my opinion...... The way I see it, the ONLY thing
that we should be worrying about now is the fact that..... PEOPLE ARE
FUCKING DYING!!!!! (Excuse my language but I feel it is justified!)

Yeah, that's right! They ran into trouble with the packer routine they used
in GIF. All of the sudden some dude figured out they used his routines, so
he sued them for a couple of million bucks or something. The process took
roughly a year and during this time Cloanto couldn't deliver the GIF
filetypr reader and saver. That's the main reason behind PNG ever getting
started BTW... I think

This is all from memory (and my isn't the greatest one TBH) so don't quote
me on anything.

I don't have a fonts menu in my settings options at all, I am using the WW5 SE
version if that makes any difference.

We need more reviews of printers being used by amiga users..

There's only 2 total reviews at

In the meantime while I hold my breath waiting for others to submit reviews of
their printers, does anyone have any pros or cons on printers they're using ?

   ok, a pretty pointless post, but wasn't it that whats-their-name

Hi all.

I know that the manual states that the card is not designed for running in
an A1200 desktop but is there any way it can be done. I have tried but the
system just doesn't boot up. I assume this is because it cannot supply
enough voltage? I have an uprated PSU. Can anyone help?

Thanks.

Subject: [just-amiga] star gemini 10x
X-UIDL: 4396932c3e0f56214732497dfa157e4f

From: ken <cbminfo@digital.net>

Well I found a Star Gemini 10x at the local thrift shop (that works) for
$20.00 
Even got a driver for it from aminet.

There's no manual (not surprised) did a web search and only found 57 pages
with 
+star +gemini +10x +printer in them and none of these really had anything
worth 
keeping a web page for.

Even found one page that had nothing to do with the star 10x printer, but it 
did have all 4 words in it..

Anyways It will print if I use SE (SAS/C text editor) just fine, but I have 
several other editor programs that can do a bit more in the line of printing 
than SE can. ie: Wordworth 5SE. I selected the driver and chose a small phone 
entry style text to print. Nothing fancy just words and numbers in mixed
case..

SE worked fine. Wordsworth spat out a line of capitalized junk (not even a 
full line), then spit out 2 blank pages, and about a third a line of more 
garbage. I finally just turned the printer off with 4 feet of paper on the 
floor and 2 lines of garbage separated by 2 feet of empty space.

Does anyone have either a manula, or know what the switch settings in the back

mean or any other specifics on this printer and maybe why it doesn't print.

Also does this thing also do color ? I saw where you can get 4 color ribbons 
for this printer..

Does anyone know who the company is that made these printers ?

   The company responsible is almost certainly Star, I used to have a Star
LC10, before I got my Cannon BJC blahblahblah.

   I'd leave the switches alone, they probably change between different
fonts and ascii sets.

  The reason it wordworth can't print is almost certainly because you arn't
using the right driver. SE can print because it's just sending text to the
printer, but because WW5 uses graphics, it sends gfx to the printer. If you
have the wrong driver then the other printer interprets this wrong, and
spits out a load of crap.

   I'd look for a different Star driver on aminet, or check the printing
settings on the one your using now.



   If you can't get it working, well, you may have to go and buy a different
printer that has got drivers for the Amiga. (well, its only $20 eh? If your
a good bargainer you might be able to sell it as second hand for more then
that ;) 

See ya.

   Yep, almost everyone seems to be having trouble with the BVision.

Try these:

1. If all the power and the hd come on, but the screen stays black, try a
Ctrl-A-A reboot. (my A1200PPC, no BV. does that, and other peoples do to
for some reason).

2. Failing that, make sure the BV is secure in its port, it may be loose.
(aparently you're supposed to screw it down real tight)

3. Check it runs with the cover off and the keyboard out the way, they could
be pushing it out of its socket.

4. Make sure its not shorting on the metal case underneath it (put a bit of
paper under it or something)

5. Ask the PPC list.

6. Maybe you've got a broken one? Ring the place you got it from or Phase5. 


See ya.

Macromedia's shockwave flash? That one's certainly possible.
I can't find the url again but just let me know and I mail you the archive.

If you are going to talk about Kosovo or whatever and think it is
alright to send out messages for or against Nato action then you
will be removed from the list instantly with no hope of returing to
it. Of course what is going on is very worrying but this has nothing
to do with the Amiga and should not be discussed on this list.

I do not exactly agree, Telnet is not spoofing, you can telnet
in to a Linux or Unix server or even something running SunOS
etc. etc. These are shells and things like @i.eat.at.macd0nald.com
are registered domains being subdomained to have bits before
macd0nald. IRC is not spoofing, spoofing is spoofing and you can
spoof your IP to anything, ie. web pages, irc servers whatever.

Not exactly true to my knoledge either. The IP is not part of the
unix irc client, firstly you have to buy a Shell which gives you
a certain amount of space to run unix/linux programs, bitchx,
ircII, ircd, eggdrop whatever. Then  you  registered the domain
macd0nalds.com or whatever you want, then subdomain to the
words before, this way your IP is being 'pulled' to be used as
i.steal.things.from.macd0nalds.com or whatever you choose.

> Oh and don't ask me how i got them, or how i know all this stuff ;) 

As far as I can tell know one on the list knows and what I already
know seems to be the most anyone on the list knows on this
subject unless some clever d*ck is hiding :)

Spoofing your IP occours when you source-route your
packets - i.e. the data you send to a distant host has both the
destination address and your false source address.

As far as I can tell most if not ALL ircd do what is called IDENT,
this sends back data packets to the suppied IP address to
check if it is real, this is where the IP spoof would occour, but
how is not something I know yet.

Quoting "Oh and don't ask me how i got them, or how i know all 
this stuff ;)" I don't seem to understand because I don't really
see what you know, so how can you say this ;)?

Regards!

Subject: [just-amiga] Slow HD spin down?
X-UIDL: 89c295b27568bad88a763ce045da8867

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Reading Andrew Crowes emails about his HD reminded me that my HD plays
up sometime and wondered if any of you could help. It doesn't effect
me in anyway and my computer is running fine but occationally when I
switch off the computer th HD spins down very slowly and you can hear
it, only takes a few seconds longer than normal and doesn't break 
anything but it sounds strange?

Toodle Pip!

1. Linus Torvalds can be considered a 'star'. Bill Gates too, although he's a
bit more hated.

2. Pop stars generally don't write their music. Some don't sing it themselves
either. And the big guy at the top of the pyramid gets all the money anyway.

3. Who hasn't heard of Martin Galway and Rob Hubbard? Those were the days.

Subject: [just-amiga] Pace 56 Solo mailing list
X-UIDL: f0637de9548e11d770c771425b48a755

From: "Oliver Roberts" <oliver.roberts@iname.com>

Announcing a new mailing list, for owners of the Pace 56 Solo modem...

The mailing list is a discussion forum for owners of Pace 56 Solo
modems.  The subject matter is really anything to do with the Pace 56
Solo - be it, queries, problems, quirks, upgrade woes, etc, etc.  Why
have such a forum?  Well, the main aim is to provide a central place for
all Pace 56 Solo owners to communicate, and hopefully help each other
out with any problems encountered.  I plan to inform Pace should any
bugs in the firmware come to light (i.e. if loads of people appear to
be experiencing the same problem).

The mailing list is open to anyone who has a Pace 56 Solo modem, and it
should be noted that this is a platform independent forum (not just for
PC users!).

To subscribe, go to http://www.egroups.com/list/56solo/ or send a
blank e-mail to 56solo-subscribe@egroups.com

   Well, maybe the programmers arn't in it for the fame, they're in it for
the money? Hell, as long as I got a big juicy pay cheque at the end of each
month I don't think I'd care if anyone knew I'd programmed it.

   Also, with your movie analogy, ok so that stars are famous, but what
about the teams of special effect artists that spend ages doing all the
special effects etc?

   And the music analogy, true it may only be a 3 minute song, but for a
start they have to write the music with the tune, then they spend hours
recording different tracks, mixing and gererally fiddling with it before
they mix it in to the final 3 minute track.


   Anyway, as most modern software is is developed by litrally hundreds of
people, how could you make them all famous? It would be impossible.

See ya.

Subject: [just-amiga] Spectrum and Emplant questions
X-UIDL: 9ba5a52332d57e70da867b5c63eeeb03

From: jack york <jyork@voyager.net>

Hello,

I was recently given an EGS Spectrum graphics system and an Emplant Mac
emulator card (without the chips).  I don't have access to the person that
gave me them ( a friend of a friend who is now overseas ) and I have
several questions I was hoping someone here could answer for me.

On the Spectrum:

 I have it installed and in use but the display is a 640 x 480 screen. 
Maybe
 it's because I am used to working with a normal hi-res screen (640 X 200)
but
 everything on the screen seems out of aspect.  The text and images appear
 wider than they should.  Is it possible (and if so, how ?) to make a driver
 for 640 X 200?  When I look at the specs from workbench prefs, the minimum
 settings are 640 x 480 so I can't change it that way.

 Am I correct in assuming that if I select the standard workbench High Res
 screen driver that I am no longer using the Spectrum package?

 When I switch screens the monitor flashes, as if it was losing power for an
 instant.  Is this normal with Spectrum?

 If I try to set the colors to more than 8, the monitor stays black when I
 boot up.  How do I take advantage of the 24 bit colors?  I tried setting 
 Voyager to use more colors but it didn't seem to make a difference.  BTW, I

 have a stock A3000 with the full 16 meg and 2 meg added by this card.

 There's a black border now around the workbench screen.  I can adjust it
 out with the monitor controls but then other applications do not appear
right.
 Is there a way around this?

 I realize the board isn't supported any longer but are there any updated
libraries
 that I should be aware of?


On the Emplant:

 I have no intention of using the Mac emulator part of it but I would like
to use
 the serial and SCSI ports.  Can I do this without adding the chips?  How
would I
 go about that if it is possible?


If anyone can help me with any of the above I would appreciate it.

Jack

Also when people register as an AIO reader or send me emails,
sometimes people say I like your AOL or please send me AOL each
month. Have AOL brainwashed everyone into typing AOL when you
start a word with 'a' it looks that way ;)

Any why is AOL in Europe no EOL?

Yes but as Linus says mostly the artist doesn't write the music, don't
do the sound and half the time don't sing it, how can you sing to
VengaBoyz?
"We like to party" now "we have loads of money" is what they are saying.

Maybe money is good but fame is something that I look for. Even if just
earning a gereral wage and famous is better me thinks!

Why distinguish SunOS from Unix?  SunOS is derived from BSD Unix.

Yes. But ditch EGS if you're using that. Use Picasso96 or CybergraphX
instead. I don't know how the EGS prefs-programs work but with P96/CGFX
you can create your own screenmodes, as much as the card and your monitor
can handle. Then you just use the screenmode-prefs and chooses a new
resolution for your main display and saves. Hey, 800x600 in 24 bit
(or higher if the card supports it).

CyberGraphX...I recomendend v4.1. Commercial but worth every penny/lire/rubel/
dollar...

No idea, sorry. Give it to me otherwise...could be handy together with
ShapeShifter. Perhaps...

listen.to, come.to, surf.to etc all suck extremely hard. I estimate they
have about 50% downtime, maybe more.

OTOH I've only seen www.amiga.tm down a few times - you might want to try
them out.

I still have my Star Gemini 10x sitting here from my C=64 days - it was
a very popular printer for the C=64.

When I got Amiga I got it to work by using Amiga's printer driver
EpsonXold and it worked fairly well but I soon pensioned it off for a
better one.

I have a manual here somewhere but can't put my hands on it quickly so I
will search around after I am off the web and get back to you next time
I log on. The manual certainly gave all the settings for the dip
switches at the back.

> Also does this thing also do color ? I saw where
> you can get 4 color ribbons for this printer..

>From memory it did not do colour but I will confirm when I find the
manual

Cheers for now ....

Hi,

We're not, Ralph rightly informed that the place for this was not the list.
 However, I thought that the original mail was better directed to the list
to bring to the attention of those who hadn't noticed what Lupus had said
on the list.

I made the mistake though of not making it clear that all further coments
should be made privately.  Sorry ;)

I thought that this was very strong though Chris! (And not in a good way)

All the best...

Bill Gates is a "star" in business circles really.  He hasn't written
any code for about fifteen years.  Microsoft is phenomenally
successful because of Big Bill's business acumen, not his coding
ability (or lack of it - it's been said that he was never that hot a
coder, although that might just be sour grapes).

Linus Torvalds I agree with you on.  Eric S. Raymond and Richard
Stallman could be considered "stars" for the same reason.  Shame
that J. Random Loser has never heard of these people.

> And the big guy at the top of the pyramid gets all the money anyway.

It sucks, doesn't it :-S  Be careful who you complain to though,
or people will call you a "communist" (even though most people don't
even know what that really means) and won't take you seriously.

> 3. Who hasn't heard of Martin Galway and Rob Hubbard? Those were the days.

And Allister Brimble and Bjorn Lynne, both of whom now record audio CDs
in addition to their computer projects.

I personally get more satisfaction from distributing software for
free, and people emailing me and saying "I like your free software".

I code for money because I need to eat and put a roof over my head.
Money on its own is a poor motivator for me.  Someone taking the
trouble to tell me I did a good job gives me much more of a buzz.

What's the difference between me and a prostitute?  She sells her
body.  I sell my brain.  Not that much difference when you think
about it.  Capitalism sucks.  Money sucks.

I know they are either down or just too busy.  The only reliable one I have
found is here.is which as you can see is what I use.

I've got one these too, http://surf.to/magnum-opus but I've never botherd
to promote is as like you I've found it to be extremely unreliable. I much
prefer to use its full URL as prestel have been *very* reliable.

Hmmmmm, Not tried this one, I'll have to take a look sometime.

Well Your wrong here Chirs, As I looked up the subdomian name
of macd0nalds.com did not exist, therefore it was no a true subdomain
name of macd0nlads.com, i know about this as i've got a Zonefile
DNS subdomain thing for amigacentral check out sex.amigacentral.com :)
You'll see what i mean. Or even warez.amigacentral.com :) And by
telnetspoofing i mean connecting on port 23 (telnet) with a fak or spoffed
host, not telnetting into a box and then spoofing from there.

Hmm, Okay, but i think this is wrong agian as i pinged the host as i said
and it did not resolve or exist's, any how i knew some 1 on IRC who had
200 VHost's, for what ever reason he'd want then for :)

Naw i know all this stuff in this mail, just did not over complicate
things.

Really ? I never knew that :)

Nor that :) (BTW You can turn IDENT off, and IRCNET does not check, along
with a few other's)

Eheh :) Do you want them spoofing EXE's or not i have got them, nd they
probally work but i can't find a cache or begin host. And Chris, When some
1 is trying to help you it's good pratice to be nice to them and just say
there wrong to embarress them and make your head even bigger. 

PS. You can't slag my spelling off as i admit i am dislexic ! So there :)

Hello,

I'm going to get my self a CD-R(W) and i'm wondering what is the best CD
creation tool on the amiga (like MakeCD) and were can i find a list
of what it is compatiable with. Also woudl any one suggest a good CD-R
for around 150 ? I saw a CD-RW (that's CD rewtire i'm not shure of the
initails) In a computer shop were my nan lives that was 2x2x6 for 149.99
is that any good ? (I think it was a creative labs one).

Yours

Hello everybody!
I have some questions here I`ve been worrying about for quite some time now.
Any help`s welcome!

1. Where can I get `RAplay`? Aminet search didn`t produce anything real.

2. I`m using Wordworth (v7) and MUI and YAM and STfax and DOpus (v5.62) and
bla+blubb: Now when Opus runs and I try to start WW, WW will perfectly hang
and crash the sys. The other way round, ie. first WW, then Opus, works
fine.
If WW runs and I start STfax (uniconified), I get a crash in 85% of the
times. Doing it the other way round is even worse. Having YAM open and also
WW, starting STfax won`t produce probs in *most* of the cases.
Any idea to fix this behavior?

3. I got the latest Version of MagicMenu (v2.25), but i can`t config it. As
it is a commodity, popping it up won`t work with me (expect that it
accesses HD a bit).

4. Does anyone know of a programme that saves urls to disk and that works?
Saving complete sites (with pictures and links) would be nice. HTTPResume
with etAllHTML.rexx has no effect.
Is it possible to ftp www.pages with a ftp-client?

5. Im looking for a web-service that sends SMS-messages to cellular phones
(especially in Germany) and that does it for free ;) (I`m convinced there`s
such a miracle...)

Regardz, uLpf

Don't use MUI !

Sorry but thats a common problem. I'll be cranking along with aweb, YAM will 
be sitting in the background, then kick into gear to pick up mail and 
crash...

animated or big GIF pix in aweb cause the crashing also. And I've heard even 
more aiming their fingers at MUI.

Might be some sort of conflict with MUI and Classact..

        Sorry to butt in guys, but I use IBrowse (demo) & YAM2, sometimes when
Yam fetches mail it crashes & for no apparent reason. I haven't really taken
much notice over this debate about MUI & Classact until I noticed the post
above. BTW, even IBrowse crashes for no apparent reason. Is it MUI causing
these crashes then? I tried using Aweb & Voyager but I thought they were a
bit slow so I'll stick with IBrowse for now (& put up with the odd crash ;-)

Subject: [just-amiga] Docs for Vector Accelerator?
X-UIDL: 079c1610808c34923591fdb0bd1cf4f6
Status: U

From: Bob Washburne <rcwash@concentric.net>

Greetings!

A While back I bought a "Vector Accellerator" 68020 card for my A2000
at a flea market.  The price was right, but it did not come with any
docs.

There are many, many jumpers on this card all cleverly labled JP1, JP2,
etc.  The card has many features, such as SCSI adaptor.  Needless to
say, the machine won't boot when I plug it in.

I suspect that the card would work, if only I had the docs to properly
set all the jumpers.  And the company is long out of business.

So...would anyone out there happen to have or know where I could find
the docs to this card?  I am willing to pay good money for photocopying
and postage.

Thanks for any help,

Bob Washburne

I think it's the Amigas.. I'm sure they're running one program or another and 
then crash. Or maybe just quitting a program, who knows why or for that matter

what program is running the Amigas are prone to crashing..

Funny but I can't recall my Timex 1000 ever doing all this crashing..
I do know the 64 and 128 both had to be reset often but those for just 
locking, which isn't far removed from a guru.

As long as I have nothing running or touching any keys the amiga runs.. Big 
deal, highly unproductive.

Fire up ANY program and odds are favorable there's going to be a crash. It all

seems to be just a matter of whats happening when the crash occurs.

I'd guess it has more to do with timing and the amigas special design.

How long can you rub your stomach, hop on one foot and whistle before crashing

? Thats how I see the amigas multitasking. Something has to give eventually 
ie:try to pat your stomach vs rub it and crash.

I'd guess since running snoopdos with enforcer invariably stops my crashing 
entirely. It is a timing problem as snoopdos and enforcer both make everything

come to a crawl so these programs can check whats happening. before letting it

happen.

Having executive running to a degree could minimize crashing almost as well as

the combo of snoopdos and enforcer.

I was asked to find the GIF problem so added all those program monitors (and a

watched pot never boils) and couldn't get a crash to happen no matter how 
overloaded I made things.

There must have been 12-15 items running with all those extras turned on, but 
snoopdos and enforcer just wouldn't allow the amiga to trip on itself. Without

these on, I could usually just be scanning a page, or scrolling a page and 
watch it crash.

If you can live with a slower machine this combo of enforcer and snoopdos can 
almost eliminate your crashes.

Eventually I did get a crash. It was always while loading an animated GIF 
into aweb.

It's not aweb specific. I also had the same crashes with voyager and animated 
gifs.

Which makes me think the gif datatypes aren't up to par..

But then what with all the different PC formats of GIF and JPG, guess it's 
lucky the amiga can run these files at all without crashing..

What you need is TCPDL available from www.ramjam.u-net.com

It will do exactly what you want.

Don't know if this will help but there is a DMS'ed install disk listed
for the IVSVector A2000 accelerator at this URL:

http://www.L8R.net/install/accel.html

Maybe the docs are on the disk.

You can't seriously compare C64's and Amiga's :). Amiga's are more complex
with multitasking, library's, devices and many programs that could crash
if one of them has a bug.

Are you sure you aren't talking about a pc??

The only serious bug I've encountered on my Amiga is when I play
a MOD with Hippoplayer and scroll a guide in Multiview.
(on which the computer locks up)

Why would the design of the Amiga crash it? Because it would be
too hard to program it and that way invites bugs to come??
Than that software just isn't tested good enough.

I went and got the Buddha and an IBM 10gig. That ran maybe 2 weeks.
Master / slave meant zip..

Stuck it on the 386 PC, PC uses 8 of the 10 gigs. Even it can't handle that 
much drive.

So took the 2.1 gig from the PC, again master / slave on this WD 2.1 gig mean 
zip to HDtools. This one also still appears as unit 0.

So whats the argument. Course this all may mean nothing as I haven't found 
anyone even using the Buddha on an a3k. It may work completely different on 
an a1200 or a4k.

Yes I miss all those Amiga mode/screen viewers too.

Visage, CyberView/Show, V, MysticView, Superview, work on multiple image 
formats some with more features than others. I suspect visage would be a 
the top of most peoples charts for all round viewers and datatype 
viewers the least liked.

Hello,

Since I added the graphics board to my system and switched to a different
driver for workbench (instead of the hi-res I had been using) the picture
viewer FastView no longer works.  The message given is failed to open
screen.  Does anyone know if this utility should work with the graphics
board - maybe an option I'm not aware of?  If not, what is a good viewer to
use?  I have tried a few others but they are either too slow for my taste
or are specific to one file type (jpg, iff, etc.).

Where did you get that? The latest on the AlienDesign HP is 1.32 beta12,

Hi,
   Does anybody know what has happened to SoftLogik Publishing. The Web site
is no longer active and the mail lists stopped on March 11th 1999. I know
they were moving but did not think this involved shutting down. 

Kind regards

A bit of background here. Amiga printing works in one of two ways - Text and
graphics. Textra (and Ced GoldEd etc.) just send the ASCII codes of the text
to the printer and the printer uses its own internal fonts. This is quite
basic and would probably work with any printer driver.

Graphics on the other hand are quite different...

All classic signs of using the wrong printer driver or DIP Switch settings..
Your printer driver has sent a command to the printer to tell it that a
graphics dump is coming, but the printer hasn't understood it. Hence blank
pages/strange strings, as graphics bitmaps get printed as ASCII characters.

I've looked up in my ROM Kernel Ref manual under printers and here is what
EpsonXold says:

density         XDPI        YDPI        comments

[....]
5               120          72     For use on old star printers
6               240          72     For use on old star printers

Note: denity 6 cannot print adjacent horizontal dots. Use for B&W shaded
dumps only.

So try EpsonXold - Density 5 from your graphics util. 
And see if that has any effect.

There is probably a printer driver for this printer somewhere out there!
Aminet is always worth a check. Good luck!

I saw most of those on Aminet but had no way of telling which was which
without going throught them all.  You saved me a lot of time.  Visage works

Take some time also for me to find it, because it's strangely hidden on the
Aliendesign server.
The URL is http://www.aliendesign.net/MCPAlpha/
Also on onelist you can find the MCPList: a mailing list with a low, low,
low traffic (average: less than one message per day! :) ).
You can tell to the author, Michael Knoke, if there are problems with MCP.
He is really helpful!

PS: the new MCP 1.33 alpha 22 is near! :)

The last contact I got was from the mailing list, in which Deron said he
expected things to take a couple of weeks, give or take.

I can cope with that :)

Any interesting feature additions since 1.32 beta?

Subject: [just-amiga] Typing Tutors?
X-UIDL: 4db48aa50378d24e45e4fbad9594168f

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi, My Mum has just started on a beginners course to computers, as she
is a TOTAL beginner, ie. basically doesn't know how to turn the computer
on I am looking for some typing tutors that may help her. At collage they
have to use Peecees so its best if you have ones that stay away from
Amiga specific keys like the 'Amiga' key, doh! :) If anyone has a PC
guide for the Amiga that is easy to use and understand that would
be great but i doubt these exists ;)

So if you have any EASY typing tutors that record times etc or maybe
able to help her, i'd be most grateful, just email me personally if you
can help.

Yes, I know there are plenty on the Aminet but can anyone suggest
a good one?

Toodle Pip!

(much better - supports multiple connections and parses the html to point to

I have Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing For the Amiga.
It was a commercial program, but as it is not sold anymore, it is open
to question whether or not if I sent it to you - it would be pirating.

It is a decent program - I still use it for typing practice - but for 
some reason can not be installed on my hard drive but must be booted from 
disc.

If it is kosher, I'll send it to you.

Hildey

I thought HTMLView.mcc was pretty good too, but it timed out. I updated 
and the update crashes out everytime. Hopefully Iprobe is on the right track.

Sorry about sending this to everyone on the list but I can't remember
exactly who is displaying our banner on their web page. Anyway
if you are displaying it please change the banner to this new one and
change the HTML code to http://www.aio.co.uk

For those of you who are addicted web surfers you will notice that
www.aio.co.uk exists and the site will go online next weekend.

Toodle Pip!

Yeah... probably. :)

I hope so! :)
I remember some time ago when Pure Amiga ML reached the number of around
170-180 messages per day!

The MCPPrefs are divided in functions and patches.
There's a special MCP commodity that uses only the functions section of
the preferences: probably if you have great problems with the patches,
I think.
I'm looking the MCPPrefs, and some new features are:
- SwapJoyMousePort;
- enhanced Snap;
- enhanced ScreenManager;
- new events for the Hotkeys;
- enhanced AssignPrefs;
- ecc...

What do you think of SFS 1.61?

Subject: [just-amiga] What is DMS format?
X-UIDL: a4035d1473f249d4c2b1490a230961d4

From: RCWASH <Rcwash@concentric.net>

Greetings!

I've surfed around a few Amiga web sites and I keep seeing refferences to 
floppies in "DMS format".  I'm assuming that this is some sort of file
image of 
a floppy disk.

So, once I download one of these DMS files, how do I turn it back into a
floppy?

What software should I be looking for to create/munge DMS files?

Thanks for the help.

munge v. Technical term somewhere between the Unix concept of filtering
and the 
verb form of FUBAR.

Hello Andrew

Well, I thought of a small-tiny-micro-browser that doesn`t eat your HD, Ram
and time to start up. In fact, IBrowse (as well as AWeb, VNG) is far to
huge and lazy to deal with if you just want to have a look at a HTML-page.

Sounds great! Thanks. I`ll give it a lovely try. (the problem is my

Aminet has the solution (i think).

Tree to find it:
util/arc/dms111.run

or just search on aminet for dms111.run.

Hopefully this file contains a helpful doc for you to read so that you can
unpack those archives of yours.

X-UIDL: 021f9c51bd240361862097eaaca525e7

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

Hi y'all,

On one of my 1200's it came with an external 3.5" 100mb HD (don't ask!
it was 2nd hand, who knows?!) which is IDE. I've recently bought a
new HD for it (810mb) from Power (Just 69.99) anyway I am trying to
get both HD's to be recognised when one is used to boot up the
computer and use all the preferences, better as the 100MB one if
possible and then new one which is also IDE but is external as one
to store everything but be shown aswell as the 100mb on the WB
any ideas how to acheive this would be welcome, TIA!

Toodle Pip!

Here's part of the page from my Magnum.Opus.Guide that should help explain
it a bit more.

DISK-Masher (DMS) is a utility that lets you compress an entire floppy disk
or selective tracks to a single file while preserving the disk-structure.
This is useful for archiving non-filing system disks that can not be done
with standard file archivers. DISK-Masher offers varying modes of
compression from simple to very deep. Do not rely on the bootblock virus
checker within DISK-Masher as many new viruses have appeared since its
release in 1991.

The Command Line Version 1.11 TURBO GENERIC was the last official release
which can be found on the Aminet (dms111.run util/arc CD14). All newer
versions, 1.51 and above contain pirated code and are best avoided. 

Thankfully at last the use of Disk-Masher files for distribution is rapidly
decreasing for several reasons, the main one being that Aminet no longer
accepts them. For a better idea of why this has been done take a look at
the file "dms_sucks.txt" written by Aminet administrator Urban Mueller
(dms_sucks.txt docs/misc CD11).

Hi!

> floppy?
> What software should I be looking for to create/munge DMS files?

A DMS file is basically an archived, single file, image of a floppy
disk. The advantage of using DMS to the more popular file archivers
(e.g. LhA, LZX, ZIP) is that it retains the disk structure (i.e.
bootblock, snapshotted icons, etc) and is the only real way to archive a
disk using a non-standard file system. DMS isn`t used as much as it used
to be these days though as most software is designed to be installed and
run off hard drives.... making disks pretty redundant.

To unpack a .DMS archive you need a copy of the DMS executable which is
a shell command, or you could look for DMS_WIN which is a GUI version
for Workbench (much easier to use!). If you do a search on Aminet
(ftp.uk.aminet.org) for "DMS" it should come up with what you need
otherwise if you e-mail me privately I would be happy to send you a copy
of the DMS program.... Don`t worry, it`s freeware so it`s not piracy!

Hope that helps ya out!

C yA!

Alan

Well like you said, that is the raw format. Mail reader which support MIMe
will know to ignore it, but any non-mime reader will display everything (as
in show raw format)

don't worry, YAm does support mime

From: Chris Seward <amiga@thefree.net>

For Immediate Release: 24.4.99

Amiga Information Online has now moved its web site to a registered web
domain in the UK. You can find this new site by visiting www.aio.co.uk

The old site (www.amiga1.demon.co.uk/aio) will act as a forwarding
service to people who have the old address.

I hope you all try this new site and see the speed improvements it
brings. It is now also alot easier to remember and will of course attract
alot more readers.

The latest issue has just been released today (24.4.99) and is already
online for downloading. Our last issue featured an interview with
Petro Tyschtschenko which was very successful and is still online to
be read. You can download the latest issue (issue 23) from our site
by following the links online.

Now that we have a proper website the site will be used to let the
readers get more involved with the site instead of just using it as
the latest issue downloading point. Some of the new features online
include ALL the interviews to ever feature in AIO, all the latest
readers letters we receive online, a global Amiga survey soon to be
launched plus lots lots more like lists of all the product reviews
we have done with issues numbers and scores to make it easier to find
the issue with a review of something you want to know about.

I would like to thank some people who without, this registered site would
not be possible and people who have helped in the process of getting to
this stage. Firstly I'd like to thank all the editorial team of AIO, past
and present who have helped me bring a publication to many readers all
over the world. I would like to thank Chris Brown for hosting the current
site, even though he did slow on updates a bit to the end and also to 
Andrew Crowe who created the web site which I have hacked to bits and
added various areas. I would like to thank Conor Kerr who will be getting
the registered domain for me and the work he has done to bring it to
life.
Last but not least I would like to give great thanks to the people who
believed in AIO enough to donate which without again we would not be
seeing the domain today, these great people are, Malcolm Harnden, Ian
Urie, Stuart Walker, Andrew Cashmore, Paul Steadman, Gerald Hobbs and
Raynald Le Moing.
