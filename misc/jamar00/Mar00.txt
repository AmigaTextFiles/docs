Hi There,

AmIBench is going through a complete rewrite (No really, Honest), and
We`re looking at updating the Dealer Directory.

If possible could everyone on the J-A list please visit AmiBench and see
if their local dealer is listed, and if not, please add them to the
database.

Check http://www.amibench.org/cgi-bin/storeselect.pl?type=stores for the
listings of Dealers by country.

AmiBench is as committed now as its ever been to create the best Dealer
Directory in the world, So, please help us, to help you and your fellow
community members.

Thank you.

The saga continues,
It seems that if I have Full Screen RTG selected I get Picasso Support
If not I get all the familar screen modes.  Is this right or is there
somethig else mysterius going on?

Got given a HP deskjet 660c yesterday, It sounds like It eats paper
rarther than prints any Ideas on HP drivers for it on the amiga side
of things?  Went the HP web site for the windoz drivers installed them
now when I print I get a message about faulty insterlation try
replaceing the colour cartrige but apart from that it seems to print
OK

100% improvemt on yesterday as I Did`t have a printer of any shape
description or form.

Now that I`ve set my old a1200 up and borrowd a SCSI squriel PCIMA
thingy (1xCD drive 210meg HD attached) what are the options of
joining the 2 together?

Incidentally, if anyone has a program to extract the roms into a file so I
can use it with WinUAE, i would be most grateful. Is it breaking the law if
you rip the roms from your own computer? I dont fancy looking on a warez
site for them.

Full screen or not it shouldn't matter, all modes you have configured should
be available.  The only problem with windowed mode is that the Amiga screen
must be the same depth as the Windows desktop.

Do a search for TurboPrint.  It's available from Eyetech in the UK.

Ethernet, with Samba etc.
Parnet, sernet

Actually, it depends on what you want to connect them together for.  Internet,
file sharing?

flashing capslock means there's a fault, usually a short or loose ground. 
One trick I was taught was to disconnect the keyboard, then take a small
screwdriver and touch it to each of the pins at the end of the Keyboard
connector (the one hanging from the keytboard, NOT the computer end), one
at a time each in turn.  This will release any pent up charge in the
keyboard.  When finished then plkug it bakc in and try again.

If the capslock is still flashing it could mean a charge buiuldup someplace
in the computer and you'll have to start unplugging components to let them
discharge (no poking screwdriver this time).

As for what could cause the charge buildup you could have a bad or faulty
keyboard, maybe a loose connection or something.

I learned the above from some rather dreadful personal experience, so it's
worth a shot. :)

Jeez,    what an absolute load of  raving drivvel.....

"/pent up charges"  &  "charge buildup"/  &
/"unplugging components to let then discharge"/

It's not a van de graph generator, it's a plipping keyboard.

I was relaying to you advice given me by an AMIGA REPAIR MAN THAT OWNS A
SHOP when I had the exact same problem and it solved said problem.  Take
the advice or not, but don't insult me.

And keyboards can build up charge just like ANYTHING ELECTRICAL, so keep
your Van der Graph Generator (note correct spelloing of "der") comparisons
to yourself.

As far as "stupid and dangerous" I DID say don't use poke around inside the
computer, just unplug things for a while; TOUCHING (and nothing more) the
screwdriver (or anything metal) to the plug applies ONLY to the plug at the
end of the Keyboard (that dangly thing that hangs off the wide long thing
with the keys you pressed to compose your "letter") to discharge anything
there (and charge DOES build up in things... a lot of things can act like a
capacitor under the right circumstances).

And if it's just a "plipping keyboard" then how come you're having so much
trouble getting it to work.  You asked for help, I tried to give some.

A mistake I'm sure I won't repeat again.

From: Jim & Penny McFarland <mcfarlnd@centurytel.net>

Hello Cosmicfrog:

I have been using an HP660 for some time now.  I use TurboPrint 6.1 and get
excellent results.  There are some additional software utilities for HP
printers in this package as well.  Most of the generic HP Deskjet drivers
will also work fine and earlier ones such as for the HP550 - at least for
B&W (can't recall if I tried those with color).  I think there is also a PD
driver now for the 660 on Aminet.  One thing about this printer.  It is
subject to smearing very easily if dust or paper fiber collects on the
cartridge transport surfaces.  Regular cleanings with alcohol solve the
problem.  Also ink flow seems to be critical - I find on TurboPrint, the
difference in paper settings betweeen regular and inkjet paper make a
significant difference in results.  As far as I can tell the change is a
minor adjustment in ink density.  HP printers aren't bad - I've owned
several and the strong points are the dependable paper feed and durability.
Find a driver that works for you and keep it clean and you should be very
happy with it.

Okay, just found my old file that translates those blinking codes into real
language.  So, here it is:

One Blink:    Keyboard ROM check failed
Two Blinks:   Keyboard RAM checked failed
Three Blinks: Watch dog timer failed
Four Blinks:  A short between two row lines or special control keys

See if that helps

Thanks for the Info, You mention the alcohol now i now it begins with
an I but thats as far as it gose, canany body tell me what it is
called let alone spell it!  Its the cleaner solvent come do all of
the electrical cleaning world and I still cant remember its name.

yep 300x300 dpi is great for Black and white but colour is a bit to
grainy needs to be twice the res for decient photo work, heh but who
am I to complian I`ve got some great pic`s of my daughter out of it
and its cost me nothing in ink.  I`ll look into the drivers for the
amiga in the future and let you know how I get on.

Erm, wtf is the watchdog timer? And what are the keyboard rom and ram. Is
the rom where all the character codes are kept and the ram a buffer for
typed characters. Ive never had this type of problem so I dont know about
it.

Hello just-amiga@onelist.com

I get this list in digest form.  I use YAM 2.0 and notice that when I want
to respond, only about half the digest is quoted back.  I suspected a
limitation on size of message that is buffered, but what is curious is that
this seems to happen on relatively short digests as well.  I have hunted
through all the settings and can find no place to adjust this.  Since YAM is
widely used, I assume others have already encountered this problem and
the solution may be well known -- but it sure eludes me.  Can anyone help?

Hello!
well im having these problem that i dont seem to be able to fix..so anybody
who suffered the same or knows what could i do to fix it let me know
please!!! :
i bought an original amiga 4000 keyboard to use it on my Power Tower 1200,
because i wanted to have an amiga keyboard instead of a pc one.
The fact is that when i plugged it, and booted my machine, the caps lock
light flashed for a couple of seconds during booting...then nothing happens,
the keyboard wouldnt work. I dont know what could be wrong. I tested the
keyboard in my friends 4000 and it works prerfect. In my machine i also have
a Blizzard board and scsi, and the Power Flyer, and roms 3.1
Any ideas of what to do in order to make it working??
I will really appreciatte any comments/suggestions/ideas

Kind Regards
Sebastian

Consulting the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual doesn't give a clear answer
but it seems that the keyboard it self is a kind of minicomputer with rom
and a ram for buffering typed characters.
The watchdog timer, I guess, checks the keyboards internal clock.
Maybe someone can correct me if I'm completly wrong here.

Some notes on the blinks thou. It should blink one time at startup showing
that the
startup-test was completed without errors.
If there's a fault those blinks will be repeated in bursts once every second
or so.

hi, 
        i had problems with an A2000 keyboard when i plugged it into my
A1200 keyboard adapter, this adapter was a plcc type socket which 
plugged onto the CIA chip (the small square package next to the original 
keyboard slot) this connected the power and serial connections of the 
keyboard directly to the chip. it appeared to be a  dead keyboard until i 
cut the two tracks on the underside of the motherboardwhich connected 
the keyboard MPU and the CIA. i am typing on this keyboard now. Before 
anyone jumps in and slams this advice. i believe that the MPU was overriding

weaker signals from an older keyboard. And the keyboard now works  
I am an Electronics Engineer with 15 years experience and I do not 
reccomend this remedy if you cannot locate without absolute certainty the 
two tracks. the keyboard MPU is another small square package at the other 
end of the keyboard  ribbon slot It has keyboard MPU written on it as well. 
the tracks pass through the board and travel  across the back. this is where
i cut them to make repair easier if this proved neccesary, fortunately, they
are still separated and the MPU is talking to itself now.

If you are going to do this USE A MULTI-METER to test the connection and
just use the tip of a scalpel. pressing down with a slight rocking action.
do not
 drag the blade across the track as this may peel the track away.

IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH TRACKS TO CUT.  DO NOT CUT ANY

It worked for me and hope it helps you

or............

on the subject of discharging your keyboard I say that this is wrong. but
you could stand on a hill in a thunderstorm waving the keyboard in the air
and charge it up again. BIG TIME!   ;)  it is important to ensure that the 
amiga is not connected at this juncture because then you dont have to lug 
it all the way up the hill 8).

To be hones, the best place I'd think is looking on amiga emulation sites, try web searching for 'Amiga ADF' or 'Amiga Roms' or sommin

Dear All,

Oh no! me again with more Digital Camera questions ;)

Sorry to keep bothering everyone but does anyone have
or ever used the Kodak DC215 Digital Camera? The
cheapest i've seen it advertised is £250.00 from PC
World. Anyone know anything about it?

Also, any Amiga software that will support it?

Toodle Pip!

I bought one of the SCSI ram card readers and am presently using it with a 32
meg SmartCard as a partition for my A4000. I am planning on getting one of the
digital cameras and supposedly the cards can be read and pics downloaded to
HD. 
There is a file on AmiNet called SCSI_PCMCIA.lha that describes the
necessities. Finding the SCSI reader is not all that easy as most other
platforms are now using USB. Maybe that will make the prices come down for the
SCSI readers. Gotta have the adapter(s) also.

Regards

Look at http://www.mayn.de/home/cow/dc240wizard/index.html

According to my humble lil Amiga page:

DC240Wizard (supports Kodak DC240, should support 
DC240i/DC280/DC210/DC210+/DC200/DC200+/*DC215*, NO support for 
DC120/DC260/DC290) freeware

There may be support for this cam in some other Amiga packages, but I
haven't looked into cameras supported by each package for a few monthes.
CamControl a commrcial package /might/ have support by now, but I don't know

Good news, I own one of these I bought it a few weeks ago, very nice too.
Almost everyone seems to be doing it at about this price. When I get around
to it I'll be making a web page all about it. But don't hold your breath I've
got a heap of other more important web related stuff to do before this.

> Also, any Amiga software that will support it?

I use the DC210wizard.lha from Aminet, nothing special but it allows you to
get the pictures from the camera onto your hard drive. I tried the
dc240wizard but couldn't get it to work.

I have an A4000T with a dead clock battery.  Is it rechargable?  The machine
spends days switched on but the time is still resetting to 1978 on power
downs.  Anyway, are there any issues I should know about when trying to get a
new battery?

It is a 3,6v nica accumolator like those used in old PC's, just cut of the old
one and solder 2 small wires
on the remanes of the old battery in that way you don't wreck anything on your
mainboard..Flemming Hansen Denmark

The A4000T  (REAL Tower)   uses a 3 volt lithium button cell.
Non-rechargable....   
I believe it is a  CR2032  type.

No it's not !!!!     Not unless he put a desktop 4000 in a tower case.
Original A4000T's  use a lithium button cell...

Greetings All...

Does anyone know the latest email address for "MJSoft" the authors of
a neat little print formating util (Columns v2.6) by Martin Mares and
Tomas  Zikmund  - or even an up email address for either of the above
gents?

I sent an email to this address listed in the dox...

            mjsoft@k332.feld.cvut.cz

but it was returned as "unable to find this email address".

I  realise  they  may have given up supporting the Amiga, but I can't
help thinking I've seen the name "MJSoft" on stuff recently.

I hope someone can help.

Cop 'U Later... Tiny

Thanks for the heads up.  I found this through a news site link and we have
stated including them on our user group monthly hand out disk for the
benefit for those who don't have time or ability to keep up with all the Amiga news via
the net.  Good job!

Hello, all.

I was wondering if anyone knows how to figure out the kilohertz on a monitor
(without checking the instruction book... I didn't get any when I bought
it) is there  any program I don't know about to do that, or...?

Or, perhaps anyone of you would happen to know what Khz I have, my monitor
is a
17" Goldstar Studioworks 74m


Kind regards

Did anyone notice the Articles/Executive Update 1 and 2 parts of a
three part article fail to load in the AIO gui, despite the scroller
showing they did? This happened a couple of issues ago with another
multi-part item. fe7 and fe8 were the affected parts this time.

I only found the UK and US sites were affected for a few hours.
But some thing has happened to these sites as my fastlink button
in iBrowse I've setup for "Recent Files" now only shows about 40
files, whereas before the German site probs there was a couple of
hundred. And, no, as someone else suggested, I've not altered the
path in the button for months, and I do have the correct URL's.

Works fine here.  I just rechecked every link to make sure.  Maybe your
archive got corrupted or downloaded incomplete; if so, then the archive
would have missed a few files.  Try re-downloading.

Refresh rates are measured in hertz, not kilohertz. If you had a monitor
that could do a refresh rate that high, Id snap your hand off so fast to buy
it off you. It will probably be around 60-80, but im not sure of the exact
figure.

Not sure if a program can do it, but Id like one if there is one. Anyone?

This is actually because there wasn't a large enough chunk of chip mem
available to create those pages on your machine.

There are several ways in which we can get around this:

1. present articles in 2 colours:

Good - the amount of memory required is reduced.
Bad - black&white images.

2. similar to scene disk mags, present articles on pages.  You'd get enought
text to fill one window, then to read the next page you'd have to 'turn the
page.'

Good - You need only enough memory at any one moment to draw one window-full
of text.
Bad - You lose the current browser-like scrolling.

3. Dynamically draw the page on screen.  Effectively, only the one window-full
of text exists at a time; when you scroll, the new text is generated as
needed.

Good - Keep the browser-like scrolling, multicolour images, and use little
memory.
Bad - Could be slower, and will probably need a fair a bit of programming to
achieve.

Subject: [just-amiga] big hard disk partitions
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

From: "Raziel 1" <raziel_75@hotmail.com>

Hi

Has anyone ever had problems with big hard disk partitions (2gb+), while
using PFS3 and Dopus Magellan?

Everything seems to work well, until I made a 7gb partition to hold my
mp3s. Magellan reports the partition as being -1487890k in size
(although it says 3gb in the titlebar). When I copy past 3gb on
this partition, the counter resets itself from being 0, back to 4gb. I
wouldnt be bothered about this measurement glitch, but its more
than that..

After writing past 3gb, the next partition on the drive becomes
NDOS. :(

I know amigas used to have problems with 2gb+ partitions, but i'm
using PFS3 and Os3.5, which i thought had workarounds for those
problems (the Docs mention a 104gb partition limit). Am i wrong, or am
i missing something out?

Later

Raziel

Actually, it was sent automatically via email. I've read the 2 files
in a text editor as I was trying to find out what was wrong. 

The earlier one was downloaded from Aminet, and when I got it direct
from AIO it worked OK. Comparing the faulty one from ANet and the 
one from AIO index and the faulty file, I could find no diference in
size or links or layout. I decided the archive got corrupted tho
it was exactly the same size and unpacked with no error.

Regards... Tony

Use the internet dude, i just dropped into altavista and entered the name
and it popped up 633 hits. try it 8)

anyway here are the specs

17" ( 15.7 effective) screen
0.39 dot pitch
30 - 50 KHz horizontal scan (automatic)
50 - 110 Hz refresh (automatic)
and a lot of other stuff like weight and dimensions etc.

try    
           www.lgelectronicsitalia.com/news/cs-74m.htm

its all in italian but if you can find this page in altavista you can
translate it

hope this helps

That is because new files are not being distributed amongst the mirrors so
no new files are in the Recent list. It will resume once the main site is
back to working.

In Dopus 4.11 a 2.5 GB partion is showed as "0kB". It seems to
be a quite old bug.

Something similar happened to me. I partioned my 4.3GB HD
into 0.3, 1.5 and 2.5 GB. Formatting the first two with "pfsformat"
was no problem but it refused to format the last one. Using the
wb format command seem to have worked but after reboot I
discovered that it had destroyed the RDB.
The 4GB wall is still there...

I'm as puzzled as you. I'm using OS3.1 and PFS3 (v 5.3). I've tried
with PFS standard and PFS direct scsi but no luck so far.

Can anyone help us?

I recently got a new 9.1GB hard drive, and thereafter spent about amonth
getting the darned thing formatted- and staying that way.  Trying to format
a couple of partitions as IBM and Mac for the emulators didn't help much. 
I encountered every way possible of busting up a RDB file, overwriting
partitions, watching them flake out between boots, and everything else
imagineable.  Anyway, I came up with the following conclusions...
  1) don't use DiskCache option in formating or partitioning.  New hard
Drives have on-board cahce which DOES clash (big time!).  Likewise if your
file system has anything similar.  Turn off any directory cachoing options
(new had drives are fast enough to not need them anyway).

  2) if you have the "filesystem" option turned off in the Setpatch (which I
do, sine the new filesystem is buggy to the point of not recognising old
FFS disks) then keep partition sizes to about 3GB.

  3) pick one  version of HDFormat (the new version with the OS iupdate is
preferable) and stick with it.

  4) PCtask knows spit about how to format any partition of excessively
large size (fdisk on he PC side will keep reading less than half or worse
of the actual partition size).

Hope any of this blather helps.

Yes, this is a Magellan problem - nothing to do with PFS3. In fact
I believe there are also problems with all but the latest version
of Magellan and OS3.5, so if you haven't already got the latest
version I'd recommend you get it.

The pre-OS3.5 Format command works modulo 4GB - so if you pass that
point it can wrap around and overwite other partitions or the RDB.
If you use the WB Format command *ALWAYS* use the QUICK option.
Not only does it work for partitions above 4GB, it works just as well
as a full format, and is *much* faster.

With pfsformat - in what way did it "refuse" to format the last partition?
Did it format it, but that partition then not appear on the WB?

If so, I have come across that problem on one other system. The simple
work-around is to do a "diskchange" on that partition. It then appears
on the WB and is usable. Basically, the automount fails, but the RDB
info for the partition is available so it is mounted by the diskchange.
You can add a line to your s:user-startup file to do this.

I'm not sure what the reason for this problem is - I've only seen it
on a system which uses Magellan as a WB replacement.

Have you contacted the retailer where you bought PFS3 from? You've
paid for support, you may as well use it. Alternatively, if you
still have problems, let me know more details of your config and
I'll see what I can do.

I thought so. All partitions are now "QUICK" formatted and the RDB intact.

It just said it couldn't format the partition and quitted. Didn't do
anything.

Diskchange??! That was a long-shot, but I'll give it a try.

I have a 20.4GB partition, and it's working (using SFS tho, FFS on boot:)..

No partition is larger than 4GB (not even 4GB, max is like 3.8 to be
sure)...

This works very well for me! (The only problem is that I get alot of
partitions, but that's a nice thing too!.)

Of course he did, I knew that... I was just testing, yeah, thats right! No
seriously, sorry to confuse you, I thought you meant the refresh rate. The
scan rate is measured in kilohertz though (I think, after making one gaff
already, Id rather not stick my neck out and make another)

This would work only if the partition was formatted, but still didn't
appear on the WB - I don't think it's relevant for you from what you've
just told me.

OK, your problem is just pfsformat not liking your last partition then?
Am I correct in thinking everything is OK now that you've used the
WB Format with the quick option?

OK,  but  every  time Germany has gone down b4 my recent filelist has
never diminished in size. My take on the matter is that the list just
gets bigger as new files are uploaded and added to the list.

The  only  way  I  can  find to eventually make the recent files list
smaller  is to go to the frontend of Aminet and click the Recent link
again,  I'm  not  sure,  but I think this will start the listing with
only the last seven days files, and, then slowly re-build the list as
new files are upped to ANet.

Regards... Tony

Marion, please read the above again. If my recent list was showing a
couple of hundred files, why would it diminish in size just because
Germany is off line, surely it would stay the same until Germany
gets back up and then start adding files to my recent list?

This is what's occured b4 when Germany has been off-line.

See above.

In that case, no.

Almost. Since the HD is conneced to an Ultra-ATA'99
IDE-interface, I used the ATA.device to split the HDs at the 4GB limit
into two drives. Therefore I now got 0.3+1.5+2.5 GB and a 27MB partition.
The last 27MB as a result of the split. Now, pfsformat will format all
partitions,
but if I format the 2.5 GB partition the 27MB disappear. Probably
overwriting
the RDB for that one. Using quick option is the only way, it seems.

Despite that my biggest problem at the moment is that I'm loosing 2 bytes
at every 8KB when copying files to the new HD. Smaller than 8KB = no prob.
I've tried with very low max transfers (0x1fe00) but that didn't help. 
The controller should be able to handle up to 16.6 MB/s according
to the manual. The drives (2x 4.3GB Fujitsu 3.5") are by the way connected
to the
secondary port. On the primary I've got my old 85MB (Connor 2.5").

I suspect that the ATA.device is doing something "clever", but I'm
not sure what.

Note that the MaxTransfer value is nothing to do with speed - so the
fact that the controller can handle data at 16MB/s is irrelevant.
MaxTransfer specifies the largest block to be transfered at once, and
it is common to set this at one block under 128KB (i.e. 0x1fe00) for
IDE drives. Try setting the MaxTransfer to 0x1e00 to see whether that
stops the problem. If so it indicates that something is going wrong with
transfers larger than 8KB. If there is no change, that indicates that
the problem is something else entirely (possibly a virus?).

I think your problem then is that the Size of the HD isn't properly
recognized and it tries to format the drive over it`s real capacity
which must cause problems.... Try an other Install-Tool to make your
HD-Partitions than the Amiga-HD-Toolbox, because it sometimes make
senseless usages of HD-Filesizes/Blocks or Heads....

Try to install with HDInstTools (Aminet), and see that this one has
sometimes totally another results... 

Forget the PFS-Formatting-Tool, take the original Amiga-Format
and make a quick-format, let FFS-specific options like cache/ffs
unselected. 

I now use a 10GB HD on internal A4000 IDE partitioned in 4/42GB, but have
had tested it before with 1x10GB without any Problems.

Hi Tim

-> Yes, this is a Magellan problem - nothing to do with PFS3. In
-> fact I believe there are also problems with all but the latest
-> version of Magellan and OS3.5, so if you haven't already got
-> the latest version I'd recommend you get it.

I'm using Os3.5 (with the boing update) and Magellan 5.82 atm.

->> Something similar happened to me. I partioned my 4.3GB HD
->> into 0.3, 1.5 and 2.5 GB. Formatting the first two with
->> "pfsformat"
->> was no problem but it refused to format the last one. Using
->> the
->> wb format command seem to have worked but after reboot I
->> discovered that it had destroyed the RDB.
->> The 4GB wall is still there...

I decided to format all my partitions again, using PFSFormat
instead of the original Format command, as a last ditch attempt at
getting this to work, but its doing almost the same thing with me as it
done to you. When i try and format the 300mb partition AFTER the
previous 7.5gb partition, it refuses to format at all.

-> With pfsformat - in what way did it "refuse" to format the last
-> partition? Did it format it, but that partition then not appear
-> on the WB?

In my case i got a PFS error requestor:

    Write error 5 on block 0
    Make sure disk is inserted

If i click on cancel.. i get:

    Device test:
    LRU update failed

When i click on OK it gives me the same message again.. seems to
be an endless loop...

If i format using the Os3.5 format command, it will format fine,
but it still causes the original problem, overwriting partitions
once i write past 2-3gb on that 7.5gb partition.

-> Have you contacted the retailer where you bought PFS3 from? You've
-> paid for support, you may as well use it. Alternatively, if you
-> still have problems, let me know more details of your config and
-> I'll see what I can do.

No response from them via email so far (been a week or so), i'll
probably give them a phone soon if i dont get anywhere with this.

I'm using : A1200T, Apollo 060/50, 32Mb RAM, Twister, Scanmagic
flickerfixer, Power 4x buffered interface with a Zip, Yamaha CDRW, and
an 18Gb Samsung drive attatched to it (and a few other gadgets).

Some more A4000 clock questions :)

 ** Message forwarded from Amy Tech (AMY_TECH)
 ** Message written on 29-Mar-00 by Neil Williams

I have an A4000 showing some weirdness.  The systems real time clock has
stopped.  I've just loaded FACTS and the Workbench clock, and the second hands
are stuck.  I booted the machine from cold about half an hour ago but I've
only
just noticed it - it appears to show the time of boot up.

Doing 'setclock load' gets the correct time back, so the battery backed clock
seems okay.. but it's still stopped, just at a more correct time.  Doing a
network time update with FACTS also set the correct time, but it still stopped
at the new time.  'Setclock reset' doesn't fix it.

I've now rebooted and the clock is ticking along fine again.

After switching the computer off/on it's also still running fine.

Does anyone have any ideas?  The battery isn't leaking but is that the
problem?

   My old A1200 started doing that, and then started getting less and less reliable. IIRC, it's one of the CIA's or other chip that's started to malfunction, you should get it looked at by an amiga repair place or something...

See ya :)

1:   The "Setclock" command is only  for the RTC 
       (Battery backup up clock)
      Although reading it will set the system timer.

2:   Use the "DATE" command to determine if the system timer
     is still running... 

I will presume that you're not running any software that is stealing
the timer or doing anything naughty,   

that only leaves hardware......       one of the CIA chips  (8520)

Now here's the warning,  
       IF IT IS FAULTY, GET IT CHANGED PROFESSIONALLY,  
I have 3 dead 4000D motherboards here
that a butcher from interstate overheated the multi-layer 
board & poped the layer feed through hole plating.

It kills them permanently......  (especially 4000D boards.)

I would suggest Analogic computers in Surrey,  the link is on
my home page,  they have a SMD rework station...

Thanks a lot Tim.
MaxTransfer=0x1e00 did the trick. Now it'll copy files without problems.
I must buy me a hex calculator soon...
One question though, a MaxTransfer of 0x1e00 must be slower than
0x1fe00 since it'll have to transfer more blocks (16*8 instead of 1*128),
or?

A propos of clocks, I don't know why, when I launch any clock on my
workbench, it not display the second's hand and more it not progress anyway.
Apparently the battery backed clock works fine because the time is updated,
but not when some clocks-gui is running.
Someone can explain this phenomenon and how to ovviate it?
(Excuse for my bad english)

Try measuring the difference - the set up time for a transfer is very small
compared to the transfer time of even an 8KB block. Anyway, I think it is
preferable to have reliable transfers than faster unreliable ones!

Nice Plug Col ;-) Did you write the program yourself? Ive been looking for =
a
program that will convert between loads of different bases for a while now,
but with no luck. If anyone knows of one, can they let me know please.

Try going to http://www.onelist.com where you can log in, and then
unsubscribe.

Or maybe sending a mail to just-amiga-unsubscribe@onelist.com might work?

As Neil said its to do with the buffer, what will display
on one persons computer will not display on anothers.
If they have lower specs then its less likely to work.

The archives via email, aminet and the website are all
exactly the same so downloading one and then another
won't really make any difference :)

One way to overcome it is open it on your workbench
screen, ie, choose "no" on the requester when loading.

If this still doesn't work then lower your workbench
colours and choose "no" when loading.

This is only a problem on big articles, unfortunately.
(Not that we want the problem on all articles ;)...
you know what i mean :P )

Toodle Pip!

Does anyone out there own a Z4 busboard for their A1200, and know
the jumper settings for it? 

The main reason being, i've just plugged a Cybervision64/3d (mark 2)
into the Z4 bus, and i'm having a nightmare getting it to work
properly. I dont know whether its a hard or software problem. I
wasnt given a manual with the z4, i'll have to wait till eyetech
decide to get one to me...

When i draw a dragbox on the workbench screen (for selecting icons), 
it leaves trails all over the place, which wont go away unless i move
 a window on top of them and move it away again. On top of that i'm 
getting LOTS of random pixel trash all over the screen, mainly when i 
swap between screens, or move windows around. It doesnt matter which mode
i use, and i've tried other slots on the busboard, disabling all
hacks etc etc. Anyone ever heard of anything like this before? 

The whole thing seems to be going really slow too, when i resize
windows, it takes about 4 seconds to redraw the background (or
windows behind the current one), and thats only on 800x600x8 :( Is
it supposed to be this slow?  Enabling the 'fast z2 mode' doesnt
seem to do anything at all..

Sorry for so many questions in the one email.. this is making me
just a tad angry, because i've spent so much on it, and i'd like a
second opinion before i spend another fortune sending it all back..

Cheers

David
