G'day Chris,
                   Yes Sorry I did send it twice . To make sure it got there
as YAM asked me wich to send it to ? At the time I wasnt sure so I chose
"Both".

    As far as I know I'm still the Aus HQ. Unless I'm sacked ? <Grin> I'm
having some problems with the BBS at the moment though. I need the Latest
Cnet. I've contacted Ray and sent the cheque and that's as far as it's got.
Hopefully soon I'll be running the LATEST CNET.

Kind regards

Yep - looking good here. 

Nice to see a new Amiga list in operation - and one that's long overdue.
Hopefully we won't be subbmitted to so much strictness like the CU list. =)

As an editor of a new Amiga magazine, I'd be interested to know what people
will be doing once the final issue of CU is released? How they feel about the
closure and where they'll be going next.....

*Issue 3 of Amiga Survivor out soon!* =)

Seriously, I'm glad to be a part of this new list, and this onelist server
thing isn't all that bad!

Rob

Yam 2 preview 5 is the first version of Yam I've used and also now my
favourite mailer. Other than the odd bit of icon corruption on the toolbar,
I have had no problems with it at all.  

Anyway happy to be on this new list.  What we gonna talk about then?

chat, about
anything amiga related, ask questions if you have a problem and maybe
someone

Completely dead or is it working but not as good as it used to?

Sorry, no but what Apollo 040 card is it? For the A1200? Check if it gets
too hot.

Lovely, another amiga-mailing list :)
   I'm sure it works, but it's best to follow everybody elses'
example and send an e-mail just to check.
   How many persons are in this list so far? Or perhaps it's
possible to get that piece of information directly from one-
list?... I think it's time for me to shut up, anyway.

-- Take care!

Which Dutch companies are cheap? I checked out Amigis, Computer City etc.,
but found I might aswell mail order it from the UK where the stocks are much
larger and much more stuff is available.

Hello!

Here is another test ;)
Great with this Amiga mailing list!=20
Anyone got a Power Tower, and is it only to be
purchased in the UK? I'm planing to get one, but If
I order one at First Computers they say that a delivery=20
to Sweden would be =A348 as the case is quite heavy, and
the Power Tower itself (=A3149). Totaly =A3197!!!!

Kind regards,
Martin

Firstly hi to all on JA .. I thought i`d kick off my first posting with a
request I have a apollo 040 card which died on me and I was wonder if
anybody knows anywhere that i can get it fixed . I called Power computing
where I bought the card and they did not want to know at all  (shame) any
way any help would be welcome 
All the best

Thanks for the addresses, i'll check them out - but I'm frankly stunned that
there isn't an Amiga catalogue...

That means that products stocked are up to the manufacturers discretion (ie
mostly their own product) and so you can never know what's truely out there.

If I wanted an old game, how would I find out? If I wanted specific MIDI /
sampling gear - how would I find out? If none of the companies you list don't
deal in MIDI then where now? It's such a shame there isn't one dcedicated
Amiga 'we stock bloody everything' catalogue....

Thanks....

Best wishes,

Justin

I have found http://www.oberland.com/ to be very good and (from the point
of view of buying hardware from New Zealand) very cheap. They even took
back a scan doubler I ordered not realizing that I could not using it on a
A2000.

Subject: [just-amiga] Dice 3.15

From: "David McMinn" <D.McMinn@eee.rgu.ac.uk>

 Hi fellow Amigans,

 I hope someone can help me with this, or if not could someone tell 
me the address to subscribe to a C (preferrably Dice if there is one) 
mailing list.

 I recently downloaded the source archive for DICE 3.15 and unpacked 
it to my HD and made the relevant assigns. I also have the Amiga 
Developers CD, so I copied the include files to dinclude:amiga31.

 I would like to know how to generate the pragmas/protos for these 
files and also the relevant lib files. I tried copying the dmakefile 
in the dcc:lib directory and changing the relevant bits to use the 
new files and also copyed the lib.def file and edited that, but I'm 
not sure if they would work. I'm also using the amiga.lib that came 
on the Devs CD, renamed to amiga31l.lib, but again, I'm not sure if 
this is the correct thing to do.

 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [just-amiga] I need a new isp asap.

From: Barbra Skowronski <aset@bc.seflin.org>

Hi:
I am new to this list.
I have a local isp server. Unfortunately,its brower is a sunx lynx brower and
it is a text browser only. My amiga is a 3000. I am frustrated. I cannot even
get on compuserve even though I have an account in good standing with them.
When I attempt to log in,I get weird lettering...and the the words Hoot Naie
repeating themselves line upon line than the words not on line...

What isp servers are amiga software friendly. You should know my Amiga 
does not have an emmulator and so is not mac or ibm compatible. I use
wordbench 2.0

Please help as I am so frustrated I could scream.

Truly,
D. Barbra Skowronski

Hi Joanne:

Where can I get the upgrades. There was a private company that used to do
upgrades for amigas but it closed. I am computer moronic. I got the computer
as is. 

So,where can these upgrades be purchased and how can they be installed?

Thanks.

Hi Barbra, I too am new on this list. Well first of all if you want to have
graphics on your amiga, you should be using 3.1 os. Secondly, there is a
program called Miami, that is a pretty simple connect to the internet. But
first you still need to consider upgrading your os. I too started with a 2.1
os and upgraded to 3.1, and what a world of difference, I am so glad I did. I
use IBrowse or AWeb for my browsers. They amaze me everyday, as the Amiga can
still keep up with the everchanging internet. Anyway, please feel free to
email me if you need any help. Good luck and enjoy! :)

    Thanks but that didn't help. I'd already tried different speeds and
tried 8n1.device but it still didn't work.

Don't forget that I have used AmiTCP on an 040 board with no problems,
and if the problem was my serial device then surly Maimi would suffer
the same problems.

Can you think of anything else it could be?

See ya.

Actually, I've found a hardware hack to disable the interface. It
shouldn't be too expensive and, done right, should be perfectly safe.
Unfortunately, it involves a bit of soldering, which I am no good at, so
I'll have to get someone else to make the doohickey, but I can install
it myself. ;)

Subject: [just-amiga] Graphics card or PPC?

From: Elgersma <elgersma@worldonline.nl>

Hi all,

        my life is in ruins. The indecision is killing me, I'm positively
losing it!
        You see, I have recently acquired a very nice A1200T/060, and am
very happy with it. However, I can still afford to upgrade some more, but-
it's probably my last chance before becoming a poor student.
        So- what do I do? I have about 250,- to spend.

1. I can get a second hand Cybervision 64/3D for about 90,- Is this a good
deal? I could then just about scrape together a ZorroII board to accomodate it. 

2. I could sell the 060 and go PPC- and with it hopefully future-proofing my
Amiga a little bit at least.

I tend to use my Amiga for everything and anything, but play lots of games.
On one hand, the gfx card takes away the AGA bottleneck on my machine, on
the other hand are we likely to see lots of PPC only stuff in the next year
or two?

So what should it be- PPC&AGA or 060+Cybervision?

Any ideas appreciated!!

Erik Elgersma

From: "Mattias Andersson" <mattias.andersson@home.se>

I think you should buy the new BlizzardvisionPPC for your PPC card. They should be shipping them right now.

But of coz only if you want a new graphics card.

My friend have a CybervisionPPC and he is VERY pleased with it. Before he had a Retina card, and because of that I think he knows what he is talking about. The BvisionPPC is almost the same as CVPPC, so I don't think you will be disapointed! Right now there could be some minor problems with the driver for the card but be sure that they will be updated frequentlly!

Can't comment on this.

I wouldn't do that - not at the moment.
Available PPC software can be counted at one hand, the OS has to run 680x0 
(not PPC) and the 060 is a fast running beast.

I would go for 060+Cybervision, as a higher resolution is VERY nice 
(especially for "everything and anything").

Subject: [just-amiga] AmiTCP & Samba!

From: Mattias Andersson <mattias.andersson@home.se>

Hi there!

I'm just wondering if someone could help me with AmiTCP & Samba!

I use a A1200/030/030 with a Cnet PCMCIA card and a PC with WIN95 in a LAN
network.

I have installed AmiTCP with success more or less. I still have some problems
with my ftp server. AmiTCP crashes quite often including the applications I
use with it. Strange.

Anyway. I use AmiTCP 4.3 & Samba 1.9.16p9 (from Aminet) And would like to
browse files. No printing.

So, if someone have a similar working system I would be greatful if you could
send me all the configuration files so I can check whats wrong. That includes
the AmiTCP:db/ files and AmiTCP:samba/lib/ file(s) and also other stuff thats
relevant to get all things to work.

It is also possible to do it the other way. I send the files i have and you
check them out.

Since i'm not a TCP/IP guru most of the required configurations are faulty I
guess :-)

Desperate for help.

 AF does SOR, so hassle your newsagent!

 I don't know about catalogues but you could try some of these web 
sites, some prices may not be up to date, so either phone or email to 
confirm (beware: Power computing take ages to answer emails).

Subject: [just-amiga] Amiga mail order

From: Cold Spring <coldspring@thenet.co.uk>

Hello,

Can anyone recommend any Amiga hardware / software mail order catalogues? With
the death of Amiga magazines (and the non-SOR stance, making sure newsagents
won't stock them), it's difficult to know what's available and how to buy it.
UK based would be preferable.....

Any help would be appreciated.....thanks!

Justin

There was a thread on this subject some while back on the Netconnect
list. I'm afraid I only paid a little attention to the thread, but the
gist of it was that PPC boards conflict with the internal serial port.
The only ways to get around this conflict were either to fit an
external serial card (portplus, hypercomm), do a weird thing with the
nofastram executable that comes with workbench, where you turn off
fastram, connect to ISP and then turn the fastram on again, or use
Miami which replaces the serial.device with it's own device. I believe
that using either the artser.device or 8n1 also give some stability
over the serial.

Subject: [just-amiga] Problems with PPC + AmiTCP

From: Andrew Crowe <andrewcrowe@enterprise.net>

Hi Everybody,

    I have an A1200/2.1gig hd/32meg ram/PPC603e+(scsi)-240mhz+040-25mhz

    After I got replaced my old 040 board with my BlizzardPPC board I
found that I couldn't use amitcp anymore, as using any part of the net
was very slow. But when I connected using my Demo of Miami every thing
worked fine.

    I got AmiTCP with Netconnect V1. Does anyone know why AmiTCP (V4?)
doesn't work with my PPC card, and if upgrading to Netconnect 2 will fix
it.

See ya.

From: "Olly" <amiga.eagle@england.com>

Hi,

In my opinion, you should go fo the PowerPC, and then when your grant comes through, buy the BVisionPPC card. 

That way you can have the best of both worlds ...

Well I have 240mhz ppc and 060/50 and Netconnect 2 works a treat - Are you
using serial.device or an alternative like artser.device?

I know the original serial.device is bugged and causes problems with 060s -
try artser.device instead. This worked for me with Netconnect V1 when I had
an 040/40 Apollo board. Or you might try messing with the baud rate in the
modem config section of amitcp?

Are you using a gfx card? If not then try to use a 32 colour screen when
accessing the net as this can help chipram bottlenecks.

Other than that perhaps a post active software might help?

OK. Is there any information on the Internet or something about
this "cheaper Holland place"? The price in England is 129, how 
much does it cost in Holland then?

the thing without damage (I'll use test clips), so that I don't need to
wait for the OS to time-out waiting for a non-existent IDE drive?

I know I've asked this before in one of my lists, but, like a dolt, I
seem to have misplaced the information. :-/

Why not use an existing channel ?

On the w/ends I have one helluva time hopping from one to
the other as I frequent 3 or 4 on a regular basis. I'm not entirely
convinced that we need yet another......

Subject: [just-amiga] AIO editor and articles wanted!

From: "Chris Steward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Right, as you all should know by now this list is associated with
Amiga Information Online (AIO) the freely available Amiga only
disk-magazine I produce once a month with games & utilities
reviews plus articles, interviews and free advertising space.

I am currently looking for a Utilities Editor and Co-Editor,
the Utilities Editor would be required to review 4-5 aminet
utilities a month. The Co-Editor would help in organising 
many articles, interviews and general running of the mag.
If you have what it takes contact my personal email address
below, thanks! I am also interested in including your own
reviews and any articles you want to or have written
recently!

Hmm when CU Closes, well i'll probably burst into tears :) no seriously
it'll be sad to see it go, they have some damn decent stuff on those CD's
which saves time downloading. The CU kind of claimed it'd be round for
a while in its last issues but obviously not and I feel slightly cheated
maybe. Hopefully the Amiga Format and my magazine and ALL Amiga
magazine can get something positive from its closure, I heard AF
will get bigger as more adverts giving more space to articles etc.

What internet software are you using to log in? I definatly recommend
not using Compuserver as they aren't actually very good and they are
quite expensive.

There aren't actually alot of so called 'Amiga friendly' internet servers
but alot may offer some basic connection package, if not they are quite
easily configured. Using the program called Miami you can have all the
work done for you, as you are maybe new (i'm guessing this??!) you should
buy the new Netconnect 2 software suite which gives you a whole host
of software encluding a dialup, irc, web, email etc etc.

As I don't really have any experience with how USA servers work as
i'm from the Uk i can't really comment but definatly stay away from AOL
as they are totally Amiga no-no, you could try ringing round your
local servers or state servers however the US works and see if they
can help, or check out your local amiga usergroups etc to see if they
can help!

As others have said, you may need to update your workbench.
I am on an Amiga 3000 and am vying for the position of /List
Technical Idiot/ on the Pure Amiga mailing list - but my ISP
has been very Amiga freindly - they also have dialups in
some areas of Florida.

Primenet - 1-800-4-NET FUN

You also get a shell account with the PPP (or whatever it is 
called)

Hello, i don't know of any shops etc in India but you could always try
the www.cucug.org/amiga.html web page, they normally list everything
from web sites to shops. Hope that helps a bit, sorry I could not give
a more direct answer.

Subject: [just-amiga] Sigs

From: "Chris Steward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Yes i do agree with William F. Maddock concerning the size on
sigs, obviously i can't tell you to stop and i don't want to
enforce to many silly rules to make the list unpractical
but to make things better when you reply can you edit out the
other persons sig and the onelist sig etc from the bottom of
the message, and if you have a large sig maybe turn it off.
Thats not you have to but it would be nice for people who pay
for the size on emails etc.

World Of Amiga Show 1999 Announced



World Of Amiga Show 1999 Announced
It has now been confirmed that there will be a UK World Of Amiga show in
1999! Work is well underway on the 1999 show, although the date and venue
has yet to be confirmed. There is already a great deal of excitement for
the show which will play a major part in the rejuvenation of the Amiga
during 1999. As Peter Brameld, Organiser of the World Of Amiga show
stated, "We MUST take the Amiga into the Millenium".
Linking in with this, and following the untimely closure of CU Amiga, the
official web site of the World Of Amiga show has found a new home and is
fully operational NOW! The site is being operated and managed for World of
Amiga by Infinite Frontiers, publishers of the new Amiga fanzine, Amiga
Energy.
For more information on the show, contact Peter Brameld at
p.brameld@ukonline.co.uk
To visit the web site, point your browser at
http://www.infinitefrontiers.mcmail.com/
We at Infinite Frontiers would like to hear your comments and
suggestions about the information YOU want to see on the World Of Amiga
web site. If it is possible, we'll do everything we can to provide all the
information YOU want to know. E-mail us at infinite.frontiers@mcmail.com
We'll be updating the site as news breaks so bookmark the page and we hope
to hear from you soon. We'll see you all at the World Of Amiga 1999!!

Anymore details you can find for me would be grately received,
I didn't go as its quite expensive to get to London from Liverpool
area and didn't know if it would be worth it :( i'll be at 1999 definatly
maybe even with a AIO stall if the price is right :)

You seem like a man who knows about news, would you be interested
in being a news editor for Amiga Information Online?

Whose heard of the cerberus from Weird science then?
  It sounds, to me to be an awesome Machine.  I have just got off the
phone to weird science, I have got to praise the man ( sorry didn't
get his name) on the other end, he was very polite, very clear and
very very helpfull.
  For those of you who don't know the cerberus is a new Multimedia
machine, which weirdscience boast to be able to run both (spit) P.C
and Amiga (Hurray) software.  ATM it will use a software Amiga, but
when the inside out is availabe, you will be able to upgrade to this
8-)

This has been put out without permission of weird science I hope they
don't get mad but I thought this was worth shouting about Flame me
personally if you have a problem with this 8-)

It is even more so from the far north of Scotland as to get there I would 
have to go by plane. In 1996 I went to the WOA by car and it took a week 
there and then another to get back by car. 

It would be nice to have the WOA somewhere else for a change, somewhere 
more central to the UK. Why everything always has to be held in London is a 
mystery to me.

Subject: [just-amiga] AIO NEEDS HELP!

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Hello ALL,
   This is a small request to any Amiga users who loves the computer
he or she uses and wants to support it to its fullest. As many of you
may know by now Amiga Information Online is the disk-magazine I
run free of charge, there have been over 200 visits to the new AIO
web page in 1 weeks opening time, no doubt thanks to many of you
on this list ;) and over 13mb of AIO downloaded, also due to the great
people on the list!

 AIO has been running for 16 months and has always tried its hardest
to promote the Amiga to its fullest giving the latest news, reviews,
articles, letters, adverts as well as many other features, all being
free of charge. Now we *WANT* your help!

 We are looking for anyone who is willing to submit reviews, news,
articles, adverts & letters plus anything else you would like to see
in our magazine, we are always open to suggestions and comments and
there are many ways you can contact us.

 If you can help in anyway or distribute AIO to wide audiences then 
please get in touch, if you run a web page please add a link the the AIO
web page at : *www.amiga1.demon.co.uk/aio/index.htm *
 You can email your articles, reviews, news, letters and adverts +
whatever else to : *amiga@thefree.net*

 There are a few places on the AIO editorial team we also would like to
be filled, please find details below :-

*Co-Editor *: This is the second most main place at AIO, you would be
required to 'run the show' so to speak and produce articles and
reviews each month, plus advertise AIO in anyway you can by word of
mouth etc.

*Utilities Editor *: You would be required to review any PD utilities you
can download from free sources eg. Aminet we are currently looking
into commercial software from commercial companys to be submitted
to on a keep or loan basis.

*Games Co-editor *: This would require shadowing the current games
editor, Lee Hesselden, helping with reviews and the running of the
games section.

*News Editor* : You would be required to scout for news and to take
news from news sources like cucug and find out other exclusives
etc.

 We are always looking for writing talent so if you can help out the
Amiga community in anyway we would be pleased to hear from you!

I have just read the weird science mail shot, and couldn't help but notice
that "Cereberus" is just a wintel clone with UAE preinstalled. Why should
I buy a PC from Blittersoft/weirdscience when I can get one from Mesh or
Dell? I trust both of these suppliers,  because I use their machines at work 
and they work as advertised. (they say that they are PeeCees and they 
are PeeCees)

If you want to thrash  around with multiple operating systems on one 
computer then you would get much better overall price/performance if 
you  start with an iMac from Apple and install SoftWindows :-P Why 
would you want to emulate Amiga when the real hardware is more Fun.

If you have your heart set on an inside out card then *shop around*! 
The PC market is a large hulking monster with some very competetive
prices. It is in our interest to support amiga vendors, but not amiga 
vendors who want to make a clean transition from amiga to PC, taking 
regular customers with them. 1000 pre tax is a good price for a 
system with these specs and a montor, but i'll wait for a  review in
PC Plus or pC PRo before buying.

Here is how Weird Science describe a PII 300Mhz...
"Feel the power of processors running so fast that they were in danger
of going back in time."

At least the Gordon Harwood mac adverts were upfront and honest.

If Weird Science don't want ppl to hear about "Cereberus"  then they 
shouldn't have mailed an asshole like me :-)

Thanks

How the heck did it take a week to cross the UK by car? Over here we
could drive clear across the continent in less time.

Perhaps because it is actually the World of Amiga-London.

You have good and relatively empty roads, if you have driven in Scotland 
and parts of England you will see the difference ;^) Small roads that are 
mainly traffic jams do add a lot of time to a journey.

I also omitted to mention that as I was going so far we made a holiday of 
it and stopped at a few places on the way there and back :-)

I cannot afford the time off work to do that every year though!


> Perhaps because it is actually the World of Amiga-London.

This is unfortunately the same for *everything* in the UK and not just 
Amiga shows :-(

Weird Science website is weird. I haven't tried to access it with an
Amiga-browser but I've tried it with Netscape for Mac and Windows and
Internet Explorer (windows only). Guess what? Only Internet Explorer
shows it. Well, NS shows it but as soon as you try to see the ordering
page it crashes.

But otherwise WeirdScience is a good company. I ordered some things from
them recently and got the goods faster than from some companies in
my own country...

Subject: [just-amiga] The better program for newsgroup is..?

From: Riccardo Cretti <CrettiRiccardo@anthesi.com>

Hello to everyone!
I want to know what is the best program for newsgroup
for Amiga.
At the moment I use Thor 2.5a, and is good.
I want to know if Monsoon, NewsRog and the new program
to use YAM 2 (YAM2NN) as a newsgroup reader works better
than Thor!
I've never tried the others because I'm happy with Thor, but
if another program is really better, I'm ready to change.

Hi All.

I got thinking the other night about  just how many Amigas there actually
are in the UK, or any other country for that matter?

Some of the cheap air fares that are available now would amount to
less than the cost of the petrol to drive.

Well, in India SHAF , the distributors of AMIGA since 1996 claim to have
sold about 2500 A1200s every year. Does this help? The Indian market is
made up solely of Videographers who use it with a Genlock for titling
Wedding videos and assorted stuff.

Hi Gavin

Depending on who you talk to you will get widely differing answers.

I believe there were about 7 million sold in total world wide, over
1 million in the UK.

Not many are still in use however (a lot are A500s, although I believe
the A1200 was the best selling version overall).

In the UK, CU-Amiga sold 25,000 copies, and Amiga Format less.
Assuming there was some overlap of readership (some people buy
both magazines), and some people that buy neither, I'd put the
UK Amiga users at around 35,000 - of which the majority have
no plans to spend further money on Amiga equipment or software.
Perhaps there are 1,000 very active Amiga users in the UK that
regularly spend money on equipment or software.

Worldwide, figures vary between 100,000 and 500,000 Amiga users.
The most commonly accepted figure is 300,000. Again, only a
small percentage regularly spend money on Amiga sw/hw.

There are I believe about 8000 PowerPC Amiga users worldwide.

So a good Amiga software title could look forward to selling
perhaps 1,000 - 2,000 copies if it had wide enough appeal. Less
popular titles may only sell a few hundred. This is of course a
fraction of what sales could have been a few years ago, and is
also the reason so many developers have stopped developing for
the Amiga.

My figures are not based on hard fact, so I'll be happy to
discuss them...

  Tim

Not a bad idea mate :-)
At least there would be somewhere interesting to see !

He he the flight between London and San Diergo would probably be less 
hassle than the initial part in getting to London in order to fly out ! But at 
least the destination would make the effort worthwhile and I would not 
have to *stay* in London :-)

Subject: [just-amiga] Re: How many Amiga users are there?

From: "Gavin Williams" <gavin@micro-media.demon.co.uk>

I wonder if the sales figures for CU-A/AF are for this country only or
overall. If your figures are accurate that's quite a small %. It makes you
wonder really how companies such as Power Computing and Weird Science (both
of which I can't recommend enough, they are excellent) manage to keep their
heads above water. I have the unenviable job of working in IT so deal with
PCs on a daily basis. I have to say I have never dealt with a more crap OS
than Windows. The damn things just crash so bloody often it drives me mad.
Then I come home, boot up my A1200 (which boots in about 10 seconds instead
of 10 minutes) and it NEVER crashes. The ultimatedream amchine as far as I'm
concerned. Incidentally, make your 8000 PPC users 8001 as I've just got my
Blizzard 160/040/25 603+ with 32mb ram and am thoroughly pleased with it.
Makes a hell of a difference to Workbench speedwise. Quake still runs like a
dog though but hey it's worth it.

remember though, many people come from europe to see these shows, so

NewsRog is very very powerful,but takes a lot of configuring. However
this adds up to your reading/viewing experiance once set up.

Subject: [just-amiga] Photogenics ...

From: "Olly" <amiga.eagle@england.com>

Hi there,

Does anybody have the copy of Amiga Computing that gave away Photogenics ? I have lost my copy of the magazine, and after re-installation Photogenics is asking for the reg number (which is in the mag).

I'm installing it on UAE - i know it works, i have done it before, but i lost the mag and some other stuff in a car break-in.

Thanks for your help,
SeeYA,

Hmm.. I could do with some advice on this too, I lurk on a few newsgroups
through work but only recently got a connection at home.

I got the Net&Web package from HiSoft but don't consider it that great -
basically its IBrowse + AmiTCP 3.0 Beta + a less than impressive mail prog
and a similarly basic newsreader.

The newsreader won't let you read offline easily (the multiple select to
save messages seems a bit dodgy to me), sometimes mixes up the subject and
size data (in separate parallel windows) and insists on opening a post to
read in a window then returning you to the list when you close it ie. no
"Next message" never mind "Next Threaded".

YAM sorted out my email but YAM2NN (which I just checked out this evening)
needs AmiTCP 4.0+ so N&W lets me down again.

So I suppose its THOR or Microdot II...

actually I've just realised that this post is more motivated by having a
moan about Net&Web than anything else - sorry guys!

oh, hello btw :)

It occurred to me that perhaps you could distribute a PicLink, like those infamous "Netscape NOW!" stickers you see on all the worst PC web pages ? For an example of what I mean, go to :

http://home.talkcity.com/HardDiskDr/amigaeagle/HTM-Files/PicLinx.htm

I could have a go at putting one together for you if you to send me your logo via an e-mail attachment ?

But remember also, that it is often cheaper to fly from Europe into a
city airport, than into Gatwick/Heathrow, and certainly much easier to
get out of the airport ;-)

The figures for the magazines are AFAIK total sales (not just UK).
The ABC figures for CU-Amiga July-December 1997 were 23,458 and I
understand it was falling (I don't have the more recent figures at
hand).

Most Amiga dealers (including Weird Science and Power Computing)
survive only because the sell other stuff too.

So why not France, Belgium or even somewhere "else" in England other 
than London.
Then you would at least get to visit somewhere worth going to ;^)

All these poor folk see of Britain is just London which is not a very 
good advertisement for our country - there is far more to the UK than 
just London. 

Coming to the UK and just seeing London is like being stuck in an 
airport lounge, you never see the rest of the place  :-( 

So why should someon who has made the effort to come from Europe have to 
be stick in London, it does not make sense, when *we* go abroad we go to a
city
with an airport and then get the hell out of there and go somewhere nice well
away from the city that just happens to have an airport but not much else.




Regards,

Bill.

  s'okay,  I'm only playing around.  I do actually own full
versions of both Voyager and IBrowse, (soon to be followed by
AWeb if I don't get Javascript from the other two!)

  I browse from work so I'll just have wait until I go online
at home to see the darn page.  (Unless I try lynx!)

bye,
  Chris.

After hours and hours in London airports recently - guess ;^)

Far too much light-pollution for me though, which was the main reason 
I left Warrington many, many years ago.

The only regret I have for living where I do now is the total lack of any
decent ale :-(

Oh, and I nearly forgot - *the weather*   :-(


I *do* get miffed that everyone is always /expected/; to go on a long haul to
London and "southerners" never bother to go north of Watford for anything
though. Manchaster, Liverpool, Glasgow  and Newcastle (though also dreadful
places) do have good airport access and are far more central to the UK than
London.



Regards,

Bill.

Why do you believe this?
Is this just a guess or do you have read/heard some statement?

 Sounds like a normal PC to me. The fact that it can run amiga

 Unless I've missed something that is.

From: The LOGIC's <The-Logics@usa.net>

Hi:

#1: Anyone know when a new YAM preview is out??

#2: 64mb is enough for a normal use of a A4000/060/CVPPC 8mb? Because i'll
go to buy memorys the next week and i don't know if is good to buy 4 16Mb
or 2 32Mb. 32Mb simms is hard to find here, Dimms is too populars. And in
the last 2 weeks the price of simms go very high. Two week ago the price
for a 32mb EDO simms is US$ 33, now is 45-60. But i can get a 16Mb EDO for
US$17,50. I've think i will get the 4 16mb simms.

                                           Bye, Gonzalo. The LOGIC's

Hi,

There were certainly Amigas there in 1994. We visited Buenos Aires and 
went to a Virtual reality games place. All of these seem to have been 
controlled by A1200s :-)

I just checked with power and they assured me that they were still 100% for
the amiga, which is good, I think my Co-sysop must have had a bad day;)

Yeah between ordering and receiving N&W one of the mags did a rave
review of NetConnect and I would buy it but for one thing - the demo
of the whole thing on CUCD26 failed to install (can't remember what the
error was) which kind of put me off. Once I got YAM set up to my
taste, and then AmIRC from aminet which works fine (yes OK it costs
20 quid to reg. which I haven't yet and NC comes with it..) I only really
needed a newsreader so NC didn't seem so attractive (oh yeah and I
like IBrowse tho' I daresay Voyager's equivalent - havent given it a proper
go).

This evening I tried to get THOR going from Aminet and bah!! it failed to
install with "Basemanager failed to set up environment variables".

Maybe I will go for NC after all... I particularly don't like the idea of
running AmTCP 3 *Beta* when a quick look at that NC demo reveals
a nice shiny 4.0. Think I'll try installing that demo again and see what it
was that wouldn't happen...

Cheers

I don't think you have. I got that press release today and sounds like a
PC to me. Weird Science's patter (and bad grammar) that "From the gates of
Hades spawned 'Cerebus' a coalescence of Beast and Machine into a Totally
Integrated Multimedia Home Entertainment System of awseome power" seems
bizarre to me - I can't help thinking that someone was struggling to sell

        Amiga Information Online issue 16 (September 1998) OUT NOW
 
   The latest issue of the magazine you all love is out now, packed full
     with reviews, news, articles, readers adverts and much much more,
   you must get hold of this issue! Read the special interview with the
    programmer of The Shadow of Time and the articles about MPEGs, the
         Amiga and many more interesting news storys and reviews.

                               Get it from :

Web :              www.amiga1.demon.co.uk/aio/index.htm

FTP :                   aminet docs/mags/aiov16.lha

Email :                      amiga@thefree.net

P.s. Sorry that I couldn't send AIO Issue 16 direct to the list but it
was just over 200k and people would complain about the size so if
you want it go download it from one of the places above.

If you read my interview with Weird Science and Epic Marketing a 
few issues ago in AIO you will find they say they only do bussiness
about 10% for PCs and thats mainly the multiformat CDs only like
graphics CDs!

Subject: [just-amiga] Blittersoft thumbs down!

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

I'd just like to give Blittersoft the worst company of the month
award, i ordered 1 32mb chip for little over 35 and they have
taken over 2 weeks to deliver and I still have not seen it after
contacting them twice by phone. How many companys will charge
4.50 p&p and take over two weeks for a simple order. Thumbs
down to blittersoft!

You could always visit the AIO web site from any browser at
www.amiga1.demon.co.uk/aio/index.htm

With the added bonus that AIO Issue 16 is out now and just

Cerberus is a sign of this.

Is there a 3 or Tombraider? Well, I have heard rumours of a illegal PPC-port
of the original Tombraider. I even have the exe-file but since I don't
own a PPC-card I can't check if it's true or a hoax.

I'll check.

I think that Tombraider 3 isn't out yet but it should be shortly or
something. How big is that exe file? surely tombraider would take
a whole CD! or do you also need the original pc cd aswell?

Subject: [just-amiga] Topics

From: "Chris Seward" <amiga@thefree.net>

Could I just ask everyone to enter a new topic if the mailing
goes completely onto another subject, its annoying to still
be seeing every mail about London WOA and Cerberus when
half of these new mails have nothing relivent with those topics.
Thanks!

The exe isn't that large but you do need the original graphic/sound
files.

I'll take a look, but to tell the truth I suspect it is a hoax. The
size of the archive is only 85 K! An exe-file, a couple of libs,
two graphic drivers and some other files which I have no idea
what they're supposed to do.

Hi Tim Corringham

My modest reply to your....
---------------------------

> It's a ltd company - what did you think it might be?

Its also the company who sold PFS2, the best file system for your
Amiga and its also the company who`s porting Opera to the miggy.

Keep up the good work.

You're wrong by A3000. And here has a lot of A500 and A1200, but the
official dealer dissapear on 1994 (bankrupt i've think). Now we have 2-3
official thief. All appear on amiga.de official page, Look up and see.
There are giving pirate copys in that page.

And the prices!!! for example A1500 US$5000. Blizz060/603 US$3200.

I don't say too much, maybe someone is reading this...

Rather do *not* start it. I got such a archive a while ago, it had some
viruses in it.
BTW, try a simple version <library file name> FILE FULL and you'll see.

I haven't. I don't have the original graphics so I didn't think it was worth
trying either way.

Oops. One being ixnet.library and one being bullet.library, the displaydrivers
were nicked from Superview and the rest were the destracker.library.

Most definately a hoax, as I suspected.

Well i had this one too....so A bit of a warning here...

-- DO NOT RUN THE EXE-FILE!!! IT CONTAINS SOME STRANGE CODE --

even if you have a ppc it will complain about it not being found...
I took a quick disassembly of it with the "In Go" disasmbler and i'm not 
sure but i found some deleting code inside (not sure, could have been 
something else but it looks strange...)

all the rest of the files are just renamned librarys and stuff...

take care.

I've downloaded the main archive of Thor 2.5, the Inet archive for
e-mail and newsgroups, and the patch for upgrade Thor to 2.5a.
And all worked perfectly... Thor is my official newsgroup reader now.
But I want to try the others, because there are many newsreader...

If the're written properly, all programs will work on an 060.
If you are having apps crash & stuff, then I might suggest checking that
you have the correct 68060.library & the 68040.library.

68060's also do NOT like running with the cache & burst switched off too.

I'm very satisfied with my 060. I don't have problems but i don't try too
much games. The programs almost work very well.

Now i buyed the CVPPC 8mb and soon i will buy a Cheap 15" or 17" PC
monitor.

If you ask what i do with the board nothing yet because when i buyed the
board don't work fine and i have to send it to P5. 3 months later i have
the board again with me. Now i will test and try it.

Now only writes CDR, a little of internet and email.

Subject: [just-amiga] A new game for Amiga

From: Matti Niskanen <mattkane@lappi.plai.fi>

Hello!

This is my first letter to this mailinglist.
I just wanted to test and give information
to the list subscibers.

Last summer I created a game for Amiga.
It is called "Sparrow" and it's my graduation work
for "datanomi"-course. It can be found from the Aminet
/game/misc/sparrow.lha

If somebody wants to, I can email the 520 kilobyte
LHA-archive.

Keep the tractor going! (TM)

 Similar to what I am currently experiencing - the shipping date for 
my 1260 has been put back two weeks. And if I don't get it by the end 
of this week, then they had better watch out...

I seem to recall seeing a rumour that the sources to these were released

For the port to be finished and some working 3D-accelleration. The port
alone won't suffice.

 Quake 2 would probably be OK on a PPC software only, but there are 
more advanced games than this (and it sucks a bit - just not the same 
oooh factor as Quake). As an example take Unreal: I've played it on a 
P233MMX with 3D card (resolution 512x384) and it was OK, but still 
jerky in places. I've also played it on a P2-266 with no 3D card and 
it had to be run in 320x240 to be anywhere near the 3D card version.

 Even if software alone would work well, its still a good idea to 
have decent 3D acceleration as this would improve things greatly. 
Thats what happened with PCs (unfortunately gradually everything has 
shifted to requiring a 3D card).

Because it won't be fast enough. Maybe on the fastet 604 but on the 603,
I think you can forget it. At least with some higher resolutions.

I've seen it running on a P200 without 3D accelleration and it wasn't fun 
at all. With a Voodoo card in it, it was more than fast enough on the other 
hand.
