Three college students shared an apartment. Every night one of the guys 
would go out and get drunk, come home at 2:00 AM, and puke in the kitchen
sink. The other two guys were getting plenty upset so they decided to play
a joke on him. They went to the butcher shop and asked for 2 pounds of 
chicken guts. After the guy went out they poured the chicken guts in the
sink. That night, the third guy comes in precisely at 2:00 AM and starts
puking in the sink. After a few moments everything was quite. About an 
hour later they heard the guy going to bed. The next morning he told the 
other two guys what had happened: "I gotta quit drinking. This morning I 
came in and puked my guts out. It took me an hour to get 'em all back in 
again."

One day a lady was inside of an elevator and she had to fart really bad. She
thought to herself, 'What am I going to do if someone comes in and smells it.
I'm going to be so embarrassed.' Then she thought, 'If I spray this can of 
pine air freshener no one will ever know what I did.' So she farted and one
floor later a biker stepped in and the lady said, "What does it smell like 
in here?" The biker replied, "It smells like someone shit a Christmas tree."

On this farm there used to be a cat and a rooster, but the rooster and the
cat didn't get along very well. The cat was nosey about where the rooster 
went everyday, but the rooster wouldn't tell him anything at all and this
made the cat mad. So one day the cat decided to follow the rooster to see
where it was he went everyday. He followed the rooster to a stream where
the rooster would jump across, but the cat was afraid of falling in. This
went on about a week and then the one day the rooster saw the cat follow 
him and stop at the stream, too afraid to cross over. The rooster started
jumping back and fourth across the stream teasing the cat because he was 
afraid to jump over. This made the cat very mad and he decided if the 
rooster could do it then so could he. The cat got a running start and 
jumped, but landed in the middle of the stream where he drowned. The 
moral of this story is that for every happy cock there is a wet pussy.

There men died and went to hell. Satan met them at the gates and said, "All
three of you weren't bad enough to go straight to Hell, so you get another 
chance. If you can tell me something I can't do you can go to Heaven." The 
first man said, "Make a car made of solid gold that runs on gasoline."
Satan did and the man went into Hell. The second man said, "Make a house 
of solid silver." Satan did and the guy went into Hell. The last man was 
a biker and he was laughing. Satan said, "How can you laugh when you are 
at the gates of hell?" The biker stopped laughing, farted, and said, "Catch 
it."

One day Joe came hobbling in the club house with a 7 iron wrapped around his
neck. Of course everyone was curious as to what happened to poor ol' Joe.
Sam asked, "What happened to you?" In a raspy whisper, Joe told this tale 
of woe:  

     I was teeing off on the 5th hole and I shagged my ball out into 
     this field of cows. I went over the fence and was looking for my 
     ball when this lady on the 12th tee shagged her ball into this
     same field. So we're both looking for our balls when I happened
     to see this one cow acting a little different than the rest. I 
     went over and raised its tail and damned if there wasn't a golf 
     ball stuck in its asshole. So I hollered at the lady, "Hey lady,
     does this look like yours?"

                     A COWBOY'S VIEW OF REINCARNATION

                              (By Wally McRee)
 
"What's reincarnation?" a cowboy asked his friend. His old pal told him: 

     It starts when your life comes to it's end: They comb your 
     hair and wash your neck and clean your fingernails and put 
     you in a padded box, away from life's travails. Then the box
     and you goes in a hole that's been dug into the ground. 
     Reincarnation starts when you're planted beneath that mound.
     Them clods melt down, just like that box and you inside - and
     that's when you're beginning your transformation ride. And in
     awhile the grass will grow upon your rendered mound until some-
     day upon that spot a lonely flower is found. And then a "hoss" 
     done eat it along with his other feed - makes bone and fat 
     essential to the steed - but there's a part that the horse can't
     use and so it passes through and there it lies upon the ground.
     This thing that once was you, and if by chance I should pass by
     and see this on the ground, I'll stop awhile and I'll ponder at
     this object that I've found. And I'll think about reincarnation
     and life and death and such, and I'll come away concludin' "Why,
     you ain't changed all that much!"

A doctor was taking a group of interns on rounds at a hospital. All of a 
sudden, another intern came racing down the corridor, shouting "Quick, doc-
tor, give me a pen!" The doctor reached into his pocket and handed the intern
something. The intern looked at the object and said, "Doctor, this isn't a 
pen. It's a rectal thermometer." The doctor looked at the thermometer and 
exclaimed, "Dammit, some asshole has my pen!"

One day a kid came home and yelled, "Ma, Ma, I had sex for the first time 
today!" The mother was outraged and sent the kid upstairs to his room. When
the father got home, the mother explained the situation, whereupon the 
father marched staright up the stairs to his son's room. "I Hear you had 
sex, son." said the father in a stern voice. "Yeah ..." "Way to go! Now 
you're a man! I'm proud of you son." The next day at work the father told
the guys at work about his 'improved' son. That night he came home from 
work and again went to his son's room. "So, son, did you have sex again 
today?" "No Dad; my asshole is still sore from yesterday ..."

There once was an career aggie who was well into his 12th year at A&M. His 
father, an arch-supporting alumni, was growing tired of his son not having
graduated yet. He himself took only 10 years. So he pressured the dean to 
simply graduate his son and be done with it. Not wanting to give preferen-
tial treatment to the rich alumni, but still wanting his substantial finan-
cial support, the dean decided to test the boy and, if he passed the exam, 
then he would grant him his graduate degree. So the dean called the son 
into his office and explained the matter, telling him he only had three 
questions and that it was an overnight, open book, test (Not wanting to 
leave anything up to chance). Then he listed the questions:

1. How many Days of the Week begin with a "T"?
2. How many Seconds are there in a Year?
3. How many "D's" are there in DIXIE?

The youth hurried home and began to work. The next day he returned to the 
dean's office, obviously worn to a frazzle, having stayed up all night 
working. The dean asked him, "Okay son, for the first question, how many
days of the week begin with a "T", what is your answer?" The son said, 
"Well, 'course that was the first and easiest one ... There are two days,"
(The dean smiled) "Today and Tomorrow!" The dean began to sweat and wiped
his face. "Well I suppose there is a certain amount of truth to that answer,
so I'll accept it. Now, for the second question: How many seconds are there
in a year? The son replied, "You know that had me workin' a long time, till
I looked at my calendar fer help. Then it come to me: there are 12 seconds 
in a year. The 2nd of January, 2nd of Feb ..." The Dean almost lost it, but
then regained composure. "Son," he said, "I believe we misphrased the 
question, so I'm going to give you credit for it. Now, for the third and
final question, how many D's are there in "Dixie"? The lad just smiled, 
and said, "That's the one what kept me up all night until I got it right!
There are 232 D's!" he said proudly. "What do you mean, 232?" sputtered the
dean. "How did you come up with that?" "Well, you gotta just count like 
this: Dee Dee Dee, De De De De Dee Dee Deeee ..."

One bright and early afternoon a ventriloquist was walking through a field
when he encountered an indian grazing his cow, horse and sheep. The man 
smiled at the indian and asked, "How are you doing today Mr. Indian?" The 
Indian smiled and said, "Me fine." The man then turned to the cow and asked,
"And how are you doing today Mr. Cow?" The Indian got a puzzled look on his
face and said, "Cow no talk." The man threw his voice at the cow saying,
"Oh, I'm o.k., but sometimes this indian's hands are cold when he tries to
milk me." The indian's eyes grew wide. Then the man turned to the horse
and asked, "And how are you doing today Mr. Horse?" The indian once again 
looked at the man and said, "Horse no talk." The man threw his voice again, 
saying, "Oh, I'm o.k., but sometimes when this Indian is riding me he hits
me awful hard." The indian's eyes grew even wider. Finally, the man looked 
to the sheep and asked, "And how are you doing today Mr. Sheep?" The indian
quickly shouted, "Sheep lie! Sheep lie!"

There were three couples who wanted to be members of a church: an elderly 
couple, a middle-aged couple and a newlywed couple. The preacher said, 
"To become members you have to abstain from sex for one whole month."  
All three couples agreed and arranged to return in one month. After the 
month had passed, the preacher asked each couple how well they had done. 
The elderly couple reported they had succeded with little difficulty. The
middle-aged couple said it was challenging, but that they had also succeded.
Then the preacher asked the newlyweds how they had done. The husband said, 
"Well, the first two weeks were o.k., the third week was really challenging,
but during the fourth week my wife bent over to get a can of vegtables and 
I just lost all control." The preacher said, "Well, then, I'm sorry to say 
that you can't become members of our church."  To which the husband replied,
"That's o.k., they won't let us back in the grocery store either."

Once upon a time, a man was walking along the beach when he saw a beautiful 
girl who, sadly, had no legs. She was in her wheelchair bawling her eyes 
out. "What's wrong?" he asked. "I've never been hugged before," she replied.
So he hugged her. The next day on his walk, he saw her again. Once more, she
was crying. "What's wrong now?" he asked. "I've never been kissed before." 
she sobbed. So he proceeded to lay a lip-lock on her. The third day he was 
walking by and AGAIN saw the poor girl crying. By now annoyed, he snapped,
"Now what?" "I've never been fucked before ..." she said hopefully. Where-
upon he proceeded to pick her up out of her wheelchair and throw her in the 
water. "Now you're fucked!"

sheep on top had hurt his two front hooves and the other sheep was helping

screw you in the end?"

One day Adam was in the Garden of Eden when God came over to him and said,
"I made something for you. What I made for you will do anything you say, 
fix your meals and give you indescribable pleasure. It will take care of
you always and it will never give you any trouble." Adam thought a moment
and said, "What does it cost me?" God said, "Just an arm and a leg." Adam
said "Sorry, but that's too steep for me. What can I get for a rib?"

Once upon a time there was a mathematician who found an equation for GOD. It
was, of course, a very complicated equation but, she figured, all she had to
do was find a computer system which (1) had a large enough memory to store 
all the necessary variables, and (2) was fast enough to gather all the infor-
mation together. Once this was accomplished, all the mysteries of the Uni-
verse could be solved. So the government took every available micro-
processor, linker, loader, assembler and anything else they had available, 
put them all together and asked the computer: "Is there a God?" Unfortu-
nately, however, the computer's response was that it would take, at the 
very least, a century or two to solve the problem. This wasn't good enough
for the bureaucrats in Washington who, for the first time in their lives 
wanted something other than the status quo. So they decided to follow that
up by taking every single computer in the entire nation and, linking them 
all together into one giant, ever-so-much-bigger, super-computer, asked 
once again, "Is there a God?" Well, this time the computer said that it 
would take only ten years to solve the equation  Not as bad, but still not
quick enough to satisfy all the eager philosophers and scientists. "Some-
thing more must be done!" they shouted. By this time the whole world was 
beginning to pay attention to the project and everone wanted to get 
involved. After much debate, the United Nations decided to build the com-
puter and discover if there really was a God. So they took every computer
system in the world and linked them all together into one single amazing 
super-duper-computer - the likes of which had never, EVER, been seen 
before! Once again the scientists asked, "Is there a God?" The response?

"THERE IS NOW!"

they will turn out the lights and lock the door. If you tell the Army to 
secure a building, they will occupy it and forbid entry to those without a 
pass. If you tell the Marines to secure a building, they assault it with 
heavy fire, capture the building, fortify it and call in an air strike.

Father John looked at the Sister Agnes and said, "Looks like this is it for 
us." Sister Agnes agreed. "I always wanted to have sex before I died." said

said, "What is that?" Father John told the good Sister that it was the Shaft
of Life. Said Sister Agnes: "Then, why don't you stick it in that camel so 
we can get the hell out of here?"

A boy came home from school one day and went up to Dad. "Pop, I've gotta 
write a paper on the difference between theory and fact. Can you help me?"
"Why sure son. Go and ask your mom if she would sleep with old Mr. Johnson 
next door for half-a-million dollars." The son was puzzled at this, but went 
and asked mom anyway. He walked back in the room a short time later and said 
"Yeah, mom would do that." "Go and ask your sister the same question." said 
the father. Junior ran up the stairs, asked Sis, and came thundering down 
the stairs. "She said she would also." "Okay son, here's the difference: In
theory, we're millionaires. But, in fact, we're living with a couple of 
sluts."

The school bus approached the curb and slowed but, upon noticing a gibbering 
kid stumbling around, gooking all over the place, the driver stepped on the 
pedal and left the kid in a cloud of dust. Next day, the bus approached the
same curb, but upon noticing the gibbering, drooling kid with his arms 
flopping around, the bus smoked by the kid again. The third day, the bus
again approached the curb.  Once again, the kid on the curb was frantically
stumbling around, drooling and gibbering. The bus burned rubber, hopped the
curb, and ran right over the stumbling kid. Later, the police arrived. The 
officer asked the bus driver, "I understand that you failed to pickup the 
poor kid all week long and, as if that weren't enough, you ran him over!. 
What do you have to say for yourself?" To which the driver replied, "He 
wuth makking fthun uff me!"

and said, "Hey, I like your duck. Will you give it to me if we go into the
bushes and fool around?" Dirty Ernie agreed, and off they went. When they 
finished, Dirty Ernie said, "Hey, if you'll give me my duck back, we can 
do that again." So they fooled around in the bushes some more. Unfortu-
nately, about this time a big truck came barreling down the street. The 
truck driver saw the duck in the road, and slammed on his brakes - but no 
luck - he ran right over it. The driver told Dirty Ernie, "Hey kid, I'm 
sorry about your duck. Here's a dollar to pay for it." Later, when Dirty
Ernie finally got home, his dad asked him how his day was. Dirty Ernie 
said, "Not bad, Dad. I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and a 
buck for a fucked-up duck."

                        TITLE: Restroom Policy (RTP)

Effective Date: Immediately.

Revised:        July 31, 1990.

Approval:       Board of County Commissioners.

References:     None.

Author:         Anonymous.

Purpose:        In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to 
                the bathroom under informal guidelines. Effective 
                September 1, 1990, a Restroom Trip Policy (RTP) will 
                be established to provide a consistent method of 
                accounting for each employee's restroom time and 
                ensuring equal treatment of all employees.

Policy:         It is the policy of the county government to provide 
                fair and equal restroom time for all employees. Under 
                this policy, a "Restroom Trip Bank" will be established 
                for each employee. The first day of each month, employees
                will be given twenty (20) Restroom Trip Credits. Restroom
                Trip Credits may be accumulated from month to month.

Exceptions:     Pregnant employees (male or female) will be given forty 
                (40) Restroom Trip Credits per month.

Definitions:    None.

Procedure:      Currently the entrances to all restrooms are being equipped
                with personnel identification stations and computer-linked 
                voice print recognition devices. During the next two (2) 
                weeks, each employee must provide two (2) copies of voice
                prints (one normal, one under stress) to Personnel Services. 
                The Voice Print Recognition Stations will be operational, 
                but not restrictive for the month of September; employees 
                should acquaint themselves with the stations during that 
                period. If an employee's Restroom Trip Bank balance 
                reaches zero (0), the doors to all restrooms will remain 
                locked for that employee's voice until the first of next 
                month when the employee receives his/her next 20/40 
                credits. In addition, all restroom stalls are being 
                equipped with timed paper-roll retractors. If the stall 
                is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will 
                sound. Thirty seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll 
                of paper in the stall will retract, the toilet will flush,
                and the stall door will open.

Liability:      It is the responsibility of all management personnel to 
                ensure understanding and compliance with this policy.

There once was a business executive who decided he needed a little rest from
the daily routine, so he decided to take his pretty, young secretary to a 
hotel for some whoopee. He rented a very nice, quiet room and they spent 
the day drinking, going to bed, having lunch, drinking some more, back to 
bed again, etc. Finally 5 o'clock came and they had to go their separate 
ways. On the way home, he was thinking about what excuse he could tell his 
wife if she was in the mood for having a 'party' tonight. He drove up the 
driveway of his home and sure enough, there was his wife at the door, all 
arrayed in a pretty gown and negligee, with pipe, slippers and cool drinks.
She led him into the house, with all the sweetness she possessed, to his 
favorite armchair. He thought, "God I hope that this doesn't build up to 
something." They sat back and relaxed, sipping their drinks and talking. 
Suddenly, she said that she had forgotten something in the bedroom, got 
up and said she would be right back. He thought, "Oh Lord, here it comes." 
As soon as she had left the room he jumped up, unzipped his trousers, pulled
out 'Jasper' and started to bend it and whip it around trying to get some 
life into it, but nothing happened - it did not help a bit. He heard her 
returning so he stuffed 'Jasper' back into his trousers, zipped them up, 
sat down and sighed. They continued their conversation, then she asked him
if he would care for another drink, and he replied that he would, so off 
she went to the kitchen to fix it. He jumped up immediately, opening his 
pants again, out with 'Jasper', up and down, around and around, back and 
forth - all this with much more vigor than before - but to no avail. He 
decided he would just have to tell her that he was too tired for the fun 
and games tonight. She returned with their drinks, sat down and said, 
"Dear, I've a most wonderful surprise for you, and I know that you will 
be perfectly delighted." He thought, "Sure I will." Then aloud, "Well, 
what is it?" She answered sweetly, and with a sly smile, "Guess what, 
we're on Totally Hidden Video!"

Once upon a time, a newlywed couple were on their honeymoon in the Bahamas. 
One day, while sun-bathing, the husband got a bad case of sunburn on his 
dick. In terrible pain, he went back to their room to seek some relief. He 
opened up the frig and found a bottle of milk. He poured a glass and soaked
his irritated cock within. As he was standing there, his wife walked in,
looked at him, and said, "So that's how it's done! I've always wondered
how you guys filled that thing up."

                    NEW ELEMENT DISCOVERED AT BELL LABS

(Boston) - The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered at 
Bell Labs. The element, tentatively named ADMINISTRATIUM, has no protons or 
electrons and thus has an atomic number of 0.  However, it does have one 
neutron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice-neutrons, and 111 assistant-vice-
neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held
together, in a nucleus, by a force that involves the continuous exchange of 
meson-like particles called morons.

Since it has no electrons, Administratium is inert. However, it can be 
detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in contact with.
According to Bell Lab scientists, a minute amount of Administratium caused 
one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally occur
in less than one second.

Administratium has a normal half-life of approximately three years - at which
time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in 
which assistant neutrons, vice-neutrons, and assistant-vice-neutrons exchange
places. Some studies have shown that the atomic weight actually increases 
after each reorganization. 

Research at other laboratories indicate that Administratium occurs naturally
in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points such as govern-
ment agencies, large corporations, universities, and can be found in the 
newest best maintained buildings.

Scientist point out that Administratium is know to be toxic at any level of
concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is 
allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administra-
tium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date 
are not promising.

An old man went into a bar in Wyoming. After having a few drinks he started 
staring at a heavyset, long-haired, bearded biker. After a few minutes the 
biker got pissed off, went over to the old man, and asked him why he kept 
staring at him. The old man replied, "I just finished doing twenty-five 
years in prison for screwing a buffalo. I just thought you might be my son."

     Last year on '20/20' Barbara Walters did a documentary on the customs of 
American Indians. After a tour of the reservation, she inquired as to how the
number feathers in the indians' headdress was determined. She asked a brave 
who had only one feather in his headdress. His reply was "Me have only one 
squaw, me have only one feather." She asked another brave, thinking the 
first fellow was only joking. This brave had four feathers in his headdress.
He replied, "Ugh! Me have four feathers because me sleep with four squaws."
Still not convinced the number of feathers indicated the number of squaws 
involved, she decided to interview the chief.

     The Chief had a full headdress of feathers which, needless to say, 
amused Ms. Walters. She asked the Chief, "Why do yuw haff tho many feathuh 
in yuw headwess?" The Chief proudly pounded his chest and said, "Me Chief, 
me fuckem all - big, small, fat, tall - me fuckem all." Horrified, Ms.
Walters stated, "Yuw thould be hung!" The Chief replied, "You damned right, 
me hung - big like buffalo, long like snake ..." Ms. Walters spluttered,
"Yuw dwon't haff to be tho damned hothtile!" The Chief replied, "Hoss-
style, dog-style, wolf-style, any style, me fuckem all!" Tears in her 
eyes, Ms. Walters cried, "Ow, dweer!" The Chief said, "No deer - me no 
fuckem deer - asshole too high and fuckers run too fast. No fuckem deer!"

An office manager learned that, due to increased operating costs and slumping
sales, he would have to let one of his employees go. After much thought he 
narrowed his choices down to two employees: Liz and Jack. Both were equal in 
seniority and both were good workers, so the manager decided that he would 
watch the two at work the next day and the first one to leave their desk was 
the one who would be let go. When they arrived in the morning, both Liz and 
Jack got right to work, and the manager began to wonder if his plan would 
work. About mid-morning, however, Liz got up from her desk and asked Jack 
for some aspirin. The manager had his victim. He caught up with Liz at the 
water fountain: "I'm afraid I have a dilemma here," he said. "I'm going to 
have to lay you or Jack off." "Well then, jack off," Liz snapped. "I've got 
a headache!"

Once upon a time, a Marine Gunny took it upon himself to toilet train his 
son. Being a Marine, the kid was taught "by the numbers." So the Gunny took
his son into the head and he said, "Kid, this is the way you do it by the 
numbers: ONE! You unzip your fly. TWO!  You pull out your crank. THREE! You 
piss! FOUR! You put it back in. FIVE! You zip up your pants. Got it?" The 
little kid, being the son of a Marine, immediately responded with a thunder-
ing, "Aye, aye!" A day or so went by, and the Gunny spied his son going into
the head, so he snuck up to the door and listened: "One! Two! Three! Four! 
Two! Four! Two! Four! ..."

So the bear picked up the rabbit and wiped his ass ...

Two men were hunting in the hills of Kentucky. Bo turned to Jim-Bob, after 
taking a sip from his sixth beer of the hour, and said that he needed to step
into the bushes for a minute. So Bo walked out of sight and pulled out his 
dick. Suddenly, a rattle snake slithered into sight! It coiled in defense, 
as Bo froze - with dick still in hand. The snake, far from intimidated by 
this small cylindrical object, struck and injected his poison into Bo's 
staff. Bo cried and screamed until his Jim-Bob came to his rescue. After 
rearranging the snake with a load of double-00, Jim-Bob calmed
Bo down and told him that he was going for help. So Jim-Bob wandered down 
the holler to a small town. Finding a hand-cranked phone, he called the 
nearest doctor and was told to cut two small incisions near the bite, and 
suck the poison from the wound. Jim-Bob ran back up the holler to Bo - who 
was by then quite distraught and nearly unconscious. Said Jim-Bob to Bo: 
"The doc said ya'll gonna die."

When the Lord made Man, all the parts of the body argued over who would be 
Boss. The Brain explained that since he controlled all the parts of the body,
he should be Boss. The Legs argued that since they took the Man wherever he 
wanted to go, he should be Boss. The Stomach countered with the explanation 
that since he digested all of the food, he should be Boss. The Eyes said that
without them, Man would be helpless, so they should be Boss. Then the Asshole
applied for the job. The other parts of the body laughed so hard that the 
Asshole became mad and closed up. After a few days the Brain went foggy, the
Legs got wobbly, the Stomach got ill, and the Eyes got crossed and were 
unable to see. So they all conceded and made the Asshole Boss. 

This proves that you don't have to be a Brain to be Boss - just an Asshole.

boss replied, "Where will I find another man of your caliber?"

A man had to take a psychological test for a job he was applying for. The
psychologist drew a circle and asked, "What does this remind you of?" The
man thought for a moment and replied, "Sex." The psychologist drew a tri-
angle and asked the same question. Again the applicant answered, "Sex."
"And what about this?" asked the psychologist, drawing a square. "Sex," was
the man's answer. "Well," the psychologist said to him, "you certainly seem
to be obsessed with sex." "What do you mean I'M obsessed with sex?" the man
exclaimed, "You're the one drawing all the dirty pictures!"

Two rich texans, J.D. the rancher, and Bo the oilman, were inseparable
friends. One evening, they made a vow. Whichever one of them died first
would try to contact the other from the spirit world. Not long after that,
J.D. died. Bo was despondent, but he decided to start attending seances in
the hopes of talking to his lifelong friend. For months, he had no luck. 
Then, it happened! He was at a seance when he heard his name called, "Bo, 
Bo, are yew there Bo?" "J.D.," he replied excitedly, "J.D., is that yew?"
"Yes, Bo," the far-off voice said, "It's me." "J.D., where are yew?" Bo 
asked, "What are yew doing?" "Wayull," the disembodied drawled, "I get up,
have something to eat, screw all morning long. Then it's lunch time, so I
have another bite, then I screw most of the afternoon, take a nap, and it's
time to eat again. I screw long into the night, and then I fall into a 
peaceful sleep." "J.D.!" Bo cried, "Ya'll must be in heaven!" "Heaven?"
the voice sighed, "I'm a bull in Oklahoma ..."
