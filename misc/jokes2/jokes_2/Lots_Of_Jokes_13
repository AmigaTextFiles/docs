     There was once a rich man who knew that, within a month, he would die
of cancer. So he invited three of his best friends, an engineer, a doctor, 
a lawyer, to a bequest. The dying man said, "I have worked hard for my 
entire life, for money, and as such I have decided that I want to be buried
with it. However, since the state prohibits all objects from being placed 
in the casket, except for the deceased and one set of clothing, I will 
need your help."  He continued, "Therefore, I will give each of you $1 
million. On the day of the funeral, each of you will approach the casket 
and secretly throw the money into the casket." The three friends took 
the money and left. A month later, after the funeral, the three remaining
friends gathered at a bar to drown their sorrow. The engineer broke the 
silence and said, "I have to confess. Times have been hard lately, so I 
kept $10,000 for myself. I can't believe that I was so weak, I'm truly 
sorry ..." The doctor, moved by his friend's confession, also spoke up. 
"I've also betrayed our friend's memory," he sobbed. "My wife wanted 
another BMW, so I took out $40,000 ..." After they settled down, both 
the engineer and the doctor looked at the lawyer, who had yet to reveal
any indiscretions. The lawyer immediately got indignant at the stares he 
was getting and said, "Don't think that because I am a lawyer that I would
rip him off like you two did." He continued, "I did my part - I threw in
a check for the full $1 million."

One day a indian squaw came across a new water well that had some of the 
best water that she had found. She collected some of the water and took it
back to her husband. The Squaw said, "I have found new well with good water.
Have some." Her husband responded, "Me very thirsty; let me taste water." 
He gulped the water down and said, "Water very good, but strong brave 
husband still thirsty. Squaw fetch more water." The squaw fetched more 
water from the new well, returned some time later, and said, "Here is more
water for brave husband." Her husband replied, "Big brave very thirsty," 
as he gulped down the water. He then said, "Water very good, but strong 
brave -still- thirsty. Squaw fetch more water." So the squaw went back to
the well, returned some time later, and said to her husband, "I could not 
get more water for brave husband." Her husband responded, "Why is that? Has
new well already gone dry?" The squaw replied, "No, white man sitting on 
well."

Harold suspected his wife of playing around on the side, so one day he took
the afternoon off and comes home extra early. He entered his apartment, 
which was on the 3rd floor, and started looking around. Upon entering the 
bedroom he found his wife laying in bed. On her nightstand was a lit ciga-
rette. In the ashtray on his nightstand, on the other side of the bed, 
there was another lit cigarette. Harold went beserk. After beating his wife
upside the head, he proceeded to search the apartment. It was not long 
before he spotted a pair of hands hanging on the window sill, outside 
the bedroom. He grabbed one of the ashtrays and pounded on the hands until
the battered fingers let go. Despite falling thirty feet the cuckold was
still alive and trying to crawl away. Now worried that he might go to jail
if his wife's lover lived to tell the police, Harold ran into the kitchen 
and pushed the refrigerator into the bedroom and out the window. He was 
so worked up, and the refrigerator was so heavy, that the effort of 
pushing it out the window gave poor Harold a heart attack, and he died.

When Harold arrived at the Pearly Gates, St. Peter asked Harold what had
happened to him. Harold told his story, and Peter let him in. Soon there-
after a second guy showed up for admission to Heaven. When St. Peter asked
him why he was there, he said "I don't know what happened, I was a window 
cleaner. I was working on the fifth floor of an apartment building when 
my safety strap broke and I fell. I caught myself on the ledge of a 3rd 
floor apartment. Then somebody smashed my hands and made me fall to the 
sidewalk. I was stunned, but okay. The next thing I know, I look up and 
there is a refrigerator coming down at me ..." He too was allowed in. 
It was not long before a third potential angel approached the gates.
St. Peter asked the third guy, "What happened to you?" The guy said, 
"I don't know. I was sitting in this refrigerator minding my own 
business ..."

Dear Mr. Smith,

     We regret to inform you that we have rejected your application to model
and represent our product - TROJAN CONDOMS. Although your general apearance
is not displeasing, our Board of Directors feel that your wearing our pro-
duct does not portray a positive, romantic image of our product. A loose, 
baggy and wrinkled condom is not considered romantic. We did admire your 
efforts to firm it up by using polygrip, but even then it slipped off 
before we could get a photograph taken. We would like to note, however, 
that we have never seen a penis that looked like a bicycle grip until now.

     We appreciate your interest and thank you for your time. We will 
retain your application for future consideration, if by some chance we 
decide there is a market for micro-mini condoms. We send our greetings 
deepest sympathy to your wife and/or girlfriend.

Very truly yours,

Jack Meoff
President

procession had passed, I asked him, "Bill, that was damn respectful of you
to pause for a procession like that. Why the unusual behavior?" "It's the
least I could do for my wife ..."

An polack walked into a travel agency and demanded the special Hawaiian
tour. The travel agent said, "I'm sorry, I handle Caribbean cruises. Hawaiin
tours are just through the door." So the polack opened the door. As he was
walking through the door, someone hit him over the head, knocking him uncon-
cious, stole his wallet, and threw him in the dumpster.  Later that day, 
an aggie walked into the same travel agency and asked for the same Hawaiian
tour. Again, the travel agent explained that he handled cruises and sent
the aggie to the office next door. As soon as the aggie opened the door, 
he got the same treatment. When the polack and the aggie woke up, they found
themselves floating in the middle of the ocean on a small raft. The aggie 
looked at polack and asked, "I wonder if they'll fly us back?" The polack
responded knowingly, "They didn't last year ..."

One morning, the county sheriff was having a cup of coffee at the donut shop,
when all of a sudden a kid on a tricycle zoomed down the street. The sheriff
was so startled he spilled coffee all over himself, but the tricycle was gone
before anything could be done; it had been going at least 50. Later that 
afternoon while the sheriff was enjoying a nap behind a billboard, the 
same boy zoomed by again, doing about 70. The sheriff was again startled,
but decided he ought to do something before the kid sideswiped a semi.
So the sheriff set up a speed trap. No sooner had the sheriff finished, 
than the kid came screaming down the sidewalk about 80! The sheriff spun
gravel and hauled ass after the speeding tricycle. The kid immediately 
pulled over. "Did ya'll know thah ya'll wus SPEE-ding?" drawled the sheriff,
"And how did ya'll git thah tri-CEE-cle tuh go thah fast anyway?" The little
boy replied, "There's a little motor under the seat." "Like hail!" said
the sheriff, who proceeded to look under the seat. "Wuhl I'll be damned!"
said the sheriff, "Whuh did ya'll git such a pow-ful little mohtuh?" "I got
it from an artificial lung," said the boy. "Ya'll papa let ya'll do thah?
Didn't he have a thing tuh say 'bout thah?" "No," said the boy, "He just
said 'U-u-u-u-uhhhhh ...'"

Three gays are driving around San Francisco, when they had to stop for a 
red light. Unfortunately, the large semi-trailer behind them burned out 
his breaks on the steep downgrade and slammed into the back of the gays' 
car. Bruce, the gay who was driving, looked at his buddies and asked if
they were okay. One friend, Harvey, complained of a sore neck. So Bruce
jumped out of the car, stormed up to the truck, and pounded on the door
saying, "I hope you've got good insurance buddy, my friend is really hurt!"
The truck driver, a real road hog, rolled down the window and said, "Suck 
my motherfucking dick, you faggot!" Bruce just smiled and pranced back to
his car. "We're in luck fellas," said Bruce, "he wants to settle out of
court ..."

A young man, in love with a girl he wanted to make love to, was so ashamed 
of his small penis that he was afraid of bringing up the question, or of 
letting her see him naked. One dark night he drove her around in his car 
and parked in a dark lane. As they kissed, he surreptitiously opened his 
fly and put his weapon in her hand. "Thanks," she said, "But you know I 
don't smoke."

     One night, Luke Duke picked up Daisy at the bar. They were on their 
way to the local lover's lane when a traffic light changed from green to
red. Luke gunned the engine and sped through the red light. Curious, Daisy
asked, "Why did you do that?" Luke just said, "Don't worry, my brother does
it all the time." At the next intersection, the light changed again. Again
they sped through it. Daisy, starting to reconsider the wisdom of being in
the same vehicle as Luke, asked, "Why do you keep doing that?" "Don't 
worry," replied Luke, "my brother drives like this." At the next inter-
section, the last one in the town with a light, the light turned green. 
As all the other pick-up trucks started moving, Luke screeched to a rubber
burning halt. Daisy, by now in a panic, screamed, "What are you doing?!" 
Replied Luke, "I have to be careful; my bother might be coming the other
way ..."

One night at a bar in San Francisco, a sailor and marine, both on shore 
leave, started arguing about which service was better, who could drink more,
who had the bigger dick, etc. Well, needless to say, the bartender stepped
in and said, "Okay, let's settle this once and for all; whip em' out!" So
the two guys whipped their dicks out and laid them on the bar. Just then
a fag walked in. The bartender told the two guys to hold on for a sec while
he served the fag. The bartender asked the fag what he'd have. "Well, I was
going to have a white wine spritzer," the fag lisped as he looked down
the bar at the two guys with their cranks hanging out, "but now I think
I'll have the buffet."

said, "Let me see if I got this right. That's two bloods and a blood-lite?"

     Three yuppers, Sven, Ole and Karl, were sitting in a boat fishing. 
It was a grey autumn morning, a light drizzle fell from the skies and the 
lake reflected like the color of old pewter. The fishermen became dazed, 
hypnotized by the mesmerizing act of watching thier lines. Karl fell out
of the boat. Five minutes went by ... Ten minutes went by ... Fifteen
minutes went by ... "Hey," said Sven, "where's Karl?" "Oh My God!" cried 
Ole, "He's fallen into the lake!" So Sven stripped off his raincoat and 
heavy jacket and leapt into the water, diving frantically to find his 
missing pal. A minute later, Sven surfaced and heaved the limp and dripping
wet lost fisherman into the boat. Ole immediately began CPR. "Hey," said Ole
as he came up for air, "I don't remember Karl's breath being -that- bad."
"Hey," scowled Sven, "Come to think of it, I don't remember Karl being

Two maintenance men, Pat O'Brien and Ivan Petrovich were working around on 
the launch pad of the space shuttle one day, when Pat noticed some fuel
leaking from one of the o-ring seals. Ivan immediately notified mission 
control, which instructed Ivan and Pat to try to contain the fuel spill 
until NASA could figure out what else to do. So, Pat and Ivan started 
putting buckets, cans, jars, and whatever else they could find, under the
leaking engines. After several hours (it took the NASA bureaucracy -long-
time to figure out who to blame) Ivan decided to taste the fuel.

Ivan: "Hey, Pat! Take a sip of this shit. It ain't half-bad."

Pat: "Are you crazy?"

Ivan: "No, really. It's kinda like vodka or something."

Pat: "Hey, you're right! This -is- good stuff ..."

Ivan: "Yea, and I think I'm getting a good buzz off it too ..."

So, Pat and Ivan continued to consume their new-found source of entertain-
ment. The fuel spill was quickly disposed of. The next morning, Ivan got a
phone call.

Ivan: "Hello?"

Pat: "Hey Ivan, how are feeling?"

Ivan: "Pretty good, actually. I don't have a hangover or nuthin'!"

Pat: "Have you gone to the bathroom yet?"

Ivan: "No, why?"

Pat: "Because I'm calling you from Australia ..."

     One night a travelling salesman found that he had stayed on the road
too long, and that he was stranded in the middle farm country with no place
to sleep. Naturally, he sought refuge at the nearest farm house. The farmer
agreed to let him stay, but only as long as "you don't sneak upstairs to my
daughter's room." The salesman promised but, as with all travelling sales-
men, he found it hard to resist the lure of a farmer's daughter. 

     In the middle of the night the salesman crept up the stairs to the
daughter's room, where he found her naked, spread-eagled on the bed. The 
salesman immediately dove between her legs and started eating her out. He
had just gotten his tongue wet, when he got a mouthful of rice. Undeterred,
he spit out the rice and resumed his tongue lashing. Once again, he got
a mouthful of rice. Puzzled, but still horny, he started eating her out 
again. When he got another mouthful of rice, and still no response from
the daughter, the salesman gave up and went back to bed.

     The next morning the salesman told the farmer, "I have to confess: 
Last night I went up to your daughter's room." "That's okay son," replied
the kindly, old farmer. "And I have to confess that I had oral sex with 
her," continued the salesman. "I ain't got a quarrel with that, son," 
replied the kindly, old farmer. "But I have just one question," concluded
the salesman, "Why is it that every time I ate her, I kept getting a mouth-
ful of rice?" "Oh that?" said the kindly, old farmer, "Them's maggots - 
she's been dead ten years."

After months of scrimping and bargain hunting to make ends meet, a woman
begged her tight-fisted husband to give her some shopping money. "Can't you
just give me an extra ten dollars so I can buy a roast?" she asked. Her
husband pulled a ten-dollar bill from his pocket and held it up to the 
mirror. "See the money in the mirror? That's yours. And this," he said,
putting the ten-spot back in his pocket, "is mine." The next evening, he
went home to find the table filled with a Roman feast of glazed ham, stuffed
hens, fresh fruit, steaming veggies, baked alaska, etc, etc, etc. "Where 
did you get the money for all this?" the husband barked. His wife took him
to the mirror. "See this body in the mirror? That's yours. And this one," she
said, pulling off her dress, "is the grocer's."

A young lady went to the doctor for a check-up. The doctor started looking
her over and noticed a rash, in the shape of a "Y," on her chest. When he 
asked her to explain its origin, she stammered, "Well ... you see ... uh 
... my boyfriend goes to Yale, and ... er ... well, he likes to make love
with his sweater on." "That's no problem," said the doctor, as he gave her
a tube 'Rash-Away.' A few days later, a second young lady went to see the
same doctor. When the doctor started examining the second young lady, he
noticed she had an "H"-shaped rash on her chest. When he asked her to
explain its origin, she stammered, "Well ... you see ... uh ... my boy-
friend goes to Harvard, and ... well, he likes to make love with his
sweater on." "That's no problem," said the doctor, as he gave her a tube
of 'Rash-Away.' A few weeks later, a third young lady went to the same 
doctor. When the doctor started checking her over, he noticed she had an
"M"-shaped rash. "Don't tell me," said the doctor, "Your boyfriend goes
to Michigan and he likes to make love with his sweater on ..." "Well, not
exactly," said the woman. "My girlfriend goes to Wisconsin and ..."

One weekend, a yupper and an aggie were arguing about who had the best way
of folding a parachute. They finally decided the best way to judge would be
to go up in a plane, jump out, and see which parachute performed better.
So they both went up and jumped out of the plane at the same time. The yupper
pulled his ripcord first; the parachute opened and he began drifting slowly
towards the ground. Then the aggie pulled his ripcord, but nothing happened!
The aggie plummeted past the yupper. Cutting his parachute risers, the 
yupper yelled, "Oh, so you wanna -RACE- now, eh?"

bably a better deal than he gave you. And we won't beat you upside the head.

Harry went to a doctor to have his knees examined. "What are you doing 
that's making your knees so raw?" asked the doctor. "Well ... I like to 
do it doggie style, doc, and ... well ... I just can't get enough," answered
Harry. Concerned, the doctor advised Harry to "Take it a little easier."
Two weeks later, Harry went back for a follow-up exam; his knees were even
worse - dripping puss and blood. Aghast, the doctor had a hard time con-
trolling his temper. "What the hell are you doing?" said the doctor. "I told
you doc," Harry meekly replied, "I love to do it doggie style." The doctor,
his anger spent, said, "Damn, son, can't you turn her over?" Surprised, 
Harry replied, "Hell no doc, have you ever smelled a dog's breath?"

     Two travelling salesmen, Jack and Bob, were driving through along a
desolate stretch of Kansas highway when their car broke down. It was getting
late, and the only building for miles around was a weather-battered old gas
station a mile up the road. Jack and Bob went up to the adjacent trailor and
knocked on the door. A knarled, old, baggy-titted widow answered the door. 
"Ma'am," said Jack, "Our car broke down. Do you think we could stay here 
tonight?" "Well," said the widow, "I only have one bed. One of you can sleep
with me, but the other will have to sleep on the porch. Y'all decide who 
sleeps where ..." 

     Jack and Bob both knew that whoever slept in the widow's bed would have
to screw her ugly, gnarled body, so they flipped a quarter to see who got 
the dubious honor. Bob lost and so he slept on the porch. Jack tentatively
crawled under the sheets. The widow lost no time tearing Jack's clothes off
(something he had conveniently neglected to do). "Wait a minute," said Jack,
"I like to do it in the dark." The widow agreed and so Jack got up to turn 
out the lights. That was when he noticed a bucket full of corn beside the 
bed. When he crawled back under the covers, Jack grabbed an ear of corn and
started screwing the widow with it. Thw widow, being rather 'wide,' did not
notice the difference - she started moaning and screaming. Bob, sleeping 
outside, heard all the commotion and crept up to the window so he could 
better hear the action. 

     Inside, every time the corn got soggy, Jack threw it out the window.
The widow, who hadn't had a man in decades, was insatiable and so the corn-
screwing went on all night. The next morning, their car repaired, Jack and
Bob were driving along, when Bob started giggling. "What's so funny?" asked
Jack. Bob started guffawing. "What the hell is so funny?" shouted Jack. Bob,
finally regaining control of himself, said, "Last night while you had to 
screw that ugly widow, I was a laying back eating buttered corn!"

     A maid arrived at work one day to find Leona Helmsley hanging from the
ceiling, with one hand grasping the chandelier, and the other clenched

Her tongue was blue and protruding. She was obviously dead. As the coroner
took the deceased Leona away, the maid said to a paramedic, "She always was

could draw was that it must have been rammed by a ferry ...

Marvin was the world's oldest virgin. After years and years of putting ads
in singles' papers and enlisting in dating services, he was nearly penni-
less. In desperation, he went to a whorehouse. "Lady," Marvin said to the
madam, "I'm desperate. I need to get laid - and all I got is this quarter!"
The madam, like all madams, had a heart of gold. She said, "I'm here to 
help you. Go see the girl in the last room ... And keep the change." So,
Marvin went down the hall to the last room. There he found a fat, ugly
whore, naked, spread-eagled on the bed. But Marvin didn't care, he just
wanted to screw. So, he tore off his clothes and dove between her legs.
Marvin had just begun to the eat out the whore when he got a mouthfull
of beef. So intent was Marvin on getting laid, he thought nothing of it;
he spit out the beef and resumed tongue lashing the whore. A minute later
Marvin got a mouthfull of carrots. Even though he was starting to get a
little worried, Marvin was still more horny than worried - he spit out
the carrots and returned to eating the whore. Within seconds, Marvin got
a mouthfull of peas. Spitting out the peas he yelled, "What's the matter?
Are you sick or something?" "No," replied the whore, "but the guy before
you was ..."

A man named Smith stopped by the doctor's office to see what the doc found 
wrong with Mrs. Smith. The doctor told Mr. Smith that he had treated two
Mrs. Smith's that day, and that the secretary had mixed up their records.
"Your wife," continued the dcotor, "either has AIDS or Alzheimer's." Mr.
Smith asked, "How do I tell which one my wife has?" "Take her out in the
woods," said the doctor, "and leave her there. If she finds her way back
home, don't screw her."

The foreman at the sawmill wasn't eager to hire the blind man because of 
the obvious risks involved, but the guy begged for a chance. "You'll see," 
he said. "Just put me downstream of the saw and and I'll smell the type and
length of the lumber and stack it accordingly."
 
So the foreman agreed to give it a shot. Positioning the blind man, he
sent down a twelve-foot piece of pine. "Ahhh ..." said the man, breathing
in deeply, "pine, twelve-foot." And he stacked it in the right place. The
foreman repeated the test with oak and redwood, fir and mohagony, and the 
blind guy didn't miss once. Then, getting a sly look on his face, the fore-
man sent for the office secretary, old Mabel, and told her to hike up her 
skirts and ride down the conveyor belt.

Mabel rode through, faceup, right past the blind man. Sniffing furiously 
and looking very puzzled, he asked that the last piece of wood be sent 
through again. The foreman complied, but not before telling Mabel, skirt 
still up, to turn over. After a few moments of reflection, the blind man 
turned to the foreman with a with a triumphant smile. "I've got it!" he
proclaimed, "That's the shithouse door from a tuna boat!"

           There once was a guy named Benny. He was sitting in the bleachers at Fenway
one day when Wade Boggs hit a homerun. He told the guy next to him, Eddie,
that he knew everyone. Eddie seriously doubted this and bet twenty dollars        
Benny did not know Wade Boggs. So, after the game, they went to the club-
house where the great third baseman shook Benny's hand and invited him out
for beers. Eddie was impressed, but not satisfied; he bet $1000 that Benny
did not know the President of the United States. So, Benny and Eddie went
to the White House, where the President invited them to a State Dinner 
honoring the Queen of England. Eddie was astonished! Still he was doubtful
that Benny knew -EVERYONE-. He bet a million dollars that Benny did not know
the Pope. So, Benny and Eddie went to St. Peter's Square in Rome. There the
Pope was saying mass for 100,000 people. Benny walked up and stood behind
the Pope. After the mass, just as the Pope embraced Benny warmly, Benny 
noticed Eddie fainting. Benny rushed over to Eddie and woke him up with
smelling salts. "What happened Eddie?" Benny asked. Eddie replied, "I was
surprised when you knew Wade Boggs, and shocked when you knew the President,
but when a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked, 'Who is that guy with
Benny?'..."

took a look and dug into his own pocket. "Here's fifty cents change."
