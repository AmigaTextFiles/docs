                The Royal Story
                --- Chapter two


Inside the royal palace, in the royal bedroom, sat the king and the luscious
queen. They were preparing to have an intim moment with each other, and were
discussing their daughters.
  "A princess less again", said the king, "I hear she promised herself as a
slave to a woodcutter boy. Isn't that stupid?" "Just look at her elder sister",
said the queen, "she went to the neighbouring kingdom after the kingdom's
princess's breasts - she said nobody could use her well enough in her home
kingdom."

The queen took off her cape and dress, and laid herself down on the bed. The
king still sat beside her. "Fortunately we still have her younger sister",
said the king, glancing at the young princess, who hung chained to a wall,
wearing her most beautiful ball-dress.
  The king unchained the princess from the wall and ordered her to dance for
them, as he laid himself down on top of the queen. The princess danced a long,
beautiful and erotic dance, during which she cleared her ball-dress off very
fast. After finishing, the princess just stood on the floor naked, on top of
her ball-dress.

After a while, the king heard a knock on the bedroom door. "Come in", he said.
Through the door entered a young boy, a servant boy whose task was to serve a
little snack to the king and the queen after that intim moment during which the
king lets his imagination fly on the queen's delicious body.
  "Here is a little snack for you", said the boy, handing the king and the
queen their food. "The princess still won't eat anything, will she?" "No", said
the queen, "she's too young to eat food."

As the boy stood looking nervous and troubled, the king asked him what was
wrong. "Have you got something to tell me? Is it about our princess?" he asked.
And the boy replied.
  "Yes, in fact, it is. You see, this is the first time I have seen your
daughter completely naked" - the princess still stood over her ball-dress,
passing her time by caressing her undeniably shapely breasts - "and I fell in
love with her breasts immediately. Could it somehow be possible for me to..."
  "...have her as a slave? Oh, certainly!" the king said, laughing. "Would you
like her clothed or naked?" "Um - naked, if you please. I've always liked naked
girls." "So be it!" said the king, throwing the princess's ball-dress into the
fireplace, where it quickly burned to cinder.
  Then the king chained and gagged his daughter, ushering her towards her new
owner.
  "This is your new owner", he said, "I want you to try to obey and please him
whenever possible." The princess mumbled affirmative noises from behind her
gag. Then the boy took hold of her arm and they both left through the door,
closing it after them.

As the queen was taking the rest of her clothes off, the king asked: "Have we
got any princesses left?" "Oh, certainly", the queen said, pointing towards a
wardrobe. "Open that wardrobe and you shall see."
  The king opened the wardrobe and found inside six lovely princesses, all
hanging naked, chained and gagged from a metal bar over their ball-dresses and
high-heeled shoes. The king chose the three most beautiful princesses and hung
them on the wall.
  Then he closed the wardrobe, chained the queen to the bed, and laid himself
down on top of her.
