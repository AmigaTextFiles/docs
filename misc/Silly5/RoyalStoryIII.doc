            The Royal Story
            --- Chapter three


For many months life had been happy in the royal palace. The king had long
since released his six beautiful daughters from their wardrobe and put them
into use as his personal playthings. But now the king was very sad indeed.
  The reason for the king's sadness was that some days ago, the princesses
had disappeared. "Where could my daughters be?" he pondered. Then he decided
that he must have help searching for the princesses. He designed a notice and
hung copies on it on every wall of the palace he could imagine. The notice
stated a reward of three young slave-girls and a bag of gold for anyone who
finds the princesses.

A little boy who had come into the palace to work was strolling around in the
corridor. He paused for a while to look out of the window, onto the beach.
There he saw another boy of his age, who seemed to be the only boy on the beach
without at least one bikini-clad girl by his side.
  The boy in the palace went on walking. He had seen the king's notice and was
fascinated by the idea. "I could well use three young slave-girls and a bag of
gold", he thought. "But how am I going to find the missing princesses?" He
rested, leaning on a part of the wall.
  Suddenly, the wall gave way under his weight. It whirled a complete circle,
taking him away from the corridor and into an altogether different room. In the
room he saw the six most beautiful girls in the whole kingdom: the missing
princesses.

The princesses were clad in their most beautiful silken ball-dresses and
sparkling high-heeled shoes, and had pretty little flowers in their hair. Oddly
enough, the boy noted, they were not chained and gagged. Thinking the
princesses hadn't noticed him, he went to the window, and once again looked
onto the beach.
  He saw the boy he had seen before, but this time a lovely girl clad only in a
tight rubber miniskirt walked towards him. The palace boy couldn't hear what
the boy and the girl said, but fortunately enough, he had taken a course in
lip-reading so he could still decipher their messages to each other.
  His watching was interrupted by one of the princesses, seemingly the eldest.
"Ah, so you have found our secret hiding place", she said. The boy turned
around to face her. "What is this place? What are you doing here?" he asked.
"Although our father is a very nice and kind man", she replied, "he does get a
little bit boring sometimes. At certain times we even feel ourselves not to be
in need of another of his lovingly intimate moments with us."
  "And so?" he asked. "And so we escaped from him, when he went to sleep and we
had to lie on the floor, as usual", she answered. "This room was designed by us
when the palace was being built. It was done in complete secrecy." "Though I
think the architect wouldn't have kept it secret had we not promised him a
night of wild love with us", interrupted one of the other princesses.

The eldest princess told the boy all about their secret chamber, including how
it can be locked from the inside so that no one will find it. Every one of the
six princesses carried a key hidden in a secret cavity in her panties, so they
could come and go as they pleased.
  "You are, of course, aware that your father is seeking you back?" the boy
asked, suddenly. "Of course", said one of the princesses, "please do not inform
him on our present location! We will do anything if you only do keep this
secret!" And as any boy would have done, he demanded that the princesses become
his slave-girls forever, which they did. They even handed over their keys to
this secret room to him.
  Not feeling his usual passion for girls, the boy once again turned to the
window, seeing the other boy and the pretty girl. He concentrated on the
movements of their lips. "Hello", said the girl. "Hello", said the boy on the
beach. "I want you to help me in a certain problem", she said. The boy
requested knowledge of the problem's nature. Suddenly, in the middle of the
intriguing conversation he'd been viewing, the boy came upon a brilliant idea.
  He took his pocket camera out of his pocket and commanded the princesses to
move into a place that wouldn't give any information of their whereabouts. Then
he took a photograph of them. Then he waited until all noise from outside the
secret door had stopped, and stepped out into the corridor.

The boy went straight into the king's room and found the king sitting on his
bed. "I have found your daughters. Here is a photograph of them", the boy said.
"Bring them to me and you shall have your reward!" said the king. "Just a
minute, your majesty", said the boy. "I don't trust you to actually give me my
reward after getting your daughters back. I want the reward first!"
  The king agreed to this demand and sent for three young slave-girls from his
dungeons, and a bag of gold from his treasury. They were shortly brought to the
boy. "Now I shall go and fetch the princesses", the boy said and left the royal
bedroom with his three new slave-girls and the bag of gold. On his way he
paused once again to look out of the window. The conversation between the boy
and the girl was still continuing.
  "My problem is this", the girl said. "This morning I decided to dress up in
my tightest rubber miniskirt. Although I usually like wearing tight rubber, I
found this dress far too tight for my comfort. I wish to take it off, but am by
myself unable to do so. Could you help me?" "What shall you give to me as a
reward?" asked the boy on the beach. "Myself", said the girl.

The boy in the palace could hear footsteps coming from the distance. The sounds
were not the common stumps his own feet made, nor the delicate clicks of his
slave-girls' high-heeled shoes. The boy judged this to be a potential threat to
him and quickly entered the secret chamber with his new belongings.
  There he saw the six princesses he had expected to see. He had now developed
a passion for girls, so he ordered all of his nine slave-girls to undress
themselves naked and then chained and gagged them. Just before going to bed
with the nine girls, the boy decided to watch the beach story to the end.
  The boy on the beach had agreed to the girl's proposition and was pulling her
miniskirt off from the hem, while she herself pushed it off from her breasts.
Eventually, the miniskirt was removed and the girl stood naked and grateful in
front of the boy. They took hold of each other's arms and walked to the beach
kiosk in the distance.
  The boy in the palace judged this to be the end and began a magnificent
erotic adventure with his nine girls in the secret chamber's bed.
