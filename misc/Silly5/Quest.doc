Once upon a time there was an ordinary planet named Vulgaria. It was so
ordinary that one of its dreamy inhabitants, Sodium (they were named after
metals) wanted some excitement in his life.

So he gathered around with his friends, Zinc, Titane and Mercury and started
planning a journey in space. It was going to be dangerous and mysterious. Zinc
had a spaceship, which she (for she was female, and her friends, Gold,
Plutonium and Litium, were female too) hadn't used a lot, so it was in mint
condition.
  The Vulgarians all climbed aboard the Carbon Mallard (it was named that way,
because the Vulgarians always like to name something after antimetals) and it
blasted off. They were free! Not even Vulgaria's king, Lawrencium, could stop
them now. They travelled from one mysterious place to another even more
mysterious place.

When they had travelled on approximately 104.5 planets, they came across a
black hole. They were so careless that it consumed them. The vast gravity of
the hole tore the Carbon Mallard and its inhabitants to singular atoms, but it
didn't matter, because Vulgarians are known of their ability to disintegrate
into singular atoms and reintegrate. But the Carbon Mallard was, being
inanimate, broken beyond repair.

Just as Titane was saying that they cannot breathe in space which contained no
methane, the gravity of a nearby planet dragged them down into its orbit, where
they met another Vulgarian, Iron, whose spaceship, the Nitrogen Swan, had
survived (funny word, because it was inanimate just as well as the late Carbon
Mallard) the gravity of the black hole.
  Not thinking another moment, Sodium, Zinc, Titane and Mercury entered the
Nitrogen Swan. It was a very small spaceship, just big enough to hold the five
of them. Iron decided to descend on the planet, which was named Kryos, because
of its unbearably icy weather.
  It was shocking to find out that the atmosphere contained no methane, so they
had to use their spacesuits, which converted oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen
(which the atmosphere contained very much) into methane. It was not very
comfortable in the suits, especially for Mercury, who had put on weight.
  Zinc complained to Sodium, that it was his fault, that they were stranded on
Kryos. But when Sodium said to her that the journey was most exciting, she
remained silent. They went on and on searching for help, until Titane spotted a
thin strip of ceramics. It read "Aluminium Mallard".

"What could it have to do in a place like this?", thought Sodium as he
accidentally hit it. Half of the visible landscape began to move, revealing a
whole colony, which was just the same as Vulgaria, but was the exact opposite
of it. The inhabitants were named after antimetals and they named things after
metals.
  It was very pleasant and peaceful in the colony, so Sodium, Zinc, Titane,
Mercury and Iron decided to stay there. They bought a house (very cheap, the
cost was only 12.800.000 buckazoids) next door to a few colonians, named
Oxygen, Neon and Iodine. They all lived happily ever after.
