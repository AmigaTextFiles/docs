                Rien ne va plus


When the heroes of these adventures (such as Jeemi Bilisdo, Jyssa Nirdam, Jirme
Ihegis, Merlin and Norlam) want to relax (?) they come to play the Ludicusian
wrestling roulette. It is an entertaining and cunning game, in which the
players bet money on beasts, who fight each other in bloody wrestling matches.

Jeemi Bilisdo began by betting 20 buckazoids on Pair. Merlin bet 7 buckazoids
on Rouge and 7 on Impair. The Gorzans, who are the only human creatures on
Junglion, each bet 3 buckazoids on numbers 5, 18 and 21 respectively. After the
first betting had been completed the Ludicusian game host said the strange
words which mean "Rien ne va plus", French for "No more bets" in Ignimusian,
which is the tongue spoken by most alien races in the quadrant of the galaxy
where Ludicus is situated.

The wrestling section began. The players settled comfortably on their chairs.
They watched how the baboon from Firgoz shred the giant insect from Omikron
Centauri III to a bloody mess. Jeemi Bilisdo won 175 buckazoids. They watched,
how the humanoid from Alpha Pavonis VI used its raygun to vaporise the sabre-
tooth tiger from Pyros. The Gorzans each lost 27 buckazoids. They watched, how
the shapeless blob from Hydranus Explus crushed the elephant ant from Epi-
metheus beneath itself. Merlin won 204 buckazoids.

Jeemi Bilisdo, Merlin and the Gorzans moved aside victorious (the Gorzans had
actually lost, but they were used to lying, since clever disguise can be the
only way to escape the teeth of a Gigantosaurus in Junglion). Jyssa Nirdam,
Jirme Ihegis and Norlam stepped to the table.

Jyssa Nirdam boldly bet 52 buckazoids on Impair. Jirme Ihegis followed by
betting 33 divided evenly among the numbers 3, 12 and 23. Norlam bet on Verde.
After the game host had said the familiar sounds a new wrestling section began.
It was partly among the survivors from the previous section and partly among
new beasts.

The baboon favoured by Jeemi Bilisdo perished when nitrous acid melted its head
away, while a plant-being from Ttohh jumped from joy. Jyssa Nirdam lost 156
buckazoids. The shapeless blob from Hydranus Explus wasn't a disappointment,
it made mincemeat of a lump of ribbons from Sirius III. Jirme Ihegis won 198
buckazoids. A water elemental from Athena literally went to pieces between the
teeth of a giant fish from Beta Borealii IV. Norlam lost 70 buckazoids.

So another Ludicuisan wrestling roulette had ended. The players each went to
their home planets, victorious or otherwise while the grotesque beasts behind
the armoured glass either jumped victoriously or lay in a bloody mess. To some
the day was a great success, but not to everyone. But when Ludicusian wrestling
roulette is concerned, one cannot always win.
